Recently, another\nchallenge, termed inter-task class separation (ICS), was also identified, which\nspurred a theoretical study into principled approaches for solving continual\nlearning. Further research has shown that by leveraging the theory and the\npower of large foundation models, it is now possible to achieve upper-bound\naccuracy, which has been empirically validated using both text and image\nclassification datasets.

The topology and directions of\nsuch recoils provide important particle identification and kinematical\nconstraints, and are experimentally accessible in gaseous targets. Electron\nrecoils have complex trajectories, and the angular resolution that can be\nachieved has not been well understood. We have developed a method for\nestimating and optimizing this angular resolution, considering contributions\nfrom both multiple scattering and detection. First, we clarify that the formula\ncommonly used for multiple scattering through small angles is actually a fit to\nMoliere theory for heavy particles. We revise this formula so that it is\napplicable to electrons in gas. Next, we combine this with an effective point\nresolution contribution, which accounts for diffusion and detector effects, to\nobtain an approximation for the angular resolution. We identify the optimal fit\nlength and the corresponding optimal angular resolution. The result is a simple\nformula to estimate the best achievable angular resolution for electrons in\ngaseous detectors, given the electron energy and basic gas and detector\nproperties. Our model's predictions show good agreement with simulations. This\napproach can assist in the design of future experiments and the development of\nanalysis techniques.

By integrating\ntraditional surrogate models like Gaussian processes and random forests with\npowerful LLMs such as DeepSeek-R1, a hierarchical architecture is proposed. Two\nCoT-building methods, Large Language Model-Chain of Thought (LLM-CoT) and\nMachine Learning-Large Language Model-Chain of Thought (ML-LLM-CoT), are\nstudied.

In the AR phase, we leverage LLMs to extract soft attributes (e.g.,\nEmphasis on simplicity and minimalism in design) from raw texts, and combine\nthem with programmatically derived hard attributes (e.g., The text should be\nbetween 300 and 400 words) to construct massive (around 45) multi-attribute\nrequirements, which guide the fine-grained text reconstruction process under\nweak supervision. In the GPO phase, we apply direct preference optimization\n(DPO) to refine text generation under diverse attribute combinations, enabling\nefficient exploration of the global combination space. Additionally, we\nintroduce an efficient attribute sampling strategy to identify and correct\npotentially erroneous attributes, further improving global optimization.

However, no\nresearch has examined the impact of LLM size on factual inconsistency in D2T.\nIn this paper, we investigate how factual inconsistency in D2T scales with LLM\nsize by exploring two scaling laws: power law and exponential scaling.

    "abstract": "Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have shown impressive performance in\nvarious tasks. However, LVLMs suffer from hallucination, which hinders their\nadoption in the real world. Existing studies emphasized that the strong\nlanguage priors of LVLMs can overpower visual information, causing\nhallucinations. However, the positive role of language priors is the key to a\npowerful LVLM. If the language priors are too weak, LVLMs will struggle to\nleverage rich parameter knowledge and instruction understanding abilities to\ncomplete tasks in challenging visual scenarios where visual information alone\nis insufficient. Therefore, we propose a benchmark called LanP to rethink the\nimpact of Language Priors in LVLMs. It is designed to investigate how strong\nlanguage priors are in current LVLMs. LanP consists of 170 images and 340\ncorresponding well-designed questions. Extensive experiments on 25 popular\nLVLMs reveal that many LVLMs' language priors are not strong enough to\neffectively aid question answering when objects are partially hidden. Many\nmodels, including GPT-4 Turbo, exhibit an accuracy below 0.5 in such a\nscenario.",

This paper fills this gap by\ndeveloping algorithm-specific stability based generalization bounds for a class\nof approximate Bayesian algorithms that includes VI, specifically when using\nstochastic gradient descent to optimize their objective. As in the non-Bayesian\ncase, the generalization error is bounded by by expected parameter differences\non a perturbed dataset.

Once trial evidence becomes available, modelling will be\nnecessary to predict impacts on final outcomes (benefits and harms), account\nfor heterogeneity in determining clinical and cost-effectiveness, and explore\nalternative screening programme specifications. The natural history of disease\n(NHD) component of a MCED model will use statistical, mathematical or\ncalibration methods. Methods: Modelling approaches for MCED screening that\ninclude an NHD component were identified from the literature, reviewed and\ncritically appraised. Purposively selected (non-MCED) cancer screening models\nwere also reviewed. The appraisal focussed on the scope, data sources,\nevaluation approaches and the structure and parameterisation of the models.\nResults: Five different MCED NHD models were identified and reviewed, alongside\nfour additional (non-MCED) models. The critical appraisal highlighted several\nfeatures of this literature. In the absence of trial evidence, MCED effects are\nbased on predictions derived from test accuracy. These predictions rely on\nsimplifying assumptions with unknown impacts, such as the stage-shift\nassumption used to estimate mortality impacts from predicted stage-shifts. None\nof the MCED models fully characterised uncertainty in the NHD or examined\nuncertainty in the stage-shift assumption. Conclusion: MCED technologies are\ndeveloping rapidly, and large and costly clinical studies are being designed\nand implemented across the globe. Currently there is no modelling approach that\ncan integrate clinical study evidence and therefore, in support of policy, it\nis important that similar efforts are made in the development of MCED models\nthat make best use of the available data on benefits and harms.",

    "abstract": "Transformers have become the backbone of neural network architecture for most\nmachine learning applications. Their widespread use has resulted in multiple\nefforts on accelerating attention, the basic building block of transformers.\nThis paper tackles the challenges associated with accelerating attention\nthrough a hardware-software co-design approach while leveraging\ncompute-in-memory(CIM) architecture. In particular, our energy- and\narea-efficient CIM based accelerator, named HASTILY, aims to accelerate softmax\ncomputation, an integral operation in attention, and minimize their high\non-chip memory requirements that grows quadratically with input sequence\nlength. Our architecture consists of novel CIM units called unified compute and\nlookup modules(UCLMs) that integrate both lookup and multiply-accumulate\nfunctionality within the same SRAM array, incurring minimal area overhead over\nstandard CIM arrays. Designed in TSMC 65nm, UCLMs can be used to concurrently\nperform exponential and matrix-vector multiplication operations. Complementing\nthe proposed architecture, HASTILY features a fine-grained pipelining strategy\nfor scheduling both attention and feed-forward layers, to reduce the quadratic\ndependence on sequence length to linear dependence. Further, for fast softmax\ncomputation which involves computing the maxima and sum of exponential values,\nsuch operations are parallelized across multiple cores using reduce and gather\nstrategy. We evaluate our proposed architecture using a compiler tailored\ntowards attention computation and a standard cycle-level CIM simulator. Our\nevaluation shows end-to-end throughput(TOPS) improvement of 4.4x-9.8x and\n1.7x-5.9x over Nvidia A40 GPU and baseline CIM hardware, respectively, for BERT\nmodels with INT-8 precision.

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the suboptimal energy efficiency of conventional digital\nprecoding schemes in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. Through an\nanalysis of the power amplifier (PA) output power distribution associated with\nconventional precoders, it is observed that these power distributions can be\nquite uneven, resulting in large PA backoff (thus low efficiency) and high\npower consumption. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel approach called\nflat precoding, which aims to control the flatness of the power distribution\nwithin a desired interval. In addition to reducing PA power consumption, flat\nprecoding offers the advantage of requiring smaller saturation levels for PAs,\nwhich reduces the size of PAs and lowers the cost. To incorporate the concept\nof flat power distribution into precoding design, we introduce a new\nlower-bound per-antenna power constraint alongside the conventional sum power\nconstraint and the upper-bound per-antenna power constraint. By adjusting the\nlower-bound and upper-bound values, we can effectively control the level of\nflatness in the power distribution. We then seek to find a flat precoder that\nsatisfies these three sets of constraints while maximizing the weighted sum\nrate (WSR). In particular, we develop efficient algorithms to design weighted\nminimum mean squared error (WMMSE) and zero-forcing (ZF)-type precoders with\ncontrollable flatness features that maximize WSR. Numerical results demonstrate\nthat complete flat precoding approaches, where the power distribution is a\nstraight line, achieve the best trade-off between spectral efficiency and\nenergy efficiency for existing PA technologies. We also show that the proposed\nZF and WMMSE precoding methods can approach the performance of their\nconventional counterparts with only the sum power constraint, while\nsignificantly reducing PA size and power consumption.",

We study this phenomenon for a class of model-free Nash\nequilibrium seeking (NES) where players implement independent stochastic\nexploration signals to learn the pseudogradient flow.

    "abstract": "Financial Sentiment Analysis (FSA) traditionally relies on human-annotated\nsentiment labels to infer investor sentiment and forecast market movements.\nHowever, inferring the potential market impact of words based on their\nhuman-perceived intentions is inherently challenging. We hypothesize that the\nhistorical market reactions to words, offer a more reliable indicator of their\npotential impact on markets than subjective sentiment interpretations by human\nannotators. To test this hypothesis, a market-derived labeling approach is\nproposed to assign tweet labels based on ensuing short-term price trends,\nenabling the language model to capture the relationship between textual signals\nand market dynamics directly. A domain-specific language model was fine-tuned\non these labels, achieving up to an 11% improvement in short-term trend\nprediction accuracy over traditional sentiment-based benchmarks. Moreover, by\nincorporating market and temporal context through prompt-tuning, the proposed\ncontext-aware language model demonstrated an accuracy of 89.6% on a curated\ndataset of 227 impactful Bitcoin-related news events with significant market\nimpacts. Aggregating daily tweet predictions into trading signals, our method\noutperformed traditional fusion models (which combine sentiment-based and\nprice-based predictions). It challenged the assumption that sentiment-based\nsignals are inferior to price-based predictions in forecasting market\nmovements. Backtesting these signals across three distinct market regimes\nyielded robust Sharpe ratios of up to 5.07 in trending markets and 3.73 in\nneutral markets. Our findings demonstrate that language models can serve as\neffective short-term market predictors. This paradigm shift underscores the\nuntapped capabilities of language models in financial decision-making and opens\nnew avenues for market prediction applications.",

This adaptation makes\nthe model dynamic, with sensitivity control to customize the balance between\nefficiency and accuracy.

Our experiments demonstrate that\nDynaMoE can generate a range of adaptive model variants of the existing trained\nLLM with a single fine-tuning step, utilizing only $10B$ tokens, a minimal cost\ncompared to the base model's training. Each variant offers distinct trade-offs\nbetween accuracy and performance.

    "abstract": "Learning for manipulation requires using policies that have access to rich\nsensory information such as point clouds or RGB images. Point clouds\nefficiently capture geometric structures, making them essential for\nmanipulation tasks in imitation learning. In contrast, RGB images provide rich\ntexture and semantic information that can be crucial for certain tasks.\nExisting approaches for fusing both modalities assign 2D image features to\npoint clouds. However, such approaches often lose global contextual information\nfrom the original images. In this work, we propose FPV-Net, a novel imitation\nlearning method that effectively combines the strengths of both point cloud and\nRGB modalities. Our method conditions the point-cloud encoder on global and\nlocal image tokens using adaptive layer norm conditioning, leveraging the\nbeneficial properties of both modalities. Through extensive experiments on the\nchallenging RoboCasa benchmark, we demonstrate the limitations of relying on\neither modality alone and show that our method achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance across all tasks.",

    "abstract": "We develop a comprehensive theoretical biophysics model grounded in a path\nintegral perspective and an m-sectorial open-system framework, to describe\ncomplex, damped viral phonon dynamics in resource limited and noise driven\nenvironments. By unifying wave mechanics (via PDEs with multiplicative noise),\nMarkov jumps for occupant or arrangement transitions, and second quantized\n(Fock-space) expansions, our construction accommodates an unbounded number of\nviral lattices in a single global wavefunction. In doing so, we capture how an\nentire population potentially numbering in the millions may be represented by a\nsingle operator theoretic state, or orbit, whose evolution is governed by\nnon-unitary semigroups with potential equilibrium or non equilibrium steady\nstates. This approach admits action functionals over the space of system\ntrajectories, enabling large deviation and flux analyses whenever detailed\nbalance is broken by sustained resource inputs, as often happens in real\ninfections.\n  Such a global wavefunction thus synthesizes PDE wavefront modes, occupant\ntransitions, and stochastically induced rearrangements into a single evolution\nequation, capturing how local capsid vibrations might catalyze large scale\nreplication bursts, and vice versa. Our proofs show that, despite unbounded\noccupant expansions or morphological continuums, solutions remain finite norm\nover finite times. The well posedness extends to non-self-adjoint operators\nwith complex damping, irreversibility, and operator-valued-noise, thus\nmirroring host constraints and immune factors that restrict virus\nproliferation.

However, empirical evidence has\nbeen limited to experiments with highly simplified artificial languages, and\nwhether these correlations arise from domain-general or language-specific\nbiases remains a matter of debate. Language models (LMs) provide an opportunity\nto study artificial language learning at a large scale and with a high degree\nof naturalism. In this paper, we begin with an in-depth discussion of how LMs\nallow us to better determine the role of domain-general learning biases in\nlanguage universals. We then assess learnability differences for LMs resulting\nfrom typologically plausible and implausible languages closely following the\nword-order universals identified by linguistic typologists. We conduct a\nsymmetrical cross-lingual study training and testing LMs on an array of highly\nnaturalistic but counterfactual versions of the English (head-initial) and\nJapanese (head-final) languages. Compared to similar work, our datasets are\nmore naturalistic and fall closer to the boundary of plausibility. Our\nexperiments show that these LMs are often slower to learn these subtly\nimplausible languages, while ultimately achieving similar performance on some\nmetrics regardless of typological plausibility. These findings lend credence to\nthe conclusion that LMs do show some typologically-aligned learning\npreferences, and that the typological patterns may result from, at least to\nsome degree, domain-general learning biases.",

The large-scale particle clustering occurs in scales which are much\nlarger than the integral scale of turbulence, and it is described in terms of\nthe effective pumping velocity in a turbulent flux of particles. We show that\nfor a fast rotating strongly anisotropic turbulence, the large-scale clustering\noccurs in the plane perpendicular to rotation axis in the direction of the\nfluid density stratification. We apply the theory of the large-scale particle\nclustering for explanation of the formation of planetesimals (progenitors of\nplanets) in accretion protoplanetary discs. We determine the radial profiles of\nthe radial and azimuthal components of the effective pumping velocity of\nparticles which have two maxima corresponding to different regimes of the\nparticle--fluid interactions: at the small radius it is the Stokes regime,\nwhile at the larger radius it is the Epstein regime. With the decrease the\nparticle radius, the distance between the maxima increases. This implies that\nsmaller-size particles are concentrated nearby the central body of the\naccretion disk, while larger-size particles are accumulated far from the\ncentral body. The dynamic time of the particle clustering is about $\\tau_{\\rm\ndyn} \\sim 10^5$--$10^6$ years, while the turbulent diffusion time is about\n$10^7$ years, that is much larger than the characteristic formation time of\nlarge-scale particle clusters ($\\sim \\tau_{\\rm dyn}$).",

Our goal is to design\nmechanisms for selling the item that make as much revenue as possible in cases\nof a correct or incorrect prediction. As a benchmark for proving our\nrevenue-approximation guarantees, we use the maximum expected revenue that can\nbe obtained by a strategic and an honest bidder. We study two mechanisms. The\nfirst one yields optimal revenue when the prediction is guaranteed to be\ncorrect and a constant revenue approximation when the prediction is incorrect,\nassuming that the agent valuations are drawn from a monotone hazard rate (MHR)\ndistribution. The second mechanism ignores the prediction for the second agent\nand simulates the revenue-optimal mechanism when no bid information for the\nbidders is available. We prove, again assuming that valuations are drawn from\nMHR distributions, that this mechanism achieves a constant revenue\napproximation guarantee compared to our revenue benchmark.

An important class of mechanism\ndesign problems that belong to this category are budget-feasible mechanisms.\nHere, the designer needs to procure services of maximum value from a set of\nagents while being on a budget, i.e., having a limited budget to enforce\ntruthfulness. However, as empirical studies suggest, factors like limited\ninformation and bounded rationality question the idealized assumption that the\nagents behave perfectly rationally. Motivated by this, Troyan and Morill in\n2022 introduced non-obvious manipulability (NOM) as a more lenient incentive\ncompatibility notion. In this paper, we investigate whether resorting to NOM\nenables us to derive improved mechanisms in budget-feasible domains. We\nestablish a tight bound of 2 on the approximation guarantee of budget-feasible\nmechanisms satisfying NOM for the general class of monotone subadditive\nvaluation functions. Our result thus establishes a clear separation between the\nachievable guarantees for DSIC (perfectly rational agents) and NOM (imperfectly\nrational agents) as no truthful mechanism can achieve a guarantee better than\n2.41. Along the way, we fully characterize BNOM and WNOM (which together form\nNOM) and derive matching upper and lower bounds, respectively. Conceptually,\nour characterization results suggest \"Golden Tickets\" and \"Wooden Spoons\" as\nnatural means to realize BNOM and WNOM, respectively. Additionally, we show\nthat randomized budget-feasible mechanisms satisfying BNOM can achieve an\nexpected approximation ratio arbitrarily close to 1.",

In\nthe constrained setting, we make assumptions about model architecture and\ntraining and propose a family of statistical tests that yield exact p-values\nwith respect to the null hypothesis that the models are trained from\nindependent random initializations. These p-values are valid regardless of the\ncomposition of either model's training data; we compute them by simulating\nexchangeable copies of each model under our assumptions and comparing various\nsimilarity measures of weights and activations between the original two models\nversus these copies. We report the p-values from these tests on pairs of 21\nopen-weight models (210 total pairs) and correctly identify all pairs of\nnon-independent models. Our tests remain effective even if one model was\nfine-tuned for many tokens. In the unconstrained setting, where we make no\nassumptions about training procedures, can change model architecture, and allow\nfor adversarial evasion attacks, the previous tests no longer work. Instead, we\npropose a new test which matches hidden activations between two models, and\nwhich is robust to adversarial transformations and to changes in model\narchitecture. The test can also do localized testing: identifying specific\nnon-independent components of models.

In this paper, we systematically study\nthe generalisation of this problem to a given forbidden family of colourings of\n$K_k$. This problem typically exhibits a dichotomy whereby for some values of\n$s$, the extremal graph is the `trivial' one, namely the Tur\\'an graph on $k-1$\nparts, with no copies of $K_k$; while for others, this graph is no longer\nextremal and determining the extremal graph becomes much harder.\n  We generalise a framework developed for the monochromatic\nErd\\H{o}s-Rothschild problem to the general setting and work in this framework\nto obtain our main results, which concern two specific forbidden families:\ntriangles with exactly two colours, and improperly coloured cliques. We\nessentially solve these problems fully for all integers $s \\geq 2$ and large\n$n$. In both cases we obtain an infinite family of structures which are\nextremal for some $s$, which are the first results of this kind.\n  A consequence of our results is that for every non-monochromatic colour\npattern, every extremal graph is complete partite.

    "abstract": "Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) has been a go-to and effective method for\nenhancing long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning in relatively small LLMs by\nfine-tuning them with long CoT responses from larger LLMs. To continually\nimprove reasoning abilities, we can either collect new high-quality long CoT\nreasoning SFT data or repeatedly train on existing SFT datasets. However,\nacquiring new long CoT SFT data is costly and limited, while repeated training\noften results in a performance plateau or decline. To further boost the\nperformance with the SFT data, we propose Thinking Preference Optimization\n(ThinkPO), a simple yet effective post-SFT method that enhances long CoT\nreasoning without requiring new long CoT responses. Instead, ThinkPO utilizes\nreadily available or easily obtainable short CoT reasoning responses as\nrejected answers and long CoT responses as chosen answers for the same\nquestion. It then applies direct preference optimization to encourage the model\nto favor longer reasoning outputs. Experiments show that ThinkPO further\nimproves the reasoning performance of SFT-ed models, e.g. it increases math\nreasoning accuracy of SFT-ed models by 8.6% and output length by 25.9%.\nNotably, ThinkPO is capable of continually boosting the performance of the\npublicly distilled SFT model, e.g., increasing the official\nDeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B's performance on MATH500 from 87.4% to 91.2%.",

Here, we consider a VI-EH\nsystem that consists of an inclined cylindrical capsule that is externally\nforced and a bullet that is allowed to move inside the capsule, and analyze its\ndynamics under the presence of dry friction. Dry friction introduces a\nswitching manifold corresponding to zero relative velocity where the bullet\nsticks to the capsule, appearing as sliding in the model. We identify\nanalytical conditions for the occurrence of non-stick and sliding motions, and\nconstruct a series of nonlinear maps that capture model solutions and their\ndynamics on the switching and impacting manifolds. An interplay of smooth\n(period-doubling) and non-smooth (grazing) bifurcations characterizes the\ntransition from periodic solutions with alternating impacts to solutions with\nan additional impact on one end of the capsule per period. This transition is\npreceded by a sequence of grazing-sliding, switching-sliding and\ncrossing-sliding bifurcations on the switching manifold that may reverse period\ndoubling bifurcations for larger values of the dry friction coefficient. In\ngeneral, a larger dry friction coefficient also results in larger sliding\nintervals, lower impact velocities yielding lower average energy outputs, and a\nshift in the location of some bifurcations. Surprisingly, we identify parameter\nregimes in which higher dry friction maintains higher energy output levels, as\nit shifts the location of grazing bifurcations.",

However, purely\ninformation-theoretic measures fail to capture the actual computational\ncomplexity involved in performing certain tasks. In this work, we rigorously\naddress this issue within the realm of entanglement theory, a cornerstone of\nquantum information science. We consider two key figures of merit: the\ncomputational distillable entanglement and the computational entanglement cost,\nquantifying the optimal rate of entangled bits (ebits) that can be extracted\nfrom or used to dilute many identical copies of $n$-qubit bipartite pure\nstates, using computationally efficient local operations and classical\ncommunication (LOCC). We demonstrate that computational entanglement measures\ndiverge significantly from their information-theoretic counterparts. While the\nvon Neumann entropy captures information-theoretic rates for pure-state\ntransformations, we show that under computational constraints, the min-entropy\ninstead governs optimal entanglement distillation. Meanwhile, efficient\nentanglement dilution incurs in a major cost, requiring maximal\n$(\\tilde{\\Omega}(n))$ ebits even for nearly unentangled states. Surprisingly,\nin the worst-case scenario, even if an efficient description of the state\nexists and is fully known, one gains no advantage over state-agnostic\nprotocols. Our results establish a stark, maximal separation of\n$\\tilde{\\Omega}(n)$ vs. $o(1)$ between computational and information-theoretic\nentanglement measures.

Using this idea, we\ndiscovered imaginary quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) in NICER observations\nof the black hole candidate MAXI J1820+070. The imaginary QPOs appear as narrow\nfeatures with a small Real and large Imaginary part in the CS but are not\nsignificantly detected in the PS when they overlap in frequency with other\nvariability components. The coherence function drops and the phase lags\nincrease abruptly at the frequency of the imaginary QPO. We show that the\nmulti-Lorentzian model that fits the PS and CS of the source in two energy\nbands correctly reproduces the lags and the coherence, and that the narrow drop\nof the coherence is caused by the interaction of the imaginary QPO with other\nvariability components. The imaginary QPO appears only in the decay of the\noutburst, during the transition from the high-soft to the low-hard state of\nMAXI J1820+070, and its frequency decreases from approximately 5 Hz to around 1\nHz as the source spectrum hardens. We also analysed the earlier observations of\nthe transition, where no narrow features were seen, and we identified a QPO in\nthe PS that appears to evolve into the imaginary QPO as the source hardens. As\nfor the type-B and C QPOs in this source, the rms spectrum of the imaginary QPO\nincreases with energy. The lags of the imaginary QPO are similar to those of\nthe type-B and C QPOs above 2 keV but differ from the lags of those other QPOs\nbelow that energy. While the properties of this imaginary QPO resemble those of\ntype-C QPOs, we cannot rule out that it is a new type of QPO.",

    "abstract": "Problem: How can we design patient cost prediction models that effectively\naddress the challenges of heterogeneity in administrative claims (AC) data to\nensure accurate, fair, and generalizable predictions, especially for high-need\n(HN) patients with complex chronic conditions?\n  Relevance: Accurate and equitable patient cost predictions are vital for\ndeveloping health management policies and optimizing resource allocation, which\ncan lead to significant cost savings for healthcare payers, including\ngovernment agencies and private insurers. Addressing disparities in prediction\noutcomes for HN patients ensures better economic and clinical decision-making,\nbenefiting both patients and payers.\n  Methodology: This study is grounded in socio-technical considerations that\nemphasize the interplay between technical systems (e.g., deep learning models)\nand humanistic outcomes (e.g., fairness in healthcare decisions). It\nincorporates representation learning and entropy measurement to address\nheterogeneity and complexity in data and patient profiles, particularly for HN\npatients. We propose a channel-wise deep learning framework that mitigates data\nheterogeneity by segmenting AC data into separate channels based on types of\ncodes (e.g., diagnosis, procedures) and costs. This approach is paired with a\nflexible evaluation design that uses multi-channel entropy measurement to\nassess patient heterogeneity.\n  Results: The proposed channel-wise models reduce prediction errors by 23%\ncompared to single-channel models, leading to 16.4% and 19.3% reductions in\noverpayments and underpayments, respectively. Notably, the reduction in\nprediction bias is significantly higher for HN patients, demonstrating\neffectiveness in handling heterogeneity and complexity in data and patient\nprofiles. This demonstrates the potential for applying channel-wise modeling to\ndomains with similar heterogeneity challenges.",

We proved that $V_g^{T}(l)$ admits an asymptotic expansion\nin powers of $1/g$. We introduced a new class of functions, called\nFriedman-Ramanujan functions, and related it to the study of the spectral gap\n$\\lambda_1$ of the Laplacian.\n  In this second part, we provide a variety of new tools allowing to compute\nand estimate the volume functions $V_g^{T}(l)$. Notably, we construct new sets\nof coordinates on Teichm\\\"uller spaces, distinct from Fenchel-Nielsen\ncoordinates, in which the Weil-Petersson volume has a simple form. These\ncoordinates are tailored to the geodesics we study, and we can therefore prove\nnice formulae for their lengths. We use these new ideas, together with a notion\nof pseudo-convolutions, to prove that the coefficients of the expansion of\n$V_g^{T}(l)$ in powers of $1/g$ are Friedman-Ramanujan functions, for any local\ntopological type $T$. We then exploit this result to prove that, for any\n$\\epsilon>0$, $\\lambda_1 \\geq \\frac14 - \\epsilon$ with probability going to one\nas $g \\rightarrow + \\infty$, or, in other words, typical hyperbolic surfaces\nhave an asymptotically optimal spectral gap.",

In this\nwork, we investigate non-perturbative overlaps in Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT)\ngravity to uncover universal signatures of quantum chaos and quantum\ncomplexity. Taking advantage of universal spectral correlators from random\nmatrix theory, we compute the overlaps between the thermofield double (TFD)\nstate and two distinct classes of states: fixed-length states, which encode\nmaximal volume slices, and time-shifted TFD states. The squared overlaps\nnaturally define probability distributions that quantify the expectation values\nof gravitational observables. Central to our results is the introduction of\ngenerating functions for quantum complexity measures, such as $\\langle\ne^{-\\alpha \\ell} \\rangle$. The time evolution of these generating functions\nexhibits the universal slope-ramp-plateau structure, mirroring the behavior of\nthe spectral form factor (SFF). Using generating functions, we further\ndemonstrate that the universal time evolution of complexity for chaotic\nsystems, which is characterized by a linear growth followed by a late-time\nplateau, arises from the disappearance of the linear ramp as the regularization\nparameter $\\alpha$ decreases. With regard to the time-shifted TFD state, we\nderive a surprising result: the expectation value of the time shift, which\nclassically grows linearly, vanishes when non-perturbative quantum corrections\nare incorporated.

Using a\nBayesian interpolation framework, we constrain Galactic RM fluctuations below ~\n1 degree squared angular scales around the FRB positions. Despite the positions\nof all eight FRBs far from the Galactic plane, we constrain previously\nunresolved small-scale Galactic RM structures around six of the eight FRBs. In\ntwo of these fields, we find potential changes in the sign of the Galactic RM\nthat are not captured by previous, sparsely sampled RM grid observations. Our\nGalactic RM estimate towards the FRBs differs between a few rad m^-2 up to ~ 40\nrad m^-2 from the all-sky Galactic RM map of Hutschenreuter et al. (2022).\nExtrapolating our results to the known population of polarized FRB sources, we\nmay be incorrectly interpreting the host galaxy RM for ~ 30% of the FRB source\npopulation with current RM grid observations. Measuring small-scale Galactic RM\nvariations is crucial for identifying FRBs in low density and weakly magnetized\nenvironments, which in turn could serve as potent probes of cosmic magnetism.\nThis framework of reconstructing continuous Galactic RM structure from RM grid\nobservations can be readily applied to FRBs that fall in the sky coverage of\nupcoming large-sky radio polarization surveys of radio galaxies, such as the\nVery Large Array Sky Survey (VLASS) and the Polarization Sky Survey of the\nUniverse's Magnetism (POSSUM).",

    "abstract": "Transit spectroscopy usually relies on the integration of one or several\ntransits to achieve the S/N necessary to resolve spectral features.\nConsequently, high-S/N observations of exoplanet atmospheres are essential for\ndisentangling the complex chemistry and dynamics beyond global trends. In this\nstudy, we combined two partial 4-UT transits of the ultrahot Jupiter WASP-121\nb, observed with the ESPRESSO at the VLT in order to revisit its titanium\nchemistry. Through cross-correlation analysis, we achieved detections of H I,\nLi I, Na I, K I, Mg I, Ca I, Ti I, V I, Cr I, Mn I, Fe I, Fe II, Co I, Ni I, Ba\nII, Sr I, and Sr II. Additionally, narrow-band spectroscopy allowed us to\nresolve strong single lines, resulting in significant detections of H$\\alpha$,\nH$\\beta$, H$\\gamma$, Li I, Na I, K I, Mg I, Ca II, Sr I, Sr II, and Mn I. Our\nmost notable finding is the high-significance detection of Ti I ($\\sim$\n5$\\sigma$ per spectrum, and $\\sim$ 19$\\sigma$ stacked in the planetary rest\nframe). Comparison with atmospheric models reveals that Ti I is indeed depleted\ncompared to V I. We also resolve the planetary velocity traces of both Ti I and\nV I, with Ti I exhibiting a significant blueshift toward the end of the\ntransit. This suggests that Ti I primarily originates from low-latitude regions\nwithin the super-rotating jet observed in WASP-121 b. Our observations suggest\nlimited mixing between the equatorial jet and the mid-latitudes, in contrast\nwith model predictions from GCMs. We also report the non-detection of TiO,\nwhich we attribute to inaccuracies in the line list that could hinder its\ndetection, even if present. Thus, the final determination of the presence of\nTiO must await space-based observations. We conclude that the 4-UT mode of\nESPRESSO is an excellent testbed for achieving high S/N on relatively faint\ntargets, paving the way for future observations with the ELT.",

To address this, we must observe the\n3D structure of these atmospheres, particularly their vertical circulation\npatterns, which can serve as a testbed for advanced Global Circulation Models\n(GCM) [e.g. 1]. Here, we show a dramatic shift in atmospheric circulation in an\nultra-hot Jupiter: a unilateral flow from the hot star-facing side to the\ncooler space-facing side of the planet sits below an equatorial\nsuper-rotational jet stream. By resolving the vertical structure of atmospheric\ndynamics, we move beyond integrated global snapshots of the atmosphere,\nenabling more accurate identification of flow patterns and allowing for a more\nnuanced comparison to models. Global circulation models based on first\nprinciples struggle to replicate the observed circulation pattern [3],\nunderscoring a critical gap between theoretical understanding of atmospheric\nflows and observational evidence.

Current chatbots, driven by large language models (LLMs),\nmimic human linguistic behaviour but lack the moral and rational capacities\nessential for genuine interpersonal respect. Human beings are prone to\nanthropomorphise chatbots. Indeed, chatbots appear to be deliberately designed\nto elicit that response. As a result, human beings' behaviour toward chatbots\noften resembles behaviours typical of interaction between moral agents. Drawing\non a second-personal, relational account of dignity, we argue that interacting\nwith chatbots in this way is incompatible with the dignity of users. We show\nthat, since second-personal respect is premised on reciprocal recognition of\nsecond-personal authority, behaving towards chatbots in ways that convey\nsecond-personal respect is bound to misfire in morally problematic ways, given\nthe lack of reciprocity. Consequently, such chatbot interactions amount to\nsubtle but significant violations of self-respect: the respect we are dutybound\nto show for our own dignity. We illustrate this by discussing four actual\nchatbot use cases (information retrieval, customer service, advising, and\ncompanionship), and propound that the increasing societal pressure to engage in\nsuch interactions with chatbots poses a hitherto underappreciated threat to\nhuman dignity.",

We\nidentify GMCs in simulated galaxies and track their evolution using cloud\nevolution trees. Via cloud evolution trees, we quantify the lifetimes and SFE\nof GMCs. We further apply our diagnostics on a suite of simulations with\nvarying star formation and stellar feedback subgrid models and explore their\nimpact together with galactic environments to the GMC life cycles. Our analysis\nreveals that GMCs undergo dynamic evolution, characterized by continuous gas\naccretion, gravitational collapse, and star formation, followed by disruption\ndue to stellar feedback. The accretion process sustains the gas content\nthroughout most of the GMC life cycles, resulting in a positive correlation\nbetween GMC lifetimes and their maximum masses. The GMC lifetimes range from a\nfew to several tens of Myr, with two distinct dynamical modes: (1) GMCs near\nthe galactic center experience strong tidal disturbances, prolonging their\nlifetimes when they remain marginally unbound; (2) those in the outer regions\nare less affected by tides, remain gravitationally bound, and evolve more\nrapidly. In all model variations, we observe that GMC-scale SFE correlates with\nthe baryonic surface density of GMCs, consistent with previous studies of\nisolated GMCs. Additionally, we emphasize the critical role of galactic shear\nin regulating GMC-scale star formation and refine the correlation between local\nSFE and surface density by including its effects.

This result can be applied to any\nconformally coupled theory, weakly or strongly interacting, unifying previous\nderivations for fields of different spin and for scalar and tensor\nperturbations. We derive the results using the Schwinger method of 1PI\neffective action and through Bogoliubov transformations that allows to compute\nexclusive information on the distribution of particles. We then apply these\nresults to stochastic backgrounds of scalar and tensor perturbations that can\nbe generated by various phenomena such us inflationary perturbations and first\norder phase transitions.

Through the\nanalysis of high angular resolution and multi-wavelength data obtained from\nadaptive optics corrected and space observations, we built deep, optical and\nnear-infrared color-magnitude diagrams reaching $\\approx 4$ magnitudes below\nthe main-sequence turnoff. Taking advantage of 4 different epochs of\nobservations, we measured precise relative proper motions for a large sample of\nstars, from which cluster members have been solidly distinguished from Galactic\nfield interlopers. A non-canonical reddening law (with $R_V=2.85$) and\nhigh-resolution differential reddening map, with color excess variations up to\n$\\delta E(B-V) \\approx 0.8 $ mag, have been derived in the direction of the\nsystem. According to these findings, new values of the extinction and distance\nmodulus have been obtained: respectively, $E(B-V)=2.36\\pm0.05$ and\n$(m-M)_0=14.46 \\pm 0.10$ (corresponding to $d=7.8 \\pm 0.3$ kpc). We also\nprovide the first determinations of the cluster center and projected density\nprofile from resolved star counts. The center is offset by more than $7$ arcsec\nto the east from the literature value, and the structural parameters obtained\nfrom the King model fitting to the density profile indicate that Terzan 6 is in\nan advanced stage of its dynamical evolution. We also determined the absolute\nage of the system, finding $t=13\\pm 1 $ Gyr, in agreement with the old ages\nfound for the globular clusters in the Galactic bulge. From the\nre-determination of the absolute magnitude of the red giant branch bump and the\nrecent estimate of the cluster global metallicity, we find that Terzan 6 nicely\nmatches the tight relation between these two parameters drawn by the Galactic\nglobular cluster population.",

Current prediction\nmethods are limited by training and storage efficiency, mainly focusing on 2D\nspatial predictions at specific altitudes. Meanwhile, 3D volumetric predictions\nat each timestamp remain largely unexplored. To address such a challenge, we\nintroduce a comprehensive framework for 3D radar sequence prediction in weather\nnowcasting, using the newly proposed SpatioTemporal Coherent Gaussian Splatting\n(STC-GS) for dynamic radar representation and GauMamba for efficient and\naccurate forecasting. Specifically, rather than relying on a 4D Gaussian for\ndynamic scene reconstruction, STC-GS optimizes 3D scenes at each frame by\nemploying a group of Gaussians while effectively capturing their movements\nacross consecutive frames. It ensures consistent tracking of each Gaussian over\ntime, making it particularly effective for prediction tasks. With the\ntemporally correlated Gaussian groups established, we utilize them to train\nGauMamba, which integrates a memory mechanism into the Mamba framework. This\nallows the model to learn the temporal evolution of Gaussian groups while\nefficiently handling a large volume of Gaussian tokens. As a result, it\nachieves both efficiency and accuracy in forecasting a wide range of dynamic\nmeteorological radar signals. The experimental results demonstrate that our\nSTC-GS can efficiently represent 3D radar sequences with over $16\\times$ higher\nspatial resolution compared with the existing 3D representation methods, while\nGauMamba outperforms state-of-the-art methods in forecasting a broad spectrum\nof high-dynamic weather conditions.",

    "abstract": "The remarkable sensitivity achieved by the planned Laser Interferometer Space\nAntenna (LISA) will allow us to observe gravitational-wave signals from the\nmergers of massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) with signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)\nin the hundreds, or even thousands. At such high SNR, our ability to precisely\ninfer the parameters of an MBHB from the detected signal will be limited by the\naccuracy of the waveform templates we use. In this paper, we explore the\nsystematic biases that arise in parameter estimation if we use waveform\ntemplates that do not model radiation in higher-order multipoles. This is an\nimportant consideration for the large fraction of high-mass events expected to\nbe observed with LISA. We examine how the biases change for MBHB events with\ndifferent total masses, mass ratios, and inclination angles. We find that\nsystematic biases due to insufficient mode content are severe for events with\ntotal redshifted mass $\\gtrsim10^6\\,M_\\odot$. We then compare several methods\nof predicting such systematic biases without performing a full Bayesian\nparameter estimation. In particular, we show that through direct likelihood\noptimization it is possible to predict systematic biases with remarkable\ncomputational efficiency and accuracy. Finally, we devise a method to construct\napproximate waveforms including angular multipoles with $\\ell\\geq5$ to better\nunderstand how many additional modes (beyond the ones available in current\napproximants) might be required to perform unbiased parameter estimation on the\nMBHB signals detected by LISA.",

We\naim to estimate the binary fraction of a large sample of BSGs in the Small\nMagellanic Cloud within the Binarity at LOw Metallicity (BLOeM) survey. In\ntotal, we selected 262 targets with spectral types B0-B3 and luminosity classes\nI-II.

Our spectroscopic analysis for each target includes the\nindividual and peak-to-peak radial velocity measurements, an investigation of\nthe line profile variability, and a periodogram analysis to search for possible\nshort- and long-period binaries. By applying a 20 km s$^{-1}$ threshold on the\npeak-to-peak radial velocities above which we would consider the star to be\nbinary, the resulting observed spectroscopic binary fraction for our BSG sample\nis 23 $\\pm$ 3$\\%$. In addition, we derived reliable orbital periods for 41\nspectroscopic binaries and potential binary candidates, among which there are\n17 eclipsing binaries, including 20 SB1 and SB2 systems with periods of less\nthan 10 days. We reported a significant drop in the binary fraction of BSGs\nwith spectral types later than B2 and effective temperatures less than 18 kK,\nwhich could indicate the end of the main sequence phase in this temperature\nregime.

Accurate modelling of atmospheric processes is essential to\ninterpreting high-precision spectroscopic data given the wide range of possible\nconditions in the sub-Neptune regime, including on potentially habitable\nplanets. Notably, convection is an important process which can operate in\ndifferent modes across sub-Neptune conditions. Convection can act very\ndifferently in atmospheres with a high condensible mass fraction (non-dilute\natmospheres) or with a lighter background gas, e.g. water convection in a\nH$_2$-rich atmosphere, and can be much weaker or even shut down entirely in the\nlatter case. We present a new mass-flux scheme which can capture these\nvariations and simulate convection over a wide range of parameter space for use\nin 3D general circulation models (GCMs). We validate our scheme for two\nrepresentative cases, a terrestrial-like atmosphere and a mini-Neptune\natmosphere. In the terrestrial case, considering TRAPPIST-1e with an Earth-like\natmosphere, the model performs near-identically to Earth-tuned models in an\nEarth-like convection case. In the mini-Neptune case, considering the bulk\nproperties of K2-18b and assuming a deep H$_2$-rich atmosphere, we demonstrate\nthe capability of the scheme to reproduce non-condensing convection. We find\nconvection occurring at pressures greater than 0.3 bar and the dynamical\nstructure shows high-latitude prograde jets.

    "abstract": "Automatic fall recovery is a crucial prerequisite before humanoid robots can\nbe reliably deployed. Hand-designing controllers for getting up is difficult\nbecause of the varied configurations a humanoid can end up in after a fall and\nthe challenging terrains humanoid robots are expected to operate on. This paper\ndevelops a learning framework to produce controllers that enable humanoid\nrobots to get up from varying configurations on varying terrains. Unlike\nprevious successful applications of learning to humanoid locomotion, the\ngetting-up task involves complex contact patterns (which necessitates\naccurately modeling of the collision geometry) and sparser rewards. We address\nthese challenges through a two-phase approach that induces a curriculum. The\nfirst stage focuses on discovering a good getting-up trajectory under minimal\nconstraints on smoothness or speed / torque limits. The second stage then\nrefines the discovered motions into deployable (i.e. smooth and slow) motions\nthat are robust to variations in initial configuration and terrains. We find\nthese innovations enable a real-world G1 humanoid robot to get up from two main\nsituations that we considered: a) lying face up and b) lying face down, both\ntested on flat, deformable, slippery surfaces and slopes (e.g., sloppy grass\nand snowfield). This is one of the first successful demonstrations of learned\ngetting-up policies for human-sized humanoid robots in the real world.",

    "abstract": "3D volumetric video provides immersive experience and is gaining traction in\ndigital media. Despite its rising popularity, the streaming of volumetric video\ncontent poses significant challenges due to the high data bandwidth\nrequirement. A natural approach to mitigate the bandwidth issue is to reduce\nthe volumetric video's data rate by downsampling the content prior to\ntransmission. The video can then be upsampled at the receiver's end using a\nsuper-resolution (SR) algorithm to reconstruct the high-resolution details.\nWhile super-resolution techniques have been extensively explored and advanced\nfor 2D video content, there is limited work on SR algorithms tailored for\nvolumetric videos.\n  To address this gap and the growing need for efficient volumetric video\nstreaming, we have developed VoLUT with a new SR algorithm specifically\ndesigned for volumetric content. Our algorithm uniquely harnesses the power of\nlookup tables (LUTs) to facilitate the efficient and accurate upscaling of\nlow-resolution volumetric data. The use of LUTs enables our algorithm to\nquickly reference precomputed high-resolution values, thereby significantly\nreducing the computational complexity and time required for upscaling. We\nfurther apply adaptive video bit rate algorithm (ABR) to dynamically determine\nthe downsampling rate according to the network condition and stream the\nselected video rate to the receiver. Compared to related work, VoLUT is the\nfirst to enable high-quality 3D SR on commodity mobile devices at line-rate.\nOur evaluation shows VoLUT can reduce bandwidth usage by 70% , boost QoE by\n36.7% for volumetric video streaming and achieve\n  3D SR speed-up with no quality compromise.",

However, the quality of articles on less-known entities\noften lags behind that of the well-known ones. This study proposes a novel\napproach to enhancing Wikipedia's B and C category biography articles by\nleveraging personal narratives such as autobiographies and biographies. By\nutilizing a multi-staged retrieval-augmented generation technique -- REVerSum\n-- we aim to enrich the informational content of these lesser-known articles.\nOur study reveals that personal narratives can significantly improve the\nquality of Wikipedia articles, providing a rich source of reliable information\nthat has been underutilized in previous studies.

However, LLMs still struggle with problems\nrequiring multi-step decision-making and environmental feedback, such as online\nshopping, scientific reasoning, and mathematical problem-solving. Unlike pure\ntext data, collecting large-scale decision-making data is challenging.\nMoreover, many powerful LLMs are only accessible through APIs, which hinders\ntheir fine-tuning for agent tasks due to cost and complexity. To address LLM\nagents' limitations, we propose a framework that can automatically learn a\nreward model from the environment without human annotations. This model can be\nused to evaluate the action trajectories of LLM agents and provide heuristics\nfor task planning. Specifically, our approach involves employing one LLM-based\nagent to navigate an environment randomly, generating diverse action\ntrajectories. Subsequently, a separate LLM is leveraged to assign a task intent\nand synthesize a negative response alongside the correct response for each\ntrajectory. These triplets (task intent, positive response, and negative\nresponse) are then utilized as training data to optimize a reward model capable\nof scoring action trajectories. The effectiveness and generalizability of our\nframework are demonstrated through evaluations conducted on different agent\nbenchmarks. In conclusion, our proposed framework represents a significant\nadvancement in enhancing LLM agents' decision-making capabilities.

In order to identify the master functions we introduce a\nbipartite Mellin-Barnes representation by means of splitting a given conformal\nintegral into two additive parts, one of which can be evaluated explicitly in\nterms of multivariate generalized hypergeometric series.\n  For the box and pentagon integrals (i.e. $n=4,5$) we show that a computable\npart of the bipartite representation contains all master functions. In\nparticular, this allows us to evaluate the parametric pentagon integral as a\nsum of ten basis functions generated from two master functions by the cyclic\ngroup $\\mathbb{Z}_5$. The resulting expression can be tested in two ways.\nFirst, when one of propagator powers is set to zero, the pentagon integral is\nreduced to the known box integral, which is also rederived through the\nreconstruction procedure.

The proposed method\nachieves strong performance with improved calibration and generalization while\nmaintaining computational efficiency. Our empirical findings show that, with\nthe appropriate projection of the weight space: (1) uncertainty can be\neffectively modeled in a low-dimensional space, and (2) weight covariances\nexhibit low ranks.",

In this work, we\nleverage a vision transformer neural network trained on conductance\nmeasurements along with a CMA-ES optimization framework to dynamically tune\ngate voltages mitigating disorder effects.

    "abstract": "Despite substantial advances in scaling test-time compute, an ongoing debate\nin the community is how it should be scaled up to enable continued and\nefficient improvements with scaling. There are largely two approaches: first,\ndistilling successful search or thinking traces; and second, using verification\n(e.g., 0/1 outcome rewards, reward models, or verifiers) to guide reinforcement\nlearning (RL) and search algorithms. In this paper, we prove that finetuning\nLLMs with verifier-based (VB) methods based on RL or search is far superior to\nverifier-free (VF) approaches based on distilling or cloning search traces,\ngiven a fixed amount of compute/data budget. Further, we show that as we scale\ntest-time compute (measured as the output token length) and training data,\nsuboptimality of VF methods scales poorly compared to VB when the base\npre-trained LLM presents a heterogeneous distribution over correct solution\ntraces (e.g., different lengths, styles, etc.) and admits a non-sharp\ndistribution over rewards on traces sampled from it. We formalize this\ncondition using anti-concentration [Erd\\H{o}s, 1945]. This implies a stronger\nresult that VB methods scale better asymptotically, with the performance gap\nbetween VB and VF methods widening as test-time budget grows. We corroborate\nour theory empirically on both didactic and math reasoning problems with\n3/8/32B-sized pre-trained LLMs, where we find verification is crucial for\nscaling test-time compute.",

Recent advances in machine learning and\ngenerative AI make this strategy increasingly viable by enabling the\ncost-effective identification of high-quality bidders. However, the practice\ndeparts from classic auction theory, which usually favors broad competition\nover selective exclusion. In this paper, we examine whether and under what\nconditions bidder prescreening can be justified. We analyze a setting in which\nbidders have independent and identically distributed private valuations, and\nthe seller observes noisy signals generated by a valuation predictor. The\nseller determines how many top bidders to admit and, after receiving signals,\nselects exactly that many with the highest signal-based rankings. We\ndemonstrate that an auction with prescreening is equivalent to a standard\nauction (i.e., without prescreening) but with correlated valuations. Our\nanalysis shows that, although admitting fewer bidders leads to revenue losses\nin both second-price and first-price auctions, a more accurate predictor can\nmitigate or even fully offset these losses. In contrast, prescreening can\nsignificantly boost revenue in all-pay auctions; notably, when the predictor is\nperfect, admitting only two bidders is optimal.

Current memory systems enable basic storage and\nretrieval but lack sophisticated memory organization, despite recent attempts\nto incorporate graph databases. Moreover, these systems' fixed operations and\nstructures limit their adaptability across diverse tasks. To address this\nlimitation, this paper proposes a novel agentic memory system for LLM agents\nthat can dynamically organize memories in an agentic way. Following the basic\nprinciples of the Zettelkasten method, we designed our memory system to create\ninterconnected knowledge networks through dynamic indexing and linking. When a\nnew memory is added, we generate a comprehensive note containing multiple\nstructured attributes, including contextual descriptions, keywords, and tags.\nThe system then analyzes historical memories to identify relevant connections,\nestablishing links where meaningful similarities exist. Additionally, this\nprocess enables memory evolution - as new memories are integrated, they can\ntrigger updates to the contextual representations and attributes of existing\nhistorical memories, allowing the memory network to continuously refine its\nunderstanding. Our approach combines the structured organization principles of\nZettelkasten with the flexibility of agent-driven decision making, allowing for\nmore adaptive and context-aware memory management.

Additionally,\ngrounded in psychometric research, we have summarized an evaluation framework\nto systematically validate LLM-generated psychometric data. Results from three\nexperiments demonstrate that well-designed structured interviews could improve\nhuman-like heterogeneity in LLM-simulated personality data and predict\npersonality-related behavioral outcomes (i.e., organizational citizenship\nbehaviors and counterproductive work behavior). We further discuss the role of\ntheory-informed structured interviews in LLM-based simulation and outline a\ngeneral framework for designing structured interviews to simulate human-like\ndata for psychometric research.",

We need to understand the spin evolution of massive stars to compute\ntheir internal rotationally induced mixing processes, isolate effects of close\nbinary evolution, and predict the rotation rates of white dwarfs, neutron stars\nand black holes.\n  Aims. We discuss the spindown of massive main sequence stars imposed by\nstellar winds.\n  Methods. We use detailed grids of single star evolutionary models to predict\nthe distribution of the surface rotational velocities of core-hydrogen burning\nGalactic massive stars as function of their mass and evolutionary state. We\nthen compare the spin properties of our synthetic populations with\nappropriately selected sub-samples of Galactic main sequence OB-type stars\nextracted from the IACOB survey.\n  Results. We find that below $\\sim 40 M_\\odot$, observations and models agree\nin finding that the surface rotational velocities of Galactic massive stars\nremain relatively constant during their main sequence evolution. The more\nmassive stars in the IACOB sample appear to spin down less than predicted,\nwhile our updated angular momentum loss prescription predicts an enhanced\nspindown. Furthermore, the observations show a population of fast rotators,\nwith $v \\sin I \\gtrsim 200$ km/s persisting for all ages, which is not\nreproduced by our synthetic single star populations.\n  Conclusions.

The density operator elements of the\nQDD system are expressed in terms of expectation values involving various\ncombinations of the fermionic creation and annihilation operators associated\nwith the system.

In human\nsociety, relationships such as teacher-student, parent-child, neighbors,\nsiblings, or employer-employee are governed by specific norms that prescribe or\nproscribe cooperative functions including hierarchy, care, transaction, and\nmating. These norms shape our judgments of what is appropriate for each\npartner. For example, workplace norms may allow a boss to give orders to an\nemployee, but not vice versa, reflecting hierarchical and transactional\nexpectations. As AI agents and chatbots powered by large language models are\nincreasingly designed to serve roles analogous to human positions - such as\nassistant, mental health provider, tutor, or romantic partner - it is\nimperative to examine whether and how human relational norms should extend to\nhuman-AI interactions. Our analysis explores how differences between AI systems\nand humans, such as the absence of conscious experience and immunity to\nfatigue, may affect an AI's capacity to fulfill relationship-specific functions\nand adhere to corresponding norms. This analysis, which is a collaborative\neffort by philosophers, psychologists, relationship scientists, ethicists,\nlegal experts, and AI researchers, carries important implications for AI\nsystems design, user behavior, and regulation. While we accept that AI systems\ncan offer significant benefits such as increased availability and consistency\nin certain socio-relational roles, they also risk fostering unhealthy\ndependencies or unrealistic expectations that could spill over into human-human\nrelationships. We propose that understanding and thoughtfully shaping (or\nimplementing) suitable human-AI relational norms will be crucial for ensuring\nthat human-AI interactions are ethical, trustworthy, and favorable to human\nwell-being.",

Numerical solutions spanning scales from parsecs down to ~\n10 r_s reveal that the flow structure is highly sensitive to the mass and size\nof the dark matter halo. Adding a small amount of angular momentum to the\naccreting gas demonstrates that such flows resemble spherical Bondi accretion,\nwith mass accretion rates converging toward the Bondi rate. We find that the\nlow angular momentum flow resembles the spherical Bondi flow, and its mass\naccretion rate approaches the Bondi accretion rate. Remarkably, due to the\npresence of dark matter, the mass accretion rate increases by more than ~ %100\ncompared to analogous hydrodynamic solutions without dark matter.

Indeed, in such systems\nvorticity is supported by the singularities of the phase of the scalar field,\nwhich leads to a discrete set of quantized vortices amid a curl-free velocity\nbackground.

Using numerical simulations in the Thomas-Fermi regime, with\nstochastic initial conditions for a spherical halo with a specific averaged\ndensity profile and angular momentum, we find that a rotating soliton always\nemerges dynamically, within a few dynamical times, and that a network of vortex\nlines aligned with the total spin fills its oblate profile.

TokCom is a new paradigm, motivated\nby the recent success of generative foundation models and multimodal large\nlanguage models (GFM/MLLMs), where the communication units are tokens, enabling\nefficient transformer-based token processing at the transmitter and receiver.\nIn this paper, we introduce the potential opportunities and challenges of\nleveraging context in GenSC, explore how to integrate GFM/MLLMs-based token\nprocessing into semantic communication systems to leverage cross-modal context\neffectively at affordable complexity, present the key principles for efficient\nTokCom at various layers in future wireless networks. In a typical image\nsemantic communication setup, we demonstrate a significant improvement of the\nbandwidth efficiency, achieved by TokCom by leveraging the context information\namong tokens. Finally, the potential research directions are identified to\nfacilitate adoption of TokCom in future wireless networks.",

    "abstract": "This paper explores the possibility of learning custom tokens for\nrepresenting new concepts in Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Our aim is to learn\ntokens that can be effective for both discriminative and generative tasks while\ncomposing well with words to form new input queries. The targeted concept is\nspecified in terms of a small set of images and a parent concept described\nusing text. We operate on CLIP text features and propose to use a combination\nof a textual inversion loss and a classification loss to ensure that text\nfeatures of the learned token are aligned with image features of the concept in\nthe CLIP embedding space. We restrict the learned token to a low-dimensional\nsubspace spanned by tokens for attributes that are appropriate for the given\nsuper-class. These modifications improve the quality of compositions of the\nlearned token with natural language for generating new scenes. Further, we show\nthat learned custom tokens can be used to form queries for text-to-image\nretrieval task, and also have the important benefit that composite queries can\nbe visualized to ensure that the desired concept is faithfully encoded. Based\non this, we introduce the method of Generation Aided Image Retrieval, where the\nquery is modified at inference time to better suit the search intent. On the\nDeepFashion2 dataset, our method improves Mean Reciprocal Retrieval (MRR) over\nrelevant baselines by 7%.",

Moreover, accurate weight change\nestimation allows autonomous stores to automatically identify items being\npicked up or put back, ensuring precise cost estimation. However, the\nconventional approach of estimating weight changes requires specialized\nweight-sensing shelves, which are densely deployed weight scales, incurring\nintensive sensor consumption and high costs. Prior works explored the\nvibration-based weight sensing method, but they failed when the location of\nweight change varies.\n  In response to these limitations, we made the following contributions: (1) We\npropose WeVibe, a first item weight change estimation system through active\nshelf vibration sensing. The main intuition of the system is that the weight\nplaced on the shelf influences the dynamic vibration response of the shelf,\nthus altering the shelf vibration patterns. (2) We model a physics-informed\nrelationship between the shelf vibration response and item weight across\nmultiple locations on the shelf based on structural dynamics theory. This\nrelationship is linear and allows easy training of a weight estimation model at\na new location without heavy data collection. (3) We evaluate our system on a\ngondola shelf organized as the real-store settings. WeVibe achieved a mean\nabsolute error down to 38.07g and a standard deviation of 31.2g with one sensor\nand 10% samples from three weight classes on estimating weight change from 0g\nto 450g, which can be leveraged for differentiating items with more than 100g\ndifferences.",

What\nsignal in the data is exploited to learn those rules? We investigate these\nquestions in the context of diffusion models both theoretically and\nempirically. Theoretically, we consider a simple probabilistic context-free\ngrammar - a tree-like graphical model used to represent the hierarchical and\ncompositional structure of data such as language and images. We demonstrate\nthat diffusion models learn the grammar's composition rules with the sample\ncomplexity required for clustering features with statistically similar context,\na process similar to the word2vec algorithm. However, this clustering emerges\nhierarchically: higher-level features associated with longer contexts require\nmore data to be identified. This mechanism leads to a sample complexity that\nscales polynomially with the said context size. As a result, diffusion models\ntrained on an intermediate dataset size generate data coherent up to a certain\nscale, but lacking global coherence. We test these predictions across different\ndomains and find remarkable agreement: both generated texts and images achieve\nprogressively larger coherence lengths as the training time or dataset size\ngrows.

    "abstract": "In the pursuit of superior video-processing MLLMs, we have encountered a\nperplexing paradox: the \"anti-scaling law\", where more data and larger models\nlead to worse performance. This study unmasks the culprit: \"temporal hacking\",\na phenomenon where models shortcut by fixating on select frames, missing the\nfull video narrative. In this work, we systematically establish a comprehensive\ntheory of temporal hacking, defining it from a reinforcement learning\nperspective, introducing the Temporal Perplexity (TPL) score to assess this\nmisalignment, and proposing the Unhackable Temporal Rewarding (UTR) framework\nto mitigate the temporal hacking. Both theoretically and empirically, TPL\nproves to be a reliable indicator of temporal modeling quality, correlating\nstrongly with frame activation patterns. Extensive experiments reveal that UTR\nnot only counters temporal hacking but significantly elevates video\ncomprehension capabilities. This work not only advances video-AI systems but\nalso illuminates the critical importance of aligning proxy rewards with true\nobjectives in MLLM development.",

    "abstract": "Previous 3D human creation methods have made significant progress in\nsynthesizing view-consistent and temporally aligned results from sparse-view\nimages or monocular videos. However, it remains challenging to produce\nperpetually realistic, view-consistent, and temporally coherent human avatars\nfrom a single image, as limited information is available in the single-view\ninput setting. Motivated by the success of 2D character animation, we propose\nHumanGif, a single-view human diffusion model with generative prior.\nSpecifically, we formulate the single-view-based 3D human novel view and pose\nsynthesis as a single-view-conditioned human diffusion process, utilizing\ngenerative priors from foundational diffusion models to complement the missing\ninformation. To ensure fine-grained and consistent novel view and pose\nsynthesis, we introduce a Human NeRF module in HumanGif to learn spatially\naligned features from the input image, implicitly capturing the relative camera\nand human pose transformation. Furthermore, we introduce an image-level loss\nduring optimization to bridge the gap between latent and image spaces in\ndiffusion models. Extensive experiments on RenderPeople, DNA-Rendering, THuman\n2.1, and TikTok datasets demonstrate that HumanGif achieves the best perceptual\nperformance, with better generalizability for novel view and pose synthesis.",

In many cancers, it is associated with poor treatment outcomes.\nMany modern drug combination therapies aim to exploit cell heterogeneity, but\ndetermining how to optimise responses from heterogeneous cell populations while\naccounting for multi-drug synergies remains a challenge. In this work, we\nintroduce and analyse a general optimal control framework that can be used to\nmodel the treatment response of multiple cell populations that are treated with\nmultiple drugs that mutually interact. In this framework, we model the effect\nof multiple drugs on the cell populations using a system of coupled semi-linear\nordinary differential equations and derive general results for the optimal\nsolutions. We then apply this framework to three canonical examples and discuss\nthe wider question of how to relate mathematical optimality to clinically\nobservable outcomes, introducing a systematic approach to propose qualitatively\ndifferent classes of drug dosing inspired by optimal control.",

    "abstract": "Quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) are recurring soft X-ray outbursts from\ngalactic nuclei and represent an intriguing new class of transients. Currently,\n10 QPE sources are reported in the literature, and a major challenge lies in\nidentifying more because they are (apparently) intrinsically and exclusively\nX-ray bright. Here we highlight the unusual infrared (IR) echo of the tidal\ndisruption event (TDE) -- and subsequent QPE source -- AT2019qiz, which rose\ncontinuously and approximately linearly with time over roughly 1000 days\n(between 2019 and 2024). We argue that this continuous long rise alongside the\nrelatively high inferred IR temperature (800-1200 K) cannot be generated by the\nTDE itself, including the late-time/remnant TDE disk, but that the reprocessing\nof the light from the QPEs by a shell of dust can reproduce the observations.\nThis model predicts 1) IR QPEs at the 0.1 percent level that are potentially\ndetectable with the James Webb Space Telescope, and 2) that if the QPEs cease\nin AT2019qiz, the IR light curve should decline steadily and linearly over the\nsame 1000-day timescale. We identify another TDE with similar IR behavior,\nAT2020ysg, which could thus harbor QPEs. Our findings and inferences constitute\na novel method for identifying ``bright'' QPEs (with peak bolometric\nluminosities $\\gtrsim$10$^{44}$ erg/sec), i.e., that the follow-up of optically\nselected TDEs with wide-field infrared surveys can indirectly reveal the\npresence of QPEs. This approach could be particularly effective with the\nupcoming Roman telescope, which could detect dozens of QPE candidates for\nhigh-cadence X-ray follow-up.",

This paper analyzes LLMs' ability to simulate\nsocial media engagement through action guided response generation, where a\nmodel first predicts a user's most likely engagement action-retweet, quote, or\nrewrite-towards a trending post before generating a personalized response\nconditioned on the predicted action.

The Bondi spherical accretion solution has been used to model\naccretion onto compact objects in a variety of situations, from interpretation\nof observations to subgrid models in cosmological simulations. Aims. We aim to\ninvestigate how the presence of dark matter (DM) alters the dynamics and\nphysical properties of accretion onto supermassive black holes on scales\nranging from ~ 10 pc to the event horizon. Methods. In particular, we\ninvestigate Bondi-like accretion flows with zero and low specific angular\nmomentum around supermassive black holes surrounded by dark-matter halos by\nperforming 1D and 2.5D general relativistic hydrodynamics (GRHD) simulations\nusing the black hole accretion code (BHAC). Results. We find notable\ndifferences in the dynamics and structure of spherical accretion flows in the\npresence of DM. The most significant effects include increases in density,\ntemperature, and pressure, as well as variations in radial velocity both inside\nand outside the regions containing DM or even the production of outflow.\nConclusions. This investigation provides valuable insights into the role of\ncosmological effects, particularly DM, in shaping the behavior of accretion\nflows and black holes (BHs). Our simulations may be directly applicable to\nmodel systems with a large black hole-to-halo mass ratio, which are expected to\nbe found at very high redshifts.",

Recent advancements, such as\nOpenAI's o1 and DeepSeek-R1, suggest that scaling up the length of CoT\nsequences during inference could further boost LLM reasoning performance.\nHowever, due to the autoregressive nature of LLM decoding, longer CoT outputs\nlead to a linear increase in inference latency, adversely affecting user\nexperience, particularly when the CoT exceeds 10,000 tokens. To address this\nlimitation, we analyze the semantic importance of tokens within CoT outputs and\nreveal that their contributions to reasoning vary. Building on this insight, we\npropose TokenSkip, a simple yet effective approach that enables LLMs to\nselectively skip less important tokens, allowing for controllable CoT\ncompression. Extensive experiments across various models and tasks demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of TokenSkip in reducing CoT token usage while preserving\nstrong reasoning performance. Notably, when applied to Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct,\nTokenSkip reduces reasoning tokens by 40% (from 313 to 181) on GSM8K, with less\nthan a 0.4% performance drop.",

To address this\ngap, we investigate the task of autoformalizing real-world mathematical\ndefinitions: a critical component of mathematical discourse. Specifically, we\nintroduce two novel resources for autoformalization, collecting definitions\nfrom Wikipedia (Def_Wiki) and arXiv papers (Def_ArXiv). We then systematically\nevaluate a range of LLMs, analyzing their ability to formalize definitions into\nIsabelle/HOL. Furthermore, we investigate strategies to enhance LLMs'\nperformance including refinement through external feedback from Proof\nAssistants, and formal definition grounding, where we augment LLMs'\nformalizations through relevant contextual elements from formal mathematical\nlibraries. Our findings reveal that definitions present a greater challenge\ncompared to existing benchmarks, such as miniF2F. In particular, we found that\nLLMs still struggle with self-correction, and aligning with relevant\nmathematical libraries. At the same time, structured refinement methods and\ndefinition grounding strategies yield notable improvements of up to 16% on\nself-correction capabilities and 43% on the reduction of undefined errors,\nhighlighting promising directions for enhancing LLM-based autoformalization in\nreal-world scenarios.",

This is because LLMs can generate high-quality texts, which are\nchallenging to differentiate from those written by humans. GLTR, which stands\nfor Giant Language Model Test Room and was developed jointly by the MIT-IBM\nWatson AI Lab and HarvardNLP, is a visual tool designed to help detect\nmachine-generated texts based on GPT-2, that highlights the words in text\ndepending on the probability that they were machine-generated.

We used these to calculate\nrealistic mobility perception values, in order to initialise the environment\nand the population of a modal choice simulator, implemented in Netlogo. This\nallows us to visualize the adaptation of the modal distribution in reaction to\nthe evolution of urban planning, depending on whether or not we activate biases\nand habits in individual reasoning.\n  This is an extended and translated version of a demo paper published in\nFrench at JFSMA-JFMS 2024 \"Un simulateur multi-agent de choix modal subjectif\"",

    "abstract": "The field of cultural NLP has recently experienced rapid growth, driven by a\npressing need to ensure that language technologies are effective and safe\nacross a pluralistic user base. This work has largely progressed without a\nshared conception of culture, instead choosing to rely on a wide array of\ncultural proxies. However, this leads to a number of recurring limitations:\ncoarse national boundaries fail to capture nuanced differences that lay within\nthem, limited coverage restricts datasets to only a subset of usually\nhighly-represented cultures, and a lack of dynamicity results in static\ncultural benchmarks that do not change as culture evolves. In this position\npaper, we argue that these methodological limitations are symptomatic of a\ntheoretical gap. We draw on a well-developed theory of culture from\nsociocultural linguistics to fill this gap by 1) demonstrating in a case study\nhow it can clarify methodological constraints and affordances, 2) offering\ntheoretically-motivated paths forward to achieving cultural competence, and 3)\narguing that localization is a more useful framing for the goals of much\ncurrent work in cultural NLP.",

Interest in this area is further\nmotivated by a desire to develop a unified picture of chaos for both quantum\nand classical systems. In this work, we study the adiabatic gauge potential\n(AGP), an object typically studied in quantum mechanics that describes\ndeformations of a quantum state under adiabatic variation of the Hamiltonian,\nin classical Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou (FPUT) and Toda models. We show how the\ntime variance of the AGP over a trajectory probes the long-time correlations of\na generic observable and can be used to distinguish among nearly integrable,\nweakly chaotic, and strongly chaotic regimes. We draw connections between the\nevolution of the AGP and diffusion and derive a fluctuation-dissipation\nrelation that connects its variance to long-time correlations of the\nobservable. Within this framework, we demonstrate that strongly and weakly\nchaotic regimes correspond to normal and anomalous diffusion, respectively. The\nlatter gives rise to a marked increase in the variance as the time interval is\nincreased, and this behavior serves as the basis for our probe of the onset\ntimes of chaos, which is interpreted as a ``mixing\" time. Numerical results are\npresented for FPUT and Toda systems that highlight integrable, weakly chaotic,\nand strongly chaotic regimes.

We then find that BD\nwormholes in the presence of anisotropic matter can exist without violating NEC\nand WEC, either at the throat or across the entire spacetime.",

    "abstract": "Non-Hermitian physics has unveiled unconventional spectral, topological and\ncritical phenomena, challenging traditional band theories. This thesis advances\nits understanding in three aspects. First, the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE)\nis shown to protect real spectra in some ansatz models, not relying on crystal\nsymmetries. Second, we discover the phenomenon of scaling-induced non-Hermitian\nexceptional criticality (SIEC), marked by a unconventional negative dip in\nentanglement entropy scaling, deviating from the well-established logarithmic\nbehavior. A scaling-dependent generalized Brillouin zone (GBZ) is developed to\nanalytically predict this SIEC. Third, we formulate a theoretical framework for\nphase-space GBZs, extending the concept of the GBZ to position-dependent\nsystems, particularly for those with spatially inhomogeneous NHSE hoppings.\nUnprecedented phenomena, including GBZ bifurcation which also protects the\nstability of real spectra, are revealed, introducing new forms of topological\nrobustness governed by phase-space GBZ bifurcations. This thesis also explores\nthe NHSE in Bethe lattices, where the hyperbolic-like lattice geometry gives\nrise to a hierarchy of loop sizes that leads to new forms of critical NHSE\nbehavior.",

While efforts have been made to\ncombine these methods, they primarily rely on post-selection or predefined\nstrategies, leaving an open question: whether LLMs can autonomously adapt their\nreasoning strategy based on their inherent capabilities. In this work, we\npropose TATA (Teaching LLMs According to Their Aptitude), an adaptive framework\nthat enables LLMs to personalize their reasoning strategy spontaneously,\naligning it with their intrinsic aptitude. TATA incorporates base-LLM-aware\ndata selection during supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to tailor training data to\nthe model's unique abilities. This approach equips LLMs to autonomously\ndetermine and apply the appropriate reasoning strategy at test time. We\nevaluate TATA through extensive experiments on six mathematical reasoning\nbenchmarks, using both general-purpose and math-specialized LLMs. Empirical\nresults demonstrate that TATA effectively combines the complementary strengths\nof CoT and TIR, achieving superior or comparable performance with improved\ninference efficiency compared to TIR alone. Further analysis underscores the\ncritical role of aptitude-aware data selection in enabling LLMs to make\neffective and adaptive reasoning decisions and align reasoning strategies with\nmodel capabilities.",

In this paper, we present a novel clinical setup where robotic cone\nbeam computed tomography (CBCT) and robotic US are pre-calibrated and\ndynamically co-registered, enabling new clinical applications. This setup\nallows registration-free rigid registration, facilitating multi-modal guided\nprocedures in the absence of tissue deformation. First, a one-time\npre-calibration is performed between the systems. To ensure a safe insertion\npath by highlighting critical vasculature on the 3D CBCT, SAM2 segments vessels\nfrom B-mode images, using the Doppler signal as an autonomously generated\nprompt. Based on the registration, the Doppler image or segmented vessel masks\nare then mapped onto the CBCT, creating an optimally fused image with\ncomprehensive detail. To validate the system, we used a specially designed\nphantom, featuring lesions covered by ribs and multiple vessels with simulated\nmoving flow. The mapping error between US and CBCT resulted in an average\ndeviation of 1.72+-0.62 mm. A user study demonstrated the effectiveness of\nCBCT-US fusion for needle insertion guidance, showing significant improvements\nin time efficiency, accuracy, and success rate.

However, as\nthe scale of reasoning increases, existing test-time scaling methods suffer\nfrom accumulated historical information, which not only wastes computational\nresources but also interferes with effective reasoning. To address this issue,\nwe observe that complex reasoning can be achieved by solving a series of\nindependent and self-contained subquestions. These subquestions are essentially\n\\textit{atomic questions}, exhibiting the memoryless property similar to Markov\nprocesses. Based on this observation, we propose Atom of Thoughts (\\our), where\neach state transition consists of decomposing the current question into a\ndependency-based directed acyclic graph and contracting its subquestions,\nforming a simplified question that maintains answer equivalence with the\noriginal problem. This answer preservation enables the iterative\n\\textit{decomposition-contraction} process to naturally form a meaningful\nMarkov reasoning process. Furthermore, these atomic states can be seamlessly\nintegrated into existing test-time scaling methods, enabling \\our to serve as a\nplug-in enhancement for improving reasoning capabilities.

This model involves spin vectors $ (s, \\sigma) $, and generalizes both the\nIsing and Potts models by incorporating interactions between two types of\nspins: $s = \\pm 1$ and $\\sigma = 1, \\dots, q$. It is applicable to a wide range\nof systems, including multicomponent alloys, spin glasses, biological systems,\nnetworks, and social models.\n  In this paper, we find some translation-invariant splitting Gibbs measures\n(TISGMs) and show, for $k\\geq 2$, that at sufficiently low temperatures, the\nnumber of such measures is at least $2^{q}+1$. This is not an exact upper\nbound; for $k=2$ and $q=5$, we demonstrate that the number of TISGMs reaches\nthe exact bound of 335, which is much larger than $2^5+1=33$. We prove, for\n$q=5$ that there are 12 critical temperatures at which the number of TISGMs\nchanges, and we provide the exact number of TISGMs for each intermediate\ntemperature. Additionally, we identify temperature regions where three TISGMs,\nclose to the free measure, are either extreme or non-extreme among all Gibbs\nmeasures.\n  We also show that the coupled Ising-Potts model exhibits properties absent in\nthe individual Ising and Potts models. In particular, we observe the following\nnew phenomena:\n  1. In both the Ising and Potts models, if a Gibbs measure exists at some\ntemperature $T_0$, then it exists for all $T<T_0$. However, in the coupled\nIsing-Potts model, some TISGMs may only exist at intermediate temperatures\n(neither very low nor very high).\n  2. The 5-state Potts model has three critical temperatures and up to 31\nTISGMs. We show that for $q=5$, the coupled Ising-Potts model has four times as\nmany critical temperatures and approximately 11 times as many TISGMs. Thus, our\nmodel modifies the phase structure more rapidly and exhibits a significantly\nricher class of splitting Gibbs measures.",

This setting presents challenges that surpass those of\nconventional counterfactual generation. Central to our methodology is the\ndisambiguation of exogenous causes into effect-intrinsic and domain-intrinsic\ncategories.

    "abstract": "Urban scaling laws reveal how cities evolve as their populations grow, yet\nthe role of street network accessibility in this process remains underexplored.\nWe analyze over 5,000 Brazilian cities to establish a scaling law linking\naverage closeness centrality $\\langle c_C\\rangle$ -- a measure of structural\naccessibility in street networks-to population size N . Our results demonstrate\nthat $\\langle c_C\\rangle$ decays sublinearly as $N^{-\\sigma}$ ($\\sigma \\approx\n0.38$), indicating that larger cities redistribute accessibility from cores to\nperipheries while maintaining navigability through hierarchical shortcuts. This\nscaling arises from the fractal interplay between infrastructure and\npopulation, characterized by a network dimension $d \\approx 2.17$, which\nexceeds that of a 2D grid. The slower decline in closeness centrality ($\\sigma\n< 0.5$) reflects a trade-off: urban expansion reduces proximity but enhances\nconnectivity through optimized path diversity, fostering economic dynamism. By\nintegrating the Molinero & Thurner model with network centrality metrics, we\nprovide a framework to reconcile infrastructure efficiency with equitable\naccessibility in growing cities.",

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in visual speech recognition (VSR) have promoted progress\nin lip-to-speech synthesis, where pre-trained VSR models enhance the\nintelligibility of synthesized speech by providing valuable semantic\ninformation. The success achieved by cascade frameworks, which combine\npseudo-VSR with pseudo-text-to-speech (TTS) or implicitly utilize the\ntranscribed text, highlights the benefits of leveraging VSR models. However,\nthese methods typically rely on mel-spectrograms as an intermediate\nrepresentation, which may introduce a key bottleneck: the domain gap between\nsynthetic mel-spectrograms, generated from inherently error-prone lip-to-speech\nmappings, and real mel-spectrograms used to train vocoders. This mismatch\ninevitably degrades synthesis quality. To bridge this gap, we propose Natural\nLip-to-Speech (NaturalL2S), an end-to-end framework integrating acoustic\ninductive biases with differentiable speech generation components.\nSpecifically, we introduce a fundamental frequency (F0) predictor to capture\nprosodic variations in synthesized speech. The predicted F0 then drives a\nDifferentiable Digital Signal Processing (DDSP) synthesizer to generate a\ncoarse signal which serves as prior information for subsequent speech\nsynthesis. Additionally, instead of relying on a reference speaker embedding as\nan auxiliary input, our approach achieves satisfactory performance on speaker\nsimilarity without explicitly modelling speaker characteristics. Both objective\nand subjective evaluation results demonstrate that NaturalL2S can effectively\nenhance the quality of the synthesized speech when compared to state-of-the-art\nmethods.

A quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) scheme is\nused where the excited state of the complex is modelled with orbital-optimized\ndensity functional calculations while solvent molecules are described using\npotential energy functions. The decoherence time of the Pt-Pt vibration\ndominating the photoinduced dynamics is found to be $\\sim$1.6 ps in both\nsolvents. This is in excellent agreement with experimental measurements in\nwater, where intersystem crossing is slow ($>10$ ps). Pathways for the flow of\nexcess energy are identified by monitoring the power of the solvent on\nvibrational modes. The latter are obtained as generalized normal modes from the\nvelocity covariances, and the power is computed using QM/MM embedding forces.\nExcess vibrational energy is found to be predominantly released through\nshort-range repulsive and attractive interactions between the ligand atoms and\nsurrounding solvent molecules, whereas solute-solvent interactions involving\nthe Pt atoms are less important. Since photoexcitation deposits most of the\nexcess energy into Pt-Pt vibrations, energy dissipation to the solvent is\ninefficient.

    "abstract": "Discrete image registration can be a strategy to reconstruct signals from\nsamples corrupted by blur and noise. We examine superresolution and discrete\nimage registration for one-dimensional spatially-limited piecewise constant\nfunctions which are subject to blur which is Gaussian or a mixture of Gaussians\nas well as to round-off errors. Previous approaches address the signal recovery\nproblem as an optimization problem. We focus on a regime with low blur and\nsuggest that the operations of blur, sampling, and quantization are not unlike\nthe operation of a computer program and have an abstraction that can be studied\nwith a type of logic. When the minimum distance between discontinuity points is\nbetween $1.5$ and 2 times the sampling interval, we can encounter the simplest\nform of a type of interference between discontinuity points that we call\n``commingling.'' We describe a way to reason about two sets of samples of the\nsame signal that will often result in the correct recovery of signal\namplitudes. We also discuss ways to estimate bounds on the distances between\ndiscontinuity points.",

    "abstract": "This study evaluates the uncertainty in nanodosimetric calculations caused by\nvariations in interaction cross sections within Monte Carlo Track Structure\n(MCTS) simulation codes. Nanodosimetry relies on accurately simulating particle\ninteractions at the molecular scale. Different MCTS codes employ distinct\nphysical models and datasets for electron interactions in liquid water, a\nsurrogate for biological tissues. The paper focuses on the Ionization Cluster\nSize Distribution (ICSD) generated by electrons of varying energies in\nnanometric volumes. Seven MCTS codes were tested using their native cross\nsections and a common dataset derived from averaging data used in the\nparticipating codes. The results reveal significant discrepancies among the\ncodes in ICSDs and derived biologically relevant nanodosimetric quantities such\nas mean ionization numbers (M1) and probabilities of obtaining two or more\nionizations (F2). The largest variations were observed for low-energy\nelectrons, where the contribution from interaction cross sections dominates the\noverall uncertainties. For instance, M1 values for ICSDs of electron of 20 eV\ncan differ by around 45 % (RSD) and 34 % (RSD) was found for F2 values of ICSDs\nof electrons of 50 eV. Using common cross sections substantially reduced the\ndiscrepancies, suggesting that cross section datasets are the primary source of\nvariability. Finally, estimates of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage using the\nPARTRAC code highlight tht cross section variations have a non-negligible\nimpact simulated biological outcomes, particularly for double-strand breaks\n(DSBs) Indeed, despite the fact that many other parameters in the simulation\nthat can greatly differ from one code to another, the different interaction\ncross-sections studied in this work can lead to differences in the number of\nDSBs calculated with the PARTRAC code of up to 15%.",

This\nstudy aims to present a method for analysing sensory attributes through a\nunified multivariate model.

This proposal is based\non multivariate methods for categorical data and maximum likelihood theory.

The simulated results\ndemonstrated overall concordance rates exceeding 80\\% for the unified model\ncompared to the separate models.

However, training all\ntasks together in a single architecture can lead to performance degradation,\nknown as negative transfer, which is a main concern in multi-task learning.\nPrevious works have addressed this issue by optimizing the multi-task network\nthrough gradient manipulation or weighted loss adjustments. However, their\noptimization strategy focuses on addressing task imbalance in shared\nparameters, neglecting the learning of task-specific parameters. As a result,\nthey show limitations in mitigating negative transfer, since the learning of\nshared space and task-specific information influences each other during\noptimization. To address this, we propose a different approach to enhance\nmulti-task performance by selectively grouping tasks and updating them for each\nbatch during optimization. We introduce an algorithm that adaptively determines\nhow to effectively group tasks and update them during the learning process. To\ntrack inter-task relations and optimize multi-task networks simultaneously, we\npropose proximal inter-task affinity, which can be measured during the\noptimization process.

P-L\nrelations serve as a valuable diagnostic for understanding stellar evolution\nalong the AGB. 3D RHD simulations provide a powerful tool for investigating\npulsation phenomena driven by convective processes and their non-linear\ncoupling with stellar oscillations. We investigate multi-mode pulsations in AGB\nstars using advanced 3D 'star-in-a-box' simulations with the CO5BOLD code.\nSignatures of these multi-mode pulsations were weak in our previous 3D models.\nOur focus is on identifying and characterising the various pulsation modes,\nexamining their persistence and transitions, and comparing the results with 1D\nmodel predictions and observational data where applicable. We produced a new\nmodel grid comprising AGB stars with current masses of $0.7$, $0.8$, and\n$1\\,\\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$. Fourier analysis was applied to dynamic,\ntime-dependent quantities to extract dominant pulsation modes and their\ncorresponding periods. Additionally, wavelet transforms were employed to\nidentify mode-switching behaviour over time. The models successfully reproduce\nthe P-L sequences found in AGB stars. Mode-switching phenomena are found in\nboth the models and wavelet analyses of observational data, allowing us to\ninfer similarities in the underlying pulsation dynamics. These 3D simulations\nhighlight the natural emergence of multi-mode pulsations, including both radial\nand non-radial modes, driven by the self-consistent interplay of convection and\noscillations. Our findings underscore the value of 3D RHD models in capturing\nthe non-linear behaviour of AGB pulsations, providing insights into mode\nswitching, envelope structures, and potential links to episodic mass-loss\nevents.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the existence of exotic matter phases and phase transitions\nwithin the core of neutron stars is crucial to advancing our knowledge of\ncold-dense matter physics. Recent multi-messenger observations, including\ngravitational waves from neutron star mergers and precise X-ray data from\nNASA's Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) mission, have\nsignificantly constrained the neutron star equation of state (EOS). This study\ninvestigates the effects of phase transitions in neutron stars, focusing on\nNICER's latest observation of PSR J0437--4715. We employ Bayesian inference\ntechniques to evaluate the presence of first-order phase transitions using a\npiecewise polytropic EOS model. Our analysis incorporates data from multiple\nNICER sources, to refine constraints on key phase transition parameters,\nincluding critical density and transition depth. We find that including data\nfrom PSR J0437--4715 improves the evidence of phase transitions and tightens\nthe EOS constraints, especially at higher densities. However, Bayes factor\nanalysis only indicates a slight preference for models without phase\ntransitions and current observational precision is insufficient to draw\ndefinitive conclusions. In particular, this polytropic model identifies the\ncritical phase transition mass of neutron stars as being close to 1.4 solar\nmasses, which coincides with the approximate mass range of PSR J0437--4715.\nThis work emphasizes the importance of precise measurements of PSR J0437--4715\nfor deepening our understanding of neutron star interiors and exploring\npotential new physics at extreme densities.",

Although current tracking methods have made\nsignificant advancements in accuracy and efficiency, they still face challenges\nin robustness when dealing with cluttered backgrounds, rotationally symmetric\nobjects, and noisy sequences. In this paper, we first propose a robust\ncontour-based pose tracking method that addresses error-prone contour\ncorrespondences and improves noise tolerance. It utilizes a fan-shaped search\nstrategy to refine correspondences and models local contour shape and noise\nuncertainty as mixed probability distribution, resulting in a highly robust\ncontour energy function. Secondly, we introduce a CPU-only strategy to better\ntrack rotationally symmetric objects and assist the contour-based method in\novercoming local minima by exploring sparse interior correspondences. This is\nachieved by pre-sampling interior points from sparse viewpoint templates\noffline and using the DIS optical flow algorithm to compute their\ncorrespondences during tracking. Finally, we formulate a unified energy\nfunction to fuse contour and interior information, which is solvable using a\nre-weighted least squares algorithm. Experiments on public datasets and real\nscenarios demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms\nstate-of-the-art monocular tracking methods and can achieve more than 100 FPS\nusing only a CPU.",

To\nthis end, we propose a framework consisting of two key components: a Gas\nComputation Mechanism (GCM), which quantifies the load a transaction places on\nthe network in terms of parallelization and computation, measured in units of\ngas, and a Transaction Fee Mechanism (TFM), which assigns a price to each unit\nof gas.

Our main contributions are fixed-parameter tractable\nalgorithms with respect to: enumeration time of the related static problem; the\ncombination of temporal neighbourhood diversity and lifetime of the input\ngraph; and the combination of lifetime and treewidth of the footprint graph.",

By addressing both uncertainty sources, the method\nachieves state-of-the-art results for lead times of 6 to 162 hours, eliminating\nthe need for separate models for short- and mid-term forecasting. It also\nimproves short-term forecasts during high weather uncertainty periods, which\nmethods based on deterministic weather forecasts fail to capture. The study\nreveals that weather-to-power uncertainty is more significant for short-term\nforecasts, while weather forecast uncertainty dominates mid-term forecasts,\nwith the transition point varying between wind farms.

Self-improvement methods, where reasoning chains are\ngenerated and those leading to correct results are selected for training, have\nsucceeded in tasks like mathematical problem solving.

Low-quality reasoning chains may falsely\nmatch binary truth labels, introducing faulty reasoning into the\nself-improvement process and ultimately degrading performance. To address this,\nwe propose STRIVE: Structured Reasoning for Self-Improved Verification. Our\nmethod introduces a structured reasoning design with Claim Decomposition,\nEntity Analysis, and Evidence Grounding Verification. These components improve\nreasoning quality, reduce errors, and provide additional supervision signals\nfor self-improvement. STRIVE begins with a warm-up phase, where the base model\nis fine-tuned on a small number of annotated examples to learn the structured\nreasoning design. It is then applied to generate reasoning chains for all\ntraining examples, selecting only those that are correct and structurally sound\nfor subsequent self-improvement training. We demonstrate that STRIVE achieves\nsignificant improvements over baseline models, with a 31.4% performance gain\nover the base model and 20.7% over Chain of Thought on the HOVER datasets,\nhighlighting its effectiveness.",

To address these limitations, we\npropose two semiparametric SV models that use data to better approximate error\ndistributions. To facilitate the computation of model parameters, we developed\na Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method for estimating model parameters and\nvolatility dynamics. Simulations and empirical tests on S&P 500 data indicate\nthat nonparametric models can minimize bias and variance in volatility\nestimation, providing a more accurate reflection of market expectations about\nvolatility.

These direct theorems are essential for obtaining qualitative\napproximation results in suitable Lipschitz and generalized Lipschitz classes,\nas they also provide conditions for studying the rate of convergence when\nfunctions belonging to Sobolev spaces are considered. The converse implication\nis, in general, delicate, and actually consists in addressing an inverse\napproximation problem allowing to deduce regularity properties of a function\nfrom a given rate of convergence.

At the core of this paradigm lies the\nClassical-Quantum (CQ) paradigm, in which the qubit states of high-dimensional\nclassical data are encoded using sophisticated classical encoding strategies\nwhich encode the data in terms of amplitude and angle of rotation, along with\nsuperposition mapping. These techniques allow compression of information\nexponentially into Hilbert space representations, which, together with reduced\nsample complexity, allows greater feature expressivity.

    "abstract": "Understanding water behaviour on 2D materials is crucial for sensing,\nmicrofluidics, and tribology. While water/graphene interactions are well\nstudied, water on hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) remains largely unexplored.\nDespite structural similarity to graphene, h-BN's slightly polar B-N bonds\nimpart a large band gap, high thermal conductivity, and chemical stability,\nmaking it promising for electronics, lubricants, and coatings. Moreover,\nexisting water studies often focus on multilayer water dynamics, overlooking\nsingle-molecular details. We bridge this gap by studying single-molecular water\nfriction and diffusion on h-BN, comparing it with graphene using helium\nspin-echo experiments and ab initio calculations. Our findings show that water\ndiffusion on h-BN/Ni follows a complex rotational-translational dynamic, unlike\ngraphene. While conventional views treat water motion as discrete jumps between\nequivalent adsorption sites, we demonstrate that on h-BN, water molecules\nrotate freely around their centre of mass. Although the binding energies of\nwater on h-BN and graphene are similar, the activation energy for water\ndynamics on h-BN is 2.5 times lower than on graphene, implying a much lower\nbarrier for molecular mobility. The fundamentally different diffusion\ncharacteristics which classical models cannot capture, underscores the need to\nrethink how we model water on polar 2D materials. Moreover, our analysis\nreveals that the metal substrate strongly influences water friction, with\nh-BN/Ni showing a markedly lower friction than graphene/Ni, in stark contrast\nto the free-standing materials. These findings challenge assumptions about 2D\nmaterial-water interactions, highlighting the crucial role of substrate effects\nin chemistry and material science and offer insights for designing\nnext-generation microfluidic devices that require precise water mobility\ncontrol.",

To address these issues, we propose a novel Federated\nImitation Learning (FIL)-based framework for multi-intersection TSC, named\nFitLight, which allows RL agents to plug-and-play for any traffic environment\nwithout additional pre-training cost. Unlike existing imitation learning\napproaches that rely on pre-training RL agents with demonstrations, FitLight\nallows real-time imitation learning and seamless transition to reinforcement\nlearning. Due to our proposed knowledge-sharing mechanism and novel hybrid\npressure-based agent design, RL agents can quickly find a best control policy\nwith only a few episodes. Moreover, for resource-constrained TSC scenarios,\nFitLight supports model pruning and heterogeneous model aggregation, such that\nRL agents can work on a micro-controller with merely 16{\\it KB} RAM and 32{\\it\nKB} ROM. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, compared to state-of-the-art\nmethods, FitLight not only provides a superior starting point but also\nconverges to a better final solution on both real-world and synthetic datasets,\neven under extreme resource limitations.",

    "abstract": "Simulation of interacting fermionic Hamiltonians is one of the most promising\napplications of quantum computers. However, the feasibility of analysing\nfermionic systems with a quantum computer hinges on the efficiency of\nfermion-to-qubit mappings that encode non-local fermionic degrees of freedom in\nlocal qubit degrees of freedom. While recent works have highlighted the\nimportance of designing fermion-to-qubit mappings that are tailored to specific\nproblem Hamiltonians, the methods proposed so far are either restricted to a\nnarrow class of mappings or they use computationally expensive and unscalable\nbrute-force search algorithms. Here, we address this challenge by designing a\n$\\mathrm{\\textbf{heuristic}}$ numerical optimization framework for\nfermion-to-qubit mappings. To this end, we first translate the fermion-to-qubit\nmapping problem to a Clifford circuit optimization problem, and then use\nsimulated annealing to optimize the average Pauli weight of the problem\nHamiltonian. For all fermionic Hamiltonians we have considered, the numerically\noptimized mappings outperform their conventional counterparts, including\nternary-tree-based mappings that are known to be optimal for single creation\nand annihilation operators. We find that our optimized mappings yield between\n$15\\%$ to $40\\%$ improvements on the average Pauli weight when the simulation\nHamiltonian has an intermediate level of complexity. Most remarkably, the\noptimized mappings improve the average Pauli weight for $6 \\times 6$\nnearest-neighbor hopping and Hubbard models by more than $40\\%$ and $20\\%$,\nrespectively. Surprisingly, we also find specific interaction Hamiltonians for\nwhich the optimized mapping outperform $\\mathrm{\\textbf{any}}$\nternary-tree-based mapping. Our results establish heuristic numerical\noptimization as an effective method for obtaining mappings tailored for\nspecific fermionic Hamiltonian.",

Such a scientific context naturally\nraises an interdisciplinary question -- what about such a language-thought\ndissociation in large language models (LLMs)? In this paper, as an initial\nforay, we explore this question by focusing on simple arithmetic skills (e.g.,\n$1+2=$ ?) as a thinking ability and analyzing the geometry of their encoding in\nLLMs' representation space. Our experiments with linear classifiers and cluster\nseparability tests demonstrate that simple arithmetic equations and general\nlanguage input are encoded in completely separated regions in LLMs' internal\nrepresentation space across all the layers, which is also supported with more\ncontrolled stimuli (e.g., spelled-out equations).

    "abstract": "We address the dynamics of interacting particles on a disordered lattice\nformed by a random comb. The dynamics comprises that of the asymmetric simple\nexclusion process, whereby motion to nearest-neighour sites that are empty is\nmore likely in the direction of a bias than in the opposite direction. The\nrandom comb comprises a backbone lattice from each site of which emanates a\nbranch with a random number of sites. The backbone and the branches run in the\ndirection of the bias. The number of branch sites or alternatively the branch\nlengths are sampled independently from a common distribution, specifically, an\nexponential distribution. The system relaxes at long times into a\nnonequilibrium stationary state. We analyse the stationary-state density of\nsites across the random comb, and also explore the transport properties, in\nparticular, the stationary-state drift velocity of particles along the\nbackbone. We show that in the stationary state, the density is uniform along\nthe backbone and nonuniform along the branches, decreasing monotonically from\nthe free-end of a branch to its intersection with the backbone. On the other\nhand, the drift velocity as a function of the bias strength has a non-monotonic\ndependence, first increasing and then decreasing with increase of bias.\nHowever, remarkably, as the particle density increases, the dependence becomes\nno more non-monotonic. We understand this effect as a consequence of an\ninterplay between biased hopping and hard-core exclusion, whereby sites towards\nthe free end of the branches remain occupied for long times and become\neffectively non-participatory in the dynamics of the system. This results in an\neffective reduction of the branch lengths and a motion of the particles that\ntakes place primarily along the backbone.",

In recent\nyears, progress has been made thanks to the improvements in the quality of\nspectra from new extreme precision RV spectrometers. However, detecting the RV\nsignals of Earth-like exoplanets remains challenging, as the spectroscopic\nsignatures of low-mass planets can be obscured or confused with intrinsic\nstellar variability. Changes in the shapes of spectral lines across time can\nprovide valuable information for disentangling stellar activity from true\nDoppler shifts caused by low-mass exoplanets. In this work, we present a fixed\neffects linear model to estimate RV signals that controls for changes in line\nshapes by aggregating information from hundreds of spectral lines. Our\nmethodology incorporates a wild-bootstrap approach for modeling uncertainty and\ncross-validation to control for overfitting. We evaluate the model's ability to\nremove stellar activity using solar observations from the NEID spectrograph, as\nthe sun's true center-of-mass motion is precisely known. Including line\nshape-change covariates reduces the RV root-mean-square errors by approximately\n70% (from 1.919 m s$^{-1}$ to 0.575 m s$^{-1}$) relative to using only the\nline-by-line Doppler shifts. The magnitude of the residuals is significantly\nless than that from traditional CCF-based RV estimators and comparable to other\nstate-of-the-art methods for mitigating stellar variability.",

Through a detailed analysis of concrete examples -\nincluding multi-target classification, robotics with constrained output spaces,\nlearning in continuous task domains, and higher-level concept memorization - we\ndemonstrate how current CL approaches often fail when applied beyond standard\nclassification.

Although\nthe emergence of a thermal Hall effect is known to be sensitive to lattice\ngeometry and gauge structures, an intuitive understanding of the conditions for\nits emergence remains limited, especially for edge-shared lattice geometries\nsuch as square and triangular lattices. Here, we develop an effective field\ntheory of magnons in square-lattice antiferromagnets to establish the intuitive\npicture that elucidates the conditions for a finite thermal Hall response. By\nconstructing an effective field theory from a spin model on the square lattice,\nwe show that its low-energy excitations can be described by magnons with an\neffective SU(2) gauge field and Zeeman field that couple to magnon's\npseudospins, which reflect the two-sublattice degrees of freedom in the\nantiferromagnets. The field strength associated with the SU(2) gauge field acts\nas a pseudospin-dependent magnetic field, bending the magnon's trajectories in\nopposite directions depending on their pseudospin. In addition, the effective\nZeeman field induces an imbalance between pseudospin up and down magnons, and\nthe combination of these two fields gives rise to the thermal Hall effect of\nmagnons. This intuitive picture provides a systematic classification of\nmagnetic orders in square-lattice antiferromagnets based on the presence or\nabsence of the thermal Hall effect.

However, approach (i) often\ndoes not provide a reliable joint estimate of the goodness of the models, as it\nhas two different best models: one for fairness and another for relevance.\nApproach (ii) is also problematic because these measures tend to be ad-hoc and\ndo not relate well to traditional relevance measures, like NDCG. Motivated by\nthis, we present a new approach for jointly evaluating fairness and relevance\nin RSs: Distance to Pareto Frontier (DPFR). Given some user-item interaction\ndata, we compute their Pareto frontier for a pair of existing relevance and\nfairness measures, and then use the distance from the frontier as a measure of\nthe jointly achievable fairness and relevance. Our approach is modular and\nintuitive as it can be computed with existing measures. Experiments with 4 RS\nmodels, 3 re-ranking strategies, and 6 datasets show that existing metrics have\ninconsistent associations with our Pareto-optimal solution, making DPFR a more\nrobust and theoretically well-founded joint measure for assessing fairness and\nrelevance.

To\naddress this, we propose a causally grounded rating framework to study the\nrobustness of Foundational Models for Time Series (FMTS) with respect to input\nperturbations. We evaluate our approach to the stock price prediction problem,\na well-studied problem with easily accessible public data, evaluating six\nstate-of-the-art (some multi-modal) FMTS across six prominent stocks spanning\nthree industries. The ratings proposed by our framework effectively assess the\nrobustness of FMTS and also offer actionable insights for model selection and\ndeployment. Within the scope of our study, we find that (1) multi-modal FMTS\nexhibit better robustness and accuracy compared to their uni-modal versions\nand, (2) FMTS pre-trained on time series forecasting task exhibit better\nrobustness and forecasting accuracy compared to general-purpose FMTS\npre-trained across diverse settings. Further, to validate our framework's\nusability, we conduct a user study showcasing FMTS prediction errors along with\nour computed ratings.

The\nproblem, known as Hamiltonian learning, is well understood under the assumption\nthat interactions are local, but this assumption may not hold for arbitrary\nHamiltonians. Previous methods all require high-order inverse polynomial\ndependency with precision, unable to surpass the standard quantum limit and\nreach the gold standard Heisenberg-limited scaling. Whether Heisenberg-limited\nHamiltonian learning is possible without prior assumptions about the\ninteraction structures, a challenge we term \\emph{ansatz-free Hamiltonian\nlearning}, remains an open question. In this work, we present a quantum\nalgorithm to learn arbitrary sparse Hamiltonians without any structure\nconstraints using only black-box queries of the system's real-time evolution\nand minimal digital controls to attain Heisenberg-limited scaling in estimation\nerror. Our method is also resilient to state-preparation-and-measurement\nerrors, enhancing its practical feasibility. We numerically demonstrate our\nansatz-free protocol for learning physical Hamiltonians and validating analog\nquantum simulations, benchmarking our performance against the state-of-the-art\nHeisenberg-limited learning approach. Moreover, we establish a fundamental\ntrade-off between total evolution time and quantum control on learning\narbitrary interactions, revealing the intrinsic interplay between\ncontrollability and total evolution time complexity for any learning algorithm.\nThese results pave the way for further exploration into Heisenberg-limited\nHamiltonian learning in complex quantum systems under minimal assumptions,\npotentially enabling new benchmarking and verification protocols.",

To address these limitations, we propose CAMEL, a novel framework\nintegrating LLM-generated suboptimal policies into the RL training pipeline.\nCAMEL leverages dynamic action masking and an adaptive epsilon-masking\nmechanism to guide exploration during early training stages while gradually\nenabling agents to optimize policies independently. At the core of CAMEL lies\nthe integration of Python-executable suboptimal policies generated by LLMs\nbased on environment descriptions and task objectives. Although simplistic and\nhard-coded, these policies offer valuable initial guidance for RL agents. To\neffectively utilize these priors, CAMEL employs masking-aware optimization to\ndynamically constrain the action space based on LLM outputs. Additionally,\nepsilon-masking gradually reduces reliance on LLM-generated guidance, enabling\nagents to transition from constrained exploration to autonomous policy\nrefinement. Experimental validation on Gymnasium MuJoCo environments\ndemonstrates the effectiveness of CAMEL. In Hopper-v4 and Ant-v4, LLM-generated\npolicies significantly improve sample efficiency, achieving performance\ncomparable to or surpassing expert masking baselines. For Walker2d-v4, where\nLLMs struggle to accurately model bipedal gait dynamics, CAMEL maintains robust\nRL performance without notable degradation, highlighting the framework's\nadaptability across diverse tasks.

The proposed approach\nleverages Vision-Language Models to automatically recognize objects and\ngenerate appropriate class names, aiming to solve the challenge of class\nspecification and naming quality. Through extensive experiments on several\npublic datasets, we highlight the crucial role of the text encoder in model\nperformance, particularly when the image text classes are paired with generated\ndescriptions. Despite the challenges introduced by the sensitivity of the\nsegmentation text encoder to false negatives within the class tagging process,\nwhich adds complexity to the task, we demonstrate that our fully automated\npipeline significantly enhances vocabulary-free segmentation accuracy across\ndiverse real-world scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Many existing approaches for learning from labeled data assume the existence\nof gold-standard labels. According to these approaches, inter-annotator\ndisagreement is seen as noise to be removed, either through refinement of\nannotation guidelines, label adjudication, or label filtering. However,\nannotator disagreement can rarely be totally eradicated, especially on more\nsubjective tasks such as sentiment analysis or hate speech detection where\ndisagreement is natural. Therefore, a new approach to learning from labeled\ndata, called data perspectivism, seeks to leverage inter-annotator disagreement\nto learn models that stay true to the inherent uncertainty of the task by\ntreating annotations as opinions of the annotators, rather than gold-standard\nfacts. Despite this conceptual grounding, existing methods under data\nperspectivism are limited to using disagreement as the sole source of\nannotation uncertainty. To expand the possibilities of data perspectivism, we\nintroduce Subjective Logic Encodings (SLEs), a flexible framework for\nconstructing classification targets that explicitly encodes annotations as\nopinions of the annotators. Based on Subjective Logic Theory, SLEs encode\nlabels as Dirichlet distributions and provide principled methods for encoding\nand aggregating various types of annotation uncertainty -- annotator\nconfidence, reliability, and disagreement -- into the targets. We show that\nSLEs are a generalization of other types of label encodings as well as how to\nestimate models to predict SLEs using a distribution matching objective.",

Their extreme properties challenge conventional blazar\nemission models and provide a unique opportunity to test the limits of particle\nacceleration and emission mechanisms in relativistic jets. However, the number\nof identified EHSPs is still small, limiting comprehensive studies of their\npopulation and characteristics. This study aims to identify new EHSP candidates\nand characterise their emission properties. A sample of 124 $\\gamma$-ray\nblazars was analysed, selected for their high synchrotron peak frequencies and\n$\\gamma$-ray emission properties, with a focus on sources showing low\nvariability and good broadband data coverage. Their SEDs were constructed using\narchival multi-wavelength data from the SSDC SED Builder service, supplemented\nwith recent Swift-UVOT, Swift-XRT, and Fermi-LAT observations. The SEDs were\nmodelled with a one-zone synchrotron/synchrotron-self-Compton framework,\nclassifying sources by synchrotron peak frequency. We identify 66 new EHSP\ncandidates, significantly expanding the known population. A clear correlation\nbetween synchrotron peak frequency and the magnetic-to-kinetic energy density\nratio is found, with the most extreme EHSPs nearing equipartition. Host galaxy\nemission is detected in many sources, but no significant differences are\nobserved between elliptical and lenticular hosts. Our analysis suggests that\nnine high-synchrotron peaked/EHSPs could be observed by CTAO at $>5\\sigma$ (20\nat $>3\\sigma$) in 20-hour exposures, indicating that while the overall\ndetection rate remains modest, a subset of these sources is within reach of\nnext-generation very-high-energy gamma-ray instruments.",

While recent\nadvances like o1, Deepseek R1, and Kimi1.5 demonstrate RL's potential, the lack\nof transparency about training data requirements has hindered systematic\nprogress. Starting directly from base models without distillation, we challenge\nthe assumption that scaling up RL training data inherently improves\nperformance. we demonstrate that a strategically selected subset of just 1,389\nsamples can outperform the full 8,523-sample dataset. We introduce Learning\nImpact Measurement (LIM), an automated method to evaluate and prioritize\ntraining samples based on their alignment with model learning trajectories,\nenabling efficient resource utilization and scalable implementation. Our method\nachieves comparable or even superior performance using only 1,389 samples\nversus the full 8,523 samples dataset.

    "abstract": "More than 200 A- and F-type stars observed with Kepler exhibit a distinctive\n'hump & spike' feature in their Fourier spectra. The hump is commonly\ninterpreted as unresolved Rossby modes, while the spike has been linked to\nrotational modulation. Two competing interpretations exist for the spike:\nmagnetic phenomena, such as stellar spots, or Overstable Convective (OsC) modes\nresonantly exciting low-frequency g modes within the stellar envelope.\n  We analysed photometric data from Kepler and TESS for HR 7495, the brightest\n'hump & spike' star (V=5.06), covering 4.5 years and four seasons,\nrespectively. Additionally, radial velocity measurements and\nspectropolarimetric data were used to investigate magnetic fields and surface\nfeatures. Furthermore, we analysed model-based artificial light and radial\nvelocity curves to examine the influence of OsC modes on the phase-folded light\ncurves.\n  The phase-folded light curves show that the spike characteristics of HR 7495\nalign more closely with rotational modulation by stellar spots than with OsC\nmodes. No significant magnetic fields were detected, limiting the field's\npossible amplitude and geometry. This supports the hypothesis of a subsurface\nconvective layer operating a dynamo, producing low-amplitude, complex magnetic\nfields. The variability patterns suggest multiple evolving spots. A comparison\nof contemporaneously observed light and RV data with modelled OsC modes reveals\na 0.5 phase offset, strongly disfavouring pulsations as the cause of the spike.\n  While the evolutionary stage of HR 7495 does not entirely preclude the\npossibility of OsC modes, the observational data overwhelmingly support the\nstellar spots hypothesis. Our analysis, combined with previous literature,\nsuggests that if not all A- and F-type, at least the 'hump & spike' stars,\nharbour an undetected weak magnetic field, likely driven by a dynamo mechanism.",

Under the adiabatic approximation, the time dependence can be eliminated,\nallowing the Berry topological phase to be obtained from a closed trajectory in\nparameter space. In solid-state physics, this approach is commonly applied by\ntaking a reciprocal space wavevector as the parameter, which is assumed to be\nvaried by electromagnetic fields.The Berry curvature is then obtained by\ncomputing the derivatives of Bloch wavefunctions in reciprocal space. However,\nin many systems-especially gapless ones-the adiabatic approximation is never\nsatisfied. This is particularly true in Dirac and Weyl materials, where the\nBerry curvature is often calculated without considering the breakdown of the\nadiabatic condition. In this work, we demonstrate how other time-dependent\ntopological quantities, specifically the Aharonov-Anandan phase, can be used to\nextract information not only about topology but also about band transitions in\n2D materials. In particular, a relationship between the current and the\nAharonov-Anandan phase is proved, showing that photon-induced transitions\nproduce current vortices. To illustrate this, we analyze graphene under\nelectromagnetic radiation from a time-driven perspective, showing how the\nAharonov-Anandan and Berry phases provide complementary insights into topology,\ninterband transitions, and currents. This is achieved by using the Dirac-Bloch\nformalism and by solving the time-dependent equations within Floquet theory.",

    "abstract": "Agents in real-world scenarios like automated driving deal with uncertainty\nin their environment, in particular due to perceptual uncertainty. Although,\nreinforcement learning is dedicated to autonomous decision-making under\nuncertainty these algorithms are typically not informed about the uncertainty\ncurrently contained in their environment. On the other hand, uncertainty\nestimation for perception itself is typically directly evaluated in the\nperception domain, e.g., in terms of false positive detection rates or\ncalibration errors based on camera images. Its use for deciding on\ngoal-oriented actions remains largely unstudied. In this paper, we investigate\nhow an agent's behavior is influenced by an uncertain perception and how this\nbehavior changes if information about this uncertainty is available. Therefore,\nwe consider a proxy task, where the agent is rewarded for driving a route as\nfast as possible without colliding with other road users. For controlled\nexperiments, we introduce uncertainty in the observation space by perturbing\nthe perception of the given agent while informing the latter. Our experiments\nshow that an unreliable observation space modeled by a perturbed perception\nleads to a defensive driving behavior of the agent. Furthermore, when adding\nthe information about the current uncertainty directly to the observation\nspace, the agent adapts to the specific situation and in general accomplishes\nits task faster while, at the same time, accounting for risks.",

Offload-based methods have\nbeen proposed to address this challenge, but they face difficulties with expert\nprediction. Inaccurate expert predictions can result in prolonged inference\ndelays. To promote the application of MoE models in edge scenarios, we propose\nFate, an offloading system designed for MoE models to enable efficient\ninference in resource-constrained environments. The key insight behind Fate is\nthat gate inputs from adjacent layers can be effectively used for expert\nprefetching, achieving high prediction accuracy without additional GPU\noverhead. Furthermore, Fate employs a shallow-favoring expert caching strategy\nthat increases the expert hit rate to 99\\%. Additionally, Fate integrates\ntailored quantization strategies for cache optimization and IO efficiency.\nExperimental results show that, compared to Load on Demand and Expert\nActivation Path-based method, Fate achieves up to 4.5x and 1.9x speedups in\nprefill speed and up to 4.1x and 2.2x speedups in decoding speed, respectively,\nwhile maintaining inference quality.

    "abstract": "Since the middle of the 20th century, a fierce battle is being fought between\nsymbolic and continuous approaches to language and cognition. The success of\ndeep learning models, and LLMs in particular, has been alternatively taken as\nshowing that the continuous camp has won, or dismissed as an irrelevant\nengineering development. However, in this position paper I argue that deep\nlearning models for language actually represent a synthesis between the two\ntraditions. This is because 1) deep learning architectures allow for both\ncontinuous/distributed and symbolic/discrete-like representations and\ncomputations; 2) models trained on language make use this flexibility. In\nparticular, I review recent research in mechanistic interpretability that\nshowcases how a substantial part of morphosyntactic knowledge is encoded in a\nnear-discrete fashion in LLMs. This line of research suggests that different\nbehaviors arise in an emergent fashion, and models flexibly alternate between\nthe two modes (and everything in between) as needed. This is possibly one of\nthe main reasons for their wild success; and it is also what makes them\nparticularly interesting for the study of language and cognition. Is it time\nfor peace?",

While there are some cell libraries\nand simulation tools for SFQ circuit development, they do not verify the\ninput-output consistency, and designers have significant responsibilities to\nensure it manually. Additionally, designers have to carefully manage net names\nwithout unintended duplication and correct connectivity among nets in a netlist\nfor simulations. We propose RustSFQ, a domain-specific language (DSL) embedded\nin Rust that automatically ensures the input-output consistency in the SFQ\ncircuit by leveraging the ownership system of Rust. Each SFQ circuit element is\nrepresented as a function while wires are represented as instances, and the\nRust compiler verifies that multiple elements do not share a single wire\nthrough the ownership system. Circuit descriptions in the RustSFQ are\nsuccessfully compiled into low-level netlists for both analog and digital\ncircuit simulations, and the DSL provides higher productivity than the\nconventional design flow. Using the RustSFQ, we developed an SFQ-based\nReed-Solomon encoder with a 4-bit width for the first time as a case study.

Signal decomposition plays a crucial role in the\nrepresentation and processing of such information, in particular, to process\ngraph signals based on notions of scale (e.g., coarse to fine). The graph\nspectrum is more irregular than for conventional domains; i.e., it is\ninfluenced by graph topology, and, therefore, assumptions about spectral\nrepresentations of graph signals are not easy to make. Here, we propose a tight\nframe design that is adapted to the graph Laplacian spectral content of given\nclasses of graph signals. The design is based on using the ensemble energy\nspectral density, a notion of spectral content of given signal sets that we\ndetermine either directly using the graph Fourier transform or indirectly\nthrough a polynomial-based approximation scheme. The approximation scheme has\nthe benefit that (i) it does not require eigendecomposition of the Laplacian\nmatrix making the method feasible for large graphs, and (ii) it leads to a\nsmooth estimate of the spectral content. A prototype system of spectral kernels\neach capturing an equal amount of energy is initially defined and subsequently\nwarped using the signal set's ensemble energy spectral density such that the\nresulting subbands each capture an equal amount of ensemble energy. This\napproach accounts at the same time for graph topology and signal features, and\nit provides a meaningful interpretation of subbands in terms of coarse-to-fine\nrepresentations. We also show how more simplified designs of signal-adapted\ndecomposition of graph signals can be adopted based on ensemble energy\nestimates. We show the application of proposed methods on the Minnesota road\ngraph and three different designs of brain graphs derived from neuroimaging\ndata.",

To evaluate the capabilities of LLMs in solving this challenge, we\nintroduce BaxBench, a novel evaluation benchmark consisting of 392 tasks for\nthe generation of backend applications. We focus on backends for three critical\nreasons: (i) they are practically relevant, building the core components of\nmost modern web and cloud software, (ii) they are difficult to get right,\nrequiring multiple functions and files to achieve the desired functionality,\nand (iii) they are security-critical, as they are exposed to untrusted\nthird-parties, making secure solutions that prevent deployment-time attacks an\nimperative. BaxBench validates the functionality of the generated applications\nwith comprehensive test cases, and assesses their security exposure by\nexecuting end-to-end exploits. Our experiments reveal key limitations of\ncurrent LLMs in both functionality and security: (i) even the best model,\nOpenAI o1, achieves a mere 62% on code correctness; (ii) on average, we could\nsuccessfully execute security exploits on around half of the correct programs\ngenerated by each LLM; and (iii) in less popular backend frameworks, models\nfurther struggle to generate correct and secure applications.

While\naudio chord recognition systems have achieved significant accuracy for small\nvocabularies (e.g., major/minor chords), large-vocabulary chord recognition\nremains a challenging problem. This complexity also arises from the inherent\nlong-tail distribution of chords, where rare chord types are underrepresented\nin most datasets, leading to insufficient training samples. Effective chord\nrecognition requires leveraging contextual information from audio sequences,\nyet existing models, such as combinations of convolutional neural networks,\nbidirectional long short-term memory networks, and bidirectional transformers,\nface limitations in capturing long-term dependencies and exhibit suboptimal\nperformance on large-vocabulary chord recognition tasks.

By addressing challenges such as\nclass imbalance through a reweighted loss function and structured chord\nrepresentations, ChordFormer outperforms state-of-the-art models, achieving a\n2% improvement in frame-wise accuracy and a 6% increase in class-wise accuracy\non large-vocabulary chord datasets.

In most GCs, it is generally straightforward to analyse the\nfirst stellar population (standard Y), and the most extreme one (largest Y),\nwhile it is more tricky to look at the \"intermediate\" populations (mildly\nenhanced Y). In this work, we do this for the GCs NGC6752 and NGC2808; wherever\npossible the helium abundance for each stellar populations is constrained by\nusing independent measurements present in the literature. We compare population\nsynthesis models with photometric catalogues from the Hubble Space Telescope\nTreasury survey to derive the parameters of these HB stars. We find that the\nlocation of helium enriched stars on the HB is reproduced only by adopting a\nhigher value of $\\mu$ with respect to the first generation stars in all the\nanalysed stellar populations. We also find that $\\mu$ correlates with the\nhelium enhancement of the populations. This holds for both clusters.

To address these\nissues, we establish two key principles for ensuring generalization and derive\nthe framework LLM-BP accordingly: (1) Unifying the attribute space with\ntask-adaptive embeddings, where we leverage LLM-based encoders and task-aware\nprompting to enhance generalization of the text attribute embeddings; (2)\nDeveloping a generalizable graph information aggregation mechanism, for which\nwe adopt belief propagation with LLM-estimated parameters that adapt across\ngraphs. Evaluations on 11 real-world TAG benchmarks demonstrate that LLM-BP\nsignificantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving 8.10% improvement with\ntask-conditional embeddings and an additional 1.71% gain from adaptive\naggregation.

    "abstract": "Building surrogate models with uncertainty quantification capabilities is\nessential for many engineering applications where randomness, such as\nvariability in material properties, is unavoidable. Polynomial Chaos Expansion\n(PCE) is widely recognized as a to-go method for constructing stochastic\nsolutions in both intrusive and non-intrusive ways. Its application becomes\nchallenging, however, with complex or high-dimensional processes, as achieving\naccuracy requires higher-order polynomials, which can increase computational\ndemands and or the risk of overfitting. Furthermore, PCE requires specialized\ntreatments to manage random variables that are not independent, and these\ntreatments may be problem-dependent or may fail with increasing complexity. In\nthis work, we adopt the spectral expansion formalism used in PCE; however, we\nreplace the classical polynomial basis functions with neural network (NN) basis\nfunctions to leverage their expressivity. To achieve this, we propose an\nalgorithm that identifies NN-parameterized basis functions in a purely\ndata-driven manner, without any prior assumptions about the joint distribution\nof the random variables involved, whether independent or dependent. The\nproposed algorithm identifies each NN-parameterized basis function\nsequentially, ensuring they are orthogonal with respect to the data\ndistribution. The basis functions are constructed directly on the joint\nstochastic variables without requiring a tensor product structure. This\napproach may offer greater flexibility for complex stochastic models, while\nsimplifying implementation compared to the tensor product structures typically\nused in PCE to handle random vectors. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the\nproposed scheme through several numerical examples of varying complexity and\nprovide comparisons with classical PCE.",

By contrast, quasi-local\nhorizons naturally emerge in the course of these simulations, providing\npowerful gauge-invariant tools to extract physics from the numerical outputs.\nThey also lead to interesting results in mathematical GR, providing unforeseen\ninsights. For example, for event horizons we only have a qualitative result\nthat their area cannot decrease, while for quasi-local horizons the increase in\nthe area during a dynamical phase is quantitatively related to local physical\nprocesses at the horizon. In binary black hole mergers, there are interesting\ncorrelations between observables associated with quasi-local horizons and those\ndefined at future null infinity.

It is defined as the ratio between the quantum fluctuation\nrange, which is the spatial extension of the pure-state CM wave function, and\nthe linear size of the body (the space support of the internal, bound-state\nwave function). The two cases where the ratio is smaller than unity or much\nlarger than unity, roughly correspond to the body's CM behaving classically or\nquantum mechanically, respectively. An important notion following from the\nintroduction of quantum ratio is that the elementary particles (thus the\nelectron and the photon) are quantum mechanical. This is so even when the\nenvironment-induced decoherence turns them into a mixed state. Decoherence\n(mixed state) and classical state should not be identified.

Agent- and activity-based\nsimulation affords a natural means to comprehensively assess TCS by more\nrealistically modeling demand, supply, and individual market interactions. We\npropose an integrated simulation framework for modeling a TCS, and implements\nit within the state-of-the-art open-source urban simulation platform\nSimMobility, including: (a) a flexible TCS design that considers multiple trips\nand explicitly accounts for individual trading behaviors; (b) a simulation\nframework that captures the complex interactions between a TCS regulator, the\ntraveler, and the TCS market itself, with the flexibility to test future TCS\ndesigns and relevant mobility models; and (c) a set of simulation experiments\non a large mesoscopic multimodal network combined with a Bayesian Optimization\napproach for TCS optimal design. The experiment results indicate network and\nmarket performance to stabilize over the day-to-day process, showing the\nalignment of our agent-based simulation with the known theoretical properties\nof TCS. We confirm the efficiency of TCS in reducing congestion under the\nadopted market behavioral assumptions and open the door for simulating\ndifferent individual behaviors. We measure how TCS impacts differently the\nlocal network, heterogeneous users, the different travel behaviors, and how\ntesting different TCS designs can avoid negative market trading behaviors.",

Our results reveal that the\ndependence of the angular separation on charge is intricately tied to the\ndeficit angle caused by the global monopole. In particular, we identify three\ncritical values of the global monopole parameter that determine whether the\nangular separation increases monotonically, decreases monotonically, or\nexhibits extrema as the charge varies. A similar complex dependence is found\nfor the flux ratio as a function of the deficit angle, and for the\nmagnification of the first relativistic image as a function of charge. These\nbehaviors contrast sharply with the monotonic changes observed in the absence\nof either a global monopole or charge. Our findings highlight that the effects\nof the charge and global monopole on gravitational lensing cannot be described\nas simple additive contributions. Instead, their combined effects lead to a\nrich and interdependent behavior that enhances our understanding of\nstrong-field gravitational lensing.

    "abstract": "The vehicle dynamics model serves as a vital component of autonomous driving\nsystems, as it describes the temporal changes in vehicle state. In a long\nperiod, researchers have made significant endeavors to accurately model vehicle\ndynamics. Traditional physics-based methods employ mathematical formulae to\nmodel vehicle dynamics, but they are unable to adequately describe complex\nvehicle systems due to the simplifications they entail. Recent advancements in\ndeep learning-based methods have addressed this limitation by directly\nregressing vehicle dynamics. However, the performance and generalization\ncapabilities still require further enhancement. In this letter, we address\nthese problems by proposing a vehicle dynamics correction system that leverages\ndeep neural networks to correct the state residuals of a physical model instead\nof directly estimating the states. This system greatly reduces the difficulty\nof network learning and thus improves the estimation accuracy of vehicle\ndynamics. Furthermore, we have developed a novel Transformer-based dynamics\nresidual correction network, DyTR. This network implicitly represents state\nresiduals as high-dimensional queries, and iteratively updates the estimated\nresiduals by interacting with dynamics state features. The experiments in\nsimulations demonstrate the proposed system works much better than physics\nmodel, and our proposed DyTR model achieves the best performances on dynamics\nstate residual correction task, reducing the state prediction errors of a\nsimple 3 DoF vehicle model by an average of 92.3% and 59.9% in two dataset,\nrespectively.",

While the diffusion model (DM) has\nbeen broadly deployed in public over the past few years, the understanding of\nits backdoor vulnerability is still in its infancy compared to the extensive\nstudies in discriminative models. Recently, many different backdoor attack and\ndefense methods have been proposed for DMs, but a comprehensive benchmark for\nbackdoor learning on DMs is still lacking. This absence makes it difficult to\nconduct fair comparisons and thorough evaluations of the existing approaches,\nthus hindering future research progress. To address this issue, we propose\n\\textit{BackdoorDM}, the first comprehensive benchmark designed for backdoor\nlearning on DMs. It comprises nine state-of-the-art (SOTA) attack methods, four\nSOTA defense strategies, and three useful visualization analysis tools. We\nfirst systematically classify and formulate the existing literature in a\nunified framework, focusing on three different backdoor attack types and five\nbackdoor target types, which are restricted to a single type in discriminative\nmodels. Then, we systematically summarize the evaluation metrics for each type\nand propose a unified backdoor evaluation method based on multimodal large\nlanguage model (MLLM). Finally, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation and\nhighlight several important conclusions. We believe that BackdoorDM will help\novercome current barriers and contribute to building a trustworthy artificial\nintelligence generated content (AIGC) community.

    "abstract": "Participatory budgeting (PB) is a form of citizen participation that allows\ncitizens to decide how public funds are spent. Through an election, citizens\nexpress their preferences on various projects (spending proposals). A voting\nmechanism then determines which projects will be approved. The Method of Equal\nShares (MES) is the state of the art algorithm for a proportional, voting based\napproach to participatory budgeting and has been implemented in cities across\nPoland and Switzerland. A significant drawback of MES is that it is not\n\\textit{exhaustive} meaning that it often leaves a portion of the budget\nunspent that could be used to fund additional projects. To address this, in\npractice the algorithm is combined with a completion heuristic - most often the\n``add-one\" heuristic which artificially increases the budget until a\nheuristically chosen threshold. This heuristic is computationally inefficient\nand will become computationally impractical if PB is employed on a larger\nscale. We propose the more efficient \\textsc{add-opt} heuristic for Exact Equal\nShares (EES), a variation of MES that is known to retain many of its desirable\nproperties. We solve the problem of identifying the next budget for which the\noutcome for EES changes in $O(mn)$ time for cardinal utilities and $O(m^2n)$\ntime for uniform utilities, where $m$ is the number of projects and $n$ is the\nnumber of voters. Our solution to this problem inspires the efficient\n\\textsc{add-opt} heuristic which bypasses the need to search through each\nintermediary budget. We perform comprehensive experiments on real-word PB\ninstances from Pabulib and show that completed EES outcomes usually match the\nproportion of budget spent by completed MES outcomes. Furthermore, the\n\\textsc{add-opt} heuristic matches the proportion of budget spend by add-one\nfor EES.",

Hence, if the thickness of an\nantiferromagnetic film is of the order of tens of nm, electric field induced\neffects cannot be neglected. Here, we theoretically study the THz electric\nfield induced spin dynamics in the metallic antiferromagnet\n$\\mathrm{Mn}_{2}\\mathrm{Au}$, whose spin arrangements allow it to exhibit a\nlinear magnetoelectric effect. We show that the THz magnetoelectric torque in\nmetallic antiferromagnets is proportional to the time derivative of the\npolarization induced by the THz electric field. Our simulations reveal that the\nmagnetoelectric driven spin dynamics is indeed not negligible, and for a fair\nexplanation of previously published experimental results in\n$\\mathrm{Mn}_{2}\\mathrm{Au}$ competition between THz magnetoelectric and N\\'eel\nspin-orbit torques must be taken into account. Thus, it is shown that even in\nmetallic antiferromagnets the THz magnetoelectric effect on spins can be strong\nand thus cannot be neglected.",

    "abstract": "Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) typically relies on producing large\nsets of input-output pairs. Yet for a given question, there can be many valid\noutputs. In practice, these outputs are often derived by distilling knowledge\nfrom teacher models, and they can vary depending on the specific teacher model\nor prompting strategy employed. Recent findings show that how these training\noutputs are generated can significantly affect the performance of the\nfine-tuned model, raising an important question: how do we pick the best data\ngeneration method from among numerous possibilities? Rather than exhaustively\ntraining and evaluating on each candidate, this paper proposes a scalable\napproximate method that assesses a small subset of generated data to estimate\nits suitability for a specific target LLM. Our central idea is that effective\noutputs should be familiar to the target LLM. While previous work measures\nfamiliarity with perplexity, we find that perplexity might be suboptimal in\ncharacterizing familiarity through empirical analyses and practical\nobservations. To address this, we introduce self-aligned perplexity, a novel\nmetric capturing how closely candidate outputs adhere to the target LLM's own\nstyle and reasoning patterns. In this way, we can identify the most effective\ngeneration strategy on a small sample, then apply it to produce the complete\ntraining set. We demonstrate that training on data generated by the chosen\nmethod yields significant improvements across diverse reasoning-focused\nbenchmarks, particularly in cases where different candidate methods lead to\nhighly divergent training outcomes.

    "abstract": "Depth estimation plays a pivotal role in advancing human-robot interactions,\nespecially in indoor environments where accurate 3D scene reconstruction is\nessential for tasks like navigation and object handling. Monocular depth\nestimation, which relies on a single RGB camera, offers a more affordable\nsolution compared to traditional methods that use stereo cameras or LiDAR.\nHowever, despite recent progress, many monocular approaches struggle with\naccurately defining depth boundaries, leading to less precise reconstructions.\nIn response to these challenges, this study introduces a novel depth estimation\nframework that leverages latent space features within a deep convolutional\nneural network to enhance the precision of monocular depth maps. The proposed\nmodel features dual encoder-decoder architecture, enabling both color-to-depth\nand depth-to-depth transformations. This structure allows for refined depth\nestimation through latent space encoding. To further improve the accuracy of\ndepth boundaries and local features, a new loss function is introduced. This\nfunction combines latent loss with gradient loss, helping the model maintain\nthe integrity of depth boundaries. The framework is thoroughly tested using the\nNYU Depth V2 dataset, where it sets a new benchmark, particularly excelling in\ncomplex indoor scenarios. The results clearly show that this approach\neffectively reduces depth ambiguities and blurring, making it a promising\nsolution for applications in human-robot interaction and 3D scene\nreconstruction.",

Therefore, the generation of mode degradation-suppressed STOVs\n(MDS-STOVs) is of significant for both practical applications and theoretical\nstudies.

However, the conventional KD methods endure\nthe distribution mismatch issue between the teacher and student models, leading\nto the poor performance of distillation. For instance, the widely-used KL-based\nmethods suffer the mode-averaging and mode-collapsing problems, since the\nmismatched probabitliy distribution between both models. Previous studies\nmainly optimize this issue via different distance calculations towards the\ndistribution of both models. Unfortunately, the distribution mismatch issue\nstill exists in the early stage of the distillation. Hence, to reduce the\nimpact of distribution mismatch, we propose a simple yet efficient method,\nnamed Warmup-Distill, which aligns the distillation of the student to that of\nthe teacher in advance of distillation. Specifically, we first detect the\ndistribution of the student model in practical scenarios with its internal\nknowledge, and then modify the knowledge with low probability via the teacher\nas the checker. Consequently, Warmup-Distill aligns the internal student's\nknowledge to that of the teacher, which expands the distribution of the student\nwith the teacher's, and assists the student model to learn better in the\nsubsequent distillation. Experiments on the seven benchmarks demonstrate that\nWarmup-Distill could provide a warmup student more suitable for distillation,\nwhich outperforms the vanilla student by as least +0.4 averaged score among all\nbenchmarks. Noteably, with the assistance of Warmup-Distill, the distillation\non the math task could yield a further improvement, at most +1.9% accuracy.",

By performing mean-field calculations for an effective\nlocalized model consisting of two Kramers doublets, we construct the\nlow-temperature phase diagram in a static external magnetic field.\nConsequently, we find that a square-shaped skyrmion lattice with the skyrmion\nnumber of one appears in the intermediate-field region when the crystal field\nsplitting between the two doublets is small. Furthermore, we identify another\ndouble-$Q$ state with a nonzero net scalar chirality at zero- and low-field\nregions, which is attributed to the help of the multi-orbital degree of\nfreedom. Our results offer another route to search for skyrmion-hosting\nmaterials in centrosymmetric $f$-electron tetragonal systems with multi-orbital\ndegrees of freedom, e.g., Ce-based compounds.

By\nimposing the appropriate energy conditions and ensuring the absence of\ncurvature singularities, we delineate the parameter space in which the dense\ncore mimics key gravitational features of black holes while exhibiting unique\ndeviations. We derive the photon orbital equation and calculate deflection\nangles, clearly distinguishing between weak- and strong-deflection regimes.\nFurthermore, we construct a mapping from the illuminated, geometrically thin\naccretion disk onto the observer's screen -- focusing on the isoradial curves\ncorresponding to a representative source ring. For compactness values below a\ncritical threshold, only a finite number of disk images are formed. In this\nrange, their secondary and higher-order images typically display double-loop\nstructures, with each loop individually capturing the entire source ring.\nNotably, the highest-order image sometimes appears as a single, crescent-shaped\nloop that does not enclose the screen's center, implying the existence of a\ncutoff angle that restricts the imaged portion of the source ring. In contrast,\nfor compactness values above the critical threshold, an infinite sequence of\ndouble-loop structures appears -- a behavior closely linked to the presence of\na photon sphere.

Among common HRC tasks,\nhuman-to-robot object handovers have been studied extensively for planning the\nrobot's actions during object reception, assuming the human intention for\nobject handover. However, distinguishing handover intentions from other actions\nhas received limited attention. Most research on handovers has focused on\nvisually detecting motion trajectories, which often results in delays or false\ndetections when trajectories overlap. This paper investigates whether human\nintentions for object handovers are reflected in non-movement-based\nphysiological signals. We conduct a multimodal analysis comparing three data\nmodalities: electroencephalogram (EEG), gaze, and hand-motion signals. Our\nstudy aims to distinguish between handover-intended human motions and\nnon-handover motions in an HRC setting, evaluating each modality's performance\nin predicting and classifying these actions before and after human movement\ninitiation. We develop and evaluate human intention detectors based on these\nmodalities, comparing their accuracy and timing in identifying handover\nintentions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to\nsystematically develop and test intention detectors across multiple modalities\nwithin the same experimental context of human-robot handovers. Our analysis\nreveals that handover intention can be detected from all three modalities.\nNevertheless, gaze signals are the earliest as well as the most accurate to\nclassify the motion as intended for handover or non-handover.",

    "abstract": "RowHammer is a major read disturbance mechanism in DRAM where repeatedly\naccessing (hammering) a row of DRAM cells (DRAM row) induces bitflips in\nphysically nearby DRAM rows (victim rows). To ensure robust DRAM operation,\nstate-of-the-art mitigation mechanisms restore the charge in potential victim\nrows (i.e., they perform preventive refresh or charge restoration). With newer\nDRAM chip generations, these mechanisms perform preventive refresh more\naggressively and cause larger performance, energy, or area overheads.\nTherefore, it is essential to develop a better understanding and in-depth\ninsights into the preventive refresh to secure real DRAM chips at low cost. In\nthis paper, our goal is to mitigate RowHammer at low cost by understanding the\nimpact of reduced preventive refresh latency on RowHammer. To this end, we\npresent the first rigorous experimental study on the interactions between\nrefresh latency and RowHammer characteristics in real DRAM chips. Our\nexperimental characterization using 388 real DDR4 DRAM chips from three major\nmanufacturers demonstrates that a preventive refresh latency can be\nsignificantly reduced (by 64%). To investigate the impact of reduced preventive\nrefresh latency on system performance and energy efficiency, we reduce the\npreventive refresh latency and adjust the aggressiveness of existing RowHammer\nsolutions by developing a new mechanism, Partial Charge Restoration for\nAggressive Mitigation (PaCRAM). Our results show that PaCRAM reduces the\nperformance and energy overheads induced by five state-of-the-art RowHammer\nmitigation mechanisms with small additional area overhead. Thus, PaCRAM\nintroduces a novel perspective into addressing RowHammer vulnerability at low\ncost by leveraging our experimental observations.

Existing approaches, such as direct fine-tuning and continual\nlearning methods, fail to explicitly address this issue, often compressing\nvisual representations and prioritizing task alignment over visual retention,\nwhich further worsens visual forgetting. To overcome this limitation, we\nintroduce a novel perspective leveraging effective rank to quantify the\ndegradation of visual representation richness, interpreting this degradation\nthrough the information bottleneck principle as excessive compression that\nleads to the degradation of crucial pre-trained visual knowledge. Building on\nthis view, we propose a modality-decoupled gradient descent (MDGD) method that\nregulates gradient updates to maintain the effective rank of visual\nrepresentations while mitigating the over-compression effects described by the\ninformation bottleneck. By explicitly disentangling the optimization of visual\nunderstanding from task-specific alignment, MDGD preserves pre-trained visual\nknowledge while enabling efficient task adaptation. To enable lightweight\ninstruction-tuning, we further develop a memory-efficient fine-tuning approach\nusing gradient masking, which selectively updates a subset of model parameters\nto enable parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), reducing computational\noverhead while preserving rich visual representations.

Future advancements in 2FA technologies, including but not\nlimited to autofill capabilities and the adoption of Fast IDentity Onlines\n(FIDO) protocols, offer possible directions for more inclusive authentication\nmechanisms. However, ongoing research is necessary to address the evolving\nneeds of users with disabilities and to mitigate new security challenges. This\npaper proposes a collaborative approach among stakeholders to ensure that\nsecurity improvements do not compromise accessibility. It promotes a digital\nenvironment where security and inclusivity mutually reinforce each other.",

Furthermore, we observe that employing centerline masks\npredicted by GraphMorph significantly reduces false positives in the\nsegmentation task, which is achieved by a simple yet effective post-processing\nstrategy. The efficacy of our method in the centerline extraction and\nsegmentation tasks has been substantiated through experimental evaluations\nacross various datasets. Source code will be released soon.",

Our study reveals that traditional quantization\nmethods, which assume inter-layer independence, are ineffective for\nnon-generalized INR-VC models due to significant dependencies across layers. To\naddress this, we redefine variable-rate INR-VC as a mixed-precision\nquantization problem and establish a theoretical framework for sensitivity\ncriteria aimed at simplified, fine-grained rate control.

In addition, the lack of large-scale\nGQA datasets with subjective scores, which are always imprecise, biased, and\ninconsistent, also hinders the development of learning-based GQA metrics.\nDriven by these limitations, this paper proposes a no-reference geometry-only\nquality assessment approach based on list-wise rank learning, termed LRL-GQA,\nwhich comprises of a geometry quality assessment network (GQANet) and a\nlist-wise rank learning network (LRLNet). The proposed LRL-GQA formulates the\nno-reference GQA as a list-wise rank problem, with the objective of directly\noptimizing the entire quality ordering. Specifically, a large dataset\ncontaining a variety of geometry-only distortions is constructed first, named\nLRL dataset, in which each sample is label-free but coupled with quality\nranking information. Then, the GQANet is designed to capture intrinsic\nmulti-scale patch-wise geometric features in order to predict a quality index\nfor each point cloud. After that, the LRLNet leverages the LRL dataset and a\nlikelihood loss to train the GQANet and ranks the input list of degraded point\nclouds according to their distortion levels. In addition, the pre-trained\nGQANet can be fine-tuned further to obtain absolute quality scores.\nExperimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed\nno-reference LRL-GQA method compared with existing full-reference GQA metrics.",

In this paper we show that adversarially robust CLIP\nmodels, called R-CLIP$_\\textrm{F}$, obtained by unsupervised adversarial\nfine-tuning induce a better and adversarially robust perceptual metric that\noutperforms existing metrics in a zero-shot setting, and further matches the\nperformance of state-of-the-art metrics while being robust after fine-tuning.\nMoreover, our perceptual metric achieves strong performance on related tasks\nsuch as robust image-to-image retrieval, which becomes especially relevant when\napplied to \"Not Safe for Work\" (NSFW) content detection and dataset filtering.\nWhile standard perceptual metrics can be easily attacked by a small\nperturbation completely degrading NSFW detection, our robust perceptual metric\nmaintains high accuracy under an attack while having similar performance for\nunperturbed images. Finally, perceptual metrics induced by robust CLIP models\nhave higher interpretability: feature inversion can show which images are\nconsidered similar, while text inversion can find what images are associated to\na given prompt.

Here we report on new $3.55$\nmicrometer interferometric observations of this source with the Multi Aperture\nMid-Infrared Spectroscopic Experiment (MATISSE) at the Very Large Telescope\nInterferometer (VLTI). To model the four MATISSE observations obtained between\n2020 and 2023, we constructed a time-dependent interferometric model of the\nsystem, using the oimodeler software. The model consists of an asymmetric ring\nand two point sources on a Keplerian orbit. Our best-fit model consists of a\ncircumbinary ring with a diameter of $0.86$ au ($8.1$ mas), featuring a strong\nazimuthal asymmetry. We found that the position angle of the asymmetry changes\ntens of degrees between the MATISSE epochs. The ring is relatively narrow, with\na full width at half maximum (FWHM) of $\\sim$$0.13$ au ($1.23$ mas). The\npresence of circumstellar dust emission so close to the binary is unexpected,\nas previous hydrodynamic simulations predicted an inner disk cavity with a\ndiameter of $\\sim$$4$ au ($\\sim$$37.5$ mas). Thus, we argue that the narrow\nenvelope of material we detected is probably not a gravitationally stable\ncircumbinary ring, but may be part of tidal accretion streamers channeling\nmaterial from the inner edge of the disk toward the stars.",

    "abstract": "Non-cooperative game theory provides a robust framework for analyzing\ndistributed resource allocation in multi-user wireless networks, with\n\\emph{Iterative Water-Filling} (IWF) emerging as a canonical solution for power\ncontrol problems. Although classical fixed-point theorems guarantee the\nexistence of a Nash Equilibrium (NE) under mild concavity and compactness\nconditions, the convergence of practical iterative algorithms to that\nequilibrium remains a challenging endeavor. This challenge intensifies under\nvarying update schedules, interference regimes, and imperfections such as\nchannel estimation errors or feedback delay.\n  In this paper, we present an in-depth examination of IWF in multi-user\nsystems under three different update schemes: (1) synchronous \\emph{sequential}\nupdates, (2) synchronous \\emph{simultaneous} updates, and (3) \\emph{totally\nasynchronous} updates. We first formulate the water-filling operator in a\nmulti-carrier environment, then recast the iterative process as a fixed-point\nproblem. Using contraction mapping principles, we demonstrate sufficient\nconditions under which IWF converges to a unique NE and highlight how spectral\nradius constraints, diagonal dominance, and careful step-size selection are\npivotal for guaranteeing convergence. We further discuss robustness to\nmeasurement noise, partial updates, and network scaling to emphasize the\npractical viability of these schemes. This comprehensive analysis unifies\ndiverse threads in the literature while offering novel insights into\nasynchronous implementations. Our findings enable network designers to\nascertain system parameters that foster both stable convergence and efficient\nspectrum usage.",

Previous research on LRP without\npredefined depots is scant and predominantly relies on heuristic algorithms\nthat iteratively attempt depot placements across a planar area. Such approaches\nlack the ability to proactively generate depot locations that meet specific\ngeographic requirements, revealing a notable gap in current research landscape.\nTo bridge this gap, we propose a data-driven generative DRL framework, designed\nto proactively generate depots for LRP without predefined depot candidates,\nsolely based on customer requests data which include geographic and demand\ninformation. It can operate in two distinct modes: direct generation of exact\ndepot locations, and the creation of a multivariate Gaussian distribution for\nflexible depots sampling. By extracting depots' geographic pattern from\ncustomer requests data, our approach can dynamically respond to logistical\nneeds, identifying high-quality depot locations that further reduce total\nrouting costs compared to traditional methods. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that, for a same group of customer requests, compared with those\ndepots identified through random attempts, our framework can proactively\ngenerate depots that lead to superior solution routes with lower routing cost.\nThe implications of our framework potentially extend into real-world\napplications, particularly in emergency medical rescue and disaster relief\nlogistics, where rapid establishment and adjustment of depot locations are\nparamount, showcasing its potential in addressing LRP for dynamic and\nunpredictable environments.",

In well STM imaged crystallographic\nsurface planes, the local DOS has been probed for different surface areas at\ntemperatures above and below the critical temperature of superconducting or\ninsulating spin-density wave states. While a rather homogeneous superconducting\nstate is expected in the bulk from previous studies, depending on the degree of\ndisorder introduced by cleavage in the anion lattice, an inhomogeneous granular\nstate is predominantly observed at the surface. A pronounced linear V-shape\nprofile of the local DOS is observed from intermediate to the lowest energy\nscale in the less disordered superconducting surface areas. This supports the\nexistence of an unconventional d-wave like order parameter with nodes at low\nenergy, which is preceded by more energetic fluctuations attributed to quantum\ncriticality of the material.

It abstracts away the complexities of working with Docker commands,\nallowing users to interact with containers more intuitively. It can be used to\nmanage a number of docker engines from one place making it easy to control and\nmonitor all the docker resources. Its performance, security, and scalability\nare evaluated using various testing techniques, and the results are found\nsatisfactory.

We aim to infer the mode population of density fluctuations\nobserved by radio occultation, which has all been attributed to slow\nmagnetoacoustic waves. We compare the radio occultation observations conducted\nin 2016 using the JAXA's Venus orbiter Akatsuki with the MHD simulation. The\ntime-frequency analysis was applied to the density fluctuations observed by the\nradio occultation and those reproduced in the MHD model. The time-spatial\nspectrum of the density fluctuation in the model exhibits two components that\nare considered to be fast and slow magnetoacoustic waves. The fast\nmagnetoacoustic waves in the model tend to have periods shorter than the slow\nmagnetoacoustic waves, and the superposition of these modes has a broadened\nspectrum extending in the range of approximately 20$-$1000 s, which resembles\nthat of the observed waves. Based on this comparison, it is probable that the\ndensity oscillations observed by radio occultation include fast and slow\nmagnetoacoustic waves, and that fast magnetoacoustic waves are predominant at\nshort periods and slow magnetoacoustic waves are prevalent at long periods.\nThis is qualitatively similar to the results of the mode decomposition obtained\nfrom the PSP's first perihelion at more distance regions.",

Whereas solving this type of transfer is\ngenerally computationally expensive, we simulate here tens of millions of\ntransfers orbits, for different times of flight, Jacobi constants and spatial\nlocation on the manifold. We are able to reduce computational cost by taking\nadvantage of the efficient procedure given by the Theory of Functional\nConnections for solving boundary value problems, represented with special\nconstraints created to the purposes of this work. We develop here the\nmethodology for constructing these transfers, and apply it to find a low-cost\ntransfer from an orbit around the Earth to a stable manifold and another\nlow-cost transfer from an unstable manifold to an orbit around the Moon. In the\nend, we obtain an innovative Earth-to-Moon transfer that involves a gravity\nassist maneuver with the Moon and allows a long stationed stage at the Lyapunov\norbit around $L_1$ which can be used for designing multi-purpose missions for\nextended periods of time with low fuel costs.

The complexity index of a rule is defined as the number of covalent\nbonds involved in the rearrangement.

While\nshock-related phenomena are prominent, unsteady pressure fluctuations can also\narise in subsonic regimes from wake interactions. Traditional methods like\nUnsteady Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (URANS) simulations are accurate but\ncomputationally expensive. To address this, a novel deep learning-based Reduced\nOrder Model (ROM) is proposed, built on a database of URANS simulations, to\npredict unsteady pressure fields on turbine rotor blades at a fraction of the\ncost. The model consists of a Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) integrated with a\nGated Recurrent Unit (GRU) to capture time-series data, overcoming the\nlimitations of traditional linear ROMs in capturing nonlinear phenomena, such\nas moving shocks. The goal is to develop a ROM that accurately reproduces\nunsteady pressure fields from URANS simulations while reducing computational\ncosts. The ROM is applied to the Turbine Aero-Thermal External Flows (TATEF2)\nproject configuration, a representative test case in turbomachinery research.\nModel performance is evaluated using machine learning quality metrics and\ndesign-oriented criteria, including the accuracy of the first harmonic in the\nFourier transform of the unsteady pressure field.

It is a central tool of the probabilistic\nmethod, since it can be used to show that combinatorial objects satisfying some\ndesirable properties must exist. While the original proof was existential,\nsubsequent work has shown algorithms for the Lov\\'asz Local Lemma: that is, in\ncircumstances in which the lemma proves the existence of some object, these\nalgorithms can constructively find such an object. One main strand of these\nalgorithms, which began with Moser and Tardos's well-known result (JACM 2010),\ninvolves iteratively resampling the dependent variables of satisfied bad events\nuntil none remain satisfied.\n  In this paper, we present a novel analysis that can be applied to\nresampling-style Lov\\'asz Local Lemma algorithms.

In particular, Jiang-Jiang's\nmathematical result shows that, if the initial free boundary is flat, the way\nthe elastic deformation under the large elasticity coefficient $\\kappa$ acts on\nthe free boundary prevents the natural tendency of the fluid to form\nsingularities, even when the initial velocity is properly large. However it is\nnot clear whether their result can be extended to the corresponding 3D case. In\nthis paper, we further find a similar result in the 3D stratified (immiscible)\ncompressible Hookean viscoelastic fluids in an infinite slab with two\nrestrictive conditions: that the elasticity coefficients of two fluids are\nequal, and that the initial density functions satisfy the asymptotic stability\ncondition in Lagrangian coordinates. These two restrictive conditions in the\ncompressible case contribute us to avoid the essential obstacles that would be\nfaced in the extension of Jiang-Jiang's result from two dimensions to our 3D\ncase. In addition, we can further obtain a new result regarding the vanishing\nphenomena of the nonlinear interactions of solutions with the fixed initial\nvelocity and the initial zero perturbation deformation. Such a new result\nroughly presents that the solutions of the problem considered by us can be\napproximated by the ones of a linear problem for sufficiently large $\\kappa$.",

We cross-matched the Gaia DR3 measurements with the\ncatalogue of long-period red giant candidates from the Gaia FPR, having\nphotometric and radial velocity variability information. Combined with the\nphoto-geometric distances, the extinction, bolometric magnitude, luminosity,\nspectroscopic radius and mass were estimated. ELL variables are characterized\nto be low to intermediate-mass stars, with radii as large as the Roche lobe\nradius of the binary. Eccentricities tend to be lower for primary stars with\nsmaller radii, as the expected result of tidal circularization. Combined with\nthe orbital properties, estimates for the minimum mass of the companion agree\nwith the scenario of a low-mass compact object as the secondary star. There are\nat least 14 ELL binaries with orbital periods and masses compatible with model\npredictions for Type Ia SN progenitors. For the rotational variables, their\norbital periods, enhanced chromospheric activity, smaller radii and low mass\npoint to a different type of binaries than the original ELL sample. The\nvelocity dispersion is much higher in ELL than in rotational binaries, probably\nindicating older/younger dynamical ages. The enhanced [$\\alpha$/Fe] abundances\nfor some of the ELL binaries resemble the population of young $\\alpha$-rich\nbinaries in the thick disk. An episode of mass transfer in those systems may\nhave produced the enhanced $\\alpha$ abundances, and the enhanced [Ce/Fe]\nabundances reported in a few ELL binaries.

The prevailing driving\nworld model mainly build on video prediction model. Although these models can\nproduce high-fidelity video sequences with advanced diffusion-based generator,\nthey are constrained by their predictive duration and overall generalization\ncapabilities. In this paper, we explore to solve this problem by combining\ngeneration loss with MAE-style feature-level context learning.

    "abstract": "We investigate the enhancement of Gilbert damping at 2DHG/ferromagnetic\ninsulator (FI) interfaces, where spin pumping from the FI layer injects spins\ninto the 2DHG, and cubic Rashba spin-orbit coupling (RSOC) significantly boosts\nspin relaxation and spin-pumping efficiency compared to 2DEG systems. The\ndominant contribution to spin damping arises from interband transitions which\ndoes exhibits conductivity-like behavior as the temperature, \\( T \\to 0 \\). Our\nresults reveal that damping remains stronger than in 2DEG due to the persistent\ninfluence of cubic RSOC. The interplay between RSOC and magnon absorption\nbroadens the spectral response, with the damping peak shifting more notably at\nhigher temperatures. Stronger RSOC expands the magnon interaction phase space,\nthus widening the damping spectrum. A key observation emerges with the Fermi\nlevel (\\(E_f\\)): a finite \\(E_f\\) sustains spin imbalance and enhances damping,\nwhereas \\(E_f = 0\\) suppresses it, unlike in 2DEG. The electric field\ntunability of RSOC enables real-time control over spin relaxation and angular\nmomentum transfer, offering a pathway toward voltage-controlled spintronic\ndevices.

In two dimensions the DNUC present small deviations regarding\nconventional droplets. For the one-dimensional DNUC the handling of the\nnonuniversal effects to the interactions achieves a qualitative agreement with\nthe trend of some available Monte Carlo data in usual droplets. We also\nintroduce some improved Gross-Pitaevskii equations to describe self-trapped\nDNUC in three, two and one dimension. We briefly discuss some aspects at low\ntemperature regarding nonuniversal corrections to the interactions in Bose-Bose\ngases. We derive the dependencies on the nonuniversal contribution to the\ninteractions but also on the difference between intra- and inter-species\ncoupling constants. This last dependence crucially affect the three- and the\ntwo-dimensional DNUC driving thus to a thermal-induced instability.

The approach shows noise levels near $1 \\times 10^{-4}$ in\nthe relative deviatoric strain norm and in the relative rotation angles on\nnominally strain-free regions of the silicon wafer. The strain and rotation\nmeasurements are interpreted by finite element simulations. While confirming\nthe basic findings of previously published studies, the present approach\nenables a potential reduction in the necessary pattern data size by about two\norders of magnitude. We estimate that pattern resolutions in the order of\n$256\\times256$ pixels should be enough to solve a majority of EBSD analysis\ntasks using pattern matching techniques.",

For Be stars, it might be the cause of their spin up, and thus part\nof the mechanism behind the formation of their viscous decretion disks.\nDetecting companions in systems with Be stars is challenging, making it\ndifficult to obtain observational constraints on their binary fraction. We\nexplore the effects of a binary companion in a system with a Be star, from disk\nformation to quasi steady-state using smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH)\nsimulations of coplanar, circular binary systems. High spatial resolution is\nachieved by adopting particle splitting in the SPH code, as well as a more\nrealistic description of the secondary star and the disk viscosity. The tidal\nforces considerably affect the Be disk, forming distinct regions in the system,\nwith observational consequences that can be used to infer the presence of a\notherwise undetectable companion. With the upgraded code, we can probe a region\napproximately 4 times larger than previously possible. We describe the\nconfiguration and kinematics of each part of the system, and provide a summary\nof their expected observational signals. Material that enters the Roche lobe of\nthe companion is partially captured by it, forming a rotationally supported,\ndisk-like structure. Material not accreted escapes and forms a circumbinary\ndisk around the system. This is the first work to describe the region beyond\nthe truncation region of the Be disk and its observational consequences with\ndetail. We argue that observational features of previously unclear origin, such\nas the intermittent shell features and emission features of HR 2142 and HD\n55606, originate in areas beyond the truncation region. This new understanding\nof the behavior of disks in Be binaries will allow not just for better\ninterpretation of existing data, but also for the planning of future\nobservations.",

A\ncomprehensive analysis of DW dynamics across regimes such as creep, depinning,\nand flow is well established in ferromagnetic systems but remains lacking in\nAFM-coupled systems. In this study, we explore the nature of DW dynamics in\nsynthetic ferrimagnetic multilayers composed of Pt|Co|Tb|Al for different Tb\nthickness, focusing on the underlying pinning parameters, and on the different\nregimes of DW dynamics driven by spin-orbit torques (SOTs). We find that due to\nthe AFM coupling between Co and Tb, the magnetic moment of Tb increases with Tb\nthickness resulting in a reduced saturation magnetization and an enhanced\ndepinning field. The DW disorder interaction is found to vary weakly with the\nAFM coupling between Co and Tb, while the complete withdrawal of the Tb layer\nstrongly increases the anisotropy and the DW pinning. Furthermore, we propose a\nnovel approach to measure effective SOTs by comparing depinning transitions in\ncurrent and field-induced DW motion.

The abundance of\nuser-generated reviews on social media encapsulates nuanced perceptions and\nfeelings associated with different places, offering rich insights into\nsegregation. However, leveraging this data poses significant challenges due to\nits vast volume, ambiguity, and confluence of diverse perspectives. To tackle\nthese challenges, we propose using Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate\nonline review mining for segregation prediction. We design a Reflective LLM\nCoder to digest social media content into insights consistent with real-world\nfeedback, and eventually produce a codebook capturing key dimensions that\nsignal segregation experience, such as cultural resonance and appeal,\naccessibility and convenience, and community engagement and local involvement.\nGuided by the codebook, LLMs can generate both informative review summaries and\nratings for segregation prediction. Moreover, we design a\nREasoning-and-EMbedding (RE'EM) framework, which combines the reasoning and\nembedding capabilities of language models to integrate multi-channel features\nfor segregation prediction. Experiments on real-world data demonstrate that our\nframework greatly improves prediction accuracy, with a 22.79% elevation in R2\nand a 9.33% reduction in MSE. The derived codebook is generalizable across\nthree different cities, consistently improving prediction accuracy.

In this study, we aim at modeling the distortion due\nto aliasing and show that a downsampled/upsampled image after an interpolation\nprocess can be very well approximated through the application of isotropic\nGaussian low-pass filtering to the original image.

Extensive experiments across multiple model\npairs, watermarking schemes and hyper-parameter settings demonstrate that both\nTP and WN thoroughly eliminate inherited watermarks, with WN achieving this\nwhile maintaining knowledge transfer efficiency and low computational overhead.\nGiven the ongoing deployment of watermarking techniques in production LLMs,\nthese findings emphasize the urgent need for more robust defense strategies.\nOur code is available at\nhttps://github.com/THU-BPM/Watermark-Radioactivity-Attack.",

    "abstract": "Target identification for tractography studies requires solid anatomical\nknowledge validated by an extensive literature review across species for each\nseed structure to be studied. Manual literature review to identify targets for\na given seed region is tedious and potentially subjective. Therefore,\ncomplementary approaches would be useful. We propose to use text-mining models\nto automatically suggest potential targets from the neuroscientific literature,\nfull-text articles and abstracts, so that they can be used for anatomical\nconnection studies and more specifically for tractography. We applied\ntext-mining models to three structures: two well-studied structures, since\nvalidated deep brain stimulation targets, the internal globus pallidus and the\nsubthalamic nucleus and, the nucleus accumbens, an exploratory target for\ntreating psychiatric disorders. We performed a systematic review of the\nliterature to document the projections of the three selected structures and\ncompared it with the targets proposed by text-mining models, both in rat and\nprimate (including human). We ran probabilistic tractography on the nucleus\naccumbens and compared the output with the results of the text-mining models\nand literature review. Overall, text-mining the literature could find three\ntimes as many targets as two man-weeks of curation could. The overall\nefficiency of the text-mining against literature review in our study was 98%\nrecall (at 36% precision), meaning that over all the targets for the three\nselected seeds, only one target has been missed by text-mining. We demonstrate\nthat connectivity for a structure of interest can be extracted from a very\nlarge amount of publications and abstracts. We believe this tool will be useful\nin helping the neuroscience community to facilitate connectivity studies of\nparticular brain regions.

Striving towards this goal,\nrecent efforts aim to advance the integration of 5G into Time-Sensitive\nNetworking (TSN). However, we show that IEEE 802.1Qbv TSN schedulers that are\nunattuned to 5G packet delay variations may jeopardize any reliability\nguarantees provided by the 5G system. We demonstrate this on a case where a\n99.99% reliability in the inner 5G network diminishes to below 10% when looking\nat end-to-end communication in TSN. In this paper, we overcome this shortcoming\nby introducing Full Interleaving Packet Scheduling (FIPS) as a\nwireless-friendly IEEE 802.1Qbv scheduler. To the best of our knowledge, FIPS\nis the first to provide formal end-to-end QoS guarantees in wireless TSN. FIPS\nallows a controlled batching of TSN streams, which improves schedulability in\nterms of the number of wireless TSN streams by a factor of up to x45. Even in\nfailure cases, FIPS isolates the otherwise cascading QoS violations to the\naffected streams and protects all other streams.

This both explains the method's often remarkable performance in\ndisentangling the factors of variation of the data, as well as opens up\npossibilities of recovering its distribution while having access to samples\nonly. In settings where the score itself has physical meaning - such as when\nthe data obeys the Boltzmann distribution - we demonstrate that the method can\nrecover scientifically important quantities such as the minimum free energy\npath. Second, we prove that if the data lies on a manifold that can be\napproximated by the encoder, the optimal encoder's components beyond the\ndimension of the manifold will carry absolutely no additional information about\nthe data distribution. This promises potentially new ways of determining the\nnumber of relevant dimensions of the data. The results thus demonstrate that\nthe DPA elegantly combines two often disparate goals of unsupervised learning:\nthe learning of the data distribution and the learning of the intrinsic data\ndimensionality.",

    "abstract": "To date only very few meteor clusters have been instrumentally recorded. This\nmeans that every new detection is an important contribution to the\nunderstanding of these phenomena, which are thought to be evidence of the\nmeteoroid fragmentation in the Solar System. On 31 May 2022, at 6:48:55 UT, a\ncluster consisting of 52 meteors was detected within 8.5 seconds during a\npredicted outburst of the tau-Herculid meteor shower. The aim of this paper is\nto reconstruct the atmospheric trajectories of the meteors and use the\ncollected information to deduce the origin of the cluster. The meteors were\nrecorded by two video cameras during an airborne campaign. Due to only the\nsingle station observation, their trajectories were estimated under the\nassumption that they belonged to the meteor shower. The mutual positions of the\nfragments, together with their photometric masses, was used to model the\nprocesses leading to the formation of the cluster. The physical properties of\nthe cluster meteors are very similar to the properties of the tau-Herculids.\nThis finding confirms the assumption of the shower membership used for the\ncomputation of atmospheric trajectories. This was the third cluster that we\nhave studied in detail, but the first one where we do not see the mass\nseparation of the particles. The cluster is probably less than 2.5 days old,\nwhich is too short for such a complete mass separation. Such an age would imply\ndisintegration due to thermal stress. However, we cannot rule out an age of\nonly a few hours, which would allow for other fragmentation mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "We investigate the evolution of spread over three days in a numerical\nensemble experiment starting from tiny initial condition uncertainty. We\nsimulate a real event during which three mesoscale convective systems occur in\nclose proximity to the midlatitude jet. The spread evolution is compared with\nan existing conceptual three-stage model. Each system follows the first stage,\ncharacterised by development of convective variability. Nevertheless, we find\nsignificant variation among the systems in their propensity to interact with\nthe jet stream, which characterises conceptual stage 2. One exemplary\nconvective system follows the conceptual evolution of Baumgart et al., i.e.,\nconvective uncertainty initially projects onto the jet by upper-tropospheric\noutflow, which further amplifies spread through nonlinear growth as it\npropagates downstream. Rossby-like dispersion in the downstream spread is\nstrongly associated with the convective variability. In contrast, for another\nconvective system, convective variability projects onto the local anticyclonic\nflow aloft. Subsequently, this anticyclonic perturbation hardly (if at all)\nprojects convective uncertainty onto the particularly straight jet stream,\nwhich truncates the conceptual evolution. For the third system, negligible\nfingerprints of second and third stages are identified. Alongside convective\nheating, longwave radiation jointly dominates the spread evolution near the\nconvective systems (as opposed to earlier studies). Longwave-radiative\ntendencies of convective anvils outlive the accompanied heating tendencies and\nextend spatially. Furthermore, we link convective variability of the exemplary\nsystem directly to longwave-radiative tendencies. Therefore, longwave radiation\nappears to contributes substantially to stages 1 and 2 here. Finally, we\nidentify flow dependence of the impact of convection on the jet. (Truncated\nabstract)",

In many practical\napplications, there is a need to impose strict constraints on the motion range\nor trajectory of virtual characters. However, existing methods that rely solely\non textual input face substantial challenges in accurately capturing the user's\nintent, particularly in specifying the desired trajectory. As a result, the\ngenerated motions often lack plausibility and accuracy.

Based on this framework, this paper explores the motion range\nrefinement process in interactive motion generation and proposes a\ntraining-free approach, integrating a Pace Controller and a Kinematic\nSynchronization Adapter. The framework enhances the ability of existing models\nto generate motion that adheres to trajectory by controlling the leader's\nmovement and correcting the follower's motion to align with the leader.\nExperimental results show that the proposed approach, by better leveraging\ntrajectory information, outperforms existing methods in both realism and\naccuracy.",

    "abstract": "Metaphors play a critical role in shaping user experiences with Voice User\nInterfaces (VUIs), yet existing designs often rely on static, human-centric\nmetaphors that fail to adapt to diverse contexts and user needs. This paper\nintroduces Metaphor-Fluid Design, a novel approach that dynamically adjusts\nmetaphorical representations based on conversational use-contexts. We compare\nthis approach to a Default VUI, which characterizes the present implementation\nof commercial VUIs commonly designed around the persona of an assistant,\noffering a uniform interaction style across contexts. In Study 1 (N=130),\nmetaphors were mapped to four key use-contexts-commands, information seeking,\nsociality, and error recovery-along the dimensions of formality and hierarchy,\nrevealing distinct preferences for task-specific metaphorical designs. Study 2\n(N=91) evaluates a Metaphor-Fluid VUI against a Default VUI, showing that the\nMetaphor-Fluid VUI enhances perceived intention to adopt, enjoyment, and\nlikability by aligning better with user expectations for different contexts.\nHowever, individual differences in metaphor preferences highlight the need for\npersonalization. These findings challenge the one-size-fits-all paradigm of VUI\ndesign and demonstrate the potential of Metaphor-Fluid Design to create more\nadaptive and engaging human-AI interactions.",

    "abstract": "We study quantum correlations between interacting photons realized through\nco-propagating Rydberg polaritons. We show that the evolution of the $n$-photon\nwavefunction is governed by a multiband dispersion featuring one massive mode\nand $n-1$ degenerate modes, such as two Dirac cones for $n=3$. The band\nstructure exhibits an $n$-fold rotational symmetry, including an $n$-fold\nwarped light cone, in contrast to the single-band, parabolic approximation\noften assumed for interacting polaritons. For three photons, the dispersion\nbreaks the symmetry between a photon pair propagating ahead versus behind a\nsingle photon. We confirm these findings experimentally by measuring the\nthree-photon phase and intensity correlation functions, revealing trigonal\nwarping of the quantum vortex-ring generated by the three-photon interactions.\nOur analytical results are supported by rigorous numerical modeling that fully\naccounts for the photon propagation before, inside, and after the finite atomic\nmedium. These findings advance the understanding of multi-photon interactions\nand the development of future multi-photon control tools.",

The deviations from aligned magnetic\nfields are most prominent at positive Galactic longitudes, where the CMZ clouds\nare more massive, denser, and more actively forming stars. Our observed\nstrongly preferentially parallel magnetic field morphology leads us to\nhypothesize that in the absence of star formation, the magnetic field in the\nCMZ is entrained in the orbital gas flows around Sgr A$^{*}$, while\ngravitational collapse and feedback in star-forming regions can locally reorder\nthe field. This magnetic field behavior is similar to that observed in the CMZ\nof the nuclear starburst galaxy NGC 253.

    "abstract": "This study bridges the knowledge gap on how personal factors affect building\noccupants' responses in active shooter situations by applying interpretable\nmachine learning methods to data from 107 participants. The personal factors\nstudied are training methods, prior training experience, sense of direction,\nand gender. The response performance measurements consist of decisions (run,\nhide, multiple), vulnerability (corresponding to the time a participant is\nvisible to a shooter), and pre-evacuation time. The results indicate that the\npropensity to run significantly determines overall response strategies,\novershadowing vulnerability, and pre-evacuation time. The training method is a\ncritical factor where VR-based training leads to better responses than\nvideo-based training. A better sense of direction and previous training\nexperience are correlated with a greater propensity to run and less\nvulnerability. Gender slightly influences decisions and vulnerability but\nsignificantly impacts pre-evacuation time, with females evacuating slower,\npotentially due to higher risk perception. This study underscores the\nimportance of personal factors in shaping responses to active shooter\nincidents.",

Such behavior has been linked to pressure and/or flux\nfluctuations under stationary flow conditions that occur over a broad range of\nresonance frequencies and associated relaxation times. However, there currently\nexists no theoretical development to deal with such phenomena. The aim of this\npaper is to develop a fundamental theory that can describe such behavior.\nFluctuation-dissipation theorems for the case with memory are formulated,\nproviding a new route to obtain frequency-dependent porous media permeability.\n  We propose that multiphase flow systems can be explained by a multipeak\nLorentzian memory function and provide supporting experimental data from the\nflow of decane and water in a porous medium made of glass beads. Our\nfluctuation dissipation theorems provide information on different types of\nrelaxation phenomena and resonance frequencies that occur during fractional\nflow. We show, using experimental data, that Green-Kubo-like expressions can be\nformulated for two-phase fluid flow driven by a constant pressure drop. The\nresulting autocorrelation functions, or rather their Fourier transforms,\nexhibit multiple Lorentzian peak shapes. Resonances are similar to those of\nelectric conductance. The analysis offers a new route to steady-state relative\npermeability measurements, including information on the relaxation times and\nresonance regimes that exist during fractional flow. Overall, the theory\npresented and supported by fractional flow experiments provides a rich set of\npossible directions for future developments that could fundamentally change the\nway multiphase flow systems are understood and studied.",

The outcomes\ndemonstrate a remarkable redshift completeness exceeding 95 per cent for\nemission line galaxies (ELGs), alongside a purity surpassing 85 per cent. The\nredshift uncertainty remains impressively below than $\\sim 0.001$. Notably,\nwhen concentrating on galaxies with more than three matched emission lines, the\ncompleteness of ELGs and the purity of measurable galaxies can reach 98 per\ncent and 97 per cent, respectively. Furthermore, we explore the influence of\nparameters like magnitude, spectral signal-to-noise ratio, and redshift on\nredshift completeness and purity.

The relatively large absolute error of the da Vinci end\neffector kinematics and arduous calibration procedure make calibrated\nkinematics data collection expensive. Driven by this limitation, we collected a\ndataset, dubbed SurgPose, providing instance-aware semantic keypoints and\nskeletons for visual surgical tool pose estimation and tracking.

Axial\ncompression tests were conducted on ten short column specimens to evaluate the\neffects of corrugated steel thickness (1.6, 2.0, and 2.7 mm), preloading level\nbefore jacketing (40%, 60%, and 100% of the original capacity), and connection\ntype (welding vs. bolting). A computational model was developed to predict the\nultimate bearing capacity of the strengthened sections. The main findings are\nas follows: (1) The corrugated steel jackets increased the ultimate bearing\ncapacity of the existing RC columns by 34.6% to 67.3%. (2) Given the relatively\nlow confinement efficiency in square sections, thinner corrugated steel plates\ncan be used in a material-efficient manner to achieve comparable strengthening\neffects. (3) Fully welded connections between corrugated plates induce less\nstress concentration and provide better transverse confinement effectiveness\ncompared to bolted connections. (4) In a pre-unloaded column, greater existed\ndamage causes concrete softening and increased lateral expansion under\nre-compression. This dilation promotes a tighter interaction between the core\nconcrete and the outer jacket, activating stronger passive confinement after\nbeing jacketed. (5) The low longitudinal stresses in the jacket indicate that\nits primary role is to provide lateral confinement rather than to resist axial\nloads directly. (6) It is recommended to employ a calculation method that\naccounts for both pre-damage and confinement effects to ensure a conservative\nand reliable design of corrugated steel-jacketed RC columns with pre-damage.",

    "abstract": "Length generalization, the ability to solve problems longer than those seen\nduring training, remains a critical challenge for large language models (LLMs).\nPrevious work modifies positional encodings (PEs) and data formats to improve\nlength generalization on specific symbolic tasks such as addition and sorting.\nHowever, these approaches are fundamentally limited to special tasks, often\ndegrading general language performance. Furthermore, they are typically\nevaluated on small transformers trained from scratch on single tasks and can\ncause performance drop when applied during post-training stage of practical\nLLMs with general capabilities. Hu et al., (2024) proposed Rule-Following\nFine-Tuning (RFFT) to improve length generalization in the post-training stage\nof LLMs. Despite its compatibility with practical models and strong\nperformance, RFFT is proposed for single tasks too, requiring re-training for\neach individual task with extensive examples. In this paper, we study length\ngeneralization in multi-task settings and propose Meta Rule-Following\nFine-Tuning (Meta-RFFT), the first framework enabling robust cross-task length\ngeneralization. As our first contribution, we construct a large length\ngeneralization dataset containing 86 tasks spanning code execution, number\nprocessing, symbolic and logical reasoning tasks, beyond the common addition or\nmultiplication tasks. Secondly, we show that cross-task length generalization\nis possible with Meta-RFFT. After training on a large number of tasks and\ninstances, the models achieve remarkable length generalization ability on\nunseen tasks with minimal fine-tuning or one-shot prompting. For example, after\nfine-tuning on 1 to 5 digit addition, our 32B model achieves 95% accuracy on 30\ndigit addition, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art reasoning\nmodels (DeepSeek-R1-671B: 72%), despite never seeing this task during\nRF-pretraining.",

However, thin-section analysis is\nlimited by its 2D nature and subjective interpretation, while MICP provides 3D\npore-throat distributions, it lacks direct visualization of pore morphology.\nThis study evaluates AI-assisted thin-section image analysis for pore-throat\ncharacterization by comparing its results to MICP-derived measurements. A\nmachine learning-based workflow was developed using color thresholding, K-Means\nclustering, and medial axis transformation to segment pore structures in\nthin-section images. Throat width, porosity, and permeability were\nquantitatively assessed against MICP to determine the accuracy and reliability\nof the technique. The analysis of 26 sandstone samples outlined differences\nbetween the two methods. Thin-section analysis showed porosity values from\n1.37% to 53.37%, with average pore-throat sizes between 5.63 micron and 30.09\nmicron, while permeability estimates ranged from 0.01 mD to 344.35 mD.\nCorrelation analysis showed moderate agreement for throat size (r=0.62) and\npermeability (r=0.61), but weaker for porosity (r=0.32), highlighting the\ndifferences in how each method captures pore connectivity. Results demonstrate\nthat the AI-assisted segmentation provides a scalable and reproducible approach\nbut is constrained by thin-section imaging resolution. While MICP remains\nreliable for permeability evaluation, its comparison with AI-driven image\nanalysis helps assess the reliability of the method.

    "abstract": "Large language models have demonstrated exceptional capabilities across\ndiverse tasks, but their fine-tuning demands significant memory, posing\nchallenges for resource-constrained environments. Zeroth-order (ZO)\noptimization provides a memory-efficient alternative by eliminating the need\nfor backpropagation. However, ZO optimization suffers from high gradient\nvariance, and prior research has largely focused on single-task learning,\nleaving its application to multi-task learning unexplored. Multi-task learning\nis crucial for leveraging shared knowledge across tasks to improve\ngeneralization, yet it introduces unique challenges under ZO settings, such as\namplified gradient variance and collinearity. In this paper, we present MaZO,\nthe first framework specifically designed for multi-task LLM fine-tuning under\nZO optimization. MaZO tackles these challenges at the parameter level through\ntwo key innovations: a weight importance metric to identify critical parameters\nand a multi-task weight update mask to selectively update these parameters,\nreducing the dimensionality of the parameter space and mitigating task\nconflicts. Experiments demonstrate that MaZO achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance, surpassing even multi-task learning methods designed for\nfirst-order optimization.",

In particular, we show that statistics of this entropy\nresults in two findings that improve our understanding of stationary and\nnonstationary systems: (i) variations of the Boltzmann-Gibbs (BG) entropy do\nnot exceed twice the value of the thermodynamic kappa, the parameter that\nprovides a measure of the entropy defect in both stationary and nonstationary\nstates, while becomes the shape parameter that labels the kappa distributions\nin stationary states; and (ii) the ratio of the deviation of the BG entropy\nwith kappa scales with the kappa deviation via a power-law, while the\nrespective exponent provides a stationarity deviation index (SDI), which\nmeasures the natural tendency of the system to depart from stationarity. We\nconfirm the validity of these findings in three different heliospheric plasma\ndatasets observed from three missions: (1) A solar energetic particle event,\nrecorded by the Integrated Science Investigation of the Sun instrument onboard\nParker Solar Probe; (2) Near Earth solar wind protons recorded by the Solar\nWind Experiment instrument onboard WIND; and (3) Plasma protons in the\nheliosheath, source of energetic neutral atoms recorded by IBEX.

More interestingly, its X-ray\nlight curve of afterglow exhibits two-plateau emissions, namely, an internal\nplateau emission that is smoothly connected with a $\\sim t^{-0.1}$ segment and\nfollowed by a $\\sim t^{-2}$ power-law decay. The three episodes in the prompt\nemission, together with two plateau emissions in X-ray, are unique in the Swift\nera. They are very difficult to explain with the standard internal/external\nshock model by invoking a black hole central engine. However, it could be\nconsistent with the prediction of a supramassive magnetar as the central\nengine, the physical process of phase transition from magnetar to strange star,\nas well as the cooling and spin-down of the strange star. In this paper, we\npropose that the first- and second-episode emissions in the prompt $\\gamma-$ray\nof GRB 240529A are from the jet emission of a massive star collapsing into a\nsupramassive magnetar and the re-activity of central engine, respectively.\nThen, the third-episode emission of prompt is attributed to the phase\ntransition from a magnetar to a strange star. Finally, the first- and\nsecond-plateau emissions of the X-ray afterglow are powered by the cooling and\nspin-down of the strange star, respectively.

Recent studies have introduced varied bathtub failure rate models for\nreliability modeling of such datasets.

Two CR datasets from electrode voltage endurance life and electrical\nappliance tests, respectively, characterized by BFR and RCFR behaviors, are\nemployed to demonstrate the BFM adequacy.

In this work, we tackle ill-posed inverse problems in\npotential MFGs, aiming to recover the agents' population, momentum, and\nenvironmental setup from limited, noisy measurements and partial observations.\nThese problems are ill-posed because multiple MFG configurations can explain\nthe same data, or different parameters can yield nearly identical observations.\nNonetheless, they remain crucial in practice for real-world scenarios where\ndata are inherently sparse or noisy, or where the MFG structure is not fully\ndetermined. Our focus is on finding surrogate MFGs that accurately reproduce\nthe observed data despite these challenges. We propose two Gaussian process\n(GP)-based frameworks: an inf-sup formulation and a bilevel approach. The\nchoice between them depends on whether the unknown parameters introduce\nconcavity in the objective. In the inf-sup framework, we use the linearity of\nGPs and their parameterization structure to maintain convex-concave properties,\nallowing us to apply standard convex optimization algorithms. In the bilevel\nframework, we employ a gradient-descent-based algorithm and introduce two\nmethods for computing the outer gradient. The first method leverages an\nexisting solver for the inner potential MFG and applies automatic\ndifferentiation, while the second adopts an adjoint-based strategy that\ncomputes the outer gradient independently of the inner solver. Our numerical\nexperiments show that when sufficient prior information is available, the\nunknown parameters can be accurately recovered.

    "abstract": "This work studies interference patterns created by simple lens models (point\nmass, Chang-Refsdal, and binary lens) in the wave optics regime, primarily in\nthe context of lensing of gravitational waves (GWs) in the LIGO band at\nfrequencies around 100 Hz. We study how the interference patterns behave close\nto the caustic curves which mark the high magnification regions in conventional\ngeometric optics. In addition, we also look at the formation of highly\nde-amplified regions in the amplification maps close to caustics and how they\ndiffer under wave and geometric optics. We see that for a source close to\ncaustics, the oscillations in the amplification factor (their amplitude and\nlocation of crests and troughs) can differ significantly in wave optics\ncompared to geometric optics. As we move away from caustics, the wave optics\namplification factor starts to converge towards geometric optics one,\nespecially the frequencies at which crests and through occur in the\namplification factor, although the amplitude of these oscillations can still be\nconsiderably different. For Chang-Refsdal and binary lens with ${\\sim}100\\:{\\rm\nM_\\odot}-200\\:{\\rm M_\\odot}$ can introduce significant de-amplification at\nfrequencies ${\\sim}100$ Hz when the source is close to caustics which may help\nus distinguish such lenses from the point mass lens.",

Secondly, we develop a degeneracy\ndetection model using residual neural networks (ResNet) and transformer which\nis able to identify degeneracy by scrutinizing the distribution of the particle\npopulation. Thirdly, an adaptive anti-degeneracy strategy is designed, which\nfirst performs fusion and perturbation on the resample process to provide rich\nand accurate initial values for the pose optimization, and use a hierarchical\npose optimization combining coarse and fine matching, which is able to\nadaptively adjust the optimization frequency and the sensor trustworthiness\naccording to the degree of degeneracy, in order to enhance the ability of\nsearching the global optimal pose. Finally, we demonstrate the optimality of\nthe model, as well as the improvement of the image matrix method and GPU on the\ncomputation time through ablation experiments, and verify the performance of\nthe anti-degeneracy system in different scenarios through simulation\nexperiments and real experiments.

    "abstract": "Code generation models have shown significant potential for automating\nprogramming tasks. However, the challenge of generating accurate and reliable\ncode persists due to the highly complex and long-reasoning nature of the task.\nEven state-of-the-art models often fail in code generation due to small errors,\nwhich can drastically affect the overall functionality of code. Our study\nidentifies that current models tend to produce errors concentrated at specific\nerror-prone points, which significantly impacts the accuracy of the generated\ncode. To address this issue, we introduce Focused-DPO, a framework that\nenhances code generation by directing preference optimization towards these\ncritical error-prone areas. This approach builds on Direct Preference\nOptimization, emphasizing accuracy in parts prone to errors. Additionally, we\ndevelop a method called Error-Point Identification, which constructs a dataset\nthat targets these problematic points without requiring costly human\nannotations. Our experiments on benchmarks such as HumanEval(+), MBPP(+), and\nLiveCodeBench demonstrate that Focused-DPO significantly improves the precision\nand reliability of code generation, reducing common errors and enhancing\noverall code quality. By focusing on error-prone points, Focused-DPO advances\nthe accuracy and functionality of model-generated code.",

Inspired by previous works, the method explores\nthe underlying characteristics of bi-temporal Remote Sensing images and designs\nthe corresponding networks. Firstly, we assume that bi-temporal Remote Sensing\nimages share the same latent space, for they are always acquired from the same\nland location. So SRUIT makes the generators share their high-level layers, and\nthis constraint will compel two domain mapping to fall into the same latent\nspace. Secondly, considering land covers of bi-temporal images could evolve\ninto each other, SRUIT exploits the cross-cycle-consistent adversarial networks\nto translate from one to the other and recover them. Experimental results show\nthat constraints of sharing weights and cross-cycle consistency enable\ntranslated images with both good perceptual image quality and semantic\npreservation for significant differences.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in\nvarious tasks, yet code generation remains a major challenge. Current\napproaches for obtaining high-quality code data primarily focus on (i)\ncollecting large-scale pre-training data and (ii) synthesizing instruction data\nthrough prompt engineering with powerful models. While pre-training data faces\nquality consistency issues, instruction-based synthesis suffers from limited\ninstruction diversity and inherent biases of LLMs. To address this gap, we\nintroduce UnitCoder, a systematic pipeline leveraging model-generated unit\ntests to both guide and validate the code generation process. Combined with\nlarge-scale package-based retrieval from pre-training corpus, we generate a\ndataset of 500K+ verifiable programs containing diverse API calls. Evaluations\non multiple Python benchmarks (BigCodeBench, HumanEval, MBPP) demonstrate that\nmodels fine-tuned on our synthetic data exhibit consistent performance\nimprovements. Notably, Llama3.1-8B and InternLM2.5-7B improve from 31\\% and\n28\\% to 40\\% and 39\\% success rates on BigCodeBench, respectively.

The question we address here is: how strong\nis the evidence provided by such edits? To evaluate the localization claim, we\nwant to assess the effect of the optimal intervention at a particular location.\nThe key new technical tool is a way of adapting LLM alignment techniques to\nfind such optimal localized edits. With this tool in hand, we give an example\nwhere the edit-based evidence for localization appears strong, but where\nlocalization clearly fails.

    "abstract": "Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) in millimeter wave is a key\nenabler for next-generation networks, which leverages large bandwidth and\nextensive antenna arrays, benefiting both communication and sensing\nfunctionalities. The associated high costs can be mitigated by adopting a\nhybrid beamforming structure. However, the well-studied monostatic ISAC systems\nface challenges related to full-duplex operation. To address this issue, this\npaper focuses on a three-dimensional bistatic configuration that requires only\nhalf-duplex base stations. To intuitively evaluate the error bound of bistatic\nsensing using orthogonal frequency division multiplexing waveforms, we propose\na positioning scheme that combines angle-of-arrival and time-of-arrival\nestimation, deriving the closed-form expression of the position error bound\n(PEB). Using this PEB, we develop two hybrid beamforming algorithms for joint\nwaveform design, aimed at maximizing achievable spectral efficiency (SE) while\nensuring a predefined PEB threshold. The first algorithm leverages a Riemannian\ntrust-region approach, achieving superior performance in terms of global optima\nand convergence speed compared to conventional gradient-based methods, but with\nhigher complexity. In contrast, the second algorithm, which employs orthogonal\nmatching pursuit, offers a more computationally efficient solution, delivering\nreasonable SE while maintaining the PEB constraint. Numerical results are\nprovided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed designs.",

However, existing\nRAG approaches lag behind other long-context processing methods due to inherent\nlimitations on inaccurate retrieval and fragmented contexts.

This approach\nenhances robustness to retrieval inaccuracy, facilitates effective utilization\nof fragmented contexts, and saves the cost from repeated computation.

We introduce EgoSpeak, a novel\nframework for real-time speech initiation prediction in egocentric streaming\nvideo. By modeling the conversation from the speaker's first-person viewpoint,\nEgoSpeak is tailored for human-like interactions in which a conversational\nagent must continuously observe its environment and dynamically decide when to\ntalk. Our approach bridges the gap between simplified experimental setups and\ncomplex natural conversations by integrating four key capabilities: (1)\nfirst-person perspective, (2) RGB processing, (3) online processing, and (4)\nuntrimmed video processing. We also present YT-Conversation, a diverse\ncollection of in-the-wild conversational videos from YouTube, as a resource for\nlarge-scale pretraining. Experiments on EasyCom and Ego4D demonstrate that\nEgoSpeak outperforms random and silence-based baselines in real time. Our\nresults also highlight the importance of multimodal input and context length in\neffectively deciding when to speak.",

Under the goal of equal opportunity, attention allocated to an\nindividual on a ranking interface should be proportional to their relevance\nacross search queries. In this work, we examine amortized fair ranking -- where\nrelevance and attention are cumulated over a sequence of user queries to make\nfair ranking more feasible in practice. Unlike prior methods that operate on\nexpected amortized attention for each individual, we define new\ndivergence-based measures for attention distribution-based fairness in ranking\n(DistFaiR), characterizing unfairness as the divergence between the\ndistribution of attention and relevance corresponding to an individual over\ntime. This allows us to propose new definitions of unfairness, which are more\nreliable at test time. Second, we prove that group fairness is upper-bounded by\nindividual fairness under this definition for a useful class of divergence\nmeasures, and experimentally show that maximizing individual fairness through\nan integer linear programming-based optimization is often beneficial to group\nfairness. Lastly, we find that prior research in amortized fair ranking ignores\ncritical information about queries, potentially leading to a fairwashing risk\nin practice by making rankings appear more fair than they actually are.",

While existing methods employ\nparameter sharing to reuse the same parameter set under fixed budgets, such\napproaches typically force each layer to assume multiple roles with a\npredetermined number of iterations, restricting efficiency and adaptability. In\nthis work, we propose the Zero Token Transformer (ZTT), which features a\nhead-tail decoupled parameter cycling method. We disentangle the first (head)\nand last (tail) layers from parameter cycling and iteratively refine only the\nintermediate layers.

At each cycle, the model retrieves a zero token\n(with trainable key values) from a Zero-Token Pool, integrating it alongside\nregular tokens in the attention mechanism. The corresponding attention scores\nnot only reflect each layer's computational importance but also enable dynamic\nearly exits without sacrificing overall model accuracy.

Detecting and\nfiltering such unsafe training data is essential for trustworthy model\ndevelopment. Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches typically rely on\ntraining moderation classifiers which requires significant computational\noverhead and are limited to predefined taxonomies, making them less adaptable\nto evolving safety concerns. Moreover, these classifiers lack insight into the\ntraining process, limiting their effectiveness in filtering unsafe data.

DABUF enables flexible identification of\nvarious unsafe data types without predefined taxonomies.

In such cases, DABUF will\nintegrate moderation classifiers to identify a minimal subset of unsafe\ntraining data for targeted attribution (such as jailbreak). When model outputs\nare relatively straightforward, DABUF uses model outputs directly as the\nattribution targets. We evaluate the performance on two different tasks: in\nfiltering jailbreaking training data and in identifying and mitigating gender\nbias.

    "abstract": "Energy-energy correlators (EECs) within high energy jets serve as a key\nexperimentally accessible quantity to probe the scale and structure of the\nquark-gluon plasma (QGP) in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. The CMS\nCollaboration's first measurement of the modification to the EEC within single\ninclusive jets in Pb+Pb collisions relative to p+p collisions reveals a\nsignificant enhancement at small angles, which may arise from jet transverse\nmomentum $p_T$ selection biases due to jet energy loss. We investigate the\ndependence of jet EECs on the flavor of the initiating parton. The EEC\ndistribution of a gluon jet is broader and the peak of transition from\nperturbative to non-perturbative regime occurs at a larger angle than a quark\njet. Such flavor dependence leads to the different EECs for $\\gamma$-jets and\nsingle inclusive jets due to their different flavor composition. It is also\nresponsible for a colliding energy dependence of EECs of single inclusive jets\nat fixed jet energy. We also investigate the impact of flavor composition\nvariation on the $p_T$ dependence of the jet EEC. We further propose that a\nchange in the gluon jet fraction in A+A collisions compared to p+p can also\ncontribute to a non-negligible enhancement of the medium modified EEC at small\nangles. Using the \\textsc{Jewel} model, we predict the reduction of the gluon\njet fraction in A+A collisions and estimate its impact on the EEC.",

    "abstract": "Collaborative 3D object detection holds significant importance in the field\nof autonomous driving, as it greatly enhances the perception capabilities of\neach individual agent by facilitating information exchange among multiple\nagents. However, in practice, due to pose estimation errors and time delays,\nthe fusion of information across agents often results in feature\nrepresentations with spatial and temporal noise, leading to detection errors.\nDiffusion models naturally have the ability to denoise noisy samples to the\nideal data, which motivates us to explore the use of diffusion models to\naddress the noise problem between multi-agent systems. In this work, we propose\nCoDiff, a novel robust collaborative perception framework that leverages the\npotential of diffusion models to generate more comprehensive and clearer\nfeature representations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work\nto apply diffusion models to multi-agent collaborative perception.\nSpecifically, we project high-dimensional feature map into the latent space of\na powerful pre-trained autoencoder. Within this space, individual agent\ninformation serves as a condition to guide the diffusion model's sampling. This\nprocess denoises coarse feature maps and progressively refines the fused\nfeatures. Experimental study on both simulated and real-world datasets\ndemonstrates that the proposed framework CoDiff consistently outperforms\nexisting relevant methods in terms of the collaborative object detection\nperformance, and exhibits highly desired robustness when the pose and delay\ninformation of agents is with high-level noise.

While such networks are traditionally constructed using\nembeddings from encoder-based models or static vectors, embeddings from\ndecoder-only large language models (LLMs) remain underexplored.

In this paper, we construct\nlexico-semantic networks from the input embeddings of LLMs with varying\nparameter scales and conduct a comparative analysis of their global and local\nstructures. Our results show that these networks exhibit small-world\nproperties, characterized by high clustering and short path lengths. Moreover,\nlarger LLMs yield more intricate networks with less small-world effects and\nlonger paths, reflecting richer semantic structures and relations.

However, matrices in emerging workloads are\nnot always dense, and sparse matrices where the vast majority of values are\nzeros are becoming more common. Existing matrix extensions and\nmicro-architectures cannot efficiently process highly sparse matrices due to\ntwo reasons: (1) wasted work when one or both input values are zero; and (2)\nincompatibility with sparse matrix formats. This work proposes SparseZipper\nthat minimally modifies existing matrix extensions and systolic-array-based\nmicro-architectures specialized for dense-dense GEMM to accelerate\nsparse-sparse GEMM operating on highly sparse matrices with unstructured\nsparsity structures. Our performance evaluation shows SparseZipper achieves\n5.98x and 2.61x speedup over a scalar hash-based implementation of SpGEMM and a\nstate-of-the-art vectorized SpGEMM version, respectively.

    "abstract": "In autonomous driving systems, motion planning is commonly implemented as a\ntwo-stage process: first, a trajectory proposer generates multiple candidate\ntrajectories, then a scoring mechanism selects the most suitable trajectory for\nexecution. For this critical selection stage, rule-based scoring mechanisms are\nparticularly appealing as they can explicitly encode driving preferences,\nsafety constraints, and traffic regulations in a formalized,\nhuman-understandable format. However, manually crafting these scoring rules\npresents significant challenges: the rules often contain complex\ninterdependencies, require careful parameter tuning, and may not fully capture\nthe nuances present in real-world driving data. This work introduces FLoRA, a\nnovel framework that bridges this gap by learning interpretable scoring rules\nrepresented in temporal logic. Our method features a learnable logic structure\nthat captures nuanced relationships across diverse driving scenarios,\noptimizing both rules and parameters directly from real-world driving\ndemonstrations collected in NuPlan. Our approach effectively learns to evaluate\ndriving behavior even though the training data only contains positive examples\n(successful driving demonstrations). Evaluations in closed-loop planning\nsimulations demonstrate that our learned scoring rules outperform existing\ntechniques, including expert-designed rules and neural network scoring models,\nwhile maintaining interpretability. This work introduces a data-driven approach\nto enhance the scoring mechanism in autonomous driving systems, designed as a\nplug-in module to seamlessly integrate with various trajectory proposers.

To tackle the above\nchallenge, we propose a novel neural network (NN)-empowered IRS channel\nestimation and passive reflection design framework for the wideband orthogonal\nfrequency division multiplexing (OFDM) communication system based only on the\nuser's reference signal received power (RSRP) measurements with time-varying\nrandom IRS training reflections.

To exploit the potential sparsity of the channel autocorrelation\nmatrix, a progressive training method is proposed by gradually increasing the\nnumber of subnetworks until a desired accuracy is achieved, thus reducing the\ntraining complexity. Based on the estimates of IRS channel autocorrelation\nmatrix, the IRS passive reflection is then optimized to maximize the average\nchannel power gain over all subcarriers.

Over the past decade, deep\nlearning techniques have significantly advanced weld defect identification in\nradiographic images. However, conventional approaches, which rely on training\nsmall-scale, task-specific models on single-scenario datasets, exhibit poor\ncross-scenario generalization. Recently, the Segment Anything Model (SAM), a\npre-trained visual foundation model trained on large-scale datasets, has\ndemonstrated exceptional zero-shot generalization capabilities. Fine-tuning SAM\nwith limited domain-specific data has yielded promising results in fields such\nas medical image segmentation and anomaly detection.

    "abstract": "A mathematical model for crack-tip fields is proposed in this paper for the\nresponse of a three-dimensional (3-D) porous elastic solid whose material\nmoduli are dependent on the density. Such a description wherein the generalized\nLam\\`e coefficients are nonlinear functions of material stiffness is more\nrealistic because most engineering materials are porous, and their material\nproperties depend on porosity and density. The governing boundary value problem\nfor the static equilibrium state in a 3-D, homogeneous, isotropic material is\nobtained as a second-order, quasilinear partial-differential-equation system\nwith a classical traction-free crack-surface boundary condition. The numerical\nsolution is obtained from a continuous trilinear Galerkin-type finite element\ndiscretization. A Picard-type linearization is utilized to handle the\nnonlinearities in the discrete problem. The proposed model can describe the\nstate of stress and strain in various materials, including recovering the\nclassical singularities in the linearized model. The role of \\textit{tensile\nstress}, \\textit{stress intensity factor} (SIF), and \\textit{strain energy\ndensity} are examined. The results indicate that the maximum values of all\nthese quantities occur directly before the crack-tip, consistent with the\nobservation made in the canonical problem for the linearized elastic fracture\nmechanics. One can use the same classical local fracture criterion, like the\nmaximum of SIF, to study crack tips' quasi-static and dynamic evolution within\nthe framework described in this article.",

To bridge this gap, we introduce ExaGPT, an interpretable detection\napproach grounded in the human decision-making process for verifying the origin\nof a text. ExaGPT identifies a text by checking whether it shares more similar\nspans with human-written vs. with LLM-generated texts from a datastore.

Our human evaluation demonstrates that\nproviding similar span examples contributes more effectively to judging the\ncorrectness of the decision than existing interpretable methods.

    "abstract": "Multi-behavior recommendation predicts items a user may purchase by analyzing\ndiverse behaviors like viewing, adding to a cart, and purchasing. Existing\nmethods fall into two categories: representation learning and graph ranking.\nRepresentation learning generates user and item embeddings to capture latent\ninteraction patterns, leveraging multi-behavior properties for better\ngeneralization. However, these methods often suffer from over-smoothing and\nbias toward frequent interactions, limiting their expressiveness. Graph ranking\nmethods, on the other hand, directly compute personalized ranking scores,\ncapturing user preferences more effectively.

An\niterative algorithm computes ranking scores, ensuring smoothness, query\nfitting, and cascading alignment. Experiments on three real-world datasets\ndemonstrate that CascadingRank outperforms state-of-the-art methods, with up to\n9.56% and 7.16% improvements in HR@10 and NDCG@10, respectively.

IDPForge does\nnot require sequence-specific training, back transformations from\ncoarse-grained representations, nor ensemble reweighting, as in general the\ncreated IDP/IDR conformational ensembles show good agreement with solution\nexperimental data, and options for biasing with experimental restraints are\nprovided if desired.

    "abstract": "We investigate the impact of geometric corrections to the\nBondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton (BHL) accretion scheme applied to evolving symbiotic\nsystems. We model systems where 0.7 and 1 M$_\\odot$ white dwarfs accrete\nmaterial from Solar-like stars with initial masses of 1, 2, and 3 M$_\\odot$.\nThe primary star is evolved using the MESA stellar evolution code, while the\norbital dynamics of the system are calculated using REBOUND. The analysis\nfocuses on systems evolving through the red giant branch and the\nthermally-pulsating asymptotic giant branch phases that do not experience a\nWind Roche Lobe Overflow phase. We compare three scenarios: no accretion,\nstandard BHL accretion, and the improved wind accretion. The choice of\naccretion prescription critically influences the evolution of symbiotic\nsystems. Simulations using the modified model did not reach the Chandrasekhar\nlimit, suggesting that type Ia supernova progenitors require accretors\noriginating from ultra-massive WDs. In contrast, the standard BHL model\npredicts WD growth to this limit in compact systems. This discrepancy suggests\nthat population synthesis studies adopting the traditional BHL approach may\nyield inaccurate results. The revised model successfully reproduces the\naccretion properties of observed symbiotic systems and predicts transitions\nbetween different accretion regimes driven by donor mass-loss variability.\nThese results emphasize the need for updated wind accretion models to\naccurately describe the evolution of symbiotic binaries.",

    "abstract": "Classification with imbalanced data is a common challenge in data analysis,\nwhere certain classes (minority classes) account for a small fraction of the\ntraining data compared with other classes (majority classes). Classical\nstatistical theory based on large-sample asymptotics and finite-sample\ncorrections is often ineffective for high-dimensional data, leaving many\noverfitting phenomena in empirical machine learning unexplained.\n  In this paper, we develop a statistical theory for high-dimensional\nimbalanced classification by investigating support vector machines and logistic\nregression. We find that dimensionality induces truncation or skewing effects\non the logit distribution, which we characterize via a variational problem\nunder high-dimensional asymptotics. In particular, for linearly separable data\ngenerated from a two-component Gaussian mixture model, the logits from each\nclass follow a normal distribution $\\mathsf{N}(0,1)$ on the testing set, but\nasymptotically follow a rectified normal distribution $\\max\\{\\kappa,\n\\mathsf{N}(0,1)\\}$ on the training set -- which is a pervasive phenomenon we\nverified on tabular data, image data, and text data. This phenomenon explains\nwhy the minority class is more severely affected by overfitting. Further, we\nshow that margin rebalancing, which incorporates class sizes into the loss\nfunction, is crucial for mitigating the accuracy drop for the minority class.\nOur theory also provides insights into the effects of overfitting on\ncalibration and other uncertain quantification measures.",
