The theory makes no\nassumptions further than applying the two-phase incompressible Navier-Stokes\nequations, showing that neither the classical approach using potential theory\nnor other simplifying assumptions are needed. The result for the initial bubble\nacceleration as a function of the gas and liquid densities, classically built\non potential theory, is retained. The result is reproduced by detailed\nnumerical simulations. The accelerated, although stagnant state of the bubble\ninduces a pressure distribution on the bubble surface which is different from\nthe result related to the Archimedean principle, emphasizing the importance of\nthe non-equilibrium state for the force acting on the bubble.",

In this work, we first\nintroduce the concepts of knowledge breadth and knowledge depth, which measure\nthe comprehensiveness and depth of an LLM or knowledge source respectively. We\nreveal that the imbalance in the number of prompts and responses can lead to a\npotential disparity in breadth and depth learning within alignment tuning\ndatasets by showing that even a simple uniform method for balancing the number\nof instructions and responses can lead to significant improvements. Building on\nthis, we further propose Balanced Preference Optimization (BPO), designed to\ndynamically augment the knowledge depth of each sample. BPO is motivated by the\nobservation that the usefulness of knowledge varies across samples,\nnecessitating tailored learning of knowledge depth. To achieve this, we\nintroduce gradient-based clustering, estimating the knowledge informativeness\nand usefulness of each augmented sample based on the model's optimization\ndirection. Our experimental results across various benchmarks demonstrate that\nBPO outperforms other baseline methods in alignment tuning while maintaining\ntraining efficiency. Furthermore, we conduct a detailed analysis of each\ncomponent of BPO, providing guidelines for future research in preference data\noptimization.",

A central\naspect of our approach is the notion of a conflict graph, which captures the\nfundamental unobservability associated with the causal effect and the\nunderlying network. In order to estimate effects, we propose a modified\nHorvitz--Thompson estimator. We show that its variance under the Conflict Graph\nDesign is bounded as $O(\\lambda(H) / n )$, where $\\lambda(H)$ is the largest\neigenvalue of the adjacency matrix of the conflict graph. These rates depend on\nboth the underlying network and the particular causal effect under\ninvestigation. Not only does this yield the best known rates of estimation for\nseveral well-studied causal effects (e.g. the global and direct effects) but it\nalso provides new methods for effects which have received less attention from\nthe perspective of experiment design (e.g. spill-over effects).

Notably, the system undergoes a transition from a\nvalley Hall insulator to a quantum spin Hall insulator as the twisting angle\nincreases. This transition arises from a competition between the\ntwisting-driven effective spin-orbit coupling and sublattice onsite energies\npresented in type-II Rashba moir\\'e structures. The high tunability of Rashba\nmaterials in terms of the spin-orbit coupling strength, interlayer interaction,\nand twisting angle expands the range of materials suitable for realizing and\nmanipulating correlated topological properties.",

    "abstract": "The performance of active learning algorithms can be improved in two ways.\nThe often used and intuitive way is by reducing the overall error rate within\nthe test set. The second way is to ensure that correct predictions are not\nforgotten when the training set is increased in between rounds. The former is\nmeasured by the accuracy of the model and the latter is captured in negative\nflips between rounds. Negative flips are samples that are correctly predicted\nwhen trained with the previous/smaller dataset and incorrectly predicted after\nadditional samples are labeled. In this paper, we discuss improving the\nperformance of active learning algorithms both in terms of prediction accuracy\nand negative flips. The first observation we make in this paper is that\nnegative flips and overall error rates are decoupled and reducing one does not\nnecessarily imply that the other is reduced. Our observation is important as\ncurrent active learning algorithms do not consider negative flips directly and\nimplicitly assume the opposite. The second observation is that performing\ntargeted active learning on subsets of the unlabeled pool has a significant\nimpact on the behavior of the active learning algorithm and influences both\nnegative flips and prediction accuracy. We then develop ROSE - a plug-in\nalgorithm that utilizes a small labeled validation set to restrict arbitrary\nactive learning acquisition functions to negative flips within the unlabeled\npool.

Our experiments demonstrate robust generalization across diverse\ndatasets, producing sharper and higher quality metric depth estimates compared\nto existing approaches.",

In this paper, we show new types of side channels\nthrough the file system that break this logical isolation. The file system\nplays a critical role in the operating system, managing all I/O activities\nbetween the application layer and the physical storage device. We observe that\nthe file system implementation is shared, leading to timing leakage when using\ncommon I/O system calls. Specifically, we found that modern operating systems\ntake advantage of any flush operation (which saves cached blocks in memory to\nthe SSD or disk) to flush all of the I/O buffers, even those used by other\nisolation domains. Thus, by measuring the delay of syncfs, the attacker can\ninfer the I/O behavior of victim programs. We then demonstrate a syncfs covert\nchannel attack on multiple file systems, including both Linux native file\nsystems and the Windows file system, achieving a maximum bandwidth of 5 Kbps\nwith an error rate of 0.15% on Linux and 7.6 Kbps with an error rate of 1.9% on\nWindows. In addition, we construct three side-channel attacks targeting both\nLinux and Android devices.

On Android devices, we design an\napplication fingerprinting attack that leaks application write patterns during\nboot-up. The attacks achieve over 90% F1 score, precision, and recall. Finally,\nwe demonstrate that these attacks can be exploited across containers\nimplementing a container detection technique and a cross-container covert\nchannel attack.",

Dialects, often\nreferred to as regional languages, are distinctive variations of a language\nspoken in a particular location and are identified by their phonetics,\npronunciations, and lexicon. Subtle changes in pronunciation and intonation are\nalso influenced by geographic location, educational attainment, and\nsocioeconomic status. Dialect standardization is needed to ensure effective\ncommunication, educational consistency, access to technology, economic\nopportunities, and the preservation of linguistic resources while respecting\ncultural diversity. Being the fifth most spoken language with around 55\ndistinct dialects spoken by 160 million people, addressing Bangla dialects is\ncrucial for developing inclusive communication tools. However, limited research\nexists due to a lack of comprehensive datasets and the challenges of handling\ndiverse dialects. With the advancement in multilingual Large Language Models\n(mLLMs), emerging possibilities have been created to address the challenges of\ndialectal Automated Speech Recognition (ASR) and Machine Translation (MT). This\nstudy presents an end-to-end pipeline for converting dialectal Noakhali speech\nto standard Bangla speech. This investigation includes constructing a\nlarge-scale diverse dataset with dialectal speech signals that tailored the\nfine-tuning process in ASR and LLM for transcribing the dialect speech to\ndialect text and translating the dialect text to standard Bangla text. Our\nexperiments demonstrated that fine-tuning the Whisper ASR model achieved a CER\nof 0.8% and WER of 1.5%, while the BanglaT5 model attained a BLEU score of\n41.6% for dialect-to-standard text translation.",

One significant challenge lies in accurately modelling the\ninteraction of gas particles with the surfaces of these objects, as errors in\naerodynamic coefficient modelling directly impact orbit prediction accuracy.\nCurrent approaches rely on empirical models, such as those by Sentman and\nCercignani-Lampis-Lord, incorporating one or two adjustable parameters\ntypically calibrated with orbital acceleration data. However, these models fall\nshort in capturing essential gas-solid interaction processes, including\nmultiple reflections, shadowing, and backscattering caused by surface\nroughness. We present a novel, physics-based gas-surface interaction model that\nutilises electromagnetic wave theory to account for macroscopic effects of\nsurface roughness on gas particle scattering distributions. This approach not\nonly offers a more accurate representation of gas-surface interactions but also\nallows parameter determination through a combination of ground-based surface\nroughness measurements and molecular dynamics simulations at the atomic scale.\nThe model validity is tested across the entire parameter space using a\ntest-particle Monte Carlo method on a simulated rough surface. Furthermore, it\nsuccessfully reproduces experimental results from the literature on the\nscattering of Argon and Helium from smooth and rough Kapton and Aluminium\nsurfaces. Finally, we demonstrate the model's impact on aerodynamic\ncoefficients for simple geometric shapes, comparing the results with those from\nthe Sentman and Cercignani-Lampis-Lord models.

Through RNC we\ngenerated and explored in silico fMRI responses for large amounts of images,\ndiscovering controlling images that align or disentangle responses across\nareas, thus indicating their shared or unique representational content. This\nrevealed a typical network-level configuration of representational\nrelationships in which shared or unique representational content varied based\non cortical distance, categorical selectivity, and position within the visual\nhierarchy. Closing the empirical cycle, we validated the in silico discoveries\non in vivo fMRI responses from independent subjects. Together, this reveals how\nvisual areas jointly represent the world as an interconnected network.",

We simulated multi-lane four-leg intersection scenarios and\ngenerates detailed datasets to enable conflict detection using LLMs and Python\nsimulation as a ground truth. We used chain-of-thought prompts to lead LLMs in\nunderstanding the context, detecting conflicts, resolving them using traffic\nrules, and delivering context-sensitive traffic management solutions.

We observed a potential phase transition in giant radio\ngalaxies, marked by differences in lobe expansion speed and pressure variations\ncompared to their smaller evolutionary phases. This suggests the need for\nfurther investigation across a broader parameter space to determine if GRGs\nfundamentally differ from smaller RGs. Axial ratio analysis reveals\nself-similar expansion in rapidly propagating jets, with notable deviations\nwhen the jet forms wider lobes. Overall, this study emphasizes that multiple\ngrowth factors at work can better elucidate the current-day population of GRGs,\nincluding scenarios e.g., growth of GRGs in dense environments, GRGs of several\nmegaparsecs, GRG development in low-powered jets, and the formation of X-shaped\nGRGs.",

Research on environmental mixtures provides insights into\nrealistic exposure scenarios, informing regulatory policies that better protect\npublic health.

A popular Bayesian semi-parametric Gaussian process\nregression framework (Coull et al., 2015) addresses these challenges by\nmodeling exposure-response functions with Gaussian processes and performing\nfeature selection to manage high-dimensional exposures while accounting for\nconfounders. Originally designed for small to moderate-sized cohort studies,\nthis framework does not scale well to massive datasets. To address this, we\npropose a divide-and-conquer strategy, partitioning data, computing posterior\ndistributions in parallel, and combining results using the generalized median.\nWhile we focus on Gaussian process models for environmental mixtures, the\nproposed distributed computing strategy is broadly applicable to other Bayesian\nmodels with computationally prohibitive full-sample Markov Chain Monte Carlo\nfitting. We provide theoretical guarantees for the convergence of the proposed\nposterior distributions to those derived from the full sample.

Recent advances in run-time attestation\narchitectures are also able to guarantee that a remote Verifier (Vrf) reliably\nreceives this evidence from Prv, even when Prv's software state is fully\ncompromised. This, in theory, enables secure \"run-time auditing\" in addition to\nbest-effort attestation, i.e., it guarantees that Vrf can examine execution\nevidence to identify previously unknown compromises as soon as they are\nexploited, pinpoint their root cause(s), and remediate them. However, prior\nwork has for the most part focused on securely implementing Prv's root of trust\n(responsible for generating authentic run-time evidence), leaving Vrf 's\nperspective in this security service unexplored. In this work, we argue that\nrun-time attestation and auditing are only truly useful if Vrf can effectively\nanalyze received evidence. From this premise, we characterize different types\nof evidence produced by existing run-time attestation/auditing architectures in\nterms of Vrf 's ability to detect and remediate (previously unknown)\nvulnerabilities. As a case study for practical uses of run-time evidence by\nVrf, we propose SABRE: a Security Analysis and Binary Repair Engine.

Our evaluation in solid generation and\nsegmentation tasks indicates that the NeuroNURBS performs comparably and, in\nsome cases, superior to UV-grids, but with a significantly improved efficiency:\nfor training the surface autoencoder, GPU consumption is reduced by 86.7%;\nmemory requirement drops by 79.9% for storing 3D solids. Moreover, adapting\nBrepGen for solid generation with our NeuroNURBS improves the FID from 30.04 to\n27.24, and resolves the undulating issue in generated surfaces.",

    "abstract": "We propose that modifications to the Higgs potential within a narrow\natmospheric layer near the event horizon of an astrophysical black hole could\nsignificantly enhance the rate of sphaleron transitions, as well as transform\nthe Chern-Simons number into a dynamic variable. As a result, sphaleron\ntransitions in this region occur without suppression, in contrast to\nlow-temperature conditions, and each transition may generate a substantially\ngreater baryon number than would be produced by winding around the Higgs\npotential in Minkowski spacetime. This effect amplifies baryon number violation\nnear the black hole horizon, potentially leading to a considerable generation\nof matter. Given the possibility of a departure from equilibrium during the\nabsorption of matter and the formation of relativistic jets in supermassive\nblack holes, we conjecture that this process could contribute to the creation\nof a significant amount of matter around such black holes. This phenomenon may\noffer an alternative explanation for the rapid growth of supermassive black\nholes and their surrounding galaxies in the early Universe, as suggested by\nrecent observations from the JWST. Furthermore, this mechanism may provide\ninsights into the low-mass gap puzzle, addressing the observed scarcity of\nblack holes with masses near the Oppenheimer-Volkoff limit.",

Appropriate\ntheoretical approaches are needed to understand the mechanism behind MNT.\nPurpose: This work aims to produce neutron-rich isotopes in the super-heavy\nregion through the ${}^{238} \\mathrm{U}+{ }^{248} \\mathrm{Cm}$ system. We\nemploy a microscopic approach to elucidate reaction mechanisms, and predict new\nisotope production that expands the known nuclear chart. Methods: The\nstochastic mean-field (SMF) approach, including fluctuations and correlations,\nis used to explain the primary cross-sections in MNT reactions based on the\nquasi-fission and inverse quasi-fission processes, and a statistical\nde-excitation model with GEMINI++ code to calculate the secondary fragment\ncross-sections Results: The calculated cross-sections using SMF and GEMINI++\nexplain available experimental results for the ${}^{238} \\mathrm{U}+{ }^{248}\n\\mathrm{Cm}$ system at $E_\\mathrm{c.m.}=898.7$~MeV energy. This shows the\neffectiveness and applicability of the quantal diffusion approach based on the\nSMF theory in heavy-ion collisions. Conclusions: Production of transuranium\nneutron-rich elements with a proton number up to $Z=$101 are obtained with\nsizable cross-sections. Theoretical results calculated for the Z=102-105\nregion, for which there are no experimental data, show that the cross-section\nvalues would be lower than the microbarn level. SMF theory does not contain any\nadjustable parameters other than the standard parameters of the energy density\nfunctional used in the TDHF theory and is an important approach for the\nmicroscopic understanding of reaction mechanisms.",

This phenomenon occurs when evaluation data\ninadvertently overlaps with the public code repositories used to train CLMs,\nseverely undermining the credibility of performance evaluations. For software\ncompanies considering the integration of CLM-based techniques into their\ndevelopment pipeline, this uncertainty about true performance metrics poses an\nunacceptable business risk. Code refactoring, which comprises code\nrestructuring and variable renaming, has emerged as a promising measure to\nmitigate data contamination. It provides a practical alternative to the\nresource-intensive process of building contamination-free evaluation datasets,\nwhich would require companies to collect, clean, and label code created after\nthe CLMs' training cutoff dates. However, the lack of automated code\nrefactoring tools and scientifically validated refactoring techniques has\nhampered widespread industrial implementation. To bridge the gap, this paper\npresents the first systematic study to examine the efficacy of code refactoring\noperators at multiple scales (method-level, class-level, and cross-class level)\nand in different programming languages. In particular, we develop an\nopen-sourced toolkit, CODECLEANER, which includes 11 operators for Python, with\nnine method-level, one class-level, and one cross-class-level operator. A drop\nof 65% overlap ratio is found when applying all operators in CODECLEANER,\ndemonstrating their effectiveness in addressing data contamination.\nAdditionally, we migrate four operators to Java, showing their generalizability\nto another language. We make CODECLEANER online available to facilitate further\nstudies on mitigating CLM data contamination.",

Specifically, low-fidelity policies and their experience\ndata are dynamically used for efficient targeted learning, guided by their\nalignment with the high-fidelity policy. The effectiveness of ALPHA is\ndemonstrated in analytical test optimization and octocopter design problems,\nutilizing two low-fidelity models alongside a high-fidelity one. The results\nhighlight ALPHA's adaptive capability to dynamically utilize models across time\nand design space, eliminating the need for scheduling models as required in a\nhierarchical framework.

To mitigate these issues, we propose a novel method,\nPruneLoRA which introduces a new MU paradigm, termed prune first, then adapt,\nthen unlearn.

    "abstract": "The stability of inverter-dominated power grids remains an active area of\nresearch. This paper presents novel sufficient conditions for ensuring\nsmall-signal stability in lossless and constant $R/X$ grids with highly\nheterogeneous mixes of grid-forming inverters that implement an adapted $V$-$q$\ndroop control. The proposed conditions can be evaluated in the neighborhood of\neach bus without information on the rest of the grid. Apart from the presence\nof $V$-$q$ droop, no additional assumptions are made regarding the inverter\ncontrol strategies, nor is dynamical homogeneity across the system assumed. The\nanalysis is enabled by recasting the node dynamics in terms of complex\nfrequency and power, resulting in transfer functions that directly capture the\nsmall-signal frequency and amplitude responses to active and reactive power\nimbalances. These transfer functions are directly aligned with typical design\nconsiderations in grid-forming control. Building on an adapted small-phase\ntheorem and viewing the system as a closed feedback loop between nodes and\nlines, the derived stability conditions also yield new insights when applied to\nestablished inverter control designs. We demonstrate in simulations that our\nconditions are not overly conservative and can identify individual inverters\nthat are misconfigured and cause instability.",

    "abstract": "In the last few years, with the rapid development of deep learning\ntechnologies, supervised methods based on convolutional neural networks have\ngreatly enhanced the performance of medical image denoising. However, these\nmethods require large quantities of noisy-clean image pairs for training, which\ngreatly limits their practicality. Although some researchers have attempted to\ntrain denoising networks using only single noisy images, existing\nself-supervised methods, including blind-spot-based and data-splitting-based\nmethods, heavily rely on the assumption that noise is pixel-wise independent.\nHowever, this assumption often does not hold in real-world medical images.\nTherefore, in the field of medical imaging, there remains a lack of simple and\npractical denoising methods that can achieve high-quality denoising performance\nusing only single noisy images. In this paper, we propose a novel\nself-supervised medical image denoising method, Neighboring Slice Noise2Noise\n(NS-N2N). The proposed method utilizes neighboring slices within a single noisy\nimage volume to construct weighted training data, and then trains the denoising\nnetwork using a self-supervised scheme with regional consistency loss and\ninter-slice continuity loss. NS-N2N only requires a single noisy image volume\nobtained from one medical imaging procedure to achieve high-quality denoising\nof the image volume itself. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed\nmethod outperforms state-of-the-art self-supervised denoising methods in both\ndenoising performance and processing efficiency. Furthermore, since NS-N2N\noperates solely in the image domain, it is free from device-specific issues\nsuch as reconstruction geometry, making it easier to apply in various clinical\npractices.",

Our key insight is that complex\nRF-object interactions can be captured through object-centric neural\nrepresentations while preserving the composability of traditional ray tracing.\nUnlike previous approaches that either rely on crude geometric approximations\nor require dense spatial sampling of entire scenes, RFScape learns per-object\nelectromagnetic properties and enables flexible scene composition.

In this paper, we present the first comprehensive\ninvestigation of the group robustness in the early diagnosis of MCI to AD\nconversion using MRI images, focusing on disparities in accuracy between\ngroups, specifically sMCI and pMCI individuals divided by age.

In recent progresses, the \\textit{generative\nreplay} methods have showcased substantial potential by employing generative\nmodels to replay data distribution of past tasks. Compared to storing the data\nfrom past tasks directly, this category of methods circumvents the growing\nstorage overhead and possible data privacy concerns. However, constrained by\nthe expressive capacity of generative models, existing \\textit{generative\nreplay} methods face challenges in faithfully reconstructing the data\ndistribution of past tasks, particularly in scenarios with a myriad of tasks or\nhigh-dimensional data. Inspired by the success of diffusion models in various\ngenerative tasks, this paper introduces a novel continual RL algorithm DISTR\n(Diffusion-based Trajectory Replay) that employs a diffusion model to memorize\nthe high-return trajectory distribution of each encountered task and wakeups\nthese distributions during the policy learning on new tasks. Besides,\nconsidering the impracticality of replaying all past data each time, a\nprioritization mechanism is proposed to prioritize the trajectory replay of\npivotal tasks in our method. Empirical experiments on the popular continual RL\nbenchmark \\texttt{Continual World} demonstrate that our proposed method obtains\na favorable balance between \\textit{stability} and \\textit{plasticity},\nsurpassing various existing continual RL baselines in average success rate.",

    "abstract": "The vision tokens in multimodal large language models usually exhibit\nsignificant spatial and temporal redundancy and take up most of the input\ntokens, which harms their inference efficiency. To solve this problem, some\nrecent works were introduced to drop the unimportant tokens during inference\nwhere the importance of each token is decided only by the information in either\nthe vision encoding stage or the prefilling stage. In this paper, we propose\nMulti-stage Token Dropping (MustDrop) to measure the importance of each token\nfrom the whole lifecycle, including the vision encoding stage, prefilling\nstage, and decoding stage. Concretely, in the visual encoding stage, MustDrop\nmerges spatially adjacent tokens with high similarity, and establishes a key\ntoken set to retain the most vision-critical tokens, preventing them from being\ndiscarded in later stages. In the prefilling stage, MustDrop further compresses\nvision tokens by the guidance of text semantics, with a dual-attention\nfiltering strategy. In the decoding stage, an output-aware cache policy is\nproposed to further reduce the size of the KV cache. By leveraging tailored\nstrategies in the multi-stage process, MustDrop can more precisely recognize\nthe important and redundant tokens, thus achieving an optimal balance between\nperformance and efficiency. For instance, MustDrop reduces about 88.5\\% FLOPs\non LLaVA with a compression ratio of 92.2\\% while maintaining comparable\naccuracy.

    "abstract": "In observational studies, the assumption of sufficient overlap (positivity)\nis fundamental for the identification and estimation of causal effects. Failing\nto account for this assumption yields inaccurate and potentially infeasible\nestimators. To address this issue, we introduce a simple yet novel approach,\n\\textit{mixing}, which mitigates overlap violations by constructing a synthetic\ntreated group that combines treated and control units. Our strategy offers\nthree key advantages. First, it improves the accuracy of the estimator by\npreserving unbiasedness while reducing variance. The benefit is particularly\nsignificant in settings with weak overlap, though the method remains effective\nregardless of the overlap level. This phenomenon results from the shrinkage of\npropensity scores in the mixed sample, which enhances robustness to poor\noverlap. Second, it enables direct estimation of the target estimand without\ndiscarding extreme observations or modifying the target population, thus\nfacilitating a straightforward interpretation of the results. Third, the mixing\napproach is highly adaptable to various weighting schemes, including\ncontemporary methods such as entropy balancing. The estimation of the Mixed IPW\n(MIPW) estimator is done via M-estimation, and the method extends to a broader\nclass of weighting estimators through a resampling algorithm. We illustrate the\nmixing approach through extensive simulation studies and provide practical\nguidance with a real-data analysis.",

An effective jailbreak approach is to identify a\ndomain where safety generalization fails, a phenomenon known as mismatched\ngeneralization. In this paper, we introduce two novel jailbreak methods based\non mismatched generalization: natural language games and custom language games,\nboth of which effectively bypass the safety mechanisms of LLMs, with various\nkinds and different variants, making them hard to defend and leading to high\nattack rates. Natural language games involve the use of synthetic linguistic\nconstructs and the actions intertwined with these constructs, such as the Ubbi\nDubbi language. Building on this phenomenon, we propose the custom language\ngames method: by engaging with LLMs using a variety of custom rules, we\nsuccessfully execute jailbreak attacks across multiple LLM platforms. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods, achieving success\nrates of 93% on GPT-4o, 89% on GPT-4o-mini and 83% on Claude-3.5-Sonnet.\nFurthermore, to investigate the generalizability of safety alignments, we\nfine-tuned Llama-3.1-70B with the custom language games to achieve safety\nalignment within our datasets and found that when interacting through other\nlanguage games, the fine-tuned models still failed to identify harmful content.\nThis finding indicates that the safety alignment knowledge embedded in LLMs\nfails to generalize across different linguistic formats, thus opening new\navenues for future research in this area.",

    "abstract": "Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is critical to ensure the safe deployment\nof deep learning models in critical applications. Deep learning models can\noften misidentify OOD samples as in-distribution (ID) samples. This\nvulnerability worsens in the presence of spurious correlation in the training\nset. Likewise, in fine-grained classification settings, detection of\nfine-grained OOD samples becomes inherently challenging due to their high\nsimilarity to ID samples. However, current research on OOD detection has\nlargely ignored these challenging scenarios, focusing instead on relatively\neasier (conventional) cases. In this work, we present a unified Approach to\nSpurious, fine-grained, and Conventional OOD Detection (ASCOOD). First, we\npropose synthesizing virtual outliers from ID data by approximating the\ndestruction of invariant features. To this end, we identify invariant features\nwith the pixel attribution method using the model being learned. This approach\neliminates the burden of curating external OOD datasets. Then, we\nsimultaneously incentivize ID classification and predictive uncertainty towards\nvirtual outliers leveraging standardized feature representation. Our approach\neffectively mitigates the impact of spurious correlations and encourages\ncapturing fine-grained attributes. Extensive experiments across seven datasets\ndemonstrate the merit of ASCOOD in spurious, fine-grained, and conventional\nsettings.

Specifically, we allow the seller to design information before setting\nthe fixed price, which implies that we study the mechanism design problem in a\nbroader space. We call this mechanism space the fixed-price signaling\nmechanism.\n  We assume that buyers' valuation of the item depends on the quality of the\nitem. The seller can privately observe the item's quality, whereas buyers only\nsee its distribution. In this case, the seller can influence buyers' valuations\nby strategically disclosing information about the item's quality, thereby\nadjusting the fixed price. We consider two types of buyers with different\nlevels of rationality: ex-post individual rational (IR) and ex-interim\nindividual rational. We show that when the market has only one buyer, the\noptimal revenue generated by the fixed-price signaling mechanism is identical\nto that of the fixed-price mechanism, regardless of the level of rationality.\nFurthermore, when there are multiple buyers in the market and all of them are\nex-post IR, we show that there is no fixed-price mechanism that is obedient for\nall buyers.

    "abstract": "Radiology reporting generative AI holds significant potential to alleviate\nclinical workloads and streamline medical care. However, achieving high\nclinical accuracy is challenging, as radiological images often feature subtle\nlesions and intricate structures. Existing systems often fall short, largely\ndue to their reliance on fixed size, patch-level image features and\ninsufficient incorporation of pathological information. This can result in the\nneglect of such subtle patterns and inconsistent descriptions of crucial\npathologies. To address these challenges, we propose an innovative approach\nthat leverages pathology-aware regional prompts to explicitly integrate\nanatomical and pathological information of various scales, significantly\nenhancing the precision and clinical relevance of generated reports. We develop\nan anatomical region detector that extracts features from distinct anatomical\nareas, coupled with a novel multi-label lesion detector that identifies global\npathologies. Our approach emulates the diagnostic process of radiologists,\nproducing clinically accurate reports with comprehensive diagnostic\ncapabilities. Experimental results show that our model outperforms previous\nstate-of-the-art methods on most natural language generation and clinical\nefficacy metrics, with formal expert evaluations affirming its potential to\nenhance radiology practice.",

    "abstract": "Deploying deep models in real-world scenarios remains challenging due to\nsignificant performance drops under distribution shifts between training and\ndeployment environments. Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) has recently emerged as a\npromising solution, enabling on-the-fly model adaptation without access to\nsource data. However, its effectiveness degrades significantly in the presence\nof complex, mixed distribution shifts - common in practical settings - where\nmultiple latent domains coexist. Adapting under such intrinsic heterogeneity,\nespecially in unlabeled and online conditions, remains an open and\nunderexplored challenge. In this paper, we study TTA under mixed distribution\nshifts and move beyond conventional homogeneous adaptation paradigms. By\nrevisiting TTA from a frequency-domain perspective, we observe that\ndistribution heterogeneity often manifests in Fourier space - for instance,\nhigh-frequency components tend to carry domain-specific variations. This\nmotivates us to perform domain-aware separation using high-frequency texture\ncues, making diverse shift patterns more tractable. To this end, we propose\nFreDA, a novel Frequency-based Decentralized Adaptation framework that\ndecomposes globally heterogeneous data into locally homogeneous components in\nthe frequency domain. It further employs decentralized learning and\naugmentation strategies to robustly adapt under complex, evolving shifts.\nExtensive experiments across various environments (corrupted, natural, and\nmedical) demonstrate the superiority of our proposed framework over the\nstate-of-the-arts.",

The performance of these algorithms and, in the\ncase of particle Metropolis--Hastings, the trade off between improved mixing\nthrough increased accuracy of the estimator and the computational cost were\ninvestigated independently in two papers, both published in 2015. Each\nsuggested choosing the number of particles so that the variance of the\nlogarithm of the estimator of the posterior at a fixed sensible parameter value\nis approximately 1. This advice has been widely and successfully adopted. We\nprovide new, remarkably simple upper and lower bounds on the asymptotic\nvariance of PMMH algorithms.

In most situations our guidelines and those from 2015\nclosely coincide; however, when the two differ it is safer to follow the new\nguidance.

Despite\nthese efforts, the integration of LLMs and KGs for CRSs remains challenging due\nto the modality gap between unstructured dialogues and structured KGs.\nMoreover, LLMs pre-trained on large-scale corpora may not be well-suited for\nanalyzing user preferences, which require domain-specific knowledge.

This enables the LLM to transform KG entities into concise natural\nlanguage descriptions, allowing them to comprehend domain-specific knowledge.\nFollowing, COMPASS optimizes user preference modeling via knowledge-aware\ninstruction fine-tuning, where the LLM learns to reason and summarize user\npreferences from both dialogue histories and KG-augmented context.

    "abstract": "Label imbalance and homophily-heterophily mixture are the fundamental\nproblems encountered when applying Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to Graph Fraud\nDetection (GFD) tasks. Existing GNN-based GFD models are designed to augment\ngraph structure to accommodate the inductive bias of GNNs towards homophily, by\nexcluding heterophilic neighbors during message passing. In our work, we argue\nthat the key to applying GNNs for GFD is not to exclude but to {\\em\ndistinguish} neighbors with different labels. Grounded in this perspective, we\nintroduce Partitioning Message Passing (PMP), an intuitive yet effective\nmessage passing paradigm expressly crafted for GFD. Specifically, in the\nneighbor aggregation stage of PMP, neighbors with different classes are\naggregated with distinct node-specific aggregation functions. By this means,\nthe center node can adaptively adjust the information aggregated from its\nheterophilic and homophilic neighbors, thus avoiding the model gradient being\ndominated by benign nodes which occupy the majority of the population. We\ntheoretically establish a connection between the spatial formulation of PMP and\nspectral analysis to characterize that PMP operates an adaptive node-specific\nspectral graph filter, which demonstrates the capability of PMP to handle\nheterophily-homophily mixed graphs. Extensive experimental results show that\nPMP can significantly boost the performance on GFD tasks.",

However, the limited information in SDRTV and the diversity of styles\nin real-world conversions render this process an ill-posed problem, thereby\nconstraining the performance and generalization of these methods. Inspired by\ngenerative approaches, we propose a novel method for SDRTV to HDRTV conversion\nguided by real HDRTV priors.

This shift\ntransforms the task from solving an unreferenced prediction problem to making a\nreferenced selection, thereby markedly enhancing the accuracy and reliability\nof the conversion process. Specifically, our approach comprises two stages: the\nfirst stage employs a Vector Quantized Generative Adversarial Network to\ncapture HDRTV priors, while the second stage matches these priors to the input\nSDRTV content to recover realistic HDRTV outputs.

Meanwhile, a Stackelberg game model, establishing the roadside\nunits (RSUs) and parking vehicles (PVs) as leaders and the requesting vehicles\n(RVs) as follower, is utilized to optimize the offloading strategy and pricing.\nSubsequently, a BPVEC offloading strategy algorithm with gradient descent\nmethod is designed to maximize system revenue. Simulation results show that the\nproposed BPVEC offloading scheme is secure and reliable while ensuring maximum\nbenefits.",

First, we propose a general framework for constructing\ncarbon-cycle emulators (CCEs) for macroeconomic models. The framework is\nimplemented as a generalized linear multi-reservoir (box) model that conserves\nkey physical quantities and can be customized for specific applications. We\nconsider three versions of the CCE, which we evaluate within a simple\nrepresentative agent economic model: (i) a three-box setting comparable to\nDICE-2016, (ii) a four-box extension, and (iii) a four-box version that\nexplicitly captures land-use change. While the three-box model reproduces\nbenchmark results well and the fourth reservoir adds little, incorporating the\nimpact of land-use change on the carbon storage capacity of the terrestrial\nbiosphere substantially alters atmospheric carbon stocks, temperature\ntrajectories, and the optimal mitigation path. Second, we investigate\npattern-scaling techniques that transform global-mean temperature projections\nfrom CEs into spatially heterogeneous warming fields. We show how regional\nbaseline climates, non-uniform warming, and the associated uncertainties\npropagate into economic damages.",

    "abstract": "As core thermal power generation equipment, steam turbines incur significant\nexpenses and adverse effects on operation when facing interruptions like\ndowntime, maintenance, and damage. Accurate anomaly detection is the\nprerequisite for ensuring the safe and stable operation of steam turbines.\nHowever, challenges in steam turbine anomaly detection, including inherent\nanomalies, lack of temporal information analysis, and high-dimensional data\ncomplexity, limit the effectiveness of existing methods. To address these\nchallenges, we proposed an Enhanced Long Short-Term Memory Variational\nAutoencoder using Deep Advanced Features and Gaussian Mixture Model\n(ELSTMVAE-DAF-GMM) for precise unsupervised anomaly detection in unlabeled\ndatasets. Specifically, LSTMVAE, integrating LSTM with VAE, was used to project\nhigh-dimensional time-series data to a low-dimensional phase space. The Deep\nAutoencoder-Local Outlier Factor (DAE-LOF) sample selection mechanism was used\nto eliminate inherent anomalies during training, further improving the model's\nprecision and reliability. The novel deep advanced features (DAF) hybridize\nlatent embeddings and reconstruction discrepancies from the LSTMVAE model and\nprovide a more comprehensive data representation within a continuous and\nstructured phase space, significantly enhancing anomaly detection by\nsynergizing temporal dynamics with data pattern variations. These DAF were\nincorporated into GMM to ensure robust and effective unsupervised anomaly\ndetection.

We\nreplace the singular uncompensated Young stress by a smooth function with a\ncharacteristic width $\\varepsilon > 0$ that is understood as a physical\nparameter of the model. Therefore, we call the model the ``Contact Region\nGNBC'' (CR-GNBC). We show that the model is consistent with the fundamental\nkinematics of the contact angle transport described by Fricke, K\\\"ohne and\nBothe. We implement the model in the geometrical Volume-of-Fluid solver\nBasilisk using a ``free angle'' approach. This means that the dynamic contact\nangle is not prescribed but reconstructed from the interface geometry and\nsubsequently applied as an input parameter to compute the uncompensated Young\nstress. We couple this approach to the two-phase Navier Stokes solver and study\nthe withdrawing tape problem with a receding contact line. It is shown that the\nmodel allows for grid-independent solutions and leads to a full regularization\nof the singularity at the moving contact line, which is in accordance with the\nthin-film equation subject to this boundary condition. In particular, it is\nshown that the curvature at the moving contact line is finite and mesh\nconverging. As predicted by the fundamental kinematics, the parallel shear\nstress component vanishes at the moving contact line for quasi-stationary\nstates (i.e. for $\\dot{\\theta}_d=0$) and the dynamic contact angle is\ndetermined by a balance between the uncompensated Young stress and an effective\ncontact line friction.

Away from the phase-transition point, correlation function\ntypically satisfies the clustering property, meaning that the correlation\nconcentrates at short ranges while decays rapidly (exponentially) at long\ndistances. Though the clustering property has been extensively studied for spin\nand fermion systems, whether a similar result holds for boson systems remains a\nlong-standing open problem. The essential difficulty lies in the infinite\nHilbert-space dimension of a boson, in stark contrast to the finite dimension\nof a spin or fermion. This work is devoted to establishing the boson\ncounterpart of the clustering of correlations at high temperatures, focusing\nprimarily on the canonical Bose-Hubbard model. As a byproduct, we rigorously\njustify the low-boson-density assumption for the Gibbs state of the\nBose-Hubbard type.

    "abstract": "With the rapid growth of interdisciplinary demands for geospatial modeling\nand the rise of large language models (LLMs), geospatial code generation\ntechnology has seen significant advancements. However, existing LLMs often face\nchallenges in the geospatial code generation process due to incomplete or\nunclear user requirements and insufficient knowledge of specific platform\nsyntax rules, leading to the generation of non-executable code, a phenomenon\nknown as \"code hallucination.\" To address this issue, this paper proposes a\nChain of Programming (CoP) framework, which decomposes the code generation\nprocess into five steps: requirement analysis, algorithm design, code\nimplementation, code debugging, and code annotation. The framework incorporates\na shared information pool, knowledge base retrieval, and user feedback\nmechanisms, forming an end-to-end code generation flow from requirements to\ncode without the need for model fine-tuning. Based on a geospatial problem\nclassification framework and evaluation benchmarks, the CoP strategy\nsignificantly improves the logical clarity, syntactical correctness, and\nexecutability of the generated code, with improvements ranging from 3.0% to\n48.8%. Comparative and ablation experiments further validate the superiority of\nthe CoP strategy over other optimization approaches and confirm the rationality\nand necessity of its key components. Through case studies on building data\nvisualization and fire data analysis, this paper demonstrates the application\nand effectiveness of CoP in various geospatial scenarios.

    "abstract": "In zero-shot skeleton-based action recognition (ZSAR), aligning skeleton\nfeatures with the text features of action labels is essential for accurately\npredicting unseen actions. ZSAR faces a fundamental challenge in bridging the\nmodality gap between the two-kind features, which severely limits\ngeneralization to unseen actions. Previous methods focus on direct alignment\nbetween skeleton and text latent spaces, but the modality gaps between these\nspaces hinder robust generalization learning. Motivated by the success of\ndiffusion models in multi-modal alignment (e.g., text-to-image, text-to-video),\nwe firstly present a diffusion-based skeleton-text alignment framework for\nZSAR. Our approach, Triplet Diffusion for Skeleton-Text Matching (TDSM),\nfocuses on cross-alignment power of diffusion models rather than their\ngenerative capability. Specifically, TDSM aligns skeleton features with text\nprompts by incorporating text features into the reverse diffusion process,\nwhere skeleton features are denoised under text guidance, forming a unified\nskeleton-text latent space for robust matching. To enhance discriminative\npower, we introduce a triplet diffusion (TD) loss that encourages our TDSM to\ncorrect skeleton-text matches while pushing them apart for different action\nclasses. Our TDSM significantly outperforms very recent state-of-the-art\nmethods with significantly large margins of 2.36%-point to 13.05%-point,\ndemonstrating superior accuracy and scalability in zero-shot settings through\neffective skeleton-text matching.",

    "abstract": "Existing studies for gait recognition primarily utilized sequences of either\nbinary silhouette or human parsing to encode the shapes and dynamics of persons\nduring walking. Silhouettes exhibit accurate segmentation quality and\nrobustness to environmental variations, but their low information entropy may\nresult in sub-optimal performance. In contrast, human parsing provides\nfine-grained part segmentation with higher information entropy, but the\nsegmentation quality may deteriorate due to the complex environments. To\ndiscover the advantages of silhouette and parsing and overcome their\nlimitations, this paper proposes a novel cross-granularity alignment gait\nrecognition method, named XGait, to unleash the power of gait representations\nof different granularity. To achieve this goal, the XGait first contains two\nbranches of backbone encoders to map the silhouette sequences and the parsing\nsequences into two latent spaces, respectively. Moreover, to explore the\ncomplementary knowledge across the features of two representations, we design\nthe Global Cross-granularity Module (GCM) and the Part Cross-granularity Module\n(PCM) after the two encoders. In particular, the GCM aims to enhance the\nquality of parsing features by leveraging global features from silhouettes,\nwhile the PCM aligns the dynamics of human parts between silhouette and parsing\nfeatures using the high information entropy in parsing sequences. In addition,\nto effectively guide the alignment of two representations with different\ngranularity at the part level, an elaborate-designed learnable division\nmechanism is proposed for the parsing features. Comprehensive experiments on\ntwo large-scale gait datasets not only show the superior performance of XGait\nwith the Rank-1 accuracy of 80.5% on Gait3D and 88.3% CCPG but also reflect the\nrobustness of the learned features even under challenging conditions like\nocclusions and cloth changes.",

    "abstract": "Chirality is pivotal in magnonics, particularly for achieving spin wave\nnon-reciprocity which is critical in advancing spin wave based communication\nand logic operations. In general, chirality in magnetic systems is realized\nthrough the interfacial antisymmetric exchange interaction, namely, the\nDzyaloshinskii-Moriya Interaction (DMI), which is an intrinsic phenomenon\noccurring at the buried interface of ferromagnet and heavy metal. In this work,\nusing micromagnetic simulations, we present a new route to achieve spin wave\nnonreciprocity using an engineered chiral magnonic crystal, where we\nartificially created in-plane twisted spin textures by imposing certain\nhandedness in the structural geometry. The manipulation of the relative\narrangement of these chiral enantiomers led to spin wave non-reciprocity, which\ncould be tuned by selecting different channels within the crystal, with\nadditional versatility in the resonant mode frequency. Further adjustment of\nthe external magnetic field strength confirms that the spin wave directionality\noriginates from the spin texture. This enables additional control over the band\ngap and mode propagation characteristics by external field tuning. Our work\nprovides a novel and innovative route to simultaneously access opposite spin\nwave directions in consecutive channels, which makes this system competent for\nreal on-chip magnonic diode, with predefined paths for counter-propagating\ninformation.",

These banded structures have been suspected to\noriginate from a bounce resonance between particles and standing Alfven waves\ngenerated by the moon-magnetospheric interaction. Here, we show that\npredictions from the above hypothesis are inconsistent with the observations,\nand propose an alternative interpretation that the banded structures are remote\nsignals of particle absorption at the moons. In this scenario, whether a\nparticle would encounter the moon before reaching Juno depends on the number of\nbounce cycles it experiences within a fixed section of drift motion determined\nby moon-spacecraft longitudinal separation. Therefore, the absorption bands are\nexpected to appear at discrete, equally-spaced velocities consistent with the\nobservations. This finding improves our understanding of moon-plasma\ninteractions and provides a potential way to evaluate the Jovian magnetospheric\nmodels.",

GenAI has the capacity to\naddress these issues by supporting content knowledge acquisition, a role that\ncurrently dominates teacher education programs. By taking on this foundational\nrole, GenAI allows teacher educators to redirect their focus to other critical\nareas, including pedagogical modeling, authentic assessments, and fostering\ndigital literacy and critical thinking.

However, first, these\nmethods are limited in flexibility. They rely on bug-triggering test cases to\nperform FL and cannot make use of other available bug-related information,\ne.g., bug reports. Second, they are built upon proprietary LLMs, which are,\nalthough powerful, confronted with risks in data privacy. To address these\nlimitations, we propose a novel LLM-based FL framework named FlexFL, which can\nflexibly leverage different types of bug-related information and effectively\nwork with open-source LLMs. FlexFL is composed of two stages. In the first\nstage, FlexFL reduces the search space of buggy code using state-of-the-art FL\ntechniques of different families and provides a candidate list of bug-related\nmethods. In the second stage, FlexFL leverages LLMs to delve deeper to\ndouble-check the code snippets of methods suggested by the first stage and\nrefine fault localization results. In each stage, FlexFL constructs agents\nbased on open-source LLMs, which share the same pipeline that does not\npostulate any type of bug-related information and can interact with function\ncalls without the out-of-the-box capability. Extensive experimental results on\nDefects4J demonstrate that FlexFL outperforms the baselines and can work with\ndifferent open-source LLMs. Specifically, FlexFL with a lightweight open-source\nLLM Llama3-8B can locate 42 and 63 more bugs than two state-of-the-art\nLLM-based FL approaches AutoFL and AgentFL that both use GPT-3.5.",

However, due to the varying proportions of different\ndegradations within an image, these scene descriptors may not accurately\ndifferentiate between degradations, leading to suboptimal restoration in\npractical applications. To address this issue, we propose a novel\nTransformer-based restoration framework, AllRestorer. In AllRestorer, we enable\nthe model to adaptively consider all image impairments, thereby avoiding errors\nfrom scene descriptor misdirection. Specifically, we introduce an All-in-One\nTransformer Block (AiOTB), which adaptively removes all degradations present in\na given image by modeling the relationships between all degradations and the\nimage embedding in latent space. To accurately address different variations\npotentially present within the same type of degradation and minimize ambiguity,\nAiOTB utilizes a composite scene descriptor consisting of both image and text\nembeddings to define the degradation. Furthermore, AiOTB includes an adaptive\nweight for each degradation, allowing for precise control of the restoration\nintensity.

Our approach is based on Birkhoff\ndecomposition (also referred to as Birkhoff von-Neumann decomposition) which\nallows construction of an extension that is always a convex combination of the\nobjective's values at permutations. We show how to construct a specific family\nof Birkhoff decompositions that are continuous. In addition to continuity, our\nextension has several nice properties making it appealing for optimization\nproblems. First, BE provides a rounding guarantee, namely any solution to the\nextension can be efficiently rounded to a permutation without increasing the\nfunction value. Furthermore, an approximate solution in the relaxed case (with\nextension) will give rise to an approximate solution in the space of\npermutations. Second, using BE, any real-valued optimization objective on\npermutations can be extended to an almost everywhere differentiable objective\nfunction over the space of doubly stochastic matrices. This makes our BE\namenable to not only gradient-descent based optimizations, but also\nunsupervised neural combinatorial optimization where training often requires a\ndifferentiable loss. Third, based on the above properties, we present a simple\noptimization procedure which can be readily combined with existing optimization\napproaches to offer local improvements (i.e., the quality of the final solution\nis no worse than the initial solution).

We\ndemonstrate that linear or nearly linear stochastic systems near a dynamical\nattractor can exhibit transiently repulsive dynamics -- termed\npseudo-bifurcations -- when their interacting components are sufficiently\nasymmetric and hierarchically organized, that is, when the system is\nnon-normal. The term `pseudo' reflects the central role of the pseudospectrum\nin non-normal operators, whose positive pseudo-eigenvalues quantify these\ntransient unstable regimes despite the system's asymptotic stability. These\npseudo-bifurcations produce early-warning signals commonly linked to\nbifurcations, such as dimension reduction, critical slowing down, and increased\nvariance. Furthermore, we show that non-normal transients systematically emerge\nwell before actual bifurcations occur, complicating their distinction and\npotentially introducing a bias that makes the system appear much closer to a\ncritical point than it truly is. We support our analytical derivations with\nnumerical simulations and by empirically demonstrating that the brain exhibits\nclear signs of such non-normal transients during epileptic seizures.

    "abstract": "Remote sensing (RS) visual grounding aims to use natural language expression\nto locate specific objects (in the form of the bounding box or segmentation\nmask) in RS images, enhancing human interaction with intelligent RS\ninterpretation systems. Early research in this area was primarily based on\nhorizontal bounding boxes (HBBs), but as more diverse RS datasets have become\navailable, tasks involving oriented bounding boxes (OBBs) and segmentation\nmasks have emerged. In practical applications, different targets require\ndifferent grounding types: HBB can localize an object's position, OBB provides\nits orientation, and mask depicts its shape. However, existing specialized\nmethods are typically tailored to a single type of RS visual grounding task and\nare hard to generalize across tasks. In contrast, large vision-language models\n(VLMs) exhibit powerful multi-task learning capabilities but struggle to handle\ndense prediction tasks like segmentation. This paper proposes GeoGround, a\nnovel framework that unifies support for HBB, OBB, and mask RS visual grounding\ntasks, allowing flexible output selection. Rather than customizing the\narchitecture of VLM, our work aims to elegantly support pixel-level visual\ngrounding output through the Text-Mask technique. We define prompt-assisted and\ngeometry-guided learning to enhance consistency across different signals.\nExperimental results show that GeoGround demonstrates strong performance across\nfour RS visual grounding tasks, matching the performance of specialized methods\non multiple benchmarks.

    "abstract": "As legged robots take on roles in industrial and autonomous construction,\ncollaborative loco-manipulation is crucial for handling large and heavy objects\nthat exceed the capabilities of a single robot. However, ensuring the safety of\nthese multi-robot tasks is essential to prevent accidents and guarantee\nreliable operation. This paper presents a hierarchical control system for\nobject manipulation using a team of quadrupedal robots. The combination of the\nmotion planner and the decentralized locomotion controller in a hierarchical\nstructure enables safe, adaptive planning for teams in complex scenarios. A\nhigh-level nonlinear model predictive control planner generates collision-free\npaths by incorporating control barrier functions, accounting for static and\ndynamic obstacles. This process involves calculating contact points and forces\nwhile adapting to unknown objects and terrain properties. The decentralized\nloco-manipulation controller then ensures each robot maintains stable\nlocomotion and manipulation based on the planner's guidance. The effectiveness\nof our method is carefully examined in simulations under various conditions and\nvalidated in real-life setups with robot hardware. By modifying the object's\nconfiguration, the robot team can maneuver unknown objects through an\nenvironment containing both static and dynamic obstacles.

Recent work, MeZO, addresses this issue using a\nzeroth-order (ZO) optimization method, which reduces memory consumption by\nmatching the usage to the inference phase. However, MeZO experiences slow\nconvergence due to varying curvatures across model parameters. To overcome this\nlimitation, we introduce HELENE, a novel scalable and memory-efficient\noptimizer that integrates annealed A-GNB gradients with a diagonal Hessian\nestimation and layer-wise clipping, serving as a second-order pre-conditioner.\nThis combination allows for faster and more stable convergence. Our theoretical\nanalysis demonstrates that HELENE improves convergence rates, particularly for\nmodels with heterogeneous layer dimensions, by reducing the dependency on the\ntotal parameter space dimension. Instead, the method scales with the largest\nlayer dimension, making it highly suitable for modern LLM architectures.\nExperimental results on RoBERTa-large and OPT-1.3B across multiple tasks show\nthat HELENE achieves up to a 20x speedup compared to MeZO, with average\naccuracy improvements of 1.5%. Furthermore, HELENE remains compatible with both\nfull parameter tuning and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), outperforming\nseveral state-of-the-art optimizers.

However, the rapid\nproliferation of LLMs (with over 560 companies developing or deploying them as\nof 2024) has raised concerns about their originality and trustworthiness. A\nnotable issue, termed identity confusion, has emerged, where LLMs misrepresent\ntheir origins or identities. This study systematically examines identity\nconfusion through three research questions: (1) How prevalent is identity\nconfusion among LLMs? (2) Does it arise from model reuse, plagiarism, or\nhallucination? (3) What are the security and trust-related impacts of identity\nconfusion? To address these, we developed an automated tool combining\ndocumentation analysis, self-identity recognition testing, and output\nsimilarity comparisons--established methods for LLM fingerprinting--and\nconducted a structured survey via Credamo to assess its impact on user trust.\nOur analysis of 27 LLMs revealed that 25.93% exhibit identity confusion. Output\nsimilarity analysis confirmed that these issues stem from hallucinations rather\nthan replication or reuse. Survey results further highlighted that identity\nconfusion significantly erodes trust, particularly in critical tasks like\neducation and professional use, with declines exceeding those caused by logical\nerrors or inconsistencies. Users attributed these failures to design flaws,\nincorrect training data, and perceived plagiarism, underscoring the systemic\nrisks posed by identity confusion to LLM reliability and trustworthiness.",

Due to the application of deep learning, current UIE methods have\nmade significant progress. Most of the existing deep learning-based UIE methods\nfollow a single-stage network which cannot effectively address the diverse\ndegradations simultaneously. In this paper, we propose to address this issue by\ndesigning a two-stage deep learning framework and taking advantage of cascaded\ncontrastive learning to guide the network training of each stage. The proposed\nmethod is called CCL-Net in short. Specifically, the proposed CCL-Net involves\ntwo cascaded stages, i.e., a color correction stage tailored to the color\ndeviation issue and a haze removal stage tailored to improve the visibility and\ncontrast of underwater images. To guarantee the underwater image can be\nprogressively enhanced, we also apply contrastive loss as an additional\nconstraint to guide the training of each stage. In the first stage, the raw\nunderwater images are used as negative samples for building the first\ncontrastive loss, ensuring the enhanced results of the first color correction\nstage are better than the original inputs. While in the second stage, the\nenhanced results rather than the raw underwater images of the first color\ncorrection stage are used as the negative samples for building the second\ncontrastive loss, thus ensuring the final enhanced results of the second haze\nremoval stage are better than the intermediate color corrected results.\nExtensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that our\nCCL-Net can achieve superior performance compared to many state-of-the-art\nmethods.

However, existing methods often neglect the\ncomplementary role of infrared image in restoring visible image features under\nhazy conditions. To address this, we propose a joint learning framework that\nutilizes infrared image for the restoration and fusion of hazy IR-VIS images.\nTo mitigate the adverse effects of feature diversity between IR-VIS images, we\nintroduce a prompt generation mechanism that regulates modality-specific\nfeature incompatibility. This creates a prompt selection matrix from non-shared\nimage information, followed by prompt embeddings generated from a prompt pool.\nThese embeddings help generate candidate features for dehazing. We further\ndesign an infrared-assisted feature restoration mechanism that selects\ncandidate features based on haze density, enabling simultaneous restoration and\nfusion within a single-stage framework. To enhance fusion quality, we construct\na multi-stage prompt embedding fusion module that leverages feature\nsupplementation from the prompt generation module. Our method effectively fuses\nIR-VIS images while removing haze, yielding clear, haze-free fusion results. In\ncontrast to two-stage methods that dehaze and then fuse, our approach enables\ncollaborative training in a single-stage framework, making the model relatively\nlightweight and suitable for practical deployment.

However,\nnonlinear impairments caused by bandwidth-limited high-power transmitter and\nsensitive receiver severely degrade the data rate of long-distance UWOC.

The combined linear equalizer and\nlow-complexity Artificial Neural Network (ANN) equalizer are used to achieve\n1-Gbps data transmission over a 250-m UWOC system. To the best of our\nknowledge, this is the first Gbps-level UWOC experimental demonstration in\n>250-meter underwater transmission that has ever been reported. To lower the\ncomplexity of the ANN equalizer, a linear equalizer is applied first in order\nto prune the input size of the ANN equalizer. The optimal input size of the ANN\nequalizer is identified as 9. And the ANN architecture consists of two hidden\nlayers, with 10 neurons in the first layer and a single neuron in the second\nlayer.

This horizontal solution will completely fail\nwhen facing large-scale (>50%) model poisoning attacks. In this work, based on\nthe key insight that the convergence process of the model is a highly\npredictable process, we break away from the traditional horizontal solution of\ndefense and innovatively transform the problem of solving the optimal\naggregation gradients into a vertical solution problem. We propose VERT, which\nuses global communication rounds as the vertical axis, trains a predictor using\nhistorical gradients information to predict user gradients, and compares the\nsimilarity with actual user gradients to precisely and efficiently select the\noptimal aggregation gradients. In order to reduce the computational complexity\nof VERT, we design a low dimensional vector projector to project the user\ngradients to a computationally acceptable length, and then perform subsequent\npredictor training and prediction tasks. Exhaustive experiments show that VERT\nis efficient and scalable, exhibiting excellent large-scale (>=80%) model\npoisoning defense effects under different FL scenarios.

    "abstract": "Intriguing physical phenomena observed in natural materials have inspired the\ndevelopment of several engineering materials with dramatically improved\nperformance. Marine sponge glass fibers, for instance, have attracted interest\nin recent decades. We tested the glass fibers in tension and observed that the\nstrength of these fibers scales inversely with their size. While it is expected\nthat the strength of a material scales inversely with its size, the scaling is\ngenerally believed to be inversely proportional to the square root of the\nspecimen dimension. Interestingly, we found that the marine sponge glass\nfibers' strength scaled much faster, and was inversely proportional to the\nsquare of the specimen dimension. Such non-classical scaling is consistent with\nthe experimental measurements and classical linear elastic fracture mechanics.\nWe hypothesize that this enhanced scaling is due to the flaw size decreasing\nfaster than the size of the specimen. The tensile strength, as a result of\nnon-classical, higher-order scaling, reached a value as large as 1.5 GPa for\nthe smallest diameter specimen. The manufacturing processes through which the\nspicules are made might hold important lesson for further enhancing the\nstrength of engineering materials.",

Retrieval-based SD methods, one kind of\nmodel-free method, have yielded promising speedup, but they often rely on\nincomplete retrieval resources, inefficient retrieval methods, and are\nconstrained to certain domains. This paper presents a novel retrieval-based\nspeculative decoding method that adapts suffix automaton (SAM) for efficient\nand accurate draft generation by utilizing common text corpus and dynamic text\nsequence. Unlike existing $n$-gram matching methods, SAM-Decoding finds the\nexact longest suffix match, achieving an average time complexity of O(1) per\ngeneration step of SAM update and suffix retrieval. It can also integrate with\nexisting methods, adaptively selecting a draft generation strategy based on\nmatch length to generalize to broader domains. Extensive experiments on\nSpec-Bench show that our method is $18\\%+$ faster than other retrieval-based SD\nmethods.

In the study of cavity-based light-matter\ninteractions, the bad-cavity limit is often encountered, where the damping rate\nof the cavity is much larger than the interaction strength. The fast-damped\ncavity will quickly relax to a quasi-stationary state, and one can eliminate\nthe cavity from the equation of motion by setting its time derivative to zero.\nElimination of the cavity in the bad-cavity limit can reduce the dimensionality\nof the equations of motion of the system. However, we find that the adiabatic\nelimination procedure performed in the quantum Langevin equation leads to an\nincorrect commutation relation, which was rarely discussed in the former\nstudies, as far as we know. Here, we show the incorrect commutation relation\narises from the fact that the high frequency of the vacuum noise should be cut\noff to perform adiabatic elimination, but the noise with high frequency cutoff\nis still treated as white noise with infinite bandwidth and delta commutation\nrelation. We also study the correlation function and show that the high\nfrequency part of noise contributes very little when averaged over the bath.\nTherefore, the adiabatic elimination method can reduce the complexity of the\ncalculations while maintaining physical reliability.",

    "abstract": "Latency is a major concern for web rendering engines like those in Chrome,\nSafari, and Firefox. These engines reduce latency by using an incremental\nlayout algorithm to redraw the page when the user interacts with it. In such an\nalgorithm, elements that change frame-to-frame are marked dirty, and only those\nelements are processed to draw the next frame, dramatically reducing latency.\nHowever, the standard incremental layout algorithm must search the page for\ndirty elements, accessing auxiliary elements in the process. These auxiliary\nelements add cache misses and stalled cycles, and are responsible for a sizable\nfraction of all layout latency. We introduce a new, faster incremental layout\nalgorithm called Spineless Traversal. Spineless Traversal uses a\ncache-friendlier priority queue algorithm that avoids accessing auxiliary nodes\nand thus reduces cache traffic and stalls. This leads to dramatic speedups on\nthe most latency-critical interactions such as hovering, typing, and animation.\nMoreover, thanks to numerous low-level optimizations, Spineless Traversal is\ncompetitive across the whole spectrum of incremental layout workloads.\nSpineless Traversal is faster than the standard approach on 83.0% of 2216\nbenchmarks, with a mean speedup of 1.80x concentrated in the most\nlatency-critical interactions.",

In this work, we propose the use of diphone - an acoustic\nrepresentation that captures the transitions between two phonemes - as the\ncontext-aware modeling target.

This study aims to evaluate the current code\ngeneration capabilities of smaller LLMs using various metrics, exploring the\nimpact of quantization on code quality, and identifying prevalent quality\nissues in the generated code. Method: We conducted a comprehensive evaluation\nof four smaller open-source LLMs across two benchmarks and code similarity\nscores.

Sliced-Wasserstein distances\n(SWDs) provide a workaround by projecting distributions onto one-dimensional\nsubspaces, leveraging the more efficient, closed-form WDs for one-dimensional\ndistributions. However, in high dimensions, most random projections become\nuninformative due to the concentration of measure phenomenon. Although several\nSWD variants have been proposed to focus on \\textit{informative} slices, they\noften introduce additional complexity, numerical instability, and compromise\ndesirable theoretical (metric) properties of SWD. Amidst the growing literature\nthat focuses on directly modifying the slicing distribution, which often face\nchallenges, we revisit the classical Sliced-Wasserstein and propose instead to\nrescale the 1D Wasserstein to make all slices equally informative. Importantly,\nwe show that with an appropriate data assumption and notion of \\textit{slice\ninformativeness}, rescaling for all individual slices simplifies to \\textbf{a\nsingle global scaling factor} on the SWD. This, in turn, translates to the\nstandard learning rate search for gradient-based learning in common machine\nlearning workflows. We perform extensive experiments across various machine\nlearning tasks showing that the classical SWD, when properly configured, can\noften match or surpass the performance of more complex variants.

Eventually, creating additional charges is energetically\nfavored, hence breaking the string. Such a phenomenon can be probed in simpler\nmodels, including quantum spin chains, enabling enhanced understanding of\nstring-breaking dynamics. A challenging task is to understand how string\nbreaking occurs as time elapses, in an out-of-equilibrium setting. This work\nestablishes the phenomenology of dynamical string breaking induced by a gradual\nincrease of string tension over time. It, thus, goes beyond instantaneous\nquench processes and enables tracking the real-time evolution of strings in a\nmore controlled setting. We focus on domain-wall confinement in a family of\nquantum Ising chains. Our results indicate that, for sufficiently short strings\nand slow evolution, string breaking can be described by the transition dynamics\nof a two-state quantum system akin to a Landau-Zener process. For longer\nstrings, a more intricate spatiotemporal pattern emerges: the string breaks by\nforming a superposition of bubbles (domains of flipped spins of varying sizes),\nwhich involve highly excited states. We finally demonstrate that string\nbreaking driven only by quantum fluctuations can be realized in the presence of\nsufficiently long-ranged interactions.

    "abstract": "Tuberculosis (TB) is a major global health challenge, and is compounded by\nco-morbidities such as HIV, diabetes, and anemia, which complicate treatment\noutcomes and contribute to heterogeneous patient responses. Traditional models\nof TB often overlook this heterogeneity by focusing on broad, pre-defined\npatient groups, thereby missing the nuanced effects of individual patient\ncontexts. We propose moving beyond coarse subgroup analyses by using\ncontextualized modeling, a multi-task learning approach that encodes patient\ncontext into personalized models of treatment effects, revealing\npatient-specific treatment benefits. Applied to the TB Portals dataset with\nmulti-modal measurements for over 3,000 TB patients, our model reveals\nstructured interactions between co-morbidities, treatments, and patient\noutcomes, identifying anemia, age of onset, and HIV as influential for\ntreatment efficacy. By enhancing predictive accuracy in heterogeneous\npopulations and providing patient-specific insights, contextualized models\npromise to enable new approaches to personalized treatment.",

While superconductivity develops in ultrathin films\nof FeSe on SrTiO3 substrates, it remains unclear whether it can be developed on\nmore chemically inert, layered materials such as graphene. Here, we report on\nthe characterization of the structural, chemical and electronic properties of\nfew-layer FeSe on bilayer graphene grown on SiC(0001) using low-temperature\nscanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS) and X-ray photoelectron\nspectroscopy (XPS). STM imaging of our FeSe films with thicknesses up to three\nlayers exhibit the tetragonal crystal structure of bulk FeSe, which is\nsupported by XPS spectra consistent with the FeSe bulk counterpart. While our\nSTS measurements at 340 mK reveal a metallic character for few-layer FeSe on\nBLG/SiC(0001), they show an absence of superconductivity, as the low-lying\nelectronic structure exhibits a spatially anisotropic dip-like feature robust\nagainst magnetic fields.

In order to achieve such an\nunderstanding, we extend a recently developed phonon dynamical cluster\napproximation (DCA) and its typical medium variant (TMDCA) to investigate\nspectra and localization of multi-branch phonons in the presence of pure mass\ndisorder. We validate the new formalism against several limiting cases and\nexact diagonalization results.

However, deploying MLLMs on mobile phones presents challenges\ndue to limitations in memory size and computational capability, making it\ndifficult to achieve smooth and real-time processing without extensive\noptimization. In this paper, we present BlueLM-V-3B, an algorithm and system\nco-design approach specifically tailored for the efficient deployment of MLLMs\non mobile platforms. To be specific, we redesign the dynamic resolution scheme\nadopted by mainstream MLLMs and implement system optimization for\nhardware-aware deployment to optimize model inference on mobile phones.\nBlueLM-V-3B boasts the following key highlights: (1) Small Size: BlueLM-V-3B\nfeatures a language model with 2.7B parameters and a vision encoder with 400M\nparameters. (2) Fast Speed: BlueLM-V-3B achieves a generation speed of 24.4\ntoken/s on the MediaTek Dimensity 9300 processor with 4-bit LLM weight\nquantization.

    "abstract": "Bird's eye view (BEV)-based 3D perception plays a crucial role in autonomous\ndriving applications. The rise of large language models has spurred interest in\nBEV-based captioning to understand object behavior in the surrounding\nenvironment. However, existing approaches treat perception and captioning as\nseparate tasks, focusing on the performance of only one task and overlooking\nthe potential benefits of multimodal alignment. To bridge this gap between\nmodalities, we introduce MTA, a novel multimodal task alignment framework that\nboosts both BEV perception and captioning. MTA consists of two key components:\n(1) BEV-Language Alignment (BLA), a contextual learning mechanism that aligns\nthe BEV scene representations with ground-truth language representations, and\n(2) Detection-Captioning Alignment (DCA), a cross-modal prompting mechanism\nthat aligns detection and captioning outputs. MTA seamlessly integrates into\nstate-of-the-art baselines during training, adding no extra computational\ncomplexity at runtime. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes and TOD3Cap\ndatasets show that MTA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in\nboth tasks, achieving a 10.7% improvement in challenging rare perception\nscenarios and a 9.2% improvement in captioning.
