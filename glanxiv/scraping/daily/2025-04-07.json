    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) hold promise as dynamic instructional aids. Yet,\nit remains unclear whether LLMs can replicate the adaptivity of intelligent\ntutoring systems (ITS)--where student knowledge and pedagogical strategies are\nexplicitly modeled. We propose a prompt variation framework to assess\nLLM-generated instructional moves' adaptivity and pedagogical soundness across\n75 real-world tutoring scenarios from an ITS. We systematically remove key\ncontext components (e.g., student errors and knowledge components) from prompts\nto create variations of each scenario. Three representative LLMs (Llama3-8B,\nLlama3-70B, and GPT-4o) generate 1,350 instructional moves. We use text\nembeddings and randomization tests to measure how the omission of each context\nfeature impacts the LLMs' outputs (adaptivity) and a validated tutor-training\nclassifier to evaluate response quality (pedagogical soundness). Surprisingly,\neven the best-performing model only marginally mimics the adaptivity of ITS.\nSpecifically, Llama3-70B demonstrates statistically significant adaptivity to\nstudent errors. Although Llama3-8B's recommendations receive higher pedagogical\nsoundness scores than the other models, it struggles with instruction-following\nbehaviors, including output formatting. By contrast, GPT-4o reliably adheres to\ninstructions but tends to provide overly direct feedback that diverges from\neffective tutoring, prompting learners with open-ended questions to gauge\nknowledge. Given these results, we discuss how current LLM-based tutoring is\nunlikely to produce learning benefits rivaling known-to-be-effective ITS\ntutoring. Through our open-source benchmarking code, we contribute a\nreproducible method for evaluating LLMs' instructional adaptivity and fidelity.",

Divalent\ncations, however, have significantly higher desolvation costs, requiring\nconsiderably larger pores to enable retention of the first hydration shell and\nsubsequently transport. We show that this scenario gives rise to a strong\nenthalpy-entropy competition.

Building on these findings, recent investigations reveal that\nIBS happens during remote interactions, implying that brain activities between\nindividuals can synchronize despite latency and physical separation. However,\nthe conditions under which this synchronization occurs or is disrupted in\nremote settings, especially the effect of latency, are not fully understood.\nThis study investigates how varying transmission latency affects IBS, in order\nto identify thresholds where synchronization is disrupted. Using\nelectroencephalography measurements quantified through Phase Locking Value -- a\nmetric that captures synchronization between brainwave phases -- we first\nconfirm synchronization under face-to-face conditions and then observe changes\nin IBS across remote communication scenarios. Our findings reveal that IBS can\noccur during remote collaboration, but is critically dependent on transmission\ndelays, with delays exceeding 450 ms significantly disrupting synchronization.\nThese findings suggest that IBS may serve as a key indicator of communication\nquality in remote interactions, offering insights for improving remote\ncommunication systems and collaboration.",

Through the use of reconfigurable quantum\ninterfaces and wavelength-selective switches, a nanosecond network\nreconfiguration latency can be demonstrated with low-loss, low-infidelity and\nhigh-dimensional switches. To the best of our knowledge, our architecture is\nthe first practical solution that can accommodate the entanglement distribution\nbetween heterogeneous quantum nodes with a rate and latency that satisfy most\ndistributed quantum circuits and error correction requirements.

It is necessary for a\nvariety of membranes, including planar bilayers, liposomes, curved bilayers,\nnanodiscs, and proteoliposomes. Cholesterol regulates membrane properties by\ninfluencing the density of lipids, phase separation into liquid-ordered (Lo)\nand liquid-disordered (Ld) areas, and stability of protein--membrane\ninteractions. For planar bilayers, cholesterol thickens the membrane, decreases\npermeability, and brings lipids into well-ordered domains, adding rigidity and\nfluidity. It modulates membrane curvature in curved bilayers and vesicles, and\nstabilises low-curvature regions, which are important for structural integrity.\nIn liposomes, cholesterol facilitates drug encapsulation and release by\ncontrolling bilayer flexibility and stability. In nanodiscs, cholesterol\nenhances structural integrity and protein compatibility, which enables the\ninvestigation of protein--lipid interactions under physiological conditions. In\nproteoliposomes, cholesterol regulates the conformational stability of embedded\nproteins that have implications for protein--lipid interaction. Developments in\nmolecular dynamics (MD) techniques, from coarse-grained to all-atom\nsimulations, have shown how cholesterol modulates lipid tail ordering, membrane\ncurvature, and flip-flop behaviour in response to concentration. Such\nsimulations provide insights into the mechanisms underlying membrane-associated\ndiseases, aiding in the design of efficient drug delivery systems.

By constructing\ndynamic models that simulate real-world deliberation, DTs allow researchers and\npolicymakers to rigorously test \"what-if\" scenarios across diverse\ninstitutional configurations in a controlled virtual environment. This approach\nfacilitates evidence-based assessment of novel designs using synthetically\ngenerated data, bypassing the constraints of real-world or lab-based\nexperimentation, and without societal disruption. The paper also discusses the\nlimitations of this new methodological approach and suggests where future\nresearch should focus.",

However, in large-scale settings, MARL faces\nconstraints due to extensive data sharing and communication requirements.\nFederated learning (FL) mitigates these challenges by training shared models\nwithout directly exchanging raw data, yet traditional FL methods such as FedAvg\nstruggle with highly heterogeneous intersections. Different intersections\nexhibit varying traffic patterns, demands, and road structures, so performing\nFedAvg across all agents is inefficient. To address this gap, we propose\nHierarchical Federated Reinforcement Learning (HFRL) for ATSC. HFRL employs\nclustering-based or optimization-based techniques to dynamically group\nintersections and perform FedAvg independently within groups of intersections\nwith similar characteristics, enabling more effective coordination and\nscalability than standard FedAvg. Our experiments on synthetic and real-world\ntraffic networks demonstrate that HFRL not only outperforms both decentralized\nand standard federated RL approaches but also identifies suitable grouping\npatterns based on network structure or traffic demand, resulting in a more\nrobust framework for distributed, heterogeneous systems.",

Lazy-DaSH maintains efficient query\nperformance by utilizing a constraint feedback mechanism within its\nhierarchical structure, ensuring that motion feasibility is effectively\nconveyed to the query process. By maintaining smaller state space\nrepresentations, our method significantly reduces both representation\nconstruction time and query time.

Our core observation\nis that the 2D deformations do not need to be tied to an underlying object, nor\nshare the same deformation space. We use this observation to devise a method\nfor authoring view-dependent deformations, holding several technical\ncontributions: first, a novel way to compositionality-blend between the 2D\ndeformations after lifting them to 3D - this enables the user to \"stack\" the\ndeformations similarly to layers in an editing software, each deformation\noperating on the results of the previous; second, a novel method to apply the\n3D deformation to 3D Gaussian Splats; third, an approach to author the 2D\ndeformations, by deforming a 2D mesh encapsulating a rendered image of the\nobject.

    "abstract": "We present CAT-V (Caption AnyThing in Video), a training-free framework for\nfine-grained object-centric video captioning that enables detailed descriptions\nof user-selected objects through time. CAT-V integrates three key components: a\nSegmenter based on SAMURAI for precise object segmentation across frames, a\nTemporal Analyzer powered by TRACE-Uni for accurate event boundary detection\nand temporal analysis, and a Captioner using InternVL-2.5 for generating\ndetailed object-centric descriptions. Through spatiotemporal visual prompts and\nchain-of-thought reasoning, our framework generates detailed, temporally-aware\ndescriptions of objects' attributes, actions, statuses, interactions, and\nenvironmental contexts without requiring additional training data. CAT-V\nsupports flexible user interactions through various visual prompts (points,\nbounding boxes, and irregular regions) and maintains temporal sensitivity by\ntracking object states and interactions across different time segments. Our\napproach addresses limitations of existing video captioning methods, which\neither produce overly abstract descriptions or lack object-level precision,\nenabling fine-grained, object-specific descriptions while maintaining temporal\ncoherence and spatial accuracy.

These keypoints are identified using a self-supervised\nkeypoint detector and arranged into a time series corresponding to the\nsuccessive frames. Forecasting is performed on these keypoints by integrating\ntwo advanced generative time series models into the motion transfer pipeline,\nnamely the Variational Recurrent Neural Network (VRNN) and the Gated Recurrent\nUnit with Normalizing Flow (GRU-NF). The predicted keypoints are subsequently\nsynthesized into realistic video frames using an optical flow estimator paired\nwith a generator network, thereby facilitating accurate video forecasting and\nenabling efficient, low-frame-rate video transmission. We validate our results\nacross three datasets for video animation and reconstruction using the\nfollowing metrics: Mean Absolute Error, Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture\nEmbedding Distance, Structural Similarity Index, and Average Pair-wise\nDisplacement. Our results confirm that by utilizing the superior reconstruction\nproperty of the Variational Autoencoder, the VRNN integrated FOMM excels in\napplications involving multi-step ahead forecasts such as video conferencing.\nOn the other hand, by leveraging the Normalizing Flow architecture for exact\nlikelihood estimation, and enabling efficient latent space sampling, the GRU-NF\nbased FOMM exhibits superior capabilities for producing diverse future samples\nwhile maintaining high visual quality for tasks like real-time video-based\nanomaly detection.",

However, existing Chinese preference datasets are limited\nby small scale, narrow domain coverage, and lack of rigorous data validation.\nAdditionally, the reliance on human annotators for instruction and response\nlabeling significantly constrains the scalability of human preference datasets.\nTo address these challenges, we design an LLM-based Chinese preference dataset\nannotation pipeline with no human intervention. Specifically, we crawled and\ncarefully filtered 92k high-quality Chinese queries and employed 15 mainstream\nLLMs to generate and score chosen-rejected response pairs.

Building upon COIG-P, to reduce the overhead of using LLMs for\nscoring, we trained a 8B-sized Chinese Reward Model (CRM) and meticulously\nconstructed a Chinese Reward Benchmark (CRBench). Evaluation results based on\nAlignBench \\citep{liu2024alignbenchbenchmarkingchinesealignment} show that that\nCOIG-P significantly outperforms other Chinese preference datasets, and it\nbrings significant performance improvements ranging from 2% to 12% for the\nQwen2/2.5 and Infinity-Instruct-3M-0625 model series, respectively.

To address\nthis, we propose a systematic mathematical framework for RoPE grounded in Lie\ngroup and Lie algebra theory. We derive the necessary and sufficient conditions\nfor any valid $N$-dimensional RoPE based on two core properties of RoPE -\nrelativity and reversibility. We demonstrate that RoPE can be characterized as\na basis of a maximal abelian subalgebra (MASA) in the special orthogonal Lie\nalgebra, and that the commonly used axis-aligned block-diagonal RoPE, where\neach input axis is encoded by an independent 2x2 rotation block, corresponds to\nthe maximal toral subalgebra. Furthermore, we reduce spatial inter-dimensional\ninteractions to a change of basis, resolved by learning an orthogonal\ntransformation. Our experiment results suggest that inter-dimensional\ninteractions should be balanced with local structure preservation. Overall, our\nframework unifies and explains existing RoPE designs while enabling principled\nextensions to higher-dimensional modalities and tasks.",

    "abstract": "The recharge oscillator (RO) model has been successfully used to understand\ndifferent aspects of the El Ni\\~no-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Fitting the RO\nto observations and climate model simulations consistently suggests that ENSO\nis a damped oscillator whose variability is sustained and made irregular by\nexternal weather noise. We investigate the methods that have been used to\nestimate the growth rate of ENSO by applying them to simulations of both damped\nand self-sustained RO regimes. We find that fitting a linear RO leads to\nparameters that imply a damped oscillator even when the fitted data were\nproduced by a model that is self-sustained. Fitting a nonlinear RO also leads\nto a significant bias toward a damped regime. As such, it seems challenging to\nconclude whether ENSO is a damped or a self-sustained oscillation by fitting\nsuch models to observations, and the possibility that ENSO is self-sustained\ncannot be ruled out.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: The primary goal of this study is to explore the application of\nevaluation metrics to different clustering algorithms using the data provided\nfrom the Canadian Longitudinal Study (CLSA), focusing on cognitive features.\nThe objective of our work is to discover potential clinically relevant clusters\nthat contribute to the development of dementia over time-based on cognitive\nchanges. Method: The CLSA dataset includes 18,891 participants with data\navailable at both baseline and follow-up assessments, to which clustering\nalgorithms were applied. The clustering methodologies employed in this analysis\nare K-means (KM) clustering, Hierarchical Clustering (HC) and Partitioning\nAround Medoids (PAM). We use multiple evaluation metrics to assess our\nanalysis. For internal evaluation metrics, we use: Average silhouette Width,\nWithin and Between the sum of square Ratio (WB.Ratio), Entropy,\nCalinski-Harabasz Index (CH Index), and Separation Index. For clustering\ncomparison metrics, we used: Homogeneity, Completeness, Adjusted Rand Index\n(ARI), Rand Index (RI), and Variation Information. Results: Using evaluation\nmetrics to compare the results of the three clustering techniques, K-means and\nPartitioning Around Medoids (PAM) produced similar results. In contrast, there\nare significant differences between K-means clustering and Hierarchical\nClustering. Our study highlights the importance of the two internal evaluation\nmetrics: entropy and separation index. In between clustering comparison\nmetrics, the Adjusted Rand Index is a key tool. Conclusion: The study results\nhave the potential to contribute to understanding dementia. Researchers can\nalso benefit by applying the suggested evaluation metrics to other areas of\nhealthcare research. Overall, our study improves the understanding of using\nclustering techniques and evaluation metrics to reveal complex patterns in\nmedical data.",

Existing security measures often fail to adequately protect these\ncontracts due to the composability of DeFi protocols and the increasing\nsophistication of attacks. Through a large-scale empirical study of historical\ntransactions from the 30 hacked DeFi protocols, we discovered that while benign\ntransactions typically exhibit a limited number of unique control flows, in\nstark contrast, attack transactions consistently introduce novel, previously\nunobserved control flows. Building on these insights, we developed CrossGuard,\na novel framework that enforces control flow integrity in real-time to secure\nsmart contracts. Crucially, CrossGuard does not require prior knowledge of\nspecific hacks; instead, it dynamically enforces control flow whitelisting\npolicies and applies simplification heuristics at runtime. This approach\nmonitors and prevents potential attacks by reverting all transactions that do\nnot adhere to the established control flow whitelisting rules. Our evaluation\ndemonstrates that CrossGuard effectively blocks 28 of the 30 analyzed attacks\nwhen configured only once prior to contract deployment, maintaining a low false\npositive rate of 0.28% and minimal additional gas costs. These results\nunderscore the efficacy of applying control flow integrity to smart contracts,\nsignificantly enhancing security beyond traditional methods and addressing the\nevolving threat landscape in the DeFi ecosystem.",

Then, we prove a Hohenberg-Kohn\ntheorem that applies to the class of distributional potentials studied here.\nLastly, we establish the differentiability of the exchange-correlation\nfunctional and therefore the existence of a unique exchange-correlation\npotential.

To ensure robust evaluation, Prism integrates structural\nmeasurements of tree exploration patterns with performance metrics across\ndifficulty levels, providing detailed diagnostics of error patterns, test\ncoverage, and solution approaches. Through extensive experiments on five\nstate-of-the-art LLMs, we analyze how model architecture and scale influence\ncode generation performance across varying task difficulties.

Much of the existing work\nhas focused on design and modeling or process optimization for such\nexperiments.

A\nnew criterion is introduced to search for the follow-up inputs. The key\nfeatures of the proposed criterion are (a) the criterion yields adaptive search\nregions; and (b) it is region-based cooperative in that for each stage of the\nsequential procedure, the candidate points in the design space is divided into\ntwo disjoint groups using confidence bounds, and within each group, an\nacquisition function is used to select a candidate point. Among the two\nselected points, a point that is closer to the contour level with the higher\nuncertainty or that has higher uncertainty when the distance between its\nprediction and the contour level is within a threshold is chosen. The proposed\napproach provides empirically more accurate contour estimation than existing\napproaches as illustrated in numerical examples and a real application.\nTheoretical justification of the proposed adaptive search region is given.",

In this study, we investigate the effects of rotation on\nfour snapshots of the evolution of proto-neutron stars with hyperons and\n$\\Delta$-resonances in their cores, from birth as neutrino-rich objects to\nmaturity as cold, catalyzed neutron stars. We focus on the effects of uniform\nrotation on the macroscopic structure of the star at three rotational\nfrequencies -- 346.53 Hz, 716 Hz, and the Kepler frequency. Our investigation\nindicates that the impact of rotation at frequencies of $346.53$~Hz and\n$716$~Hz causes minor changes in the maximum gravitational mass but leads to\nsignificant changes in the stellar radius, particularly for stars with masses\nsmaller than $2$~\\msun. However, we observe drastic changes in the star's mass\nand radius when considering the Kepler frequency. In addition, we investigate\nother relevant characteristics of the rotating proto-neutron stars as they\nevolve such as the moment of inertia, compactness, central temperature, and\nKerr parameter. Our results suggest that the inclusion of new degrees of\nfreedom in the stellar core lead the star to be more sensitive to rotational\ndynamics, owing to an increase in compactness, a decrease in the central\ntemperature, and a decrease in the moment of inertia.",

    "abstract": "In next-step fusion tokamaks such as SPARC and ITER, achieving high levels of\nscrape-off-layer power dissipation will be essential to protect the divertor\nwhile maintaining good core plasma performance. The Lengyel model for power\ndissipation is easy to interpret and fast enough to incorporate into plasma\ncontrol and scoping tools, but it systematically overestimates the impurity\nconcentration required to reach detachment by a factor of ~5 relative to\nexperiments and higher-fidelity simulations. In this work, we extend the\nLengyel model to match the semi-empirical Kallenbach scaling, which\nsuccessfully describes detachment access on several operating tokamaks. We\nfound that we can reproduce the experimental scaling by accounting for\ncross-field transport in the divertor, power and momentum loss due to neutral\nionization close to the divertor target and turbulent broadening of the\nupstream heat flux channel. These corrections cause the impurity concentration\nrequired for detachment to decrease faster than $n_{e,u}^2$, reproducing the\n$c_z\\propto 1/n_{e,u}^{2.7-3.2}$ scalings found in experiment. The model also\nquantitatively reproduces the impurity concentration needed to reach detachment\nin experiment, demonstrating that the extended Lengyel model can be used as a\nsimple, accurate model for detachment access.",

This paper offers an understanding of Zero\nTrust security through a comprehensive review of existing literature,\nprinciples, and challenges.

Inclusion/exclusion criteria\nfor the systematic literature review were planned alongside a bibliometric\nanalysis. Moreover, keyword co-occurrence analysis was done, which indicates\ntrends and general themes for the Zero Trust model, Zero Trust implementation,\nand Zero Trust application. Furthermore, the paper explores various ZT models\nproposed in the literature for connected vehicles, shedding light on the\nchallenges associated with their integration into CV systems. Future directions\nof this research will focus on incorporating Zero Trust principles within\nVehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) communication\nparadigms.

Nearly all recent work adopts a\ndeclarative paradigm for this problem: using LLM to generate specification of\nconstraints between objects, then solving those constraints to produce the\nfinal layout. In contrast, we explore an alternative imperative paradigm, in\nwhich an LLM iteratively places objects, with each object's position and\norientation computed as a function of previously-placed objects. The imperative\napproach allows for a simpler scene specification language while also handling\na wider variety and larger complexity of scenes. We further improve the\nrobustness of our imperative scheme by developing an error correction mechanism\nthat iteratively improves the scene's validity while staying as close as\npossible the original layout generated by the LLM. In forced-choice perceptual\nstudies, participants preferred layouts generated by our imperative approach\n82% and 94% of the time, respectively, when compared against two declarative\nlayout generation methods.

In this work, we\nfocus on a sample of 92 transiting, long-period giant planets (TLGs) as part of\nan eccentricity distribution study for this planet population in order to\nunderstand their eccentricity origin. Using archival high-contrast imaging\nobservations, public stellar catalogs, precise Gaia astrometry, and the NASA\nExoplanet Archive database, we explored the eccentricity distribution\ncorrelation with different planet and host-star properties of our sample. We\nalso homogeneously characterized the basic stellar properties for all 86\nhost-stars in our sample, including stellar age and metallicity. We found a\ncorrelation between eccentricity and stellar metallicity, where\nlower-metallicity stars ([Fe/H] <= 0.1) did not host any planets beyond e >\n0.4, while higher-metallicity stars hosted planets across the entire\neccentricity range. Interestingly, we found no correlation between the\neccentricity distribution and the presence of stellar companions, indicating\nthat planet-planet scattering is likely a more dominant mechanism than the\nKozai-Lidov effect for TLGs. This is further supported by an anti-correlation\ntrend found between planet multiplicity and eccentricity, as well as a lack of\nstrong tidal dissipation effects for planets in our sample, which favor\nplanet-planet scattering scenarios for the eccentricity origin.",

    "abstract": "Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) observations of M87* provide a means of\nconstraining parameters of both the black hole and its surrounding plasma.\nHowever, intrinsic variability of the emitting material introduces a major\nsource of systematic uncertainty, complicating parameter inference. The precise\norigin and structure of this variability remain uncertain, and previous studies\nhave largely relied on general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD)\nsimulations to estimate its effects. Here, we fit a semi-analytic, dual-cone\nmodel of the emitting plasma to multiple years of EHT observations to\nempirically assess the impact of intrinsic variability and improved array\ncoverage on key measurements including the black hole mass-to-distance ratio,\nspin, and viewing inclination. Despite substantial differences in the images of\nthe two epochs, we find that the inferred mass-to-distance ratio remains stable\nand mutually consistent. The black hole spin is unconstrained for both\nobservations, despite the improved baseline coverage in 2018. The inferred\nposition angle and inclination of the black hole spin axis are discrepant\nbetween the two years, suggesting that variability and model misspecification\ncontribute significantly to the total error budget for these quantities. Our\nfindings highlight both the promise and challenges of multi-epoch EHT\nobservations: while they can refine parameter constraints, they also reveal the\nlimitations of simple parametric models in capturing the full complexity of the\nsource. Our analysis -- the first to fit semi-analytic emission models to 2018\nEHT observations -- underscores the importance of systematic uncertainty\nquantification from intrinsic variability in future high-resolution imaging\nstudies of black hole environments and the role of repeated observations in\nquantifying these uncertainties.",

Recently, Jaupart & Chabrier (2021)\nextended this invariant to non-isotropic flows in a time-evolving background\nand showed that it has the dimension of a mass.

We study\nseveral input configurations, namely different Mach numbers, injection lengths\nof turbulence and equations of state.

    "abstract": "Analytical expressions for the osmotic pressure of electrolytes confined\nwithin electrolyte-filled, hollow, charged nanoparticles are studied using\ncontact theorems for cavity nanoshells immersed in a low-concentration\nelectrolyte. Three shell geometries are considered: planar, cylindrical, and\nspherical. The nanoparticles are modeled as charged cavities of internal radius\nR and wall thickness d, and are assumed to be at infinite dilution in the\nsurrounding bulk electrolyte. Numerical calculations of the osmotic pressure\nare presented as a function of several model parameters. For cylindrical and\nspherical shells, the osmotic pressure exhibits absolute maxima as a function\nof shell size. This behavior arises from the competition between the violation\nof the local electroneutrality condition (VLEC) within the shell cavity and the\nnonlinear profile of the effective electric field. In contrast, the osmotic\npressure of the planar (slit-shell) geometry is a monotonic, nonlinear,\ndecreasing function of cavity width. The results are analyzed in terms of the\nsteric and electrostatic (Maxwell stress tensor) contributions appearing in the\ncorresponding contact theorems. Because the analysis is restricted to low\nsurface charge densities and low electrolyte concentrations, the electric\ndouble layers (EDLs) inside and outside the shells are obtained from analytical\nsolutions of the linearized Poisson-Boltzmann equation. We report two novel\nphenomena: confinement charge reversal (CCR) and confinement overcharging (CO).\nThese arise naturally from the topology of the system. By construction, the\nconfined and bulk electrolytes are maintained at the same chemical potential.\nThese findings have implications for the design of synthetic nanocapsules and\nion-selective membranes.",

    "abstract": "Explainability is necessary for many tasks in biomedical research. Recent\nexplainability methods have focused on attention, gradient, and Shapley value.\nThese do not handle data with strong associated prior knowledge and fail to\nconstrain explainability results based on known relationships between\npredictive features.\n  We propose GraphPINE, a graph neural network (GNN) architecture leveraging\ndomain-specific prior knowledge to initialize node importance optimized during\ntraining for drug response prediction. Typically, a manual post-prediction step\nexamines literature (i.e., prior knowledge) to understand returned predictive\nfeatures. While node importance can be obtained for gradient and attention\nafter prediction, node importance from these methods lacks complementary prior\nknowledge; GraphPINE seeks to overcome this limitation. GraphPINE differs from\nother GNN gating methods by utilizing an LSTM-like sequential format. We\nintroduce an importance propagation layer that unifies 1) updates for feature\nmatrix and node importance and 2) uses GNN-based graph propagation of feature\nvalues. This initialization and updating mechanism allows for informed feature\nlearning and improved graph representation.\n  We apply GraphPINE to cancer drug response prediction using drug screening\nand gene data collected for over 5,000 gene nodes included in a gene-gene graph\nwith a drug-target interaction (DTI) graph for initial importance. The\ngene-gene graph and DTIs were obtained from curated sources and weighted by\narticle count discussing relationships between drugs and genes.

However, previous\nobservations of LMXBs accreting near or above the Eddington limit show that\njets and winds can potentially coexist. To investigate this phenomenon, we\ncarried out a comprehensive multi-wavelength campaign (using VLA, Chandra/HETG,\nand NICER) on the near-Eddington neutron-star Z source LMXB GX 13+1. NICER and\nChandra/HETG observations tracked GX 13+1 across the entire Z-track during high\nEddington rates, detecting substantial resonance absorption features\noriginating from the accretion disk wind in all X-ray spectra, which implies a\npersistent wind presence. Simultaneous VLA observations captured a variable\nradio jet, with radio emission notably strong during all flaring branch\nobservations-contrary to typical behavior in Z-sources-and weaker when the\nsource was on the normal branch. Interestingly, no clear correlation was found\nbetween the radio emission and the wind features.

The spicules observed at mm-$\\lambda$ are seen in absorption\nagainst coronal EUV emission, allowing us to estimate the column depth of\nneutral hydrogen.

The original paper\nstudied the relationship between the number of agents needed to solve the\nproblem and the edge density of the graph. The paper presented strong evidence\nthat edge density of a graph, or the number of redundant edges within the\ngraph, may be the correct graph property to accurately differentiate whether\n$k= o(n)$ agents (low edge density) or $k = \\Omega(n)$ agents (high edge\ndensity) are needed to solve the problem.\n  In this paper, we show that surprisingly, edge density may not in fact be the\ncorrect differentiating property. The original paper presents graphs with edge\ndensity $1.1\\overline{6}$ that require $\\Omega(n)$ agents, however, we\nconstruct graphs with edge density $> 1.1\\overline{6}$ and develop an algorithm\nto solve the problem on those graphs using only $o(n)$ agents. We subsequently\nshow that the relationship between edge density and number of agents is fairly\nweak by first constructing graphs with edge density tending to $1$ from above\nthat require $\\Omega(n/f(n))$ agents to solve, for any function $f(n) \\to\n\\infty$ as $n \\to \\infty$. We then construct an infinite family of graphs with\nedge density $< \\rho$ requiring exactly $k$ ignorant agents to solve\n\\textsc{Broadcast}, for any $k>0$ and $\\rho>1$.",

We developed an equivariant machine-learning\ninteratomic potential (MLIP) with near-DFT accuracy to perform molecular\ndynamics (MD) simulations of Pt crystal growth on graphene and subsequent\nH$_2$-sensing. MD simulations validated by TEM show that Pt deposition begins\nwith dispersed nuclei coalescing into polycrystalline nanoclusters with\npredominantly FCC interiors, while both MD and Raman spectroscopy reveal a\npredominantly non-covalent Pt-graphene interaction that induces moderate local\nstrain and charge transfer yet preserves graphene's structural integrity.\nReactive MD simulations confirm H$_2$ dissociative chemisorption exclusively on\nPt, with negligible spillover onto pristine graphene. However, H adsorption on\nPt attenuates the Pt-graphene interfacial binding, providing an indirect\nelectronic pathway for H$_2$ sensing. Transient and steady-state kinetic\nanalyses demonstrate that an intermediate Pt loading minimizes the limit of\ndetection; lower loadings facilitate faster response and recovery kinetics and\nenhance signal transduction, whereas higher loadings increase the doping level\nof graphene. DFT charge analysis indicates that under-coordinated Pt clusters\ninduce $n$-type doping in graphene, whereas continuous Pt films induce $p$-type\ndoping, with both effects attenuated upon H adsorption. The developed\nmachine-learned MD framework enables quantum-mechanically accurate modeling of\nmetal crystal growth on graphene, elucidates the underlying H$_2$-sensing\nmechanism, and correlates several key sensing figures of merit with metal\nloading and morphology.",

Experimental validation, involving\nimaging hot air plumes generated from butane combustion and transparent\nadhesive tape tests, demonstrate significant improved performance, including\nenhanced visibility near regions of high temperature gradients, improved edge\ndetection, and precise visualization of large refractive gradients.

The geometric arrangement of heme along OmcS wires is\nconserved in many multiheme c-type cytochromes and other recently discovered\nmicrobial cytochrome wires. However, the mechanism by which this arrangement of\nheme molecules support electron transport through proteins and supramolecular\nheme wires is unclear.

    "abstract": "Predicting player behavior in strategic games, especially complex ones like\nchess, presents a significant challenge. The difficulty arises from several\nfactors. First, the sheer number of potential outcomes stemming from even a\nsingle position, starting from the initial setup, makes forecasting a player's\nnext move incredibly complex. Second, and perhaps even more challenging, is the\ninherent unpredictability of human behavior. Unlike the optimized play of\nengines, humans introduce a layer of variability due to differing playing\nstyles and decision-making processes. Each player approaches the game with a\nunique blend of strategic thinking, tactical awareness, and psychological\ntendencies, leading to diverse and often unexpected actions. This stylistic\nvariation, combined with the capacity for creativity and even irrational moves,\nmakes predicting human play difficult. Chess, a longstanding benchmark of\nartificial intelligence research, has seen significant advancements in tools\nand automation. Engines like Deep Blue, AlphaZero, and Stockfish can defeat\neven the most skilled human players. However, despite their exceptional ability\nto outplay top-level grandmasters, predicting the moves of non-grandmaster\nplayers, who comprise most of the global chess community -- remains complicated\nfor these engines. This paper proposes a novel approach combining expert\nknowledge with machine learning techniques to predict human players' next\nmoves. By applying feature engineering grounded in domain expertise, we seek to\nuncover the patterns in the moves of intermediate-level chess players,\nparticularly during the opening phase of the game. Our methodology offers a\npromising framework for anticipating human behavior, advancing both the fields\nof AI and human-computer interaction.",

    "abstract": "Efficiency is essential to support ever-growing datasets, especially for Deep\nLearning (DL) systems. DL frameworks have traditionally embraced deferred\nexecution-style DL code -- supporting symbolic, graph-based Deep Neural Network\n(DNN) computation. While scalable, such development is error-prone,\nnon-intuitive, and difficult to debug. Consequently, more natural, imperative\nDL frameworks encouraging eager execution have emerged but at the expense of\nrun-time performance. Though hybrid approaches aim for the \"best of both\nworlds,\" using them effectively requires subtle considerations. Our key insight\nis that, while DL programs typically execute sequentially, hybridizing\nimperative DL code resembles parallelizing sequential code in traditional\nsystems. Inspired by this, we present an automated refactoring approach that\nassists developers in determining which otherwise eagerly-executed imperative\nDL functions could be effectively and efficiently executed as graphs. The\napproach features novel static imperative tensor and side-effect analyses for\nPython. Due to its inherent dynamism, analyzing Python may be unsound; however,\nthe conservative approach leverages a speculative (keyword-based) analysis for\nresolving difficult cases that informs developers of any assumptions made. The\napproach is: (i) implemented as a plug-in to the PyDev Eclipse IDE that\nintegrates the WALA Ariadne analysis framework and (ii) evaluated on nineteen\nDL projects consisting of 132 KLOC. The results show that 326 of 766 candidate\nfunctions (42.56%) were refactorable, and an average relative speedup of 2.16\non performance tests was observed with negligible differences in model\naccuracy. The results indicate that the approach is useful in optimizing\nimperative DL code to its full potential.",

In the present study we develop a rigorous computational framework\nfor this multiphase, multi-physics system to quantitatively evaluate mixing,\noxygen transfer, and shear stress within a rectangular rocking bioreactor under\nvarious operating conditions.

By solving the advection-diffusion equation for\na multi-fluid system, we examine mixing time and the oxygen mass transfer\ncoefficient for different operating conditions, both of which show a strong\nrelationship with steady streaming underlying the instantaneous laminar flow.\nWe further highlight two critical hydrodynamic phenomena that significantly\ninfluence bioreactor performance.

Moreover, we identify specific operating\nconditions that trigger resonance within the bioreactor, enhancing mixing and\noxygen transfer.

Based on the trend in the quasi-Fermi level\nsplitting in MAPI, we emphasize implications of controlling point defect\nchemistry for the function and performance optimization of solar energy\nconversion devices based on halide perovskites. Lastly, we show that in the\npresence of multiple redox reactions mediating the iodine quasi-equilibrium,\neither positive or negative changes in the ionic defect pair chemical potential\ncan be obtained. These findings indicate the intriguing possibility to increase\nor to reduce ionic defect concentrations in mixed conductors through exposure\nto light.",

Widely adopted\ntransformer-based models, while excelling at short-context tasks, are limited\nby the attention module's quadratic computational complexity and inability to\nextrapolate to sequences longer than those seen in training. In this work, we\nexplore State Space Models (SSMs) as a promising alternative by benchmarking\ntwo SSM-inspired architectures, Caduceus and Hawk, on long-range genomics\nmodeling tasks under conditions parallel to a 50M parameter transformer\nbaseline. We discover that SSMs match transformer performance and exhibit\nimpressive zero-shot extrapolation across multiple tasks, handling contexts 10\nto 100 times longer than those seen during training, indicating more\ngeneralizable representations better suited for modeling the long and complex\nhuman genome. Moreover, we demonstrate that these models can efficiently\nprocess sequences of 1M tokens on a single GPU, allowing for modeling entire\ngenomic regions at once, even in labs with limited compute. Our findings\nestablish SSMs as efficient and scalable for long-context genomic analysis.",

    "abstract": "Stellar rotation and magnetic activity have a complex evolution that reveals\nmultiple regimes. One of the related transitions that is seen in the rotation\ndistribution for main-sequence (MS) solar-like stars has been attributed to\ncore-envelope coupling and the consequent angular-momentum transfer between a\nfast core and a slow envelope. This feature is known as spin-down stalling and\nis related to the intermediate-rotation gap seen in field stars. Beyond this\nrotation signature, we search for evidence of it in stellar magnetic activity.\nWe investigated the magnetic activity of the 1 Gyr old NGC 6811, a Kepler-field\ncluster, and Kepler MS stars of different ages. The magnetic activity was\nmeasured through the photometric magnetic activity proxy, Sph. To characterize\nthe evolution of the magnetic activity for the Kepler sample, we split it\naccording to the relative rotation and computed the respective activity\nsequences. We found the signature of core-envelope coupling in the magnetic\nactivity of NGC 6811 and in the Kepler MS sample. In NGC 6811, we found\nenhanced magnetic activity for a range of effective temperatures that remained\nfor significant timescales. In the Kepler sample, the magnetic activity\nsequences pile up in two distinct regions: at high activity levels that\ncoincide with stars near the stalling mentioned above, where a behavior\ninversion is observed (slowly rotating stars have higher activity levels than\nfast-rotating stars, which is opposite to the overall behavior); and at low\nactivity levels corresponding to slow rotators close to the detection limit,\npotentially facing a weakening of the magnetic braking. These results support\nthe recent proposition that the strong shear experienced by stars during the\ncore-envelope coupling phase can cause enhanced activity. This study helps us\nto shed light on the interplay between rotation, magnetic activity, and their\nevolution.",

    "abstract": "The dominant approach to generating from language models subject to some\nconstraint is locally constrained decoding (LCD), incrementally sampling tokens\nat each time step such that the constraint is never violated. Typically, this\nis achieved through token masking: looping over the vocabulary and excluding\nnon-conforming tokens. There are two important problems with this approach. (i)\nEvaluating the constraint on every token can be prohibitively expensive -- LM\nvocabularies often exceed $100,000$ tokens. (ii) LCD can distort the global\ndistribution over strings, sampling tokens based only on local information,\neven if they lead down dead-end paths. This work introduces a new algorithm\nthat addresses both these problems. First, to avoid evaluating a constraint on\nthe full vocabulary at each step of generation, we propose an adaptive\nrejection sampling algorithm that typically requires orders of magnitude fewer\nconstraint evaluations. Second, we show how this algorithm can be extended to\nproduce low-variance, unbiased estimates of importance weights at a very small\nadditional cost -- estimates that can be soundly used within previously\nproposed sequential Monte Carlo algorithms to correct for the myopic behavior\nof local constraint enforcement. Through extensive empirical evaluation in\ntext-to-SQL, molecular synthesis, goal inference, pattern matching, and JSON\ndomains, we show that our approach is superior to state-of-the-art baselines,\nsupporting a broader class of constraints and improving both runtime and\nperformance. Additional theoretical and empirical analyses show that our\nmethod's runtime efficiency is driven by its dynamic use of computation,\nscaling with the divergence between the unconstrained and constrained LM, and\nas a consequence, runtime improvements are greater for better models.",

A family of sets is called $s$-EKR\n  if all its $s$-intersecting subfamilies have size at most that of some\n$s$-star. For example, the classic 1961 Erd\\H{o}s-Ko-Rado theorem states\nessentially that the family of $r$-sized subsets of $\\{1,2,\\ldots,n\\}$ is\n$s$-EKR when $n$ is a large enough function of $r$ and $s$, and the 1967\nHilton-Milner theorem provides the near-star structure of the largest non-star\nintersecting family of such sets. Two important conjectures along these lines\nfollowed: by Chv\\'atal in 1974, that every family of sets that all subsets of\nits members is 1-EKR, and by Holroyd and Talbot in 2005, that, for every graph,\nthe family of all its $r$-sized independent sets is 1-EKR when every maximal\nindependent set has size at least $2r$.\n  In this paper we present similar 1-EKR results for families of length-$r$\npaths in graphs, specifically for sun graphs, which are cycles with pendant\nedges attached in a uniform way, and theta graphs, which are collections of\npairwise internally disjoint paths sharing the same two endpoints.

The\nability of oxygen to diffuse towards the metal surface due to increased\nporosity is seen to have a major effect on the corrosion rate, whereas changes\nin the chlorine concentration (and thus changes in the conductivity of the pore\nsolution) play a secondary role.

Although it is\nknown that sample-efficient agnostic policy learning is not possible in the\nstandard online RL setting without further assumptions, we investigate the\nextent to which this can be overcome with stronger forms of access to the\nenvironment. Specifically, we show that: 1. Agnostic policy learning remains\nstatistically intractable when given access to a local simulator, from which\none can reset to any previously seen state. This result holds even when the\npolicy class is realizable, and stands in contrast to a positive result of\n[MFR24] showing that value-based learning under realizability is tractable with\nlocal simulator access. 2. Agnostic policy learning remains statistically\nintractable when given online access to a reset distribution with good coverage\nproperties over the state space (the so-called $\\mu$-reset setting). We also\nstudy stronger forms of function approximation for policy learning, showing\nthat PSDP [BKSN03] and CPI [KL02] provably fail in the absence of policy\ncompleteness. 3. On a positive note, agnostic policy learning is statistically\ntractable for Block MDPs with access to both of the above reset models.

As\nsuch, given the ready availability of WSIs, there is a compelling need to\nexplore the potential relationship between WSIs and DNA methylation patterns.\nTo address this, we propose an end-to-end graph neural network based weakly\nsupervised learning framework to predict the methylation state of gene groups\nexhibiting coherent patterns across samples. Using data from three cohorts from\nThe Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) - TCGA-LGG (Brain Lower Grade Glioma), TCGA-GBM\n(Glioblastoma Multiforme) ($n$=729) and TCGA-KIRC (Kidney Renal Clear Cell\nCarcinoma) ($n$=511) - we demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves\nsignificantly higher AUROC scores than the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, by\nmore than $20\\%$. We conduct gene set enrichment analyses on the gene groups\nand show that majority of the gene groups are significantly enriched in\nimportant hallmarks and pathways. We also generate spatially enriched heatmaps\nto further investigate links between histological patterns and DNA methylation\nstates. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that explores\nassociation of spatially resolved histological patterns with gene group\nmethylation states across multiple cancer types using weakly supervised deep\nlearning.",

We\nintroduce three main contributions: The first is that we explicitly handle the\ninterpolation time in our model, which we also re-estimate during the training\nprocess, to cope with the particularly large variations observed in the\nanimation domain, compared to natural videos; The second is that we adapt and\ngeneralize a diffusion scheme called ResShift recently proposed in the\nsuper-resolution community to VFI, which allows us to perform a very low number\nof diffusion steps (in the order of 10) to produce our estimates; The third is\nthat we leverage the stochastic nature of the diffusion process to provide a\npixel-wise estimate of the uncertainty on the interpolated frame, which could\nbe useful to anticipate where the model may be wrong. We provide extensive\ncomparisons with respect to state-of-the-art models and show that our model\noutperforms these models on animation videos.

Removal of the contribution of the nearby companion, which\nled to a dilution of the burst strength, revealed that it was ~0.5 mag brighter\nthan in the joint light curve.

    "abstract": "Protoplanetary disks observed edge-on commonly show asymmetries that can be\ncaused by shadows cast from a warp. With the growing amount of these\nobservations, methods to constrain warp parameters are urgently needed. In this\nwork, we investigate observational signatures of warps in edge-on disks with\nthe aim to find limits on the observability of warps. We perform radiative\ntransfer simulations in scattered light (near-/mid-infrared) of edge-on disks\ncontaining warps of different amplitudes and varying sizes of the misaligned\ninner region. We analyze the effect of these parameters at 0.8 micron, but also\ncompare models for specific parameters at wavelengths up to 21 micron. In all\nmodels, we quantify the apparent asymmetry. We find that under optimal\nconditions, an asymmetry due to slight warps can be visible. The visibility\ndepends on the viewing angle, as warped disks are not axisymmetric. For optimal\nazimuthal orientation, misalignments between inner and outer disk regimes as\nlow as 2{\\deg} can lead to significant asymmetries. On the other hand, we find\nthat larger misalignments of about 10{\\deg} are needed in order to observe a\nchange in the brightest nebula as a function of wavelength, which is observed\nin a few protoplanetary disks. In order to link our results to observations, we\ninvestigate potential misalignments between the inner and outer disk of edge-on\nsystems showing asymmetries. We compare the jet geometry, which traces the\ninner region of the disk, to the outer disk orientation and find that a\nmisalignment of a few degrees could be present, such that warped disks could\nexplain the apparent lateral asymmetries. There are many factors that can\ninfluence the appearance of the shadows and asymmetries in warped disks.\nAlthough it is still challenging to infer exact warp parameters from\nobservations, this work presents a promising step toward better constraints.",

In the literature, state-based and\nop-based CRDTs are considered equivalent due to the existence of algorithms\nthat let them emulate each other, and verification techniques and results that\napply to one kind of CRDT are said to apply to the other thanks to this\nequivalence. However, what it means for state-based and op-based CRDTs to\nemulate each other has never been made fully precise. Emulation is nontrivial\nsince state-based and op-based CRDTs place different requirements on the\nunderlying network with regard to both the causal ordering of message delivery,\nand the granularity of the messages themselves.\n  We specify and formalize CRDT emulation in terms of simulation by modeling\nCRDTs and their interactions with the network as transition systems. We show\nthat emulation can be understood as weak simulations between the transition\nsystems of the original and emulating CRDT systems, thus closing a gap in the\nCRDT literature.

Since aerodynamic simulations can\nbe computationally expensive, PROMs offer the potential for more rapid\nestimations of high-fidelity solutions. However, the efficiency can still be\ntied to the dimension of the full-order model (FOM), particularly when\nprojected quantities must be frequently recomputed due to non-linearities or\nparameter dependence.

This study explores whether quiet Sun Ellerman bombs (QSEBs), which\nare ubiquitous small-scale magnetic reconnection events in the lower\natmosphere, are linked to the formation of type II spicules. We analysed a\nhigh-quality 40-minute time sequence acquired with the Swedish 1-m Solar\nTelescope. H-beta data were used to observe QSEBs and spicules, while\nspectropolarimetric measurements in the photospheric Fe i 6173 A line provided\nline-of-sight magnetic field information. We employed k-means clustering to\nautomatically detect QSEBs and explored their potential association with\nspicules. We identified 80 clear cases where spicules occurred soon after the\nQSEB and not later than 30 s after the ending of the QSEBs. All events involved\ntype II spicules, rapidly fading from the images. The footpoints of the\nspicules seemed to be rooted in QSEBs, where the onset of QSEBs often preceded\nthe formation of the associated spicules. Additionally, we found around 500\nother events that hinted at a connection but with some ambiguities. The\ncombined clear and ambiguous cases constitute 34% of the total detected QSEBs\nand a smaller percentage of the spicules in our dataset. Our findings suggest\nthat a fraction of type II spicules originate from QSEBs, supporting magnetic\nreconnection as a potential driving mechanism. In this context, QSEBs and\nspicules represent the conversion of magnetic energy into thermal and kinetic\nenergy, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Planet-forming discs in sufficiently strong UV environments lose gas in\nexternal photoevaporative winds. Dust can also be entrained within these winds,\nwhich has consequences for the possible solids reservoir for planet formation,\nand determines the shielding of the disc by the wind. This has previously been\nstudied in 1D models, with predictions for the maximum entrained size, as well\nas a predicted population of stalled dust of decreasing grain size with\ndistance from the disc. We wrote and tested a new dust particle solver to make\nthe first study of the entrainment and dynamics of dust, using steady state\nsolutions of state-of-the-art 1D and 2D radiation hydrodynamic simulations of\nexternally photoevaporating discs. In our 1D models, we only consider the outer\ndisc at the midplane, verifying previous studies. In our 2D simulations, the\nwind is launched from the disc surface, as well as the disc edge. In 2D we find\nthat the maximum entrained grain size varies substantially with angle relative\nto the plane of the disc, from $\\sim100$$\\mu$m near the disc outer edge down to\n$\\sim1$$\\mu$m or even sub-micron in the weaker wind from the disc surface. The\ngradient of stalled dust seen in 1D also only appears near the disc outer edge\nin 2D, but not from the disc surface. This agrees qualitatively with\nobservations of silhouette discs in the Orion Nebula Cluster. Despite the\nspatial variation of the dust, the extinction of the UV radiation remains\nfairly uniform due to the opacity being dominated by the small grains, and\ndepends more on the dust distribution within the disc itself.",

Using our recently proposed technique,\nwe investigate the prospect of discovering the SMBHB population and its\nevolution by combining the SGWB signal and its anisotropies with galaxy\nobservation by exploring their cross-correlation. Using a Fisher analysis, we\ndemonstrate that the SGWB power spectrum alone can provide only a weak\nmeasurement of the cosmic genealogy of SMBHBs, while the inclusion of the\nangular power spectrum of SGWB and its cross-correlation with the galaxy\ndistribution can significantly improve our measurement and open a discovery\nspace. With a PTA of 2000 pulsars, achievable in the SKA era, we find that the\nredshift evolution of the supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass and galaxy\nstellar mass can be measured with an SNR up to 4 in the redshift range up to\nthree. The frequency distribution can be constrained with an SNR of\napproximately up to 80 in the same redshift range at a frequency range\naccessible from nHz. These SNRs improve further with the increase in the number\nof pulsars to 5000 expected from SKA.

However, its\nredshift-dependent spectrum remains poorly constrained due to line-of-sight\nprojection effects. We address this by cross-correlating 11 far-infrared\nintensity maps spanning a 50-fold frequency range from Planck, Herschel, and\nIRAS, with spectroscopic galaxies and quasars from SDSS I-IV tomographically.\nWe mitigate foregrounds using CSFD, a CIB-free Milky Way dust map. These\ncross-correlation amplitudes on two-halo scales trace bias-weighted CIB\nredshift distributions and collectively yield a $60\\sigma$ detection of the\nevolving CIB spectrum, sampled across hundreds of rest-frame frequencies over\n$0 < z < 4$. We break the bias-intensity degeneracy by adding monopole\ninformation from FIRAS+Planck. The recovered spectrum reveals a dust\ntemperature distribution that is broad, spanning the full range of host\nenvironments, and moderately evolving. Using low-frequency CIB amplitudes, we\nconstrain cosmic dust density, $\\Omega_{\\rm dust}$, which peaks at $z =\n1$-$1.5$ and declines threefold to the present. Our broad spectral coverage\nenables a determination of the total infrared luminosity density to 0.04 dex\nstatistical precision, tracing star-formation history with negligible cosmic\nvariance across 90% of cosmic time. We find that cosmic star formation is 80%\ndust-obscured at $z = 0$ and 60% at $z = 4$. Our results, based on intensity\nmapping, are complete, requiring no extrapolation to faint galaxies or\nlow-surface-brightness components.

To date, coronal condensations have only been found in\nsimulations of steadily-heated loops, and never in impulsively-heated ones. We\nimplement spatiotemporally variable elemental abundances in a radiative\nhydrodynamic code. Flows, including chromospheric evaporation, directly cause a\nshift in the local elemental abundances, which then affects the local radiative\nloss rate. As a consequence, we find that incorporating spatiotemporal low FIP\nelemental abundances into coronal loop simulations directly causes coronal\ncondensations, which are otherwise absent in impulsively heated loop or flare\nmodels.

We show that Gemma 2B Instruct and LLaMA 3.2 3B Instruct exhibit\nstrong biases. Gemma grants admission to 26% more White than Black applicants,\nand LLaMA hires 60% more Asian than White applicants. We demonstrate that these\nbiases are resistant to prompt engineering: multiple prompting strategies all\nfail to promote fairness. In contrast, using distributed alignment search, we\ncan identify \"race subspaces\" within model activations and intervene on them to\ndebias model decisions. Averaging the representation across all races within\nthe subspaces reduces Gemma's bias by 37-57%. Finally, we examine the\ngeneralizability of Gemma's race subspaces, and find limited evidence for\ngeneralization, where changing the prompt format can affect the race\nrepresentation.

Existing methods rely on\n3D contact annotations collected via expensive motion-capture systems or\ntedious manual labeling, limiting scalability and generalization. To overcome\nthis, InteractVLM harnesses the broad visual knowledge of large Vision-Language\nModels (VLMs), fine-tuned with limited 3D contact data. However, directly\napplying these models is non-trivial, as they reason only in 2D, while\nhuman-object contact is inherently 3D.

Unlike traditional\nmethods, which target specific issues like cross-sectional dependence or\nautocorrelation, the EBR test simultaneously examines multiple assumptions by\nanalyzing the largest eigenvalue of a symmetrized residual matrix. Monte Carlo\nsimulations demonstrate that the EBR test is particularly robust in detecting\nnot only standard violations such as autocorrelation and linear cross-sectional\ndependence (CSD) but also more intricate non-linear and non-monotonic\ndependencies, making it a comprehensive and highly flexible tool for enhancing\nthe reliability of panel data analyses.",

    "abstract": "With the rapid adoption of AI tools in learning contexts, it is vital to\nunderstand how these systems shape users' reading processes and cognitive\nengagement. We collected and analyzed text from 124 sessions with AI tools, in\nwhich students used these tools to support them as they read assigned readings\nfor an undergraduate course. We categorized participants' prompts to AI\naccording to Bloom's Taxonomy of educational objectives -- Remembering,\nUnderstanding, Applying, Analyzing, Evaluating. Our results show that\n``Analyzing'' and ``Evaluating'' are more prevalent in users' second and third\nprompts within a single usage session, suggesting a shift toward higher-order\nthinking. However, in reviewing users' engagement with AI tools over several\nweeks, we found that users converge toward passive reading engagement over\ntime. Based on these results, we propose design implications for future AI\nreading-support systems, including structured scaffolds for lower-level\ncognitive tasks (e.g., recalling terms) and proactive prompts that encourage\nhigher-order thinking (e.g., analyzing, applying, evaluating). Additionally, we\nadvocate for adaptive, human-in-the-loop features that allow students and\ninstructors to tailor their reading experiences with AI, balancing efficiency\nwith enriched cognitive engagement. Our paper expands the dialogue on\nintegrating AI into academic reading, highlighting both its potential benefits\nand challenges.",

We demonstrate that preference optimization - a key step in the\nalignment phase - can inadvertently reduce the faithfulness of these\nexplanations. This occurs because the reward model (RM), which guides\nalignment, is tasked with optimizing both the expected quality of the response\nand the appropriateness of the explanations (e.g., minimizing bias or adhering\nto safety standards), creating potential conflicts. The RM lacks a mechanism to\nassess the consistency between the model's internal decision process and the\ngenerated explanation. Consequently, the LLM may engage in \"reward hacking\" by\nproducing a final response that scores highly while giving an explanation\ntailored to maximize reward rather than accurately reflecting its reasoning. To\naddress this issue, we propose enriching the RM's input with a causal\nattribution of the prediction, allowing the RM to detect discrepancies between\nthe generated self-explanation and the model's decision process. In controlled\nsettings, we show that this approach reduces the tendency of the LLM to\ngenerate misleading explanations.",

    "abstract": "The challenge to synchronize augmented reality (AR) across sessions/devices\nhas been solved by relying solely on vision-feature mapping, which is\nsuboptimal in scaling workable space and flaws under visual changes in\nsurroundings. This study implemented AR synchronization solutions utilizing\nlocation beacon technology, namely Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and\nUltra-Wideband (UWB), to discourse scalability issues and inconsistencies in\nthe existing AR system. The framework is bifurcated into two approaches:\nBLE-assist and UWB-assist AR synchronization. The BLE-assist method utilizes\niBeacon technology for room context recognition, integrating with Apple's ARKit\nARWorldMap and Google's ARCore Cloud Anchors. The UWB-assist solution employs\nprecise beacon ranging capabilities fusion with the device's azimuth to\nestablish fixed spatial reference in AR across sessions/devices. Comparative\nevaluations show that the UWB-assist approach outperforms the BLE-assist\napproach in reliability across environmental variations, as it always\nsuccessfully resolves virtual anchors with a near-constant latency average at\n25 seconds, regardless of the physical setting changes. Conversely, the\nBLE-assist implementation tends to be more accurate in resolving virtual\nanchors with a mean of 0.02 metres in position error and within 0.03 radian in\norientation error. In the UWB-assist approach, computed fixed spatial\nreferences have an average disparity of 0.04 metres and 0.11 radians in pose.\nThe UWB-assist approach is ideal for scenarios requiring consistently\nsuccessful localization with acceptable accuracy. In contrast, the BLE-assist\napproach is more suitable when demanding finer precision in virtual anchor\nposes with the performance tradeoffs when the surroundings are altered, such as\nfor destinated short-lived AR sessions.",

We also provide for many ions new Maxwellian-averaged\ncollision strengths which include important corrections to the published\nvalues. The H- and He-like atomic data were recently made available in\nMao+(2022). Here, we provide data for ions of the Li-, Be-, B-, C-, N-, O-,\nNe-, Na-, and Mg-like sequences.",

Prior spectral analysis of H2O ice on\nEuropa relied on low signal-to-noise data at wavelengths >2.5 microns, limiting\nassessment of a 3.1 micron Fresnel peak that is diagnostic of exposed\ncrystalline ice. We report new measurements of H2O ice spectral features using\nhigh signal-to-noise data collected by the NIRSpec spectrograph (1.48 - 5.35\nmicrons) on the James Webb Space Telescope. These data reveal a narrow 3.1\nmicron crystalline H2O ice Fresnel peak, which is primarily located at southern\nlatitudes in Tara and Powys Regiones. Our analysis indicates that crystalline\nice exposed in these low-latitude regiones is likely sustained by ongoing\nthermal (re)crystallization outpacing charged particle amorphization of the top\n10 microns of Europa's regolith over short timescales (<15 days). We also\nmeasured H2O ice features centered near 1.5 microns, 1.65 microns, and 2.0\nmicrons, and a broad 3.6 micron H2O continuum peak, which are all stronger at\nnorthern latitudes, in contrast to the 3.1 micron Fresnel peak identified at\nsouthern latitudes. These results support the hypothesis that H2O ice in\nEuropa's regolith is vertically stratified, with amorphous ice grains\ndominating its exposed surface, except in Tara and Powys Regiones.

This scatter decreases as the timescale\nover which SFRs are averaged increases, declining to a non-negligible ~0.15 -\n0.25 dex at 2 Gyr, underscoring the importance of long-timescale SFH diversity\nto the SFMS scatter. Furthermore, galaxies currently above (below) the SFMS\ntend to have been above (below) the SFMS for at least ~1 Gyr, providing\nevidence that individual galaxies may follow different median tracks through\nSFR$-\\mathrm{M}_*$ space. On shorter timescales (~30 - 100 Myr), galaxies' SFRs\nalso vary on the order of ~0.1 - 0.2 dex.

Although\ns-batch has been widely studied in the literature, very few papers have taken\ninto account a minimum batch size, typical in practical settings such as\nsemiconductor manufacturing and the metal industry. The problem with this\nminimum batch size requirement has been mostly tackled with dynamic programming\nand meta-heuristics, and no article has ever used constraint programming (CP)\nto do so. This paper fills this gap by proposing, three CP models for\ns-batching with minimum batch size: (i) an \\textit{Interval Assignment} model\nthat computes and bounds the size of the batches using the presence literals of\ninterval variables of the jobs. (ii) A \\textit{Global} model that exclusively\nuses global constraints that track the size of the batches over time. (iii) And\na \\textit{Hybrid} model that combines the benefits of the extra global\nconstraints with the efficiency of the sum-of-presences constraints to ensure\nthe minimum batch sizes. The computational experiments on standard cases\ncompare the three CP models with two existing mixed-integer programming (MIP)\nmodels from the literature.

In this work, we perform the first global fit\nof elastic neutrino-nucleus and neutrino-electron scattering data to further\ntest the SM within a consistent framework. Our results on the neutrino charge\nradius, the only non-zero electromagnetic property of neutrinos in the SM, show\nno significant deviation, indicating no large beyond the SM flavor-dependent\neffects for electron and muon neutrinos. By incorporating solar neutrino data\nfrom dark matter direct detection experiments, we also place the most stringent\nconstraints on the tau neutrino charge radius obtained from neutrino scattering\nexperiments. Additionally, we determine updated constraints on the vector and\naxial-vector neutrino-electron neutral current couplings, adjusting for\nflavor-dependent effects and for the different experimental momentum transfers.\nThe global analysis reveals two allowed solutions: one close to the SM\nprediction, and a degenerate solution that is favored.

    "abstract": "There exist many methods to explain how an image classification model\ngenerates its decision, but very little work has explored methods to explain\nwhy a classifier might lack confidence in its prediction. As there are various\nreasons the classifier might lose confidence, it would be valuable for this\nmodel to not only indicate its level of uncertainty but also explain why it is\nuncertain. Counterfactual images have been used to visualize changes that could\nbe made to an image to generate a different classification decision. In this\nwork, we explore the use of counterfactuals to offer an explanation for low\nmodel competency--a generalized form of predictive uncertainty that measures\nconfidence. Toward this end, we develop five novel methods to generate\nhigh-competency counterfactual images, namely Image Gradient Descent (IGD),\nFeature Gradient Descent (FGD), Autoencoder Reconstruction (Reco), Latent\nGradient Descent (LGD), and Latent Nearest Neighbors (LNN). We evaluate these\nmethods across two unique datasets containing images with six known causes for\nlow model competency and find Reco, LGD, and LNN to be the most promising\nmethods for counterfactual generation. We further evaluate how these three\nmethods can be utilized by pre-trained Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)\nto generate language explanations for low model competency. We find that the\ninclusion of a counterfactual image in the language model query greatly\nincreases the ability of the model to generate an accurate explanation for the\ncause of low model competency, thus demonstrating the utility of counterfactual\nimages in explaining low perception model competency.",

Humans (n=50) perform\nat high accuracy, even with few object contours present. This is in contrast to\nmodels which exhibit substantially lower sensitivity to increasing object\ncontours, with most of the over 1,000 models we tested barely performing above\nchance.

Importantly, humans exhibit an integration\nbias -- a preference towards recognizing objects made up of directional\nfragments over directionless fragments. We find that not only do models that\nshare this property perform better at our task, but that this bias also\nincreases with model training dataset size, and training models to exhibit\ncontour integration leads to high shape bias.

In this setting, the learner must incrementally build a\ntraining dataset of predefined size while simultaneously learning the\nunderlying task.

We find\nevidence for systematic underestimation of stellar mass in low-mass galaxies\n($\\leq 10^9 \\rm M_\\odot$) with bursty star formation, which can exceed a factor\nof 10 in individual cases, but on average is typically a factor of 1.25-2.5,\ndepending on the binning methodology and SFH model used. The observed mass\noffset correlates with burstiness (SFR$_{10 \\ \\rm Myr}$/SFR$_{100 \\ \\rm Myr}$)\nand sSFR, such that galaxies with recently rising SFHs have larger mass\noffsets. The integrated SFH models which produce the most consistent stellar\nmasses are the double power-law and non-parametric `continuity' models,\nalthough no integrated model fully reproduces all resolved SFHs. We apply an\noutshining correction factor to the Stellar Mass Function at $z=7$, finding\nlittle impact within the uncertainties.

While cubic and\ntetragonal crystal symmetries tend to produce AMs in which the splitting of\nelectronic iso-energy surfaces has $d$-wave symmetry, hexagonal AMs, such as\nCrSb and MnTe, are $g$-wave AMs. Here we investigate the purely magnetic modes\nand spin-textures of $g$-wave AMs and show that they are drastically different\nfor easy-axial (CrSb) and easy-planar (MnTe) materials. We show that in CrSb\nthe splitting of the chiral magnon branches possesses $g$-wave symmetry, with\neach branch carrying a fixed momentum-independent magnetic moment. The\naltermagnetic splitting is not affected by the easy-axial anisotropy and is the\nsame as that in the nonrelativistic limit. The magnon splitting of MnTe,\nhowever, does not strictly possess $g$-wave symmetry due to its easy-planar\nanisotropy. Instead, the magnetic moment of each branch becomes\nmomentum-dependent, with a distribution that is of $g$-wave symmetry. To\ngeneralize the concept of the altermagnetic splitting beyond the\nnonrelativistic limit, we introduce alternative, directly observable splitting\nparameter which comprises both the magnon eigenenergy and its magnetic moment\nand possesses the $g$-wave symmetry in both easy-axial and easy-planar cases.\nThe associated altermagnetic domain walls in easy-axial CrSb possess a net\nmagnetization with an amplitude that depends on their orientation.",

    "abstract": "Although traditional literature on mortality modeling has focused on single\ncountries in isolation, recent contributions have progressively moved toward\njoint models for multiple countries. Besides favoring borrowing of information\nto improve age-period forecasts, this perspective has also potentials to infer\nlocal similarities among countries' mortality patterns in specific age classes\nand periods that could unveil unexplored demographic trends, while guiding the\ndesign of targeted policies. Advancements along this latter relevant direction\nare currently undermined by the lack of a multi-country model capable of\nincorporating the core structures of age-period mortality surfaces together\nwith clustering patterns among countries that are not global, but rather vary\nlocally across different combinations of ages and periods. We cover this gap by\ndeveloping a novel Bayesian model for log-mortality rates that characterizes\nthe age structure of mortality through a B-spline expansion whose\ncountry-specific dynamic coefficients encode both changes of this age structure\nacross periods and also local clustering patterns among countries under a\ntime-dependent random partition prior for these country-specific dynamic\ncoefficients. While flexible, this formulation admits tractable posterior\ninference leveraging a suitably-designed Gibbs-sampler. The application to\nmortality data from 14 countries unveils local similarities highlighting both\npreviously-recognized demographic phenomena and also yet-unexplored trends.",

Accurate IA modeling is essential for robust\ncosmological inference, but current approaches rely on perturbative methods\nthat break down on nonlinear scales or on expensive simulations. We introduce\nIAEmu, a neural network-based emulator that predicts the galaxy\nposition-position ($\\xi$), position-orientation ($\\omega$), and\norientation-orientation ($\\eta$) correlation functions and their uncertainties\nusing mock catalogs based on the halo occupation distribution (HOD) framework.\nCompared to simulations, IAEmu achieves ~3% average error for $\\xi$ and ~5% for\n$\\omega$, while capturing the stochasticity of $\\eta$ without overfitting. The\nemulator provides both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties, helping identify\nregions where predictions may be less reliable. We also demonstrate\ngeneralization to non-HOD alignment signals by fitting to IllustrisTNG\nhydrodynamical simulation data. As a fully differentiable neural network, IAEmu\nenables $\\sim$10,000$\\times$ speed-ups in mapping HOD parameters to correlation\nfunctions on GPUs, compared to CPU-based simulations.

The PINN models incorporate trial wavefunctions that exactly satisfy\nboundary conditions (Dirichlet zeros at domain boundaries), and they optimize a\nloss functional combining the PDE residual with a normalization constraint. For\nthe infinite well, the ground-state energy is known (E = pi^2 in dimensionless\nunits) and held fixed in training, whereas for the finite well and barrier, the\neigenenergy is treated as a trainable parameter. We use fully-connected neural\nnetworks with smooth activation functions to represent the wavefunction and\ndemonstrate that PINNs can learn the ground-state eigenfunctions and\neigenvalues for these quantum systems. The results show that the PINN-predicted\nwavefunctions closely match analytical solutions or expected behaviors, and the\nlearned eigenenergies converge to known values. We present training logs and\nconvergence of the energy parameter, as well as figures comparing the PINN\nsolutions to exact results. The discussion addresses the performance of PINNs\nrelative to traditional numerical methods, highlighting challenges such as\nconvergence to the correct eigenvalue, sensitivity to initialization, and the\ndifficulty of modeling discontinuous potentials.

Previous studies suggested that near-surface atmospheric\ninversion (NAIV) with planetary boundary air temperature being higher than the\nair temperature adjacent to the surface, is a pronounced phenomenon in hothouse\nclimates. However, the underlying mechanisms are unclear. Here we show that\nlower-tropospheric radiative heating is necessary but not independently\nsufficient in forming the NAIV. Instead, the dynamic heating induced by\nlarge-scale subsidence is essential. With the prescribed reasonable large-scale\nsubsidence, NAIV appears in small-domain cloud-resolving simulations, which was\nnot observed in previous studies. Surface evaporative cooling also contributes\nto the formation of the NAIV. Besides NAIV, we find that surface inversion\n(SIV) with the air adjacent to the surface being warmer than the underlying sea\nsurface is also a distinct phenomenon in hothouse climates. SIV is caused by\nstrong surface evaporative cooling and large atmospheric shortwave absorption.\nThese two types of inversion strongly stabilize the atmosphere, weaken\natmospheric circulation, dry the free troposphere, and suppress the\nhydrological cycle.",

This\nparadigm has quickly made its way into the medical image analysis community. In\nparticular, there is an impressive amount of recent literature developing\nvision-language models for radiology. However, the available medical datasets\nwith image-text supervision are scarce, and medical concepts are fine-grained,\ninvolving expert knowledge that existing vision-language models struggle to\nencode.

We conduct an extensive comparison demonstrating that unimodal\npre-training is highly competitive and better suited to integrating\nheterogeneous data sources.

While existing syntactic resources like the\nPenn Treebank and Universal Dependencies offer extensive annotations for\nphrase-structure and dependency parsing, there is a lack of large-scale corpora\ngrounded in lexicalized grammar formalisms. To address this gap, we introduce\nTAGbank, a corpus of TAG derivations automatically extracted from existing\nsyntactic treebanks.

We also discuss the\nchallenges involved in the extraction process, including ensuring consistency\nacross treebank schemes and dealing with language-specific syntactic\nidiosyncrasies.

However, while MPC excels in planning and control,\nit lacks the capability for environmental perception, leading to failures in\ncomplex and unstructured scenarios. To address this limitation, we introduce\nVision-Language Model Predictive Control (VLMPC), a robotic manipulation\nplanning framework that integrates the perception power of vision-language\nmodels (VLMs) with MPC. VLMPC utilizes a conditional action sampling module\nthat takes a goal image or language instruction as input and leverages VLM to\ngenerate candidate action sequences. These candidates are fed into a video\nprediction model that simulates future frames based on the actions. In\naddition, we propose an enhanced variant, Traj-VLMPC, which replaces video\nprediction with motion trajectory generation to reduce computational complexity\nwhile maintaining accuracy. Traj-VLMPC estimates motion dynamics conditioned on\nthe candidate actions, offering a more efficient alternative for long-horizon\ntasks and real-time applications. Both VLMPC and Traj-VLMPC select the optimal\naction sequence using a VLM-based hierarchical cost function that captures both\npixel-level and knowledge-level consistency between the current observation and\nthe task input.

    "abstract": "Communication remains a key factor limiting the applicability of distributed\nmodel predictive control (DMPC) in realistic settings, despite advances in\nwireless communication. DMPC schemes can require an overwhelming amount of\ninformation exchange between agents as the amount of data depends on the length\nof the predication horizon, for which some applications require a significant\nlength to formally guarantee nominal asymptotic stability. This work aims to\nprovide an approach to reduce the communication effort of DMPC by reducing the\nsize of the communicated data between agents. Using an autoencoder, the\ncommunicated data is reduced by the encoder part of the autoencoder prior to\ncommunication and reconstructed by the decoder part upon reception within the\ndistributed optimization algorithm that constitutes the DMPC scheme. The choice\nof a learning-based reduction method is motivated by structure inherent to the\ndata, which results from the data's connection to solutions of optimal control\nproblems. The approach is implemented and tested at the example of formation\ncontrol of differential-drive robots, which is challenging for\noptimization-based control due to the robots' nonholonomic constraints, and\nwhich is interesting due to the practical importance of mobile robotics. The\napplicability of the proposed approach is presented first in form of a\nsimulative analysis showing that the resulting control performance yields a\nsatisfactory accuracy. In particular, the proposed approach outperforms the\ncanonical naive way to reduce communication by reducing the length of the\nprediction horizon. Moreover, it is shown that numerical experiments conducted\non embedded computation hardware, with real distributed computation and\nwireless communication, work well with the proposed way of reducing\ncommunication even in practical scenarios in which full communication fails.",

Vision-based beam prediction\nutilizing RGB camera images emerges as a promising solution for accurate and\nresponsive beam selection. However, reliance on visual data introduces unique\nvulnerabilities, particularly susceptibility to adversarial attacks, thus\npotentially compromising beam accuracy and overall network reliability. In this\npaper, we conduct the first systematic exploration of adversarial threats\nspecifically targeting vision-based mmWave beam selection systems. Traditional\nwhite-box attacks are impractical in this context because ground-truth beam\nindices are inaccessible and spatial dynamics are complex. To address this, we\npropose a novel black-box adversarial attack strategy, termed Spatial Proxy\nAttack (SPA), which leverages spatial correlations between user positions and\nbeam indices to craft effective perturbations without requiring access to model\nparameters or labels. To counteract these adversarial vulnerabilities, we\nformulate an optimization framework aimed at simultaneously enhancing beam\nselection accuracy under clean conditions and robustness against adversarial\nperturbations. We introduce a hybrid deep learning architecture integrated with\na dedicated Feature Refinement Module (FRM), designed to systematically filter\nirrelevant, noisy and adversarially perturbed visual features. Evaluations\nusing standard backbone models such as ResNet-50 and MobileNetV2 demonstrate\nthat our proposed method significantly improves performance, achieving up to an\n+21.07\\% gain in Top-K accuracy under clean conditions and a 41.31\\% increase\nin Top-1 adversarial robustness compared to different baseline models.",

We evaluate decoder-only models (eg, Mistral-7B and Llama2-7B) and\nencoder-decoder models (eg, Flan-T5 Base) on the TACRED and FewRel datasets.\nTask-incremental fine-tuning of LLMs demonstrates superior performance over\nearlier approaches using encoder-only models like BERT on TACRED, excelling in\nseen-task accuracy and overall performance (measured by whole and average\naccuracy), particularly with the Mistral and Flan-T5 models. Results on FewRel\nare similarly promising, achieving second place in whole and average accuracy\nmetrics. This work underscores critical factors in knowledge transfer, language\nmodel architecture, and KG completeness, advancing CRE with LLMs and memory\nreplay for dynamic, real-time relation extraction.",

    "abstract": "Establishing a communication system is hard because the intended meaning of a\nsignal is unknown to its receiver when first produced, and the signaller also\nhas no idea how that signal will be interpreted. Most theoretical accounts of\nthe emergence of communication systems rely on feedback to reinforce behaviours\nthat have led to successful communication in the past. However, providing such\nfeedback requires already being able to communicate the meaning that was\nintended or interpreted. Therefore these accounts cannot explain how\ncommunication can be bootstrapped from non-communicative behaviours. Here we\npresent a model that shows how a communication system, capable of expressing an\nunbounded number of meanings, can emerge as a result of individual behavioural\ndifferences in a large population without any pre-existing means to determine\ncommunicative success. The two key cognitive capabilities responsible for this\noutcome are behaving predictably in a given situation, and an alignment of\npsychological states ahead of signal production that derives from shared\nintentionality. Since both capabilities can exist independently of\ncommunication, our results are compatible with theories in which large flexible\nsocially-learned communication systems like language are the product of a\ngeneral but well-developed capacity for social cognition.",

    "abstract": "Machine learning (ML) systems are vulnerable to performance decline over time\ndue to dataset shift. To address this problem, experts often suggest that ML\nsystems should be regularly updated to ensure ongoing performance stability.\nSome scholarly literature has begun to address the epistemic and ethical\nchallenges associated with different updating methodologies. Thus far, however,\nlittle attention has been paid to the impact of model updating on the\nML-assisted decision-making process itself, particularly in the AI ethics and\nAI epistemology literatures. This article aims to address this gap in the\nliterature. It argues that model updating introduces a new sub-type of opacity\ninto ML-assisted decision-making -- update opacity -- that occurs when users\ncannot understand how or why an update has changed the reasoning or behaviour\nof an ML system. This type of opacity presents a variety of distinctive\nepistemic and safety concerns that available solutions to the black box problem\nin ML are largely ill-equipped to address. A variety of alternative strategies\nmay be developed or pursued to address the problem of update opacity more\ndirectly, including bi-factual explanations, dynamic model reporting, and\nupdate compatibility. However, each of these strategies presents its own risks\nor carries significant limitations. Further research will be needed to address\nthe epistemic and safety concerns associated with model updating and update\nopacity going forward.",

A common technique here is for each party to sample their\nnoise from the decomposition of an infinitely divisible distribution. We\nanalyze two mechanisms in this setting: 1) the generalized discrete Laplace\n(GDL) mechanism, whose distribution (which is closed under summation) follows\nfrom differences of i.i.d. negative binomial shares, and 2) the multi-scale\ndiscrete Laplace (MSDLap) mechanism, a novel mechanism following the sum of\nmultiple i.i.d. discrete Laplace shares at different scales.\n  For $\\varepsilon \\geq 1$, our mechanisms can be parameterized to have\n$O\\left(\\Delta^3 e^{-\\varepsilon}\\right)$ and $O\\left(\\min\\left(\\Delta^3\ne^{-\\varepsilon}, \\Delta^2 e^{-2\\varepsilon/3}\\right)\\right)$ MSE,\nrespectively, where $\\Delta$ denote the sensitivity; the latter bound matches\nknown optimality results. We also show a transformation from the discrete\nsetting to the continuous setting, which allows us to transform both mechanisms\nto the continuous setting and thereby achieve the optimal $O\\left(\\Delta^2\ne^{-2\\varepsilon / 3}\\right)$ MSE. To our knowledge, these are the first\ninfinitely divisible additive noise mechanisms that achieve order-optimal MSE\nunder pure DP, so our work shows formally there is no separation in utility\nwhen query-independent noise adding mechanisms are restricted to infinitely\ndivisible noise. For the continuous setting, our result improves upon the Arete\nmechanism from [Pagh and Stausholm, ALT 2022] which gives an MSE of\n$O\\left(\\Delta^2 e^{-\\varepsilon/4}\\right)$.

For abundant systems, this approach led to algebraic integrability\nconditions that essentially allow one to restore a system from the knowledge of\nits structure tensor in a point on the manifold. Here we study the geometric\nstructure formalising such systems, which we call an abundant manifold. The\nunderlying Riemannian manifold is necessarily conformally flat. We establish a\ncorrespondence between these superintegrable systems and the geometry of affine\nhypersurfaces. More precisely, we show that abundant manifolds correspond to\ncertain non-degenerate relative affine hypersurfaces normalisations in $\\mathbb\nR^{n+1}$ ($n\\ge 2$). We also formulate the necessary and sufficient conditions\nnon-degenerate relative affine hypersurface normalisations in $\\mathbb R^{n+1}$\nneed to satisfy, if they arise from abundant manifolds. These relative affine\nhypersurface normalisations are called abundant hypersurface normalisations.\nBoth for abundant manifolds and for relative affine hypersurface normalisations\na natural concept of conformal equivalence can be defined. We prove that they\nare compatible, permitting us to identify conformal classes of abundant\nmanifolds with abundant hypersurface immersions (without specified\nnormalisation).",

Focusing on\ntree-level $2\\to2$ processes, we analyze the leading-order amplitudes involving\nbulk KK matter fields and KK gauge/gravitational Goldstone bosons. By imposing\nthe gauge theory equivalence theorem (GAET) and the gravitational equivalence\ntheorem (GRET) within warped KK theories, we systematically reconstruct the\nleading-order amplitudes for physical KK gauge bosons and gravitons, thereby\ncircumventing the intricate energy cancellations inherent in physical\namplitudes. Within this framework, the correspondence between GAET and GRET\narises as a direct manifestation of the leading-order double-copy relation in\nthe high-energy expansion. This connection provides a foundation for extending\nthe BCJ double-copy construction to four-point amplitudes involving bulk KK\nmatter fields, and further generalizes to arbitrary $N$-point cases, enabling a\nsystematic derivation of the corresponding gravitational amplitudes with\nconsistent incorporation of KK matter fields at leading order.",

    "abstract": "We present a Bayesian procedure for estimation of pairwise intervention\neffects in a high-dimensional system of categorical variables. We assume that\nwe have observational data generated from an unknown causal Bayesian network\nfor which there are no latent confounders. Most of the existing methods\ndeveloped for this setting assume that the underlying model is linear Gaussian,\nincluding the Bayesian IDA (BIDA) method that we build upon in this work. By\ncombining a Bayesian backdoor estimator with model averaging, we obtain a\nposterior over the intervention distributions of a cause-effect pair that can\nbe expressed as a mixture over stochastic linear combinations of Dirichlet\ndistributions. Although there is no closed-form expression for the posterior\ndensity, it is straightforward to produce Monte Carlo approximations of target\nquantities through direct sampling, and we also derive closed-form expressions\nfor a few selected moments. To scale up the proposed procedure, we employ\nMarkov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), which also enables us to use more efficient\nadjustment sets compared to the current exact BIDA. Finally, we use\nJensen-Shannon divergence to define a novel causal effect based on a set of\nintervention distributions in the general categorical setting. We compare our\nmethod to the original IDA method and existing Bayesian approaches in numerical\nsimulations and show that categorical BIDA performs favorably against the\nexisting alternative methods in terms of producing point estimates and\ndiscovering strong effects.",

This\ndevelopment increases the risk of technique misuse and threatens social\nsecurity. Audio watermarking can embed imperceptible marks into generated\naudio, providing a promising approach for secure NSG usage. However, current\naudio watermarking methods are mainly applied at the audio-level or\nfeature-level, which are not suitable for open-sourced scenarios where source\ncodes and model weights are released. To address this limitation, we propose a\nPlug-and-play Parameter-level WaterMarking (P2Mark) method for NSG.\nSpecifically, we embed watermarks into the released model weights, offering a\nreliable solution for proactively tracing and protecting model copyrights in\nopen-source scenarios. During training, we introduce a lightweight watermark\nadapter into the pre-trained model, allowing watermark information to be merged\ninto the model via this adapter. This design ensures both the flexibility to\nmodify the watermark before model release and the security of embedding the\nwatermark within model parameters after model release. Meanwhile, we propose a\ngradient orthogonal projection optimization strategy to ensure the quality of\nthe generated audio and the accuracy of watermark preservation. Experimental\nresults on two mainstream waveform decoders in NSG (i.e., vocoder and codec)\ndemonstrate that P2Mark achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art\naudio watermarking methods that are not applicable to open-source white-box\nprotection scenarios, in terms of watermark extraction accuracy, watermark\nimperceptibility, and robustness.",

    "abstract": "Beamforming is a key technology in millimeter-wave (mmWave) communications\nthat improves signal transmission by optimizing directionality and intensity.\nHowever, conventional channel estimation methods, such as pilot signals or beam\nsweeping, often fail to adapt to rapidly changing communication environments.\nTo address this limitation, multimodal sensing-aided beam prediction has gained\nsignificant attention, using various sensing data from devices such as LiDAR,\nradar, GPS, and RGB images to predict user locations or network conditions.\nDespite its promising potential, the adoption of multimodal sensing-aided beam\nprediction is hindered by high computational complexity, high costs, and\nlimited datasets. Thus, in this paper, a resource-efficient learning approach\nis proposed to transfer knowledge from a multimodal network to a monomodal\n(radar-only) network based on cross-modal relational knowledge distillation\n(CRKD), while reducing computational overhead and preserving predictive\naccuracy. To enable multimodal learning with realistic data, a novel multimodal\nsimulation framework is developed while integrating sensor data generated from\nthe autonomous driving simulator CARLA with MATLAB-based mmWave channel\nmodeling, and reflecting real-world conditions. The proposed CRKD achieves its\nobjective by distilling relational information across different feature spaces,\nwhich enhances beam prediction performance without relying on expensive sensor\ndata. Simulation results demonstrate that CRKD efficiently distills multimodal\nknowledge, allowing a radar-only model to achieve $94.62\\%$ of the teacher\nperformance. In particular, this is achieved with just $10\\%$ of the teacher\nnetwork's parameters, thereby significantly reducing computational complexity\nand dependence on multimodal sensor data.",

Despite advances in\ndeep learning, challenges such as high intra-class variance and class imbalance\nlimit precise vessel delineation. Most existing approaches for coronary DSA\nsegmentation cannot address these issues. Also, existing segmentation network's\nencoders do not directly generate semantic embeddings, which could enable the\ndecoder to reconstruct segmentation masks effectively from these well-defined\nfeatures. We propose a Supervised Prototypical Contrastive Loss that fuses\nsupervised and prototypical contrastive learning to enhance coronary DSA image\nsegmentation. The supervised contrastive loss enforces semantic embeddings in\nthe encoder, improving feature differentiation. The prototypical contrastive\nloss allows the model to focus on the foreground class while alleviating the\nhigh intra-class variance and class imbalance problems by concentrating only on\nthe hard-to-classify background samples. We implement the proposed SPCL loss\nwithin an MSA-UNet3+: a Multi-Scale Attention-Enhanced UNet3+ architecture.

However, existing GenIR models suffer from token-level\nmisalignment, where models trained to predict the next token often fail to\ncapture document-level relevance effectively. While reinforcement\nlearning-based methods, such as reinforcement learning from relevance feedback\n(RLRF), aim to address this misalignment through reward modeling, they\nintroduce significant complexity, requiring the optimization of an auxiliary\nreward function followed by reinforcement fine-tuning, which is computationally\nexpensive and often unstable. To address these challenges, we propose direct\ndocument relevance optimization (DDRO), which aligns token-level docid\ngeneration with document-level relevance estimation through direct optimization\nvia pairwise ranking, eliminating the need for explicit reward modeling and\nreinforcement learning. Experimental results on benchmark datasets, including\nMS MARCO document and Natural Questions, show that DDRO outperforms\nreinforcement learning-based methods, achieving a 7.4% improvement in MRR@10\nfor MS MARCO and a 19.9% improvement for Natural Questions.

We show that when symmetries\nor approximate symmetries are present, the VAE self-organizes its latent space,\neffectively compressing the data along a reduced number of latent variables.\nThis behavior captures the intrinsic dimensionality determined by the symmetry\nconstraints and reveals hidden relations among the features.

However, it still faces challenges due to the\nmisalignment of scale and spatial information between features extracted from\n2D images and those derived from 3D point clouds. Existing methods usually\naggregate multimodal features at a single stage. However, leveraging\nmulti-stage cross-modal features is crucial for detecting objects of various\nscales. Therefore, these methods often struggle to integrate features across\ndifferent scales and modalities effectively, thereby restricting the accuracy\nof detection. Additionally, the time-consuming Query-Key-Value-based\n(QKV-based) cross-attention operations often utilized in existing methods aid\nin reasoning the location and existence of objects by capturing non-local\ncontexts. However, this approach tends to increase computational complexity. To\naddress these challenges, we present SSLFusion, a novel Scale & Space Aligned\nLatent Fusion Model, consisting of a scale-aligned fusion strategy (SAF), a\n3D-to-2D space alignment module (SAM), and a latent cross-modal fusion module\n(LFM). SAF mitigates scale misalignment between modalities by aggregating\nfeatures from both images and point clouds across multiple levels. SAM is\ndesigned to reduce the inter-modal gap between features from images and point\nclouds by incorporating 3D coordinate information into 2D image features.\nAdditionally, LFM captures cross-modal non-local contexts in the latent space\nwithout utilizing the QKV-based attention operations, thus mitigating\ncomputational complexity.

However, most current research focuses\nsolely on the fusion of audio and text features, overlooking the valuable\ninformation in emotion labels. This oversight could potentially hinder the\nperformance of existing methods, as emotion labels harbor rich, insightful\ninformation that could significantly aid MER. We introduce a novel model called\nLabel Signal-Guided Multimodal Emotion Recognition (LSGMER) to overcome this\nlimitation. This model aims to fully harness the power of emotion label\ninformation to boost the classification accuracy and stability of MER.\nSpecifically, LSGMER employs a Label Signal Enhancement module that optimizes\nthe representation of modality features by interacting with audio and text\nfeatures through label embeddings, enabling it to capture the nuances of\nemotions precisely. Furthermore, we propose a Joint Objective Optimization(JOO)\napproach to enhance classification accuracy by introducing the\nAttribution-Prediction Consistency Constraint (APC), which strengthens the\nalignment between fused features and emotion categories. Extensive experiments\nconducted on the IEMOCAP and MELD datasets have demonstrated the effectiveness\nof our proposed LSGMER model.",

However, the correlation\nbetween crystal/band structure and other physical properties still eludes\nunderstanding: carrier mobility increases non-intuitively with carrier\nconcentration; the observed $T^2$ temperature dependence of resistivity lacks\nexplanation. Moreover, a very high relative out-of-plane permittivity of about\n150 has been reported in the literature. A proper explanation for such a high\npermittivity is still lacking. We have performed infrared (IR) reflectivity and\nRaman scattering experiments on a large perfect single crystal with defined\nmosaicity, carrier concentration and mobility. Five of the eight phonons\nallowed by factor group theory have been observed and their symmetries\ndetermined. The IR spectra show that the permittivity measured in the\ntetragonal plane is as high as ${\\epsilon}_r{\\approx}500$, and this high value\nis due to a strong polar phonon with a low frequency of ~34 $cm^{-1}$ (~1 THz).\nSuch an unusually high permittivity allows the screening of charge defects,\nleading to the observation of high electron mobility at low temperatures. It\nalso allows effective modulation doping providing a platform for high\nperformance 2D electronics. DFT calculations suggest the existence of a very\nlow frequency acoustic phonon ~14 $cm^{-1}$ (~0.4 THz). Both the low frequency\nphonons cause anomalous phonon DOS, which is reflected in the unconventional\ntemperature dependence of the heat capacity, $c_M{\\approx}T^{3.5}$.

Although sparse training methods can reduce communication overhead\nand computational burden in FL, they are often not used in practice for the\nfollowing key reasons: (1) data heterogeneity makes it harder for clients to\nreach consensus on sparse models compared to dense ones, requiring longer\ntraining; (2) methods for obtaining sparse masks lack adaptivity to accommodate\nvery heterogeneous data distributions, crucial in cross-device FL; and (3)\nadditional hyperparameters are required, which are notably challenging to tune\nin FL. This paper presents SparsyFed, a practical federated sparse training\nmethod that critically addresses the problems above. Previous works have only\nsolved one or two of these challenges at the expense of introducing new\ntrade-offs, such as clients' consensus on masks versus sparsity pattern\nadaptivity. We show that SparsyFed simultaneously (1) can produce 95% sparse\nmodels, with negligible degradation in accuracy, while only needing a single\nhyperparameter, (2) achieves a per-round weight regrowth 200 times smaller than\nprevious methods, and (3) allows the sparse masks to adapt to highly\nheterogeneous data distributions and outperform all baselines under such\nconditions.",

Our approach incorporates\npost-decision states and dual critics to reduce the problem's dimensionality\nand enhance the accuracy of value function estimation.

    "abstract": "The concept of parameter setting is a crucial and significant process in\nmetaheuristics since it can majorly impact their performance. It is a highly\ncomplex and challenging procedure since it requires a deep understanding of the\noptimization algorithm and the optimization problem at hand. In recent years,\nthe upcoming rise of autonomous decision systems has attracted ongoing\nscientific interest in this direction, utilizing a considerable number of\nparameter-tuning methods. There are two types of methods: offline and online.\nOnline methods usually excel in complex real-world problems, as they can offer\ndynamic parameter control throughout the execution of the algorithm. The\npresent work proposes a general-purpose online parameter-tuning method called\nCluster-Based Parameter Adaptation (CPA) for population-based metaheuristics.\nThe main idea lies in the identification of promising areas within the\nparameter search space and in the generation of new parameters around these\nareas. The method's validity has been demonstrated using the differential\nevolution algorithm and verified in established test suites of low- and\nhigh-dimensional problems. The obtained results are statistically analyzed and\ncompared with state-of-the-art algorithms, including advanced auto-tuning\napproaches. The analysis reveals the promising solid CPA's performance as well\nas its robustness under a variety of benchmark problems and dimensions.",

In contrast, offline transaction systems aim\nto enable users to agree on and execute transactions without assuming bounded\ncommunication delays when interacting with the blockchain. Most existing\noffline payment schemes depend on trusted hardware wallets that are assumed to\nbe secure and tamper-proof. While this work introduces Overdraft, a novel\noffline payment system that shifts the reliance from hardware to users\nthemselves. Overdraft allows potential payment receivers to assess the\nlikelihood of being paid, allowing them to accept transactions with confidence\nor deny them. Overdraft achieves this by maintaining a loan network that is\nweighted by online reputation. This loan network contains time-limited\nagreements where users pledge to cover another user's payment if necessary. For\nexample, when a payer lacks sufficient funds at the moment of commitment.\nOffline users rely on the last known view of the loan network -- which they had\naccess to when last online -- to determine whether to participate in an offline\ntransaction. This view is used to estimate the probability of eventual payment,\npossibly using multiple loans. Once online again, users commit their\ntransactions to the blockchain with any conflicts being resolved\ndeterministically. Overdraft incorporates incentives for users and is designed\nto be resilient against Sybil attacks. As a proof of concept, we implemented\nOverdraft as an Ethereum Solidity smart contract and deployed it on the Sepolia\ntestnet to evaluate its performance.",

However, challenges arise with the fine-tuning strategies when VLMs are\ntransferred to OWT: full fine-tuning results in excessive parameter and memory\ncosts, while the zero-shot strategy leads to sub-optimal performance. To solve\nthe problem, EffOWT is proposed for efficiently transferring VLMs to OWT.\nSpecifically, we build a small and independent learnable side network outside\nthe VLM backbone. By freezing the backbone and only executing backpropagation\non the side network, the model's efficiency requirements can be met. In\naddition, EffOWT enhances the side network by proposing a hybrid structure of\nTransformer and CNN to improve the model's performance in the OWT field.\nFinally, we implement sparse interactions on the MLP, thus reducing parameter\nupdates and memory costs significantly. Thanks to the proposed methods, EffOWT\nachieves an absolute gain of 5.5% on the tracking metric OWTA for unknown\ncategories, while only updating 1.3% of the parameters compared to full\nfine-tuning, with a 36.4% memory saving.

Traditional compartmental models often struggle to estimate\ntemporally and spatially varying epidemiological parameters, while deep\nlearning models typically overlook disease transmission dynamics and lack\ninterpretability in the epidemiological context. To address these limitations,\nwe propose a novel Causal Spatiotemporal Graph Neural Network (CSTGNN), a\nhybrid framework that integrates a Spatio-Contact SIR model with Graph Neural\nNetworks (GNNs) to capture the spatiotemporal propagation of epidemics.\nInter-regional human mobility exhibits continuous and smooth spatiotemporal\npatterns, leading to adjacent graph structures that share underlying mobility\ndynamics. To model these dynamics, we employ an adaptive static connectivity\ngraph to represent the stable components of human mobility and utilize a\ntemporal dynamics model to capture fluctuations within these patterns. By\nintegrating the adaptive static connectivity graph with the temporal dynamics\ngraph, we construct a dynamic graph that encapsulates the comprehensive\nproperties of human mobility networks. Additionally, to capture temporal trends\nand variations in infectious disease spread, we introduce a temporal\ndecomposition model to handle temporal dependence. This model is then\nintegrated with a dynamic graph convolutional network for epidemic forecasting.\nWe validate our model using real-world datasets at the provincial level in\nChina and the state level in Germany.

As FL gains popularity, clients may need to train\nmultiple unrelated FL models, but communication constraints limit their ability\nto train all models simultaneously. While clients could train FL models\nsequentially, opportunistically having FL clients concurrently train different\nmodels -- termed multi-model federated learning (MMFL) -- can reduce the\noverall training time. Prior work uses simple client-to-model assignments that\ndo not optimize the contribution of each client to each model over the course\nof its training. Prior work on single-model FL shows that intelligent client\nselection can greatly accelerate convergence, but na\\\"ive extensions to MMFL\ncan violate heterogeneous resource constraints at both the server and the\nclients. In this work, we develop a novel convergence analysis of MMFL with\narbitrary client sampling methods, theoretically demonstrating the strengths\nand limitations of previous well-established gradient-based methods. Motivated\nby this analysis, we propose MMFL-LVR, a loss-based sampling method that\nminimizes training variance while explicitly respecting communication limits at\nthe server and reducing computational costs at the clients.

Recent all-in-one frameworks that handle\nmultiple weather degradations within a unified model have shown potential.\nHowever, the diversity of degradation patterns across different weather\nconditions, as well as the complex and varied nature of real-world\ndegradations, pose significant challenges for multiple weather removal. To\naddress these challenges, we propose an innovative diffusion paradigm with\ndegradation-aware adaptive priors for all-in-one weather restoration, termed\nDA2Diff. It is a new exploration that applies CLIP to perceive\ndegradation-aware properties for better multi-weather restoration.\nSpecifically, we deploy a set of learnable prompts to capture degradation-aware\nrepresentations by the prompt-image similarity constraints in the CLIP space.\nBy aligning the snowy/hazy/rainy images with snow/haze/rain prompts, each\nprompt contributes to different weather degradation characteristics. The\nlearned prompts are then integrated into the diffusion model via the designed\nweather specific prompt guidance module, making it possible to restore multiple\nweather types. To further improve the adaptiveness to complex weather\ndegradations, we propose a dynamic expert selection modulator that employs a\ndynamic weather-aware router to flexibly dispatch varying numbers of\nrestoration experts for each weather-distorted image, allowing the diffusion\nmodel to restore diverse degradations adaptively.

To validate\nthis prediction, we design a PDMS-based experimental platform with a\nspeaker-based flow-generation apparatus and a pressure acquisition system with\nmultiple ports along the axial length of the channel. The experimental\nmeasurements show good agreement with the predicted pressure profiles across a\nwide range of the key dimensionless quantities: the Womersley number, the\ncompliance number, and the elastoviscous number.

    "abstract": "The nature of a superconductor is fundamentally determined by the symmetries\nbroken in its order parameter. Here, we report an exceptionally exotic\nsuperconducting phase in rhombohedral hexalayer graphene that simultaneously\nbreaks rotational, translational, and time-reversal symmetries. We show that\nsuperconductivity emerges from a quarter-metallic state and is accompanied by\nthe onset of stripe charge order. This unique intertwinement is revealed by\nangle-resolved transport measurements, which demonstrate dissipationless\ncurrent confined to a single principal axis-forming one-dimensional-like\nsuperconducting channels -- while the orthogonal direction remains resistive\ndown to the lowest temperatures. The formation of stripe order is marked by a\nfirst-order melting transition, evidenced by pronounced thermal hysteresis upon\nwarming and cooling. In addition, magnetic-field-induced switching between\nsuperconducting states -- reminiscent of behavior previously observed in\nrhombohedral tetra- and pentalayer graphene -- signals time-reversal symmetry\nbreaking. Collectively, these observations reveal a previously unrecognized\nquantum phase: a chiral superconductor embedded within a stripe-ordered\nanomalous Hall state.",

    "abstract": "Rayleigh-Taylor (RT) instability commonly arises in compressible systems with\ntime-dependent acceleration in practical applications. To capture the complex\ndynamics of such systems, a two-component discrete Boltzmann method is\ndeveloped to systematically investigate the compressible RT instability driven\nby variable acceleration. Specifically, the effects of different acceleration\nperiods, amplitudes, and phases are systematically analyzed. The simulation\nresults are interpreted from three key perspectives: the density gradient,\nwhich characterizes the spatial variation in density; the thermodynamic\nnon-equilibrium strength, which quantifies the system's deviation from local\nthermodynamic equilibrium; and the fraction of non-equilibrium regions, which\ncaptures the spatial distribution of non-equilibrium behaviors. Notably, the\nfluid system exhibits rich and diverse dynamic patterns resulting from the\ninterplay of multiple competing physical mechanisms, including time-dependent\nacceleration, RT instability, diffusion, and dissipation effects. These\nfindings provide deeper insights into the evolution and regulation of\ncompressible RT instability under complex driving conditions.",

Using a large-scale quantum Monte Carlo method, we obtain a\nrich ground state phase diagram. Around half-filling, the infinite long-range\nlight-matter interaction lifts the ground state degeneracy, resulting in a\nnovel order-coexisted superradiant clock (SRC) phase that completely destroys\nthe fragile order-by-disorder (OBD) phase observed in classical light fields.\nAccording to the Ginzburg-Landau theory, this replacement may result from the\ncompetition between threefold and sixfold clock terms. Similar to the spin\nsupersolid, the clear first-order phase transition at the $Z_2$ symmetry line\nis attributed to the nonzero photon density, which couples to the threefold\nclock term. Finally, we discuss the low-energy physics in the dimer language\nand propose that cavity-mediated nonlocal ring exchange interactions may play a\ncritical role in the rich physics induced by the attachment of cavity-QED.

    "abstract": "Clustering is an efficient and essential technique for exploring latent\nknowledge of data. However, limited attention has been given to the\ninterpretability of the clusters detected by most clustering algorithms. In\naddition, due to the homogeneity of data, different groups of data have their\nown homogeneous styles. In this paper, the above two aspects are considered,\nand an interpretable style Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) fuzzy clustering\n(IS-TSK-FC) algorithm is proposed. The clustering behavior of IS-TSK-FC is\nfully guided by the TSK fuzzy inference on fuzzy rules. In particular, samples\nare grouped into clusters represented by the corresponding consequent vectors\nof all fuzzy rules learned in an unsupervised manner. This can explain how the\nclusters are generated in detail, thus making the underlying decision-making\nprocess of the IS-TSK-FC interpretable. Moreover, a series of style matrices\nare introduced to facilitate the consequents of fuzzy rules in IS-TSK-FC by\ncapturing the styles of clusters as well as the nuances between different\nstyles. Consequently, all the fuzzy rules in IS-TSK-FC have powerful data\nrepresentation capability. After determining the antecedents of all the fuzzy\nrules, the optimization problem of IS-TSK-FC can be iteratively solved in an\nalternation manner. The effectiveness of IS-TSK-FC as an interpretable\nclustering tool is validated through extensive experiments on benchmark\ndatasets with unknown implicit/explicit styles. Specially, the superior\nclustering performance of IS-TSK-FC is demonstrated on case studies where\ndifferent groups of data present explicit styles.

As transistor geometries shrink and voltages decrease,\nmodern electronic devices become more susceptible to background radiation,\nincreasing the concern about failures produced by soft errors. The resilience\nof deep neural networks (DNNs) to these errors depends not only on target\ndevice technology but also on model structure and the numerical representation\nand arithmetic precision of their parameters. Compression techniques like\npruning and quantization, used to reduce memory footprint and computational\ncomplexity, alter both model structure and representation, affecting soft error\nrobustness.

    "abstract": "Road ponding presents a significant threat to vehicle safety, particularly in\nadverse fog conditions, where reliable detection remains a persistent challenge\nfor Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS). To address this, we propose\nABCDWaveNet, a novel deep learning framework leveraging Dynamic\nFrequency-Spatial Synergy for robust ponding detection in fog. The core of\nABCDWaveNet achieves this synergy by integrating dynamic convolution for\nadaptive feature extraction across varying visibilities with a wavelet-based\nmodule for synergistic frequency-spatial feature enhancement, significantly\nimproving robustness against fog interference. Building on this foundation,\nABCDWaveNet captures multi-scale structural and contextual information,\nsubsequently employing an Adaptive Attention Coupling Gate (AACG) to adaptively\nfuse global and local features for enhanced accuracy. To facilitate realistic\nevaluations under combined adverse conditions, we introduce the Foggy Low-Light\nPuddle dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ABCDWaveNet establishes\nnew state-of-the-art performance, achieving significant Intersection over Union\n(IoU) gains of 3.51%, 1.75%, and 1.03% on the Foggy-Puddle, Puddle-1000, and\nour Foggy Low-Light Puddle datasets, respectively. Furthermore, its processing\nspeed of 25.48 FPS on an NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin confirms its suitability for\nADAS deployment.

First, we exploit the\nproperty that mixed-integer solutions are primarily interior points that can be\nmodeled as weighted analytic centers with unique weights. We then demonstrate\nthat the optimality of a given solution can be measured relative to an\nidentifiable optimal solution to the linear programming relaxation. We quantify\nthe absolute optimality gap and pose the inverse mixed-integer optimization\nproblem as a bi-level program where the upper-level objective minimizes the\nnorm to a given reference cost, while the lower-level objective minimizes the\nabsolute optimality gap to an optimal linear programming solution. We provide\ntwo models that address the discrepancies between the upper and lower-level\nproblems, establish links with noisy and data-driven optimization, and conduct\nextensive numerical testing.

Specifically, we describe two methods to morph\nshortest-path triangulations of the sphere by moving their vertices along\nlongitudes into the southern hemisphere; we call a triangulation sinkable if\nsuch a morph exists. Our first method generalizes a longitudinal shelling\nconstruction of Awartani and Henderson; a triangulation is sinkable if a\nspecific orientation of its dual graph is acyclic. We describe a simple\npolynomial-time algorithm to find a longitudinally shellable rotation of a\ngiven spherical triangulation, if one exists; we also construct a spherical\ntriangulation that has no longitudinally shellable rotation. Our second method\nis based on a linear-programming characterization of sinkability. By\nidentifying its optimal basis, we show that this linear program can be solved\nin $O(n^{\\omega/2})$ time, where $\\omega$ is the matrix-multiplication\nexponent, assuming the underlying linear system is non-singular.

Our approach centers on three key innovations. First, we\ndevelop an observer framework that allows a smaller model to replicate and\nlearn the state dynamics of the RWKV-7 model. Second, we employ a kernel method\nto dynamically upscale the state size, enhancing the model's capacity to\ncapture intricate patterns. Third, we integrate Decorrelated Backpropagation\n(DBP) to optimize the upscaled state matrix, thereby improving convergence and\nexpressivity. By tuning only the state matrix, we demonstrate that a smaller\nmodel can outperform larger models on the given task. This method preserves the\nefficiency of the original RWKV-7 architecture while harnessing the power of\ntest-time scaling to deliver superior results.

We perform a linear analysis of\nthe two-fluid equations on a background pressure bump, representing annular\nsubstructures. The spectral code \\textsc{Dedalus} is used to solve the linear\neigenvalue problem. We identify two distinct DRWI modes: Type I, which\noriginates from dust-modified gas RWI, and Type II, which results from dust-gas\ncoupling. These modes never coexist for a given azimuthal wavenumber $\\ky$, but\ntransition between each other as $\\ky$ varies. Type I modes are driven by the\nadvection of background vorticity, whereas Type II modes involve two primary\nwaves: Rossby waves, driven by advection, and thin waves, driven by dust-gas\ndrag. Finally, we assess the relevance of DRWI in ALMA rings using DSHARP\nsources. Our findings suggest that Type I modes could explain the absence of\nazimuthal asymmetries in many ALMA disks, whereas Type II modes are entirely\nabsent in all eight observed rings, implying that unresolved narrow rings or\nalternative mechanisms may play a role in dust growth within annular\nsubstructures.",

    "abstract": "Blockchain systems, such as Ethereum, are increasingly adopting layer-2\nscaling solutions to improve transaction throughput and reduce fees. One\npopular layer-2 approach is the Optimistic Rollup, which relies on a mechanism\nknown as a dispute game for block proposals. In these systems, validators can\nchallenge blocks that they believe contain errors, and a successful challenge\nresults in the transfer of a portion of the proposer's deposit as a reward. In\nthis paper, we reveal a structural vulnerability in the mechanism: validators\nmay not be awarded a proper profit despite winning a dispute challenge. We\ndevelop a formal game-theoretic model of the dispute game and analyze several\nscenarios, including cases where the proposer controls some validators and\ncases where a secondary auction mechanism is deployed to induce additional\nparticipation. Our analysis demonstrates that under current designs, the\ncompetitive pressure from validators may be insufficient to deter malicious\nbehavior. We find that increased validator competition, paradoxically driven by\nhigher rewards or participation, can allow a malicious proposer to\nsignificantly lower their net loss by capturing value through mechanisms like\nauctions. To address this, we propose countermeasures such as an escrowed\nreward mechanism and a commit-reveal protocol.

    "abstract": "Estimating the cure fraction in a diseased population, especially in the\npresence of competing mortality causes, is crucial for both patients and\nclinicians. It offers a valuable measure for monitoring and interpreting trends\nin disease outcomes. When information on the cause of death is unavailable or\nunreliable, the Relative Survival (RS) framework is the preferred approach for\nestimating Net Survival, which represents survival in a hypothetical scenario\nwhere the disease of interest is the only possible cause of death. In the\ncontext of cancer, RS often reaches a plateau, indicating that a portion of\ndiagnosed patients is cured, as they have the same risk of dying as a\ncomparable group of healthy individuals with similar demographic\ncharacteristics. Classical RS cure models use logistic regression to estimate\nthe fraction of cured patients. However, this functional form is somewhat\narbitrary, and misspecifying it can severely distort the resulting cure\nindicators. Consequently, evaluations of the efficacy of cancer treatments at\nthe population level could be inaccurate, leading to biased decision-making\nregarding patient care. In this paper, we address this issue by relaxing the\nparametric assumption and considering flexible functions of the covariates\nwithin the framework of \\textit{Generalized Models} and \\textit{Neural\nNetworks}. We design an EM algorithm for these RS cure models and conduct a\nsimulation study to compare our proposals with the classical approach. We apply\nour methodology to a real-world dataset from a historical Italian cancer\nregistry. The results demonstrate that our proposed models outperform the\nclassical approach and provide valuable insights into the survival outcomes of\nItalian colon cancer patients.",

This variability frequently\nmanifests as intense flaring events, sparking an ongoing debate in recent\nliterature about whether these flares exhibit periodic behavior in certain\nsources. However, many blazars also show clear signs of stochastic,\nuncorrelated flares that do not follow a regular pattern. This paper explores\nhow the presence of one such of these stochastic flares can distort an\nintrinsically periodic pattern of emission in blazars. Our results demonstrate\nthat, depending on the specific circumstances, the deviations in significance\nand periods can exceed 100\\%. Sometimes, these deviations can be so severe that\nthey eliminate any evidence of a periodic pattern. These findings highlight the\ndramatic impact that flares can have on periodicity searches. To confront this\nchallenge, we propose an innovative approach, the Singular Spectrum Analysis\nmethod, which appears more robust against the effects of flares. As an\nalternative solution, we also propose the sigma clipping technique to mitigate\nthe impact of flares. This framework offers a valuable foundation for analyzing\nperiodicity in similar astrophysical sources that are also subject to\nstochastic flaring events.",

The rationale for employing the concept of radial epiderivatives is\nthat they provide necessary and sufficient conditions for both identifying\nglobal descent directions and achieving global minimum of nonconvex and\nnondifferentiable functions. These properties of radial epiderivatives are\ncombined with line search methods to develop iterative solution algorithms. The\nproposed methods generate search directions at each iteration where global\ndescent directions and stopping criteria are performed by using the abilities\nof the radial epiderivatives. We use two line search methods, that is cyclic\ncoordinate and particle swarm optimization techniques to generate search\ndirections, selecting only those that exhibit descent, as determined by using\napproximately computed radial epiderivatives at the current point. As a\nparticular case, these methods are applied for minimizing concave functions. In\nthe paper, two convergence theorems are proved. One of them deals with the\ngeneral line search method and covers only the set of directions generated by\nthe method. The second convergence theorem deals with minimizing concave\nfunctions which deals not only with the generated set of directions but covers\nthe whole set of feasible solutions. The performance of the proposed method is\nevaluated by using well-known benchmark problems from the literature.

To enhance generalization, GPT-based semantic augmentation\ngenerates diverse paraphrases of training commands, labeled with the same\nmotion trajectory. DLM further incorporates a diffusion policy-based trajectory\ngeneration for adaptive motion refinement and stochastic sampling. In contrast\nto LLM-based methods, DLM ensures consistent, predictable motion without\nextensive prompt engineering, facilitating real-time robotic guidance. As DLM\nlearns from trajectory data, it is embodiment-agnostic, enabling deployment\nacross diverse robotic platforms. Experimental results demonstrate DLM's\nimproved command generalization, reduced dependence on structured phrasing, and\nachievement of human-like motion.",

    "abstract": "Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars (FSRQs) are weak sources of very high energy\n(VHE; E>100 GeV) emission, despite exhibiting strong MeV-GeV emissions that\ndominate their radiative output. To date, only ten FSRQs have been detected at\nVHEs, primarily during bright optical phases. In this study, we perform a\ndetailed and systematic, temporal, and spectral analysis of the nine\nVHE-detected FSRQs, using the Swift X-ray Telescope (XRT) data. Our findings\nshow no correlation between VHE activity and the X-ray flux or spectral state\nof the sources. However, investigation of spectral properties with X-ray\nbrightness shows anti-correlation between flux and spectral index. The X-ray,\ngenerally with a different spectral shape lies at the farther end of the\noptical-UV synchrotron spectrum which typically shows a declining power-law\nspectrum, and thus, the X-ray spectrum is generally explained by Synchrotron\nSelf-Compton (SSC) process. However, if optical-UV synchrotron emission extends\ninto the X-ray band, it can soften the X-ray spectrum. While most sources in\nour sample exhibit rising X-ray SEDs, indicative of non-synchrotron origins or\nminimal synchrotron contributions, many display softer or flat X-ray spectra,\nmainly during low X-ray flux states (e.g., 4C +21.35, 3C 279, TON 0599, PKS\n1441+25, and PKS 0346-27) suggesting potential synchrotron contributions. These\nsynchrotron continuations influence the gamma-ray spectrum, implying extension\ninto the VHE range for inverse Compton (IC) scattering in the Thomson\nscattering limit. If the extended component corresponds to an underlying\nlow-level emission, these FSRQs could represent potential candidates for\npersistent VHE activity.",

Through extensive\nexperiments involving 16 state-of-the-art LLMs and nine diverse pattern-based\nin-context learning (ICL) datasets, we demonstrate that CoT and its reasoning\nvariants consistently underperform direct answering across varying model scales\nand benchmark complexities. To systematically investigate this unexpected\nphenomenon, we designed extensive experiments to validate several hypothetical\nexplanations. Our analysis uncovers a fundamental explicit-implicit duality\ndriving CoT's performance in pattern-based ICL: while explicit reasoning\nfalters due to LLMs' struggles to infer underlying patterns from\ndemonstrations, implicit reasoning-disrupted by the increased contextual\ndistance of CoT rationales-often compensates, delivering correct answers\ndespite flawed rationales. This duality explains CoT's relative\nunderperformance, as noise from weak explicit inference undermines the process,\neven as implicit mechanisms partially salvage outcomes. Notably, even long-CoT\nreasoning models, which excel in abstract and symbolic reasoning, fail to fully\novercome these limitations despite higher computational costs.

While\nconsumer hardware is getting stronger and model quantization is improving,\nexisting end-side solutions still demand GPU clusters, large RAM/VRAM, and high\nbandwidth, far beyond what a common home cluster can handle. This paper\nintroduces prima.cpp, a distributed inference system that runs 70B-scale models\non everyday home devices using a mix of CPU/GPU, low RAM/VRAM, Wi-Fi, and\ncross-platform support. It uses mmap to manage model weights and introduces\npiped-ring parallelism with prefetching to hide disk loading. By modeling\nheterogeneity in computation, communication, disk, memory (and its management\nbehavior), and OS, it optimally assigns model layers to each device's CPU and\nGPU, further reducing token latency.

To confront\nthis, we analyze the key properties required for interaction modeling and\npropose a robust NR-IQA approach termed CoDI-IQA (Content-Distortion high-order\nInteraction for NR-IQA), which aggregates local distortion and global content\nfeatures within a hierarchical interaction framework.

By integrating internal interaction, coarse interaction, and fine\ninteraction, it achieves high-order interaction modeling that allows the model\nto properly represent the underlying interaction patterns. To ensure sufficient\ninteraction, multiple PPIMs are employed to hierarchically fuse multi-level\ncontent and distortion features at different granularities. We also tailor a\ntraining strategy suited for CoDI-IQA to maintain interaction stability.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method notably outperforms\nthe state-of-the-art methods in terms of prediction accuracy, data efficiency,\nand generalization ability.",

The current\nthreshold-based methods apply one-dimensional static mechanisms with single\ncriterion. As a result, their IR decisions might be irrelevant to the LLMs'\nresponse under difficult queries. To alleviate this problem, we propose\nCognitive Convection of Self-Knowledge (CCSK).

    "abstract": "Designing high-performance electric machines that maintain their efficiency\nand reliability under uncertain material and operating conditions is crucial\nfor industrial applications. In this paper, we present a novel framework for\nrobust topology optimization with partial differential equation constraints to\naddress this challenge. The robust optimization problem is formulated as a\nmin-max optimization problem, where the inner maximization is the worst case\nwith respect to predefined uncertainties, while the outer minimization aims to\nfind an optimal topology that remains robust under these uncertainties using\nthe topological derivative. The shape of the domain is represented by a level\nset function, which allows for arbitrary perturbation of the domain. The robust\noptimization problem is solved using a theorem of Clarke to compute\nsubgradients of the worst case function. This allows the min-max problem to be\nsolved efficiently and ensures that we find a design that performs well even in\nthe presence of uncertainty. Finally, numerical results for a two-material\npermanent magnet synchronous machine demonstrate both the effectiveness of the\nmethod and the improved performance of robust designs under uncertain\nconditions.",

    "abstract": "Provisioning secrecy for all users, given the heterogeneity in their channel\nconditions, locations, and the unknown location of the attacker/eavesdropper,\nis challenging and not always feasible. The problem is even more difficult\nunder finite blocklength constraints that are popular in ultra-reliable\nlow-latency communication (URLLC) and massive machine-type communications\n(mMTC). This work takes the first step to guarantee secrecy for all URLLC/mMTC\nusers in the finite blocklength regime (FBR) where intelligent reflecting\nsurfaces (IRS) are used to enhance legitimate users' reception and thwart the\npotential eavesdropper (Eve) from intercepting. To that end, we aim to maximize\nthe minimum secrecy rate (SR) among all users by jointly optimizing the\ntransmitter's beamforming and IRS's passive reflective elements (PREs) under\nthe FBR latency constraints. The resulting optimization problem is non-convex\nand even more complicated under imperfect channel state information (CSI). To\ntackle it, we linearize the objective function, and decompose the problem into\nsequential subproblems. When perfect CSI is not available, we use the\nsuccessive convex approximation (SCA) approach to transform imperfect\nCSI-related semi-infinite constraints into finite linear matrix inequalities\n(LMI). We prove that our proposed algorithm converges to a locally optimal\nsolution with low computational complexity thanks to our closed-form\nlinearization approach. This makes the solution scalable for large IRS\ndeployments. Extensive simulations with practical settings show that our\napproach can ensure secure communication for all users while satisfying FBR\nconstraints even with only imperfect CSI.",

Due to the\nheterogeneity and nonlocality, the linear Fourier analysis gives rise to\n\\textit{strongly coupled} infinite differential systems. By introducing\nsuitable changes of basis as well as the Gershgorin disks theorem for infinite\nmatrices, we first show that all $N$-th Gershgorin disks lie completely on the\nleft half-plane for sufficiently large $N$. For the remaining finitely many\ndisks, a computer-assisted proof shows that if the intensity $\\delta$ of the\nnonlocal term is large enough, there is precisely one eigenvalue with positive\nreal part, which proves the Turing instability. Moreover, by detailed study of\nthis eigenvalue as a function of $\\delta$, we obtain a sharp threshold\n$\\delta^*$ which is the bifurcation point for Turing instability.",

One can extend this definition to negative integers by letting the\n$(-n)$-truncation be the matroid whose bases are all the sets that can be\nobtained by deleting $n$ elements of a base of $M$. If $M$ has infinite rank,\nthen for distinct ${m,n \\in \\mathbb{Z}}$ the $m$-truncation and the\n$n$-truncation are distinct matroids.\n  Inspired by the work of Bowler and Geschke on infinite uniform matroids, we\nprovide a natural definition of generalised truncations that encompasses the\nnotions mentioned above. We call a generalised truncation wild if it is not an\n$n$-truncation for any ${n \\in \\mathbb{Z}}$ and we prove that, under Martin's\nAxiom, any finitary matroid of infinite rank and size of less than continuum\nadmits ${2^{2^{\\aleph_0}}}$ wild generalised truncations.",

Our result enables\nthe extension of every certificate for the almost-sure satisfaction of\nshift-invariant specifications to its quantitative counterpart, ensuring\ncompleteness up to an approximation in the general case and exactness in the\nfinite-state case. This generalises and unifies existing supermartingale\ncertificates for quantitative verification and control under reachability,\nsafety, reach-avoidance, and stability specifications, as well as asymptotic\nbounds on accrued costs and rewards. Furthermore, our result provides the first\nsupermartingale certificate for computing upper and lower bounds on the\nprobability of satisfying $\\omega$-regular and linear temporal logic\nspecifications. We present an algorithm for quantitative $\\omega$-regular\nverification and control synthesis based on our method and demonstrate its\npractical efficacy on several infinite-state examples.",

Existing\nchange detection methods primarily focus on achieving higher accuracy with\nincreased computational costs and parameter sizes, leaving development of\nlightweight methods for rapid real-world processing an underexplored challenge.\nTo address this challenge, we propose a Lightweight Difference Guiding Network\n(LDGNet), leveraging absolute difference image to guide optical remote sensing\nchange detection. First, to enhance the feature representation capability of\nthe lightweight backbone network, we propose the Difference Guiding Module\n(DGM), which leverages multi-scale features extracted from the absolute\ndifference image to progressively influence the original image encoder at each\nlayer, thereby reinforcing feature extraction. Second, we propose the\nDifference-Aware Dynamic Fusion (DADF) module with Visual State Space Model\n(VSSM) for lightweight long-range dependency modeling. The module first uses\nfeature absolute differences to guide VSSM's global contextual modeling of\nchange regions, then employs difference attention to dynamically fuse these\nlong-range features with feature differences, enhancing change semantics while\nsuppressing noise and background. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets\ndemonstrate that our method achieves comparable or superior performance to\ncurrent state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods requiring several times more\ncomputation, while maintaining only 3.43M parameters and 1.12G FLOPs.",

    "abstract": "Turbulence is a fundamental flow phenomenon, typically anisotropic at large\nscales and approximately isotropic at small scales. The classical Kolmogorov\nscaling laws (2/3, -5/3 and 4/5) have been well-established for turbulence\nwithout small-scale body forcing, describing second-order velocity structure\nfunctions, energy spectra, and third-order velocity structure functions in an\nintermediate small-scale range. However, their validity boundary remains\nunclear. Here, we identify new 1 and -2 scaling laws (replacing 2/3 and -5/3\nlaws) alongside the unchanged 4/5 law in the core region of boundary-driven\nturbulence, where energy is injected solely through viscous friction at moving\nboundaries. Local isotropy is recovered after high-pass filtering. Notably,\nodd-order velocity structure functions with and without absolute value exhibit\ndistinct scaling exponents. A characteristic speed in the inertial range,\nderived from the constant ratio of third- to second-order structure functions,\nquantifies the time-averaged projectile speed at the bulk interface. Based on\nenergy dissipation rate and the characteristic speed, a phenomenological\nframework for structure functions is developed together with a model for\nprobability distributions of velocity increment at distinct small-scales. The\nuniversal scaling laws formulated can produce the full set of scaling exponents\nfor low- and high-order velocity structure functions, including both the\nodd-orders' with and without absolute value, which are validated by direct\nnumerical simulations and experimental datasets.",

We introduce a Maneuver-Intention-Aware Transformer\n(MIAT) architecture, which integrates a maneuver intention awareness control\nmechanism with spatiotemporal interaction modeling to enhance long-horizon\ntrajectory predictions.

    "abstract": "Machine unlearning is concerned with the task of removing knowledge learned\nfrom particular data points from a trained model. In the context of large\nlanguage models (LLMs), unlearning has recently received increased attention,\nparticularly for removing knowledge about named entities from models for\nprivacy purposes. While various approaches have been proposed to address the\nunlearning problem, most existing approaches treat all data points to be\nunlearned equally, i.e., unlearning that Montreal is a city in Canada is\ntreated exactly the same as unlearning the phone number of the first author of\nthis paper. In this work, we show that this all data is equal assumption does\nnot hold for LLM unlearning. We study how the success of unlearning depends on\nthe frequency of the knowledge we want to unlearn in the pre-training data of a\nmodel and find that frequency strongly affects unlearning, i.e., more frequent\nknowledge is harder to unlearn. Additionally, we uncover a misalignment between\nprobability and generation-based evaluations of unlearning and show that this\nproblem worsens as models become larger. Overall, our experiments highlight the\nneed for better evaluation practices and novel methods for LLM unlearning that\ntake the training data of models into account.",

    "abstract": "Exoplanets play an important role in understanding the mechanics of planetary\nsystem formation and orbital evolution. In this context the correlations of\ndifferent parameters of the planets and their host star are useful guides in\nthe search for explanatory mechanisms. Based on a reanalysis of the data set\nfrom \\cite{figueria14} we study the as of now still poorly understood\ncorrelation between planetary surface gravity and stellar activity of Hot\nJupiters. Unfortunately, data collection often suffers from measurement errors\ndue to complicated and indirect measurement setups, rendering standard\ninference techniques unreliable.\n  We present new methods to estimate and test for correlations in a\ndeconvolution framework and thereby improve the state of the art analysis of\nthe data in two directions. First, we are now able to account for additive\nmeasurement errors which facilitates reliable inference. Second we test for\nrelevant changes, i.e. we are testing for correlations exceeding a certain\nthreshold $\\Delta$. This reflects the fact that small nonzero correlations are\nto be expected for real life data almost always and that standard statistical\ntests will therefore always reject the null of no correlation given sufficient\ndata. Our theory focuses on quantities that can be estimated by U-Statistics\nwhich contain a variety of correlation measures. We propose a bootstrap test\nand establish its theoretical validity. As a by product we also obtain\nconfidence intervals. Applying our methods to the Hot Jupiter data set from\n\\cite{figueria14}, we observe that taking into account the measurement errors\nyields smaller point estimates and the null of no relevant correlation is\nrejected only for very small $\\Delta$. This demonstrates the importance of\nconsidering the impact of measurement errors to avoid misleading conclusions\nfrom the resulting statistical analysis.",

Here, we integrate space-based\nsolar power (SBSP) -- a potential near-constant, orbital solar technology --\ninto a high-resolution, Europe-wide capacity-expansion and dispatch model to\nquantify its contribution under net-zero constraints. We examine two advanced\nSBSP designs: (1) a near-baseload, low Technology Readiness Level (TRL) concept\n(heliostat-based Representative Design RD1) and (2) a partially intermittent,\nhigher-TRL concept (planar-based RD2), both drawing on NASA's 2050 cost and\nperformance projections. Our results show that RD1 can reduce total system\ncosts by 7--15%, displace up to 80% of intermittent wind and solar, and cut\nbattery usage by over 70%, if it meets its forecast cost reductions -- though\nlong-duration storage (e.g., hydrogen) remains essential for seasonal\nbalancing. By contrast, RD2 is economically unattractive at its projected 2050\ncosts. Through extensive sensitivity analyses, we identify cost thresholds at\nwhich SBSP shifts from cost-prohibitive to complementary and ultimately to a\ndominant baseload technology. Specifically, RD1 becomes complementary at\nroughly 14x and dominant at 9x the 2050 solar PV capital cost, benefiting from\nits continuous power generation. Meanwhile, RD2 must achieve even lower cost\nlevels (9x to be complementary and 6x to dominate) and would rely on\nshort-duration storage to mitigate its partial intermittency. These findings\nprovide quantified techno-economic benchmarks and reveal alternative net-zero\npathways, offering critical guidance for policymakers and industry stakeholders\nseeking large-scale, centrally coordinated renewable solutions with non- or\nlow-intermittency.",

This work takes\nthe first step to guarantee secrecy for all users where a low resolution\nintelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS) is used to enhance legitimate users'\nreception and thwart the potential eavesdropper (Eve) from intercepting. In\nreal-life scenarios, due to hardware limitations of the IRS' passive reflective\nelements (PREs), the use of a full-resolution (continuous) phase shift (CPS) is\nimpractical. In this paper, we thus consider a more practical case where the\nphase shift (PS) is modeled by a low-resolution (quantized) phase shift (QPS)\nwhile addressing the phase shift error (PSE) induced by the imperfect channel\nstate information (CSI). To that end, we aim to maximize the minimum secrecy\nrate (SR) among all users by jointly optimizing the transmitter's beamforming\nvector and the IRS's passive reflective elements (PREs) under\nperfect/imperfect/unknown CSI. The resulting optimization problem is non-convex\nand even more complicated under imperfect/unknown CSI. The resulting\noptimization problem is non-convex and even more complicated under\nimperfect/unknown CSI. To tackle it, we linearize the objective function and\ndecompose the problem into sequential subproblems. When the perfect CSI is not\navailable, we use the successive convex approximation (SCA) approach to\ntransform imperfect CSI related semi-infinite constraints into finite linear\nmatrix inequalities (LMI). We prove that our proposed algorithm converges to a\nlocally optimal solution with low computational complexity. Extensive\nsimulations with practical settings show that our approach can ensure secure\ncommunication for all users while the IRS's PREs are quantized and are affected\nby the PSE.",

As a result, downstream\ntasks such as driving virtual human in 3D scene or humanoid robots in real\nworld suffer from issues such as timing drift and jitter, spatial problems like\nsliding and penetration, and poor global trajectory accuracy. In this paper, we\nrevisit human MoCap from the perspective of interaction between human body and\nphysical world by exploring the role of pressure. Firstly, we construct a\nlarge-scale human Motion capture dataset with Pressure, RGB and Optical sensors\n(named MotionPRO), which comprises 70 volunteers performing 400 types of\nmotion, encompassing a total of 12.4M pose frames. Secondly, we examine both\nthe necessity and effectiveness of the pressure signal through two challenging\ntasks: (1) pose and trajectory estimation based solely on pressure: We propose\na network that incorporates a small kernel decoder and a long-short-term\nattention module, and proof that pressure could provide accurate global\ntrajectory and plausible lower body pose. (2) pose and trajectory estimation by\nfusing pressure and RGB: We impose constraints on orthographic similarity along\nthe camera axis and whole-body contact along the vertical axis to enhance the\ncross-attention strategy to fuse pressure and RGB feature maps. Experiments\ndemonstrate that fusing pressure with RGB features not only significantly\nimproves performance in terms of objective metrics, but also plausibly drives\nvirtual humans (SMPL) in 3D scene. Furthermore, we demonstrate that\nincorporating physical perception enables humanoid robots to perform more\nprecise and stable actions, which is highly beneficial for the development of\nembodied artificial intelligence.

Concept Extraction (CE) methods\noffer such explanations, but have mostly been developed for the image domain so\nfar, leaving a gap in the time series domain. In this work, we present a CE and\nlocalization method tailored to the time series domain, based on the ideas of\nCE methods for images. We propose the novel method ECLAD-ts, which provides\npost-hoc global explanations based on how the models encode subsets of the\ninput at different levels of abstraction. For this, concepts are produced by\nclustering timestep-wise aggregations of CNN activation maps, and their\nimportance is computed based on their impact on the prediction process. We\nevaluate our method on synthetic and natural datasets. Furthermore, we assess\nthe advantages and limitations of CE in time series through empirical results.\nOur results show that ECLAD-ts effectively explains models by leveraging their\ninternal representations, providing useful insights about their prediction\nprocess.",

Fermionic chains with\nextended nearest neighbor couplings have been observed to show unique\ntopological transition at the multicritical points between distinct gapless\nphases. In this work, we show that such topological gapless phases and the\ntransition between them can be simulated in a quantum walk. We consider a\nthree-step discrete-time quantum walk and identify various critical or gapless\nphases and multicriticalities from the topological phase diagram along with\ntheir distinguished energy dispersions. We reconstruct the scaling theory based\non the curvature function to study transition between gapless phases in the\nquantum walk. We show the interesting features observed in fermionic chains,\nsuch as diverging, sign flipping and swapping properties of curvature function,\ncan be simulated in the quantum walk. Moreover, the renormalization group flow\nand Wannier state correlation functions also identify transition at the\nmulticritical points between gapless phases. We observe the scaling law and\noverlapping of critical and fixed point properties at the multicritical points\nof the fermionic chains can also be observed in the quantum walk. Furthermore,\nwe categorize the topological transitions at various multicritical points using\nthe group velocity of the energy eigenstates. Finally, the topological\ncharacters of various gapless phases are captured using winding number which\nallows one to distinguish various gapless phases and also show the transitions\nat the multicritical points.",

    "abstract": "Natural language processing models often face challenges due to limited\nlabeled data, especially in domain specific areas, e.g., clinical trials. To\novercome this, text augmentation techniques are commonly used to increases\nsample size by transforming the original input data into artificial ones with\nthe label preserved. However, traditional text classification methods ignores\nthe relationship between augmented texts and treats them as independent samples\nwhich may introduce classification error. Therefore, we propose a novel\napproach called 'Batch Aggregation' (BAGG) which explicitly models the\ndependence of text inputs generated through augmentation by incorporating an\nadditional layer that aggregates results from correlated texts. Through\nstudying multiple benchmark data sets across different domains, we found that\nBAGG can improve classification accuracy. We also found that the increase of\nperformance with BAGG is more obvious in domain specific data sets, with\naccuracy improvements of up to 10-29%.

Whereas EMF exposure triggers significant public concern\ndue to its potential health implications, making it crucial to address when\ndeploying BS in densely populated areas. To this end, this paper addresses\nminimizing average EMF exposure while maintaining coverage in a 3D urban\nscenario by jointly optimizing BS deployment and power. To address this,\nfirstly, accurate EMF prediction is essential, as traditional empirical models\nlack the required accuracy, necessitating a deterministic channel model. A\nnovel least-time shoot-and-bounce ray (SBR) ray-launching (RL) algorithm is\ntherefore developed to overcome several limitations of current simulators and\nis validated with real-world measurements. Secondly, to further reduce\ncomputational complexity, unlike using a fixed grid size to discretize the\ntarget area, the adaptive grid refinement (AGR) algorithm is designed with a\nflexible grid to predict the overall EMF exposure. Finally, based on the EMF\nexposure predictions, the Nelder-Mead (NM) method is used in the joint\noptimization, and urban user equipment (UE) distributions are incorporated to\nbetter reflect real-world conditions. When evaluating the benefits of the whole\nprocess, the results are compared against using empirical channel models,\nrevealing notable differences and underestimation of EMF exposure that\nhighlight the importance of considering real-world scenario.",

In this work, we experimentally demonstrate a\ntransmission-based RF-SET using a multi-module semiconductor-superconductor\nassembly. A monolithically integrated SET placed next to a double quantum dot\nin a Si/SiGe heterostructure is wire-bonded to a superconducting niobium\ninductor forming the impedance-transforming network. Compared to RF\nreflectometry, the proposed set-up is experimentally simpler without the need\nfor directional couplers. Read-out performance is benchmarked by the\nsignal-to-noise (SNR) of a dot-reservoir transition (DRT) and an interdot\ncharge transition (ICT) in the double quantum dot near the SET as a function of\nRF power and integration time. The minimum integration time for unitary SNR is\nfound to be 100 ns for ICT and 300 ns for DRT. The obtained minimum integration\ntimes are comparable to the state of the art in conventional RF reflectometry\nset-ups. Furthermore, we study the turn-on properties of the RF-SET to\ninvestigate capacitive shifts and RF losses. Understanding these effects are\ncrucial for further optimisations of the impedance transforming network as well\nas the device design to assist RF read-out.

The findings of the survey\ndemonstrate important insights, reflecting upon the importance of: LLMs\nadoption for non-English speakers; the degree of misinformation, domain and\nstyle adaptation; usability and key features of LLMs. These insights can guide\nfurther development, benefiting both writers and a broader user base.",

    "abstract": "AI Impact Assessments are only as good as the measures used to assess the\nimpact of these systems. It is therefore paramount that we can justify our\nchoice of metrics in these assessments, especially for difficult to quantify\nethical and social values. We present a two-step approach to ensure metrics are\nproperly motivated. First, a conception needs to be spelled out (e.g. Rawlsian\nfairness or fairness as solidarity) and then a metric can be fitted to that\nconception. Both steps require separate justifications, as conceptions can be\njudged on how well they fit with the function of, for example, fairness. We\nargue that conceptual engineering offers helpful tools for this step. Second,\nmetrics need to be fitted to a conception. We illustrate this process through\nan examination of competing fairness metrics to illustrate that here the\nadditional content that a conception offers helps us justify the choice for a\nspecific metric. We thus advocate that impact assessments are not only clear on\ntheir metrics, but also on the conceptions that motivate those metrics.",

    "abstract": "Smart contracts deployed on blockchain platforms are vulnerable to various\nsecurity vulnerabilities. However, only a small number of Ethereum contracts\nhave released their source code, so vulnerability detection at the bytecode\nlevel is crucial. This paper introduces SmartBugBert, a novel approach that\ncombines BERT-based deep learning with control flow graph (CFG) analysis to\ndetect vulnerabilities directly from bytecode. Our method first decompiles\nsmart contract bytecode into optimized opcode sequences, extracts semantic\nfeatures using TF-IDF, constructs control flow graphs to capture execution\nlogic, and isolates vulnerable CFG fragments for targeted analysis. By\nintegrating both semantic and structural information through a fine-tuned BERT\nmodel and LightGBM classifier, our approach effectively identifies four\ncritical vulnerability types: transaction-ordering, access control,\nself-destruct, and timestamp dependency vulnerabilities. Experimental\nevaluation on 6,157 Ethereum smart contracts demonstrates that SmartBugBert\nachieves 90.62% precision, 91.76% recall, and 91.19% F1-score, significantly\noutperforming existing detection methods. Ablation studies confirm that the\ncombination of semantic features with CFG information substantially enhances\ndetection performance.

In this\nwork, we calculate the thermodynamic potential and quasinormal modes (QNMs) of\nRN-AdS black holes, and identify transition curves between two different states\nin supercritical region using thermodynamic and dynamic methods. On one hand,\nwe find the thermodynamic crossover curve (Widom line) by defining the scaled\nvariance $\\Omega$ (a higher-order derivative of Gibbs free energy). On the\nother hand, we identify the dynamic crossover curve (Frenkel line) by analyzing\ntransitions between distinct QNM decay modes.",

In this paper, we propose a novel\nframework called ValueExploration, which aims to explore the behavior-driven\nmechanisms of National Social Values within LLMs at the neuron level. As a case\nstudy, we focus on Chinese Social Values and first construct C-voice, a\nlarge-scale bilingual benchmark for identifying and evaluating Chinese Social\nValues in LLMs. By leveraging C-voice, we then identify and locate the neurons\nresponsible for encoding these values according to activation difference.\nFinally, by deactivating these neurons, we analyze shifts in model behavior,\nuncovering the internal mechanism by which values influence LLM\ndecision-making. Extensive experiments on four representative LLMs validate the\nefficacy of our framework. The benchmark and code will be available.",

However, existing remote sensing VLMs typically rely\non closed-set scene understanding and focus on generic scene descriptions, yet\nlack the ability to incorporate external knowledge. This limitation hinders\ntheir capacity for semantic reasoning over complex or context-dependent queries\nthat involve domain-specific or world knowledge. To address these challenges,\nwe first introduced a multimodal Remote Sensing World Knowledge (RSWK) dataset,\nwhich comprises high-resolution satellite imagery and detailed textual\ndescriptions for 14,141 well-known landmarks from 175 countries, integrating\nboth remote sensing domain knowledge and broader world knowledge. Building upon\nthis dataset, we proposed a novel Remote Sensing Retrieval-Augmented Generation\n(RS-RAG) framework, which consists of two key components. The Multi-Modal\nKnowledge Vector Database Construction module encodes remote sensing imagery\nand associated textual knowledge into a unified vector space. The Knowledge\nRetrieval and Response Generation module retrieves and re-ranks relevant\nknowledge based on image and/or text queries, and incorporates the retrieved\ncontent into a knowledge-augmented prompt to guide the VLM in producing\ncontextually grounded responses.

    "abstract": "The concepts of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and multi-agent systems\nare two important areas of research in artificial intelligence (AI). In this\npaper, we present an approach that builds a CNN-based colony of AI agents to\nserve as a single system and perform multiple tasks (e.g., predictions or\nclassifications) in an environment. The proposed system impersonates the\nnatural environment of a biological system, like an ant colony or a human\ncolony. The proposed colony of AI that is defined as a role-based system\nuniquely contributes to accomplish tasks in an environment by incorporating AI\nagents that are fast learners, detailed learners, and organized learners. These\nlearners can enhance their localized learning and their collective decisions as\na single system of colony of AI agents. This approach also enhances the\ndiversity and quality of the colony of AI with the help of Genetic Algorithms\nand their crossover and mutation mechanisms. The evolution of fast, detailed,\nand organized learners in the colony of AI is achieved by introducing a unique\none-to-one mapping between these learners and the pretrained VGG16, VGG19, and\nResNet50 models, respectively. This role-based approach creates two parent-AI\nagents using the AI models through the processes, called the intra- and\ninter-marriage of AI, so that they can share their learned knowledge (weights\nand biases) based on a probabilistic rule and produce diversified child-AI\nagents to perform new tasks. This process will form a colony of AI that\nconsists of families of multi-model and mixture-model AI agents to improve\ndiversity and quality. Simulations show that the colony of AI, built using the\nVGG16, VGG19, and ResNet50 models, can provide a single system that generates\nchild-AI agents of excellent predictive performance, ranging between 82% and\n95% of F1-scores, to make diversified collective and quality decisions on a\ntask.",

This provides, for the first time, an analytic model of\nlateral spread without any fitting parameters. The model is derived directly\nfrom the governing equations; in order to obtain a simple model, a rigid\nperfectly plastic material is assumed and simplified with the assumption of\nsmall thickness and width compared to the length of the roll gap (effectively a\nthin-wire large-roller assumption). The mathematical model is compared against\nexperiments performed on stainless steel wire using a 100mm diameter roller,\nand is shown to provide accurate predictions of lateral spread across a wide\nrange of wire diameters (2.96mm-7.96mm) and reduction ratios (20%-60%), all\nwithout the need for fitting parameters. The model requires only seconds to\ncompute and serves as a robust tool for validating FE results, guiding process\ndesign, and laying the foundation for future improved models.",

This paper introduces an Ultra-Low Bitrate\nSemantic Communication (ULBSC) system that employs a conditional generative\nmodel and a learnable condition codebook.By integrating saliency conditions and\nimage-level semantic information, the proposed method enables\nhigh-perceptual-quality and controllable task-oriented image transmission.\nRecognizing shared patterns among objects, we propose a codebook-assisted\ncondition transmission method, integrated with joint source-channel coding\n(JSCC)-based text transmission to establish ULBSC.

Although LLMs demonstrate remarkable natural language processing\ncapabilities, they also face several challenges, including consistency issues,\nhallucinations, and jailbreak vulnerabilities. Jailbreaking refers to the\ncrafting of prompts that bypass alignment safeguards, leading to unsafe outputs\nthat compromise the integrity of LLMs. This work specifically focuses on the\nchallenge of jailbreak vulnerabilities and introduces a novel taxonomy of\njailbreak attacks grounded in the training domains of LLMs. It characterizes\nalignment failures through generalization, objectives, and robustness gaps. Our\nprimary contribution is a perspective on jailbreak, framed through the\ndifferent linguistic domains that emerge during LLM training and alignment.\nThis viewpoint highlights the limitations of existing approaches and enables us\nto classify jailbreak attacks on the basis of the underlying model deficiencies\nthey exploit. Unlike conventional classifications that categorize attacks based\non prompt construction methods (e.g., prompt templating), our approach provides\na deeper understanding of LLM behavior. We introduce a taxonomy with four\ncategories -- mismatched generalization, competing objectives, adversarial\nrobustness, and mixed attacks -- offering insights into the fundamental nature\nof jailbreak vulnerabilities.

However, current benchmarks do not fully\naddress these challenges, as they mostly focus on visual grounding on natural\nimages, rather than text-rich document images. Thus, to bridge this gap, we\nintroduce TRIG, a novel task with a newly designed instruction dataset for\nbenchmarking and improving the Text-Rich Image Grounding capabilities of MLLMs\nin document question-answering. Specifically, we propose an OCR-LLM-human\ninteraction pipeline to create 800 manually annotated question-answer pairs as\na benchmark and a large-scale training set of 90$ synthetic data based on four\ndiverse datasets. A comprehensive evaluation of various MLLMs on our proposed\nbenchmark exposes substantial limitations in their grounding capability on\ntext-rich images.

Only Chakti and\nICTP 8203 are adapted to the climatic conditions of the eastern and western\nzones, with a probability of suitability of over 80% for the periods 1931-1969\nand 1999-2020. However, none of the varieties is adapted to the climatic\nconditions in the north. In addition to these climatic constraints, the\ninterviewed farmers attribute the decline in agricultural production to\nlivestock straying, attacks by bird pests and parasitic infestations.\nexacerbate agricultural losses. It is therefore essential to develop\ncomplementary strategies including wider dissemination of varieties better\nadapted to current climatic conditions, such as Chakti and ICTP 8203, and the\nstrengthening of crop protection systems, notably through biological control\nand integrated pest management.",

This study aims to measure the $E_G$ estimator in GR and\n$f(R)$ models using high-fidelity simulated galaxy catalogs, with the goal of\nassessing how future galaxy surveys can detect deviations from standard\ngravity. Deriving this estimator requires precise, unbiased measurements of the\ngrowth rate of structure and the linear galaxy bias. We achieve this by\nimplementing an end-to-end cosmological analysis pipeline in configuration\nspace, using the multipoles of the 2-point correlation function. Our analysis\ndemonstrates how to measure the scale-dependent growth rate predicted by\nnon-standard gravity models. We split the estimation of the RSD $\\beta$\nparameter over distinct scale ranges, separating large (quasi-linear) and small\n(non-linear) scales. We show that this estimator can be accurately measured\nusing mock galaxies in low redshift bins ($z < 1$), where it offers strong\ndiscriminating power over competing gravity theories. We find that, for an\nall-sky galaxy survey and neglecting observational systematics, accurate and\nlargely unbiased estimations of $E_G$ can be obtained across all redshifts.\nHowever, the error bars are too large to clearly distinguish between the\ntheories. When measuring the scale-dependence of the $E_G$ estimator, we note\nthat state-of-the-art theory modeling limitations and intrinsic \"prior volume\neffects\" prevent high-accuracy constraints. Alternatively, we propose a null\ntest of gravity using RSD clustering, which, if small scales are modeled\naccurately in future surveys, could detect significant departures from GR.",

Existed methods for shifting the\nfrequency of a photon based on electro-optical, or acousto-optical effect,\nhowever, suffer the limited frequency shift up to a few hundreds of GHz,\nfurthermore, high-quality micro-wave electronics are required. The frequency of\na photon can also be shifted with the frequency difference equal to the\nfrequency of pump laser by using an all optical-wave-mixing approach, which is\nusually about tens of THz. So, there is a big frequency shifting gap between\nthese methods. Here, we propose a new scheme of a quantum frequency shifter\nbased on an all-optical wave-mixing process, which can theoretically achieve a\nfrequency shift ranging from GHz to a few THz, therefore bridging the gap. As a\nprinciple of poof, by using two pump beams in a three-wave mixing cascading\nprocess, a heralded single photon is frequency-shifted more than 400GHz, and\nthe shift can be tuned continuously over broadband by changing the frequency\ndifference between two pump lasers. Besides, high coincidence to accidence\nratio between the shifted photons and the heralded photon indicates the\npreserve of quantum properties.

    "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a important\nparadigm for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences\nduring post-training. This framework typically involves two stages: first,\ntraining a reward model on human preference data, followed by optimizing the\nlanguage model using reinforcement learning algorithms. However, current RLHF\napproaches may constrained by two limitations. First, existing RLHF frameworks\noften rely on Bradley-Terry models to assign scalar rewards based on pairwise\ncomparisons of individual responses. However, this approach imposes significant\nchallenges on reward model (RM), as the inherent variability in prompt-response\npairs across different contexts demands robust calibration capabilities from\nthe RM. Second, reward models are typically initialized from generative\nfoundation models, such as pre-trained or supervised fine-tuned models, despite\nthe fact that reward models perform discriminative tasks, creating a mismatch.\nThis paper introduces Pairwise-RL, a RLHF framework that addresses these\nchallenges through a combination of generative reward modeling and a pairwise\nproximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm. Pairwise-RL unifies reward model\ntraining and its application during reinforcement learning within a consistent\npairwise paradigm, leveraging generative modeling techniques to enhance reward\nmodel performance and score calibration. Experimental evaluations demonstrate\nthat Pairwise-RL outperforms traditional RLHF frameworks across both internal\nevaluation datasets and standard public benchmarks, underscoring its\neffectiveness in improving alignment and model behavior.",

We focus on the\nsituation in which the resident microbial host population and the virus\npopulation are in stable coexistence upon arrival of a single new ``mutant''\nhost individual. We assume that this mutant is capable of switching to a\nreversible state of dormancy upon contact with virions as a means of avoiding\ninfection by the virus. At the same time, we assume that this new dormancy\ntrait comes with a cost, namely a reduced individual reproduction rate. We\nprove that there is a non-trivial range of parameters where the mutants can\nnevertheless invade the resident population with strictly positive probability\n(bounded away from 0) in the large population limit. Given the reduced\nreproductive rate, such an invasion would be impossible in the absence of\neither the dormancy trait or the virus epidemic. We explicitly characterize the\nparameter regime where this emergence of a (costly) host dormancy trait is\npossible, determine the success probability of a single invader and the typical\namount of time it takes the successful mutants to reach a macroscopic\npopulation size. We conclude this study by an investigation of the fate of the\npopulation after the successful emergence of a dormancy trait. Heuristic\narguments and simulations suggest that after successful invasion, either both\nhost types and the virus will reach coexistence, or the mutants will drive the\nresident hosts to extinction while the virus will stay in the system.",

    "abstract": "Crowd counting, which is a key computer vision task, has emerged as a\nfundamental technology in crowd analysis and public safety management. However,\nchallenges such as scale variations and complex backgrounds significantly\nimpact the accuracy of crowd counting. To mitigate these issues, this paper\nproposes a robust Transformer-based crowd counting network, termed RCCFormer,\nspecifically designed for background suppression and scale awareness. The\nproposed method incorporates a Multi-level Feature Fusion Module (MFFM), which\nmeticulously integrates features extracted at diverse stages of the backbone\narchitecture. It establishes a strong baseline capable of capturing intricate\nand comprehensive feature representations, surpassing traditional baselines.\nFurthermore, the introduced Detail-Embedded Attention Block (DEAB) captures\ncontextual information and local details through global self-attention and\nlocal attention along with a learnable manner for efficient fusion. This\nenhances the model's ability to focus on foreground regions while effectively\nmitigating background noise interference. Additionally, we develop an Adaptive\nScale-Aware Module (ASAM), with our novel Input-dependent Deformable\nConvolution (IDConv) as its fundamental building block. This module dynamically\nadapts to changes in head target shapes and scales, significantly improving the\nnetwork's capability to accommodate large-scale variations. The effectiveness\nof the proposed method is validated on the ShanghaiTech Part_A and Part_B,\nNWPU-Crowd, and QNRF datasets. The results demonstrate that our RCCFormer\nachieves excellent performance across all four datasets, showcasing\nstate-of-the-art outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Relational databases, organized into tables connected by primary-foreign key\nrelationships, are a common format for organizing data. Making predictions on\nrelational data often involves transforming them into a flat tabular format\nthrough table joins and feature engineering, which serve as input to tabular\nmethods. However, designing features that fully capture complex relational\npatterns remains challenging. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) offer a compelling\nalternative by inherently modeling these relationships, but their time overhead\nduring inference limits their applicability for real-time scenarios. In this\nwork, we aim to bridge this gap by leveraging existing feature engineering\nefforts to enhance the efficiency of GNNs in relational databases.\nSpecifically, we use GNNs to capture complex relationships within relational\ndatabases, patterns that are difficult to featurize, while employing engineered\nfeatures to encode temporal information, thereby avoiding the need to retain\nthe entire historical graph and enabling the use of smaller, more efficient\ngraphs. Our \\textsc{LightRDL} approach not only improves efficiency, but also\noutperforms existing models. Experimental results on the RelBench benchmark\ndemonstrate that our framework achieves up to $33\\%$ performance improvement\nand a $526\\times$ inference speedup compared to GNNs, making it highly suitable\nfor real-time inference.",

Despite their importance,\nevaluating the quality of counterfactual explanations remains an open problem.\nTraditional quantitative metrics, such as sparsity or proximity, fail to fully\naccount for human preferences in explanations, while user studies are\ninsightful but not scalable. Moreover, relying only on a single overall\nsatisfaction rating does not lead to a nuanced understanding of why certain\nexplanations are effective or not. To address this, we analyze a dataset of\ncounterfactual explanations that were evaluated by 206 human participants, who\nrated not only overall satisfaction but also seven explanatory criteria:\nfeasibility, coherence, complexity, understandability, completeness, fairness,\nand trust. Modeling overall satisfaction as a function of these criteria, we\nfind that feasibility (the actionability of suggested changes) and trust (the\nbelief that the changes would lead to the desired outcome) consistently stand\nout as the strongest predictors of user satisfaction, though completeness also\nemerges as a meaningful contributor. Crucially, even excluding feasibility and\ntrust, other metrics explain 58% of the variance, highlighting the importance\nof additional explanatory qualities. Complexity appears independent, suggesting\nmore detailed explanations do not necessarily reduce satisfaction. Strong\nmetric correlations imply a latent structure in how users judge quality, and\ndemographic background significantly shapes ranking patterns.

On linearly\nquenching the infinitely large system, we find that the behavior of mean\nlongitudinal defect density and mean transverse magnetization at the end of the\nquench falls into three distinct scaling regimes as the quench time is\nincreased. For sufficiently small quench times, these observables remain\nroughly constant, but for larger quench times, a crossover occurs from the\nKibble-Zurek scaling law to the quadratic quench rate law when the Kibble-Zurek\ntime is of the order of relaxation time at the final quench field.

This\nsensitivity enables fine-tuning of the resonance wavelength and near-field\nenhancement, offering the potential for advanced optical applications.

Such limitations hinder the comprehensive study of plasmon\ncoupling across varying interaction regimes. Overcoming these challenges is\nessential for advancing nanoplasmonic research and its practical applications.\nHerein, we demonstrate a tuneable plasmonic device in which real-time\ntunability of this hybridization mode is achieved via manipulation of the\ninter-droplet gap of liquid metal nanoparticles by macroscopic physical\ndeformation. In particular, we show that the optical spectra obtained from the\nsample shift towards higher energy on the application of a linear strain,\nresulting in an increase of inter-droplet gaps leading to a direct probing of\nthe bright modes in situ. Our method thus offers a novel means of exploring the\nfundamental concept of real-time tuneable plasmon hybridization as well as\ntuning of nanoparticle assembly with any desired gap in a controlled manner.",

    "abstract": "As language models continue to grow larger, the cost of acquiring\nhigh-quality training data has increased significantly. Collecting human\nfeedback is both expensive and time-consuming, and manual labels can be noisy,\nleading to an imbalance between helpfulness and harmfulness. Constitutional AI,\nintroduced by Anthropic in December 2022, uses AI to provide feedback to\nanother AI, greatly reducing the need for human labeling. However, the original\nimplementation was designed for a model with around 52 billion parameters, and\nthere is limited information on how well Constitutional AI performs with\nsmaller models, such as LLaMA 3-8B. In this paper, we replicated the\nConstitutional AI workflow using the smaller LLaMA 3-8B model. Our results show\nthat Constitutional AI can effectively increase the harmlessness of the model,\nreducing the Attack Success Rate in MT-Bench by 40.8%. However, similar to the\noriginal study, increasing harmlessness comes at the cost of helpfulness. The\nhelpfulness metrics, which are an average of the Turn 1 and Turn 2 scores,\ndropped by 9.8% compared to the baseline. Additionally, we observed clear signs\nof model collapse in the final DPO-CAI model, indicating that smaller models\nmay struggle with self-improvement due to insufficient output quality, making\neffective fine-tuning more challenging.

This is especially true for stripped-envelope (Type Ib/c) SNe,\nwhere the progenitor ejects a considerably large amount of material during its\nevolution, which can lead to a circumstellar medium relatively close to the\nexploding star. Moreover, when the star explodes as a SN, this matter may\ncontribute significantly to the generated luminosity because of the\ninteraction. However, the trace of this circumstellar interaction can only be\ninvestigated for a couple of Type Ib/c SNe, and the nature of a close (within\naround $10^{15}$ cm) circumstellar matter (CSM) has also been largely\nunexplored for these objects.\n  Here, we present the results of our radio and bolometric light curve (LC)\nanalysis related to SN 2004gq. We describe a combined model that explains the\nunusual LC properties of this event and supports the circumstellar interaction\nscenario. For that, we computed the quasi-bolometric LC of the SN and fit this\nwith a multicomponent model to gain information on the progenitor and the\nsurrounding circumstellar medium. We also analyzed the available radio LCs\n(taken at 1.4,\\ 4.9 and 8.5 GHz) of SN 2004gq to verify our estimated average\nmass-loss rate, which is one of the most crucial physical properties related to\nCSM models.\n  We infer reasonable parameters for SN 2004gq using radioactive decay and\nmagnetar energy input. To power the entire LC, we must also add an extra energy\nsource related to the CSM. We determine the most essential parameter of this\nmedium: the average mass-loss rate from both LC and radio data fitting. We find\nthat the suggested hidden circumstellar interaction is a viable mechanism that\nprovides the required energy deficiency and that it can be estimated using a\nsimple semi-analytic model.",

At each\ntime, the central scheduler selects one of the sources to probe the quality of\nits channel to the sink node, and then the assessed channel quality is utilized\nto determine whether a source will sample and send the packet. For a single\nsource case, we assume that the probed channel quality is known at each time\ninstant, model the problem of AoI minimization as a Markov decision process,\nand prove the optimal sampling policy threshold structure. We then use this\nthreshold structure and propose an AEC-SW-UCRL2 algorithm to handle unknown and\ntime varying energy harvesting rate and channel statistics, motivated by the\npopular SWUCRL2 algorithm for non stationary reinforcement learning. This\nalgorithm is applicable when an upper bound is available for the total\nvariation of each of these quantities over a time horizon. Furthermore, in\nsituations where these variation budgets are not accessible, we introduce the\nAEC-BORL algorithm, motivated by the well known BORL algorithm. For the\nmultiple source case, we demonstrate that the AoI minimization problem can be\nformulated as a constrained MDP, which can be relaxed using a Lagrange\nmultiplier and decoupled into sub problems across source nodes. We also derive\nWhittle index based source scheduling policy for probing and an optimal\nthreshold policy for source sampling. We next leverage this Whittle index and\nthreshold structure to develop the WIT-SW-UCRL2 algorithm for unknown time\nvarying energy harvesting rates and channel statistics under their respective\nvariation budgets. Moreover, we also proposed a Whittle index and threshold\nbased bandit over reinforcement learning (WIT-BORL) algorithm for unknown\nvariation budgets.

In the testing phase, they\nidentify patterns that deviate from this normal distribution as 'anomalies'. To\nlearn the `normal' distribution, prevailing methods corrupt the images and\ntrain a model to reconstruct them. During testing, the model attempts to\nreconstruct corrupted inputs based on the learned 'normal' distribution.\nDeviations from this distribution lead to high reconstruction errors, which\nindicate potential anomalies. However, corrupting an input image inevitably\ncauses information loss even in normal regions, leading to suboptimal\nreconstruction and an increased risk of false positives. To alleviate this, we\npropose IterMask3D, an iterative spatial mask-refining strategy designed for 3D\nbrain MRI. We iteratively spatially mask areas of the image as corruption and\nreconstruct them, then shrink the mask based on reconstruction error. This\nprocess iteratively unmasks 'normal' areas to the model, whose information\nfurther guides reconstruction of 'normal' patterns under the mask to be\nreconstructed accurately, reducing false positives. In addition, to achieve\nbetter reconstruction performance, we also propose using high-frequency image\ncontent as additional structural information to guide the reconstruction of the\nmasked area.

In this paper, we\nposition Cloud-Fog Automation with 3C co-design as the new paradigm to realize\nthe vision of autonomous ICPS. We articulate the state-of-the-art and future\ndirections in the field, and specifically discuss how goal-oriented\ncommunication, virtualization-empowered computing, and Quality of Service\n(QoS)-aware control can drive Cloud-Fog Automation towards a fully autonomous\nICPS, while accounting for system-wide cyber-physical security.",

    "abstract": "Digital twins are becoming powerful tools in industrial applications,\noffering virtual representations of cyber-physical systems. However,\nverification of these models remains a significant challenge due to the\npotentially large datasets used by the digital twin. This paper introduces an\ninnovative methodology for verifying neural network-based digital twin models,\nin a black-box fashion, by integrating model checking into the process. The\nlatter relies on defining and applying system-level contracts that capture the\nsystem's requirements, to verify the behavior of digital twin models,\nimplemented in Simulink. We develop an automated solution that simulates the\ndigital twin model for certain inputs, and feeds the predicted outputs together\nwith the inputs to the contract model described as a network of timed automata\nin the UPPAAL model checker. The latter verifies whether the predicted outputs\nfulfill the specified contracts. This approach allows us to identify scenarios\nwhere the digital twin's behavior fails to meet the contracts, without\nrequiring the digital twin's design technicalities. We apply our method to a\nboiler system case study for which we identify prediction errors via contract\nverification.

Current video generation benchmarks fall into two main\ncategories: traditional benchmarks, which use metrics and embeddings to\nevaluate generated video quality across multiple dimensions but often lack\nalignment with human judgments; and large language model (LLM)-based\nbenchmarks, though capable of human-like reasoning, are constrained by a\nlimited understanding of video quality metrics and cross-modal consistency. To\naddress these challenges and establish a benchmark that better aligns with\nhuman preferences, this paper introduces Video-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark\nfeaturing a rich prompt suite and extensive evaluation dimensions. This\nbenchmark represents the first attempt to systematically leverage MLLMs across\nall dimensions relevant to video generation assessment in generative models. By\nincorporating few-shot scoring and chain-of-query techniques, Video-Bench\nprovides a structured, scalable approach to generated video evaluation.\nExperiments on advanced models including Sora demonstrate that Video-Bench\nachieves superior alignment with human preferences across all dimensions.\nMoreover, in instances where our framework's assessments diverge from human\nevaluations, it consistently offers more objective and accurate insights,\nsuggesting an even greater potential advantage over traditional human judgment.",

The bit-flip operation corresponds to switching between\nthe two PD and DTC states induced by a defect in a periodic drive, introduced\nin a controlled manner by linearly ramping the phase of the modulation of the\ndrive. In the absence of stochastic noise, strong dissipation results in a more\nrobust bit-flip operation in which slight changes to the defect parameters do\nnot significantly lower the success rate of bit-flips. The operation remains\nrobust even in the presence of stochastic noise when the defect duration is\nsufficiently large. The fluctuations also enhance the success rate of the\nbit-flip below the critical defect duration needed to induce a switch. By\nconsidering parameter regimes in which the DTC states in the spin-cavity system\ndo not directly map to the PD states, we reveal that this robustness is due to\nthe system being quenched by the defect towards a new phase that has enough\nexcitation to suppress the effects of the stochastic noise. This allows for\nprecise control of the bit-flip operations by tuning into the preferred\nintermediate state that the system will enter during a bit-flip operation.

In contrast to the traditional design approach\ninvolving a BPF, a matching transmission line, and a Wilkinson power divider as\nseparate components, the proposed integrated filtering power divider (FPD)\nconsolidates all three components into a single device, leading to lower\nfootprint and lower loss coefficient in a system. Circuit modelling and\nelectromagnetic (EM) simulations were conducted to ensure alignment between\ntheoretical and practical results. The design demonstrates effective unequal\npower division at the three output ports while maintaining very good filtering\nperformance. Results show a return loss better than 15 dB and a minimum\ninsertion loss of 1.2 dB. The overall size of the device is 32.2 x 50.0 mm.\nThis paper contributes to advancements in power divider design by addressing\nunequal power division challenges and integrating filtering functions. The\nfindings offer a foundation for future developments in advanced power\ndivider/combiner systems, with insights into potential challenges and areas for\nfurther improvements.",

Based on brain imaging and tabular\ndata from 407 stroke patients, we trained dTMs to predict functional outcome\nthree months after stroke.

The most important tabular\npredictors of functional outcome are functional independence before stroke and\nNIHSS on admission, a neurological score indicating stroke severity.\nExplanation maps calculated from brain imaging dTMs for functional outcome\nhighlighted critical brain regions such as the frontal lobe, which is known to\nbe linked to age which in turn increases the risk for unfavorable outcomes.\nSimilarity plots of the explanation maps revealed distinct patterns which give\ninsight into stroke pathophysiology, support developing novel predictors of\nstroke outcome and enable to identify false predictions.\n  Conclusion: By adapting methods for explanation maps to dTMs, we enhanced the\nexplainability of multi-modal and partly interpretable prediction models.

Nevertheless, chiral symmetry breaking in\nnon-Hermitian systems disrupts topological protection, modifies topological\ninvariants, and substantially reshapes spectral and edge-state behavior. The\ncorresponding fundamentally important bulk-boundary correspondence thus needs\nto be drastically reconstructed. However, it has so far eluded experimental\nefforts.

Through constructing a domain-wall configuration, we\nexperimentally observe the photon localization at the interface of domain-wall\nstructure, clearly indicating the presence of the topological edge mode. The\nappearance of that matches excellently with the prediction of our introduced\nnon-chiral non-Bloch topological invariants pair. Our work thus unequivocally\nbuilds the non-Hermitian bulk-boundary correspondence as a general principle\nfor studying topological physics in non-Hermitian systems with chiral symmetry\nbreaking.",

The novelty is the\nreplacement of the Shamir kernel used in all previous work with the Wilson\nkernel, improving the action particularly with respect to the $L_s\\to\\infty$\nlimit needed to recover U(2), now under much better control. Auxiliary field\nensembles generated on $16^3\\times24$ with varying self-interaction strength\n$g^2$ and bare mass $m$ are used to measure the bilinear condensate order\nparameter $\\langle\\bar\\psi i\\gamma_3\\psi\\rangle$ with domain wall separations\nas large as $L_s=120$.

    "abstract": "Based on the experimental measurements of the electron-positron annihilation\nreactions into a baryon ($B$) and anti-baryon ($\\bar{B}$) pair, the\nelectromagnetic form factors of hyperons in the time-like region can be\ninvestigated within the vector meson dominance model. The theoretical model\nparameters are determined by fitting them to the total cross sections of the\nprocess $e^+e^-\\to B \\bar{B}$, and it is found that the current experimental\ndata on the baryon electromagnetic form factors in the time-like region can be\nwell reproduced. In addition to the total cross sections, the electromagnetic\nform factors $G_E$ and $G_M$, and the charge radii of those baryons are also\nestimated, which are in agreement with the experimental data. On the other\nhand, we have also investigated the nonmonotonic behavior of the time-like\nbaryon electromagnetic form factors, and it is found that the previously\nproposed periodic behaviour of the nucleon time-like electromagnetic form\nfactor is not confirmed. However, we do observe the nonmonotonic structures in\nthe line shape of the baryon effective form factors or the ratio $|G_E/G_M|$\nfor the charmed baryon $\\Lambda^+_c$. These features can be naturally explained\nby incorporating contributions from excited vector states. More precise\nmeasurements of the $e^+e^-\\to B \\bar{B}$ reaction offer a valuable opportunity\nto probe the properties of excited vector states, which are at present poorly\nknown. Additionally, comprehensive theoretical and experimental studies of\nbaryon timelike electromagnetic form factors can provide critical insights into\nthe underlying mechanisms of electron-positron annihilation processes.",

    "abstract": "We consider the class of Hopfield models of associative memory with\nactivation function $F$ and state space $\\{-1,1\\}^N$, where each vertex of the\ncube describes a configuration of $N$ binary neurons. $M$ randomly chosen\nconfigurations, called patterns, are stored using an energy function designed\nto make them local minima. If they are, which is known to depend on how $M$\nscales with $N$, then they can be retrieved using a dynamics that decreases the\nenergy. However, storing the patterns in the energy function also creates\nunintended local minima, and thus false memories. Although this has been known\nsince the earliest work on the subject, it has only been supported by numerical\nsimulations and non-rigorous calculations, except in elementary cases.\n  Our results are twofold. For a generic function $F$, we explicitly construct\na set of configurations, called mixed memories, whose properties are intended\nto characterise the local minima of the energy function. For three prominent\nmodels, namely the classical, the dense and the modern Hopfield models,\nobtained for quadratic, polynomial and exponential functions $F$ respectively,\nwe give conditions on the growth rate of $M$ which guarantee that, as $N$\ndiverges, mixed memories are fixed points of the retrieval dynamics and thus\nexact minima of the energy. We conjecture that in this regime, all local minima\nare mixed memories.",

    "abstract": "The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (LTH) posits the existence of a sparse\nsubnetwork (a.k.a. winning ticket) that can generalize comparably to its\nover-parameterized counterpart when trained from scratch. The common approach\nto finding a winning ticket is to preserve the original strong generalization\nthrough Iterative Pruning (IP) and transfer information useful for achieving\nthe learned generalization by applying the resulting sparse mask to an\nuntrained network. However, existing IP methods still struggle to generalize\ntheir observations beyond ad-hoc initialization and small-scale architectures\nor datasets, or they bypass these challenges by applying their mask to trained\nweights instead of initialized ones. In this paper, we demonstrate that the\nparameter sign configuration plays a crucial role in conveying useful\ninformation for generalization to any randomly initialized network. Through\nlinear mode connectivity analysis, we observe that a sparse network trained by\nan existing IP method can retain its basin of attraction if its parameter signs\nand normalization layer parameters are preserved. To take a step closer to\nfinding a winning ticket, we alleviate the reliance on normalization layer\nparameters by preventing high error barriers along the linear path between the\nsparse network trained by our method and its counterpart with initialized\nnormalization layer parameters. Interestingly, across various architectures and\ndatasets, we observe that any randomly initialized network can be optimized to\nexhibit low error barriers along the linear path to the sparse network trained\nby our method by inheriting its sparsity and parameter sign information,\npotentially achieving performance comparable to the original.

The\napplications in nuclear environments require radiation resistance. The\ncharacteristics of Ge-doped MM fibers are investigated for Radiation Induced\nAttenuation (RIA) in Total Ionizing Dose (TID).\n  Methods: Commercial samples of Ge-doped MM fibers were irradiated in Go-60\ngamma rays at dose rates of 5 to 1.4k Gy(SiO2)/hr. The fiber samples were\npackaged in water tanks maintained at constant temperatures in the range of -15\nto 45 degC. The optical power transmitted through the fibers were recorded in\nirradiation, and in annealing when the source was shielded. The measurements of\nRIA in time are analyzed for dose rate and temperature dependences.\n  Results: Ge-doped fiber samples of OM2 to OM4 grades were investigated for\nattenuation of optical power in radiation ionizing dose. Depending on the\nfabrication technology, two of the fiber types show radiation resistance with\nthe RIAs of 0.2 dB/m and 0.05 dB/m, respectively, for the TID of 300 kGy(SiO2).\nAt low dose rate of 5 Gy/hr, the RIA increases steadily and the annealing of\nlow density ionizing defects does not cause notable deviation. At 1.4 kGy/hr\nthe accumulated defects result to twice higher RIA during irradiation, and is\nworsen to a factor three in cold temperature. However, once the source is\nshielded the recovery is effective in a few hours.\n  Conclusion: The telecom products of 850 nm Ge-doped MM fibers provide high\nspeed communication in distances of a few hundred meters. The industrial\nfabrication methods provide fibers that can endure radiation ionizing dose for\napplications in nuclear instrumentation.",

    "abstract": "Image restoration has witnessed significant advancements with the development\nof deep learning models. Especially Transformer-based models, particularly\nthose leveraging window-based self-attention, have become a dominant force in\nimage restoration. However, their performance is fundamentally constrained by\nthe rigid, non-overlapping window partitioning scheme, which leads to two\ncritical limitations: insufficient feature interaction across window boundaries\nand content-agnostic receptive fields that cannot adapt to diverse image\nstructures. Existing methods often rely on heuristic patterns to mitigate these\nissues, rather than addressing the root cause. In this paper, we propose the\nDeformable Sliding Window Transformer (DSwinIR), a new foundational backbone\narchitecture that systematically overcomes these limitations. At the heart of\nDSwinIR is the proposed novel Deformable Sliding Window (DSwin) Attention. This\nmechanism introduces two fundamental innovations. First, it replaces the rigid\npartitioning with a token-centric sliding window paradigm, ensuring seamless\ncross-window information flow and effectively eliminating boundary artifacts.\nSecond, it incorporates a content-aware deformable sampling strategy, which\nallows the attention mechanism to learn data-dependent offsets and dynamically\nshape its receptive fields to focus on the most informative image regions. This\nsynthesis endows the model with both strong locality-aware inductive biases and\npowerful, adaptive long-range modeling capabilities. Extensive experiments show\nthat DSwinIR sets a new state-of-the-art across a wide spectrum of image\nrestoration tasks. For instance, in all-in-one restoration, our DSwinIR\nsurpasses the most recent backbone GridFormer by over 0.53 dB on the three-task\nbenchmark and a remarkable 0.86 dB on the five-task benchmark.",

Many statistical simulation studies\naim to provide practical recommendations on a method's suitability for a given\napplication; however, parametric simulations in particular are frequently\ncriticized for being too simplistic and not reflecting reality.

It first develops a multi-stage plan to analyze user-specified\nbias detection tasks and then implements it with a diverse and well-suited set\nof tools. It delivers detailed results that include explanations and\nvisualizations. To address the lack of a standardized framework for evaluating\nthe capability of LLM agents to detect biases in data, we further propose a\ncomprehensive benchmark that includes multiple evaluation metrics and a large\nset of test cases. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework\nachieves exceptional overall performance in structured data bias detection,\nsetting a new milestone for fairer data applications.",

Thus, it offers practical advantages in designing and building electron\noptical instruments and contributes to system miniaturization.

In this work, we\npropose a novel self-disentangled MAE for learning expressive, discriminative,\nand transferable 4D representations. To overcome the first limitation, we learn\nmotion by aligning high-level semantics in the latent space \\textit{without any\nexplicit knowledge}. To tackle the second, we introduce a\n\\textit{self-disentangled learning} strategy that incorporates the latent token\nwith the geometry token within a shared decoder, effectively disentangling\nlow-level geometry and high-level semantics. In addition to the reconstruction\nobjective, we employ three alignment objectives to enhance temporal\nunderstanding, including frame-level motion and video-level global information.\nWe show that our pre-trained encoder surprisingly discriminates spatio-temporal\nrepresentation without further fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on\nMSR-Action3D, NTU-RGBD, HOI4D, NvGesture, and SHREC'17 demonstrate the\nsuperiority of our approach in both coarse-grained and fine-grained 4D\ndownstream tasks.

Second, the Boltzmann\nequation's reliance on molecular chaos collapses in fluid-like regimes, where\nrecollisions and correlations invalidate its derivation from Newtonian\ndynamics. These inconsistencies expose a disconnect between the formalism and\nthe physical essence of fluids, failing to capture emergent, density-driven\nphenomena central to Hilbert's vision.

In this paper, we ask:\nHow can we build a universal detection framework that is effective for most\nfacial deepfakes? One significant challenge is the wide variety of deepfake\ngenerators available, resulting in varying forgery artifacts (e.g., lighting\ninconsistency, color mismatch, etc). But should we ``teach\" the detector to\nlearn all these artifacts separately? It is impossible and impractical to\nelaborate on them all. So the core idea is to pinpoint the more common and\ngeneral artifacts across different deepfakes. Accordingly, we categorize\ndeepfake artifacts into two distinct yet complementary types: Face\nInconsistency Artifacts (FIA) and Up-Sampling Artifacts (USA). FIA arise from\nthe challenge of generating all intricate details, inevitably causing\ninconsistencies between the complex facial features and relatively uniform\nsurrounding areas. USA, on the other hand, are the inevitable traces left by\nthe generator's decoder during the up-sampling process. This categorization\nstems from the observation that all existing deepfakes typically exhibit one or\nboth of these artifacts. To achieve this, we propose a new data-level\npseudo-fake creation framework that constructs fake samples with only the FIA\nand USA, without introducing extra less-general artifacts. Specifically, we\nemploy a super-resolution to simulate the USA, while design a Blender module\nthat uses image-level self-blending on diverse facial regions to create the\nFIA. We surprisingly found that, with this intuitive design, a standard image\nclassifier trained only with our pseudo-fake data can non-trivially generalize\nwell to unseen deepfakes.",

Our approach consists in reformulating the\nVlasov-Poisson system as a hyperbolic problem by applying a spectral expansion\nin the basis of Hermite functions in the velocity space and in designing a\nstructure-preserving scheme for the time and spatial variables. Through this\nHermite formulation, we establish a convergence result for the electric field\ntoward its quasineutral limit together with optimal error estimates. Following\nthis path, we then propose a fully discrete numerical method for the\nVlasov-Poisson system, inspired by the approach in arXiv:2306.14605 , and\nrigorously prove that it is uniformly consistent in the quasineutral limit\nregime. Finally, we present several numerical simulations to illustrate the\nbehavior of the proposed scheme. These results demonstrate the capability of\nour method to describe quasineutral plasmas and confirm the theoretical\nfindings: stability and asymptotic preservation.",

    "abstract": "The mergers of binary neutron stars (BNSs) and neutron star-black holes\n(NSBHs) binaries have long been linked to short-duration gamma-ray bursts\n(SGRBs). However, despite their stellar progenitors, SGRBs are often found\noutside the stellar light of the host galaxy. This is commonly attributed to\nsupernova kicks, which displace the SGRB progenitors from the original stellar\npopulation. Our goal is to use stellar population synthesis models to reproduce\nand interpret the observed offsets of a statistical sample of SGRBs, using\nrealistic galactic models based on the observed host properties. We derive the\nhost galaxy potentials from the observed properties on a case-by-case basis,\nand simulate the galactic trajectories of synthetic BNSs and NSBHs from the\nBPASS code using three different kick prescriptions. We compare predicted and\nobserved offsets to investigate the impact of velocity kicks, host galaxy\ntypes, and host association criteria. The results confirm that the locations of\nthe SGRB population are consistent with the expectations of kicked BNS or BHNS\nprogenitors, implying that such mergers are the dominant (if not only)\nprogenitor system. Predictions for NSBHs provide a significantly worse fit\ncompared to BNSs, while we find no significant difference when comparing\ndifferent kick prescriptions. For late-type hosts, we find the best agreement\nwhen including hosts with a probability of chance alignment Pch up to 20%,\nwhile lower Pch thresholds lead us to overestimate SGRB offsets. We argue that\nPch is biased against viable hosts at the largest offsets, and suggest the use\nof less conservative Pch thresholds for late-type hosts. For early-type hosts,\nthe predictions underestimate SGRB offsets in a few cases regardless of the Pch\nthreshold applied. We argue that this is likely due to the models missing\ngalaxy evolution, or spurious host associations.",

In practice, a target might come from far distance or with\nultra-high speed. However, the max unambiguous range and max tolerable velocity\nof OTFS-ISAC system is limited by the unambiguous round-trip delay and Doppler\nshift, which are related to OTFS frame, i.e., time slots and subcarrier\nspacing, respectively. To enlarge the sensing range, a novel OTFS cross-frame\nranging and velocity estimation model as well as its corresponding method based\non the Chinese remainder theorem (CRT) are proposed in this paper. By designing\nco-prime numbers of subcarriers and time slots in different subframes, the\ndifference in the responses of the subframes for a target can be used to\nestimate the distance and velocity of an out-of-range target. Several frame\nstructures are further designed for specific sensing scenarios, such as target\nwith ultra-high speed or at far distance.

In GCD, an inherent label bias exists\nbetween known and unknown classes due to the lack of ground-truth labels for\nthe latter. State-of-the-art methods in GCD leverage parametric classifiers\ntrained through self-distillation with soft labels, leaving the bias issue\nunattended. Besides, they treat all unlabelled samples uniformly, neglecting\nvariations in certainty levels and resulting in suboptimal learning. Moreover,\nthe explicit identification of semantic distribution shifts between known and\nunknown classes, a vital aspect for effective GCD, has been neglected.

Initially, DebGCD\nco-trains an auxiliary debiased classifier in the same feature space as the GCD\nclassifier, progressively enhancing the GCD features. Moreover, we introduce a\nsemantic distribution detector in a separate feature space to implicitly boost\nthe learning efficacy of GCD.

In this\nwork, we propose the Topological Schr\\\"odinger Bridge problem (TSBP) for\nmatching signal distributions on a topological domain. We set the reference\nprocess to follow some linear tractable topology-aware stochastic dynamics such\nas topological heat diffusion. For the case of Gaussian boundary distributions,\nwe derive a closed-form topological SB (TSB) in terms of its time-marginal and\nstochastic differential. In the general case, leveraging the well-known result,\nwe show that the optimal process follows the forward-backward topological\ndynamics governed by some unknowns. Building on these results, we develop\nTSB-based models for matching topological signals by parameterizing the\nunknowns in the optimal process as (topological) neural networks and learning\nthem through likelihood training.

    "abstract": "Diffusion models have been the predominant generative model for tabular data\ngeneration. However, they face the conundrum of modeling under a separate\nversus a unified data representation. The former encounters the challenge of\njointly modeling all multi-modal distributions of tabular data in one model.\nWhile the latter alleviates this by learning a single representation for all\nfeatures, it currently leverages sparse suboptimal encoding heuristics and\nnecessitates additional computation costs. In this work, we address the latter\nby presenting TabRep, a tabular diffusion architecture trained with a unified\ncontinuous representation. To motivate the design of our representation, we\nprovide geometric insights into how the data manifold affects diffusion models.\nThe key attributes of our representation are composed of its density,\nflexibility to provide ample separability for nominal features, and ability to\npreserve intrinsic relationships. Ultimately, TabRep provides a simple yet\neffective approach for training tabular diffusion models under a continuous\ndata manifold. Our results showcase that TabRep achieves superior performance\nacross a broad suite of evaluations. It is the first to synthesize tabular data\nthat exceeds the downstream quality of the original datasets while preserving\nprivacy and remaining computationally efficient.",

As these models continue to grow in complexity,\nensuring their trustworthiness and transparency becomes critical, particularly\nin decentralized environments where traditional trust mechanisms are absent.\nThis paper addresses the challenge of verifying personalized AI models in such\nenvironments, focusing on their integrity and privacy. We propose a novel\nframework that integrates zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive arguments of\nknowledge (zk-SNARKs) with Chainlink decentralized oracles to verify AI model\nperformance claims on blockchain platforms. Our key contribution lies in\nintegrating zk-SNARKs with Chainlink oracles to securely fetch and verify\nexternal data to enable trustless verification of AI models on a blockchain.\nOur approach addresses the limitations of using unverified external data for AI\nverification on the blockchain while preserving sensitive information of AI\nmodels and enhancing transparency. We demonstrate our methodology with a linear\nregression model predicting Bitcoin prices using on-chain data verified on the\nSepolia testnet. Our results indicate the framework's efficacy, with key\nmetrics including proof generation taking an average of 233.63 seconds and\nverification time of 61.50 seconds.

    "abstract": "We consider the textual profiles of different fanfiction maturity ratings,\nhow they vary across fan groups, and how this relates to reader engagement\nmetrics. Previous studies have shown that fanfiction writing is motivated by a\ncombination of admiration for and frustration with the fan object. These\nfindings emerge when looking at fanfiction as a whole, as well as when it is\ndivided into subgroups, also called fandoms. However, maturity ratings are used\nto indicate the intended audience of the fanfiction, as well as whether the\nstory includes mature themes and explicit scenes. Since these ratings can be\nused to filter readers and writers, they can also be seen as a proxy for\ndifferent reader/writer motivations and desires. We find that explicit\nfanfiction in particular has a distinct textual profile when compared to other\nmaturity ratings. These findings thus nuance our understanding of reader/writer\nmotivations in fanfiction communities, and also highlights the influence of the\ncommunity norms and fan behavior more generally on these cultural products.",

The considered\nclass of $n$-dimensional maps allows for any finite number of partitions,\nseparated by various types of discontinuity sets. The key characteristic,\nbeyond discontinuity, is that all functions defining the map have the same real\nfixed point. These maps cannot have hyperbolic cycles other than the fixed\npoint itself. We consider the two-dimensional case in detail. We prove that in\nnongeneric cases, the restriction, or the first return, of the map to a segment\nof straight line is reducible to a piecewise linear circle map. The generic\nattractor, different from the fixed point, is a weird quasiperiodic attractor,\nwhich may coexist with other attractors or attracting sets. We illustrate the\nexistence of these attractors through numerous examples, using functions with\ndifferent types of Jacobian matrices, as well as with different types of\ndiscontinuity sets.

A related study proposed an\nalgorithm that does account for an entire swarm of unreliable robots but\nassumes that the sensor faults are known and remain constant over time. To that\nend, we build on that study by proposing the Bayes Collective Perception Filter\n(BayesCPF) that enables robots with continuously degrading sensors to\naccurately estimate the fill ratio -- the rate at which an environmental\nfeature occurs. Our main contribution is the Extended Kalman Filter within the\nBayesCPF, which helps swarm robots calibrate for their time-varying sensor\ndegradation. We validate our method across different degradation models,\ninitial conditions, and environments in simulated and physical experiments.

To bridge\nthis gap, we propose a novel approach for adapting Transformers to B-rep\nlearning, called the Boundary Representation Transformer (BRT). B-rep models\npose unique challenges due to their irregular topology and continuous geometric\ndefinitions, which are fundamentally different from the structured and discrete\ndata Transformers are designed for. To address this, BRT proposes a continuous\ngeometric embedding method that encodes B-rep surfaces (trimmed and untrimmed)\ninto Bezier triangles, preserving their shape and continuity without\ndiscretization. Additionally, BRT employs a topology-aware embedding method\nthat organizes these geometric embeddings into a sequence of discrete tokens\nsuitable for Transformers, capturing both geometric and topological\ncharacteristics within B-rep models. This enables the Transformer's attention\nmechanism to effectively learn shape patterns and contextual semantics of\nboundary elements in a B-rep model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BRT\nachieves state-of-the-art performance in part classification and feature\nrecognition tasks.",

Our method has\ncomputational cost scaling polynomially with $n$ for circuit depth $D =O(\\log\nn)$ and is more advantageous than matrix product state (MPS) approaches if $n$\nis large. This work underscores PEPSs as a scalable tool for benchmarking\nquantum algorithms, with future potential for sampling applications using\nadvanced contraction techniques.",

Many recent systems rely on parallel\nactuation to provide lighter limbs and allow more complex motion. However,\nthese emerging architectures fall outside the scope of most used description\nformats, leading to difficulties when designing, storing, and sharing the\nmodels of these systems. This paper introduces an extension to the widely used\nUnified Robot Description Format (URDF) to support closed-loop kinematic\nstructures. Our approach relies on augmenting URDF with minimal additional\ninformation to allow more efficient modeling of complex robotic systems while\nmaintaining compatibility with existing design and simulation frameworks.

We demonstrate the applicability of our approach by\nproviding an open-source collection of parallel robots, along with tools for\ngenerating and parsing this extended description format.

To fully integrate far-, medium-, and close-range marine features,\na longitude-cyclic deformable convolution network (LC-DCN) is employed to\nenhance the dynamic receptive field, achieving refined modeling of multi-scale\noceanic characteristics. A Deformable Convolution-enhanced Multi-Step\nPrediction module (DC-MTP) is employed to strengthen temporal dependency\nfeature extraction capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that this\nmodel achieves an average ACC of 0.80 in 15-day global predictions at\n0.25$^\\circ$ resolution, outperforming comparative models by 0.01-0.08. The\naverage mean squared error (MSE) is 0.41 (representing a 5%-31% reduction) and\nthe average mean absolute error (MAE) is 0.44 (0.6%-21% reduction) compared to\nother models. Significant improvements are particularly observed in sea surface\nparameter prediction, deep-sea region characterization, and current velocity\nfield forecasting.

The outburst from February to March\nof 2021 can be divided into three stages: the low hard state (LHS), the hard\nintermediate state (HIMS) and soft intermediate state (SIMS). In the PDSs of\nthe LHS and HIMS, the broad-band noises are well fitted with three Lorentzian\ncomponents: a low-frequency component $L_1$, a middle-frequency component $L_2$\nand a high-frequency component $L_3$. The increasing trend of the\ncharacteristic frequencies for $L_1$ and $L_2$ and the relation between the QPO\nfrequency and characteristic BBN frequency are reported. We found that the\nenergies corresponding to the peaks and shapes of the rms spectra for three BBN\ncomponents are different. The comparison among three BBN components indicates\nthat energy-dominant bands of these BBN components are distinct. Our results\ncan be explained with the truncated disc/hot flow model with a large variable\ndisc and a small hot inner flow.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in deep learning-based joint source-channel coding (deepJSCC)\nhave substantially improved communication performance, but their high\ncomputational cost hinders practical deployment. Moreover, certain applications\nrequire the ability to dynamically adapt computational complexity. To address\nthese issues, we propose a Feature Importance-Aware deepJSCC (FAJSCC) model for\nimage transmission that is both computationally efficient and adjustable.\nFAJSCC employs axis-dimension specialized computation, which performs efficient\noperations individually for each spatial and channel axis, significantly\nreducing computational cost while representing features effectively. It further\nincorporates selective deformable self-attention, which applies self-attention\nonly to selected and adaptively adjusted regions, leveraging the importance and\nrelations of input features to efficiently capture complex feature\ncorrelations. Another key feature of FAJSCC is that the number of selected\nimportant areas can be controlled separately by the encoder and the decoder,\ndepending on the available computational budget. It makes FAJSCC the first\ndeepJSCC architecture to allow independent adjustment of encoder and decoder\ncomplexity within a single trained model.

    "abstract": "Frequent pattern mining is widely used to find ``important'' or\n``interesting'' patterns in data. While it is not easy to mathematically define\nsuch patterns, maximal frequent patterns are promising candidates, as frequency\nis a natural indicator of relevance and maximality helps to summarize the\noutput. As such, their mining has been studied on various data types, including\nitemsets, graphs, and strings. The complexity of mining maximal frequent\nitemsets and subtrees has been thoroughly investigated (e.g., [Boros et al.,\n2003], [Uno et al., 2004]) in the literature. On the other hand, while the idea\nof mining frequent subsequences in sequential data was already introduced in\nthe seminal paper [Agrawal et al., 1995], the complexity of the problem is\nstill open.\n  In this paper, we investigate the complexity of the maximal common\nsubsequence enumeration problem, which is both an important special case of\nmaximal frequent subsequence mining and a generalization of the classic longest\ncommon subsequence (LCS) problem. We show the hardness of enumerating maximal\ncommon subsequences between multiple strings, ruling out the possibility of an\n\\emph{output-polynomial time} enumeration algorithm under $P \\neq NP$, that is,\nan algorithm that runs in time ${\\rm poly}(|\\mathcal I| + N)$, where $|\\mathcal\nI|$ and $N$ are the size of the input and number of output solutions,\nrespectively. To circumvent this intractability, we also investigate the\nparameterized complexity of the problem, and show several results when the\nalphabet size, the number of strings, and the length of a string are taken into\naccount as parameters.",

    "abstract": "Modeling and reproducing crowd behaviors are important in various domains\nincluding psychology, robotics, transport engineering and virtual environments.\nConventional methods have focused on synthesizing momentary scenes, which have\ndifficulty in replicating the continuous nature of real-world crowds. In this\npaper, we introduce a novel method for automatically generating continuous,\nrealistic crowd trajectories with heterogeneous behaviors and interactions\namong individuals. We first design a crowd emitter model. To do this, we obtain\nspatial layouts from single input images, including a segmentation map,\nappearance map, population density map and population probability, prior to\ncrowd generation. The emitter then continually places individuals on the\ntimeline by assigning independent behavior characteristics such as agents'\ntype, pace, and start/end positions using diffusion models. Next, our crowd\nsimulator produces their long-term locomotions. To simulate diverse actions, it\ncan augment their behaviors based on a Markov chain. As a result, our overall\nframework populates the scenes with heterogeneous crowd behaviors by\nalternating between the proposed emitter and simulator. Note that all the\ncomponents in the proposed framework are user-controllable. Lastly, we propose\na benchmark protocol to evaluate the realism and quality of the generated\ncrowds in terms of the scene-level population dynamics and the individual-level\ntrajectory accuracy. We demonstrate that our approach effectively models\ndiverse crowd behavior patterns and generalizes well across different\ngeographical environments.

Capturing scattering behavior across\ndifferent regimes is essential for modeling momentum and energy exchange at the\ngas-surface interface. This study presents a corrugated Cercignani-Lampis-Lord\n(CLL) model to account for surface corrugation in scattering. It extends the\nwashboard-CLL hybrid approach by incorporating tangential momentum\naccommodation in local collisions. The model is validated against molecular\nbeam scattering experiments, focusing on its ability to reproduce the variation\nin scattering behavior with increasing incident energy. Compared to the\nconventional CLL model, the proposed model qualitatively improves the\nrepresentation of key features across the scattering regimes. In particular, it\ncaptures broader angular distributions and increasing reflected energy with\nreflected angle at higher incident energy. It is further applied to Direct\nSimulation Monte-Carlo (DSMC) analysis of rarefied flows over a cylinder and\nwithin an intake to examine the influence of surface corrugation on macroscopic\nflow behavior. The results show that surface corrugation has limited impact on\ntotal drag, while decreasing pressure drag and increasing friction drag.

Since compiling CAD parameter sequences into explicit CAD models is\na non-differentiable process, the network training inherently lacks explicit\ngeometric supervision.

In the 3D physical world, due to observation\norientation, object rotation, or spatial occlusion, we can only get a partial\nobservation of the object. So this dataset includes affordance estimations of\nobjects from full-view, partial-view, and rotation-view perspectives. To\naccomplish this task, we propose LMAffordance3D, the first multi-modal,\nlanguage-guided 3D affordance grounding network, which applies a\nvision-language model to fuse 2D and 3D spatial features with semantic\nfeatures. Comprehensive experiments on AGPIL demonstrate the effectiveness and\nsuperiority of our method on this task, even in unseen experimental settings.\nOur project is available at https://sites.google.com/view/lmaffordance3d.",

It transfers the style of a reference image to a\nsource while preserving its content. Although advanced and promising, current\nmethods may reveal flaws when scrutinizing synthesized image details, often\nproducing blurred or incorrect textures, posing a significant challenge. Hence,\nwe introduce AnyArtisticGlyph, a diffusion-based, multilingual controllable\nartistic glyph generation model. It includes a font fusion and embedding\nmodule, which generates latent features for detailed structure creation, and a\nvision-text fusion and embedding module that uses the CLIP model to encode\nreferences and blends them with transformation caption embeddings for seamless\nglobal image generation. Moreover, we incorporate a coarse-grained\nfeature-level loss to enhance generation accuracy.

Analysis\nof the unWISE 12.0 $\\mu$m image, Spitzer 8.0 $\\mu$m image, and the Herschel\ncolumn density and temperature maps reveals two previously unreported\nhub-filament system candidates associated with the HII regions B2 and N98,\nwhich are powered by massive OB stars. This indirectly favours the\napplicability of a global non-isotropic collapse (GNIC) scenario for massive\nstar formation in N98 and B2. The position-position-velocity diagram of FUGIN\n$^{13}$CO(1-0) shows significant velocity variations from 61 to 53 km s$^{-1}$\ntoward areas between B2 and N98, where the magnetic field morphology exhibits\nsignificant curvature, and high velocity dispersion (i.e., 2.3--3.1 km\ns$^{-1}$) is observed. This may be explained by the expansion of the HII\nregions B2 and N98. The energy budget of the cloud, estimated using SOFIA/HAWC+\nand molecular line data, suggests that the magnetic field dominates over\nturbulence and gravity in G47. Furthermore, the radial column density and\nvelocity profiles of G47 display signatures of converging flows in a sheet-like\nstructure. The relative orientations between the magnetic field and local\ngravity suggest that G47 may undergo gravitational contraction along the\nmagnetic field lines once it becomes magnetically supercritical.",

In this paper, we propose a post-training quantization\nframework with W(1+1)A(1*4) configuration, where weights are quantized to 1 bit\nwith an additional 1 bit for fine-grain grouping and activations are quantized\nto 1 bit with a 4-fold increase in the number of channels. For weight\nquantization, we propose utilizing Hessian-aware fine-grained grouping along\nwith an EM-based quantization scheme. For activation quantization, we decompose\nINT4-quantized activations into a 4 * INT1 format equivalently and\nsimultaneously smooth the scaling factors based on quantization errors, which\nfurther reduces the quantization errors in activations. Our method surpasses\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) LLM quantization baselines on W2A4 across multiple\ntasks, pushing the boundaries of existing LLM quantization methods toward fully\nbinarized models.

To fill this gap, this paper\nintroduces the concept of Semantic Negative Sampling and exploreshow to\noptimize LLMs for high-quality, hard negative sampling. Specifically, we design\nan experimental pipeline that includes three main modules, profile generation,\nsemantic negative sampling, and semantic alignment, to verify the potential of\nLLM-driven hard negative sampling in enhancing the accuracy of collaborative\nfiltering (CF). Experimental results indicate that hard negative samples\ngenerated based on LLMs, when semantically aligned and integrated into CF, can\nsignificantly improve CF performance, although there is still a certain gap\ncompared to traditional negative sampling methods. Further analysis reveals\nthat this gap primarily arises from two major challenges: noisy samples and\nlack of behavioral constraints. To address these challenges, we propose a\nframework called HNLMRec, based on fine-tuning LLMs supervised by collaborative\nsignals. Experimental results show that this framework outperforms traditional\nnegative sampling and other LLM-driven recommendation methods across multiple\ndatasets, providing new solutions for empowering traditional RS with LLMs.\nAdditionally, we validate the excellent generalization ability of the LLM-based\nsemantic negative sampling method on new datasets, demonstrating its potential\nin alleviating issues such as data sparsity, popularity bias, and the problem\nof false hard negative samples.

Seventy years after the original publication, most\nstudies in FPUT chains still focus on long wavelength initial states similar to\nthe original paper. It is shown here that all characteristic features of the\nFPUT paradox are rendered even more striking if modes with short(er)\nwavelengths are evolved instead. Since not every normal mode leads to\nequipartition, we also provide a simple technique to predict which modes, and\nin what perturbation order, are excited starting from an initial mode (root) in\n$\\alpha$-FPUT chains. The excitation sequences associated with a root are then\nnumerically shown to spread energy at different speeds, leading to\nprethermalization regimes that become longer as a function of mode excitation\nnumber. This effect is visible in observables such as mode energies and\nspectral entropies and, surprisingly, also in the time evolution of invariant\nquantities such as Lyapunov times and Kolmogorov-Sinai entropies. Our findings\ngeneralize the original FPUT experiment, provide an original look at the\nparadox's source, and enrich the vast literature dedicated to studying\nequipartition in classical many-body systems.",

However, existing discretization methods\nstill suffer from significant information loss, resulting in a notable\nperformance gap compared to continuous representations. To overcome these\nlimitations, we propose two quantization-based discretization methods: Product\nQuantization (PQ) and Random Product Quantization (RPQ). PQ partitions the\noriginal feature space into multiple subspaces and independently quantizes each\nsub-vector, producing a fused set of discrete units that retain diverse\ninformation from different subspaces, thus mitigating the loss associated with\nsingle-cluster quantization. RPQ further enhances representation diversity by\nrandomly sampling a fixed proportion of feature dimensions multiple times to\nconstruct sub-vectors, thereby better capturing the variability in the data\ndistribution. Theoretical analysis shows that RPQ reduces the correlation\ncoefficient rho (where 0 <= rho <= 1) between sub-quantizers. Its quantization\nerror is lower-bounded by the product of rho and epsilon-kms, where epsilon-kms\ndenotes the quantization error of a single K-means quantizer. Experimental\nresults on a combined dataset built from LibriSpeech and ML-SUPERB show that PQ\nand RPQ outperform standard K-means discretization, achieving relative\nimprovements of 21.8 percent and 20.0 percent in WER on LibriSpeech, and 24.1\npercent and 19.6 percent in CER on ML-SUPERB, respectively.

In\nthis paper we will focus on the geometry of Ahlfors regular spaces, Metric\nMeasure spaces with an additional regularity condition. Historically, fractals\nhave been studied using different ideas of dimension which have all proven to\nbe unsatisfactory to some degree. The theory of complex dimensions, developed\nby M.L.

In X-rays, the\nsources show the fast variation features down to millisecond time scales, with\nthe prominent quasiperiodic oscillations (QPOs) around 0.1 Hz - tens of Hz in\nlight curves, however, physical origin of QPOs is still uncertain. FAST as the\nlargest radio telescope provides the opportunity to study fast variability of\nboth radio flux and polarization in microquasars. In the FAST observations from\n2020 - 2022, we reported the first evidence of radio subsecond quasi-periodic\noscillations of GRS 1915+105, providing the direct link between QPOs and the\ndynamics of relativistic jets.

    "abstract": "The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) accessed via black-box APIs\nintroduces a significant trust challenge: users pay for services based on\nadvertised model capabilities (e.g., size, performance), but providers may\ncovertly substitute the specified model with a cheaper, lower-quality\nalternative to reduce operational costs. This lack of transparency undermines\nfairness, erodes trust, and complicates reliable benchmarking. Detecting such\nsubstitutions is difficult due to the black-box nature, typically limiting\ninteraction to input-output queries. This paper formalizes the problem of model\nsubstitution detection in LLM APIs. We systematically evaluate existing\nverification techniques, including output-based statistical tests, benchmark\nevaluations, and log probability analysis, under various realistic attack\nscenarios like model quantization, randomized substitution, and benchmark\nevasion. Our findings reveal the limitations of methods relying solely on text\noutputs, especially against subtle or adaptive attacks. While log probability\nanalysis offers stronger guarantees when available, its accessibility is often\nlimited. We conclude by discussing the potential of hardware-based solutions\nlike Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) as a pathway towards provable model\nintegrity, highlighting the trade-offs between security, performance, and\nprovider adoption.

To this end, we propose a Text-Conditioned Multi-Grained\nContrast framework, dubbed TC-MGC. Specifically, our model employs a\nlanguage-video attention block to generate aggregated frame and video\nrepresentations conditioned on the word's and text's attention weights over\nframes.

We focus on a simplified variant of the\nTransformer architecture and consider both $n=\\mathrm{poly}(d)$ and\n$n=\\exp(\\Omega(d))$ number of training samples, where each sample is a $d$-size\nbinary string paired with the output of a basic majority function. Our analysis\ndemonstrates that even after $\\mathrm{poly}(d)$ gradient queries, the\ngeneralization error of the Transformer model still remains substantially\nlarge, growing exponentially with $d$. This work highlights fundamental\noptimization challenges in training Transformers for the simplest logical\nreasoning tasks and provides new insights into their theoretical limitations.",

We present a theoretical polarimetric study to evaluate the\npresence and nature of a potential millimeter flare in M87*, using a suite of\ngeneral relativistic magnetohydrodynamical simulations with varying black hole\n(BH) spins and magnetic field configurations. We find that the emergence of a\nmillimeter flare is strongly influenced by both spin and magnetic structure,\nwith limited sensitivity to the electron distribution (thermal vs.\nnon-thermal). We model the intensity light curve with a damped random walk\n(DRW) and compare the characteristic timescale ($\\tau$) with recent SMA\nobservations, finding that the simulated $\\tau$ exceeds observed values by over\nan order of magnitude. In a flaring case with BH spin a=+0.5, we identify a\ndistinct millimeter flare followed by an order-of-magnitude flux drop. All\nStokes parameters show variability near the flare, including a sign reversal in\nthe electric vector position angle. While most $\\beta_m$ modes remain stable,\nthe $EB$-correlation phase is highly sensitive to both the flare peak and\ndecay. We examine polarimetric signatures in photon sub-rings, focusing on\nmodes ns=0 and ns=1. The ns=0 signal closely matches the full image, while ns=1\nreveals distinct behaviors, highlighting the potential of space VLBI to isolate\nsub-ring features. Finally, we analyze the magnetic and velocity field\nevolution during the flare, finding that magnetic reconnection weakens during\nthe flux decay, and the clockwise velocity flow transitions into an\noutflow-dominated regime. These results suggest that transient radio\nvariability near flares encodes key information about black hole spin and\nmagnetic field structure, offering a novel probe into the physics of active\ngalactic nuclei.",

SEAL consists of an offline stage for extracting\nthe reasoning steering vector in the latent space, followed by an on-the-fly\ncalibration of the reasoning trace through representation intervention using\nthe steering vector. Notably, the steering vector exhibits strong\ntransferability across various tasks. Extensive experiments across multiple\nmodels (DeepSeek-R1-Distill and QwQ-32B-Preview) and benchmarks (Math500,\nGSM8K, LiveCodeBench) validate the effectiveness of SEAL, up to a 11%\nimprovement in accuracy while reducing reasoning tokens by 11.8% to 50.4%.

This limit poses\na significant challenge in multi-view representation learning. This paper\nproposes a novel multi-view clustering framework that introduces a disentangled\nvariational autoencoder that separates multi-view into shared and private\ninformation, i.e., consistency and complementarity information. We first learn\ninformative and consistent representations by maximizing mutual information\nacross different views through contrastive learning. This process will ignore\ncomplementary information. Then, we employ consistency inference constraints to\nexplicitly utilize complementary information when attempting to seek the\nconsistency of shared information across all views. Specifically, we perform a\nwithin-reconstruction using the private and shared information of each view and\na cross-reconstruction using the shared information of all views. The dual\nconsistency constraints are not only effective in improving the representation\nquality of data but also easy to extend to other scenarios, especially in\ncomplex multi-view scenes.

To learn policies that maximize the\nsatisfaction of a HyperLTL formula $\\phi$, we apply Skolemization to manage\nquantifier alternations and define quantitative robustness functions to shape\nrewards over execution traces of a Markov decision process with unknown\ntransitions. A suitable RL algorithm is then used to learn policies that\ncollectively maximize the expected reward and, consequently, increase the\nprobability of satisfying $\\phi$. We evaluate HYPRL on a diverse set of\nbenchmarks, including safety-aware planning, Deep Sea Treasure, and the Post\nCorrespondence Problem. We also compare with specification-driven baselines to\ndemonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of HYPRL.",

    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are a computationally efficient method to learn\nembeddings and classifications on graph data. However, GNN training has low\ncomputational intensity, making communication costs the bottleneck for\nscalability. Sparse-matrix dense-matrix multiplication (SpMM) is the core\ncomputational operation in full-graph training of GNNs. Previous work\nparallelizing this operation focused on sparsity-oblivious algorithms, where\nmatrix elements are communicated regardless of the sparsity pattern. This leads\nto a predictable communication pattern that can be overlapped with computation\nand enables the use of collective communication operations at the expense of\nwasting significant bandwidth by communicating unnecessary data. We develop\nsparsity-aware algorithms that tackle the communication bottlenecks in GNN\ntraining with three novel approaches. First, we communicate only the necessary\nmatrix elements. Second, we utilize a graph partitioning model to reorder the\nmatrix and drastically reduce the amount of communicated elements. Finally, we\naddress the high load imbalance in communication with a tailored partitioning\nmodel, which minimizes both the total communication volume and the maximum\nsending volume. We further couple these sparsity-exploiting approaches with a\ncommunication-avoiding approach (1.5D parallel SpMM) in which submatrices are\nreplicated to reduce communication. We explore the tradeoffs of these combined\noptimizations and show up to 14X improvement on 256 GPUs and on some instances\nreducing communication to almost zero resulting in a communication-free\nparallel training relative to a popular GNN framework based on\ncommunication-oblivious SpMM.",

Our analysis\nreveals that incorporating linear combinations of independent variables can\nsubstantially simplify the network architecture in representing the ridge\nfunctions.

The architecture strategically embeds active\nsubspace detection between KANs, where the active subspace method is used to\nidentify the primary ridge directions and the independent variables are\nadaptively projected onto these critical dimensions. The proposed asKAN is\nimplemented in an iterative way without increasing the number of neurons in the\noriginal KAN. The proposed method is validated through function fitting,\nsolving the Poisson equation, and reconstructing sound field.

We\ndemonstrated that structural identities can be derived to relate Green's\nfunctions of auxiliary fields, computed in the first-order formulation, to\nGreen's functions of composite fields in the second-order formulation. In YM\ntheory, these identities can be verified at the integrand level of the loop\nintegrals. For gravity, the path integral was obtained through the\nFaddeev-Senjanovi\\'c procedure. The Senjanovi\\'c determinant plays a key role\nin canceling tadpole-like contributions, which vanish in the dimensional\nregularization scheme but persist at finite temperature. Thus, the equivalence\nbetween the two formalisms is maintained at finite temperature. We also studied\nthe coupling to matter. In YM theory, we investigated both minimal and\nnon-minimal couplings. We derived first-order formulations, equivalent to the\nrespective second-order formulations, by employing a procedure that introduces\nLagrange multipliers (LM). This procedure can be easily generalized to gravity.\nWe also considered an alternative gravity model, which is both renormalizable\nand unitary, that uses LM to restrict the loop expansion to one-loop order.\nHowever, this approach leads to a doubling of one-loop contributions due to the\nadditional degrees of freedom associated with Ostrogradsky instabilities. To\naddress this, we proposed a modified formalism that resolves these issues by\nrequiring the path integral to be invariant under field redefinitions. This\nintroduces ghost fields responsible for canceling the extra one-loop\ncontributions arising from the LM fields, while also removing unphysical\ndegrees of freedom. We also demonstrated that the modified formalism and the\nFaddeev-Popov procedure commute, indicating that the LM can be viewed as purely\nquantum fields.",

    "abstract": "Compared to overlay-based tensor architectures like VTA or Gemmini, compilers\nthat directly translate machine learning models into a dataflow architecture as\nHLS code, such as HLS4ML and FINN, generally can achieve lower latency by\ngenerating customized matrix-vector multipliers and memory structures tailored\nto the specific fundamental tensor operations required by each layer. However,\nthis approach has significant drawbacks: the compilation process is highly\ntime-consuming and the resulting deployments have unpredictable area and\nlatency, making it impractical to constrain the latency while simultaneously\nminimizing area. Currently, no existing methods address this type of\noptimization. In this paper, we present N-TORC (Native Tensor Optimizer for\nReal-Time Constraints), a novel approach that utilizes data-driven performance\nand resource models to optimize individual layers of a dataflow architecture.\nWhen combined with model hyperparameter optimization, N-TORC can quickly\ngenerate architectures that satisfy latency constraints while simultaneously\noptimizing for both accuracy and resource cost (i.e. offering a set of optimal\ntrade-offs between cost and accuracy). To demonstrate its effectiveness, we\napplied this framework to a cyber-physical application, DROPBEAR (Dynamic\nReproduction of Projectiles in Ballistic Environments for Advanced Research).\nN-TORC's HLS4ML performance and resource models achieve higher accuracy than\nprior efforts, and its Mixed Integer Program (MIP)-based solver generates\nequivalent solutions to a stochastic search in 1000X less time.",

However, most LIC approaches operate mainly in\nthe spatial domain and lack mechanisms for reducing frequency-domain\ncorrelations. To address this, we propose a novel framework that integrates\nlow-complexity 3D multi-level Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) into\nconvolutional layers and entropy coding, reducing both spatial and channel\ncorrelations to improve frequency selectivity and rate-distortion (R-D)\nperformance.\n  Our proposed 3D multi-level wavelet-domain convolution (3DM-WeConv) layer\nfirst applies 3D multi-level DWT (e.g., 5/3 and 9/7 wavelets from JPEG 2000) to\ntransform data into the wavelet domain. Then, different-sized convolutions are\napplied to different frequency subbands, followed by inverse 3D DWT to restore\nthe spatial domain. The 3DM-WeConv layer can be flexibly used within existing\nCNN-based LIC models.\n  We also introduce a 3D wavelet-domain channel-wise autoregressive entropy\nmodel (3DWeChARM), which performs slice-based entropy coding in the 3D DWT\ndomain. Low-frequency (LF) slices are encoded first to provide priors for\nhigh-frequency (HF) slices.\n  A two-step training strategy is adopted: first balancing LF and HF rates,\nthen fine-tuning with separate weights.\n  Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework consistently outperforms\nstate-of-the-art CNN-based LIC methods in R-D performance and computational\ncomplexity, with larger gains for high-resolution images. On the Kodak, Tecnick\n100, and CLIC test sets, our method achieves BD-Rate reductions of -12.24%,\n-15.51%, and -12.97%, respectively, compared to H.266/VVC.",

    "abstract": "The adaptive derivative-assembled problem-tailored variational quantum\neigensolver (ADAPT-VQE) is one of the most widely used algorithms for\nelectronic structure calculations in quantum computers. It adaptively selects\noperators based on their gradient, constructing ans\\\"atze that continuously\nevolve to match the energy landscape, helping avoid local traps and barren\nplateaus. However, this flexibility in reoptimization can lead to the inclusion\nof redundant or inefficient operators that have almost zero parameter value,\nbarely contributing to the ansatz. We identify three phenomena responsible for\nthe appearance of these operators: poor operator selection, operator\nreordering, and fading operators. In this work, we propose an automated,\ncost-free refinement method that removes unnecessary operators from the ansatz\nwithout disrupting convergence. Our approach evaluates each operator after\nADAPT-VQE optimization by using a function that considers both its parameter\nvalue and position in the ansatz, striking a balance between eliminating\nlow-coefficient operators while preserving the natural reduction of\ncoefficients as the ansatz grows. Additionally, a dynamic threshold based on\nthe parameters of recent operators enables efficient convergence. We apply this\nmethod to several molecular systems and find that it reduces ansatz size and\naccelerates convergence, particularly in cases with flat energy landscapes.

The results, for the first\ntime, provide quantitative measurements of 3D magnetic reconnection in strongly\nturbulent flare CSs, offering insights into the cascading laws of 3D\nreconnection in other turbulent plasmas.",

    "abstract": "In the real world, long-tailed data distributions are prevalent, making it\nchallenging for models to effectively learn and classify tail classes. However,\nwe discover that in the field of drug chemistry, certain tail classes exhibit\nhigher identifiability during training due to their unique molecular structural\nfeatures, a finding that significantly contrasts with the conventional\nunderstanding that tail classes are generally difficult to identify. Existing\nimbalance learning methods, such as resampling and cost-sensitive reweighting,\noverly rely on sample quantity priors, causing models to excessively focus on\ntail classes at the expense of head class performance. To address this issue,\nwe propose a novel method that breaks away from the traditional static\nevaluation paradigm based on sample size. Instead, we establish a dynamical\ninter-class separability metric using feature distances between different\nclasses. Specifically, we employ a sub-clustering contrastive learning approach\nto thoroughly learn the embedding features of each class, and we dynamically\ncompute the distances between class embeddings to capture the relative\npositional evolution of samples from different classes in the feature space,\nthereby rebalancing the weights of the classification loss function. We\nconducted experiments on multiple existing long-tailed drug datasets and\nachieved competitive results by improving the accuracy of tail classes without\ncompromising the performance of dominant classes.",

    "abstract": "Baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic\nInstrument (DESI) appear to indicate the first evidence for dynamical dark\nenergy (DDE), with a present-day behavior resembling quintessence. This\nevidence emerges when the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrization of\nthe dark energy equation of state, $w_{\\textrm{de}} = w_0 + w_a (1-a)$, is\nconsidered, and persists across other functional forms of $w_{\\textrm{de}}$. In\nthis work, we investigate how the inclusion of future gravitational wave (GW)\nstandard siren data impacts the uncertainties in cosmological parameters when\ncombined with DESI measurements. Specifically, we analyze the expected\ncontributions from three upcoming GW observatories: the Einstein Telescope\n(ET), the Deci-hertz Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (DECIGO),\nand the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO). We find\nthat the addition of GW data, particularly from LIGO and DECIGO, significantly\nreduces the uncertainties in cosmological parameters, with the extent of the\nimprovement depending on the specific form of $w_{\\textrm{de}}$. Our results\nhighlight both the constraining power of future GW observations and the\nimportance of considering a range of cosmological models in data analysis.",
