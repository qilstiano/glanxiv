    "abstract": "Despite a growing need for spiritual care in the US, it is often\nunder-served, inaccessible, or misunderstood, while almost no prior work in\nCSCW/HCI research has engaged with professional chaplains and spiritual care\nproviders. This interdisciplinary study aims to develop a foundational\nunderstanding of how spiritual care may (or may not) be expanded into online\nspaces -- especially focusing on anonymous, asynchronous, and text-based online\ncommunities. We conducted an exploratory mixed-methods study with chaplains\n(N=22) involving interviews and user testing sessions centered around Reddit\nsupport communities to understand participants' perspectives on technology and\ntheir ideations about the role of chaplaincy in prospective Online Spiritual\nCare Communities (OSCCs). Our Grounded Theory Method analysis highlighted\nbenefits of OSCCs including: meeting patients where they are at; accessibility\nand scalability; and facilitating patient-initiated care. Chaplains highlighted\nhow their presence in OSCCs could help with shaping peer interactions,\nmoderation, synchronous chats for group care, and redirecting to external\nresources, while also raising important feasibility concerns, risks, and needs\nfor future design and research. We used an existing taxonomy of chaplaincy\ntechniques to show that some spiritual care strategies may be amenable to\nonline spaces, yet we also exposed the limitations of technology to fully\nmediate spiritual care and the need to develop new online chaplaincy\ninterventions. Based on these findings, we contribute the model of a ``Care\nLoop'' between institutionally-based formal care and platform-based community\ncare to expand access and drive greater awareness and utilization of spiritual\ncare. We also contribute design implications to guide future work in online\nspiritual care.",

Unlike static kernels\nsuch as NTK, the LPK captures the entire training trajectory, adapting to both\ndata and optimization dynamics, leading to tighter and more informative\ngeneralization guarantees. Moreover, the bound highlights how the norm of the\ntraining loss gradients along the optimization trajectory influences the final\ngeneralization performance.

The dynamic antenna is designed and\nfabricated on a single layer of Rogers RO4350B which provides a miniaturized\nplanar size of $0.36 \\times 0.5 , \\lambda_0^2$ at 2.7 GHz and easy integration.\nTo validate the wireless communication performance, the fabricated antenna is\ndirectly fed with a 10 dB power ratio by a radio frequency (RF) switching\nsystem and evaluated for 16-QAM and 256-QAM transmission in a high\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR) environment. Experimental results demonstrate that\nfor 16-QAM transmission, a narrow E-plane information beam (IB) of\napproximately $34^\\circ$ and omnidirectional H-plane IB are obtained, and a\nnarrower E-plane IB is achieved around $15^\\circ$ for 256-QAM. These results\nconfirm that the proposed antenna offers a simple yet effective approach to\nenhance planar physical information security with a compact dynamic antenna\nsystem.",

The complete weight distribution has a wide\nrange of applications in many research fields as the information it contains is\nof vital use in practical applications. Unfortunately, obtaining these\ndistributions is in general a very hard problem that normally involves the\nevaluation of sophisticated exponential sums, which leaves this problem open\nfor most of the cyclic codes.

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks often learn and rely on spurious correlations, i.e.,\nsuperficial associations between non-causal features and the targets. For\ninstance, an image classifier may identify camels based on the desert\nbackgrounds. While it can yield high overall accuracy during training, it\ndegrades generalization on more diverse scenarios where such correlations do\nnot hold. This problem poses significant challenges for out-of-distribution\nrobustness and trustworthiness. Existing methods typically mitigate this issue\nby using external group annotations or auxiliary deterministic models to learn\nunbiased representations. However, such information is costly to obtain, and\ndeterministic models may fail to capture the full spectrum of biases learned by\nthe models. To address these limitations, we propose Evidential Alignment, a\nnovel framework that leverages uncertainty quantification to understand the\nbehavior of the biased models without requiring group annotations. By\nquantifying the evidence of model prediction with second-order risk\nminimization and calibrating the biased models with the proposed evidential\ncalibration technique, Evidential Alignment identifies and suppresses spurious\ncorrelations while preserving core features. We theoretically justify the\neffectiveness of our method as capable of learning the patterns of biased\nmodels and debiasing the model without requiring any spurious correlation\nannotations.

    "abstract": "The solutions to many problems in the mathematical, computational, and\nphysical sciences often involve multidimensional integrals. A direct numerical\nevaluation of the integral incurs a computational cost that is exponential in\nthe number of dimensions, a phenomenon called the curse of dimensionality. The\nproblem is so substantial that one usually employs sampling methods, like Monte\nCarlo, to avoid integration altogether. Here, we derive and implement a quantum\nalgorithm to compress a multidimensional integrand into a product of\nmatrix-valued functions - a spectral tensor train - changing the computational\ncomplexity of integration from exponential to polynomial. The algorithm\ncompresses the integrand by applying a sequence of quantum gates to an\nunentangled quantum state, where each term corresponds to a body-ordered term\nin the potential. Because it allows for the systematic elimination of small\ncontributions to the integral through decimation, we call the method integral\ndecimation. The functions in the spectral basis are analytically differentiable\nand integrable, and in applications to the partition function, integral\ndecimation numerically factorizes an interacting system into a product of\nnoninteracting ones. We illustrate integral decimation by evaluating the\nabsolute free energy and entropy of a chiral XY model as a continuous function\nof temperature. We also compute the nonequilibrium time-dependent reduced\ndensity matrix of a quantum chain with between two and forty levels, each\ncoupled to colored noise. When other methods provide numerical solutions to\nthese models, they quantitatively agree with integral decimation.

We present a 3D non-ideal magnetohydrodynamic simulation\nof jet launching in YSOs, focusing on the interaction between the stellar\nmagnetosphere and the circumstellar disk. At the beginning of the simulation,\nthe magnetosphere partially opens, forming two oppositely directed magnetic\nfield regions: one threading the star and the other threading the inner disk.\nThe latter dominates over the original disk field at small radii and\ncontributes to launching a disk wind. In our model, the jet is launched from\nthe interface between these regions by toroidal magnetic pressure generated\nalong ``two-legged'' field lines, anchored at a magnetically dominated stellar\nfootpoint and a mass-dominated point on the disk surface. Outflows are driven\nalong these lines via a ``load-fire-reload'' cycle: in the ``load'' stage,\ndifferential rotation between the stellar and disk footpoints generates a\ntoroidal magnetic field; in the ``fire'' stage, vertical gradients in toroidal\nfield strength drive the outflow and release magnetic energy; and in the\n``reload'' stage, magnetic reconnection between oppositely directed field lines\nresets the configuration, enabling the cycle to repeat. This process occurs\nrapidly and asynchronously across azimuthal angles, producing a continuous,\nlarge-scale outflow. From an energetic perspective, Poynting flux transports\nthe toroidal field from the vicinity of the star into the polar cavity,\npowering the jet. Comparison with a disk-only model shows that the rotating\nstellar magnetosphere promotes bipolar jet launching by shaping a magnetic\nfield geometry favorable to symmetric outflows.",

Thanks to HW-NAS, a 1D convolutional\nneural network (CNN) is tailored on the ISCX VPN-nonVPN dataset to meet strict\nmemory and computational limits while achieving robust performance. The\noptimized model attains an accuracy of 96.59% with just 88.26K parameters,\n10.08M FLOPs, and a maximum tensor size of 20.12K. Compared to state-of-the-art\nmodels, it achieves reductions of up to 444-fold, 312-fold, and 15.6-fold in\nthese metrics, respectively, significantly minimizing memory footprint and\nruntime requirements. The model also demonstrates versatility in classification\ntasks, achieving accuracies of up to 99.64% in VPN differentiation, VPN-type\nclassification, broader traffic categories, and application identification. In\naddition, an in-depth approach to header-level preprocessing strategies\nconfirms that the optimized model can provide notable performances across a\nwide range of configurations, even in scenarios with stricter privacy\nconsiderations. Likewise, a reduction in the length of sessions of up to 75%\nyields significant improvements in efficiency, while maintaining high accuracy\nwith only a negligible drop of 1-2%. However, the importance of careful\npreprocessing and session length selection in the classification of raw traffic\ndata is still present, as improper settings or aggressive reductions can bring\nabout a 7% reduction in overall accuracy. Those results highlight the method's\neffectiveness in enforcing cybersecurity for IoT networks, by providing\nscalable, efficient solutions for the real-time analysis of encrypted traffic\nwithin strict hardware limitations.",

We provide\ntheoretical analysis of a variance estimator that addresses key limitations in\nthe existing literature. While Abadie and Imbens (2006) proposed a foundational\nvariance estimator requiring matching for both treatment and control groups,\nthis approach is computationally prohibitive and rarely used in practice. Our\nmethod provides a computationally feasible alternative that only requires\nmatching treated units to controls while maintaining theoretical validity for\npopulation inference.\n  We make three main contributions. First, we establish consistency and\nasymptotic normality for our variance estimator, proving its validity for\naverage treatment effect on the treated (ATT) estimation in settings with small\ntreated samples. Second, we develop a generalized theoretical framework with\nnovel regularity conditions that significantly expand the class of matching\nprocedures for which valid inference is available, including radius matching,\nM-nearest neighbor matching, and propensity score matching. Third, we\ndemonstrate that our approach extends naturally to other causal inference\nestimators such as stable balancing weighting methods.\n  Through simulation studies across different data generating processes, we\nshow that our estimator maintains proper coverage rates while the\nstate-of-the-art bootstrap method can exhibit substantial undercoverage\n(dropping from 95% to as low as 61%), particularly in settings with extensive\ncontrol unit reuse.

This makes them ideal laboratories to study feedback effects on\nthe overall energy and baryonic mass budget. We study the LOFAR-detected galaxy\ngroup Nest200047, where there is clear evidence of multiple generations of\nradio lobes from the AGN. Using 140 ks Chandra and 25 ks XMM-Newton data, we\ninvestigate thermodynamic properties of the the intragroup medium including any\nexcess energy due to the central AGN. We also investigate X-ray properties of\nthe central black hole and constrain the $2-10$ keV X-ray flux. We used\nspectral analysis techniques to measure various thermodynamic profiles across\nthe whole field of view. We also used both imaging and spectral analysis to\ndetect and estimate the energy deposited by potential shocks and cavities. Due\nto the faint emission from the object beyond the core, various background\neffects were considered. Nest200047 has significant excess entropy, and the AGN\nlikely contributes to a part of it. There is an excess energy of $(5-6.5)\n\\times 10^{60}$ erg within 400 kpc, exceeding the binding energy. The pressure\nprofile indicates that gas is likely being ejected from the system, resulting\nin a baryon fraction of $\\sim4\\%$ inside $r_{500}$. From scaling relations, we\nestimate a black hole mass of $(1-4)\\times 10^9 M_{\\odot}$. An upper limit of\n$2.1 \\times 10^{40}$ erg s$^{-1}$ was derived on the black hole bolometric\nluminosity, which is $\\sim$2.5% of the Bondi accretion power. Nest200047 is\nlikely part of a class of over-heated galaxy groups like ESO 3060170, AWM 4 and\nAWM 5.

A well-designed experiment can produce data\nthat are much more informative for the purpose of inferring parameter values\nthan a poorly designed experiment. It is, therefore, of great interest to\noptimally design experiments such that the resulting data maximise the\npractical identifiability of a chosen model. Experimental design is also useful\nfor model discrimination, where we seek to distinguish between multiple\ndistinct, competing models of the same biological system in order to determine\nwhich model better reveals insight into the underlying biological mechanisms.\nIn many cases, an external stimulus can be used as a control input to probe the\nbehaviour of the system. In this paper, we will explore techniques for\noptimally designing such a control for a given experiment, in order to maximise\nparameter identifiability and model discrimination, and demonstrate these\ntechniques in the context of commonly applied ordinary differential equation\nmodels. We use a profile likelihood-based approach to assess parameter\nidentifiability.

With over 21,000 vulnerabilities disclosed in 2025, manual\nanalysis is infeasible, making scalable and verifiable AI support critical.\nWhen querying LLMs, dealing with emerging vulnerabilities is challenging as\nthey have a training cut-off date. While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)\ncan inject up-to-date context to alleviate the cut-off date limitation, it\nremains unclear how much LLMs rely on retrieved evidence versus the model's\ninternal knowledge, and whether the retrieved information is meaningful or even\ncorrect.

Therefore, this work proposes LLM\nEmbedding-based Attribution (LEA) to analyze the generated responses for\nvulnerability exploitation analysis. More specifically, LEA quantifies the\nrelative contribution of internal knowledge vs. retrieved content in the\ngenerated responses. We evaluate LEA on 500 critical vulnerabilities disclosed\nbetween 2016 and 2025, across three RAG settings -- valid, generic, and\nincorrect -- using three state-of-the-art LLMs. Our results demonstrate LEA's\nability to detect clear distinctions between non-retrieval, generic-retrieval,\nand valid-retrieval scenarios with over 95% accuracy on larger models. Finally,\nwe demonstrate the limitations posed by incorrect retrieval of vulnerability\ninformation and raise a cautionary note to the cybersecurity community\nregarding the blind reliance on LLMs and RAG for vulnerability analysis.

    "abstract": "Seismology has entered the petabyte era, driven by decades of continuous\nrecordings of broadband networks, the increase in nodal seismic experiments,\nand the recent emergence of Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS). This review\nexplains how commercial clouds - AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure - by providing\nobject storage, elastic compute, and managed databases, enable researchers to\n\"bring the code to the data,\" thereby overcoming traditional HPC solutions'\nbandwidth and capacity limitations. After literature reviews of cloud concepts\nand their research applications in seismology, we illustrate the capacities of\ncloud-native workflows using two canonical end-to-end demonstrations: 1)\nambient noise seismology and cross-correlation, and 2) earthquake detection,\ndiscrimination, and phase picking. Both workflows utilized S3 for streaming I/O\nand DocumentDB for provenance, demonstrating that cloud throughput can rival\non-premises HPC at comparable costs, scanning 100 TBs to 1.3 PBs of seismic\ndata in a few hours or days of processing. The review also discusses research\nand education initiatives, the reproducibility benefits of containers, and cost\npitfalls (e.g., egress, I/O fees) of energy-intensive seismological research\ncomputing. While designing cloud pipelines remains non-trivial, partnerships\nwith research software engineers enable converting domain code into scalable,\nautomated, and environmentally conscious solutions for next-generation\nseismology.",

Spectra verify that the star is a cataclysmic variable\n(CV). Using new and archival photometry, we confirm that ASASSN-19ds is an\neclipsing binary with an orbital period of 0.139 days (3.34 hr). Moreover, its\nout-of-eclipse brightness shows a \"sawtooth\" light curve with an amplitude of\n$\\sim$1~mag and an interval between peaks that varies between about three to\nnearly five weeks. Its mean absolute magnitude in the Gaia system is\n$M_G=+6.5$. These combined properties lead to a classification of ASASSN-19ds\nas a Z Camelopardalis-type CV. We obtained deep narrow-band images of the\nnebulosity, using modest-sized telescopes and extremely long exposure times.\nOur imagery reveals a bipolar morphology, with thin arcs at the ends of the\nmajor axis, likely indicating an interaction with the interstellar medium. We\nconsider several scenarios for the origin of the nebula, but from the existing\ninformation we are unable to distinguish between it being ejecta from an\nunobserved classical-nova outburst several centuries ago, or an ancient\nplanetary nebula. Future observations should be able to decide between these\npossibilities. At the star's distance of only $\\sim$557 pc, a nova eruption\nwould have been a spectacular naked-eye event.",

These challenges have renewed interest in RNN-like architectures,\nwhich offer linear scaling with sequence length and improved handling of\nlong-range dependencies, albeit with limited parallelism due to their\ninherently recurrent nature. In this paper, we propose Avey, a new neural\nfoundational architecture that breaks away from both attention and recurrence.\nAvey comprises a ranker and an autoregressive neural processor, which\ncollaboratively identify and contextualize only the most relevant tokens for\nany given token, regardless of their positions in the sequence.

Here we compared the\nperformance of diffusion- and non-diffusion-based deep learning models for the\nMRI-to-PET image translation task for epilepsy imaging using simultaneous\nPET/MRI in 52 subjects (40 train/2 validate/10 hold-out test). We tested three\ndifferent models: 2 score-based generative diffusion models (SGM-Karras\nDiffusion [SGM-KD] and SGM-variance preserving [SGM-VP]) and a\nTransformer-Unet. We report results on standard image processing metrics as\nwell as clinically relevant metrics, including congruency measures (Congruence\nIndex and Congruency Mean Absolute Error) that assess hemispheric metabolic\nasymmetry, which is a key part of the clinical analysis of these images. The\nSGM-KD produced the best qualitative and quantitative results when synthesizing\nPET purely from T1w and T2 FLAIR images with the least mean absolute error in\nwhole-brain specific uptake value ratio (SUVR) and highest intraclass\ncorrelation coefficient. When 1% low-dose PET images are included in the\ninputs, all models improve significantly and are interchangeable for\nquantitative performance and visual quality.

Since the fluid velocity is coupled to\nthe surfactant concentration, the advection-diffusion equation governing the\nbulk surfactant concentration $C$ is nonlinear, precluding the Green's function\nformulation necessary for a BI method. However, in the physically\nrepresentative large P\\'eclet number limit, an analytical reduction of the\nsurfactant dynamics permits a Green's function formulation for $C$ as an\nAbel-type time-convolution integral at each Lagrangian interface point. A\nchallenge in developing a practical numerical method based on this formulation\nis the fast evaluation of the time convolution, since the kernel depends on the\ntime history of quantities at the interface, which is only found during the\ntime-stepping process. To address this, we develop a novel, causal version of\nthe Fast Multipole Method that reduces the computational cost from $O(P^2)$ for\ndirect evaluation of the time convolution to $O(P \\log_2^2 P)$ per surface grid\npoint, where $P$ is the number of time steps.

    "abstract": "Quantum error mitigation (QEM) for dynamic circuits, i.e., those\nincorporating mid-circuit measurements and feedforward, is important for two\nkey reasons. First, quantum error correction (QEC) circuits are instances of\ndynamic circuits, and therefore a dynamic circuit-compatible QEM can extend\ncircuit depth and address errors that QEC struggles with. Second, recent\nstudies show that dynamic circuits can significantly outperform purely unitary\nones. However, mid-circuit measurement errors remain a major bottleneck.\nCurrent solutions rely on readout noise characterization that is vulnerable to\ntemporal noise drifts. To the best of our knowledge, no readout mitigation\nschemes are resilient to temporal noise drifts. By introducing parity-based\nnoise amplification in repeated measurements, we derive and experimentally\ndemonstrate a drift-resilient protocol for addressing preparation, mid-circuit,\nand terminating measurement errors without requiring calibration or\ncharacterization. Drift resilience increases the longest possible execution\ntime (in terms of shots) and enables flexibility by combining data from\nnon-consecutive times. For platforms such as trapped ions, where the\nmeasurements are highly disruptive, we provide an alternative reset-based\nmitigation scheme. We demonstrate our methods experimentally on IBMQ and\nQuantinuum hardware. Combined with the Layered-KIK gate error mitigation\nprotocol, the presented readout mitigation approach enables \"End-to-end\"\nmitigation for dynamic circuits, that can improve the outcomes of QEC\nexperiments, and that covers the widest range of errors to the best of our\nknowledge. Other applications of the presented methods include a faster\nalternative to gate-set tomography and diagnostics of defective qubits during\nthe execution of the target algorithm.",

In\nenterprise deployments these systems need to interact with API collections that\ncan be extremely large and complex, often backed by databases. In order to\ncreate datasets with such characteristics, we explore how existing NL2SQL\n(Natural Language to SQL query) datasets can be used to automatically create\nNL2API datasets. Specifically, this work describes a novel data generation\npipeline that exploits the syntax of SQL queries to construct a functionally\nequivalent sequence of API calls. We apply this pipeline to one of the largest\nNL2SQL datasets, BIRD-SQL to create a collection of over 2500 APIs that can be\nserved as invocable tools or REST-endpoints. We pair natural language queries\nfrom BIRD-SQL to ground-truth API sequences based on this API pool. We use this\ncollection to study the performance of 10 public LLMs and find that all models\nstruggle to determine the right set of tools (consisting of tasks of intent\ndetection, sequencing with nested function calls, and slot-filling). We find\nthat models have extremely low task completion rates (7-47 percent - depending\non the dataset) which marginally improves to 50 percent when models are\nemployed as ReACT agents that interact with the live API environment. The best\ntask completion rates are far below what may be required for effective\ngeneral-use tool-calling agents, suggesting substantial scope for improvement\nin current state-of-the-art tool-calling LLMs. We also conduct detailed\nablation studies, such as assessing the impact of the number of tools available\nas well as the impact of tool and slot-name obfuscation.

We validate our formulae on three\nnon-trivial space-time metrics: two of them are null tests on metrics which are\nobtained by applying a gauge transformation to the background space-time, while\nthe third is the \"separate universe\" curved background, for which we can also\ncompute the observables exactly. We then illustrate the results by evaluating\nthe second-order observables in a simplified symmetric setup. On large scales,\nthey are suppressed over the linear contributions by $\\sim 10^{-4}$, while they\nbecome comparable to the linear contributions on mildly non-linear scales. The\nresults of this paper form a significant (and the most complicated) part of the\nrelativistic galaxy number density at second order.",

Our results reveal that TSFMs exhibit \\emph{limited}\ngeneralizability, performing only marginally better than statistical models on\nunseen datasets and modalities for univariate forecasting. Similarly, inclusion\nof covariates in TSFMs does not yield performance improvements, and their\nperformance remains inferior to conventional models that utilize covariates.\nWhile TSFMs generate effective zero-shot representations for downstream\nclassification tasks, they may remain inferior to statistical models in\nforecasting when statistical models perform test-time fitting. Moreover, TSFMs\nforecasting performance is sensitive to evaluation metrics, and they struggle\nin more complex building environments compared to statistical models.

While prior works utilized YOLO (You Only Look Once) for vehicle\nspeed detection, they often lacked accuracy, failed to identify vehicle lanes,\nand offered limited or less practical classification categories. This study\nintroduces a fine-tuned YOLOv11 model, trained on almost 800 bird's-eye view\nimages, to enhance vehicle speed detection accuracy which is much higher\ncompare to the previous works.

Recent studies have suggested that these\nPBHs may be the progenitors to the population of high-redshift, supermassive\nblack holes (SMBHs) observed since the launch of JWST. For the first time, we\nhave included PBHs in cosmological simulations, to test whether PBHs can sink\nto the center of collapsing halos, locate dense gaseous regions and experience\nsignificant growth. We tested PBH-to-DM mass ratios of $f_{\\rm PBH}$ =\n$10^{-4}$ and $10^{-3}$, with an initial PBH mass of 1000 M$_\\odot$, as\ninspired by recent observational constraints. We find that at $f_{\\rm PBH} =\n10^{-3}$, a number of PBHs were able to embed themselves in dense gas and grow\nto $10^{4}$-$10^{5}$ M$_\\odot$ by $z=20$. These intermediate black holes\n(IMBHs) are possible progenitors to the highest redshift SMBH observations such\nas GNZ-11 ($10^{6}$ M$_\\odot$ by $z=10$), outperforming light seed black hole\n(BH) growth seen in recent simulations without the need to invoke heavy seeding\nprescriptions. On the other hand, $f_{\\rm PBH} = 10^{-4}$ resulted in no\nsignificant BH growth, emphasizing that the ability of PBHs to act as SMBH\nseeds is sensitive to the true value of $f_{\\rm PBH}$ in the Universe, and\nshowing that the $f_{\\rm PBH} =10^{-4}-10^{-3}$ boundary marks the threshold\nabove which SMBH seeding via 1000 M$_\\odot$ PBHs becomes effective. This is the\nfirst step towards building a realistic PBH framework in cosmological\nsimulations.",

This behavior\nreveals a unique mechanism of symmetry breaking in quasiperiodic lattices,\nwhere geometric frustration and local environment effects compete to determine\nthe magnetic ground state. Our results show how long-range order adapts to\nnon-periodic structures, with implications for understanding nematic phases and\nother broken-symmetry states in quasicrystals.",

K-means (or k-modes, for categorical\ndata) is one of the most commonly used clustering methods in PER. This\nalgorithm, however, is not model-based: it relies on algorithmic partitioning\nand assigns individuals to subgroups with definite membership. Researchers must\nalso conduct post-hoc analyses to relate subgroup membership to other\nvariables. Mixture models offer a model-based alternative that accounts for\nclassification errors and allows researchers to directly integrate subgroup\nmembership into a broader latent variable framework.

However, these materials\nfrequently exhibit instability in two respects: 1) a preference for structures\ncontaining one-dimensional edge- or face-sharing octahedral networks instead of\nthe three-dimensional corner-sharing perovskite framework (polymorphic\ninstability), and (2) a tendency to decompose into competing compositions (hull\ninstability). We evaluate the stability of 81 ABS3 compounds using Density\nFunctional Theory, finding that only BaZrS3 and BaHfS3 are both polymorphically\nand hull stable, with the NH4CdCl3-type structure being the preferred polymorph\nfor 77% of these compounds. Comparison with existing tolerance factor models\ndemonstrates that these approaches work well for known perovskites but\noverpredict stability for compositions without published experimental results.\nPolymorphic stability analysis reveals that perovskite structures are\nstabilized by strong B-S bonding interactions, while needle structures exhibit\nminimal B-S covalency, suggesting that electrostatic rather than covalent\ninteractions drive the preference for edge-sharing motifs. Hull stability\nanalysis comparing ABS3 to ABO3 analogues reveals a weaker inductive effect in\nsulfides as a possible explanation for the scarcity of sulfides compared with\noxides. The relative instability of ABS3 compounds is further supported by\nexperimental synthesis attempts. These findings provide fundamental insights\ninto the origins of instability in chalcogenide perovskites and highlight the\nchallenges in expanding this promising materials class beyond the few materials\nthat have been reported to date.",

Another challenge\narises from the limitations of traditional methods like exact diagonalization\n(ED). For the past decade, neural networks (NN) have shown promise in\napproximating many-body wavefunctions, yet their application to NH systems\nremains largely unexplored.

    "abstract": "Numerous studies have established that the environment influences the\nphysical properties of a galaxy. While gas inflows supply the fuel for SF, high\ndensity and temperature conditions suppress SF activity through various\nquenching processes. Investigations into large scale structures, such as\nfilaments and overdense regions in the cluster outskirts, have focused on the\nlow z. To move to intermediate z and explore galaxy pathways combined with\nenvironmental effects, it is crucial to join wide field spectroscopy and deep\nphotometry. Our primary objective is to spectroscopically analyze the\nphotometric overdensities observed by Estrada et al.(2023) in the outskirts of\nmassive cluster MACS J0416.1-2403 (z=0.397), interpreted as evidence of ongoing\ngroup infall, i.e. the pre processing scenario, and to investigate the behavior\nof galaxies in the outskirts about their g-r color, Mstar, and local density,\nemphasizing the influence of the environment on galaxy evolution. We conducted\na spectroscopic analysis out to 5.5R200, using the AAOmega spectrograph. The\nlarge FoV and depth allowed us to explore galaxies up to the cluster periphery\nand across a wide Mstar range, reaching down to the limit of dwarf galaxies.\nRedshifts were obtained through independent but comparable methods: Redrock,\nEZ, and Redmost. We identified 148 new spectroscopic cluster members from a\nsample of 1236 objects. We found 81 galaxies located in filamentary and\noverdense regions, supporting the role of filamentary infall in the cluster\nmass assembly history. Our analysis revealed that galaxies in high density\nregions are more massive, redder, and more passive, compared to galaxies in low\ndensity regions that appear to be bluer, less massive, and more SF. These\nfindings underscore the significance of environmental effects and the role of\npre processing in shaping galaxy properties before cluster infall.",

In this paper, we study\nuser perceptions of \"untraceability\", i.e., preventing third parties from\ntracing who communicates with whom, with the goal of informing the design of\nprivacy-enhancing features in messaging platforms and untraceable communication\nprotocols that depend on large anonymity sets and widespread user adoption. We\nexplore this from a broad conceptual standpoint: rather than studying mental\nmodels of a particular solution, we analyze how users reason about what\nfeatures should be incorporated by two fictitious platforms, Texty and Chatty,\nto prevent third parties from knowing who communicates with whom. Through a\nvignette-based survey with 189 participants, we found that users associate the\nconcept of untraceability with a wide range of privacy enhancing technologies,\nimplying a diverse set of threat models. Overall, the features suggested by\nparticipants show awareness of privacy threats stemming from forms of\nsurveillance and unauthorized access to message contents. Many participants\nalso associated untraceability with the notion of anonymity, but interpreted it\nas senders and receivers concealing their identity from each other rather than\nonly from third parties. We discuss the gap between users' perceptions of\nuntraceability and the threat models addressed by untraceable communication\nprotocols, as well as how different privacy attitudes point to challenges and\nopportunities for the adoption of untraceable communication tools in messaging\nplatforms.",

    "abstract": "The discovery of fractional quantum anomalous Hall states in moir\\'e systems\nhas raised the interesting possibility of realizing phases of itenerant anyons.\nAnyon dispersion is only possible in the absence of continuous magnetic\ntranslation symmetry (CMTS). Motivated by this, we consider anyons on the\nsphere in the presence of a non-uniform magnetic field which breaks the ${\\rm\nSU}(2)$ rotation symmetry, the analog of CMTS on the sphere, down to a ${\\rm\nU}(1)$. This allows us to study the energy dispersion of the anyons as a\nfunction of $L_z$ angular-momentum, while maintaining the perfect flatness of\nsingle-particle dispersion. We parametrize the non-uniform field by a real\nparameter $R$ which concentrates the field at the north (south) pole for $R>1$\n($R < 1$), and show that, for our choice of field, any $p$-body correlation\nfunction evaluated in the space of Laughlin quasiholes can be mapped\n\\emph{exactly} to a corresponding $p$-body correlation function in uniform\nfield. In the thermodynamic limit, this enables us to analytically compute the\ninteraction-generated spatially varying potential felt by the anyons.\nRemarkably, such spatially varying potential is sufficient to generate\ndispersion for the anyons, which we compute exactly, up to an overall scaling\nconstant. The anyon dispersion in our model describes azimuthal motion around\nthe sphere at a constant height, similar to spin precession. Our work therefore\nserves as a concrete demonstration that interaction alone can generate nonzero\nanyon dispersion in the presence of inhomogeneous magnetic field.",

However, to simulate ENSO\nrealistically, careful choices must be made regarding the RO's key parameters.\nIn particular, nonlinear parameters govern how well the model reproduces key\nENSO asymmetries-El Ni\\~no events tend to be stronger but shorter-lived, often\ntransitioning into La Ni\\~na, whereas La Ni\\~na events are typically weaker but\nmore persistent, sometimes lasting into a second year or beyond. While\namplitude asymmetry has been widely studied within the RO framework, duration\nand transition asymmetries have received little attention, and their underlying\ncauses remain debated. In this study, by systematically exploring the RO\nparameter space-rather than relying on commonly used fitting methods-we\nidentify optimal parameter values that successfully capture key linear and\nnonlinear ENSO characteristics. An analytical expression for the\ntemperature-heat content anomaly slope shows that the choice of heat content\nvariable inherently reflects the sign of the Bjerknes feedback and the ocean\nadjustment timescale. We further show that self-sustained oscillations fail to\nreproduce the observed Nino 3 and 3.4 kurtosis. Finally, we demonstrate that\nincorporating red noise forcing distorts the RO simulated power spectrum and\nadd unnecessary complexity. The most realistic yet simplest RO configuration is\na strongly damped oscillator, with a decay timescale shorter than the dominant\nperiod, forced by multiplicative white noise and influenced by relatively weak\ndeterministic nonlinearities. Identifying these minimal components preserves\nthe conceptual clarity of the RO framework and isolates the core physical\nprocesses underlying ENSO behavior.",

Constraint-satisfying initial data for two\nequal-mass non-spinning sequences are constructed at fixed energy and various\ninitial angular momenta (impact parameter) and evolved with Einstein equations\nthrough the scattering process. The strong-field scattering dynamics are\nexplored up to scattering angles of $225^\\circ$ and the threshold of dynamical\ncaptures. The transition to bound orbits is aided by significant mass ejecta up\nto baryon mass ${\\sim}1M_\\odot$. A quantitative comparison with predictions of\nthe scattering angle from state-of-the-art effective-one-body and\npost-Minkowskian calculations indicates quantitative agreement for large\ninitial angular momenta although significant discrepancies in the tidal\ncontribution emerge towards the capture threshold. Gravitational waveforms and\nradiated energy are in qualitative agreement with the analogous black hole\nproblem and state-of-the-art effective-one-body predictions. Towards the\ncapture threshold waveforms from scattering dynamics carry a strong imprint of\nmatter effects, including the stars' $f$-mode excitations during the close\nencounter. Overall, our simulations open a new avenue to study tidal\ninteractions in the relativistic two-body problem.",

    "abstract": "Universal deformations are those that can be maintained in the absence of\nbody forces and with boundary tractions alone, for all materials within a given\nconstitutive class. We study the universal deformations of compressible\nisotropic Cauchy elastic solids reinforced by a single family of inextensible\nfibers. We consider straight fibers parallel to the Cartesian Z-axis in the\nreference configuration and derive the associated universality constraints,\nwhich depend explicitly on the geometry of the deformed fibers. We study\nuniversal deformations in two cases: (i) deformed fibers are straight lines,\nand (ii) deformed fibers have non-vanishing curvature. For case (i), we provide\na complete classification. The universality constraints reduce to geometric\nrestrictions on the orthogonal surfaces, which must be planes, circular\ncylinders, or spheres. This gives one inhomogeneous universal deformation\nfamily: the non-isochoric Family Z1 of combined bending and stretching\ndeformations. In addition, Family 0Z consists of homogeneous deformations that\nrespect the inextensibility constraint. We further show that if all principal\ninvariants are constant and deformed fibers remain straight, then only\nhomogeneous universal deformations are possible. For case (ii), when deformed\nfibers have non-vanishing curvature, the universality constraints become\nsignificantly more complex. The existence of universal deformations in this\ncase remains an open problem. In particular, we demonstrate that Family 5\nuniversal deformations of incompressible elasticity, when restricted to satisfy\nthe inextensibility constraint, are no longer universal in fiber-reinforced\nsolids. Finally, we prove that the universal deformations of Cauchy and\nhyperelastic solids with the same fiber reinforcement coincide.",

Furthermore, the velocity\nvorticity gauge correspondence naturally suggests a Lindblad operator\nstructure, providing a pathway toward a quantum description of viscous\ndissipation and allowing quantization of dissipative hydrodynamics.

Our results show that GW bias is most sensitive to\nhost-galaxy probability dependence on stellar mass, with increases of up to\n$\\sim O (10)\\%$ relative to galaxy bias as the stellar mass pivot scale rises.\nWe also find a notable relationship between GW bias and SFR: when the\nhost-galaxy probability favors low-SFR galaxies, the GW bias significantly\nincreases.

Traditional techniques used to link\nsubstructures' morphology to the properties of putative embedded planets\npresent several limitations that the use of deep learning methods has partly\novercome. In our previous work, we developed DBNets, a tool exploiting an\nensemble of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to estimate the mass of\nputative planets in disc dust substructures. This inference problem, however,\nis degenerate as planets of different masses could produce the same rings and\ngaps if other physical disc properties were different. In this paper, we\naddress this issue improving our simulation-based inference pipeline to\nestimate the full posterior distribution for the planet mass and three\nadditional disc properties: the disc $\\alpha$-viscosity, the scale height and\nthe dust Stokes number. We also address some minor issues of our previous tool.\nThe new pipeline involves a CNN that summarises the input images in a set of\nsummary statistics, followed by an ensemble of normalising flows that model the\ninferred posterior for the target properties. We tested our pipeline on a\ndedicated set of synthetic observations using the TARP test and standard\nmetrics, demonstrating its accuracy and precision. Additionally, we use the\nresults obtained on the test set to study the degeneracies between pairs of\nparameters. Finally, we apply the developed pipeline to a set of 49 gaps in 34\nprotoplanetary discs' continuum observations. The results show typically low\nvalues of $\\alpha$-viscosity, disc scale heights, and planet masses, with 83%\nof them being lower than 1M$_J$. These low masses are consistent with the\nnon-detections of these putative planets in direct imaging surveys. Our tool is\npublicly available.",

    "abstract": "Recent observations have revealed slow, coherent temperature fluctuations in\nAGN disks that propagate both inward and outward at velocities of $\\sim 0.01 -\n0.1c$, a kind of variability that is distinct from reverberation (mediated by\nthe reprocessing of light) between different regions of the disk. We\ninvestigate the origin and nature of these fluctuations using global 3D\nradiation-magnetohydrodynamic simulations of radiation and magnetic\npressure-dominated AGN accretion disks. Disks with a significant turbulent\nMaxwell stress component exhibit wave-like temperature perturbations, most\nevident close to the midplane, whose propagation speeds exactly match the local\nfast magnetosonic speed and are consistent with the speeds inferred in\nobservations. These fluctuations have amplitudes of $2 - 4\\%$ in gas\ntemperature, which are also consistent with observational constraints. Disks\nthat are dominated by mean-field Maxwell stresses do not exhibit such waves.\nWhile waves may be present in the body of the disk, we do not find them to be\npresent in the photosphere. Although this may in part be due to low numerical\nresolution in the photosphere region, we discuss the physical challenges that\nmust be overcome for the waves to manifest there. In particular, the fact that\nsuch waves are observed implies that the disk photospheres must be magnetically\ndominated, since radiative damping from photon diffusion smooths out radiation\npressure fluctuations. Furthermore, the gas and radiation fluctuations must be\nout of local thermodynamic equilibrium.",

Building on the previously developed 1PI-resummed\nframework to accurately capture the relevant regime $T \\sim M$, we expand the\nanalysis to include the Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal (LPM) effect, which\ncontributes at leading order $g^2 T$ to the interaction rate in the\nultra-relativistic limit. To this end, we derive an equation for the LPM rate\nof a scalar particle for the first time and combine it with the previous 1PI\nresults, providing a new state-of-the art calculation. In contrast to the 1PI\nresults, the LPM treatment neglects vacuum mass scales such that a\nphenomenological switch-off function between the ultra-relativistic and\nnon-relativistic regime is required. We propose a new function motivated by a\nthermal loop contribution and compare it to other approaches in the literature,\nquantifying the resulting uncertainty of this method. Depending on the gauge\ncoupling and mass splitting between DM and mediator particles, the LPM effect\ncontributes between 1% and 27% to the relic density, with the impact increasing\nfor larger gauge couplings and smaller mass splittings. Additionally, we\ncompare our results to commonly used semi-classical Boltzmann approaches. For\ninstance, when these include decays and scatterings regulated with thermal\nmasses, we find deviations ranging from -30% to +20% depending on the mass\nsplitting.

In this paper, we propose SceneCompleter, a novel framework that\nachieves 3D-consistent generative novel view synthesis through dense 3D scene\ncompletion. SceneCompleter achieves both visual coherence and 3D-consistent\ngenerative scene completion through two key components: (1) a\ngeometry-appearance dual-stream diffusion model that jointly synthesizes novel\nviews in RGBD space; (2) a scene embedder that encodes a more holistic scene\nunderstanding from the reference image.

    "abstract": "A wide range of scientific problems, such as those described by\ncontinuous-time dynamical systems and partial differential equations (PDEs),\nare naturally formulated on function spaces. While function spaces are\ntypically infinite-dimensional, deep learning has predominantly advanced\nthrough applications in computer vision and natural language processing that\nfocus on mappings between finite-dimensional spaces. Such fundamental\ndisparities in the nature of the data have limited neural networks from\nachieving a comparable level of success in scientific applications as seen in\nother fields. Neural operators are a principled way to generalize neural\nnetworks to mappings between function spaces, offering a pathway to replicate\ndeep learning's transformative impact on scientific problems. For instance,\nneural operators can learn solution operators for entire classes of PDEs, e.g.,\nphysical systems with different boundary conditions, coefficient functions, and\ngeometries. A key factor in deep learning's success has been the careful\nengineering of neural architectures through extensive empirical testing.\nTranslating these neural architectures into neural operators allows operator\nlearning to enjoy these same empirical optimizations. However, prior neural\noperator architectures have often been introduced as standalone models, not\ndirectly derived as extensions of existing neural network architectures. In\nthis paper, we identify and distill the key principles for constructing\npractical implementations of mappings between infinite-dimensional function\nspaces. Using these principles, we propose a recipe for converting several\npopular neural architectures into neural operators with minimal modifications.\nThis paper aims to guide practitioners through this process and details the\nsteps to make neural operators work in practice.

When the full data\ndistribution is a mixture over classes and the goal is to sample from a\nspecific class, guidance amplifies class-specific regions while suppresses\nregions shared with other classes. This effect depends on the guidance strength\n$w$ and induces distinct covariance structures in the sampled distribution.\nNotably, we observe quantitatively different behaviors in $1$D and $2$D. We\nalso show that for large $w$, the decay rate of the total variation\n($\\mathrm{TV}$) along the reverse dynamics is double-exponential in $w$ for\nboth $1$D and $2$D.

In this way, hand-eye coordination emerges as the eye looks\ntowards regions which allow the hand to complete the task.

    "abstract": "In multimodal large language models (MLLMs), the length of input visual\ntokens is often significantly greater than that of their textual counterparts,\nleading to a high inference cost. Many works aim to address this issue by\nremoving redundant visual tokens. However, current approaches either rely on\nattention-based pruning, which retains numerous duplicate tokens, or use\nsimilarity-based pruning, overlooking the instruction relevance, consequently\ncausing suboptimal performance. In this paper, we go beyond attention or\nsimilarity by proposing a novel visual token pruning method named CDPruner,\nwhich maximizes the conditional diversity of retained tokens. We first define\nthe conditional similarity between visual tokens conditioned on the\ninstruction, and then reformulate the token pruning problem with determinantal\npoint process (DPP) to maximize the conditional diversity of the selected\nsubset. The proposed CDPruner is training-free and model-agnostic, allowing\neasy application to various MLLMs. Extensive experiments across diverse MLLMs\nshow that CDPruner establishes new state-of-the-art on various vision-language\nbenchmarks. By maximizing conditional diversity through DPP, the selected\nsubset better represents the input images while closely adhering to user\ninstructions, thereby preserving strong performance even with high reduction\nratios.

While this explains the RIQAH state at filling $\\nu =\n-0.63$, the other RIQAH state at $\\nu = -0.7$ has a smaller slope,\nnecessitating a different interpretation. We propose that this discrepancy\narises due to a nearby resistive peak masking the true slope. Furthermore, we\nidentify this resistive peak as a signature of a phase transition near $\\nu =\n-0.75$, possibly driven by a Van Hove singularity. The anomalous Hall response\nand Landau fan evolution across this transition suggest a change in Fermi\nsurface topology and a metallic phase with non-quantized Hall response.

Approximately 112~s\nlater, the X-ray Telescope onboard the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory was on\nsource, the fastest follow-up to-date of a non-repeating FRB (Tohuvavohu et al.\nin prep.). Using CHIME/FRB and two of the three CHIME/FRB Outriggers, we\nobtained a Very Long Baseline Interferometry localization for FRB 20241228A\nwith a 1$\\sigma$ confidence ellipse of 11$^{\\prime\\prime}$ by\n0.2$^{\\prime\\prime}$. This represents the first published localization using\nboth the CHIME-KKO and CHIME-GBO Outriggers. We associate FRB 20241228A with a\nstar-forming galaxy at a redshift of $z = 0.1614\\pm0.0002$. The persistent\nX-ray luminosity limit at this source's location and distance is $<1.2 \\times\n10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$ in the $0.3-10$ keV band, the most stringent limit of any\nnon-repeating FRB to-date (Tohuvavohu et al. in prep.). The stellar mass ($\\sim\n2.6 \\times 10^{10}\\,M_{\\odot}$) and star formation rate ($\\sim\n2.9\\,M_{\\odot}$~yr$^{-1}$) of the host galaxy of FRB 20241228A are consistent\nwith the broader FRB host galaxy population. We measure significant scattering\n($\\sim$1ms) and scintillation ($\\sim$20 kHz at 600 MHz) along the line of sight\nto this source, and suggest the scintillation screen is Galactic while the\nscattering screen is extragalactic. FRB 20241228A represents an exciting\nexample of a new era in which we can harness VLBI-localizations and rapid\nhigh-energy follow-up to probe FRB progenitors.",

Training-free methods like diffusion\nposterior sampling (DPS) and its many variants have offered flexible heuristic\nalgorithms for these tasks, but when the reward is not informative enough,\ne.g., in hard inverse problems with low signal-to-noise ratio, these techniques\nveer off the data manifold, failing to produce realistic outputs. In this work,\nwe devise a simple wrapper, ReGuidance, for boosting both the sample realism\nand reward achieved by these methods. Given a candidate solution $\\hat{x}$\nproduced by an algorithm of the user's choice, we propose inverting the\nsolution by running the unconditional probability flow ODE in reverse starting\nfrom $\\hat{x}$, and then using the resulting latent as an initialization for\nDPS. We evaluate our wrapper on hard inverse problems like large box\nin-painting and super-resolution with high upscaling. Whereas state-of-the-art\nbaselines visibly fail, we find that applying our wrapper on top of these\nbaselines significantly boosts sample quality and measurement consistency. We\ncomplement these findings with theory proving that on certain multimodal data\ndistributions, ReGuidance simultaneously boosts the reward and brings the\ncandidate solution closer to the data manifold.

However, the traditional process for creating\nsuch benchmarks is notoriously challenging and labor-intensive, particularly in\nthe stages of setting up evaluation environments, grading test outcomes, and\nvalidating task instances. In this paper, we propose SWE-Factory, an automated\npipeline designed to address these challenges. To tackle these issues, our\npipeline integrates three core automated components. First, we introduce\nSWE-Builder, a multi-agent system that automates evaluation environment\nconstruction, which employs four specialized agents that work in a\ncollaborative, iterative loop and leverages an environment memory pool to\nenhance efficiency. Second, we introduce a standardized, exit-code-based\ngrading method that eliminates the need for manually writing custom parsers.\nFinally, we automate the fail2pass validation process using these reliable exit\ncode signals. Experiments on 671 issues across four programming languages show\nthat our pipeline can effectively construct valid task instances; for example,\nwith GPT-4.1-mini, our SWE-Builder constructs 269 valid instances at $0.045 per\ninstance, while with Gemini-2.5-flash, it achieves comparable performance at\nthe lowest cost of $0.024 per instance. We also demonstrate that our\nexit-code-based grading achieves 100% accuracy compared to manual inspection,\nand our automated fail2pass validation reaches a precision of 0.92 and a recall\nof 1.00. We hope our automated pipeline will accelerate the collection of\nlarge-scale, high-quality GitHub issue resolution datasets for both training\nand evaluation.

The\nchallenge lies in the existing shallow safety alignment techniques: they only\ndetect harm in the immediate prompt and do not reason about long-range intent,\nleaving them blind to malicious intent that emerges over a sequence of\nseemingly benign instructions. We therefore propose adding an external monitor\nthat observes the conversation at a higher granularity. To facilitate our study\nof monitoring decomposition attacks, we curate the largest and most diverse\ndataset to date, including question-answering, text-to-image, and agentic\ntasks. We verify our datasets by testing them on frontier LLMs and show an 87%\nattack success rate on average on GPT-4o. This confirms that decomposition\nattack is broadly effective. Additionally, we find that random tasks can be\ninjected into the decomposed subtasks to further obfuscate malicious intents.\nTo defend in real time, we propose a lightweight sequential monitoring\nframework that cumulatively evaluates each subtask. We show that a carefully\nprompt engineered lightweight monitor achieves a 93% defense success rate,\nbeating reasoning models like o3 mini as a monitor. Moreover, it remains robust\nagainst random task injection and cuts cost by 90% and latency by 50%.

Federated Learning (FL) offers a solution by enabling\ncollaborative model training without centralizing data. However, realizing FL\nfor MLLMs presents significant challenges, including high computational\ndemands, limited client capacity, substantial communication costs, and\nheterogeneous client data. Existing FL methods assume client-side deployment of\nfull models, an assumption that breaks down for large-scale MLLMs due to their\nmassive size and communication demands. To address these limitations, we\npropose FedNano, the first FL framework that centralizes the LLM on the server\nwhile introducing NanoEdge, a lightweight module for client-specific\nadaptation. NanoEdge employs modality-specific encoders, connectors, and\ntrainable NanoAdapters with low-rank adaptation.

    "abstract": "We present a novel approach to neural code generation that incorporates\nreal-time execution signals into the language model generation process. While\nlarge language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive code generation\ncapabilities, they typically do not utilize execution feedback during\ninference, a critical signal that human programmers regularly leverage. Our\nmethod, Execution-Guided Classifier-Free Guidance (EG-CFG), dynamically\nincorporates execution signals as the model generates code, providing\nline-by-line feedback that guides the generation process toward executable\nsolutions. EG-CFG employs a multi-stage process: first, we conduct beam search\nto sample candidate program completions for each line; second, we extract\nexecution signals by executing these candidates against test cases; and\nfinally, we incorporate these signals into the prompt during generation. By\nmaintaining consistent signals across tokens within the same line and\nrefreshing signals at line boundaries, our approach provides coherent guidance\nwhile preserving syntactic structure. Moreover, the method naturally supports\nnative parallelism at the task level in which multiple agents operate in\nparallel, exploring diverse reasoning paths and collectively generating a broad\nset of candidate solutions. Our experiments across diverse coding tasks\ndemonstrate that EG-CFG significantly improves code generation performance\ncompared to standard approaches, achieving state-of-the-art results across\nvarious levels of complexity, from foundational problems to challenging\ncompetitive programming tasks.

For\nexample, RLVR improves MATH-500 performance for Qwen2.5-Math-7B in absolute\npoints by 21.4% (random reward), 13.8% (format reward), 24.1% (incorrect\nlabel), 26.0% (1-shot RL), and 27.1% (majority voting) -- nearly matching the\n29.1% gained with ground truth rewards. However, the spurious rewards that work\nfor Qwen often fail to yield gains with other model families like Llama3 or\nOLMo2. In particular, we find code reasoning -- thinking in code without actual\ncode execution -- to be a distinctive Qwen2.5-Math behavior that becomes\nsignificantly more frequent after RLVR, from 65% to over 90%, even with\nspurious rewards. Overall, we hypothesize that, given the lack of useful reward\nsignal, RLVR must somehow be surfacing useful reasoning representations learned\nduring pretraining, although the exact mechanism remains a topic for future\nwork.

    "abstract": "Unlearning in large language models (LLMs) is becoming increasingly important\ndue to regulatory compliance, copyright protection, and privacy concerns.\nHowever, a key challenge in LLM unlearning is unintended forgetting, where the\nremoval of specific data inadvertently impairs the utility of the model and its\nretention of valuable, desired information. While prior work has primarily\nfocused on architectural innovations, the influence of data-level factors on\nunlearning performance remains underexplored. As a result, existing methods\noften suffer from degraded retention when forgetting high-impact data. To\naddress this, we propose GUARD-a novel framework for Guided Unlearning And\nRetention via Data attribution. At its core, GUARD introduces a lightweight\nproxy data attribution metric tailored for LLM unlearning, which quantifies the\n\"alignment\" between the forget and retain sets while remaining computationally\nefficient. Building on this, we design a novel unlearning objective that\nassigns adaptive, nonuniform unlearning weights to samples, inversely\nproportional to their proxy attribution scores. Through such a reallocation of\nunlearning power, GUARD mitigates unintended losses in retention. We provide\nrigorous theoretical guarantees that GUARD significantly enhances retention\nwhile maintaining forgetting metrics comparable to prior methods. Extensive\nexperiments on the TOFU benchmark across multiple LLM architectures demonstrate\nthat GUARD substantially improves utility preservation while ensuring effective\nunlearning. Notably, GUARD reduces utility sacrifice on the Retain Set by up to\n194.92% in terms of Truth Ratio when forgetting 10% of the training data.",

    "abstract": "Steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP)-based brain-computer interfaces\n(BCIs) can achieve high recognition accuracy with sufficient training data.\nTransfer learning presents a promising solution to alleviate data requirements\nfor the target subject by leveraging data from source subjects; however,\neffectively addressing individual variability among both target and source\nsubjects remains a challenge. This paper proposes a novel transfer learning\nframework, termed instance-based task-related component analysis (iTRCA), which\nleverages knowledge from source subjects while considering their individual\ncontributions. iTRCA extracts two types of features: (1) the subject-general\nfeature, capturing shared information between source and target subjects in a\ncommon latent space, and (2) the subject-specific feature, preserving the\nunique characteristics of the target subject. To mitigate negative transfer, we\nfurther design an enhanced framework, subject selection-based iTRCA (SS-iTRCA),\nwhich integrates a similarity-based subject selection strategy to identify\nappropriate source subjects for transfer based on their task-related components\n(TRCs). Comparative evaluations on the Benchmark, BETA, and a self-collected\ndataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed iTRCA and SS-iTRCA\nframeworks.

This paper demonstrates that while hardware acceleration techniques\ncan significantly accelerate RSGA, the high volume of genomic data shifts the\nperformance and energy bottleneck from computation to I/O data movement. As\nsequencing throughput increases, I/O overhead becomes the main contributor to\nboth runtime and energy consumption. Therefore, there is a need to design a\nhigh-performance, energy-efficient system for RSGA that can both alleviate the\ndata movement bottleneck and provide large acceleration capabilities. We\npropose MARS, a storage-centric system that leverages the heterogeneous\nresources within modern storage systems (e.g., storage-internal DRAM, storage\ncontroller, flash chips) alongside their large storage capacity to tackle both\ndata movement and computational overheads of RSGA in an area-efficient and\nlow-cost manner. MARS accelerates RSGA through a novel hardware/software\nco-design approach. First, MARS modifies the RSGA pipeline via two filtering\nmechanisms and a quantization scheme, reducing hardware demands and optimizing\nfor in-storage execution. Second, MARS accelerates the RSGA steps directly\nwithin the storage by leveraging both Processing-Near-Memory and\nProcessing-Using-Memory paradigms. Third, MARS orchestrates the execution of\nall steps to fully exploit in-storage parallelism and minimize data movement.\nOur evaluation shows that MARS outperforms basecalling-based software and\nhardware-accelerated state-of-the-art read mapping pipelines by 93x and 40x, on\naverage across different datasets, while reducing their energy consumption by\n427x and 72x.",

We address these failures\nthrough internal bias mitigation: by identifying and neutralizing sensitive\nattribute directions within model activations, we achieve robust bias reduction\nacross all tested scenarios. Across leading commercial (GPT-4o, Claude 4\nSonnet, Gemini 2.5 Flash) and open-source models (Gemma-2 27B, Gemma-3,\nMistral-24B), we find that adding realistic context such as company names,\nculture descriptions from public careers pages, and selective hiring\nconstraints (e.g.,``only accept candidates in the top 10\\%\") induces\nsignificant racial and gender biases (up to 12\\% differences in interview\nrates). When these biases emerge, they consistently favor Black over White\ncandidates and female over male candidates across all tested models and\nscenarios. Moreover, models can infer demographics and become biased from\nsubtle cues like college affiliations, with these biases remaining invisible\neven when inspecting the model's chain-of-thought reasoning. To address these\nlimitations, our internal bias mitigation identifies race and gender-correlated\ndirections and applies affine concept editing at inference time.

While early work focused on individual neurons, evidence that\nneurons often encode multiple concepts has motivated a shift toward analyzing\ndirections in activation space. A key question is how to find directions that\ncapture interpretable features in an unsupervised manner. Current methods rely\non dictionary learning with sparse autoencoders (SAEs), commonly trained over\nresidual stream activations to learn directions from scratch. However, SAEs\noften struggle in causal evaluations and lack intrinsic interpretability, as\ntheir learning is not explicitly tied to the computations of the model. Here,\nwe tackle these limitations by directly decomposing MLP activations with\nsemi-nonnegative matrix factorization (SNMF), such that the learned features\nare (a) sparse linear combinations of co-activated neurons, and (b) mapped to\ntheir activating inputs, making them directly interpretable. Experiments on\nLlama 3.1, Gemma 2 and GPT-2 show that SNMF derived features outperform SAEs\nand a strong supervised baseline (difference-in-means) on causal steering,\nwhile aligning with human-interpretable concepts.

    "abstract": "Neutral atom arrays and optical cavity QED systems have developed in parallel\nas central pillars of modern experimental quantum science. While each platform\nhas demonstrated exceptional capabilities-such as high-fidelity quantum logic\nin atom arrays, and strong light-matter coupling in cavities-their combination\nholds promise for realizing fast and non-destructive atom measurement, building\nlarge-scale quantum networks, and engineering hybrid atom-photon Hamiltonians.\nHowever, to date, experiments integrating the two platforms have been limited\nto interfacing the entire atom array with one global cavity mode, a\nconfiguration that constrains addressability, parallelism, and scalability.\nHere we introduce the cavity array microscope, an experimental platform where\neach individual atom is strongly coupled to its own individual cavity across a\ntwo-dimensional array of over 40 modes. Our approach requires no nanophotonic\nelements, and instead uses a new free-space cavity geometry with intra-cavity\nlenses to realize above-unity peak cooperativity with micron-scale mode waists\nand spacings, compatible with typical atom array length scales while keeping\natoms far from dielectric surfaces. We achieve homogeneous atom-cavity\ncoupling, and show fast, non-destructive, parallel readout on millisecond\ntimescales, including cavity-resolved readout into a fiber array as a\nproof-of-principle for future networking applications. This platform is\nspecies-agnostic and scalable, and we expect key metrics to further improve in\na next-generation realization anticipated to be compatible with\nglass-cell-based experiments. Our work unlocks, for the first time, the regime\nof many-cavity QED, and opens an unexplored frontier of large-scale quantum\nnetworking with atom arrays.",

Recent developments have\ngiven rise to various models, such as Gated Linear Attention (GLA) and Mamba,\nthat achieve such ``sequential-parallel duality.'' This raises a natural\nquestion: can we characterize the full class of neural sequence models that\nsupport near-constant-time parallel evaluation and linear-time, constant-space\nsequential inference? We begin by describing a broad class of such models --\nstate space models -- as those whose state updates can be computed using the\nclassic parallel prefix scan algorithm with a custom associative aggregation\noperator. We then define a more general class, Prefix-Scannable Models (PSMs),\nby relaxing the state aggregation operator to allow arbitrary (potentially\nnon-associative) functions such as softmax attention. This generalization\nunifies many existing architectures, including element-wise RNNs (e.g., Mamba)\nand linear transformers (e.g., GLA, Mamba2, mLSTM), while also introducing new\nmodels with softmax-like operators that achieve O(1) amortized compute per\ntoken and log(N) memory for sequence length N. We empirically evaluate such\nmodels on illustrative small-scale language modeling and canonical synthetic\ntasks, including state tracking and associative recall. Empirically, we find\nthat PSMs retain the expressivity of transformer-based architectures while\nmatching the inference efficiency of state space models -- in some cases\nexhibiting better length generalization than either.",

Artifacts have been\nshown to negatively impact the performance of AI diagnostic models. In current\npractice, trained staff manually review digitized images prior to release of\nthese slides to pathologists which are then used to render a diagnosis.\nConventional image processing approaches, provide a foundation for detecting\nartifacts on digital pathology slides. However, current tools do not leverage\ndeep learning, which has the potential to improve detection accuracy and\nscalability.

This algorithm identifies and localizes artifacts, creating a\nmap that highlights regions of interest. By directing human operators to\nspecific tiles affected by artifacts, the algorithm minimizes the time and\neffort required to manually review entire slides for quality issues.\n  From internal archives and The Cancer Genome Atlas, 133 whole slide images\nwere selected and 10 artifacts were annotated using an internally developed\nsoftware ZAPP (Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL).

First, we formalize the\nconstruction of Bayesian priors for causal inference based on structural causal\nmodels (SCMs) in a principled way and derive necessary criteria for the\nvalidity of such priors. Building on this, we propose a novel family of prior\ndistributions using causality-inspired Bayesian neural networks that enable\nCausalFM to perform Bayesian causal inference in various settings, including\nback-door, front-door, and instrumental variable adjustment. Finally, we\ninstantiate CausalFM and explicitly train a foundation model for estimating\nconditional average treatment effects (CATEs) using back-door adjustment. We\nshow that CausalFM performs competitively for CATE estimation using various\nsynthetic and semi-synthetic benchmarks.

    "abstract": "Training large language models is generally done via optimization methods on\nclusters containing tens of thousands of accelerators, communicating over a\nhigh-bandwidth interconnect. Scaling up these clusters is expensive and can\nbecome impractical, imposing limits on the size of models that can be trained.\nSeveral recent studies have proposed training methods that are less\ncommunication intensive, avoiding the need for a highly connected compute\ncluster. These state-of-the-art low communication training methods still employ\na synchronization step for model parameters, which, when performed over all\nmodel replicas, can become costly on a low-bandwidth network.\n  In this work, we propose a novel optimization method, NoLoCo, that does not\nexplicitly synchronize all model parameters during training and, as a result,\ndoes not require any collective communication. NoLoCo implicitly synchronizes\nmodel weights via a novel variant of the Nesterov momentum optimizer by\npartially averaging model weights with a randomly selected other one. We\nprovide both a theoretical convergence analysis for our proposed optimizer as\nwell as empirical results from language model training.\n  We benchmark NoLoCo on a wide range of accelerator counts and model sizes,\nbetween 125M to 6.8B parameters. Our method requires significantly less\ncommunication overhead than fully sharded data parallel training or even widely\nused low communication training method, DiLoCo. The synchronization step itself\nis estimated to be one magnitude faster than the all-reduce used in DiLoCo for\nfew hundred accelerators training over the internet. We also do not have any\nglobal blocking communication that reduces accelerator idling time. Compared to\nDiLoCo, we also observe up to $4\\%$ faster convergence rate with wide range of\nmodel sizes and accelerator counts.",

Autistic people in particular\nhave been dehumanized by being compared to robots, making it even more\nimportant to ensure this marginalization is not reproduced by AI that may\npromote neuronormative social behaviors. Second, the ubiquitous use of these\nagents raises concerns surrounding model biases and accessibility. In our work,\nwe investigate the experiences of the people who build and design these\ntechnologies to gain insights into their understanding and acceptance of\nneurodivergence, and the challenges in making their work more accessible to\nusers with diverse needs. Even though neurodivergent individuals are often\nmarginalized for their unique communication styles, nearly all participants\noverlooked the conclusions their end-users and other AI system makers may draw\nabout communication norms from the implementation and interpretation of\nhumanness applied in participants' work. This highlights a major gap in their\nbroader ethical considerations, compounded by some participants' neuronormative\nassumptions about the behaviors and traits that distinguish \"humans\" from\n\"bots\" and the replication of these assumptions in their work. We examine the\nimpact this may have on autism inclusion in society and provide recommendations\nfor additional systemic changes towards more ethical research directions.",

    "abstract": "Autoformalization plays a crucial role in formal mathematical reasoning by\nenabling the automatic translation of natural language statements into formal\nlanguages. While recent advances using large language models (LLMs) have shown\npromising results, methods for automatically evaluating autoformalization\nremain underexplored. As one moves to more complex domains (e.g., advanced\nmathematics), human evaluation requires significant time and domain expertise,\nespecially as the complexity of the underlying statements and background\nknowledge increases. LLM-as-a-judge presents a promising approach for\nautomating such evaluation. However, existing methods typically employ\ncoarse-grained and generic evaluation criteria, which limit their effectiveness\nfor advanced formal mathematical reasoning, where quality hinges on nuanced,\nmulti-granular dimensions. In this work, we take a step toward addressing this\ngap by introducing a systematic, automatic method to evaluate autoformalization\ntasks. The proposed method is based on an epistemically and formally grounded\nensemble (EFG) of LLM judges, defined on criteria encompassing logical\npreservation (LP), mathematical consistency (MC), formal validity (FV), and\nformal quality (FQ), resulting in a transparent assessment that accounts for\ndifferent contributing factors. We validate the proposed framework to serve as\na proxy for autoformalization assessment within the domain of formal\nmathematics. Overall, our experiments demonstrate that the EFG ensemble of LLM\njudges is a suitable emerging proxy for evaluation, more strongly correlating\nwith human assessments than a coarse-grained model, especially when assessing\nformal qualities. These findings suggest that LLM-as-judges, especially when\nguided by a well-defined set of atomic properties, could offer a scalable,\ninterpretable, and reliable support for evaluating formal mathematical\nreasoning.",

    "abstract": "Oversmoothing remains a persistent problem when applying deep learning to\noff-axis quantitative phase imaging (QPI). End-to-end U-Nets favour\nlow-frequency content and under-represent fine, diagnostic detail. We trace\nthis issue to spectral bias and show that the bias is reinforced by high-level\nskip connections that feed high-frequency features directly into the decoder.\nRemoving those deepest skips thus supervising the network only at a low\nresolution significantly improves generalisation and fidelity. Building on this\ninsight, we introduce DiffPR, a two-stage frequency-decoupled framework. Stage\n1: an asymmetric U-Net with cancelled high-frequency skips predicts a\nquarter-scale phase map from the interferogram, capturing reliable\nlow-frequency structure while avoiding spectral bias. Stage 2: the upsampled\nprediction, lightly perturbed with Gaussian noise, is refined by an\nunconditional diffusion model that iteratively recovers the missing\nhigh-frequency residuals through reverse denoising. Experiments on four QPI\ndatasets (B-Cell, WBC, HeLa, 3T3) show that DiffPR outperforms strong U-Net\nbaselines, boosting PSNR by up to 1.1 dB and reducing MAE by 11 percent, while\ndelivering markedly sharper membrane ridges and speckle patterns.

Given an image and a question such as \"How many dogs are in the\nscene?\" or \"Where is the buffalo?\", the system grounds visual detections into\nsymbolic facts and uses predefined rules to compute accurate answers related to\ncount, presence, and location.

In this paper,\nwe introduce CreatiPoster, a framework that generates editable, multi-layer\ncompositions from optional natural-language instructions or assets.

A conditional background model\nthen synthesizes a coherent background conditioned on this rendered foreground\nlayers. We construct a benchmark with automated metrics for graphic-design\ngeneration and show that CreatiPoster surpasses leading open-source approaches\nand proprietary commercial systems. To catalyze further research, we release a\ncopyright-free corpus of 100,000 multi-layer designs.

The advancement\nof quantum algorithms has outpaced the capabilities of existing quantum\nhardware, making it difficult to scale computations effectively. Additionally,\ninconsistencies in hardware performance and pervasive quantum noise undermine\nsystem stability and computational accuracy. To optimize quantum workloads\nunder these constraints, strategic approaches to task scheduling and resource\ncoordination are essential. These methods must aim to accelerate processing,\nretain operational fidelity, and reduce the communication burden inherent to\ndistributed setups. One of the persistent challenges in this domain is how to\nefficiently divide and execute large circuits across multiple quantum\nprocessors (QPUs), especially in error-prone environments. In response, we\nintroduce a simulation-based tool that supports distributed scheduling and\nconcurrent execution of quantum jobs on networked QPUs connected via real-time\nclassical channels. The tool models circuit decomposition for workloads that\nsurpass individual QPU limits, allowing for parallel execution through\ninter-processor communication. Using this simulation environment, we compare\nfour distinct scheduling techniques-among them, a model informed by\nreinforcement learning. These strategies are evaluated across multiple metrics,\nincluding runtime efficiency, fidelity preservation, and communication costs.\nOur analysis underscores the trade-offs inherent in each approach and\nhighlights how parallelized, noise-aware scheduling can meaningfully improve\ncomputational throughput in distributed quantum infrastructures.",

In this\nwork, we argue that both behaviors stem from a single mechanism known as\nout-of-context reasoning (OCR): the ability to deduce implications by\nassociating concepts, even those without a causal link. Our experiments across\nfive prominent LLMs confirm that OCR indeed drives both generalization and\nhallucination, depending on whether the associated concepts are causally\nrelated. To build a rigorous theoretical understanding of this phenomenon, we\nthen formalize OCR as a synthetic factual recall task. We empirically show that\na one-layer single-head attention-only transformer with factorized output and\nvalue matrices can learn to solve this task, while a model with combined\nweights cannot, highlighting the crucial role of matrix factorization. Our\ntheoretical analysis shows that the OCR capability can be attributed to the\nimplicit bias of gradient descent, which favors solutions that minimize the\nnuclear norm of the combined output-value matrix. This mathematical structure\nexplains why the model learns to associate facts and implications with high\nsample efficiency, regardless of whether the correlation is causal or merely\nspurious. Ultimately, our work provides a theoretical foundation for\nunderstanding the OCR phenomenon, offering a new lens for analyzing and\nmitigating undesirable behaviors from knowledge injection.",

Recent model-aware deep subspace clustering\nmethods often use a two-stage framework, involving the calculation of a\nself-representation matrix with complexity of O(n^2), followed by spectral\nclustering. However, these methods are computationally intensive, generally\nincorporating solely either local or non-local spatial structure constraints,\nand their structural constraints fall short of effectively supervising the\nentire clustering process.\n  We propose a scalable, context-preserving deep clustering method based on\nbasis representation, which jointly captures local and non-local structures for\nefficient HSI clustering. To preserve local structure (i.e., spatial continuity\nwithin subspaces), we introduce a spatial smoothness constraint that aligns\nclustering predictions with their spatially filtered versions. For non-local\nstructure (i.e., spectral continuity), we employ a mini-cluster-based scheme\nthat refines predictions at the group level, encouraging spectrally similar\npixels to belong to the same subspace. Notably, these two constraints are\njointly optimized to reinforce each other.\n  Specifically, our model is designed as an one-stage approach in which the\nstructural constraints are applied to the entire clustering process. The time\nand space complexity of our method is O(n), making it applicable to large-scale\nHSI data. Experiments on real-world datasets show that our method outperforms\nstate-of-the-art techniques.

In higher-order uncoupled\nlearning dynamics, players have no access to utilities of opponents (uncoupled)\nbut are allowed to use auxiliary states to further process information\n(higher-order). We establish a link between uncoupled learning and feedback\nstabilization with decentralized control. Using this association, we show that\nfor any finite game with an isolated completely mixed-strategy NE, there exist\nhigher-order uncoupled learning dynamics that lead (locally) to that NE. We\nfurther establish the lack of universality of learning dynamics by linking\nlearning to the control theoretic concept of simultaneous stabilization. We\nconstruct two games such that any higher-order dynamics that learn the\ncompletely mixed-strategy NE of one of these games can never learn the\ncompletely mixed-strategy NE of the other. Next, motivated by imposing natural\nrestrictions on allowable learning dynamics, we introduce the Asymptotic Best\nResponse (ABR) property. Dynamics with the ABR property asymptotically learn a\nbest response in environments that are asymptotically stationary. We show that\nthe ABR property relates to an internal stability condition on higher-order\nlearning dynamics. We provide conditions under which NE are compatible with the\nABR property.

    "abstract": "A quantum trajectory is the natural response of a quantum system subject to\nexternal perturbations due to continuous indirect measurement. We completely\ncharacterize the asymptotic behavior of continuously monitored quantum systems\nin finite dimensions and show that generically, spontaneous irreversible\nlocalization transitions on the level of individual realizations occur, where\nthe evolution becomes effectively constrained to one of the irreducible\ncomponents of the total Hilbert space. More generally, localization can be\neither complete, where the strongest possible confinement is achieved, or\nincomplete, where localization terminates prematurely. On the trajectory level,\nsymmetries and conserved quantities are no longer respected and localization\ntransitions occur concurrently with violations of ergodicity. As a result, a\ngeneralized update rule emerges that effectively projects the system onto one\nof several possible time evolutions. The update comes equipped with a\ngeneralized Born rule that assigns probabilities to these irreversible events.\nSpontaneous transitions thus occur probabilistically and can deviate\nconsiderably from the behavior of the ensemble. In particular, time and\nensemble average no longer commute which gives rise to global violations of\nergodicity, while on a local level, ergodicity is restored. We explicitly\nillustrate the asymptotic behavior of continuously monitored systems in a\nseries of examples demonstrating stabilization of many-body scar states and\ngeneration of Bell states from local measurement.

So far, these effects have been explained using variations of\ngrowing active nematic continuum theories, which incorporate feedback between\ngrowth-induced active stresses, the resulting material flow and nematic\norientation, and were adapted to the specific geometry under investigation.\nHere, we first show that a direct, analytical prediction of orientation\npatterns based on a simple isotropic-growth assumption and the shear rate\ntensor of the expansion flow already covers previously observed cases. We use\nthis method to tune orientation patterns and net topological defect charge in a\nsystematic way using domain geometry, confirmed by agent-based simulations. We\nthen show how this framework can be extended to quantitatively capture\nalignment strength, and explore its potential for cross-prediction across\ndifferent geometries. Our simplified and unifying theoretical framework\nhighlights the role of domain geometry in shaping nematic order of growing\nsystems, and thereby provides a way to forward-engineer desired orientation\npatterns.",

Treatment\nstrategies that assign treatment to patients as a function of their individual\ncharacteristics are known as dynamic treatment rules. The dynamic treatment\nrule that optimizes the outcome in the population is called the optimal dynamic\ntreatment rule. Randomized clinical trials are considered the gold standard for\nestimating the marginal causal effect of a treatment on an outcome; they are\noften not powered to detect heterogeneous treatment effects, and thus, may\nrarely inform more personalized treatment decisions. The availability of\nmultiple trials studying a common set of treatments presents an opportunity for\ncombining data, often called data-fusion, to better estimate dynamic treatment\nrules. However, there may be a mismatch in the set of patient covariates\nmeasured across trials. We address this problem here; we propose a\nnonparametric estimator for the optimal dynamic treatment rule that leverages\ninformation across the set of randomized trials.

Comparative approaches like pairwise and listwise achieve high\neffectiveness but are computationally intensive and thus less practical for\nlarger-scale applications. Scoring-based pointwise approaches exhibit superior\nefficiency by independently and simultaneously generating the relevance scores\nfor each candidate document. However, this independence ignores critical\ncomparative insights between documents, resulting in inconsistent scoring and\nsuboptimal performance. In this paper, we aim to improve the effectiveness of\npointwise methods while preserving their efficiency through two key\ninnovations: (1) We propose a novel Global-Consistent Comparative Pointwise\nRanking (GCCP) strategy that incorporates global reference comparisons between\neach candidate and an anchor document to generate contrastive relevance scores.\nWe strategically design the anchor document as a query-focused summary of\npseudo-relevant candidates, which serves as an effective reference point by\ncapturing the global context for document comparison. (2) These contrastive\nrelevance scores can be efficiently Post-Aggregated with existing pointwise\nmethods, seamlessly integrating essential Global Context information in a\ntraining-free manner (PAGC). Extensive experiments on the TREC DL and BEIR\nbenchmark demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms previous\npointwise methods while maintaining comparable efficiency.

Previous methods can be broadly\nclassified into three categories: convolutional neural network (CNN) based,\nTransformer based, and hybrid architectures that combine both. However, each of\nthem has its own limitations, such as restricted receptive fields in CNNs or\nthe computational overhead caused by the quadratic complexity of Transformers.\nRecently, the Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV) model has emerged as a\npromising alternative for various vision tasks, offering strong long-range\nmodeling capabilities with linear computational complexity. Some studies have\nalso adapted RWKV to medical image segmentation tasks, achieving competitive\nperformance. However, most of these studies focus on modifications to the\nVision-RWKV (VRWKV) mechanism and train models from scratch, without exploring\nthe potential advantages of leveraging pre-trained VRWKV models for medical\nimage segmentation tasks. In this paper, we propose Med-URWKV, a pure\nRWKV-based architecture built upon the U-Net framework, which incorporates\nImageNet-based pretraining to further explore the potential of RWKV in medical\nimage segmentation tasks. To the best of our knowledge, Med-URWKV is the first\npure RWKV segmentation model in the medical field that can directly reuse a\nlarge-scale pre-trained VRWKV encoder. Experimental results on seven datasets\ndemonstrate that Med-URWKV achieves comparable or even superior segmentation\nperformance compared to other carefully optimized RWKV models trained from\nscratch.

These partial computation\nsteps can enable pebbling strategies with much smaller I/O cost, and in\nsettings where such a step-by-step aggregation is possible, this extended\nred-blue pebble game offers a much more realistic cost model.\n  We establish the fundamental properties of this partial-computing red-blue\npebble game (PRBP), and compare it to the original RBP. We begin with some\nsimple examples where allowing partial computations can decrease the optimal\nI/O cost. It is also shown that the cost can decrease by up to a linear factor\nthis way, but in general, it is NP-hard to decide whether partial computations\nallow for a smaller cost in a specific DAG. We then discuss how $S$-partitions,\na crucial tool for deriving I/O lower bounds in RBP, can be adapted to the PRBP\nmodel.

While\nlarge language models (LLMs) show promise as \"world simulators,\" they face\nchallenges in spatiotemporal reasoning including limited spatial cognition,\nlack of physical constraint understanding, and group homogenization tendencies.\nThis paper introduces a framework integrating chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning\nwith Model Context Protocol (MCP) to enhance LLMs' capability in simulating\nspatiotemporal behaviors that correspond with validation data patterns. The\nmethodology combines human-like progressive reasoning through a five-stage\ncognitive framework with comprehensive data processing via six specialized MCP\ntool categories: temporal management, spatial navigation, environmental\nperception, personal memory, social collaboration, and experience evaluation.\nExperiments in Shanghai's Lujiazui district validate the framework's\neffectiveness across 1,000 generated samples. Results demonstrate high\nsimilarity with real mobile signaling data, achieving generation quality scores\nof 7.86 to 8.36 across different base models. Parallel processing experiments\nshow efficiency improvements, with generation times decreasing from 1.30 to\n0.17 minutes per sample when scaling from 2 to 12 processes. This work\ncontributes to integrating CoT reasoning with MCP for urban behavior modeling,\nadvancing LLMs applications in urban computing and providing a practical\napproach for synthetic mobility data generation.

Accurate state\nestimation, particularly of vehicle pose, is paramount for precise seafloor\nmapping, as even small surface deviations can have significant consequences\nwhen sensing the seafloor below. To address this challenge, we propose an\nInvariant Extended Kalman Filter (InEKF) framework designed to integrate\npartial orientation measurements. While conventional estimation often relies on\nrelative position measurements to fixed landmarks, open ocean ASVs primarily\nobserve a receding horizon. We leverage forward-facing monocular cameras to\nestimate roll and pitch with respect to this horizon, which provides\nyaw-ambiguous partial orientation information. To effectively utilize these\nmeasurements within the InEKF, we introduce a novel framework for incorporating\nsuch partial orientation data. This approach contrasts with traditional InEKF\nimplementations that assume full orientation measurements and is particularly\nrelevant for planar vehicle motion constrained to a \"seafaring plane.\" This\npaper details the developed InEKF framework; its integration with horizon-based\nroll/pitch observations and dual-antenna GPS heading measurements for ASV state\nestimation; and provides a comparative analysis against the InEKF using full\norientation and a Multiplicative EKF (MEKF).

In this work, we show that it\nis possible to use such data to measure the characteristic frequency evolution\nof a \"chirp\" induced by gravitational waves, which can serve as robust evidence\nfor the presence of a compact supermassive black-hole binary. Following the\nLSST specifications, we generate mock lightcurves consisting of (i) a\npost-Newtonian chirp produced by orbital motion through, e.g., relativistic\nDoppler boosting, (ii) a damped random walk representing intrinsic quasar\nvariability, and (iii) Gaussian photometric errors, while assuming non-uniform\nobservations with extended gaps over a period of 10 yr.

For chirp signals\nwith an amplitude of $A = 0.5$ mag and a range of times to merger ($t_m =\n15{-}10^4$ yr), we can typically measure a non-zero amplitude and positive\nfrequency derivative with over $5\\sigma$ credibility.

    "abstract": "Automotive radars are one of the essential enablers of advanced driver\nassistance systems (ADASs). Continuous monitoring of the functional safety and\nreliability of automotive radars is a crucial requirement to prevent accidents\nand increase road safety. One of the most critical aspects to monitor in this\ncontext is radar channel imbalances, as they are a key parameter regarding the\nreliability of the radar. These imbalances may originate from several parameter\nvariations or hardware fatigues, e.g., a solder ball break (SBB), and may\naffect some radar processing steps, such as the angle of arrival estimation. In\nthis work, a novel method for online estimation of automotive radar channel\nimbalances is proposed. The proposed method exploits a normalized least mean\nsquares (NLMS) algorithm as a block in the processing chain of the radar to\nestimate the channel imbalances. The input of this block is the detected\ntargets in the range-Doppler map of the radar on the road without any prior\nknowledge on the angular parameters of the targets. This property in\ncombination with low computational complexity of the NLMS, makes the proposed\nmethod suitable for online channel imbalance estimation, in parallel to the\nnormal operation of the radar. Furthermore, it features reduced dependency on\nspecific targets of interest and faster update rates of the channel imbalance\nestimation compared to the majority of state-of-the-art methods. This\nimprovement is achieved by allowing for multiple targets in the angular\nspectrum, whereas most other methods are restricted to only single targets in\nthe angular spectrum. The performance of the proposed method is validated using\nvarious simulation scenarios and is supported by measurement results.",

    "abstract": "Video matting is crucial for applications such as film production and virtual\nreality, yet deploying its computationally intensive models on\nresource-constrained devices presents challenges. Quantization is a key\ntechnique for model compression and acceleration. As an efficient approach,\nPost-Training Quantization (PTQ) is still in its nascent stages for video\nmatting, facing significant hurdles in maintaining accuracy and temporal\ncoherence. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel and general\nPTQ framework specifically designed for video matting models, marking, to the\nbest of our knowledge, the first systematic attempt in this domain. Our\ncontributions include: (1) A two-stage PTQ strategy that combines\nblock-reconstruction-based optimization for fast, stable initial quantization\nand local dependency capture, followed by a global calibration of quantization\nparameters to minimize accuracy loss. (2) A Statistically-Driven Global Affine\nCalibration (GAC) method that enables the network to compensate for cumulative\nstatistical distortions arising from factors such as neglected BN layer\neffects, even reducing the error of existing PTQ methods on video matting tasks\nup to 20%. (3) An Optical Flow Assistance (OFA) component that leverages\ntemporal and semantic priors from frames to guide the PTQ process, enhancing\nthe model's ability to distinguish moving foregrounds in complex scenes and\nultimately achieving near full-precision performance even under ultra-low-bit\nquantization. Comprehensive quantitative and visual results show that our\nPTQ4VM achieves the state-of-the-art accuracy performance across different\nbit-widths compared to the existing quantization methods. We highlight that the\n4-bit PTQ4VM even achieves performance close to the full-precision counterpart\nwhile enjoying 8x FLOP savings.",

    "abstract": "The mechanical behavior of any semiconductor microstructure is inevitably\ncoupled to light. In the case of micro mechanical resonators (MEMs), carrier\ngeneration can affect the quality factor of the resonance through\nelectron-phonon scattering and ohmic losses, but it may also inject energy into\nthe structure and induce movement. Thus, semiconductor MEMs may be regarded as\nintrinsically optomechanical systems. Here, we report on the optical actuation\nof a simple-clamped n-GaAs cantilever. This is achieved through modulated\nnanowatt LED illumination at the resonance frequency. We propose that the\nmechanism responsible for the coupling between light and movement is\npiezoelectrically induced stress in the surface depletion layer. Motion may be\ndetected using two methods: by measuring the piezoelectric voltage generated\ndue to deformation or the current arising due to the capacitance changes. In\nthe latter case, a bias voltage must be applied to the device, which leads to\nnonlinear dynamics. Our results indicate that photothermal and electrostatic\neffects can be ruled out because i) we measure a very small drift of the\nresonance frequency with the light modulation offset which, together with\nfinite-element simulations, indicates photothermal effects are not responsible\nfor actuation, ii) we observe a phase shift under different bias voltage\npolarities, which rules out electrostatic actuation and iii), static\nmeasurements performed using an optical profilometer confirm the piezoelectric\nnature of the interaction with light. In summary, we find homogeneous low power\nLED illumination to be an effective, simple and convenient method of actuation\nfor piezoelectric semiconductor based MEMs.",

Existing\nlanguage-conditioned manipulation tasks typically assume that instructions are\nperfectly aligned with the environment.

To address this problem, we introduce RAtional\nMAnipulation (RAMA), a new benchmark that challenges models with both unseen\nexecutable instructions and defective ones that should be rejected. In RAMA, we\nconstruct a dataset with over 14,000 samples, including diverse defective\ninstructions spanning six dimensions: visual, physical, semantic, motion,\nsafety, and out-of-context. We further propose the Rational\nVision-Language-Action model (RationalVLA). It is a dual system for robotic\narms that integrates the high-level vision-language model with the low-level\nmanipulation policy by introducing learnable latent space embeddings. This\ndesign enables RationalVLA to reason over instructions, reject infeasible\ncommands, and execute manipulation effectively. Experiments demonstrate that\nRationalVLA outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on RAMA by a 14.5% higher\nsuccess rate and 0.94 average task length, while maintaining competitive\nperformance on standard manipulation tasks.

    "abstract": "Following the successful paradigm shift of large language models, leveraging\npre-training on a massive corpus of data and fine-tuning on different\ndownstream tasks, generalist models have made their foray into computer vision.\nThe introduction of Segment Anything Model (SAM) set a milestone on\nsegmentation of natural images, inspiring the design of a multitude of\narchitectures for medical image segmentation. In this survey we offer a\ncomprehensive and in-depth investigation on generalist models for medical image\nsegmentation. We start with an introduction on the fundamentals concepts\nunderpinning their development. Then, we provide a taxonomy on the different\ndeclinations of SAM in terms of zero-shot, few-shot, fine-tuning, adapters, on\nthe recent SAM 2, on other innovative models trained on images alone, and\nothers trained on both text and images. We thoroughly analyze their\nperformances at the level of both primary research and best-in-literature,\nfollowed by a rigorous comparison with the state-of-the-art task-specific\nmodels. We emphasize the need to address challenges in terms of compliance with\nregulatory frameworks, privacy and security laws, budget, and trustworthy\nartificial intelligence (AI). Finally, we share our perspective on future\ndirections concerning synthetic data, early fusion, lessons learnt from\ngeneralist models in natural language processing, agentic AI and physical AI,\nand clinical translation.",

Existing approaches attempt to mitigate this\nissue through curating multiple reasoning chains for training LLMs, but their\neffectiveness is often constrained by the quality of the generated data and\nprone to overfitting. To address the challenge, we propose Reasoning\nCompression ThroUgh Stepwise Trials (ReCUT), a novel method aimed at balancing\nthe accuracy and length of reasoning trajectory. Specifically, ReCUT employs a\nstepwise exploration mechanism and a long-short switched sampling strategy,\nenabling LLMs to incrementally generate diverse reasoning paths. These paths\nare evaluated and used to construct preference pairs to train two specialized\nmodels (Gemini LLMs)-one optimized for reasoning accuracy, the other for\nshorter reasoning. A final integrated model is obtained by interpolating the\nparameters of these two models. Experimental results across multiple math\nreasoning datasets and backbone models demonstrate that ReCUT significantly\nreduces reasoning lengths by approximately 30-50%, while maintaining or\nimproving reasoning accuracy compared to various baselines.

To circumvent this problem and further increase\nthe speedup, we combine the ParaDIn method with the Parareal algorithm to\nefficiently parallelize the first-order time derivative term in nonlinear\npartial differential equations discretized by the method of lines. The main\nidea of the proposed approach is to use a block-Jacobi preconditioner, so that\neach block is solved by using the ParaDIn method. To accelerate the convergence\nof Jacobi iterations, we use the Parareal method which can be interpreted as a\ntwo-level multigrid method in time. In contrast to the conventional Parareal\nalgorithm whose coarse grid correction step is performed sequentially, both the\ncoarse- and fine-grid propagators in the proposed approach are implemented in\nparallel by using the ParaDIn method, thus significantly increasing the\nparallel performance of the combined algorithm. Numerical results show that the\nnew combined ParaDIn-Parareal method provides the speedup of up to 124 on 480\ncomputing cores as compared with the sequential first-order implicit backward\ndifference (BDF1) scheme for the 2-D nonlinear heat and Burgers equations with\nboth smooth and discontinuous solutions.",

To address this challenge, we propose an\nocclusion-aware hand-object pose estimation method based on masked\nautoencoders, termed as HOMAE. Specifically, we propose a target-focused\nmasking strategy that imposes structured occlusion on regions of hand-object\ninteraction, encouraging the model to learn context-aware features and reason\nabout the occluded structures. We further integrate multi-scale features\nextracted from the decoder to predict a signed distance field (SDF), capturing\nboth global context and fine-grained geometry. To enhance geometric perception,\nwe combine the implicit SDF with an explicit point cloud derived from the SDF,\nleveraging the complementary strengths of both representations. This fusion\nenables more robust handling of occluded regions by combining the global\ncontext from the SDF with the precise local geometry provided by the point\ncloud.

In 2D models, an ad hoc softening\nprescription is commonly used for self-gravity, but this overlooks the vertical\nstructure's impact, suppresses the Newtonian nature of gravity at short\ndistances and doesn't respect Newton's third law.\n  To address these issues, associated with a Plummer potential approximation,\nwe developed an exact self-gravity kernel for thin, hydrostatically supported\ndiscs, including a dust fluid component. Our analytical framework provides a\nprecise 2D self-gravity prescription validated by benchmarks and 2D/3D\nnumerical tests.\n  The derived kernel, based on modified Bessel functions, maintains Newtonian\ngravitation features, such as point-wise symmetry, a smooth transition from\nlight to massive discs and a singularity at zero distance, among others. In\ncontrast to other prescriptions found in the literature, it proves capable of\nleading to an additional, and previously unnoticed, source of gravitational\nrunaway discernible only at infinitesimal distances.\n  We finally note that our new prescription remains compatible with methods\nbased on the fast Fourier transform, affording superior computational\nefficiency. Our exact kernel formulation overcomes substantial limitations\ninherent in the smoothing-length approach. It permits a novel, fully consistent\ntreatment of self-gravity in Gaussian-stratified thin discs. The approach, that\nmakes the usage of the Plummer potential obsolete, will prove useful to\nstudying all common planet formation scenarios, which are often backed by\n2D-flat numerical simulations.

One such technique, which has\nbeen heralded as a model-independent method, is the use of ``scrambling''\ntransformations that modify the data to cancel out pulsar correlations, thereby\nsimulating realizations from $H_0$. In this work, scrambling methods and the\ndetection statistic are investigated from first principles. The $p$-value\nmethodology that is discussed is general, but the discussions regarding a\nspecific detection statistic apply to the detection of a stochastic background\nof gravitational waves with PTAs. All methods in the literature to calculate\n$p$-values for such a detection statistic are rigorously analyzed, and many\nanalytical expressions are derived. All this leads to the conclusion that\nscrambling methods are \\emph{not} model-independent and thus not completely\nempirical. Rigorous Bayesian and Frequentist $p$-value calculation methods are\nadvocated, the evaluation of which depend on the generalized $\\chi^2$\ndistribution. This view is consistent with the posterior predictive $p$-value\napproach that is already in the literature. Efficient expressions are derived\nto evaluate the generalized $\\chi^2$ distribution of the detection statistic on\nreal data. It is highlighted that no Frequentist $p$-values have been\ncalculated correctly in the PTA literature to date.",

Our pipeline (i) segments raw\nvideo footage into coherent scenes, (ii) generates rich scene-level\ndescriptions through a memory-efficient, batch-style VidLM prompting scheme\nthat scales to hours-long videos on a single GPU, (iii) leverages an LLM as a\njudge to assign scene-level importance scores under a carefully crafted prompt,\nand finally, (iv) propagates those scores to short segments level via two new\nmetrics: consistency (temporal coherency) and uniqueness (novelty), yielding\nfine-grained frame importance. On SumMe and TVSum, our data-free approach\nsurpasses all prior data-hungry unsupervised methods.

MAGIC is implemented through\nreplicated encoding and decoding branches of an nnU-Net-based, U-shaped\nbackbone conserving the function of a single model. Twenty cardiac\nsubstructures (heart, chambers, great vessels (GVs), valves, coronary arteries\n(CAs), and conduction nodes) from simulation CT (Sim-CT), low-field MR-Linac,\nand cardiac CT angiography (CCTA) modalities were manually delineated and used\nto train (n=76), validate (n=15), and test (n=30) MAGIC. Twelve comparison\nmodels (four segmentation subgroups across three modalities) were equivalently\ntrained. All methods were compared for training efficiency and against\nreference contours using the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and two-tailed\nWilcoxon Signed-Rank test (threshold, p<0.05). Average DSC scores were\n0.75(0.16) for Sim-CT, 0.68(0.21) for MR-Linac, and 0.80(0.16) for CCTA. MAGIC\noutperforms the comparison in 57% of cases, with limited statistical\ndifferences. MAGIC offers an effective and accurate segmentation solution that\nis lightweight and capable of segmenting multiple modalities and overlapping\nstructures in a single model. MAGIC further enables clinical implementation by\nsimplifying the computational requirements and offering unparalleled\nflexibility for clinical settings.",

Actually, for a\nconformal fluid, the behavior of the system only depends on the ratio between\nthe thermal and the magnetic pressure, the so-called plasma beta-parameter,\nacting as a scaling variable. Our calculation, starting from a relativistic\nBoltzmann-Vlasov equation, is based on a generalized Chapman-Enskog approach in\nwhich space-time gradients and the local electric field are treated as\nfirst-order quantities in a perturbative expansion, while terms containing\nmagnetic corrections are considered of zeroth order and hence self-consistently\nresummed. We find that, also in the strong-field limit, for each conserved\ncharge a generalized Wiedemann-Franz law, connecting charge conductivity and\ndiffusion coefficient, exists. However these transport coefficients acquire a\nnon-trivial tensor structure, reflecting the development of a longitudinal, a\ntransverse and a Hall current as a response to electric fields or density\ngradients.",

Their ability to enhance\ntunneling magnetoresistance in magnetic tunnel junctions, combined with the\ndirect control of spin currents via electric fields, makes them highly\npromising for spintronic devices. Moreover, the rich electronic structure of\naltermagnets can host nontrivial topological phases. In particular, topological\ncrystalline insulators are compounds where the topological states are protected\nby both crystalline and time-reversal symmetries. Furthermore, manipulating the\nstate of a system between topological and trivial phases through external\nparameters unlocks new possibilities for quantum materials and advanced\nelectronics. We show the edge states of a 2D altermagnetic topological\ncrystalline insulator, using as a representative example Cr$_2$BAl, a 2D MBene\nmetallic altermagnet with a d$_{x^2-y^2}$ altermagnetic ordering. We find that\nthe system can host an altermagnetic phase with extremely large ``weak\nferrimagnetism\" which is sizeable also with light atoms, only with an in-plane\ncomponent of the N\\'eel vector. The electronic structure of Cr$_2$BAl presents\nmultiple crossings and anti-crossings in the vicinity of the Fermi level along\n[100] and [010] directions. When the spin-orbit coupling interaction is\nincluded, with the N\\'eel vector along [001] direction, energy gaps open at the\nband crossing points, resulting in a pronounced peak in the spin Hall\nconductivity. The simulated Cr-B terminated [100] edge-projected band structure\nreveals Dirac dispersions at the bulk crossings and anti-crossings, which are\nabsent in Cr-Al terminations.",

Currently, object-centric dynamic simulation methods,\nwhich emulate human behavior, have achieved notable progress but overlook two\ncritical aspects: 1) the integration of physical knowledge into models. Humans\ngain physical insights by observing the world and apply this knowledge to\naccurately reason about various dynamic scenarios; 2) the validation of model\nadaptability across diverse scenarios. Real-world dynamics, especially those\ninvolving fluids and objects, demand models that not only capture object\ninteractions but also simulate fluid flow characteristics.

Most quantities of interest pertain to the primary\nfission fragments, whose subsequent decay is typically modeled using\nstatistical reaction models. Consequently, a key objective of fission theory is\nto inform these models by predicting the initial conditions of the primary\nfragments. In this work, we employ a framework that combines joint angular\nmomentum and particle number projection with time-dependent configuration\nmixing to calculate the angular momentum distributions of primary fragments.\nFocusing on the benchmark cases of neutron-induced fission of $^{235}$U and\n$^{239}$Pu, we predict - for the first time - microscopic angular momentum\ndistributions for all fragments observed in experiments. Our results reveal a\npronounced sawtooth pattern in the average angular momentum as a function of\nfragment mass, consistent with recent measurements. Additionally, we observe\nsubstantial variations in angular momentum distributions along isobaric chains,\nindicating that commonly used empirical formulas lack sufficient accuracy. We\nalso quantify a strong correlation between the angular momentum and the\ndeformation of the fragments at scission, and a weak correlation in the\nmagnitude of the angular momentum between fragment partners.

In this work, we investigate the detection and localization\ncapabilities of future sub-mHz GW observatories for MBBH coalescences.\nIncluding the full galactic foreground noise, we find that signal-to-noise\nratios (SNRs) can reach several thousand across a wide range of redshifts. We\nevaluate three representative orbital configurations--non-precessing and\nprecessing with different inclination angles--and analyze their localization\nperformance for various MBBH populations. In the non-precessing case, a\ntwo-hemisphere degeneracy arises when only the dominant (2,2) mode is\nconsidered, which is effectively resolved by including higher-order modes.\nThese modes contribute to a more uniform performance across all configurations,\nthereby mitigating the prior advantage of precessing mission orbits. Sub-mHz\nmissions operating in the [10 $\\mu$Hz, 10 mHz] band partially overlap with\nLISA's range but provide enhanced sensitivity to lower-frequency GWs due to\ntheir longer interferometric baselines. This results in significantly improved\nlocalization of high-mass MBBHs, enhancing the prospects for multi-messenger\nastronomy and precision cosmology. Moreover, the high SNRs attainable with\nsub-mHz detectors could enable stringent tests of general relativity and\nalternative theories of gravity.",

We define\nthe notion of a causal graph to represent such relations and use Answer Set\nProgramming (ASP), a declarative logic programming method, to find how to\ncoordinate perception and simulation modules. We validate the effectiveness of\nour approach on two benchmarks, CLEVRER and CRAFT. Our enhancement achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on the CLEVRER challenge, significantly\noutperforming existing models. In the case of the CRAFT benchmark, we leverage\na large pre-trained language model, such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, as a proxy for a\ndynamics simulator. Our findings show that this method can further improve its\nperformance on counterfactual questions by providing alternative prompts\ninstructed by symbolic causal reasoning.",

    "abstract": "Variability of millimetre wavelength continuum emission from Class II\nprotoplanetary disks is extremely rare, and when detected it is usually\ninterpreted as originating from non-thermal emission mechanisms that relate to\nthe host star itself rather than its disk. During observations made as part of\nthe AGE-PRO ALMA Large program, significant variability in the brightness of\nthe 2MASS J16202863-2442087 system was detected between individual executions.\nWe report the observed properties of the variability detected at millimetre\nwavelengths and investigate potential driving mechanisms. To investigate the\nnature of the variability we construct a light curve from the continuum\nobservations and analyse imaged constructed from both flaring and quiescent\nemission. We characterise the dust disk around the star through analysis in the\nimage and visibility plane, and carry out kinematic analysis of the CO(2-1)\nemission from the gas disk. The continuum flux decays by a factor of 8 in less\nthan an hour, and by a factor of 13 within 8 days. The peak brightness\ncoincides with an expected brightness maximum extrapolated from the periodicity\nof previously observed optical variability. The flare is most likely the\nproduct of synchrotron emission in the close vicinity of the star. The nature\nof the millimetre flare closely resembles those detected in very close binary\nsystems, and may be due to the interaction of magnetic fields in an as yet\nundetected binary. Alternatively if the central host is a single-star object,\nthe flare may be due to the interaction of magnetic field loops at the stellar\nsurface or a strong accretion burst.",

From the unconvolved best fit models we\nmeasure the gas disk size (RCO,90%[model]), which we combine with the dust disk\nsize (Rdust,90%[FRANK]) from continuum visibility fits from Vioque et al.\n(2025, in press.) to compute beam-corrected gas-to-dust size ratios. In our\nsample we find gas-to-dust size ratios between ~1 and ~5.5, with a median value\nof 2.78(+0.37,-0.32). Contrary to models of dust evolution that predict an\nincreasing size ratio with time, we find that the younger disks in Lupus have\nsimilar (or even larger) median ratios (3.02(+0.33,-0.33)) than the older disks\nin Upper Sco (2.46(+0.53,-0.38)). A possible explanation to this discrepancy is\nthat pebble drift is halted in dust traps combined with truncation of the gas\ndisk by external photo-evaporation in Upper Sco, although survivorship bias\ncould also play a role.",

A systematic method is proposed to constrain the\ndistribution of disk parameters from the disk fractions, accretion rates, disk\ngas masses, and CO gas sizes. We find that turbulence-driven accretion with\ninitially compact disks ($R_0 \\simeq 5-20~$au), low mass-loss rates, and\nrelatively long viscous timescales ($t_{\\nu,0} \\simeq 0.4-3~$Myr or\n$\\alpha_{SS} \\simeq 2-4 \\times 10^{-4}$) can reproduce the disk fraction and\ngas sizes. However, the distribution of apparent disk lifetime defined as the\n$M_D/\\dot{M}_*$ ratio is severely overestimated by turbulence-driven models. On\nthe other hand, MHD wind-driven accretion can reproduce the bulk properties of\nthe disk populations from Ophiuchus to Upper Sco assuming compact disks with an\ninitial magnetization of about $\\beta \\simeq 10^5$ ($\\alpha_{DW} \\simeq 0.5-1\n\\times 10^{-3}$) and a magnetic field that declines with time.

    "abstract": "Generating aesthetic posters is more challenging than simple design images:\nit requires not only precise text rendering but also the seamless integration\nof abstract artistic content, striking layouts, and overall stylistic harmony.\nTo address this, we propose PosterCraft, a unified framework that abandons\nprior modular pipelines and rigid, predefined layouts, allowing the model to\nfreely explore coherent, visually compelling compositions. PosterCraft employs\na carefully designed, cascaded workflow to optimize the generation of\nhigh-aesthetic posters: (i) large-scale text-rendering optimization on our\nnewly introduced Text-Render-2M dataset; (ii) region-aware supervised\nfine-tuning on HQ-Poster100K; (iii) aesthetic-text-reinforcement learning via\nbest-of-n preference optimization; and (iv) joint vision-language feedback\nrefinement. Each stage is supported by a fully automated data-construction\npipeline tailored to its specific needs, enabling robust training without\ncomplex architectural modifications. Evaluated on multiple experiments,\nPosterCraft significantly outperforms open-source baselines in rendering\naccuracy, layout coherence, and overall visual appeal-approaching the quality\nof SOTA commercial systems.

    "abstract": "The potential for planet formation of a circumstellar disk depends on the\ndust and gas reservoirs, which evolve as a function of the disk age. The ALMA\nLarge Program AGE-PRO has measured several disk properties across three\nstar-forming regions of different ages, and in this study we compare the\nobservational results to dust evolution simulations. Using DustPy for the dust\nevolution, and RADMC-3D for the radiative transfer, we ran a large grid of\nmodels spanning stellar masses of 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, and 1.0 $M_\\odot$, with\ndifferent initial conditions, including: disk sizes, disk gas masses, and\ndust-to-gas ratio, and viscosity. Our models are performed assuming smooth,\nweakly, or strongly substructured disks, aiming to investigate if any\nobservational trend can favor or exclude the presence of dust traps. The\nobserved gas masses in the disks of the AGE-PRO sample are not reproducible\nwith our models, which only consider viscous evolution with constant $\\alpha$,\nsuggesting that additional physical mechanisms play a role in the evolution of\nthe gas mass of disks. When comparing the dust continuum emission fluxes and\nsizes at 1.3 mm, we find that most of the disks in the AGE-PRO sample are\nconsistent with simulations that have either weak or strong dust traps. The\nevolution of spectral index in the AGE-PRO sample is also suggestive of an\nunresolved population of dust traps. Future observations at high angular\nresolution are still needed to test several hypotheses that result from\ncomparing the observations to our simulations, including that more massive\ndisks in gas mass have the potential to form dust traps at larger disk radii.",

Forward invariance properties of the resulting\nset with respect to the system dynamics and input limitations are then proved\nvia non-smooth analysis. We then present a modified RRT$^{\\star}$ algorithm to\nsynthesize asymptotically optimal and dynamically feasible trajectories\nsatisfying a given STL specification, by sampling a tree of trajectories within\nthe previously constructed time-varying set.

AGE-PRO\ncovers a sample of 30 disks around similar spectral type (M3-K6) stars with\nages between 0.1 and 10 Myr. Our approach is to simultaneously fit observations\nof CO isotopologues and N2H+, a complementary molecule produced when CO freezes\nout. We find that the median gas mass of the three regions decreases over time,\nfrom 7.0(+4.4,-2.6)x10^-3 Msun in Ophiuchus (<1 Myr) to 9.4(+5.4,-3.4)x10^-4\nMsun for Lupus (~1-3 Myr) and 6.8(+5.1,-2.8)x10^-4 Msun for Upper Sco (~2-6\nMyr), with ~1 dex scatter in gas mass in each region. We note that the gas mass\ndistributions for Lupus and Upper Sco look very similar, which could be due to\nsurvivorship bias for the latter. The median bulk CO abundance in the CO\nemitting layer is found to be a factor ~10 lower than the ISM value but does\nnot significantly change between Lupus and Upper Sco.

While expert-curated taxonomies have\ntraditionally addressed this need, the process is time-consuming and expensive.\nFurthermore, recent automatic taxonomy construction methods either (1)\nover-rely on a specific corpus, sacrificing generalizability, or (2) depend\nheavily on the general knowledge of large language models (LLMs) contained\nwithin their pre-training datasets, often overlooking the dynamic nature of\nevolving scientific domains. Additionally, these approaches fail to account for\nthe multi-faceted nature of scientific literature, where a single research\npaper may contribute to multiple dimensions (e.g., methodology, new tasks,\nevaluation metrics, benchmarks). To address these gaps, we propose TaxoAdapt, a\nframework that dynamically adapts an LLM-generated taxonomy to a given corpus\nacross multiple dimensions.

Our protocol enables exact embezzlement of arbitrary\nbipartite pure states using a single, fixed catalyst state. Unlike prior\nconstructions that achieve only approximate embezzlement or require\nstate-dependent catalysts, our approach is both exact and state-independent.\nThe construction is explicit, based on simple *-automorphisms acting locally on\ninfinite tensor products of CAR algebras with the underlying idea of the\nHilbert hotel. In the dense-state case, the protocol naturally recovers the\nType III_1 factor via the GNS construction, consistent with recent\nclassification results. We further extend the construction to allow exact\nembezzlement of all states, at the cost of working with a non-separable\nC*-algebra. Despite the increase in algebraic size, the operational structure\nremains simple and localized. This offers a conceptually intuitive model for\nuniversal entanglement embezzlement in infinite-dimensional settings.",

This work focuses on ten evolved disks in Upper Scorpius, observed in\ndust continuum emission, CO and its isotopologues, and N$_2$H$^+$ with ALMA\nBands 6 and 7. Disk radii, from the radial location enclosing 68% of the flux,\nare comparable to those in the younger Lupus region for both gas and dust\ntracers. However, solid masses are about an order of magnitude below those in\nLupus and Ophiuchus, while the dust spectral index suggests some level of dust\nevolution. These empirical findings align with a combination of radial drift,\ndust trapping, and grain growth into larger bodies. A moderate correlation\nbetween CO and continuum fluxes suggests a link between gas and dust content,\nthrough the increased scatter compared to younger regions, possibly due to age\nvariations, gas-to-dust ratio differences, or CO depletion. Additionally, the\ncorrelation between C$^{18}$O and N$_2$H$^+$ fluxes observed in Lupus persists\nin Upper Sco, indicating a relatively stable CO gas abundance over the Class II\nstage of disk evolution. In conclusion, the AGE-PRO survey of Upper Scorpius\ndisks reveals intriguing trends in disk evolution. The findings point towards\npotential gas evolution and the presence of dust traps in these older disks.\nFuture high-resolution observations are needed to confirm these possibilities\nand further refine our understanding of disk evolution and planet formation in\nolder environments.",

    "abstract": "Recently, the rapid advancements of vision-language models, such as CLIP,\nleads to significant progress in zero-/few-shot anomaly detection (ZFSAD)\ntasks. However, most existing CLIP-based ZFSAD methods commonly assume prior\nknowledge of categories and rely on carefully crafted prompts tailored to\nspecific scenarios. While such meticulously designed text prompts effectively\ncapture semantic information in the textual space, they fall short of\ndistinguishing normal and anomalous instances within the joint embedding space.\nMoreover, these ZFSAD methods are predominantly explored in industrial\nscenarios, with few efforts conducted to medical tasks. To this end, we propose\nan innovative framework for ZFSAD tasks in medical domain, denoted as IQE-CLIP.\nWe reveal that query embeddings, which incorporate both textual and\ninstance-aware visual information, are better indicators for abnormalities.\nSpecifically, we first introduce class-based prompting tokens and learnable\nprompting tokens for better adaptation of CLIP to the medical domain. Then, we\ndesign an instance-aware query module (IQM) to extract region-level contextual\ninformation from both text prompts and visual features, enabling the generation\nof query embeddings that are more sensitive to anomalies. Extensive experiments\nconducted on six medical datasets demonstrate that IQE-CLIP achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on both zero-shot and few-shot tasks.

    "abstract": "Quantum manipulation of molecular radical spins provides a crucial platform\nfor exploring emergent phenomena in many-body systems. Here, we combine\nsurface-confined synthesis with scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) tip-induced\ndehydrogenation to achieve atom-precise engineering of quasi-one-dimensional\nporphyrin-based Kondo chains (1-7 units) on Au(111). Key design innovations\nleverage large-sized porphyrins to suppress intrachain antiferromagnetic\ncoupling, while ${Zn}^{2+}$ chelation at porphyrin cores enhances\nmolecule-substrate interactions to amplify Kondo effect. High-resolution STS\nmeasurements and low-energy effective modeling collectively demonstrate that\n${\\pi}$-radicals at each fused-porphyrin unit form Kondo singlets screened by\nconduction electrons. Adjacent singlets develop direct coherent coupling via\nquantum-state-overlap-enabled electron tunneling. Crucially, chiral symmetry in\nthe effective model governs zero-mode distribution-present in odd-length chains\nyet absent in even-length chains-which dictates pronounced odd-even quantum\neffects in STS spectra of finite chains. Furthermore, geometric control emerges\nthrough conformational distortions modulated by chain fusion width. This\nenables directional tuning of the competition between Kondo screening and\nmagnetic exchange. Tilted single/fused-triple-porphyrin chains weaken spin\nexchange through enhanced Kondo coupling, while parallel fused-double-porphyrin\nchains suppress Kondo screening via increased spin exchange. This opposing\nmodulation of Kondo versus exchange interactions establishes an inverse control\nparadigm. This work simultaneously resolves the dimensional dependence of\nmany-body correlations in confined quantum systems and pioneers approaches for\nquantum-critical manipulation in molecular spin architectures.",

However, a claim (e.g., \"vaccine A is better\nthan vaccine B\") can be dissected into its integral aspects and sub-aspects\n(e.g., efficacy, safety, distribution), which are individually easier to\nvalidate. This enables a more comprehensive, structured response that provides\na well-rounded perspective on a given problem while also allowing the reader to\nprioritize specific angles of interest within the claim (e.g., safety towards\nchildren). Thus, we propose ClaimSpect, a retrieval-augmented generation-based\nframework for automatically constructing a hierarchy of aspects typically\nconsidered when addressing a claim and enriching them with corpus-specific\nperspectives. This structure hierarchically partitions an input corpus to\nretrieve relevant segments, which assist in discovering new sub-aspects.\nMoreover, these segments enable the discovery of varying perspectives towards\nan aspect of the claim (e.g., support, neutral, or oppose) and their respective\nprevalence (e.g., \"how many biomedical papers believe vaccine A is more\ntransportable than B?\"). We apply ClaimSpect to a wide variety of real-world\nscientific and political claims featured in our constructed dataset, showcasing\nits robustness and accuracy in deconstructing a nuanced claim and representing\nperspectives within a corpus.

Our analysis reveals that the stochastic equations exhibit two\ndistinct branches of the intrinsic growth rate, corresponding to alternative\nstable states characterized by higher and lower growth rates.\n  Notably, while the logistic model does not show a transition from a steady\nstate to chaos, the Ricker model undergoes such a transition when the shape\nparameter of the gamma distribution is small.

The proposed\nresults have been proved exploiting the regularization and approximation\nproperties of certain Steklov integrals introduced by Sendov and Popov in 1983,\nand differ from the ones given by Kolomoitsev and Lomako. In addition, the\nproof of the original KL approximation theorems were strictly related to the\napplication of certain classical results of the trigonometric best\napproximation, and thus, they are applicable only for operators of the\ntrigonometric type. By the definition of semi-discrete moduli of smoothness\nhere proposed, we are able to deduce applications also for operators that are\nnot necessarily of the trigonometric type, and can also be used to derive\nsharper estimates than those that can be achieved by the classical averaged\nmoduli of smoothness ($\\tau$-moduli). Furthermore, a Rathore-type theorem is\nestablished, and a new notion of K-functional is also introduced showing its\nequivalence with the semi-discrete modulus of smoothness and its realization.\nOne-sided estimates of approximation can be established for classical operators\non bounded domains, such as the Bernstein polynomials. In the case of\napproximation operators on the whole real line, one-sided estimates can be\nachieved, e.g., for the Shannon sampling (cardinal) series, as well as for the\nso-called generalized sampling operators.

Our\ncomprehensive experiments on multiple datasets (CIFAR-10, GTSRB, and\nImageNet100) and model architectures (ResNet20, ResNet101) show that TED-LaST\neffectively counteracts sophisticated backdoors like Adap-Blend, Adapt-Patch,\nand the proposed enhanced adaptive attack.

It uses a carefully\nselected sample of 30 disks around M3-K6 stars in three nearby star-forming\nregions: Ophiuchus (0.5-1 Myr), Lupus (1-3 Myr), and Upper Sco (2-6 Myr).\nAssuming the three regions had similar initial conditions and evolutionary\npaths, we find the median gas disk mass appears to decrease with age. Ophiuchus\ndisks have the highest median gas mass (6 M$_{\\rm Jup}$), while the Lupus and\nUpper Sco disks have significantly lower median masses (0.68 and 0.44 M$_{\\rm\nJup}$, respectively). Notably, the gas and dust disk masses appear to evolve on\ndifferent timescales. This is evidenced by the median gas-to-dust mass ratio,\nwhich decreases from 122 in the youngest disks ($<$1 Myr) to 46 in Lupus disks,\nand then increases to 120 in the Upper Sco disks.

The problem of determining\nwhether an input graph is $1$-planar is known to be NP-complete even for\nnear-planar graphs [Cabello and Mohar, SIAM J.

Unlike prior work, PREMISE runs in a\nsingle-pass black-box interface, so it can be applied directly to commercial\nLLMs. On GSM8K, SVAMP, and Math500 we match or exceed baseline accuracy\n($96\\%\\rightarrow96\\%$ with Claude, $91\\%\\rightarrow92\\%$ with Gemini) while\nreducing reasoning tokens by up to $87.5\\%$ and cutting dollar cost by\n$69$--$82\\%$. These results show that prompt-level optimization is a practical\nand scalable path to efficient LRM inference without compromising reasoning\nquality.",

UMBD\nintroduces an uncertainty-guided masking mechanism that selectively applies\nBernoulli diffusion to residual regions with poor segmentation quality,\nenabling targeted refinement while preserving correctly segmented areas. To\nsupport this process, we design the Hybrid Uncertainty Quantification Network\n(HUQNet), which employs a multi-branch architecture and fuses uncertainty from\nmultiple sources to improve estimation accuracy. This enables adaptive guidance\nduring the generative sampling process. The proposed UMBD framework can be\nseamlessly integrated with a wide range of existing Encoder-Decoder-based COD\nmodels, combining their discriminative capabilities with the generative\nadvantages of diffusion-based refinement. Extensive experiments across multiple\nCOD benchmarks demonstrate consistent performance improvements, achieving\naverage gains of 5.5% in MAE and 3.2% in weighted F-measure with only modest\ncomputational overhead.

    "abstract": "Generating accurate and stable long rollouts is a notorious challenge for\ntime-dependent PDEs (Partial Differential Equations). Recently, motivated by\nthe importance of high-frequency accuracy, a refiner model called PDERefiner\nutilizes diffusion models to refine outputs for every time step, since the\ndenoising process could increase the correctness of modeling high frequency\npart. For 1-D Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, refiner models can degrade the\namplitude of high frequency part better than not doing refinement process.\nHowever, for some other cases, the spectrum might be more complicated. For\nexample, for a harder PDE like Navior-Stokes equation, diffusion models could\nover-degrade the higher frequency part. This motivates us to release the\nconstraint that each frequency weighs the same. We enhance our refiner model\nwith doing adjustments on spectral space, which recovers Blurring diffusion\nmodels. We developed a new v-prediction technique for Blurring diffusion\nmodels, recovering the MSE training objective on the first refinement step. We\nshow that in this case, for different model backbones, such as U-Net and neural\noperators, the outputs of PDE-SpectralRefiner are more accurate for both\none-step MSE loss and rollout loss.",

To mirror real-life\nscenarios, we introduce the task of continual learning of instances and\nclasses, at the same time. This task challenges models to adapt to multiple\nlevels of granularity over time, which requires balancing fine-grained instance\nrecognition with coarse-grained class generalization. In this paper, we\nidentify that classes and instances naturally form a hierarchical structure. To\nmodel these hierarchical relationships, we propose HyperCLIC, a continual\nlearning algorithm that leverages hyperbolic space, which is uniquely suited\nfor hierarchical data due to its ability to represent tree-like structures with\nlow distortion and compact embeddings. Our framework incorporates hyperbolic\nclassification and distillation objectives, enabling the continual embedding of\nhierarchical relations. To evaluate performance across multiple granularities,\nwe introduce continual hierarchical metrics. We validate our approach on\nEgoObjects, the only dataset that captures the complexity of hierarchical\nobject recognition in dynamic real-world environments.

In particular,\nwe illustrate that qualitatively correct results can often be obtained by using\njust a few fully flexible Gaussians that describe the unbound dynamics for both\nTDHF and TDDFT. Grid calculations can be reproduced quantitatively using\n$30$--$100$ Gaussians for intensities up to $4\\times10^{14}$ W/cm$^2$ for the\none-dimensional molecular systems considered in this work.",

    "abstract": "We present observations of SN~2023xgo, a transitional Type Ibn/Icn supernova,\nfrom $-5.6$ to $+63$~days relative to the $r$-band peak. Early spectra show\nC~III $\\lambda 5696$ emission reminiscent of Type~Icn SNe, which later gives\nway to Type~Ibn features. The He~I velocities ($1800$--$10{,}000$~km~s$^{-1}$)\nand pseudo-equivalent widths are among the highest in the Ibn/Icn class. The\nlight curve declines at $0.14$~mag~d$^{-1}$ until $+30$~days, consistent with\nSNe~Ibn/Icn and slower than fast transients. SN~2023xgo is the faintest in our\nSN~Ibn sample ($M_r=-17.65\\pm0.04$) but shows typical color and host\nproperties. Semi-analytical modeling of the light curve suggests a compact CSM\nshell ($\\sim 10^{12}$--$10^{13}$~cm) and a mass-loss rate of\n$10^{-4}$--$10^{-3}$~$M_{\\odot}$~yr$^{-1}$, with CSM and ejecta masses of $\\sim\n0.22$ and $0.12$~$M_{\\odot}$, respectively. Post-maximum light-curve and\nspectral modeling favor a $\\sim 3$~$M_{\\odot}$ helium-star progenitor with\nextended ($\\sim 10^{15}$~cm), stratified CSM (density exponent $n=2.9$) and a\nmass-loss rate of $0.1$--$2.7$~$M_{\\odot}$~yr$^{-1}$. These two mass-loss\nregimes imply a radially varying CSM, shaped by asymmetry or temporal changes\nin the progenitor's mass loss. This behavior is compatible with both binary and\nsingle-star evolution. We argue that the early Icn-like features arise from hot\ncarbon ionization and fade to Ibn-like signatures as the ejecta and CSM cool,\nmaking SN~2023xgo a rare probe of the connection between SNe~Icn, SNe~Ibn, and\nIbn events with ejecta signatures.",

To address this, split-network Deep Neural Network\n(DNN) based Joint Source-Channel Coding (JSCC) schemes are used to extract and\ntransmit relevant features instead of raw data. However, most existing methods\nrely on fixed network splits and static configurations, lacking adaptability to\nvarying computational budgets and channel conditions. In this paper, we propose\na novel SNR- and computation-adaptive distributed CNN framework for wireless\nimage classification across IoT devices and edge servers. We introduce a\nlearning-assisted intelligent Genetic Algorithm (LAIGA) that efficiently\nexplores the CNN hyperparameter space to optimize network configuration under\ngiven FLOPs constraints and given SNR. LAIGA intelligently discards the\ninfeasible network configurations that exceed computational budget at IoT\ndevice. It also benefits from the Random Forests based learning assistance to\navoid a thorough exploration of hyperparameter space and to induce application\nspecific bias in candidate optimal configurations. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms fixed-split architectures\nand existing SNR-adaptive methods, especially under low SNR and limited\ncomputational resources. We achieve a 10\\% increase in classification accuracy\nas compared to existing JSCC based SNR-adaptive multilayer framework at an SNR\nas low as -10dB across a range of available computational budget (1M to 70M\nFLOPs) at IoT device.",

Nanotextures in\nperovskite solar cells optimise light trapping and scattering, thereby\nimproving optical absorption. In addition, nanotextures have been\nexperimentally shown to enhance electronic performance, in particular, by\nincreasing the open-circuit voltage $V_{\\text{OC}}$ -- a phenomenon that, until\nnow, has remained not fully understood. This study investigates the underlying\nreasons by combining multi-dimensional optical and charge-transport simulations\nfor a single-junction perovskite solar cell. Our results reveal that the\nincreased open-circuit voltage is not driven by optical effects but by the\ntextured geometry itself.

While idealised solar cells benefit unconditionally from increasing\ntexture height, in realistic cells there is an optimal texture height which\nmaximizes the power conversion efficiency.

We employ the upsampling\ntechnique to deal with the imbalanced data scenarios and demonstrate that while\nthis method benefits traditional approaches, it does not have as much impact on\nLLMs. This study demonstrates a great potential of LLMs for real-world\nlife-threatening language detection problems.",

Existing adversarial attack\nmethods often rely on the original image characteristics, resulting in\ndistortions that hinder human interpretation and limit their applicability in\nscenarios where no initial input images are available. To address these\nchallenges, we propose the Unsourced Adversarial CAPTCHA (DAC), a novel\nframework that generates high-fidelity adversarial examples guided by\nattacker-specified semantics information. Leveraging a Large Language Model\n(LLM), DAC enhances CAPTCHA diversity and enriches the semantic information. To\naddress various application scenarios, we examine the white-box targeted attack\nscenario and the black box untargeted attack scenario. For target attacks, we\nintroduce two latent noise variables that are alternately guided in the\ndiffusion step to achieve robust inversion. The synergy between gradient\nguidance and latent variable optimization achieved in this way ensures that the\ngenerated adversarial examples not only accurately align with the target\nconditions but also achieve optimal performance in terms of distributional\nconsistency and attack effectiveness. In untargeted attacks, especially for\nblack-box scenarios, we introduce bi-path unsourced adversarial CAPTCHA\n(BP-DAC), a two-step optimization strategy employing multimodal gradients and\nbi-path optimization for efficient misclassification. Experiments show that the\ndefensive adversarial CAPTCHA generated by BP-DAC is able to defend against\nmost of the unknown models, and the generated CAPTCHA is indistinguishable to\nboth humans and DNNs.",

We develop a general framework to determine when collider\nmeasurements can, in principle, saturate the QFI in an entangled biparticle\nsystem, and this framework extends naturally to other such systems. Within this\nframework, QFI saturation occurs if and only if the symmetric logarithmic\nderivative (SLD) commutes with a complete set of orthonormal separable\nprojectors associated with collider-accessible measurements.

In addition, well-known prototype-based approaches typically learn\nextremely granular prototypes that are less interpretable in medical imaging,\nwhere both the presence and extent of biomarkers and lesions are critical.\n  Methods: To address these challenges, we propose PiPViT (Patch-based Visual\nInterpretable Prototypes), an inherently interpretable prototypical model for\nimage recognition. Leveraging a vision transformer (ViT), PiPViT captures\nlong-range dependencies among patches to learn robust, human-interpretable\nprototypes that approximate lesion extent only using image-level labels.\nAdditionally, PiPViT benefits from contrastive learning and multi-resolution\ninput processing, which enables effective localization of biomarkers across\nscales.\n  Results: We evaluated PiPViT on retinal OCT image classification across four\ndatasets, where it achieved competitive quantitative performance compared to\nstate-of-the-art methods while delivering more meaningful explanations.\nMoreover, quantitative evaluation on a hold-out test set confirms that the\nlearned prototypes are semantically and clinically relevant.

A novel\nchannel estimation protocol, according to which the RIS receives non-orthogonal\ntraining pilot sequences from two multi-antenna terminals via tunable\nabsorption phase profiles, and then, estimates the respective channels via its\nsignal processing unit, is presented. The channel estimates are particularly\nused by the RIS controller to design the capacity-achieving reflection phase\nconfiguration of the metasurface front end. The proposed channel estimation\nalgorithm, which is based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers\n(ADMM), profits from the RIS random spatial absorption sampling to capture the\nentire signal space, and exploits the beamspace sparsity and low-rank\nproperties of extremely large MIMO channels, which is particularly relevant for\ncommunication systems at the FR3 band and above.

The recorded absorptions coefficients of the mixed\nspecimen materials are naturally stored in a third-order tensor, with spatial\nhorizontal and vertical axes, and an energy axis. To speed the X-ray\nspectromicroscopy measurement process up, only a fraction of tubes from (a\nreshaped version of) this tensor are fully scanned, leading to a tensor\ncompletion problem. In this framework we can apply any transform (such as the\nFourier transform) to the tensor tube by tube, providing a natural way to work\nwith the $\\star_{M}$-tensor algebra, and propose: (1) a tensor completion\nalgorithm that is essentially ASD reformulated in the $\\star_{M}$-induced\nmetric space and (2) a tensor completion algorithm that solves a set of\n(readily parallelizable) independent matrix completion problems for the frontal\nslices of the transformed tensor.

For adaptation to a new\nspeaker, there is often too little data for fine-tuning to be robust, and that\ndata is usually unlabelled. This paper proposes a combination of approaches to\nmake adaptation to a single minute of data robust. First, instead of estimating\nthe adaptation parameters with cross-entropy on a single error-prone hypothesis\nor \"pseudo-label\", this paper proposes a novel loss function, the conditional\nentropy over complete hypotheses. Using multiple hypotheses makes adaptation\nmore robust to errors in the initial recognition. Second, a \"speaker code\"\ncharacterises a speaker in a vector short enough that it requires little data\nto estimate. On a far-field noise-augmented version of Common Voice, the\nproposed scheme yields a 20% relative improvement in word error rate on one\nminute of adaptation data, increasing on 10 minutes to 29%.",

On the Sun, granular-scale vortex flows couple strongly with magnetic\nfields, channeling energy into the corona. At high Reynolds numbers, vorticity\nand magnetic fields are nearly frozen into the charged fluid, and MHD flows\nemerge from the Lorentz force mediated interactions between coherent vortex\nstructures in matter and the field. To probe this competition in a controlled\nsetting, we revisit the canonical problem of two antiparallel flux tubes. By\nvarying the magnetic flux threading each tube--and thus sweeping the\ninteraction parameter $N_i$, which gauges Lorentz-to-inertial force balance--we\nuncover three distinct regimes: vortex-dominated joint reconnection,\ninstability-triggered cascade, and Lorentz-induced vortex disruption. At low\n$N_i$, classical vortex dynamics dominate, driving joint vortex-magnetic\nreconnection and amplifying magnetic energy via a dynamo effect. At moderate\n$N_i$, the system oscillates between vorticity-driven attraction and magnetic\ndamping, triggering instabilities and nonlinear interactions that spawn\nsecondary filaments and drive an energy cascade. At high $N_i$, Lorentz forces\nsuppress vortex interactions, aligning the tubes axially while disrupting\nvortex cores and rapidly converting magnetic to kinetic energy. These findings\nreveal how the inertial-Lorentz balance governs energy transfer and coherent\nstructure formation in MHD turbulence, offering insight into vortex-magnetic\ncoevolution in astrophysical plasmas.",

However, empowered by CoT, transformers are proven to be\nable to solve some difficult problems effectively, such as the $k$-parity\nproblem. Nevertheless, those works rely on two imperative assumptions: (1)\nidentical training and testing distribution, and (2) corruption-free training\ndata with correct reasoning steps. However, in the real world, these\nassumptions do not always hold. Although the risks of data shifts have caught\nattention, our work is the first to rigorously study the exact harm caused by\nsuch shifts to the best of our knowledge. Focusing on the $k$-parity problem,\nin this work we investigate the joint impact of two types of data shifts: the\ndistribution shifts and data poisoning, on the quality of trained models\nobtained by a well-established CoT decomposition. In addition to revealing a\nsurprising phenomenon that CoT leads to worse performance on learning parity\nthan directly generating the prediction, our technical results also give a\nrigorous and comprehensive explanation of the mechanistic reasons of such\nimpact.",

We first\ninvestigate what fraction of threat groups have group-specific behaviors, i.e.,\nbehaviors used exclusively by a single group.

    "abstract": "Studies of micro-level price datasets find more frequent small price\nincreases than decreases, which can be explained by consumer inattention\nbecause time-constrained shoppers might ignore small price changes. Recent\nempirical studies of the link between shopping behavior and price attention\nover the business cycle find that consumers are more attentive to prices during\neconomic downturns, and less attentive during economic booms. These two sets of\nfindings have a testable implication. The asymmetry in small price changes\nshould vary over the business cycle. It should diminish during recessions and\nstrengthen during expansions. We test this prediction using a large US\nstore-level dataset with more than 98 million weekly price observations for the\nyears 1989-1997, which includes an 8-month recession period, as defined by the\nNBER. We compare price adjustments between periods of recession - high\nunemployment, and expansion - low unemployment.

In this work, we propose GigaVideo-1, an efficient fine-tuning\nframework that advances video generation without additional human supervision.\nRather than injecting large volumes of high-quality data from external sources,\nGigaVideo-1 unlocks the latent potential of pre-trained video diffusion models\nthrough automatic feedback.

To improve fine-tuning data, we\ndesign a prompt-driven data engine that constructs diverse, weakness-oriented\ntraining samples. On the optimization side, we introduce a reward-guided\ntraining strategy, which adaptively weights samples using feedback from\npre-trained vision-language models with a realism constraint. We evaluate\nGigaVideo-1 on the VBench-2.0 benchmark using Wan2.1 as the baseline across 17\nevaluation dimensions. Experiments show that GigaVideo-1 consistently improves\nperformance on almost all the dimensions with an average gain of about 4% using\nonly 4 GPU-hours.

Despite their effectiveness, most\nexisting methods still adhere to a fast thinking paradigm-relying on extracting\nhistorical patterns and mapping them to future values as their core modeling\nphilosophy, lacking an explicit thinking process that incorporates intermediate\ntime series reasoning. Meanwhile, emerging slow-thinking LLMs (e.g., OpenAI-o1)\nhave shown remarkable multi-step reasoning capabilities, offering an\nalternative way to overcome these issues. However, prompt engineering alone\npresents several limitations - including high computational cost, privacy\nrisks, and limited capacity for in-depth domain-specific time series reasoning.\nTo address these limitations, a more promising approach is to train LLMs to\ndevelop slow thinking capabilities and acquire strong time series reasoning\nskills. For this purpose, we propose Time-R1, a two-stage reinforcement\nfine-tuning framework designed to enhance multi-step reasoning ability of LLMs\nfor time series forecasting. Specifically, the first stage conducts supervised\nfine-tuning for warmup adaptation, while the second stage employs reinforcement\nlearning to improve the model's generalization ability.

However, the availability of hardware often\nlags behind, hindering early-stage software development. To address this,\nVirtual Platforms (VPs) based on the SystemC TLM-2.0 standard have emerged as a\npivotal solution, enabling pre-silicon execution and testing of unmodified\ntarget software. In this study, we propose an approach leveraging\ncontainerization to encapsulate VPs in order to reduce environment dependencies\nand enable cloud deployment for fast, parallelized test execution, as well as\nopen-source VP technologies such as QEMU and VCML to obviate the need for seat\nlicenses. To demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, we present an Artificial\nIntelligence (AI) accelerator VP case study.

While intrusion detection systems (IDSs) have\nbeen developed to counter such threats, they are not foolproof.

This paper extends our previous work by investigating the\nfeasibility and impact of gradient-based adversarial attacks performed with\ndifferent degrees of knowledge against automotive IDSs.

We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed\nattacks against state-of-the-art IDSs on two publicly available datasets.\nAdditionally, we study effect of the adversarial perturbation on the attack\nimpact and evaluate real-time feasibility by precomputing evasive payloads for\ntimed injection based on bus traffic.

    "abstract": "In this work, we explore a conversion-driven freeze-out scenario, where the\nnext-to-lightest stable particle (NLSP) sets the dark matter (DM) abundance\nthrough the process ``NLSP SM $\\leftrightarrow$ DM SM\". Although DM is produced\nvia a freeze-out mechanism, its interaction strength with the visible sector\ncan range from weak to feeble couplings. This results in a vast, largely\nunexplored parameter space that evades current direct, indirect, and collider\nbounds, while remaining testable in the near future. We study this mechanism in\nthe context of an alternative $U(1)_{B-L}$ model, where four chiral fermions\nare required to cancel gauge anomalies, unlike the usual case with three\nright-handed neutrinos. The observed relic abundance is successfully reproduced\nwithin this framework. The viable parameter space can be probed by future\ndirect detection experiments, while remaining inaccessible to indirect\nsearches. Our results show that the DM relic density is highly sensitive to the\nNLSP-SM interaction strength and the mass difference between the NLSP and DM,\nbut not to the DM-SM direct interaction. For certain parameter choices, the\nNLSP decays to DM via two or three body processes involving an extra gauge\nboson and SM particles, leading to long-lived decays outside the CMS or ATLAS\ndetectors at the LHC. In contrast, if the decay proceeds via a CP-odd Higgs, it\noccurs promptly within the detector. We investigate prospects for detecting\nsuch long-lived NLSPs at the proposed MATHUSLA detector, with similar\nexpectations for the ongoing FASER experiment. Finally, we find that choosing\narbitrarily small values of the gauge coupling or BSM fermionic mixing angle\ncan violate successful BBN predictions.",

We propose a two-stage\npipeline designed to overcome this limitation. The first stage employs a U-Net\nbased segmentation network, trained on a dataset enriched with overlapping\nsignals and fortified with custom data augmentations, to accurately isolate the\nprimary ECG trace. The subsequent stage converts this refined binary mask into\na time-series signal using established digitization techniques, enhanced by an\nadaptive grid detection module for improved versatility across different ECG\nformats and scales. Our experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our\napproach. The U-Net architecture achieves an IoU of 0.87 for the fine-grained\nsegmentation task. Crucially, our proposed digitization method yields superior\nperformance compared to a well-established baseline technique across both\nnon-overlapping and challenging overlapping ECG samples. For non-overlapping\nsignals, our method achieved a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.0010 and a Pearson\nCorrelation Coefficient (rho) of 0.9644, compared to 0.0015 and 0.9366,\nrespectively, for the baseline. On samples with signal overlap, our method\nachieved an MSE of 0.0029 and a rho of 0.9641, significantly improving upon the\nbaseline's 0.0178 and 0.8676. This work demonstrates an effective strategy to\nsignificantly enhance digitization accuracy, especially in the presence of\nsignal overlaps, thereby laying a strong foundation for the reliable conversion\nof analog ECG records into analyzable digital data for contemporary research\nand clinical applications.

    "abstract": "We present TexTailor, a novel method for generating consistent object\ntextures from textual descriptions. Existing text-to-texture synthesis\napproaches utilize depth-aware diffusion models to progressively generate\nimages and synthesize textures across predefined multiple viewpoints. However,\nthese approaches lead to a gradual shift in texture properties across\nviewpoints due to (1) insufficient integration of previously synthesized\ntextures at each viewpoint during the diffusion process and (2) the\nautoregressive nature of the texture synthesis process. Moreover, the\npredefined selection of camera positions, which does not account for the\nobject's geometry, limits the effective use of texture information synthesized\nfrom different viewpoints, ultimately degrading overall texture consistency. In\nTexTailor, we address these issues by (1) applying a resampling scheme that\nrepeatedly integrates information from previously synthesized textures within\nthe diffusion process, and (2) fine-tuning a depth-aware diffusion model on\nthese resampled textures. During this process, we observed that using only a\nfew training images restricts the model's original ability to generate\nhigh-fidelity images aligned with the conditioning, and therefore propose an\nperformance preservation loss to mitigate this issue. Additionally, we improve\nthe synthesis of view-consistent textures by adaptively adjusting camera\npositions based on the object's geometry. Experiments on a subset of the\nObjaverse dataset and the ShapeNet car dataset demonstrate that TexTailor\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods in synthesizing view-consistent textures.\nThe source code for TexTailor is available at\nhttps://github.com/Adios42/Textailor",

We apply this characterization to several\nclasses of shifts that are minimal with respect to specific properties. This\nprovides a unifying approach that not only generalizes many existing results\nbut also has the potential to yield new findings effortlessly. In contrast to\nthe case of sets, we prove that strong computable type for G-shifts is\npreserved under products. We conclude by discussing some generalizations and\nfuture directions.",

Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate the superiority of our method across seven public\ndatasets and the MQTR dataset.

    "abstract": "Federated learning has emerged as a privacy-preserving technique for\ncollaborative model training across heterogeneously distributed silos. Yet, its\nreliance on a single central server introduces potential bottlenecks and risks\nof single-point failure. Decentralizing the server, often referred to as\ndecentralized learning, addresses this problem by distributing the server role\nacross nodes within the network. One drawback regarding this pure\ndecentralization is it introduces communication inefficiencies, which arise\nfrom increased message exchanges in large-scale setups. However, existing\nproposed solutions often fail to simulate the real-world distributed and\ndecentralized environment in their experiments, leading to unreliable\nperformance evaluations and limited applicability in practice. Recognizing the\nlack from prior works, this work investigates the correlation between model\nsize and network latency, a critical factor in optimizing decentralized\nlearning communication. We propose a graph-based gossiping mechanism, where\nspecifically, minimum spanning tree and graph coloring are used to optimize\nnetwork structure and scheduling for efficient communication across various\nnetwork topologies and message capacities. Our approach configures and manages\nsubnetworks on real physical routers and devices and closely models real-world\ndistributed setups. Experimental results demonstrate that our method\nsignificantly improves communication, compatible with different topologies and\ndata sizes, reducing bandwidth and transfer time by up to circa 8 and 4.4\ntimes, respectively, compared to naive flooding broadcasting methods.",

While deep learning has emerged as an efficient data-driven\nalternative, most existing studies have focused on single-variable models that\ndownscale one variable at a time. This approach can lead to limited contextual\nawareness, redundant computation, and lack of cross-variable interaction. Our\nstudy addresses these limitations by proposing a multi-task, multi-variable\nVision Transformer (ViT) architecture with a shared encoder and\nvariable-specific decoders (1EMD). The proposed architecture jointly predicts\nthree key climate variables: surface temperature (tas), wind speed (sfcWind),\nand 500 hPa geopotential height (zg500), directly from GCM-resolution inputs,\nemulating RCM-scale downscaling over Europe. We show that our multi-variable\napproach achieves positive cross-variable knowledge transfer and consistently\noutperforms single-variable baselines trained under identical conditions, while\nalso improving computational efficiency.

    "abstract": "Achieving robust robot learning for humanoid locomotion is a fundamental\nchallenge in model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL), where environmental\nstochasticity and randomness can hinder efficient exploration and learning\nstability. The environmental, so-called aleatoric, uncertainty can be amplified\nin high-dimensional action spaces with complex contact dynamics, and further\nentangled with epistemic uncertainty in the models during learning phases. In\nthis work, we propose DoublyAware, an uncertainty-aware extension of Temporal\nDifference Model Predictive Control (TD-MPC) that explicitly decomposes\nuncertainty into two disjoint interpretable components, i.e., planning and\npolicy uncertainties. To handle the planning uncertainty, DoublyAware employs\nconformal prediction to filter candidate trajectories using quantile-calibrated\nrisk bounds, ensuring statistical consistency and robustness against stochastic\ndynamics. Meanwhile, policy rollouts are leveraged as structured informative\npriors to support the learning phase with Group-Relative Policy Constraint\n(GRPC) optimizers that impose a group-based adaptive trust-region in the latent\naction space. This principled combination enables the robot agent to prioritize\nhigh-confidence, high-reward behavior while maintaining effective, targeted\nexploration under uncertainty. Evaluated on the HumanoidBench locomotion suite\nwith the Unitree 26-DoF H1-2 humanoid, DoublyAware demonstrates improved sample\nefficiency, accelerated convergence, and enhanced motion feasibility compared\nto RL baselines. Our simulation results emphasize the significance of\nstructured uncertainty modeling for data-efficient and reliable decision-making\nin TD-MPC-based humanoid locomotion learning.",

In this paper, we\npropose a novel hierarchical error assessment framework for aircraft CAD models\nwithin a manufacturing-and-measurement platform, termed HEA-MM. HEA-MM employs\nstructured light scanners to obtain comprehensive 3D measurements of\nmanufactured workpieces. The measured point cloud is registered with the\nreference CAD model, followed by an error analysis conducted at three\nhierarchical levels: global, part, and feature. At the global level, the error\nanalysis evaluates the overall deviation of the scanned point cloud from the\nreference CAD model. At the part level, error analysis is performed on these\npatches underlying the point clouds. We propose a novel optimization-based\nprimitive refinement method to obtain a set of meaningful patches of point\nclouds. Two basic operations, splitting and merging, are introduced to refine\nthe coarse primitives. At the feature level, error analysis is performed on\ncircular holes, which are commonly found in CAD models. To facilitate it, a\ntwo-stage algorithm is introduced for the detection of circular holes. First,\nedge points are identified using a tensor-voting algorithm. Then, multiple\ncircles are fitted through a hypothesize-and-clusterize framework, ensuring\naccurate detection and analysis of the circular features.

In this work, we consider\nunconventional magnets with $d$- and $p$-wave parities, and investigate the\neffect of time-periodic light drives for inducing the formation of spin-triplet\nphases in the normal and superconducting states. In particular, we consider\nunconventional magnets without and with conventional superconductivity under\nlinearly and circularly polarized light drives and treat the time-dependent\nproblem within Floquet formalism, which naturally unveils photon processes and\nFloquet bands determining the emergent phenomena. We demonstrate that the\ninterplay between unconventional magnetism and light gives rise to a\nnon-trivial light-matter coupling which governs the emergence of Floquet\nspin-triplet states with and without superconductivity that are absent\notherwise. We find that photon-assisted processes promote the formation of\nspin-triplet densities and spin-triplet Cooper pairs between different Floquet\nsidebands. More precisely, the Floquet sidebands offer an additional quantum\nnumber, the Floquet index, which considerably broadens the classification of\nsuperconducting correlations that lead to Floquet spin-triplet Cooper pairs as\nan entirely dynamical phenomenon due to the interplay between light and\nunconventional magnetism. Furthermore, we discuss how the number of photons is\nconnected to the symmetry of Cooper pairs and also explore how the distinct\nlight drives can be used to manipulate them and probe the angular symmetry of\nunconventional magnets.

The problem intensifies in intersectional\nanalyses, where multiple sensitive attributes are considered jointly, giving\nrise to a larger number of smaller groups. As these groups become more\ngranular, the data representing them becomes too sparse for reliable\nestimation, and fairness metrics yield excessively wide confidence intervals,\nprecluding meaningful conclusions about potential unfair treatments.\n  In this paper, we introduce a unified, size-adaptive, hypothesis-testing\nframework that turns fairness assessment into an evidence-based statistical\ndecision.

In other\nwords, numbers which are primes or have at least one prime suffix. The\nresulting sequence exhibits a deterministic yet non-trivial structure, blending\nnumber-theoretic properties with symbolic patterning. We propose the Primender\nsequence as a benchmark for evaluating the symbolic reasoning capabilities of\nLarge Language Models (LLMs). The study is motivated by the need for\ninterpretable, rule-based testbeds that can assess an LLM's ability to infer\nhidden rules, validate mathematical hypotheses, and generalize symbolic logic\nat scale.

Specifically, we achieve\nreal-time estimation of RG'G and RBS under two relaxed assumptions: i) the\nmatrices change negligibly in a short time window; ii) the human movements/IMU\nreadings are diverse in such a time window. Intuitively, the first assumption\nreduces the number of candidate matrices, and the second assumption provides\ndiverse constraints, which greatly reduces the solution space and allows for\naccurate estimation of RG'G and RBS from a short history of IMU readings in\nreal time. To achieve this, we created synthetic datasets of paired RG'G, RBS\nmatrices and IMU readings, and learned their mappings using a Transformer-based\nmodel. We also designed a calibration trigger based on the diversity of IMU\nreadings to ensure that assumption ii) is met before applying our method.

Standard diffusion models rely on isotropic Gaussian noise\nin the forward process, inherently favoring Euclidean spaces.

When modeled in Euclidean space, these angular subtleties\nare lost, leading to suboptimal generative performance.

While CLIP is capable of making image\nfeatures to be similar to the corresponding text features, the modality gap\nremains a nontrivial issue and limits image recognition performance of TaI.\nUsing multi-label image recognition (MLR) as an example, we present a novel\nmethod, called T2I-PAL to tackle the modality gap issue when using only text\ncaptions for PEFT. The core design of T2I-PAL is to leverage pre-trained\ntext-to-image generation models to generate photo-realistic and diverse images\nfrom text captions, thereby reducing the modality gap.

Its\nperformance arises from a hierarchical structure, where the dominant\nload-bearing component is the S2 layer of tracheid cell walls-a thick,\nfiber-reinforced composite of cellulose microfibrils embedded in hemicelluloses\nand lignin. Due to the small dimensions and anisotropic nature of the S2 layer,\nmechanical testing presents significant challenges, particularly in producing\nhomogeneous stress and strain fields. In this study, we apply micropillar\ncompression (MPC) combined with digital image correlation (DIC) to Norway\nspruce tracheids, enabling direct and model-free strain measurements at the\ncell wall scale. Micropillars were oriented at different microfibril angles\n(MFAs), confirming the expected dependence of stiffness and yield stress on\nultrastructural alignment, with higher stiffness and yield stress at low MFAs.\nFor these under compression fibril-aligned kink bands occurred, while shear\nrelated failure was observed at higher angles.

Despite recent progress, significant challenges remain due to\nthe semantic gap between music and dance motion, as music offers only abstract\ncues, such as melody, groove, and emotion, without explicitly specifying the\nphysical movements. Moreover, a single piece of music can produce multiple\nplausible dance interpretations. This one-to-many mapping demands additional\nguidance, as music alone provides limited information for generating diverse\ndance movements.

Our approach consists of\nthree components: (1) an LLM-based pseudo instruction generation module that\nproduces textual dance guidance based on music style and structure, (2) a\nmulti-modal feature extraction and fusion module that integrates music, rhythm,\nand textual guidance into a shared representation, and (3) a diffusion-based\nmotion synthesis module together with a multi-modal alignment loss, which\nensures that the generated dance is aligned with both musical and textual cues.\nExtensive experiments on AIST++ and human evaluations show that DanceChat\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.",

While high-fidelity nonlinear time\nhistory analysis provides the most comprehensive and accurate representation of\nthe responses, it becomes computationally prohibitive for complex structural\nsystem models and repeated simulations under varying ground motions. To address\nthis challenge, we propose a composite learning framework that integrates\nsimplified physics-based models with a Fourier neural operator to enable\nefficient and accurate trajectory-level seismic response prediction. In the\nproposed architecture, a simplified physics-based model, obtained from\ntechniques such as linearization, modal reduction, or solver relaxation, serves\nas a preprocessing operator to generate structural response trajectories that\ncapture coarse dynamic characteristics. A neural operator is then trained to\ncorrect the discrepancy between these initial approximations and the true\nnonlinear responses, allowing the composite model to capture hysteretic and\npath-dependent behaviors. Additionally, a linear regression-based\npostprocessing scheme is introduced to further refine predictions and quantify\nassociated uncertainty with negligible additional computational effort. The\nproposed approach is validated on three representative structural systems\nsubjected to synthetic or recorded ground motions. Results show that the\nproposed approach consistently improves prediction accuracy over baseline\nmodels, particularly in data-scarce regimes.

Due to its\nmathematical beauty and its relevance in aerospace engineering, it has been and\nremains the object of attention of countless engineers, mathematicians (pure\nand applied), and physicists seeking to produce efficient solution algorithms.\nIn this expository article, didactic in nature, we present a unified and\ncomprehensive derivation that assumes only a minimal background in physics and\nmathematics.

    "abstract": "The acquisition of Downlink (DL) channel state information at the transmitter\n(CSIT) is known to be a challenging task in multiuser massive MIMO systems when\nuplink/downlink channel reciprocity does not hold (e.g., in frequency division\nduplexing systems). From a coding viewpoint, the DL channel state acquired at\nthe users via DL training can be seen as an information source that must be\nconveyed to the base station via the UL communication channels. The\ntransmission of a source through a channel can be accomplished either by\nseparate or joint source-channel coding (SSCC or JSCC). In this work, using\nclassical remote distortion-rate (DR) theory, we first provide a theoretical\nlower bound on the channel estimation mean-square-error (MSE) of both JSCC and\nSSCC-based feedback schemes, which however requires encoding of large blocks of\nsuccessive channel states and thus cannot be used in practicesince it would\nincur in an extremely large feedback delay. We then focus on the relevant case\nof minimal (one slot) feedback delay and propose a practical JSCC-based\nfeedback scheme that fully exploits the channel second-order statistics to\noptimize the dimension projection in the eigenspace. We analyze the large SNR\nbehavior of the proposed JSCC-based scheme in terms of the quality scaling\nexponent (QSE). Given the second-order statistics of channel estimation of any\nfeedback scheme, we further derive the closed-form of the lower bound to the\nergodic sum-rate for DL data transmission under maximum ratio transmission and\nzero-forcing precoding. Via extensive numerical results, we show that our\nproposed JSCC-based scheme outperforms known JSCC, SSCC baseline and deep\nlearning-based schemes and is able to approach the performance of the optimal\nDR scheme in the range of practical SNR.",

It allows precise tracking and\ncalorimetry in detectors with very large volume and mass. One important\ncomponent of LArTPC calorimetric energy reconstruction is the electron-ion\nrecombination effect. Existing experiments have provided constraints to its\nempirical description, including an explicit dependence on the particle's angle\nwith respect to the TPC's electric field.\n  In this paper we analyze the impact of angle-dependent recombination models\non the reconstruction of neutrino energy in LArTPCs. We examine in detail the\npredictions of the existing models, showing that there is still considerable\nuncertainty for the angular dependence prediction at the low values of $dE/dx$\ntypical of minimum ionizing particles. We apply a simple correction to overcome\nunphysical predictions in the non-constrained energy loss regions and evaluate\nthe consequences of that in the bias and linearity of electron neutrino energy\nresponses, using generator-level and electron shower simulations for neutrino\nenergies in the range of 0.5-5 GeV. Comparing prediction with and without\nangular-dependence, we observe an average energy bias between -0.9\\% at 0.5 GeV\nand -0.6\\% at 5 GeV.

Milliarcsecond-scale observations at both frequencies reveal\ncompact continuum emission in IRAS F00188$-$0856 and IRAS F01298$-$0744,\naccounting for $\\sim10$% of the flux density measured on arcsecond scales. The\nnon-detection in IRAS F00091$-$0738 and the lower limit on the intrinsic 8.4\nGHz brightness temperature of $10^{6.1}$ K in IRAS F01298$-$0744 yield no\nconclusive evidence of AGN-driven radio emission, whereas the measurement of\n$10^{7.8}$ K in IRAS F00188$-$0856 confirms an AGN origin. Thus, the\nmid-infrared AGN classification remains robust, with at least one object\nexhibiting compact radio emission indicative of AGN activity. We further\ninvestigate the high-frequency spectral steepening observed in all three\ngalaxies. In each case, this steepening arises from spectral aging in diffuse\nkpc-scale emission, which is resolved out by the VLBA observations. One\npossible explanation for the steepening of the sample is merger-induced\nparticle acceleration. IRAS F00188$-$0856 exhibits a peaked radio spectrum,\ncharacteristic of a young radio source, with the high-frequency steepening\nattributable to this AGN activity.

Finite-field methods are one of most reliable\napproaches for modeling electrochemical interfaces in complete cells under\nrealistic constant-potential conditions. However, previous finite-field studies\nhave been limited to either expensive ab initio molecular dynamics or less\naccurate classical descriptions of electrodes and electrolytes. To overcome\nthese limitations, we present a machine learning-based finite-field approach\nthat combines two neural network models: one predicts atomic forces under\napplied electric fields, while the other describes the corresponding charge\nresponse. Both models are trained entirely on first-principles data without\nemploying any classical approximations. As a proof-of-concept demonstration in\na prototypical Au(100)/NaCl(aq) system, this approach not only dramatically\naccelerates fully first-principles finite-field simulations but also\nsuccessfully extrapolates to cell potentials beyond the training range while\naccurately predicting key electrochemical properties. Interestingly, we reveal\na turnover of both density and orientation distributions of interfacial water\nmolecules at the anode, arising from competing interactions between the\npositively charged anode and adsorbed Cl$^-$ ions with water molecules as the\napplied potential increases.

    "abstract": "Rydberg atoms, with their giant electric dipole moments and tunable\nenergy-level transitions, offer exceptional potential for microwave (MW)\nelectric field sensing, combining high sensitivity and broad frequency\ncoverage. However, simultaneously achieving high sensitivity and wide\ninstantaneous bandwidth in a Rydberg-based MW transducer remains a critical\nchallenge. Here, we propose a multi-dress-state engineered superheterodyne\ndetection scheme for Rydberg electrometry that exploits a detuning-dependent\ndual-peak response structure and a Rabi-frequency-driven dip-lifting effect to\novercome the limitation on instantaneous bandwidth. By strategically\nengineering the multiple dress states of Rydberg atoms, we demonstrate a\nthermal $\\mathrm{^{87}Rb}$ vapor-based transducer with a record sensitivity of\n$\\mathrm{140.4\\,nV\\,cm^{-1}\\,Hz^{-1/2}}$ and an instantaneous bandwidth of up\nto 54.6$\\,$MHz. The performance metrics are now approaching the practical\nrequirements of modern MW receivers (100-MHz-level) in certain application\nfields. This advancement bridges the gap between atomic sensing and real-world\napplications, paving the way for Rydberg-atom technologies in radar,wireless\ncommunication, and spectrum monitoring.",

    "abstract": "Despite rapid advancements in video generation models, generating coherent\nstorytelling videos that span multiple scenes and characters remains\nchallenging. Current methods often rigidly convert pre-generated keyframes into\nfixed-length clips, resulting in disjointed narratives and pacing issues.\nFurthermore, the inherent instability of video generation models means that\neven a single low-quality clip can significantly degrade the entire output\nanimation's logical coherence and visual continuity. To overcome these\nobstacles, we introduce AniMaker, a multi-agent framework enabling efficient\nmulti-candidate clip generation and storytelling-aware clip selection, thus\ncreating globally consistent and story-coherent animation solely from text\ninput. The framework is structured around specialized agents, including the\nDirector Agent for storyboard generation, the Photography Agent for video clip\ngeneration, the Reviewer Agent for evaluation, and the Post-Production Agent\nfor editing and voiceover. Central to AniMaker's approach are two key technical\ncomponents: MCTS-Gen in Photography Agent, an efficient Monte Carlo Tree Search\n(MCTS)-inspired strategy that intelligently navigates the candidate space to\ngenerate high-potential clips while optimizing resource usage; and AniEval in\nReviewer Agent, the first framework specifically designed for multi-shot\nanimation evaluation, which assesses critical aspects such as story-level\nconsistency, action completion, and animation-specific features by considering\neach clip in the context of its preceding and succeeding clips. Experiments\ndemonstrate that AniMaker achieves superior quality as measured by popular\nmetrics including VBench and our proposed AniEval framework, while\nsignificantly improving the efficiency of multi-candidate generation, pushing\nAI-generated storytelling animation closer to production standards.",

Happiness\nimplies a flourishing life - one of virtue, purpose, and contribution to the\ncommon good. This paper studies populations of individuals - that we call\nhomo-felix - who maximise an objective function that we call happiness. The\nhappiness of one individual depends on the payoffs that they receive in games\nthey play with their peers as well as on the happiness of the peers they\ninteract with. Individuals care more or less about others depending on whether\nthat makes them more or less happy. This paper analyses the happiness feedback\nloops that result from these interactions in simple settings. We find that\nindividuals tend to care more about individuals who are happier than what they\nwould be by being selfish. In simple 2 x 2 game theoretic settings, we show\nthat homo-felix can converge to a variety of equilibria which includes but goes\nbeyond Nash equilibria. In an n-persons public good game we show that the\nnon-cooperative Nash equilibrium is marginally unstable and a single individual\nwho develops prosocial behaviour is able to drive almost the whole population\nto a cooperative state.",

It is well known that the standard\napproach to calculate this \"indistinguishability SNR\" is too conservative: a\nmodel may fail the criterion at a given SNR, but not necessarily incur a biased\nmeasurement of any individual parameters. This problem can be solved by taking\ninto account errors orthogonal to the model space (which therefore do not\ninduce a bias), and calculating indistinguishability SNRs for individual\nparameters, rather than the full $N$-dimensional parameter space. We illustrate\nthis approach with the simple example of aligned-spin binary-black-hole\nsignals, and calculate accurate estimates of the SNR at which each parameter\nmeasurement will be biased. In general biases occur at much higher SNRs than\npredicted from the standard mismatch calculation. Which parameters are most\neasily biased depends sensitively on the details of a given waveform model, and\nthe location in parameter space, and in some cases the bias SNR is as high as\nthe conservative estimate. We also illustrate how the parameter bias SNR can be\nused to robustly specify waveform accuracy requirements for future detectors.",

The estimator operates on\ngridded visibilities and leverages the FFT-based acceleration to efficiently\ncompute the MABS and the 3D BS covering all possible triangle configurations.\nWe present the formalism and validate the estimator using simulated visibility\ndata for a known input model BS, considering the Murchison Widefield Array\n(MWA) observations with a bandwidth of $30.72$ MHz centered at $154.25$ MHz. We\nconsider two cases, namely, without flagging, and with flagging, which has\nexactly the same frequency channels flagged as the actual data. We obtain\nestimates of the BS for a wide range of triangle shapes covering the scales\n$0.003 ~\\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}\\leq k_1 \\leq 1.258 ~\\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$. The estimated\nBS shows excellent agreement with analytical predictions based on the input\nmodel BS. We find that the deviations, which are below 20\\% even in the\npresence of flagging, are mostly consistent with the expected statistical\nfluctuations.

    "abstract": "While Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced code\ngeneration efficiency, they face inherent challenges in balancing performance\nand inference costs across diverse programming tasks. Dynamically selecting the\noptimal LLM based on task difficulty and resource constraints offers a\npromising approach to achieve an optimal balance between efficiency and\nperformance. However, existing model selection methods are resource-intensive\nand often neglect cost efficiency. Moreover, these approaches rely on\nhuman-annotated difficulty labels that are frequently inaccessible in\nreal-world settings and may not align with the LLM's own assessment of task\ndifficulty. In this paper, we introduce AdaptiveLLM, a framework that\ndynamically selects optimal LLMs for a given coding task by automatically\nassessing task difficulty. Our framework first estimates task difficulty using\nChain-of-Thought lengths generated by reasoning model, clusters these into\nthree difficulty levels via k-means, and fine-tunes CodeBERT to embed\ndifficulty-aware features. A trained XGBoost classifier then selects the best\nmodel for each problem, optimizing the performance-cost trade-off. Experimental\nresults show that AdaptiveLLM achieves a 7.86% improvement in pass@1 score\nwhile reducing resource consumption by 88.9% compared to baseline method\nComplexityNet. When compared to a single model, AdaptiveLLM demonstrates an\napproximately 15% accuracy improvement, while maintaining the same level of\ncost consumption. Apart from that, the difficulty assessment using CoT provides\nmore reliable selection criteria than human evaluation.

This ``Keenan--Barger--Cowie (KBC) void'', ``Local\nHole'', or ``local supervoid'', would have significant ramifications for the\nHubble tension by generating outflows that masquerade as an enhanced local\nexpansion rate. We evaluate models for the KBC void capable of resolving the\nHubble tension with a background Planck cosmology. We fit these models to\ndirect distances from the Tully--Fisher catalogue of the CosmicFlows-4\ncompilation using a field-level forward model. Depending on the adopted void\ndensity profile, we find the derived velocity fields to prefer a void size of\nless than 70 Mpc, which is less than 10 per cent of the fiducial size found by\nHaslbauer et al. based on the KBC luminosity density data. The predicted local\nHubble constant is $72.1^{+0.9}_{-0.8}$, $70.4^{+0.4}_{-0.4}$, or\n$70.2^{+0.5}_{-0.4}$ km/s/Mpc for an initial underdensity profile that is\nexponential, Gaussian, or Maxwell-Boltzmann, respectively. The latter two\nameliorate the Hubble tension to within $3\\sigma$ of the 4-anchor distance\nladder approach of Breuval et al. giving $73.2 \\pm 0.9$ km/s/Mpc. The\nexponential profile does achieve consistency with this measurement at just over\n$1\\sigma$, but it is disfavoured by the Bayesian evidence.

However, existing UDA studies are based on natural\nimages or clear UAV imagery, and research focused on UAV imagery in adverse\nconditions is still in its infancy. Moreover, due to the unique perspective of\nUAVs and the interference from adverse conditions, these methods often fail to\naccurately align features and are influenced by limited or noisy pseudo-labels.\nTo address this, we propose the first benchmark for UAV object detection in\nadverse scenes, the Statistical Feedback-Driven Threshold and Mask Adjustment\nTeacher-Student Framework (SF-TMAT). Specifically, SF-TMAT introduces a design\ncalled Dynamic Step Feedback Mask Adjustment Autoencoder (DSFMA), which\ndynamically adjusts the mask ratio and reconstructs feature maps by integrating\ntraining progress and loss feedback. This approach dynamically adjusts the\nlearning focus at different training stages to meet the model's needs for\nlearning features at varying levels of granularity. Additionally, we propose a\nunique Variance Feedback Smoothing Threshold (VFST) strategy, which\nstatistically computes the mean confidence of each class and dynamically\nadjusts the selection threshold by incorporating a variance penalty term. This\nstrategy improves the quality of pseudo-labels and uncovers potentially valid\nlabels, thus mitigating domain bias. Extensive experiments demonstrate the\nsuperiority and generalization capability of the proposed SF-TMAT in UAV object\ndetection under adverse scene conditions.

    "abstract": "Ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC) demand decoding algorithms\nthat simultaneously offer high reliability and low complexity under stringent\nlatency constraints. While iterative decoding schemes for LDPC and Polar codes\noffer a good compromise between performance and complexity, they fall short in\napproaching the theoretical performance limits in the typical URLLC short block\nlength regime. Conversely, quasi-ML decoding schemes for algebraic codes, like\nChase-II decoding, exhibit a smaller gap to optimum decoding but are\ncomputationally prohibitive for practical deployment in URLLC systems. To\nbridge this gap, we propose an enhanced Chase-II decoding algorithm that\nleverages a neural network (NN) to predict promising perturbation patterns,\ndrastically reducing the number of required decoding trials. The proposed\napproach combines the reliability of quasi-ML decoding with the efficiency of\nNN inference, making it well-suited for time-sensitive and resource-constrained\napplications.",

In this study, we\ninvestigate the outermost regions of the Milky Way disc using two previously\nunstudied open clusters -Auner 1 and Berkeley 102- located at Galactocentric\ndistances of approximately 14 kpc in largely uncharted areas of the Galaxy. We\nobtained medium-resolution spectra (R > 18,700) using the MEGARA integral-field\nunit (IFU) spectrograph on the 10.4 m Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC), targeting\nred giant member stars in both clusters. From these spectra, we derived radial\nvelocities, stellar atmospheric parameters, and chemical abundances for six\nelements: Fe, Ca, Co, Ni, Ba, and Eu. Additionally, we provide updated\nestimates of the clusters' ages and distances. Both clusters are old (3.2 +-\n0.7 Ga), distant (d ~ 8 kpc), and lie below the Galactic plane (Z Gal ~ -0.7\nkpc), with moderate extinction (AV ~ 1.3 mag). We find that Auner 1 has a\nmetallicity of [Fe/H] = -0.30 +- 0.09 and Berkeley 102 of [Fe/H] = -0.35 +-\n0.06, consistent with other clusters at similar Galactocentric radii and\nindicating minimal azimuthal variation in metallicity. The [X/Fe] abundance\nratios align with expected trends, although [Ca/Fe] is slightly higher in both\nclusters, and [Eu/Fe] is notably enhanced in Berkeley 102 ([Eu/Fe] = 0.64 +-\n0.05).

ENDA was expanded from an initial 16 detectors to 64\ndetectors in April 2023, so called ENDA-64, and has been running alongside\nLHAASO. The stability and consistency of neutron detection are crucial for\nlaying a solid foundation for subsequent data analysis and physical results.\nMethods:We obtain the stability by studying variations of event rate and\nthermal neutron rate in each cluster and the consistency by comparing\ndistribution of number of thermal neutrons between clusters. Additionally, we\ninvestigate the specific influences of the rainy and dry seasons, as well as\nthe presence or absence of sand cubes under the detectors, to examine the\nenvironmental factors affecting neutron measurement performance. Results:The\ncalibration results indicate good consistency in thermal neutron detection\nacross the clusters, with the maximum inconsistency of 6.85%. The maximum\ninstability of event rate and thermal neutron rate over time are 4.68% and\n11.0% respectively. The maximum inconsistency between the clusters without the\nsand cubes is 18%.

First, we introduce BIOPARS-BENCH, a dataset\nfrom over 10,000 scientific articles, textbooks, and medical websites.\nBioParsQA was also introduced to evaluate the proposed model, which consists of\n5,231 Persian medical questions and answers.

To address\nthese limitations, integrating knowledge graphs (KGs) with LLMs has been\nintensively studied. Existing KG-enhanced LLMs focus on supplementary factual\nknowledge, but still struggle with solving complex questions. We argue that\nrefining the relationships among facts and organizing them into a logically\nconsistent reasoning path is equally important as factual knowledge itself.\nDespite their potential, extracting reliable reasoning paths from KGs poses the\nfollowing challenges: the complexity of graph structures and the existence of\nmultiple generated paths, making it difficult to distinguish between useful and\nredundant ones. To tackle these challenges, we propose the RRP framework to\nmine the knowledge graph, which combines the semantic strengths of LLMs with\nstructural information obtained through relation embedding and bidirectional\ndistribution learning. Additionally, we introduce a rethinking module that\nevaluates and refines reasoning paths according to their significance.\nExperimental results on two public datasets show that RRP achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance compared to existing baseline methods. Moreover,\nRRP can be easily integrated into various LLMs to enhance their reasoning\nabilities in a plug-and-play manner.

Our evaluation shows that this approach leads to a dramatic reduction\nin the AUC of Tree-Ring detector's ROC and PR curves, decreasing from 0.993 to\n0.153 and from 0.994 to 0.385, respectively, while maintaining high image\nquality. Notably, our attacks outperform existing methods that assume full\naccess to the diffusion model. These findings highlight the risk of reusing\npublic autoencoders to train diffusion models -- a threat not considered by\ncurrent industry practices. Furthermore, the results suggest that the Tree-Ring\ndetector's precision, a metric that has been overlooked by previous\nevaluations, falls short of the requirements for real-world deployment.",

Evaluated across\nfive OpenTitan IP blocks, BugGen produced 500 unique bugs with 94% functional\naccuracy and achieved a throughput of 17.7 validated bugs per hour-over five\ntimes faster than typical manual expert insertion. Additionally, BugGen\nidentified 104 previously undetected bugs in OpenTitan regressions,\nhighlighting its utility in exposing verification coverage gaps. Compared\nagainst Certitude, BugGen demonstrated over twice the syntactic accuracy,\ndeeper exposure of testbench blind spots, and more functionally meaningful and\ncomplex bug scenarios. Furthermore, when these BugGen-generated datasets were\nemployed to train ML-based failure triage models, we achieved high\nclassification accuracy (88.1%-93.2%) across different IP blocks, confirming\nthe practical utility and realism of generated bugs.

Consequently, they can be very valuable\nin the design of effective interventions to improve community well-being. But\nany exogenous intervention in networked groups, including ones that just\ninvolve the provision of information, can also possibly modify the underlying\nnetwork structure itself, and some interventions are indeed designed to do so.\nWhile social networks obey certain fundamental principles (captured by\nnetwork-level statistics, such as the degree distribution or transitivity\nlevel), they can nevertheless undergo change across time, as people form and\nbreak ties with each other within an overall population. Here, using a\nrandomized controlled trial in 110 remote Honduran villages involving 8,331\npeople, we evaluated the effects of a 22-month public health intervention on\npre-existing social network structures. We leverage a two-stage randomized\ndesign, where a varying fraction of households received the intervention in\neach village. In low-dosage villages (5%, 10%, 20%, and 30%) compared to\nuntreated villages (0%), over a two-year period, individuals who received the\nintervention tended to sever both inbound and outbound ties with untreated\nindividuals whom they previously trusted for health advice. Conversely, in\nhigh-dosage villages (50%, 75%, and 100%), treated individuals increased both\ntheir inbound and outbound ties. Furthermore, although the intervention was\nhealth-focused, it also reshaped broader friendship and financial ties. In\naggregate, the imposition of a novel health information regime in rural\nvillages (as a kind of social institution) led to a significant rewiring in\nindividuals particular connections, but it still had a limited effect on the\noverall global structure of the village-wide social networks.",

The discharge experiences distinct density\njumps from E mode to H mode, W mode, and blue-core mode, when RF input power\nincreases. This is similar to previous observations using other typical helicon\nantennas; however, this special antenna could drive modes of even higher levels\nfor which the blue-core plasma column is actually hollow in radius, i.e.\npeaking off-axis, which was not presented before. The column shows\ncounterclockwise rotation for blue-core mode and clockwise rotation for\nnon-blue-core mode. The reason could be attributed to the radial electric field\ndifferenceses for both modes which reverses the rotation direction via ExB\ndrive. Moreover, the centrifugal instability of blue-core helicon plasma is\ncomputed using a two-fluid flowing plasma model. It shows that the instability\nis strong for small axial wave number but becomes weak for large axial wave\nnumber. Perturbed density peaks at radius of 0.045 m, while the equilibrium\ndensity gradient peaks at radius of 0.055 m. The coincidence of their radial\nlocations suggests that it is a resistive drift mode driven by density\ngradient. The blue-core mode weakens once the magnetic field or flow rate\nexceeds the threshold value. Increasing power further leads to a smoother\nplasma density gradient. The electron temperature profiles decrease with\nincreased power, and the radial gradient of the electron temperature inside the\ncore is smaller as the magnetic field changes. To our best knowledge, it is the\nfirst detailed characterization of blue-core helicon plasma driven by planar\nantenna, especially in terms of azimuthal rotation and centrifugal instability.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we introduce the Sheet Music Benchmark (SMB), a dataset of six\nhundred and eighty-five pages specifically designed to benchmark Optical Music\nRecognition (OMR) research. SMB encompasses a diverse array of musical\ntextures, including monophony, pianoform, quartet, and others, all encoded in\nCommon Western Modern Notation using the Humdrum **kern format. Alongside SMB,\nwe introduce the OMR Normalized Edit Distance (OMR-NED), a new metric tailored\nexplicitly for evaluating OMR performance. OMR-NED builds upon the widely-used\nSymbol Error Rate (SER), offering a fine-grained and detailed error analysis\nthat covers individual musical elements such as note heads, beams, pitches,\naccidentals, and other critical notation features. The resulting numeric score\nprovided by OMR-NED facilitates clear comparisons, enabling researchers and\nend-users alike to identify optimal OMR approaches. Our work thus addresses a\nlong-standing gap in OMR evaluation, and we support our contributions with\nbaseline experiments using standardized SMB dataset splits for training and\nassessing state-of-the-art methods.",

    "abstract": "In digital gaming, long-term user lifetime value (LTV) prediction is\nessential for monetization strategy, yet presents major challenges due to\ndelayed payment behavior, sparse early user data, and the presence of\nhigh-value outliers. While existing models typically rely on either short-cycle\nobservations or strong distributional assumptions, such approaches often\nunderestimate long-term value or suffer from poor robustness. To address these\nissues, we propose SHort-cycle auxiliary with Order-preserving REgression\n(SHORE), a novel LTV prediction framework that integrates short-horizon\npredictions (e.g., LTV-15 and LTV-30) as auxiliary tasks to enhance long-cycle\ntargets (e.g., LTV-60). SHORE also introduces a hybrid loss function combining\norder-preserving multi-class classification and a dynamic Huber loss to\nmitigate the influence of zero-inflation and outlier payment behavior.\nExtensive offline and online experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate\nthat SHORE significantly outperforms existing baselines, achieving a 47.91\\%\nrelative reduction in prediction error in online deployment.

Although recent advancements\nin Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential for\nrepository-level repair tasks, current methodologies exhibit two notable\nlimitations: (1) they often address issues in isolation, neglecting to\nincorporate insights from previously resolved issues, and (2) they rely on\nstatic and rigid prompting strategies, which constrain their ability to\ngeneralize across diverse and evolving issue scenarios. Inspired by the dual\nmemory systems of human cognition, where episodic and semantic memories work\nsynergistically to support human reasoning and decision-making, we propose\nExpeRepair, a novel LLM-based approach that continuously learns from historical\nrepair experiences through dual-channel knowledge accumulation. ExpeRepair\norganizes historical repair experiences into two complementary memories: an\nepisodic memory that stores concrete repair demonstrations, and a semantic\nmemory that encodes abstract reflective insights. At inference time, ExpeRepair\nactivates both memory systems by retrieving relevant demonstrations from\nepisodic memory and recalling high-level repair insights from semantic memory.\nIt further enhances adaptability through dynamic prompt composition,\nsynergistically integrating both memory types to replace static prompts with\ncontext-aware, experience-driven prompts. Experiments on the SWE-bench Lite\nbenchmark demonstrate that ExpeRepair achieves a pass@1 score of 49.3% with\nClaude 3.7 Sonnet, outperforming all state-of-the-art open-source methods.",

    "abstract": "Recent progress in ultrafast optics facilitates the investigation of the\ndynamics of highly multimode quantum states of light, as demonstrated by the\napplication of electro-optic sampling to quantum states of the electromagnetic\nfield. Yet, the complete tomographic reconstruction of optical quantum states\nwith prior unknown statistics and dynamics is still challenging, since\nstate-of-the-art tomographic methods require the measurement of many\northogonal, distinguishable modes. Here, we propose a tomography scheme based\non time-domain quadrature correlation measurements and theoretically\ndemonstrate its ability to reconstruct highly multimode Gaussian states. In\ncontrast to (eight-port) homodyne detection, the two local oscillator pulses\nare shorter in time and are (independently) time-delayed against the pulsed\nquantum state. The distinguishable mode structure is obtained in\npost-processing from the correlation measurement data by orthogonalization. We\nshow that the number of reconstructable modes increases with the number of time\ndelays used and decreases with the temporal extent of the local oscillator. We\nextend and optimise our proposed correlation measurement to electro-optic\nsampling by adding a nonlinear crystal prior to the homodyne detection,\npotentially achieving subcycle resolution in the mid-infrared to THz regime. By\nanalysing the (quantum) correlations present in the measurement data, we show\nhow thermalisation of the quantum state during detection leads to the\nrequirement of correlation measurements. The thermalisation is especially\npronounced in the strong squeezing limit, for which we developed a\nnon-perturbative theory. Furthermore, we open an avenue to extending our\ntomography scheme to non-Gaussian states by theoretically establishing the\ncomplete measurement statistics and showing how to obtain spectral information\nabout pulsed Fock states from the joint statistics.",

The book graph is a common\ngeneralization of a star and a clique, which can be seen by taking $k=1$ and\n$n=1$ respectively. In addition, the Ramsey number of a book graph is closely\nrelated to the diagonal Ramsey number. Thus the study of extremal problems\nrelated to the book graph is of substantial significance. In this paper, we aim\nto investigate the Ramsey number $r(C_4,B_n^{(k)})$ which is the smallest\ninteger $N$ such that for any graph $G$ on $N$ vertices, either $G$ contains\n$C_4$ as a subgraph or the complement $\\overline{G}$ contains $B_n^{(k)}$ as a\nsubgraph. For $k=1$, a pioneer work by Parsons ({\\it Trans.~Amer.~Math.~Soc.,}\n209 (1975), 33--44) gives an upper bound for $r(C_4,B_n^{(1)})$, which is tight\nfor infinitely many $n$. For $k=2$, in a recent paper ({\\em J. Graph Theory,}\n103 (2023), 309--322), the second, the third, and the fourth authors obtained\nthe exact value of $r(C_4,B_{n}^{(2)})$ for infinitely many $n$.

To be\nprecise, given an integer $k \\geq 3$ and a constant $0<\\varepsilon<1$, let\n$n=q^2-kq+t+\\binom{k}{2}-k$ and\n$Q(k,\\varepsilon)=(320k^4)^{k+1}/\\varepsilon^{2k}$, where $1 \\leq t \\leq\n(1-\\varepsilon)q$. We first establish an upper bound for $r(C_4,B_n^{(k)})$\nprovided $q \\geq Q(k,\\varepsilon)$. Then we show the upper bound is tight for\n$q \\geq Q(k,\\varepsilon)$ being a prime power and $1 \\leq t \\leq\n(1-\\varepsilon)q$ under some assumptions. The proof leverages on a simple but\nnovel refinement of a well-known inequality related to a $C_4$-free graph.\nTherefore, for each $k \\geq 3$, we obtain the exact value of $r(C_4,B_n^{(k)})$\nfor infinitely many $n$. Moreover, we prove general upper and lower bounds of\n$r(C_4,B_n^{(k)})$ for $k \\geq 3$.",

The amount of reduction depends on the applied\nstopping criterion, measuring the periodicity of the solution.

We highlight critical failure modes, such as an overemphasis on\nstylistic elements and vulnerability to misleading visual patterns like vintage\naesthetics. Nevertheless, VLMs exhibit strengths in interpretability and\ncontextual analysis, suggesting their potential to augment human expertise in\nforensic workflows. These insights imply that although general-purpose models\ncurrently lack the reliability needed for autonomous deepfake detection, they\nhold promise as integral components in hybrid or human-in-the-loop detection\nframeworks.",

    "abstract": "As the model size continuously increases, pipeline parallelism shows great\npromise in throughput-oriented LLM inference due to its low demand on\ncommunications. However, imbalanced pipeline workloads and complex data\ndependencies in the prefill and decode phases result in massive pipeline\nbubbles and further severe performance reduction. To better exploit the\npipeline parallelism for high-throughput LLM inference, we propose TD-Pipe,\nwith the key idea lies in the temporally-disaggregated pipeline parallelism\narchitecture. Specifically, this architecture disaggregates the prefill and\ndecode phases in the temporal dimension, so as to eliminate pipeline bubbles\ncaused by the phase switching. TD-Pipe identifies potential issues of\nexploiting the novel architecture and provides solutions. First, a\nhierarchy-controller structure is used to better coordinate devices in pipeline\nparallelism by decoupling the scheduling from execution. Second, the AI-based\ngreedy prefill approach aggressively performs more prefills by predicting the\noutput length and simulating the memory usage. Third, the inter-batch work\nstealing approach dynamically balances decode phase workloads between different\nbatches to reduce bubbles. Forth, the spatial-temporal intensity comparison\napproach determines the optimal switch from decode to prefill by comparing the\nperformance drop from reduced computational intensity with that from phase\nswitching bubbles. Extensive experiments show that TD-Pipe effectively\nincreases the throughput of LLM inference by up to 1.91x over the existing\ntensor parallel approach and 2.73x over the existing pipeline parallel approach\non GPU nodes with only PCIe interconnection.",

Achieving this, however, requires extensive configuration,\ndeployment, iterative testing, and analysis, an effort-intensive and\ntime-consuming process. To address this challenge, we introduce an\nauto-benchmarking framework designed to streamline the analysis of\nmulti-tenancy performance in Edge environments. Our framework includes a\nbuilt-in monitoring stack and integrates with widely used benchmarking\nworkloads, such as streaming analytics, database operations, machine learning\napplications, and component-based stress testing. We perform a case-driven\nanalysis and provide valuable insights into the impact of multi-tenancy on Edge\nenvironments with different hardware configurations and diverse workloads.\nFinally, the implementation of our framework, along with the containerized\nworkloads used for experimentation, is publicly available.",

However, different from natural images, HSIs contains high-dimensional\nrich spectral information, which presents new challenges for generating\nadversarial examples. Based on the specific characteristics of HSIs, this paper\nproposes a novel method to enhance the transferability of the adversarial\nexamples for HSI classification using 3D structure-invariant transformation and\nweighted intermediate feature divergence. While keeping the HSIs structure\ninvariant, the proposed method divides the image into blocks in both spatial\nand spectral dimensions. Then, various transformations are applied on each\nblock to increase input diversity and mitigate the overfitting to substitute\nmodels. Moreover, a weighted intermediate feature divergence loss is also\ndesigned by leveraging the differences between the intermediate features of\noriginal and adversarial examples. It constrains the perturbation direction by\nenlarging the feature maps of the original examples, and assigns different\nweights to different feature channels to destroy the features that have a\ngreater impact on HSI classification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nthe adversarial examples generated by the proposed method achieve more\neffective adversarial transferability on three public HSI datasets.\nFurthermore, the method maintains robust attack performance even under defense\nstrategies.",

As such, this paper highlights the\nlimitations of explicit motion-based approaches for human body video\ncompression and investigates the GHVC performance improvement with the aid of\nImplicit Motion Transformation, namely IMT.

Existing methods often rely on specific models or introduce\nexcessive parameters, which limits their practicality. To address these issues,\nwe propose a novel robust MER framework, Causal Inference Distiller (CIDer),\nand introduce a new task, Random Modality Feature Missing (RMFM), to generalize\nthe definition of modality missing. CIDer integrates two key components: a\nModel-Specific Self-Distillation (MSSD) module and a Model-Agnostic Causal\nInference (MACI) module. MSSD enhances robustness under the RMFM task through a\nweight-sharing self-distillation approach applied across low-level features,\nattention maps, and high-level representations. Additionally, a Word-level\nSelf-aligned Attention Module (WSAM) reduces computational complexity, while a\nMultimodal Composite Transformer (MCT) facilitates efficient multimodal fusion.\nTo tackle OOD challenges, MACI employs a tailored causal graph to mitigate\nlabel and language biases using a Multimodal Causal Module (MCM) and\nfine-grained counterfactual texts. Notably, MACI can independently enhance OOD\ngeneralization with minimal additional parameters. Furthermore, we also\nintroduce the new repartitioned MER OOD datasets. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that CIDer achieves robust performance in both RMFM and OOD\nscenarios, with fewer parameters and faster training compared to\nstate-of-the-art methods.

To answer this question, we excited a GdFe\nferrimagnetic alloy, the magnetization of which can be reversed by single laser\npulses, a phenomenon known as toggle switching, by two pulses with a certain\ntime delay in between. Using photoemission electron microscopy and Kerr\nmicroscopy for magnetic domain imaging, we explore the effects of varying\nfluences of the first and second pulse as well as the time delay between the\ntwo pulses. Our results show that when the fluence of the first pulse is\nadjusted just above the threshold of single-pulse switching, a second pulse\nwith about 60% of the fluence of the first pulse, arriving only 3 ps later,\nswitches the magnetization back. This reswitching persists up to about 40 ps\npulse separation. We interpret the latter as the time required for the sample\nto cool down and remagnetize after the first pulse. For shorter time delays\nbelow about 2 ps, no re-switching occurs. However, the effect of the two pulses\nadds up, enabling switching for fluences of both pulses below the threshold for\nsingle-pulse switching.

The code is a nonstabilizer code,\nand is also a nonlinear quantum error correcting code, meaning that quantum\ninformation is encoded in a parameterized family of quantum states, rather than\na linear superposition of code words. Syndrome measurements are performed by\nprojecting on states with differing total spin, with an associated correction\nto map states back to the maximum total spin space. We show that the code is\nasymptotically capable of protecting against any single qubit Pauli error for\nGaussian distributed states such as spin coherent state.

Recent works\npropose numerous techniques (that we call DRAM techniques) to enhance\nDRAM-based computing systems' throughput, reliability, and computing\ncapabilities (e.g., in-DRAM bulk data copy). Evaluating the system-wide\nbenefits of DRAM techniques is challenging as they often require modifications\nacross multiple layers of the computing stack. Prior works propose FPGA-based\nplatforms for rapid end-to-end evaluation of DRAM techniques on real DRAM\nchips. Unfortunately, existing platforms fall short in two major aspects: (1)\nthey require deep expertise in hardware description languages, limiting\naccessibility; and (2) they are not designed to accurately model modern\ncomputing systems.\n  We introduce EasyDRAM, an FPGA-based framework for rapid and accurate\nend-to-end evaluation of DRAM techniques on real DRAM chips. EasyDRAM overcomes\nthe main drawbacks of prior FPGA-based platforms with two key ideas. First,\nEasyDRAM removes the need for hardware description language expertise by\nenabling developers to implement DRAM techniques using a high-level language\n(C++). At runtime, EasyDRAM executes the software-defined memory system design\nin a programmable memory controller. Second, EasyDRAM tackles a fundamental\nchallenge in accurately modeling modern systems: real processors typically\noperate at higher clock frequencies than DRAM, a disparity that is difficult to\nreplicate on FPGA platforms. EasyDRAM addresses this challenge by decoupling\nthe processor-DRAM interface and advancing the system state using a novel\ntechnique we call time scaling, which faithfully captures the timing behavior\nof the modeled system.\n  We believe and hope that EasyDRAM will enable innovative ideas in memory\nsystem design to rapidly come to fruition.

However,\nthe increasing complexity of these frameworks brings non-trivial software bugs,\nwhich may degrade training performance, cause unexpected failures, and result\nin significant resource waste. Understanding framework bugs' characteristics is\nfundamental for quality assurance, allowing the design of more effective\ndebugging and repair methods. Thus, our paper conducts the first large-scale\nempirical analysis of 308 fixed bugs across three popular distributed\ntraining/inference frameworks: DeepSpeed, Megatron-LM, and Colossal-AI. We\nexamine bug symptoms, root causes, bug identification and fixing efforts, and\ncommon low-effort fixing strategies. Additionally, the distributed nature of\nthese frameworks introduces unique bug root causes, such as allocation strategy\nerror and distributed communication error. Diagnosing and fixing complex bugs\nremains challenging due to factors like the disconnect between symptoms and\nroot causes, high bug reproduction costs, and low-level or cross-component\ninteractions. Interestingly, we observe that 48% of bug fixes require minimal\ncode changes (<=10 LOC) and follow simple strategies such as conditional logic\noptimization, parameter handling enhancement, or version compatibility\nhandling, indicating potential for automation. Based on these insights, we\noffer several implications for improving the reliability of both distributed\ntraining and inference frameworks and their dependent LLM projects, while also\nidentifying opportunities to leverage LLM-based tools for automated debugging\nand repair.",

While recent deep\nlearning approaches aim to learn discriminative representations, the intrinsic\nvariability and weak priors of small targets often lead to unstable\nperformance. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end IRSTD framework,\ntermed LRRNet, which leverages the low-rank property of infrared image\nbackgrounds. Inspired by the physical compressibility of cluttered scenes, our\napproach adopts a compression--reconstruction--subtraction (CRS) paradigm to\ndirectly model structure-aware low-rank background representations in the image\ndomain, without relying on patch-based processing or explicit matrix\ndecomposition. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to directly\nlearn low-rank background structures using deep neural networks in an\nend-to-end manner. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets\ndemonstrate that LRRNet outperforms 38 state-of-the-art methods in terms of\ndetection accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency.

We\nconceptualize effective audio-LLM interaction as the LLM's ability to\nproficiently probe the audio encoder representations to satisfy textual\nqueries. This paper presents a systematic investigation on how architectural\ndesign choices can affect that. Beginning with a standard Pengi/LLaVA-style\naudio-LLM architecture, we propose and evaluate several modifications guided by\nhypotheses derived from mechanistic interpretability studies and LLM\noperational principles. Our experiments demonstrate that: (1) delaying audio\nintegration until the LLM's initial layers establish textual context that\nenhances its ability to probe the audio representations for relevant\ninformation; (2) the LLM can proficiently probe audio representations\nexclusively through LLM layer's attention submodule, without requiring\npropagation to its Feed-Forward Network (FFN) submodule; (3) an efficiently\nintegrated ensemble of diverse audio encoders provides richer, complementary\nrepresentations, thereby broadening the LLM's capacity to probe a wider\nspectrum of audio information. All hypotheses are evaluated using an identical\nthree-stage training curriculum on a dataset of 5.6 million audio-text pairs,\nensuring controlled comparisons. Our final architecture, which incorporates all\nproposed modifications, achieves relative improvements from 10\\% to 60\\% over\nthe baseline, validating our approach to optimizing cross-modal information\ntransfer in audio-LLMs. Project page: https://ta012.github.io/PAL/",

First, any water formed from oxidation reactions in the magma ocean\nwould quickly outgass because of the water-poor atmosphere above. Second, the\ntop boundary layer of the magma ocean becomes stable against convection because\nthe oxidation reactions produce metallic iron, which sinks to the core of a\ngrowing Earth.

To address this limitation, we developed a\ncomprehensive dataset featuring detailed alignment scores that reveal the\nhidden spectrum of audio-visual perceptual correspondence. Using these precise\nscores, we create \"superaligned\" representations by training exclusively on the\nmost perfectly matched audio-visual pairs, then conduct our systematic\ninvestigation into how this extreme alignment transforms perceptual model\nbehavior across retrieval and generation tasks. The encoders under study fall\ninto two main groups consisting of image-centric encoders that were pretrained\nusing visual modalities as intermediary hubs for connecting modalities, and\ntext-centric encoders that were pretrained with direct audio-language\nalignment. We first measure the baseline performance of these encoders on two\nkey tasks, namely cross-modal retrieval and text description generation in\nvision-language models. Subsequently, we realign all encoders with the CLIP\nspace using highly coherent audio-visual data and observe the performance\nchanges. Our findings reveal that the initial architectural type of the encoder\ndetermines how it responds to the alignment process. Image-centric encoders,\nwhich are inherently designed for alignment, demonstrate exceptional\nperformance in cross-modal retrieval, but this intensive alignment causes\ncompression of unique linguistic information and reduces the quality of their\ntext description generation in vision-language models.

Building on this, we propose\nthe Collapsing Sequence-Level Data-Policy Coverage (CSDPC) poisoning attack.\nConsidering the continuous nature of offline RL data, we convert state-action\npairs into decision units, and extract representative decision patterns that\ncapture multi-step behavior. We identify rare patterns likely to cause\ninsufficient coverage, and poison them to reduce coverage and exacerbate\ndistributional shifts. Experiments show that poisoning just 1% of the dataset\ncan degrade agent performance by 90%. This finding provides new perspectives\nfor analyzing and safeguarding the security of offline RL.",

    "abstract": "This Roadmap article addresses the critical and multifaceted challenge of\nplasma-facing component (PFC) damage caused by runaway electrons (REs) in\ntokamaks, a phenomenon that poses a significant threat to the viability and\nlongevity of future fusion reactors such as ITER and DEMO. The dramatically\nincreased RE production expected in future high-current tokamaks makes it\ndifficult to avoid or mitigate REs when a plasma discharge terminates\nabnormally. Preventing damage from the intense localised heat loads REs can\ncause requires a holistic approach that considers plasma, REs and PFC damage.\nDespite decades of progress in understanding the physics of REs and the\nthermomechanical response of PFCs, their complex interplay remains poorly\nunderstood. This document aims to initiate a coordinated, interdisciplinary\napproach to bridge this gap by reviewing experimental evidence, advancing\ndiagnostic capabilities, and improving modelling tools across different scales,\ndimensionalities and fidelities. Key topics include RE beam formation and\ntransport, damage mechanisms in brittle and metallic PFCs, and observations in\nmajor facilities such as JET, DIII-D, WEST and EAST. The Roadmap emphasises the\nurgency of predictive, high-fidelity modelling validated against well-diagnosed\ncontrolled experiments, particularly in the light of recent changes in ITER's\nwall material strategy and the growing importance of private sector\ninitiatives. Each section of the article is written to provide a concise\noverview of one area of this multidisciplinary subject, with an assessment of\nthe status, a look at current and future challenges, and a brief summary. The\nultimate goal of this initiative is to guide future mitigation strategies and\ndesign resilient components that can withstand the loads imposed by REs, thus\nensuring the safe and sustainable operation of the next generation of fusion\npower plants.",

This verify-then-revise workflow not only alleviates model collapse but\nalso jointly enhances both reasoning and verification abilities.

    "abstract": "Increasing wildfire occurrence has spurred growing interest in wildfire\nspread prediction. However, even the most complex wildfire models diverge from\nobserved progression during multi-day simulations, motivating need for data\nassimilation. A useful approach to assimilating measurement data into complex\ncoupled atmosphere-wildfire models is to estimate wildfire progression from\nmeasurements and use this progression to develop a matching atmospheric state.\nIn this study, an approach is developed for estimating fire progression from\nVIIRS active fire measurements, GOES-derived ignition times, and terrain height\ndata. A conditional Generative Adversarial Network is trained with simulations\nof historic wildfires from the atmosphere-wildfire model WRF-SFIRE, thus\nallowing incorporation of WRF-SFIRE physics into estimates. Fire progression is\nsuccinctly represented by fire arrival time, and measurements for training are\nobtained by applying an approximate observation operator to WRF-SFIRE\nsolutions, eliminating need for satellite data during training. The model is\ntrained on tuples of fire arrival times, measurements, and terrain, and once\ntrained leverages measurements of real fires and corresponding terrain data to\ngenerate samples of fire arrival times. The approach is validated on five\nPacific US wildfires, with results compared against high-resolution perimeters\nmeasured via aircraft, finding an average Sorensen-Dice coefficient of 0.81.\nThe influence of terrain height on the arrival time inference is also evaluated\nand it is observed that terrain has minimal influence when the inference is\nconditioned on satellite measurements.",

    "abstract": "Accurate reconstruction of ocean is essential for reflecting global climate\ndynamics and supporting marine meteorological research. Conventional methods\nface challenges due to sparse data, algorithmic complexity, and high\ncomputational costs, while increasing usage of machine learning (ML) method\nremains limited to reconstruction problems at the sea surface and local\nregions, struggling with issues like cloud occlusion. To address these\nlimitations, this paper proposes ReconMOST, a data-driven guided diffusion\nmodel framework for multi-layer sea temperature reconstruction. Specifically,\nwe first pre-train an unconditional diffusion model using a large collection of\nhistorical numerical simulation data, enabling the model to attain physically\nconsistent distribution patterns of ocean temperature fields. During the\ngeneration phase, sparse yet high-accuracy in-situ observational data are\nutilized as guidance points for the reverse diffusion process, generating\naccurate reconstruction results. Importantly, in regions lacking direct\nobservational data, the physically consistent spatial distribution patterns\nlearned during pre-training enable implicitly guided and physically plausible\nreconstructions. Our method extends ML-based SST reconstruction to a global,\nmulti-layer setting, handling over 92.5% missing data while maintaining\nreconstruction accuracy, spatial resolution, and superior generalization\ncapability. We pre-train our model on CMIP6 numerical simulation data and\nconduct guided reconstruction experiments on CMIP6 and EN4 analysis data. The\nresults of mean squared error (MSE) values achieve 0.049 on guidance, 0.680 on\nreconstruction, and 0.633 on total, respectively, demonstrating the\neffectiveness and robustness of the proposed framework.

To address this,\nwe introduce a fully differentiable Dynamic Adaptive Region Tokenizer (DART),\nwhich adaptively partitions images into content-dependent patches of varying\nsizes. DART combines learnable region scores with piecewise differentiable\nquantile operations to allocate denser tokens to information-rich areas.\nDespite introducing only approximately 1 million (1M) additional parameters,\nDART improves accuracy by 2.1% on DeiT (ImageNet-1K). Unlike methods that\nuniformly increase token density to capture fine-grained details, DART offers a\nmore efficient alternative, achieving 45% FLOPs reduction with superior\nperformance. Extensive experiments on DeiT, Vim, and VideoMamba confirm that\nDART consistently enhances accuracy while incurring minimal or even reduced\ncomputational overhead.

In this\npaper, inspired by how humans generalize knowledge in open-ended environments,\nwe propose a Hierarchical Multimodal Skills (HMS) module to tackle the issue of\ninsufficient knowledge. It progressively abstracts trajectories into execution\nskills, core skills, and ultimately meta-skills, providing a hierarchical\nknowledge structure for long-horizon task planning.

For such free-space quantum\ncommunication, the brightness of the quantum light source plays an important\nrole due to the atmospheric turbulence and photon loss. A variety of studies\nhave analyzed the SPDC brightness by decomposing biphoton states into LG modes,\nbut they have often relied on a degenerate state, a narrow spectral bandwidth\napproximation, or a thin crystal approximation.

In addition, we\ninvestigate the optimal focal parameters of the pump, signal, and idler to\nmaximize the brightness for a given LG mode.

Traditional approaches to StarCraft\nAI rely on rule-based systems or supervised deep learning, both of which face\nlimitations in adaptability and computational efficiency. In this work, we\nintroduce NeuroPAL, a neuroevolutionary framework that integrates\nNeuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) with Punctuated Anytime Learning\n(PAL) to improve the efficiency of evolutionary training. By alternating\nbetween frequent, low-fidelity training and periodic, high-fidelity\nevaluations, PAL enhances the sample efficiency of NEAT, enabling agents to\ndiscover effective strategies in fewer training iterations. We evaluate\nNeuroPAL in a fixed-map, single-race scenario in StarCraft: Brood War and\ncompare its performance to standard NEAT-based training. Our results show that\nPAL significantly accelerates the learning process, allowing the agent to reach\ncompetitive levels of play in approximately half the training time required by\nNEAT alone.

These four semantics of MDPs arise naturally through\nidentifying different sources of randomness in an MDP (namely schedulers,\nconfigurations, and transitions) and providing different ways of interpreting\nthese probabilities (called the chance and mass interpretations). These\nsemantics are systematically unified through a mathematical construct called\nchance-mass (CM) classifier. As another main contribution, we study a\nreachability problem in each of the two new semantics, demonstrating their\nhardness and providing two algorithms for solving them.",

The automation of\nUI2Code is essential to streamline this task, beneficial for improving the\ndevelopment efficiency. There exist deep learning-based methods for the task;\nhowever, they heavily rely on a large amount of labeled training data and\nstruggle with generalizing to real-world, unseen web page designs. The advent\nof Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) presents potential for alleviating\nthe issue, but they are difficult to comprehend the complex layouts in UIs and\ngenerate the accurate code with layout preserved. To address these issues, we\npropose LayoutCoder, a novel MLLM-based framework generating UI code from\nreal-world webpage images, which includes three key modules: (1) Element\nRelation Construction, which aims at capturing UI layout by identifying and\ngrouping components with similar structures; (2) UI Layout Parsing, which aims\nat generating UI layout trees for guiding the subsequent code generation\nprocess; and (3) Layout-Guided Code Fusion, which aims at producing the\naccurate code with layout preserved. For evaluation, we build a new benchmark\ndataset which involves 350 real-world websites named Snap2Code, divided into\nseen and unseen parts for mitigating the data leakage issue, besides the\npopular dataset Design2Code. Extensive evaluation shows the superior\nperformance of LayoutCoder over the state-of-the-art approaches. Compared with\nthe best-performing baseline, LayoutCoder improves 10.14% in the BLEU score and\n3.95% in the CLIP score on average across all datasets.",

Traditionally, Field Operational Testing (FOT) has been\npivotal for macroscopic safety validation of automotive driving functions up to\nSAE automation level 2. However, state-of-the-art derivations for empirical\nsafety demonstrations using FOT often result in impractical testing efforts,\nparticularly at higher automation levels. Even at lower automation levels, this\nlimitation - coupled with the substantial costs associated with FOT - motivates\nthe exploration of approaches to enhance the efficiency of FOT-based\nmacroscopic safety validation. Therefore, this publication systematically\nidentifies and evaluates state-of-the-art Reduction Approaches (RAs) for FOT,\nincluding novel methods reported in the literature. Based on an analysis of ISO\n21448, two models are derived: a generic model capturing the argumentation\ncomponents of the standard, and a base model, exemplarily applied to Automatic\nEmergency Braking (AEB) systems, establishing a baseline for the real-world\ndriving requirement for a Quantitative Safety Validation of Residual Risk\n(QSVRR). Subsequently, the RAs are assessed using four criteria:\nquantifiability, threats to validity, missing links, and black box\ncompatibility, highlighting potential benefits, inherent limitations, and\nidentifying key areas for further research. Our evaluation reveals that, while\nseveral approaches offer potential, none are free from missing links or other\nsubstantial shortcomings.

We demonstrate two phenomena for\nthe behavior of the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE), which depend on the\nnoise level, the radius of the (quasi)norm constraint, the dimension, and the\nnorm index $p$. First, if $p$ lies between $0$ and $1 + \\Theta(\\tfrac{1}{\\log\nd})$, inclusive, or if it is greater than or equal to $2$, the MLE is minimax\nrate-optimal for all noise levels and all constraint radii. On the other hand,\nfor the remaining norm indices -- namely, if $p$ lies between $1 +\n\\Theta(\\tfrac{1}{\\log d})$ and $2$ -- here is a more striking behavior: the MLE\nis minimax rate-suboptimal, despite its nonlinearity in the observations, for\nessentially all noise levels and constraint radii for which nonlinear estimates\nare necessary for minimax-optimal estimation. Our results imply that when given\n$n$ independent and identically distributed Gaussian samples, the MLE can be\nsuboptimal by a polynomial factor in the sample size. Our lower bounds are\nconstructive: whenever the MLE is rate-suboptimal, we provide explicit\ninstances on which the MLE provably incurs suboptimal risk.

Although existing approaches have made notable progress in semantic\nalignment and motion synthesis, they often rely on end-to-end mapping\nstrategies that fail to capture deep linguistic structures and logical\nreasoning. Consequently, generated motions tend to lack controllability,\nconsistency, and diversity. To address these limitations, we propose Motion-R1,\na unified motion-language modeling framework that integrates a Chain-of-Thought\nmechanism.

The framework is\nbuilt on the premise that irreversible evolution of material responses,\ngoverned by hidden dynamics, can be inferred from observable data.\n  We develop the History-Aware Neural Operator (HANO), an autoregressive model\nthat predicts path-dependent material responses from short segments of recent\nstrain-stress history without relying on hidden state variables, thereby\novercoming self-consistency issues commonly encountered in recurrent neural\nnetwork (RNN)-based models. Built on a Fourier-based neural operator backbone,\nHANO enables discretization-invariant learning. To enhance its ability to\ncapture both global loading patterns and critical local path dependencies, we\nembed a hierarchical self-attention mechanism that facilitates multiscale\nfeature extraction.\n  Beyond ensuring self-consistency, HANO mitigates sensitivity to initial\nhidden states, a commonly overlooked issue that can lead to instability in\nrecurrent models when applied to generalized loading paths. By modeling\nstress-strain evolution as a continuous operator rather than relying on fixed\ninput-output mappings, HANO naturally accommodates varying path discretizations\nand exhibits robust performance under complex conditions, including irregular\nsampling, multi-cycle loading, noisy data, and pre-stressed states. We evaluate\nHANO on two benchmark problems: elastoplasticity with hardening and progressive\nanisotropic damage in brittle solids.

However, the power\nconsumption of conventional IRSs cannot be ignored due to the large number of\nreflecting elements and control circuits. To balance performance and power\nconsumption, we previously proposed a heterogeneous-IRS (HE-IRS), a green IRS\nstructure integrating dynamically tunable elements (DTEs) and statically\ntunable elements (STEs). Compared to conventional IRSs with only DTEs, the\nunique DTE-STE integrated structure introduces new challenges in both channel\nestimation and beamforming. In this paper, we investigate the channel\nestimation and beamforming problems in HE-IRS-assisted multi-user\nmultiple-input multiple-output systems. Unlike the overall cascaded channel\nestimated in conventional IRSs, we show that the HE-IRS channel to be estimated\nis decomposed into a DTE-based cascaded channel and an STE-based equivalent\nchannel. Leveraging it along with the inherent sparsity of DTE- and STE-based\nchannels and manifold optimization, we propose an efficient channel estimation\nscheme. To address the rank mismatch problem in the imperfect channel sparsity\ninformation, a robust rank selection rule is developed. For beamforming, we\npropose an offline algorithm to optimize the STE phase shifts for wide beam\ncoverage, and an online algorithm to optimize the BS precoder and the DTE phase\nshifts using the estimated HE-IRS channel.

    "abstract": "Keyphrase generation refers to the task of producing a set of words or\nphrases that summarises the content of a document. Continuous efforts have been\ndedicated to this task over the past few years, spreading across multiple lines\nof research, such as model architectures, data resources, and use-case\nscenarios. Yet, the current state of keyphrase generation remains unknown as\nthere has been no attempt to review and analyse previous work. In this paper,\nwe bridge this gap by presenting an analysis of over 50 research papers on\nkeyphrase generation, offering a comprehensive overview of recent progress,\nlimitations, and open challenges. Our findings highlight several critical\nissues in current evaluation practices, such as the concerning similarity among\ncommonly-used benchmark datasets and inconsistencies in metric calculations\nleading to overestimated performances.

This is suboptimal because resampling can\nintroduce artifacts due to interpolation. To address this, we present\nRealKeyMorph (RKM), a resolution-agnostic method for image registration. RKM is\nan extension of KeyMorph, a registration framework which works by training a\nnetwork to learn corresponding keypoints for a given pair of images, after\nwhich a closed-form keypoint matching step is used to derive the transformation\nthat aligns them. To avoid resampling and enable operating on the raw data, RKM\noutputs keypoints in real-world coordinates of the scanner. To do this, we\nleverage the affine matrix produced by the scanner (e.g., MRI machine) that\nencodes the mapping from voxel coordinates to real world coordinates. By\ntransforming keypoints into real-world space and integrating this into the\ntraining process, RKM effectively enables the extracted keypoints to be\nresolution-agnostic. In our experiments, we demonstrate the advantages of RKM\non the registration task for orthogonal 2D stacks of abdominal MRIs, as well as\n3D volumes with varying resolutions in brain datasets.",

To address this, we propose a multimodal research framework based on\nvision-language models, enabling automated and scalable analysis of urban\nstreetscape style differences. This approach enhances the objectivity and\ndata-driven nature of urban form research. The contributions of this study are\nas follows: First, we construct UrbanDiffBench, a curated dataset of urban\nstreetscapes containing architectural images from different periods and\nregions. Second, we develop UrbanSense, the first vision-language-model-based\nframework for urban streetscape analysis, enabling the quantitative generation\nand comparison of urban style representations.

In particular, our work demonstrates that numerous\nstructural properties open the door for designing polynomial-time approximation\nschemes, including polynomially-bounded cycle lengths, constantly-many distinct\ntime intervals, so-called nested instances, and pairwise coprime settings.\nThese findings offer substantial improvements over currently available\nconstant-factor approximations and resolve outstanding open questions in their\nrespective contexts. In parallel, we develop new theory around a number of\nyet-uncharted questions, related to the sampling complexity of peak inventory\nestimation as well as to the plausibility of groupwise synchronization.\nInterestingly, we establish the global nature of inventory staggering, proving\nthat there are $n$-item instances where, for every subset of roughly $\\sqrt{n}$\nitems, no policy improves on the worst-possible one by a factor greater than\n$1+\\epsilon$, whereas for the entire instance, there exists a policy that\noutperforms the worst-possible one by a factor of nearly $2$, which is optimal.",

Preliminary results indicate that both models\ndemonstrate moderate performance in academic facial expression recognition,\nwith Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct outperforming Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct.\nNotably, both models excel in identifying students' happy emotions but fail to\ndetect distracted behavior. Additionally, Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct exhibits\nrelatively high performance in recognizing students' confused expressions,\nhighlighting its potential for practical applications in identifying content\nthat causes student confusion.",

EAGLE introduces four key\ninnovations: (1) dynamic cross-modal attention mechanisms that learn\nhierarchical relationships between modalities, (2) massive dimensionality\nreduction (99.96%) while maintaining predictive performance, (3) three\ncomplementary attribution methods providing patient-level interpretability, and\n(4) a unified pipeline enabling seamless adaptation across cancer types. We\nevaluated EAGLE on 911 patients across three distinct malignancies:\nglioblastoma (GBM, n=160), intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMN,\nn=171), and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC, n=580). Patient-level analysis\nshowed high-risk individuals relied more heavily on adverse imaging features,\nwhile low-risk patients demonstrated balanced modality contributions. Risk\nstratification identified clinically meaningful groups with 4-fold (GBM) to\n5-fold (NSCLC) differences in median survival, directly informing treatment\nintensity decisions.

While many existing methods leverage Graph Neural Networks\n(GNNs) to incorporate collaborative information and improve recommendation\naccuracy, most of them model each type of context using separate graphs,\ntreating different factors in isolation. This limits their ability to model the\nco-influence of multiple contextual factors on user transitions during message\npropagation, resulting in suboptimal attention weights and recommendation\nperformance. Furthermore, they often prioritize sequential components as the\nprimary predictor, potentially undermining the semantic and structural\ninformation encoded in the POI embeddings learned by GNNs. To address these\nlimitations, we propose a Context-Adaptive Graph Neural Networks (CAGNN) for\nnext POI recommendation, which dynamically adjusts attention weights using\nedge-specific contextual factors and enables mutual enhancement between\ngraph-based and sequential components. Specifically, CAGNN introduces (1) a\ncontext-adaptive attention mechanism that jointly incorporates different types\nof contextual factors into the attention computation during graph propagation,\nenabling the model to dynamically capture collaborative and context-dependent\ntransition patterns; (2) a graph-sequential mutual enhancement module, which\naligns the outputs of the graph- and sequential-based modules via the KL\ndivergence, enabling mutual enhancement of both components.

    "abstract": "This work extends the results of the preprint Ramanujan type Series for\nLogarithms, Part I, arXiv:2506.08245, which introduced single hypergeometric\ntype identities for the efficient computing of $\\log(p)$, where\n$p\\in\\mathbb{Z}_{>1}$. We present novel formulas for arctangents and methods\nfor a very fast multiseries evaluation of logarithms. Building upon a\n$\\mathcal{O}((p-1)^{6})$ Ramanujan type series asymptotic approximation for\n$\\log(p)$ as $p\\rightarrow1$, formulas for computing $n$ simultaneous\nlogarithms are developed. These formulas are derived by solving an integer\nprogramming problem to identify optimal variable values within a finite lattice\n$\\mathbb{Z}^{n}$. This approach yields linear combinations of series that\nprovide: (i) highly efficient formulas for single logarithms of natural numbers\nand (ii) the fastest known hypergeometric formulas for multivalued logarithms\nof $n$ selected integers in $\\mathbb{Z}_{>1}$. An application of these results\nwas to extend the number of decimal places known for log(10) up to\n2.0$\\cdot$10$^{12}$ digits (June 06 2025).",

The first model is the usual Bose Hubbard model\nwith real hopping coefficients and attractive interactions. The second model is\na two-component Bose Hubbard model. Under certain conditions, we show that the\nground state in the subspace with particle number $N=2n$($n$ is a positive\ninteger) is unique for both models. For the second model, we show that the\nground state has spin along the z-axis $S^{z}=0$. When the hopping coefficients\nare real, it has zero spin quantum number, i.e., it is a singlet. Our proofs\nwork equally well for any arbitrary finite-size lattice.",

No significant signal over the expected background is observed in\nthe investigated region and the upper limit on the inclusive branching fraction\nof $J/\\psi\\rightarrow\\phi + X$ is determined to be $7.0\\times10^{-8}$ at 90\\%\nconfidence level. Upper limits at a 90\\% confidence level are also given for\nthis branching fraction as a function of the invisible particle mass, varying\nfrom $4\\times10^{-9}$ to $4\\times10^{-8}$ over the investigated mass range.\nAdditionally, a 90\\% confidence level upper limit on the branching fraction of\n$\\eta\\rightarrow \\rm{invisible}$ is determined to $2.4\\times10^{-5}$, which\nimproves the previous best results by more than four times. The analysis\ntechnique in this work offers a clean window to search for sub-GeV invisible\nparticles, which can be adapted for other $J/\\psi$ decays and direct $e^+e^-$\nannihilation experiments in future studies, and improve the sensitivity by\norders of magnitude.",

    "abstract": "Learned optimizers have been an active research topic over the past decade,\nwith increasing progress toward practical, general-purpose optimizers that can\nserve as drop-in replacements for widely used methods like Adam. However,\nrecent advances -- such as VeLO, which was meta-trained for 4000 TPU-months --\nremain largely inaccessible to the broader community, in part due to their\nreliance on JAX and the absence of user-friendly packages for applying the\noptimizers after meta-training. To address this gap, we introduce PyLO, a\nPyTorch-based library that brings learned optimizers to the broader machine\nlearning community through familiar, widely adopted workflows. Unlike prior\nwork focused on synthetic or convex tasks, our emphasis is on applying learned\noptimization to real-world large-scale pre-training tasks. Our release includes\na CUDA-accelerated version of the small_fc_lopt learned optimizer architecture\nfrom (Metz et al., 2022a), delivering substantial speedups -- from 39.36 to\n205.59 samples/sec throughput for training ViT B/16 with batch size 32. PyLO\nalso allows us to easily combine learned optimizers with existing optimization\ntools such as learning rate schedules and weight decay. When doing so, we find\nthat learned optimizers can substantially benefit. Our code is available at\nhttps://github.com/Belilovsky-Lab/pylo",

As a result, they struggle to effectively model the behaviour of\nspecific sockpuppet-groups, especially when text data is limited. To address\nthis, we propose the application of meta-learning, a machine learning technique\ndesigned to improve performance in data-scarce settings by training models\nacross multiple tasks. Meta-learning optimises a model for rapid adaptation to\nthe writing style of a new sockpuppet-group. Our results show that\nmeta-learning significantly enhances the precision of predictions compared to\npre-trained models, marking an advancement in combating sockpuppetry on open\nediting platforms.

This naturally captures\napplications in which one aims to balance the exploration burden between groups\nor populations -- it is known that standard algorithms can lead to\nsignificantly imbalanced exploration cost between groups. We address this\nproblem by introducing an algorithm Col-UCB that dynamically coordinates\nexploration across groups.

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel freight multimodal transport problem with buses\nand drones, where buses are responsible for transporting parcels to lockers at\nbus stops for storage, while drones are used to deliver each parcel from the\nlocker to the corresponding customer. The integrated bus-drone system\nsynergistically expands drone service coverage using the bus network to ensure\nefficient final delivery. Minimizing the total operational costs while\nsatisfying customer demands necessitates the joint optimization of parcel\nassignments and drone flights. We model the problem into a compact\nmixed-integer linear programming formulation and propose an integer programming\nformulation with exponentially many variables. To address real-world scale\ninstances, we propose a Branch-Price-and-Benders-Cut algorithm for this\nnon-deterministic polynomial-time (NP)-hard problem. This algorithm,\nintegrating column generation and Benders decomposition within a\nBranch-and-Bound framework, is developed to obtain optimal or near-optimal\nsolutions. Additionally, we introduce algorithmic enhancements aimed at\naccelerating the convergence of the algorithm. Computational experiments on\ninstances generated from real-world bus data demonstrate that the proposed\nalgorithms outperform CPLEX regarding both efficiency and solution quality.\nMoreover, our approaches can lead to over 6% cost savings compared to\nsituations where we determine parcel assignments and drone flights\nsequentially. We evaluate the environmental advantages of integrating buses and\ndrones, study the impact of different cost parameters in the system, and\ninvestigate the impact of the parcel locker configuration on performance. These\nfindings provide valuable managerial insights for urban logistics managers,\nhighlighting the potential of the integrated bus-drone system to improve\ntraditional last-mile delivery.",

    "abstract": "Dynamic Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) exhibits transformation symmetries,\nincluding spatial rotation symmetry within individual frames and temporal\nsymmetry along the time dimension. Explicit incorporation of these symmetry\npriors in the reconstruction model can significantly improve image quality,\nespecially under aggressive undersampling scenarios. Recently, Equivariant\nconvolutional neural network (ECNN) has shown great promise in exploiting\nspatial symmetry priors. However, existing ECNNs critically fail to model\ntemporal symmetry, arguably the most universal and informative structural prior\nin dynamic MRI reconstruction. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel Deep\nUnrolling Network with Spatiotemporal Rotation Equivariance (DUN-SRE) for\nDynamic MRI Reconstruction. The DUN-SRE establishes spatiotemporal equivariance\nthrough a (2+1)D equivariant convolutional architecture. In particular, it\nintegrates both the data consistency and proximal mapping module into a unified\ndeep unrolling framework. This architecture ensures rigorous propagation of\nspatiotemporal rotation symmetry constraints throughout the reconstruction\nprocess, enabling more physically accurate modeling of cardiac motion dynamics\nin cine MRI. In addition, a high-fidelity group filter parameterization\nmechanism is developed to maintain representation precision while enforcing\nsymmetry constraints. Comprehensive experiments on Cardiac CINE MRI datasets\ndemonstrate that DUN-SRE achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly in\npreserving rotation-symmetric structures, offering strong generalization\ncapability to a broad range of dynamic MRI reconstruction tasks.",

Method is based\nonly on the radar data obtained, the results of automatic modeling of radio\nwave propagation in the ionosphere, and mathematical criteria for estimating\nthe quality of the models. The final classifier is the model trained at data\nobtained by 12 radars of the SuperDARN and SECIRA networks over two years for\neach radar. The number of the model coefficients is 2669. For the\nclassification, the model uses both the calculated parameters of radio wave\npropagation in the model ionosphere and the parameters directly measured by the\nradar. Calibration of radiowave elevation measurements at each radar was made\nusing meteor trail scattered signals. The analysis showed that the optimal\nnumber of classes in the data is 37, of which 25 are frequently observed. The\nanalysis made it possible to choose 14 classes from them, which are confidently\nseparated in other variants of model training. A preliminary interpretation of\n10 of them was carried out. The dynamics of observation of various classes and\ntheir dependence on the geographical latitude of radars at different levels of\nsolar and geomagnetic activity were presented, it was shown that it does not\ncontradict with known physical mechanisms.

    "abstract": "This paper argues that AI alignment is not merely difficult, but is founded\non a fundamental logical contradiction. We first establish The Enumeration\nParadox: we use machine learning precisely because we cannot enumerate all\nnecessary safety rules, yet making ML safe requires examples that can only be\ngenerated from the very enumeration we admit is impossible. This paradox is\nthen confirmed by a set of five independent mathematical proofs, or \"pillars of\nimpossibility.\" Our main results show that: (1) Geometric Impossibility: The\nset of safe policies has measure zero, a necessary consequence of projecting\ninfinite-dimensional world-context requirements onto finite-dimensional models.\n(2) Computational Impossibility: Verifying a policy's safety is coNP-complete,\neven for non-zero error tolerances. (3) Statistical Impossibility: The training\ndata required for safety (abundant examples of rare disasters) is a logical\ncontradiction and thus unobtainable. (4) Information-Theoretic Impossibility:\nSafety rules contain more incompressible, arbitrary information than any\nfeasible network can store. (5) Dynamic Impossibility: The optimization process\nfor increasing AI capability is actively hostile to safety, as the gradients\nfor the two objectives are generally anti-aligned. Together, these results\ndemonstrate that the pursuit of safe, highly capable AI is not a matter of\novercoming technical hurdles, but of confronting fundamental, interlocking\nbarriers. The paper concludes by presenting a strategic trilemma that these\nimpossibilities force upon the field. A formal verification of the core\ntheorems in Lean4 is currently in progress.",

Central to the model is a reinterpretation of\nthe Heisenberg uncertainty principle - not as a statistical or epistemic\nlimitation, but as a dynamical relation between kinetic energy transfer and\nwavefield contraction. This framework yields testable predictions about how\nweak, intermediate, and strong quantum interactions modulate spatial\nlocalization - predictions consistent with existing experimental findings.

In addition to the entropy, we also analyze\nthe time evolution of the pressure anisotropy and the scalar condensate of the\nmedium. When the system is far-from-equilibrium the dominant and weak energy\nconditions can be transiently violated. Remarkably, for all initial conditions\nconsidered, we observe the emergence of a periodic sequence of several close\nplateaus forming a stairway for the entropy as the system approaches\nthermodynamic equilibrium. The entropy stairway allows for the entropy to\nencode a periodic structure without violating the second law of thermodynamics.\nIn fact, the complex frequency of the lowest quasinormal mode (QNM) of the\nsystem is directly tied to the periodic structure of the entropy stairway.\nFurthermore, when the chemical potential of the fluid exceeds a certain\nthreshold, the pressure anisotropy exhibits a late-time decay governed by a\npurely imaginary QNM, and as the system is doped with increasing values of\nR-charge chemical potential the late-time equilibration pattern of the pressure\nanisotropy gets increasingly deformed, eventually losing the oscillatory\nbehavior observed at lower values of chemical potential. Taken together with\nprevious results for the purely thermal Supersymmetric Yang-Mills (SYM) plasma\nand the 1 R-Charge Black Hole (1RCBH) plasma, our findings lend support to the\nconjecture of the universality of the entropy stairway in strongly interacting\nmedia with holographic duals undergoing homogeneous isotropization dynamics.",

Moreover, most recent approaches to the few-label classification\nproblem are either designed for resource-rich languages such as English or\ninvolve complex cascading models that are prone to overfitting. To address the\npersistent challenge of few-label text classification in truly low-resource\nlinguistic contexts, where existing methods often struggle with noisy\npseudo-labels and domain adaptation, we propose Flick. Unlike prior methods\nthat rely on generic multi-cluster pseudo-labelling or complex cascading\narchitectures, Flick leverages the fundamental insight that distilling\nhigh-confidence pseudo-labels from a broader set of initial clusters can\ndramatically improve pseudo-label quality, particularly for linguistically\ndiverse, low-resource settings. Flick introduces a novel pseudo-label\nrefinement component, a departure from traditional pseudo-labelling strategies\nby identifying and leveraging top-performing pseudo-label clusters. This\ncomponent specifically learns to distil highly reliable pseudo-labels from an\ninitial broad set by focusing on single-cluster cohesion and leveraging an\nadaptive top-k selection mechanism. This targeted refinement process is crucial\nfor mitigating the propagation of errors inherent in low-resource data,\nallowing for robust fine-tuning of pre-trained language models with only a\nhandful of true labels.

Machine learning techniques are frequently used to\naddress such tasks, typically by leveraging model error bounds to specify\nrobust constraint-based safety filters. However, if the learned model\nuncertainty is very high, the corresponding filters are potentially invalid,\nmeaning no control input satisfies the constraints imposed by the safety\nfilter. While most works address this issue by assuming some form of safe\nbackup controller, ours tackles it by collecting additional data on the fly\nusing a Gaussian process bandit-type algorithm. We combine a control barrier\nfunction with a learned model to specify a robust certificate that ensures\nsafety if feasible. Whenever infeasibility occurs, we leverage the control\nbarrier function to guide exploration, ensuring the collected data contributes\ntoward the closed-loop system safety. By combining a safety filter with\nexploration in this manner, our method provably achieves safety in a setting\nthat allows for a zero-mean prior dynamics model, without requiring a backup\ncontroller.

Auto-regressive models generate sentences by iteratively computing\nand sampling from the distribution of the next token. This iterative sampling\nintroduces stochasticity, leading to the assumption that language models make\nprobabilistic decisions, similar to sampling from unknown distributions.\nBuilding on this assumption, prior research has used simulated Gibbs sampling,\ninspired by experiments designed to elicit human priors, to infer the priors of\nlanguage models. In this paper, we revisit a critical question: Do language\nmodels possess Bayesian brains? Our findings show that under certain\nconditions, language models can exhibit near-deterministic decision-making,\nsuch as producing maximum likelihood estimations, even with a non-zero sampling\ntemperature. This challenges the sampling assumption and undermines previous\nmethods for eliciting human-like priors. Furthermore, we demonstrate that\nwithout proper scrutiny, a system with deterministic behavior undergoing\nsimulated Gibbs sampling can converge to a \"false prior.\" To address this, we\npropose a straightforward approach to distinguish between stochastic and\ndeterministic decision patterns in Gibbs sampling, helping to prevent the\ninference of misleading language model priors.

The \\texttt{kerbb} model fit also estimates the\nspin, distance, and inclination of the source to be $0.13^{+0.03}_{-0.02}$,\n$9.2^{+0.4}_{-0.9}$~kpc, and $80^\\circ.0$$^{+2.7}_{-6.0}$, respectively. The\ncombined spectral study suggests harder spectral state of the source with a\nhigher dominance of the sub-Keplerian halo accretion rate over the Keplerian\ndisk rate. The consistency of the observed frequency of the QPO with that of\nobtained from the \\texttt{TCAF} model fitted shock parameters, confirms shock\noscillation as the origin of the QPO.",

    "abstract": "Human gait analysis with wearable sensors has been widely used in various\napplications, such as daily life healthcare, rehabilitation, physical therapy,\nand clinical diagnostics and monitoring. In particular, ground reaction force\n(GRF) provides critical information about how the body interacts with the\nground during locomotion. Although instrumented treadmills have been widely\nused as the gold standard for measuring GRF during walking, their lack of\nportability and high cost make them impractical for many applications. As an\nalternative, low-cost, portable, wearable insole sensors have been utilized to\nmeasure GRF; however, these sensors are susceptible to noise and disturbance\nand are less accurate than treadmill measurements. To address these challenges,\nwe propose a Time-aware Knowledge Distillation framework for GRF estimation\nfrom insole sensor data. This framework leverages similarity and temporal\nfeatures within a mini-batch during the knowledge distillation process,\neffectively capturing the complementary relationships between features and the\nsequential properties of the target and input data. The performance of the\nlightweight models distilled through this framework was evaluated by comparing\nGRF estimations from insole sensor data against measurements from an\ninstrumented treadmill. Empirical results demonstrated that Time-aware\nKnowledge Distillation outperforms current baselines in GRF estimation from\nwearable sensor data.",

    "abstract": "Recent breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to a\nqualitative leap in artificial intelligence' s performance on reasoning tasks,\nparticularly demonstrating remarkable capabilities in mathematical, symbolic,\nand commonsense reasoning. However, as a critical component of advanced human\ncognition, strategic reasoning, i.e., the ability to assess multi-agent\nbehaviors in dynamic environments, formulate action plans, and adapt\nstrategies, has yet to be systematically evaluated or modeled. To address this\ngap, this paper introduces WGSR-Bench, the first strategy reasoning benchmark\nfor LLMs using wargame as its evaluation environment. Wargame, a quintessential\nhigh-complexity strategic scenario, integrates environmental uncertainty,\nadversarial dynamics, and non-unique strategic choices, making it an effective\ntestbed for assessing LLMs' capabilities in multi-agent decision-making, intent\ninference, and counterfactual reasoning. WGSR-Bench designs test samples around\nthree core tasks, i.e., Environmental situation awareness, Opponent risk\nmodeling and Policy generation, which serve as the core S-POE architecture, to\nsystematically assess main abilities of strategic reasoning. Finally, an\nLLM-based wargame agent is designed to integrate these parts for a\ncomprehensive strategy reasoning assessment. With WGSR-Bench, we hope to assess\nthe strengths and limitations of state-of-the-art LLMs in game-theoretic\nstrategic reasoning and to advance research in large model-driven strategic\nintelligence.",

In many applications such as crowdsourcing services, labels for\nsupervised learning are given by multiple annotators. Since the annotators have\ndifferent skills or biases, given labels can be noisy. To learn accurate\nclassifiers, existing methods require many noisy annotated data. However,\nsufficient data might be unavailable in practice. To overcome the lack of data,\nthe proposed method uses labeled data obtained in different but related tasks.\nThe proposed method embeds each example in tasks to a latent space by using a\nneural network and constructs a probabilistic model for learning a\ntask-specific classifier while estimating annotators' abilities on the latent\nspace. This neural network is meta-learned to improve the expected test\nclassification performance when the classifier is adapted to a given small\namount of annotated data. This classifier adaptation is performed by maximizing\nthe posterior probability via the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm.\nSince each step in the EM algorithm is easily computed as a closed-form and is\ndifferentiable, the proposed method can efficiently backpropagate the loss\nthrough the EM algorithm to meta-learn the neural network.

    "abstract": "Quantum Error Correction (QEC) codes store information reliably in logical\nqubits by encoding them in a larger number of less reliable qubits. The surface\ncode, known for its high resilience to physical errors, is a leading candidate\nfor fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC). Logical qubits encoded with the\nsurface code can be in different phases of their syndrome generation cycle,\nthereby introducing desynchronization in the system. This can occur due to the\nproduction of non-Clifford states, dropouts due to fabrication defects, and the\nuse of other QEC codes with the surface code to reduce resource requirements.\nLogical operations require the syndrome generation cycles of the logical qubits\ninvolved to be synchronized. This requires the leading qubit to pause or slow\ndown its cycle, allowing more errors to accumulate before the next cycle,\nthereby increasing the risk of uncorrectable errors.\n  To synchronize the syndrome generation cycles of logical qubits, we define\nthree policies - Passive, Active, and Hybrid. The Passive policy is the\nbaseline, and the simplest, wherein the leading logical qubits idle until they\nare synchronized with the remaining logical qubits. On the other hand, the\nActive policy aims to slow the leading logical qubits down gradually, by\ninserting short idle periods before multiple code cycles. This approach reduces\nthe logical error rate (LER) by up to 2.4x compared to the Passive policy. The\nHybrid policy further reduces the LER by up to 3.4x by reducing the\nsynchronization slack and running a few additional rounds of error correction.\nFurthermore, the reduction in the logical error rate with the proposed\nsynchronization policies enables a speedup in decoding latency of up to 2.2x\nwith a circuit-level noise model.",

Our DFT+U calculations reveal that\nCaMn2P2 exhibits an indirect gap semiconducting ground state with a localized\nMn2+ electronic configuration and negligible spin-orbit coupling effects. The\ncomputed exchange interactions show that the magnetic behavior is well\ndescribed by a isotropic Heisenberg Hamiltonian. In this model, there are two\nmajor couplings: the NN interaction J1 couples the two Mn layers along the\nc-axis and next NN J2 is in the a-b plane where Mn ions form a hexagonal layer\nstructure. Our results show that both J1 and J2 are antiferromagnetic in nature\nand as a consequence J2 induce frustration owing to the in-plane triangular\ngeometry of the Mn-ions. The J1 is found to promote long-range\nantiferromagnetic order, while the J2 is responsible for spin canting and\ndisorder. Our spin-wave analysis confirms that the system stabilizes a\nspin-spiral ground state with a propagation vector q = (1/6 , 1/6, 0) in\nagreement with neutron diffraction experiments. By tuning the J2/J1 ratio, we\nconstruct a phase diagram that reveals a transition from a collinear Neel\nantiferromagnetic state to different spin-spiral phases, and eventually to a\ndisordered phase at large frustration. Atomistic spin-dynamics simulations\ncapture the temperature evolution of the magnetism and reproduce the\nexperimentally measured magnetic data with good accuracy. Furthermore, for\nlarge J2/J1, we identify a low temperature phase with slow spin relaxation and\npersistent fluctuations, suggesting a spin-liquid like state.

In this study, we propose a\nmodel that incorporates distinct microscopic degrees of freedom and their\ninteractions, without directly relying on conventional coarse-grained\ndescriptions. By introducing two key assumptions, we show that the system can\nexhibit equilibrium states characterized by heterogeneous density profiles with\nfinite length scales, resembling those typically associated with\nnon-equilibrium phenomena. These findings highlight the importance of\ndistinguishing between equilibrium states and non-equilibrium steady states in\nhighly complex systems.",

    "abstract": "In robot navigation and manipulation, accurately determining the camera's\npose relative to the environment is crucial for effective task execution. In\nthis paper, we systematically prove that this problem corresponds to the\nPerspective-3-Point (P3P) formulation, where exactly three known 3D points and\ntheir corresponding 2D image projections are used to estimate the pose of a\nstereo camera. In image-based visual servoing (IBVS) control, the system\nbecomes overdetermined, as the 6 degrees of freedom (DoF) of the stereo camera\nmust align with 9 observed 2D features in the scene. When more constraints are\nimposed than available DoFs, global stability cannot be guaranteed, as the\ncamera may become trapped in a local minimum far from the desired configuration\nduring servoing. To address this issue, we propose a novel control strategy for\naccurately positioning a calibrated stereo camera. Our approach integrates a\nfeedforward controller with a Youla parameterization-based feedback controller,\nensuring robust servoing performance. Through simulations, we demonstrate that\nour method effectively avoids local minima and enables the camera to reach the\ndesired pose accurately and efficiently.",

    "abstract": "Visual servoing technology has been well developed and applied in many\nautomated manufacturing tasks, especially in tools' pose alignment. To access a\nfull global view of tools, most applications adopt eye-to-hand configuration or\neye-to-hand/eye-in-hand cooperation configuration in an automated manufacturing\nenvironment. Most research papers mainly put efforts into developing control\nand observation architectures in various scenarios, but few of them have\ndiscussed the importance of the camera's location in eye-to-hand configuration.\nIn a manufacturing environment, the quality of camera estimations may vary\nsignificantly from one observation location to another, as the combined effects\nof environmental conditions result in different noise levels of a single image\nshot at different locations. In this paper, we propose an algorithm for the\ncamera's moving policy so that it explores the camera workspace and searches\nfor the optimal location where the images' noise level is minimized. Also, this\nalgorithm ensures the camera ends up at a suboptimal (if the optimal one is\nunreachable) location among the locations already searched, with limited energy\navailable for moving the camera. Unlike a simple brute force approach, the\nalgorithm enables the camera to explore space more efficiently by adapting the\nsearch policy from learning the environment. With the aid of an image averaging\ntechnique, this algorithm, in use of a solo camera, achieves the observation\naccuracy in eye-to-hand configurations to a desirable extent without filtering\nout high-frequency information in the original image. An automated\nmanufacturing application has been simulated and the results show the success\nof this algorithm's improvement of observation precision with limited energy.",

Our approach replaces the standard\ndependence on an external classical time parameter with a spacetime-symmetric\nalgebraic structure, thereby unifying the axioms that traditionally distinguish\nthe treatment of spacelike and timelike separations. Standard quantum evolution\ncan be recovered from timelike correlators, defined by means of a quantum\naction operator, a quantum version of the action of classical mechanics. The\ncorresponding map also provides a novel perspective on the path integral (PI)\nformulation, which, in the case of fermions, yields an alternative to the use\nof Grassmann variables. In addition, the formalism can be interpreted in terms\nof generalized quantum states, codifying both the conventional information of a\nquantum system at a given time and its evolution. We show that these states are\nsolutions to a quantum principle of stationary action enabled by the novel\nnotion of timelike correlations.",

We had eight LLMs make 4,800 veracity judgments across\nseveral prompts, comparing reasoning and non-reasoning models. We find that\nrates of truth-bias, or the likelihood to believe a statement is true,\nregardless of whether it is actually true, are lower in reasoning models than\nin non-reasoning models, but still higher than human benchmarks. Most\nconcerning, we identify sycophantic tendencies in several advanced models\n(o4-mini and GPT-4.1 from OpenAI, R1 from DeepSeek), which displayed an\nasymmetry in detection accuracy, performing well in truth accuracy but poorly\nin deception accuracy. This suggests that capability advances alone do not\nresolve fundamental veracity detection challenges in LLMs.",

These modes are defined along two key dimensions: the level of\ntechnical autonomy exhibited by the AI system (i.e., its ability to operate\nindependently and make decisions without human intervention), and the degree of\nperceived agency attributed to it (i.e., the extent to which the AI is\nexperienced as an intentional or creative partner).
