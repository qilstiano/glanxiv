    "abstract": "This study systematically investigates the effect of stretching boundary\nconditions, ranging from conservation of cross-sectional area to conservation\nof volume, on the rupture behavior of phantom star polymer networks using\nenergy-minimizing coarse-grained molecular simulations. By continuously varying\nthe deformation parameter, the simulations reveal that true stress and rupture\ncharacteristics, such as strain and stress at break and work for rupture,\nsystematically decrease as the boundary condition approaches cross-sectional\narea conservation. In contrast, nominal stress and the corresponding rupture\ncharacteristics exhibit near-independence from boundary conditions, indicating\nthat bond tension remains largely unaffected for phantom networks under the\nexamined conditions. These results clarify that volume expansion primarily\ndrives deviations in true stress and highlight a critical distinction between\ntrue and nominal stress-strain definitions. The difference between true and\nnominal stress-strain relations also affected the scaling exponent for strand\nlength dependence on stretch at break. The findings stress the importance of\nspecifying both deformation boundary conditions and stress-strain definitions\nin polymer network simulations for accurate interpretation of mechanical\nproperties.",

To\naddress these issues, I work at the cohort-period level and introduce the\n\\textit{block bias}-the parallel-trends violation for a cohort relative to its\nanchored initial control group-whose interpretation is consistent across pre-\nand post-treatment periods. For both the imputation estimator and the estimator\nin Callaway and Sant'Anna (2021) that uses not-yet-treated units as controls, I\nshow an invertible decomposition linking these estimators' biases in\npost-treatment periods to block biases. This allows researchers to place\ntransparent restrictions on block biases (e.g., Relative Magnitudes and Second\nDifferences) and conduct robust inference using the algorithm from Rambachan\nand Roth (2023). In simulations, when parallel-trends violations differ across\ncohorts, my framework yields better-centered (and sometimes narrower)\nconfidence sets than the aggregated approach. In a reanalysis of the effect of\nminimum-wage changes on teen employment in the Callaway and Sant'Anna (2021)\napplication, my inference framework with the Second Differences restriction\nyields confidence sets centered well below zero, indicating robust negative\neffects, whereas inference based on aggregated coefficients yields sets\ncentered near zero.

In this work,\nwe introduce the TSAIA Benchmark, a first attempt to evaluate LLMs as\ntime-series AI assistants. To ensure both scientific rigor and practical\nrelevance, we surveyed over 20 academic publications and identified 33\nreal-world task formulations.

The question generator is designed to be\ndynamic and extensible, supporting continuous expansion as new datasets or task\ntypes are introduced. Given the heterogeneous nature of the tasks, we adopt\ntask-specific success criteria and tailored inference-quality metrics to ensure\nmeaningful evaluation for each task. We apply this benchmark to assess eight\nstate-of-the-art LLMs under a unified evaluation protocol.

    "abstract": "Efficient scheduling of parallel computation resources across multiple jobs\nis a fundamental problem in modern cloud/edge computing systems for many\nAI-based applications. Allocating more resources to a job accelerates its\ncompletion, but with diminishing returns. Prior work (heSRPT) solved this\nproblem only for some specific speedup functions with an exponential form,\nproviding a closed-form solution. However, the general case with arbitrary\nconcave speedup functions -- which more accurately capture real-world workloads\n-- has remained open.\n  In this paper, we solve this open problem by developing optimal scheduling\nalgorithms for parallel jobs under general concave speedup functions. We first\ndiscover a fundamental and broadly-applicable rule for optimal parallel\nscheduling, namely the Consistent Derivative Ratio (CDR) Rule, which states\nthat the ratio of the derivatives of the speedup functions across active jobs\nremains constant over time. To efficiently compute the optimal allocations that\nsatisfy the CDR Rule, we propose the General Water-Filling (GWF) method, a more\ngeneral version of classical water-filling in wireless communications.\nCombining these insights, we design the SmartFill Algorithm to solve the\ngeneral scheduling problem. Unlike heSRPT, which always allocates resources to\nall active jobs, SmartFill selectively determines which jobs should receive\nresources and how much they should be allocated. For a broad class of so-called\n\\emph{regular} speedup functions, SmartFill yields closed-form optimal\nsolutions, while for non-regular functions it efficiently computes the optimum\nwith low complexity. Numerical evaluations show that SmartFill can\nsubstantially outperform heSRPT across a wide range of concave speedup\nfunctions.",

Bringing together our result with\npreviously known necessary conditions, we discover that, in the regime where\n$ds/p \\rightarrow +\\infty$, sparse recovery in the sparse setting exhibits a\nphase transition at an information-theoretic threshold of\n$n_{\\text{INF}}^{\\text{SP}} =\n\\Theta\\left(s\\log\\left(p/s\\right)/\\log\\left(ds/p\\right)\\right)$, where $p$\ndenotes the signal dimension, $s$ the number of non-zero components of the\nsignal, and $d$ the expected number of non-zero components per row of\nmeasurement.

An MTD is a Markov chain in\nwhich the transition probabilities are expressed as a convex combination of\nlower-order conditional distributions. Despite their generality, inference for\nMTD models has traditionally been limited by the need to estimate\nhigh-dimensional joint distributions. In particular, for a sample of size n,\nthe feasible order d of the MTD is typically restricted to d approximately\nO(log n). To overcome this limitation, Ost and Takahashi (2023) recently\nintroduced a computationally efficient non-parametric inference method that\nidentifies the relevant lags in high-order MTD models, even when d is\napproximately O(n), provided that the set of relevant lags is sparse. In this\narticle, we introduce hdMTD, an R package allowing us to estimate parameters of\nsuch high-dimensional Markovian models. Given a sample from an MTD chain, hdMTD\ncan retrieve the relevant past set using the BIC algorithm or the forward\nstepwise and cut algorithm described in Ost and Takahashi (2023). The package\nalso computes the maximum likelihood estimate for transition probabilities and\nestimates high-order MTD parameters through the expectation-maximization\nalgorithm. Additionally, hdMTD also allows for simulating an MTD chain from its\nstationary invariant distribution using the perfect (exact) sampling algorithm,\nenabling Monte Carlo simulation of the model. We illustrate the package's\ncapabilities through simulated data and a real-world application involving\ntemperature records from Brazil.",

This phenomenon can be identified with a spatial\nlearning process by the walker. Here we study theoretically and numerically how\nthe decay of memory impacts learning in these models. If memory decays as\n$1/\\tau$ or slower, where $\\tau$ is the time backward into the past, the\nlocalized solutions are the same as with perfect, non-decaying memory and they\nare linearly stable. If forgetting is faster than $1/\\tau$, for instance\nexponential, an unusual regime of intermittent localization is observed, where\nwell localized periods of exponentially distributed duration are interspersed\nwith intervals of diffusive motion. At the transition between the two regimes,\nfor a kernel in $1/\\tau$, the approach to the stable localized state is the\nfastest, opposite to the expected critical slowing down effect. Hence\nforgetting can allow the walker to save memory without compromising learning\nand to achieve a faster learning. These findings agree with biological evidence\non the benefits of forgetting.",

We ask whether the\nAlexander--Conway polynomial together with different types of quandle\ninvariants suffice. We show that the conjugation quandle of the dihedral group\n$D_5$, together with the Alexander--Conway polynomial, does distinguish the two\nlinks and hence likely does detect causality in $X$. The $2$-sky link shares\nthe same Alexander--Conway polynomial but has different $D_5$\nconjugation-quandle counting invariants. Moreover, for $D_5$ the counting\ninvariant alone already separates the pair, whereas for other small dihedral\ngroups $D_3$, $D_4$, $D_6$, $D_7$ even the enhanced counting polynomial fails\nto detect causality. In fact we prove more that the conjugation quandle over D5\ndistinguishes all the infinitely many Allen-Swenberg links from the connected\nsum of two Hopf links. These results present an interesting reality where only\nthe conjugation quandle over $D_5$ coupled with the Alexander--Conway\npolynomial can detect causality in $(2+1)$ dimensions.

    "abstract": "Reservoir computing (RC) is a state-of-the-art machine learning method that\nmakes use of the power of dynamical systems (the reservoir) for real-time\ninference. When using biological complex systems as reservoir substrates, it\nserves as a testbed for basic questions about bio-inspired computation -- of\nhow self-organization generates proper spatiotemporal patterning. Here, we use\na simulation of an active matter system, driven by a chaotically moving input\nsignal, as a reservoir. So far, it has been unclear whether such complex\nsystems possess the capacity to process information efficiently and\nindependently of the method by which it was introduced. We find that when\nswitching from a repulsive to an attractive driving force, the system\ncompletely changes the way it computes, while the predictive performance\nlandscapes remain nearly identical. The nonlinearity of the driver's injection\nforce improves computation by decoupling the single-agent dynamics from that of\nthe driver. Triggered are the (re-)growth, deformation, and active motion of\nsmooth structural boundaries (interfaces), and the emergence of coherent\ngradients in speed -- features found in many soft materials and biological\nsystems. The nonlinear driving force activates emergent regulatory mechanisms,\nwhich manifest enhanced morphological and dynamic diversity -- arguably\nimproving fading memory, nonlinearity, expressivity, and thus, performance. We\nfurther perform RC in a broad variety of non-equilibrium active matter phases\nthat arise when tuning internal (repulsive) forces for information transfer.\nOverall, we find that active matter agents forming liquid droplets are\nparticularly well suited for RC. The consistently convex shape of the\npredictive performance landscapes, together with the observed phenomenological\nrichness, conveys robustness and adaptivity.",

    "abstract": "We study the decomposition of the Wick powers of the continuum GFF in\ndimension $2$ via the first passage sets (FPS) and the excursion clusters (sign\ncomponents) of the GFF. These sets are non-thin for the GFF, that is to say the\nfield has non-trivial restriction to such a set, which is a measure, negative\nor positive depending on the sign. In this work we show that all the odd Wick\npowers of the GFF can be restricted to the FPS and the excursion clusters, and\nthe restrictions are generalized functions supported on these fractal sets. By\ncontrast, the restriction of an even Wick power to an FPS or excursion cluster\nis diverging, and to get something converging an additional compensation is\nrequired, which is provided by a smooth function living outside of the set and\nblowing up in a non-integrable way when approaching the set. We further provide\nexpressions of restricted odd Wick powers and restricted-compensated even Wick\npowers as limits of functions living outside the FPS/excursion cluster.\n  Then, we study the $\\varepsilon$-neighborhoods, in the sense of conformal\nradius, of first passage sets and excursion clusters. We show that such\n$\\varepsilon$-neighborhoods admit asymptotic expansions in $L^2$ into\nhalf-integer powers $\\vert\\log \\varepsilon\\vert^{-(n+1/2)}$, $n\\in\\mathbb{N}$,\nof $1/\\vert\\log \\varepsilon\\vert$. The coefficients of the expansion involve\nthe restrictions of the odd Wick powers. By contrast, the even Wick powers do\nnot appear in the expansion. Our expansion is reminiscent of Le Gall's\nexpansion for the Wiener sausage in dimension 2, with however some important\ndifferences. The most important one is that the powers of $1/\\vert\\log\n\\varepsilon\\vert$ are different. In the case of the Wiener sausage the powers\nare integer, $\\vert\\log \\varepsilon\\vert^{-n}$, $n\\in\\mathbb{N}\\setminus\n\\{0\\}$.",

    "abstract": "The UV-optical dust attenuation curve is key to interpreting the intrinsic\nproperties of galaxies and provides insights into the nature of dust grains and\ntheir geometry relative to stars. In this work, we constrain the UV-optical\nslope of the stellar attenuation curve using a spectroscopic-redshift sample of\n~3300 galaxies at z~1-9, to characterize the diversity and redshift evolution\nof stellar attenuation curves and to gain insight into dust production and\nevolution at high redshifts. The sample is constructed from three JWST/NIRCam\ngrism surveys in GOODS and A2744 fields, with a wealth of JWST/NIRCam and HST\nphotometry. With constraints from spectroscopic redshifts and emission line\nfluxes, we use the Prospector SED fitting code with a flexible dust model. We\nfind that the attenuation curve slope varies strongly with Av at all redshifts,\nbecoming flatter at higher attenuation. We find no strong correlation between\nattenuation curve slope and size or axis ratio, and the trends with stellar\nmass and star-formation rate are largely driven by their correlation with Av.\nWe find strong evidence that at fixed Av, the curve becomes flatter with\nincreasing redshift. On average, the attenuation curves derived here are\nshallower than those at z~0 and than the SMC curve. The highest redshift\ngalaxies at z=7-9 (124 galaxies, a significantly larger sample than in previous\nstudies) show slopes even flatter than the Calzetti curve, implying reduced UV\nobscuration and lower IR luminosities than expected from an SMC dust curve, by\nas large as an order of magnitude. Hydrodynamical simulations that couple dust\ngrowth to gas chemical enrichment successfully reproduce the different loci of\nhigh- and low-redshift galaxies in the slope-Av diagram, suggesting that dust\nin high-redshift galaxies is increasingly dominated by large grains produced in\nsupernova ejecta with limited ISM processing at early times.",

First, we focus on the\nbenchmark datasets that have been used to assess the methods proposed in\nresearch. We find that most prior work relied on datasets containing emails\nthat -- we argue -- are not representative of current trends, and mostly\nencompass the English language. Based on this finding, we then re-implement and\nre-assess a variety of detection methods reliant on machine learning (ML),\nincluding large-language models (LLM), and release all of our codebase -- an\n(unfortunately) uncommon practice in related research. We show that most such\nmethods achieve near-perfect performance when trained and tested on the same\ndataset -- a result which intrinsically hinders development (how can future\nresearch outperform methods that are already near perfect?). To foster the\ncreation of \"more challenging benchmarks\" that reflect current phishing trends,\nwe propose E-PhishGEN, an LLM-based (and privacy-savvy) framework to generate\nnovel phishing-email datasets. We use our E-PhishGEN to create E-PhishLLM, a\nnovel phishing-email detection dataset containing 16616 emails in three\nlanguages. We use E-PhishLLM to test the detectors we considered, showing a\nmuch lower performance than that achieved on existing benchmarks -- indicating\na larger room for improvement.

To answer this\nquestion, we systematically evaluate 7 LLMs (e.g., GPT and Gemini family)\nacross 6 benchmarks, including both multiple-choice and open-ended tasks on 12\ndiverse prompt templates.

When we adopt\nLLM-as-a-Judge evaluations, we observe a substantial reduction in performance\nvariance and a consistently higher correlation in model rankings across\nprompts.

First, we quantify the\nagreement of target displacement from VCs computed via Jacobians of the shape\nemulators with those from finite differences Jacobians on exact Grad-Shafranov\nsolutions. Good agreement ($\\approx$5-10%) can be achieved on a selection of\ngeometric targets using combinations of neural network emulators with\n$\\approx10^5$ parameters.

Second, we address the effect of vessel\ncurrents that are not directly measured in real-time and are typically subsumed\ninto effective \"shaping currents\" when designing virtual circuits. We\ndemonstrate that shaping currents can be inferred via simple linear regression\non a trailing window of active coil current measurements with residuals of only\na few Amp\\`eres, enabling a choice for the most appropriate shaping currents at\nany point in a shot.

    "abstract": "In many materials, ordered phases and their order parameters are easily\ncharacterized by standard experimental methods. \"Hidden order\" refers to a\nphase transition in which an ordered state emerges without such an easily\ndetectable order parameter, despite clear thermodynamic evidence of the\ntransition. The underlying mechanisms for these unconventional states of matter\nstem from spin-orbit coupling, which intertwines inter-site exchange, classical\nelectron-magnetic interactions, and electron-lattice effects. This physics is\nelusive to experimental probes and beyond traditional theories of insulating\nmagnetism, requiring sophisticated methodologies for its exploration. In this\nReview, we survey exotic hidden-order phases in correlated insulators,\nparticularly focusing on the latest progress in material-specific theories and\nnumerical approaches. The relevant degrees of freedom in these phases are local\nhigh-rank multipole moments of magnetic and charge density that emerge from\nspin-orbit entangled correlated shells of heavy d and f electron ions and\ninteract on the lattice via various mechanisms. We discuss approaches to\nmodelling hidden orders in realistic systems via direct ab initio calculations\nor by constructing low-energy many-body effective Hamiltonian. We also describe\nhow these new theoretical tools have helped to uncover driving mechanisms for\nrecently discovered multipolar phases in double perovskites of heavy transition\nmetals, and how they have proved instrumental in disentangling the role of\nvarious interactions in \"traditional\" f-electron multipolar materials like\nactinide dioxides. In both cases, material-specific theories have played a key\nrole in interpreting and predicting experimental signatures of hidden orders.",

Through\napplications to modern prenatal care, a longitudinal toenail infection trial,\nand clustered health count data, we show that GCR not only achieves superior\npredictive performance over standard methods, but also reveals family-,\ncommunity-, and individual-level drivers of dependence that are obscured under\nconventional modeling. These results demonstrate the broad applied value of GCR\nfor analyzing binary, count, and categorical data in clustered and longitudinal\nsettings.",

    "abstract": "Pre-trained language models (PLMs) have substantially advanced natural\nlanguage processing by providing context-sensitive text representations.\nHowever, the Algerian dialect remains under-represented, with few dedicated\nmodels available. Processing this dialect is challenging due to its complex\nmorphology, frequent code-switching, multiple scripts, and strong lexical\ninfluences from other languages. These characteristics complicate tokenization\nand reduce the effectiveness of conventional word- or subword-level approaches.\n  To address this gap, we introduce chDzDT, a character-level pre-trained\nlanguage model tailored for Algerian morphology. Unlike conventional PLMs that\nrely on token sequences, chDzDT is trained on isolated words. This design\nallows the model to encode morphological patterns robustly, without depending\non token boundaries or standardized orthography. The training corpus draws from\ndiverse sources, including YouTube comments, French, English, and Berber\nWikipedia, as well as the Tatoeba project. It covers multiple scripts and\nlinguistic varieties, resulting in a substantial pre-training workload.\n  Our contributions are threefold: (i) a detailed morphological analysis of\nAlgerian dialect using YouTube comments; (ii) the construction of a\nmultilingual Algerian lexicon dataset; and (iii) the development and extensive\nevaluation of a character-level PLM as a morphology-focused encoder for\ndownstream tasks.

Key\nparameters include cathode electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) and\ncatalyst layer thickness.

In contrast, a tenfold decrease in\nECSA results increases the FE to C2H4 by 7% but leads increase cell voltage at\na given current density by 150 mV. This tradeoff occurs because the potential\ndistribution within the cathode catalyst layer is the primary driving force for\nC2H4 formation. Increased cell voltage also raises the energy cost of C2H4\nproduction. This model framework enables techno-economic assessments and\nidentifies key factors that must be optimized to enable economically viable\nproduction of C2H4 via electrochemical reduction of CO2.",

We show\nthat the neural response to visual motion depends on contrast, and this\ndependence itself varies with context. Using the spike-triggered average\nvelocity trajectory as a response measure, we find that context dependence is\nconfined to a low-dimensional space, with a single dominant dimension. Across a\nwide range of conditions this adaptation serves to match the integration time\nto the mean interval between spikes, reducing redundancy.",

Using\nlarge-scale simulations, we map out transitions between tightly coiled spirals\nand extended, flagella-like beating, controlled by pivot position, motor\nactivity, and processivity. Spiral formation is characterized by bimodal\nturning number distributions and is stabilized by a balance between\nmotor-driven activity and filament bending rigidity, with intermediate\nstiffness promoting robust spirals.

Yet in many applications it\nis unrealistic that no change occurs at all, or that after one change the time\nseries remains stationary forever. We introduce a new setup, modeling the\nsequence of means as a piecewise constant function with arbitrarily many\nchanges. Instead of testing for a change, we ask whether the evolving sequence\nof means, say $(\\mu_n)_{n \\geq 1}$, stays within a narrow corridor around its\ninitial value, that is, $\\mu_n \\in [\\mu_1-\\Delta, \\mu_1+\\Delta]$ for all $n \\ge\n1$.

To address the ill-posedness of LACT\nreconstruction, we propose a two-stage diffusion framework guided by structured\nclinical metadata. In the first stage, a transformer-based diffusion model\nconditioned exclusively on metadata, including acquisition parameters, patient\ndemographics, and diagnostic impressions, generates coarse anatomical priors\nfrom noise. The second stage further refines the images by integrating both the\ncoarse prior and metadata to produce high-fidelity results. Physics-based data\nconsistency is enforced at each sampling step in both stages using an\nAlternating Direction Method of Multipliers module, ensuring alignment with the\nmeasured projections. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real cardiac\nCT datasets demonstrate that incorporating metadata significantly improves\nreconstruction fidelity, particularly under severe angular truncation. Compared\nto existing metadata-free baselines, our method achieves superior performance\nin SSIM, PSNR, nMI, and PCC. Ablation studies confirm that different types of\nmetadata contribute complementary benefits, particularly diagnostic and\ndemographic priors under limited-angle conditions.

Unlike conventional data-driven models, our approach provides explicit\ncontrol over meaningful shape features (e.g., volatility level, slope,\ncurvature, term-structure) to generate IVSs with desired characteristics. In\nour framework, financially interpretable shape features are disentangled from\nresidual latent factors. The target features are embedded into the VAE\narchitecture as controllable latent variables, while the residual latent\nvariables capture additional structure to preserve IVS shape diversity. To\nenable this control, IVS feature values are quantified via regression at an\nanchor point and incorporated into the decoder to steer generation. Numerical\nexperiments demonstrate that the generative model enables rapid generation of\nrealistic IVSs with desired features rather than arbitrary patterns, and\nachieves high accuracy across both single- and multi-feature control settings.\nFor market validity, an optional post-generation latent-space repair algorithm\nadjusts only the residual latent variables to remove occasional violations of\nstatic no-arbitrage conditions without altering the specified features.\nCompared with black-box generators, the framework combines interpretability,\ncontrollability, and flexibility for synthetic IVS generation and scenario\ndesign.",

Oblivious\nMaps (OMAPs) mitigate this by fully hiding access patterns but suffer from high\noverhead due to randomized remapping and worst-case padding. We argue these\ncosts are not fundamental. Modern accelerators featuring High-Bandwidth Memory\n(HBM) offer a new opportunity: Vaswani et al. [OSDI'18] point out that\neavesdropping on HBM is difficult -- even for physical attackers -- as its\nmemory channels are sealed together with processor cores inside the same\nphysical package. Later, Hunt et al. [NSDI'20] show that, with proper\nisolation, HBM can be turned into an unobservable region where both data and\nmemory traces are hidden. This motivates a rethink of OMAP design with\nHBM-backed solutions to finally overcome their traditional performance limits.\nBuilding on these insights, we present BOLT, a Bandwidth Optimized,\nLightning-fast OMAP accelerator that, for the first time, achieves O(1) +\nO(log_2(log_2 (N))) bandwidth overhead. BOLT introduces three key innovations:\n(i) a new OMAP algorithm that leverages isolated HBM as an unobservable cache\nto accelerate oblivious access to large host memory; (ii) a self-hosted\narchitecture that offloads execution and memory control from the host to\nmitigate CPU-side leakage; and (iii) tailored algorithm-architecture co-designs\nthat maximize resource efficiency. We implement a prototype BOLT on a Xilinx\nU55C FPGA. Evaluations show that BOLT achieves up to 279x and 480x speedups in\ninitialization and query time, respectively, over state-of-the-art OMAPs,\nincluding an industry implementation from Facebook.",

NGC 4485 and\nNGC 4490 form the closest known pair of interacting late-type dwarf galaxies\n(at $\\sim 7.4$ Mpc), excluding the Magellanic Clouds. Near-infrared\ncolor-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) reveal a wide range of stellar populations in\nboth galaxies, including young ($\\lesssim 200$ Myr) upper main sequence stars,\ncore helium-burning stars, and oxygen-rich asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars.\nWe also identify intermediate-age ($\\sim 200$ Myr -- $1$ Gyr) carbon-rich AGB\nstars and a well-populated old ($\\gtrsim 1$ Gyr) red giant branch (RGB). The\nCMDs show two distinct bursts of star formation beginning $\\sim 30$ Myr and\n$\\sim 200$ Myr ago, the latter consistent with the most recent pericenter\npassage predicted by N-body simulations.

However, to store\nmany optimal trade-offs (the Pareto optima) at once, MOEAs are typically run\nwith a large, static population of solution candidates, which can slow down the\nalgorithm. We propose the dynamic NSGA-II (dNSGA-II), which is based on the\npopular NSGA-II and features a non-static population size. The dNSGA-II starts\nwith a small initial population size of four and doubles it after a\nuser-specified number $\\tau$ of function evaluations, up to a maximum size of\n$\\mu$.

For an optimal choice of $\\mu$ and $\\tau$, the resulting\n$O(n \\log(n))$ runtime improves the optimal expected runtime of the classic\nNSGA-II by a factor of $\\Theta(n)$. In addition, we show that the parameter\n$\\tau$ can be removed when utilizing concurrent runs of the dNSGA-II. This\napproach leads to a mild slow-down by a factor of $O(\\log(n))$ compared to an\noptimal choice of $\\tau$ for the dNSGA-II, which is still a speed-up of\n$\\Theta(n / \\log(n))$ over the classic NSGA-II.",

    "abstract": "We introduce in this paper an extension of the meta-analytic (MA) framework\nfor evaluating surrogate endpoints. While the MA framework is regarded as the\ngold standard for surrogate endpoint evaluation, it is limited in its ability\nto handle complex surrogates and does not take into account possible\ndifferences in the distribution of baseline covariates across trials. By\ncontrast, in the context of data fusion, the surrogate-index (SI) framework\naccommodates complex surrogates and allows for complex relationships between\nbaseline covariates, surrogates, and clinical endpoints. However, the SI\nframework is not a surrogate evaluation framework and relies on strong\nidentifying assumptions. To address the MA framework's limitations, we propose\nan extension that incorporates ideas from the SI framework. We first formalize\nthe data-generating mechanism underlying the MA framework, providing a\ntransparent description of the untestable assumptions required for valid\ninferences in any evaluation of trial-level surrogacy -- assumptions often left\nimplicit in the MA framework. While this formalization is meaningful in its own\nright, it is also required for our main contribution: We propose to estimate a\nspecific transformation of the baseline covariates and the surrogate, the\nso-called surrogate index. This estimated transformation serves as a new\npotential univariate surrogate and is optimal in a trial-level surrogacy sense\nunder certain conditions. We show that, under weak additional conditions, this\nnew univariate surrogate can be evaluated as a trial-level surrogate as if the\ntransformation were known a priori. This approach enables the evaluation of the\ntrial-level surrogacy of complex surrogates and can be implemented using\nstandard software. We illustrate this approach with a set of COVID-19 vaccine\ntrials where antibody markers are assessed as potential trial-level surrogate\nendpoints.",

    "abstract": "Quantum computing threatens to undermine classical cryptography by breaking\nwidely deployed encryption and signature schemes. This paper examines\nenterprise readiness for quantum-safe cybersecurity through three perspectives:\n(i) the technologist view, assessing the maturity of post-quantum cryptography\n(PQC) and quantum key distribution (QKD); (ii) the enterprise (CISO/CIO) view,\nanalyzing organizational awareness, risk management, and operational barriers;\nand (iii) the threat actor view, evaluating the evolving quantum threat and the\nurgency of migration. Using recent standards (e.g., NIST's 2024 PQC\nalgorithms), industry surveys, and threat intelligence, we synthesize findings\nvia a SWOT analysis to map strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats.\nResults indicate uneven and generally insufficient preparedness: while PQC\nstandards and niche QKD deployments signal technical progress, fewer than 5\\%\nof enterprises have formal quantum-transition plans, and many underestimate\n\"harvest now, decrypt later\" risks. Financial, telecom, and government sectors\nhave begun migration, but most industries remain exploratory or stalled by\ncosts, complexity, and skills gaps. Expert consensus places cryptanalytically\nrelevant quantum computers in the 2030s, yet delayed preparation could leave\ntoday's data vulnerable for decades. We recommend immediate steps: establishing\ncrypto-agility, creating quantum transition roadmaps, prioritizing PQC\ndeployment in high-value systems, and upskilling cybersecurity teams. A\ncoordinated, proactive approach is essential to secure current and future\ndigital assets in the quantum era.",

    "abstract": "Biases in machine learning pose significant challenges, particularly when\nmodels amplify disparities that affect disadvantaged groups. Traditional bias\nmitigation techniques often lead to a {\\itshape leveling-down effect}, whereby\nimproving outcomes of disadvantaged groups comes at the expense of reduced\nperformance for advantaged groups. This study introduces Bias Mitigation\nthrough Continual Learning (BM-CL), a novel framework that leverages the\nprinciples of continual learning to address this trade-off. We postulate that\nmitigating bias is conceptually similar to domain-incremental continual\nlearning, where the model must adjust to changing fairness conditions,\nimproving outcomes for disadvantaged groups without forgetting the knowledge\nthat benefits advantaged groups. Drawing inspiration from techniques such as\nLearning without Forgetting and Elastic Weight Consolidation, we reinterpret\nbias mitigation as a continual learning problem. This perspective allows models\nto incrementally balance fairness objectives, enhancing outcomes for\ndisadvantaged groups while preserving performance for advantaged groups.\nExperiments on synthetic and real-world image datasets, characterized by\ndiverse sources of bias, demonstrate that the proposed framework mitigates\nbiases while minimizing the loss of original knowledge. Our approach bridges\nthe fields of fairness and continual learning, offering a promising pathway for\ndeveloping machine learning systems that are both equitable and effective.",

Building on prior DA\nsuccess in the QG channel regime, where stochastic corrections based on EOFs\nwere effective, we show that this method fails to address persistent errors in\nthe more complex, dynamically richer Gulf Stream setting.To overcome this, we\nemploy a hybrid model that controls energy at selected scales, maintaining\ndynamic consistency and physical realism. We evaluate the combined effect of\nhybrid modeling and DA, using a particle filter which combines model reduction,\ntempering, jittering, and nudging.\n  Numerical experiments show that the hybrid model reproduces both the\nlarge-scale jet and small-scale vortices seen in high-resolution reference\nsimulations, but missing in the standard (non-hybrid) QG model. When DA is\nincorporated, the hybrid model further reduces tracking error and ensemble\ndivergence. Moreover, targeted assimilation from the most energetic region\nmatches tracking error and uncertainty reduction of full-domain networks,\nhighlighting the critical importance of observation network design.

    "abstract": "In quantum field theory, photon pairs can be excited out of the vacuum under\nthe influence of dynamical gravitational fields. If the classical\nelectromagnetic duality symmetry held at the quantum level, equal numbers of\nright- vs left-handed modes would be excited. However, a quantum chiral-like\nanomaly is known to affect this symmetry. In this work, we explore more\nexperimentally accessible manifestations of this anomaly in analogue-gravity\nsystems. Specifically, we describe the physical mechanism by which rotating,\naccelerating waveguides can induce an imbalance between right- and left-handed\nphotons excited from the vacuum -- effectively signaling the emergence of the\nelectromagnetic duality anomaly in controlled laboratory settings. To build\nphysical intuition, we review first the Adler-Bell-Jackiw anomaly in 1+1\ndimensions, which elegantly illustrates the connection between asymmetric\nparticle pair creation and chiral anomalies.",

The primary goal is to\novercome limitations inherent in conventional solutions such as TPA,\nBlockchain, ECDSA and ZSS which often fall short in terms of data protection,\ncomputational efficiency and scalability. Our proposed method strategically\nrefines and integrates these technologies to address their shortcomings while\nmaximizing their individual strengths.

The model leverages the combined potential of emerging\ntechnologies, particularly Blockchain, IoT and Cloud computing which when\neffectively coordinated offer significant advancements in security\narchitecture. The proposed framework consists of three core layers: (1) the\nH.E.EZ Layer which integrates improved versions of Hyperledger Fabric,\nEnc-Block and a hybrid ECDSA-ZSS scheme to improve encryption speed,\nscalability and reduce computational cost; (2) the Credential Management Layer\nindependently verifying data integrity and authenticity; and (3) the Time and\nAuditing Layer designed to reduce traffic overhead and optimize performance\nacross dynamic workloads.

Moreover, the history of mass assembly for the most\nmassive galaxies in the sample can be described with only one episode of star\nformation in the early Universe, which we detected as an exponential decrease\nthat was longer in duration than subsequent SF events.

    "abstract": "Interval censoring occurs when event times are only known to fall between\nscheduled assessments, a common design in clinical trials, epidemiology, and\nreliability studies. Standard right-censoring methods, such as Kaplan-Meier and\nCox regression, are not directly applicable and can produce biased results.\nThis study compares three complementary approaches for interval-censored\nsurvival data. First, the Turnbull nonparametric maximum likelihood estimator\n(NPMLE) via the EM algorithm recovers the survival distribution without strong\nassumptions. Second, Weibull and log-normal accelerated failure time (AFT)\nmodels with interval likelihoods provide smooth, covariate-adjusted survival\ncurves and interpretable time-ratio effects. Third, Bayesian AFT models extend\nthese tools by quantifying posterior uncertainty, incorporating prior\ninformation, and enabling interval-aware model comparisons via PSIS-LOO\ncross-validation. Simulations across generating distributions, censoring\nintensities, sample sizes, and covariate structures evaluated the integrated\nsquared error (ISE) for curve recovery, integrated Brier score (IBS) for\nprediction, and coverage for uncertainty calibration. Results show that the EM\nachieves the lowest ISE for distribution recovery, AFT models improve\npredictive performance when families are correctly specified, and Bayesian AFT\noffers calibrated uncertainty and principled model selection. An application to\nthe ovarian cancer dataset, restructured into interval-censored form,\ndemonstrates the workflow in practice: the EM algorithm reveals the baseline\nshape, parametric AFT provides covariate-adjusted predictions, and Bayesian AFT\nvalidates model adequacy through posterior predictive checks. Together, these\nmethods form a tiered strategy: EM for shape discovery, AFT for\ncovariate-driven prediction, and Bayesian AFT for complete uncertainty\nquantification and model comparison.",

Traditional\nreactive communication paradigms are ill-suited to these environments, as they\nfail to leverage the network's inherent predictability.

The approach is enabled by\nfusing predictable mission trajectories with stable, large-scale radio\nenvironment models (e.g., radio maps). Specifically, we present a hierarchical\nframework that decomposes the predictive cross-layer resource allocation\nproblem into three layers: strategic (routing), tactical (timing), and\noperational (power). This structure aligns decision-making timescales with the\naccuracy levels and ranges of available predictive information.

AmphiKey offers two\ndistinct operational modes within a single framework: an Authenticated Mode and\na Deniable Mode. The Authenticated Mode employs a blackbox approach, combining\nephemeral ML-KEM-768 and X25519 with long-term Raccoon DSA keys to provide\nforward secrecy and strong, non-repudiable authenticity. This design achieves\n\"OR\" confidentiality, where security holds if either of the KEMs is unbroken,\nand robust \"AND\" authenticity. For the signature operation, it leverages the\n'masking-friendly' Raccoon digital signature (DSA), which is specifically\ndesigned for side-channel attack resistance, though this protection is\nlocalized to the signing key and does not provide deniability. In contrast,\nDeniable Mode provides deniable authentication, preserving privacy. The\nprotocol used ML-KEM-768 (AKEM-1), Ephemeral X25519 (AKEM-2), Raccoon-based DSA\n(Rac) (compared performance to ML-DSA-65), and the Ascon cipher to deliver its\nsecurity guarantees. Key contributions include providing a flexible protocol\nwith enhanced security, optional deniability, and efficiency adapted to the\ndiverse needs of the smart grid infrastructure. We present a comprehensive\nperformance evaluation on a heterogeneous testbed featuring a powerful server\nand client (AMD Ryzen 5) and a resource-constrained client (Raspberry Pi). In\nefficient Deniable mode, the full handshake completes in 0.15 ms on the server\nand 0.41 ms on the Raspberry Pi client.

The temporal dynamics of superradiance can be tuned\nvia external experimental parameters, unlike those of spontaneous emission.\nIncorporating superradiance into quantum state engineering could therefore\nprovide more accessible control over quantum systems. Motivated by this, we\npresent a theoretical model for an ensemble of atoms in a V - type three -\nlevel configuration. Our numerical data are analyzed against key superradiance\ncharacteristics. The system successively emits a pair of superradiance pulses,\neffectively synthesizing the dynamically decoupled sub - ensembles into a\nsingle macroscopic ensemble involving all atoms.

A prominent example is the distribution of commercial activities and\nother Points of Interest (POIs) across cities. However, the mechanisms by which\nsuch heavy-tailed behaviors emerge from local urban dynamics remain poorly\nunderstood. In this work, we demonstrate that global inhomogeneity in the\nspatial distribution of POIs can arise from the aggregation of locally\nhomogeneous processes.\n  Using Foursquare data from the city of Bologna, we show that POI\ndistributions exhibit clear power-law scaling when analyzed at city scale. We\ndevelop a theoretical framework in which this behavior naturally emerges from\nspatial clusters defined by shared intensity levels across disjoint areas,\nrather than spatial contiguity. By analytically and empirically linking these\nlocal processes to the observed global distribution, we provide a generative\nexplanation for the emergence of scale-free patterns in urban commercial\nstructure.\n  To further relax the assumptions underlying the purely spatial model, and to\naccount for the empirical observation that areas with similar activity\nintensity can be spatially disjoint, we introduce a hybrid hierarchical\napproach that combines spatial clustering with statistical heterogeneity across\nregions of comparable density, modeled via Poisson mixtures. This enables us to\ncapture real-world deviations from local regularity while preserving\ninterpretability.\n  Our findings highlight a key insight: complex global phenomena in cities can\narise from the spatial superposition of simple, locally uniform dynamics.

Conjugative plasmids are ubiquitous mobile\ngenetic elements that mediate such exchanges both within and between species.\nTherefore, predicting whether a plasmid can invade and be maintained by a\nmicrobial community is critical, for example when assessing the risks of\nantimicrobial resistance gene spread in commensal or environmental microbiomes.\nHowever, existing theory developed to assist such predictions has generally\nfocused on the balance among plasmid costs, benefits, and infection rates,\noverlooking other relevant factors such as the inherent dynamics and diversity\nof microbiomes. Here, we hypothesize that plasmid persistence in the absence of\npositive selection can arise purely from the heterogeneity present in large and\ndiverse microbial communities. We introduce a generic model that integrates\npopulation-level dynamics with plasmid conjugation. Using this model, we show\nthat we can predict plasmid maintenance, and that the probability for a plasmid\nto be maintained depends on traits of the plasmid, most importantly the\nconjugation rate, and the species abundance distribution of the community.\nThen, using both empirical abundance data and extensive numerical simulations,\nwe demonstrate that the inherent randomness of ecological interactions and\nconjugation rates enables plasmid persistence -- even in the absence of\npositive selection.

    "abstract": "Satellite kinematics offers a powerful method to infer dynamical halo masses\nand has been demonstrated to yield tight constraints on the galaxy-halo\nconnection. However, previous studies have assumed that the halos in which the\nsatellites orbit are composed solely of dark matter, neglecting the role of\nbaryons. Here, we develop an analytical model incorporating stars, gas, and the\nadiabatic response of dark matter to assess the impact of baryonic effects on\nthe inference from satellite kinematics. The model covers halos in the mass\nrange $10^{12}-10^{15}M_\\odot$ and is tuned to agree with well-established\nobservational scaling relations. In addition, the model uses simple functional\nforms for the mass fractions of ejected baryons and diffuse halo stars,\ncalibrated to the median trends in the EAGLE hydrodynamical simulations. We\nfind that baryonic effects mainly result in a reduction of the satellite\nline-of-sight velocity dispersion due to the ejection of baryons and the\nresulting response of the dark matter halo. The effect is minimal (less than\n1%) for the most massive halos, but reaches ~5-6% for halos in the mass range\n$10^{12}-10^{13}M_\\odot$, and up to 8% in extreme cases. We propose a simple\nformalism for correcting the satellite line-of-sight velocity dispersion for\nbaryonic effects, and for marginalizing over the uncertainties. We integrate\nthis correction function into BASILISK, a Bayesian hierarchical inference\nmethod applied to satellite kinematics data extracted from large redshift\nsurveys, and find that this shifts central galaxies to higher inferred halo\nmasses at fixed luminosity by up to ~0.3 dex. In a forthcoming work, we\ndemonstrate that these few-percent level baryonic effects can have a\nnon-negligible impact on the inference of cosmological parameters, motivating a\nnovel approach to constraining the efficiency of feedback processes associated\nwith galaxy formation.",

We\nrobustly characterise the 150 MHz activity CHIME-detected FRB sources relative\nto their 600 MHz activity -- using their non-detection in 473 h of archival\nobservations from the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) Tied-Array All-Sky Survey\n(LOTAAS), and 252 h of LOFAR observations of 14 repeating FRB sources, the\nlargest sub-300 MHz targeted FRB campaign to date.\n  In the LOTAAS data, we search for repeat bursts from 33 CHIME/FRB repeaters,\n10 candidate repeaters and 430 apparent non-repeaters. Their non-detection\nyields a population-level constraint on the statistical spectral index\n$\\alpha_{s, 150MHz/600MHz}>-0.9$, indicating that FRB spectral indices are, on\naverage, flatter than known spectral indices from pulsars. From the targeted\ncampaign, we find that the prolific repeater FRB 20201124A shows a positive\n$\\alpha_s>0.55$, implying reduced low-frequency activity, unlike the typically\nnegative $\\alpha_{s}$ seen from FRBs at higher frequency bands. We explore\nfree-free absorption in the circumburst environment as a cause of the\nnon-detection at 150 MHz. The non-detection of FRB 20201124A is consistent with\neither a very young $\\sim10$ yr old supernova remnant, or a typical HII region.\n  Our simulations indicate that LOFAR2.0 can detect 0.3-9 FRBs per week, and up\nto 4 FRBs at redshifts in the range $1<z<3$.

    "abstract": "Existing agents for solving tasks such as ML engineering rely on prompting\npowerful language models. As a result, these agents do not improve with more\nexperience. In this paper, we show that agents backed by weaker models that\nimprove via reinforcement learning (RL) can outperform agents backed by much\nlarger, but static models. We identify two major challenges with RL in this\nsetting. First, actions can take a variable amount of time (e.g., executing\ncode for different solutions), which leads to asynchronous policy gradient\nupdates that favor faster but suboptimal solutions. To tackle variable-duration\nactions, we propose duration-aware gradient updates in a distributed\nasynchronous RL framework to amplify high-cost but high-reward actions. Second,\nusing only test split performance as a reward provides limited feedback. A\nprogram that is nearly correct is treated the same as one that fails entirely.\nTo address this, we propose environment instrumentation to offer partial\ncredit, distinguishing almost-correct programs from those that fail early\n(e.g., during data loading). Environment instrumentation uses a separate static\nlanguage model to insert print statement to an existing program to log the\nagent's experimental progress, from which partial credit can be extracted as\nreward signals for learning. Our experimental results on MLEBench suggest that\nperforming gradient updates on a much smaller model (Qwen2.5-3B) trained with\nRL outperforms prompting a much larger model (Claude-3.5-Sonnet) with agent\nscaffolds, by an average of 22% across 12 Kaggle tasks.",

    "abstract": "Sine-dilaton gravity has been proposed as the holographic dual of the double\nscaled SYK (DSSYK) model. In this work, we examine this duality by deriving\ngeneral matter correlation functions directly from the bulk perspective. A\nnovel technique we develop is to treat matter lines in the bulk as\nend-of-the-world (EOW) branes, allowing us to implement a splitting and gluing\nprocedure on the bulk spacetime. This geometric procedure gives rise to the\nstructure of two-sided multi-particle wormhole Hilbert space. In contrast to\nprevious Hilbert space constructions in DSSYK, the length basis in our case\nfactorizes across the subregions, whereas the energy basis acquires a\nnon-local, state-dependent structure determined by the EOW brane quantization\nin each subregion. Different choices of splitting correspond to distinct\nrepresentations of the same Hilbert space, all of which are equivalent for\nphysical observables. Based on this framework, we compute general correlation\nfunctions, including the OTOC, and show that they exactly reproduce the DSSYK\nresults obtained from chord diagrams. By calculating the OTOC in different\nrepresentations, we uncover a new identity for the 6j-symbol of the quantum\ngroup $\\mathcal{U}_q(su(1,1))$.

    "abstract": "We present the first study of how dark matter environments influence\nnonlinear gravitational memory from intermediate-mass-ratio binaries.\nIncorporating dark matter effects-gravitational potential, dynamical friction,\nand accretion-we compute nonlinear memory for both bound and unbound orbits\nunder dark matter minispikes and Navarro-Frenk-White profiles. For\nquasi-circular orbits within a minispike profile, we further account\nempirically for the evolution of the dark matter density. Our findings reveal\nsignificant deviations from the vacuum case, with important implications for\nthe detectability of gravitational memory by future gravitational wave\nobservatories. These results underscore the role of astrophysical environments\nin shaping gravitational memory, strengthening its interpretation as a\nhereditary imprint of past binary evolution and providing a novel bridge\nbetween dark matter physics and memory effects.",

While much\nprogress has been made in the early days with Spitzer and Herschel, these\nfacilities have not reached the necessary depths to observe the mid-IR light of\nhigh-redshift (z > 3) galaxies. Recently, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)\nhas filled in the blue side of the rest-frame mid-IR. The Atacama Large\n(Sub)Millimeter Array (ALMA), on the other hand, provides excellent sensitivity\nin the far-IR regime, allowing the study of dust and gas properties at high\nredshifts. Filling the wavelength gap between JWST and ALMA is crucial to\nprogress our understanding of early galaxy evolution - and this will be an\nimportant goal in the next decades. The Probe far-IR Mission for Astrophysics\n(PRIMA), with sensitive imaging and spectroscopic capabilities at 24-240$\\mu$m\nand currently in Phase A study, will achieve this and provide insights into\nearly galaxy evolution, Black Hole growth, and dust production mechanisms.

    "abstract": "Within hierarchical triple stellar systems, there exists a tidal process\nunique to them, known as tertiary tides. In this process, the tidal deformation\nof a tertiary in a hierarchical triple drains energy from the inner binary,\ncausing the inner binary's orbit to shrink. Previous work has uncovered the\nrate at which tertiary tides drain energy from inner binaries, as a function of\norbital and tidal parameters, for hierarchical triples in which the orbits are\nall circular and coplanar. However, not all hierarchical triples have orbits\nwhich are circular and coplanar, which requires an understanding of what\nhappens when this condition is relaxed. In this paper, we study how\neccentricities affect tertiary tides, and their influence on the subsequent\ndynamical evolution of the host hierarchical triple. We find that\neccentricities in the outer orbit undergo tidal circularisation as quickly as\nbinary tidal synchronisation, and are therefore trivial, but that\neccentricities in the inner binary completely change the behaviour of tertiary\ntides, draining energy from the outer orbit as well as the inner orbit. As with\nthe circular orbit case, tertiary tides become significant when the tertiary is\nlarge enough to come close to filling its Roche Lobe, and dominate tidal\nevolution when interactions between the inner binary pair are weak. Empirical\nequations that approximate this behaviour are provided for ease of implementing\nthis process in other stellar evolution codes, and the implications of these\nresults are discussed.",

The fermion production efficiency\ndepends critically on the particle mass, which is generated via the Yukawa\ncoupling and sensitive to the corresponding scalar field value. During\ninflation, scalar fields experience large quantum fluctuations driving the\naverage field values to the Hubble scale and above. This applies, in\nparticular, to the Higgs field, making the Standard Model fermions very heavy\nand facilitating their production. Using the Bogolyubov coefficient approach,\nwe compute the corresponding fermion abundance taking into account time\ndependence of the mass term. We find that the Standard Model fermion and the\nright-handed neutrino production grows dramatically compared to the naive\nestimate based on the low energy masses. The inflationary production mechanism\ncan be the leading source of the right handed neutrinos, if they gain a\nMajorana mass from the Yukawa coupling to a light scalar.

In contrast, blue central galaxies typically\nexhibit almost no alignment signal, owing to a stronger internal misalignment\nwith their halo. We investigated how the internal alignment between the\nprincipal axes of the stellar and dark matter components evolves over time as a\nfunction of the total mass of central galaxies at z=0. In particular, we aim to\nunderstand why disk-dominated, blue central galaxies often show weak or absent\nalignment signals with the galaxy distribution in their group and in the\nlarger-scale cosmic structure. We used data from the IllustrisTNG300-1 run and\nselected a sample of bright central galaxies at z=0. We computed the principal\naxes of the stellar and dark matter components, along with their angular\nmomenta, to obtain the various alignment angles analyzed in this study. Also,\nwe used the merger trees to determine the number of major mergers between z=20\nand z=0, and to track their shapes along their main branch. We examined\nsecondary dependencies of the galaxy-halo alignment on properties such as color\nand merger history. We analyzed how shape alignments relate to the dynamical\ncoupling between the angular momentum directions of the stellar and dark matter\ncomponents. The results show that massive centrals tend to align with the shape\nof their inner halo, and they are typically red and have undergone numerous\nmergers. Lower-mass red centrals, and those that have experienced many mergers\nexhibit the strongest evolution toward alignment. Blue centrals, in contrast,\nare more strongly influenced by the link between the stellar and dark matter\nangular momenta, such that they evolve toward either alignment or misalignment\nwith both the shape and angular momentum of the inner halo.",

    "abstract": "Spiral arms play a central role in disc galaxies, but their dynamical nature\nremains a long-standing open question. Azimuthal offsets between molecular gas\nand star formation are expected if gas crosses spiral arms, as predicted by\nquasi-stationary density wave theory. In this work, we measure offsets between\nCO and Halpha peaks in radial bins for 24 galaxies from the PHANGS survey that\ndisplay a well-delineated spiral structure. The offsets exhibit substantial\nscatter, implying that star formation is not exclusively initiated at a\ncoherent spiral shock. We define offsets such that positive values mean Halpha\npeaks lie ahead of CO peaks in the direction of galactic rotation. With this\nconvention, 14 galaxies show mean positive CO-Halpha offsets, typically of a\nfew hundred parsecs. In four of these 14 galaxies (17% of the total), offsets\nbecome smaller with increasing radius, as expected for a single\nquasi-stationary spiral density wave. Ten galaxies (42%) show positive mean\noffsets but no clear correlation with radius, which is compatible with multiple\noverlapping modes. In the remaining ten galaxies (42%), we find no\nsignificantly positive offsets, which could point to transient dynamical\nspirals or material arms, where gas and stars co-rotate with the spiral\nperturbation. Across the full sample, we find mostly positive offsets between\nCO peaks and the gravitational potential minimum, confirming that gas often\ncrosses the spiral perturbation. For the four galaxies with clear positive\noffsets and a radial trend, we derived pattern speeds in good agreement with\nthe literature. Overall, our results suggest that even well-delineated spirals\nin the local Universe can arise from a variety of underlying dynamical\nmechanisms.",

The conversion process combines 619 nm photons with 1064 nm pump light\nin an actively stabilized cavity containing a bulk monocrystalline potassium\ntitanyl arsenate (KTA) crystal. We achieve an internal (external) conversion\nefficiency of (48 +/- 3)% ((28 +/- 2)%) and a noise photon rate per wavelength\nof 2.2 +/- 0.9 cts/s/pm, which is spectrally flat in the investigated frequency\nrange of 40 GHz. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the efficiency remains above\n80% of its maximum over a frequency range of 70 GHz. Finally, we generate a\nstring of photons from a single waveguide-embedded SnV center using a train of\nexcitation pulses and send these through the QFC. After the QFC, we observe a\nstring of telecom photons displaying the SnV lifetime, confirming successful\nconversion. These results represent a critical step towards metropolitan-scale\nfiber-based quantum networks using SnV centers.",

Vehicle electrification, alongside renewable energy integration,\nis a long-term strategy toward zero carbon emissions. However, transitioning to\nfully renewable electricity may take decades -- during which electric vehicles\nmay still rely on carbon-intensive electricity. We analyze the critical role of\nthe transmission network in enabling or constraining emissions reduction from\nU.S. vehicle electrification. Our models reveal that the available transmission\ncapacity severely limits potential CO2 emissions reduction. With adequate\ntransmission, full electrification could nearly eliminate vehicle operational\nCO2 emissions once renewable generation reaches the existing nonrenewable\ncapacity. In contrast, the current grid would support only a fraction of that\nbenefit. Achieving the full emissions reduction potential of vehicle\nelectrification during this transition will require a moderate but targeted\nincrease in transmission capacity.

    "abstract": "Quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) are X-ray transients characterized by nearly\nregular recurring flares from galactic nuclei. Recent observations have\nconfirmed that some QPEs occur in galactic centers that experienced a tidal\ndisruption event (TDE) a few years earlier. This may be reasonably explained if\nQPEs are produced when a star orbiting a supermassive black hole passes through\nan accretion disk formed by the TDE. Based on this scenario, we investigate the\nexpected QPE signatures in the early stages of TDEs, taking into account the\ntime evolution of the accretion disk. In the early phase, the disk is in a\nsuper-Eddington accretion state. The interaction between the star and such a\nslim disk results in QPEs with durations of $\\sim 100-1000\\,{\\rm s}$ and\ntemperatures of $\\sim 1-100\\,{\\rm keV}$, which are significantly shorter and\nhotter than those of the currently detected QPE population. These events are\ndetectable with current X-ray telescopes, but their small duty cycle\n($\\lesssim1\\,\\%$) and the potential presence of a massive disk wind may make\ndetection challenging. We encourage early-time and long-term monitoring TDEs\nshowing X-rays to capture these QPEs, as such detections would provide valuable\ninsights into the disk formation process in TDEs.",

This work presents Capotauro, a F356W-dropout in the CEERS\nsurvey with F444W AB magnitude of $\\sim27.68$ and a sharp $>3$ mag flux drop\nbetween $3.5{-}4.5\\,\\mu$m, undetected below $3.5\\,\\mu$m.

    "abstract": "Fake news detection is an important and challenging task for defending online\ninformation integrity. Existing state-of-the-art approaches typically extract\nnews semantic clues, such as writing patterns that include emotional words,\nstylistic features, etc. However, detectors tuned solely to such semantic clues\ncan easily fall into surface detection patterns, which can shift rapidly in\ndynamic environments, leading to limited performance in the evolving news\nlandscape. To address this issue, this paper investigates a novel perspective\nby incorporating news intent into fake news detection, bridging intents and\nsemantics together. The core insight is that by considering news intents, one\ncan deeply understand the inherent thoughts behind news deception, rather than\nthe surface patterns within words alone. To achieve this goal, we propose\nGraph-based Intent-Semantic Joint Modeling (InSide) for fake news detection,\nwhich models deception clues from both semantic and intent signals via\ngraph-based joint learning. Specifically, InSide reformulates news semantic and\nintent signals into heterogeneous graph structures, enabling long-range context\ninteraction through entity guidance and capturing both holistic and\nimplementation-level intent via coarse-to-fine intent modeling. To achieve\nbetter alignment between semantics and intents, we further develop a dynamic\npathway-based graph alignment strategy for effective message passing and\naggregation across these signals by establishing a common space. Extensive\nexperiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of the\nproposed InSide compared to state-of-the-art methods.",

    "abstract": "Mobile manipulation stands as a core challenge in robotics, enabling robots\nto assist humans across varied tasks and dynamic daily environments.\nConventional mobile manipulation approaches often struggle to generalize across\ndifferent tasks and environments due to the lack of large-scale training.\nHowever, recent advances in manipulation foundation models demonstrate\nimpressive generalization capability on a wide range of fixed-base manipulation\ntasks, which are still limited to a fixed setting. Therefore, we devise a\nplug-in module named MoTo, which can be combined with any off-the-shelf\nmanipulation foundation model to empower them with mobile manipulation ability.\nSpecifically, we propose an interaction-aware navigation policy to generate\nrobot docking points for generalized mobile manipulation. To enable zero-shot\nability, we propose an interaction keypoints framework via vision-language\nmodels (VLM) under multi-view consistency for both target object and robotic\narm following instructions, where fixed-base manipulation foundation models can\nbe employed. We further propose motion planning objectives for the mobile base\nand robot arm, which minimize the distance between the two keypoints and\nmaintain the physical feasibility of trajectories. In this way, MoTo guides the\nrobot to move to the docking points where fixed-base manipulation can be\nsuccessfully performed, and leverages VLM generation and trajectory\noptimization to achieve mobile manipulation in a zero-shot manner, without any\nrequirement on mobile manipulation expert data. Extensive experimental results\non OVMM and real-world demonstrate that MoTo achieves success rates of 2.68%\nand 16.67% higher than the state-of-the-art mobile manipulation methods,\nrespectively, without requiring additional training data.",

    "abstract": "While large-scale robot datasets have propelled recent progress in imitation\nlearning, learning from smaller task specific datasets remains critical for\ndeployment in new environments and unseen tasks. One such approach to few-shot\nimitation learning is retrieval-based imitation learning, which extracts\nrelevant samples from large, widely available prior datasets to augment a\nlimited demonstration dataset. To determine the relevant data from prior\ndatasets, retrieval-based approaches most commonly calculate a prior data\npoint's minimum distance to a point in the target dataset in latent space.\nWhile retrieval-based methods have shown success using this metric for data\nselection, we demonstrate its equivalence to the limit of a Gaussian kernel\ndensity (KDE) estimate of the target data distribution. This reveals two\nshortcomings of the retrieval rule used in prior work. First, it relies on\nhigh-variance nearest neighbor estimates that are susceptible to noise. Second,\nit does not account for the distribution of prior data when retrieving data. To\naddress these issues, we introduce Importance Weighted Retrieval (IWR), which\nestimates importance weights, or the ratio between the target and prior data\ndistributions for retrieval, using Gaussian KDEs. By considering the\nprobability ratio, IWR seeks to mitigate the bias of previous selection rules,\nand by using reasonable modeling parameters, IWR effectively smooths estimates\nusing all data points. Across both simulation environments and real-world\nevaluations on the Bridge dataset we find that our method, IWR, consistently\nimproves performance of existing retrieval-based methods, despite only\nrequiring minor modifications.",

We show that even though\nthe underlying ISM changes between starburst and Milky Way analogue models, the\nvelocity fluctuations in the turbulence of both models, but not the kinetic\nenergy fluctuations, can be normalized into a universal, single cascade,\n$u^2(k) \\propto k^{-3/2}$, where $u$ is the velocity and $k$ is the wavemode,\nindicating that the structure of the turbulence is robust to significant\nchanges in the ISM and SNe seeding.

    "abstract": "Optimising industrial processes is essential for enhancing profitability,\nefficiency, and sustainability. Conventional optimisation relies on\nequation-oriented (EO) glass-box models with fully specified equations and\naccessible derivatives. However, many real-world systems contain black-box\ncomponents (such as high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics simulators or\nproprietary unit models) that lack explicit formulations or analytic gradients.\nThis limits the applicability of derivative-based deterministic optimisation on\ngrey-box (glass-box/black-box) problems. The classical trust-region filter\n(TRF) algorithm offers a promising framework for such grey-box optimisation,\nbut often requires adjusting numerous tuning parameters and many black-box\nevaluations to converge. In this work, we extend the classical TRF method by\nintroducing four new variants that incorporate second-order information through\nlocal Hessian projections, improving robustness and reducing sensitivity to\ntuning parameters. We further integrate a flexible surrogate modelling\nframework, enabling the optimiser to switch between low-fidelity (linear,\nquadratic, simplified quadratic) and high-fidelity (Taylor series, Gaussian\nprocess) surrogates for local approximation of black-box components.\nPerformance is benchmarked on a suite of 25 grey-box test problems and several\nengineering case studies, including liquid-liquid extraction, pressure vessel\ndesign, alkylation process, and spring design. Across all cases, the new\nvariants achieved up to an order-of-magnitude reduction in iterations and\nblack-box evaluations relative to the classical TRF algorithm. These findings\ndemonstrate the new variants as efficient alternatives for grey-box process\nsystems optimisation.",

In this work,\nwe make three main contributions. First, we show that pretraining with\ndistillation yields models that exhibit remarkably better test-time scaling.\nSecond, we observe that this benefit comes with a trade-off: distillation\nimpairs in-context learning capabilities, particularly the one modeled via\ninduction heads. Third, to demystify these findings, we study distilled\npretraining in a sandbox of a bigram model, which helps us isolate the common\nprincipal factor behind our observations.

The recent discovery of 3I/ATLAS,\nthe second interstellar comet ever observed, offers a unique opportunity to\ninvestigate the physical and chemical properties of interstellar objects and to\ncompare them with those of comets in our own Solar System. In this Letter we\npresent the results of a 10-night spectroscopic and photometric monitoring\ncampaign with the 2.4 m Hiltner and 1.3 m McGraw-Hill telescopes at the MDM\nObservatory. The campaign was conducted between August 8 and 17 while 3I/ATLAS\nwas inbound at heliocentric distances of 3.2 - 2.9 au. Our observations\ncaptured the onset of optical gas-driven activity. Nightly spectra reveal a\nweak CN emission feature in the coma of 3I/ATLAS, absent during the first\nnights but steadily strengthening thereafter. We measure a CN production rate\nof $\\sim$8$\\times$10$^{23}$ s$^{-1}$, towards the lower end of activity\nobserved in Solar System comets. Simultaneous photometry also indicates a small\nbut measurable increase in the coma's radial profile and increasing $r$-band\n$Af\\rho$ with values in the order of $\\sim300$ cm. Our upper limit on the\nC$_2$-to-CN ratio ($\\log Q(\\mathrm{C}_2)/Q(\\mathrm{CN})<-1.05$) places 3I/ATLAS\namong the most carbon-chain depleted comets known. The derived gas-to-dust\nproduction ratio of $\\log Q (\\mathrm{CN})/Af\\rho<21.49$ is likewise at the low\nend of the Solar System comet distribution. Further observations of 3I/ATLAS\nare required to verify the apparent carbon-chain depletion and to explore\nwhether such composition represents a recurring trait of the interstellar comet\npopulation.",

The\ninitial results are promising: despite this simplification, OpenVision 2\ncompetitively matches the original model's performance on a broad set of\nmultimodal benchmarks while substantially cutting both training time and memory\nconsumption. For example, with ViT-L/14, it reduces training time by about 1.5x\n(from 83h to 57h), and memory usage by about 1.8x (from 24.5GB to 13.8GB,\nequivalently allowing the maximum batch size to grow from 2k to 8k).

Additionally, many methods rely on holistic scoring,\noverlooking specific writing aspects such as grammar, vocabulary, and cohesion.\nTo address these challenges, this study proposes TransGAT, a novel approach\nthat integrates fine-tuned Transformer models with GNNs for analytic scoring.\nTransGAT combines the contextual understanding of Transformers with the\nrelational modeling strength of Graph Attention Networks (GAT). It performs\ntwo-stream predictions by pairing each fine-tuned Transformer (BERT, RoBERTa,\nand DeBERTaV3) with a separate GAT. In each pair, the first stream generates\nessay-level predictions, while the second applies GAT to Transformer token\nembeddings, with edges constructed from syntactic dependencies. The model then\nfuses predictions from both streams to produce the final analytic score.\nExperiments on the ELLIPSE dataset show that TransGAT outperforms baseline\nmodels, achieving an average Quadratic Weighted Kappa (QWK) of 0.854 across all\nanalytic scoring dimensions.

In this paper, we propose Learning to Coordinate (L2C), a general\nframework that meta-learns these hyperparameters, modeled by lightweight\nagent-wise neural networks, to adapt across diverse tasks and agent\nconfigurations. L2C differentiates end-to-end through the ADMM-DDP pipeline in\na distributed manner.

Training is further accelerated by\ntruncating iterations and meta-learning ADMM penalty parameters optimized for\nrapid residual reduction, with provable Lipschitz-bounded gradient errors. On a\nchallenging cooperative aerial transport task, L2C generates dynamically\nfeasible trajectories in high-fidelity simulation using IsaacSIM, reconfigures\nquadrotor formations for safe 6-DoF load manipulation in tight spaces, and\nadapts robustly to varying team sizes and task conditions, while achieving up\nto $88\\%$ faster gradient computation than state-of-the-art methods.",

Few-step\ndiffusion models reduce this cost to 2-8 denoising steps but still depend on\nlarge, uncompressed U-Net or diffusion transformer backbones, which are often\ntoo costly for full-precision inference without datacenter GPUs. These\nrequirements also limit existing post-training quantization methods that rely\non full-precision calibration.

By adjusting the few-step sampling trajectory, Q-Sched\nachieves full-precision accuracy with a 4x reduction in model size. To learn\nquantization-aware pre-conditioning coefficients, we propose the JAQ loss,\nwhich combines text-image compatibility with an image quality metric for\nfine-grained optimization.

Those approaches however\ncan be susceptible to distributional biases in the data they are trained on. We\nidentify two such biases: Marginal Distribution Asymmetry, where differences in\nentropy skew causal learning toward certain factorizations, and Marginal\nDistribution Shift Asymmetry, where repeated interventions cause faster shifts\nin some variables than in others. For the bivariate categorical setup with\nDirichlet priors, we illustrate how these biases can occur even in controlled\nsynthetic data. To examine their impact on gradient-based methods, we employ\ntwo simple models that derive causal factorizations by learning marginal or\nconditional data distributions - a common strategy in gradient-based causal\ndiscovery. We demonstrate how these models can be susceptible to both biases.\nWe additionally show how the biases can be controlled.

Due to the distinctive characteristics of modern Chinese\npoetry, it is difficult to identify whether a poem originated from humans or\nAI. The proliferation of AI-generated modern Chinese poetry has significantly\ndisrupted the poetry ecosystem. Based on the urgency of identifying\nAI-generated poetry in the real Chinese world, this paper proposes a novel\nbenchmark for detecting LLMs-generated modern Chinese poetry. We first\nconstruct a high-quality dataset, which includes both 800 poems written by six\nprofessional poets and 41,600 poems generated by four mainstream LLMs.\nSubsequently, we conduct systematic performance assessments of six detectors on\nthis dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that current detectors cannot be\nused as reliable tools to detect modern Chinese poems generated by LLMs. The\nmost difficult poetic features to detect are intrinsic qualities, especially\nstyle. The detection results verify the effectiveness and necessity of our\nproposed benchmark. Our work lays a foundation for future detection of\nAI-generated poetry.",

Deployed maliciously or\nerroneously, these agents could overload content providers. At the same time,\nweb agents can bypass CAPTCHAs and other defenses by mimicking user behavior or\nflood authentication systems with fake accounts. Yet providers must protect\ntheir services and content from denial-of-service attacks and scraping by web\nagents. In this paper, we design a framework that imposes tunable costs on\nagents before providing access to resources; we call this Web Agent Throttling.\nWe start by formalizing Throttling Gates as challenges issued to an agent that\nare asymmetric, scalable, robust, and compatible with any agent. Focusing on a\ncommon component -- the language model -- we require the agent to solve\nreasoning puzzles, thereby incurring excessive token-generation costs. However,\nwe find that using existing puzzles, e.g., coding or math, as throttling gates\nfails to satisfy our properties. To address this, we introduce rebus-based\nReasoning Gates, synthetic text puzzles that require multi-hop reasoning over\nworld knowledge (thereby throttling an agent's model). We design a scalable\ngeneration and verification protocol for such reasoning gates. Our framework\nachieves computational asymmetry, i.e., the response-generation cost is 9.2x\nhigher than the generation cost for SOTA models. We further deploy reasoning\ngates on a custom website and Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers and evaluate\nwith real-world web agents.

BLAST successfully generates issue-reproducing tests for 151/426 (35.4%)\nof the issues from a curated Python benchmark, outperforming the\nstate-of-the-art (23.5%). Additionally, to measure the real-world impact of\nBLAST, we built a GitHub bot that runs BLAST whenever a new pull request (PR)\nlinked to an issue is opened, and if BLAST generates an issue-reproducing test,\nthe bot proposes it as a comment in the PR.

We consider the dispersion effects within\nthe low-energy, effective field theory limit, and model the dispersion relation\nvia standard parameterized deformations. Such modified dispersion relations\nproduce two modifications to the burst waveform: a modification to the time of\narrival of the bursts in the detector, which appears as a 2.5PN correction to\nthe difference in burst arrival times, and a modification to the arrival time\nof individual orbital harmonics within the bursts themselves, resulting in a\nBessel-type amplitude modulation of the waveform. Using the Fisher information\nmatrix, we study projected constraints one might obtain with future\nobservations of repeating burst signals with LIGO. We find that the projected\nconstraints vary significantly depending on the theoretical mechanism producing\nthe modified dispersion.

    "abstract": "We investigate the out-of-equilibrium dynamics after a quantum quench of the\nreduced fidelities between the states of a subregion $A$ at different times.\nPrecisely, we consider the fidelity between the time-dependent state of $A$ and\nits initial value, as well as with the state at infinite time. We denote these\nfidelities as the reduced Loschmidt echo (RLE) and the final-state fidelity\n(FSF), respectively. If region $A$ is the full systems, the RLE coincide with\nthe standard Loschmidt echo. We focus on quenches from Gaussian states in\nseveral instances of the XY spin chain. In the hydrodynamic limit of long times\nand large sizes of $A$, with their ratio fixed, the reduced fidelities admit a\nquasiparticle picture interpretation. Interestingly, for some quenches in the\nhydrodynamic regime the RLE features a complicated structure with an infinite\nsequence of nested lightcones, corresponding to quasiparticles with arbitrary\nlarge group velocities. This leads to a ''staircase'' of cusp-like\nsingularities in the time-derivative of the fidelity. At the sub-hydrodynamic\nregime for some quenches the RLE exhibits cusp-like singularities, similar to\nthe so-called dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPT). We conjecture a\ncriterion for the occurrence of the DQPT and for the ''critical'' times at\nwhich the singularities occur. Finally, we discuss the hydrodynamic limit of\nthe FSF. In particular, we show that it provides a valuable tool to detect the\nso-called quantum Mpemba effect.",

    "abstract": "Recently, the emergence of multitask deep learning models has enhanced\ncatheterization procedures by providing tactile and visual perception data\nthrough an end-to-end architecture. This information is derived from a\nsegmentation and force estimation head, which localizes the catheter in X-ray\nimages and estimates the applied pressure based on its deflection within the\nimage. These stereo vision architectures incorporate a CNN-based\nencoder-decoder that captures the dependencies between X-ray images from two\nviewpoints, enabling simultaneous 3D force estimation and stereo segmentation\nof the catheter. With these tasks in mind, this work approaches the problem\nfrom a new perspective. We propose a novel encoder-decoder Vision Transformer\nmodel that processes two input X-ray images as separate sequences. Given\nsequences of X-ray patches from two perspectives, the transformer captures\nlong-range dependencies without the need to gradually expand the receptive\nfield for either image. The embeddings generated by both the encoder and\ndecoder are fed into two shared segmentation heads, while a regression head\nemploys the fused information from the decoder for 3D force estimation. The\nproposed model is a stereo Vision Transformer capable of simultaneously\nsegmenting the catheter from two angles while estimating the generated forces\nat its tip in 3D. This model has undergone extensive experiments on synthetic\nX-ray images with various noise levels and has been compared against\nstate-of-the-art pure segmentation models, vision-based catheter force\nestimation methods, and a multitask catheter segmentation and force estimation\napproach.

We propose an alternative hierarchical modeling\nframework that captures temporal trends in areal data through Gaussian\nprocesses that share spatial information via correlated variance components.\nThis allows the model to better capture shared patterns of variability across\nregions while preserving local temporal dynamics, offering a more flexible\nrepresentation of spatio-temporal processes.\n  Specifically, we extend independent Gaussian-process models for time-series\ndata to a spatially correlated framework by placing a conditional\nautoregressive (CAR) prior on the parameters governing the temporal variability\nand imposing a conditional dependence of the temporal range on the temporal\nvariance. We apply this model to two case studies: monthly malaria incidence in\nNiassa, Mozambique, and weekly food insecurity prevalence in Cameroon.\nInference is conducted within a Bayesian framework using approximate posterior\nsampling. Given the hierarchical structure of the model, we employ a\ncombination of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques, including the\nMetropolis-adjusted Langevin algorithm (MALA), Metropolis-Hastings, and Gibbs\nsampling.\n  In both applications, the model demonstrates strong in-sample performance\nwith narrow credible intervals and outperforms established spatio-temporal\napproaches in many regions when forecasting. These results underscore the\nmodel's ability to capture complex spatio-temporal dependencies while\nmaintaining interpretability, key in settings with sparse data and policy\nrelevance. By accounting for spatio-temporal variation through the evolution of\ntemporal dynamics themselves, our approach offers a flexible and principled\ntool for many applied contexts.",

Here, we\ndemonstrate that suitably engineered noise can induce a \"Zeno-like\"\nstabilization effect of the charging process in a spin-chain quantum battery\nwithin the Heisenberg XYZ model. Focusing on a system size N=6, which balances\ncomputational cost and storage capacity, we find that the ergotropy-to-energy\nratio W(t)/E_B(t) attains a maximum value of about 0.99 at a certain time\nparameter value. Then, by varying the noise strength in each channel, we find\nthat not only does decoherence merely degrade performance but it may also\nstabilize stored energy and ergotropy in the high noise strength regime. For\ninstance, the phase-flip channel slows charging and reduces charging power, but\nits discharging behavior releases energy and ergotropy more slowly, allowing\nthe battery to be used for longer times compared to bit-flip and bit-phase-flip\nchannels. In contrast, the bit-flip channel enables fast charging, but yields\nlow storage and rapid energy release. Remarkably, the bit-phase-flip channel\ncan combine the advantages of both bit-flip and phase-flip channels in the\nhigh-noise-strength regime. The bit-phase-flip channel supports accelerated\ncharging together with enhanced storage capacity, while its discharging\nbehavior resembles that of the bit-flip channel with rapid energy release.\nThese results reveal that, under sufficiently strong noise, environmental\ndecoherence induces a Zeno-like stabilization, allowing it to achieve enhanced\ncharging performance and to stabilize stored energy and ergotropy in the\nspin-chain quantum battery.",

In this study, we investigate the tipping point dynamics of avalanche\ncatastrophes in low-fluctuation domain, employing model system like the zero\ntemperature random field Ising model and thermally deposited cobalt films. As\nthe system approaches the tipping point, avalanche activity reveals pronounced\ncritical behaviour, including critical slowing down, variance enhancement, and\na growing spatial correlation length--hallmarks that may serve as early warning\nsignals of impending collapse. Crucially, we demonstrate that increasing\ndisorder in the system reduces its vulnerability to catastrophic failure. In\nhighly disorder regimes, these early warning signals emerge well before the\ntransition, thereby providing a large margin for anticipation and mitigation.\nThis key finding suggests a protective role of disorder offering a novel\nperspective on resilience in complex systems.

We assume that the underlying equations are\nequivalent to the conductivity problem in a weak applied magnetic field. While\nwe focus on the Hall effect, our results are more generally applicable,\nparticularly to the Faraday effect in the quasistatic regime and in the absence\nof losses and resonances. Our bounds yield three important implications: First,\nthe effective Hall mobility of a metamaterial cannot be larger than the largest\nHall mobility among the constituent materials. Second, under additional\nconditions, the effective Verdet constant cannot be enhanced either. Third, for\ndiagonal Hall tensor components, the optimal values are achieved either by one\nof the pure phases or a rank-1 laminate formed from them, provided that the\nHall coefficients of all phases have the same sign. Our work elucidates the\nlimits of nonreciprocal metamaterials and identifies key prerequisites for\nobtaining exotic phenomena such as sign-inversions and enhancements. Several\nextensions appear within reach, for example to the Faraday effect in\nmetamaterials exhibiting plasmonic resonances.",

We consider this in the context of\nthe semi-strong Efficient Markets Hypothesis (EMH), which posits that prices\nfully reflect all public information and, accordingly, that clusters based on\nprice information cannot be improved upon. We benchmark three clustering\napproaches: (i) price-based clusters derived from historical return\ncorrelations, (ii) human-informed clusters defined by the Global Industry\nClassification Standard (GICS), and (iii) AI-driven clusters constructed from\nlarge language model (LLM) embeddings of stock-related news headlines. At each\ndate, each method provides a classification in which each stock is assigned to\na cluster. To evaluate a clustering, we transform it into a synthetic factor\nmodel following the Arbitrage Pricing Theory (APT) framework. This enables\nconsistent evaluation of predictive performance in a roll forward,\nout-of-sample test. Using S&P 500 constituents from from 2022 through 2024, we\nfind that price-based clustering consistently outperforms both rule-based and\nAI-based methods, reducing root mean squared error (RMSE) by 15.9% relative to\nGICS and 14.7% relative to LLM embeddings. Our contributions are threefold: (i)\na generalizable methodology that converts any equity grouping: manual, machine,\nor market-driven, into a real-time factor model for evaluation; (ii) the first\ndirect comparison of price-based, human rule-based, and AI-based clustering\nunder identical conditions; and (iii) empirical evidence reinforcing that\nshort-horizon return information is largely contained in prices. These results\nsupport the EMH while offering practitioners a practical diagnostic for\nmonitoring evolving sector structures and provide academics a framework for\ntesting alternative hypotheses about how quickly markets absorb information.",

In this study, we examine the melting of a\nvertical ice wall caused by surface waves using both theory and laboratory\nexperiments, with an emphasis on the flow-induced heat transport in the theory\nand measurements of the melt rate profile under different wave conditions in\nthe experiments. In both the theory and the experiments, we find that there is\nenhanced melting near the surface that decays with depth. Via an analysis the\noscillatory boundary layer flow, we find that an approximate, leading-order,\nwave-averaged balance of heat transport is given by the vertical advection due\nto an Eulerian boundary layer streaming current and horizontal diffusion. By\nsolving for this balance and obtaining the wave-averaged temperature field, we\nfind an explicit expression for the wave-induced melt rate.

These challenges include annotator subjectivity, where varying\ninterpretations among annotators lead to inconsistencies, and class imbalance\nwithin chord datasets, where certain chord classes are over-represented\ncompared to others, posing difficulties in model training and evaluation. As a\nfirst contribution, this paper presents an evaluation of inter-annotator\nagreement in chord annotations, using metrics that extend beyond traditional\nbinary measures. In addition, we propose a consonance-informed distance metric\nthat reflects the perceptual similarity between harmonic annotations. Our\nanalysis suggests that consonance-based distance metrics more effectively\ncapture musically meaningful agreement between annotations. Expanding on these\nfindings, we introduce a novel ACE conformer-based model that integrates\nconsonance concepts into the model through consonance-based label smoothing.\nThe proposed model also addresses class imbalance by separately estimating\nroot, bass, and all note activations, enabling the reconstruction of chord\nlabels from decomposed outputs.",

Since\nits inception in 2015, it has been divided into numerous subfields that deal\nwith application-specific issues, such as data heterogeneity or resource\nallocation. One such sub-field, Clustered Federated Learning (CFL), deals with\nthe problem of clustering the population of clients into separate cohorts to\ndeliver personalised models. Although a few remarkable works have been\npublished in this domain, the problem remains largely unexplored, as its basic\nassumptions and settings differ slightly from those of standard FL. In this\nwork, we present One-Shot Clustered Federated Learning (OCFL), a\nclustering-agnostic algorithm that can automatically detect the earliest\nsuitable moment for clustering. Our algorithm is based on computing the cosine\ndistance between the gradients of the clients and a temperature measure that\ndetects when the federated model starts to converge. We empirically evaluate\nour methodology by testing various one-shot clustering algorithms for over\nforty different tasks on five benchmark datasets. Our experiments showcase the\ngood performance of our approach when used to perform CFL in an automated\nmanner without the need to adjust hyperparameters. We also revisit the\npractical feasibility of CFL algorithms based on the gradients of the clients,\nproviding firm evidence of the high efficiency of density-based clustering\nmethods when used to differentiate between the loss surfaces of neural networks\ntrained on different distributions.

We propose an experiment to test the quantum nature of\ngravity by checking whether gravity can entangle two micron-sized crystals. A\npathway to this is to create macroscopic quantum superpositions of each crystal\nfirst using embedded spins and Stern-Gerlach forces. These crystals could be\nnanodiamonds containing nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centres. The spins can\nsubsequently be measured to witness the gravitationally generated entanglement.\nThis is based on extensive theoretical feasibility studies and experimental\nprogress in quantum technology. The eventual experiment will require a\nmedium-sized consortium with excellent suppression of decoherence including\nvibrations and gravitational noise. In this white paper, we review the progress\nand plans towards realizing this.

    "abstract": "Quantum emitters coupled to waveguides with nonlinear dispersion show rich\nquantum dynamics with the promise of implementing non-trivial non-Markovian\nquantum models. Recent advances in engineered photonic environments now allow\nthe realization of discrete-site waveguides with tailored dispersion, yet most\nimplementations of waveguide QED remain limited to a local qubit-waveguide\ncoupling. Here, we study a transmon qubit non-locally coupled to a\nhigh-impedance coupled cavity array (CCA), thus implementing a \\emph{giant\natom} in a structured photonic environment. The non-local coupling produces\ninterference with the CCA eigenmodes, selectively enhancing interaction with\nlong-wavelength (low-effective $k$), symmetric modes about the array center,\nwhile suppressing coupling to antisymmetric and short-wavelength modes. For a\nsubset of symmetric, low-effective $k$ modes, we reach the superstrong coupling\nregime. In this regime, measurements of the atomic participation ratio reveal\nstrongly hybridized eigenmodes on a par with a strongly reduced qubit\nparticipation at the frequency of maximum hybridization with the qubit, in\nagreement with theory. Time-domain measurements of the qubit dynamics show\nclear deviations from the single-mode Jaynes--Cummings model, marked by the\nemergence of mode--mode interactions. By breaking inversion symmetry, the qubit\nseeds dressed eigenmodes confined to either the right or left of the qubit,\nwhich we exploit to implement and characterize a chiral photon-emission\nprotocol. These results demonstrate precise control over multimode\nlight--matter interaction in a structured photonic environment.",

This paper contributes to\naddressing the challenge of decision-making by proposing a structured\ndecision-making framework as a foundational step towards responsible AI. The\nproposed structured decision-making framework is implemented in autonomous\ndecision-making, specifically within disaster management. By introducing\nconcepts of Enabler agents, Levels and Scenarios, the proposed framework's\nperformance is evaluated against systems relying solely on judgement-based\ninsights, as well as human operators who have disaster experience: victims,\nvolunteers, and stakeholders. The results demonstrate that the structured\ndecision-making framework achieves 60.94% greater stability in consistently\naccurate decisions across multiple Scenarios, compared to judgement-based\nsystems. Moreover, the study shows that the proposed framework outperforms\nhuman operators with a 38.93% higher accuracy across various Scenarios.

This overconfidence, especially in models\nundergone Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), poses significant\nchallenges for reliable uncertainty estimation and safe deployment. In this\npaper, we propose EAGLE (Expectation of AGgregated internaL bEief), a novel\nself-evaluation-based calibration method that leverages the internal hidden\nstates of LLMs to derive more accurate confidence scores. Instead of relying on\nthe model's final output, our approach extracts internal beliefs from multiple\nintermediate layers during self-evaluation. By aggregating these layer-wise\nbeliefs and calculating the expectation over the resulting confidence score\ndistribution, EAGLE produces a refined confidence score that more faithfully\nreflects the model's internal certainty. Extensive experiments on diverse\ndatasets and LLMs demonstrate that EAGLE significantly improves calibration\nperformance over existing baselines. We also provide an in-depth analysis of\nEAGLE, including a layer-wise examination of uncertainty patterns, a study of\nthe impact of self-evaluation prompts, and an analysis of the effect of\nself-evaluation score range.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, the development of Large Language Models (LLMs) has\nsignificantly advanced, extending their capabilities to multimodal tasks\nthrough Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, video understanding\nremains a challenging area due to the dynamic and information-dense nature of\nvideos. Existing models struggle with the trade-off between spatial resolution\nand temporal coverage when processing video content. We present Keye-VL-1.5,\nwhich addresses fundamental challenges in video comprehension through three key\ninnovations. First, we introduce a novel Slow-Fast video encoding strategy that\ndynamically allocates computational resources based on inter-frame similarity,\nprocessing key frames with significant visual changes at higher resolution\n(Slow pathway) while handling relatively static frames with increased temporal\ncoverage at lower resolution (Fast pathway). Second, we implement a progressive\nfour-stage pre-training methodology that systematically extends the model's\ncontext length from 8K to 128K tokens, enabling processing of longer videos and\nmore complex visual content. Third, we develop a comprehensive post-training\npipeline focusing on reasoning enhancement and human preference alignment,\nincorporating a 5-step chain-of-thought data construction process, iterative\nGSPO-based reinforcement learning with progressive prompt hinting for difficult\ncases, and alignment training. Through extensive evaluation on public\nbenchmarks and rigorous internal human assessment, Keye-VL-1.5 demonstrates\nsignificant improvements over existing models, particularly excelling in video\nunderstanding tasks while maintaining competitive performance on general\nmultimodal benchmarks.",

Due to the complicated\nand heterogeneous context, as well as possible artifacts, there are often false\npositives and false negatives, thus degrading the detection F1-score. To\naddress this problem, we propose a two-stage framework. Firstly, an improved\nYOLO11x, integrated with EMA attention and LSConv, is employed to generate\nmitosis candidates. We use a low confidence threshold to generate as many\nproposals as possible, ensuring the detection recall. Then, a ConvNeXt-Tiny\nclassifier is employed to filter out the false positives, ensuring the\ndetection precision. Consequently, the proposed two-stage framework can\ngenerate a high detection F1-score. Evaluated on a fused dataset comprising\nMIDOG++, MITOS_WSI_CCMCT, and MITOS_WSI_CMC, our framework achieves an F1-score\nof 0.882, which is 0.035 higher than the single-stage YOLO11x baseline.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we revisit parameter estimation for multinomial logit (MNL),\nnested logit (NL), and tree-nested logit (TNL) models through the framework of\nconvex conic optimization. Traditional approaches typically solve the maximum\nlikelihood estimation (MLE) problem using gradient-based methods, which are\nsensitive to step-size selection and initialization, and may therefore suffer\nfrom slow or unstable convergence. In contrast, we propose a novel estimation\nstrategy that reformulates these models as conic optimization problems,\nenabling more robust and reliable estimation procedures. Specifically, we show\nthat the MLE for MNL admits an equivalent exponential cone program (ECP). For\nNL and TNL, we prove that when the dissimilarity (scale) parameters are fixed,\nthe estimation problem is convex and likewise reducible to an ECP. Leveraging\nthese results, we design a two-stage procedure: an outer loop that updates the\nscale parameters and an inner loop that solves the ECP to update the utility\ncoefficients. The inner problems are handled by interior-point methods with\niteration counts that grow only logarithmically in the target accuracy, as\nimplemented in off-the-shelf solvers (e.g., MOSEK). Extensive experiments\nacross estimation instances of varying size show that our conic approach\nattains better MLE solutions, greater robustness to initialization, and\nsubstantial speedups compared to standard gradient-based MLE, particularly on\nlarge-scale instances with high-dimensional specifications and large choice\nsets. Our findings establish exponential cone programming as a practical and\nscalable alternative for estimating a broad class of discrete choice models.",

In order to theoretically investigate magnetic sublevel\npopulations and their dependence on the relative orientation and phase -- i.e.\nthe polarization state -- of the isolated magnetic field, we use a\ntime-dependent density-matrix method based on the Liouville-von Neumann\nequation.

To\naddress these challenges, we developed HIFU-ILDiff, a novel deep learning-based\napproach leveraging latent diffusion models to suppress HIFU-induced\ninterference in ultrasound images. The HIFU-ILDiff model employs a Vector\nQuantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) to encode noisy ultrasound images\ninto a lower-dimensional latent space, followed by a latent diffusion model\nthat iteratively removes interference. The denoised latent vectors are then\ndecoded to reconstruct high-resolution, interference-free ultrasound images. We\nconstructed a comprehensive dataset comprising 18,872 image pairs from in vitro\nphantoms, ex vivo tissues, and in vivo animal data across multiple imaging\nmodalities and HIFU power levels to train and evaluate the model. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that HIFU-ILDiff significantly outperforms the commonly\nused Notch Filter method, achieving a Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) of\n0.796 and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) of 23.780 compared to SSIM of 0.443\nand PSNR of 14.420 for the Notch Filter under in vitro scenarios.

    "abstract": "The exponential growth of artificial intelligence (AI) workloads is driving\nan urgent demand for optical interconnects with ultrahigh bandwidth, energy\nefficiency, and scalability. Silicon photonics, with its CMOS compatibility and\nwafer-scale manufacturability, has emerged as a promising platform for optical\ninterconnect architectures. Silicon microring modulators (MRMs), with their\ncompact footprint, low power consumption, and high modulation efficiency, have\nbecome ideal devices for modulation in interconnects. However, silicon MRMS\nhave so far been constrained by the trade-off between modulation efficiency and\nbandwidth, hindering their potential for 400 Gbps-per-wavelength operation. To\nmitigate this trade-off, here we demonstrate a wafer-level fabricated and\nhigh-bandwidth silicon MRM with a novel heavily-doped trench-integrated\nstructure on a 300-mm silicon photonic platform, achieving both outstanding\ndevice performance and remarkable wafer-scale uniformity. Exploiting dual\noperation modes: self-biasing for energy-efficient scale-up interconnects and\ndepletion driving for ultrafast scale-out links, the device supports error-free\n32-Gbps NRZ transmission over 2-km SSMF with only 0.43-Vpp drive and zero\nelectrical bias, yielding energy efficiency of 0.97 fJ/bit without DSP. At\nhigher swings, it further supports 280-Gbps PAM4 and error-free 80-Gbps NRZ\noptical modulation. For scale-out interconnects, open eye diagrams are achieved\nat 200 Gbps (NRZ), 360 Gbps (PAM4), and a record 400 Gbps (PAM6), establishing\nthe first wafer-scale silicon MRM solution reaching 400 Gbps/$\\lambda$. The\nsub-fJ/bit energy efficiency and high bandwidth demonstrated in this work\nestablish the MRM as a scalable, high-performance solution for next-generation\noptical interconnect architectures in AI computing networks",

Conversely, on-device\nagents ensure privacy and responsiveness but lack the computational power for\nglobal modeling and large-scale retrieval. To bridge these complementary\nlimitations, we propose CDA4Rec, a novel Cloud-Device collaborative framework\nfor sequential Recommendation, powered by dual agents: a cloud-side LLM and a\ndevice-side small language model (SLM). CDA4Rec tackles the core challenge of\ncloud-device coordination by decomposing the recommendation task into modular\nsub-tasks including semantic modeling, candidate retrieval, structured user\nmodeling, and final ranking, which are allocated to cloud or device based on\ncomputational demands and privacy sensitivity. A strategy planning mechanism\nleverages the cloud agent's reasoning ability to generate personalized\nexecution plans, enabling context-aware task assignment and partial parallel\nexecution across agents. This design ensures real-time responsiveness, improved\nefficiency, and fine-grained personalization, even under diverse user states\nand behavioral sparsity.

Despite its wide utility, RMSD calculation is\noften challenged by inconsistent atom ordering, indistinguishable\nconfigurations in molecular clusters, and potential chirality inversion during\nalignment. These issues highlight the necessity of accurate atom-to-atom\ncorrespondence as a prerequisite for meaningful alignment. Traditional\napproaches often rely on heuristic cost matrices combined with the Hungarian\nalgorithm, yet these methods underutilize the rich intra-molecular structural\ninformation and may fail to generalize across chemically diverse systems. In\nthis work, we introduce OTMol, a method that formulates the molecular alignment\ntask as a fused supervised Gromov-Wasserstein (fsGW) optimal transport problem.\nBy leveraging the intrinsic geometric and topological relationships within each\nmolecule, OTMol eliminates the need for manually defined cost functions and\nenables a principled, data-driven matching strategy. Importantly, OTMol\npreserves key chemical features such as molecular chirality and bond\nconnectivity consistency. We evaluate OTMol across a wide range of molecular\nsystems, including Adenosine triphosphate, Imatinib, lipids, small peptides,\nand water clusters, and demonstrate that it consistently achieves low RMSD\nvalues while preserving computational efficiency. Importantly, OTMol maintains\nmolecular integrity by enforcing one-to-one mappings between entire molecules,\nthereby avoiding erroneous many-to-one alignments that often arise in comparing\nmolecular clusters.

Unauthorized merging may\ninfringe on developers' rights and risk leaking sensitive personal information.\nMost existing methods focus on detecting whether a merged model originates from\na specific source model, but fail to effectively prevent illegal merging.

Specifically, leveraging the inherent symmetry of\nthe attention mechanism in Transformer-based models, we randomly sample two\npairs of invertible matrices and apply them to the Query-Key (QK) and\nValue-Output (VO) branches. This transformation keeps the model's output\nunchanged while pushing it away from the shared parameter space of other\nfinetuned models. Extensive experiments across both vision and language tasks\ndemonstrate that MergeLock can degrade the performance of merged models by over\n95% when a protected model is involved in most cases, demonstrating its\neffectiveness. Moreover, we further demonstrate that merged models protected by\nMergeLock cannot be effectively recovered using low-cost restoration methods,\nfurther enhancing robustness against unauthorized merging.

Given the renewed interest in IDE models, it is crucial to fully\nunderstand their parameter space when constraining them observationally,\nespecially with regard to the often-neglected issues of negative energy\ndensities and future big rip singularities.

    "abstract": "The emission-line binary ALS 8814 was recently proposed as a Be star + black\nhole (BH) binary based on large-amplitude radial velocity (RV) variations of a\nBe star and non-detection of spectroscopic features from a luminous companion.\nWe reanalyze low- and medium-resolution LAMOST spectra of ALS 8814 and show\nthat the system's spectroscopic variability is considerably more complex than\npreviously recognized. Inspection of the system's trailed spectra reveals the\npresence of a second set of absorption lines that move in anti-phase with the\nBe star. In addition, the emission and absorption lines exhibit inconsistent RV\nvariability, suggesting that they trace different stars. Using spectral\ndisentangling, we recover the spectrum of a rapidly rotating companion whose\nbroad, shallow lines were previously undetected. Time-variability in the\nemission lines complicates interpretation of the disentangled spectrum, such\nthat the physical parameters of the components are still uncertain, but we find\nwith simulations that emission line variability alone is unlikely to explain\nall signatures of the companion. The system's high Gaia RUWE value suggests a\nthird luminous companion, making ALS 8814 a likely hierarchical triple.\nAlthough it is unlikely to contain a BH, the system is unusual, with the\nlargest RV semi-amplitude observed in any known classical Be star and a\ncompanion that does not appear to be stripped. More extensive spectroscopic\nmonitoring and high-resolution imaging will be necessary to fully characterize\nthe system's orbital architecture, stellar parameters, and evolutionary status.",

CSR introduces automated,\noperator-level counterfactual interventions (e.g., swapping \"+\" with \"-\")\nduring training and penalizes models that preserve the same answer under\nlogically invalid traces.

To measure faithfulness, we introduce Counterfactual Outcome\nSensitivity (COS), which quantifies the impact of such perturbations on model\npredictions. Across structured reasoning tasks - arithmetic (GSM8K), logical\ndeduction (PrOntoQA), and planning (Blocks World) - CSR improves faithfulness\nby up to 70 percentage points over standard fine-tuning and process\nsupervision, with only minor accuracy loss.

The\nframework integrates the Phase Function Method (PFM) with a two-stage\nsupervised multi-layer perceptron (MLP) model to extract the optimal parameters\nof the Malfliet-Tjon (MT) potential from sparse phase-shift data. A synthetic\ndataset of phase shifts is generated by solving the phase equation for angular\nmomentum $\\ell$ = 0, using the fifth-order Runge-Kutta method, ensuring\nphysically consistent training data. The first neural network predicts the\nattractive potential strength, $\\tilde{V}_A$, while the second estimates the\nrepulsive strength, $\\tilde{V}_R$. The optimal range parameter, $\\mu$, is\nobtained through error minimization between predicted and expected phase\nshifts, thereby enhancing both stability and accuracy compared to conventional\ninversion techniques. The PGNN framework is validated for the $^1S_0$ state of\nneutron-proton (n-p), proton-proton (p-p), and neutron-neutron (n-n) scattering\nat low energies. The constructed inverse potentials accurately reproduce the\nphase shifts reported in the literature and exhibit the expected features of\nnucleon-nucleon interactions, including a short-range repulsive core and an\nintermediate-range attractive well, with the n-p system showing the deepest\npotential minimum due to stronger binding.

Experimental results on our proposed Spurious\nToken Game (STG) benchmark and multiple downstream tasks demonstrate that our\napproach effectively leverages causal knowledge for prediction and remains\nrobust in OOD scenarios.

While existing approaches typically freeze the\nbackbone and fine-tune a small number of parameters to mitigate forgetting,\nthey still rely on iterative error backpropagation and gradient-based\noptimization, which can be computationally intensive and less suitable for\nresource-constrained environments. To address this, we propose FoRo, a\nforward-only, gradient-free continual learning method. FoRo consists of a\nlightweight prompt tuning strategy and a novel knowledge encoding mechanism,\nboth designed without modifying the pre-trained model. Specifically, prompt\nembeddings are inserted at the input layer and optimized using the Covariance\nMatrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES), which mitigates distribution\nshifts and extracts high-quality task representations. Subsequently,\ntask-specific knowledge is encoded into a knowledge encoding matrix via\nnonlinear random projection and recursive least squares, enabling incremental\nupdates to the classifier without revisiting prior data. Experiments show that\nFoRo significantly reduces average forgetting and improves accuracy. Thanks to\nforward-only learning, FoRo reduces memory usage and run time while maintaining\nhigh knowledge retention across long task sequences. These results suggest that\nFoRo could serve as a promising direction for exploring continual learning with\npre-trained models, especially in real-world multimedia applications where both\nefficiency and effectiveness are critical.",

In light of the 2018 Planck, BICEP/Keck and the recent Atacama\nCosmology Telescope data for the scalar spectral index and tensor-to-scalar\nratio, strong constraints on the coupling strength force the effects of these\nmodified theories to be, at most, slightly above the perturbative level.\nFurthermore, we determine that the choice of the perfect fluid matter\nLagrangian does not impact the inflationary observables at the pivot scale.\nFinally, we present the predicted observables for different inflationary\npotentials and show that even though classical gravity is still preferred by\nthe data, there are areas of the parameter space that are viable for\nnon-minimally coupled inflationary models.",

One such example is the Blume-Capel model, a\nthree-state spin model, whose phase diagram features a tricritical point where\nsecond-order and first-order transition lines converge, leading to a\ncoexistence of paramagnetic, ferromagnetic, and disordered phases. Here, we\nrealize an artificial crystal of single-domain nanomagnets, placed on the links\nof the Ruby lattice, enabling real-space observation of the Blume-Capel degrees\nof freedom. These Blume-Capel degrees of freedom are represented by the\npresence, sign and interactions of the toroidal moments that emerge naturally\nin plaquettes of nanomagnets in the Ruby artificial spin ice. By precisely\ntuning the lattice parameters of the Ruby artificial spin ice, we demonstrate\ncontrol over the two-step ordering process of the toroidal moments, whereby\nthere is a high-temperature crossover from a paramagnetic phase to an\nintermediate paratoroidic regime, followed by a second-order phase transition\nto a ferrotoroidic ground state. This sequence of toroidal phases and\ntransitions is accurately captured by the Blume-Capel framework and provides a\ndirect realization of a substantial portion of the phase diagram associated\nwith the model. This establishes a new platform for exploring exotic\nHamiltonians in terms of artificial spin ice superstructures, here with groups\nof nanomagnets forming toroidal moments.

The model's core lies in a\nutility function based on recursive deterrence theory and a network\nco-evolution mechanism connecting micro-decisions with macro-social structures.\nResearch findings indicate: \"Silence\" is an evolutionarily stable strategy; the\n\"Dark Forest\" state is merely a special case of system instability under\nextreme resource scarcity and high-density civilizations; civilizational\ninteractions spontaneously form structured social networks with small-world\nproperties; and a hypothetical \"Ultimate Civilization\" can effectively maintain\norder.

    "abstract": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems typically face constraints\nbecause of their inherent mechanism: a simple top-k semantic search [1]. The\napproach often leads to the incorporation of irrelevant or redundant\ninformation in the context, degrading performance and efficiency [10][11]. This\npaper presents MeVe, a novel modular architecture intended for Memory\nVerification and smart context composition. MeVe rethinks the RAG paradigm by\nproposing a five-phase modular design that distinctly breaks down the retrieval\nand context composition process into distinct, auditable, and independently\ntunable phases: initial retrieval, relevance verification, fallback retrieval,\ncontext prioritization, and token budgeting. This architecture enables\nfine-grained control of what knowledge is made available to an LLM, enabling\ntask-dependent filtering and adaptation. We release a reference implementation\nof MeVe as a proof of concept and evaluate its performance on knowledge-heavy\nQA tasks over a subset of English Wikipedia [22]. Our results demonstrate that\nby actively verifying information before composition, MeVe significantly\nimproves context efficiency, achieving a 57% reduction on the Wikipedia dataset\nand a 75% reduction on the more complex HotpotQA dataset compared to standard\nRAG implementations [25]. This work provides a framework for more scalable and\nreliable LLM applications.

    "abstract": "In clinical practice, automatic analysis of electrocardiogram (ECG) is widely\napplied to identify irregular heart rhythms and other electrical anomalies of\nthe heart, enabling timely intervention and potentially improving clinical\noutcomes. However, due to the limited samples in certain types of ECG signals,\nthe class imbalance issues pose a challenge for ECG-based detection. In\naddition, as the volume of patient data grows, long-term storage of all\nhistorical data becomes increasingly burdensome as training samples to\nrecognize new patterns and classify existing ECG signals accurately. Therefore,\nto enhance the performance of anomaly detection while addressing storage\nlimitations, we propose a pseudo-replay based semi-supervised continual\nlearning framework, which consists of two components: unsupervised\nidentification and replay-based detection. For unsupervised identification, an\nunsupervised generative adversarial network (GAN)-based framework is integrated\nto detect novel patterns. Besides, instead of directly storing all historical\ndata, a pseudo replay-based learning strategy is proposed which utilizes a\ngenerator to learn the data distribution for each individual task. When a new\ntask arises, the generator synthesizes pseudo data representative of previous\nlearnt classes, enabling the model to detect both the existed patterns and the\nnewly presented anomalies. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is\nvalidated in four public ECG datasets, which leverages supervised\nclassification problems for anomaly detection. The experimental results show\nthat the developed approach is very promising in identifying novel anomalies\nwhile maintaining good performance on detecting existing ECG signals.",

    "abstract": "Time-varying electricity pricing better reflects the varying cost of\nelectricity compared to flat-rate pricing. Variations between peak and off-peak\ncosts are increasing due to weather variation, renewable intermittency, and\nincreasing electrification of demand. Empirical and theoretical studies suggest\nthat variable pricing can lower electricity supply costs and reduce grid\nstress. However, the distributional impacts, particularly on low-income\nconsumers, remain understudied. This paper develops a theoretical framework to\nanalyze how consume heterogeneity affects welfare outcomes when electricity\nmarkets transition from flat-rate to time-varying pricing, considering\nrealistic assumptions about heterogeneous consumer demand, supply costs, and\nutility losses from unmet consumption.\n  We derive sufficient conditions for identifying when consumers lose utility\nfrom pricing reforms and compare welfare effects across consumer types. Our\nfindings reveal that consumer vulnerability depends on the interaction of\nconsumption timing, demand flexibility capabilities, and price sensitivity\nlevels. Consumers with high peak-period consumption and inflexible demand,\ncharacteristics often associated with low-income households, are most\nvulnerable to welfare losses. Critically, we demonstrate that demand\nflexibility provides welfare protection only when coincident with large price\nchanges. Our equilibrium analysis reveals that aggregate flexibility patterns\ngenerate spillover effects through pricing mechanisms, with peak periods\nexperiencing greater price changes when they have less aggregate flexibility,\npotentially concentrating larger price increases among vulnerable populations\nthat have a limited ability to respond. These findings suggest that variable\npricing policies should be accompanied by targeted policies ensuring equitable\naccess to demand response capabilities and pricing benefits.",

In this work, we develop the\nfirst quantum formulation for a portfolio optimization problem with\nhigher-order moments, skewness and kurtosis.

Portfolio\noptimization with higher-order moments has been studied in classical portfolio\noptimization approaches but with limited exploration within quantum\nformulations. In the context of quantum optimization, higher-order moments\ngenerate higher-order terms in the cost Hamiltonian. Thus, instead of obtaining\na quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problem, we obtain a higher-order\nunconstrained binary optimization (HUBO) problem, which has a natural\nformulation as a parametrized circuit.

Aims. Our goals are to estimate the fundamental\nparameters of both binary systems and their components. Methods. We performed\nfirst phase-resolved multi-band photometry of both objects with the 10.4-m Gran\nTelescopio Canarias and fitted the obtained light curves with a model assuming\ndirect heating of the companion by the pulsar. Archival X-ray data obtained\nwith the Swift and XMM-Newton observatories were also analysed. Results. For\nthe first time, we firmly identified both systems in the optical. Their optical\nlight curves show a rather symmetric single peak per orbital period and a\npeak-to-peak amplitude of $\\gtrsim$2 mag. We also identified the X-ray\ncounterpart to J1627$+$3219, while for J0312$-$0921 we set an upper limit on\nthe X-ray flux. Conclusions. We estimated the masses of the pulsars, companion\ntemperatures and masses, Roche lobe filling factors, orbital inclinations, and\nthe distances to both systems. PSR J0312$-$0921 has a very light ($\\approx$0.02\nM$_\\odot$) companion which possibly has one of the lowest ($\\approx$1600 K)\n`night-side' temperatures among the known black widow systems. We found that\nthe distances to J0312$-$0921 and J1627$+$3219 are about 2.5 and 4.6 kpc,\nrespectively. This likely explains their faintness in X-rays. The X-ray\nspectrum of PSR J1627$+$3219 can be described by the power-law model, and its\nparameters are compatible with those obtained for other black widows.",

Currently, the primary methods for point cloud processing are\nvoxel-based and pillarbased approaches. Voxel-based methods offer high accuracy\nthrough fine-grained spatial segmentation but suffer from slower inference\nspeeds. Pillar-based methods enhance inference speed but still fall short of\nvoxel-based methods in accuracy. To address these issues, we propose a novel\npoint cloud processing method, PointSlice, which slices point clouds along the\nhorizontal plane and includes a dedicated detection network. The main\ncontributions of PointSlice are: (1) A new point cloud processing technique\nthat converts 3D point clouds into multiple sets of 2D (x-y) data slices. The\nmodel only learns 2D data distributions, treating the 3D point cloud as\nseparate batches of 2D data, which reduces the number of model parameters and\nenhances inference speed; (2) The introduction of a Slice Interaction Network\n(SIN). To maintain vertical relationships across slices, we incorporate SIN\ninto the 2D backbone network, which improves the model's 3D object perception\ncapability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PointSlice achieves high\ndetection accuracy and inference speed. On the Waymo dataset, PointSlice is\n1.13x faster and has 0.79x fewer parameters than the state-of-the-art\nvoxel-based method (SAFDNet), with only a 1.2 mAPH accuracy reduction. On the\nnuScenes dataset, we achieve a state-of-the-art detection result of 66.74 mAP.\nOn the Argoverse 2 dataset, PointSlice is 1.10x faster, with 0.66x fewer\nparameters and a 1.0 mAP accuracy reduction. The code will be available at\nhttps://github.com/qifeng22/PointSlice2.",

We identified 2257 dense cores using the getsources algorithm, of which\n59% are starless, and 41% are potentially protostellar. 71% of the starless\ncores are prestellar core candidates, suggesting a prestellar core lifetime\nsimilar to that of Class 0/I YSOs. Higher-mass clouds have a higher fraction of\nprestellar cores compared to protostars, suggesting a longer average prestellar\ncore lifetime. We assessed completeness by inserting critically-stable\nBonnor--Ebert spheres into a blank SCUBA-2 field: completeness scales as\ndistance squared, with an average mass recovery fraction of $73\\pm6$% for\nrecovered sources. We calculated core masses and radii, and assessed their\ngravitational stability using the Bonnor-Ebert criterion. Maximum starless core\nmass scales with cloud complex mass with an index $0.58\\pm 0.13$, consistent\nwith the behaviour of maximum stellar masses in embedded clusters. We performed\nleast-squares and Monte Carlo modelling of the core mass functions (CMFs) of\nour starless and prestellar core samples.

Here, we\npresent a new paradigm for engineering robust FQH phases in OFLs using only two\ninternal atomic states.

The existing\nmethods require motion data annotated with high-level descriptions (e.g.,\n``jumping jacks\"). However, such data is rarely available in existing\nmotion-text datasets, which additionally do not include low-level motion\ndescriptions. To address this, we propose a two-step hierarchical approach.\nFirst, we employ large language models to create detailed descriptions\ncorresponding to each high-level caption that appears in the motion-text\ndatasets (e.g., ``jumping while synchronizing arm extensions with the opening\nand closing of legs\" for ``jumping jacks\"). These refined annotations are used\nto retrain motion-to-text models to produce captions with low-level details.\nSecond, we introduce a pioneering retrieval-based mechanism. It aligns the\ndetailed low-level captions with candidate high-level captions from additional\ntext data sources, and combine them with motion features to fabricate precise\nhigh-level captions. Our methodology is distinctive in its ability to harness\nknowledge from external text sources to greatly increase motion captioning\naccuracy, especially for movements not covered in existing motion-text\ndatasets.

    "abstract": "Recent studies indicate that robotic coaches can play a crucial role in\npromoting wellbeing. However, the real-world deployment of wellbeing robots\nraises numerous ethical and socio-technical questions and concerns. To explore\nthese questions, we undertake a community-centered investigation to examine\nthree different communities' perspectives on using robotic wellbeing coaches in\nreal-world environments. We frame our work as an anticipatory ethical\ninvestigation, which we undertake to better inform the development of robotic\ntechnologies with communities' opinions, with the ultimate goal of aligning\nrobot development with public interest. We conducted workshops with three\ncommunities who are under-represented in robotics development: 1) members of\nthe public at a science festival, 2) women computer scientists at a conference,\nand 3) humanities researchers interested in history and philosophy of science.\nIn the workshops, we collected qualitative data using the Social Robot\nCo-Design Canvas on Ethics. We analysed the collected qualitative data with\nThematic Analysis, informed by notes taken during workshops. Through our\nanalysis, we identify four themes regarding key ethical and socio-technical\nquestions about the real-world use of wellbeing robots. We group participants'\ninsights and discussions around these broad thematic questions, discuss them in\nlight of state-of-the-art literature, and highlight areas for future\ninvestigation. Finally, we provide the four questions as a broad framework that\nroboticists can and should use during robotic development and deployment, in\norder to reflect on the ethics and socio-technical dimensions of their robotic\napplications, and to engage in dialogue with communities of robot users. The\nfour questions are: 1) Is the robot safe and how can we know that?, 2) Who is\nthe robot built for and with?, 3) Who owns the robot and the data?, and 4) Why\na robot?.",

While 5G AKA improves upon previous generations by concealing\nsubscriber identities, it remains vulnerable to replay-based synchronization\nand linkability threats under realistic adversary models. This paper provides a\nunified analysis of the standardized 5G AKA flow, identifying several\nvulnerabilities and highlighting how each exploits protocol behavior to\ncompromise user privacy. To address these risks, we present five lightweight\nmitigation strategies. We demonstrate through prototype implementation and\ntesting that these enhancements strengthen resilience against linkability\nattacks with minimal computational and signaling overhead. Among the solutions\nstudied, those introducing a UE-generated nonce emerge as the most promising,\neffectively neutralizing the identified tracking and correlation attacks with\nnegligible additional overhead.

Classical reconstruction methods like multi-view stereo\nonly reconstruct the visible hair strands, missing the inner structure of\nhairstyles and hampering realistic hair simulation. To address this, existing\nmethods leverage hairstyle priors trained on synthetic data. Such data,\nhowever, is limited in both quantity and quality since it requires manual work\nfrom skilled artists to model the 3D hairstyles and create near-photorealistic\nrenderings. To address this, we propose a novel approach that uses both, real\nand synthetic data to learn an effective hairstyle prior. Specifically, we\ntrain a transformer-based prior model on synthetic data to obtain knowledge of\nthe internal hairstyle geometry and introduce real data in the learning process\nto model the outer structure. This training scheme is able to model the visible\nhair strands depicted in an input image, while preserving the general 3D\nstructure of hairstyles. We exploit this prior to create a\nGaussian-splatting-based reconstruction method that creates hairstyles from one\nor more images. Qualitative and quantitative comparisons with existing\nreconstruction pipelines demonstrate the effectiveness and superior performance\nof our method for capturing detailed hair orientation, overall silhouette, and\nbackside consistency.

This paper\nintroduces an applied methodology for robust, one-shot hallucination detection,\nspecifically designed for scenarios with limited data access, such as\ninteracting with black-box LLM APIs that typically expose only a few top\ncandidate log-probabilities per token. Our approach derives uncertainty\nindicators directly from these readily available log-probabilities generated\nduring non-greedy decoding.

Our learned model uses features representing the entropic\ncontributions of the accessible top-ranked tokens within a single generated\nsequence, requiring no multiple query re-runs. Evaluated across diverse QA\ndatasets and multiple LLMs, this estimator significantly improves hallucination\ndetection over using EPR alone.

While\nsemantic technologies have progressed in commercial building and DR domains,\ncurrent ontologies have two critical limitations: they are often developed\nwithout a formal framework that reflects real-world DR requirements, and\nproposals for integrating general and application-specific ontologies remain\nmostly conceptual, lacking formalization or empirical validation.\n  In this paper, we address these gaps by applying a formal ontology\nevaluation/development approach to define the informational requirements (IRs)\nnecessary for semantic interoperability in the area of incentive-based DR for\ncommercial buildings. We identify the IRs associated with each stage of the\nwholesale incentive-based DR process, focusing on the perspective of building\nowners. Using these IRs, we evaluate how well existing ontologies (Brick,\nDELTA, and EFOnt) support the operational needs of DR participation.

    "abstract": "This paper studies an optimal control problem for an adoption-opinion model\nthat couples innovation adoption with opinion formation on a multilayer\nnetwork. Adoption spreads through social contagion and perceived benefits,\nwhile opinions evolve via social interactions and feedback from adoption\nlevels. Individuals may abandon adoption due to dissatisfaction or external\nconstraints, potentially hindering diffusion. We analyze system equilibria and\ntheir stability, identifying conditions under which adoption persists. We\nintroduce a Model Predictive Control (MPC) strategy that dynamically adapts\ninterventions to the predicted system evolution. Three types of control are\ncompared: shaping opinions, acting on the adoption rate, and reducing\ndissatisfaction. Overall, MPC interventions outperform static constant control,\nachieving higher adoption at comparable or lower cost. These results highlight\nthe potential of predictive, adaptive strategies to support sustainable\nbehavior diffusion, offering policymakers scalable tools for effective\ninterventions.",

    "abstract": "In high harmonic generation (HHG), non-dipole effects become increasingly\nsignificant at long driving wavelengths, as the magnetic field leads to a\nlateral drift of the continuum electron, which disrupts the electron\nrecollision and inhibits the harmonic emission. To address this problem, we\nrevisit the dynamics of the continuum electrons under electromagnetic fields in\nthe HHG process and show that the magnetic effect on the drift includes a\nfundamental-frequency and a double-frequency component. By adding an additional\nfield to counteract the double-frequency effect caused by the magnetic field,\nwe construct an effective linearly polarized field that recovers the\nrecollision of all returning electrons to the parent ion. Consequently, the\nharmonic yield is restored and becomes the same as the result within the dipole\napproximation across the broad spectral range. This work provides a scheme that\ncompletely suppresses the non-dipole drift effect and fully compensates for the\nharmonic yield reduction, paving the way to efficiently generate coherent\nradiation in the range from extreme ultraviolet to soft x-ray and ultrashort\npulses based on HHG.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we derive a perturbatively-corrected instanton rate theory in\nthe ring-polymer framework (RPI+PC), which significantly enhances the accuracy\nof instanton theory by using third and fourth derivatives of the potential to\ncapture anharmonic effects. Instanton theory is a rigorous semiclassical method\nthat extends transition-state theory by including quantum tunneling along a\nwell-defined optimal tunneling pathway. However, the standard leading-order\ninstanton theory (RPI) neglects anharmonicity perpendicular to this tunneling\npath. The RPI+PC method described here corrects this using only local\ninformation along the same instanton trajectory as the leading-order theory.\nHence, RPI+PC does not require a global potential energy surface and is readily\napplicable in combination with ab initio electronic-structure methods. The\nderivation of the RPI+PC result is performed within the flux-correlation\nformalism using standard techniques from asymptotic analysis, and the final\nrate expression is shown to be independent of the choice of dividing surface.\nWe demonstrate that RPI+PC represents a systematic improvement over RPI by\nanalyzing its asymptotic properties in the semiclassical limit ($\\hbar\\to0$\nwith total thermal time $\\tau^{\\mathrm{tot}}=\\beta\\hbar$ kept constant) and\nillustrate its improved performance on a series of model systems for which\nexact results are available for comparison, including the collinear H+H$_2$\nreaction and its isotopic variants.",

Moreover, it is demonstrated that within\nspecific ground states, the degree of entanglement primarily depends on the\nstrength of single-ion anisotropy, altering the respective probability\namplitudes of the corresponding eigenvectors.

Building\non Chain-of-Thought (CoT) ideology, Large Reasoning models (LRMs) further\nexhibit strong reasoning skills, enabling them to infer user intent more\naccurately and respond appropriately. However, both LLMs and LRMs face the\npotential safety risks under jailbreak attacks, which raise concerns about\ntheir safety capabilities. Current safety evaluation methods often focus on the\ncontent dimensions, or simply aggregate different attack methods, lacking\nconsideration of the complexity. In fact, instructions of different complexity\ncan reflect the different safety capabilities of the model: simple instructions\ncan reflect the basic values of the model, while complex instructions can\nreflect the model's ability to deal with deeper safety risks. Therefore, a\ncomprehensive benchmark needs to be established to evaluate the safety\nperformance of the model in the face of instructions of varying complexity,\nwhich can provide a better understanding of the safety boundaries of the LLMs.\nThus, this paper first quantifies \"Reasoning Complexity\" as an evaluable safety\ndimension and categorizes 15 jailbreak attack methods into three different\nlevels according to the reasoning complexity, establishing a hierarchical\nChinese-English jailbreak safety benchmark for systematically evaluating the\nsafety performance of LLMs. Meanwhile, to fully utilize unique language\ncharacteristics, we first propose some Chinese jailbreak attack methods,\nincluding the Chinese Character Disassembly attack, Lantern Riddle attack, and\nAcrostic Poem attack.

While significant progress has been made in detecting falls,\nthe prediction of falls before they happen, and analysis of the transient state\nbetween stability and an impending fall remain unexplored. In this paper, we\npropose a anticipatory fall detection method that utilizes a hybrid model\ncombining Dynamic Graph Neural Networks (DGNN) with Long Short-Term Memory\n(LSTM) networks that decoupled the motion prediction and gait classification\ntasks to anticipate falls with high accuracy. Our approach employs real-time\nskeletal features extracted from video sequences as input for the proposed\nmodel. The DGNN acts as a classifier, distinguishing between three gait states:\nstable, transient, and fall. The LSTM-based network then predicts human\nmovement in subsequent time steps, enabling early detection of falls. The\nproposed model was trained and validated using the OUMVLP-Pose and URFD\ndatasets, demonstrating superior performance in terms of prediction error and\nrecognition accuracy compared to models relying solely on DGNN and models from\nliterature. The results indicate that decoupling prediction and classification\nimproves performance compared to addressing the unified problem using only the\nDGNN. Furthermore, our method allows for the monitoring of the transient state,\noffering valuable insights that could enhance the functionality of advanced\nassistance systems.",

The extended lifecycle of FLL in IoT systems increases their\nvulnerability to persistent attacks, and these risks may be obscured by\nperformance degradation caused by spatial-temporal data heterogeneity.\nMoreover, this problem is exacerbated by the standard single-server\narchitecture, as its single point of failure makes it difficult to maintain a\nreliable audit trail for long-term threats.

They are episodes in which the X-ray luminosity of a strongly\nmagnetised neutron star swiftly rises by several orders of magnitude to then\ndecay over the course of several months. In this work, we present simulations\nof outbursts as a consequence of localised heat deposition in a magnetised\nneutron star crust, and the subsequent surface cooling. In particular, we\nemployed a magnetothermal evolution code adapted to the study of short-term\nphenomena; that is, one including in its integration domain the outer layers of\nthe star, where heat diffusion is faster. This choice entailed the development\nand use of heat blanketing envelope models that are thinner than those found in\nthe literature as the surface boundary ondition. We find that such envelopes\ncan support a higher surface temperature than the thicker ones (albeit for less\ntime), which can account for the typical luminosities observed in outbursts\neven when coming from small hotspots (few km in radius). We study several\nparameters related to the energetics and geometry of the heating region,\nconcluding that the cooling of a crustal hotspot found in the outer part of the\ncrust can account for the luminosity evolution observed in outbursts both in\nterms of peak luminosity and timescales. Finally, we discuss the key\nobservables that must be studied in future observations to better constrain the\nnature of the underlying mechanism.",

Ferber and Krivelevich (Adv. Math., 2022) confirmed the\nconjecture.

We prove that if $G$ has no isolated vertices, it contains such a\nsubgraph of order linear in $n$.\n  The well-known Gallai's Theorem states that the vertices of each graph can be\npartitioned into two parts such that all vertices in the subgraphs induced by\nthe two parts have even degrees. The result also holds if we require that the\ndegrees of all vertices in one of the induced subgraphs are even, and the\ndegrees of all vertices in the other induced subgraph are odd.

    "abstract": "With the rapid development of low-altitude wireless networking, autonomous\naerial vehicles (AAVs) have emerged as critical enablers for timely and\nreliable data delivery, particularly in remote or underserved areas. In this\ncontext, the age of information (AoI) has emerged as a critical performance\nmetric for evaluating the freshness and timeliness of transmitted information\nin Internet of things (IoT) networks. However, conventional AAV-assisted data\ntransmission is fundamentally limited by finite communication coverage ranges,\nwhich requires periodic return flights for data relay operations. This\npropulsion-repositioning cycle inevitably introduces latency spikes that raise\nthe AoI while degrading service reliability. To address these challenges, this\npaper proposes a AAV-assisted forwarding system based on distributed\nbeamforming to enhance the AoI in IoT. Specifically, AAVs collaborate via\ndistributed beamforming to collect and relay data between the sensor nodes and\nremote base station. Then, we formulate an optimization problem to minimize the\nAoI and AAV energy consumption, by jointly optimizing the AAV trajectories and\ncommunication schedules. Due to the non-convex nature of the problem and its\npronounced temporal variability, we introduce a deep reinforcement learning\nsolution that incorporates temporal sequence input, layer normalization gated\nrecurrent unit, and a squeeze-and-excitation block to capture long-term\ndependencies, thereby improving decision-making stability and accuracy, and\nreducing computational complexity. Simulation results demonstrate that the\nproposed SAC-TLS algorithm outperforms baseline algorithms in terms of\nconvergence, time average AoI, and energy consumption of AAVs.",

In fact, the key challenge in generating\nvariable-scale images lies in the differing amounts of information across\nresolutions, which requires information conversion procedures to be varied for\ngenerating variable-scaled images. In this paper, we investigate the issues of\nthree critical aspects in DMs for a unified analysis in variable-scaled\ngeneration: dilated convolution, attention mechanisms, and initial noise.\nSpecifically, 1) dilated convolution in DMs for the higher-resolution\ngeneration loses high-frequency information. 2) Attention for variable-scaled\nimage generation struggles to adjust the information aggregation adaptively. 3)\nThe spatial distribution of information in the initial noise is misaligned with\nvariable-scaled image. To solve the above problems, we propose\n\\textbf{InfoScale}, an information-centric framework for variable-scaled image\ngeneration by effectively utilizing information from three aspects\ncorrespondingly. For information loss in 1), we introduce Progressive Frequency\nCompensation module to compensate for high-frequency information lost by\ndilated convolution in higher-resolution generation. For information\naggregation inflexibility in 2), we introduce Adaptive Information Aggregation\nmodule to adaptively aggregate information in lower-resolution generation and\nachieve an effective balance between local and global information in\nhigher-resolution generation.

Unlike traditional\nquestionnaires, EEG does not interrupt the experience or rely on users'\nretrospective self-reports, thereby avoiding interference with the very state\nit aims to capture. Previous research has attempted to quantify presence in\nvirtual environments using event-related potentials (ERPs). We contend,\nhowever, that previous efforts have fallen short of fully realizing this goal,\nfailing to either A) independently manipulate presence, B) validate their\nmeasure of presence against traditional techniques, C) adequately separate the\nconstructs of presence and attention, and/or D) implement a realistic and\nimmersive environment and task. We address these shortcomings in a\npreregistered ERP experiment in which participants play an engaging target\nshooting game in VR. ERPs are time-locked to the release of a ball from a\nsling. We induce breaks in presence (BIPs) by freezing the ball's release on a\nminority of trials. Embodiment is manipulated by allowing manual manipulation\nof the sling with a realistic avatar in one condition (embodied condition) and\npassive manipulation with only controllers in another (non-embodied condition).\nWe support our predictions that the N2, the P3b, and the N400, are selectively\nsensitive towards specific components of these manipulations.

We introduce a Minimal-Data\nParametric Neural Operator Preconditioning (MD-PNOP) framework, which\nestablishes a new paradigm for accelerating parametric PDE solvers while\nstrictly preserving physical constraints. The key idea is to recast the\nresidual from parameter deviation as additional source term, where any trained\nneural operator can be used to refine the solution in an offline fashion. This\ndirectly addresses the fundamental extrapolation limitation of neural\noperators, enabling extrapolative generalization of any neural operator trained\nat a single parameter setting across a wide range of configurations without any\nretraining. The neural operator predictions are then embedded into iterative\nPDE solvers as improved initial guesses, thereby reducing convergence\niterations without sacrificing accuracy. Unlike purely data-driven approaches,\nMD-PNOP guarantees that the governing equations remain fully enforced,\neliminating concerns about loss of physics or interpretability. The framework\nis architecture-agnostic and is demonstrated using both Deep Operator Networks\n(DeepONet) and Fourier Neural Operators (FNO) for Boltzmann transport equation\nsolvers in neutron transport applications. We demonstrated that neural\noperators trained on a single set of constant parameters successfully\naccelerate solutions with heterogeneous, sinusoidal, and discontinuous\nparameter distributions.

    "abstract": "As obesity rates continue to increase, automated calorie tracking has become\na vital tool for people seeking to maintain a healthy lifestyle or adhere to a\ndiet plan. Although numerous research efforts have addressed this issue,\nexisting approaches often face key limitations, such as providing only constant\ncaloric output, struggling with multiple food recognition challenges,\nchallenges in image scaling and normalization, and a predominant focus on\nWestern cuisines. In this paper, we propose a tailored solution that\nspecifically targets Bangladeshi street food. We first construct a diverse\ndataset of popular street foods found across Bangladesh. Then, we develop a\nrefined calorie estimation system by modifying the state-of-the-art vision\nmodel YOLOv8. Our modified model achieves superior classification and\nsegmentation results, with only a slight increase in computational complexity\ncompared to the base variant. Coupled with a machine learning regression model,\nour system achieves an impressive 6.94 mean absolute error (MAE), 11.03 root\nmean squared error (RMSE), and a 96.0% R^2 score in calorie estimation, making\nit both highly effective and accurate for real-world food calorie calculations.",

    "abstract": "In the mobile internet era, managing limited attention amid information\noverload is crucial for enhancing collaboration and information delivery.\nHowever, current attention-aware systems often depend on wearables or\npersonalized data, limiting their scalability and cross-context adaptability.\nInspired by psychological theories, we attempt to treat mobile notifications as\nnaturally occurring external distractions and infer users' attention states\nbased on their response behaviors and contextual information. Our goal is to\nbuild an attention-aware model that does not rely on personalized historical\ndata or complex subjective input, while ensuring strong cold-start capability\nand cross-context adaptability. To this end, We design a field study framework\nintegrating subjective and objective data, closely aligned with real-world\nexternal distractions (i.e., mobile notifications). Through field studies, we\nconstruct a fine-grained and interpretable dataset centered on the relationship\namong current context - external distractions - subjective attention. Through\nour field studies, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the relationships among\nusers' response behaviors, response motivations, contextual information, and\nattention states. Building on our findings, we propose AttenTrack, a\nlightweight, privacy-friendly attention awareness model with strong cold-start\ncapability. The model relies solely on non-privacy-sensitive objective data\navailable on mobile devices, and can be applied to a variety of attention\nmanagement tasks. In addition, we will publicly release the constructed dataset\nto support future research and advance the field of mobile attention awareness.",

    "abstract": "Given a graph $G = (V,E)$, a set $T$ of vertex pairs, and an integer $k$,\nHitting Geodesic Intervals asks whether there is a set $S \\subseteq V$ of size\nat most $k$ such that for each terminal pair $\\{u,v\\} \\in T$, the set $S$\nintersects at least one shortest $u$-$v$ path. Aravind and Saxena [WALCOM 2024]\nintroduced this problem and showed several parameterized complexity results. In\nthis paper, we extend the known results in both negative and positive\ndirections and present sharp complexity contrasts with respect to structural\ngraph parameters.\n  We first show that the problem is NP-complete even on graphs obtained by\nadding a single vertex to a disjoint union of 5-vertex paths. By modifying the\nproof of this result, we also show the NP-completeness on graphs obtained from\na path by adding one vertex and on graphs obtained from a disjoint union of\ntriangles by adding one universal vertex. Furthermore, we show the\nNP-completeness on graphs of bandwidth 4 and maximum degree 5 by replacing the\nuniversal vertex in the last case with a long path. Under standard complexity\nassumptions, these negative results rule out fixed-parameter algorithms for\nmost of the structural parameters studied in the literature (if the solution\nsize $k$ is not part of the parameter).\n  We next present fixed-parameter algorithms parameterized by $k$ plus\nmodular-width and by $k$ plus vertex integrity. The algorithm for the latter\ncase does indeed solve a more general setting that includes the\nparameterization by the minimum vertex multiway-cut size of the terminal\nvertices. We show that this is tight in the sense that the problem\nparameterized by the minimum vertex multicut size of the terminal pairs is\nW[2]-complete. We then modify the proof of this intractability result and show\nthat the problem is W[2]-complete parameterized by $k$ even in the setting\nwhere $T = \\binom{Q}{2}$ for some $Q \\subseteq V$.",

MILO is trained using pseudo-MOS (Mean Opinion Score)\nsupervision, in which reproducible distortions are applied to diverse images\nand scored via an ensemble of recent quality metrics that account for visual\nmasking effects. This approach enables accurate learning without requiring\nlarge-scale human-labeled datasets. Despite its compact architecture, MILO\noutperforms existing metrics across standard FR-IQA benchmarks and offers fast\ninference suitable for real-time applications. Beyond quality prediction, we\ndemonstrate the utility of MILO as a perceptual loss in both image and latent\ndomains. In particular, we show that spatial masking modeled by MILO, when\napplied to latent representations from a VAE encoder within Stable Diffusion,\nenables efficient and perceptually aligned optimization. By combining spatial\nmasking with a curriculum learning strategy, we first process perceptually less\nrelevant regions before progressively shifting the optimization to more\nvisually distorted areas. This strategy leads to significantly improved\nperformance in tasks like denoising, super-resolution, and face restoration,\nwhile also reducing computational overhead. MILO thus functions as both a\nstate-of-the-art image quality metric and as a practical tool for perceptual\noptimization in generative pipelines.",

Using four publicly available credit scoring\ndatasets, we first assess the discriminatory power and cost-efficiency of IDCS\nclassifiers, introducing a novel metric to enhance cross-dataset comparability.\nWe then investigate the stability of SHAP and LIME feature importance rankings\nunder varying degrees of class imbalance through controlled resampling.

The key observation is that $\\mathcal{N}=2$ AdS$_4$ supergroup\n$OSp(2|4)$ can be embedded as a subgroup in the superconformal group through\nintroducing a constant symmetric matrix $c^{(ij)}$ and identifying the AdS\nsupercharge as $\\Psi^i_\\alpha = Q^i_\\alpha + c^{ik} S_{k\\alpha}$, with $Q$ and\n$S$ being generators of the standard and conformal $4D, {\\cal N}=2$\nsupersymmetries. Respectively, the AdS cosmological constant is given by the\nsquare of $c^{(ij)}$, $\\Lambda = -6 c^{ij}c_{ij}$. We construct the $OSp(2|4)$\ninvariant hypermultiplet mass term by adding, to the coordinate AdS\ntransformations, a piece realized as an extra $SO(2)$ rotation of the\nhypermultiplet superfield.

We frame the distilled model as a probabilistic\ncircuit, and show that it preserves expressiveness of the VQ-VAE while\nproviding tractable probabilistic inference. Experiments illustrate competitive\nperformance in density estimation and conditional generation tasks, challenging\nthe view of the VQ-VAE as an inherently intractable model.",

This paper proposes CabinSep, a lightweight neural\nmask-based minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) speech separation\napproach, to reduce speech recognition errors in back-end automatic speech\nrecognition (ASR) models. Our contributions are threefold: First, we utilize\nchannel information to extract spatial features, which improves the estimation\nof speech and noise masks. Second, we employ MVDR during inference, reducing\nspeech distortion to make it more ASR-friendly. Third, we introduce a data\naugmentation method combining simulated and real-recorded impulse responses\n(IRs), improving speaker localization at zone boundaries and further reducing\nspeech recognition errors. With a computational complexity of only 0.4 GMACs,\nCabinSep achieves a 17.5% relative reduction in speech recognition error rate\nin a real-recorded dataset compared to the state-of-the-art DualSep model.\nDemos are available at: https://cabinsep.github.io/cabinsep/.",

A Morse sequence on a simplicial\ncomplex consists of a sequence of nested subcomplexes generated by expansions\nand fillings-two operations originally introduced by Whitehead. Expansions\npreserve homotopy, while fillings introduce critical simplexes that capture\nessential topological features. We extend the notion of Morse sequences to\n\\emph{stacks}, which are monotonic functions defined on simplicial complexes,\nand define \\emph{Morse sequences on stacks} as those whose expansions preserve\nthe homotopy of all sublevel sets. This extension leads to a generalization of\nthe fundamental collapse theorem to weighted simplicial complexes. Within this\nframework, we focus on a refined class of sequences called \\emph{flooding\nsequences}, which exhibit an ordering behavior similar to that of classical\nwatershed algorithms. Although not every Morse sequence on a stack is a\nflooding sequence, we show that the gradient vector field associated with any\nMorse sequence can be recovered through a flooding sequence.

    "abstract": "Partially Relevant Video Retrieval (PRVR) aims to retrieve untrimmed videos\npartially relevant to a given query. The core challenge lies in learning robust\nquery-video alignment against spurious semantic correlations arising from\ninherent data uncertainty: 1) query ambiguity, where the query incompletely\ncharacterizes the target video and often contains uninformative tokens, and 2)\npartial video relevance, where abundant query-irrelevant segments introduce\ncontextual noise in cross-modal alignment. Existing methods often focus on\nenhancing multi-scale clip representations and retrieving the most relevant\nclip. However, the inherent data uncertainty in PRVR renders them vulnerable to\ndistractor videos with spurious similarities, leading to suboptimal\nperformance. To fill this research gap, we propose Robust Alignment Learning\n(RAL) framework, which explicitly models the uncertainty in data. Key\ninnovations include: 1) we pioneer probabilistic modeling for PRVR by encoding\nvideos and queries as multivariate Gaussian distributions. This not only\nquantifies data uncertainty but also enables proxy-level matching to capture\nthe variability in cross-modal correspondences; 2) we consider the\nheterogeneous informativeness of query words and introduce learnable confidence\ngates to dynamically weight similarity. As a plug-and-play solution, RAL can be\nseamlessly integrated into the existing architectures. Extensive experiments\nacross diverse retrieval backbones demonstrate its effectiveness.",

To understand perceived risk, an experiment was conducted\nusing a driving simulator under two automated driving styles and optionally\nintroducing a crossing pedestrian. Data was collected from 32 participants,\nconsisting of continuous subjective comfort ratings, motion, webcam footage for\nfacial expression, skin conductance, heart rate, and eye tracking. The\ncontinuous subjective perceived risk ratings showed significant discomfort\nassociated with perceived risk during cornering and braking followed by relief\nor even positive comfort on continuing the ride. The dynamic driving style\ninduced a stronger discomfort as compared to the calm driving style. The\ncrossing pedestrian did not affect discomfort with the calm driving style but\ndoubled the comfort decrement with the dynamic driving style. This illustrates\nthe importance of consequences of critical interactions in risk perception.\nFacial expression was successfully analyzed for 24 participants but most\n(15/24) did not show any detectable facial reaction to the critical event.\nAmong the 9 participants who did, 8 showed a Happy expression, and only 4\nshowed a Surprise expression. Fear was never dominant. This indicates that\nfacial expression recognition is not a reliable method for assessing perceived\nrisk in automated vehicles. To predict perceived risk a neural network model\nwas implemented using vehicle motion and skin conductance.

It\ncompares new posts with real examples of hate speech and neutral content, uses\na BERT-based classifier to help flag harmful messages, looks up slang and\ninformal language using sources like Urban Dictionary, generates\nchain-of-thought reasoning, and checks platform guidelines to explain and\nsupport its decisions. This combination allows the chatbot not only to detect\nhate speech but to explain why content is considered harmful, grounded in both\nprecedent and policy.

Among these mechanisms, interspecies\nrecognition enables cells to modulate their movement based on the ecological\nidentity of neighboring species. Here, we introduce a model in which we assume\nbacterial species recognizes each other and interact via local signals that\neither enhance or suppress the motility of neighboring cells. Through\nlarge-scale simulations and a coarse-grained stochastic model, we demonstrate\nthe emergence of a sharp transition driven by nucleation processes: increasing\nthe density of motility-suppressing interactions drives the system from a fully\nmixed, motile phase to a state characterized by large, stationary bacterial\nclusters. Remarkably, in systems with a large number of interacting species,\nthis transition can be triggered solely by altering the structure of the\nmotility-regulation interaction matrix while maintaining species and\ninteraction densities constant. In particular, we find that heterogeneous and\nmodular interactions promote the transition more readily than homogeneous\nrandom ones. These results contribute to the ongoing effort to understand\nmicrobial interactions, suggesting that structured, non-random ones may be key\nto reproducing commonly observed spatial patterns in microbial communities.",

We source two publicly\navailable, identically initialized Qwen2.5 models, one fine-tuned with\nsupervised fine-tuning (SFT) and the other with group relative policy\noptimization (GRPO) on the same dataset.

Our method exploits the Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE)\nto identify the causal impact and serve as a generative predictor. We are able\nto reduce confounding bias by identifying causally sensitive features. We\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our method by recommending the most likely\nlocations a user will visit next in their spatiotemporal trajectory influenced\nby the causal relationships among various features. Experiments on the\nlarge-scale GeoLife [Zheng et al., 2010] dataset and the benchmark Asia\nBayesian network validate the ability of our method to identify causal impact\nand improve predictive performance.",

This paper shows the\nnovel result that the bootstrap can detect such violation by means of simple\nand powerful tests which (a) induce no pre-testing bias, (b) can be performed\nusing the same critical values in a broad range of applications, and (c) are\nconsistent against deviations from asymptotic normality. By focusing on the\ndiscrepancy between the conditional distribution of a bootstrap statistic and\nthe (limiting) Gaussian distribution which obtains under valid specification,\nwe show how to assess whether this discrepancy is large enough to indicate\nspecification invalidity. The method, which is computationally straightforward,\nonly requires to measure the discrepancy between the bootstrap and the Gaussian\ndistributions based on a sample of i.i.d. draws of the bootstrap statistic. We\nderive sufficient conditions for the randomness in the data to mix with the\nrandomness in the bootstrap repetitions in a way such that (a), (b) and (c)\nabove hold. To demonstrate the practical relevance and broad applicability of\nour diagnostic procedure, we discuss five scenarios where the asymptotic\nGaussian approximation may fail: (i) weak instruments in instrumental variable\nregression; (ii) non-stationarity in autoregressive time series; (iii)\nparameters near or at the boundary of the parameter space; (iv) infinite\nvariance innovations in a location model for i.i.d. data; (v) invalidity of the\ndelta method due to (near-)rank deficiency in the implied Jacobian matrix.

Parameter-efficient\nfine-tuning (PEFT), such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), reduces local computing\nand memory overhead, making it attractive for federated learning. However,\nexisting federated LoRA methods typically assume uniform rank configurations\nand unimodal inputs, overlooking two key real-world challenges: (1)\nheterogeneous client resources have different LoRA ranks, and (2) multimodal\ndata settings with potentially missing modalities. In this work, we propose\nFediLoRA, a simple yet effective framework for federated multimodal fine-tuning\nunder heterogeneous LoRA ranks and missing modalities. FediLoRA introduces a\ndimension-wise aggregation strategy that reweights LoRA updates without\ninformation dilution during aggregation. It also includes a lightweight\nlayer-wise model editing method that selectively incorporates global parameters\nto repair local components which improves both client and global model\nperformances. Experimental results on three multimodal benchmark datasets\ndemonstrate that FediLoRA achieves superior performance over competitive\nbaselines in both global and personalized settings, particularly in the\npresence of modality incompleteness.",

Moreover, fine-tuning LLMs/VLMs requires\nsignificant computational resources, and for many high-performing general-use\nproprietary models (e.g., GPT or Gemini), fine-tuning access is not available.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel part retrieval framework that requires no\nextra training, but using Error Notebooks + RAG for refined prompt engineering\nto help improve the existing general model's retrieval performance. The\nconstruction of Error Notebooks consists of two steps: (1) collecting\nhistorical erroneous CoTs and their incorrect answers, and (2) connecting these\nCoTs through reflective corrections until the correct solutions are obtained.\nAs a result, the Error Notebooks serve as a repository of tasks along with\ntheir corrected CoTs and final answers. RAG is then employed to retrieve\nspecification-relevant records from the Error Notebooks and incorporate them\ninto the inference process. Another major contribution of our work is a\nhuman-in-the-loop CAD dataset, which is used to evaluate our method. In\naddition, the engineering value of our novel framework lies in its ability to\neffectively handle 3D models with lengthy, non-natural language metadata.\nExperiments with proprietary models, including GPT-4o and the Gemini series,\nshow substantial gains, with GPT-4o (Omni) achieving up to a 23.4% absolute\naccuracy improvement on the human preference dataset.

Nonetheless, many\nrecent approaches still rely on off-the-shelf loss functions, and even the more\nadvanced ones merely involve optimization processes based on the critical\nsuccess index (CSI). The problem, however, is that CSI may become ineffective\nduring extended dry periods when precipitation remains below the threshold,\nrendering it less than ideal as a criterion for optimization.

    "abstract": "We consider the problem of quantitative predictive monitoring (QPM) of\nstochastic systems, i.e., predicting at runtime the degree of satisfaction of a\ndesired temporal logic property from the current state of the system. Since\ncomputational efficiency is key to enable timely intervention against predicted\nviolations, several state-of-the-art QPM approaches rely on fast\nmachine-learning surrogates to provide prediction intervals for the\nsatisfaction values, using conformal inference to offer statistical guarantees.\nHowever, these QPM methods suffer when the monitored agent exhibits multi-modal\ndynamics, whereby certain modes may yield high satisfaction values while others\ncritically violate the property. Existing QPM methods are mode-agnostic and so\nwould yield overly conservative and uninformative intervals that lack\nmeaningful mode-specific satisfaction information. To address this problem, we\npresent GenQPM, a method that leverages deep generative models, specifically\nscore-based diffusion models, to reliably approximate the probabilistic and\nmulti-modal system dynamics without requiring explicit model access. GenQPM\nemploys a mode classifier to partition the predicted trajectories by dynamical\nmode. For each mode, we then apply conformal inference to produce statistically\nvalid, mode-specific prediction intervals. We demonstrate the effectiveness of\nGenQPM on a benchmark of agent navigation and autonomous driving tasks,\nresulting in prediction intervals that are significantly more informative (less\nconservative) than mode-agnostic baselines.",

FMAE demonstrates a practical route to a\nflexible, data-efficient model that simplifies real-world multi-task management\nof dynamical systems.",

    "abstract": "We introduce LongCat-Flash, a 560-billion-parameter Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)\nlanguage model designed for both computational efficiency and advanced agentic\ncapabilities. Stemming from the need for scalable efficiency, LongCat-Flash\nadopts two novel designs: (a) Zero-computation Experts, which enables dynamic\ncomputational budget allocation and activates 18.6B-31.3B (27B on average) per\ntoken depending on contextual demands, optimizing resource usage. (b)\nShortcut-connected MoE, which enlarges the computation-communication overlap\nwindow, demonstrating notable gains in inference efficiency and throughput\ncompared to models of a comparable scale. We develop a comprehensive scaling\nframework for large models that combines hyperparameter transfer, model-growth\ninitialization, a multi-pronged stability suite, and deterministic computation\nto achieve stable and reproducible training. Notably, leveraging the synergy\namong scalable architectural design and infrastructure efforts, we complete\nmodel training on more than 20 trillion tokens within 30 days, while achieving\nover 100 tokens per second (TPS) for inference at a cost of \\$0.70 per million\noutput tokens. To cultivate LongCat-Flash towards agentic intelligence, we\nconduct a large-scale pre-training on optimized mixtures, followed by targeted\nmid- and post-training on reasoning, code, and instructions, with further\naugmentation from synthetic data and tool use tasks. Comprehensive evaluations\ndemonstrate that, as a non-thinking foundation model, LongCat-Flash delivers\nhighly competitive performance among other leading models, with exceptional\nstrengths in agentic tasks.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in large reasoning models have leveraged reinforcement\nlearning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) to improve reasoning capabilities.\nHowever, scaling these methods typically requires extensive rollout computation\nand large datasets, leading to high training costs and low data efficiency. To\nmitigate this issue, we propose DEPO, a Data-Efficient Policy Optimization\npipeline that combines optimized strategies for both offline and online data\nselection. In the offline phase, we curate a high-quality subset of training\nsamples based on diversity, influence, and appropriate difficulty. During\nonline RLVR training, we introduce a sample-level explorability metric to\ndynamically filter samples with low exploration potential, thereby reducing\nsubstantial rollout computational costs. Furthermore, we incorporate a replay\nmechanism for under-explored samples to ensure adequate training, which\nenhances the model's final convergence performance. Experiments across five\nreasoning benchmarks show that DEPO consistently outperforms existing methods\nin both offline and online data selection scenarios. Notably, using only 20% of\nthe training data, our approach achieves a 1.85 times speed-up on AIME24 and a\n1.66 times speed-up on AIME25 compared to GRPO trained on the full dataset.",

    "abstract": "Vital signs, such as heart rate and blood pressure, are critical indicators\nof patient health and are widely used in clinical monitoring and\ndecision-making. While deep learning models have shown promise in forecasting\nthese signals, their deployment in healthcare remains limited in part because\nclinicians must be able to trust and interpret model outputs. Without reliable\nuncertainty quantification -- particularly calibrated prediction intervals\n(PIs) -- it is unclear whether a forecasted abnormality constitutes a\nmeaningful warning or merely reflects model noise, hindering clinical\ndecision-making. To address this, we present two methods for deriving PIs from\nthe Reconstruction Uncertainty Estimate (RUE), an uncertainty measure\nwell-suited to vital-sign forecasting due to its sensitivity to data shifts and\nsupport for label-free calibration. Our parametric approach assumes that\nprediction errors and uncertainty estimates follow a Gaussian copula\ndistribution, enabling closed-form PI computation. Our non-parametric approach,\nbased on k-nearest neighbours (KNN), empirically estimates the conditional\nerror distribution using similar validation instances. We evaluate these\nmethods on two large public datasets with minute- and hour-level sampling,\nrepresenting high- and low-frequency health signals. Experiments demonstrate\nthat the Gaussian copula method consistently outperforms conformal prediction\nbaselines on low-frequency data, while the KNN approach performs best on\nhigh-frequency data. These results underscore the clinical promise of\nRUE-derived PIs for delivering interpretable, uncertainty-aware vital sign\nforecasts.",

Recently, fuzzing has become a popular method\nfor automated software testing due to its ability to quickly identify\ncorner-case errors. However, its application to embedded software is still\nlimited. Simulator tools can help bridge this gap by providing a more powerful\nand controlled execution environment for testing. Existing solutions, however,\noften tightly couple fuzzers with built-in simulators that lack support for\nhardware peripherals and offer limited flexibility, restricting their ability\nto test embedded software. To address these limitations, we present a framework\nthat allows the integration of American-Fuzzy-Lop-based fuzzers and\nSystemC-based simulators. The framework provides a harness to decouple the\nadopted fuzzer and simulator. In addition, it intercepts peripheral accesses\nand queries the fuzzer for values, effectively linking peripheral behavior to\nthe fuzzer. This solution enables flexible interchangeability of peripherals\nwithin the simulation environment and supports the interfacing of different\nSystemC-based virtual prototypes. The flexibility of the proposed solution is\ndemonstrated by integrating the harness with different simulators and by\ntesting various softwares.",

    "abstract": "Text-to-SQL, the task of translating natural language questions into SQL\nqueries, has significantly advanced with the introduction of Large Language\nModels (LLMs), broadening database accessibility for a wide range of users.\nDespite substantial progress in generating valid SQL, current LLMs still\nstruggle with complex queries that require precise alignment between user\nintent and the database schema. To mitigate this, test-time strategies such as\nBest-of-N (BoN) and Majority Voting (Maj) are often employed, based on the\nassumption that LLMs can generate correct answers but may require multiple\nattempts. However, these methods rely on surface-level heuristics, selecting\neither the syntactically correct query through execution-based BoN (ex-BoN) or\nthe most frequently generated query with Maj. Recently, Outcome Reward Models\n(ORMs), which assign utility scores to generated outputs based on semantic\ncorrectness, have emerged as a promising approach for better aligning model\npredictions with user intent. Nevertheless, their application to Text-to-SQL\nremains largely underexplored.\n  In this work, we evaluate ORMs as an effective heuristic for BoN, compare\nthem with ex-BoN and Maj, and introduce a framework for training ORMs for the\nText-to-SQL task. We evaluate our ORMs on the BIRD and SPIDER benchmarks,\nfinetuning various open-source LLMs, including the Qwen2, Granite3, and Llama3\nmodel families. Our results show that ORMs outperform ex-BoN and Maj, achieving\nexecution accuracy gains of +4.33% (BIRD) and +2.10% (Spider) over ex-BoN, and\n+2.91% (BIRD) and +0.93% (Spider) over Maj. We further demonstrate that\nfinetuning models already aligned with SQL generation, such as OmniSQL, yields\nsuperior ORM performance. Additionally, we observe that ORMs achieve\ncompetitive results on simple queries and benefit more from an increased number\nof candidates compared to ex-BoN and Maj.",

Utilising high-resolution archival data from AstroSat/UVIT for UV\nimaging and the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) for CO(2-1)\nmolecular gas mapping, we explore recent star formation and gas distribution\nwith a spatial resolution of about 120 to 132 pc. Our findings reveal a\nsublinear rKS law, with slopes ranging from about 0.17 to 0.71. Notably, NGC\n1566 exhibits a robust rKS relation consistent with previous studies, while NGC\n1365 and NGC 1433 show weaker correlations. These differences are likely due to\nthe smaller number of identified star-forming regions in these galaxies\ncompared to NGC 1566, as well as the central molecular gas concentrations and\nvarying star formation activity in their bars and nuclear regions. These\nresults also support the idea that the rKS relation deviates from linearity in\nextreme environments, such as starburst galaxies and galactic centres.\nAdditionally, we find a generally low median star formation efficiency (SFE)\nwithin the bars of these galaxies, suggesting that while bars may drive nuclear\nstarbursts and contribute to bulge growth, they do not significantly increase\nSFE. Furthermore, a negative correlation between SFE and Sigma H2 is observed\nacross the sample, both within and outside the bar regions, suggesting that\nhigher Sigma H2 may lead to lower SFE in the central regions of these galaxies.\nOur findings highlight that Sigma H2 plays a primary role in shaping the\nobserved trends in SFE, rather than the presence of a bar itself.",

Existing methods often address the two challenges in\nisolation, relying on brittle heuristics that fail in scenarios where temporal\nrequirements and staleness resistance are intertwined.

Our results demonstrate that nuclear polarizability\neffects, negligible in ${}^7$Li, dominate in ${}^6$Li and explain the observed\nsignificant deviation between the effective and elastic Zemach radii.\nFurthermore, we show that the ratios between the nuclear polarizability\ncontributions in different nuclei are universal in the limit of closure and\nSU(4) symmetry of nuclear forces.

Numerous efforts have been made to match its abundance pattern. However,\nno model satisfactorily explains its entire surface chemical composition. The\nhigh CNO pattern with [N/Fe]>[C/Fe]>[O/Fe], the light element 'slide' (between\nNa and Si), and the presence of Sr and Ba in HE 1327 is reminiscent of those\nasymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars that undergo third dredge-up, hot bottom\nburning, and s-processing, suggesting that AGBs may have been progenitors of\nthe star. We assume that, where HE 1327 formed, the interstellar medium was\nwell-mixed, and adopt an initial stellar composition based on the observed\nchemical evolution of the early universe. We calculated models of\nhyper-metal-poor AGB stars and compared their yields to the observed abundances\nof HE 1327. Our 3 Msun models match 13 of the 14 measured elements in HE1327.\nThey are also consistent with the seven elements with upper limits. The only\ndiscrepancy is O, underproduced by 0.5-1.0 dex. Unlike the SN models, the AGB\nmodels also match Sr and Ba. Our model predicts high abundances of P and Pb,\nwhich would be useful in testing the AGB scenario. We propose that HE 1327 is\nthe oldest known object that shows nucleosynthetic evidence of the first AGB\nstars. With lifetimes as short as 200 Myr, these stars may have formed and\npolluted the universe very early. Recent Pop III star formation simulations\nsupport their formation, and their strong N production is qualitatively\nconsistent with recent JWST observations showing high N/O ratios just 440 Myr\nafter the Big Bang. Importantly, our results also suggest that the interstellar\nmedium may have shown some degree of homogeneity and mixing even at these early\nepochs.",

Currently,\nexisting CD-FSS studies typically design multiple independent modules to\nenhance the cross-domain generalization ability of feature representations.\nHowever, the independence among these modules hinders the effective flow of\nknowledge, making it difficult to fully leverage their collective potential. In\ncontrast, this paper proposes an all-in-one module based on ordinary\ndifferential equations and Fourier transform, resulting in a structurally\nconcise method--Few-Shot Segmentation over Time Intervals (FSS-TIs). FSS-TIs\nassumes the existence of an ODE relationship between the spectra (including\namplitude and phase spectra) of domain-specific features and domain-agnostic\nfeatures. This ODE formulation yields an iterative transformation process along\na sequence of time intervals, while simultaneously applying affine\ntransformations with randomized perturbations to the spectra. In doing so, the\nexploration of domain-agnostic feature representation spaces and the simulation\nof diverse potential target-domain distributions are reformulated as an\noptimization process over the intrinsic parameters of the ODE. Moreover, we\nstrictly constrain the support-sample selection during target-domain\nfine-tuning so that it is consistent with the requirements of real-world\nfew-shot segmentation tasks. For evaluation, we introduce five datasets from\nsubstantially different domains and define two sets of cross-domain few-shot\nsegmentation tasks to comprehensively analyze the performance of FSS-TIs.\nExperimental results demonstrate the superiority of FSS-TIs over existing\nCD-FSS methods, and in-depth ablation studies further validate the cross-domain\nadaptability of FSS-TIs.",

Consequently, the\nassociated reduced tangential shear lensing profiles consistently tend to zero\nat angles \\theta <~ 40^{''}. This result is inconsistent with what is deduced\nfrom the measured profiles. These profiles exhibit a diverging behavior when\n\\theta --> 0, as predicted by an NFW mass model. We argue that such\ncontradictions cannot be easily reconciled within the DM models presented so\nfar as an alternative to the collisionless paradigm. However, we suggest that\nthis tension can be used as a unique test bed to probe new DM physics.",

This makes it difficult to interpret which\nfactors drive performance and can hinder generalization. In this work, we\nintroduce a disentangled multi-context meta-learning framework that explicitly\nassigns each task factor to a distinct context vector. By decoupling these\nvariations, our approach improves robustness through deeper task understanding\nand enhances generalization by enabling context vector sharing across tasks\nwith shared factors. We evaluate our approach in two domains. First, on a\nsinusoidal regression task, our model outperforms baselines on\nout-of-distribution tasks and generalizes to unseen sine functions by sharing\ncontext vectors associated with shared amplitudes or phase shifts. Second, in a\nquadruped robot locomotion task, we disentangle the robot-specific properties\nand the characteristics of the terrain in the robot dynamics model. By\ntransferring disentangled context vectors acquired from the dynamics model into\nreinforcement learning, the resulting policy achieves improved robustness under\nout-of-distribution conditions, surpassing the baselines that rely on a single\nunified context. Furthermore, by effectively sharing context, our model enables\nsuccessful sim-to-real policy transfer to challenging terrains with\nout-of-distribution robot-specific properties, using just 20 seconds of real\ndata from flat terrain, a result not achievable with single-task adaptation.",

    "abstract": "Context: Predicting human trajectories is crucial for the safety and\nreliability of autonomous systems, such as automated vehicles and mobile\nrobots. However, rigorously testing the underlying multimodal Human Trajectory\nPrediction (HTP) models, which typically use multiple input sources (e.g.,\ntrajectory history and environment maps) and produce stochastic outputs\n(multiple possible future paths), presents significant challenges. The primary\ndifficulty lies in the absence of a definitive test oracle, as numerous future\ntrajectories might be plausible for any given scenario. Objectives: This\nresearch presents the application of Metamorphic Testing (MT) as a systematic\nmethodology for testing multimodal HTP systems. We address the oracle problem\nthrough metamorphic relations (MRs) adapted for the complexities and stochastic\nnature of HTP. Methods: We present five MRs, targeting transformations of both\nhistorical trajectory data and semantic segmentation maps used as an\nenvironmental context. These MRs encompass: 1) label-preserving geometric\ntransformations (mirroring, rotation, rescaling) applied to both trajectory and\nmap inputs, where outputs are expected to transform correspondingly. 2)\nMap-altering transformations (changing semantic class labels, introducing\nobstacles) with predictable changes in trajectory distributions. We propose\nprobabilistic violation criteria based on distance metrics between probability\ndistributions, such as the Wasserstein or Hellinger distance. Conclusion: This\nstudy introduces tool, a MT framework for the oracle-less testing of\nmultimodal, stochastic HTP systems. It allows for assessment of model\nrobustness against input transformations and contextual changes without\nreliance on ground-truth trajectories.",

The branching mechanism is\ngoverned by the same random environment, which is here taken to be a simple\nsymmetric random walk. We will interpret the presence of this random walk as a\ntrap which attempts to kill the individuals whenever it meets them. The\nresponsive switching between the active and dormant state is defined so that\nactive individuals become dormant only when a trap is present at their location\nand remain active otherwise.

QSV decides whether a given quantum state is close to\nthe ideal one, with significantly lower sample complexity compared with direct\napplication of quantum tomography.

Here, we consider two fundamental quantities of a pure\nquantum state, determining the sample complexity needed for QSV or the security\nlevel in QDH. We demonstrate that a pure state is most difficult to verify in\nQSV if and only if it is most secure in QDH with respect to those quantities.\nFurthermore, for such extremal states, the two fundamental quantities coincide.\nWe also generalize this relationship to one between the security of QDH using\nmixed states and the sample complexity for quantum subspace verification, which\nis a generalization of QSV.

The concept of the\nradial epiderivative constitutes a distinct generalization of classical\nderivative notions, as it replaces the conventional limit operation with an\ninfimum-based construction. This formulation permits the analysis of\ndirectional behavior without invoking standard neighborhood-based assumptions\nand constructions commonly required in generalized differentiation. This leads\nto one of the key advantages of the radial epiderivative which lies in its\napplicability even to discrete domains, where classical and generalized\nderivatives are often inapplicable or undefined. The other advantage of this\nconcept is that it provides a possibility to inverstigate KKT conditions for\nglobal minimums. Consequently, this approach necessitates a reformulation of\nfundamental analytical tools such as gradient vectors, feasible direction sets,\nconstraint qualifications and other concepts which are central to the\nderivation of optimality conditions in smooth optimization theory. The primary\ncontribution of this paper is the development of a comprehensive theoretical\nframework for KKT conditions tailored to the radially epidifferentiable\nsetting.

Three forces shape equilibrium: an insurance -\ninformation trade-off, selection by reputation, and inference from application\ndecisions. We show that (i) an absorbing employment region exists in which\nlow-reputation workers strictly prefer the firm's insurance and optimally cease\nproducing public information; (ii) sufficiently strong reputation triggers\nself-employment in order to generate public signals and preserve future outside\noptions; and (iii) with equilibrium firms, application choices act as signals\nthat shift hiring thresholds and wages even when in-firm performance remains\nopaque.

Rhenium disulfide (ReS$_2$) stands out for its\nstrong in-plane anisotropy and its thickness-independent direct-bandgap\nexcitons, which can hybridize with light to form exciton-polaritons. In\nparallel, metasurfaces, engineered arrays of nanoscale subwavelength\nresonators, can support ultra-sharp photonic modes in the form of quasi-bound\nstates in the continuum (qBICs). Topological transformations of photonic modes\ncan give rise to flatbands, i.e., dispersionless states with quenched kinetic\nenergy and vanishing group velocity. Intrinsic material anisotropy offers an\nunexplored route to robust far-field flatband formation and control. Here, we\ndemonstrate how structuring an intrinsically anisotropic excitonic material\ninto a resonant metasurface fundamentally transforms its photonic topological\nfeatures and light-matter coupling behavior, allowing us to drive and\ntopologically control extended far-field flatband formation. To this end, we\nfabricate C$_4$-symmetric metasurfaces directly from bulk ReS$_2$. The\nintrinsic anisotropy lifts the initial double degeneracy of the qBIC mode and\nyields two distinctly polarized resonances. It also reshapes the topological\nlandscape: the integer topological charge of the qBIC mode splits into\nmomentum-separated half-integer singularities, thereby flattening the far-field\nphotonic dispersion. The resulting topologically-controlled photonic flatbands\nare then tuned in resonance with the linearly polarized excitonic transitions\nof ReS$_2$, resulting in two distinct, directionally hybridized\nexciton-polariton flatband regimes. These findings establish anisotropic vdW\nmetasurfaces as a new platform for topologically engineered flatbands and\nflatband-driven light-matter coupling.",

To overcome these limitations, we propose Message\nPassing Complexity (MPC): a continuous measure that quantifies the difficulty\nfor a GNN architecture to solve a given task through message passing. MPC\ncaptures practical limitations like over-squashing while preserving the\ntheoretical impossibility results from expressivity theory, effectively\nnarrowing the gap between theory and practice. Through extensive validation on\nfundamental GNN tasks, we show that MPC's theoretical predictions correlate\nwith empirical performance, successfully explaining architectural successes and\nfailures. Thereby, MPC advances beyond expressivity theory to provide a more\npowerful and nuanced framework for understanding and improving GNN\narchitectures.",

    "abstract": "In contemporary cloud-based services, protecting users' sensitive data and\nensuring the confidentiality of the server's model are critical. Fully\nhomomorphic encryption (FHE) enables inference directly on encrypted inputs,\nbut its practicality is hindered by expensive bootstrapping and inefficient\napproximations of non-linear activations. We introduce Safhire, a hybrid\ninference framework that executes linear layers under encryption on the server\nwhile offloading non-linearities to the client in plaintext. This design\neliminates bootstrapping, supports exact activations, and significantly reduces\ncomputation. To safeguard model confidentiality despite client access to\nintermediate outputs, Safhire applies randomized shuffling, which obfuscates\nintermediate values and makes it practically impossible to reconstruct the\nmodel. To further reduce latency, Safhire incorporates advanced optimizations\nsuch as fast ciphertext packing and partial extraction. Evaluations on multiple\nstandard models and datasets show that Safhire achieves 1.5X - 10.5X lower\ninference latency than Orion, a state-of-the-art baseline, with manageable\ncommunication overhead and comparable accuracy, thereby establishing the\npracticality of hybrid FHE inference.",

    "abstract": "Point cloud learning, especially in a self-supervised way without manual\nlabels, has gained growing attention in both vision and learning communities\ndue to its potential utility in a wide range of applications. Most existing\ngenerative approaches for point cloud self-supervised learning focus on\nrecovering masked points from visible ones within a single view. Recognizing\nthat a two-view pre-training paradigm inherently introduces greater diversity\nand variance, it may thus enable more challenging and informative pre-training.\nInspired by this, we explore the potential of two-view learning in this domain.\nIn this paper, we propose Point-PQAE, a cross-reconstruction generative\nparadigm that first generates two decoupled point clouds/views and then\nreconstructs one from the other. To achieve this goal, we develop a crop\nmechanism for point cloud view generation for the first time and further\npropose a novel positional encoding to represent the 3D relative position\nbetween the two decoupled views. The cross-reconstruction significantly\nincreases the difficulty of pre-training compared to self-reconstruction, which\nenables our method to surpass previous single-modal self-reconstruction methods\nin 3D self-supervised learning. Specifically, it outperforms the\nself-reconstruction baseline (Point-MAE) by 6.5%, 7.0%, and 6.7% in three\nvariants of ScanObjectNN with the Mlp-Linear evaluation protocol.

The PDR concept overcomes key technological challenges\nof conventional accelerator-driven systems, particularly the target's\nstructural durability and its thermal management, by employing synchrotron\nphotons directly interacting with fissile material to induce photonuclear\nreactions. Computational analyses involved criticality and fixed-source\nsimulation using MCNPx and SERPENT Monte Carlo codes, providing robust\nevaluation of the neutron production, moderation, and multiplication\nmechanisms. The main focus of this study was to evaluate the system's\ncapability to achieve a positive net energy gain, specifically assessing the\nthermal power output agains the electrical power absorbed from the grid.\nFurthermore, the adoption of spent nuclear fuel for the subcritical reactor\ncore loading has been investigated, highlighting the sustainability and\nenvironmental benefits of the proposed PDR design. The proposed system is able\nto exploit a modularity feature. For each large synchrotron, up to fifty beam\nlines may be operated simultaneously, each delivering photons to an independent\nsubcritical reactor core. With a photon flux on the order of $8.8 \\times\n10^{17}$ photons per second in each beamline, the results indicate that each\nindividual reactor can achieve a thermal output up to 8 MW, while requiring\nabout 435-660 kW of electrical input from the grid, thereby demonstrating the\nfeasibility of energy amplification in the PDR.",

However, the parity-forbidden nature of these\nelectronic transition systems is incompatible with the conventional Condon\napproximation, which is widely adopted in the classic theories such as the\nHuang-Rhys theory, a framework established on the assumption of parity-allowed\nelectric dipole transitions. This results in a critical knowledge gap regarding\nthe principles governing the phonon sidebands of parity-forbidden electronic\ntransitions. This study experimentally reveals a pronounced parity-dependent\nintensity distribution in the phonon sidebands of these systems: significantly\nsuppressed even-order sidebands and normally observed odd-order sidebands. To\nelucidate the phenomenon, we extend the Huang-Rhys theory to parity-forbidden\nsystems by incorporating the Herzberg-Teller approximation into the treatment\nof the transition matrix elements. The improved theory successfully uncovers\nthe physical mechanism behind the strong suppression of the even-order\nsidebands in the parity-forbidden systems, in which the Huang-Rhys factor is\nderived as S=((2I_3)/(9I_1 ))^(1/2).

    "abstract": "Superhydrophobic surfaces (SHS) have demonstrated significant potential in\nreducing turbulent drag by introducing slip conditions through micro-structured\ngeometries. While previous studies have examined individual SHS configurations\nsuch as post-type, ridge-type, and transverse ridge-type surfaces, a unified\nanalysis that connects these patterns through geometric parameterization\nremains limited. In this study, we propose a systematic framework to explore\nthe drag reduction characteristics by varying the streamwise and spanwise\nspacing ($d_1, d_2$) of post-type patterns, effectively encompassing a range of\nSHS geometries. High-fidelity direct numerical simulations (DNS) were performed\nusing NekRS, a GPU-accelerated spectral element solver, to resolve\nincompressible turbulent channel flows over these SHSs. To account for\nvariability in the geometric parameters and quantify their influence, we\nconstruct a surrogate model based on polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) using\nLatin hypercube sampling (LHS) method. The resulting model enables efficient\nuncertainty quantification (UQ) and sensitivity analysis, revealing the\nrelative importance of $d_1$ and $d_2$ in drag reduction performance. This\nunified UQ framework provides both predictive capability and design guidance\nfor optimizing SHS configurations under uncertain geometric conditions.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in\nlanguage understanding and reasoning. However, their dependence on static\ntraining corpora makes them prone to factual errors and knowledge gaps.\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this limitation by incorporating\nexternal knowledge sources, especially structured Knowledge Graphs (KGs), which\nprovide explicit semantics and efficient retrieval. Existing KG-based RAG\napproaches, however, generally assume that anchor entities are accessible to\ninitiate graph traversal, which limits their robustness in open world settings\nwhere accurate linking between the query and the entity is unreliable. To\novercome this limitation, we propose AnchorRAG, a novel multi-agent\ncollaboration framework for open-world RAG without the predefined anchor\nentities. Specifically, a predictor agent dynamically identifies candidate\nanchor entities by aligning user query terms with KG nodes and initializes\nindependent retriever agents to conduct parallel multi-hop explorations from\neach candidate. Then a supervisor agent formulates the iterative retrieval\nstrategy for these retriever agents and synthesizes the resulting knowledge\npaths to generate the final answer. This multi-agent collaboration framework\nimproves retrieval robustness and mitigates the impact of ambiguous or\nerroneous anchors. Extensive experiments on four public benchmarks demonstrate\nthat AnchorRAG significantly outperforms existing baselines and establishes new\nstate-of-the-art results on the real-world question answering tasks.",

We\nmodel the complex interaction process as a dynamic directed graph, upon which\nwe build a collaborative multi-agent system. This system comprises a scene\nnavigator agent for environmental perception and high-level path planning, and\na planning agent that decomposes long-horizon goals into atomic actions.\nCritically, we introduce a critic agent that establishes a closed-loop feedback\nmechanism by evaluating the deviation between generated actions and the planned\npath.

To enhance the physical realism of the generated motions, we\nleverage Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to train the action generator,\nsignificantly reducing artifacts such as limb distortion and foot-sliding.\nExtensive experiments on our custom SceneBench benchmark demonstrate that\nFantasyHSI significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of\ngeneralization, long-horizon task completion, and physical realism.

With many\nopen-source LLMs available, selecting the best model for fine-tuning downstream\ntasks is challenging, primarily focusing on how to quickly identify the optimal\nLLM. We introduce a Data and Model Compression Framework (DaMoC) that addresses\nthis challenge by: 1) Data Level: A systematic categorization of data filtering\nmethodologies for LLMs is first established, classifying them into three\ndistinct paradigms: (1) distribution-aware methods, (2) quality-aware methods,\nand (3) hybrid approaches considering both dimensions. Further, we enhance the\ndensity of key tokens in the text achieving token compression. Subsequently, we\nuse an LLM to iterative rewrite the text to optimize its expression. 2) Model\nLevel: We use layer similarity scores to assess each layer's importance and\nremove those with lower importance. Then, we introduce a sparse merging\nparadigm to preserve as much of the original model's capability as possible.\nExtensive experiments on four datasets, medical Q&A, financial Q&A, general\nQ&A, and reading comprehension, show that we can select the optimal LLM while\nsaving approximately 20-fold in training time.",

    "abstract": "(abridged) Recent analyses have reported low lithium but high beryllium\nabundances on the solar surface; however, standard solar models (SSMs) predict\nLi abundances that are ~30$\\sigma$ away from the observed value. In this study,\nwe aim to develop solar models and compare them with the Li and Be abundance\nconstraints. We examine the effect of protosolar accretion and turbulent mixing\nbelow the base of the surface convective zone. We compute ~200 solar\nevolutionary models for each case to optimize input parameters using target\nquantities, similar to the SSM framework. We confirm that turbulent mixing\nhelps reproduce the surface Li and Be abundances within ~0.6$\\sigma$ by\nenhancing burning. It suppresses gravitational settling, leading to a better\nmatching of the He surface abundance ($\\lesssim$0.3$\\sigma$) and a smaller\ncompositional gradient. We derive a new protosolar helium abundance $Y_{\\rm\nproto}=0.2651\\pm0.0035$. Turbulent mixing decreases the central metallicity\n($Z_{\\mathrm{center}}$) by $\\approx$4.4%, even though accretion increases\n$Z_{\\rm center}$ by $\\approx$4.4%, as suggested by our previous study.\nUnfortunately, the reduction in $Z_{\\rm center}$ implies that our models do not\nreproduce constraints on observed neutrino fluxes by $6.2\\sigma$ for $^8{\\rm\nB}$ and $2.7\\sigma$ for CNO. Including turbulent mixing in solar models appears\nindispensable to reproduce the observed atmospheric abundances of Li and Be.\nHowever, the resulting tensions in terms of neutrino fluxes, even in the models\nwith the protosolar accretion, show that the solar modeling problem remains, at\nleast partly. We suggest that improved electron screening, as well as other\nmicroscopic properties, may help alleviate this problem. An independent\nconfirmation of the neutrino fluxes measured by the Borexino experiment would\nalso be extremely valuable.",

This\nproblem is particularly critical for large language models (LLMs) undergoing\ncontinual learning, as retaining performance across diverse domains is\nimportant for their general utility. In this paper, we explore model growth, a\npromising strategy that leverages smaller models to expedite and structure the\ntraining of larger ones for mitigating the catastrophic forgetting problem.\nAlthough growth-based pretraining, particularly via transformer stacking, has\nshown promise in accelerating convergence, its impact on forgetting remains\nunder-explored. Therefore, we evaluate whether growth-based models can retain\npreviously learned capabilities more effectively across a sequence of\nfine-tuning tasks involving domain knowledge, reasoning, reading comprehension,\nand bias. Our findings show that both models -- one trained with growth (Stack\nLLM) and one without (LLM) -- exhibit improvements in domain knowledge.\nHowever, reasoning and reading comprehension degrade over time, indicating\nsigns of catastrophic forgetting. Stack LLM consistently shows less\ndegradation, especially in reading comprehension, suggesting enhanced retention\ncapabilities. Interestingly, in bias evaluation, the baseline LLM becomes\nprogressively more neutral with continued fine-tuning, while Stack LLM\nmaintains a steady bias ratio around 60--61\\%.

In\nthe proposed module, based on the input feature, different experts with a small\namount of trainable parameters are adaptively selected for weighted inference,\nfrom various mixture of low-rank experts which are allocated based on the\ntraining quality of each block. Moreover, a novel self-supervised training\nframework is proposed to jointly cope with the inconsistency of brightness and\nreflectance.

In\nthis work, we investigate the extent to which BMS supertranslations can relate\nphysically distinct black hole geometries. Focusing on the Schwarzschild and\nKerr solutions, we show that the asymptotic structure of the Kerr spacetime can\nbe generated from the Schwarzschild geometry via two successive\nsupertranslations. These transformations yield a Kerr-like geometry at null\ninfinity and reveal two distinct classes of supertranslation functions. The\nfirst, composed of $l=1$ spherical harmonics, corresponds to center-of-mass\ndisplacements and encodes the translational sector of the BMS group. The\nsecond, characterized by an infinite series of even-parity Legendre polynomials\n($l \\geq 2$), captures the intrinsic mass multipole structure of the Kerr\nspacetime. Our result illustrates how BMS supertranslations can act as symmetry\ntransformations linking asymptotically flat black hole geometries, and that\nthey encode physically meaningful soft hair consistent with the multipole\nstructure of rotating black holes.

To fully exploit MLO's potential, it\nis essential to investigate Wi-Fi 7's coexistence performance with legacy Wi-Fi\ndevices. Existing approaches, however, have overlooked some crucial aspects of\nMLO, necessitating the development of a standards-compliant analytical\nframework to model the actual channel access mechanism of MLO. Therefore, this\npaper tries to fill the gap by proposing a set of novel Markov chains (MC) to\naccurately model the MLO operation aligned with multi-link backoff behaviors\nspecified by the standard. Specifically, we design two separate MCs for AP and\nnon-AP multi-link devices (MLD) respectively, based on which transmit and\ncollision probabilities are derived under the saturated traffic condition.\nThen, we also derive closed-form expressions for the throughput of various\ndevice types in the coexistence scenario between Wi-Fi 7 and legacy Wi-Fi,\nincluding AP MLD, non- AP MLD, and legacy devices. To validate the accuracy of\nour proposed models, we developed an ns-3 based simulator by implementing both\nSTR(simultaneous transmission and reception) and NSTR(non-STR) based MLO\noperations.

Low-rank adaption (LoRA) is a widely\nused FT technique that only trains small-scale adapters and keeps the base\nmodel unaltered, conveying the possibility of processing multiple FT tasks by\njointly training different LoRA adapters with a shared base model.\n  Nevertheless, through in-depth analysis, we reveal the efficiency of joint FT\nis dampened by two heterogeneity issues in the training data -- the sequence\nlength variation and skewness. To tackle these issues, we develop LobRA, a\nbrand new framework that supports processing multiple FT tasks by jointly\ntraining LoRA adapters. Two innovative designs are introduced. Firstly, LobRA\ndeploys the FT replicas (i.e., model replicas for FT) with heterogeneous\nresource usages and parallel configurations, matching the diverse workloads\ncaused by the sequence length variation. Secondly, for each training step,\nLobRA takes account of the sequence length skewness and dispatches the training\ndata among the heterogeneous FT replicas to achieve workload balance. We\nconduct experiments to assess the performance of LobRA, validating that it\nsignificantly reduces the GPU seconds required for joint FT by 45.03%-60.67%.",

However, achieving fine-grained independent control over multiple\nsubjects remains challenging due to difficulties in preserving subject fidelity\nand preventing cross-subject attribute leakage. We present FocusDPO, a\nframework that adaptively identifies focus regions based on dynamic semantic\ncorrespondence and supervision image complexity. During training, our method\nprogressively adjusts these focal areas across noise timesteps, implementing a\nweighted strategy that rewards information-rich patches while penalizing\nregions with low prediction confidence. The framework dynamically adjusts focus\nallocation during the DPO process according to the semantic complexity of\nreference images and establishes robust correspondence mappings between\ngenerated and reference subjects. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our\nmethod substantially enhances the performance of existing pre-trained\npersonalized generation models, achieving state-of-the-art results on both\nsingle-subject and multi-subject personalized image synthesis benchmarks. Our\nmethod effectively mitigates attribute leakage while preserving superior\nsubject fidelity across diverse generation scenarios, advancing the frontier of\ncontrollable multi-subject image synthesis.",

    "abstract": "In two-party secret sharing scheme, values are typically encoded as unsigned\nintegers $\\mathsf{uint}(x)$, whereas real-world applications often require\ncomputations on signed real numbers $\\mathsf{Real}(x)$. To enable secure\nevaluation of practical functions, it is essential to computing\n$\\mathsf{Real}(x)$ from shared inputs, as protocols take shares as input. At\nUSENIX'25, Guo et al. proposed an efficient method for computing signed integer\nvalues $\\mathsf{int}(x)$ from shares, which can be extended to compute\n$\\mathsf{Real}(x)$. However, their approach imposes a restrictive input\nconstraint $|x| < \\frac{L}{3}$ for $x \\in \\mathbb{Z}_L$, limiting its\napplicability in real-world scenarios. In this work, we significantly relax\nthis constraint to $|x| < B$ for any $B \\leq \\frac{L}{2}$, where $B =\n\\frac{L}{2}$ corresponding to the natural representable range in $x \\in\n\\mathbb{Z}_L$. This relaxes the restrictions and enables the computation of\n$\\mathsf{Real}(x)$ with loose or no input constraints. Building upon this\nfoundation, we present a generalized framework for designing secure protocols\nfor a broad class of functions, including integer division ($\\lfloor\n\\frac{x}{d} \\rfloor$), trigonometric ($\\sin(x)$) and exponential ($e^{-x}$)\nfunctions. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that the proposed protocols\nachieve both high efficiency and high accuracy. Notably, our protocol for\nevaluating $e^{-x}$ reduces communication costs to approximately 31% of those\nin SirNN (S&P 21) and Bolt (S&P 24), with runtime speedups of up to $5.53\n\\times$ and $3.09 \\times$, respectively.

    "abstract": "Reconstruction dynamic visual scenes from electroencephalography (EEG)\nsignals remains a primary challenge in brain decoding, limited by the low\nspatial resolution of EEG, a temporal mismatch between neural recordings and\nvideo dynamics, and the insufficient use of semantic information within brain\nactivity. Therefore, existing methods often inadequately resolve both the\ndynamic coherence and the complex semantic context of the perceived visual\nstimuli. To overcome these limitations, we introduce DynaMind, a novel\nframework that reconstructs video by jointly modeling neural dynamics and\nsemantic features via three core modules: a Regional-aware Semantic Mapper\n(RSM), a Temporal-aware Dynamic Aligner (TDA), and a Dual-Guidance Video\nReconstructor (DGVR). The RSM first utilizes a regional-aware encoder to\nextract multimodal semantic features from EEG signals across distinct brain\nregions, aggregating them into a unified diffusion prior. In the mean time, the\nTDA generates a dynamic latent sequence, or blueprint, to enforce temporal\nconsistency between the feature representations and the original neural\nrecordings. Together, guided by the semantic diffusion prior, the DGVR\ntranslates the temporal-aware blueprint into a high-fidelity video\nreconstruction. On the SEED-DV dataset, DynaMind sets a new state-of-the-art\n(SOTA), boosting reconstructed video accuracies (video- and frame-based) by\n12.5 and 10.3 percentage points, respectively. It also achieves a leap in\npixel-level quality, showing exceptional visual fidelity and temporal coherence\nwith a 9.4% SSIM improvement and a 19.7% FVMD reduction. This marks a critical\nadvancement, bridging the gap between neural dynamics and high-fidelity visual\nsemantics.",

Recently, large language models (LLMs) have\nexhibited remarkable reasoning capabilities. LLM-enhanced KGC methods primarily\nfocus on designing task-specific instructions, achieving promising\nadvancements. However, there are still two critical challenges. First, existing\nmethods often ignore the inconsistent representation spaces between natural\nlanguage and graph structures. Second, most approaches design separate\ninstructions for different KGC tasks, leading to duplicate works and\ntime-consuming processes. To address these challenges, we propose SAT, a novel\nframework that enhances LLMs for KGC via structure-aware alignment-tuning.\nSpecifically, we first introduce hierarchical knowledge alignment to align\ngraph embeddings with the natural language space through multi-task contrastive\nlearning. Then, we propose structural instruction tuning to guide LLMs in\nperforming structure-aware reasoning over KGs, using a unified graph\ninstruction combined with a lightweight knowledge adapter. Experimental results\non two KGC tasks across four benchmark datasets demonstrate that SAT\nsignificantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially in the link\nprediction task with improvements ranging from 8.7% to 29.8%.",

    "abstract": "We consider a class of nonsmooth fractional programming problems with\nfixed-point constraints, where the numerator is convex and the denominator is\nconcave. To solve this problem, we propose splitting algorithms that compute\nsubgradient steps separately for the convex numerator and the concave\ndenominator. These methods offer a straightforward approach by eliminating the\nneed to solve subproblems at each iteration. By leveraging fixed-point\nconstraints, the proposed algorithms are particularly well-suited for problems\nwith complex constraint structures. Under certain assumptions, we establish the\nconvergence of the proposed methods. Furthermore, to address large-scale\noptimization, we propose an incremental subgradient algorithm for a class of\nnonsmooth sum-of-ratios fractional programming problems and analyze its\nconvergence. Finally, we present numerical experiments, including comparative\nanalyses of our algorithms with existing methods, to demonstrate the\neffectiveness and performance of the proposed approach.",

To address this issue, we propose a correspondence-driven\nhyperfunction $\\phi^{\\text{cd}}$. In this formulation, the follower is modeled\nnot as a rational agent always attaining a global minimizer, but as an\nalgorithm-based bounded rational agent whose decisions are produced by a fixed\nalgorithm with initialization and step size. Since $\\phi^{\\text{cd}}$ is\ngenerally discontinuous, we apply Gaussian smoothing to obtain a smooth\napproximation $\\phi^{\\text{cd}}_\\xi$, then show that its value and gradient\nconverge to those of $\\phi^{\\text{cd}}$. In the nonconvex setting, we identify\nthat bifurcation phenomena, which arise when $g(x,\\cdot)$ has a degenerate\nstationary point, pose a key challenge for hyperfunction-based methods. This is\nespecially the case when $\\phi^{\\text{cd}}_\\xi$ is solved using gradient\nmethods. To overcome this challenge, we analyze the geometric structure of the\nbifurcation set under some weak assumptions. Building on these results, we\ndesign a biased projected SGD-based algorithm SCiNBiO to solve\n$\\phi^{\\text{cd}}_\\xi$ with a cubic-regularized Newton lower-level solver. We\nalso provide convergence guarantees and oracle complexity bounds for the upper\nlevel. Finally, we connect bifurcation theory from dynamical systems to the\nbilevel setting and define the notion of fold bifurcation points in this\nsetting. Under the assumption that all degenerate stationary points are fold\nbifurcation points, we establish the oracle complexity of SCiNBiO for the\nlower-level problem.",

State-of-the-art SSL methods such as\nMean Teacher, FixMatch and Cross Pseudo Supervision (CPS) are mainly based on\nconsistency regularization or pseudo-label supervision between a reference\nprediction and a supervised prediction. Despite the effectiveness, they have\noverlooked the potential noise in the labeled data, and mainly focus on\nstrategies to generate the reference prediction, while ignoring the\nheterogeneous values of different unlabeled pixels. We argue that effectively\nmining the rich information contained by the two predictions in the loss\nfunction, instead of the specific strategy to obtain a reference prediction, is\nmore essential for SSL, and propose a universal framework MetaSSL based on a\nspatially heterogeneous loss that assigns different weights to pixels by\nsimultaneously leveraging the uncertainty and consistency information between\nthe reference and supervised predictions. Specifically, we split the\npredictions on unlabeled data into four regions with decreasing weights in the\nloss: Unanimous and Confident (UC), Unanimous and Suspicious (US), Discrepant\nand Confident (DC), and Discrepant and Suspicious (DS), where an adaptive\nthreshold is proposed to distinguish confident predictions from suspicious\nones. The heterogeneous loss is also applied to labeled images for robust\nlearning considering the potential annotation noise. Our method is\nplug-and-play and general to most existing SSL methods.

In this paper, we relax\nthese out-of-control assumptions and present a novel design that generalizes\nperformative prediction to nonlinear cases while preserving essential\ntheoretical properties. Specifically, we formulate the loss function of\nperformative prediction using a maximum margin approach and extend it to\nnonlinear spaces through kernel methods. To quantify the data distribution\nshift, we employ the discrepancy between prediction errors on these two\ndistributions as an indicator, which characterizes the impact of the\nperformative effect on specific learning tasks. By doing so, we can derive, for\nboth linear and nonlinear cases, the conditions for performative stability, a\ncritical and desirable property in performative contexts. Building on these\ntheoretical insights, we develop an algorithm that guarantees the performative\nstability of the predictive model.

    "abstract": "Emotion recognition based on electroencephalography (EEG) signals is\nincreasingly becoming a key research hotspot in affective Brain-Computer\nInterfaces (aBCIs). However, the current transfer learning model greatly\ndepends on the source domain and target domain data, which hinder the practical\napplication of emotion recognition. Therefore, we propose a Multi-domain\nAggregation Transfer Learning framework for EEG emotion recognition with\nDomain-Class prototype under unseen targets (MATL-DC). We design the feature\ndecoupling module to decouple class-invariant domain features from\ndomain-invariant class features from shallow features. In the model training\nstage, the multi-domain aggregation mechanism aggregates the domain feature\nspace to form a superdomain, which enhances the characteristics of emotional\nEEG signals. In each superdomain, we further extract the class prototype\nrepresentation by class features. In addition, we adopt the pairwise learning\nstrategy to transform the sample classification problem into the similarity\nproblem between sample pairs, which effectively alleviates the influence of\nlabel noise. It is worth noting that the target domain is completely unseen\nduring the training process. In the inference stage, we use the trained\ndomain-class prototypes for inference, and then realize emotion recognition. We\nrigorously validate it on the publicly available databases (SEED, SEED-IV and\nSEED-V). The results show that the accuracy of MATL-DC model is 84.70\\%,\n68.11\\% and 61.08\\%, respectively. MATL-DC achieves comparable or even better\nperformance than methods that rely on both source and target domains. The\nsource code is available at https://github.com/WuCB-BCI/MATL-DC.",

However, the majority of material\ngeneration methods are trained on synthetic data. Synthetic data provides\nprecise supervision for material maps, which is convenient but also tends to\ncreate a significant visual gap with real-world materials. Alternatively,\nrecent work used a small dataset of real flash photographs to guarantee\nrealism, however such data is limited in scale and diversity. To address these\nlimitations, we propose RealMat, a diffusion-based material generator that\nleverages realistic priors, including a text-to-image model and a dataset of\nrealistic material photos under natural lighting. In RealMat, we first finetune\na pretrained Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL) with synthetic material maps arranged\nin $2 \\times 2$ grids. This way, our model inherits some realism of SDXL while\nlearning the data distribution of the synthetic material grids. Still, this\ncreates a realism gap, with some generated materials appearing synthetic. We\npropose to further finetune our model through reinforcement learning (RL),\nencouraging the generation of realistic materials. We develop a realism reward\nfunction for any material image under natural lighting, by collecting a\nlarge-scale dataset of realistic material images.

Functional space exhibits asymmetric spatial\nseparations, which deviate from the symmetry axiom of metric space commonly\nadopted as a representation of the geographical space.

Technically, spatial models and analysis methods grounded in a\nEuclidean representation of the geographical space have their capability to\nhandle the functional space of geographical phenomena restricted by the\ninherency of the symmetry axiom. In this study, we aim at differentiating and\ncharacterizing the spatial dependency and heterogeneity of asymmetric spatial\nseparations.

The model takes account of\nspatial dependency and heterogeneity of asymmetry and can capture local\nasymmetric structures of spatial separations.

Accordingly, we develop a sensitivity-informed repeated\nretraining algorithm that adjusts players' loss functions based on the\nsensitivity measure, guaranteeing convergence to performatively stable\nequilibria for arbitrary data distribution maps.

However, current\napproaches face challenges such as joint training at transceivers, leading to\nredundant data exchange and reliance on labeled datasets, which limits their\ntask-agnostic utility. To address these challenges, we propose a novel\nframework called Goal-oriented Invariant Representation-based SC (SC-GIR) for\nimage transmission. Our framework leverages self-supervised learning to extract\nan invariant representation that encapsulates crucial information from the\nsource data, independent of the specific downstream task. This compressed\nrepresentation facilitates efficient communication while retaining key features\nfor successful downstream task execution. Focusing on machine-to-machine tasks,\nwe utilize covariance-based contrastive learning techniques to obtain a latent\nrepresentation that is both meaningful and semantically dense. To evaluate the\neffectiveness of the proposed scheme on downstream tasks, we apply it to\nvarious image datasets for lossy compression. The compressed representations\nare then used in a goal-oriented AI task. Extensive experiments on several\ndatasets demonstrate that SC-GIR outperforms baseline schemes by nearly 10%,,\nand achieves over 85% classification accuracy for compressed data under\ndifferent SNR conditions. These results underscore the effectiveness of the\nproposed framework in learning compact and informative latent representations.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we propose Ocior, a practical asynchronous Byzantine\nfault-tolerant (BFT) consensus protocol that achieves the optimal performance\nin resilience, communication, computation, and round complexity. Unlike\ntraditional BFT consensus protocols, Ocior processes incoming transactions\nindividually and concurrently using parallel instances of consensus. While\nleader-based consensus protocols rely on a designated leader to propose\ntransactions, Ocior is a leaderless consensus protocol that guarantees stable\nliveness. Ocior achieves: 1) Optimal resilience: Ocior tolerates up to $t$\nfaulty nodes controlled by an adaptive adversary, for $n\\geq 3t+1$. 2) Optimal\ncommunication complexity: The total expected communication per transaction is\n$O(n)$. 3) Optimal (or near-optimal) computation complexity: The total\ncomputation per transaction is $O(n)$ in the best case, or $O(n \\log^2 n)$ in\nthe worst case. 4) Optimal round complexity: A legitimate two-party transaction\ncan be finalized with a good-case latency of two asynchronous rounds, for any\n$n\\geq 3t+1$. The good case in terms of latency refers to the scenario where\nthe transaction is proposed by any (not necessarily designated) honest node. A\ntwo-party transaction involves the transfer of digital assets from one user (or\ngroup of users) to one or more recipients. To support efficient consensus, we\nintroduce a novel non-interactive threshold signature (TS) scheme called\nOciorBLSts. It offers fast signature aggregation, and is adaptively secure.\nOciorBLSts achieves a computation complexity of signature aggregation of only\n$O(n)$ in the good cases. Moreover, OciorBLSts supports the property of\nInstantaneous TS Aggregation. This enables real-time aggregation of partial\nsignatures as they arrive, reducing waiting time and improving responsiveness.",

Then, we parameterize each region as a 2D Gaussian (mean for position,\ncovariance for shape) coupled with texture features. A specialized transformer\nis trained to optimize the Gaussian parameters, enabling continuous adaptation\nof position/shape and content-aware feature extraction. During decoding,\nGaussian parameterized tokens are reconstructed into 2D feature maps through a\ndifferentiable splatting-based renderer, bridging our adaptive tokenization\nwith standard decoders for end-to-end training.

    "abstract": "Layout-to-image (L2I) generation has exhibited promising results in natural\ndomains, but suffers from limited generative fidelity and weak alignment with\nuser-provided layouts when applied to degraded scenes (i.e., low-light,\nunderwater). We primarily attribute these limitations to the \"contextual\nillusion dilemma\" in degraded conditions, where foreground instances are\noverwhelmed by context-dominant frequency distributions. Motivated by this, our\npaper proposes a new Frequency-Inspired Contextual Disentanglement Generative\n(FICGen) paradigm, which seeks to transfer frequency knowledge of degraded\nimages into the latent diffusion space, thereby facilitating the rendering of\ndegraded instances and their surroundings via contextual frequency-aware\nguidance. To be specific, FICGen consists of two major steps. Firstly, we\nintroduce a learnable dual-query mechanism, each paired with a dedicated\nfrequency resampler, to extract contextual frequency prototypes from\npre-collected degraded exemplars in the training set. Secondly, a\nvisual-frequency enhanced attention is employed to inject frequency prototypes\ninto the degraded generation process. To alleviate the contextual illusion and\nattribute leakage, an instance coherence map is developed to regulate\nlatent-space disentanglement between individual instances and their\nsurroundings, coupled with an adaptive spatial-frequency aggregation module to\nreconstruct spatial-frequency mixed degraded representations. Extensive\nexperiments on 5 benchmarks involving a variety of degraded scenarios-from\nsevere low-light to mild blur-demonstrate that FICGen consistently surpasses\nexisting L2I methods in terms of generative fidelity, alignment and downstream\nauxiliary trainability.",

Robix further introduces novel\ncapabilities such as proactive dialogue, real-time interruption handling, and\ncontext-aware commonsense reasoning during task execution. At its core, Robix\nleverages chain-of-thought reasoning and adopts a three-stage training\nstrategy: (1) continued pretraining to enhance foundational embodied reasoning\nabilities including 3D spatial understanding, visual grounding, and\ntask-centric reasoning; (2) supervised finetuning to model human-robot\ninteraction and task planning as a unified reasoning-action sequence; and (3)\nreinforcement learning to improve reasoning-action consistency and long-horizon\ntask coherence.

Equalizing the channel effect and\ntracking the phase noise necessitate dense pilot insertion. Direction-Shift\nKeying (DSK), a recent variant of Spatial Modulation (SM), addresses these\nchallenges by encoding information in the Direction-of-Arrival (DoA) using a\ndistributed antenna system (DAS), rather than relying on amplitude or phase.\nDSK has been shown to extend coherence time by up to four orders of magnitude.\nDespite its promise, existing DSK studies are largely simulation-based and\nlimited to simplified roadside unit scenarios and mobile device (MD) equipped\nwith only two antennas. DSK's performance in general settings, along with the\nfundamental laws governing its behavior, such as coherence time and resilience\nto phase noise, remain open problems. In this paper, we derive the structure of\nthe optimal detector for the case of $M$-antenna MD. Then, we establish the\ngoverning law for DSK's coherence time, termed the Direction Coherence Time\n(DCT), defining the the temporal duration over which the DoA remains\napproximately invariant. We analytically establish that DCT scales with $d/v$\n(transmitter-receiver distance over velocity), while the Channel Coherence Time\n(CCT) scales with $\\lambda/v$, revealing a coherence time gain on the order of\n$d/\\lambda$ (equivalent to more than four orders of magnitude.) Furthermore, we\nprove that DSK inherently cancels the phase noise, requiring no additional\ncompensation. Analytical predictions are validated through simulations,\nconfirming the robustness and scalability of DSK in high-frequency mobile\nenvironments.",

The method is implemented for a\ntwo-dimensional side-heated cavity at high Rayleigh numbers $10^6 \\leq Ra \\leq\n10^8$, and for a three-dimensional side-heated cavity at $10^5 \\leq Ra \\leq\n10^7$, with the Prandtl number fixed at $Pr=0.71$.

Performance metrics, including million\nlattice updates per second (MLUPS) and wall-clock time per dimensionless time\nunit (WCTpDT), indicate that the ISLBM offers one to three orders of magnitude\nhigher efficiency in large-scale simulations.

Most existing approaches consist of two stages: detecting human\ninstances in each image frame and then using a temporal model for single-person\npose estimation. This approach separates the spatial and temporal dimensions\nand cannot capture the global spatio-temporal context between spatial instances\nfor end-to-end optimization. In addition, it relies on separate detectors and\ncomplex post-processing such as RoI cropping and NMS, which reduces the\ninference efficiency of the video scene. To address the above problems, we\npropose VEPE (Video End-to-End Pose Estimation), a simple and flexible\nframework for end-to-end pose estimation in video. The framework utilizes three\ncrucial spatio-temporal Transformer components: the Spatio-Temporal Pose\nEncoder (STPE), the Spatio-Temporal Deformable Memory Encoder (STDME), and the\nSpatio-Temporal Pose Decoder (STPD). These components are designed to\neffectively utilize temporal context for optimizing human body pose estimation.\nFurthermore, to reduce the mismatch problem during the cross-frame pose query\nmatching process, we propose an instance consistency mechanism, which aims to\nenhance the consistency and discrepancy of the cross-frame instance query and\nrealize the instance tracking function, which in turn accurately guides the\npose query to perform cross-frame matching.

To investigate this, we\npropose a framework for curating naturally evolved, human-edited variants of\nreading passages from contemporary QA benchmarks and for analyzing LLM\nperformance across a range of semantic similarity scores, which quantify how\nclosely each variant aligns with content seen during pretraining. Using this\nframework, we evaluate six QA datasets and eight LLMs with publicly available\ntraining data. Our experiments reveal that LLM performance declines as reading\npassages naturally diverge from the versions encountered during\npretraining-even when the question and all necessary information remains\npresent at inference time.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in\nleveraging extensive external knowledge to enhance responses in multi-turn and\nagentic applications, such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). However,\nprocessing long-context inputs introduces significant system latency and\ndemands substantial memory for the key-value cache, resulting in reduced\nthroughput and a fundamental trade-off between knowledge enrichment and system\nefficiency. While minimizing latency for long-context inputs is a primary\nobjective for LLMs, we contend that RAG require specialized consideration. In\nRAG, much of the LLM context consists of concatenated passages from retrieval,\nwith only a small subset directly relevant to the query. These passages often\nexhibit low semantic similarity due to diversity or deduplication during\nre-ranking, leading to block-diagonal attention patterns that differ from those\nin standard LLM generation tasks. Based on this observation, we argue that most\ncomputations over the RAG context during decoding are unnecessary and can be\neliminated with minimal impact on performance. To this end, we propose REFRAG,\nan efficient decoding framework that compresses, senses, and expands to improve\nlatency in RAG applications. By exploiting the sparsity structure, we\ndemonstrate a 30.85 the time-to-first-token acceleration (3.75 improvement to\nprevious work) without loss in perplexity. In addition, our optimization\nframework for large context enables REFRAG to extend the context size of LLMs\nby 16. We provide rigorous validation of REFRAG across diverse long-context\ntasks, including RAG, multi-turn conversations, and long document\nsummarization, spanning a wide range of datasets. Experimental results confirm\nthat REFRAG delivers substantial speedup with no loss in accuracy compared to\nLLaMA models and other state-of-the-art baselines across various context sizes.",

Many broadly applicable control variates are\nbased on the Langevin-Stein operator, which leverages gradient information from\nany gradient-based sampler to produce variance-reduced estimators of\nexpectations. These control variates typically require optimising over a\nfunction $u(\\theta)$ within a user-defined functional class $G$, such as the\nspace of $Q$th-order polynomials or a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. We\npropose using averaging-based ensemble learning to construct Stein-based\ncontrol variates.

Parametric RAG (PRAG) addresses this by encoding\ndocuments as LoRA within LLMs, enabling reasoning without exposing raw content.\nHowever, it still faces two issues: (1) PRAG demands synthesizing QA pairs and\nfine-tuning LLM for each individual document to create its corresponding LoRA,\nleading to unacceptable inference latency. (2) The performance of PRAG relies\nsolely on synthetic QA data, lacking internal alignment with standard RAG,\nresulting in poor generalization on out-of-distribution(OOD) inputs. Therefore,\nachieving high-efficiency parameterization while maintaining RAG-level\nperformance remains a critical challenge for privacy-preserving reasoning. In\nthis paper, we propose DistilledPRAG, a generalizable knowledge-distilled\nparametric RAG model aligned with standard RAG in document structure and\nparameter activation. We first synthesize QA pairs from single and\nmulti-documents to enhance cross-document reasoning. Then, we mask the\nplaintext documents with a special token and translate them to LoRA via a\nparameter generator, maintaining the standard RAG document structure. Finally,\nguided by synthetic QA data, we train the parameter generator to match standard\nRAG's hidden states and output logits, enabling RAG-style reasoning without\noriginal documents.

Experimental results on the LibriMix dataset show that, although\nthe LLM-based SOT model performs well in the two-talker scenario, it fails to\nfully leverage LLMs under more complex conditions, such as the three-talker\nscenario. The proposed SOP approach significantly improved performance under\nboth two- and three-talker conditions.",

Building on this\nfoundation, we present SpectMamba, the first Mamba-based architecture designed\nfor medical image detection. A key component of SpectMamba is the Hybrid\nSpatial-Frequency Attention (HSFA) block, which separately learns high- and\nlow-frequency features. This approach effectively mitigates the loss of\nhigh-frequency information caused by frequency bias and correlates\nfrequency-domain features with spatial features, thereby enhancing the model's\nability to capture global context. To further improve long-range dependencies,\nwe propose the Visual State-Space Module (VSSM) and introduce a novel Hilbert\nCurve Scanning technique to strengthen spatial correlations and local\ndependencies, further optimizing the Mamba framework.

To address this challenge, we propose a\nnovel physical law-corrected prior Gaussian process (LC-prior GP) surrogate\nmodeling framework that effectively integrates data-driven learning with\nunderlying physical constraints to flexibly handle multi-coupled variables\ndefined on complex geometries. The proposed approach leverages proper\northogonal decomposition (POD) to parameterize high-dimensional PDE solutions\nvia their dominant modes and associated coefficients, thereby enabling\nefficient Gaussian process (GP) surrogate modeling within a reduced-dimensional\ncoefficient space. A key contribution lies in the incorporation of physical\nlaws together with a limited number of parameter samples to correct the GP\nposterior mean, thus avoiding reliance on computationally expensive numerical\nsolvers. Furthermore, interpolation functions are constructed to describe the\nmapping from the full parameter space to the physics-based correction term.\nThis mapping is subsequently backpropagated to constrain the original GP\nsurrogate, yielding a more physically consistent conditional prior. To handle\nirregular geometries, the radial basis function-finite difference (RBF-FD)\nmethod is incorporated during training set computation, with its inherent\ndifferentiation matrices providing both computational efficiency and numerical\naccuracy for physical constraint optimization.

We validate this inverse-image construction by deriving a\ntractable convex reformulation and establishing rigorous statistical\nguarantees, including finite-sample performance and asymptotic consistency.\nCrucially, we demonstrate that, under mild conditions, noisy data may be a\n``blessing in disguise.\" Our noisy-data DRO model is less conservative than its\ndirect counterpart, leading to provably higher optimal values and a lower price\nof ambiguity.

    "abstract": "White dwarfs (WDs) represent the final evolutionary stage of most stars,\ntypically originating from progenitor stars with masses below approximately 8\n$M_{\\odot}$ to 10 $M_{\\odot}$. Formation through single-star evolution\ngenerally requires at least 25 Myr, with the youngest WDs often near the\nChandrasekhar limit of 1.4 $M_{\\odot}$. In contrast, WDs formed via binary\nchannels, such as mergers or mass transfer, can develop smaller masses in a\nshorter timescale and may exhibit unique characteristics, including strong\nsurface magnetic fields and rapid rotation. Accurately determining the ages of\nthese WDs is essential for understanding their formation. A valuable method\ninvolves studying WDs in star clusters, where member stars share the same age\nand chemical composition, allowing for precise constraints on the formation\ntimes and metallicities of the WDs' progenitors. Here we report a WD found in\nthe open cluster RSG 5, which is only 35 Myr old. The WD's mass is lower than\n1.05 $M_{\\odot}$, indicating it may not have formed through single-star\nevolution. The WD possesses an exceptionally strong surface magnetic field\n($\\ge 200$ MG), a short rotational period ($\\sim 6.5$ min), and, most notably,\na co-rotating half-ring of ionized circumstellar debris. This distinctive\nfeature provides evidence for a binary merger origin, a scenario further\nsubstantiated by our stellar evolution models.",

Such shifts encompass\n(i) variations in low level image statistics, (ii) changes in object pose and\nviewpoint, (iii) partial occlusion, and (iv) visual confusion across adjacent\nclasses. To mitigate this degradation, we introduce the Re-Thinking Vision\nLanguage Model (RT-VLM) framework. The foundation of this framework is a unique\nsynthetic dataset generation pipeline that produces images annotated with\n\"4-Clues\": precise bounding boxes, class names, detailed object-level captions,\nand a comprehensive context-level caption for the entire scene. We then perform\nparameter efficient supervised tuning of Llama 3.2 11B Vision Instruct on this\nresource. At inference time, a two stage Re-Thinking scheme is executed: the\nmodel first emits its own four clues, then re examines these responses as\nevidence and iteratively corrects them. Across robustness benchmarks that\nisolate individual domain shifts, RT-VLM consistently surpasses strong\nbaselines. These findings indicate that the integration of structured\nmultimodal evidence with an explicit self critique loop constitutes a promising\nroute toward reliable and transferable visual understanding.",

Although the EP and the bifurcation point originate from\nfundamentally different physical concepts, the bifurcation point is observable\nand retains key EP characteristics even above the lasing threshold.

While it is commonly assumed that training on more historical data\nwould improve model performance and robustness, data distribution shifts over\ntime may undermine these benefits. This study examines how expanding historical\ndata training windows under covariate shifts (changes in feature distributions)\nand concept shifts (changes in feature-outcome relationships) affects the\nperformance and algorithmic fairness of predictive models. First, we perform a\nsimulation study to explore scenarios with varying degrees of covariate and\nconcept shifts in training data. Absent distribution shifts, we observe\nperformance gains from longer training windows though they reach a plateau\nquickly; in the presence of concept shift, performance may actually decline.\nCovariate shifts alone do not significantly affect model performance, but may\ncomplicate the impact of concept shifts. In terms of fairness, models produce\nmore biased predictions when the magnitude of concept shifts differs across\nsociodemographic groups; for intersectional groups, these effects are more\ncomplex and not simply additive. Second, we conduct an empirical case study of\nstudent retention prediction, a common machine learning application in\neducation, using 12 years of student records from 23 minority-serving community\ncolleges in the United States. We find concept shifts to be a key contributor\nto performance degradation when expanding the training window. Moreover, model\nfairness is compromised when marginalized populations have distinct data\ndistribution shift patterns from their peers.

    "abstract": "We investigate an optimal control problem for a diffusion whose drift and\nrunning cost are merely measurable in the state variable. Such low regularity\nrules out the use of Pontryagin's maximum principle and also invalidates the\nstandard proof of the Bellman principle of optimality. We address these\ndifficulties by analyzing the associated Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB)\nequation. Using PDE techniques together with a policy iteration scheme, we\nprove that the HJB equation admits a unique strong solution, and this solution\ncoincides with the value function of the control problem. Based on this\nidentification, we establish a verification theorem and recover the Bellman\noptimality principle without imposing any additional smoothness assumptions.\n  We further investigate a mollification scheme depending on a parameter\n$\\varepsilon > 0$. It turns out that the smoothed value functions\n$V_{\\varepsilon}$ may fail to converge to the original value function $V$ as\n$\\varepsilon \\to 0$, and we provide an explicit counterexample. To resolve\nthis, we identify a structural condition on the control set. When the control\nset is countable, convergence $V_{\\varepsilon} \\to V$ holds locally uniformly.",

A critical yet often\noverlooked factor is the consistency of response style, which could affect the\ntrust of affected individuals in responders. Despite its importance, few\nstudies have explored methods for maintaining stylistic consistency across\ngenerated responses. To address this gap, we propose a novel metric for\nevaluating style consistency and introduce a fusion-based generation approach\ngrounded in this metric. Our method employs a two-stage process: it first\nassesses the style of candidate responses and then optimizes and integrates\nthem at the instance level through a fusion process. This enables the\ngeneration of high-quality responses while significantly reducing stylistic\nvariation between instances.

A\ncost--aware portfolio optimiser translates the model's conditional densities\ninto implementable trading strategies under leverage, turnover and\nno--trade--band constraints.

    "abstract": "We address in this paper a fundamental question that arises in mean-field\ngames (MFGs), namely whether mean-field equilibria (MFE) for discrete-time\nfinite-horizon MFGs can be used to obtain approximate stationary as well as\nnon-stationary MFE for similarly structured infinite-horizon MFGs. We provide a\nrigorous analysis of this relationship, and show that any accumulation point of\nMFE of a discounted finite-horizon MFG constitutes, under weak convergence as\nthe time horizon goes to infinity, a non-stationary MFE for the corresponding\ninfinite-horizon MFG. Further, under certain conditions, these non-stationary\nMFE converge to a stationary MFE, establishing the appealing result that\nfinite-horizon MFE can serve as approximations for stationary MFE.\nAdditionally, we establish improved contraction rates for iterative methods\nused to compute regularized MFE in finite-horizon settings, extending existing\nresults in the literature. As a byproduct, we obtain that when two MFGs have\nfinite-horizon MFE that are close to each other, the corresponding stationary\nMFE are also close. As one application of the theoretical results, we show that\nfinite-horizon MFGs can facilitate learning-based approaches to approximate\ninfinite-horizon MFE when system components are unknown. Under further\nassumptions on the Lipschitz coefficients of the regularized system components\n(which are stronger than contractivity of finite-horizon MFGs), we obtain\nexponentially decaying finite-time error bounds -- in the time horizon --\nbetween finite-horizon non-stationary, infinite-horizon non-stationary, and\nstationary MFE. As a byproduct of our error bounds, we present a new uniqueness\ncriterion for infinite-horizon nonstationary MFE beyond the available\ncontraction results in the literature.",

    "abstract": "Many methods have been developed to predict static protein structures,\nhowever understanding the dynamics of protein structure is essential for\nelucidating biological function. While molecular dynamics (MD) simulations\nremain the in silico gold standard, its high computational cost limits\nscalability. We present DynaProt, a lightweight, SE(3)-invariant framework that\npredicts rich descriptors of protein dynamics directly from static structures.\nBy casting the problem through the lens of multivariate Gaussians, DynaProt\nestimates dynamics at two complementary scales: (1) per-residue marginal\nanisotropy as $3 \\times 3$ covariance matrices capturing local flexibility, and\n(2) joint scalar covariances encoding pairwise dynamic coupling across\nresidues. From these dynamics outputs, DynaProt achieves high accuracy in\npredicting residue-level flexibility (RMSF) and, remarkably, enables reasonable\nreconstruction of the full covariance matrix for fast ensemble generation.\nNotably, it does so using orders of magnitude fewer parameters than prior\nmethods. Our results highlight the potential of direct protein dynamics\nprediction as a scalable alternative to existing methods.",

    "abstract": "Noisy pursuit in complex environments drives emergent collective behaviors in\nactive matter systems. A compelling platform to study the impact of environment\ncues is provided by the standard Vicsek model for studying flocking and\nswarming phenomena. In this study, we explore the collective dynamics of Vicsek\nagents in a complex noise environment, featuring a noiseless circular region\n($\\eta_{\\text{c}} = 0.0$) surrounded by a noisy outer region ($\\eta_{\\text{b}}\n= 1.0$, tunable), with a mutually repelling interactions. By varying the outer\nnoise intensity, we observe an emergent rotational order ($\\phi_r$) that peaks\nat higher noise levels ($\\eta_{\\text{b}}\\sim 1$), as revealed by phase and\nsusceptibility plots. Global order follows ($\\phi$) follows a `U' shaped curve,\n$\\phi \\sim 0.965$ at $\\eta_b=0$, dies down to $\\phi \\sim 0.57$ at $\\eta_b=0.9$\nand re-enters at $\\eta_b > 1$ and peaks $\\phi \\sim 0.960$ at $\\eta_b=1.5$. The\nlatter rise attributing to $\\phi_r$ increase. Higher particle velocities\nenhance escape rates ($\\kappa$) from the circular region, with slower-moving\nagents exhibiting greater virtual confinement. We quantify escape dynamics\nthrough time-averaged and first-passage escape rates, demonstrating\nvelocity-dependent retention on the probability of finding the bi-motility\nagent flocks at a give time resulting in segregation and trapping. Introducing\na gradual noise increase from the circle's center to the outer region reduces\nboth global ($\\phi$) and rotational ($\\phi_r$) order, underscoring the impact\nof environmental heterogeneity and sudden annealing over gradual change. These\nfindings offer insights into predicting and manipulating active agent dynamics\nin heterogeneous environments, with applications in biological and synthetic\nswarming systems.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) struggle to navigate culturally specific\ncommunication norms, limiting their effectiveness in global contexts. We focus\non Persian taarof, a social norm in Iranian interactions, which is a\nsophisticated system of ritual politeness that emphasizes deference, modesty,\nand indirectness, yet remains absent from existing cultural benchmarks. We\nintroduce TaarofBench, the first benchmark for evaluating LLM understanding of\ntaarof, comprising 450 role-play scenarios covering 12 common social\ninteraction topics, validated by native speakers. Our evaluation of five\nfrontier LLMs reveals substantial gaps in cultural competence, with accuracy\nrates 40-48% below native speakers when taarof is culturally appropriate.\nPerformance varies between interaction topics, improves with Persian-language\nprompts, and exhibits gender-based asymmetries. We also show that responses\nrated \"polite\" by standard metrics often violate taarof norms, indicating the\nlimitations of Western politeness frameworks. Through supervised fine-tuning\nand Direct Preference Optimization, we achieve 21.8% and 42.3% improvement in\nmodel alignment with cultural expectations. Our human study with 33\nparticipants (11 native Persian, 11 heritage, and 11 non-Iranian speakers)\nforms baselines in varying degrees of familiarity with Persian norms. This work\nlays the foundation for developing diverse and culturally aware LLMs, enabling\napplications that better navigate complex social interactions.",

Using a pulse per second signal synchronized\nwith a time frequency standard, we successfully timestamped the reference\nanalog signals, achieving synchronization between reference analog standards\nand digital-output sensors. Example calibrations were conducted on a\ndigital-output MEMS module consisting of a DPS310 MEMS pressure sensor and an\nESP32 microcontroller, in the 0.2 Hz to 4 Hz range.

    "abstract": "Images taken through window glass are often degraded by contaminants adhered\nto the glass surfaces. Such contaminants cause occlusions that attenuate the\nincoming light and scatter stray light towards the camera. Most of existing\ndeep learning methods for neutralizing the effects of contaminated glasses\nrelied on synthetic training data. Few researchers used real degraded and clean\nimage pairs, but they only considered removing or alleviating the effects of\nrain drops on glasses. This paper is concerned with the more challenging task\nof learning the restoration of images taken through glasses contaminated by a\nwide range of occluders, including muddy water, dirt and other small foreign\nparticles found in reality. To facilitate the learning task we have gone to a\ngreat length to acquire real paired images with and without glass contaminants.\nMore importantly, we propose an all-in-one model to neutralize contaminants of\ndifferent types by utilizing the one-shot test-time adaptation mechanism. It\ninvolves a self-supervised auxiliary learning task to update the trained model\nfor the unique occlusion type of each test image. Experimental results show\nthat the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods\nquantitatively and qualitatively in cleaning realistic contaminated images,\nespecially the unseen ones.",
