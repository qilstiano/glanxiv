    "abstract": "This study systematically investigates the effect of stretching boundary\nconditions, ranging from conservation of cross-sectional area to conservation\nof volume, on the rupture behavior of phantom star polymer networks using\nenergy-minimizing coarse-grained molecular simulations. By continuously varying\nthe deformation parameter, the simulations reveal that true stress and rupture\ncharacteristics, such as strain and stress at break and work for rupture,\nsystematically decrease as the boundary condition approaches cross-sectional\narea conservation. In contrast, nominal stress and the corresponding rupture\ncharacteristics exhibit near-independence from boundary conditions, indicating\nthat bond tension remains largely unaffected for phantom networks under the\nexamined conditions. These results clarify that volume expansion primarily\ndrives deviations in true stress and highlight a critical distinction between\ntrue and nominal stress-strain definitions. The difference between true and\nnominal stress-strain relations also affected the scaling exponent for strand\nlength dependence on stretch at break. The findings stress the importance of\nspecifying both deformation boundary conditions and stress-strain definitions\nin polymer network simulations for accurate interpretation of mechanical\nproperties.",

To\naddress these issues, I work at the cohort-period level and introduce the\n\\textit{block bias}-the parallel-trends violation for a cohort relative to its\nanchored initial control group-whose interpretation is consistent across pre-\nand post-treatment periods. For both the imputation estimator and the estimator\nin Callaway and Sant'Anna (2021) that uses not-yet-treated units as controls, I\nshow an invertible decomposition linking these estimators' biases in\npost-treatment periods to block biases. This allows researchers to place\ntransparent restrictions on block biases (e.g., Relative Magnitudes and Second\nDifferences) and conduct robust inference using the algorithm from Rambachan\nand Roth (2023). In simulations, when parallel-trends violations differ across\ncohorts, my framework yields better-centered (and sometimes narrower)\nconfidence sets than the aggregated approach. In a reanalysis of the effect of\nminimum-wage changes on teen employment in the Callaway and Sant'Anna (2021)\napplication, my inference framework with the Second Differences restriction\nyields confidence sets centered well below zero, indicating robust negative\neffects, whereas inference based on aggregated coefficients yields sets\ncentered near zero.

In this work,\nwe introduce the TSAIA Benchmark, a first attempt to evaluate LLMs as\ntime-series AI assistants. To ensure both scientific rigor and practical\nrelevance, we surveyed over 20 academic publications and identified 33\nreal-world task formulations.

We apply this benchmark to assess eight\nstate-of-the-art LLMs under a unified evaluation protocol.

    "abstract": "Efficient scheduling of parallel computation resources across multiple jobs\nis a fundamental problem in modern cloud/edge computing systems for many\nAI-based applications. Allocating more resources to a job accelerates its\ncompletion, but with diminishing returns. Prior work (heSRPT) solved this\nproblem only for some specific speedup functions with an exponential form,\nproviding a closed-form solution. However, the general case with arbitrary\nconcave speedup functions -- which more accurately capture real-world workloads\n-- has remained open.\n  In this paper, we solve this open problem by developing optimal scheduling\nalgorithms for parallel jobs under general concave speedup functions. We first\ndiscover a fundamental and broadly-applicable rule for optimal parallel\nscheduling, namely the Consistent Derivative Ratio (CDR) Rule, which states\nthat the ratio of the derivatives of the speedup functions across active jobs\nremains constant over time. To efficiently compute the optimal allocations that\nsatisfy the CDR Rule, we propose the General Water-Filling (GWF) method, a more\ngeneral version of classical water-filling in wireless communications.\nCombining these insights, we design the SmartFill Algorithm to solve the\ngeneral scheduling problem. Unlike heSRPT, which always allocates resources to\nall active jobs, SmartFill selectively determines which jobs should receive\nresources and how much they should be allocated. For a broad class of so-called\n\\emph{regular} speedup functions, SmartFill yields closed-form optimal\nsolutions, while for non-regular functions it efficiently computes the optimum\nwith low complexity. Numerical evaluations show that SmartFill can\nsubstantially outperform heSRPT across a wide range of concave speedup\nfunctions.",

Bringing together our result with\npreviously known necessary conditions, we discover that, in the regime where\n$ds/p \\rightarrow +\\infty$, sparse recovery in the sparse setting exhibits a\nphase transition at an information-theoretic threshold of\n$n_{\\text{INF}}^{\\text{SP}} =\n\\Theta\\left(s\\log\\left(p/s\\right)/\\log\\left(ds/p\\right)\\right)$, where $p$\ndenotes the signal dimension, $s$ the number of non-zero components of the\nsignal, and $d$ the expected number of non-zero components per row of\nmeasurement.

An MTD is a Markov chain in\nwhich the transition probabilities are expressed as a convex combination of\nlower-order conditional distributions. Despite their generality, inference for\nMTD models has traditionally been limited by the need to estimate\nhigh-dimensional joint distributions. In particular, for a sample of size n,\nthe feasible order d of the MTD is typically restricted to d approximately\nO(log n). To overcome this limitation, Ost and Takahashi (2023) recently\nintroduced a computationally efficient non-parametric inference method that\nidentifies the relevant lags in high-order MTD models, even when d is\napproximately O(n), provided that the set of relevant lags is sparse. In this\narticle, we introduce hdMTD, an R package allowing us to estimate parameters of\nsuch high-dimensional Markovian models. Given a sample from an MTD chain, hdMTD\ncan retrieve the relevant past set using the BIC algorithm or the forward\nstepwise and cut algorithm described in Ost and Takahashi (2023). The package\nalso computes the maximum likelihood estimate for transition probabilities and\nestimates high-order MTD parameters through the expectation-maximization\nalgorithm. Additionally, hdMTD also allows for simulating an MTD chain from its\nstationary invariant distribution using the perfect (exact) sampling algorithm,\nenabling Monte Carlo simulation of the model. We illustrate the package's\ncapabilities through simulated data and a real-world application involving\ntemperature records from Brazil.",

This phenomenon can be identified with a spatial\nlearning process by the walker. Here we study theoretically and numerically how\nthe decay of memory impacts learning in these models. If memory decays as\n$1/\\tau$ or slower, where $\\tau$ is the time backward into the past, the\nlocalized solutions are the same as with perfect, non-decaying memory and they\nare linearly stable. If forgetting is faster than $1/\\tau$, for instance\nexponential, an unusual regime of intermittent localization is observed, where\nwell localized periods of exponentially distributed duration are interspersed\nwith intervals of diffusive motion. At the transition between the two regimes,\nfor a kernel in $1/\\tau$, the approach to the stable localized state is the\nfastest, opposite to the expected critical slowing down effect. Hence\nforgetting can allow the walker to save memory without compromising learning\nand to achieve a faster learning. These findings agree with biological evidence\non the benefits of forgetting.",

We ask whether the\nAlexander--Conway polynomial together with different types of quandle\ninvariants suffice. We show that the conjugation quandle of the dihedral group\n$D_5$, together with the Alexander--Conway polynomial, does distinguish the two\nlinks and hence likely does detect causality in $X$. The $2$-sky link shares\nthe same Alexander--Conway polynomial but has different $D_5$\nconjugation-quandle counting invariants. Moreover, for $D_5$ the counting\ninvariant alone already separates the pair, whereas for other small dihedral\ngroups $D_3$, $D_4$, $D_6$, $D_7$ even the enhanced counting polynomial fails\nto detect causality. In fact we prove more that the conjugation quandle over D5\ndistinguishes all the infinitely many Allen-Swenberg links from the connected\nsum of two Hopf links. These results present an interesting reality where only\nthe conjugation quandle over $D_5$ coupled with the Alexander--Conway\npolynomial can detect causality in $(2+1)$ dimensions.

    "abstract": "Reservoir computing (RC) is a state-of-the-art machine learning method that\nmakes use of the power of dynamical systems (the reservoir) for real-time\ninference. When using biological complex systems as reservoir substrates, it\nserves as a testbed for basic questions about bio-inspired computation -- of\nhow self-organization generates proper spatiotemporal patterning. Here, we use\na simulation of an active matter system, driven by a chaotically moving input\nsignal, as a reservoir. So far, it has been unclear whether such complex\nsystems possess the capacity to process information efficiently and\nindependently of the method by which it was introduced. We find that when\nswitching from a repulsive to an attractive driving force, the system\ncompletely changes the way it computes, while the predictive performance\nlandscapes remain nearly identical. The nonlinearity of the driver's injection\nforce improves computation by decoupling the single-agent dynamics from that of\nthe driver. Triggered are the (re-)growth, deformation, and active motion of\nsmooth structural boundaries (interfaces), and the emergence of coherent\ngradients in speed -- features found in many soft materials and biological\nsystems. The nonlinear driving force activates emergent regulatory mechanisms,\nwhich manifest enhanced morphological and dynamic diversity -- arguably\nimproving fading memory, nonlinearity, expressivity, and thus, performance. We\nfurther perform RC in a broad variety of non-equilibrium active matter phases\nthat arise when tuning internal (repulsive) forces for information transfer.\nOverall, we find that active matter agents forming liquid droplets are\nparticularly well suited for RC. The consistently convex shape of the\npredictive performance landscapes, together with the observed phenomenological\nrichness, conveys robustness and adaptivity.",

    "abstract": "We study the decomposition of the Wick powers of the continuum GFF in\ndimension $2$ via the first passage sets (FPS) and the excursion clusters (sign\ncomponents) of the GFF. These sets are non-thin for the GFF, that is to say the\nfield has non-trivial restriction to such a set, which is a measure, negative\nor positive depending on the sign. In this work we show that all the odd Wick\npowers of the GFF can be restricted to the FPS and the excursion clusters, and\nthe restrictions are generalized functions supported on these fractal sets. By\ncontrast, the restriction of an even Wick power to an FPS or excursion cluster\nis diverging, and to get something converging an additional compensation is\nrequired, which is provided by a smooth function living outside of the set and\nblowing up in a non-integrable way when approaching the set. We further provide\nexpressions of restricted odd Wick powers and restricted-compensated even Wick\npowers as limits of functions living outside the FPS/excursion cluster.\n  Then, we study the $\\varepsilon$-neighborhoods, in the sense of conformal\nradius, of first passage sets and excursion clusters. We show that such\n$\\varepsilon$-neighborhoods admit asymptotic expansions in $L^2$ into\nhalf-integer powers $\\vert\\log \\varepsilon\\vert^{-(n+1/2)}$, $n\\in\\mathbb{N}$,\nof $1/\\vert\\log \\varepsilon\\vert$. The coefficients of the expansion involve\nthe restrictions of the odd Wick powers. By contrast, the even Wick powers do\nnot appear in the expansion. Our expansion is reminiscent of Le Gall's\nexpansion for the Wiener sausage in dimension 2, with however some important\ndifferences. The most important one is that the powers of $1/\\vert\\log\n\\varepsilon\\vert$ are different. In the case of the Wiener sausage the powers\nare integer, $\\vert\\log \\varepsilon\\vert^{-n}$, $n\\in\\mathbb{N}\\setminus\n\\{0\\}$.",

    "abstract": "The UV-optical dust attenuation curve is key to interpreting the intrinsic\nproperties of galaxies and provides insights into the nature of dust grains and\ntheir geometry relative to stars. In this work, we constrain the UV-optical\nslope of the stellar attenuation curve using a spectroscopic-redshift sample of\n~3300 galaxies at z~1-9, to characterize the diversity and redshift evolution\nof stellar attenuation curves and to gain insight into dust production and\nevolution at high redshifts. The sample is constructed from three JWST/NIRCam\ngrism surveys in GOODS and A2744 fields, with a wealth of JWST/NIRCam and HST\nphotometry. With constraints from spectroscopic redshifts and emission line\nfluxes, we use the Prospector SED fitting code with a flexible dust model. We\nfind that the attenuation curve slope varies strongly with Av at all redshifts,\nbecoming flatter at higher attenuation. We find no strong correlation between\nattenuation curve slope and size or axis ratio, and the trends with stellar\nmass and star-formation rate are largely driven by their correlation with Av.\nWe find strong evidence that at fixed Av, the curve becomes flatter with\nincreasing redshift. On average, the attenuation curves derived here are\nshallower than those at z~0 and than the SMC curve. The highest redshift\ngalaxies at z=7-9 (124 galaxies, a significantly larger sample than in previous\nstudies) show slopes even flatter than the Calzetti curve, implying reduced UV\nobscuration and lower IR luminosities than expected from an SMC dust curve, by\nas large as an order of magnitude. Hydrodynamical simulations that couple dust\ngrowth to gas chemical enrichment successfully reproduce the different loci of\nhigh- and low-redshift galaxies in the slope-Av diagram, suggesting that dust\nin high-redshift galaxies is increasingly dominated by large grains produced in\nsupernova ejecta with limited ISM processing at early times.",

First, we focus on the\nbenchmark datasets that have been used to assess the methods proposed in\nresearch. We find that most prior work relied on datasets containing emails\nthat -- we argue -- are not representative of current trends, and mostly\nencompass the English language. Based on this finding, we then re-implement and\nre-assess a variety of detection methods reliant on machine learning (ML),\nincluding large-language models (LLM), and release all of our codebase -- an\n(unfortunately) uncommon practice in related research. We show that most such\nmethods achieve near-perfect performance when trained and tested on the same\ndataset -- a result which intrinsically hinders development (how can future\nresearch outperform methods that are already near perfect?). To foster the\ncreation of \"more challenging benchmarks\" that reflect current phishing trends,\nwe propose E-PhishGEN, an LLM-based (and privacy-savvy) framework to generate\nnovel phishing-email datasets. We use our E-PhishGEN to create E-PhishLLM, a\nnovel phishing-email detection dataset containing 16616 emails in three\nlanguages. We use E-PhishLLM to test the detectors we considered, showing a\nmuch lower performance than that achieved on existing benchmarks -- indicating\na larger room for improvement.

To answer this\nquestion, we systematically evaluate 7 LLMs (e.g., GPT and Gemini family)\nacross 6 benchmarks, including both multiple-choice and open-ended tasks on 12\ndiverse prompt templates.

When we adopt\nLLM-as-a-Judge evaluations, we observe a substantial reduction in performance\nvariance and a consistently higher correlation in model rankings across\nprompts.

First, we quantify the\nagreement of target displacement from VCs computed via Jacobians of the shape\nemulators with those from finite differences Jacobians on exact Grad-Shafranov\nsolutions. Good agreement ($\\approx$5-10%) can be achieved on a selection of\ngeometric targets using combinations of neural network emulators with\n$\\approx10^5$ parameters. A sample of $\\approx10^{5}-10^{6}$ synthetic\nequilibria is essential to train emulators that are not over-regularised or\noverfitting.

    "abstract": "In many materials, ordered phases and their order parameters are easily\ncharacterized by standard experimental methods. \"Hidden order\" refers to a\nphase transition in which an ordered state emerges without such an easily\ndetectable order parameter, despite clear thermodynamic evidence of the\ntransition. The underlying mechanisms for these unconventional states of matter\nstem from spin-orbit coupling, which intertwines inter-site exchange, classical\nelectron-magnetic interactions, and electron-lattice effects. This physics is\nelusive to experimental probes and beyond traditional theories of insulating\nmagnetism, requiring sophisticated methodologies for its exploration. In this\nReview, we survey exotic hidden-order phases in correlated insulators,\nparticularly focusing on the latest progress in material-specific theories and\nnumerical approaches. The relevant degrees of freedom in these phases are local\nhigh-rank multipole moments of magnetic and charge density that emerge from\nspin-orbit entangled correlated shells of heavy d and f electron ions and\ninteract on the lattice via various mechanisms. We discuss approaches to\nmodelling hidden orders in realistic systems via direct ab initio calculations\nor by constructing low-energy many-body effective Hamiltonian. We also describe\nhow these new theoretical tools have helped to uncover driving mechanisms for\nrecently discovered multipolar phases in double perovskites of heavy transition\nmetals, and how they have proved instrumental in disentangling the role of\nvarious interactions in \"traditional\" f-electron multipolar materials like\nactinide dioxides. In both cases, material-specific theories have played a key\nrole in interpreting and predicting experimental signatures of hidden orders.",

By applying a\ngeneralized $z$-transformation, GCR guarantees valid correlation matrices,\naccommodates unbalanced cluster sizes, and flexibly incorporates covariates\nsuch as time, space, or group membership into the dependence structure. Through\napplications to modern prenatal care, a longitudinal toenail infection trial,\nand clustered health count data, we show that GCR not only achieves superior\npredictive performance over standard methods, but also reveals family-,\ncommunity-, and individual-level drivers of dependence that are obscured under\nconventional modeling. These results demonstrate the broad applied value of GCR\nfor analyzing binary, count, and categorical data in clustered and longitudinal\nsettings.",

    "abstract": "Pre-trained language models (PLMs) have substantially advanced natural\nlanguage processing by providing context-sensitive text representations.\nHowever, the Algerian dialect remains under-represented, with few dedicated\nmodels available. Processing this dialect is challenging due to its complex\nmorphology, frequent code-switching, multiple scripts, and strong lexical\ninfluences from other languages. These characteristics complicate tokenization\nand reduce the effectiveness of conventional word- or subword-level approaches.\n  To address this gap, we introduce chDzDT, a character-level pre-trained\nlanguage model tailored for Algerian morphology. Unlike conventional PLMs that\nrely on token sequences, chDzDT is trained on isolated words. This design\nallows the model to encode morphological patterns robustly, without depending\non token boundaries or standardized orthography. The training corpus draws from\ndiverse sources, including YouTube comments, French, English, and Berber\nWikipedia, as well as the Tatoeba project. It covers multiple scripts and\nlinguistic varieties, resulting in a substantial pre-training workload.\n  Our contributions are threefold: (i) a detailed morphological analysis of\nAlgerian dialect using YouTube comments; (ii) the construction of a\nmultilingual Algerian lexicon dataset; and (iii) the development and extensive\nevaluation of a character-level PLM as a morphology-focused encoder for\ndownstream tasks.

Key\nparameters include cathode electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) and\ncatalyst layer thickness. Halving catalyst layer thickness increases FE to C2H4\nby 2% and lowers the cell voltage by 40 mV. In contrast, a tenfold decrease in\nECSA results increases the FE to C2H4 by 7% but leads increase cell voltage at\na given current density by 150 mV. This tradeoff occurs because the potential\ndistribution within the cathode catalyst layer is the primary driving force for\nC2H4 formation. Increased cell voltage also raises the energy cost of C2H4\nproduction. This model framework enables techno-economic assessments and\nidentifies key factors that must be optimized to enable economically viable\nproduction of C2H4 via electrochemical reduction of CO2.",

Yet in many applications it\nis unrealistic that no change occurs at all, or that after one change the time\nseries remains stationary forever. We introduce a new setup, modeling the\nsequence of means as a piecewise constant function with arbitrarily many\nchanges. Instead of testing for a change, we ask whether the evolving sequence\nof means, say $(\\mu_n)_{n \\geq 1}$, stays within a narrow corridor around its\ninitial value, that is, $\\mu_n \\in [\\mu_1-\\Delta, \\mu_1+\\Delta]$ for all $n \\ge\n1$.

To address the ill-posedness of LACT\nreconstruction, we propose a two-stage diffusion framework guided by structured\nclinical metadata. In the first stage, a transformer-based diffusion model\nconditioned exclusively on metadata, including acquisition parameters, patient\ndemographics, and diagnostic impressions, generates coarse anatomical priors\nfrom noise. The second stage further refines the images by integrating both the\ncoarse prior and metadata to produce high-fidelity results. Physics-based data\nconsistency is enforced at each sampling step in both stages using an\nAlternating Direction Method of Multipliers module, ensuring alignment with the\nmeasured projections. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real cardiac\nCT datasets demonstrate that incorporating metadata significantly improves\nreconstruction fidelity, particularly under severe angular truncation. Compared\nto existing metadata-free baselines, our method achieves superior performance\nin SSIM, PSNR, nMI, and PCC. Ablation studies confirm that different types of\nmetadata contribute complementary benefits, particularly diagnostic and\ndemographic priors under limited-angle conditions.

Unlike conventional data-driven models, our approach provides explicit\ncontrol over meaningful shape features (e.g., volatility level, slope,\ncurvature, term-structure) to generate IVSs with desired characteristics. In\nour framework, financially interpretable shape features are disentangled from\nresidual latent factors. The target features are embedded into the VAE\narchitecture as controllable latent variables, while the residual latent\nvariables capture additional structure to preserve IVS shape diversity. To\nenable this control, IVS feature values are quantified via regression at an\nanchor point and incorporated into the decoder to steer generation. Numerical\nexperiments demonstrate that the generative model enables rapid generation of\nrealistic IVSs with desired features rather than arbitrary patterns, and\nachieves high accuracy across both single- and multi-feature control settings.\nFor market validity, an optional post-generation latent-space repair algorithm\nadjusts only the residual latent variables to remove occasional violations of\nstatic no-arbitrage conditions without altering the specified features.\nCompared with black-box generators, the framework combines interpretability,\ncontrollability, and flexibility for synthetic IVS generation and scenario\ndesign.",

Oblivious\nMaps (OMAPs) mitigate this by fully hiding access patterns but suffer from high\noverhead due to randomized remapping and worst-case padding. We argue these\ncosts are not fundamental. Modern accelerators featuring High-Bandwidth Memory\n(HBM) offer a new opportunity: Vaswani et al. [OSDI'18] point out that\neavesdropping on HBM is difficult -- even for physical attackers -- as its\nmemory channels are sealed together with processor cores inside the same\nphysical package. Later, Hunt et al. [NSDI'20] show that, with proper\nisolation, HBM can be turned into an unobservable region where both data and\nmemory traces are hidden. This motivates a rethink of OMAP design with\nHBM-backed solutions to finally overcome their traditional performance limits.\nBuilding on these insights, we present BOLT, a Bandwidth Optimized,\nLightning-fast OMAP accelerator that, for the first time, achieves O(1) +\nO(log_2(log_2 (N))) bandwidth overhead. BOLT introduces three key innovations:\n(i) a new OMAP algorithm that leverages isolated HBM as an unobservable cache\nto accelerate oblivious access to large host memory; (ii) a self-hosted\narchitecture that offloads execution and memory control from the host to\nmitigate CPU-side leakage; and (iii) tailored algorithm-architecture co-designs\nthat maximize resource efficiency. We implement a prototype BOLT on a Xilinx\nU55C FPGA. Evaluations show that BOLT achieves up to 279x and 480x speedups in\ninitialization and query time, respectively, over state-of-the-art OMAPs,\nincluding an industry implementation from Facebook.",

NGC 4485 and\nNGC 4490 form the closest known pair of interacting late-type dwarf galaxies\n(at $\\sim 7.4$ Mpc), excluding the Magellanic Clouds. Near-infrared\ncolor-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) reveal a wide range of stellar populations in\nboth galaxies, including young ($\\lesssim 200$ Myr) upper main sequence stars,\ncore helium-burning stars, and oxygen-rich asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars.\nWe also identify intermediate-age ($\\sim 200$ Myr -- $1$ Gyr) carbon-rich AGB\nstars and a well-populated old ($\\gtrsim 1$ Gyr) red giant branch (RGB). The\nCMDs show two distinct bursts of star formation beginning $\\sim 30$ Myr and\n$\\sim 200$ Myr ago, the latter consistent with the most recent pericenter\npassage predicted by N-body simulations.

However, to store\nmany optimal trade-offs (the Pareto optima) at once, MOEAs are typically run\nwith a large, static population of solution candidates, which can slow down the\nalgorithm. We propose the dynamic NSGA-II (dNSGA-II), which is based on the\npopular NSGA-II and features a non-static population size. The dNSGA-II starts\nwith a small initial population size of four and doubles it after a\nuser-specified number $\\tau$ of function evaluations, up to a maximum size of\n$\\mu$.

For an optimal choice of $\\mu$ and $\\tau$, the resulting\n$O(n \\log(n))$ runtime improves the optimal expected runtime of the classic\nNSGA-II by a factor of $\\Theta(n)$. In addition, we show that the parameter\n$\\tau$ can be removed when utilizing concurrent runs of the dNSGA-II. This\napproach leads to a mild slow-down by a factor of $O(\\log(n))$ compared to an\noptimal choice of $\\tau$ for the dNSGA-II, which is still a speed-up of\n$\\Theta(n / \\log(n))$ over the classic NSGA-II.",

    "abstract": "We introduce in this paper an extension of the meta-analytic (MA) framework\nfor evaluating surrogate endpoints. While the MA framework is regarded as the\ngold standard for surrogate endpoint evaluation, it is limited in its ability\nto handle complex surrogates and does not take into account possible\ndifferences in the distribution of baseline covariates across trials. By\ncontrast, in the context of data fusion, the surrogate-index (SI) framework\naccommodates complex surrogates and allows for complex relationships between\nbaseline covariates, surrogates, and clinical endpoints. However, the SI\nframework is not a surrogate evaluation framework and relies on strong\nidentifying assumptions. To address the MA framework's limitations, we propose\nan extension that incorporates ideas from the SI framework. We first formalize\nthe data-generating mechanism underlying the MA framework, providing a\ntransparent description of the untestable assumptions required for valid\ninferences in any evaluation of trial-level surrogacy -- assumptions often left\nimplicit in the MA framework. While this formalization is meaningful in its own\nright, it is also required for our main contribution: We propose to estimate a\nspecific transformation of the baseline covariates and the surrogate, the\nso-called surrogate index. This estimated transformation serves as a new\npotential univariate surrogate and is optimal in a trial-level surrogacy sense\nunder certain conditions. We show that, under weak additional conditions, this\nnew univariate surrogate can be evaluated as a trial-level surrogate as if the\ntransformation were known a priori. This approach enables the evaluation of the\ntrial-level surrogacy of complex surrogates and can be implemented using\nstandard software. We illustrate this approach with a set of COVID-19 vaccine\ntrials where antibody markers are assessed as potential trial-level surrogate\nendpoints.",

    "abstract": "Quantum computing threatens to undermine classical cryptography by breaking\nwidely deployed encryption and signature schemes. This paper examines\nenterprise readiness for quantum-safe cybersecurity through three perspectives:\n(i) the technologist view, assessing the maturity of post-quantum cryptography\n(PQC) and quantum key distribution (QKD); (ii) the enterprise (CISO/CIO) view,\nanalyzing organizational awareness, risk management, and operational barriers;\nand (iii) the threat actor view, evaluating the evolving quantum threat and the\nurgency of migration. Using recent standards (e.g., NIST's 2024 PQC\nalgorithms), industry surveys, and threat intelligence, we synthesize findings\nvia a SWOT analysis to map strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats.\nResults indicate uneven and generally insufficient preparedness: while PQC\nstandards and niche QKD deployments signal technical progress, fewer than 5\\%\nof enterprises have formal quantum-transition plans, and many underestimate\n\"harvest now, decrypt later\" risks. Financial, telecom, and government sectors\nhave begun migration, but most industries remain exploratory or stalled by\ncosts, complexity, and skills gaps. Expert consensus places cryptanalytically\nrelevant quantum computers in the 2030s, yet delayed preparation could leave\ntoday's data vulnerable for decades. We recommend immediate steps: establishing\ncrypto-agility, creating quantum transition roadmaps, prioritizing PQC\ndeployment in high-value systems, and upskilling cybersecurity teams. A\ncoordinated, proactive approach is essential to secure current and future\ndigital assets in the quantum era.",

    "abstract": "Biases in machine learning pose significant challenges, particularly when\nmodels amplify disparities that affect disadvantaged groups. Traditional bias\nmitigation techniques often lead to a {\\itshape leveling-down effect}, whereby\nimproving outcomes of disadvantaged groups comes at the expense of reduced\nperformance for advantaged groups. This study introduces Bias Mitigation\nthrough Continual Learning (BM-CL), a novel framework that leverages the\nprinciples of continual learning to address this trade-off. We postulate that\nmitigating bias is conceptually similar to domain-incremental continual\nlearning, where the model must adjust to changing fairness conditions,\nimproving outcomes for disadvantaged groups without forgetting the knowledge\nthat benefits advantaged groups. Drawing inspiration from techniques such as\nLearning without Forgetting and Elastic Weight Consolidation, we reinterpret\nbias mitigation as a continual learning problem. This perspective allows models\nto incrementally balance fairness objectives, enhancing outcomes for\ndisadvantaged groups while preserving performance for advantaged groups.\nExperiments on synthetic and real-world image datasets, characterized by\ndiverse sources of bias, demonstrate that the proposed framework mitigates\nbiases while minimizing the loss of original knowledge. Our approach bridges\nthe fields of fairness and continual learning, offering a promising pathway for\ndeveloping machine learning systems that are both equitable and effective.",

We evaluate the combined effect of\nhybrid modeling and DA, using a particle filter which combines model reduction,\ntempering, jittering, and nudging.\n  Numerical experiments show that the hybrid model reproduces both the\nlarge-scale jet and small-scale vortices seen in high-resolution reference\nsimulations, but missing in the standard (non-hybrid) QG model. When DA is\nincorporated, the hybrid model further reduces tracking error and ensemble\ndivergence. Moreover, targeted assimilation from the most energetic region\nmatches tracking error and uncertainty reduction of full-domain networks,\nhighlighting the critical importance of observation network design.

    "abstract": "In quantum field theory, photon pairs can be excited out of the vacuum under\nthe influence of dynamical gravitational fields. If the classical\nelectromagnetic duality symmetry held at the quantum level, equal numbers of\nright- vs left-handed modes would be excited. However, a quantum chiral-like\nanomaly is known to affect this symmetry. In this work, we explore more\nexperimentally accessible manifestations of this anomaly in analogue-gravity\nsystems. Specifically, we describe the physical mechanism by which rotating,\naccelerating waveguides can induce an imbalance between right- and left-handed\nphotons excited from the vacuum -- effectively signaling the emergence of the\nelectromagnetic duality anomaly in controlled laboratory settings. To build\nphysical intuition, we review first the Adler-Bell-Jackiw anomaly in 1+1\ndimensions, which elegantly illustrates the connection between asymmetric\nparticle pair creation and chiral anomalies.",

The primary goal is to\novercome limitations inherent in conventional solutions such as TPA,\nBlockchain, ECDSA and ZSS which often fall short in terms of data protection,\ncomputational efficiency and scalability. Our proposed method strategically\nrefines and integrates these technologies to address their shortcomings while\nmaximizing their individual strengths. By doing so we create a more reliable\nand high-performance framework for secure data exchange across heterogeneous\nenvironments. The model leverages the combined potential of emerging\ntechnologies, particularly Blockchain, IoT and Cloud computing which when\neffectively coordinated offer significant advancements in security\narchitecture. The proposed framework consists of three core layers: (1) the\nH.E.EZ Layer which integrates improved versions of Hyperledger Fabric,\nEnc-Block and a hybrid ECDSA-ZSS scheme to improve encryption speed,\nscalability and reduce computational cost; (2) the Credential Management Layer\nindependently verifying data integrity and authenticity; and (3) the Time and\nAuditing Layer designed to reduce traffic overhead and optimize performance\nacross dynamic workloads.

We also observe that massive galaxies have fewer SFEs than low-mass\nsystems and that they form their stellar mass and reach quiescence faster than\nlower mass galaxies. Moreover, the history of mass assembly for the most\nmassive galaxies in the sample can be described with only one episode of star\nformation in the early Universe, which we detected as an exponential decrease\nthat was longer in duration than subsequent SF events.

    "abstract": "Interval censoring occurs when event times are only known to fall between\nscheduled assessments, a common design in clinical trials, epidemiology, and\nreliability studies. Standard right-censoring methods, such as Kaplan-Meier and\nCox regression, are not directly applicable and can produce biased results.\nThis study compares three complementary approaches for interval-censored\nsurvival data. First, the Turnbull nonparametric maximum likelihood estimator\n(NPMLE) via the EM algorithm recovers the survival distribution without strong\nassumptions. Second, Weibull and log-normal accelerated failure time (AFT)\nmodels with interval likelihoods provide smooth, covariate-adjusted survival\ncurves and interpretable time-ratio effects. Third, Bayesian AFT models extend\nthese tools by quantifying posterior uncertainty, incorporating prior\ninformation, and enabling interval-aware model comparisons via PSIS-LOO\ncross-validation. Simulations across generating distributions, censoring\nintensities, sample sizes, and covariate structures evaluated the integrated\nsquared error (ISE) for curve recovery, integrated Brier score (IBS) for\nprediction, and coverage for uncertainty calibration. Results show that the EM\nachieves the lowest ISE for distribution recovery, AFT models improve\npredictive performance when families are correctly specified, and Bayesian AFT\noffers calibrated uncertainty and principled model selection. An application to\nthe ovarian cancer dataset, restructured into interval-censored form,\ndemonstrates the workflow in practice: the EM algorithm reveals the baseline\nshape, parametric AFT provides covariate-adjusted predictions, and Bayesian AFT\nvalidates model adequacy through posterior predictive checks. Together, these\nmethods form a tiered strategy: EM for shape discovery, AFT for\ncovariate-driven prediction, and Bayesian AFT for complete uncertainty\nquantification and model comparison.",

Traditional\nreactive communication paradigms are ill-suited to these environments, as they\nfail to leverage the network's inherent predictability. This paper introduces\npredictive communication, a novel paradigm transforming network management from\nreactive adaptation to proactive optimization. The approach is enabled by\nfusing predictable mission trajectories with stable, large-scale radio\nenvironment models (e.g., radio maps). Specifically, we present a hierarchical\nframework that decomposes the predictive cross-layer resource allocation\nproblem into three layers: strategic (routing), tactical (timing), and\noperational (power). This structure aligns decision-making timescales with the\naccuracy levels and ranges of available predictive information. We demonstrate\nthat this foresight-driven framework achieves an order-of-magnitude reduction\nin cross-tier interference, laying the groundwork for robust and scalable\nlow-altitude communication systems.",

AmphiKey offers two\ndistinct operational modes within a single framework: an Authenticated Mode and\na Deniable Mode. The Authenticated Mode employs a blackbox approach, combining\nephemeral ML-KEM-768 and X25519 with long-term Raccoon DSA keys to provide\nforward secrecy and strong, non-repudiable authenticity. This design achieves\n\"OR\" confidentiality, where security holds if either of the KEMs is unbroken,\nand robust \"AND\" authenticity. For the signature operation, it leverages the\n'masking-friendly' Raccoon digital signature (DSA), which is specifically\ndesigned for side-channel attack resistance, though this protection is\nlocalized to the signing key and does not provide deniability. In contrast,\nDeniable Mode provides deniable authentication, preserving privacy. The\nprotocol used ML-KEM-768 (AKEM-1), Ephemeral X25519 (AKEM-2), Raccoon-based DSA\n(Rac) (compared performance to ML-DSA-65), and the Ascon cipher to deliver its\nsecurity guarantees. Key contributions include providing a flexible protocol\nwith enhanced security, optional deniability, and efficiency adapted to the\ndiverse needs of the smart grid infrastructure. We present a comprehensive\nperformance evaluation on a heterogeneous testbed featuring a powerful server\nand client (AMD Ryzen 5) and a resource-constrained client (Raspberry Pi). In\nefficient Deniable mode, the full handshake completes in 0.15 ms on the server\nand 0.41 ms on the Raspberry Pi client.

The temporal dynamics of superradiance can be tuned\nvia external experimental parameters, unlike those of spontaneous emission.\nIncorporating superradiance into quantum state engineering could therefore\nprovide more accessible control over quantum systems. Motivated by this, we\npresent a theoretical model for an ensemble of atoms in a V - type three -\nlevel configuration. Our numerical data are analyzed against key superradiance\ncharacteristics. The system successively emits a pair of superradiance pulses,\neffectively synthesizing the dynamically decoupled sub - ensembles into a\nsingle macroscopic ensemble involving all atoms.

A prominent example is the distribution of commercial activities and\nother Points of Interest (POIs) across cities. However, the mechanisms by which\nsuch heavy-tailed behaviors emerge from local urban dynamics remain poorly\nunderstood. In this work, we demonstrate that global inhomogeneity in the\nspatial distribution of POIs can arise from the aggregation of locally\nhomogeneous processes.\n  Using Foursquare data from the city of Bologna, we show that POI\ndistributions exhibit clear power-law scaling when analyzed at city scale. We\ndevelop a theoretical framework in which this behavior naturally emerges from\nspatial clusters defined by shared intensity levels across disjoint areas,\nrather than spatial contiguity. By analytically and empirically linking these\nlocal processes to the observed global distribution, we provide a generative\nexplanation for the emergence of scale-free patterns in urban commercial\nstructure.\n  To further relax the assumptions underlying the purely spatial model, and to\naccount for the empirical observation that areas with similar activity\nintensity can be spatially disjoint, we introduce a hybrid hierarchical\napproach that combines spatial clustering with statistical heterogeneity across\nregions of comparable density, modeled via Poisson mixtures. This enables us to\ncapture real-world deviations from local regularity while preserving\ninterpretability.\n  Our findings highlight a key insight: complex global phenomena in cities can\narise from the spatial superposition of simple, locally uniform dynamics.

Conjugative plasmids are ubiquitous mobile\ngenetic elements that mediate such exchanges both within and between species.\nTherefore, predicting whether a plasmid can invade and be maintained by a\nmicrobial community is critical, for example when assessing the risks of\nantimicrobial resistance gene spread in commensal or environmental microbiomes.\nHowever, existing theory developed to assist such predictions has generally\nfocused on the balance among plasmid costs, benefits, and infection rates,\noverlooking other relevant factors such as the inherent dynamics and diversity\nof microbiomes. Here, we hypothesize that plasmid persistence in the absence of\npositive selection can arise purely from the heterogeneity present in large and\ndiverse microbial communities. We introduce a generic model that integrates\npopulation-level dynamics with plasmid conjugation. Using this model, we show\nthat we can predict plasmid maintenance, and that the probability for a plasmid\nto be maintained depends on traits of the plasmid, most importantly the\nconjugation rate, and the species abundance distribution of the community.\nThen, using both empirical abundance data and extensive numerical simulations,\nwe demonstrate that the inherent randomness of ecological interactions and\nconjugation rates enables plasmid persistence -- even in the absence of\npositive selection.

    "abstract": "Satellite kinematics offers a powerful method to infer dynamical halo masses\nand has been demonstrated to yield tight constraints on the galaxy-halo\nconnection. However, previous studies have assumed that the halos in which the\nsatellites orbit are composed solely of dark matter, neglecting the role of\nbaryons. Here, we develop an analytical model incorporating stars, gas, and the\nadiabatic response of dark matter to assess the impact of baryonic effects on\nthe inference from satellite kinematics. The model covers halos in the mass\nrange $10^{12}-10^{15}M_\\odot$ and is tuned to agree with well-established\nobservational scaling relations. In addition, the model uses simple functional\nforms for the mass fractions of ejected baryons and diffuse halo stars,\ncalibrated to the median trends in the EAGLE hydrodynamical simulations. We\nfind that baryonic effects mainly result in a reduction of the satellite\nline-of-sight velocity dispersion due to the ejection of baryons and the\nresulting response of the dark matter halo. The effect is minimal (less than\n1%) for the most massive halos, but reaches ~5-6% for halos in the mass range\n$10^{12}-10^{13}M_\\odot$, and up to 8% in extreme cases. We propose a simple\nformalism for correcting the satellite line-of-sight velocity dispersion for\nbaryonic effects, and for marginalizing over the uncertainties. We integrate\nthis correction function into BASILISK, a Bayesian hierarchical inference\nmethod applied to satellite kinematics data extracted from large redshift\nsurveys, and find that this shifts central galaxies to higher inferred halo\nmasses at fixed luminosity by up to ~0.3 dex. In a forthcoming work, we\ndemonstrate that these few-percent level baryonic effects can have a\nnon-negligible impact on the inference of cosmological parameters, motivating a\nnovel approach to constraining the efficiency of feedback processes associated\nwith galaxy formation.",

We\nrobustly characterise the 150 MHz activity CHIME-detected FRB sources relative\nto their 600 MHz activity -- using their non-detection in 473 h of archival\nobservations from the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) Tied-Array All-Sky Survey\n(LOTAAS), and 252 h of LOFAR observations of 14 repeating FRB sources, the\nlargest sub-300 MHz targeted FRB campaign to date.\n  In the LOTAAS data, we search for repeat bursts from 33 CHIME/FRB repeaters,\n10 candidate repeaters and 430 apparent non-repeaters. Their non-detection\nyields a population-level constraint on the statistical spectral index\n$\\alpha_{s, 150MHz/600MHz}>-0.9$, indicating that FRB spectral indices are, on\naverage, flatter than known spectral indices from pulsars. From the targeted\ncampaign, we find that the prolific repeater FRB 20201124A shows a positive\n$\\alpha_s>0.55$, implying reduced low-frequency activity, unlike the typically\nnegative $\\alpha_{s}$ seen from FRBs at higher frequency bands. We explore\nfree-free absorption in the circumburst environment as a cause of the\nnon-detection at 150 MHz. The non-detection of FRB 20201124A is consistent with\neither a very young $\\sim10$ yr old supernova remnant, or a typical HII region.\n  Our simulations indicate that LOFAR2.0 can detect 0.3-9 FRBs per week, and up\nto 4 FRBs at redshifts in the range $1<z<3$.

    "abstract": "Existing agents for solving tasks such as ML engineering rely on prompting\npowerful language models. As a result, these agents do not improve with more\nexperience. In this paper, we show that agents backed by weaker models that\nimprove via reinforcement learning (RL) can outperform agents backed by much\nlarger, but static models. We identify two major challenges with RL in this\nsetting. First, actions can take a variable amount of time (e.g., executing\ncode for different solutions), which leads to asynchronous policy gradient\nupdates that favor faster but suboptimal solutions. To tackle variable-duration\nactions, we propose duration-aware gradient updates in a distributed\nasynchronous RL framework to amplify high-cost but high-reward actions. Second,\nusing only test split performance as a reward provides limited feedback. A\nprogram that is nearly correct is treated the same as one that fails entirely.\nTo address this, we propose environment instrumentation to offer partial\ncredit, distinguishing almost-correct programs from those that fail early\n(e.g., during data loading). Environment instrumentation uses a separate static\nlanguage model to insert print statement to an existing program to log the\nagent's experimental progress, from which partial credit can be extracted as\nreward signals for learning. Our experimental results on MLEBench suggest that\nperforming gradient updates on a much smaller model (Qwen2.5-3B) trained with\nRL outperforms prompting a much larger model (Claude-3.5-Sonnet) with agent\nscaffolds, by an average of 22% across 12 Kaggle tasks.",

A\nnovel technique we develop is to treat matter lines in the bulk as\nend-of-the-world (EOW) branes, allowing us to implement a splitting and gluing\nprocedure on the bulk spacetime. This geometric procedure gives rise to the\nstructure of two-sided multi-particle wormhole Hilbert space. In contrast to\nprevious Hilbert space constructions in DSSYK, the length basis in our case\nfactorizes across the subregions, whereas the energy basis acquires a\nnon-local, state-dependent structure determined by the EOW brane quantization\nin each subregion. Different choices of splitting correspond to distinct\nrepresentations of the same Hilbert space, all of which are equivalent for\nphysical observables. Based on this framework, we compute general correlation\nfunctions, including the OTOC, and show that they exactly reproduce the DSSYK\nresults obtained from chord diagrams. By calculating the OTOC in different\nrepresentations, we uncover a new identity for the 6j-symbol of the quantum\ngroup $\\mathcal{U}_q(su(1,1))$.

    "abstract": "Within hierarchical triple stellar systems, there exists a tidal process\nunique to them, known as tertiary tides. In this process, the tidal deformation\nof a tertiary in a hierarchical triple drains energy from the inner binary,\ncausing the inner binary's orbit to shrink. Previous work has uncovered the\nrate at which tertiary tides drain energy from inner binaries, as a function of\norbital and tidal parameters, for hierarchical triples in which the orbits are\nall circular and coplanar. However, not all hierarchical triples have orbits\nwhich are circular and coplanar, which requires an understanding of what\nhappens when this condition is relaxed. In this paper, we study how\neccentricities affect tertiary tides, and their influence on the subsequent\ndynamical evolution of the host hierarchical triple. We find that\neccentricities in the outer orbit undergo tidal circularisation as quickly as\nbinary tidal synchronisation, and are therefore trivial, but that\neccentricities in the inner binary completely change the behaviour of tertiary\ntides, draining energy from the outer orbit as well as the inner orbit. As with\nthe circular orbit case, tertiary tides become significant when the tertiary is\nlarge enough to come close to filling its Roche Lobe, and dominate tidal\nevolution when interactions between the inner binary pair are weak. Empirical\nequations that approximate this behaviour are provided for ease of implementing\nthis process in other stellar evolution codes, and the implications of these\nresults are discussed.",

The fermion production efficiency\ndepends critically on the particle mass, which is generated via the Yukawa\ncoupling and sensitive to the corresponding scalar field value. During\ninflation, scalar fields experience large quantum fluctuations driving the\naverage field values to the Hubble scale and above. This applies, in\nparticular, to the Higgs field, making the Standard Model fermions very heavy\nand facilitating their production. Using the Bogolyubov coefficient approach,\nwe compute the corresponding fermion abundance taking into account time\ndependence of the mass term. We find that the Standard Model fermion and the\nright-handed neutrino production grows dramatically compared to the naive\nestimate based on the low energy masses. The inflationary production mechanism\ncan be the leading source of the right handed neutrinos, if they gain a\nMajorana mass from the Yukawa coupling to a light scalar.

In contrast, blue central galaxies typically\nexhibit almost no alignment signal, owing to a stronger internal misalignment\nwith their halo. We investigated how the internal alignment between the\nprincipal axes of the stellar and dark matter components evolves over time as a\nfunction of the total mass of central galaxies at z=0. In particular, we aim to\nunderstand why disk-dominated, blue central galaxies often show weak or absent\nalignment signals with the galaxy distribution in their group and in the\nlarger-scale cosmic structure. We used data from the IllustrisTNG300-1 run and\nselected a sample of bright central galaxies at z=0. We computed the principal\naxes of the stellar and dark matter components, along with their angular\nmomenta, to obtain the various alignment angles analyzed in this study. Also,\nwe used the merger trees to determine the number of major mergers between z=20\nand z=0, and to track their shapes along their main branch. We examined\nsecondary dependencies of the galaxy-halo alignment on properties such as color\nand merger history. We analyzed how shape alignments relate to the dynamical\ncoupling between the angular momentum directions of the stellar and dark matter\ncomponents. The results show that massive centrals tend to align with the shape\nof their inner halo, and they are typically red and have undergone numerous\nmergers. Lower-mass red centrals, and those that have experienced many mergers\nexhibit the strongest evolution toward alignment. Blue centrals, in contrast,\nare more strongly influenced by the link between the stellar and dark matter\nangular momenta, such that they evolve toward either alignment or misalignment\nwith both the shape and angular momentum of the inner halo.",

    "abstract": "Spiral arms play a central role in disc galaxies, but their dynamical nature\nremains a long-standing open question. Azimuthal offsets between molecular gas\nand star formation are expected if gas crosses spiral arms, as predicted by\nquasi-stationary density wave theory. In this work, we measure offsets between\nCO and Halpha peaks in radial bins for 24 galaxies from the PHANGS survey that\ndisplay a well-delineated spiral structure. The offsets exhibit substantial\nscatter, implying that star formation is not exclusively initiated at a\ncoherent spiral shock. We define offsets such that positive values mean Halpha\npeaks lie ahead of CO peaks in the direction of galactic rotation. With this\nconvention, 14 galaxies show mean positive CO-Halpha offsets, typically of a\nfew hundred parsecs. In four of these 14 galaxies (17% of the total), offsets\nbecome smaller with increasing radius, as expected for a single\nquasi-stationary spiral density wave. Ten galaxies (42%) show positive mean\noffsets but no clear correlation with radius, which is compatible with multiple\noverlapping modes. In the remaining ten galaxies (42%), we find no\nsignificantly positive offsets, which could point to transient dynamical\nspirals or material arms, where gas and stars co-rotate with the spiral\nperturbation. Across the full sample, we find mostly positive offsets between\nCO peaks and the gravitational potential minimum, confirming that gas often\ncrosses the spiral perturbation. For the four galaxies with clear positive\noffsets and a radial trend, we derived pattern speeds in good agreement with\nthe literature. Overall, our results suggest that even well-delineated spirals\nin the local Universe can arise from a variety of underlying dynamical\nmechanisms.",

Furthermore, we demonstrate that the efficiency remains above\n80% of its maximum over a frequency range of 70 GHz. Finally, we generate a\nstring of photons from a single waveguide-embedded SnV center using a train of\nexcitation pulses and send these through the QFC.

    "abstract": "Quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) are X-ray transients characterized by nearly\nregular recurring flares from galactic nuclei. Recent observations have\nconfirmed that some QPEs occur in galactic centers that experienced a tidal\ndisruption event (TDE) a few years earlier. This may be reasonably explained if\nQPEs are produced when a star orbiting a supermassive black hole passes through\nan accretion disk formed by the TDE. Based on this scenario, we investigate the\nexpected QPE signatures in the early stages of TDEs, taking into account the\ntime evolution of the accretion disk. In the early phase, the disk is in a\nsuper-Eddington accretion state. The interaction between the star and such a\nslim disk results in QPEs with durations of $\\sim 100-1000\\,{\\rm s}$ and\ntemperatures of $\\sim 1-100\\,{\\rm keV}$, which are significantly shorter and\nhotter than those of the currently detected QPE population. These events are\ndetectable with current X-ray telescopes, but their small duty cycle\n($\\lesssim1\\,\\%$) and the potential presence of a massive disk wind may make\ndetection challenging. We encourage early-time and long-term monitoring TDEs\nshowing X-rays to capture these QPEs, as such detections would provide valuable\ninsights into the disk formation process in TDEs.",

    "abstract": "Fake news detection is an important and challenging task for defending online\ninformation integrity. Existing state-of-the-art approaches typically extract\nnews semantic clues, such as writing patterns that include emotional words,\nstylistic features, etc. However, detectors tuned solely to such semantic clues\ncan easily fall into surface detection patterns, which can shift rapidly in\ndynamic environments, leading to limited performance in the evolving news\nlandscape. To address this issue, this paper investigates a novel perspective\nby incorporating news intent into fake news detection, bridging intents and\nsemantics together. The core insight is that by considering news intents, one\ncan deeply understand the inherent thoughts behind news deception, rather than\nthe surface patterns within words alone. To achieve this goal, we propose\nGraph-based Intent-Semantic Joint Modeling (InSide) for fake news detection,\nwhich models deception clues from both semantic and intent signals via\ngraph-based joint learning. Specifically, InSide reformulates news semantic and\nintent signals into heterogeneous graph structures, enabling long-range context\ninteraction through entity guidance and capturing both holistic and\nimplementation-level intent via coarse-to-fine intent modeling. To achieve\nbetter alignment between semantics and intents, we further develop a dynamic\npathway-based graph alignment strategy for effective message passing and\naggregation across these signals by establishing a common space. Extensive\nexperiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of the\nproposed InSide compared to state-of-the-art methods.",

    "abstract": "Mobile manipulation stands as a core challenge in robotics, enabling robots\nto assist humans across varied tasks and dynamic daily environments.\nConventional mobile manipulation approaches often struggle to generalize across\ndifferent tasks and environments due to the lack of large-scale training.\nHowever, recent advances in manipulation foundation models demonstrate\nimpressive generalization capability on a wide range of fixed-base manipulation\ntasks, which are still limited to a fixed setting. Therefore, we devise a\nplug-in module named MoTo, which can be combined with any off-the-shelf\nmanipulation foundation model to empower them with mobile manipulation ability.\nSpecifically, we propose an interaction-aware navigation policy to generate\nrobot docking points for generalized mobile manipulation. To enable zero-shot\nability, we propose an interaction keypoints framework via vision-language\nmodels (VLM) under multi-view consistency for both target object and robotic\narm following instructions, where fixed-base manipulation foundation models can\nbe employed. We further propose motion planning objectives for the mobile base\nand robot arm, which minimize the distance between the two keypoints and\nmaintain the physical feasibility of trajectories. In this way, MoTo guides the\nrobot to move to the docking points where fixed-base manipulation can be\nsuccessfully performed, and leverages VLM generation and trajectory\noptimization to achieve mobile manipulation in a zero-shot manner, without any\nrequirement on mobile manipulation expert data. Extensive experimental results\non OVMM and real-world demonstrate that MoTo achieves success rates of 2.68%\nand 16.67% higher than the state-of-the-art mobile manipulation methods,\nrespectively, without requiring additional training data.",

    "abstract": "While large-scale robot datasets have propelled recent progress in imitation\nlearning, learning from smaller task specific datasets remains critical for\ndeployment in new environments and unseen tasks. One such approach to few-shot\nimitation learning is retrieval-based imitation learning, which extracts\nrelevant samples from large, widely available prior datasets to augment a\nlimited demonstration dataset. To determine the relevant data from prior\ndatasets, retrieval-based approaches most commonly calculate a prior data\npoint's minimum distance to a point in the target dataset in latent space.\nWhile retrieval-based methods have shown success using this metric for data\nselection, we demonstrate its equivalence to the limit of a Gaussian kernel\ndensity (KDE) estimate of the target data distribution. This reveals two\nshortcomings of the retrieval rule used in prior work. First, it relies on\nhigh-variance nearest neighbor estimates that are susceptible to noise. Second,\nit does not account for the distribution of prior data when retrieving data. To\naddress these issues, we introduce Importance Weighted Retrieval (IWR), which\nestimates importance weights, or the ratio between the target and prior data\ndistributions for retrieval, using Gaussian KDEs. By considering the\nprobability ratio, IWR seeks to mitigate the bias of previous selection rules,\nand by using reasonable modeling parameters, IWR effectively smooths estimates\nusing all data points. Across both simulation environments and real-world\nevaluations on the Bridge dataset we find that our method, IWR, consistently\nimproves performance of existing retrieval-based methods, despite only\nrequiring minor modifications.",

We show that even though\nthe underlying ISM changes between starburst and Milky Way analogue models, the\nvelocity fluctuations in the turbulence of both models, but not the kinetic\nenergy fluctuations, can be normalized into a universal, single cascade,\n$u^2(k) \\propto k^{-3/2}$, where $u$ is the velocity and $k$ is the wavemode,\nindicating that the structure of the turbulence is robust to significant\nchanges in the ISM and SNe seeding.

    "abstract": "Optimising industrial processes is essential for enhancing profitability,\nefficiency, and sustainability. Conventional optimisation relies on\nequation-oriented (EO) glass-box models with fully specified equations and\naccessible derivatives. However, many real-world systems contain black-box\ncomponents (such as high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics simulators or\nproprietary unit models) that lack explicit formulations or analytic gradients.\nThis limits the applicability of derivative-based deterministic optimisation on\ngrey-box (glass-box/black-box) problems. The classical trust-region filter\n(TRF) algorithm offers a promising framework for such grey-box optimisation,\nbut often requires adjusting numerous tuning parameters and many black-box\nevaluations to converge. In this work, we extend the classical TRF method by\nintroducing four new variants that incorporate second-order information through\nlocal Hessian projections, improving robustness and reducing sensitivity to\ntuning parameters. We further integrate a flexible surrogate modelling\nframework, enabling the optimiser to switch between low-fidelity (linear,\nquadratic, simplified quadratic) and high-fidelity (Taylor series, Gaussian\nprocess) surrogates for local approximation of black-box components.\nPerformance is benchmarked on a suite of 25 grey-box test problems and several\nengineering case studies, including liquid-liquid extraction, pressure vessel\ndesign, alkylation process, and spring design. Across all cases, the new\nvariants achieved up to an order-of-magnitude reduction in iterations and\nblack-box evaluations relative to the classical TRF algorithm. These findings\ndemonstrate the new variants as efficient alternatives for grey-box process\nsystems optimisation.",

In this work,\nwe make three main contributions. First, we show that pretraining with\ndistillation yields models that exhibit remarkably better test-time scaling.\nSecond, we observe that this benefit comes with a trade-off: distillation\nimpairs in-context learning capabilities, particularly the one modeled via\ninduction heads. Third, to demystify these findings, we study distilled\npretraining in a sandbox of a bigram model, which helps us isolate the common\nprincipal factor behind our observations.

The recent discovery of 3I/ATLAS,\nthe second interstellar comet ever observed, offers a unique opportunity to\ninvestigate the physical and chemical properties of interstellar objects and to\ncompare them with those of comets in our own Solar System. In this Letter we\npresent the results of a 10-night spectroscopic and photometric monitoring\ncampaign with the 2.4 m Hiltner and 1.3 m McGraw-Hill telescopes at the MDM\nObservatory. The campaign was conducted between August 8 and 17 while 3I/ATLAS\nwas inbound at heliocentric distances of 3.2 - 2.9 au. Our observations\ncaptured the onset of optical gas-driven activity. Nightly spectra reveal a\nweak CN emission feature in the coma of 3I/ATLAS, absent during the first\nnights but steadily strengthening thereafter. We measure a CN production rate\nof $\\sim$8$\\times$10$^{23}$ s$^{-1}$, towards the lower end of activity\nobserved in Solar System comets. Simultaneous photometry also indicates a small\nbut measurable increase in the coma's radial profile and increasing $r$-band\n$Af\\rho$ with values in the order of $\\sim300$ cm. Our upper limit on the\nC$_2$-to-CN ratio ($\\log Q(\\mathrm{C}_2)/Q(\\mathrm{CN})<-1.05$) places 3I/ATLAS\namong the most carbon-chain depleted comets known. The derived gas-to-dust\nproduction ratio of $\\log Q (\\mathrm{CN})/Af\\rho<21.49$ is likewise at the low\nend of the Solar System comet distribution. Further observations of 3I/ATLAS\nare required to verify the apparent carbon-chain depletion and to explore\nwhether such composition represents a recurring trait of the interstellar comet\npopulation.",

The\ninitial results are promising: despite this simplification, OpenVision 2\ncompetitively matches the original model's performance on a broad set of\nmultimodal benchmarks while substantially cutting both training time and memory\nconsumption.

Additionally, many methods rely on holistic scoring,\noverlooking specific writing aspects such as grammar, vocabulary, and cohesion.\nTo address these challenges, this study proposes TransGAT, a novel approach\nthat integrates fine-tuned Transformer models with GNNs for analytic scoring.\nTransGAT combines the contextual understanding of Transformers with the\nrelational modeling strength of Graph Attention Networks (GAT). It performs\ntwo-stream predictions by pairing each fine-tuned Transformer (BERT, RoBERTa,\nand DeBERTaV3) with a separate GAT. In each pair, the first stream generates\nessay-level predictions, while the second applies GAT to Transformer token\nembeddings, with edges constructed from syntactic dependencies. The model then\nfuses predictions from both streams to produce the final analytic score.\nExperiments on the ELLIPSE dataset show that TransGAT outperforms baseline\nmodels, achieving an average Quadratic Weighted Kappa (QWK) of 0.854 across all\nanalytic scoring dimensions.

In this paper, we propose Learning to Coordinate (L2C), a general\nframework that meta-learns these hyperparameters, modeled by lightweight\nagent-wise neural networks, to adapt across diverse tasks and agent\nconfigurations. L2C differentiates end-to-end through the ADMM-DDP pipeline in\na distributed manner.

Training is further accelerated by\ntruncating iterations and meta-learning ADMM penalty parameters optimized for\nrapid residual reduction, with provable Lipschitz-bounded gradient errors. On a\nchallenging cooperative aerial transport task, L2C generates dynamically\nfeasible trajectories in high-fidelity simulation using IsaacSIM, reconfigures\nquadrotor formations for safe 6-DoF load manipulation in tight spaces, and\nadapts robustly to varying team sizes and task conditions, while achieving up\nto $88\\%$ faster gradient computation than state-of-the-art methods.",

Few-step\ndiffusion models reduce this cost to 2-8 denoising steps but still depend on\nlarge, uncompressed U-Net or diffusion transformer backbones, which are often\ntoo costly for full-precision inference without datacenter GPUs. These\nrequirements also limit existing post-training quantization methods that rely\non full-precision calibration.

By adjusting the few-step sampling trajectory, Q-Sched\nachieves full-precision accuracy with a 4x reduction in model size. To learn\nquantization-aware pre-conditioning coefficients, we propose the JAQ loss,\nwhich combines text-image compatibility with an image quality metric for\nfine-grained optimization.

We\nidentify two such biases: Marginal Distribution Asymmetry, where differences in\nentropy skew causal learning toward certain factorizations, and Marginal\nDistribution Shift Asymmetry, where repeated interventions cause faster shifts\nin some variables than in others. For the bivariate categorical setup with\nDirichlet priors, we illustrate how these biases can occur even in controlled\nsynthetic data. To examine their impact on gradient-based methods, we employ\ntwo simple models that derive causal factorizations by learning marginal or\nconditional data distributions - a common strategy in gradient-based causal\ndiscovery.

Due to the distinctive characteristics of modern Chinese\npoetry, it is difficult to identify whether a poem originated from humans or\nAI. The proliferation of AI-generated modern Chinese poetry has significantly\ndisrupted the poetry ecosystem. Based on the urgency of identifying\nAI-generated poetry in the real Chinese world, this paper proposes a novel\nbenchmark for detecting LLMs-generated modern Chinese poetry. We first\nconstruct a high-quality dataset, which includes both 800 poems written by six\nprofessional poets and 41,600 poems generated by four mainstream LLMs.\nSubsequently, we conduct systematic performance assessments of six detectors on\nthis dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that current detectors cannot be\nused as reliable tools to detect modern Chinese poems generated by LLMs. The\nmost difficult poetic features to detect are intrinsic qualities, especially\nstyle. The detection results verify the effectiveness and necessity of our\nproposed benchmark. Our work lays a foundation for future detection of\nAI-generated poetry.",

Deployed maliciously or\nerroneously, these agents could overload content providers. At the same time,\nweb agents can bypass CAPTCHAs and other defenses by mimicking user behavior or\nflood authentication systems with fake accounts. Yet providers must protect\ntheir services and content from denial-of-service attacks and scraping by web\nagents. In this paper, we design a framework that imposes tunable costs on\nagents before providing access to resources; we call this Web Agent Throttling.\nWe start by formalizing Throttling Gates as challenges issued to an agent that\nare asymmetric, scalable, robust, and compatible with any agent. Focusing on a\ncommon component -- the language model -- we require the agent to solve\nreasoning puzzles, thereby incurring excessive token-generation costs. However,\nwe find that using existing puzzles, e.g., coding or math, as throttling gates\nfails to satisfy our properties. To address this, we introduce rebus-based\nReasoning Gates, synthetic text puzzles that require multi-hop reasoning over\nworld knowledge (thereby throttling an agent's model). We design a scalable\ngeneration and verification protocol for such reasoning gates. Our framework\nachieves computational asymmetry, i.e., the response-generation cost is 9.2x\nhigher than the generation cost for SOTA models. We further deploy reasoning\ngates on a custom website and Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers and evaluate\nwith real-world web agents. Finally, we discuss the limitations and\nenvironmental impact of real-world deployment of our framework.",

We consider the dispersion effects within\nthe low-energy, effective field theory limit, and model the dispersion relation\nvia standard parameterized deformations. Such modified dispersion relations\nproduce two modifications to the burst waveform: a modification to the time of\narrival of the bursts in the detector, which appears as a 2.5PN correction to\nthe difference in burst arrival times, and a modification to the arrival time\nof individual orbital harmonics within the bursts themselves, resulting in a\nBessel-type amplitude modulation of the waveform. Using the Fisher information\nmatrix, we study projected constraints one might obtain with future\nobservations of repeating burst signals with LIGO. We find that the projected\nconstraints vary significantly depending on the theoretical mechanism producing\nthe modified dispersion.

    "abstract": "We investigate the out-of-equilibrium dynamics after a quantum quench of the\nreduced fidelities between the states of a subregion $A$ at different times.\nPrecisely, we consider the fidelity between the time-dependent state of $A$ and\nits initial value, as well as with the state at infinite time. We denote these\nfidelities as the reduced Loschmidt echo (RLE) and the final-state fidelity\n(FSF), respectively. If region $A$ is the full systems, the RLE coincide with\nthe standard Loschmidt echo. We focus on quenches from Gaussian states in\nseveral instances of the XY spin chain. In the hydrodynamic limit of long times\nand large sizes of $A$, with their ratio fixed, the reduced fidelities admit a\nquasiparticle picture interpretation. Interestingly, for some quenches in the\nhydrodynamic regime the RLE features a complicated structure with an infinite\nsequence of nested lightcones, corresponding to quasiparticles with arbitrary\nlarge group velocities. This leads to a ''staircase'' of cusp-like\nsingularities in the time-derivative of the fidelity. At the sub-hydrodynamic\nregime for some quenches the RLE exhibits cusp-like singularities, similar to\nthe so-called dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPT). We conjecture a\ncriterion for the occurrence of the DQPT and for the ''critical'' times at\nwhich the singularities occur. Finally, we discuss the hydrodynamic limit of\nthe FSF. In particular, we show that it provides a valuable tool to detect the\nso-called quantum Mpemba effect.",

    "abstract": "Recently, the emergence of multitask deep learning models has enhanced\ncatheterization procedures by providing tactile and visual perception data\nthrough an end-to-end architecture. This information is derived from a\nsegmentation and force estimation head, which localizes the catheter in X-ray\nimages and estimates the applied pressure based on its deflection within the\nimage. These stereo vision architectures incorporate a CNN-based\nencoder-decoder that captures the dependencies between X-ray images from two\nviewpoints, enabling simultaneous 3D force estimation and stereo segmentation\nof the catheter. With these tasks in mind, this work approaches the problem\nfrom a new perspective. We propose a novel encoder-decoder Vision Transformer\nmodel that processes two input X-ray images as separate sequences. Given\nsequences of X-ray patches from two perspectives, the transformer captures\nlong-range dependencies without the need to gradually expand the receptive\nfield for either image. The embeddings generated by both the encoder and\ndecoder are fed into two shared segmentation heads, while a regression head\nemploys the fused information from the decoder for 3D force estimation. The\nproposed model is a stereo Vision Transformer capable of simultaneously\nsegmenting the catheter from two angles while estimating the generated forces\nat its tip in 3D. This model has undergone extensive experiments on synthetic\nX-ray images with various noise levels and has been compared against\nstate-of-the-art pure segmentation models, vision-based catheter force\nestimation methods, and a multitask catheter segmentation and force estimation\napproach.

We propose an alternative hierarchical modeling\nframework that captures temporal trends in areal data through Gaussian\nprocesses that share spatial information via correlated variance components.\nThis allows the model to better capture shared patterns of variability across\nregions while preserving local temporal dynamics, offering a more flexible\nrepresentation of spatio-temporal processes.\n  Specifically, we extend independent Gaussian-process models for time-series\ndata to a spatially correlated framework by placing a conditional\nautoregressive (CAR) prior on the parameters governing the temporal variability\nand imposing a conditional dependence of the temporal range on the temporal\nvariance. We apply this model to two case studies: monthly malaria incidence in\nNiassa, Mozambique, and weekly food insecurity prevalence in Cameroon.\nInference is conducted within a Bayesian framework using approximate posterior\nsampling. Given the hierarchical structure of the model, we employ a\ncombination of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques, including the\nMetropolis-adjusted Langevin algorithm (MALA), Metropolis-Hastings, and Gibbs\nsampling.\n  In both applications, the model demonstrates strong in-sample performance\nwith narrow credible intervals and outperforms established spatio-temporal\napproaches in many regions when forecasting. These results underscore the\nmodel's ability to capture complex spatio-temporal dependencies while\nmaintaining interpretability, key in settings with sparse data and policy\nrelevance. By accounting for spatio-temporal variation through the evolution of\ntemporal dynamics themselves, our approach offers a flexible and principled\ntool for many applied contexts.",

Here, we\ndemonstrate that suitably engineered noise can induce a \"Zeno-like\"\nstabilization effect of the charging process in a spin-chain quantum battery\nwithin the Heisenberg XYZ model. Focusing on a system size N=6, which balances\ncomputational cost and storage capacity, we find that the ergotropy-to-energy\nratio W(t)/E_B(t) attains a maximum value of about 0.99 at a certain time\nparameter value. Then, by varying the noise strength in each channel, we find\nthat not only does decoherence merely degrade performance but it may also\nstabilize stored energy and ergotropy in the high noise strength regime. For\ninstance, the phase-flip channel slows charging and reduces charging power, but\nits discharging behavior releases energy and ergotropy more slowly, allowing\nthe battery to be used for longer times compared to bit-flip and bit-phase-flip\nchannels. In contrast, the bit-flip channel enables fast charging, but yields\nlow storage and rapid energy release. Remarkably, the bit-phase-flip channel\ncan combine the advantages of both bit-flip and phase-flip channels in the\nhigh-noise-strength regime. The bit-phase-flip channel supports accelerated\ncharging together with enhanced storage capacity, while its discharging\nbehavior resembles that of the bit-flip channel with rapid energy release.\nThese results reveal that, under sufficiently strong noise, environmental\ndecoherence induces a Zeno-like stabilization, allowing it to achieve enhanced\ncharging performance and to stabilize stored energy and ergotropy in the\nspin-chain quantum battery.",

In this study, we investigate the tipping point dynamics of avalanche\ncatastrophes in low-fluctuation domain, employing model system like the zero\ntemperature random field Ising model and thermally deposited cobalt films. As\nthe system approaches the tipping point, avalanche activity reveals pronounced\ncritical behaviour, including critical slowing down, variance enhancement, and\na growing spatial correlation length--hallmarks that may serve as early warning\nsignals of impending collapse. Crucially, we demonstrate that increasing\ndisorder in the system reduces its vulnerability to catastrophic failure. In\nhighly disorder regimes, these early warning signals emerge well before the\ntransition, thereby providing a large margin for anticipation and mitigation.\nThis key finding suggests a protective role of disorder offering a novel\nperspective on resilience in complex systems.

    "abstract": "Metamaterials can exhibit exotic nonreciprocal properties, yet corresponding\nfundamental limits and design blueprints achieving them are largely unexplored.\nHere, we derive comprehensive bounds on the effective nonreciprocal properties\nof three-dimensional metamaterials and identify microstructures achieving or\napproaching these bounds. We assume that the underlying equations are\nequivalent to the conductivity problem in a weak applied magnetic field. While\nwe focus on the Hall effect, our results are more generally applicable,\nparticularly to the Faraday effect in the quasistatic regime and in the absence\nof losses and resonances. Our bounds yield three important implications: First,\nthe effective Hall mobility of a metamaterial cannot be larger than the largest\nHall mobility among the constituent materials. Second, under additional\nconditions, the effective Verdet constant cannot be enhanced either. Third, for\ndiagonal Hall tensor components, the optimal values are achieved either by one\nof the pure phases or a rank-1 laminate formed from them, provided that the\nHall coefficients of all phases have the same sign. Our work elucidates the\nlimits of nonreciprocal metamaterials and identifies key prerequisites for\nobtaining exotic phenomena such as sign-inversions and enhancements. Several\nextensions appear within reach, for example to the Faraday effect in\nmetamaterials exhibiting plasmonic resonances.",

We consider this in the context of\nthe semi-strong Efficient Markets Hypothesis (EMH), which posits that prices\nfully reflect all public information and, accordingly, that clusters based on\nprice information cannot be improved upon. We benchmark three clustering\napproaches: (i) price-based clusters derived from historical return\ncorrelations, (ii) human-informed clusters defined by the Global Industry\nClassification Standard (GICS), and (iii) AI-driven clusters constructed from\nlarge language model (LLM) embeddings of stock-related news headlines. At each\ndate, each method provides a classification in which each stock is assigned to\na cluster. To evaluate a clustering, we transform it into a synthetic factor\nmodel following the Arbitrage Pricing Theory (APT) framework. This enables\nconsistent evaluation of predictive performance in a roll forward,\nout-of-sample test. Using S&P 500 constituents from from 2022 through 2024, we\nfind that price-based clustering consistently outperforms both rule-based and\nAI-based methods, reducing root mean squared error (RMSE) by 15.9% relative to\nGICS and 14.7% relative to LLM embeddings. Our contributions are threefold: (i)\na generalizable methodology that converts any equity grouping: manual, machine,\nor market-driven, into a real-time factor model for evaluation; (ii) the first\ndirect comparison of price-based, human rule-based, and AI-based clustering\nunder identical conditions; and (iii) empirical evidence reinforcing that\nshort-horizon return information is largely contained in prices. These results\nsupport the EMH while offering practitioners a practical diagnostic for\nmonitoring evolving sector structures and provide academics a framework for\ntesting alternative hypotheses about how quickly markets absorb information.",

In this study, we examine the melting of a\nvertical ice wall caused by surface waves using both theory and laboratory\nexperiments, with an emphasis on the flow-induced heat transport in the theory\nand measurements of the melt rate profile under different wave conditions in\nthe experiments. In both the theory and the experiments, we find that there is\nenhanced melting near the surface that decays with depth. Via an analysis the\noscillatory boundary layer flow, we find that an approximate, leading-order,\nwave-averaged balance of heat transport is given by the vertical advection due\nto an Eulerian boundary layer streaming current and horizontal diffusion. By\nsolving for this balance and obtaining the wave-averaged temperature field, we\nfind an explicit expression for the wave-induced melt rate. Experimental data\nshow a good match to this expression, especially for larger wave amplitudes and\ncolder water temperatures, though we find that the ambient melt can be a\nsignificant contributor to the waterline melt rate.",

Despite notable advancements, challenges\npersist in the task, particularly concerning unique characteristics of harmonic\ncontent, which have resulted in existing systems' performances reaching a glass\nceiling. These challenges include annotator subjectivity, where varying\ninterpretations among annotators lead to inconsistencies, and class imbalance\nwithin chord datasets, where certain chord classes are over-represented\ncompared to others, posing difficulties in model training and evaluation. As a\nfirst contribution, this paper presents an evaluation of inter-annotator\nagreement in chord annotations, using metrics that extend beyond traditional\nbinary measures. In addition, we propose a consonance-informed distance metric\nthat reflects the perceptual similarity between harmonic annotations. Our\nanalysis suggests that consonance-based distance metrics more effectively\ncapture musically meaningful agreement between annotations. Expanding on these\nfindings, we introduce a novel ACE conformer-based model that integrates\nconsonance concepts into the model through consonance-based label smoothing.\nThe proposed model also addresses class imbalance by separately estimating\nroot, bass, and all note activations, enabling the reconstruction of chord\nlabels from decomposed outputs.",

Since\nits inception in 2015, it has been divided into numerous subfields that deal\nwith application-specific issues, such as data heterogeneity or resource\nallocation. One such sub-field, Clustered Federated Learning (CFL), deals with\nthe problem of clustering the population of clients into separate cohorts to\ndeliver personalised models. Although a few remarkable works have been\npublished in this domain, the problem remains largely unexplored, as its basic\nassumptions and settings differ slightly from those of standard FL. In this\nwork, we present One-Shot Clustered Federated Learning (OCFL), a\nclustering-agnostic algorithm that can automatically detect the earliest\nsuitable moment for clustering. Our algorithm is based on computing the cosine\ndistance between the gradients of the clients and a temperature measure that\ndetects when the federated model starts to converge. We empirically evaluate\nour methodology by testing various one-shot clustering algorithms for over\nforty different tasks on five benchmark datasets. Our experiments showcase the\ngood performance of our approach when used to perform CFL in an automated\nmanner without the need to adjust hyperparameters. We also revisit the\npractical feasibility of CFL algorithms based on the gradients of the clients,\nproviding firm evidence of the high efficiency of density-based clustering\nmethods when used to differentiate between the loss surfaces of neural networks\ntrained on different distributions. Moreover, by inspecting the feasibility of\nlocal explanations generated with the help of GradCAM, we can provide more\ninsights into the relationship between personalisation and the explainability\nof local predictions.",

This problem suggests that general relativity and possibly also\nquantum mechanics need fundamental corrections. Most physicists expect that\ngravity should be quantum in character, but gravity is fundamentally different\nto the other forces because it alone is described by spacetime geometry.\nExperiments are needed to test whether gravity, and hence space-time, is\nquantum or classical. We propose an experiment to test the quantum nature of\ngravity by checking whether gravity can entangle two micron-sized crystals. A\npathway to this is to create macroscopic quantum superpositions of each crystal\nfirst using embedded spins and Stern-Gerlach forces. These crystals could be\nnanodiamonds containing nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centres. The spins can\nsubsequently be measured to witness the gravitationally generated entanglement.\nThis is based on extensive theoretical feasibility studies and experimental\nprogress in quantum technology. The eventual experiment will require a\nmedium-sized consortium with excellent suppression of decoherence including\nvibrations and gravitational noise. In this white paper, we review the progress\nand plans towards realizing this. While implementing these plans, we will\nfurther explore the most macroscopic superpositions that are possible, which\nwill test theories that predict a limit to this.",

Recent advances in engineered photonic environments now allow\nthe realization of discrete-site waveguides with tailored dispersion, yet most\nimplementations of waveguide QED remain limited to a local qubit-waveguide\ncoupling. Here, we study a transmon qubit non-locally coupled to a\nhigh-impedance coupled cavity array (CCA), thus implementing a \\emph{giant\natom} in a structured photonic environment. The non-local coupling produces\ninterference with the CCA eigenmodes, selectively enhancing interaction with\nlong-wavelength (low-effective $k$), symmetric modes about the array center,\nwhile suppressing coupling to antisymmetric and short-wavelength modes. For a\nsubset of symmetric, low-effective $k$ modes, we reach the superstrong coupling\nregime. In this regime, measurements of the atomic participation ratio reveal\nstrongly hybridized eigenmodes on a par with a strongly reduced qubit\nparticipation at the frequency of maximum hybridization with the qubit, in\nagreement with theory. Time-domain measurements of the qubit dynamics show\nclear deviations from the single-mode Jaynes--Cummings model, marked by the\nemergence of mode--mode interactions. By breaking inversion symmetry, the qubit\nseeds dressed eigenmodes confined to either the right or left of the qubit,\nwhich we exploit to implement and characterize a chiral photon-emission\nprotocol. These results demonstrate precise control over multimode\nlight--matter interaction in a structured photonic environment.",

This paper contributes to\naddressing the challenge of decision-making by proposing a structured\ndecision-making framework as a foundational step towards responsible AI. The\nproposed structured decision-making framework is implemented in autonomous\ndecision-making, specifically within disaster management.

The results demonstrate that the structured\ndecision-making framework achieves 60.94% greater stability in consistently\naccurate decisions across multiple Scenarios, compared to judgement-based\nsystems. Moreover, the study shows that the proposed framework outperforms\nhuman operators with a 38.93% higher accuracy across various Scenarios.

Our experiments demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of CSRM-LLM and the proposed techniques, resulting in\nsuccessful real-world deployment and significant online gains, with a 45.8%\nreduction in defect ratio and a 0.866% uplift in session purchase rate.",

This overconfidence, especially in models\nundergone Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), poses significant\nchallenges for reliable uncertainty estimation and safe deployment. In this\npaper, we propose EAGLE (Expectation of AGgregated internaL bEief), a novel\nself-evaluation-based calibration method that leverages the internal hidden\nstates of LLMs to derive more accurate confidence scores. Instead of relying on\nthe model's final output, our approach extracts internal beliefs from multiple\nintermediate layers during self-evaluation. By aggregating these layer-wise\nbeliefs and calculating the expectation over the resulting confidence score\ndistribution, EAGLE produces a refined confidence score that more faithfully\nreflects the model's internal certainty. Extensive experiments on diverse\ndatasets and LLMs demonstrate that EAGLE significantly improves calibration\nperformance over existing baselines. We also provide an in-depth analysis of\nEAGLE, including a layer-wise examination of uncertainty patterns, a study of\nthe impact of self-evaluation prompts, and an analysis of the effect of\nself-evaluation score range.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, the development of Large Language Models (LLMs) has\nsignificantly advanced, extending their capabilities to multimodal tasks\nthrough Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, video understanding\nremains a challenging area due to the dynamic and information-dense nature of\nvideos. Existing models struggle with the trade-off between spatial resolution\nand temporal coverage when processing video content. We present Keye-VL-1.5,\nwhich addresses fundamental challenges in video comprehension through three key\ninnovations. First, we introduce a novel Slow-Fast video encoding strategy that\ndynamically allocates computational resources based on inter-frame similarity,\nprocessing key frames with significant visual changes at higher resolution\n(Slow pathway) while handling relatively static frames with increased temporal\ncoverage at lower resolution (Fast pathway). Second, we implement a progressive\nfour-stage pre-training methodology that systematically extends the model's\ncontext length from 8K to 128K tokens, enabling processing of longer videos and\nmore complex visual content. Third, we develop a comprehensive post-training\npipeline focusing on reasoning enhancement and human preference alignment,\nincorporating a 5-step chain-of-thought data construction process, iterative\nGSPO-based reinforcement learning with progressive prompt hinting for difficult\ncases, and alignment training. Through extensive evaluation on public\nbenchmarks and rigorous internal human assessment, Keye-VL-1.5 demonstrates\nsignificant improvements over existing models, particularly excelling in video\nunderstanding tasks while maintaining competitive performance on general\nmultimodal benchmarks.",

Due to the complicated\nand heterogeneous context, as well as possible artifacts, there are often false\npositives and false negatives, thus degrading the detection F1-score. To\naddress this problem, we propose a two-stage framework. Firstly, an improved\nYOLO11x, integrated with EMA attention and LSConv, is employed to generate\nmitosis candidates. We use a low confidence threshold to generate as many\nproposals as possible, ensuring the detection recall.

Consequently, the proposed two-stage framework can\ngenerate a high detection F1-score. Evaluated on a fused dataset comprising\nMIDOG++, MITOS_WSI_CCMCT, and MITOS_WSI_CMC, our framework achieves an F1-score\nof 0.882, which is 0.035 higher than the single-stage YOLO11x baseline.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we revisit parameter estimation for multinomial logit (MNL),\nnested logit (NL), and tree-nested logit (TNL) models through the framework of\nconvex conic optimization. Traditional approaches typically solve the maximum\nlikelihood estimation (MLE) problem using gradient-based methods, which are\nsensitive to step-size selection and initialization, and may therefore suffer\nfrom slow or unstable convergence. In contrast, we propose a novel estimation\nstrategy that reformulates these models as conic optimization problems,\nenabling more robust and reliable estimation procedures. Specifically, we show\nthat the MLE for MNL admits an equivalent exponential cone program (ECP). For\nNL and TNL, we prove that when the dissimilarity (scale) parameters are fixed,\nthe estimation problem is convex and likewise reducible to an ECP. Leveraging\nthese results, we design a two-stage procedure: an outer loop that updates the\nscale parameters and an inner loop that solves the ECP to update the utility\ncoefficients. The inner problems are handled by interior-point methods with\niteration counts that grow only logarithmically in the target accuracy, as\nimplemented in off-the-shelf solvers (e.g., MOSEK). Extensive experiments\nacross estimation instances of varying size show that our conic approach\nattains better MLE solutions, greater robustness to initialization, and\nsubstantial speedups compared to standard gradient-based MLE, particularly on\nlarge-scale instances with high-dimensional specifications and large choice\nsets. Our findings establish exponential cone programming as a practical and\nscalable alternative for estimating a broad class of discrete choice models.",

In order to theoretically investigate magnetic sublevel\npopulations and their dependence on the relative orientation and phase -- i.e.\nthe polarization state -- of the isolated magnetic field, we use a\ntime-dependent density-matrix method based on the Liouville-von Neumann\nequation.

To\naddress these challenges, we developed HIFU-ILDiff, a novel deep learning-based\napproach leveraging latent diffusion models to suppress HIFU-induced\ninterference in ultrasound images. The HIFU-ILDiff model employs a Vector\nQuantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) to encode noisy ultrasound images\ninto a lower-dimensional latent space, followed by a latent diffusion model\nthat iteratively removes interference. The denoised latent vectors are then\ndecoded to reconstruct high-resolution, interference-free ultrasound images. We\nconstructed a comprehensive dataset comprising 18,872 image pairs from in vitro\nphantoms, ex vivo tissues, and in vivo animal data across multiple imaging\nmodalities and HIFU power levels to train and evaluate the model. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that HIFU-ILDiff significantly outperforms the commonly\nused Notch Filter method, achieving a Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) of\n0.796 and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) of 23.780 compared to SSIM of 0.443\nand PSNR of 14.420 for the Notch Filter under in vitro scenarios.

These include five linear IDE\nmodels, namely $Q=3H(\\delta_{\\rm dm} \\rho_{\\rm dm} + \\delta_{\\rm de} \\rho_{\\rm\nde})$ and four special cases: $Q=3H\\delta(\\rho_{\\rm dm}+\\rho_{\\rm de})$,\n$Q=3H\\delta(\\rho_{\\rm dm}-\\rho_{\\rm de})$, $Q=3H\\delta \\rho_{\\rm dm}$, and\n$Q=3H\\delta \\rho_{\\rm de}$, together with three non-linear IDE models:\n$Q=3H\\delta \\left( \\tfrac{\\rho_{\\rm dm} \\rho_{\\rm de}}{\\rho_{\\rm dm}+\\rho_{\\rm\nde}} \\right)$, $Q=3H\\delta \\left( \\tfrac{\\rho_{\\rm dm}^2}{\\rho_{\\rm\ndm}+\\rho_{\\rm de}} \\right)$, and $Q=3H\\delta \\left( \\tfrac{\\rho_{\\rm\nde}^2}{\\rho_{\\rm dm}+\\rho_{\\rm de}} \\right)$. For these eight models, we\npresent conditions to avoid imaginary, undefined, and negative energy\ndensities. In seven of the eight cases, negative densities arise if energy\nflows from DM to DE, implying a strong theoretical preference for energy\ntransfer from DE to DM. We also provide conditions to avoid future big rip\nsingularities and evaluate how each model addresses the coincidence problem in\nboth the past and the future. Finally, we propose a set of approaches and\nsimplifying assumptions that can be used when constraining IDE models, by\ndefining regimes that restrict the parameter space according to the behavior\nresearchers are willing to tolerate.",

Silicon photonics, with its CMOS compatibility and\nwafer-scale manufacturability, has emerged as a promising platform for optical\ninterconnect architectures. Silicon microring modulators (MRMs), with their\ncompact footprint, low power consumption, and high modulation efficiency, have\nbecome ideal devices for modulation in interconnects. However, silicon MRMS\nhave so far been constrained by the trade-off between modulation efficiency and\nbandwidth, hindering their potential for 400 Gbps-per-wavelength operation. To\nmitigate this trade-off, here we demonstrate a wafer-level fabricated and\nhigh-bandwidth silicon MRM with a novel heavily-doped trench-integrated\nstructure on a 300-mm silicon photonic platform, achieving both outstanding\ndevice performance and remarkable wafer-scale uniformity. Exploiting dual\noperation modes: self-biasing for energy-efficient scale-up interconnects and\ndepletion driving for ultrafast scale-out links, the device supports error-free\n32-Gbps NRZ transmission over 2-km SSMF with only 0.43-Vpp drive and zero\nelectrical bias, yielding energy efficiency of 0.97 fJ/bit without DSP. At\nhigher swings, it further supports 280-Gbps PAM4 and error-free 80-Gbps NRZ\noptical modulation. For scale-out interconnects, open eye diagrams are achieved\nat 200 Gbps (NRZ), 360 Gbps (PAM4), and a record 400 Gbps (PAM6), establishing\nthe first wafer-scale silicon MRM solution reaching 400 Gbps/$\\lambda$.

Conversely, on-device\nagents ensure privacy and responsiveness but lack the computational power for\nglobal modeling and large-scale retrieval. To bridge these complementary\nlimitations, we propose CDA4Rec, a novel Cloud-Device collaborative framework\nfor sequential Recommendation, powered by dual agents: a cloud-side LLM and a\ndevice-side small language model (SLM). CDA4Rec tackles the core challenge of\ncloud-device coordination by decomposing the recommendation task into modular\nsub-tasks including semantic modeling, candidate retrieval, structured user\nmodeling, and final ranking, which are allocated to cloud or device based on\ncomputational demands and privacy sensitivity. A strategy planning mechanism\nleverages the cloud agent's reasoning ability to generate personalized\nexecution plans, enabling context-aware task assignment and partial parallel\nexecution across agents. This design ensures real-time responsiveness, improved\nefficiency, and fine-grained personalization, even under diverse user states\nand behavioral sparsity.

Despite its wide utility, RMSD calculation is\noften challenged by inconsistent atom ordering, indistinguishable\nconfigurations in molecular clusters, and potential chirality inversion during\nalignment. These issues highlight the necessity of accurate atom-to-atom\ncorrespondence as a prerequisite for meaningful alignment. Traditional\napproaches often rely on heuristic cost matrices combined with the Hungarian\nalgorithm, yet these methods underutilize the rich intra-molecular structural\ninformation and may fail to generalize across chemically diverse systems. In\nthis work, we introduce OTMol, a method that formulates the molecular alignment\ntask as a fused supervised Gromov-Wasserstein (fsGW) optimal transport problem.\nBy leveraging the intrinsic geometric and topological relationships within each\nmolecule, OTMol eliminates the need for manually defined cost functions and\nenables a principled, data-driven matching strategy. Importantly, OTMol\npreserves key chemical features such as molecular chirality and bond\nconnectivity consistency. We evaluate OTMol across a wide range of molecular\nsystems, including Adenosine triphosphate, Imatinib, lipids, small peptides,\nand water clusters, and demonstrate that it consistently achieves low RMSD\nvalues while preserving computational efficiency. Importantly, OTMol maintains\nmolecular integrity by enforcing one-to-one mappings between entire molecules,\nthereby avoiding erroneous many-to-one alignments that often arise in comparing\nmolecular clusters.

Unauthorized merging may\ninfringe on developers' rights and risk leaking sensitive personal information.\nMost existing methods focus on detecting whether a merged model originates from\na specific source model, but fail to effectively prevent illegal merging.

Specifically, leveraging the inherent symmetry of\nthe attention mechanism in Transformer-based models, we randomly sample two\npairs of invertible matrices and apply them to the Query-Key (QK) and\nValue-Output (VO) branches. This transformation keeps the model's output\nunchanged while pushing it away from the shared parameter space of other\nfinetuned models. Extensive experiments across both vision and language tasks\ndemonstrate that MergeLock can degrade the performance of merged models by over\n95% when a protected model is involved in most cases, demonstrating its\neffectiveness.

Additionally, we\nmaintain a globally consistent opacity radiance field based on 3D Gaussians and\nintroduce depth distortion and normal consistency terms to refine the scene\nrepresentation. Furthermore, after constructing tetrahedral grids, we identify\nlevel sets to directly extract surfaces from 3D Gaussians. Results across\nvarious real-world and large-scale synthetic datasets demonstrate that our\nmethod achieves state-of-the-art tracking accuracy and mapping performance.",

    "abstract": "The emission-line binary ALS 8814 was recently proposed as a Be star + black\nhole (BH) binary based on large-amplitude radial velocity (RV) variations of a\nBe star and non-detection of spectroscopic features from a luminous companion.\nWe reanalyze low- and medium-resolution LAMOST spectra of ALS 8814 and show\nthat the system's spectroscopic variability is considerably more complex than\npreviously recognized. Inspection of the system's trailed spectra reveals the\npresence of a second set of absorption lines that move in anti-phase with the\nBe star. In addition, the emission and absorption lines exhibit inconsistent RV\nvariability, suggesting that they trace different stars. Using spectral\ndisentangling, we recover the spectrum of a rapidly rotating companion whose\nbroad, shallow lines were previously undetected. Time-variability in the\nemission lines complicates interpretation of the disentangled spectrum, such\nthat the physical parameters of the components are still uncertain, but we find\nwith simulations that emission line variability alone is unlikely to explain\nall signatures of the companion. The system's high Gaia RUWE value suggests a\nthird luminous companion, making ALS 8814 a likely hierarchical triple.\nAlthough it is unlikely to contain a BH, the system is unusual, with the\nlargest RV semi-amplitude observed in any known classical Be star and a\ncompanion that does not appear to be stripped. More extensive spectroscopic\nmonitoring and high-resolution imaging will be necessary to fully characterize\nthe system's orbital architecture, stellar parameters, and evolutionary status.",

The\nframework integrates the Phase Function Method (PFM) with a two-stage\nsupervised multi-layer perceptron (MLP) model to extract the optimal parameters\nof the Malfliet-Tjon (MT) potential from sparse phase-shift data. A synthetic\ndataset of phase shifts is generated by solving the phase equation for angular\nmomentum $\\ell$ = 0, using the fifth-order Runge-Kutta method, ensuring\nphysically consistent training data. The first neural network predicts the\nattractive potential strength, $\\tilde{V}_A$, while the second estimates the\nrepulsive strength, $\\tilde{V}_R$. The optimal range parameter, $\\mu$, is\nobtained through error minimization between predicted and expected phase\nshifts, thereby enhancing both stability and accuracy compared to conventional\ninversion techniques. The PGNN framework is validated for the $^1S_0$ state of\nneutron-proton (n-p), proton-proton (p-p), and neutron-neutron (n-n) scattering\nat low energies. The constructed inverse potentials accurately reproduce the\nphase shifts reported in the literature and exhibit the expected features of\nnucleon-nucleon interactions, including a short-range repulsive core and an\nintermediate-range attractive well, with the n-p system showing the deepest\npotential minimum due to stronger binding.

While existing approaches typically freeze the\nbackbone and fine-tune a small number of parameters to mitigate forgetting,\nthey still rely on iterative error backpropagation and gradient-based\noptimization, which can be computationally intensive and less suitable for\nresource-constrained environments. To address this, we propose FoRo, a\nforward-only, gradient-free continual learning method. FoRo consists of a\nlightweight prompt tuning strategy and a novel knowledge encoding mechanism,\nboth designed without modifying the pre-trained model. Specifically, prompt\nembeddings are inserted at the input layer and optimized using the Covariance\nMatrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES), which mitigates distribution\nshifts and extracts high-quality task representations. Subsequently,\ntask-specific knowledge is encoded into a knowledge encoding matrix via\nnonlinear random projection and recursive least squares, enabling incremental\nupdates to the classifier without revisiting prior data. Experiments show that\nFoRo significantly reduces average forgetting and improves accuracy. Thanks to\nforward-only learning, FoRo reduces memory usage and run time while maintaining\nhigh knowledge retention across long task sequences. These results suggest that\nFoRo could serve as a promising direction for exploring continual learning with\npre-trained models, especially in real-world multimedia applications where both\nefficiency and effectiveness are critical.",

    "abstract": "Organisations can use artificial intelligence to make decisions about people\nfor a variety of reasons, for instance, to select the best candidates from many\njob applications. However, AI systems can have discriminatory effects when used\nfor decision-making. To illustrate, an AI system could reject applications of\npeople with a certain ethnicity, while the organisation did not plan such\nethnicity discrimination. But in Europe, an organisation runs into a problem\nwhen it wants to assess whether its AI system accidentally discriminates based\non ethnicity: the organisation may not know the applicants' ethnicity. In\nprinciple, the GDPR bans the use of certain 'special categories of data'\n(sometimes called 'sensitive data'), which include data on ethnicity, religion,\nand sexual preference. The proposal for an AI Act of the European Commission\nincludes a provision that would enable organisations to use special categories\nof data for auditing their AI systems. This paper asks whether the GDPR's rules\non special categories of personal data hinder the prevention of AI-driven\ndiscrimination.

    "abstract": "This study examines how inflationary dynamics are affected by $f(R)$ theories\nwith a non-minimal coupling between matter and curvature. Both positive and\nnegative corrections to the minimal coupling of General Relativity are\nconsidered, and a robust numerical method is developed that evolves the metric\nand the inflaton field in this modified theory beyond slow-roll. Through a\nstability analysis, we find that positive models are inherently unstable during\nslow-roll, whereas negative ones can accommodate a stable attractor de Sitter\nsolution. Using the amplitude of the scalar power spectrum from the latest data\nreleases, we constrain the scale of the non-minimal coupling to be above\n$10^{13}$ GeV. In light of the 2018 Planck, BICEP/Keck and the recent Atacama\nCosmology Telescope data for the scalar spectral index and tensor-to-scalar\nratio, strong constraints on the coupling strength force the effects of these\nmodified theories to be, at most, slightly above the perturbative level.\nFurthermore, we determine that the choice of the perfect fluid matter\nLagrangian does not impact the inflationary observables at the pivot scale.\nFinally, we present the predicted observables for different inflationary\npotentials and show that even though classical gravity is still preferred by\nthe data, there are areas of the parameter space that are viable for\nnon-minimally coupled inflationary models.",

One such example is the Blume-Capel model, a\nthree-state spin model, whose phase diagram features a tricritical point where\nsecond-order and first-order transition lines converge, leading to a\ncoexistence of paramagnetic, ferromagnetic, and disordered phases. Here, we\nrealize an artificial crystal of single-domain nanomagnets, placed on the links\nof the Ruby lattice, enabling real-space observation of the Blume-Capel degrees\nof freedom. These Blume-Capel degrees of freedom are represented by the\npresence, sign and interactions of the toroidal moments that emerge naturally\nin plaquettes of nanomagnets in the Ruby artificial spin ice. By precisely\ntuning the lattice parameters of the Ruby artificial spin ice, we demonstrate\ncontrol over the two-step ordering process of the toroidal moments, whereby\nthere is a high-temperature crossover from a paramagnetic phase to an\nintermediate paratoroidic regime, followed by a second-order phase transition\nto a ferrotoroidic ground state. This sequence of toroidal phases and\ntransitions is accurately captured by the Blume-Capel framework and provides a\ndirect realization of a substantial portion of the phase diagram associated\nwith the model. This establishes a new platform for exploring exotic\nHamiltonians in terms of artificial spin ice superstructures, here with groups\nof nanomagnets forming toroidal moments.

    "abstract": "With the rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Artificial\nIntelligence (AI) agents, agentic workflows are showing transformative\npotential in education. This study introduces the Agentic Workflow for\nEducation (AWE), a four-component model comprising self-reflection, tool\ninvocation, task planning, and multi-agent collaboration. We distinguish AWE\nfrom traditional LLM-based linear interactions and propose a theoretical\nframework grounded in the von Neumann Multi-Agent System (MAS) architecture.\nThrough a paradigm shift from static prompt-response systems to dynamic,\nnonlinear workflows, AWE enables scalable, personalized, and collaborative task\nexecution. We further identify four core application domains: integrated\nlearning environments, personalized AI-assisted learning, simulation-based\nexperimentation, and data-driven decision-making. A case study on automated\nmath test generation shows that AWE-generated items are statistically\ncomparable to real exam questions, validating the model's effectiveness. AWE\noffers a promising path toward reducing teacher workload, enhancing\ninstructional quality, and enabling broader educational innovation.",

    "abstract": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems typically face constraints\nbecause of their inherent mechanism: a simple top-k semantic search [1]. The\napproach often leads to the incorporation of irrelevant or redundant\ninformation in the context, degrading performance and efficiency [10][11]. This\npaper presents MeVe, a novel modular architecture intended for Memory\nVerification and smart context composition. MeVe rethinks the RAG paradigm by\nproposing a five-phase modular design that distinctly breaks down the retrieval\nand context composition process into distinct, auditable, and independently\ntunable phases: initial retrieval, relevance verification, fallback retrieval,\ncontext prioritization, and token budgeting. This architecture enables\nfine-grained control of what knowledge is made available to an LLM, enabling\ntask-dependent filtering and adaptation. We release a reference implementation\nof MeVe as a proof of concept and evaluate its performance on knowledge-heavy\nQA tasks over a subset of English Wikipedia [22]. Our results demonstrate that\nby actively verifying information before composition, MeVe significantly\nimproves context efficiency, achieving a 57% reduction on the Wikipedia dataset\nand a 75% reduction on the more complex HotpotQA dataset compared to standard\nRAG implementations [25]. This work provides a framework for more scalable and\nreliable LLM applications.

    "abstract": "In clinical practice, automatic analysis of electrocardiogram (ECG) is widely\napplied to identify irregular heart rhythms and other electrical anomalies of\nthe heart, enabling timely intervention and potentially improving clinical\noutcomes. However, due to the limited samples in certain types of ECG signals,\nthe class imbalance issues pose a challenge for ECG-based detection. In\naddition, as the volume of patient data grows, long-term storage of all\nhistorical data becomes increasingly burdensome as training samples to\nrecognize new patterns and classify existing ECG signals accurately. Therefore,\nto enhance the performance of anomaly detection while addressing storage\nlimitations, we propose a pseudo-replay based semi-supervised continual\nlearning framework, which consists of two components: unsupervised\nidentification and replay-based detection. For unsupervised identification, an\nunsupervised generative adversarial network (GAN)-based framework is integrated\nto detect novel patterns. Besides, instead of directly storing all historical\ndata, a pseudo replay-based learning strategy is proposed which utilizes a\ngenerator to learn the data distribution for each individual task. When a new\ntask arises, the generator synthesizes pseudo data representative of previous\nlearnt classes, enabling the model to detect both the existed patterns and the\nnewly presented anomalies. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is\nvalidated in four public ECG datasets, which leverages supervised\nclassification problems for anomaly detection. The experimental results show\nthat the developed approach is very promising in identifying novel anomalies\nwhile maintaining good performance on detecting existing ECG signals.",

    "abstract": "Time-varying electricity pricing better reflects the varying cost of\nelectricity compared to flat-rate pricing. Variations between peak and off-peak\ncosts are increasing due to weather variation, renewable intermittency, and\nincreasing electrification of demand. Empirical and theoretical studies suggest\nthat variable pricing can lower electricity supply costs and reduce grid\nstress. However, the distributional impacts, particularly on low-income\nconsumers, remain understudied. This paper develops a theoretical framework to\nanalyze how consume heterogeneity affects welfare outcomes when electricity\nmarkets transition from flat-rate to time-varying pricing, considering\nrealistic assumptions about heterogeneous consumer demand, supply costs, and\nutility losses from unmet consumption.\n  We derive sufficient conditions for identifying when consumers lose utility\nfrom pricing reforms and compare welfare effects across consumer types. Our\nfindings reveal that consumer vulnerability depends on the interaction of\nconsumption timing, demand flexibility capabilities, and price sensitivity\nlevels. Consumers with high peak-period consumption and inflexible demand,\ncharacteristics often associated with low-income households, are most\nvulnerable to welfare losses. Critically, we demonstrate that demand\nflexibility provides welfare protection only when coincident with large price\nchanges. Our equilibrium analysis reveals that aggregate flexibility patterns\ngenerate spillover effects through pricing mechanisms, with peak periods\nexperiencing greater price changes when they have less aggregate flexibility,\npotentially concentrating larger price increases among vulnerable populations\nthat have a limited ability to respond. These findings suggest that variable\npricing policies should be accompanied by targeted policies ensuring equitable\naccess to demand response capabilities and pricing benefits.",

In this work, we develop the\nfirst quantum formulation for a portfolio optimization problem with\nhigher-order moments, skewness and kurtosis. Including higher-order moments\nleads to more detailed modeling of portfolio return distributions. Portfolio\noptimization with higher-order moments has been studied in classical portfolio\noptimization approaches but with limited exploration within quantum\nformulations. In the context of quantum optimization, higher-order moments\ngenerate higher-order terms in the cost Hamiltonian. Thus, instead of obtaining\na quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problem, we obtain a higher-order\nunconstrained binary optimization (HUBO) problem, which has a natural\nformulation as a parametrized circuit. Additionally, we employ realistic\ninteger variable encoding and a capital-based budget constraint. We consider\nthe classical continuous variable solution with integer programming-based\ndiscretization to be the computationally efficient classical baseline for the\nproblem. Our extensive experimental evaluation of 100 portfolio optimization\nproblems shows that the solutions to the HUBO formulation often correspond to\nbetter portfolio allocations than the classical baseline. This is a promising\nresult for those who want to perform computationally challenging portfolio\noptimization on quantum hardware, as portfolio optimization with higher moments\nis classically complex.

Aims. Our goals are to estimate the fundamental\nparameters of both binary systems and their components. Methods. We performed\nfirst phase-resolved multi-band photometry of both objects with the 10.4-m Gran\nTelescopio Canarias and fitted the obtained light curves with a model assuming\ndirect heating of the companion by the pulsar. Archival X-ray data obtained\nwith the Swift and XMM-Newton observatories were also analysed. Results. For\nthe first time, we firmly identified both systems in the optical. Their optical\nlight curves show a rather symmetric single peak per orbital period and a\npeak-to-peak amplitude of $\\gtrsim$2 mag. We also identified the X-ray\ncounterpart to J1627$+$3219, while for J0312$-$0921 we set an upper limit on\nthe X-ray flux. Conclusions. We estimated the masses of the pulsars, companion\ntemperatures and masses, Roche lobe filling factors, orbital inclinations, and\nthe distances to both systems. PSR J0312$-$0921 has a very light ($\\approx$0.02\nM$_\\odot$) companion which possibly has one of the lowest ($\\approx$1600 K)\n`night-side' temperatures among the known black widow systems. We found that\nthe distances to J0312$-$0921 and J1627$+$3219 are about 2.5 and 4.6 kpc,\nrespectively. This likely explains their faintness in X-rays. The X-ray\nspectrum of PSR J1627$+$3219 can be described by the power-law model, and its\nparameters are compatible with those obtained for other black widows.",

    "abstract": "3D object detection from point clouds plays a critical role in autonomous\ndriving. Currently, the primary methods for point cloud processing are\nvoxel-based and pillarbased approaches. Voxel-based methods offer high accuracy\nthrough fine-grained spatial segmentation but suffer from slower inference\nspeeds. Pillar-based methods enhance inference speed but still fall short of\nvoxel-based methods in accuracy. To address these issues, we propose a novel\npoint cloud processing method, PointSlice, which slices point clouds along the\nhorizontal plane and includes a dedicated detection network. The main\ncontributions of PointSlice are: (1) A new point cloud processing technique\nthat converts 3D point clouds into multiple sets of 2D (x-y) data slices. The\nmodel only learns 2D data distributions, treating the 3D point cloud as\nseparate batches of 2D data, which reduces the number of model parameters and\nenhances inference speed; (2) The introduction of a Slice Interaction Network\n(SIN). To maintain vertical relationships across slices, we incorporate SIN\ninto the 2D backbone network, which improves the model's 3D object perception\ncapability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PointSlice achieves high\ndetection accuracy and inference speed. On the Waymo dataset, PointSlice is\n1.13x faster and has 0.79x fewer parameters than the state-of-the-art\nvoxel-based method (SAFDNet), with only a 1.2 mAPH accuracy reduction. On the\nnuScenes dataset, we achieve a state-of-the-art detection result of 66.74 mAP.\nOn the Argoverse 2 dataset, PointSlice is 1.10x faster, with 0.66x fewer\nparameters and a 1.0 mAP accuracy reduction. The code will be available at\nhttps://github.com/qifeng22/PointSlice2.",

We identified 2257 dense cores using the getsources algorithm, of which\n59% are starless, and 41% are potentially protostellar. 71% of the starless\ncores are prestellar core candidates, suggesting a prestellar core lifetime\nsimilar to that of Class 0/I YSOs. Higher-mass clouds have a higher fraction of\nprestellar cores compared to protostars, suggesting a longer average prestellar\ncore lifetime. We assessed completeness by inserting critically-stable\nBonnor--Ebert spheres into a blank SCUBA-2 field: completeness scales as\ndistance squared, with an average mass recovery fraction of $73\\pm6$% for\nrecovered sources. We calculated core masses and radii, and assessed their\ngravitational stability using the Bonnor-Ebert criterion. Maximum starless core\nmass scales with cloud complex mass with an index $0.58\\pm 0.13$, consistent\nwith the behaviour of maximum stellar masses in embedded clusters. We performed\nleast-squares and Monte Carlo modelling of the core mass functions (CMFs) of\nour starless and prestellar core samples. The CMFs can be characterised using\nlog-normal distributions: we do not sample the full range of core masses needed\nto create the stellar Initial Mass Function (IMF). The CMFs of the clouds are\nnot consistent with being drawn from a single underlying distribution. The peak\nmass of the starless core CMF increases with cloud mass; the prestellar CMF of\nthe more distant clouds has a peak mass $\\sim 3\\times$ the log-normal peak for\nthe system IMF, implying a $\\sim 33$% prestellar core-to-star efficiency.",

Established approaches,\nincluding rapidly rotating gases and tight-binding lattices, are often hampered\nby low interaction energies and small many-body energy gaps. While optical flux\nlattices (OFLs) can achieve higher effective magnetic flux densities, standard\ntwo-state configurations generate highly non-uniform fields, and extensions to\nmulti-state systems introduce significant experimental complexity. Here, we\npresent a new paradigm for engineering robust FQH phases in OFLs using only two\ninternal atomic states.

We provide a variety of\nexamples of how to design optical flux lattices, including dark-state OFLs, to\nachieve these goals.

However, such data is rarely available in existing\nmotion-text datasets, which additionally do not include low-level motion\ndescriptions. To address this, we propose a two-step hierarchical approach.\nFirst, we employ large language models to create detailed descriptions\ncorresponding to each high-level caption that appears in the motion-text\ndatasets (e.g., ``jumping while synchronizing arm extensions with the opening\nand closing of legs\" for ``jumping jacks\"). These refined annotations are used\nto retrain motion-to-text models to produce captions with low-level details.\nSecond, we introduce a pioneering retrieval-based mechanism. It aligns the\ndetailed low-level captions with candidate high-level captions from additional\ntext data sources, and combine them with motion features to fabricate precise\nhigh-level captions. Our methodology is distinctive in its ability to harness\nknowledge from external text sources to greatly increase motion captioning\naccuracy, especially for movements not covered in existing motion-text\ndatasets. Experiments on three distinct motion-text datasets (HumanML3D, KIT,\nand BOTH57M) demonstrate that our method achieves an improvement in average\nperformance (across BLEU-1, BLEU-4, CIDEr, and ROUGE-L) ranging from 6% to 50%\ncompared to the state-of-the-art M2T-Interpretable.",

However, the real-world deployment of wellbeing robots\nraises numerous ethical and socio-technical questions and concerns. To explore\nthese questions, we undertake a community-centered investigation to examine\nthree different communities' perspectives on using robotic wellbeing coaches in\nreal-world environments. We frame our work as an anticipatory ethical\ninvestigation, which we undertake to better inform the development of robotic\ntechnologies with communities' opinions, with the ultimate goal of aligning\nrobot development with public interest. We conducted workshops with three\ncommunities who are under-represented in robotics development: 1) members of\nthe public at a science festival, 2) women computer scientists at a conference,\nand 3) humanities researchers interested in history and philosophy of science.\nIn the workshops, we collected qualitative data using the Social Robot\nCo-Design Canvas on Ethics. We analysed the collected qualitative data with\nThematic Analysis, informed by notes taken during workshops. Through our\nanalysis, we identify four themes regarding key ethical and socio-technical\nquestions about the real-world use of wellbeing robots. We group participants'\ninsights and discussions around these broad thematic questions, discuss them in\nlight of state-of-the-art literature, and highlight areas for future\ninvestigation. Finally, we provide the four questions as a broad framework that\nroboticists can and should use during robotic development and deployment, in\norder to reflect on the ethics and socio-technical dimensions of their robotic\napplications, and to engage in dialogue with communities of robot users. The\nfour questions are: 1) Is the robot safe and how can we know that?, 2) Who is\nthe robot built for and with?, 3) Who owns the robot and the data?, and 4) Why\na robot?.",

Classical reconstruction methods like multi-view stereo\nonly reconstruct the visible hair strands, missing the inner structure of\nhairstyles and hampering realistic hair simulation. To address this, existing\nmethods leverage hairstyle priors trained on synthetic data. Such data,\nhowever, is limited in both quantity and quality since it requires manual work\nfrom skilled artists to model the 3D hairstyles and create near-photorealistic\nrenderings. To address this, we propose a novel approach that uses both, real\nand synthetic data to learn an effective hairstyle prior. Specifically, we\ntrain a transformer-based prior model on synthetic data to obtain knowledge of\nthe internal hairstyle geometry and introduce real data in the learning process\nto model the outer structure. This training scheme is able to model the visible\nhair strands depicted in an input image, while preserving the general 3D\nstructure of hairstyles. We exploit this prior to create a\nGaussian-splatting-based reconstruction method that creates hairstyles from one\nor more images.

Our approach derives uncertainty\nindicators directly from these readily available log-probabilities generated\nduring non-greedy decoding.

Our learned model uses features representing the entropic\ncontributions of the accessible top-ranked tokens within a single generated\nsequence, requiring no multiple query re-runs. Evaluated across diverse QA\ndatasets and multiple LLMs, this estimator significantly improves hallucination\ndetection over using EPR alone.

Adoption spreads through social contagion and perceived benefits,\nwhile opinions evolve via social interactions and feedback from adoption\nlevels. Individuals may abandon adoption due to dissatisfaction or external\nconstraints, potentially hindering diffusion. We analyze system equilibria and\ntheir stability, identifying conditions under which adoption persists. We\nintroduce a Model Predictive Control (MPC) strategy that dynamically adapts\ninterventions to the predicted system evolution. Three types of control are\ncompared: shaping opinions, acting on the adoption rate, and reducing\ndissatisfaction. Overall, MPC interventions outperform static constant control,\nachieving higher adoption at comparable or lower cost.

    "abstract": "In high harmonic generation (HHG), non-dipole effects become increasingly\nsignificant at long driving wavelengths, as the magnetic field leads to a\nlateral drift of the continuum electron, which disrupts the electron\nrecollision and inhibits the harmonic emission. To address this problem, we\nrevisit the dynamics of the continuum electrons under electromagnetic fields in\nthe HHG process and show that the magnetic effect on the drift includes a\nfundamental-frequency and a double-frequency component. By adding an additional\nfield to counteract the double-frequency effect caused by the magnetic field,\nwe construct an effective linearly polarized field that recovers the\nrecollision of all returning electrons to the parent ion. Consequently, the\nharmonic yield is restored and becomes the same as the result within the dipole\napproximation across the broad spectral range. This work provides a scheme that\ncompletely suppresses the non-dipole drift effect and fully compensates for the\nharmonic yield reduction, paving the way to efficiently generate coherent\nradiation in the range from extreme ultraviolet to soft x-ray and ultrashort\npulses based on HHG.",

Instanton theory is a rigorous semiclassical method\nthat extends transition-state theory by including quantum tunneling along a\nwell-defined optimal tunneling pathway. However, the standard leading-order\ninstanton theory (RPI) neglects anharmonicity perpendicular to this tunneling\npath. The RPI+PC method described here corrects this using only local\ninformation along the same instanton trajectory as the leading-order theory.\nHence, RPI+PC does not require a global potential energy surface and is readily\napplicable in combination with ab initio electronic-structure methods. The\nderivation of the RPI+PC result is performed within the flux-correlation\nformalism using standard techniques from asymptotic analysis, and the final\nrate expression is shown to be independent of the choice of dividing surface.\nWe demonstrate that RPI+PC represents a systematic improvement over RPI by\nanalyzing its asymptotic properties in the semiclassical limit ($\\hbar\\to0$\nwith total thermal time $\\tau^{\\mathrm{tot}}=\\beta\\hbar$ kept constant) and\nillustrate its improved performance on a series of model systems for which\nexact results are available for comparison, including the collinear H+H$_2$\nreaction and its isotopic variants.",

However, both LLMs and LRMs face the\npotential safety risks under jailbreak attacks, which raise concerns about\ntheir safety capabilities. Current safety evaluation methods often focus on the\ncontent dimensions, or simply aggregate different attack methods, lacking\nconsideration of the complexity. In fact, instructions of different complexity\ncan reflect the different safety capabilities of the model: simple instructions\ncan reflect the basic values of the model, while complex instructions can\nreflect the model's ability to deal with deeper safety risks. Therefore, a\ncomprehensive benchmark needs to be established to evaluate the safety\nperformance of the model in the face of instructions of varying complexity,\nwhich can provide a better understanding of the safety boundaries of the LLMs.\nThus, this paper first quantifies \"Reasoning Complexity\" as an evaluable safety\ndimension and categorizes 15 jailbreak attack methods into three different\nlevels according to the reasoning complexity, establishing a hierarchical\nChinese-English jailbreak safety benchmark for systematically evaluating the\nsafety performance of LLMs. Meanwhile, to fully utilize unique language\ncharacteristics, we first propose some Chinese jailbreak attack methods,\nincluding the Chinese Character Disassembly attack, Lantern Riddle attack, and\nAcrostic Poem attack.

Unlike earlier\nconstructions, our Steiner spanners are based on simple quadtrees, and they can\nbe dynamically maintained, leading to efficient data structures for dynamic\napproximate nearest neighbours and bichromatic closest pair.\n  In the hyperbolic setting, we also show that $2$-spanners in the hyperbolic\nplane must have $\\Omega(n\\log n)$ edges, and we obtain a $2$-spanner of size\n$O_d(n\\log n)$ in $d$-dimensional hyperbolic space, matching our lower bound\nfor any constant $d$. Finally, we give a Steiner spanner with additive error\n$\\varepsilon$ in hyperbolic space with\n$O_d(\\varepsilon^{(1-d)/2}\\log(\\alpha(n)/\\varepsilon)n)$ edges, where\n$\\alpha(n)$ is the inverse Ackermann function.\n  Our techniques generalize to closed orientable surfaces of constant curvature\nas well as to some quotient spaces.",

The LSTM-based network then predicts human\nmovement in subsequent time steps, enabling early detection of falls. The\nproposed model was trained and validated using the OUMVLP-Pose and URFD\ndatasets, demonstrating superior performance in terms of prediction error and\nrecognition accuracy compared to models relying solely on DGNN and models from\nliterature.

The extended lifecycle of FLL in IoT systems increases their\nvulnerability to persistent attacks, and these risks may be obscured by\nperformance degradation caused by spatial-temporal data heterogeneity.\nMoreover, this problem is exacerbated by the standard single-server\narchitecture, as its single point of failure makes it difficult to maintain a\nreliable audit trail for long-term threats.

They are episodes in which the X-ray luminosity of a strongly\nmagnetised neutron star swiftly rises by several orders of magnitude to then\ndecay over the course of several months. In this work, we present simulations\nof outbursts as a consequence of localised heat deposition in a magnetised\nneutron star crust, and the subsequent surface cooling. In particular, we\nemployed a magnetothermal evolution code adapted to the study of short-term\nphenomena; that is, one including in its integration domain the outer layers of\nthe star, where heat diffusion is faster. This choice entailed the development\nand use of heat blanketing envelope models that are thinner than those found in\nthe literature as the surface boundary ondition. We find that such envelopes\ncan support a higher surface temperature than the thicker ones (albeit for less\ntime), which can account for the typical luminosities observed in outbursts\neven when coming from small hotspots (few km in radius). We study several\nparameters related to the energetics and geometry of the heating region,\nconcluding that the cooling of a crustal hotspot found in the outer part of the\ncrust can account for the luminosity evolution observed in outbursts both in\nterms of peak luminosity and timescales.

    "abstract": "With the rapid development of low-altitude wireless networking, autonomous\naerial vehicles (AAVs) have emerged as critical enablers for timely and\nreliable data delivery, particularly in remote or underserved areas. In this\ncontext, the age of information (AoI) has emerged as a critical performance\nmetric for evaluating the freshness and timeliness of transmitted information\nin Internet of things (IoT) networks. However, conventional AAV-assisted data\ntransmission is fundamentally limited by finite communication coverage ranges,\nwhich requires periodic return flights for data relay operations. This\npropulsion-repositioning cycle inevitably introduces latency spikes that raise\nthe AoI while degrading service reliability. To address these challenges, this\npaper proposes a AAV-assisted forwarding system based on distributed\nbeamforming to enhance the AoI in IoT. Specifically, AAVs collaborate via\ndistributed beamforming to collect and relay data between the sensor nodes and\nremote base station. Then, we formulate an optimization problem to minimize the\nAoI and AAV energy consumption, by jointly optimizing the AAV trajectories and\ncommunication schedules. Due to the non-convex nature of the problem and its\npronounced temporal variability, we introduce a deep reinforcement learning\nsolution that incorporates temporal sequence input, layer normalization gated\nrecurrent unit, and a squeeze-and-excitation block to capture long-term\ndependencies, thereby improving decision-making stability and accuracy, and\nreducing computational complexity. Simulation results demonstrate that the\nproposed SAC-TLS algorithm outperforms baseline algorithms in terms of\nconvergence, time average AoI, and energy consumption of AAVs.",

In fact, the key challenge in generating\nvariable-scale images lies in the differing amounts of information across\nresolutions, which requires information conversion procedures to be varied for\ngenerating variable-scaled images. In this paper, we investigate the issues of\nthree critical aspects in DMs for a unified analysis in variable-scaled\ngeneration: dilated convolution, attention mechanisms, and initial noise.\nSpecifically, 1) dilated convolution in DMs for the higher-resolution\ngeneration loses high-frequency information. 2) Attention for variable-scaled\nimage generation struggles to adjust the information aggregation adaptively. 3)\nThe spatial distribution of information in the initial noise is misaligned with\nvariable-scaled image. To solve the above problems, we propose\n\\textbf{InfoScale}, an information-centric framework for variable-scaled image\ngeneration by effectively utilizing information from three aspects\ncorrespondingly. For information loss in 1), we introduce Progressive Frequency\nCompensation module to compensate for high-frequency information lost by\ndilated convolution in higher-resolution generation. For information\naggregation inflexibility in 2), we introduce Adaptive Information Aggregation\nmodule to adaptively aggregate information in lower-resolution generation and\nachieve an effective balance between local and global information in\nhigher-resolution generation.

Unlike traditional\nquestionnaires, EEG does not interrupt the experience or rely on users'\nretrospective self-reports, thereby avoiding interference with the very state\nit aims to capture. Previous research has attempted to quantify presence in\nvirtual environments using event-related potentials (ERPs). We contend,\nhowever, that previous efforts have fallen short of fully realizing this goal,\nfailing to either A) independently manipulate presence, B) validate their\nmeasure of presence against traditional techniques, C) adequately separate the\nconstructs of presence and attention, and/or D) implement a realistic and\nimmersive environment and task. We address these shortcomings in a\npreregistered ERP experiment in which participants play an engaging target\nshooting game in VR. ERPs are time-locked to the release of a ball from a\nsling. We induce breaks in presence (BIPs) by freezing the ball's release on a\nminority of trials. Embodiment is manipulated by allowing manual manipulation\nof the sling with a realistic avatar in one condition (embodied condition) and\npassive manipulation with only controllers in another (non-embodied condition).\nWe support our predictions that the N2, the P3b, and the N400, are selectively\nsensitive towards specific components of these manipulations.

When\nLLMs respond to subjective questions posed by users, they are expected to align\nwith the views of specific demographic groups or historical periods, shaped by\nthe language in which the user interacts with the model. Existing studies\nmainly focus on researching the opinions represented by LLMs among demographic\ngroups in the United States or a few countries, lacking worldwide country\nsamples and studies on human opinions in different historical periods, as well\nas lacking discussion on using language to steer LLMs. Moreover, they also\noverlook the potential influence of prompt language on the alignment of LLMs'\nopinions.

    "abstract": "The computational overhead of traditional numerical solvers for partial\ndifferential equations (PDEs) remains a critical bottleneck for large-scale\nparametric studies and design optimization. We introduce a Minimal-Data\nParametric Neural Operator Preconditioning (MD-PNOP) framework, which\nestablishes a new paradigm for accelerating parametric PDE solvers while\nstrictly preserving physical constraints. The key idea is to recast the\nresidual from parameter deviation as additional source term, where any trained\nneural operator can be used to refine the solution in an offline fashion. This\ndirectly addresses the fundamental extrapolation limitation of neural\noperators, enabling extrapolative generalization of any neural operator trained\nat a single parameter setting across a wide range of configurations without any\nretraining. The neural operator predictions are then embedded into iterative\nPDE solvers as improved initial guesses, thereby reducing convergence\niterations without sacrificing accuracy. Unlike purely data-driven approaches,\nMD-PNOP guarantees that the governing equations remain fully enforced,\neliminating concerns about loss of physics or interpretability. The framework\nis architecture-agnostic and is demonstrated using both Deep Operator Networks\n(DeepONet) and Fourier Neural Operators (FNO) for Boltzmann transport equation\nsolvers in neutron transport applications. We demonstrated that neural\noperators trained on a single set of constant parameters successfully\naccelerate solutions with heterogeneous, sinusoidal, and discontinuous\nparameter distributions. Besides, MD-PNOP consistently achieves ~50% reduction\nin computational time while maintaining full order fidelity for fixed-source,\nsingle-group eigenvalue, and multigroup coupled eigenvalue problems.",

Although numerous research efforts have addressed this issue,\nexisting approaches often face key limitations, such as providing only constant\ncaloric output, struggling with multiple food recognition challenges,\nchallenges in image scaling and normalization, and a predominant focus on\nWestern cuisines.

Coupled with a machine learning regression model,\nour system achieves an impressive 6.94 mean absolute error (MAE), 11.03 root\nmean squared error (RMSE), and a 96.0% R^2 score in calorie estimation, making\nit both highly effective and accurate for real-world food calorie calculations.",

Aravind and Saxena [WALCOM 2024]\nintroduced this problem and showed several parameterized complexity results. In\nthis paper, we extend the known results in both negative and positive\ndirections and present sharp complexity contrasts with respect to structural\ngraph parameters.\n  We first show that the problem is NP-complete even on graphs obtained by\nadding a single vertex to a disjoint union of 5-vertex paths. By modifying the\nproof of this result, we also show the NP-completeness on graphs obtained from\na path by adding one vertex and on graphs obtained from a disjoint union of\ntriangles by adding one universal vertex. Furthermore, we show the\nNP-completeness on graphs of bandwidth 4 and maximum degree 5 by replacing the\nuniversal vertex in the last case with a long path. Under standard complexity\nassumptions, these negative results rule out fixed-parameter algorithms for\nmost of the structural parameters studied in the literature (if the solution\nsize $k$ is not part of the parameter).\n  We next present fixed-parameter algorithms parameterized by $k$ plus\nmodular-width and by $k$ plus vertex integrity. The algorithm for the latter\ncase does indeed solve a more general setting that includes the\nparameterization by the minimum vertex multiway-cut size of the terminal\nvertices. We show that this is tight in the sense that the problem\nparameterized by the minimum vertex multicut size of the terminal pairs is\nW[2]-complete. We then modify the proof of this intractability result and show\nthat the problem is W[2]-complete parameterized by $k$ even in the setting\nwhere $T = \\binom{Q}{2}$ for some $Q \\subseteq V$.",

This approach enables accurate learning without requiring\nlarge-scale human-labeled datasets. Despite its compact architecture, MILO\noutperforms existing metrics across standard FR-IQA benchmarks and offers fast\ninference suitable for real-time applications. Beyond quality prediction, we\ndemonstrate the utility of MILO as a perceptual loss in both image and latent\ndomains. In particular, we show that spatial masking modeled by MILO, when\napplied to latent representations from a VAE encoder within Stable Diffusion,\nenables efficient and perceptually aligned optimization. By combining spatial\nmasking with a curriculum learning strategy, we first process perceptually less\nrelevant regions before progressively shifting the optimization to more\nvisually distorted areas. This strategy leads to significantly improved\nperformance in tasks like denoising, super-resolution, and face restoration,\nwhile also reducing computational overhead. MILO thus functions as both a\nstate-of-the-art image quality metric and as a practical tool for perceptual\noptimization in generative pipelines.",

    "abstract": "This paper builds upon the framework of \\emph{Morse sequences}, a simple and\neffective approach to discrete Morse theory. A Morse sequence on a simplicial\ncomplex consists of a sequence of nested subcomplexes generated by expansions\nand fillings-two operations originally introduced by Whitehead. Expansions\npreserve homotopy, while fillings introduce critical simplexes that capture\nessential topological features. We extend the notion of Morse sequences to\n\\emph{stacks}, which are monotonic functions defined on simplicial complexes,\nand define \\emph{Morse sequences on stacks} as those whose expansions preserve\nthe homotopy of all sublevel sets. This extension leads to a generalization of\nthe fundamental collapse theorem to weighted simplicial complexes. Within this\nframework, we focus on a refined class of sequences called \\emph{flooding\nsequences}, which exhibit an ordering behavior similar to that of classical\nwatershed algorithms. Although not every Morse sequence on a stack is a\nflooding sequence, we show that the gradient vector field associated with any\nMorse sequence can be recovered through a flooding sequence. Finally, we\npresent algorithmic schemes for computing flooding sequences using cosimplicial\ncomplexes.",

The core challenge lies in learning robust\nquery-video alignment against spurious semantic correlations arising from\ninherent data uncertainty: 1) query ambiguity, where the query incompletely\ncharacterizes the target video and often contains uninformative tokens, and 2)\npartial video relevance, where abundant query-irrelevant segments introduce\ncontextual noise in cross-modal alignment. Existing methods often focus on\nenhancing multi-scale clip representations and retrieving the most relevant\nclip. However, the inherent data uncertainty in PRVR renders them vulnerable to\ndistractor videos with spurious similarities, leading to suboptimal\nperformance. To fill this research gap, we propose Robust Alignment Learning\n(RAL) framework, which explicitly models the uncertainty in data. Key\ninnovations include: 1) we pioneer probabilistic modeling for PRVR by encoding\nvideos and queries as multivariate Gaussian distributions. This not only\nquantifies data uncertainty but also enables proxy-level matching to capture\nthe variability in cross-modal correspondences; 2) we consider the\nheterogeneous informativeness of query words and introduce learnable confidence\ngates to dynamically weight similarity. As a plug-and-play solution, RAL can be\nseamlessly integrated into the existing architectures. Extensive experiments\nacross diverse retrieval backbones demonstrate its effectiveness.",

The\ncontinuous subjective perceived risk ratings showed significant discomfort\nassociated with perceived risk during cornering and braking followed by relief\nor even positive comfort on continuing the ride. The dynamic driving style\ninduced a stronger discomfort as compared to the calm driving style. The\ncrossing pedestrian did not affect discomfort with the calm driving style but\ndoubled the comfort decrement with the dynamic driving style. This illustrates\nthe importance of consequences of critical interactions in risk perception.\nFacial expression was successfully analyzed for 24 participants but most\n(15/24) did not show any detectable facial reaction to the critical event.\nAmong the 9 participants who did, 8 showed a Happy expression, and only 4\nshowed a Surprise expression.

Among these mechanisms, interspecies\nrecognition enables cells to modulate their movement based on the ecological\nidentity of neighboring species. Here, we introduce a model in which we assume\nbacterial species recognizes each other and interact via local signals that\neither enhance or suppress the motility of neighboring cells. Through\nlarge-scale simulations and a coarse-grained stochastic model, we demonstrate\nthe emergence of a sharp transition driven by nucleation processes: increasing\nthe density of motility-suppressing interactions drives the system from a fully\nmixed, motile phase to a state characterized by large, stationary bacterial\nclusters. Remarkably, in systems with a large number of interacting species,\nthis transition can be triggered solely by altering the structure of the\nmotility-regulation interaction matrix while maintaining species and\ninteraction densities constant. In particular, we find that heterogeneous and\nmodular interactions promote the transition more readily than homogeneous\nrandom ones. These results contribute to the ongoing effort to understand\nmicrobial interactions, suggesting that structured, non-random ones may be key\nto reproducing commonly observed spatial patterns in microbial communities.",

We source two publicly\navailable, identically initialized Qwen2.5 models, one fine-tuned with\nsupervised fine-tuning (SFT) and the other with group relative policy\noptimization (GRPO) on the same dataset.

To prevent privacy risks from the inadvertent exposure of training\ndata, we propose a Privacy Preserving Vector Database (PPVD) approach, which\ninvolves model memory search, high-risk database construction, secure database\nconstruction, and match-and-replace, four key stages to minimize privacy\nleakage during inference collectively. Experimental results show that DPF-CM\nsignificantly improves model accuracy, enabling our trained Chinese medical LLM\nto achieve state-of-the-art performance among open-source counterparts.\nMoreover, the framework reduces training data privacy leakage by 27%.",

Moreover, fine-tuning LLMs/VLMs requires\nsignificant computational resources, and for many high-performing general-use\nproprietary models (e.g., GPT or Gemini), fine-tuning access is not available.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel part retrieval framework that requires no\nextra training, but using Error Notebooks + RAG for refined prompt engineering\nto help improve the existing general model's retrieval performance. The\nconstruction of Error Notebooks consists of two steps: (1) collecting\nhistorical erroneous CoTs and their incorrect answers, and (2) connecting these\nCoTs through reflective corrections until the correct solutions are obtained.\nAs a result, the Error Notebooks serve as a repository of tasks along with\ntheir corrected CoTs and final answers. RAG is then employed to retrieve\nspecification-relevant records from the Error Notebooks and incorporate them\ninto the inference process. Another major contribution of our work is a\nhuman-in-the-loop CAD dataset, which is used to evaluate our method. In\naddition, the engineering value of our novel framework lies in its ability to\neffectively handle 3D models with lengthy, non-natural language metadata.\nExperiments with proprietary models, including GPT-4o and the Gemini series,\nshow substantial gains, with GPT-4o (Omni) achieving up to a 23.4% absolute\naccuracy improvement on the human preference dataset.

Since\ncomputational efficiency is key to enable timely intervention against predicted\nviolations, several state-of-the-art QPM approaches rely on fast\nmachine-learning surrogates to provide prediction intervals for the\nsatisfaction values, using conformal inference to offer statistical guarantees.\nHowever, these QPM methods suffer when the monitored agent exhibits multi-modal\ndynamics, whereby certain modes may yield high satisfaction values while others\ncritically violate the property. Existing QPM methods are mode-agnostic and so\nwould yield overly conservative and uninformative intervals that lack\nmeaningful mode-specific satisfaction information. To address this problem, we\npresent GenQPM, a method that leverages deep generative models, specifically\nscore-based diffusion models, to reliably approximate the probabilistic and\nmulti-modal system dynamics without requiring explicit model access. GenQPM\nemploys a mode classifier to partition the predicted trajectories by dynamical\nmode. For each mode, we then apply conformal inference to produce statistically\nvalid, mode-specific prediction intervals. We demonstrate the effectiveness of\nGenQPM on a benchmark of agent navigation and autonomous driving tasks,\nresulting in prediction intervals that are significantly more informative (less\nconservative) than mode-agnostic baselines.",

To address this, we introduce a Korean Benchmark for Legal\nEXplainable QA (KoBLEX), designed to evaluate provision-grounded, multi-hop\nlegal reasoning. KoBLEX includes 226 scenario-based QA instances and their\nsupporting provisions, created using a hybrid LLM-human expert pipeline. We\nalso propose a method called Parametric provision-guided Selection Retrieval\n(ParSeR), which uses LLM-generated parametric provisions to guide legally\ngrounded and reliable answers. ParSeR facilitates multi-hop reasoning on\ncomplex legal questions by generating parametric provisions and employing a\nthree-stage sequential retrieval process. Furthermore, to better evaluate the\nlegal fidelity of the generated answers, we propose Legal Fidelity Evaluation\n(LF-Eval). LF-Eval is an automatic metric that jointly considers the question,\nanswer, and supporting provisions and shows a high correlation with human\njudgments. Experimental results show that ParSeR consistently outperforms\nstrong baselines, achieving the best results across multiple LLMs. Notably,\ncompared to standard retrieval with GPT-4o, ParSeR achieves +37.91 higher F1\nand +30.81 higher LF-Eval. Further analyses reveal that ParSeR efficiently\ndelivers consistent performance across reasoning depths, with ablations\nconfirming the effectiveness of ParSeR.",

    "abstract": "We introduce LongCat-Flash, a 560-billion-parameter Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)\nlanguage model designed for both computational efficiency and advanced agentic\ncapabilities. Stemming from the need for scalable efficiency, LongCat-Flash\nadopts two novel designs: (a) Zero-computation Experts, which enables dynamic\ncomputational budget allocation and activates 18.6B-31.3B (27B on average) per\ntoken depending on contextual demands, optimizing resource usage. (b)\nShortcut-connected MoE, which enlarges the computation-communication overlap\nwindow, demonstrating notable gains in inference efficiency and throughput\ncompared to models of a comparable scale. We develop a comprehensive scaling\nframework for large models that combines hyperparameter transfer, model-growth\ninitialization, a multi-pronged stability suite, and deterministic computation\nto achieve stable and reproducible training. Notably, leveraging the synergy\namong scalable architectural design and infrastructure efforts, we complete\nmodel training on more than 20 trillion tokens within 30 days, while achieving\nover 100 tokens per second (TPS) for inference at a cost of \\$0.70 per million\noutput tokens. To cultivate LongCat-Flash towards agentic intelligence, we\nconduct a large-scale pre-training on optimized mixtures, followed by targeted\nmid- and post-training on reasoning, code, and instructions, with further\naugmentation from synthetic data and tool use tasks. Comprehensive evaluations\ndemonstrate that, as a non-thinking foundation model, LongCat-Flash delivers\nhighly competitive performance among other leading models, with exceptional\nstrengths in agentic tasks.

To\nmitigate this issue, we propose DEPO, a Data-Efficient Policy Optimization\npipeline that combines optimized strategies for both offline and online data\nselection. In the offline phase, we curate a high-quality subset of training\nsamples based on diversity, influence, and appropriate difficulty. During\nonline RLVR training, we introduce a sample-level explorability metric to\ndynamically filter samples with low exploration potential, thereby reducing\nsubstantial rollout computational costs. Furthermore, we incorporate a replay\nmechanism for under-explored samples to ensure adequate training, which\nenhances the model's final convergence performance. Experiments across five\nreasoning benchmarks show that DEPO consistently outperforms existing methods\nin both offline and online data selection scenarios. Notably, using only 20% of\nthe training data, our approach achieves a 1.85 times speed-up on AIME24 and a\n1.66 times speed-up on AIME25 compared to GRPO trained on the full dataset.",

While deep learning models have shown promise in forecasting\nthese signals, their deployment in healthcare remains limited in part because\nclinicians must be able to trust and interpret model outputs. Without reliable\nuncertainty quantification -- particularly calibrated prediction intervals\n(PIs) -- it is unclear whether a forecasted abnormality constitutes a\nmeaningful warning or merely reflects model noise, hindering clinical\ndecision-making. To address this, we present two methods for deriving PIs from\nthe Reconstruction Uncertainty Estimate (RUE), an uncertainty measure\nwell-suited to vital-sign forecasting due to its sensitivity to data shifts and\nsupport for label-free calibration. Our parametric approach assumes that\nprediction errors and uncertainty estimates follow a Gaussian copula\ndistribution, enabling closed-form PI computation. Our non-parametric approach,\nbased on k-nearest neighbours (KNN), empirically estimates the conditional\nerror distribution using similar validation instances. We evaluate these\nmethods on two large public datasets with minute- and hour-level sampling,\nrepresenting high- and low-frequency health signals. Experiments demonstrate\nthat the Gaussian copula method consistently outperforms conformal prediction\nbaselines on low-frequency data, while the KNN approach performs best on\nhigh-frequency data. These results underscore the clinical promise of\nRUE-derived PIs for delivering interpretable, uncertainty-aware vital sign\nforecasts.",

Existing solutions, however,\noften tightly couple fuzzers with built-in simulators that lack support for\nhardware peripherals and offer limited flexibility, restricting their ability\nto test embedded software. To address these limitations, we present a framework\nthat allows the integration of American-Fuzzy-Lop-based fuzzers and\nSystemC-based simulators. The framework provides a harness to decouple the\nadopted fuzzer and simulator. In addition, it intercepts peripheral accesses\nand queries the fuzzer for values, effectively linking peripheral behavior to\nthe fuzzer.

In this\nwork, we draw on software requirements engineering to propose Specine, a novel\nspecification alignment technique for LLM code generation. Its key idea is to\nidentify misaligned input specifications, lift LLM-perceived specifications,\nand align them to enhance the code generation performance of LLMs. Our\ncomprehensive experiments on four state-of-the-art LLMs across five challenging\ncompetitive benchmarks by comparing with ten state-of-the-art baselines,\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of Specine. For example, Specine outperforms the\nmost effective baseline, achieving an average improvement of 29.60% across all\nsubjects in terms of Pass@1.",

    "abstract": "While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in the table question\nanswering (TQA) task through prompt engineering, they face challenges in\nindustrial applications, including structural heterogeneity, difficulties in\ntarget data localization, and bottlenecks in complex reasoning. To address\nthese limitations, this paper presents TableZoomer, a novel LLM-powered,\nprogramming-based agent framework. It introduces three key innovations: (1)\nreplacing the original fully verbalized table with structured table schema to\nbridge the semantic gap and reduce computational complexity; (2) a query-aware\ntable zooming mechanism that dynamically generates sub-table schema through\ncolumn selection and entity linking, significantly improving target\nlocalization efficiency; and (3) a Program-of-Thoughts (PoT) strategy that\ntransforms queries into executable code to mitigate numerical hallucination.\nAdditionally, we integrate the reasoning workflow with the ReAct paradigm to\nenable iterative reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our\nframework maintains the usability advantages while substantially enhancing\nperformance and scalability across tables of varying scales. When implemented\nwith the Qwen3-8B-Instruct LLM, TableZoomer achieves accuracy improvements of\n19.34% and 25% over conventional PoT methods on the large-scale DataBench\ndataset and the small-scale Fact Checking task of TableBench dataset,\nrespectively.",

    "abstract": "Text-to-SQL, the task of translating natural language questions into SQL\nqueries, has significantly advanced with the introduction of Large Language\nModels (LLMs), broadening database accessibility for a wide range of users.\nDespite substantial progress in generating valid SQL, current LLMs still\nstruggle with complex queries that require precise alignment between user\nintent and the database schema. To mitigate this, test-time strategies such as\nBest-of-N (BoN) and Majority Voting (Maj) are often employed, based on the\nassumption that LLMs can generate correct answers but may require multiple\nattempts. However, these methods rely on surface-level heuristics, selecting\neither the syntactically correct query through execution-based BoN (ex-BoN) or\nthe most frequently generated query with Maj. Recently, Outcome Reward Models\n(ORMs), which assign utility scores to generated outputs based on semantic\ncorrectness, have emerged as a promising approach for better aligning model\npredictions with user intent. Nevertheless, their application to Text-to-SQL\nremains largely underexplored.\n  In this work, we evaluate ORMs as an effective heuristic for BoN, compare\nthem with ex-BoN and Maj, and introduce a framework for training ORMs for the\nText-to-SQL task. We evaluate our ORMs on the BIRD and SPIDER benchmarks,\nfinetuning various open-source LLMs, including the Qwen2, Granite3, and Llama3\nmodel families. Our results show that ORMs outperform ex-BoN and Maj, achieving\nexecution accuracy gains of +4.33% (BIRD) and +2.10% (Spider) over ex-BoN, and\n+2.91% (BIRD) and +0.93% (Spider) over Maj. We further demonstrate that\nfinetuning models already aligned with SQL generation, such as OmniSQL, yields\nsuperior ORM performance. Additionally, we observe that ORMs achieve\ncompetitive results on simple queries and benefit more from an increased number\nof candidates compared to ex-BoN and Maj.",

Utilising high-resolution archival data from AstroSat/UVIT for UV\nimaging and the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) for CO(2-1)\nmolecular gas mapping, we explore recent star formation and gas distribution\nwith a spatial resolution of about 120 to 132 pc. Our findings reveal a\nsublinear rKS law, with slopes ranging from about 0.17 to 0.71. Notably, NGC\n1566 exhibits a robust rKS relation consistent with previous studies, while NGC\n1365 and NGC 1433 show weaker correlations. These differences are likely due to\nthe smaller number of identified star-forming regions in these galaxies\ncompared to NGC 1566, as well as the central molecular gas concentrations and\nvarying star formation activity in their bars and nuclear regions. These\nresults also support the idea that the rKS relation deviates from linearity in\nextreme environments, such as starburst galaxies and galactic centres.\nAdditionally, we find a generally low median star formation efficiency (SFE)\nwithin the bars of these galaxies, suggesting that while bars may drive nuclear\nstarbursts and contribute to bulge growth, they do not significantly increase\nSFE. Furthermore, a negative correlation between SFE and Sigma H2 is observed\nacross the sample, both within and outside the bar regions, suggesting that\nhigher Sigma H2 may lead to lower SFE in the central regions of these galaxies.\nOur findings highlight that Sigma H2 plays a primary role in shaping the\nobserved trends in SFE, rather than the presence of a bar itself.",

Existing methods often address the two challenges in\nisolation, relying on brittle heuristics that fail in scenarios where temporal\nrequirements and staleness resistance are intertwined.

Numerous efforts have been made to match its abundance pattern. However,\nno model satisfactorily explains its entire surface chemical composition. The\nhigh CNO pattern with [N/Fe]>[C/Fe]>[O/Fe], the light element 'slide' (between\nNa and Si), and the presence of Sr and Ba in HE 1327 is reminiscent of those\nasymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars that undergo third dredge-up, hot bottom\nburning, and s-processing, suggesting that AGBs may have been progenitors of\nthe star. We assume that, where HE 1327 formed, the interstellar medium was\nwell-mixed, and adopt an initial stellar composition based on the observed\nchemical evolution of the early universe. We calculated models of\nhyper-metal-poor AGB stars and compared their yields to the observed abundances\nof HE 1327. Our 3 Msun models match 13 of the 14 measured elements in HE1327.\nThey are also consistent with the seven elements with upper limits. The only\ndiscrepancy is O, underproduced by 0.5-1.0 dex. Unlike the SN models, the AGB\nmodels also match Sr and Ba. Our model predicts high abundances of P and Pb,\nwhich would be useful in testing the AGB scenario. We propose that HE 1327 is\nthe oldest known object that shows nucleosynthetic evidence of the first AGB\nstars. With lifetimes as short as 200 Myr, these stars may have formed and\npolluted the universe very early. Recent Pop III star formation simulations\nsupport their formation, and their strong N production is qualitatively\nconsistent with recent JWST observations showing high N/O ratios just 440 Myr\nafter the Big Bang. Importantly, our results also suggest that the interstellar\nmedium may have shown some degree of homogeneity and mixing even at these early\nepochs.",

    "abstract": "Cross-domain few-shot segmentation (CD-FSS) not only enables the segmentation\nof unseen categories with very limited samples, but also improves cross-domain\ngeneralization ability within the few-shot segmentation framework. Currently,\nexisting CD-FSS studies typically design multiple independent modules to\nenhance the cross-domain generalization ability of feature representations.\nHowever, the independence among these modules hinders the effective flow of\nknowledge, making it difficult to fully leverage their collective potential. In\ncontrast, this paper proposes an all-in-one module based on ordinary\ndifferential equations and Fourier transform, resulting in a structurally\nconcise method--Few-Shot Segmentation over Time Intervals (FSS-TIs). FSS-TIs\nassumes the existence of an ODE relationship between the spectra (including\namplitude and phase spectra) of domain-specific features and domain-agnostic\nfeatures. This ODE formulation yields an iterative transformation process along\na sequence of time intervals, while simultaneously applying affine\ntransformations with randomized perturbations to the spectra. In doing so, the\nexploration of domain-agnostic feature representation spaces and the simulation\nof diverse potential target-domain distributions are reformulated as an\noptimization process over the intrinsic parameters of the ODE. Moreover, we\nstrictly constrain the support-sample selection during target-domain\nfine-tuning so that it is consistent with the requirements of real-world\nfew-shot segmentation tasks. For evaluation, we introduce five datasets from\nsubstantially different domains and define two sets of cross-domain few-shot\nsegmentation tasks to comprehensively analyze the performance of FSS-TIs.\nExperimental results demonstrate the superiority of FSS-TIs over existing\nCD-FSS methods, and in-depth ablation studies further validate the cross-domain\nadaptability of FSS-TIs.",

    "abstract": "We review recent findings from a detailed simulation study of the merging\ncluster El Gordo and present new results inferred from weak lensing data. We\nfound that the observed spatial offsets between the different mass components\nare well reproduced in merging simulations that include self-interacting dark\nmatter (DM), with an elastic cross-section per unit mass of approximately\n\\sigma_DM/m_X ~ 4 -5 cm^2/gr. Moreover, a relative line-of-sight peculiar\nvelocity on the order of several hundred km/s is found between the two stellar\ncomponents of the colliding subclusters. These findings strongly suggest the\npossibility that, in a very energetic cluster collision, DM could possess\ncollisional properties. However, the self-interacting DM merger model presented\nhere is not without difficulties. The values found for \\sigma_DM/m_X being in\nconflict with the current upper bounds on cluster scales. As a solution to this\ntension we argue that in major cluster mergers the physical modeling of DM\ninteractions, based on the scattering of DM particles, should be considered too\nsimplistic. Additionally, the DM halos of the post-collision clusters have\ncored density profiles with core radii r_c ~ 300 kpc. Consequently, the\nassociated reduced tangential shear lensing profiles consistently tend to zero\nat angles \\theta <~ 40^{''}. This result is inconsistent with what is deduced\nfrom the measured profiles. These profiles exhibit a diverging behavior when\n\\theta --> 0, as predicted by an NFW mass model. We argue that such\ncontradictions cannot be easily reconciled within the DM models presented so\nfar as an alternative to the collisionless paradigm. However, we suggest that\nthis tension can be used as a unique test bed to probe new DM physics.",

This makes it difficult to interpret which\nfactors drive performance and can hinder generalization. In this work, we\nintroduce a disentangled multi-context meta-learning framework that explicitly\nassigns each task factor to a distinct context vector. By decoupling these\nvariations, our approach improves robustness through deeper task understanding\nand enhances generalization by enabling context vector sharing across tasks\nwith shared factors. We evaluate our approach in two domains. First, on a\nsinusoidal regression task, our model outperforms baselines on\nout-of-distribution tasks and generalizes to unseen sine functions by sharing\ncontext vectors associated with shared amplitudes or phase shifts. Second, in a\nquadruped robot locomotion task, we disentangle the robot-specific properties\nand the characteristics of the terrain in the robot dynamics model. By\ntransferring disentangled context vectors acquired from the dynamics model into\nreinforcement learning, the resulting policy achieves improved robustness under\nout-of-distribution conditions, surpassing the baselines that rely on a single\nunified context. Furthermore, by effectively sharing context, our model enables\nsuccessful sim-to-real policy transfer to challenging terrains with\nout-of-distribution robot-specific properties, using just 20 seconds of real\ndata from flat terrain, a result not achievable with single-task adaptation.",

However, rigorously testing the underlying multimodal Human Trajectory\nPrediction (HTP) models, which typically use multiple input sources (e.g.,\ntrajectory history and environment maps) and produce stochastic outputs\n(multiple possible future paths), presents significant challenges. The primary\ndifficulty lies in the absence of a definitive test oracle, as numerous future\ntrajectories might be plausible for any given scenario. Objectives: This\nresearch presents the application of Metamorphic Testing (MT) as a systematic\nmethodology for testing multimodal HTP systems. We address the oracle problem\nthrough metamorphic relations (MRs) adapted for the complexities and stochastic\nnature of HTP. Methods: We present five MRs, targeting transformations of both\nhistorical trajectory data and semantic segmentation maps used as an\nenvironmental context. These MRs encompass: 1) label-preserving geometric\ntransformations (mirroring, rotation, rescaling) applied to both trajectory and\nmap inputs, where outputs are expected to transform correspondingly. 2)\nMap-altering transformations (changing semantic class labels, introducing\nobstacles) with predictable changes in trajectory distributions. We propose\nprobabilistic violation criteria based on distance metrics between probability\ndistributions, such as the Wasserstein or Hellinger distance. Conclusion: This\nstudy introduces tool, a MT framework for the oracle-less testing of\nmultimodal, stochastic HTP systems.

The concept of the\nradial epiderivative constitutes a distinct generalization of classical\nderivative notions, as it replaces the conventional limit operation with an\ninfimum-based construction. This formulation permits the analysis of\ndirectional behavior without invoking standard neighborhood-based assumptions\nand constructions commonly required in generalized differentiation. This leads\nto one of the key advantages of the radial epiderivative which lies in its\napplicability even to discrete domains, where classical and generalized\nderivatives are often inapplicable or undefined. The other advantage of this\nconcept is that it provides a possibility to inverstigate KKT conditions for\nglobal minimums. Consequently, this approach necessitates a reformulation of\nfundamental analytical tools such as gradient vectors, feasible direction sets,\nconstraint qualifications and other concepts which are central to the\nderivation of optimality conditions in smooth optimization theory.

To this end, we introduce IS${}^3$, a neural network designed for\nImpulsive--Stationary Sound Separation, that isolates impulsive acoustic events\nfrom the stationary background using a deep filtering approach, that can act as\na pre-processing stage for the above-mentioned tasks. To ensure optimal\ntraining, we propose a sophisticated data generation pipeline that curates and\nadapts existing datasets for this task. We demonstrate that a learning-based\napproach, build on a relatively lightweight neural architecture and trained\nwith well-designed and varied data, is successful in this previously\nunaddressed task, outperforming the Harmonic--Percussive Sound Separation\nmasking method, adapted from music signal processing research, and wavelet\nfiltering on objective separation metrics.",

Rhenium disulfide (ReS$_2$) stands out for its\nstrong in-plane anisotropy and its thickness-independent direct-bandgap\nexcitons, which can hybridize with light to form exciton-polaritons. In\nparallel, metasurfaces, engineered arrays of nanoscale subwavelength\nresonators, can support ultra-sharp photonic modes in the form of quasi-bound\nstates in the continuum (qBICs). Topological transformations of photonic modes\ncan give rise to flatbands, i.e., dispersionless states with quenched kinetic\nenergy and vanishing group velocity. Intrinsic material anisotropy offers an\nunexplored route to robust far-field flatband formation and control. Here, we\ndemonstrate how structuring an intrinsically anisotropic excitonic material\ninto a resonant metasurface fundamentally transforms its photonic topological\nfeatures and light-matter coupling behavior, allowing us to drive and\ntopologically control extended far-field flatband formation. To this end, we\nfabricate C$_4$-symmetric metasurfaces directly from bulk ReS$_2$. The\nintrinsic anisotropy lifts the initial double degeneracy of the qBIC mode and\nyields two distinctly polarized resonances. It also reshapes the topological\nlandscape: the integer topological charge of the qBIC mode splits into\nmomentum-separated half-integer singularities, thereby flattening the far-field\nphotonic dispersion. The resulting topologically-controlled photonic flatbands\nare then tuned in resonance with the linearly polarized excitonic transitions\nof ReS$_2$, resulting in two distinct, directionally hybridized\nexciton-polariton flatband regimes. These findings establish anisotropic vdW\nmetasurfaces as a new platform for topologically engineered flatbands and\nflatband-driven light-matter coupling.",

    "abstract": "Expressivity theory, characterizing which graphs a GNN can distinguish, has\nbecome the predominant framework for analyzing GNNs, with new models striving\nfor higher expressivity. However, we argue that this focus is misguided: First,\nhigher expressivity is not necessary for most real-world tasks as these tasks\nrarely require expressivity beyond the basic WL test. Second, expressivity\ntheory's binary characterization and idealized assumptions fail to reflect\nGNNs' practical capabilities. To overcome these limitations, we propose Message\nPassing Complexity (MPC): a continuous measure that quantifies the difficulty\nfor a GNN architecture to solve a given task through message passing. MPC\ncaptures practical limitations like over-squashing while preserving the\ntheoretical impossibility results from expressivity theory, effectively\nnarrowing the gap between theory and practice. Through extensive validation on\nfundamental GNN tasks, we show that MPC's theoretical predictions correlate\nwith empirical performance, successfully explaining architectural successes and\nfailures. Thereby, MPC advances beyond expressivity theory to provide a more\npowerful and nuanced framework for understanding and improving GNN\narchitectures.",

Most existing\ngenerative approaches for point cloud self-supervised learning focus on\nrecovering masked points from visible ones within a single view. Recognizing\nthat a two-view pre-training paradigm inherently introduces greater diversity\nand variance, it may thus enable more challenging and informative pre-training.\nInspired by this, we explore the potential of two-view learning in this domain.\nIn this paper, we propose Point-PQAE, a cross-reconstruction generative\nparadigm that first generates two decoupled point clouds/views and then\nreconstructs one from the other. To achieve this goal, we develop a crop\nmechanism for point cloud view generation for the first time and further\npropose a novel positional encoding to represent the 3D relative position\nbetween the two decoupled views. The cross-reconstruction significantly\nincreases the difficulty of pre-training compared to self-reconstruction, which\nenables our method to surpass previous single-modal self-reconstruction methods\nin 3D self-supervised learning. Specifically, it outperforms the\nself-reconstruction baseline (Point-MAE) by 6.5%, 7.0%, and 6.7% in three\nvariants of ScanObjectNN with the Mlp-Linear evaluation protocol.

The PDR concept overcomes key technological challenges\nof conventional accelerator-driven systems, particularly the target's\nstructural durability and its thermal management, by employing synchrotron\nphotons directly interacting with fissile material to induce photonuclear\nreactions. Computational analyses involved criticality and fixed-source\nsimulation using MCNPx and SERPENT Monte Carlo codes, providing robust\nevaluation of the neutron production, moderation, and multiplication\nmechanisms. The main focus of this study was to evaluate the system's\ncapability to achieve a positive net energy gain, specifically assessing the\nthermal power output agains the electrical power absorbed from the grid.\nFurthermore, the adoption of spent nuclear fuel for the subcritical reactor\ncore loading has been investigated, highlighting the sustainability and\nenvironmental benefits of the proposed PDR design. The proposed system is able\nto exploit a modularity feature. For each large synchrotron, up to fifty beam\nlines may be operated simultaneously, each delivering photons to an independent\nsubcritical reactor core. With a photon flux on the order of $8.8 \\times\n10^{17}$ photons per second in each beamline, the results indicate that each\nindividual reactor can achieve a thermal output up to 8 MW, while requiring\nabout 435-660 kW of electrical input from the grid, thereby demonstrating the\nfeasibility of energy amplification in the PDR.",

This results in a critical knowledge gap regarding\nthe principles governing the phonon sidebands of parity-forbidden electronic\ntransitions. This study experimentally reveals a pronounced parity-dependent\nintensity distribution in the phonon sidebands of these systems: significantly\nsuppressed even-order sidebands and normally observed odd-order sidebands. To\nelucidate the phenomenon, we extend the Huang-Rhys theory to parity-forbidden\nsystems by incorporating the Herzberg-Teller approximation into the treatment\nof the transition matrix elements. The improved theory successfully uncovers\nthe physical mechanism behind the strong suppression of the even-order\nsidebands in the parity-forbidden systems, in which the Huang-Rhys factor is\nderived as S=((2I_3)/(9I_1 ))^(1/2).

    "abstract": "Recent developments in storage -- especially in the area of resistive random\naccess memory (ReRAM) -- are attempting to scale the storage density by\nregarding the information data as two-dimensional (2D), instead of\none-dimensional (1D). Correspondingly, new types of 2D constraints are\nintroduced into the input information data to improve the system reliability.\nWhile 1D constraints have been extensively investigated in the literature, the\nstudy for 2D constraints is much less profound. Particularly, given a\nconstraint $\\mathcal{F}$ and a design of 1D codes whose codewords satisfy\n$\\mathcal{F}$, the problem of constructing efficient 2D codes, such that every\nrow and every column in every codeword satisfy $\\mathcal{F}$, has been a\nchallenge. This work provides an efficient solution to the challenging coding\nproblem above for the binary bounded-weight constrained codes that restrict the\nmaximum number of $1$'s (called {\\em weight}). Formally, we propose a universal\nframework to design 2D codes that guarantee the weight of every row and every\ncolumn of length $n$ to be at most $f(n)$ for any given function $f(n)$. We\nshow that if there exists a design of capacity-approaching 1D codes, then our\nmethod also provides capacity-approaching 2D codes for all $f=\\omega(\\log n)$.",

While previous studies have examined individual SHS configurations\nsuch as post-type, ridge-type, and transverse ridge-type surfaces, a unified\nanalysis that connects these patterns through geometric parameterization\nremains limited. In this study, we propose a systematic framework to explore\nthe drag reduction characteristics by varying the streamwise and spanwise\nspacing ($d_1, d_2$) of post-type patterns, effectively encompassing a range of\nSHS geometries. High-fidelity direct numerical simulations (DNS) were performed\nusing NekRS, a GPU-accelerated spectral element solver, to resolve\nincompressible turbulent channel flows over these SHSs. To account for\nvariability in the geometric parameters and quantify their influence, we\nconstruct a surrogate model based on polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) using\nLatin hypercube sampling (LHS) method. The resulting model enables efficient\nuncertainty quantification (UQ) and sensitivity analysis, revealing the\nrelative importance of $d_1$ and $d_2$ in drag reduction performance. This\nunified UQ framework provides both predictive capability and design guidance\nfor optimizing SHS configurations under uncertain geometric conditions.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in\nlanguage understanding and reasoning. However, their dependence on static\ntraining corpora makes them prone to factual errors and knowledge gaps.\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this limitation by incorporating\nexternal knowledge sources, especially structured Knowledge Graphs (KGs), which\nprovide explicit semantics and efficient retrieval. Existing KG-based RAG\napproaches, however, generally assume that anchor entities are accessible to\ninitiate graph traversal, which limits their robustness in open world settings\nwhere accurate linking between the query and the entity is unreliable. To\novercome this limitation, we propose AnchorRAG, a novel multi-agent\ncollaboration framework for open-world RAG without the predefined anchor\nentities. Specifically, a predictor agent dynamically identifies candidate\nanchor entities by aligning user query terms with KG nodes and initializes\nindependent retriever agents to conduct parallel multi-hop explorations from\neach candidate. Then a supervisor agent formulates the iterative retrieval\nstrategy for these retriever agents and synthesizes the resulting knowledge\npaths to generate the final answer. This multi-agent collaboration framework\nimproves retrieval robustness and mitigates the impact of ambiguous or\nerroneous anchors. Extensive experiments on four public benchmarks demonstrate\nthat AnchorRAG significantly outperforms existing baselines and establishes new\nstate-of-the-art results on the real-world question answering tasks.",

The BH inclination angles are set to $17^{\\circ}$,\n$50^{\\circ}$ and $90^{\\circ}$ for the analysis. Our results indicate that,\nwithin the constrained parameter space consistent with both M87$^{*}$ and Sgr\nA$^{*}$, the shared parameter bounds derived from the rotating Sen BH are given\nby $0.133158M<q_{m}<0.215561M$.",

With many\nopen-source LLMs available, selecting the best model for fine-tuning downstream\ntasks is challenging, primarily focusing on how to quickly identify the optimal\nLLM. We introduce a Data and Model Compression Framework (DaMoC) that addresses\nthis challenge by: 1) Data Level: A systematic categorization of data filtering\nmethodologies for LLMs is first established, classifying them into three\ndistinct paradigms: (1) distribution-aware methods, (2) quality-aware methods,\nand (3) hybrid approaches considering both dimensions. Further, we enhance the\ndensity of key tokens in the text achieving token compression. Subsequently, we\nuse an LLM to iterative rewrite the text to optimize its expression. 2) Model\nLevel: We use layer similarity scores to assess each layer's importance and\nremove those with lower importance. Then, we introduce a sparse merging\nparadigm to preserve as much of the original model's capability as possible.\nExtensive experiments on four datasets, medical Q&A, financial Q&A, general\nQ&A, and reading comprehension, show that we can select the optimal LLM while\nsaving approximately 20-fold in training time.",

    "abstract": "(abridged) Recent analyses have reported low lithium but high beryllium\nabundances on the solar surface; however, standard solar models (SSMs) predict\nLi abundances that are ~30$\\sigma$ away from the observed value. In this study,\nwe aim to develop solar models and compare them with the Li and Be abundance\nconstraints. We examine the effect of protosolar accretion and turbulent mixing\nbelow the base of the surface convective zone. We compute ~200 solar\nevolutionary models for each case to optimize input parameters using target\nquantities, similar to the SSM framework. We confirm that turbulent mixing\nhelps reproduce the surface Li and Be abundances within ~0.6$\\sigma$ by\nenhancing burning. It suppresses gravitational settling, leading to a better\nmatching of the He surface abundance ($\\lesssim$0.3$\\sigma$) and a smaller\ncompositional gradient. We derive a new protosolar helium abundance $Y_{\\rm\nproto}=0.2651\\pm0.0035$. Turbulent mixing decreases the central metallicity\n($Z_{\\mathrm{center}}$) by $\\approx$4.4%, even though accretion increases\n$Z_{\\rm center}$ by $\\approx$4.4%, as suggested by our previous study.\nUnfortunately, the reduction in $Z_{\\rm center}$ implies that our models do not\nreproduce constraints on observed neutrino fluxes by $6.2\\sigma$ for $^8{\\rm\nB}$ and $2.7\\sigma$ for CNO. Including turbulent mixing in solar models appears\nindispensable to reproduce the observed atmospheric abundances of Li and Be.\nHowever, the resulting tensions in terms of neutrino fluxes, even in the models\nwith the protosolar accretion, show that the solar modeling problem remains, at\nleast partly. We suggest that improved electron screening, as well as other\nmicroscopic properties, may help alleviate this problem. An independent\nconfirmation of the neutrino fluxes measured by the Borexino experiment would\nalso be extremely valuable.",

This\nproblem is particularly critical for large language models (LLMs) undergoing\ncontinual learning, as retaining performance across diverse domains is\nimportant for their general utility. In this paper, we explore model growth, a\npromising strategy that leverages smaller models to expedite and structure the\ntraining of larger ones for mitigating the catastrophic forgetting problem.\nAlthough growth-based pretraining, particularly via transformer stacking, has\nshown promise in accelerating convergence, its impact on forgetting remains\nunder-explored. Therefore, we evaluate whether growth-based models can retain\npreviously learned capabilities more effectively across a sequence of\nfine-tuning tasks involving domain knowledge, reasoning, reading comprehension,\nand bias. Our findings show that both models -- one trained with growth (Stack\nLLM) and one without (LLM) -- exhibit improvements in domain knowledge.\nHowever, reasoning and reading comprehension degrade over time, indicating\nsigns of catastrophic forgetting. Stack LLM consistently shows less\ndegradation, especially in reading comprehension, suggesting enhanced retention\ncapabilities. Interestingly, in bias evaluation, the baseline LLM becomes\nprogressively more neutral with continued fine-tuning, while Stack LLM\nmaintains a steady bias ratio around 60--61\\%. These results indicate that\ngrowth-based pretraining may deliver modest improvements in resisting\ncatastrophic forgetting, though trade-offs remain in handling social biases.",

We design 11 representative attack variants that\nencompass domain name tampering (homoglyph deception, character substitution,\netc.), link structure camouflage (sub-directory nesting, sub-domain grafting,\nparameter obfuscation, etc.), and other deceptive techniques tailored to\nexploit MAS's vulnerabilities in link validation. Through extensive experiments\non these crafted attack vectors, we demonstrate that Web fraud attacks not only\nexhibit significant destructive potential across different MAS architectures\nbut also possess a distinct advantage in evasion: they circumvent the need for\ncomplex input formats such as jailbreaking, which inherently carry higher\nexposure risks. These results underscore the importance of addressing Web fraud\nattacks in LLM-driven MAS, as their stealthiness and destructiveness pose\nnon-negligible threats to system security and user safety.",

Firstly, due to various features in endoscopic scenes with different\ntissues, a novel block-wise mixture of dynamic low-rank experts is proposed to\nefficiently finetuning the foundation model for endoscopic depth estimation. In\nthe proposed module, based on the input feature, different experts with a small\namount of trainable parameters are adaptively selected for weighted inference,\nfrom various mixture of low-rank experts which are allocated based on the\ntraining quality of each block. Moreover, a novel self-supervised training\nframework is proposed to jointly cope with the inconsistency of brightness and\nreflectance. The proposed method outperform state-of-the-art works on both\nrealistic and simulated endoscopic datasets. Furthermore, the proposed network\nalso achieves the best generalization based on zero-shot depth estimation on\ndiverse endoscopic scenes.

Focusing on the Schwarzschild and\nKerr solutions, we show that the asymptotic structure of the Kerr spacetime can\nbe generated from the Schwarzschild geometry via two successive\nsupertranslations. These transformations yield a Kerr-like geometry at null\ninfinity and reveal two distinct classes of supertranslation functions.

The\nsecond, characterized by an infinite series of even-parity Legendre polynomials\n($l \\geq 2$), captures the intrinsic mass multipole structure of the Kerr\nspacetime. Our result illustrates how BMS supertranslations can act as symmetry\ntransformations linking asymptotically flat black hole geometries, and that\nthey encode physically meaningful soft hair consistent with the multipole\nstructure of rotating black holes.

Existing approaches, however, have overlooked some crucial aspects of\nMLO, necessitating the development of a standards-compliant analytical\nframework to model the actual channel access mechanism of MLO. Therefore, this\npaper tries to fill the gap by proposing a set of novel Markov chains (MC) to\naccurately model the MLO operation aligned with multi-link backoff behaviors\nspecified by the standard.

Specifically, the semi-supervised\nframework with consistency effectively generates high-quality pseudo-labels,\nenlarging the labeled-dataset for model training. The ensemble learning-based\nalgorithm amalgamates the positioning coordinates from models trained under\ndifferent strategies, effectively combating the dynamic positioning\nenvironments. The decoupled mapping heads-based algorithm utilized sector\nrotation scheme to resolve the uneven-spaced anchor issue. Simulation results\ndemonstrate the superior performance of our proposed positioning algorithms\ncompared to existing benchmarks in terms of the {90%, 80%, 67%, 50%} percentile\nand mean distance error.",

Low-rank adaption (LoRA) is a widely\nused FT technique that only trains small-scale adapters and keeps the base\nmodel unaltered, conveying the possibility of processing multiple FT tasks by\njointly training different LoRA adapters with a shared base model.\n  Nevertheless, through in-depth analysis, we reveal the efficiency of joint FT\nis dampened by two heterogeneity issues in the training data -- the sequence\nlength variation and skewness. To tackle these issues, we develop LobRA, a\nbrand new framework that supports processing multiple FT tasks by jointly\ntraining LoRA adapters. Two innovative designs are introduced. Firstly, LobRA\ndeploys the FT replicas (i.e., model replicas for FT) with heterogeneous\nresource usages and parallel configurations, matching the diverse workloads\ncaused by the sequence length variation. Secondly, for each training step,\nLobRA takes account of the sequence length skewness and dispatches the training\ndata among the heterogeneous FT replicas to achieve workload balance.

Key innovations include\nan Edge Guided Compaction (EGC) branch with an Aggregated Semantic Filter (ASF)\nmodule to refine predictions near challenging object edges, and an Augmented\nMixup Sampling (AMS) training strategy integrating multi-source masks to\nsignificantly boost cross-domain robustness and zero-shot transferability.\nComprehensive experiments across 32 datasets derived from 6 sources demonstrate\nthat SegAssess achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance and exhibits\nremarkable zero-shot transferability to unseen masks, establishing PQM via\nSegAssess as a robust and transferable solution for unsupervised SQA.

To overcome these limitations, we propose Question to Knowledge\n(Q2K), a multi agent framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for\nreliable SKU mapping. Q2K integrates: (1) a Reasoning Agent that generates\ntargeted disambiguation questions, (2) a Knowledge Agent that resolves them via\nfocused web searches, and (3) a Deduplication Agent that reuses validated\nreasoning traces to reduce redundancy and ensure consistency. A human in the\nloop mechanism further refines uncertain cases. Experiments on real world\nconsumer goods datasets show that Q2K surpasses strong baselines, achieving\nhigher accuracy and robustness in difficult scenarios such as bundle\nidentification and brand origin disambiguation.

    "abstract": "In two-party secret sharing scheme, values are typically encoded as unsigned\nintegers $\\mathsf{uint}(x)$, whereas real-world applications often require\ncomputations on signed real numbers $\\mathsf{Real}(x)$. To enable secure\nevaluation of practical functions, it is essential to computing\n$\\mathsf{Real}(x)$ from shared inputs, as protocols take shares as input. At\nUSENIX'25, Guo et al. proposed an efficient method for computing signed integer\nvalues $\\mathsf{int}(x)$ from shares, which can be extended to compute\n$\\mathsf{Real}(x)$. However, their approach imposes a restrictive input\nconstraint $|x| < \\frac{L}{3}$ for $x \\in \\mathbb{Z}_L$, limiting its\napplicability in real-world scenarios. In this work, we significantly relax\nthis constraint to $|x| < B$ for any $B \\leq \\frac{L}{2}$, where $B =\n\\frac{L}{2}$ corresponding to the natural representable range in $x \\in\n\\mathbb{Z}_L$. This relaxes the restrictions and enables the computation of\n$\\mathsf{Real}(x)$ with loose or no input constraints. Building upon this\nfoundation, we present a generalized framework for designing secure protocols\nfor a broad class of functions, including integer division ($\\lfloor\n\\frac{x}{d} \\rfloor$), trigonometric ($\\sin(x)$) and exponential ($e^{-x}$)\nfunctions. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that the proposed protocols\nachieve both high efficiency and high accuracy. Notably, our protocol for\nevaluating $e^{-x}$ reduces communication costs to approximately 31% of those\nin SirNN (S&P 21) and Bolt (S&P 24), with runtime speedups of up to $5.53\n\\times$ and $3.09 \\times$, respectively.

    "abstract": "Reconstruction dynamic visual scenes from electroencephalography (EEG)\nsignals remains a primary challenge in brain decoding, limited by the low\nspatial resolution of EEG, a temporal mismatch between neural recordings and\nvideo dynamics, and the insufficient use of semantic information within brain\nactivity. Therefore, existing methods often inadequately resolve both the\ndynamic coherence and the complex semantic context of the perceived visual\nstimuli. To overcome these limitations, we introduce DynaMind, a novel\nframework that reconstructs video by jointly modeling neural dynamics and\nsemantic features via three core modules: a Regional-aware Semantic Mapper\n(RSM), a Temporal-aware Dynamic Aligner (TDA), and a Dual-Guidance Video\nReconstructor (DGVR). The RSM first utilizes a regional-aware encoder to\nextract multimodal semantic features from EEG signals across distinct brain\nregions, aggregating them into a unified diffusion prior. In the mean time, the\nTDA generates a dynamic latent sequence, or blueprint, to enforce temporal\nconsistency between the feature representations and the original neural\nrecordings. Together, guided by the semantic diffusion prior, the DGVR\ntranslates the temporal-aware blueprint into a high-fidelity video\nreconstruction. On the SEED-DV dataset, DynaMind sets a new state-of-the-art\n(SOTA), boosting reconstructed video accuracies (video- and frame-based) by\n12.5 and 10.3 percentage points, respectively. It also achieves a leap in\npixel-level quality, showing exceptional visual fidelity and temporal coherence\nwith a 9.4% SSIM improvement and a 19.7% FVMD reduction. This marks a critical\nadvancement, bridging the gap between neural dynamics and high-fidelity visual\nsemantics.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a machine learning framework for the early detection of\nrug pull scams on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) within The Open Network (TON)\nblockchain. TON's unique architecture, characterized by asynchronous execution\nand a massive web2 user base from Telegram, presents a novel and critical\nenvironment for fraud analysis. We conduct a comprehensive study on the two\nlargest TON DEXs, Ston.Fi and DeDust, fusing data from both platforms to train\nour models. A key contribution is the implementation and comparative analysis\nof two distinct rug pull definitions--TVL-based (a catastrophic liquidity\nwithdrawal) and idle-based (a sudden cessation of all trading activity)--within\na single, unified study. We demonstrate that Gradient Boosting models can\neffectively identify rug pulls within the first five minutes of trading, with\nthe TVL-based method achieving superior AUC (up to 0.891) while the idle-based\nmethod excels at recall. Our analysis reveals that while feature sets are\nconsistent across exchanges, their underlying distributions differ\nsignificantly, challenging straightforward data fusion and highlighting the\nneed for robust, platform-aware models. This work provides a crucial\nearly-warning mechanism for investors and enhances the security infrastructure\nof the rapidly growing TON DeFi ecosystem.",

However, the technology to capture these\nmetrics has historically been expensive, complex, and largely inaccessible to\namateur and recreational players. This paper addresses this gap in the context\nof badminton, one of the world's most popular sports, by introducing a novel,\ncost-effective, and user-friendly system for measuring smash speed using\nubiquitous smartphone technology. Our approach leverages a custom-trained\nYOLOv5 model for shuttlecock detection, combined with a Kalman filter for\nrobust trajectory tracking. By implementing a video-based kinematic speed\nestimation method with spatiotemporal scaling, the system automatically\ncalculates the shuttlecock's velocity from a standard video recording. The\nentire process is packaged into an intuitive mobile application, democratizing\naccess to high-level performance analytics and empowering players at all levels\nto analyze and improve their game.",

Despite the effectiveness, they have\noverlooked the potential noise in the labeled data, and mainly focus on\nstrategies to generate the reference prediction, while ignoring the\nheterogeneous values of different unlabeled pixels. We argue that effectively\nmining the rich information contained by the two predictions in the loss\nfunction, instead of the specific strategy to obtain a reference prediction, is\nmore essential for SSL, and propose a universal framework MetaSSL based on a\nspatially heterogeneous loss that assigns different weights to pixels by\nsimultaneously leveraging the uncertainty and consistency information between\nthe reference and supervised predictions. Specifically, we split the\npredictions on unlabeled data into four regions with decreasing weights in the\nloss: Unanimous and Confident (UC), Unanimous and Suspicious (US), Discrepant\nand Confident (DC), and Discrepant and Suspicious (DS), where an adaptive\nthreshold is proposed to distinguish confident predictions from suspicious\nones.

In this paper, we relax\nthese out-of-control assumptions and present a novel design that generalizes\nperformative prediction to nonlinear cases while preserving essential\ntheoretical properties. Specifically, we formulate the loss function of\nperformative prediction using a maximum margin approach and extend it to\nnonlinear spaces through kernel methods. To quantify the data distribution\nshift, we employ the discrepancy between prediction errors on these two\ndistributions as an indicator, which characterizes the impact of the\nperformative effect on specific learning tasks. By doing so, we can derive, for\nboth linear and nonlinear cases, the conditions for performative stability, a\ncritical and desirable property in performative contexts.

However, the current transfer learning model greatly\ndepends on the source domain and target domain data, which hinder the practical\napplication of emotion recognition. Therefore, we propose a Multi-domain\nAggregation Transfer Learning framework for EEG emotion recognition with\nDomain-Class prototype under unseen targets (MATL-DC). We design the feature\ndecoupling module to decouple class-invariant domain features from\ndomain-invariant class features from shallow features. In the model training\nstage, the multi-domain aggregation mechanism aggregates the domain feature\nspace to form a superdomain, which enhances the characteristics of emotional\nEEG signals. In each superdomain, we further extract the class prototype\nrepresentation by class features. In addition, we adopt the pairwise learning\nstrategy to transform the sample classification problem into the similarity\nproblem between sample pairs, which effectively alleviates the influence of\nlabel noise. It is worth noting that the target domain is completely unseen\nduring the training process. In the inference stage, we use the trained\ndomain-class prototypes for inference, and then realize emotion recognition. We\nrigorously validate it on the publicly available databases (SEED, SEED-IV and\nSEED-V). The results show that the accuracy of MATL-DC model is 84.70\\%,\n68.11\\% and 61.08\\%, respectively. MATL-DC achieves comparable or even better\nperformance than methods that rely on both source and target domains. The\nsource code is available at https://github.com/WuCB-BCI/MATL-DC.",

Alternatively,\nrecent work used a small dataset of real flash photographs to guarantee\nrealism, however such data is limited in scale and diversity. To address these\nlimitations, we propose RealMat, a diffusion-based material generator that\nleverages realistic priors, including a text-to-image model and a dataset of\nrealistic material photos under natural lighting. In RealMat, we first finetune\na pretrained Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL) with synthetic material maps arranged\nin $2 \\times 2$ grids. This way, our model inherits some realism of SDXL while\nlearning the data distribution of the synthetic material grids. Still, this\ncreates a realism gap, with some generated materials appearing synthetic. We\npropose to further finetune our model through reinforcement learning (RL),\nencouraging the generation of realistic materials.

Technically, spatial models and analysis methods grounded in a\nEuclidean representation of the geographical space have their capability to\nhandle the functional space of geographical phenomena restricted by the\ninherency of the symmetry axiom. In this study, we aim at differentiating and\ncharacterizing the spatial dependency and heterogeneity of asymmetric spatial\nseparations.

These include precise channel extrapolation,\nadaptability to varying scenarios, and manageable computational complexity\nduring both training and inference stages. In light of these requirements, we\nelaborate the potential and challenges of incorporating generative artificial\nintelligence (GAI)-based models for effective multi-domain channel\nextrapolation. Given the ability of the Transformer to capture long-range\ndependencies and hidden patterns, we propose a novel Transformer encoder-like\nmodel by eliminating the positional encoding module and replacing the original\nmulti-head attention with a multilayer perceptron (MLP) for multi-domain\nchannel extrapolation. Simulation results indicate that this model surpasses\nexisting baseline models in terms of extrapolation accuracy and inference\nspeed. Ablation studies further demonstrate the effectiveness of the module\ndesign of the proposed design. Finally, we pose several open questions for the\ndevelopment of practical GAI-based multi-domain channel extrapolation models,\nincluding the issues of explainability, generalization, and dataset collection.",

Real-world applications like public opinion monitoring and\nstock trading -- which have a strong attachment to social media -- demand\nmodels that are performant across diverse tasks and datasets. However, most\nexisting solutions are purely data-driven, exhibiting vulnerability to the\ninherent noise within social media data. Moreover, the reliance on\ntask-specific model design challenges efficient reuse of the same model\narchitecture on different tasks, incurring repetitive engineering efforts. To\naddress these challenges in social media graph analytics, we propose a general\nrepresentation learning framework that integrates a dual-encoder structure with\na kinetic-guided propagation module. In addition to jointly modeling structural\nand contextual information with two encoders, our framework innovatively\ncaptures the information propagation dynamics within social media graphs by\nintegrating principled kinetic knowledge. By deriving a propagation-aware\nencoder and corresponding optimization objective from a Markov chain-based\ntransmission model, the representation learning pipeline receives a boost in\nits robustness to noisy data and versatility in diverse tasks. Extensive\nexperiments verify that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance with\na unified architecture on a variety of social media graph mining tasks spanning\ngraph classification, node classification, and link prediction.

To address these challenges, we propose a novel\nframework called Goal-oriented Invariant Representation-based SC (SC-GIR) for\nimage transmission. Our framework leverages self-supervised learning to extract\nan invariant representation that encapsulates crucial information from the\nsource data, independent of the specific downstream task. This compressed\nrepresentation facilitates efficient communication while retaining key features\nfor successful downstream task execution. Focusing on machine-to-machine tasks,\nwe utilize covariance-based contrastive learning techniques to obtain a latent\nrepresentation that is both meaningful and semantically dense. To evaluate the\neffectiveness of the proposed scheme on downstream tasks, we apply it to\nvarious image datasets for lossy compression. The compressed representations\nare then used in a goal-oriented AI task. Extensive experiments on several\ndatasets demonstrate that SC-GIR outperforms baseline schemes by nearly 10%,,\nand achieves over 85% classification accuracy for compressed data under\ndifferent SNR conditions. These results underscore the effectiveness of the\nproposed framework in learning compact and informative latent representations.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we propose Ocior, a practical asynchronous Byzantine\nfault-tolerant (BFT) consensus protocol that achieves the optimal performance\nin resilience, communication, computation, and round complexity. Unlike\ntraditional BFT consensus protocols, Ocior processes incoming transactions\nindividually and concurrently using parallel instances of consensus. While\nleader-based consensus protocols rely on a designated leader to propose\ntransactions, Ocior is a leaderless consensus protocol that guarantees stable\nliveness. Ocior achieves: 1) Optimal resilience: Ocior tolerates up to $t$\nfaulty nodes controlled by an adaptive adversary, for $n\\geq 3t+1$. 2) Optimal\ncommunication complexity: The total expected communication per transaction is\n$O(n)$. 3) Optimal (or near-optimal) computation complexity: The total\ncomputation per transaction is $O(n)$ in the best case, or $O(n \\log^2 n)$ in\nthe worst case. 4) Optimal round complexity: A legitimate two-party transaction\ncan be finalized with a good-case latency of two asynchronous rounds, for any\n$n\\geq 3t+1$. The good case in terms of latency refers to the scenario where\nthe transaction is proposed by any (not necessarily designated) honest node. A\ntwo-party transaction involves the transfer of digital assets from one user (or\ngroup of users) to one or more recipients. To support efficient consensus, we\nintroduce a novel non-interactive threshold signature (TS) scheme called\nOciorBLSts. It offers fast signature aggregation, and is adaptively secure.\nOciorBLSts achieves a computation complexity of signature aggregation of only\n$O(n)$ in the good cases. Moreover, OciorBLSts supports the property of\nInstantaneous TS Aggregation. This enables real-time aggregation of partial\nsignatures as they arrive, reducing waiting time and improving responsiveness.",

    "abstract": "Effective and efficient tokenization plays an important role in image\nrepresentation and generation. Conventional methods, constrained by uniform\n2D/1D grid tokenization, are inflexible to represent regions with varying\nshapes and textures and at different locations, limiting their efficacy of\nfeature representation. In this work, we propose $\\textbf{GPSToken}$, a novel\n$\\textbf{G}$aussian $\\textbf{P}$arameterized $\\textbf{S}$patially-adaptive\n$\\textbf{Token}$ization framework, to achieve non-uniform image tokenization by\nleveraging parametric 2D Gaussians to dynamically model the shape, position,\nand textures of different image regions. We first employ an entropy-driven\nalgorithm to partition the image into texture-homogeneous regions of variable\nsizes. Then, we parameterize each region as a 2D Gaussian (mean for position,\ncovariance for shape) coupled with texture features. A specialized transformer\nis trained to optimize the Gaussian parameters, enabling continuous adaptation\nof position/shape and content-aware feature extraction. During decoding,\nGaussian parameterized tokens are reconstructed into 2D feature maps through a\ndifferentiable splatting-based renderer, bridging our adaptive tokenization\nwith standard decoders for end-to-end training. GPSToken disentangles spatial\nlayout (Gaussian parameters) from texture features to enable efficient\ntwo-stage generation: structural layout synthesis using lightweight networks,\nfollowed by structure-conditioned texture generation. Experiments demonstrate\nthe state-of-the-art performance of GPSToken, which achieves rFID and FID\nscores of 0.65 and 1.50 on image reconstruction and generation tasks using 128\ntokens, respectively.

    "abstract": "Layout-to-image (L2I) generation has exhibited promising results in natural\ndomains, but suffers from limited generative fidelity and weak alignment with\nuser-provided layouts when applied to degraded scenes (i.e., low-light,\nunderwater). We primarily attribute these limitations to the \"contextual\nillusion dilemma\" in degraded conditions, where foreground instances are\noverwhelmed by context-dominant frequency distributions. Motivated by this, our\npaper proposes a new Frequency-Inspired Contextual Disentanglement Generative\n(FICGen) paradigm, which seeks to transfer frequency knowledge of degraded\nimages into the latent diffusion space, thereby facilitating the rendering of\ndegraded instances and their surroundings via contextual frequency-aware\nguidance. To be specific, FICGen consists of two major steps. Firstly, we\nintroduce a learnable dual-query mechanism, each paired with a dedicated\nfrequency resampler, to extract contextual frequency prototypes from\npre-collected degraded exemplars in the training set. Secondly, a\nvisual-frequency enhanced attention is employed to inject frequency prototypes\ninto the degraded generation process. To alleviate the contextual illusion and\nattribute leakage, an instance coherence map is developed to regulate\nlatent-space disentanglement between individual instances and their\nsurroundings, coupled with an adaptive spatial-frequency aggregation module to\nreconstruct spatial-frequency mixed degraded representations. Extensive\nexperiments on 5 benchmarks involving a variety of degraded scenarios-from\nsevere low-light to mild blur-demonstrate that FICGen consistently surpasses\nexisting L2I methods in terms of generative fidelity, alignment and downstream\nauxiliary trainability.",

Equalizing the channel effect and\ntracking the phase noise necessitate dense pilot insertion. Direction-Shift\nKeying (DSK), a recent variant of Spatial Modulation (SM), addresses these\nchallenges by encoding information in the Direction-of-Arrival (DoA) using a\ndistributed antenna system (DAS), rather than relying on amplitude or phase.\nDSK has been shown to extend coherence time by up to four orders of magnitude.\nDespite its promise, existing DSK studies are largely simulation-based and\nlimited to simplified roadside unit scenarios and mobile device (MD) equipped\nwith only two antennas. DSK's performance in general settings, along with the\nfundamental laws governing its behavior, such as coherence time and resilience\nto phase noise, remain open problems. In this paper, we derive the structure of\nthe optimal detector for the case of $M$-antenna MD. Then, we establish the\ngoverning law for DSK's coherence time, termed the Direction Coherence Time\n(DCT), defining the the temporal duration over which the DoA remains\napproximately invariant. We analytically establish that DCT scales with $d/v$\n(transmitter-receiver distance over velocity), while the Channel Coherence Time\n(CCT) scales with $\\lambda/v$, revealing a coherence time gain on the order of\n$d/\\lambda$ (equivalent to more than four orders of magnitude.) Furthermore, we\nprove that DSK inherently cancels the phase noise, requiring no additional\ncompensation. Analytical predictions are validated through simulations,\nconfirming the robustness and scalability of DSK in high-frequency mobile\nenvironments.",

In all three settings, we prove that the $c\\to k$\naugmentation problem is NP-complete when $2\\leq c<k\\leq 5$.\n  However, the connectivity of the augmented graph $G'$ is at most $5$ if\n$\\mathcal{G}_2$ is limited to planar graphs. We initiate the study of the $c\\to\nk$ connectivity augmentation problem for arbitrary $k\\in \\mathbb{N}$, where\n$\\mathcal{G}_1$ is the class of planar graphs, plane graphs, or planar\nstraight-line graphs, and $\\mathcal{G}_2$ is a beyond-planar class of graphs:\n$\\ell$-planar, $\\ell$-plane topological, or $\\ell$-plane geometric graphs. We\nobtain tight bounds on the tradeoffs between the desired connectivity $k$ and\nthe local crossing number $\\ell$ of the augmented graph $G'$. We also show that\nour hardness results apply to this setting.\n  The connectivity augmentation problem for triangulations is intimately\nrelated to edge flips; and the minimum augmentation problem to the flip\ndistance between triangulations. We prove that it is NP-complete to find the\nminimum flip distance between a given triangulation and a 4-connected\ntriangulation, settling an open problem posed in 2014, and present an EPTAS for\nthis problem.",

    "abstract": "Video-based human pose estimation models aim to address scenarios that cannot\nbe effectively solved by static image models such as motion blur, out-of-focus\nand occlusion. Most existing approaches consist of two stages: detecting human\ninstances in each image frame and then using a temporal model for single-person\npose estimation. This approach separates the spatial and temporal dimensions\nand cannot capture the global spatio-temporal context between spatial instances\nfor end-to-end optimization. In addition, it relies on separate detectors and\ncomplex post-processing such as RoI cropping and NMS, which reduces the\ninference efficiency of the video scene. To address the above problems, we\npropose VEPE (Video End-to-End Pose Estimation), a simple and flexible\nframework for end-to-end pose estimation in video. The framework utilizes three\ncrucial spatio-temporal Transformer components: the Spatio-Temporal Pose\nEncoder (STPE), the Spatio-Temporal Deformable Memory Encoder (STDME), and the\nSpatio-Temporal Pose Decoder (STPD). These components are designed to\neffectively utilize temporal context for optimizing human body pose estimation.\nFurthermore, to reduce the mismatch problem during the cross-frame pose query\nmatching process, we propose an instance consistency mechanism, which aims to\nenhance the consistency and discrepancy of the cross-frame instance query and\nrealize the instance tracking function, which in turn accurately guides the\npose query to perform cross-frame matching. Extensive experiments on the\nPosetrack dataset show that our approach outperforms most two-stage models and\nimproves inference efficiency by 300%.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in\nleveraging extensive external knowledge to enhance responses in multi-turn and\nagentic applications, such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). However,\nprocessing long-context inputs introduces significant system latency and\ndemands substantial memory for the key-value cache, resulting in reduced\nthroughput and a fundamental trade-off between knowledge enrichment and system\nefficiency. While minimizing latency for long-context inputs is a primary\nobjective for LLMs, we contend that RAG require specialized consideration. In\nRAG, much of the LLM context consists of concatenated passages from retrieval,\nwith only a small subset directly relevant to the query. These passages often\nexhibit low semantic similarity due to diversity or deduplication during\nre-ranking, leading to block-diagonal attention patterns that differ from those\nin standard LLM generation tasks. Based on this observation, we argue that most\ncomputations over the RAG context during decoding are unnecessary and can be\neliminated with minimal impact on performance. To this end, we propose REFRAG,\nan efficient decoding framework that compresses, senses, and expands to improve\nlatency in RAG applications. By exploiting the sparsity structure, we\ndemonstrate a 30.85 the time-to-first-token acceleration (3.75 improvement to\nprevious work) without loss in perplexity. In addition, our optimization\nframework for large context enables REFRAG to extend the context size of LLMs\nby 16. We provide rigorous validation of REFRAG across diverse long-context\ntasks, including RAG, multi-turn conversations, and long document\nsummarization, spanning a wide range of datasets. Experimental results confirm\nthat REFRAG delivers substantial speedup with no loss in accuracy compared to\nLLaMA models and other state-of-the-art baselines across various context sizes.",

Parametric RAG (PRAG) addresses this by encoding\ndocuments as LoRA within LLMs, enabling reasoning without exposing raw content.\nHowever, it still faces two issues: (1) PRAG demands synthesizing QA pairs and\nfine-tuning LLM for each individual document to create its corresponding LoRA,\nleading to unacceptable inference latency.

In\nthis paper, we propose DistilledPRAG, a generalizable knowledge-distilled\nparametric RAG model aligned with standard RAG in document structure and\nparameter activation.

In this paper, we propose\nextracting serialized output prompts (SOP) and explicitly guiding the LLM using\nstructured prompts to improve system performance (SOP-MT-ASR). A Separator and\nserialized Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) layers are inserted\nafter the speech encoder to separate and extract MT content from the mixed\nspeech encoding in a first-speaking-first-out manner. Subsequently, the SOP,\nwhich serves as a prompt for LLMs, is obtained by decoding the serialized CTC\noutputs using greedy search. To train the model effectively, we design a\nthree-stage training strategy, consisting of serialized output training (SOT)\nfine-tuning, serialized speech information extraction, and SOP-based\nadaptation. Experimental results on the LibriMix dataset show that, although\nthe LLM-based SOT model performs well in the two-talker scenario, it fails to\nfully leverage LLMs under more complex conditions, such as the three-talker\nscenario.

To address this challenge, we propose a\nnovel physical law-corrected prior Gaussian process (LC-prior GP) surrogate\nmodeling framework that effectively integrates data-driven learning with\nunderlying physical constraints to flexibly handle multi-coupled variables\ndefined on complex geometries. The proposed approach leverages proper\northogonal decomposition (POD) to parameterize high-dimensional PDE solutions\nvia their dominant modes and associated coefficients, thereby enabling\nefficient Gaussian process (GP) surrogate modeling within a reduced-dimensional\ncoefficient space. A key contribution lies in the incorporation of physical\nlaws together with a limited number of parameter samples to correct the GP\nposterior mean, thus avoiding reliance on computationally expensive numerical\nsolvers. Furthermore, interpolation functions are constructed to describe the\nmapping from the full parameter space to the physics-based correction term.\nThis mapping is subsequently backpropagated to constrain the original GP\nsurrogate, yielding a more physically consistent conditional prior. To handle\nirregular geometries, the radial basis function-finite difference (RBF-FD)\nmethod is incorporated during training set computation, with its inherent\ndifferentiation matrices providing both computational efficiency and numerical\naccuracy for physical constraint optimization.

We validate this inverse-image construction by deriving a\ntractable convex reformulation and establishing rigorous statistical\nguarantees, including finite-sample performance and asymptotic consistency.\nCrucially, we demonstrate that, under mild conditions, noisy data may be a\n``blessing in disguise.\" Our noisy-data DRO model is less conservative than its\ndirect counterpart, leading to provably higher optimal values and a lower price\nof ambiguity.

A unified\nconditional diffusion process dynamically adapts to specific tasks via textual\nprompts, ensuring precise control over output quality. Trained on a curated\ndataset of 87,810 whole slied images (WSIs) across 34 tissue types and 5\nstaining protocols, LPFM demonstrates statistically significant improvements\n(p<0.01) over state-of-the-art methods in most tasks (56/66), achieving Peak\nSignal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) gains of 10-15% for image restoration and\nStructural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) improvements of 12-18% for virtual\nstaining.",

Such shifts encompass\n(i) variations in low level image statistics, (ii) changes in object pose and\nviewpoint, (iii) partial occlusion, and (iv) visual confusion across adjacent\nclasses. To mitigate this degradation, we introduce the Re-Thinking Vision\nLanguage Model (RT-VLM) framework. The foundation of this framework is a unique\nsynthetic dataset generation pipeline that produces images annotated with\n\"4-Clues\": precise bounding boxes, class names, detailed object-level captions,\nand a comprehensive context-level caption for the entire scene.

While it is commonly assumed that training on more historical data\nwould improve model performance and robustness, data distribution shifts over\ntime may undermine these benefits. This study examines how expanding historical\ndata training windows under covariate shifts (changes in feature distributions)\nand concept shifts (changes in feature-outcome relationships) affects the\nperformance and algorithmic fairness of predictive models. First, we perform a\nsimulation study to explore scenarios with varying degrees of covariate and\nconcept shifts in training data. Absent distribution shifts, we observe\nperformance gains from longer training windows though they reach a plateau\nquickly; in the presence of concept shift, performance may actually decline.\nCovariate shifts alone do not significantly affect model performance, but may\ncomplicate the impact of concept shifts. In terms of fairness, models produce\nmore biased predictions when the magnitude of concept shifts differs across\nsociodemographic groups; for intersectional groups, these effects are more\ncomplex and not simply additive. Second, we conduct an empirical case study of\nstudent retention prediction, a common machine learning application in\neducation, using 12 years of student records from 23 minority-serving community\ncolleges in the United States. We find concept shifts to be a key contributor\nto performance degradation when expanding the training window. Moreover, model\nfairness is compromised when marginalized populations have distinct data\ndistribution shift patterns from their peers.

Through neighbor-specific Q-learning, agents develop sophisticated\npartnership management strategies that enable cooperator cluster formation,\ncreating spatial separation between cooperative and defective regions. Using\npower-law networks that reflect real-world heterogeneous connectivity patterns,\nwe evaluate emergent behaviors under varying rewiring constraint levels,\nrevealing distinct cooperation patterns across parameter space rather than\nsharp thermodynamic transitions. Our systematic analysis identifies three\nbehavioral regimes: a permissive regime (low constraints) enabling rapid\ncooperative cluster formation, an intermediate regime with sensitive dependence\non dilemma strength, and a patient regime (high constraints) where strategic\naccumulation gradually optimizes network structure. Simulation results show\nthat while moderate constraints create transition-like zones that suppress\ncooperation, fully adaptive rewiring enhances cooperation levels through\nsystematic exploration of favorable network configurations.

    "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has demonstrated\nsuccess in enhancing LLM reasoning capabilities, but remains limited to\nsingle-turn interactions without tool integration. While recent Agentic\nReinforcement Learning with Tool use (ARLT) approaches have emerged to address\nmulti-turn tool interactions, existing works develop task-specific codebases\nthat suffer from fragmentation, synchronous execution bottlenecks, and limited\nextensibility across domains. These inefficiencies hinder broader community\nadoption and algorithmic innovation. We introduce VerlTool, a unified and\nmodular framework that addresses these limitations through systematic design\nprinciples. VerlTool provides four key contributions: (1) upstream alignment\nwith VeRL ensuring compatibility and simplified maintenance, (2) unified tool\nmanagement via standardized APIs supporting diverse modalities including code\nexecution, search, SQL databases, and vision processing, (3) asynchronous\nrollout execution achieving near 2$\\times$ speedup by eliminating\nsynchronization bottlenecks, and (4) comprehensive evaluation demonstrating\ncompetitive performance across 6 ARLT domains. Our framework formalizes ARLT as\nmulti-turn trajectories with multi-modal observation tokens (text/image/video),\nextending beyond single-turn RLVR paradigms. We train and evaluate models on\nmathematical reasoning, knowledge QA, SQL generation, visual reasoning, web\nsearch, and software engineering tasks, achieving results comparable to\nspecialized systems while providing unified training infrastructure. The\nmodular plugin architecture enables rapid tool integration requiring only\nlightweight Python definitions, significantly reducing development overhead and\nproviding a scalable foundation for tool-augmented RL research.

Using PDE techniques together with a policy iteration scheme, we\nprove that the HJB equation admits a unique strong solution, and this solution\ncoincides with the value function of the control problem. Based on this\nidentification, we establish a verification theorem and recover the Bellman\noptimality principle without imposing any additional smoothness assumptions.\n  We further investigate a mollification scheme depending on a parameter\n$\\varepsilon > 0$. It turns out that the smoothed value functions\n$V_{\\varepsilon}$ may fail to converge to the original value function $V$ as\n$\\varepsilon \\to 0$, and we provide an explicit counterexample.

We present MatPROV, a\ndataset of PROV-DM-compliant synthesis procedures extracted from scientific\nliterature using large language models. MatPROV captures structural\ncomplexities and causal relationships among materials, operations, and\nconditions through visually intuitive directed graphs. This representation\nenables machine-interpretable synthesis knowledge, opening opportunities for\nfuture research such as automated synthesis planning and optimization.",

    "abstract": "Financial returns are known to exhibit heavy tails, volatility clustering and\nabrupt jumps that are poorly captured by classical diffusion models. Advances\nin machine learning have enabled highly flexible functional forms for\nconditional means and volatilities, yet few models deliver interpretable\nstate--dependent tail risk, capture multiple forecast horizons and yield\ndistributions amenable to backtesting and execution. This paper proposes a\nneural L\\'evy jump--diffusion framework that jointly learns, as functions of\nobservable state variables, the conditional drift, diffusion, jump intensity\nand jump size distribution. We show how a single shared encoder yields multiple\nforecasting heads corresponding to distinct horizons (daily, weekly, etc.),\nfacilitating multi--horizon density forecasts and risk measures. The state\nvector includes conventional price and volume features as well as novel\ncomplexity measures such as permutation entropy and recurrence quantification\nanalysis determinism, which quantify predictability in the underlying process.\nEstimation is based on a quasi--maximum likelihood approach that separates\ndiffusion and jump contributions via bipower variation weights and incorporates\nmonotonicity and smoothness regularisation to ensure identifiability. A\ncost--aware portfolio optimiser translates the model's conditional densities\ninto implementable trading strategies under leverage, turnover and\nno--trade--band constraints. Extensive empirical analyses on cross--sectional\nequity data demonstrate improved calibration, sharper tail control and\neconomically significant risk reduction relative to baseline diffusive and\nGARCH benchmarks. The proposed framework is therefore an interpretable,\ntestable and practically deployable method for state--dependent risk and\ndensity forecasting.",

    "abstract": "We address in this paper a fundamental question that arises in mean-field\ngames (MFGs), namely whether mean-field equilibria (MFE) for discrete-time\nfinite-horizon MFGs can be used to obtain approximate stationary as well as\nnon-stationary MFE for similarly structured infinite-horizon MFGs. We provide a\nrigorous analysis of this relationship, and show that any accumulation point of\nMFE of a discounted finite-horizon MFG constitutes, under weak convergence as\nthe time horizon goes to infinity, a non-stationary MFE for the corresponding\ninfinite-horizon MFG. Further, under certain conditions, these non-stationary\nMFE converge to a stationary MFE, establishing the appealing result that\nfinite-horizon MFE can serve as approximations for stationary MFE.\nAdditionally, we establish improved contraction rates for iterative methods\nused to compute regularized MFE in finite-horizon settings, extending existing\nresults in the literature. As a byproduct, we obtain that when two MFGs have\nfinite-horizon MFE that are close to each other, the corresponding stationary\nMFE are also close. As one application of the theoretical results, we show that\nfinite-horizon MFGs can facilitate learning-based approaches to approximate\ninfinite-horizon MFE when system components are unknown. Under further\nassumptions on the Lipschitz coefficients of the regularized system components\n(which are stronger than contractivity of finite-horizon MFGs), we obtain\nexponentially decaying finite-time error bounds -- in the time horizon --\nbetween finite-horizon non-stationary, infinite-horizon non-stationary, and\nstationary MFE. As a byproduct of our error bounds, we present a new uniqueness\ncriterion for infinite-horizon nonstationary MFE beyond the available\ncontraction results in the literature.",

From these dynamics outputs, DynaProt achieves high accuracy in\npredicting residue-level flexibility (RMSF) and, remarkably, enables reasonable\nreconstruction of the full covariance matrix for fast ensemble generation.\nNotably, it does so using orders of magnitude fewer parameters than prior\nmethods.

    "abstract": "Noisy pursuit in complex environments drives emergent collective behaviors in\nactive matter systems. A compelling platform to study the impact of environment\ncues is provided by the standard Vicsek model for studying flocking and\nswarming phenomena. In this study, we explore the collective dynamics of Vicsek\nagents in a complex noise environment, featuring a noiseless circular region\n($\\eta_{\\text{c}} = 0.0$) surrounded by a noisy outer region ($\\eta_{\\text{b}}\n= 1.0$, tunable), with a mutually repelling interactions. By varying the outer\nnoise intensity, we observe an emergent rotational order ($\\phi_r$) that peaks\nat higher noise levels ($\\eta_{\\text{b}}\\sim 1$), as revealed by phase and\nsusceptibility plots. Global order follows ($\\phi$) follows a `U' shaped curve,\n$\\phi \\sim 0.965$ at $\\eta_b=0$, dies down to $\\phi \\sim 0.57$ at $\\eta_b=0.9$\nand re-enters at $\\eta_b > 1$ and peaks $\\phi \\sim 0.960$ at $\\eta_b=1.5$.

Higher particle velocities\nenhance escape rates ($\\kappa$) from the circular region, with slower-moving\nagents exhibiting greater virtual confinement. We quantify escape dynamics\nthrough time-averaged and first-passage escape rates, demonstrating\nvelocity-dependent retention on the probability of finding the bi-motility\nagent flocks at a give time resulting in segregation and trapping. Introducing\na gradual noise increase from the circle's center to the outer region reduces\nboth global ($\\phi$) and rotational ($\\phi_r$) order, underscoring the impact\nof environmental heterogeneity and sudden annealing over gradual change.

Most of existing\ndeep learning methods for neutralizing the effects of contaminated glasses\nrelied on synthetic training data. Few researchers used real degraded and clean\nimage pairs, but they only considered removing or alleviating the effects of\nrain drops on glasses. This paper is concerned with the more challenging task\nof learning the restoration of images taken through glasses contaminated by a\nwide range of occluders, including muddy water, dirt and other small foreign\nparticles found in reality. To facilitate the learning task we have gone to a\ngreat length to acquire real paired images with and without glass contaminants.\nMore importantly, we propose an all-in-one model to neutralize contaminants of\ndifferent types by utilizing the one-shot test-time adaptation mechanism. It\ninvolves a self-supervised auxiliary learning task to update the trained model\nfor the unique occlusion type of each test image.
