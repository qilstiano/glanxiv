    "abstract": "Deep learning models are often trained to approximate dynamical systems that\ncan be modeled using differential equations. Many of these models are optimized\nto predict one step ahead; such approaches produce calibrated one-step\npredictions if the predictive model can quantify uncertainty, such as Deep\nEnsembles. At inference time, multi-step predictions are generated via\nautoregression, which needs a sound uncertainty propagation method to produce\ncalibrated multi-step predictions. This work introduces an alternative\nPredictor-Corrector approach named \\hop{} that uses Modern Hopfield Networks\n(MHN) to learn the errors of a deterministic Predictor that approximates the\ndynamical system. The Corrector predicts a set of errors for the Predictor's\noutput based on a context state at any timestep during autoregression. The set\nof errors creates sharper and well-calibrated prediction intervals with higher\npredictive accuracy compared to baselines without uncertainty propagation. The\ncalibration and prediction performances are evaluated across a set of dynamical\nsystems. This work is also the first to benchmark existing uncertainty\npropagation methods based on calibration errors.",

Among the 402 outliers, the SDSS J2308 at\n$z=1.16$ is mainly considered, due to its SDSS spectrum observed around the\npeak brightness of the light curves. With the 7.2-year-long light curves\ndescribed by theoretical TDE model, the determined $T_{BB}$ and $R_{BB}$\nthrough its spectroscopic continuum emissions are consistent with the TDE model\ndetermined values, to support the central TDE. Moreover, considering simulated\nresults on continuum emissions of SDSS quasars around $z\\sim1.16$, confidence\nlevel higher than 4$\\sigma$ can be confirmed that the continuum emissions of\nSDSS J2308 are not related to normal quasars.

With the growing demand for high-quality imaging (\\textit{e.g.}, 4K and\n8K), achieving a balance between restoration quality and computational\nefficiency has become increasingly critical. Existing methods, primarily based\non CNNs, Transformers, or their hybrid approaches, apply uniform deep\nrepresentation extraction across the image. However, these methods often\nstruggle to effectively model long-range dependencies and largely overlook the\nspatial characteristics of image degradation (regions with richer textures tend\nto suffer more severe damage), making it hard to achieve the best trade-off\nbetween restoration quality and efficiency. To address these issues, we propose\na novel texture-aware image restoration method, TAMambaIR, which simultaneously\nperceives image textures and achieves a trade-off between performance and\nefficiency. Specifically, we introduce a novel Texture-Aware State Space Model,\nwhich enhances texture awareness and improves efficiency by modulating the\ntransition matrix of the state-space equation and focusing on regions with\ncomplex textures. Additionally, we design a {Multi-Directional Perception\nBlock} to improve multi-directional receptive fields while maintaining low\ncomputational overhead. Extensive experiments on benchmarks for image\nsuper-resolution, deraining, and low-light image enhancement demonstrate that\nTAMambaIR achieves state-of-the-art performance with significantly improved\nefficiency, establishing it as a robust and efficient framework for image\nrestoration.",

At variance with ordinary diffusive heat transport, this regime\nis primarily governed by momentum-conserving phonon collisions. At the\nmesoscopic scale it can be described by the viscous heat equations (VHE), that\nresemble the Navier-Stokes equations (NSE) in the laminar regime. Here, we show\nthat the VHE can be separated and recast as modified biharmonic equations in\nthe velocity potential and stream function$-$solvable analytically. These two\ncan be merged into a complex potential defining the flow streamlines, and give\nrise to two distinct temperature contributions, ultimately related to thermal\ncompressibility and vorticity. The irrotational and incompressible limits of\nthe phonon VHE are analyzed, showing how the latter mirrors the NSE for the\nelectron fluid. This work also extends to the electron compressible regime that\narises when drift velocities can be higher than plasmonic velocities. Finally,\nby examining thermal flow within a 2D graphite strip device, we explore the\nboundary conditions and transport coefficients needed to observe thermal\nvortices and negative thermal resistance, or heat backflow from cooler to\nwarmer regions.

Specifically, we consider a\nframework in which there is a relational database with information about the\ncandidates together with integrity constraints on the relational database\nextended with a virtual relation representing the committee. For an ABC scoring\nrule, the goal is to find a committee of maximum score such that all integrity\nconstraints hold in the extended database.\n  We focus on two well-known types of integrity constraints in relational\ndatabases: tuple-generating dependencies (TGDs) and denial constraints (DCs).\nThe former can express, for example, desired representations of groups, while\nthe latter can express conflicts among candidates. ABC voting is known to be\ncomputationally hard without integrity constraints, except for the case of\napproval voting where it is tractable. We show that integrity constraints make\nthe problem NP-hard for approval voting, but we also identify certain tractable\ncases when key constraints are used.

In this work, we\nshow that deep neural networks successfully replicate such complex loss\nlandscapes through spatio-temporal trajectory inputs. They also offer the\npotential to control the underlying complexity of these chaotic loss landscapes\nduring training through various regularization methods. We show that optimizing\non network-smoothened loss landscapes leads to improved convergence in\npredicting optimum inverse parameters over conventional momentum-based\noptimizers such as BFGS on multiple challenging problems.",

Tissue-equivalent\nscintillators, with millimeter-level spatial resolution and millisecond-level\ntemporal resolution, possess these required characteristics and show strong\npotential for use in UHDR dosimetry. Purpose: We investigated the performance\nof the HYPERSCINT RP-FLASH scintillator system at up to 1000 Hz sampling\nfrequency (fs) for UHDR electron beam dosimetry. Methods: The scintillator was\nexposed to CONV and UHDR electron irradiation using a LINAC-based FLASH\nplatform. Its spectral characteristics were delineated with a four-component\ncalibration, followed by a signal-to-dose calibration using 18 MeV CONV\nelectron beam. The dose linearity and dosimetric accuracy in response to CONV\nand UHDR irradiation at 1 and 1000 Hz fs were quantified against ion chamber\nand EBT-XD film measurements. The response of the scintillator system was\ninvestigated as a function of beam energy (6 and 18 MeV), field size (2x2 to\n25x25 cm2), dose per pulse (DPP, 0.8 to 2.3 Gy/pulse), and pulse repetition\nfrequency (PRF, 30 to 180 Hz). Relative signal sensitivity was quantified\nagainst accumulated dose to account for the scintillator's radiation\ndegradation. Pulse-resolved dose measurements at 18 MeV UHDR, obtained using\nthe scintillator with 1000 Hz fs for a train of 10 pulses at 180 Hz PRF, were\nvalidated with a PMT-fiber optic scattered radiation detector.",

In this work, we\napplied first principles computations to comprehensively investigate the defect\nlandscape of BaZrS3, including all intrinsic defects and a set of selected\nimpurities and dopants. BaZrS3 intrinsically exhibits n-type equilibrium\nconductivity under both S-poor and S-rich conditions, which remains largely\nunchanged in the presence of O and H impurities. La and Nb dopants created\nstable donor-type defects, which made BaZrS3 even more n-type, whereas As and P\ndopants formed amphoteric defects with relatively high formation energies. This\nwork highlights the difficulty of creating p-type BaZrS3 owing to the low\nformation energies of donor defects, both intrinsic and extrinsic. Defect\nformation energies were also used to compute expected defect concentrations and\nmake comparisons with experimentally reported values.

Our approach imposes the adapter to operate within\nthe subspace of the source base model. This constraint is necessary because our\nprior knowledge of the target model is limited to its weights, and the criteria\nfor ensuring the adapter's transferability are restricted to the target base\nmodel's weights and subspace.

We tested cross-validation (CV)\nstrategies - random splits, spatial blocking with varied distances,\nenvironmental (ENV) clustering, and a novel spatio-temporal method - under two\nproposed training schemes: LAST FOLD, widely used in spatial CV at the cost of\ndata loss, and RETRAIN, which maximizes data usage but risks reintroducing SAC.\nLAST FOLD consistently yielded lower errors and stronger correlations. Spatial\nblocking at an optimal distance (SP 422) and ENV performed best, achieving\nSpearman and Pearson correlations of 0.485 and 0.548, respectively, although\nENV may be unsuitable for long-term forecasts involving major environmental\nshifts. A spatio-temporal approach yielded modest benefits in our moderately\nvariable dataset, but may excel with stronger temporal changes. These findings\nhighlight the need to align CV approaches with the spatial and temporal\nstructure of SDM data, ensuring rigorous validation and reliable predictive\noutcomes.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a novel problem, distributional information embedding,\nmotivated by the practical demands of multi-bit watermarking for large language\nmodels (LLMs). Unlike traditional information embedding, which embeds\ninformation into a pre-existing host signal, LLM watermarking actively controls\nthe text generation process--adjusting the token distribution--to embed a\ndetectable signal. We develop an information-theoretic framework to analyze\nthis distributional information embedding problem, characterizing the\nfundamental trade-offs among three critical performance metrics: text quality,\ndetectability, and information rate. In the asymptotic regime, we demonstrate\nthat the maximum achievable rate with vanishing error corresponds to the\nentropy of the LLM's output distribution and increases with higher allowable\ndistortion. We also characterize the optimal watermarking scheme to achieve\nthis rate. Extending the analysis to the finite-token case with non-i.i.d.\ntokens, we identify schemes that maximize detection probability while adhering\nto constraints on false alarm and distortion.",

However, hardware limitations and expertise requirements constrain\nthe creation of such instructions. With recent developments in Generative\nArtificial Intelligence (Gen-AI), current research tries to tackle these\nconstraints by deploying AI-generated content (AIGC) in AR applications.\nHowever, our preliminary study with six AR practitioners revealed that the\ncurrent AIGC lacks contextual information to adapt to varying application\nscenarios and is therefore limited in authoring. To utilize the strong\ngenerative power of GenAI to ease the authoring of AR instruction while\ncapturing the context, we developed CARING-AI, an AR system to author\ncontext-aware humanoid-avatar-based instructions with GenAI. By navigating in\nthe environment, users naturally provide contextual information to generate\nhumanoid-avatar animation as AR instructions that blend in the context\nspatially and temporally. We showcased three application scenarios of\nCARING-AI: Asynchronous Instructions, Remote Instructions, and Ad Hoc\nInstructions based on a design space of AIGC in AR Instructions. With two user\nstudies (N=12), we assessed the system usability of CARING-AI and demonstrated\nthe easiness and effectiveness of authoring with Gen-AI.",

The Euclid mission aims at performing an extensive\nspectroscopic survey of approximately 20--30 million H$\\alpha$-emitting\ngalaxies up to about redshift two. This ambitious project seeks to elucidate\nthe nature of dark energy by mapping the 3-dimensional clustering of galaxies\nover a significant portion of the sky. This paper presents the methodology and\nsoftware developed for estimating the 3-dimensional 2-point correlation\nfunction within the Euclid Science Ground Segment. The software is designed to\novercome the significant challenges posed by the large and complex Euclid data\nset, which involves millions of galaxies. Key challenges include efficient pair\ncounting, managing computational resources, and ensuring the accuracy of the\ncorrelation function estimation. The software leverages advanced algorithms,\nincluding kd-tree, octree, and linked-list data partitioning strategies, to\noptimise the pair-counting process. The implementation also includes parallel\nprocessing capabilities using shared-memory open multi-processing to further\nenhance performance and reduce computation times. Extensive validation and\nperformance testing of the software are presented. The results indicate that\nthe software is robust and can reliably estimate the 2-point correlation\nfunction, which is essential for deriving cosmological parameters with high\nprecision. Furthermore, the paper discusses the expected performance of the\nsoftware during different stages of the Euclid Wide Survey observations and\nforecasts how the precision of the correlation function measurements will\nimprove over the mission's timeline, highlighting the software's capability to\nhandle large data sets efficiently.",

We report the discovery of two transiting brown dwarfs around\nlow-mass hosts using a combination of space- and ground-based photometry along\nwith near-infrared radial velocities. We characterize TOI-5389Ab\n($68.0^{+2.2}_{-2.2} \\ \\mj$) and TOI-5610b ($40.4^{+1.0}_{-1.0} \\ \\mj$), two\nmoderately massive brown dwarfs orbiting early M dwarf hosts ($\\teff = 3569 \\pm\n59 \\ K$ and $3618 \\pm 59 \\ K$, respectively). For TOI-5389Ab, the best fitting\nparameters are period $P=10.40046 \\pm 0.00002$ days, radius $R_{\\rm\nBD}=0.824^{+0.033}_{-0.031}$~\\rj, and low eccentricity\n$e=0.0962^{+0.0027}_{-0.0046}$. In particular, this constitutes one of the most\nextreme substellar-stellar companion-to-host mass ratios of $q=0.150$. For\nTOI-5610b, the best fitting parameters are period $P=7.95346 \\pm 0.00002$ days,\nradius $R_{\\rm BD}=0.887^{+0.031}_{-0.031}$ \\rj, and moderate eccentricity\n$e=0.354^{+0.011}_{-0.012}$. Both targets are expected to have shallow but\npotentially observable secondary transits: $\\lesssim 500$ ppm in Johnson K band\nfor both. A statistical analysis of M-dwarf/BD systems reveals for the first\ntime that those at short orbital periods ($P < 13$ days) exhibit a dearth of\n$13 \\mj < M_{\\rm BD} < 40 \\mj$ companions ($q$ $<$ 0.1) compared to those at\nslightly wider separations.",

    "abstract": "The increasing demand for higher data volume and faster transmission in\nmodern wireless telecommunication systems has elevated requirements for 5G\nhigh-band RF hardware. Spin-Wave technology offers a promising solution, but\nits adoption is hindered by significant insertion loss stemming from the low\nefficiency of magnonic transducers. This work introduces a micromagnetic\nsimulation method for directly computing the spin-wave resistance, the real\npart of spin-wave impedance, which is crucial for optimizing magnonic\ntransducers. By integrating into finite-difference micromagnetic simulations,\nthis approach extends analytical models to arbitrary transducer geometries. We\ndemonstrate its effectiveness through parameter studies on transducer design\nand waveguide properties, identifying key strategies to enhance the overall\ntransducer efficiency. Our studies show that by varying single parameters of\nthe transducer geometry or the YIG thickness, the spin-wave efficiency, the\nparameter describing the efficiency of the transfer of electromagnetic energy\nto the spin wave, can reach values up to 0.75. The developed numerical model\nallows further fine-tuning of the transducers to achieve even higher\nefficiencies.",

    "abstract": "Human motion generation has advanced markedly with the advent of diffusion\nmodels. Most recent studies have concentrated on generating motion sequences\nbased on text prompts, commonly referred to as text-to-motion generation.\nHowever, the bidirectional generation of motion and text, enabling tasks such\nas motion-to-text alongside text-to-motion, has been largely unexplored. This\ncapability is essential for aligning diverse modalities and supports\nunconditional generation. In this paper, we introduce PackDiT, the first\ndiffusion-based generative model capable of performing various tasks\nsimultaneously, including motion generation, motion prediction, text\ngeneration, text-to-motion, motion-to-text, and joint motion-text generation.\nOur core innovation leverages mutual blocks to integrate multiple diffusion\ntransformers (DiTs) across different modalities seamlessly. We train PackDiT on\nthe HumanML3D dataset, achieving state-of-the-art text-to-motion performance\nwith an FID score of 0.106, along with superior results in motion prediction\nand in-between tasks. Our experiments further demonstrate that diffusion models\nare effective for motion-to-text generation, achieving performance comparable\nto that of autoregressive models.",

Since these\nprobabilities are unknown, a key question is how to address situations in which\ndifferent models trained on the same dataset produce varying predictions for\ncertain individuals. This issue is exemplified by the model multiplicity (MM)\nphenomenon, where a set of comparable models yield inconsistent predictions.\nRoth, Tolbert, and Weinstein recently introduced a reconciliation procedure,\nthe Reconcile algorithm, to address this problem. Given two disagreeing models,\nthe algorithm leverages their disagreement to falsify and improve at least one\nof the models. In this paper, we empirically analyze the Reconcile algorithm\nusing five widely-used fairness datasets: COMPAS, Communities and Crime, Adult,\nStatlog (German Credit Data), and the ACS Dataset. We examine how Reconcile\nfits within the model multiplicity literature and compare it to existing MM\nsolutions, demonstrating its effectiveness. We also discuss potential\nimprovements to the Reconcile algorithm theoretically and practically. Finally,\nwe extend the Reconcile algorithm to the setting of causal inference, given\nthat different competing estimators can again disagree on specific causal\naverage treatment effect (CATE) values. We present the first extension of the\nReconcile algorithm in causal inference, analyze its theoretical properties,\nand conduct empirical tests.

Recent advances have enabled large language models (LLMs) to\nincorporate auditory systems for handling various speech-related tasks.\nHowever, most audio LLMs remain unaware of the quality of the speech they\nprocess. This limitation arises because speech quality evaluation is typically\nexcluded from multi-task training due to the lack of suitable datasets. To\naddress this, we introduce the first natural language-based speech evaluation\ncorpus, generated from authentic human ratings. In addition to the overall Mean\nOpinion Score (MOS), this corpus offers detailed analysis across multiple\ndimensions and identifies causes of quality degradation. It also enables\ndescriptive comparisons between two speech samples (A/B tests) with human-like\njudgment. Leveraging this corpus, we propose an alignment approach with LLM\ndistillation (ALLD) to guide the audio LLM in extracting relevant information\nfrom raw speech and generating meaningful responses. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that ALLD outperforms the previous state-of-the-art regression\nmodel in MOS prediction, with a mean square error of 0.17 and an A/B test\naccuracy of 98.6%. Additionally, the generated responses achieve BLEU scores of\n25.8 and 30.2 on two tasks, surpassing the capabilities of task-specific\nmodels.

Much of this debate has concentrated on direct impacts --\nenergy and water usage in data centers, e-waste from frequent hardware upgrades\n-- without addressing the significant indirect effects. This paper examines how\nthe problem of Jevons' Paradox applies to AI, whereby efficiency gains may\nparadoxically spur increased consumption. We argue that understanding these\nsecond-order impacts requires an interdisciplinary approach, combining\nlifecycle assessments with socio-economic analyses. Rebound effects undermine\nthe assumption that improved technical efficiency alone will ensure net\nreductions in environmental harm. Instead, the trajectory of AI's impact also\nhinges on business incentives and market logics, governance and policymaking,\nand broader social and cultural norms. We contend that a narrow focus on direct\nemissions misrepresents AI's true climate footprint, limiting the scope for\nmeaningful interventions. We conclude with recommendations that address rebound\neffects and challenge the market-driven imperatives fueling uncontrolled AI\ngrowth. By broadening the analysis to include both direct and indirect\nconsequences, we aim to inform a more comprehensive, evidence-based dialogue on\nAI's role in the climate crisis.",

    "abstract": "Behavior cloning has shown success in many sequential decision-making tasks\nby learning from expert demonstrations, yet they can be very sample inefficient\nand fail to generalize to unseen scenarios. One approach to these problems is\nto introduce general domain knowledge, such that the policy can focus on the\nessential features and may generalize to unseen states by applying that\nknowledge. Although this knowledge is easy to acquire from the experts, it is\nhard to be combined with learning from individual examples due to the lack of\nsemantic structure in neural networks and the time-consuming nature of feature\nengineering. To enable learning from both general knowledge and specific\ndemonstration trajectories, we use a large language model's coding capability\nto instantiate a policy structure based on expert domain knowledge expressed in\nnatural language and tune the parameters in the policy with demonstrations. We\nname this approach the Knowledge Informed Model (KIM) as the structure reflects\nthe semantics of expert knowledge. In our experiments with lunar lander and car\nracing tasks, our approach learns to solve the tasks with as few as 5\ndemonstrations and is robust to action noise, outperforming the baseline model\nwithout domain knowledge. This indicates that with the help of large language\nmodels, we can incorporate domain knowledge into the structure of the policy,\nincreasing sample efficiency for behavior cloning.",

In marine environments,\nthis phenomenon has drawn considerable attention due to its role in releasing\nbiochemical contaminants, such as extracellular polymeric substances, into the\natmosphere through aerosol production. These biocontaminants often exhibit\nnon-Newtonian characteristics, yet the physics of bubble bursting with a\nrheologically complex layer at bubble-liquid interfaces remains largely\nunexplored. In this study, we experimentally investigate the jetting dynamics\nof bubble bursting events in the presence of such polymeric compound layers.\nUsing bubbles coated by a polyethylene oxide solution, we document the cavity\ncollapse and jetting dynamics produced by bubble bursting. At a fixed polymer\nconcentration, the jet velocity increases while the jet radius decreases with\nan increasing compound layer fraction, as a result of stronger capillary wave\ndamping due to capillary wave separation at the compound interface as well as\nthe formation of smaller cavity cone angles during bubble cavity collapse.\nThese dynamics produce smaller and more numerous jet drops. Meanwhile, as the\npolymer concentration increases, the jet velocity decreases while the jet\nradius increases for the same compound layer fraction due to the increasing\nviscoelastic stresses. In addition, fewer jet drops are ejected as the jets\nbecome slower and broader with increasing polymer concentration, as\nviscoelastic stresses persist throughout the jet formation and thinning\nprocess. We further obtain a regime map delineating the conditions for jet drop\nejection versus no jet drop ejection in bursting bubbles coated with a\npolymeric compound layer.

The\ncoupling methodology, termed as synchronized step correlation enhancement\n(SYNCE), is inspired by the concept of using common random numbers in Markov\nchain Monte Carlo sampling. This methodology is shown to be more efficient and\ncost-effective than existing couplings in the literature. This improvement is\nachieved because SYNCE leads to higher correlation of samples obtained from\nlevel dependent posteriors than previous works. SYNCE is especially effective\nat coarse levels of the hierarchy where posteriors differ significantly from\neach other, resulting in orders of magnitude improvement in variance reduction.\nWe first demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methodology by comparing\nit with existing algorithms on two simple examples taken from the literature.\nWe then apply our methodology to a more complex example in the context of\nuncertainty quantification in subsurface flow simulations.",

Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are\nwidely used to provide these insights while maintaining chemical specificity.\nHowever, the boundary conditions that can be applied in MD fracture simulations\nare limited to the linear-elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) far-field solution,\nposing restrictions in simulating bending or shearing deformations commonly\napplied in classical experimental setups. This has to date prevented the\naccurate and precise prediction of key fracture quantities such as critical\nstress intensity factors. To overcome these limitations, we here apply the\ndomain-decomposition Capriccio method to couple atomistic MD samples\nrepresenting silica glass synthesized at various quenching rates with the\nfinite element (FE) method and perform both mode I (tension, three- and\nfour-point bending) and mode III simulations at different loading rates. We\ninvestigate multiple criteria to best identify the onset of crack propagation\nbased on the virial stress, the number of pair interactions, the kinetic\nenergy/temperature, the crack velocity, and the crack opening displacement.\nBased on this, we propose a novel protocol that allows us to determine the\nfracture toughness of silica glass under mode I and III conditions from\natomistic data with increased fidelity, with our results being in good\nagreement with experimental data and predictions from LEFM.

We observe that alignment\nembeds a safety classifier in the target model that is responsible for deciding\nbetween refusal and compliance. We seek to extract an approximation of this\nclassifier, called a surrogate classifier, from the LLM. We develop an\nalgorithm for identifying candidate classifiers from subsets of the LLM model.\nWe evaluate the degree to which the candidate classifiers approximate the\nmodel's embedded classifier in benign (F1 score) and adversarial (using\nsurrogates in a white-box attack) settings. Our evaluation shows that the best\ncandidates achieve accurate agreement (an F1 score above 80%) using as little\nas 20% of the model architecture. Further, we find attacks mounted on the\nsurrogate models can be transferred with high accuracy. For example, a\nsurrogate using only 50% of the Llama 2 model achieved an attack success rate\n(ASR) of 70%, a substantial improvement over attacking the LLM directly, where\nwe only observed a 22% ASR.

    "abstract": "Due to rich rheological properties, dispersions of attractive colloidal\nparticles are ubiquitous in industries. Specifically, upon experiencing a\nsudden reduction in shear rate, these dispersions may exhibit transient\nbehaviors such as thixotropy-where viscosity increases over time-and\nanti-thixotropy, characterized by an initial viscosity decrease before reaching\na steady state. While thixotropy has been described as a competition between\nstructure buildup and disruption, the mechanisms of anti-thixotropy remain\npoorly understood. Here, we investigate the anti-thixotropic dynamics of carbon\nblack particles dispersed in oil-a system known for exhibiting\nanti-thixotropy-through flow step-down experiments. Using a multi-technique\napproach combining rheology with velocimetry and structural characterizations,\nwe show that viscosity decrease results from a decrease in wall slip\nconcomitant to shear-induced structural rearrangements, indicating a transition\nfrom a dynamical network of fractal clusters into a network of loosely\nconnected dense agglomerates. Additionally, after a characteristic\nanti-thixotropic time $\\tau$, a steady flow is reached. This time $\\tau$\ndiverges with increasing shear rate at a critical value corresponding to a\nMason number of one, indicating that anti-thixotropy occurs only when colloidal\nattraction outweighs viscous forces. More precisely, we show that the\nstructural rearrangement underpinning the viscosity decrease is mediated by\nelastic stresses $\\sigma_e$, such that $\\tau \\propto \\sigma_e^{-3}$. Finally,\non long time scales, the steady state is linked to a microstructure with nearly\nzero yield stress, indicating a loss of flow memory. These findings provide a\nmechanism for anti-thixotropy and suggest pathways for controlling viscosity\nand yield stress in attractive colloidal dispersions.",

    "abstract": "When choosing a deformable image registration (DIR) approach for images with\nlarge deformations and content mismatch, the realism of found transformations\noften needs to be traded off against the required runtime. DIR approaches using\ndeep learning (DL) techniques have shown remarkable promise in instantly\npredicting a transformation. However, on difficult registration problems, the\nrealism of these transformations can fall short. DIR approaches using\nbiomechanical, finite element modeling (FEM) techniques can find more realistic\ntransformations, but tend to require much longer runtimes. This work proposes\nthe first hybrid approach to combine them, with the aim of getting the best of\nboth worlds. This hybrid approach, called DL-MOREA, combines a recently\nintroduced multi-objective DL-based DIR approach which leverages the VoxelMorph\nframework, called DL-MODIR, with MOREA, an evolutionary algorithm-based,\nmulti-objective DIR approach in which a FEM-like biomechanical mesh\ntransformation model is used. In our proposed hybrid approach, the DL results\nare used to smartly initialize MOREA, with the aim of more efficiently\noptimizing its mesh transformation model. We empirically compare DL-MOREA\nagainst its components, DL-MODIR and MOREA, on CT scan pairs capturing large\nbladder filling differences of 15 cervical cancer patients. While MOREA\nrequires a median runtime of 45 minutes, DL-MOREA can already find high-quality\ntransformations after 5 minutes. Compared to the DL-MODIR transformations, the\ntransformations found by DL-MOREA exhibit far less folding and improve or\npreserve the bladder contour distance error.",

Recent observations reveal\ncontingent factors often drive cooperative interactions, with the intensity\nheterogeneously distributed within species. While cooperation has beneficial\noutcomes, it may also incur significant costs, largely depending on species\ndensity. This creates a dilemma that is pivotal in shaping sustainable\ncooperation strategies. Understanding how cooperation intensity governs the\ncost-benefit balance, and whether an optimal strategy exists for species\nsurvival, is a fundamental question in ecological research, and the focus of\nthis study. We develop a novel mathematical model within the Lotka-Volterra\nframework to explore the dynamics of cost-associated partial cooperation, which\nremains relatively unexplored in ODE model-based studies. Our findings\ndemonstrate that partial cooperation benefits ecosystems up to a certain\nintensity, beyond which costs become dominant, leading to system collapse via\nheteroclinic bifurcation. This outcome captures the cost-cooperation dilemma,\nproviding insights for adopting sustainable strategies and resource management\nfor species survival. We propose a novel mathematical approach to detect and\ntrack heteroclinic orbits in predator-prey systems. Moreover, we show that\nintroducing fear of predation can protect the regime shift, even with a type-I\nfunctional response, challenging traditional ecological views. Although fear is\nknown to resolve the \"paradox of enrichment,\" our results suggest that certain\nlevels of partial cooperation can reestablish this dynamic even at higher fear\nintensity.

    "abstract": "Superlattice engineering is a powerful way to tune the transport properties\nof a material. In this work we show that magnetotransport can be modified by\nsuperlattices in 3D materials based on the relative symmetry between the\nFermi-surface and superlattice. We demonstrate commensuration oscillations in\nthe ballistic transport regime of a nanostructured 3D material with the Weyl\nsemimetal NbP, a signature typically limited to superlattices in 2D materials.\nThe behavior of the oscillations encodes information about the shared\nproperties between the quasiparticles at the Fermi-surface--including their\nmomentum, charge, mass, and rotational symmetry--and the structure of the\nsuperlattice. The magnetic field and temperature dependence of the\ncommensuration oscillations enables us to extract the Fermi-momenta and\nquasiparticle mass at an order of magnitude lower magnetic field and higher\ntemperature than Shubnikov-de Haas quantum oscillations. Furthermore, we use a\nchiral superlattice to engineer asymmetric longitudinal magnetoresistance based\non the charge of the quasiparticles and superlattice enantiomer. These results\ndemonstrate nanopatterned superlattices as an effective method for fermiology,\nand also point towards new ways of engineering quantum transport in these\nsystems based on the mutual properties of the superlattice and Fermi-surface.",

    "abstract": "The rapid development of large language models (LLMs) has necessitated the\ncreation of benchmarks to evaluate their performance. These benchmarks resemble\nhuman tests and surveys, as they consist of sets of questions designed to\nmeasure emergent properties in the cognitive behavior of these systems.\nHowever, unlike the well-defined traits and abilities studied in social\nsciences, the properties measured by these benchmarks are often vaguer and less\nrigorously defined. The most prominent benchmarks are often grouped into\nleaderboards for convenience, aggregating performance metrics and enabling\ncomparisons between models. Unfortunately, these leaderboards typically rely on\nsimplistic aggregation methods, such as taking the average score across\nbenchmarks. In this paper, we demonstrate the advantages of applying\ncontemporary psychometric methodologies - originally developed for human tests\nand surveys - to improve the ranking of large language models on leaderboards.\nUsing data from the Hugging Face Leaderboard as an example, we compare the\nresults of the conventional naive ranking approach with a psychometrically\ninformed ranking. The findings highlight the benefits of adopting psychometric\ntechniques for more robust and meaningful evaluation of LLM performance.",

    "abstract": "This paper examines the state of affairs on Frontier Safety Policies in light\nof capability progress and growing expectations held by government actors and\nAI safety researchers from these safety policies. It subsequently argues that\nFSPs should evolve to a more granular version, which this paper calls FSPs\nPlus. Compared to the first wave of FSPs led by a subset of frontier AI\ncompanies, FSPs Plus should be built around two main pillars. First, FSPs Plus\nshould adopt precursory capabilities as a new, clearer, and more comprehensive\nset of metrics. In this respect, this paper recommends that international or\ndomestic standardization bodies develop a standardized taxonomy of precursory\ncomponents to high-impact capabilities that FSPs Plus could then adopt by\nreference.

In this work, we\ndemonstrate both optical and electrical tunability of the band structure in the\n3D Dirac semimetal Cd3As2. Photoexcitation with circularly polarized light\nbreaks time-reversal symmetry, lifting the degeneracy at Dirac points to\ntransform the material into a Floquet Weyl semimetal with chiral Weyl nodes.\nThis transition induces nonzero Berry curvature, giving rise to\nhelicity-dependent transverse anomalous photocurrents, detectable through\nterahertz emission at normal incidence. Furthermore, applying an external\nelectric field displaces the Fermi level away from the Dirac point, enlarging\nthe Dirac cone projection leading to a reduced density of states of Fermi arcs.\nAs a result, we achieve precise electrical control over Floquet band\nengineering, resulting in a large modulation of THz emission. Moreover, at\noblique incidence, the circular photon-drag effect induces helicity-dependent\nlongitudinal photocurrents. Simultaneous generation and manipulation of both\nlongitudinal and transverse photocurrents enable precise control of the\nhelicity of emitted THz pulses. These results pave the way for electric\nfield-controlled Floquet Weyl THz sources, offering significant potential for\napplications in quantum computing and low-power electronics.",

Our investigation\nreveals profound insights into large-scale cosmic flows and their interactions\nwith major cosmic structures, such as the Sloan Great Wall (SGW) and the King\nGhidorah Supercluster (KGSc). We find that incorporating neutrinos into the\nperturbed $f(R)$ gravity model results in a substantial increase in bulk flow\nvelocities across all redshifts, with notable enhancements in the higher\nredshift ranges, where velocities can exceed $3000 \\, \\mathrm{km/s}$ in the\n$0.8 < z < 1.4$ range. Moreover, the direction of the bulk flow in this model\nclosely aligns with the dark energy dipole, especially at redshifts $z > 0.4$,\nshowing near-perfect congruence with cosmic superclusters. This suggests a\nsignificant interaction between neutrinos and cosmic structures, influencing\ncosmic acceleration. At lower redshifts, such as $0.1 < z < 0.2$, the bulk flow\naligns with the SGW, while in the $0.4 < z < 0.6$ range, it aligns with the\nKGSc. In the low redshift range $0.001 < z < 0.016$, although velocities are\nlower, neutrinos still subtly increase the bulk flow velocity and maintain\nalignment with nearby cosmic structures, like the Local Supercluster. Our\nresults underscore the critical role of neutrinos in shaping cosmic flows and\noffer new insights into the interplay between dark energy, neutrinos, and\nmodified gravity models.",

However, ensuring\ntheir availability and security requires advanced operational control and\nsafety measures. Although artificial intelligence and machine learning can help\nassess grid stability, challenges such as data scarcity and cybersecurity\nthreats, particularly adversarial attacks, remain. Data scarcity is a major\nissue, as obtaining real-world instances of grid instability requires\nsignificant expertise, resources, and time. Yet, these instances are critical\nfor testing new research advancements and security mitigations. This paper\nintroduces a novel framework for detecting instability in smart grids using\nonly stable data. It employs a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) where the\ngenerator is designed not to produce near-realistic data but instead to\ngenerate Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) samples with respect to the stable class.\nThese OOD samples represent unstable behavior, anomalies, or disturbances that\ndeviate from the stable data distribution. By training exclusively on stable\ndata and exposing the discriminator to OOD samples, our framework learns a\nrobust decision boundary to distinguish stable conditions from any unstable\nbehavior, without requiring unstable data during training. Furthermore, we\nincorporate an adversarial training layer to enhance resilience against\nattacks. Evaluated on a real-world dataset, our solution achieves up to 98.1\\%\naccuracy in predicting grid stability and 98.9\\% in detecting adversarial\nattacks.

    "abstract": "We report observations of eight Jovian irregular satellites with JWST's\nNIRSpec instrument: Himalia, Elara, Pasiphae, Sinope, Lysithea, Carme, Ananke,\nand Themisto. Irregular satellite families, which are presumed to have formed\nvia collisions, contain various Trojan-like and C-type-asteroid-like surfaces.\nWe sample the three largest members of the Himalia satellite family, detecting\nthe presence of complexed CO$_2$ and a unique absorption band from\n$\\sim2.7-3.6\\ \\mu m$ whose character correlates with satellite size. The two\nlargest irregular satellites, Himalia family members Himalia and Elara, contain\nammoniated phyllosilicates that are not seen in the meteorite inventory. We\npropose that the Himalia parent body was heterogeneous and formed with\nmaterials similar to Ceres-like ammonium-bearing asteroids. Several small\n($D\\sim 10km$) irregular satellites closely track the colors and absorption\nbands of ``red'' Jovian Trojans, demonstrating that these compositions are\nretained amongst the products of collisions that occurred after Jovian capture.\nWe report the first detection of aqueous alteration products in the retrograde\nsatellite swarm, finding Ananke's 3 micron band to closely match\nphyllosilicates seen in C2 chondrites. Notably, objects with OH absorption\nfeatures similar to the Trojan asteroid Eurybates are found in both the\nretrograde Pasiphae family and the prograde Himalia family, confounding a\nsimple link between such materials and a single surface type. The irregular\nsatellites appear consistent with some materials that experienced alteration\nfrom liquid water and others that did not. Consequently, Jupiter may have\ncaptured bodies that formed from different initial compositions, or bodies that\nexperienced different levels of heating, driving differential alteration\nprocesses.",

Their parton showers are significantly\naltered if they develop inside of a deconfined medium. Hadronization of jets is\nalso thought to be affected by the presence of quarks and gluons. We present a\nsystematic study of the effects of a thermal bath of partons on the\nhadronization of parton showers. We use the JETSCAPE framework to create parton\nshowers both in vacuum and in a brick of quark gluon plasma. The brick setup\nallows important parameters, like the size of the plasma as well as the\ncollective flow of partons, to be varied systematically. We hadronize the\nparton showers using Hybrid Hadronization, which permits shower partons to form\nstrings with thermal partons, or to recombine directly with thermal partons as\nwell as with each other. We find a sizeable amount of interaction of shower\npartons with thermal partons during hadronization, indicating a natural\ncontinuation of the interaction of jet and medium during this stage. The\nobserved effects grow with the size of the medium. Collective flow easily\ntransfers from the thermal partons onto the emerging jet hadrons. We also see a\nsignificant change in hadron chemistry as expected in the presence of quark\nrecombination processes.",

In this study,\nwe examine the more restrictive setting where retrograde communication from\nneuronal outputs is unavailable for pre-synaptic weight optimisation. To\naddress this challenge, we propose Forward Projection (FP). This novel\nrandomised closed-form training method requires only a single forward pass over\nthe entire dataset for model fitting, without retrograde communication. Target\nvalues for pre-activation membrane potentials are generated layer-wise via\nnonlinear projections of pre-synaptic inputs and the labels. Local loss\nfunctions are optimised over pre-synaptic inputs using closed-form regression,\nwithout feedback from neuronal outputs or downstream layers. Interpretability\nis a key advantage of FP training; membrane potentials of hidden neurons in\nFP-trained networks encode information which is interpretable layer-wise as\nlabel predictions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of FP across four\nbiomedical datasets. In few-shot learning tasks, FP yielded more generalisable\nmodels than those optimised via backpropagation. In large-sample tasks,\nFP-based models achieve generalisation comparable to gradient descent-based\nlocal learning methods while requiring only a single forward propagation step,\nachieving significant speed up for training.

However, there is a long-standing debate as to whether that\ncollapse is local, involving only a small fraction of the cloud mass, or\nglobal, with most mass in a state of collapse up to the moment when it is\ndispersed by stellar feedback. In principle it is possible to distinguish these\npossibilities from clouds' virial ratios, which should be a factor of two\nlarger for collapse than for equilibrium, but systematic uncertainties have\nthus far prevented such measurements. Here we propose a new analysis method to\novercome this limitation: while the absolute value of a cloud's virial ratio is\ntoo uncertain to distinguish global from local collapse, the differential\nchange in virial ratio as a function of surface density is also diagnostic of\nclouds' dynamical state, and can be measured with far fewer systematic\nuncertainties. We demonstrate the basic principles of the method using simple\nanalytic models of supported and collapsing clouds, validate it from full 3D\nsimulations, and discuss possible challenges in applying the method to real\ndata. We then provide a preliminary application of the technique to recent\nobservations of the molecular clouds in Andromeda, showing that most of them\nare inconsistent with being in a state of global collapse.",

This limits their utility for brain\ncomputer interfaces (BCI) or neurofeedback, for which it would be useful to\npool experiences across individuals to better simulate stimuli not sampled\nduring training. A key obstacle to model generalisation is the degree of\nvariability of inter-subject cortical organisation, which makes it difficult to\nalign or compare cortical signals across participants. In this paper we address\nthis through the use of surface vision transformers, which build a\ngeneralisable model of cortical functional dynamics, through encoding the\ntopography of cortical networks and their interactions as a moving image across\na surface. This is then combined with tri-modal self-supervised contrastive\n(CLIP) alignment of audio, video, and fMRI modalities to enable the retrieval\nof visual and auditory stimuli from patterns of cortical activity (and\nvice-versa). We validate our approach on 7T task-fMRI data from 174 healthy\nparticipants engaged in the movie-watching experiment from the Human Connectome\nProject (HCP). Results show that it is possible to detect which movie clips an\nindividual is watching purely from their brain activity, even for individuals\nand movies not seen during training.

While traditional segmentation\nmethods have achieved remarkable success, their generalization to diverse\nscenes and unseen object categories remains limited. Recent advancements in\nlarge language models (LLMs) offer a promising avenue for bridging visual and\ntextual modalities, providing a deeper understanding of semantic relationships.\nIn this paper, we propose LangSeg, a novel LLM-guided semantic segmentation\nmethod that leverages context-sensitive, fine-grained subclass descriptors\ngenerated by LLMs. Our framework integrates these descriptors with a\npre-trained Vision Transformer (ViT) to achieve superior segmentation\nperformance without extensive model retraining.

Additionally, we conduct a comprehensive\nablation study and human evaluation to validate the effectiveness of our method\nin real-world scenarios.

Real cyberattacks are often multi-host network attacks, which\ninvolve executing a number of steps across multiple hosts such as conducting\nreconnaissance, exploiting vulnerabilities, and using compromised hosts to\nexfiltrate data. To date, the extent to which LLMs can autonomously execute\nmulti-host network attacks} is not well understood. To this end, our first\ncontribution is MHBench, an open-source multi-host attack benchmark with 10\nrealistic emulated networks (from 25 to 50 hosts). We find that popular LLMs\nincluding modern reasoning models (e.g., GPT4o, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Sonnet 3.7\nThinking) with state-of-art security-relevant prompting strategies (e.g.,\nPentestGPT, CyberSecEval3) cannot autonomously execute multi-host network\nattacks. To enable LLMs to autonomously execute such attacks, our second\ncontribution is Incalmo, an high-level abstraction layer. Incalmo enables LLMs\nto specify high-level actions (e.g., infect a host, scan a network). Incalmo's\ntranslation layer converts these actions into lower-level primitives (e.g.,\ncommands to exploit tools) through expert agents. In 9 out of 10 networks in\nMHBench, LLMs using Incalmo achieve at least some of the attack goals. Even\nsmaller LLMs (e.g., Haiku 3.5, Gemini 2 Flash) equipped with Incalmo achieve\nall goals in 5 of 10 environments. We also validate the key role of high-level\nactions in Incalmo's abstraction in enabling LLMs to autonomously execute such\nattacks.",

The systematic optimization strategy\nresults in a new surrogate model with comparable accuracy, and provides\ninsights into the meaning and role of the various network settings and\nhyperparameters as well as the structure of the physical process. Moreover,\nNRSur7dq4Remnant_NN results in evaluation speedups of up to $8$ times on a\nsingle CPU and a further improvement of $2,000$ times when evaluated in batches\non a GPU. To determine the training set size, we propose an iterative\nenrichment strategy that efficiently samples the parameter space using much\nsmaller training sets than naive sampling.

However,\nthese studies inferred star formation rates (SFRs) either from [O II] line\nfluxes or from spectral energy distribution modeling, and could have missed\nlarge dust-obscured contributions to the SFRs. In this study, we present\nKeck/NIRES observations of 13 massive ($\\mathrm{M_*}\\gtrsim \\times 10^{11} \\,\\,\n\\mathrm{M_\\odot}$) PSBs, which allow us to estimate $\\mathrm{H\\alpha}$ SFRs in\nthese gas-rich post-starburst galaxies. We confirm the previously inferred low\nSFRs for the majority of the sample: 11/13 targets show clear\n$\\mathrm{H\\alpha}$ absorption, with minimal infilling indicating dust-corrected\nSFRs of $<4.1 \\,\\mathrm{M_\\odot\\, yr^{-1}}$. These SFRs are notably low given\nthe large $\\mathrm{H_2}$ reservoirs ($\\sim 1-5 \\times 10^{10} \\,\\,\n\\mathrm{M_\\odot}$) present in 5/13 of these galaxies, placing them\nsignificantly offset from star-forming galaxies on the Kennicutt-Schmidt\nrelation for star-forming galaxies. The [N II]/H$\\alpha$ ratios of all 13 PSBs\nimply contributions from non-star-forming ionization mechanisms (e.g., AGN,\nshocks, or hot evolved stars) to their $\\mathrm{H\\alpha}$ emission, suggesting\nthat even these low ongoing SFRs may be overestimated. These low\n$\\mathrm{H\\alpha}$ SFRs, dust-corrected using A$_v$ estimates from SED fitting,\nconfirm that these galaxies are very likely quiescent and, thus, that galaxies\ncan quench before their cold gas reservoirs are fully depleted.",

Recent\nresults on various benchmarks for code generation, repair, or completion\nsuggest that certain models have programming abilities comparable to or even\nsurpass humans. In this work, we demonstrate that high performance on such\nbenchmarks does not correlate to humans' innate ability to understand\nstructural control flow in code. To this end, we extract solutions from the\nHumanEval benchmark, which the relevant models perform strongly on, and trace\ntheir execution path using function calls sampled from the respective test set.\nUsing this dataset, we investigate the ability of seven state-of-the-art LLMs\nto match the execution trace and find that, despite their ability to generate\nsemantically identical code, they possess limited ability to trace execution\npaths, especially for longer traces and specific control structures. We find\nthat even the top-performing model, Gemini, can fully and correctly generate\nonly 47% of HumanEval task traces. Additionally, we introduce a subset for\nthree key structures not contained in HumanEval: Recursion, Parallel\nProcessing, and Object-Oriented Programming, including concepts like\nInheritance and Polymorphism. Besides OOP, we show that none of the\ninvestigated models achieve an accuracy over 5% on the relevant traces.\nAggregating these specialized parts with HumanEval tasks, we present CoCoNUT:\nCode Control Flow for Navigation Understanding and Testing, which measures a\nmodel's ability to trace execution of code upon relevant calls, including\nadvanced structural components.

Despite the notable accuracy\ndemonstrated by pioneering tools, the broader application of DLVD methods in\nreal-world scenarios is hindered by significant challenges. A primary issue is\nthe \"one-for-all\" design, where a single model is trained to handle all types\nof vulnerabilities. This approach fails to capture the patterns of different\nvulnerability types, resulting in suboptimal performance, particularly for less\ncommon vulnerabilities that are often underrepresented in training datasets. To\naddress these challenges, we propose MoEVD, which adopts the Mixture-of-Experts\n(MoE) framework for vulnerability detection. MoEVD decomposes vulnerability\ndetection into two tasks, CWE type classification and CWE-specific\nvulnerability detection. By splitting the task, in vulnerability detection,\nMoEVD allows specific experts to handle distinct types of vulnerabilities\ninstead of handling all vulnerabilities within one model. Our results show that\nMoEVD achieves an F1-score of 0.44, significantly outperforming all studied\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines by at least 12.8%. MoEVD excels across almost\nall CWE types, improving recall over the best SOTA baseline by 9% to 77.8%.\nNotably, MoEVD does not sacrifice performance on long-tailed CWE types;\ninstead, its MoE design enhances performance (F1-score) on these by at least\n7.3%, addressing long-tailed issues effectively.",

This\nimpossibility arises from an inescapable information-theoretic gap: the entropy\nof harm H(O) always exceeds the mutual information I(O;I) between ground truth\nharm O and a system's specifications I.\n  We introduce two novel metrics: semantic entropy H(S) and the\nsafety-capability ratio I(O;I)/H(O), to quantify these limitations.

    "abstract": "We consider a class of sparse random matrices, which includes the adjacency\nmatrix of Erd\\H{o}s-R\\'enyi graph ${\\bf G}(N,p)$. For $N^{-1+o(1)}\\leq p\\leq\n1/2$, we show that the non-trivial edge eigenvectors are asymptotically jointly\nnormal. The main ingredient of the proof is an algorithm that directly computes\nthe joint eigenvector distributions, without comparisons with GOE. The method\nis applicable in general. As an illustration, we also use it to prove the\nnormal fluctuation in quantum ergodicity at the edge for Wigner matrices.\nAnother ingredient of the proof is the isotropic local law for sparse matrices,\nwhich at the same time improves several existing results.",

    "abstract": "Municipal inspections are an important part of maintaining the quality of\ngoods and services. In this paper, we approach the problem of intelligently\nscheduling service inspections to maximize their impact, using the case of food\nestablishment inspections in Chicago as a case study. The Chicago Department of\nPublic Health (CDPH) inspects thousands of establishments each year, with a\nsubstantial fail rate (over 3,000 failed inspection reports in 2023). To\nbalance the objectives of ensuring adherence to guidelines, minimizing\ndisruption to establishments, and minimizing inspection costs, CDPH assigns\neach establishment an inspection window every year and guarantees that they\nwill be inspected exactly once during that window. These constraints create a\nchallenge for a restless multi-armed bandit (RMAB) approach, for which there\nare no existing methods. We develop an extension to Whittle index-based systems\nfor RMABs that can guarantee action window constraints and frequencies, and\nfurthermore can be leveraged to optimize action window assignments themselves.\nBriefly, we combine MDP reformulation and integer programming-based lookahead\nto maximize the impact of inspections subject to constraints. A neural\nnetwork-based supervised learning model is developed to model state transitions\nof real Chicago establishments using public CDPH inspection records, which\ndemonstrates 10\\% AUC improvements compared with directly predicting\nestablishments' failures. Our experiments not only show up to 24\\% (in\nsimulation) or 33\\% (on real data) reward improvements resulting from our\napproach but also give insight into the impact of scheduling constraints.",

    "abstract": "Deep reinforcement learning has achieved remarkable success in learning\ncontrol policies from pixels across a wide range of tasks, yet its application\nremains hindered by low sample efficiency, requiring significantly more\nenvironment interactions than humans to reach comparable performance.\nModel-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) offers a solution by leveraging\nlearnt world models to generate simulated experience, thereby improving sample\nefficiency. However, in visually complex environments, small or dynamic\nelements can be critical for decision-making. Yet, traditional MBRL methods in\npixel-based environments typically rely on auto-encoding with an $L_2$ loss,\nwhich is dominated by large areas and often fails to capture decision-relevant\ndetails. To address these limitations, we propose an object-centric MBRL\npipeline, which integrates recent advances in computer vision to allow agents\nto focus on key decision-related elements. Our approach consists of four main\nsteps: (1) annotating key objects related to rewards and goals with\nsegmentation masks, (2) extracting object features using a pre-trained, frozen\nfoundation vision model, (3) incorporating these object features with the raw\nobservations to predict environmental dynamics, and (4) training the policy\nusing imagined trajectories generated by this object-centric world model.\nBuilding on the efficient MBRL algorithm STORM, we call this pipeline OC-STORM.\nWe demonstrate OC-STORM's practical value in overcoming the limitations of\nconventional MBRL approaches on both Atari games and the visually complex game\nHollow Knight.",

      "Kieran Wood"
    ],
    "abstract": "It has long been understood that certain theories of ghost free massive\ngravity and their multi-graviton extensions can be thought of as arising from a\nhigher dimensional theory of gravity, upon discretising the extra dimension.\nHowever, this correspondence between standard multi-gravity and extra\ndimensional gravity holds only when one discretises the extra dimension after\ngauge fixing the lapse function associated to the various lower dimensional\nhypersurfaces. The lapse provides crucial structure to the extra dimensional\ntheory: in pure general relativity (GR), it ensures full diffeomorphism\ninvariance of the theory, and enforces its Hamiltonian constraint. Thus, upon\ndeconstruction, important information related to the extra dimension is missing\nin the resulting multi-gravity theory; as a result one could never hope to\nrecover higher dimensional GR in its entirety upon taking the appropriate\ncontinuum limit. Here, we develop an improved deconstruction procedure that\nmaintains the free lapse, and show that the resulting deconstructed theory is\nessentially multi-gravity equipped with additional dynamical scalar fields,\nwhose field equations encode the Hamiltonian constraint in the extra\ndimensional theory. As an example, we explicitly demonstrate that - with an\nFLRW ansatz for the metrics in this new theory - one may recover all of the\nequations and constraints of 5-dimensional brane cosmology upon taking the\ncontinuum limit. We then treat the deconstructed theory as an entity in its own\nright, and generalise it to arbitrary dimension and interaction structures\nbeyond those admitting a well-defined continuum limit. We dub this theory\n`scalar-tensor multi-gravity', and show that the new scalar equations change\nthe structure of some simple solutions that were previously allowed in standard\nmulti-gravity, in a manner that exactly mirrors what we expect from higher\ndimensional GR.",

This provides a microscopic derivation of the type of\neffective CTP actions used in the literature. While the full effective theory\nhas no critical points, we instead proceed to study critical properties of the\nRG flow in a reduced space of complex couplings that characterise certain\ntime-ordered correlators and show the existence of two novel fixed points in\n$d=4$ spacetime dimensions.

    "abstract": "In the IceCube Neutrino Observatory, a signal of astrophysical neutrinos is\nobscured by backgrounds from atmospheric neutrinos and muons produced in\ncosmic-ray interactions. IceCube event selections used to isolate the\nastrophysical neutrino signal often focus on t/he morphology of the light\npatterns recorded by the detector. The analyses presented here use the new\nIceCube Enhanced Starting Track Event Selection (ESTES), which identifies\nevents likely generated by muon neutrino interactions within the detector\ngeometry, focusing on neutrino energies of 1-500 TeV with a median angular\nresolution of 1.4{\\deg}. Selecting for starting track events filters out not\nonly the atmospheric-muon background, but also the atmospheric-neutrino\nbackground in the southern sky. This improves IceCube's muon neutrino\nsensitivity to southern-sky neutrino sources, especially for Galactic sources\nthat are not expected to produce a substantial flux of neutrinos above 100 TeV.\nIn this work, the ESTES sample was applied for the first time to searches for\nastrophysical sources of neutrinos, including a search for diffuse neutrino\nemission from the Galactic plane. No significant excesses were identified from\nany of the analyses; however, constraining limits are set on the hadronic\nemission from TeV gamma-ray Galactic plane objects and models of the diffuse\nGalactic plane neutrino flux.",

    "abstract": "We compute the energy scales of perturbative unitarity violation in various\n$2 \\to 4$ vector boson scattering (VBS) processes and compare them to lower\nmultiplicity processes. The final states include $h^4$, $V_L V_L h h$, and\n$V_L^4$, where $V_L$ represents the longitudinal mode of $Z$ or $W$ boson, and\n$h$ the Higgs boson. We consider scenarios with modified cubic and quartic\nHiggs self-couplings, including those derived from the Standard Model Effective\nField Theory (SMEFT), as well as scenarios involving derivative operators from\nHiggs Effective Field Theory (HEFT). Modified Higgs self-couplings typically\nlead to perturbative unitarity violation in at least the $2\\to 3$ VBS; however,\nthe corresponding energy scales of unitarity violation are often very high. Our\nanalysis reveals that, in the case of modified Higgs potentials, $2\\to4$\nprocesses exhibit significantly lower energy scales of unitarity violation\ncompared to $2 \\to 3$ processes. This, combined with the fact that the cross\nsections of $2 \\to 4$ processes increase with energy, suggests they generate\nmore signal events at high energies, $\\sqrt{\\hat{s}} \\gtrsim 2$ TeV, which\ncould be achieved in future colliders. In contrast, for HEFT derivative\ninteractions, higher multiplicity offers diminished benefits, as $2 \\to 4$\ncross sections are often smaller than those of related $2 \\to 3$ processes\nwithin the valid energy range. This study shows that $2 \\to 4$ VBS processes\nare particularly compelling for probing Higgs potential modification, including\nthe cubic and quartic couplings, but are less advantageous when derivative\ninteractions dominate.",

    "abstract": "In the type II von Neumann algebras that appear in semiclassical gravity, all\nstates have infinite entropy, but entropy differences are uniquely defined.\nAkers and I have shown that the entropy difference of microcanonical states has\na relative state-counting interpretation in terms of the additional (finite)\nnumber of degrees of freedom that are needed to represent the \"larger-entropy\"\nstate supposing that one already has a representation of the \"smaller-entropy\"\nstate, and supposing that one is restricted to act with gauge-invariant\noperators. This short paper explains some of the curious features of relative\nstate-counting by analogy to the classical limit of quantum statistical\nmechanics. In this analogy the preferred family of renormalized traces becomes\nthe preferred family of symplectic measures on phase space; the trace-index of\ninfinite-dimensional subspaces becomes the ratio of phase space volumes; and\nthe restriction that one must act with gauge-invariant operators becomes the\nrestriction that one must act with symplectomorphisms. Because in the\nphase-space analogy one has exact control over the quantum deformation away\nfrom the classical theory, one can see precisely how the relevant aspects of\nthe classical structure are inherited from the quantum theory -- though even in\nthis simple setting, it is a nontrivial technical task to show how classical\nsymplectomorphisms emerge from the underlying quantum theory in the $\\hbar \\to\n0$ limit.",

BTO is a NASA Student Collaboration Project flying on the\nCompton Spectrometer and Imager (COSI) Small Explorer mission in 2027. The\ndetectors utilized in this study are cylindrical in shape with a height and\ndiameter of 5.1 cm and were read out by silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs). We\nconducted a radiation campaign at the HIMAC accelerator in Japan where the\nscintillators were irradiated with a 230 MeV/u helium beam (He beam) and 350\nMeV/u carbon beam (C beam). We find that both the CsI and NaI scintillators\nexhibit afterglow signatures when irradiated with the C and He beams. The CsI\ncrystal exhibits a stronger afterglow intensity with afterglow pulses occurring\nfor an average 2.40 ms for C and 0.9 ms for He after the initial particle\npulse. The duration of afterglow pulses in CsI is 8.6x and 5.6x the afterglow\nsignal duration in NaI for C and He (0.28 ms and 0.16 ms, respectively).\nAlthough CsI has advantages such as a higher light yield and radiation\nhardness, the stronger afterglows in the CsI detector increase the complexity\nof the electronics and lead to a ~7x larger dead time per afterglow event or a\n~3x higher energy threshold value. We use the measured dead times to predict\nthe amount of observing time lost to afterglow-inducing events for an\ninstrument like BTO in low Earth orbit. We simulate the background rates in a\nBTO-like orbit and find a total value of 114 counts/s for the full two-detector\nsystem. Based on the particle energies in the HIMAC experiment, we then\ndetermine that an event with sufficient energy to produce an afterglow signal\noccurs once every ~70 s and ~1.4 s in NaI and CsI detectors, respectively.\nThus, we conclude that NaI is the better choice for the BTO mission.",

Despite their\nsignificance, a universal definition of voids remains unsettled as various\nvoid-finding methods identify different types of voids, each differing in shape\nand density, based on the method that were used. In this paper, we present\nVEGA, a novel algorithm for void identification. VEGA utilizes Voronoi\ntessellation to divide the dataset space into spatial cells and applies the\nConvex Hull algorithm to estimate the volume of each cell. It then integrates\nGenetic Algorithm analysis with luminosity density contrast to filter out\nover-dense cells and retain the remaining ones, referred to as void block\ncells. These filtered cells form the basis for constructing the final void\nstructures. VEGA operates on a grid of points, which increases the algorithm's\nspatial accessibility to the dataset and facilitates the identification of seed\npoints around which the algorithm constructs the voids. To evaluate VEGA's\nperformance, we applied both VEGA and the Aikio M\\\"ah\\\"onen method to the same\ntest dataset. We compared the resulting void populations in terms of their\nluminosity and number density contrast, as well as their morphological features\nsuch as sphericity.

Weak lensing signals allow us\nto track the distribution of all (dark and baryonic) matter regardless of its\nobservable electromagnetic properties. Upcoming wide-field surveys like Euclid\nand LSST-Rubin will provide enhanced shape measurements of billions of\nbackground galaxies, presenting an unparalleled opportunity to detect galaxy\nclusters on a vast cosmic scale. The immense data volume generated by these\nsurveys will require efficient and accurate analysis techniques. In this work,\nwe introduce AMICO-WL, an extension of the optimal filtering algorithm\nimplemented in AMICO, a well-tested code developed for optical cluster\ndetection. AMICO-WL implements a specific linear optimal matched filter for\nweak lensing data in the AMICO infrastructure, using parallelisation and adding\nan efficient signal-to-noise ratio thresholding approach to set a desired\nsample purity and a cleaning procedure to deal with blended detections. The\nalgorithm has been tested on a 25 deg$^2$ field of Euclid-like mock galaxy\ncatalogue with the simulated shear signal produced using DUSTGRAIN-$pathfinder$\npast-light-cones. We implemented a foreground removal procedure based on\ndifferent cuts of low redshift galaxies from the input catalogue. To evaluate\nthe performance of the method, we used an efficient matching procedure based on\nthe 'blinking' of the simulation's individual redshift lensing planes.\nCross-matching the AMICO-WL detections with the dark matter halo sample in the\nsimulation having $M_{200} > 5 \\times 10^{13}$ $M_{\\odot}/h$ and considering a\npurity level of $\\sim70\\%$, the application of the foreground removal doubles\nthe completeness from $6.5\\%$ to $13.0\\%$ and at the same time produces a\nsignificant decrease of spurious detections.",

    "abstract": "Common signal-processing approximations produce artefacts when timing pulsars\nin relativistic binary systems, especially edge-on systems with tight orbits,\nsuch as the Double Pulsar. In this paper, we use extensive simulations to\nexplore various patterns that arise from the inaccuracies of approximations\nmade when correcting dispersion and Shapiro delay. In a relativistic binary,\nthe velocity of the pulsar projected onto the line-of-sight varies\nsignificantly on short time scales, causing rapid changes in the apparent\npulsar spin frequency, which is used to convert dispersive delays to pulsar\nrotational phase shifts. A well-known example of the consequences of this\neffect is the artificial variation of dispersion measure (DM) with binary\nphase, first observed in the Double Pulsar 20 years ago. We show that ignoring\nthe Doppler shift of the spin frequency when computing the dispersive phase\nshift exactly reproduces the shape and magnitude of the reported DM variations.\nWe also simulate and study two additional effects of much smaller magnitude,\nwhich are caused by the assumption that the spin frequency used to correct\ndispersion is constant over the duration of the sub-integration and over the\nobserved bandwidth. We show that failure to account for these two effects leads\nto orbital phase-dependent dispersive smearing that leads to apparent orbital\nDM variations. The functional form of the variation depends on the orbital\neccentricity. In addition, we find that a polynomial approximation of the\ntiming model is unable to accurately describe the Shapiro delay of edge-on\nsystems with orbits less than 4 hours, which poses problems for the\nmeasurements of timing parameters, most notably the Shapiro delay. This will be\na potential issue for sensitive facilities like the FAST and the forthcoming\nSquare Kilometre Array (SKA); therefore, a more accurate phase predictor is\nindispensable.",

In this work, we investigate the impact of a dynamic\nneutrino mass spectrum on the diffuse supernova neutrino background (DSNB),\nwhich is composed of neutrinos from all supernova explosions throughout cosmic\nhistory and is on the verge of experimental detection. Since neutrino\noscillations are highly sensitive to the mass spectrum, we show that the\nelectron neutrino survival probability carries distinct signatures of the\nevolving neutrino mass spectrum. Our results indicate that the resulting\nmodifications to the DSNB spectrum would exhibit unique energy-dependent\nfeatures.

While deeper QAOA circuits\ncan offer greater accuracy, practical applications are constrained by complex\nparameter optimisation and physical limitations such as gate noise, restricted\nqubit connectivity, and state-preparation-and-measurement errors, limiting\nimplementations to shallow depths. This work focuses on QAOA$_1$ (QAOA at\n$p=1$) for QUBO problems, represented as Ising models.

This behaviour\nnecessitates high-resolution grid searches to avoid distortion of cost\nlandscapes that may result in inaccurate minima. We propose an efficient\noptimisation strategy that reduces the two-dimensional $(\\gamma, \\beta)$ search\nto a one-dimensional search over $\\gamma$, with $\\beta^*$ computed\nanalytically.

    "abstract": "Understanding the physical world is a fundamental challenge in embodied AI,\ncritical for enabling agents to perform complex tasks and operate safely in\nreal-world environments. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown great\npromise in reasoning and task planning for embodied agents, their ability to\ncomprehend physical phenomena remains extremely limited. To close this gap, we\nintroduce PhysBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate VLMs'\nphysical world understanding capability across a diverse set of tasks.\nPhysBench contains 10,002 entries of interleaved video-image-text data,\ncategorized into four major domains: physical object properties, physical\nobject relationships, physical scene understanding, and physics-based dynamics,\nfurther divided into 19 subclasses and 8 distinct capability dimensions. Our\nextensive experiments, conducted on 75 representative VLMs, reveal that while\nthese models excel in common-sense reasoning, they struggle with understanding\nthe physical world -- likely due to the absence of physical knowledge in their\ntraining data and the lack of embedded physical priors. To tackle the\nshortfall, we introduce PhysAgent, a novel framework that combines the\ngeneralization strengths of VLMs with the specialized expertise of vision\nmodels, significantly enhancing VLMs' physical understanding across a variety\nof tasks, including an 18.4\\% improvement on GPT-4o. Furthermore, our results\ndemonstrate that enhancing VLMs' physical world understanding capabilities can\nhelp embodied agents such as MOKA. We believe that PhysBench and PhysAgent\noffer valuable insights and contribute to bridging the gap between VLMs and\nphysical world understanding.",

To obtain much-needed additional clues to the origin of\nthis and other known peculiarities of WLQs, we have determined the 'ensemble'\noptical variability characteristics for a large, well-defined sample of 76\nradio-quiet WLQs and also for a matched control sample comprising 603 normal\nradio-quiet QSOs. This analysis was done using their light-curves recorded in\nthe $g$ and $r$ bands, under the ZTF survey during 2018-2024, with a typical\ncadence of 3 days. We find that, compared to normal QSOs, WLQs exhibit\nsystematically milder optical variability on month/year-like time scales (by a\nfactor of $\\sim$ 1.76$\\pm$0.05 in amplitude). We have independently verified\nthis by carrying out an equivalent analysis of the V-band light-curves acquired\nunder the CRTS during 2007- 2014, with a typical cadence of 10 days. This new\nobservational differentiator between WLQs and normal QSOs may provide clues to\nunderstanding the intriguing nature of WLQs.

We introduce\nDeformable Beta Splatting (DBS), a deformable and compact approach that\nenhances both geometry and color representation. DBS replaces Gaussian kernels\nwith deformable Beta Kernels, which offer bounded support and adaptive\nfrequency control to capture fine geometric details with higher fidelity while\nachieving better memory efficiency.

Experimental results demonstrate that DBS achieves\nstate-of-the-art visual quality while utilizing only 45% of the parameters and\nrendering 1.5x faster than 3DGS-MCMC, highlighting the superior performance of\nDBS for real-time radiance field rendering.

Here, we present\nthe light curves of 22 Type I X-ray bursts observed by RXTE that coincide,\nfully or partially, with an X-ray eclipse. We identify nine instances where the\nburst occurs entirely within totality, seven bursts split across an egress, and\nsix cases interrupted by an ingress. All in-eclipse bursts and split bursts\noccurred while the source was in the hard spectral state. We establish that we\nare not observing direct burst emission during eclipses since the companion\nstar and the ablated outflow entirely obscure our view of the X-ray emitting\nregion. We determine that the reflected flux from the outer accretion disc,\neven if maximally flared, is insufficient to explain all observations of\nin-eclipse X-ray bursts and instead explore scenarios whereby the emission\narising from the X-ray bursts is scattered, either by a burst-induced rise in\n$N_{\\rm{H}}$ that provides extra material, an accretion disc wind or the\nablated outflow into our line of sight.

Using 80 central and satellite galaxies from three simulation suites\n(Marvelous Massive Dwarfs, Marvelous Dwarfs, and DC Justice League) spanning\nstellar masses of $10^6$--$10^{10}$ $M_\\odot$, we measure 3D shapes through the\nmoment of inertia tensor at two times the effective radius to derive axis\nratios ($C/A$, $B/A$) and triaxiality. We find that stellar shape does indeed\nfollow DM halo shape for our dwarf galaxies. However, the presence of a stellar\ndisk in more massive dwarfs ($M_* \\gtrsim 10^{7.5}$ $M_\\odot$) pulls the\ndistribution of stellar $C/A$ ratios to lower values, while in lower mass\ngalaxies the gravitational potential remains predominantly shaped by DM.\nSimilarly, stellar triaxiality generally tracks dark matter halo triaxiality,\nwith this relationship being particularly strong for non-disky galaxies though\nweaker in disky systems. This correlation is reinforced by strong alignment\nbetween SM and DM axes, particularly in disk galaxies. Further, we find no\ndetectable difference in either SM or DM shape comparing two different SNe\nfeedback implementations, demonstrating that shape measurements may be robust\nto different implementations of baryonic feedback in dwarf galaxies. We also\nobserve that a dwarf galaxy's shape is largely unperturbed by recent mergers\n(with merger ratios $>4$).

In such models, the\nrepeated pairwise interactions between the system and the environment and also\nthe possible coupling between different environmental units are typically\nmodeled using the coherent partial-swap (PSWAP) operation as it is known to be\na universal homogenizer.

A locally hosted Llama 3.1\n405B model, accessed via the Application Programming Interface (API) service,\nwas used to extract keywords from the CT simulation orders and generate\nsummaries. The downloaded CT simulation orders were categorized into seven\ngroups based on treatment modalities and disease sites.

The ground truth for\nthe corresponding summaries was manually derived by carefully reviewing each CT\nsimulation order and subsequently verified by therapists. The accuracy of the\nLLM-generated summaries was evaluated by therapists using the verified ground\ntruth as a reference.\n  Results: About 98% of the LLM-generated summaries aligned with the manually\ngenerated ground truth in terms of accuracy. Our evaluations showed an improved\nconsistency in format and enhanced readability of the LLM-generated summaries\ncompared to the corresponding therapists-generated summaries.

    "abstract": "Virtual excitations, inherent to ultrastrongly coupled light-matter systems,\ninduce measurable modifications in system properties, offering a novel resource\nfor quantum technologies. In this work, we demonstrate how these virtual\nexcitations and their correlations can be harnessed to enhance precision\nmeasurements, without the need to extract them. Building on the paradigmatic\nDicke model, which describes the interaction between an ensemble of two-level\natoms and a single radiation mode, we propose a method to harness hybridized\nlight-matter modes whose renormalized frequencies encode the effects of virtual\nexcitations for quantum metrology. Remarkably, we find that for a fixed\nsqueezing parameter $\\xi$, exploiting virtual squeezing through oscillator\nfrequency shifts yields a quadratic enhancement in estimation precision --\nscaling as $\\exp(4\\xi)$ -- compared to the conventional $\\exp(2\\xi)$ scaling of\nreal squeezed states. These results show that virtual excitations, though\nunobservable, can drive metrological performance beyond the standard quantum\nlimit. Our approach establishes a broadly applicable framework for\nhigh-precision measurements across a wide class of ultrastrongly coupled\nquantum systems.",

    "abstract": "Retrieving events from videos using text queries has become increasingly\nchallenging due to the rapid growth of multimedia content. Existing methods for\ntext-based video event retrieval often focus heavily on object-level\ndescriptions, overlooking the crucial role of contextual information. This\nlimitation is especially apparent when queries lack sufficient context, such as\nmissing location details or ambiguous background elements. To address these\nchallenges, we propose a novel system called RAPID (Retrieval-Augmented\nParallel Inference Drafting), which leverages advancements in Large Language\nModels (LLMs) and prompt-based learning to semantically correct and enrich user\nqueries with relevant contextual information. These enriched queries are then\nprocessed through parallel retrieval, followed by an evaluation step to select\nthe most relevant results based on their alignment with the original query.\nThrough extensive experiments on our custom-developed dataset, we demonstrate\nthat RAPID significantly outperforms traditional retrieval methods,\nparticularly for contextually incomplete queries. Our system was validated for\nboth speed and accuracy through participation in the Ho Chi Minh City AI\nChallenge 2024, where it successfully retrieved events from over 300 hours of\nvideo. Further evaluation comparing RAPID with the baseline proposed by the\ncompetition organizers demonstrated its superior effectiveness, highlighting\nthe strength and robustness of our approach.",

However, most existing high-resolution MLLMs rely on a\ncropping-based approach to process images, which leads to fragmented visual\nencoding and a sharp increase in redundant tokens. To tackle these issues, we\npropose the FALCON model. FALCON introduces a novel visual register technique\nto simultaneously: 1) Eliminate redundant tokens at the stage of visual\nencoding. To directly address the visual redundancy present in the output of\nvision encoder, we propose a Register-based Representation Compacting\n(ReCompact) mechanism. This mechanism introduces a set of learnable visual\nregisters designed to adaptively aggregate essential information while\ndiscarding redundancy. It enables the encoder to produce a more compact visual\nrepresentation with a minimal number of output tokens, thus eliminating the\nneed for an additional compression module. 2) Ensure continuity in visual\nencoding. To address the potential encoding errors caused by fragmented visual\ninputs, we develop a Register Interactive Attention (ReAtten) module. This\nmodule facilitates effective and efficient information exchange across\nsub-images by enabling interactions between visual registers. It ensures the\ncontinuity of visual semantics throughout the encoding. We conduct\ncomprehensive experiments with FALCON on high-resolution benchmarks across a\nwide range of scenarios.

Mixture-of-Mamba consistently reaches the same loss values at earlier\ntraining steps with significantly reduced computational costs. In the\nTransfusion setting, Mixture-of-Mamba achieves equivalent image loss using only\n34.76% of the training FLOPs at the 1.4B scale.

Synthetic observables play an important role in\nconstraining coronal heating theories. Choosing the spatial resolution of\nnumerical simulations involves a trade-off between accuracy and computational\ncost. Since the numerical resolution not only affects the scale of structures\nthat can be resolved, but also thermodynamic quantities such as the average\ncoronal density, it is important to quantify the effect on synthesized\nobservables. Using 3D radiative MHD simulations of coronal loops at three\ndifferent grid spacings, from 60 km down to 12 km, we find that changes in\nnumerical resolution lead to differences in thermodynamic quantities and\nstratification as well as dynamic behaviour. Higher grid resolution results in\na more complex and dynamic atmosphere. The resolution affects the emission\nintensity as well as the velocity distribution, thereby affecting synthetic\nspectra derived from the simulation. The distribution of synthetic coronal loop\nstrand sizes changes as more fine-scale structure is resolved. A number of\nparameters, however, seem to start to saturate from our chosen medium grid\nresolution on. Our study shows that while choosing a sufficiently high\nresolution matters when comparing forward-modelled observables with data from\ncurrent and future space missions, for most purposes not much is gained by\nfurther increasing the resolution beyond a grid spacing of 24 km, which seems\nto be adequate for reproducing bulk loop properties and forward-modelled\nemission, representing a good trade-off between accuracy and computational\nresource.",

We\nstudy the problem of synthesizing preference-satisfying strategies in\ntwo-player stochastic games on graphs where players have opposite (possibly\nincomplete) preferences over a set of temporal goals. We represent these goals\nusing linear temporal logic over finite traces (LTLf), which enables modeling\nthe nuances of human preferences where temporal goals need not be mutually\nexclusive and comparison between some goals may be unspecified. We introduce a\nsolution concept of non-dominated almost-sure winning, which guarantees to\nachieve a most preferred outcome aligned with specified preferences while\nmaintaining robustness against the adversarial behaviors of the opponent. Our\nresults show that strategy profiles based on this concept are Nash equilibria\nin the game where players are risk-averse, thus providing a practical framework\nfor evaluating and ensuring stable, preference-aligned outcomes in the game.\nUsing a drone delivery example, we demonstrate that our contributions offer\nvaluable insights not only for synthesizing rational behavior under incomplete\npreferences but also for designing games that motivate the desired behavior\nfrom the players in adversarial conditions.",

To address\nthis challenge, we propose the Multi-view Structural Convolution Network\n(MSCN), a novel architecture designed to achieve domain-invariant recognition\nacross diverse LiDAR configurations and environments. MSCN comprises Structural\nConvolution Layers (SCL) that extract local context geometric features from\npoint clouds and Structural Aggregation Layers (SAL) that extract and aggregate\nboth local and overall context features from point clouds. Furthermore, we\nincorporate an unseen domain generation strategy to mitigate domain gaps during\ntraining. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MSCN consistently outperforms\nstate-of-the-art point cloud classification methods across all domain change\nscenarios. These results highlight MSCN as a scalable solution for deploying\nLiDAR-based perception systems of AVs. Our code is available at\nhttps://github.com/MLMLab/MSCN.",

In this work, we extend UDRL to the task of\nlearning a command-conditioned generator of deep neural network policies. We\naccomplish this using Hypernetworks - a variant of Fast Weight Programmers,\nwhich learn to decode input commands representing a desired expected return\ninto command-specific weight matrices. Our method, dubbed Upside Down\nReinforcement Learning with Policy Generators (UDRLPG), streamlines comparable\ntechniques by removing the need for an evaluator or critic to update the\nweights of the generator. To counteract the increased variance in last returns\ncaused by not having an evaluator, we decouple the sampling probability of the\nbuffer from the absolute number of policies in it, which, together with a\nsimple weighting strategy, improves the empirical convergence of the algorithm.\nCompared with existing algorithms, UDRLPG achieves competitive performance and\nhigh returns, sometimes outperforming more complex architectures. Our\nexperiments show that a trained generator can generalize to create policies\nthat achieve unseen returns zero-shot. The proposed method appears to be\neffective in mitigating some of the challenges associated with learning highly\nmultimodal functions.

The translational correlation time for the case of 25 nm\nnanoparticles is also temperature-independent and yields about 6 x 10$^{-7}$ s,\nwhile for the dispersion of the larger nanoparticles, the correlation times\nchanged from about 8 x 10$^{-7}$ s at 313 K to about 1.2 x 10$^{-6}$ s at 263\nK.

While LLMs have\nshown promise in generating chart descriptions, captions, and design\nsuggestions, their potential for evaluating visualizations remains\nunder-explored. Collecting data from humans for evaluations has been a\nbottleneck for visualization research in terms of both time and money, and if\nLLMs were able to serve, even in some limited role, as evaluators, they could\nbe a significant resource. To investigate the feasibility of using LLMs in the\nvisualization evaluation process, we explore the extent to which LLMs possess\nvisualization literacy -- a crucial factor for their effective utility in the\nfield. We conducted a series of experiments using a modified 53-item\nVisualization Literacy Assessment Test (VLAT) for GPT-4 and Gemini. Our\nfindings indicate that the LLMs we explored currently fail to achieve the same\nlevels of visualization literacy when compared to data from the general public\nreported in VLAT, and LLMs heavily relied on their pre-existing knowledge to\nanswer questions instead of utilizing the information provided by the\nvisualization when answering questions.",

    "abstract": "With the rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence, particularly in\nNatural Language Processing, Large Language Models (LLMs) have become pivotal\nin educational question-answering systems, especially university admission\nchatbots. Concepts such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and other\nadvanced techniques have been developed to enhance these systems by integrating\nspecific university data, enabling LLMs to provide informed responses on\nadmissions and academic counseling. However, these enhanced RAG techniques\noften involve high operational costs and require the training of complex,\nspecialized modules, which poses challenges for practical deployment.\nAdditionally, in the educational context, it is crucial to provide accurate\nanswers to prevent misinformation, a task that LLM-based systems find\nchallenging without appropriate strategies and methods. In this paper, we\nintroduce the Unified RAG (URAG) Framework, a hybrid approach that\nsignificantly improves the accuracy of responses, particularly for critical\nqueries. Experimental results demonstrate that URAG enhances our in-house,\nlightweight model to perform comparably to state-of-the-art commercial models.\nMoreover, to validate its practical applicability, we conducted a case study at\nour educational institution, which received positive feedback and acclaim. This\nstudy not only proves the effectiveness of URAG but also highlights its\nfeasibility for real-world implementation in educational settings.",

For the separate parametrization, we show that the training\ndynamics has exponentially many fixed points and the loss exhibits\nsaddle-to-saddle dynamics, which we reduce to scalar ordinary differential\nequations. During training, the model implements principal component regression\nin context with the number of principal components increasing over training\ntime.

To examine the nature of the Al insertion in detail,\nneutron powder diffraction (NPD) data were collected on the SSM and SG samples.\nCombined Rietveld refinements of the PXRD and NPD data confirm that effective\nsubstitution of the Al ions is only achieved for the SG sample and reveal that\nAl occupies mainly the (2a)Oh and (12k)Oh sites and to a lesser extent the\n(4e)BP, (4f)Oh and (4f)Td sites.

    "abstract": "Despite a decade's worth of gravitational wave observation, the origin of the\nbinary black hole (BBH) mergers detected by the LIGO-VIRGO-Kagra (LVK)\ncollaboration remains an open question. Towards assessing the feasibility and\nprevalence of the many proposed BBH formation channels, the spin properties of\nthe merging black holes (BHs) hold significant promise, particularly their\norientations. The combined trends of a moderate preferential alignment of BH\nspins with their orbit normals and an apparent correlation of BBH effective\nspin parameters $\\chi_{\\rm eff}$ with their mass ratios seem to favor\nhydrodynamical BBH formation mechanisms over purely dynamical ones, as they\nintroduce a preferred orientation to the system. However, such processes are\nfilled with physical and modeling uncertainties. In this paper, we highlight a\ndynamical route to easily characterizable spin evolution that results in\nanalytically-predictable spin distributions. We show that, when a stellar\nbinary forms a BBH through two phases of stable mass transfer, and the BBH is\nsubsequently driven to merger by the gravitational perturbation of a distant\nmassive object (such as a supermassive black hole), the resulting spin-orbit\nmisalignment angles are anti-correlated with the binary mass ratio. While the\nmechanism as proposed only operates in a somewhat narrow region of parameter\nspace, it also predicts significantly tighter correlations than are seen in the\nLVK systems. We discuss avenues for future work that may significantly expand\nthe parameter space of our mechanism while still remaining broadly consistent\nwith observations.",

    "abstract": "Query scheduling is a critical task that directly impacts query performance\nin database management systems (DBMS). Deeply integrated schedulers, which\nrequire changes to DBMS internals, are usually customized for a specific engine\nand can take months to implement. In contrast, non-intrusive schedulers make\ncoarse-grained decisions, such as controlling query admission and re-ordering\nquery execution, without requiring modifications to DBMS internals. They\nrequire much less engineering effort and can be applied across a wide range of\nDBMS engines, offering immediate benefits to end users. However, most existing\nnon-intrusive scheduling systems rely on simplified cost models and heuristics\nthat cannot accurately model query interactions under concurrency and different\nsystem states, possibly leading to suboptimal scheduling decisions.\n  This work introduces IconqSched, a new, principled non-intrusive scheduler\nthat optimizes the execution order and timing of queries to enhance total\nend-to-end runtime as experienced by the user query queuing time plus system\nruntime. Unlike previous approaches, IconqSched features a novel fine-grained\npredictor, Iconq, which treats the DBMS as a black box and accurately estimates\nthe system runtime of concurrently executed queries under different system\nstates. Using these predictions, IconqSched is able to capture system runtime\nvariations across different query mixes and system loads. It then employs a\ngreedy scheduling algorithm to effectively determine which queries to submit\nand when to submit them. We compare IconqSched to other schedulers in terms of\nend-to-end runtime using real workload traces. On Postgres, IconqSched reduces\nend-to-end runtime by 16.2%-28.2% on average and 33.6%-38.9% in the tail.\nSimilarly, on Redshift, it reduces end-to-end runtime by 10.3%-14.1% on average\nand 14.9%-22.2% in the tail.",

    "abstract": "Brain tumor segmentation is important for diagnosis of the tumor, and current\ndeep-learning methods rely on a large set of annotated images for training,\nwith high annotation costs. Unsupervised segmentation is promising to avoid\nhuman annotations while the performance is often limited. In this study, we\npresent a novel unsupervised segmentation approach that leverages the\ncapabilities of foundation models, and it consists of three main steps: (1) A\nvision-language model (i.e., CLIP) is employed to obtain image-level\npseudo-labels for training a classification network. Class Activation Mapping\n(CAM) is then employed to extract Regions of Interest (ROIs), where an adaptive\nmasking-based data augmentation is used to enhance ROI identification.(2) The\nROIs are used to generate bounding box and point prompts for the Segment\nAnything Model (SAM) to obtain segmentation pseudo-labels. (3) A 3D\nsegmentation network is trained with the SAM-derived pseudo-labels, where\nlow-quality pseudo-labels are filtered out in a self-learning process based on\nthe similarity between the SAM's output and the network's prediction.\nEvaluation on the BraTS2020 dataset demonstrates that our approach obtained an\naverage Dice Similarity Score (DSC) of 85.60%, outperforming five\nstate-of-the-art unsupervised segmentation methods by more than 10 percentage\npoints. Besides, our approach outperforms directly using SAM for zero-shot\ninference, and its performance is close to fully supervised learning.",

    "abstract": "Modern embedded systems are evolving toward complex, heterogeneous\narchitectures to accommodate increasingly demanding applications. Driven by\nSWAP-C constraints, this shift has led to consolidating multiple systems onto\nsingle hardware platforms. Static Partitioning Hypervisors offer a promising\nsolution to partition hardware resources and provide spatial isolation between\ncritical workloads. However, shared resources like the Last-Level Cache and\nsystem bus can introduce temporal interference between virtual machines (VMs),\nnegatively impacting performance and predictability. Over the past decade,\nacademia and industry have developed interference mitigation techniques, such\nas cache partitioning and memory bandwidth reservation. However, configuring\nthese techniques is complex and time-consuming. Cache partitioning requires\nbalancing cache sections across VMs, while memory bandwidth reservation needs\ntuning bandwidth budgets and periods. Testing all configurations is impractical\nand often leads to suboptimal results. Moreover, understanding how these\ntechniques interact is limited, as their combined use can produce compounded or\nconflicting effects on performance. Static analysis tools estimating worst-case\nexecution times offer guidance for configuring mitigation techniques but often\nfail to capture the complexity of modern multi-core systems. They typically\nfocus on limited shared resources while neglecting others, such as IOMMUs and\ninterrupt controllers. To address these challenges, we present SP-IMPact, an\nopen-source framework for analyzing and guiding interference mitigation\nconfigurations. SP-IMPact supports (i) cache coloring and (ii) memory bandwidth\nreservation, while evaluating their interactions and cumulative impact. By\nproviding insights on real hardware, SP-IMPact helps optimize configurations\nfor mixed-criticality systems, ensuring performance and predictability.",

The framework employs a\nmulti-granularity approach, integrating global and regional spatial information\nthrough a Global State Encoder, an Intra-Regional Functionality Encoder, and an\nInter-Regional Interaction Encoder to comprehensively model brain activity.\nAdditionally, we introduce a discrete codebook mechanism for constructing\nnetwork structures via vector quantization, ensuring compact and meaningful\nbrain network representations while mitigating over-smoothing and enhancing\nmodel generalization. The proposed framework effectively captures the dynamic\nand diverse nature of EEG signals, enabling robust emotion recognition.\nExtensive comparisons and analyses demonstrate the effectiveness of MIND-EEG,\nand the source code is publicly available at\nhttps://anonymous.4open.science/r/MIND_EEG.",

The ability to trace the origin of an image/video can aid law\nenforcement agencies in gathering evidence and constructing the timeline of\nevents. Moreover, identifying the owner of a certain device narrows down the\narea of search in a criminal investigation where smartphone devices are\ninvolved. This paper proposes a new pixel-based method for source camera\nidentification, integrating Pixel Difference Convolution (PDC) with a Vision\nTransformer network (ViT), and named PDC-ViT. While the PDC acts as the\nbackbone for feature extraction by exploiting Angular PDC (APDC) and Radial PDC\n(RPDC). These techniques enhance the capability to capture subtle variations in\npixel information, which are crucial for distinguishing between different\nsource cameras. The second part of the methodology focuses on classification,\nwhich is based on a Vision Transformer network. Unlike traditional methods that\nutilize image patches directly for training the classification network, the\nproposed approach uniquely inputs PDC features into the Vision Transformer\nnetwork. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the PDC-ViT approach, it has been\nassessed on five different datasets, which include various image contents and\nvideo scenes. The method has also been compared with state-of-the-art source\ncamera identification methods. Experimental results demonstrate the\neffectiveness and superiority of the proposed system in terms of accuracy and\nrobustness when compared to its competitors. For example, our proposed PDC-ViT\nhas achieved an accuracy of 94.30%, 84%, 94.22% and 92.29% using the Vision\ndataset, Daxing dataset, Socrates dataset and QUFVD dataset, respectively.",

The correlations build\nover a finite time period, culminating in an intense, directional emission of\nphotons known as superradiance. For a collection of atoms undergoing uniform\nlinear acceleration, we identify low-acceleration conditions under which the\nbuildup of correlations occurs faster and is driven solely by the modified\nfield fluctuations underlying the Unruh effect - a prediction that a uniformly\naccelerated observer experiences the inertial vacuum as a thermal state. We\ndemonstrate that these conditions can be realized inside a sub-resonant cavity\nthat highly suppresses the response of an inertial atom, while still allowing\nsignificant response from an accelerated atom as, owing to the\nacceleration-induced spectral broadening, it can still couple to the available\nfield modes. The field fluctuations perceived inertially under the sub-resonant\ncavity configuration would cause a superradiant burst much later.

The dilute Glasma\nenergy-momentum tensor can efficiently be evaluated numerically on a lattice.\nEmploying a generalized 3D McLerran-Venugopalan model, we discuss numerical\nresults for the collisions of heavy ions at energies corresponding to\nexperiments at RHIC and the LHC. We discover longitudinal flow that differs\nsignificantly from Bjorken flow and argue that this is a consequence of taking\ninto account the longitudinal extension of nuclei. Furthermore, we find\nlimiting fragmentation as a universal feature of the dilute Glasma analytically\nand numerically. Finally, we study the applicability of the dilute Glasma to\nproton-proton collisions and show the necessary modifications to reproduce\nexperimental multiplicity distributions.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising capabilities in visually\ninterpreting medical time-series data. However, their general-purpose design\ncan limit domain-specific precision, and the proprietary nature of many models\nposes challenges for fine-tuning on specialized clinical datasets. Conversely,\nsmall specialized models (SSMs) offer strong performance on focused tasks but\nlack the broader reasoning needed for complex medical decision-making. To\naddress these complementary limitations, we introduce \\ConMIL{} (Conformalized\nMultiple Instance Learning), a novel decision-support framework distinctively\nsynergizes three key components: (1) a new Multiple Instance Learning (MIL)\nmechanism, QTrans-Pooling, designed for per-class interpretability in\nidentifying clinically relevant physiological signal segments; (2) conformal\nprediction, integrated with MIL to generate calibrated, set-valued outputs with\nstatistical reliability guarantees; and (3) a structured approach for these\ninterpretable and uncertainty-quantified SSM outputs to enhance the visual\ninspection capabilities of LLMs. Our experiments on arrhythmia detection and\nsleep stage classification demonstrate that \\ConMIL{} can enhance the accuracy\nof LLMs such as ChatGPT4.0, Qwen2-VL-7B, and MiMo-VL-7B-RL. For example,\n\\ConMIL{}-supported Qwen2-VL-7B and MiMo-VL-7B-RL both achieves 94.92% and\n96.82% precision on confident samples and (70.61% and 78.02%)/(78.10% and\n71.98%) on uncertain samples for the two tasks, compared to 46.13% and 13.16%\nusing the LLM alone. These results suggest that integrating task-specific\nmodels with LLMs may offer a promising pathway toward more interpretable and\ntrustworthy AI-driven clinical decision support.",

    "abstract": "Neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, and several defenses\nhave been proposed. Designing a robust network is a challenging task given the\nwide range of attacks that have been developed. Therefore, we aim to provide\ninsight into the influence of network similarity on the success rate of\ntransferred adversarial attacks. Network designers can then compare their new\nnetwork with existing ones to estimate its vulnerability. To achieve this, we\ninvestigate the complex relationship between network similarity and the success\nrate of transferred adversarial attacks. We applied the Centered Kernel\nAlignment (CKA) network similarity score and used various methods to find a\ncorrelation between a large number of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and\nadversarial attacks. Network similarity was found to be moderate across\ndifferent CNN architectures, with more complex models such as DenseNet showing\nlower similarity scores due to their architectural complexity. Layer similarity\nwas highest for consistent, basic layers such as DataParallel, Dropout and\nConv2d, while specialized layers showed greater variability. Adversarial attack\nsuccess rates were generally consistent for non-transferred attacks, but varied\nsignificantly for some transferred attacks, with complex networks being more\nvulnerable. We found that a DecisionTreeRegressor can predict the success rate\nof transferred attacks for all black-box and Carlini & Wagner attacks with an\naccuracy of over 90%, suggesting that predictive models may be viable under\ncertain conditions. However, the variability of results across different data\nsubsets underscores the complexity of these relationships and suggests that\nfurther research is needed to generalize these findings across different attack\nscenarios and network architectures.",

Suffering\nfrom inefficient hole doping and low hole mobility, quantum oscillations in\np-type GaN have not been observed, hindering fundamental studies of valence\nbands and hole transport in GaN. Here, we present the first observation of\nquantum oscillations of holes in GaN. Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) oscillations in\nhole resistivity are observed in a quantum-confined two-dimensional hole gas at\na GaN/AlN interface, where polarization-induced doping overcomes thermal\nfreeze-out, and a sharp and clean interface boosts the hole mobility enough to\nunmask the quantum oscillations. These holes degenerately occupy the light and\nheavy hole bands of GaN and have record-high mobilities of ~1900 cm2/Vs and\n~400 cm2/Vs at 3K, respectively. We use magnetic fields up to 72 T to resolve\nSdH oscillations of holes from both valence bands to extract their respective\nsheet densities, quantum scattering times, and the effective masses of light\nholes (0.5-0.7 m0) and heavy holes (1.9 m0). SdH oscillations of heavy and\nlight holes in GaN constitute a direct metrology of valence bands and open new\nvenues for quantum engineering in this technologically important semiconductor.\nLike strained silicon transistors, strain-engineering of the valence bands of\nGaN is predicted to dramatically improve hole mobilities by reducing the hole\neffective mass, a proposal that can now be explored experimentally,\nparticularly in a fully fabricated transistor, using quantum oscillations.\nFurthermore, the findings of this work suggest a blueprint to create 2D hole\ngases and observe quantum oscillations of holes in related wide bandgap\nsemiconductors such as SiC and ZnO in which such techniques are not yet\npossible.",

The operating system (OS) plays a\nvital role in identifying tasks suitable for offloading and coordinating\nbetween the CPU and FPGA for seamless task execution. The OS leverages\npreemption to manage CPU efficiently and balance CPU time; however, preempting\ntasks running on FPGAs without context loss remains challenging. Despite\ngrowing reliance on FPGAs, vendors have yet to deliver a solution that fully\npreserves and restores task context. This paper presents EPOCH, the first\nout-of-the-box framework to seamlessly preserve the state of tasks running on\nmulti-tenant cloud FPGAs. EPOCH enables interrupting a tenant's execution at\nany arbitrary clock cycle, capturing its state, and saving this 'state\nsnapshot' in off-chip memory with fine-grain granularity. Subsequently, when\ntask resumption is required, EPOCH can resume execution from the saved 'state\nsnapshot', eliminating the need to restart the task from scratch. EPOCH\nautomates intricate processes, shields users from complexities, and\nsynchronizes all underlying logic in a common clock domain, mitigating timing\nviolations and ensuring seamless handling of interruptions. EPOCH proficiently\ncaptures the state of fundamental FPGA elements, such as look-up tables,\nflip-flops, block--RAMs, and digital signal processing units.

    "abstract": "The classification of radio-frequency (RF) signals is crucial for\napplications in robotics, traffic control, and medical devices. Spintronic\ndevices, which respond to RF signals via ferromagnetic resonance, offer a\npromising solution. Recent studies have shown that a neural network of\nnanoscale magnetic tunnel junctions can classify RF signals without\ndigitization. However, the complexity of these junctions poses challenges for\nrapid scaling. In this work, we demonstrate that simple spintronic devices,\nknown as metallic spin-diodes, can effectively perform RF classification. These\ndevices consist of NiFe/Pt bilayers and can implement weighted sums of RF\ninputs. We experimentally show that chains of four spin-diodes can execute 2x2\npixel filters, achieving high-quality convolutions on the Fashion-MNIST\ndataset. Integrating the hardware spin-diodes in a software network, we achieve\na top-1 accuracy of 88 \\% on the first 100 images, compared to 88.4 \\% for full\nsoftware with noise, and 90 \\% without noise.",

    "abstract": "Crystallization of the lunar magma ocean yielded a chemically unique liquid\nresiduum named KREEP. This component is expressed as a large patch on the near\nside of the Moon, and a possible smaller patch in the northwest portion of the\nMoon's South Pole-Aitken basin on the far side. Thermal models estimate that\nthe crystallization of the lunar magma ocean (LMO) could have spanned from 10\nand 200 Myr, while studies of radioactive decay systems have yielded\ninconsistent ages for the completion of LMO crystallization covering over 160\nMyr. Here, we show that the Moon achieved over 99 percent crystallization at\n4429+/-76 Myr, indicating a lunar formation age of 4450 Myr or possibly older.\nUsing the 176Lu-176Hf decay system (t1/2=37 Gyr), we found that the initial\n176Hf/177Hf ratios of lunar zircons with varied U-Pb ages are consistent with\ntheir crystallization from a KREEP-rich reservoir with a consistently low\n176Lu/177Hf ratio of 0.0167 that emerged ~140 Myr after solar system formation.\nThe previously proposed younger model age of 4.33 Ga for the source of mare\nbasalts (240 Myr after solar system formation) might reflect the timing of a\nlarge impact. Our results demonstrate that lunar magma ocean crystallization\ntook place while the Moon was still battered by planetary embryos and\nplanetesimals leftover from the main stage of planetary accretion. Study of\nLu-Hf model ages for samples brought back from the South Pole-Aitken basin will\nhelp to assess the lateral continuity of KREEP and further understand its\nsignificance in the early history of the Moon.",

In this article, we build a conceptual understanding of the\nimpact of spatial heterogeneities on the pattern dynamics of reaction-diffusion\nmodels. We consider the simplest setting of an explicit, scalar, bi-stable\nAllen-Cahn equation driven by a general small-amplitude spatially-heterogeneous\nterm $\\varepsilon F(U,U_x,x)$. In the first part, we perform an analysis of the\nexistence and stability of stationary one-, two- and $N$-front patterns for\ngeneral spatial heterogeneity $F(U,U_x,x)$. In addition, we explicitly\ndetermine the $N$-th order system of ODEs that governs the evolution of the\nfront positions of general $N$-front patterns to leading order. In the second\npart, we focus on a particular class of spatial heterogeneities where\n$F(U,U_x,x) = H'(x) U_x + H''(x) U$ with $H$ either spatially periodic or\nlocalised. For spatially periodic heterogeneities, we show that the fronts of a\nmulti-front pattern will get `pinned' if the distances between successive\nfronts are sufficiently large, {\\it i.e.}, the multi-front pattern is attracted\nto a nearby stable stationary multi-front pattern. For localised\nheterogeneities, we determine all stationary $N$-front patterns, and show that\nthese are unstable for $N > 1$.

This galaxy is affected by ram pressure stripping and it is\nhypothesised that UDG 32 may have formed from its stripped material. In this\npaper, we address whether UDG 32 can be associated with the stripped material\nof NGC 3314A and constrain its formation scenario in relation to its\nenvironment. We use new integral-field spectroscopic data from the MUSE large\nprogramme `LEWIS' in conjunction with deep multi-band photometry to constrain\nthe kinematics and stellar populations of UDG 32. The new MUSE data allow us to\nreveal that the stripped material from NGC 3314A, traced by emission lines such\nas H$\\alpha$, extends much further from its parent galaxy than previously\nknown, completely overlapping with UDG 32 in projection, and with ram pressure\ninduced star formation. We determine the line-of-sight velocity of UDG 32\n($v_{\\rm LOS} = 3080\\pm120$ km/s) and confirm that UDG 32 is part of the same\nkinematic structure as NGC 3314A, the Hydra I cluster south-east subgroup. By\nfitting the UV and optical spectral energy distribution, we constrain the\nstellar population properties of UDG 32. We determine its mass-weighted age to\nbe $7.7^{+2.9}_{-2.8}$ Gyr and its metallicity to be [M/H] =\n$0.07^{+0.19}_{-0.32}$ dex. We confirm the presence of two globular clusters\n(GCs) in the MUSE field of view, bound to the Hydra I cluster rather than to\nUDG 32, thus part of the Hydra I intracluster GC population. The metal-rich and\nintermediate-age nature of UDG 32 points towards its formation from\npre-enriched material in the south-east group of the Hydra I cluster that was\nliberated from a more massive galaxy via tidal or ram-pressure stripping, but\nwe cannot establish a direct link to the ram-pressure stripped material from\nNGC 3314A.",

    "abstract": "Fixing Python dependency issues is a tedious and error-prone task for\ndevelopers, who must manually identify and resolve environment dependencies and\nversion constraints of third-party modules and Python interpreters. Researchers\nhave attempted to automate this process by relying on large knowledge graphs\nand database lookup tables. However, these traditional approaches face\nlimitations due to the variety of dependency error types, large sets of\npossible module versions, and conflicts among transitive dependencies. This\nstudy explores the potential of using large language models (LLMs) to\nautomatically fix dependency issues in Python programs. We introduce PLLM\n(pronounced \"plum\"), a novel technique that employs retrieval-augmented\ngeneration (RAG) to help an LLM infer Python versions and required modules for\na given Python file. PLLM builds a testing environment that iteratively (1)\nprompts the LLM for module combinations, (2) tests the suggested changes, and\n(3) provides feedback (error messages) to the LLM to refine the fix. This\nfeedback cycle leverages natural language processing (NLP) to intelligently\nparse and interpret build error messages. We benchmark PLLM on the Gistable\nHG2.9K dataset, a collection of challenging single-file Python gists. We\ncompare PLLM against two state-of-the-art automatic dependency inference\napproaches, namely PyEGo and ReadPyE, w.r.t. the ability to resolve dependency\nissues. Our results indicate that PLLM can fix more dependency issues than the\ntwo baselines, with +218 (+15.97%) more fixes over ReadPyE and +281 (+21.58%)\nover PyEGo. Our deeper analyses suggest that PLLM is particularly beneficial\nfor projects with many dependencies and for specific third-party numerical and\nmachine-learning modules. Our findings demonstrate the potential of LLM-based\napproaches to iteratively resolve Python dependency issues.",

To derive\nthe spatially-resolved stellar kinematics, we first apply the Voronoi\ntessellation algorithm to bin the spaxels in the datacube and then follow the\nsame prescription adopted for the 1D case. In addition, we extract the velocity\nprofiles along the galaxy's major and minor axes. Results: We find that 7 out\nof 18 UDGs in LEWIS show a mild rotation, 5 do not have evidence of any\nrotation, and the remaining 6 UDGs are unconstrained cases. This is the first\nlarge census of velocity profiles for UDGs. On average, UDGs in LEWIS are\ncharacterised by low values of $\\sigma_{\\rm eff}$, comparable with available\nvalues from the literature. In the Faber-Jackson relation plane, we found a\ngroup of UDGs consistent with the relation within the errorbars, whereas\noutliers are objects with non-negligible rotation components. UDGs and LSBs in\nLEWIS have larger dark matter content than dwarf galaxies with similar total\nluminosity. We do not find clear correlations between the derived properties\nand the local environment. Conclusions: Based on the stellar kinematics, two\nclasses of UDGs are found in the Hydra I cluster: the rotating and non-rotating\nsystems. This result, combined with other structural properties, can help to\ndiscriminate between the several formation scenarios proposed for UDGs.",

    "abstract": "Modeling the heat capacity of liquids present fundamental difficulties due to\nthe strong intermolecular particle interactions and large diffusive-like\ndisplacements. Based on the experimental evidence that the microscopic dynamics\nof liquids closely resemble those of solids, a phonon theory of liquid\nthermodynamics has been developed. Despite its success, the phonon theory of\nliquids relies on the questionable assumption that low-frequency shear\nexcitations are propagating in nature and follow a Debye density of states.\nFurthermore, the same framework does not capture the contribution of\nintramolecular vibrations, which play a significant role in molecular liquids.\nIn this work, we revisit the phonon theory of liquid heat capacity, introducing\nalternative approaches to model low-frequency shear modes. In particular, we\nconsider the recently proposed idea of treating such modes as pure kinetic and\nwe propose a novel approach based on identifying those low-frequency\nexcitations as overdamped liquid-like modes with linear in frequency density of\nstates. Moreover, we complete the theory by incorporating the effects of\nintramolecular vibrations. By comparing the theoretical predictions from these\ndifferent approaches with the available data for the heat capacity of several\nliquids, we present a comprehensive evaluation of the original model and the\nnewly proposed extensions. Despite all approaches perform well at\nlow-temperatures, our results indicate that modeling low-frequency modes as\noverdamped liquid-like excitations yields the most accurate agreement with the\ndata in the whole temperature range. Conversely, we demonstrate that treating\nthese excitations as purely gas-like leads to significant inaccuracies,\nparticularly at high temperatures.",

    "abstract": "Melting is often understood in purely equilibrium terms, where crystalline\norder disappears once the free energy of the solid equals that of the liquid.\nYet at the microscopic level, the initiating events for melting can often be\ntraced to the formation of defects or local ``jumps'' over interatomic\nbarriers. In this work, we offer a unified interpretation of melting by\nfocusing on the equilibrium fraction of particles whose energy exceeds a\ncharacteristic barrier \\(E_a\\). We show that when this fraction surpasses a\nsmall but critical threshold \\cite{Feder1958,Kraftmakher1998} (on the order of\n\\(10^{-4}\\)-\\(10^{-3}\\)), the crystal loses its rigidity, thus reconciling\nBorn's mechanical-instability picture with the older Lindemann notion of large\natomic displacements. We derive this threshold condition from standard\nBoltzmann (and Bose/Fermi) statistics, ensuring consistency with standard\nthermodynamics. Our approach naturally extends to vortex lattices in\nsuperconductors (where vortex activation energies play the role of \\(E_a\\)) and\nto quantum-lattice systems (Hubbard-type models). Crucially, while the\ninterpretation emphasizes barrier crossing, the criterion itself is built on\nequilibrium statistical mechanics, offering a transparent link between defect\nformation rates and the macroscopic transition.",

    "abstract": "Vision Transformers (ViTs) have recently taken computer vision by storm.\nHowever, the softmax attention underlying ViTs comes with a quadratic\ncomplexity in time and memory, hindering the application of ViTs to\nhigh-resolution images. We revisit the attention design and propose a linear\nattention method to address the limitation, which doesn't sacrifice ViT's core\nadvantage of capturing global representation like existing methods (e.g. local\nwindow attention of Swin). We further investigate the key difference between\nlinear attention and softmax attention. Our empirical results suggest that\nlinear attention lacks a fundamental property of concentrating the distribution\nof the attention matrix. Inspired by this observation, we introduce a local\nconcentration module to enhance linear attention. By incorporating enhanced\nlinear global attention and local window attention, we propose a new ViT\narchitecture, dubbed L$^2$ViT. Notably, L$^2$ViT can effectively capture both\nglobal interactions and local representations while enjoying linear\ncomputational complexity. Extensive experiments demonstrate the strong\nperformance of L$^2$ViT. On image classification, L$^2$ViT achieves 84.4% Top-1\naccuracy on ImageNet-1K without any extra training data or label. By further\npre-training on ImageNet-22k, it attains 87.0% when fine-tuned with resolution\n384$^2$.

    "abstract": "Music source separation is an audio-to-audio retrieval task of extracting one\nor more constituent components, or composites thereof, from a musical audio\nmixture. Each of these constituent components is often referred to as a \"stem\"\nin literature. Historically, music source separation has been dominated by a\nstem-based paradigm, leading to most state-of-the-art systems being either a\ncollection of single-stem extraction models, or a tightly coupled system with a\nfixed, difficult-to-modify, set of supported stems. Combined with the limited\ndata availability, advances in music source separation have thus been mostly\nlimited to the \"VDBO\" set of stems: \\textit{vocals}, \\textit{drum},\n\\textit{bass}, and the catch-all \\textit{others}. Recent work in music source\nseparation has begun to challenge the fixed-stem paradigm, moving towards\nmodels able to extract any musical sound as long as this target type of sound\ncould be specified to the model as an additional query input. We generalize\nthis idea to a \\textit{query-by-region} source separation system, specifying\nthe target based on the query regardless of how many sound sources or which\nsound classes are contained within it. To do so, we propose the use of\nhyperellipsoidal regions as queries to allow for an intuitive yet easily\nparametrizable approach to specifying both the target (location) as well as its\nspread. Evaluation of the proposed system on the MoisesDB dataset demonstrated\nstate-of-the-art performance of the proposed system both in terms of\nsignal-to-noise ratios and retrieval metrics.",

We compute and quantify for the first time\nthe influence of the dust torque on the evolution of growing planetary embryos\nas they move in a protoplanetary disk while growing via gas and pebble\naccretion. Our global model evolves the gaseous disk via viscous accretion and\nX-ray photoevaporation, while accounting for dust growth and evolution\nincluding coagulation, drift, and fragmentation. Our research indicates that\ndust torque significantly influences planetary migration, particularly driving\nsubstantial outward migration for planets forming within the water ice-line.\nThis effect occurs due to an increased dust-to-gas mass ratio in the inner\ndisk, resulting from inward pebble drift from outer regions. In contrast, for\nplanets initially located beyond the water ice-line, the dust torque mitigates\ninward migration but does not significantly alter their paths, as the\ndust-to-gas ratio diminishes rapidly due to rapid pebble drift and the brief\ntimescales of planet formation in these areas. These findings underscore the\npivotal role of dust torque in shaping the migration patterns of low- and\nintermediate-mass planets, especially when enhanced dust concentrations in the\ninner disk amplify its effects",

The classical\nSylvester problem asks to determine the probability that the convex hull of\nthese points, denoted by $P:= [X_1,\\ldots, X_{d+2}]$, is a simplex. In the\npresent paper, we study a refined version of this problem which asks to\ndetermine the probability that $P$ has a given combinatorial type. It is known\nthat there are $\\lfloor d/2\\rfloor+1$ possible combinatorial types of\nsimplicial $d$-dimensional polytopes with at most $d+2$ vertices. These types\nare denoted by $T_0^d, T_1^d, \\ldots, T_{\\lfloor d/2 \\rfloor}^d$, where $T_0^d$\nis a simplex with $d+1$ vertices, while the remaining types have exactly $d+2$\nvertices. Our aim is thus to compute the probability $$ p_{d,m} := \\mathbb P[P\n\\text{ is of type } T_{m}^d], \\qquad m\\in \\{0,1,\\ldots, \\lfloor d/2 \\rfloor\\}.\n$$ The classical Sylvester problem corresponds to the case $m=0$. We shall\ncompute $p_{d,m}$ for all $m$ in the following cases: (a) $X_1,\\ldots, X_{d+2}$\nare i.i.d. normal; (b) $X_1,\\ldots, X_{d+2}$ follow a $d$-dimensional beta or\nbeta prime distribution, which includes the uniform distribution on the ball or\non the sphere as special cases; (c) $X_1,\\ldots, X_{d+2}$ form a random walk\nwith symmetrically exchangeable increments. As a by-product of case (a) we\nrecover a recent solution to Youden's demon problem which asks to determine the\nprobability that, in a one-dimensional i.i.d. normal sample $\\xi_1,\\ldots,\n\\xi_n$, the empirical mean $\\frac 1n (\\xi_1 + \\ldots + \\xi_n)$ lies between the\n$k$-th and the $(k+1)$-st order statistics.

However, the complex-valued\nspectra of typical non-Hermitian systems lead to instabilities, losses, and\nbreakdown of adiabaticity, which impedes the practical use of EP-induced energy\ntopologies in quantum information protocols based on state permutation\nsymmetries. Indeed, in a given non-Hermitian multiqubit system, the dynamical\nwinding around EPs always results in a predetermined set of attenuated final\neigenstates, due to the interplay of decoherence and non-adiabatic transitions,\nirrespective of the initial conditions. In this work, we address this\nlong-standing problem by introducing a model of interacting qubits governed by\nan effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian that hosts novel types of EPs while\nmaintaining a completely real energy spectrum, ensuring the absence of losses\nin the system's dynamics. We demonstrate that such non-Hermitian Hamiltonians\nenable the realization of genuine, in general, non-Abelian permutation groups\nin the multiqubit system's eigenspace while dynamically encircling these EPs.\nOur findings indicate that, contrary to previous beliefs, non-Hermiticity can\nbe utilized to achieve controlled topological state permutations in\ntime-modulated multiqubit systems, thus paving the way for the advancement and\ndevelopment of novel quantum information protocols in real-world non-Hermitian\nquantum systems.",

    "abstract": "In Production Scheduling, the Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problem (FJSSP)\naims to optimize a sequence of operations and assign each to an eligible\nmachine with varying processing times. For integration of the workforce, each\nmachine also requires a worker to be present to process an operation which\nadditionally affects the processing times. The resulting problem is called\nFlexible Job Shop Scheduling Problem with Worker Flexibility (FJSSP-W). The\nFJSSP has been approached with various problem representations, including Mixed\nInteger Linear Programming (MILP), Constrained Programming (CP), and\nSimulation-based Optimization (SBO). In the latter area in particular, there\nexists a large number of specialized Evolutionary Algorithms (EA) like Particle\nSwarm Optimization (PSO) or Genetic Algorithms (GA). Yet, the solvers are often\ndeveloped for single use cases only, and validated on a few selected test\ninstances, let alone compared with results from solvers using other problem\nrepresentations. While suitable approaches do also exist, the design of the\nFJSSP-W instances is not standardized and the algorithms are hardly comparable.\nThis calls for a systematic benchmarking environment that provides a\ncomprehensive set of FJSSP(-W) instances and supports targeted algorithm\ndevelopment. It will facilitate the comparison of algorithmic performance in\nthe face of different problem characteristics. The present paper presents a\ncollection of 402 commonly accepted FJSSP instances and proposes an approach to\nextend these with worker flexibility. In addition, we present a detailed\nprocedure for the evaluation of scheduling algorithms on these problem sets and\nprovide suitable model representations for this purpose. We provide complexity\ncharacteristics for all presented instances as well as baseline results of\ncommon commercial solvers to facilitate the validation of new algorithmic\ndevelopments.",

Building on this, a large-scale portrait matting dataset is created,\ntermed LD-Portrait-20K, with $20,051$ portrait foregrounds and high-quality\nalpha mattes. Extensive experiments demonstrated the value of the\nLD-Portrait-20K dataset, with models trained on it significantly outperforming\nthose trained on other datasets. In addition, comparisons with the chroma\nkeying algorithm and an ablation study on dataset capacity further confirmed\nthe effectiveness of the proposed matte creation approach. Further, the dataset\nalso contributes to state-of-the-art video portrait matting, implemented by\nsimple video segmentation and a trimap-based image matting model trained on\nthis dataset.",

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in deep learning methods have significantly improved the\nperformance of 3D Human Pose Estimation (HPE). However, performance degradation\ncaused by domain gaps between source and target domains remains a major\nchallenge to generalization, necessitating extensive data augmentation and/or\nfine-tuning for each specific target domain. To address this issue more\nefficiently, we propose a novel canonical domain approach that maps both the\nsource and target domains into a unified canonical domain, alleviating the need\nfor additional fine-tuning in the target domain. To construct the canonical\ndomain, we introduce a canonicalization process to generate a novel canonical\n2D-3D pose mapping that ensures 2D-3D pose consistency and simplifies 2D-3D\npose patterns, enabling more efficient training of lifting networks. The\ncanonicalization of both domains is achieved through the following steps: (1)\nin the source domain, the lifting network is trained within the canonical\ndomain; (2) in the target domain, input 2D poses are canonicalized prior to\ninference by leveraging the properties of perspective projection and known\ncamera intrinsics. Consequently, the trained network can be directly applied to\nthe target domain without requiring additional fine-tuning. Experiments\nconducted with various lifting networks and publicly available datasets (e.g.,\nHuman3.6M, Fit3D, MPI-INF-3DHP) demonstrate that the proposed method\nsubstantially improves generalization capability across datasets while using\nthe same data volume.",

    "abstract": "Multi-cloud environments enable a cost-efficient scaling of cloud-native\napplications across geographically distributed virtual nodes with different\npricing models. In this context, the resource fragmentation caused by frequent\nchanges in the resource demands of deployed microservices, along with the\nallocation or termination of new and existing microservices, increases the\ndeployment cost. Therefore, re-orchestrating deployed microservices on a\ncheaper configuration of multi-cloud nodes offers a practical solution to\nrestore the cost efficiency of deployment. However, the rescheduling procedure\ncauses frequent service interruptions due to the continuous termination and\nrebooting of the containerized microservices. Moreover, it may potentially\ninterfere with and delay other deployment operations, compromising the\nstability of the running applications. To address this issue, we formulate a\nmulti-objective integer linear programming (ILP) problem that computes a\nmicroservice rescheduling solution capable of providing minimum deployment cost\nwithout significantly affecting the service continuity. At the same time, the\nproposed formulation also preserves the quality of service (QoS) requirements,\nincluding latency, expressed through microservice co-location constraints.\nAdditionally, we present a heuristic algorithm to approximate the optimal\nsolution, striking a balance between cost reduction and service disruption\nmitigation.

Gallium alloys like\nEutectic Gallium Indium (EGaIn) are appealing due to their low melting point\nand high theoretical specific capacity. However, EGaIn electrodes are unstable\nin highly alkaline electrolytes due to Gallium oxide dissolution. In this\nletter, this bottleneck is addressed by introducing chemically stable films in\nwhich nanoscale droplets of EGaIn are coated with trace amounts of graphene\noxide (GO). It is demonstrated that a GO to EGaIn weight ratio as low as 0.01\nprovides enough protection for a thin film formed by GO EGaIn nanocomposite\nagainst significantly acidic or alkaline environments (pH 1-14). It is shown\nthat GO coating significantly enhances the surface stability in such\nenvironments, thus improving the energy storage capacity by over 10x.\nMicrostructural analysis confirms GO EGaIn composite stability and enhanced\nelectrochemical performance. Utilizing this, a thin film supercapacitor is\nfabricated. Results indicate that when coating the EGaIn with GO to EGaIn ratio\nof 0.001 the areal capacitance improves by 10 times, reaching 20.02 mF cm_2.\nThis breakthrough paves the way for advanced liquid metal-based thin film\nelectrodes, promising significant improvements in energy storage applications.",

The UCMGs, covering a wide range\nof DoR from 0.05 to 0.88, can be divided into three groups, according to how\nextreme their SFH was. The first group consists of 81 extreme relics\n($\\text{DoR}\\gtrsim0.6$) that have formed the totality of their stellar mass by\n$z\\sim2$ and have super-solar metallicities at all cosmic epochs. The second\ngroup ($0.3\\lesssim\\text{DoR}\\lesssim0.6$) contains 293 objects also\ncharacterised by peaked SFHs but with a small percentage of later-formed stars\nand with a variety of MEHs. The third group ($\\text{DoR}\\lesssim0.3$), has 56\nobjects that cannot be considered relics since they have extended SFHs and\nformed a non-negligible fraction ($>25\\%$) of their stellar mass at $z<2$. We\nconfirm that an efficient method of finding relics is to select UCMGs with\nlarge velocity dispersion values but we believe that the most efficient way is\nto select high velocity dispersion objects that also have super-solar\nmetallicities and high [Mg/Fe].",

This limitation\narises from their difficulty in capturing complex distributions and\nunderstanding feature relationships from sparse and limited data, along with\ntheir inability to grasp semantic feature relations. Recently, Large Language\nModels (LLMs) have shown potential in generating synthetic data samples through\nfew-shot learning and semantic understanding. However, they often suffer from\ninconsistent distribution and lack of diversity due to their inherent\ndistribution disparity with the target dataset. To address these challenges and\nenhance tabular data synthesis for recommendation tasks, we propose a novel\ntwo-stage framework named SampleLLM to improve the quality of LLM-based tabular\ndata synthesis for recommendations by ensuring better distribution alignment.\nIn the first stage, SampleLLM employs LLMs with Chain-of-Thought prompts and\ndiverse exemplars to generate data that closely aligns with the target dataset\ndistribution, even when input samples are limited. The second stage uses an\nadvanced feature attribution-based importance sampling method to refine feature\nrelationships within the synthesized data, reducing any distribution biases\nintroduced by the LLM. Experimental results on three recommendation datasets,\ntwo general datasets, and online deployment illustrate that SampleLLM\nsignificantly surpasses existing methods for recommendation tasks and holds\npromise for a broader range of tabular data scenarios.",

Considering the elastic anisotropy of\nFCC metals, the characteristics of dislocation motion are also anisotropic\n(i.e., dislocation character angle-dependent), which is expected to notably\ninfluence the overall evolution of the dislocation network, and consequently,\nthe plastic response of these materials. The aggregate influence of the\nanisotropy in the Peierls stress on the mechanical response of single crystal\nNi was investigated in the present work using discrete dislocation dynamics\nsimulations. Twenty initial dislocation networks, differing in their\nconfiguration and dislocation density, were deformed under uniaxial tension up\nto at least 0.9% strain, and the analysis of character-dependent dynamics\nshowed a suppression of plasticity only for segments of nearly screw character.\nWhile the increased screw component of the Peierls stress raised the initial\nstrain hardening rate, it also resulted in longer dislocation segments overall,\ncontrary to the reasoning that longer pinned segments exhibit a lower\nresistance to motion and might give a weaker response. A non-linear\nsuperposition principle is demonstrated to predict the hardening reasonably\nwell, considering the cumulative effects of forest and Peierls stress-related\nstrengthening. Further analysis of the network topology revealed a tendency to\nmaintain connectivity over the course of deformation for those networks\nsimulated using an unequal Peierls stress.

Such superlubric sliding ferroelectricity\nwidely exists in various similar sandwich trilayer systems where the\npolarizations stem from symmetry breaking in across-layer stacking\nconfigurations, and with ultralow barriers of superlubric sliding, their\nperformances for various applications are greatly enhanced compared with\nhomobilayer sliding ferroelectrics.",

By replacing the Vlasov vector on time-phase\nspace with a bivector on an 8--dimensional sub-bundle of the tangent bundle, we\ncreate a parameterisation free version of Vlasov theory. This has a number of\nadvantages, which include working for lightlike and ultra-relativistic\nparticles, non metric connections, and metric-free and premetric theories. It\nalso works for theories where no time-phase space can exist for topological\ntopological reasons.

    "abstract": "Context. Star clusters are often invoked as contributors to the flux of\nGalactic cosmic rays and as sources potentially able to accelerate particles to\n$\\sim$PeV energies. The gamma radiation with $E\\gtrsim$ TeV recently observed\nfrom selected star clusters has profound implications for the origin of\nGalactic cosmic rays.\n  Aims. We show that if the gamma rays observed from the Cygnus cocoon and\nWesterlund 1 are of hadronic origin, then the cosmic rays escaping the cluster\nat energies $\\gtrsim$ 10 TeV must cross a grammage inside the cluster that\nexceeds the Galactic grammage. At lower energies, depending on the model\nadopted to describe the production of gamma rays, such grammage may exceed or\nbe comparable with the grammage inferred from propagation on Galactic scales.\n  Methods. The flux of gamma rays is analytically computed for a few models of\ninjection of cosmic rays in star clusters, and compared with the flux measured\nfrom selected clusters.\n  Results. In all models considered here, comparing the inferred and observed\ngamma ray fluxes at $E\\gtrsim$ TeV, we conclude that CRs must traverse a large\ngrammage inside or around the cluster before escaping. Clearly these\nimplications would not apply to a scenario in which gamma rays are produced due\nto radiative losses of leptons in the cluster. Leptonic models typically\nrequire weaker magnetic fields, which in turn result in maximum energies of\naccelerated particles much below $\\sim$ PeV.\n  Conclusions. We conclude that if gamma ray emission in SCs is a generic\nphenomenon and if this radiation is due to hadronic interactions, either star\nclusters cannot contribute but a small fraction of the total cosmic ray flux at\nthe Earth, or their contribution to the grammage cannot be neglected and the\nparadigm of Galactic transport should be profoundly revisited.",

We\npresent a theoretical framework identifying three core objectives for this\nmechanism - Decentralization, MEV capture, and Block Producer Incentive\nCompatibility - alongside practical metrics for evaluating each objective. To\nmeet these goals, we explore seven key design parameters: ticket quantity,\nexpiry, refundability, resalability, enhanced lookahead, pricing mechanism, and\ntarget ticket amount.\n  We then evaluate four pricing mechanisms and construct six concrete mechanism\ndesigns from these parameters. To assess trade-offs in real-world conditions,\nwe perform an agent-based simulation with over 300 runs. Our findings suggest\nthat auction-driven formats, particularly second-price, excel in capturing\nsignificant MEV. The simulation also indicates that offering a secondary market\ncan help alleviate centralization, since specialized ticket holders can enter\nand exit the market as needed.\n  Non-expiring tickets show promise in reducing valuation risks, as ticket\nholders are not influenced by expiry-related discounting. Likewise, removing\nrefundability simplifies the mechanism without notably impairing performance.\nExtended lookahead periods benefit price predictability and smoothness at a\nslight cost to price accuracy.\n  Overall, this study provides a theoretical framework on the mechanism design\nspace for Execution Tickets as well as a practical implementation of an\nagent-based simulation to test mechanism design choices.

In a\nmulti-agent setup with heterogeneous loss functions, this oversight may lead to\nunfair outcomes, hence resulting in conflicts during the reconciliation\nprocess. To address this, we propose a value-oriented forecast reconciliation\napproach that focuses on the forecast value for individual agents. Fairness is\nensured through the use of a Nash bargaining framework. Specifically, we model\nthis problem as a cooperative bargaining game, where each agent aims to\noptimize their own gain while contributing to the overall reconciliation\nprocess. We then present a primal-dual algorithm for parameter estimation based\non empirical risk minimization. From an application perspective, we consider an\naggregated wind energy trading problem, where profits are distributed using a\nweighted allocation rule. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach\nthrough several numerical experiments, showing that it consistently results in\nincreased profits for all agents involved.",

    "abstract": "Flow models are effective at progressively generating realistic images, but\nthey generally struggle to capture long-range dependencies during the\ngeneration process as they compress all the information from previous time\nsteps into a single corrupted image. To address this limitation, we propose\nintegrating autoregressive modeling -- known for its excellence in modeling\ncomplex, high-dimensional joint probability distributions -- into flow models.\nDuring training, at each step, we construct causally-ordered sequences by\nsampling multiple images from the same semantic category and applying different\nlevels of noise, where images with higher noise levels serve as causal\npredecessors to those with lower noise levels. This design enables the model to\nlearn broader category-level variations while maintaining proper causal\nrelationships in the flow process. During generation, the model\nautoregressively conditions the previously generated images from earlier\ndenoising steps, forming a contextual and coherent generation trajectory.\nAdditionally, we design a customized hybrid linear attention mechanism tailored\nto our modeling approach to enhance computational efficiency. Our approach,\ntermed ARFlow, achieves 6.63 FID scores on ImageNet at 256 * 256 without\nclassifier-free guidance, reaching 1.96 FID with classifier-free guidance 1.5,\noutperforming the previous flow-based model SiT's 2.06 FID.

    "abstract": "This chapter is interested in the epistemology of algorithms. As I intend to\napproach the topic, this is an issue about epistemic justification. Current\napproaches to justification emphasize the transparency of algorithms, which\nentails elucidating their internal mechanisms -- such as functions and\nvariables -- and demonstrating how (or that) these produce outputs. Thus, the\nmode of justification through transparency is contingent on what can be shown\nabout the algorithm and, in this sense, is internal to the algorithm. In\ncontrast, I advocate for an externalist epistemology of algorithms that I term\ncomputational reliabilism (CR). While I have previously introduced and examined\nCR in the field of computer simulations ([42, 53, 4]), this chapter extends\nthis reliabilist epistemology to encompass a broader spectrum of algorithms\nutilized in various scientific disciplines, with a particular emphasis on\nmachine learning applications. At its core, CR posits that an algorithm's\noutput is justified if it is produced by a reliable algorithm. A reliable\nalgorithm is one that has been specified, coded, used, and maintained utilizing\nreliability indicators. These reliability indicators stem from formal methods,\nalgorithmic metrics, expert competencies, cultures of research, and other\nscientific endeavors. The primary aim of this chapter is to delineate the\nfoundations of CR, explicate its operational mechanisms, and outline its\npotential as an externalist epistemology of algorithms.",

In this paper,\nwe aim to attain robustness in AirComp aggregation against interference via\nreconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) technology to artificially reconstruct\nwireless environments. Concretely, we establish performance objectives tailored\nfor interference suppression in wireless FL systems, aiming to achieve unbiased\ngradient estimation and reduce its mean square error (MSE). Oriented at these\nobjectives, we introduce the concept of phase-manipulated favorable propagation\nand channel hardening for AirFL, which relies on the adjustment of RIS phase\nshifts to realize statistical interference elimination and reduce the error\nvariance of gradient estimation. Building upon this concept, we propose two\nrobust aggregation schemes of power control and RIS phase shifts design, both\nensuring unbiased gradient estimation in the presence of interference.\nTheoretical analysis of the MSE and FL convergence affirms the\nanti-interference capability of the proposed schemes. It is observed that\ncomputation and interference errors diminish by an order of\n$\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\frac{1}{N}\\right)$ where $N$ is the number of RIS elements,\nand the ideal convergence rate without interference can be asymptotically\nachieved by increasing $N$.

To establish dust polarisation as a reliable\ntool, the physics of the grain alignment process needs to be studied\nthoroughly. The Magnetically enhanced Radiative Torque (MRAT) alignment is the\nonly mechanism that can induce highly efficient alignment of grains with\nmagnetic fields required by polarisation observations of the diffuse\ninterstellar medium. Our numerical modelling of dust polarisation using the\nMRAT theory demonstrated that the alignment efficiency of starlight\npolarisation ($p_{\\rm ext}/A_{\\rm V}$) and the degree of thermal dust\npolarisation ($p_{\\rm em}$) first decrease slowly with increasing visual\nextinction ($A_{\\rm V}$) and then falls steeply as $\\propto A^{-1}_{\\rm V}$ at\nlarge $A_{\\rm V}$ due to the loss of grain alignment, which explains the\nphenomenon known as polarisation holes. Visual extinction at the transition\nfrom shallow to steep slope ($A^{\\rm loss}_{\\rm V}$) increases with the maximum\ngrain size. By applying physical profiles suitable for a starless core 109 in\nthe Pipe Nebula (Pipe-109), our model successfully reproduces the existing\nobservations of starlight polarisation at R-band ($0.65\\,\\mu$m) and H-band\n($1.65\\,\\mu$m), as well as emission polarisation at submillimetre\n($870\\,\\mu$m). Successful modelling of observational data requires perfect\nalignment of large grains as evidence of the MRAT mechanism, and larger maximum\nsize with higher elongation at higher $A_{\\rm V}$.

The\nTokenized Shift Block optimizes feature representation by shifting and\ncapturing deep features through a combination of the Spatial Shift Block and\ndepthwise separable convolutions. Dynamic adjustment of the loss weights at\neach layer approaches the optimal solution and enhances training stability.

Our\napproach is grounded on the premise that low-level text style changes can\ncompose any high-level style. We hypothesize that applying this concept to\nrepresentation learning enables the development of versatile text style\nembeddings. By fine-tuning a general-purpose text encoder using contrastive\nlearning and standard cross-entropy loss, we aim to capture these low-level\nstyle shifts, anticipating that they offer insights applicable to high-level\ntext styles.

However, the motifs previously considered are\neither limited to a handful of nodes and edges, or do not include triangles,\nwhich are thought to be of critical relevance to understand the dynamics of\nsocial systems. Thus, we introduce a new class of motifs, that include these\ntriangles, are not limited in their number of nodes or edges, and yet can be\nmined efficiently in any temporal network. Referring to these motifs as the\nedge-centered motifs, we show analytically how they subsume the Egocentric\nTemporal Neighborhoods motifs of the literature. We also confirm in empirical\ndata that the edge-centered motifs bring relevant information with respect to\nthe Egocentric motifs by using a principle of maximum entropy. Then, we show\nhow mining for the edge-centered motifs in a network can be used to probe for\nspatial correlations in the underlying dynamics that have produced that\nnetwork. We deduce an approximate formula for the distribution of the\nedge-centered motifs in empirical networks of social face-to-face interactions.\nIn the last section of this paper, we explore how the statistics of the\nedge-centered motifs can be used to infer the complete topology of the network\nthey were sampled from.

In this work we consider a rotating impurity,\nwith the aim of exploring how angular momentum is exchanged with the\nsurrounding bosonic environment. In order to elucidate this issues, we employ a\nquasiparticle approach based on the angulon theory, which allows us to\neffectively deal with the non-trivial algebra of quantized angular momentum in\npresence of a many-body environment. We uncover how impurity dressing by\nenvironmental excitations can establish an exchange channel, whose\neffectiveness crucially depends on the initial state of the impurity.\nRemarkably, we find that there is a critical value of initial angular momentum,\nabove which this channel effectively freezes.",

The adaptation of\nCLIP to the task presents two primary challenges: learning more fine-grained\nfeatures to enhance discriminative ability, and learning more domain-invariant\nfeatures to improve the model's generalization capabilities. To mitigate the\nfirst challenge thereby enhance the ability to learn fine-grained features, a\nthree-stage strategy is proposed to boost the accuracy of text descriptions.\nInitially, the image encoder is trained to effectively adapt to person\nre-identification tasks. In the second stage, the features extracted by the\nimage encoder are used to generate textual descriptions (i.e., prompts) for\neach image. Finally, the text encoder with the learned prompts is employed to\nguide the training of the final image encoder. To enhance the model's\ngeneralization capabilities to unseen domains, a bidirectional guiding method\nis introduced to learn domain-invariant image features. Specifically,\ndomain-invariant and domain-relevant prompts are generated, and both positive\n(pulling together image features and domain-invariant prompts) and negative\n(pushing apart image features and domain-relevant prompts) views are used to\ntrain the image encoder.

    "abstract": "Latent Gaussian Models (LGMs) are a subset of Bayesian Hierarchical models\nwhere Gaussian priors, conditional on variance parameters, are assigned to all\neffects in the model. LGMs are employed in many fields for their flexibility\nand computational efficiency. However, practitioners find prior elicitation on\nthe variance parameters challenging because of a lack of intuitive\ninterpretation for them. Recently, several papers have tackled this issue by\nrethinking the model in terms of variance partitioning (VP) and assigning\npriors to parameters reflecting the relative contribution of each effect to the\ntotal variance. So far, the class of priors based on VP has been mainly\ndeployed for random effects and fixed effects separately. This work presents a\nnovel standardization procedure that expands the applicability of VP priors to\na broader class of LGMs, including both fixed and random effects. We describe\nthe steps required for standardization through various examples, with a\nparticular focus on the popular class of intrinsic Gaussian Markov random\nfields (IGMRFs). The practical advantages of standardization are demonstrated\nwith simulated data and a real dataset on survival analysis.",

Due to inherent algorithmic limitations, these interventions are most\nsuitable for cell-level determinations, not the more realistic multicellular\nsetting.

Particles become active in the gain region,\npassive in the loss region, and retain their state in the neutral region. By\nanalyzing the steady-state behavior as a function of particle number and the\nsize of the loss region, we identify a threshold particle number, below and\nabove which distinct structural changes are observed. Interestingly, below this\nthreshold, increasing the particle number reduces the state-switching time (the\ntime required for a particle to transition from active to passive and back to\nactive). In contrast, above the threshold, further increases in particle number\nresult in longer switching times. In the subthreshold regime, our analytical\nmodel predicts structural characteristics and switching dynamics that align\nwell with simulations.

In this paper, we study the flow of mass and metals in a\nstacked sample of 2770 isolated halos from the IllustrisTNG cosmological\nhydrodynamic simulation.

When scaling by virial radius\n($R_v$), large dynamical changes occur at $0.2R_v$ for most halos, suggesting a\ncharacteristic size for the inner galaxy. Despite radio mode feedback from\nblack holes being the primary quenching mechanism in IllustrisTNG, a small\npopulation of high mass radio mode disks are able to form stars.",

    "abstract": "Context: Bugs in code are inevitable and can lead to severe consequences,\nranging from security vulnerabilities to operational failures. Debugging\nsoftware remains challenging despite advances in testing and verification,\noften requiring extensive manual effort. Learning-based automated program\nrepair (APR) has shown promise in reducing the time, effort, and cost of\nmanually fixing bugs. However, existing techniques face several challenges,\nincluding language-dependent strategies, limited bug context utilization, and\ndifficulties in handling bugs that span multiple locations in the code.\n  Objective: This paper introduces MultiMend, a learning-based APR approach\ndesigned to improve repair performance on multiple programming languages with\nlanguage-independent context augmentation and multi-hunk patch generation.\n  Method: MultiMend fine-tunes a pre-trained encoder-decoder transformer model\n(CodeT5) to generate bug-fixing patches. It embeds source code lines and\napplies retrieval-augmented generation to augment the buggy context with\nrelevant lines during patch generation. The approach systematically constructs\npatches for multi-hunk bugs to reduce the needed patch validations. We evaluate\nMultiMend on four benchmarks with four programming languages and compare it\nwith state-of-the-art methods.\n  Results: Experimental results show that MultiMend achieves competitive\neffectiveness and efficiency against compared tools. Across all benchmarks,\nMultiMend fixes 2,077 bugs, of which 1,455 are identical to the developer's\npatch, and 106 are for multi-hunk bugs. Both context augmentation and\nmulti-hunk patch generation positively contribute to the results.\n  Conclusion: MultiMend shows promising performance across benchmarks. The\nfindings highlight its applicability to real-world software maintenance and its\npotential to reduce manual debugging efforts.",

    "abstract": "We consider not necessarily Lagrangian partial linear differential equations\n(PDE) with constant coefficients. Einstein proposed a definition of\nthe\"strength\" of such a field theory that defines its degree of freedom (DoF).\nEinsteinian strength is based on the asymptotic number of free Taylor series\ncoefficients of bounded degree in the general solution of the PDE system. The\ndirect count of DoF in this way is a complex and technically demanding process.\nProceeding from Einsteinian strength of equations and making use of commutative\nalgebra tools, we deduce another DoF count recipe which is formulated in terms\nof orders of the field equations, their gauge symmetries and gauge identities.\nThis DoF count recipe covers the case of reducible gauge field theories, and it\nis easy to use. We begin with interpreting the matrix of the system as a linear\nmap between polynomial modules. First, proceeding from Einsteinian definition,\nwe derive an explicit formula for DoF as the multiplicity of a certain\nextension module. Second, we prove another explicit formula for DoF in terms of\norders of equations and gauge generators. A notable consequence of this formula\nis that two Hermitian conjugate systems have identical DoF. Every classical\nfield theory defines the BRST complex which has the natural grading known as\nthe ghost number. We equip this complex with another grading, which we call\ndifferential order. This grading is 1 for every space time-derivative, while\nall thefields, ghosts, and antifields are assigned with this degree in a\ncertain way, depending on their ghost number and the orders of equations and\ngauge generators. We compute the Euler characteristic of the BRST complex with\nrespect to this new grading. This provides homological interpretation of DoF\nfor linear gauge system as minus the residue at infinity of the logarithmic\nderivative of the Euler characteristics for its BRST complex.",

The $L^2$ residue separation method was\nrecently introduced to eliminate spillover in the state-feedback control\ndesign. In this paper, we extend this method to finite-dimensional\noutput-feedback control, where the output is contaminated by the residual\nmodes. To deal with the output residue, we introduce a new harmonic inequality\nthat optimally bounds it. We develop the approach for a 1D heat equation with\nunknown nonlinearity, where boundary temperature measurements are used to\ncontrol heat flux at the opposite boundary.

In addition to promoting convergence to surfaces,\nthis formulation assigns explicit semantic meaning to 2D subsets of the\nradiance field, turning them into well-defined radiance surfaces. We finally\nextract a level set from this representation, which results in a high-quality\nradiance surface model.\n  Our method retains much of the speed and quality of the baseline algorithm.\nFor instance, a suitably modified variant of Instant NGP maintains comparable\ncomputational efficiency, while achieving an average PSNR that is only 0.1 dB\nlower.

    "abstract": "In this article, we present a novel box-covering algorithm for analyzing the\nfractal properties of complex networks. Unlike traditional algorithms that\nimpose a predetermined box size, our approach assigns nodes to boxes identified\nby their nearest local hubs without enforcing rigid distance constraints. This\nflexibility leads to a key methodological shift: instead of fixing the box size\nin advance, we first determine the number of boxes and then compute their\naverage size. We argue that this procedure is fully consistent with the\nrecently proposed scaling theory of fractal complex networks and closely\nrelated to the concept of hidden metric spaces in which network nodes are\nembedded. We demonstrate that our approach not only significantly reduces\ncomputational complexity compared to existing methods, but also (despite\nrelaxing constraints on box diameter) covers networks using boxes of more\nsimilar sizes than, for instance, the classical greedy coloring (GC) algorithm.\nTo evaluate the effectiveness of our method, we analyze nine complex networks\n(three model-based and six real-world) representing a broad spectrum: from\nnetworks with confirmed fractality, through those with initially uncertain, but\nhere confirmed, fractal properties (such as the Internet at the level of\nautonomous systems), to large-scale networks that have so far remained beyond\nthe reach of existing algorithms due to their size.",

However, the prevalent black-box Application\nProgramming Interface (API) access to many LLMs introduces significant\nchallenges in accountability, governance, and security. LLM fingerprinting,\nwhich aims to identify the source model by analyzing statistical and stylistic\nfeatures of generated text, offers a potential solution. Current progress in\nthis area is hindered by a lack of dedicated datasets and the need for\nefficient, practical methods that are robust against adversarial manipulations.\nTo address these challenges, we introduce FD-Dataset, a comprehensive bilingual\nfingerprinting benchmark comprising 90,000 text samples from 20 famous\nproprietary and open-source LLMs. Furthermore, we present FDLLM, a novel\nfingerprinting method that leverages parameter-efficient Low-Rank Adaptation\n(LoRA) to fine-tune a foundation model. This approach enables LoRA to extract\ndeep, persistent features that characterize each source LLM. Through our\nanalysis, we find that LoRA adaptation promotes the aggregation of outputs from\nthe same LLM in representation space while enhancing the separation between\ndifferent LLMs. This mechanism explains why LoRA proves particularly effective\nfor LLM fingerprinting. Extensive empirical evaluations on FD-Dataset\ndemonstrate FDLLM's superiority, achieving a Macro F1 score 22.1% higher than\nthe strongest baseline. FDLLM also exhibits strong generalization to newly\nreleased models, achieving an average accuracy of 95% on unseen models.\nNotably, FDLLM remains consistently robust under various adversarial attacks,\nincluding polishing, translation, and synonym substitution. Experimental\nresults show that FDLLM reduces the average attack success rate from 49.2%\n(LM-D) to 23.9%.",

BMAR needs no wireless communication between devices during\nruntime and does not require any specific user input, action, or behavior. BMAR\noperates on the data from devices worn by the same person that record\nbarometric pressure and acceleration - inexpensive, low-power, and thus\ncommonly included sensors in today's wearable devices. In its first stage, BMAR\nverifies that two recordings were acquired simultaneously and pre-aligns all\ndata traces. In a second stage, BMAR refines the alignment using acceleration\nmeasurements while accounting for clock skew between devices. In our\nevaluation, three to five body-worn devices recorded signals from the wearer\nfor up to ten hours during a series of activities. BMAR synchronized all signal\nrecordings with a median error of 33.4 ms and reliably rejected non-overlapping\nsignal traces. The worst-case activity was sleeping, where BMAR's second stage\ncould not exploit motion for refinement and, thus, aligned traces with a median\nerror of 3.06 s.",

    "abstract": "Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) often suffers from low spatial\nand angular resolution due to inherent limitations in imaging hardware and\nsystem noise, adversely affecting the accurate estimation of microstructural\nparameters with fine anatomical details. Deep learning-based super-resolution\ntechniques have shown promise in enhancing dMRI resolution without increasing\nacquisition time. However, most existing methods are confined to either spatial\nor angular super-resolution, limiting their effectiveness in capturing detailed\nmicrostructural features. Furthermore, traditional pixel-wise loss functions\nstruggle to recover intricate image details essential for high-resolution\nreconstruction. To address these challenges, we propose SARL-dMRI, a novel\nSpatial-Angular Representation Learning framework for high-fidelity, continuous\nsuper-resolution in dMRI. SARL-dMRI explores implicit neural representations\nand spherical harmonics to model continuous spatial and angular\nrepresentations, simultaneously enhancing both spatial and angular resolution\nwhile improving microstructural parameter estimation accuracy. To further\npreserve image fidelity, a data-fidelity module and wavelet-based frequency\nloss are introduced, ensuring the super-resolved images remain consistent with\nthe original input and retain fine details. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat, compared to five other state-of-the-art methods, our method significantly\nenhances dMRI data resolution, improves the accuracy of microstructural\nparameter estimation, and provides better generalization capabilities.

    "abstract": "The random packing fraction of binary particles in D-dimensional Euclidean\nspace R^D is studied using a geometric approach. First, the binary packing\nfraction of assemblies with small size difference are studied, using the\nexcluded volume model by Onsager for particles in three-dimensional space (D =\n3). According to this model the packing increase by bidispersity is\nproportional to (1 - f)(u^D - 1)^2, with f as monosized packing fraction, u as\nsize ratio and D as space dimension. The model predictions are compared with\ncomputational results for disks in two dimensions (D = 2) and hyperspheres in\nthe large-dimension limit (D to infinity), yielding good agreement.\nSubsequently, the packing of hyperspheres with large size difference is\nmodeled, employing the classic theory of Furnas. This theory, developed for\nthree dimensions, starts from an infinite size ratio of larger and smaller\nparticles (u to infinity). Here, the pertaining equations are applied to\nhyperspheres, and successfully compared with computational results for\nhyperspheres in the large-dimension limit. Furthermore, an asymptotic\napproximation of the binary packing fraction for large size ratio is derived,\nwhich shows that the first order variation of the Furnas packing fraction (u^-1\n= 0) is proportional to (2 - f)u^-1. Finally, a scaled D-dimensional binary\npacking graph is presented, governing a simplified phase diagram that borders\nthe binary random packing fraction of amorphous assemblies.

The periodic excitation arrangement\nresults in constructive interference of the SAW at wavelengths corresponding to\ninteger fractions of the line spacing. This leads to distinct peaks in the\nresponse spectrum, whose higher orders we term spatial harmonics of the SAW.\nThe known line spacing determines the wavelengths, allowing the peak\nfrequencies to be mapped to discrete points on the SAW dispersion curve,\neffectively sampling the SAW at specific equidistant wavenumbers. By solving an\ninverse problem, a model can be fit to the experimental data to obtain\nproperties of the layered system. We demonstrate this technique on copper-clad\nepoxy laminate and roll-cladded aluminum alloy plates and compare our results\nwith dispersion relation scans and micrography. Additionally, we analyze the\nmethod's sensitivity to elastic parameters and layer thickness. This approach\noffers a viable alternative to established SAW scanning methods, particularly\nin scenarios where the trade-off of lower wavenumber sampling density is\nacceptable to achieve exceptionally fast measurements while avoiding moving\nparts.",

Rev. E 104, 015313\n(2021)] and demonstrates its ability to mitigate spurious errors associated\nwith the insufficient isotropy of standard first-neighbor lattices without the\ninclusion of any external correction terms. The hydrodynamic limit recovered by\nthe OReg scheme is derived for two equilibrium distribution functions, namely\nthe so-called thermal guided equilibrium and the popular second order\npolynomial equilibrium, to show that the OReg scheme yields macroscopic\ndynamics that are O(u) times more accurate than that of the bare BGK collision\nmodel. Specifically, we show that, with the guided equilibrium on the D2Q9\nstandard lattice, the OReg scheme inherently compensates for the insufficient\nlattice isotropy of the standard D2Q9 lattice by automatically adjusting the\nlattice viscosity, yielding O(u4) and O(u2) accurate kinetic models when\noperated at the reference and arbitrary temperatures respectively. Further, we\nalso show that the OReg scheme presents an O(u3) accurate kinetic model for the\nD2Q9 lattice when used with the second order polynomial equilibrium\nformulation. Thereafter, the accuracy of the OReg-guided-equilibrium kinetic\nmodel is numerically demonstrated for quasi-one-dimensional simulations of the\nrotated decaying shear wave and isothermal shocktube problems. The present work\nlays the theoretical foundation of a generic framework which can enable fully\nlocal, correction-free, nonlinear thermohydrodynamic LB simulations on standard\nlattices, thereby facilitating scalable simulations of physically challenging\nfluid flows.",

A key challenge in these scenarios is balancing the trade-off between\nadapting to new, personalized classes and maintaining the performance of the\nmodel on the original, base classes. Fine-tuning the model on novel classes\noften leads to the phenomenon of catastrophic forgetting, where the accuracy of\nbase classes declines unpredictably and significantly. In this paper, we\npropose a simple yet effective mechanism to address this challenge by\ncontrolling the trade-off between novel and base class accuracy. We\nspecifically target the ultra-low-shot scenario, where only a single example is\navailable per novel class. Our approach introduces a Novel Class Detection\n(NCD) rule, which adjusts the degree of forgetting a priori while\nsimultaneously enhancing performance on novel classes. We demonstrate the\nversatility of our solution by applying it to state-of-the-art Few-Shot\nClass-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) methods, showing consistent improvements\nacross different settings. To better quantify the trade-off between novel and\nbase class performance, we introduce new metrics: NCR@2FOR and NCR@5FOR.

This is accompanied by a field theory of\ncoupled order parameters formulated on symmetry principles, including\nnon-reciprocity, to capture the non-equilibrium dynamics.

To this end, Space Computing\nPower Networks (Space-CPN) emerges as a promising architecture to coordinate\nthe computing capability of satellites and enable on board data processing.\nNevertheless, due to the natural limitations of solar panels, satellite power\nsystem is difficult to meet the energy requirements for ever-increasing\nintelligent computation tasks of artificial neural networks.

Sharp ${\\lambda}$-shape transitions in $d(\\chi T)/dT$, $dM/dH$ and\nspecific heat data confirm the previously reported three-dimensional (3D)\nantiferromagnetic ordering at $T_N \\approx 2.25$ K. On application of a\nmagnetic field the N\\'eel temperature is found to decrease and variable field\nneutron diffraction experiments below $T_N$ at 1.6 K show an increase in both\nthe bond and angle distortion of the stretched diamond lattice with magnetic\nfield, indicating a potential magneto-elastic coupling effect.

Both in\nthe experiment one's performing and in one's data: is there something\ninteresting, reason to doubt one's data or suspect that one's theoretical\ndescription is insufficient? Many experiments developed for undergraduate\nteaching still focus on quantitative evaluation. Here we take an alternative\napproach where careful observation identifies the interesting qualitative\nbehaviour of a ball dropped with a water bottle balanced on top of it, but\nwhere numerical agreement with a simple theoretical model is impossible. Thus\n'success' occurs when students are satisfied with their efforts and the\ndevelopment of their experimental process. Laboratory note keeping can also be\nintroduced in a meaningful, non-formulaic way since students are making\nindependent observations and method changes. We describe pedagogical and\ndidactic considerations for the implementation of the experiment in a\nclassroom, including variations and extensions, and give examples of\nexperimental outcomes. We suggest that considering qualitative behaviour may be\na fruitful strategy for identifying experiments that are both amenable to\nstudent autonomy and embedding skills such as laboratory note keeping in a\nflexible and genuine way.",

Machine learning can accelerate this\nprocess, but struggle with weak generalizability, interpretability, and data\ndependency, as well as suffer in long-term prediction. To this end, we propose\na PDE-embedded network with multiscale time stepping (MultiPDENet), which fuses\nthe scheme of numerical methods and machine learning, for accelerated\nsimulation of flows. In particular, we design a convolutional filter based on\nthe structure of finite difference stencils with a small number of parameters\nto optimize, which estimates the equivalent form of spatial derivative on a\ncoarse grid to minimize the equation's residual. A Physics Block with a\n4th-order Runge-Kutta integrator at the fine time scale is established that\nembeds the structure of PDEs to guide the prediction. To alleviate the curse of\ntemporal error accumulation in long-term prediction, we introduce a multiscale\ntime integration approach, where a neural network is used to correct the\nprediction error at a coarse time scale. Experiments across various PDE\nsystems, including the Navier-Stokes equations, demonstrate that MultiPDENet\ncan accurately predict long-term spatiotemporal dynamics, even given small and\nincomplete training data, e.g., spatiotemporally down-sampled datasets.\nMultiPDENet achieves the state-of-the-art performance compared with other\nneural baseline models, also with clear speedup compared to classical numerical\nmethods.",

But while the principles of RAI are clear\nand shared, RAI practices and auditing mechanisms are still incipient. A key\nchallenge is establishing metrics and benchmarks that define performance goals\naligned with RAI principles. This paper describes how the ITACA AI auditing\nplatform developed by Eticas.ai tackles demographic benchmarking when auditing\nAI recommender systems. To this end, we describe a Demographic Benchmarking\nFramework designed to measure the populations potentially impacted by specific\nAI models. The framework serves us as auditors as it allows us to not just\nmeasure but establish acceptability ranges for specific performance indicators,\nwhich we share with the developers of the systems we audit so they can build\nbalanced training datasets and measure and monitor fairness throughout the AI\nlifecycle. It is also a valuable resource for policymakers in drafting\neffective and enforceable regulations. Our approach integrates\nsocio-demographic insights directly into AI systems, reducing bias and\nimproving overall performance. The main contributions of this study include:1.\nDefining control datasets tailored to specific demographics so they can be used\nin model training; 2.

We propose MatCLIP, a novel method that extracts shape- and\nlighting-insensitive descriptors of Physically Based Rendering (PBR) materials\nto assign plausible textures to 3D objects based on images, such as the output\nof Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) or photographs. Matching PBR materials to\nstatic images is challenging because the PBR representation captures the\ndynamic appearance of materials under varying viewing angles, shapes, and\nlighting conditions. By extending an Alpha-CLIP-based model on material\nrenderings across diverse shapes and lighting, and encoding multiple viewing\nconditions for PBR materials, our approach generates descriptors that bridge\nthe domains of PBR representations with photographs or renderings, including\nLDM outputs. This enables consistent material assignments without requiring\nexplicit knowledge of material relationships between different parts of an\nobject. MatCLIP achieves a top-1 classification accuracy of 76.6%,\noutperforming state-of-the-art methods such as PhotoShape and MatAtlas by over\n15 percentage points on publicly available datasets.

    "abstract": "A commonly-used paradigm to estimate changes in the frequency of past events\nor the size of populations is to consider the occurrence rate of\narchaeological/environmental samples found at a site over time. The reliability\nof such a \"dates-as-data\" approach is highly dependent upon how the occurrence\nrates are estimated from the underlying samples, particularly when calendar age\ninformation for the samples is obtained from radiocarbon (14C). The most\nfrequently used \"14C-dates-as-data\" approach of creating Summed Probability\nDistributions (SPDs) is not statistically valid, or coherent, and can provide\nhighly misleading inference. Here, we provide an alternative method with a\nrigorous statistical underpinning that also provides valuable additional\ninformation on potential changepoints in the rate of events. Furthermore,\nunlike current SPD alternatives, our summarisation approach does not restrict\nusers to pre-specified, rigid, summary formats (e.g., exponential or logistic\ngrowth) but instead flexibly adapts to the dates themselves. Our methodology\nensures more reliable \"14C-dates-as-data\" analyses, allowing us to better\nassess and identify potential signals present. We model the occurrence of\nevents, each assumed to leave a radiocarbon sample in the\narchaeological/environmental record, as an inhomogeneous Poisson process. The\nvarying rate of samples over time is then estimated within a fully-Bayesian\nframework using reversible-jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo (RJ-MCMC). Given a set\nof radiocarbon samples, we reconstruct how their occurrence rate varies over\ncalendar time and identify if that rate contains statistically-significant\nchanges, i.e., specific times at which the rate of events abruptly changes. We\nillustrate our method with both a simulation study and a practical example\nconcerning late-Pleistocene megafaunal population changes in Alaska and Yukon.",

While traditional Machine\nLearning (ML) models excel at predicting outcomes, such as identifying high\nrisk patients, they are limited in addressing what-if questions about\ninterventions. This study introduces the Probabilistic Causal Fusion (PCF)\nframework, which integrates Causal Bayesian Networks (CBNs) and Probability\nTrees (PTrees) to extend beyond predictions. PCF leverages causal relationships\nfrom CBNs to structure PTrees, enabling both the quantification of factor\nimpacts and simulation of hypothetical interventions. PCF was validated on\nthree real-world healthcare datasets i.e. MIMIC-IV, Framingham Heart Study, and\nDiabetes, chosen for their clinically diverse variables. It demonstrated\npredictive performance comparable to traditional ML models while providing\nadditional causal reasoning capabilities. To enhance interpretability, PCF\nincorporates sensitivity analysis and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP).\nSensitivity analysis quantifies the influence of causal parameters on outcomes\nsuch as Length of Stay (LOS), Coronary Heart Disease (CHD), and Diabetes, while\nSHAP highlights the importance of individual features in predictive modeling.\nBy combining causal reasoning with predictive modeling, PCF bridges the gap\nbetween clinical intuition and data-driven insights. Its ability to uncover\nrelationships between modifiable factors and simulate hypothetical scenarios\nprovides clinicians with a clearer understanding of causal pathways.

After a rapid rise in the first\nyear, the echo remains persistently at a high state from July 2017 to July\n2024, the latest epoch, and keeps an almost constant color. We have fitted the\nextraordinary IR emission with a refined dust echo model by taking into account\nthe dust sublimation process. The fitting suggests that an extremely giant dust\nstructure with a new inner radius of $\\sim1.6$ pc and an ultra-high peak\nbolometric luminosity, i.e., $\\sim6\\times10^{46} \\rm erg~s^{-1}$ for typical\n0.1$\\mu$m-sized silicate grain, is required to account for the IR echo. This\nwork highlights the distinctive value of IR echoes in measuring the accurate\nintrinsic bolometric luminosity, and thus the total radiated energy of TDEs,\nwhich could be severely underestimated by traditional methods, i.e. probably by\nmore than an order of magnitude in PS16dtm. Such large energetic output\ncompared to normal TDEs could be boosted by the pre-existing accretion disk and\ngas clouds around the black hole. Our model can be validated in the near future\nby IR time-domain surveys such as Near-Earth Object (NEO) Surveyor, given the\nrecent retirement of WISE.

The advancement of neural probes facilitates the\nrecording of a high number of neurons with an increase in channel counts,\narising a higher data volume and challenging the current on-chip spike sorters.\nThis paper introduces L-Sort, a novel on-chip spike sorting solution featuring\nmedian-of-median spike detection and localization-based clustering. By\ncombining the median-of-median approximation and the proposed incremental\nmedian calculation scheme, our detection module achieves a reduction in memory\nconsumption. Moreover, the localization-based clustering utilizes geometric\nfeatures instead of morphological features, thus eliminating the\nmemory-consuming buffer for containing the spike waveform during feature\nextraction. Evaluation using Neuropixels datasets demonstrates that L-Sort\nachieves competitive sorting accuracy with reduced hardware resource\nconsumption. Implementations on FPGA and ASIC (180 nm technology) demonstrate\nsignificant improvements in area and power efficiency compared to\nstate-of-the-art designs while maintaining comparable accuracy. If normalized\nto 22 nm technology, our design can achieve roughly $\\times 10$ area and power\nefficiency with similar accuracy, compared with the state-of-the-art design\nevaluated with the same dataset. Therefore, L-Sort is a promising solution for\nreal-time, high-channel-count neural processing in implantable devices.",

After perihelion,\ntwo additional outbursts were observed in summer 2024, at heliocentric\ndistances of $1.20\\,$au and $2.26\\,$au. Using observational data, we developed\na numerical model to estimate the mass ejected during these events, focusing on\nthe sublimation of ice through the porous cometary nucleus. The key factors\naffecting ejected mass estimates are the outburst amplitude and the active\nsurface area during both quiet sublimation and the outburst phases. Pogson's\nlaw was used to express outburst magnitude, incorporating scattering\ncross-sections of cometary agglomerates. The model iteratively determined the\nmass ejected in observed outbursts, considering various ice types (H$_{2}$O and\nCO$_{2}$) controlling sublimation activity. Our results indicate that the mass\nejected during these outbursts ranged from 10$^{10}$ to 10$^{13}$ kg.

    "abstract": "Long-tailed learning has garnered increasing attention due to its practical\nsignificance. Among the various approaches, the fine-tuning paradigm has gained\nconsiderable interest with the advent of foundation models. However, most\nexisting methods primarily focus on leveraging knowledge from these models,\noverlooking the inherent biases introduced by the imbalanced training data they\nrely on. In this paper, we examine how such imbalances from pre-training affect\nlong-tailed downstream tasks. Specifically, we find the imbalance biases\ninherited in foundation models on downstream task as parameter imbalance and\ndata imbalance. During fine-tuning, we observe that parameter imbalance plays a\nmore critical role, while data imbalance can be mitigated using existing\nre-balancing strategies. Moreover, we find that parameter imbalance cannot be\neffectively addressed by current re-balancing techniques, such as adjusting the\nlogits, during training, unlike data imbalance. To tackle both imbalances\nsimultaneously, we build our method on causal learning and view the incomplete\nsemantic factor as the confounder, which brings spurious correlations between\ninput samples and labels. To resolve the negative effects of this, we propose a\nnovel backdoor adjustment method that learns the true causal effect between\ninput samples and labels, rather than merely fitting the correlations in the\ndata. Notably, we achieve an average performance increase of about $1.67\\%$ on\neach dataset. Code is available:\nhttps://github.com/JiahaoChen1/Pre-train-Imbalance",

Current methodologies that process\nvideo frames sequentially struggle to maintain coherent tracking of objects,\nespecially when these objects temporarily vanish and later reappear in the\nfootage. A critical limitation of these approaches is their inability to\neffectively identify crucial moments in the video, largely due to their limited\ngrasp of temporal relationships. To overcome these obstacles, we present\nGraphVideoAgent, a cutting-edge system that leverages the power of graph-based\nobject tracking in conjunction with large language model capabilities. At its\ncore, our framework employs a dynamic graph structure that maps and monitors\nthe evolving relationships between visual entities throughout the video\nsequence. This innovative approach enables more nuanced understanding of how\nobjects interact and transform over time, facilitating improved frame selection\nthrough comprehensive contextual awareness. Our approach demonstrates\nremarkable effectiveness when tested against industry benchmarks. In\nevaluations on the EgoSchema dataset, GraphVideoAgent achieved a 2.2\nimprovement over existing methods while requiring analysis of only 8.2 frames\non average. Similarly, testing on the NExT-QA benchmark yielded a 2.0\nperformance increase with an average frame requirement of 8.1.

Significant attention has been given to the\nkernelizability aspects of this problem -- i.e., for which graphs $H$ does the\nproblem admit an \"efficient preprocessing\" procedure, known as a polynomial\nkernelization, where an instance $I$ of the problem with parameter $k$ is\nreduced to an equivalent instance $I'$ whose size and parameter value are\nbounded polynomially in $k$? Although such routines are known for many graphs\n$H$ where the class of $H$-free graphs has significant restricted structure, it\nis also clear that for most graphs $H$ the problem is incompressible, i.e.,\nadmits no polynomial kernelization parameterized by $k$ unless the polynomial\nhierarchy collapses. These results led Marx and Sandeep to the conjecture that\n$H$-free Edge Deletion is incompressible for any graph $H$ with at least five\nvertices, unless $H$ is complete or has at most one edge (JCSS 2022). This\nconjecture was reduced to the incompressibility of $H$-free Edge Deletion for a\nfinite list of graphs $H$. We consider one of these graphs, which we dub the\nprison, and show that Prison-Free Edge Deletion has a polynomial kernel,\nrefuting the conjecture. On the other hand, the same problem for the complement\nof the prison is incompressible.",

The proposed jump criterion is tested\nusing a 2D quasi-dynamic numerical simulations of the seismic cycle. The\ncriterion successfully predicts fault jumps where the coulomb stress change\nfails to do so. The criterion includes the coulomb stress change as a parameter\nbut is also dependent on other important parameters among which the absolute\nnormal stress on the fault which the rupture is to jump to. Based on the\ncriterion, the maximum jump distance increases with decreasing absolute normal\nstress, i.e. as the rupture process occurs closer to the surface or as pore\npressure increases. The criterion implies that an earthquake can jump to an\ninfinite distance at the surface if the normal stress is allowed to go to zero.\nThus, the properties of the surface layers are of the outmost importance in\nterms of maximum rupture jump distance allowed. The absolute normal stress is\nthe main controlling parameter followed by the uncertainty on the slip of an\nearthquake, which controls the coulomb stress impact on the receiver fault.\nFinally, we also propose a method to compute probabilities of earthquakes\nrupture to jump, which allows to consider uncertainties in geometrical\nconfigurations between two faults.",

To cope with this issue, focusing on the SP-based OTFS\nsystem in channel coded scenarios, we propose a novel pilot assignment scheme\nand an iterative algorithm. The proposed scheme allocates multiple SPs per\nframe to estimate channel coefficients accurately. Furthermore, the proposed\nalgorithm performs refined interference cancellation, utilizing a replica of\ndata symbols generated from soft-decision outputs provided by a decoder.\nAssuming fair and unified conditions, we evaluate each pilot assignment scheme\nin terms of reliability, channel estimation accuracy, effective throughput, and\ncomputational complexity. Our numerical simulations demonstrate that the\nmultiple SP-based scheme, which balances the transmission rate and the\ninterference cancellation performance, has the best throughput at the expense\nof slightly increased complexity.

This modified cosmological\nscenario is obtained by applying the gravity-thermodynamics conjecture to the\nUniverse apparent horizon, employing the Wald-Gauss-Bonnet entropy instead of\nthe standard Bekenstein Hawking one. Therefore, the modified Friedmann\nequations and the effective dark energy depend on the Gauss-Bonnet coupling\nconstant and on measured astrophysical parameters such as the black-hole\nformation rate and the black-hole progenitors average mass. Wald-Gauss-Bonnet\ntopological dark energy exhibits phantom behavior at intermediate redshifts for\npositive coupling constants, which is known to be a sufficient mechanism that\ncan lead to the $H_{0}$ tension alleviation. Indeed, we show that for\nparticular regions of the parameter space the scenario at hand does lead to\nhigher $H_{0}$ values, and we verify this result performing a confrontation\nwith observational data from Supernovae Type Ia (SNIa) and Cosmic Chronometers\n(CC) measurements. Additionally, analyzing the growth of structures and the\nevolution of the matter overdensity we show that the redshift behavior of the\n$f\\sigma_{8}$ observable obtains smaller values than the ones arising in\n$\\Lambda$CDM cosmology, and thus the scenario at hand can alleviate the\n$\\sigma_{8}$ tension too. This is an advantage of Wald-Gauss-Bonnet cosmology,\nsince the simultaneous alleviation of both tensions cannot be easily achieved\nwithin other entropic scenarios.",

Such strong storms are usually caused by a co-rotating\ninteraction region (CIR) passing at Earth or by the arrival of strong coronal\nmass ejections (CMEs). To mitigate the damage, the effect of propagating CMEs\nin the solar wind must be estimated accurately at Earth and other locations.\nModelling solar wind accurately is crucial for space weather predictions, as it\nis the medium for CME propagation. The Icarus heliospheric modelling tool is\nupgraded to handle dynamic inner heliospheric driving instead of using steady\nboundary conditions. The ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) solver and the\nautomated grid-adaptivity are adjusted to the latest MPI-AMRVAC version. The\ninner boundary conditions, prescribed at 0.1 AU for the heliospheric model, are\nupdated time-dependently throughout the simulation. The coronal model is\ncomputed repeatedly for selected magnetograms. The particle sampling within\nMPI-AMRVAC is extended to handle stretched spherical grid information. The\nsolar wind obtained in the simulation is dynamic and shows significant\nvariations throughout the evolution. When comparing the results with the\nobservations, the dynamic solar wind results are more accurate than previous\nresults obtained with purely steady boundary driving. The CMEs propagated\nthrough the dynamic solar wind background produce more similar signatures in\nthe time-series data than in the steady solar wind. Dynamic boundary driving in\nIcarus results in a more self-consistent solar wind evolution in the inner\nheliosphere. The obtained space weather modelling tool for dynamic solar wind\nand CME simulations is better suited for space weather forecasting than a\nsteady solar wind model.",

We aim to calculate\nwhen neutron stars in such systems can start to accrete matter from the stellar\nwind of the companion. We show that the transition from the ejector to the\npropeller stage occurs earlier in more eccentric systems, thus increasing the\ntime that neutron stars can spend accreting matter. Our calculations show that\nin the case of efficient spin-down at the propeller stage, a neutron star in an\neccentric orbit with $e\\gtrsim0.6$ and a standard magnetic field $B=10^{12}$ G\ncan start accreting within a few Gyr.

To address this limitation, we propose a\ncomprehensive simulation framework that jointly models RIS antenna design and\nthe communication process.

The results indicate that larger\narray sizes and higher baseband symbol frequencies exacerbate aperture fill\ntime effects, leading to increased BER. Furthermore, we examine BER variation\nwith respect to signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and propose an optimal\nmatching-based alignment algorithm, which significantly reduces BER compared to\nconventional pilot-based alignment methods.

    "abstract": "Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques have emerged as a promising\nsolution to enhance the reliability of large language models (LLMs) by\naddressing issues like hallucinations, outdated knowledge, and domain\nadaptation. In particular, existing RAG methods append relevant documents\nretrieved from external corpus or databases to the input of LLMs to guide their\ngeneration process, which we refer to as the in-context knowledge injection\nmethod. While this approach is simple and often effective, it has inherent\nlimitations. Firstly, increasing the context length and number of relevant\ndocuments can lead to higher computational overhead and degraded performance,\nespecially in complex reasoning tasks. More importantly, in-context knowledge\ninjection operates primarily at the input level, but LLMs store their internal\nknowledge in their parameters. This gap fundamentally limits the capacity of\nin-context methods. To this end, we introduce Parametric retrieval-augmented\ngeneration (Parametric RAG), a new RAG paradigm that integrates external\nknowledge directly into the parameters of feed-forward networks (FFN) of an LLM\nthrough document parameterization. This approach not only saves online\ncomputational costs by eliminating the need to inject multiple documents into\nthe LLMs' input context, but also deepens the integration of external knowledge\ninto the parametric knowledge space of the LLM. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that Parametric RAG substantially enhances both the effectiveness\nand efficiency of knowledge augmentation in LLMs. Also, it can be combined with\nin-context RAG methods to achieve even better performance.\n  We have open-sourced all the code, data, and models in the following\nanonymized GitHub link: https://github.com/oneal2000/PRAG",

Yet, their underlying properties, especially\nwhen functioning as feature extractors, remain under-explored. In this paper,\nwe investigate the sensitivity to audio effects of audio embeddings extracted\nfrom widely-used foundation models, including OpenL3, PANNs, and CLAP. We focus\non audio effects as the source of sensitivity due to their prevalent presence\nin large audio datasets. By applying parameterized audio effects (gain,\nlow-pass filtering, reverberation, and bitcrushing), we analyze the correlation\nbetween the deformation trajectories and the effect strength in the embedding\nspace. We propose to quantify the dimensionality and linearizability of the\ndeformation trajectories induced by audio effects using canonical correlation\nanalysis. We find that there exists a direction along which the embeddings move\nmonotonically as the audio effect strength increases, but that the subspace\ncontaining the displacements is generally high-dimensional. This shows that\npre-trained audio embeddings do not globally linearize the effects. Our\nempirical results on instrument classification downstream tasks confirm that\nprojecting out the estimated deformation directions cannot generally improve\nthe robustness of pre-trained embeddings to audio effects.",

The technique does not rely on\nalternate optimization nor hand-crafted gradient heuristics; rather, it jointly\noptimizes the width and the parameters of each layer via simple\nbackpropagation. We apply the technique to a broad range of data domains such\nas tables, images, text, sequences, and graphs, showing how the width adapts to\nthe task's difficulty.

We compute various thermoelectric\ncoefficients, including thermal conductance, thermopower, and the figure of\nmerit ($zT$), using the scattering matrix formalism. These results are further\nsupported by calculations based on a lattice-regularized version of the\neffective Hamiltonian. Additionally, we explore the impact of trigonal warping\nand valley polarization on the thermoelectric coefficients. Notably, we find a\nsignificant variation in $zT$ as a function of these parameters, reaching\nvalues as high as 2.5. Interestingly, we observe a violation of the\nWiedemann-Franz law near the charge neutrality point with the superconducting\ncorrelation, indicating that MATBG electrons behave as slow Dirac fermions in\nthis regime. This observation is further confirmed by the damped oscillatory\nbehavior of the thermal conductance as a function of the barrier strength when\nan insulating barrier is modelled at the interface of the NS junction.

This, however, raises\na fundamental question: Does the performance gain of MAs over conventional\nfixed-position antennas (FPAs) still exist in the presence of the IRS? To\nanswer this question, we investigate in this paper an IRS-assisted multi-user\nmultiple-input single-output (MISO) MA system, where a multi-MA base station\n(BS) transmits to multiple single-FPA users. We formulate a sum-rate\nmaximization problem by jointly optimizing the active/passive beamforming of\nthe BS/IRS and the MA positions within a one-dimensional transmit region, which\nis challenging to be optimally solved. To drive essential insights, we first\nstudy a simplified case with a single user. Then, we analyze the performance\ngain of MAs over FPAs in the light-of-sight (LoS) BS-IRS channel and derive the\nconditions under which this gain becomes more or less significant. In addition,\nwe propose an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm to solve the\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR) maximization problem in the single-user case by\ncombining the block coordinate descent (BCD) method and the graph-based method.\nFor the general multi-user case, our performance analysis unveils that the\nperformance gain of MAs over FPAs diminishes with typical transmit precoding\nstrategies at the BS under certain conditions. We also propose a high-quality\nsuboptimal solution to the sum-rate maximization problem by applying the AO\nalgorithm that combines the weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE)\nalgorithm, manifold optimization method and discrete sampling method. Numerical\nresults validate our theoretical analyses and demonstrate that the performance\ngain of MAs over FPAs may be reduced if the IRS passive beamforming is\noptimized.",

However, open-sourcing presents challenges, including potential\nmisuse, financial disincentives, and intellectual property concerns.\nProprietary models, backed by private sector resources, are better positioned\nfor return on investment.\n  There are also other approaches that lie somewhere on the spectrum between\ncompletely open-source and proprietary.

Recent works indicate that the\nconcurrent accretion onto a giant planet imposes significant impact on the\nplanetary migration dynamics in the isothermal regime. In this work, we carry\nout a series of 2D global hydrodynamical simulations with Athena++ to explore\nthe effect of thermodynamics on the concurrent accretion and migration process\nof the planets in a self-consistent manner. The thermodynamics effect is\nmodeled with a thermal relaxation timescale using a $\\beta$-cooling\nprescription. Our results indicate that radiative cooling has a substantial\neffect on the accretion and migration processes of the planet. As cooling\ntimescales increase, we observe a slight decrease in the planetary accretion\nrate, and a transition from the outward migrating into inward migration. This\ntransition occurs approximately when the cooling timescale is comparable to the\nlocal dynamical timescale ($\\beta\\sim1$), which is closely linked to the\nasymmetric structures from the circumplanetary disk (CPD) region. The\nasymmetric structures in the CPD region which appear with an efficient cooling\nprovide a strong positive torque driving the planet migrate outward. However,\nsuch a positive torque is strongly suppressed, when the CPD structures tend to\ndisappear with a relatively long cooling timescale ($\\beta\\gtrsim10$).

In this work, we propose to use a\nthermal thin-shell approximation (TSA) to improve the computational efficiency\nwhen solving the heat diffusion equation in two dimensions. We apply the method\nto compute the thermal transient response of superconducting accelerator\nmagnets used for CERN's Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and High-Luminosity LHC.\nThe TSA collapses thin electrical insulation layers into lines while accurately\nrepresenting the thermal gradient across the insulation's thickness. The TSA is\nimplemented in the multipole module of the open-source Finite Element Quench\nSimulator (FiQuS), which can generate the multipole magnet models\nprogrammatically from input text files. First, the TSA approach is verified by\ncomparison to classical FE simulations with meshed surface insulation regions\nfor a simple block of four cables and a detailed model of the MBH dipole. The\nresults show that the TSA approach reduces the computational time significantly\nwhile preserving the accuracy of the solution. Second, the quench heater (QH)\ndelay computed with the TSA method is compared to measurements for the MBH\nmagnet. To this end, the thermal transient simulation is coupled to a\nmagnetostatic solution to account for magneto-resistive effects. Third, the\nTSA's full capabilities are showcased in non-linear magneto-thermal simulations\nof several LHC and HL-LHC superconducting magnet models. The full source code,\nincluding all input files, is publicly available.",

    "abstract": "Time-limited space missions may miss rare occurrences of very dense clouds of\nlunar dust. At the same time, the information provided by the Earth-based\nmonitoring of the Moon during at least the last three centuries still remains\nunused. In the present study, we fill this data analysis gap. The survey of\nhistorical reports of the 18-19 centuries about supposed lunar atmosphere\nmanifestations, as well as the available data on too long-lasting stellar\noccultations by the lunar limb, enable us revealing numerous evidences of the\nlunar dust phenomena. By modeling of the conditions of such observations, we\ndetermine the geometrical parameters of the dust clouds, which scattered the\nsunlight during the particular events. Using this information, as well as the\nMie scattering theory, we estimate the concentration of dust and its damaging\neffect at different orbits of a possible spacecraft. It was found that the some\nobserved dust clouds of sub-micron grains could crash a space-vehicle at the\nlow (<10 km) altitudes, similar to the incidents with landers Vikram,\nBeresheet, Hakuto-R M1, Luna-25, etc. The statistics of dust clouds' appearance\nenabled a reconstruction of a typical shape of a local dust cloud which\nresembles the shape of an impact plume. This, together with the revealed\nseasonal periodicity of observational manifestations of the dust phenomena,\nconfirms a hypothesis on the meteoroid impact nature of the majority of the\ncircumlunar dust clouds. At the same time, the discovered additional\nperiodicity of the dust cloud appearance at half of synodic lunar month argue\nfor an additional non-impact source of the circumlunar dust, connected with the\nlunar outgassing events, controlled by the solar tidal effects, completely\nunstudied. Moreover, the tendency of dust clouds to be observed during the\nlow-level solar activity raises a question on possible dust pick up by the\nsolar wind flow.",

While R's\nbenchmarking tools are insufficient for measuring the execution times of C++\ncode segments, C++'s native profiling tools often come with a steep learning\ncurve. The rcpptimer package bridges this gap by offering a simple and\nefficient solution for timing C++ code within the Rcpp ecosystem. This novel\npackage introduces a user-friendly tic-toc class that supports overlapping and\nnested timers and OpenMP parallelism, providing nanosecond-level time\nresolution. Results, including summary statistics, are seamlessly passed back\nto R without requiring users to write any C++ code. This paper contextualizes\nthe rcpptimer package within the broader ecosystem of R and C++ profiling\ntools, explains the motivation behind its development, and offers a\ncomprehensive overview of its implementation. Supplementary to this paper, we\nprovide multiple vignettes that thoroughly explain this package's usage.",

To address the rarity issue, adversarial scenario\ngeneration methods are developed, in which behaviors of traffic participants\nare manipulated to induce safety-critical events. However, existing methods\nstill face two limitations. First, identification of the adversarial\nparticipant directly impacts the effectiveness of the generation. However, the\ncomplexity of real-world scenarios, with numerous participants and diverse\nbehaviors, makes identification challenging. Second, the potential of generated\nsafety-critical scenarios to continuously improve ADS performance remains\nunderexplored. To address these issues, we propose LLM-attacker: a closed-loop\nadversarial scenario generation framework leveraging large language models\n(LLMs). Specifically, multiple LLM agents are designed and coordinated to\nidentify optimal attackers. Then, the trajectories of the attackers are\noptimized to generate adversarial scenarios.

Experimental results show that LLM-attacker can create more dangerous\nscenarios than other methods, and the ADS trained with it achieves a collision\nrate half that of training with normal scenarios.

The effect of gravity on the observed polarization of a ray of\nelectromagnetic radiation is investigated for an arbitrary 4-dimensional\nspacetime and radiation with a frequency spectrum within the geometric optics\nlimit and with arbitrary state of polarization. Focusing on effects observable\nby a single inertial observer, we show how the presence of curvature along the\nnull geodesic of polarized electromagnetic radiation may induce observable\nchanges in the state of polarization. We find a set of scalars that quantify\nthe effect and derive their transport equations. Two of these scalars, the\npolarization degree and the circular polarization degree, are polarization\nstate observables that are conserved along the radiation geodesic. Four\nobservables that quantify time rate of change of the observed state of\npolarization are identified. These observables and their corresponding\ntransport equations provide a complete representation of how gravity affects\nthe observed state of polarization of electromagnetic radiation with\nfrequencies above the geometric optics limit. Polarization wiggling is sourced\nby curvature twist, which is a scalar derived from the Riemann tensor.\nCurvature twist is closely related to the magnetic part of the Weyl tensor, the\nsecond Weyl scalar as well as the rotation of the rest frame geodesic\ncongruence.

Our approach employs a similarity-based transfer function\ncharacterized by two parameters, $\\mathcal{R}=(r_1, r_2)$. Here, $r_1$\nquantifies the similarity of local activities, while $r_2$ governs the\nfiltration process used to convert a weighted network into a binary one. We\nreveal that the degree centrality distribution of the resulting network follows\na generalized Gamma distribution (GGD), which transitions to a power-law\ndistribution under specific conditions. The GGD exponents, estimated\nnumerically, exhibit a dependency on $\\mathcal{R}$. Notably, while both\ndecreasing $r_1$ and $r_2$ lead to denser networks, $r_2$ plays a more\nsignificant role in influencing network density. Furthermore, the Shannon\nentropy is observed to decrease linearly with increasing $r_2$, whereas its\nvariation with $r_1$ is more gradual. An analytical expression for the Shannon\nentropy is proposed. To characterize the network structure, we investigate the\nclustering coefficient ($cc$), eigenvalue centrality ($e$), closeness\ncentrality ($c$), and betweenness centrality ($b$). The distributions of $cc$,\n$e$, and $c$ exhibit peaked profiles, while $b$ displays a power-law\ndistribution over a finite interval of $k$.

    "abstract": "Controlling the spontaneous emission of nanoscale quantum emitters (QEs) is\ncrucial for developing advanced photon sources required in many areas of modern\nnanophotonics, including quantum information technologies. Conventional\napproaches to shaping photon emission are based on using bulky configurations,\nwhile approaches recently developed in quantum metaphotonics suffer from\nlimited capabilities in achieving desired polarization states and\ndirectionality, failing to provide on-demand photon sources tailored precisely\nto technological needs. Here, we propose a universal approach to designing\nversatile photon sources using on-chip QE-coupled meta-optics that enable\ndirect transformations of QE-excited surface plasmon polaritons into spatially\npropagating photon streams with arbitrary polarization states, directionality,\nand amplitudes via both resonance and geometric phases supplied by meta-atoms.\nLeveraging this platform, we experimentally demonstrate the independent\nengineering of polarization states, directionality, and relative amplitudes of\nphoton emission in single and multiple radiation channels. The developed\nuniversal approach represents a major step towards the realization of versatile\nquantum sources, highlighting the potential of integrated photon sources with\nsuperior properties for both classical and quantum information technologies.",

    "abstract": "Controllable affordance Hand-Object Interaction (HOI) generation has become\nan increasingly important area of research in computer vision. In HOI\ngeneration, the hand grasp generation is a crucial step for effectively\ncontrolling the geometry of the hand. Current hand grasp generation methods\nrely on 3D information for both the hand and the object. In addition, these\nmethods lack controllability concerning the hand's location and orientation. We\ntreat the hand pose as the discrete graph structure and exploit the geometric\npriors. It is well established that higher order contextual dependency among\nthe points improves the quality of the results in general. We propose a\nframework of higher order geometric representations (HOR's) inspired by\nspectral graph theory and vector algebra to improve the quality of generated\nhand poses. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed HOR's in devising\na controllable novel diffusion method (based on 2D information) for hand grasp\ngeneration that outperforms the state of the art (SOTA). Overcoming the\nlimitations of existing methods: like lacking of controllability and dependency\non 3D information. Once we have the generated pose, it is very natural to\nevaluate them using a metric. Popular metrics like FID and MMD are biased and\ninefficient for evaluating the generated hand poses.

Preprocessing was varied\nthrough skull-stripping and intensity binarization to isolate texture and shape\ncontributions. A 3D convolutional neural network was trained on each\nconfiguration, and classification performance was compared using exact McNemar\ntests with discrete Bonferroni-Holm correction. Feature relevance was analyzed\nusing Layer-wise Relevance Propagation, image similarity metrics, and spectral\nclustering of relevance maps.\n  Results: Despite substantial differences in image content, classification\naccuracy, sensitivity, and specificity remained stable across preprocessing\nconditions. Models trained on binarized images preserved performance,\nindicating minimal reliance on gray-white matter texture. Instead, volumetric\nfeatures -- particularly brain contours introduced through skull-stripping --\nwere consistently used by the models.\n  Conclusions: This behavior reflects a shortcut learning phenomenon, where\npreprocessing artifacts act as potentially unintended cues.

By employing a robust $\\chi^2$ fitting method, we simultaneously\ndetermined temperature and column density, achieving a $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratio\nof $18.72^{+1.54}_{-1.46}$ for the blue clump and $15.07^{+1.61}_{-1.60}$ for\nthe red clump. These results revealed significant discrepancies with the\ntraditional rotational diagram method, which overestimated the ratios by 12.1%\nand 23.9%, respectively. Our $\\chi^2$ approach also reduced uncertainties by up\nto 75%, providing more precise and reliable isotopic ratios.

    "abstract": "Effective traffic signal control (TSC) is crucial in mitigating urban\ncongestion and reducing emissions. Recently, reinforcement learning (RL) has\nbeen the research trend for TSC. However, existing RL algorithms face several\nreal-world challenges that hinder their practical deployment in TSC: (1) Sensor\naccuracy deteriorates with increased sensor detection range, and data\ntransmission is prone to noise, potentially resulting in unsafe TSC decisions.\n(2) During the training of online RL, interactions with the environment could\nbe unstable, potentially leading to inappropriate traffic signal phase (TSP)\nselection and traffic congestion. (3) Most current TSC algorithms focus only on\nTSP decisions, overlooking the critical aspect of phase duration, affecting\nsafety and efficiency. To overcome these challenges, we propose a robust\ntwo-stage fuzzy approach called FuzzyLight, which integrates compressed sensing\nand RL for TSC deployment. FuzzyLight offers several key contributions: (1) It\nemploys fuzzy logic and compressed sensing to address sensor noise and enhances\nthe efficiency of TSP decisions. (2) It maintains stable performance during\ntraining and combines fuzzy logic with RL to generate precise phases. (3) It\nworks in real cities across 22 intersections and demonstrates superior\nperformance in both real-world and simulated environments. Experimental results\nindicate that FuzzyLight enhances traffic efficiency by 48% compared to\nexpert-designed timings in the real world. Furthermore, it achieves\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in simulated environments using six\nreal-world datasets with transmission noise.

However, its\ndiscreteness can cause periodical online patterns and instability in recent\nstreaming recommendation systems. Recently, Interest Clock has achieved\nremarkable performance in streaming recommendation systems. Nevertheless, it\nmodels users' dynamic interests in a coarse-grained manner, merely encoding\nusers' discrete interests of 24 hours from short-term behaviors. In this paper,\nwe propose a fine-grained method for perceiving time information for streaming\nrecommendation systems, named Long-term Interest Clock (LIC). The key idea of\nLIC is adaptively calculating current user interests by taking into\nconsideration the relevance of long-term behaviors around current time (e.g., 8\na.m.) given a candidate item. LIC consists of two modules: (1) Clock-GSU\nretrieves a sub-sequence by searching through long-term behaviors, using query\ninformation from a candidate item and current time, (2) Clock-ESU employs a\ntime-gap-aware attention mechanism to aggregate sub-sequence with the candidate\nitem. With Clock-GSU and Clock-ESU, LIC is capable of capturing users' dynamic\nfine-grained interests from long-term behaviors. We conduct online A/B tests,\nobtaining +0.122% improvements on user active days. Besides, the extended\noffline experiments show improvements as well.

    "abstract": "Feature modeling, which involves feature representation learning and\nleveraging, plays an essential role in industrial recommendation systems.\nHowever, the data distribution in real-world applications usually follows a\nhighly skewed long-tail pattern due to the popularity bias, which easily leads\nto over-reliance on ID-based features, such as user/item IDs and ID sequences\nof interactions. Such over-reliance makes it hard for models to learn features\ncomprehensively, especially for those non-ID meta features, e.g., user/item\ncharacteristics. Further, it limits the feature leveraging ability in models,\ngetting less generalized and more susceptible to data noise. Previous studies\non feature modeling focus on feature extraction and interaction, hardly\nnoticing the problems brought about by the long-tail data distribution. To\nachieve better feature representation learning and leveraging on real-world\ndata, we propose a model-agnostic framework AdaF^2M^2, short for Adaptive\nFeature Modeling with Feature Mask. The feature-mask mechanism helps\ncomprehensive feature learning via multi-forward training with augmented\nsamples, while the adapter applies adaptive weights on features responsive to\ndifferent user/item states. By arming base models with AdaF^2M^2, we conduct\nonline A/B tests on multiple recommendation scenarios, obtaining +1.37% and\n+1.89% cumulative improvements on user active days and app duration\nrespectively.

Cost-saving calculations in which\nthe structure is optimized using reduced-quality Brillouin zone integrations\nand cutoff energies were found to lead to experimentally significant errors\nexceeding 0.1 eV in 18% of cases using the PBE functional and 21% of cases\nusing PBE0.

Given the\nTolman--Oppenheimer--Volkoff (TOV) equations, the equation of state (EoS) of\nthe neutron star (NS) matter can be constrained by the observations of NS mass,\nradius, and tidal deformability. However, large observational uncertainties and\nthe limited number of observations currently make it challenging to strictly\nreconstruct the EoS, especially to identify interesting features such as a\nstrong first-order phase transition. In this work, we study the dependency of\nreconstruction quality of the phase transition on the number of NS observations\nof mass and radius as well as their uncertainty, based on a fiducial EoS. We\nconquer this challenging problem by constructing a neural network, which allows\none to parametrize the EoS with minimum model-dependency, and by devising an\nalgorithm of parameter optimization based on the analytical linear response\nanalysis of the TOV equations.

    "abstract": "This paper examines labor market polarization through a comparative analysis\nof skill-based employment and wage distributions in India and the United States\nduring 2018-2023, with particular attention to differential automation risks\nand AI preparedness. Using detailed occupation-level data, automation risk\nmetrics, and a series of statistical tests including wage premium analysis,\nemployment share tests, and wage-employment regressions, we document\nsignificant structural differences in labor markets between developing and\ndeveloped economies. Our analysis yields four key findings. First, we find\nstatistically significant differences in employment distribution patterns, with\nIndia showing disproportionate concentration in low-skill employment compared\nto the US, particularly in occupations with high automation risk. Second,\nregression analysis reveals that wage premiums differ systematically between\nthe two countries, with significantly larger skill-based wage gaps in India.\nThird, we find robust evidence of a negative relationship between employment\nsize and wages, suggesting stronger labor supply effects in developing\neconomies. Fourth, analysis of occupation-specific automation risk reveals that\ndeveloping economies face a \"double vulnerability\" - concentration of\nemployment in both low-skill occupations and jobs with higher automation\npotential, complicated by lower AI preparedness scores. These findings provide\nnovel empirical evidence on how development stages influence labor market\npolarization patterns and carry important implications for skill development\nand technology adoption policies in developing economies. Our results suggest\nthat traditional approaches to labor market development may need significant\nmodification to account for the differential impacts of AI across development\nstages.",

In this work, we contend that a more general simulation requires\nreproducing statistics of joint measurements, potentially involving entangled\neffects, on Alice's system and an additional system held by Bob, even when\nBob's system state is unknown or entangled with a larger system.

    "abstract": "Leveraging deep learning (DL)-based code analysis tools to solve software\nengineering tasks is becoming increasingly popular. Code models often suffer\nperformance degradation due to various reasons (e.g., code data shifts).\nRetraining is often required to address these issues, but frequent model\nupdates are costly in labeling and deployment. In this paper, we explore an\nalternative solution: Adapting the program inputs to the code models. This can\nbe achieved by two steps: 1) input validation that focuses on identifying\nwhether an input is an out-of-scope input program that are beyond a model's\nhandling capability, and 2) input adaptation that adapts out-of-scope inputs to\nbecome in-scope inputs. Validating program input is challenging, as current\ntechniques focus on continuous inputs such as image data and fail with discrete\ninputs like code data, which have unique characteristics and are processed\ndifferently by deep learning models. Adapting out-of-scope programs is also\nchallenging due to their vast search spaces. Therefore, in this paper, we\npropose CodeImprove, which distinguishes out-of-scope from normal inputs and\nconverts such out-of-scope inputs back to in-scope inputs through program\ntransformation. In particular, we propose a validity score metric to identify\nout-of-scope inputs and leverage genetic algorithms to apply semantic\npreserving program transformation to convert out-of-scope inputs to in-scope\ninputs. Our experimental results show CodeImprove can enhance up to 8.78% of\naccuracy, and 51.28% of relative improvements in three code models on two SE\ntasks. Additionally, our input validation is promising in detecting\nout-of-scope inputs (AUC score of 0.924).",

In this work, we propose a causal inference approach to detect the\neffect of clinician implicit biases on patient outcomes in large-scale medical\ndata. Specifically, our method uses proximal mediation to disentangle\npathway-specific effects of a patient's sociodemographic attribute on a\nclinician's diagnosis decision. We test our method on real-world data from the\nUK Biobank. Our work can serve as a tool that initiates conversation and brings\nawareness to unequal health outcomes caused by implicit biases.",

    "abstract": "The rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies, including\nthe potential emergence of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and Artificial\nSuperintelligence (ASI), has raised concerns about AI surpassing human\ncognitive capabilities. To address this challenge, intelligence augmentation\napproaches, such as Brain Machine Interfaces (BMI) and Brain Organoid (BO)\nintegration have been proposed. In this study, we compare three intelligence\naugmentation strategies, namely BMI, BO, and a hybrid approach combining both.\nThese strategies are evaluated from three key perspectives that influence user\ndecisions in selecting an augmentation method: information processing capacity,\nidentity risk, and consent authenticity risk. First, we model these strategies\nand assess them across the three perspectives. The results reveal that while BO\nposes identity risks and BMI has limitations in consent authenticity capacity,\nthe hybrid approach mitigates these weaknesses by striking a balance between\nthe two. Second, we investigate how users might choose among these intelligence\naugmentation strategies in the context of evolving AI capabilities over time.\nAs the result, we find that BMI augmentation alone is insufficient to compete\nwith advanced AI, and while BO augmentation offers scalability, BO increases\nidentity risks as the scale grows. Moreover, the hybrid approach provides a\nbalanced solution by adapting to AI advancements. This study provides a novel\nframework for human capability augmentation in the era of advancing AI and\nserves as a guideline for adapting to AI development.",

Recent advancements in\nMultimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) hold promise for overcoming these\nlimitations by combining visual and textual information processing\ncapabilities.

However, use of\nthis analytically tractable minimizer leads to data memorization: in both\nunconditioned and conditioned settings, the generative model returns the\ntraining samples. This paper contains an analysis of the dynamical mechanism\nunderlying memorization. The analysis highlights the need for regularization to\navoid reproducing the analytically tractable minimizer; and, in so doing, lays\nthe foundations for a principled understanding of how to regularize. Numerical\nexperiments investigate the properties of: (i) Tikhonov regularization; (ii)\nregularization designed to promote asymptotic consistency; and (iii)\nregularizations induced by under-parameterization of a neural network or by\nearly stopping when training a neural network. These experiments are evaluated\nin the context of memorization, and directions for future development of\nregularization are highlighted.",

To achieve fair allocations, we develop two threshold-based\nonline algorithms, proving their optimality under two fairness notions and\nnear-optimality for the more challenging one. Additionally, we demonstrate a\nfundamental trade-off between group fairness and individual welfare using a\nnovel representative function-based approach.

We create a dataset consisting of\n6,000 images generated from three cutting-edge T2I models: Stable Diffusion XL,\nStable Diffusion 3, and Dreamlike Photoreal 2.0.

Our analysis\nreveals that all three T2I models show a preference for generating male images,\nwith SDXL being the most biased. Additionally, images generated using prompts\ncontaining professional descriptions (e.g., lawyer or doctor) show the most\nbias. We evaluate seven gender bias detectors and find that none fully capture\nthe actual level of bias in T2I models, with some detectors overestimating bias\nby up to 26.95%.

    "abstract": "Dissipation usually plays a negative role in quantum metrological\ntechnologies, which aim to improve measurement precision by leveraging quantum\neffects that are vulnerable to environment-induced decoherence. Recently, it\nhas been demonstrated that dissipation can actually be used as a favorable\nresource for enhancing the susceptibility of signal detection. However,\ndemonstrations of such enhancement for detecting physical quantities in open\nquantum systems are still lacking. Here we propose and demonstrate a protocol\nfor realizing such non-Hermitian quantum sensors for probing the coupling\nbetween a qubit and a resonator subjecting to energy dissipations. The\nexcitation-number conversion associated with the no-jump evolution trajectory\nenables removal of the noisy outcomes with quantum jumps, implementing the\nexceptional point (EP), where the Rabi splitting exhibits a divergent behavior\nin response to a tiny variation of the effective coupling. The sensitivity\nenhancement near the EP is confirmed by both theoretical calculation and\nexperimental measurement.",

This enabled the recent finding of an\nexplicit formula for the joint probability density between $1$ eigenvalue and\n$k$ singular values, coined $1,k$-point function. We derive here the large $n$\nasymptotic of the $1,k$-point function around the origin (hard edge) for a\nlarge subclass of bi-unitarily invariant ensembles called polynomial ensembles\nand its subclass P\\'olya ensembles.

To address\nthis, we leverage both explicit and implicit spatio-temporal priors of the\nhuman body through innovative model design and a pre-training proxy task.\nFirst, we propose a Nano Human Topology Network (NanoHTNet), a tiny 3D HPE\nnetwork with stacked Hierarchical Mixers to capture explicit features.\nSpecifically, the spatial Hierarchical Mixer efficiently learns the human\nphysical topology across multiple semantic levels, while the temporal\nHierarchical Mixer with discrete cosine transform and low-pass filtering\ncaptures local instantaneous movements and global action coherence. Moreover,\nEfficient Temporal-Spatial Tokenization (ETST) is introduced to enhance\nspatio-temporal interaction and reduce computational complexity significantly.\nSecond, PoseCLR is proposed as a general pre-training method based on\ncontrastive learning for 3D HPE, aimed at extracting implicit representations\nof human topology. By aligning 2D poses from diverse viewpoints in the proxy\ntask, PoseCLR aids 3D HPE encoders like NanoHTNet in more effectively capturing\nthe high-dimensional features of the human body, leading to further performance\nimprovements.

While research has largely\nfocused on developing specialized graph LLMs through task-specific instruction\ntuning, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating LLMs solely through prompt\ndesign remains surprisingly absent. Without such a carefully crafted evaluation\nbenchmark, most if not all, tailored graph LLMs are compared against general\nLLMs using simplistic queries (e.g., zero-shot reasoning with LLaMA), which can\npotentially camouflage many advantages as well as unexpected predicaments of\nthem. To achieve more general evaluations and unveil the true potential of LLMs\nfor graph tasks, we introduce Graph In-context Learning (GraphICL) Benchmark, a\ncomprehensive benchmark comprising novel prompt templates designed to capture\ngraph structure and handle limited label knowledge. Our systematic evaluation\nshows that general-purpose LLMs equipped with our GraphICL outperform\nstate-of-the-art specialized graph LLMs and graph neural network models in\nresource-constrained settings and out-of-domain tasks.

Prior analysis of this detokenization\nstage has predominantly relied on probing and interventions such as path\npatching, which involve selecting particular inputs, choosing a subset of\ncomponents that will be patched, and then observing changes in model behavior.\nHere, we show that several important aspects of the detokenization stage can be\nunderstood purely by analyzing model weights, without performing any model\ninference steps.

Our decomposition yields interpretable terms\nthat quantify the relative contributions of position-related, token-related,\nand mixed effects.

First, we replace metric entropy calculations with\nRademacher complexity bounds, enabling the analysis of neural networks without\nrequiring bounded weights or specific architectural constraints. Second, we\nweaken the regularity conditions on the target function to require only Sobolev\nspace membership $H^s([-1,1]^d)$ with $s > d/2$, significantly relaxing\nprevious smoothness assumptions while maintaining optimal approximation rates.\nThird, we introduce a modified sieve space construction based on moment bounds\nrather than weight constraints, providing a more natural theoretical framework\nfor modern deep learning practices. Our approach achieves these generalizations\nwhile preserving optimal convergence rates and establishing valid asymptotic\ndistributions for test statistics. The technical foundation combines\nlocalization theory, sharp concentration inequalities, and scale-insensitive\ncomplexity measures to handle unbounded weights and general Lipschitz\nactivation functions.

At the same time, an interplay between\nspin-orbit coupling and electron-electron interaction leads to a special type\nof collective excitations -- chiral-spin modes -- which are oscillations of\nspin polarization in the absence of a magnetic field. As a result, both\nEdelstein and inverse-Edelstein effects exhibit resonances at the frequencies\nof chiral-spin collective modes. Here, we present a detailed study of the\neffect of electron correlation on the resonances in Edelstein and\ninverse-Edelstein effects in a single-valley two-dimensional electron gas and\nin a multi-valley Dirac system with proximity-induced spin-orbit coupling.\nWhile the chiral-spin modes involve both in-plane and out-of-plane oscillations\nof spins, we show that only the in-plane modes are responsible for the above\nresonances. In the multi-valley system, electron correlation splits the\nin-plane modes into two. We study the spectral weight distribution between the\ntwo modes over a large parameter space of intra- and inter-valley interactions.\nFinally, we demonstrate that using the chiral-spin modes one can get a resonant\nenhancement of charge-to-spin conversion and gain a directional control of the\ninjected spins in the spin-pumping process, both of which are relevant to\nspintronics.",

If $x \\notin S$, it may still respond 'Yes' with\nprobability at most $\\varepsilon$.

We prove the first\nformal connection between the Filic and NOY models, showing that Filic\ncorrectness implies AB-test resilience.

    "abstract": "Z-stack scanning is an emerging whole slide imaging technology that captures\nmultiple focal planes alongside the z-axis of a glass slide. Because z-stacking\ncan offer enhanced depth information compared to the single-layer whole slide\nimaging, this technology can be particularly useful in analyzing small-scaled\nhistopathological patterns. However, its actual clinical impact remains debated\nwith mixed results. To clarify this, we investigate the effect of z-stack\nscanning on artificial intelligence (AI) mitosis detection of meningiomas. With\nthe same set of 22 Hematoxylin and Eosin meningioma glass slides scanned by\nthree different digital pathology scanners, we tested the performance of three\nAI pipelines on both single-layer and z-stacked whole slide images (WSIs).\nResults showed that in all scanner-AI combinations, z-stacked WSIs\nsignificantly increased AI's sensitivity (+17.14%) on the mitosis detection\nwith only a marginal impact on precision. Our findings provide quantitative\nevidence that highlights z-stack scanning as a promising technique for AI\nmitosis detection, paving the way for more reliable AI-assisted pathology\nworkflows, which can ultimately benefit patient management.",

The proposal consists in\ncomparing the performance of different control strategies in a laboratory\nsession, considering Matlab/Simulink simulations of the non-linear pendulum\nmodel. First, students attempt to make the pendulum stop at unstable\nequilibrium by controlling the torque input with a joystick connected to the\ncomputer via an Arduino board. Different friction scenarios are considered for\nstudents to explore the dissipation in the system response. Then, as a second\ntask, the Arduino is used to introduce the position reference, while students\nimplement different control strategies, such as Bang-Bang, PID\n(proportional-integral-derivative) and FPID (fractional PID) controllers,\nanalyzing the system response by inspecting the signals in a scope and in a 3D\nanimated model.

We demonstrate that for power-shaped inclined bathymetries, this\nproblem admits a complete solution for any $\\eta_0$ and $u_0$, provided the\nwave does not break.

In disk geometry, it was known that the interface energy has\nan extra correction due to its curvature which depends on the size of the disk.\nIn this work, we analytically calculate the energy of the integer quantum Hall\ninterface on a cone surface which has the advantage that its curvature is more\neasily adjustable. By tuning the length and curvature of the interface by the\ncone angle parameter $\\beta$, we analyze the dependence of the quantum Hall\ninterface energy on the curvature and verify this geometric correction.\nMoreover, we find that the tip of the cone geometry has an extra contribution\nto the energy that reflects on the $u_2,u_4$ term.",

The inherent variability of renewable\nsources and the complexity of prediction methods require robust approaches,\nsuch as DL models, in the renewable energy sector. DL models are preferred over\ntraditional machine learning (ML) because they capture complex, nonlinear\nrelationships in renewable energy datasets. This study examines key factors\ninfluencing DL technique accuracy, including sampling and hyperparameter\noptimization, by comparing various methods and training and test ratios within\na DL framework. Seven machine learning methods, LSTM, Stacked LSTM, CNN,\nCNN-LSTM, DNN, Time-Distributed MLP (TD-MLP), and Autoencoder (AE), are\nevaluated using a dataset combining weather and photovoltaic power output data\nfrom 12 locations. Regularization techniques such as early stopping, neuron\ndropout, L1 and L2 regularization are applied to address overfitting. The\nresults demonstrate that the combination of early stopping, dropout, and L1\nregularization provides the best performance to reduce overfitting in the CNN\nand TD-MLP models with larger training set, while the combination of early\nstopping, dropout, and L2 regularization is the most effective to reduce the\noverfitting in CNN-LSTM and AE models with smaller training set.",

Symbol emergence in robotics aims to develop a\nrobot that can adapt to real-world environments and human linguistic\ncommunications and acquire language from sensorimotor information alone (i.e.,\nin an unsupervised manner). This is regarded as a constructive approach to\nsymbol emergence systems. To this end, a series of PGMs have been developed,\nincluding those for simultaneous phoneme and word discovery, lexical\nacquisition, object and spatial concept formation, and the emergence of a\nsymbol system. By extending the models, a symbol emergence system comprising a\nmulti-agent system in which a symbol system emerges is revealed to be modeled\nusing PGMs. In this model, symbol emergence can be regarded as collective\npredictive coding.

To address these issues, we introduce ESGSenticNet, a publicly\navailable knowledge base for sustainability analysis.

    "abstract": "Neurons in the brain are organized such that nearby cells tend to share\nsimilar functions. AI models lack this organization, and past efforts to\nintroduce topography have often led to trade-offs between topography and task\nperformance. In this work, we present TopoLoss, a new loss function that\npromotes spatially organized topographic representations in AI models without\nsignificantly sacrificing task performance. TopoLoss is highly adaptable and\ncan be seamlessly integrated into the training of leading model architectures.\nWe validate our method on both vision (ResNet-18, ResNet-50, ViT) and language\nmodels (GPT-Neo-125M, NanoGPT), collectively TopoNets. TopoNets are the\nhighest-performing supervised topographic models to date, exhibiting brain-like\nproperties such as localized feature processing, lower dimensionality, and\nincreased efficiency. TopoNets also predict responses in the brain and\nreplicate the key topographic signatures observed in the brain's visual and\nlanguage cortices. Together, this work establishes a robust and generalizable\nframework for integrating topography into leading model architectures,\nadvancing the development of high-performing models that more closely emulate\nthe computational strategies of the human brain.",

Interestingly, the external lines and the amplitude in the momentum\nspace depend on the contour while Carrollian correlators in the position space\nare independent of the contour.
