    "abstract": "Designing effective software architectures is a complex, iterative process\nthat traditionally relies on expert judgment. This paper proposes an approach\nfor Large Language Model (LLM)-assisted software architecture design using the\nAttribute-Driven Design (ADD) method. By providing an LLM with an explicit\ndescription of ADD, an architect persona, and a structured iteration plan, our\nmethod guides the LLM to collaboratively produce architecture artifacts with a\nhuman architect. We validate the approach through case studies, comparing\ngenerated designs against proven solutions and evaluating them with\nprofessional architects. Results show that our LLM-assisted ADD process can\ngenerate architectures closely aligned with established solutions and partially\nsatisfying architectural drivers, highlighting both the promise and current\nlimitations of using LLMs in architecture design. Our findings emphasize the\nimportance of human oversight and iterative refinement when leveraging LLMs in\nthis domain.",

    "abstract": "Boolean circuits abstract away from physical details to focus on the logical\nstructure and computational behaviour of digital components. Despite they have\nbeen studied for many decades, compositionality has been widely ignored or\nexamined in an informal manner, which is a property for combining circuits\nwithout delving into their internal structure, while supporting modularity and\nformal reasoning. In this paper, we address this longstanding theoretical gap\nby proposing colimit-based operators for compositional circuit construction. We\ndefine separate operators for forming sequential, parallel, branchial and\niterative circuits. As composites encapsulate explicit control flow, a new\nmodel of computation emerges which we refer to as (families of) control-driven\nBoolean circuits. We show how this model is at least as powerful as its\nclassical counterpart. In other words, it is able to non-uniformly compute any\nBoolean function on inputs of arbitrary length.",

However, the increasing prevalence of EVs is accompanied\nby widespread complaints regarding the high likelihood of motion sickness (MS)\ninduction, especially when compared to FVs, which has become one of the major\nobstacles to the acceptance and popularity of EVs. Despite the prevalence of\nsuch complaints online and among EV users, the association between vehicle type\n(i.e., EV versus FV) and MS prevalence and severity has not been quantified.\nThus, this study aims to investigate the existence of EV-induced MS and explore\nthe potential factors leading to it. A survey study was conducted to collect\npassengers' MS experience in EVs and FVs in the past one year. In total, 639\nvalid responses were collected from mainland China. The results show that FVs\nwere associated with a higher frequency of MS, while EVs were found to induce\nmore severe MS symptoms. Further, we found that passengers' MS severity was\nassociated with individual differences (i.e., age, gender, sleep habits,\nsusceptibility to motion-induced MS), in-vehicle activities (i.e., chatting\nwith others and watching in-vehicle displays), and road conditions (i.e.,\ncongestion and slope), while the MS frequency was associated with the vehicle\nownership and riding frequency.

Open\nclusters in particular are more abundant over cosmic time than globular\nclusters, however, previous research on low-mass clusters with $\\lesssim\n10^3~\\textrm{M}_{\\odot}$ has focused on binary black holes (BBHs) or black\nhole-neutron star (BH-NS) binaries. Binary mergers of other compact objects,\nsuch as white dwarfs (WDs), are also crucial as progenitors of transient\nphenomena such as Type Ia supernovae and Fast Radio Bursts. We present\nsimulations of three types of open clusters with masses of $10^2$, $10^3$, and\n$10^4~\\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$. In massive clusters with $\\gtrsim\n10^4~\\textrm{M}_{\\odot}$, BBHs are dynamically formed, however, less massive\ncompact binaries such as WD-WD and WD-NS are perturbed inside the star\nclusters, causing them to evolve into other objects. We further find BH-NS\nmergers only in $10^3~\\textrm{M}_{\\odot}$ clusters. Considering star clusters\nwith a typical open cluster mass, we observe that WD-WD merger rates slightly\nincrease for $10^3~\\textrm{M}_{\\odot}$ clusters but decrease for\n$10^2~\\textrm{M}_{\\odot}$ clusters. Since the host clusters are tidally\ndisrupted, most of them merge outside of the clusters. Our WD-WD merger results\nhave further implications for two classes of transients. Super-Chandrasekhar\nWD-WD mergers are present in our simulations, demonstrating potential sources\nof Fast Radio Bursts at a rate of 70-780 Gpc$^{-3}$yr$^{-1}$, higher than the\nrate estimated for globular clusters. Additionally, we find that Carbon-Oxygen\nWD-WD mergers in our open clusters (34-640 $\\textrm{Gpc}^{-3}$yr$^{-1}$) only\naccount for 0.14-2.6% of the observed Type Ia supernova rate in our local\nUniverse.",

However, CQF's use of a single cycle restricts its ability to\nsupport TSN traffic with diverse timing requirements. Multi-Cyclic Queuing and\nForwarding (Multi-CQF) is a new and emerging TSN shaping mechanism that uses\nmultiple cycles on the same egress port, allowing it to accommodate TSN flows\nwith varied timing requirements more effectively than CQF. Despite its\npotential, current Multi-CQF configuration studies are limited, leading to a\nlack of comprehensive research, poor understanding of the mechanism, and\nlimited adoption of Multi-CQF in practical applications. Previous work has\nshown the impact of Time Injection (TI), defined as the start time of\nTime-Triggered (TT) flows at the source node, on CQF queue resource\nutilization. However, the impact of TI has not yet been explored in the context\nof Multi-CQF.

Building on this foundation, we develop an open-source Genetic\nAlgorithm (GA) and a hybrid GA-Simulated Annealing (GASA) approach to\nefficiently configure Multi-CQF networks and introduce TI in Multi-CQF to\nenhance schedulability. Experimental results show that our proposed algorithms\nsignificantly increase the number of scheduled TT flows compared to the\nbaseline Simulated Annealing (SA) model, improving scheduling by an average of\n15%.

    "abstract": "In [PRC 110, 025201], the authors construct a model for nuclear matter which\nfeatures a quarkyonic phase. A main feature in this model is that the nucleon\noccupation is strongly reduced at small momenta. Somewhat surprisingly, this\nresult is supported by data for electron scattering from nuclear matter, where\na reduction of the cross section consistent with suppression of nucleons with\nsmall momenta is seen. Since nuclear matter data are obtained by extrapolation\nof electron scattering data on increasingly heavier systems, this feature\nshould manifest at least to some degree in heavy nuclei. To check if this is\nplausible we extend the approach of [PRC 110, 025201] to finite nuclei by\nconsidering the nuclear Wigner distribution. We use non-relativistic and\nrelativistic independent particle models to determine the nuclear Wigner\ndistribution, in addition to the local-density approximation (LDA). Phase-space\ndistributions of quarks are obtained as a convolution of the Wigner\ndistribution with a quark momentum distribution. We highlight some properties\nof the Wigner distribution in spherical systems, which can spoil the\ninterpretation of the quark phase-space distribution as occupation numbers in\nthe Fermi sea. On the other hand, we show that large systems behave essentially\nlike infinite nuclear matter in their interior, and that LDA and full results\nare quantitatively similar for large A. We then compute the fraction of baryons\nthat would be in a quarkyonic phase in the same sense as in [PRC 110, 025201]\nfor a set of nuclei with mass $12 \\leq A \\leq 238$. We find that this fraction\nsystematically tends to a constant at large $A$. It is hence plausible that the\nsuppression seen in the nuclear matter data is a genuine feature, present in\nlarge finite nuclei. This result is counter-intuitive and we discuss possible\nelectron scattering measurements that could rule out this model.",

    "abstract": "Audio fingerprinting (AFP) allows the identification of unknown audio content\nby extracting compact representations, termed audio fingerprints, that are\ndesigned to remain robust against common audio degradations. Neural AFP methods\noften employ metric learning, where representation quality is influenced by the\nnature of the supervision and the utilized loss function. However, recent work\nunrealistically simulates real-life audio degradation during training,\nresulting in sub-optimal supervision. Additionally, although several modern\nmetric learning approaches have been proposed, current neural AFP methods\ncontinue to rely on the NT-Xent loss without exploring the recent advances or\nclassical alternatives. In this work, we propose a series of best practices to\nenhance the self-supervision by leveraging musical signal properties and\nrealistic room acoustics. We then present the first systematic evaluation of\nvarious metric learning approaches in the context of AFP, demonstrating that a\nself-supervised adaptation of the triplet loss yields superior performance. Our\nresults also reveal that training with multiple positive samples per anchor has\ncritically different effects across loss functions.

In this\npaper, we use image simulations to investigate how a joint analysis of\nhigh-resolution space-based and deep ground-based imaging can improve shear\nestimation. We simulate two scenarios: a grid-based setup, where galaxies are\nplaced on a regular grid to mimic an idealised, blending-free scenario, and a\nrandom setup, where galaxies are randomly distributed to capture the impact of\nblending. Comparing these cases, we find that blending introduces significant\nbiases, particularly in LSST-like data due to its larger point spread function.\nThis highlights the importance of including realistic blending effects when\nevaluating the performance of joint analyses. Using simulations that account\nfor blending, we find that the most effective catalogue-level synergy is\nachieved by combining all galaxies detected in either survey. This approach\nyields an effective galaxy number density of $44.08~\\rm arcmin^{-2}$ over the\nmagnitude range of 20.0 to 27.5, compared to $39.17~\\rm arcmin^{-2}$ for\nLSST-like data alone and $30.31~\\rm arcmin^{-2}$ for \\textit{Euclid}-like data\nalone. Restricting the analysis to only the overlapping sources detected in\nboth surveys results in a gain of ${\\sim}12\\%$ compared to using either survey\nalone. While this joint-object approach is suboptimal at the catalogue level,\nit may become more effective in pixel-level analyses, where a joint fit to\nindividual galaxy shapes can better leverage the complementary strengths of\nboth data sets. Studying such pixel-level combinations, with realistic blending\neffects properly accounted for, remains a promising direction for future work.",

    "abstract": "Over the past decade, recommender systems have experienced a surge in\npopularity. Despite notable progress, they grapple with challenging issues,\nsuch as high data dimensionality and sparseness. Representing users and items\nas low-dimensional embeddings learned via neural networks has become a leading\nsolution. However, while recent studies show promising results, many approaches\nrely on complex architectures or require content data, which may not always be\navailable. This paper presents Interact2Vec, a novel neural network-based model\nthat simultaneously learns distributed embeddings for users and items while\ndemanding only implicit feedback. The model employs state-of-the-art strategies\nthat natural language processing models commonly use to optimize the training\nphase and enhance the final embeddings. Two types of experiments were conducted\nregarding the extrinsic and intrinsic quality of the model. In the former, we\nbenchmarked the recommendations generated by Interact2Vec's embeddings in a\ntop-$N$ ranking problem, comparing them with six other recommender algorithms.\nThe model achieved the second or third-best results in 30% of the datasets,\nbeing competitive with other recommenders, and has proven to be very efficient\nwith an average training time reduction of 274% compared to other\nembedding-based models. Later, we analyzed the intrinsic quality of the\nembeddings through similarity tables. Our findings suggest that Interact2Vec\ncan achieve promising results, especially on the extrinsic task, and is an\nexcellent embedding-generator model for scenarios of scarce computing\nresources, enabling the learning of item and user embeddings simultaneously and\nefficiently.",

    "abstract": "Phase separation in multicomponent fluids is central to understanding the\norganization of complex materials and biological structures. The\nCahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes (CHNS) equations offer a robust framework for\nmodeling such systems, capturing both diffusive dynamics and hydrodynamic\ninteractions. In this work, we investigate hyperuniformity, characterized by\nsuppressed large-scale density fluctuations, in ternary fluid mixtures governed\nby the ternary CHNS equations. Using large-scale direct numerical simulations,\nwe systematically explore the influence of wetting conditions and hydrodynamic\neffects on emergent hyperuniformity. Similar to binary systems we observe that\nthe presence of hydrodynamics weakens the hyperuniform characteristics.\nHowever, also the wetting properties have an effect. We find that in partial\nwetting regimes, all three components exhibit comparable degrees of\nhyperuniformity. In contrast, for complete wetting scenarios, where one\ncomponent preferentially wets the other two, the wetting component displays a\nsignificant reduction in hyperuniformity relative to the others. These findings\nsuggest that wetting asymmetry can act as a control parameter for spatial order\nin multicomponent fluids.",

This study aims to estimate the structural\nparameters and distances of a sample of Classical Cepheids using non-linear\nconvective pulsation models. It also tests the consistency of Gaia parallaxes,\nconstrains the Mass Luminosity relation, and investigates the dependence of the\nprojection factor (p-factor) on pulsation period. We analysed 46 Cepheids with\nprecise Gaia DR3 photometry and radial velocities. Model fitting was performed\nby comparing predicted and observed light curves in Gaia G, GBP, and GRP bands,\nand radial velocity curves. Distances from the models were compared with Gaia\nparallaxes, including published corrections. Predicted masses and luminosities\nwere used to constrain the ML relation; radial velocities allowed independent\npfactor estimates. Distances show statistical agreement with Gaia parallaxes,\nrequiring no additional global offset. Inferred masses and luminosities are\nconsistent with evolution models including mild core overshooting, mass loss,\nor rotation. No significant period dependence of the pfactor is found, with a\nconstant value of p = 1.22+/-0.05, consistent with recent studies. Results also\nagree with the Period-Wesenheit-Metallicity relation from Gaia DR3.",

    "abstract": "We establish rigorous error bounds for prime counting using a truncated\nGaussian (TG) kernel in the explicit formula framework. Our main theorem proves\nthat the approximation error remains globally below 1/2 for all sufficiently\nlarge arguments, guaranteeing exact computation of {\\pi}(x) through simple\nrounding, without relying on unproven hypotheses.\n  The TG kernel construction employs Gaussian-like test functions with compact\nsupport, engineered with vanishing moments to eliminate main terms. For x with\n10^8 decimal digits, we demonstrate that only ~1200 nontrivial zeta zeros\nsuffice to achieve the error bound, enabling computation in seconds on modern\nhardware - a dramatic improvement over classical methods.\n  Key contributions include: (1) Explicit tail truncation bounds using Taylor\nremainder analysis, showing exponential decay; (2) Zero-sum truncation error\nbounds via unconditional density estimates; (3) Rigorous treatment of trivial\nzero contributions. All constants are made explicit, ensuring full\nverifiability.\n  The method bridges analytic number theory and practical computation, with\npotential applications to record-breaking prime counting computations. We\ndiscuss algorithmic implications including FFT-based arithmetic for ~330\nmillion bit numbers. The framework's flexibility suggests connections to deeper\nstructures in prime distribution, particularly regarding optimized kernel\ndesigns and the interplay between smoothing parameters {\\alpha} and truncation\nheights.\n  This work exemplifies how classical analytic techniques, when carefully\nimplemented with modern computational perspectives, yield practical algorithms\nfor problems previously considered purely theoretical. The rigorous error\nanalysis ensures reliability even at astronomical scales, opening new avenues\nfor computational number theory research.",

In this work, we use optogenetic control of the canonical Wnt pathway as\nan example to study how reliably information about an external signal is\ntransmitted to a population of cells, and determine an optimal encoding\nstrategy to maximize information transmission from Wnt signals to gene\nexpression. We find that it is possible to reach an information capacity beyond\n1 bit only through an appropriate, discrete encoding of signals. By averaging\nover an increasing number of outputs, we systematically vary the effective\nnoise in the pathway. As the effective noise decreases, the optimal encoding\ncomprises more discrete input signals. These signals do not need to be\nfine-tuned. The optimal code transitions into a continuous code in the\nsmall-noise limit, which can be shown to be consistent with the Jeffreys prior.\nWe visualize the performance of signal encodings using decoding maps. Our\nresults suggest optogenetic Wnt signaling allows for regulatory control beyond\na simple binary switch, and provides a framework to apply ideas from\ninformation processing to single-cell in vitro experiments.",

This approach not only hurts performance at the\nsoftware level due to memory copies between user space address spaces and\nkernel space address spaces, it also hurts system performance at the\nmicroarchitectural level by flushing processor pipelines and other\nmicroarchitectural state.\n  In this paper, we propose a new communication interface between user\napplications and the kernel by setting up a shared memory region between user\nspace applications and the kernel's address space. We acknowledge the danger in\nbreaking the golden law of user-kernel address space isolation, so we coupled a\nuBPF VM (user-space BPF Virtual Machine) with shared memory to control access\nto the kernel's memory from the user's application. In this case, user-space\nprograms can access the shared memory under the supervision of the uBPF VM (and\nthe kernel's blessing of its shared library) to gain non-blocking data transfer\nto and from the kernel's memory space.

    "abstract": "Manual sound design with a synthesizer is inherently iterative: an artist\ncompares the synthesized output to a mental target, adjusts parameters, and\nrepeats until satisfied. Iterative sound-matching automates this workflow by\ncontinually programming a synthesizer under the guidance of a loss function (or\nsimilarity measure) toward a target sound. Prior comparisons of loss functions\nhave typically favored one metric over another, but only within narrow\nsettings: limited synthesis methods, few loss types, often without blind\nlistening tests. This leaves open the question of whether a universally optimal\nloss exists, or the choice of loss remains a creative decision conditioned on\nthe synthesis method and the sound designer's preference. We propose\ndifferentiable iterative sound-matching as the natural extension of the\navailable literature, since it combines the manual approach to sound design\nwith modern advances in machine learning. To analyze the variability of loss\nfunction performance across synthesizers, we implemented a mix of four novel\nand established differentiable loss functions, and paired them with\ndifferentiable subtractive, additive, and AM synthesizers. For each of the\nsixteen synthesizer--loss combinations, we ran 300 randomized sound-matching\ntrials. Performance was measured using parameter differences,\nspectrogram-distance metrics, and manually assigned listening scores. We\nobserved a moderate level of consistency among the three performance measures.\nOur post-hoc analysis shows that the loss function performance is highly\ndependent on the synthesizer. These findings underscore the value of expanding\nthe scope of sound-matching experiments and developing new similarity metrics\ntailored to specific synthesis techniques rather than pursuing\none-size-fits-all solutions.",

This agreement strengthens the\ncase that BNS mergers are the main site of UCR production.\n  The jets may also be capable of accelerating particles to ultrahigh energy:\nthese UCRs would be protons and/or helium, in a ratio that depends on the\nneutron star equation of state.

    "abstract": "The physics of settling suspensions under shear are investigated by\ntheoretical and numerical analyses of unstable equilibrium solutions to the\nincompressible Navier-Stokes equations, coupled with an\nadvection-diffusion-settling equation for a dilute phase of particles. Two\ncases are considered: the 'passive scalar' regime, in which the sediment is\nadvected by the fluid motion, but concentrations are too dilute to affect the\nflow; and the 'stratified' regime, where nonuniform vertical distribution of\nsediment due to particle settling leads to a bulk stratification that feeds\nback on the flow via buoyancy. In the passive regime, we characterise the\nstructure of the resultant sediment concentration fields and derive formulae\nfor transport fluxes of sediment with asymptotically low and high settling\nvelocities. In the stratified regime, parametric continuation is employed to\nexplore the dependence of states upon the bulk Richardson number $Ri_b$.\nSymmetry breaking in the governing equations leads to travelling wave solutions\nwith a rich bifurcation structure. The maximum $Ri_b$ attained by these states\ndepends non-monotonically on settling velocity and obeys asymptotic scalings\nthat have also been observed to capture the dependence of the laminar-turbulent\nboundary in direct numerical simulations.",

In this paper, we study EWPM and its variants. The EWPM\nproblem is famous, since in the case of unary encoded weights, Mulmuley,\nVazirani, and Vazirani showed almost 40 years ago that the problem can be\nsolved in randomized polynomial time. However, up to this date no\nderandomization is known.\n  Our first result is a simple deterministic algorithm for EWPM that runs in\ntime $n^{O(\\ell)}$, where $\\ell$ is the number of distinct weights that perfect\nmatchings in $G$ can take. In fact, we show how to find an $\\ell$-th smallest\nperfect matching in any weighted graph (even if the weights are encoded in\nbinary, in which case EWPM in general is known to be NP-complete) in time\n$n^{O(\\ell)}$ for any integer $\\ell$. Similar next-to-optimal variants have\nalso been studied recently for the shortest path problem.\n  For our second result, we extend the list of problems that are known to be\nequivalent to EWPM. We show that EWPM is equivalent under a weight-preserving\nreduction to the Exact Cycle Sum problem (ECS) in undirected graphs with a\nconservative (i.e. no negative cycles) weight function. To the best of our\nknowledge, we are the first to study this problem. As a consequence, the latter\nproblem is contained in RP if the weights are encoded in unary. Finally, we\nidentify a special case of EWPM, called BCPM, which was recently studied by El\nMaalouly, Steiner and Wulf. We show that BCPM is equivalent under a\nweight-preserving transformation to another problem recently studied by\nSchlotter and Seb\\H{o} as well as Geelen and Kapadia: the Shortest Odd Cycle\nproblem (SOC) in undirected graphs with conservative weights.",

Ultrasonic reflection\ntechniques offer a promising non-invasive approach for in situ evaluation of\nlubricant films.However, accurately identifying the central film thickness\nremains challenging due to several complex factors, including dynamic\nfluctuations, localized elastic deformation, cavitation effects, and variations\nin oil supply. This study presents a comprehensive theoretical and numerical\nframework to elucidate the influence of these factors on ultrasonic wave\npropagation in lubricated contacts. Numerical simulations considering\nelastohydrodynamic lubrication (EHL) regime and cavitation-induced effects are\ncarried out to obtain the surface deformation profiles and the cavitation\nregions. Subsequently, high-fidelity acoustic simulations are conducted to\ninterpret reflected ultrasound data.As main results, the EHL leads to a\n\"double-peak with central valley\" pattern in the reflection coefficient\ndistribution. While the cavitation causes the central valley to shift toward\nthe inlet region and increases the reflection coefficient.Accordingly, the\ncentral film thickness is extracted from the distribution of the reflection\ncoefficient under different operating conditions. Experimental validation using\nboth glass-oil-steel and steel-oil-steel bearing setups confirms the\neffectiveness of the proposed method. The high-resolution fluorescence\nmeasurement adopted in the glass-oil-steel configuration validates the\nsimulation of the reflection coefficient distribution.

Here,\nwe show that a composite strategy for these types of intercurrent events can\nlead to the outcome being defined differently between treatment arms, resulting\nin estimands that are not based on causal comparisons. This occurs when the\nintercurrent event can be categorised, such as based on its timing, and at\nleast one category applies to one treatment arm only.

A composite strategy then results in treatment discontinuations between\n6-12 months being part of the outcome definition in the 12-month arm, but not\nthe 6-month arm. Using a simulation study, we show that this can dramatically\naffect conclusions; for instance, in a scenario where the intervention had no\ndirect effect on either a clinical outcome or occurrence of the intercurrent\nevent, a composite strategy led to an average risk difference of -10% and\nrejected the null hypothesis almost 90% of the time.

While prior work establishes a worst-case bound of\n$\\Theta\\left(\\alpha\\log n+\\frac{\\alpha}{\\varepsilon^2}\\right)$ bits, these\nresults rely on assumptions that may not hold in practice. We introduce a new\nparameterization based on the number $C = \\frac{\\beta}{\\varepsilon^2}$ of\npairwise collisions, i.e., instances where the same element appears on multiple\nservers, and design a protocol that uses only $\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\alpha\\log\nn+\\frac{\\sqrt{\\beta}}{\\varepsilon^2} \\log n\\right)$ bits, breaking previous\nlower bounds when $C$ is small. We further improve our algorithm under\nassumptions on the number of distinct elements or collisions and provide\nmatching lower bounds in all regimes, establishing $C$ as a tight complexity\nmeasure for the problem. Finally, we consider streaming algorithms for distinct\nelement estimation parameterized by the number of items with frequency larger\nthan $1$.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in quantum hardware motivate the development of algorithmic\nframeworks that integrate quantum sampling with classical inference. This work\nintroduces a segmentation-based regression method tailored to quantum neural\nnetworks (QNNs), where real-valued outputs are encoded as base-b digit\nsequences and inferred through greedy digitwise optimization. By casting the\nregression task as a constrained combinatorial problem over a structured digit\nlattice, the method replaces continuous inference with interpretable and\ntractable updates. A hybrid quantum-classical architecture is employed: quantum\ncircuits generate candidate digits through projective measurement, while\nclassical forward models evaluate these candidates based on task-specific error\nfunctionals.

    "abstract": "Bilevel hyperparameter optimization has received growing attention thanks to\nthe fast development of machine learning. Due to the tremendous size of data\nsets, the scale of bilevel hyperparameter optimization problem could be\nextremely large, posing great challenges in designing efficient numerical\nalgorithms. In this paper, we focus on solving the large-scale mathematical\nprograms with equilibrium constraints (MPEC) derived from hyperparameter\nselection of L1-support vector classification (L1-SVC). We propose a highly\nefficient single-loop smoothing damped Newton method (SDNM) for solving such\nMPEC. Compared with most existing algorithms where subproblems are involved and\nsolved by on-shelf packages, our approach fully takes advantage of the\nstructure of MPEC and therefore is single-loop. Moreover, the proposed SDNM\nenjoys a quadratic convergence rate under proper assumptions. Extensive\nnumerical results over LIBSVM dataset show the superior performance of SDNM\nover other state-of-art algorithms including the Scholtes global relaxation\nmethod (SGRM) with subproblem solved by SNOPT and the Matlab built-in function\nfmincon, especially in CPU time. For example, for dataset w4a, SDNM is 20 times\nfaster than SGRM and 3 times faster than fmincon. Further numerical results\nalso verifies the quadratic convergence rate of SDNM as well as the fulfillment\nof the second order sufficient condition, while guarantees that SDNM returns a\nstrict local minimizer of the smoothing problem of MPEC.",

    "abstract": "Transfer learning is often used to decrease the computational cost of model\ntraining, as fine-tuning a model allows a downstream task to leverage the\nfeatures learned from the pre-training dataset and quickly adapt them to a new\ntask. This is particularly useful for achieving adversarial robustness, as\nadversarially training models from scratch is very computationally expensive.\nHowever, high robustness in transfer learning still requires adversarial\ntraining during the fine-tuning phase, which requires up to an order of\nmagnitude more time than standard fine-tuning. In this work, we revisit the use\nof the fast gradient sign method (FGSM) in robust transfer learning to improve\nthe computational cost of adversarial fine-tuning. We surprisingly find that\nFGSM is much more stable in adversarial fine-tuning than when training from\nscratch. In particular, FGSM fine-tuning does not suffer from any issues with\ncatastrophic overfitting at standard perturbation budgets of $\\varepsilon=4$ or\n$\\varepsilon=8$. This stability is further enhanced with parameter-efficient\nfine-tuning methods, where FGSM remains stable even up to $\\varepsilon=32$ for\nlinear probing. We demonstrate how this stability translates into performance\nacross multiple datasets. Compared to fine-tuning with the more commonly used\nmethod of projected gradient descent (PGD), on average, FGSM only loses 0.39%\nand 1.39% test robustness for $\\varepsilon=4$ and $\\varepsilon=8$ while using\n$4\\times$ less training time. Surprisingly, FGSM may not only be a\nsignificantly more efficient alternative to PGD in adversarially robust\ntransfer learning but also a well-performing one.",

    "abstract": "Monte Carlo techniques are the method of choice for making probabilistic\npredictions of an outcome in several disciplines. Usually, the aim is to\ngenerate calibrated predictions which are statistically indistinguishable from\nthe outcome. Developers and users of such Monte Carlo predictions are\ninterested in evaluating the degree of calibration of the forecasts. Here, we\nconsider predictions of $p$-dimensional outcomes sampling a multivariate\nGaussian distribution and apply the Box ordinate transform (BOT) to assess\ncalibration. However, this approach is known to fail to reliably indicate\ncalibration when the sample size n is moderate. For some applications, the cost\nof obtaining Monte-Carlo estimates is significant, which can limit the sample\nsize, for instance, in model development when the model is improved\niteratively. Thus, it would be beneficial to be able to reliably assess\ncalibration even if the sample size n is moderate. To address this need, we\nintroduce a fair, sample size- and dimension-dependent version of the Gaussian\nsample BOT. In a simulation study, the fair Gaussian sample BOT is compared\nwith alternative BOT versions for different miscalibrations and for different\nsample sizes. Results confirm that the fair Gaussian sample BOT is capable of\ncorrectly identifying miscalibration when the sample size is moderate in\ncontrast to the alternative BOT versions. Subsequently, the fair Gaussian\nsample BOT is applied to two to 12-dimensional predictions of temperature and\nvector wind using operational ensemble forecasts of the European Centre for\nMedium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). Firstly, perfectly reliable situations\nare considered where the outcome is replaced by a forecast that samples the\nsame distribution as the members in the ensemble. Secondly, the BOT is computed\nusing estimates of the actual temperature and vector wind from ECMWF analyses.",

Recent cosmological inferences using Type Ia supernovae (SNe~Ia),\nbaryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) and the cosmic microwave background (CMB)\nobservations have suggested that dark energy may evolve in time. We test how\nthe assumption of distance duality impacts dark energy inference. Marginalizing\nover the absolute SNe~Ia luminosity, we find no deviation from the DDR,\nindependent of the SN~Ia compilation used, or the assumed dark energy model.\nThis corresponds a maximum deviation in the SN~Ia luminosity of $\\Delta m \\sim\n0.05$ mag at the highest redshift. Allowing for deviations in the DDR increases\nthe errors in the dark energy equation of state parameters (EoS) by 30-50$\\%$.\nFor the Pantheon+ compilation the constraints on dark energy are within\n$2\\sigma$ of $\\Lambda$CDM when applying a more realistic minimum redshift cut\n$z_{\\rm min} >0.023$.

    "abstract": "We explored experimentally the self-organization at rest and the compression\ndynamics of a two-dimensional array of magnetic repelling particles, using two\nparticle geometries, namely, disks and rectangular bars. Despite the\nnon-contact interaction, typical static features of granular materials are\nobserved for both particle shapes: pile formation with an angle of repose and\npressure saturation (Janssen-like effect), which can be explained by\nconsidering the magnetically-induced torques that generate friction between\nparticles and confining walls. Particle shape effects are mainly observed\nduring compression: while disks rearrange increasing the hexagonal ordering,\nbars augment their orientational ordering forming larger non-contact force\nchains; however, in both cases, the resistance to compression rises\ncontinuously, in contrast with the fluctuating compression dynamics (stick-slip\nmotion or periodic oscillations) that characterizes granular systems with\ninter-particle contacts. The continuous response to compression, and the\nreduction of particle wear due to non-contact interactions, are desirable\nfeatures in designing magnetic granular dampers.",

However,\nexisting approaches, primarily based on convolutional neural networks or\ntransformer architectures, often struggle to model the complex relationships\ninherent in fMRI data, limited by their inability to capture long-range spatial\nand temporal dependencies. To overcome these shortcomings, we introduce\nBrainMT, a novel hybrid framework designed to efficiently learn and integrate\nlong-range spatiotemporal attributes in fMRI data. Our framework operates in\ntwo stages: (1) a bidirectional Mamba block with a temporal-first scanning\nmechanism to capture global temporal interactions in a computationally\nefficient manner; and (2) a transformer block leveraging self-attention to\nmodel global spatial relationships across the deep features processed by the\nMamba block. Extensive experiments on two large-scale public datasets,\nUKBioBank and the Human Connectome Project, demonstrate that BrainMT achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on both classification (sex prediction) and\nregression (cognitive intelligence prediction) tasks, outperforming existing\nmethods by a significant margin.

    "abstract": "Text on historical maps provides valuable information for studies in history,\neconomics, geography, and other related fields. Unlike structured or\nsemi-structured documents, text on maps varies significantly in orientation,\nreading order, shape, and placement. Many modern methods can detect and\ntranscribe text regions, but they struggle to effectively ``link'' the\nrecognized text fragments, e.g., determining a multi-word place name. Existing\nlayout analysis methods model word relationships to improve text understanding\nin structured documents, but they primarily rely on linguistic features and\nneglect geometric information, which is essential for handling map text. To\naddress these challenges, we propose LIGHT, a novel multi-modal approach that\nintegrates linguistic, image, and geometric features for linking text on\nhistorical maps. In particular, LIGHT includes a geometry-aware embedding\nmodule that encodes the polygonal coordinates of text regions to capture\npolygon shapes and their relative spatial positions on an image. LIGHT unifies\nthis geometric information with the visual and linguistic token embeddings from\nLayoutLMv3, a pretrained layout analysis model. LIGHT uses the cross-modal\ninformation to predict the reading-order successor of each text instance\ndirectly with a bi-directional learning strategy that enhances sequence\nrobustness. Experimental results show that LIGHT outperforms existing methods\non the ICDAR 2024/2025 MapText Competition data, demonstrating the\neffectiveness of multi-modal learning for historical map text linking.",

In the context of a normal-means model and for a\nfixed sample, this problem is known to exhibit a nontrivial phase transition\nthat characterizes when anomalies can and cannot be detected. We show, for the\nanytime-valid version of the problem, testing procedures that can detect the\npresence of anomalies quickly. Given that the goal is quick detection, existing\napproaches to anytime-valid testing that study how evidence accumulates for\nlarge times through log-optimality criteria is insufficient. This issue is\naddressed in this context by studying log-optimal procedures for a fixed moment\nin time, but as the number of streams grows larger. The resulting\ncharacterization is related to, but not implied by the existing results for\nfixed-sample tests. In addition, we also construct and analyze tests that are\nparameter-adaptive and exhibit optimal performance (in a well defined sense)\neven when the hypothesized model parameters are unknown.

However, no end-to-end autonomous large language model (LLM)-based AI\nsystem has been rigorously evaluated in real-world clinical practice. In this\nstudy, we evaluated whether a multi-agent LLM-based AI framework can function\nautonomously as an AI doctor in a virtual urgent care setting. Methods: We\nretrospectively compared the performance of the multi-agent AI system Doctronic\nand board-certified clinicians across 500 consecutive urgent-care telehealth\nencounters. The primary end points: diagnostic concordance, treatment plan\nconsistency, and safety metrics, were assessed by blinded LLM-based\nadjudication and expert human review. Results: The top diagnosis of Doctronic\nand clinician matched in 81% of cases, and the treatment plan aligned in 99.2%\nof cases. No clinical hallucinations occurred (e.g., diagnosis or treatment not\nsupported by clinical findings). In an expert review of discordant cases, AI\nperformance was superior in 36.1%, and human performance was superior in 9.3%;\nthe diagnoses were equivalent in the remaining cases. Conclusions: In this\nfirst large-scale validation of an autonomous AI doctor, we demonstrated strong\ndiagnostic and treatment plan concordance with human clinicians, with AI\nperformance matching and in some cases exceeding that of practicing clinicians.\nThese findings indicate that multi-agent AI systems achieve comparable clinical\ndecision-making to human providers and offer a potential solution to healthcare\nworkforce shortages.",

In that case, should supra-threshold LOD control\nalso differ from LOD control at threshold?\n  In two experiments, we examine supra-threshold LOD control in the visual\nperiphery and find that indeed, it should differ drastically from LOD control\nat threshold. Specifically, we find that LOD must support a task-dependent\nlevel of reliable perceptibility. Above that level, perceptibility of LOD\ncontrol manipulations should be minimized, and detail contrast is a better\npredictor of perceptibility than detail size.

The method is particularly well suited to handle domains with sharp\ncorners where solution singularities are present.

In this work, we characterize thin WSe$_2$ samples with\nvariable thicknesses using scanning electron microscope (SEM)-based techniques\nfocused on analysis of backscattered electron signal and Kikuchi diffraction\npatterns. These data were collected via a pixelated electron-counting direct\nelectron detector positioned below the pole piece primarily configured for\nreflection Kikuchi diffraction (RKD), and a similar detector placed in the more\nconventional electron backscatter diffraction geometry. In addition to\nconventional pattern analysis for orientation microscopy, multivariate\nstatistical methods (MSA) based on principal component analysis were applied to\nanalyze diffraction patterns and differentiate thickness variations and crystal\norientations within the thin films through data clustering. These results were\ncompared with atomic force microscopy to validate thickness measurements.

Systematic acceleration voltage variations in RKD\nexperiments and comparisons with EBSD data suggest that the thickness\ndependency arises from inelastic scattering of diffracted electrons, which\naffects pattern contrast in the thin film regime.

This study investigates various\ninterpretations of non-Hermitian quantum dynamics such as the normalization and\nmetric approaches. We demonstrate that owing to distinct types of dynamic\nbehaviour, QFI expressions vary significantly depending on the formalism. In\nparticular, the normalization formalism overestimates the enhancement and/or\nrevivals in QFI, effectively post-selecting the most optimistic case of the\nevolution, which may give an overly favourable impression of the sensitivity\nand accuracy of quantum measurements. The metric-based interpretation maintains\nconsistency with a Hermitian-like structure, offering a more stable and\nconservative assessment of measurement precision. This approach provides a more\nnatural representation of the system's evolution, enabling a more accurate\nassessment of quantum measurement sensitivity without the need for\npost-selection.

In the\nreviewed literature, systems served multiple functions beyond producing REEs,\nincluding circularizing production and waste remediation, leading to\ndiscrepancies in scope. Further, the instability of REE prices led to high\nuncertainty due to different revenue, costs, functional unit, and impact\nallocation. Therefore, these analyses leave decision makers with an incomplete\nunderstanding of the current landscape of REE production inhibiting intelligent\nand efficient identification of future direction. In this narrative review, we\nconducted a comprehensive overview of the literature, synthesized studies from\neach pillar of sustainability (economic, environmental, and social),\nhighlighted the challenges and limitations in each field, and recommended\ndirection for future work developing sustainable REE production systems.",

This study presents an approach to improve the quality of MOP\nsolutions by optimizing the dispersion in the decision space and the\nconvergence in a specific region of the objective space. Our approach defines a\nRegion of Interest (ROI) based on a cone representing the decision maker's\npreferences in the objective space, while enhancing the dispersion of solutions\nin the decision space using a uniformity measure. Combining solution\nconcentration in the objective space with dispersion in the decision space\nintensifies the search for Pareto-optimal solutions while increasing solution\ndiversity. When combined, these characteristics improve the quality of\nsolutions and avoid the bias caused by clustering solutions in a specific\nregion of the decision space.

These limitations hinder the\ndevelopment of a unified and generalizable biomedical foundation model trained\nfrom scratch. To overcome this, we introduce MMKD-CLIP, a generalist biomedical\nfoundation model developed via Multiple Medical CLIP Knowledge Distillation.\nRather than relying on billion-scale raw data, MMKD-CLIP distills knowledge\nfrom nine state-of-the-art domain-specific or generalist biomedical CLIP\nmodels, each pretrained on millions of biomedical image-text pairs. Our\ntwo-stage training pipeline first performs CLIP-style pretraining on over 2.9\nmillion biomedical image-text pairs from 26 image modalities, followed by\nfeature-level distillation using over 19.2 million feature pairs extracted from\nteacher models. We evaluate MMKD-CLIP on 58 diverse biomedical datasets,\nencompassing over 10.8 million biomedical images across nine image modalities.\nThe evaluation spans six core task types: zero-shot classification, linear\nprobing, cross-modal retrieval, visual question answering, survival prediction,\nand cancer diagnosis. MMKD-CLIP consistently outperforms all teacher models\nwhile demonstrating remarkable robustness and generalization across image\ndomains and task settings.

This allows us to reduce\nthe complexity of the vanilla algorithm, while also unifying results from\nprevious works. We then show that for tensors in $S^d\\mathbb{C}^{n+1}$ with $d$\neven, low enough regularity can reduce finding a symmetric tensor decomposition\nto solving a system of linear equations. For order-$4$ tensors we prove that\ngeneric tensors of rank up to $r=2n+1$ can be decomposed efficiently via moment\nmatrix extension, exceeding the rank threshold allowed by simultaneous\ndiagonalization. We then formulate a conjecture that states for generic\norder-$4$ tensors of rank $r=O(n^2)$ the induced linear system is sufficient\nfor efficient tensor decomposition, matching the asymptotics of existing\nalgorithms and in fact improving the leading coefficient. Towards this\nconjecture we give computer assisted proofs that the statement holds for $n=2,\n\\dots, 17$. Next we demonstrate that classes of nonidentifiable tensors can be\ndecomposed efficiently via the moment matrix extension algorithm, bypassing the\nusual need for uniqueness of decomposition. Of particular interest is the class\nof monomials, for which the extension algorithm is not only efficient but also\nimproves on existing theory by explicitly parameterizing the space of\ndecompositions.

In the process, it introduces a new way to perform end-to-end video\nobject detection that improves upon existing video detectors in two key ways.\nFirst, by representing objects as variable-length sequences of discrete tokens,\nwe can succinctly represent widely varying numbers of video objects, with\ndiverse shapes and locations, without having to inject any localization cues in\nthe training process. This eliminates the need to sample the space of all\npossible boxes that constrains conventional detectors and thus solves the dual\nproblems of loss sparsity during training and heuristics-based postprocessing\nduring inference. Second, it conceptualizes and outputs the video objects as\nfully integrated and indivisible 3D boxes or tracklets instead of generating\nimage-specific 2D boxes and linking these boxes together to construct the video\nobject, as done in most conventional detectors. This allows it to scale\neffortlessly with available computational resources by simply increasing the\nlength of the video subsequence that the network takes as input, even\ngeneralizing to multi-object tracking if the subsequence can span the entire\nvideo. We compare our video detector with the baseline Pix2Seq static detector\non several datasets and demonstrate consistent improvement, although with\nstrong signs of being bottlenecked by our limited computational resources. We\nalso compare it with several video detectors on UA-DETRAC to show that it is\ncompetitive with the current state of the art even with the computational\nbottleneck.

However, in real-world\napplications such as school choice and residency matching, preferences are\nrevealed after capacity decisions are made, with matching occurring afterward;\nuncertainty about agents' preferences must be considered during capacity\nplanning. Moreover, even under strategy-proof mechanisms, agents may\nstrategically misreport preferences based on beliefs about admission chances.\nWe introduce a two-stage stochastic matching problem with uncertain\npreferences, using school choice as a case study. In the first stage, the\nclearinghouse expands schools' capacities before observing students' reported\npreferences. Students either report their true preferences, producing exogenous\nuncertainty, or act strategically, submitting reported preferences based on\ntheir true preferences and admission chances (which depend on capacities),\nintroducing endogenous uncertainty. In the second stage, the clearinghouse\ncomputes the student-optimal stable matching based on schools' priorities and\nstudents' reported preferences. In strategic cases, endogenous reported\npreferences are utility-maximizing transformations of capacity decisions and\nexogenous true preferences; we handle uncertainty using sample average\napproximation(SAA). We develop behavior-based mathematical formulations and,\ndue to problem complexity, propose Lagrangian- and local-search-based\nbehavior-specific heuristics for near-optimal solutions. Our SAA-based\napproaches outperform the average scenario approach on students' matching\npreferences and admission outcomes, emphasizing the impact of stochastic\npreferences on capacity decisions.

To this end,\nwe introduce the Seamless Interaction Dataset, a large-scale collection of over\n4,000 hours of face-to-face interaction footage from over 4,000 participants in\ndiverse contexts. This dataset enables the development of AI technologies that\nunderstand dyadic embodied dynamics, unlocking breakthroughs in virtual agents,\ntelepresence experiences, and multimodal content analysis tools. We also\ndevelop a suite of models that utilize the dataset to generate dyadic motion\ngestures and facial expressions aligned with human speech. These models can\ntake as input both the speech and visual behavior of their interlocutors. We\npresent a variant with speech from an LLM model and integrations with 2D and 3D\nrendering methods, bringing us closer to interactive virtual agents.\nAdditionally, we describe controllable variants of our motion models that can\nadapt emotional responses and expressivity levels, as well as generating more\nsemantically-relevant gestures. Finally, we discuss methods for assessing the\nquality of these dyadic motion models, which are demonstrating the potential\nfor more intuitive and responsive human-AI interactions.",

    "abstract": "This work explores key conceptual limitations in data-driven modeling of\nmultiscale dynamical systems, focusing on neural emulators and stochastic\nclimate modeling. A skillful climate model should capture both stationary\nstatistics and responses to external perturbations. While current\nautoregressive neural models often reproduce the former, they typically\nstruggle with the latter. We begin by analyzing a low-dimensional dynamical\nsystem to expose, by analogy, fundamental limitations that persist in\nhigh-dimensional settings. Specifically, we construct neural stochastic models\nunder two scenarios: one where the full state vector is observed, and another\nwith only partial observations (i.e. a subset of variables). In the first case,\nthe models accurately capture both equilibrium statistics and forced responses\nin ensemble mean and variance. In the more realistic case of partial\nobservations, two key challenges emerge: (i) identifying the \\textit{proper}\nvariables to model, and (ii) parameterizing the influence of unobserved degrees\nof freedom. These issues are not specific to neural networks but reflect\nfundamental limitations of data-driven modeling and the need to target the slow\ndynamics of the system. We argue that physically grounded strategies -- such as\ncoarse-graining and stochastic parameterizations -- are critical, both\nconceptually and practically, for the skillful emulation of complex systems\nlike the coupled climate system. Building on these insights, we turn to a more\nrealistic application: a stochastic reduced neural model of the sea surface\ntemperature field and the net radiative flux at the top of the atmosphere,\nassessing its stationary statistics, response to temperature forcing, and\ninterpretability.",

These machine learning techniques overcome computational\nbottlenecks in traditional approaches such as rejection sampling and Markov\nChain Monte Carlo (MCMC), which struggle to generate rare, finely-tuned vacua.\nAs a proof of concept, we demonstrate that conditional generative models\nprovide a more efficient alternative, specifically using conditional\nvariational autoencoders (CVAEs). We introduce a CVAE framework tailored to\nflux compactifications, incorporating physical constraints directly into the\nloss function - enabling the generation of physically consistent vacua beyond\nthe training set. Our experiments on conifold and symmetric torus background\ngeometries show that the CVAE achieves a speedup of about $O(10^3)$ compared to\nMetropolis sampling, particularly in narrow target ranges for superpotential\nvalues. Additionally, the CVAE generates novel, distinct flux configurations\nbeyond the training data, highlighting its potential for probing\ncomputationally challenging regions of the string landscape.

We present a\nproof-of-concept reanalysis of HD~209458~b's JWST transmission spectrum\ntreating He/H$_2$ as a free parameter, resulting in sets of solutions with\nhelium enrichment and non-extreme water abundance. The He-enhancement found\nrequires an order of magnitude less enrichment/evolution than does a water\nabundance of 10\\%, suggesting that the He-rich hypothesis is a viable\nalternative. We argue that He enhancement must be considered to reliably\nconstrain atmospheric composition, be sensitive to a more diverse planetary\npopulation, and ultimately yield robust metallicity trends to inform\nformation/evolution pathways. Looking ahead, we suggest leveraging insights\nfrom differences in pressure-broadening effects, outflow measurements, and\natmospheric chemistry to help disentangle reliably between He- and\nvolatile-rich atmospheres -- while recognizing that existing\nopacity/outflow/chemistry models may need targeted upgrades to reach the\nrequired fidelity level.",

In real-world applications, however, users\noften seek tools to faithfully realize their creative editing intentions with\nprecise and consistent control. Despite the progress achieved by existing\nmethods, ensuring fine-grained alignment with user intentions remains an open\nand challenging problem. In this work, we present Shape-for-Motion, a novel\nframework that incorporates a 3D proxy for precise and consistent video\nediting. Shape-for-Motion achieves this by converting the target object in the\ninput video to a time-consistent mesh, i.e., a 3D proxy, allowing edits to be\nperformed directly on the proxy and then inferred back to the video frames. To\nsimplify the editing process, we design a novel Dual-Propagation Strategy that\nallows users to perform edits on the 3D mesh of a single frame, and the edits\nare then automatically propagated to the 3D meshes of the other frames. The 3D\nmeshes for different frames are further projected onto the 2D space to produce\nthe edited geometry and texture renderings, which serve as inputs to a\ndecoupled video diffusion model for generating edited results. Our framework\nsupports various precise and physically-consistent manipulations across the\nvideo frames, including pose editing, rotation, scaling, translation, texture\nmodification, and object composition. Our approach marks a key step toward\nhigh-quality, controllable video editing workflows. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of our approach.

CLoVE utilizes\nclient embeddings derived from model losses on client data, and leverages the\ninsight that clients in the same cluster share similar loss values, while those\nin different clusters exhibit distinct loss patterns. Based on these\nembeddings, CLoVE is able to iteratively identify and separate clients from\ndifferent clusters and optimize cluster-specific models through federated\naggregation. Key advantages of CLoVE over existing CFL algorithms are (1) its\nsimplicity, (2) its applicability to both supervised and unsupervised settings,\nand (3) the fact that it eliminates the need for near-optimal model\ninitialization, which makes it more robust and better suited for real-world\napplications.

The classic method relies on multiple\nexposures, which slows capture time, resulting in motion artifacts when imaging\ndynamic scenes. Single-shot HDR imaging alleviates this issue by encoding HDR\ndata into a single exposure, then computationally recovering it. Many\nestablished methods use strong image priors to recover improperly exposed image\ndetail. These approaches struggle with extended highlight regions. We utilize\nthe global reset release (GRR) shutter mode of an off-the-shelf sensor. GRR\nshutter mode applies a longer exposure time to rows closer to the bottom of the\nsensor. We use optics that relay a randomly permuted (shuffled) image onto the\nsensor, effectively creating spatially randomized exposures across the scene.\nThe exposure diversity allows us to recover HDR data by solving an optimization\nproblem with a simple total variation image prior. In simulation, we\ndemonstrate that our method outperforms other single-shot methods when many\nsensor pixels are saturated (10% or more), and is competitive at a modest\nsaturation (1%).

    "abstract": "We propose a novel method, basis vector model material indexing (BVM-MI), for\npredicting atomic composition and mass density from two independent basis\nvector model weights derived from dual-energy CT (DECT) for Monte Carlo (MC)\ndose planning. BVM-MI employs multiple linear regression on BVM weights and\ntheir quotient to predict elemental composition and mass density for 70\nrepresentative tissues. Predicted values were imported into the TOPAS MC code\nto simulate proton dose deposition to a uniform cylinder phantom composed of\neach tissue type. The performance of BVM-MI was compared to the conventional\nHounsfield Unit material indexing method (HU-MI), which estimates elemental\ncomposition and density based on CT numbers (HU). Evaluation metrics included\nabsolute errors in predicted elemental compositions and relative percent errors\nin calculated mass density and mean excitation energy. Dose distributions were\nassessed by quantifying absolute error in the depth of 80% maximum scored dose\n(R80) and relative percent errors in stopping power (SP) between MC simulations\nusing HU-MI, BVM-MI, and benchmark compositions. Lateral dose profiles were\nanalyzed at R80 and Bragg Peak (RBP) depths for three tissues showing the\nlargest discrepancies in R80 depth. BVM-MI outperformed HU-MI in elemental\ncomposition predictions, with mean RMSEs of 1.30% (soft tissue) and 0.1% (bony\ntissue), compared to 4.20% and 1.9% for HU-MI. R80 depth RMSEs were 0.2 mm\n(soft) and 0.1 mm (bony) for BVM-MI, vs. 1.8 mm and 0.7 mm for HU-MI. Lateral\ndose profile analysis showed overall smaller dose errors for BVM-MI across\ncore, halo, and proximal aura regions. In conclusion, fully utilizing the\ntwo-parameter BVM space for material indexing led to significantly improved\nTOPAS MC dose calculations over the conventional HU-MI method, demonstrating\nBVM-MI's potential to enhance proton therapy planning.",

While reinforcement learning (RL) offers adaptive control\ncapabilities, existing safe RL methods are ineffective against such attacks. We\npresent ARMOR (Adaptive Robust Manipulation-Optimized State Representations),\nan attack-resilient, model-free RL controller that enables robust UAV operation\nunder adversarial sensor manipulation. Instead of relying on raw sensor\nobservations, ARMOR learns a robust latent representation of the UAV's physical\nstate via a two-stage training framework. In the first stage, a teacher\nencoder, trained with privileged attack information, generates attack-aware\nlatent states for RL policy training. In the second stage, a student encoder is\ntrained via supervised learning to approximate the teacher's latent states\nusing only historical sensor data, enabling real-world deployment without\nprivileged information. Our experiments show that ARMOR outperforms\nconventional methods, ensuring UAV safety. Additionally, ARMOR improves\ngeneralization to unseen attacks and reduces training cost by eliminating the\nneed for iterative adversarial training.",

    "abstract": "In the realm of computational fluid dynamics, traditional numerical methods,\nwhich heavily rely on discretization, typically necessitate the formulation of\npartial differential equations (PDEs) in conservative form to accurately\ncapture shocks and other discontinuities in compressible flows. Conversely,\nutilizing non-conservative forms often introduces significant errors near these\ndiscontinuities or results in smeared shocks. This dependency poses a\nconsiderable limitation, particularly as many PDEs encountered in complex\nphysical phenomena, such as multi-phase flows, are inherently non-conservative.\nThis inherent non-conservativity restricts the direct applicability of standard\nnumerical solvers designed for conservative forms. This work aims to thoroughly\ninvestigate the sensitivity of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to the\nchoice of PDE formulation (conservative vs. non-conservative) when solving\nproblems involving shocks and discontinuities. We have conducted this\ninvestigation across a range of benchmark problems, specifically the Burgers\nequation and both steady and unsteady Euler equations, to provide a\ncomprehensive understanding of PINNs capabilities in this critical area.",

Meanwhile, multi-rotor drones like\nquadcopters have become popular in industrial applications but have not been\nbroadly employed in control education laboratory. Platforms with pendulums and\nmulti-rotor copters present classical yet intriguing multi-degree of freedom\n(DoF) dynamics and coordinate systems for the control system investigation. In\nthis paper, we introduce a novel control platform in which a 2-DoF pendulum\ncapable of azimuth and elevation rotation is actuated through vectored thrust\ngenerated by a quadcopter. Designed as a benchmark for mechatronics and\nnonlinear control education and research, the system integrates detailed\nmechatronic implementation with different control strategies. Specifically, we\napply and compare small perturbation linearization (SPL), state feedback\nlinearization (SFL), and partial feedback linearization (PFL) to the nonlinear\nsystem dynamics. The performances are evaluated by time specifications of step\nresponse and Root-Mean-Square (RMS) error of trajectory tracking. The\nrobustness of the closed-loop system is validated under external disturbances,\nand both simulation and experimental results are presented to highlight the\nstrengths and limitations of the nonlinear model-based control approaches.",

    "abstract": "Economic Model Predictive Control (EMPC), instead of stabilizing a reference\ntrajectory/state in the objective function like a Tracking MPC, optimizes the\neconomic performance over the prediction horizon, making it attractive for\neconomical microgrid (MG) dispatch. However, the demand charge component in the\nmonthly electricity cost, make it difficult to be encapsulated in additive\nstage costs, and can make solutions violate the principle of optimality if\nnaively introduced in the objective function. Moreover, previous EMPC based\nworks mostly rely on a-priori knowledge of an optimal economic steady state or\noptimal periodic trajectory for performance guarantees, which are not useful or\npossibly don't exist respectively, for real-time economical MG dispatch where\nload/generation forecasts are known only 24-48 h in advance. This paper, first,\nproposes an EMPC formulation for a generic deterministic discrete non-linear\ntime varying system with hard state and input constraints, without any a-priori\nrequirements of an optimal economic steady state or optimal periodic\ntrajectory. It is proved that under mild assumptions on terminal cost and\nregion, the asymptotic average economic cost of the proposed method is no worse\nthan the asymptotic average economic cost of any other non-fixed arbitrary\nreference trajectory which is known only until the current time-step. The EMPC\nframework is then leveraged for optimal MG dispatch by showing that the problem\ncan be reformulated to satisfy the assumptions required for the asymptotic\nperformance guarantee. Realistic simulations at the Port of San Diego MG\ndemonstrated that the proposed method can also reduce monthly electricity costs\nin closed-loop with respect to reference trajectories generated by directly\noptimizing the electricity cost function over the prediction horizon or by\ntracking an ideal grid import curve in a majority of the cases.",

However, most evaluations of language models\nrely on static vignettes and multiple-choice questions that fail to reflect the\ncomplexity and nuance of evidence-based medicine in real-world settings. In\nclinical practice, physicians iteratively formulate and revise diagnostic\nhypotheses, adapting each subsequent question and test to what they've just\nlearned, and weigh the evolving evidence before committing to a final\ndiagnosis. To emulate this iterative process, we introduce the Sequential\nDiagnosis Benchmark, which transforms 304 diagnostically challenging New\nEngland Journal of Medicine clinicopathological conference (NEJM-CPC) cases\ninto stepwise diagnostic encounters. A physician or AI begins with a short case\nabstract and must iteratively request additional details from a gatekeeper\nmodel that reveals findings only when explicitly queried. Performance is\nassessed not just by diagnostic accuracy but also by the cost of physician\nvisits and tests performed. We also present the MAI Diagnostic Orchestrator\n(MAI-DxO), a model-agnostic orchestrator that simulates a panel of physicians,\nproposes likely differential diagnoses and strategically selects high-value,\ncost-effective tests. When paired with OpenAI's o3 model, MAI-DxO achieves 80%\ndiagnostic accuracy--four times higher than the 20% average of generalist\nphysicians. MAI-DxO also reduces diagnostic costs by 20% compared to\nphysicians, and 70% compared to off-the-shelf o3. When configured for maximum\naccuracy, MAI-DxO achieves 85.5% accuracy.

This result can be seen as a (-1)-shifted\nversion of the Bialynicki-Birula decomposition for smooth schemes. We obtain\nour result from a similar formula for stacks and Halpern-Leistner's\nTheta-correspondence, at the level of perverse Nori motives, which we use also\nto derive foundational constructions in DT theory, in particular the\nKontsevich-Soibelman wall crossing formula and the construction of the\nCohomological Hall Algebra for smooth projective Calabi-Yau threefolds (a\nsimilar construction of the CoHA was also done independently by Kinjo, Park,\nand Safronov in a recent work). This paper subsumes the previous paper\n\"Hyperbolic localization of the Donaldson-Thomas sheaf\" from the same author.",

Traditional methods, reliant on normal\ndistribution-based or expanded statistics, often fail to identify such minor\neffects because of their inability to handle small discrepancies with\nsufficient sensitivity. This work leverages a counterfactual outcome framework\nand proposes a maximum probability-driven two-armed bandit (TAB) process by\nweighting the mean volatility statistic, which controls Type I error. The\nimplementation of permutation methods further enhances the robustness and\nefficacy. The established strategic central limit theorem (SCLT) demonstrates\nthat our approach yields a more concentrated distribution under the null\nhypothesis and a less concentrated one under the alternative hypothesis,\ngreatly improving statistical power.

Although high-end confocal microscopes are capable of filtering\nout-of-focus light, cheaper and more accessible microscopy modalities, such as\nwidefield microscopy, can not, which consequently leads to hazy image data.\nComputational dehazing is trying to combine the best of both worlds, leading to\ncheap microscopy but crisp-looking images. The perception-distortion trade-off\ntells us that we can optimize either for data fidelity, e.g. low MSE or high\nPSNR, or for data realism, measured by perceptual metrics such as LPIPS or FID.\nExisting methods either prioritize fidelity at the expense of realism, or\nproduce perceptually convincing results that lack quantitative accuracy. In\nthis work, we propose HazeMatching, a novel iterative method for dehazing light\nmicroscopy images, which effectively balances these objectives. Our goal was to\nfind a balanced trade-off between the fidelity of the dehazing results and the\nrealism of individual predictions (samples). We achieve this by adapting the\nconditional flow matching framework by guiding the generative process with a\nhazy observation in the conditional velocity field. We evaluate HazeMatching on\n5 datasets, covering both synthetic and real data, assessing both distortion\nand perceptual quality. Our method is compared against 7 baselines, achieving a\nconsistent balance between fidelity and realism on average. Additionally, with\ncalibration analysis, we show that HazeMatching produces well-calibrated\npredictions. Note that our method does not need an explicit degradation\noperator to exist, making it easily applicable on real microscopy data.

Recent benchmarks, such as MM-R3, highlight that even\nstate-of-the-art VLMs can produce divergent predictions across semantically\nequivalent inputs, despite maintaining high average accuracy. Prior work\naddresses this issue by modifying model architectures or conducting large-scale\nfine-tuning on curated datasets. In contrast, we propose a simple and effective\ntest-time consistency framework that enhances semantic consistency without\nsupervised re-training. Our method is entirely post-hoc, model-agnostic, and\napplicable to any VLM with access to its weights. Given a single test point, we\nenforce consistent predictions via two complementary objectives: (i) a\nCross-Entropy Agreement Loss that aligns predictive distributions across\nsemantically equivalent inputs, and (ii) a Pseudo-Label Consistency Loss that\ndraws outputs toward a self-averaged consensus. Our method is plug-and-play and\nleverages information from a single test input itself to improve consistency.\nExperiments on the MM-R3 benchmark show that our framework yields substantial\ngains in consistency across state-of-the-art models, establishing a new\ndirection for inference-time adaptation in multimodal learning.",

    "abstract": "Silver phenylselenide (AgSePh), known as mithrene, is a two-dimensional (2D)\norganic-inorganic chalcogenide (MOC) semiconductor with a wide direct band gap,\nnarrow blue emission and in-plane anisotropy. However, its application in\nnext-generation optoelectronics is limited by crystal size and orientation, as\nwell as challenges in large-area growth. Here, we introduce a controlled\ntarnishing step on the silver surface prior to the solid-vapor-phase chemical\ntransformation into AgSePh thin films.

The AgSePh thin\nfilms were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron\nmicroscopy (SEM), and grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS).\nThe pre-tarnishing process, combined with organic ligands, resulted in large\ncrystals exceeding 1 ${\\mu}$m and improved homogeneous in-plane orientation,\nwhile also enabling the selective, wafer-scale synthesis of mithrene on 100 mm\nwafers. Furthermore, the films were integrated on planar graphene field-effect\nphototransistors (GFETs) and demonstrated photoresponsivity beyond 100 A/W at\n450 nm, highlighting mithrene's potential for blue light-detection\napplications.",

    "abstract": "Assuming dark matter to be asymmetric as well as self-interacting and\nneutrinos to be Dirac fermions, we propose a framework to address the observed\nbaryon imbalance of the universe. We add three right-handed neutrinos\n$\\nu_{R_i},\\,{i=1,2,3}$, one singlet fermion $\\chi$, a doublet fermion $\\psi$,\nand heavy scalar doublets $\\eta_i,\\,{i=1,2}$ to the Standard Model. Both $\\chi$\nand $\\psi$ are fermions with non-zero charge under an extended $U(1)_{B-L}\n\\times U(1)_D$ symmetry. Additionally, a $\\mathcal{Z}_2$ symmetry is imposed,\nwhere the singlets $\\chi$, $\\nu_R$, and $\\eta$ are negative and the doublet\n$\\psi$ is positive. Given the assumption that neutrinos are Dirac particles,\n$B-L$ turns into an exact symmetry of the universe. The CP-violating\nout-of-equilibrium decay of heavy scalar $\\eta$ generates an equal and opposite\n$B-L$ asymmetry among the left-handed ($\\nu_L$) and right-handed ($\\nu_R$)\nneutrinos. The $\\nu_L-\\nu_R$ equilibration process does not take place until\nbelow the Electroweak phase transition scale because of tiny Yukawa couplings.\nDuring this time, Sphaleron processes, which are active at temperatures higher\nthan 100 GeV, transform a portion of the $B-L$ asymmetry stored in left-handed\nneutrinos into baryon asymmetry. MeV scale gauge boson $Z'$ of $U(1)_D$ sector\nmediates both annihilation of symmetric dark matter component and\nself-interaction among dark matter particles. Moreover, $Z'$ mixes with the\nStandard Model Z-boson and provides a portal for dark matter direct detection.",

To address this, we introduce\nDefeasible Video Entailment (DVidE), a new task that challenges models to think\nlike doubters, constantly updating their reasoning based on evolving evidence.\nIn DVidE, given a video premise and a textual hypothesis, models must determine\nwhether a new update strengthens or weakens the hypothesis (classification\nversion) or generate a coherent update that modifies the entailment\nrelationship (generation version). For solving the classification task, we\npropose the Chain of Counterfactual Thought framework, utilizing counterfactual\nreasoning, ASR-enhanced video content, and rationale refinement to reduce\ninference bias. For the generation task, we develop a framework that combines\nASR output with a Large Language Model (LLM) to produce coherent, contextually\nrelevant updates aligned with the intended strengthener or weakener goals.\nAdditionally, we introduce a novel benchmark dataset, with\nstrengthener/weakener annotations and an LLM-based evaluation metric\nspecifically designed for assessing generative performance.

The NGC 6221\ngroup contains an interacting galaxy pair with tidal debris, along with at\nleast three dwarf galaxies. In contrast, the NGC 3256/3263 group represents a\nloose group consisting of several spiral as well as dwarf galaxies, while a\nmassive elliptical galaxy dominates the NGC 2434 group. Aims. We study the star\nformation activity in all detected galaxies, as it is one of the dominant\nphysical processes in their formation and evolution, seeking evidence of\nenvironmental impact. Methods. We use MeerKAT radio continuum data and archival\nWISE infrared data to locate and measure the star formation rate in all group\nmembers. In particular, we used polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) as\ntracers of gas heated due to star formation activity. Furthermore, we create\nin-band spectral index maps, providing insights into the underlying physical\nprocesses associated with the detected star-forming regions. Results. We found\nthat galaxies are distributed differently in the WISE colour-colour diagram\ndepending on their evolutionary group stage, as expected. Except for ESO\n059-G012, the galaxies in our sample follow the radio-W3PAH correlation. A\npossible scenario that explains the ESO 059-G012 result is that the galaxy has\nalready consumed the gas.

Ultimately, the purity of state-of-the-art single-photon sources was\nfound to be limited by spontaneous emission and subsequent reexcitation during\nthe interaction with the driving field. Here, we demonstrate that even this\nfundamental limit to the single-photon purity can be overcome due to the\ndistinct spectro-temporal properties of the individual photons forming\nmulti-photon errors. For driving pulses shorter than the emitter lifetime, we\nfind that photons emitted during the pulse exhibit a significantly broader\nspectral shape than the emitter's natural linewidth. Thus, we can selectively\nfilter out the majority of this instantaneously emitted photon by employing\nnarrowband spectral filters which reduces the measured degree of second-order\ncoherence at zero time delay by almost one order of magnitude.

    "abstract": "In large-scale communication systems, increasingly complex scenarios require\nmore intelligent collaboration among edge devices collecting various multimodal\nsensory data to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of the environment\nand improve decision-making accuracy. However, conventional federated learning\n(FL) algorithms typically consider unimodal datasets, require identical model\narchitectures, and fail to leverage the rich information embedded in multimodal\ndata, limiting their applicability to real-world scenarios with diverse\nmodalities and varying client capabilities. To address this issue, we propose\nSheaf-DMFL, a novel decentralized multimodal learning framework leveraging\nsheaf theory to enhance collaboration among devices with diverse modalities.\nSpecifically, each client has a set of local feature encoders for its different\nmodalities, whose outputs are concatenated before passing through a\ntask-specific layer. While encoders for the same modality are trained\ncollaboratively across clients, we capture the intrinsic correlations among\nclients' task-specific layers using a sheaf-based structure. To further enhance\nlearning capability, we propose an enhanced algorithm named Sheaf-DMFL-Att,\nwhich tailors the attention mechanism within each client to capture\ncorrelations among different modalities. A rigorous convergence analysis of\nSheaf-DMFL-Att is provided, establishing its theoretical guarantees. Extensive\nsimulations are conducted on real-world link blockage prediction and mmWave\nbeamforming scenarios, demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithms\nin such heterogeneous wireless communication systems.",

In this paper, we aim to address this issue by leveraging Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) to detect and measure gender bias in passage ranking.\nExisting gender fairness metrics rely on lexical- and frequency-based measures,\nleading to various limitations, e.g., missing subtle gender disparities.\nBuilding on our LLM-based gender bias detection method, we introduce a novel\ngender fairness metric, named Class-wise Weighted Exposure (CWEx), aiming to\naddress existing limitations. To measure the effectiveness of our proposed\nmetric and study LLMs' effectiveness in detecting gender bias, we annotate a\nsubset of the MS MARCO Passage Ranking collection and release our new gender\nbias collection, called MSMGenderBias, to foster future research in this area.\nOur extensive experimental results on various ranking models show that our\nproposed metric offers a more detailed evaluation of fairness compared to\nprevious metrics, with improved alignment to human labels (58.77% for\nGrep-BiasIR, and 18.51% for MSMGenderBias, measured using Cohen's Kappa\nagreement), effectively distinguishing gender bias in ranking.

While\nsuch interactions are well established for large systems, such as Pb-Pb\ncollisions, their relevance in smaller collision systems remains unclear.\nConsequently, hadronic interactions during the hadronic phase are studied in pp\ncollisions at $\\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV and p-Pb collisions at\n$\\sqrt{s_{\\rm{NN}}}=5.02$ TeV with the PYTHIA8 event generator. The interaction\nis studied via the yield ratios between resonances and stable particles with\nsimilar quark contents, which are obtained as a function of transverse momentum\n($p_{\\rm{T}}$) using $\\mathrm{\\rho(770)^0}$, $\\mathrm{K^*(892)^0}$, and\n$\\mathrm{\\phi(1020)}$ mesons and their stable particles, $\\mathrm{\\pi^\\pm}$ and\n$\\mathrm{K^\\pm}$ at midrapidity ($|y|<0.5$). Yield ratios are calculated in\nfive multiplicity classes for pp and six for p-Pb collisions, using the\n60-100\\% multiplicity class in pp as a reference. Although rescattering leads\nto stronger suppression at low $p_{\\rm{T}} < 2$ GeV/$c$, a visible suppression\nremains even when rescattering is turned off. To isolate the rescattering\neffect, double ratios between the rescattering on and off configurations are\nobtained.

The lower limit of the\nhadronic phase lifetimes extracted in low-$p_{\\rm{T}}$ region increases with\nmultiplicity in both systems, but with a notable discrepancy between pp and\np-Pb collisions.",

However, the current\npractice of incorporating these helpful physics-informed inductive biases\ninevitably runs into significant manual labor and domain expertise, making them\nprohibitive for general users. This work explores a symbolic approach to\ndistill physics-informed inductive biases into RL agents, where the physics\npriors are expressed in a domain-specific language (DSL) that is human-readable\nand naturally explainable. Yet, the DSL priors do not translate directly into\nan implementable policy due to partial and noisy observations and additional\nphysical constraints in navigation tasks. To address this gap, we develop a\nphysics-informed program-guided RL (PiPRL) framework with applications to\nindoor navigation. PiPRL adopts a hierarchical and modularized neuro-symbolic\nintegration, where a meta symbolic program receives semantically meaningful\nfeatures from a neural perception module, which form the bases for symbolic\nprogramming that encodes physics priors and guides the RL process of a\nlow-level neural controller. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PiPRL\nconsistently outperforms purely symbolic or neural policies and reduces\ntraining time by over 26% with the help of the program-based inductive biases.",

    "abstract": "Accurate weed management is essential for mitigating significant crop yield\nlosses, necessitating effective weed suppression strategies in agricultural\nsystems. Integrating cover crops (CC) offers multiple benefits, including soil\nerosion reduction, weed suppression, decreased nitrogen requirements, and\nenhanced carbon sequestration, all of which are closely tied to the aboveground\nbiomass (AGB) they produce. However, biomass production varies significantly\ndue to microsite variability, making accurate estimation and mapping essential\nfor identifying zones of poor weed suppression and optimizing targeted\nmanagement strategies. To address this challenge, developing a comprehensive CC\nmap, including its AGB distribution, will enable informed decision-making\nregarding weed control methods and optimal application rates. Manual visual\ninspection is impractical and labor-intensive, especially given the extensive\nfield size and the wide diversity and variation of weed species and sizes. In\nthis context, optical imagery and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data are\ntwo prominent sources with unique characteristics that enhance AGB estimation.\nThis study introduces a ground robot-mounted multimodal sensor system designed\nfor agricultural field mapping. The system integrates optical and LiDAR data,\nleveraging machine learning (ML) methods for data fusion to improve biomass\npredictions. The best ML-based model for dry AGB estimation achieved a\ncoefficient of determination value of 0.88, demonstrating robust performance in\ndiverse field conditions. This approach offers valuable insights for\nsite-specific management, enabling precise weed suppression strategies and\npromoting sustainable farming practices.",

This\neffect strengthens as the black holes come closer. We use numerical relativity\ndata to model this so-called tidal heating in the strong gravity regime. We\npresent a frequency-domain approximant for nonspinning black hole binaries that\naccounts for tidal heating effects up to the merger frequency. The approximant\nincludes horizon parameters that characterize the nature of the compact\nobjects.

M3 lowers the technical barrier to\nunderstanding and querying MIMIC-IV data. With a single command it retrieves\nMIMIC-IV from PhysioNet, launches a local SQLite instance (or hooks into the\nhosted BigQuery), and-via the Model Context Protocol (MCP)-lets researchers\nconverse with the database in plain English. Ask a clinical question in natural\nlanguage; M3 uses a language model to translate it into SQL, executes the query\nagainst the MIMIC-IV dataset, and returns structured results alongside the\nunderlying query for verifiability and reproducibility. Demonstrations show\nthat minutes of dialogue with M3 yield the kind of nuanced cohort analyses that\nonce demanded hours of handcrafted SQL and relied on understanding the\ncomplexities of clinical workflows. By simplifying access, M3 invites the\nbroader research community to mine clinical critical-care data and accelerates\nthe translation of raw records into actionable insight.",

    "abstract": "The telecommunications and networking domain stands at the precipice of a\ntransformative era, driven by the necessity to manage increasingly complex,\nhierarchical, multi administrative domains (i.e., several operators on the same\npath) and multilingual systems. Recent research has demonstrated that Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs), with their exceptional general-purpose text analysis\nand code generation capabilities, can be effectively applied to certain telecom\nproblems (e.g., auto-configuration of data plan to meet certain application\nrequirements). However, due to their inherent token-by-token processing and\nlimited capacity for maintaining extended context, LLMs struggle to fulfill\ntelecom-specific requirements such as cross-layer dependency cascades (i.e.,\nover OSI), temporal-spatial fault correlation, and real-time distributed\ncoordination. In contrast, Large Concept Models (LCMs), which reason at the\nabstraction level of semantic concepts rather than individual lexical tokens,\noffer a fundamentally superior approach for addressing these telecom\nchallenges. By employing hyperbolic latent spaces for hierarchical\nrepresentation and encapsulating complex multi-layered network interactions\nwithin concise concept embeddings, LCMs overcome critical shortcomings of LLMs\nin terms of memory efficiency, cross-layer correlation, and native multimodal\nintegration. This paper argues that adopting LCMs is not simply an incremental\nstep, but a necessary evolutionary leap toward achieving robust and effective\nAI-driven telecom management.",

In addition, an implementation of this framework is presented\nthrough AIPassport, an MLOps tool developed within the ProCAncer-I EU project\nfor medical imaging applications. AIPassport automates metadata collection,\nensures proper versioning, decouples results from source scripts, and\nintegrates with various development environments. Its effectiveness is\nshowcased through a lesion segmentation use case using data from the\nProCAncer-I dataset, illustrating how the AI Model Passport enhances\ntransparency, reproducibility, and regulatory readiness while reducing manual\neffort.

MHP enables high-resolution structural\nimaging from hollow diffraction patterns while remaining compatible with\nsimultaneous EELS acquisition. It potentially can provide sub-angstrom lateral\nresolution at intermediate doses and supports full 3D atomic-layer\nreconstruction at ultrahigh doses, with up to 70% of total electrons available\nfor spectroscopy.

    "abstract": "In Major League Baseball, every ballpark is different, with different\ndimensions and climates. These differences make some ballparks more conducive\nto hitting home runs than others. Several factors conspire to make estimation\nof these differences challenging. Home runs are relatively rare, occurring in\nroughly 3\\% of plate appearances. The quality of personnel and the frequency of\nbatter-pitcher handedness combinations that appear in the thirty ballparks vary\nconsiderably. Because of asymmetries, effects due to ballpark can depend\nstrongly on hitter handedness. We consider generalized linear mixed effects\nmodels based on the Poisson distribution for home runs. We use as our\nobservational unit the combination of game and handedness-matchup. Our model\nallows for four theoretical mean home run frequency functions for each\nballpark. We control for variation in personnel across games by constructing\n``elsewhere'' measures of batter ability to hit home runs and pitcher tendency\nto give them up, using data from parks other than the one in which the response\nis observed. We analyze 13 seasons of data and find that the estimated home run\nfrequencies adjusted to average personnel are substantially different from\nobserved home run frequencies, leading to considerably different ballpark\nrankings than often appear in the media.",

    "abstract": "The DisCoCirc framework for natural language processing allows the\nconstruction of compositional models of text, by combining units for individual\nwords together according to the grammatical structure of the text. The\ncompositional nature of a model can give rise to two things: compositional\ngeneralisation -- the ability of a model to generalise outside its training\ndistribution by learning compositional rules underpinning the entire data\ndistribution -- and compositional interpretability -- making sense of how the\nmodel works by inspecting its modular components in isolation, as well as the\nprocesses through which these components are combined. We present these notions\nin a framework-agnostic way using the language of category theory, and adapt a\nseries of tests for compositional generalisation to this setting.\n  Applying this to the DisCoCirc framework, we consider how well a selection of\nmodels can learn to compositionally generalise. We compare both quantum circuit\nbased models, as well as classical neural networks, on a dataset derived from\none of the bAbI tasks, extended to test a series of aspects of\ncompositionality. Both architectures score within 5% of one another on the\nproductivity and substitutivity tasks, but differ by at least 10% for the\nsystematicity task, and exhibit different trends on the overgeneralisation\ntasks. Overall, we find the neural models are more prone to overfitting the\nTrain data. Additionally, we demonstrate how to interpret a compositional model\non one of the trained models.

This work aims to develop\na composite indicator to assess the level of frailty of individuals using\nadministrative health data. Since frailty has a complex, multidimensional\nnature, a multi-outcome approach was used. After an extensive literature\nresearch, some health adverse events were identified to represent frailty.\nThese adverse events were modelled by logistic classifiers, with frailty\ndeterminants (previously selected with a gradient tree boosting) used as\ncovariates. The sensitivity and specificity of individual classifiers are\nexploited to rewrite their combined likelihood. From this combined likelihood,\nwe are able to obtain an indicator capable of measuring the frailty of the\npopulation. The indicator demonstrates strong performance across all outcomes\nfor various years. The main innovation brought by this indicator lies in the\npossibility to use diverse subgroups of frailty determinants specific to each\noutcome, without imposing constraints on their structural form. In conclusion,\nthis indicator has proven to be an efficient tool for quantifying frailty of\nelderly individuals, providing potential help to health authorities in\npreventing frailty-related adverse events.",

To overcome\nthese challenges, we introduce a novel multimodal deep learning (DL) framework\nfor detecting building damage using single-date very high resolution (VHR)\nSynthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery from the Italian Space Agency (ASI)\nCOSMO SkyMed (CSK) constellation, complemented by auxiliary geospatial data.\nOur method integrates SAR image patches, OpenStreetMap (OSM) building\nfootprints, digital surface model (DSM) data, and structural and exposure\nattributes from the Global Earthquake Model (GEM) to improve detection accuracy\nand contextual interpretation. Unlike existing approaches that depend on pre\nand post event imagery, our model utilizes only post event data, facilitating\nrapid deployment in critical scenarios. The framework effectiveness is\ndemonstrated using a new dataset from the 2023 earthquake in Turkey, covering\nmultiple cities with diverse urban settings. Results highlight that\nincorporating geospatial features significantly enhances detection performance\nand generalizability to previously unseen areas. By combining SAR imagery with\ndetailed vulnerability and exposure information, our approach provides reliable\nand rapid building damage assessments without the dependency from available\npre-event data. Moreover, the automated and scalable data generation process\nensures the framework's applicability across diverse disaster-affected regions,\nunderscoring its potential to support effective disaster management and\nrecovery efforts. Code and data will be made available upon acceptance of the\npaper.",

While Bayesian Optimization (BO) has been explored as\nan alternative search strategy for identifying optimal parameters, its\napplication has traditionally been limited to low-dimensional problems. This\nhas contributed to the perception that BO is unsuitable for more realistic CG\nmodels, which often involve a large number of parameters.

In the sample limit, it recovers the Markov\nequivalence class of graphs that describe the data. Still, it faces two\nchallenges in practice: computational cost and finite-sample accuracy. In this\npaper, we develop Less Greedy Equivalence Search (LGES), a variant of GES that\nretains its theoretical guarantees while partially addressing these\nlimitations. LGES modifies the greedy step: rather than always applying the\nhighest-scoring insertion, it avoids edge insertions between variables for\nwhich the score implies some conditional independence. This more targeted\nsearch yields up to a \\(10\\)-fold speed-up and a substantial reduction in\nstructural error relative to GES. Moreover, LGES can guide the search using\nprior assumptions, while correcting these assumptions when contradicted by the\ndata. Finally, LGES can exploit interventional data to refine the learned\nobservational equivalence class. We prove that LGES recovers the true\nequivalence class in the sample limit from observational and interventional\ndata, even with misspecified prior assumptions.

Here, we search for distinct\ntime-domain signatures of the two SCI phenomena in a $\\mathcal{F}$|TI model\nstack of a ferromagnetic-metal layer $\\mathcal{F}$ (Co and Fe) and a\ntopological-insulator layer TI (Bi$_2$Te$_3$, SnBi$_2$Te$_4$ and\nBi$_{1-x}$Sb$_x$ with $x$ = 0.15 and 0.3), where the focus is on Bi$_2$Te$_3$.\nA femtosecond laser pulse serves to induce a transient spin voltage\n$\\mu_s^{\\mathcal{F}}$ in $\\mathcal{F}$ and, thus, drive an ultrafast spin\ncurrent out of $\\mathcal{F}$.

This assignment is fully\nconsistent with respect to its dynamics and magnitude. We rate other possible\nsignal contributions, such as spin trapping in intermediate states, as less\nlikely.

    "abstract": "Power and sample size calculations for Wald tests in generalized linear\nmodels (GLMs) are often limited to specific cases like logistic regression.\nMore general methods typically require detailed study parameters that are\ndifficult to obtain during planning. We introduce two new effect size measures\nfor estimating power, sample size, or the minimally detectable effect size in\nstudies using Wald tests across any GLM. These measures accommodate any number\nof predictors or adjusters and require only basic study information. We provide\npractical guidance for interpreting and applying these measures to approximate\na key parameter in power calculations. We also derive asymptotic bounds on the\nrelative error of these approximations, showing that accuracy depends on\nfeatures of the GLM such as the nonlinearity of the link function. To\ncomplement this analysis, we conduct simulation studies across common model\nspecifications, identifying best use cases and opportunities for improvement.\nFinally, we test the methods in finite samples to confirm their practical\nutility.",

The core of the attack leverages DLL\nside-loading, where a legitimate executable from Valve Corporation is used to\nload a trojanized DLL, thereby bypassing standard security defenses.\n  Once active, the malware, a variant of QuasarRAT known as BlotchyQuasar, is\ncapable of a wide range of malicious activities. It is designed to steal\nsensitive browser-stored credentials and banking information, the latter\nthrough fake login windows mimicking well-known Brazilian banks.

Through legal and ethical\nanalysis, we show that while individuals can consent to the initial use of\ntheir data for AI training, they cannot meaningfully consent to the numerous\npotential outputs their data might enable or the extent to which the output is\nused or distributed. We identify three fundamental challenges: the scope\nproblem, the temporality problem, and the autonomy trap, which collectively\ncreate what we term a ''consent gap'' in AI systems and their surrounding\necosystem. We argue that current legal frameworks inadequately address these\nemerging challenges, particularly regarding individual autonomy, identity\nrights, and social responsibility, especially in cases where AI-generated\ncontent creates new forms of personal representation beyond the scope of the\noriginal consent. By examining how these consent limitations intersect with\nbroader principles of responsible AI (including fairness, transparency,\naccountability, and autonomy) we demonstrate the need to evolve ethical and\nlegal approaches to consent.",

    "abstract": "The vast growth of data has rendered traditional manual inspection\ninfeasible, necessitating the adoption of computational methods for efficient\ndata exploration. Topic modeling has emerged as a powerful tool for analyzing\nlarge-scale textual datasets, enabling the extraction of latent semantic\nstructures. However, existing methods for topic modeling often struggle to\nprovide interpretable representations that facilitate deeper insights into data\nstructure and content. In this paper, we propose FAT-CAT, an approach based on\nFormal Concept Analysis (FCA) to enhance meaningful topic aggregation and\nvisualization of discovered topics. Our approach can handle diverse topics and\nfile types -- grouped by directories -- to construct a concept lattice that\noffers a structured, hierarchical representation of their topic distribution.\nIn a case study on the ETYNTKE dataset, we evaluate the effectiveness of our\napproach against other representation methods to demonstrate that FCA-based\naggregation provides more meaningful and interpretable insights into dataset\ncomposition than existing topic modeling techniques.",

    "abstract": "Correcting astigmatism and ellipticity in laser beams is critical for\nimproving performance in many applications like microscopy, atomic physics,\nquantum information processing, and advanced manufacturing. Passive correction\nmethods based on cylindrical lens telescopes require choosing lenses with\nprecise focal lengths, effectively limiting the range of tunability when using\nstandard catalog optics. Active solutions based on diffractive optical elements\ncan achieve superior performance, but they are bulky, expensive, and suffer\nfrom finite diffraction efficiency and added complexity. Here, we introduce a\nsimple method to convert astigmatic elliptical beams into circular Gaussian\nbeams without astigmatism. Our method comprises three cylindrical lenses. The\nfirst lens focuses the beam along its major axis to create a plane where the\nintensity profile is radially symmetric. The second and third lenses are placed\none behind the other in that plane at a relative angle, acting as a biaxial\nlens pair with tunable focal lengths. By adjusting the relative angle of the\nlenses, the two separate beam waists of the astigmatic beam can be overlapped,\nresulting in a circular Gaussian beam without astigmatism. We theoretically\nvalidate our method, numerically quantify its robustness to experimental\nimperfections, and experimentally demonstrate its ability to circularize the\noutput beam of a commercial laser source. Our method corrects astigmatism and\nellipticity in laser beams without requiring precise focal length matching,\noffering greater flexibility than other passive solutions and greater\ncost-effectiveness than active methods. Its simple and compact design makes it\nwell suited for integration into both tabletop optical setups and industrial\nsystems.",

Recent alternatives address sampling speed via trajectory\nstraightening, mini-batch coupling or distillation.

In this work, we propose to accelerate CFM and introduce an\ninterpretable representation of its dynamics by integrating Koopman operator\ntheory, which models non-linear flows as linear evolution in a learned space of\nobservables. We introduce a decoder-free Koopman-CFM architecture that learns\nan embedding where the generative dynamics become linear, enabling closed-form,\none-step sampling via matrix exponentiation. This results in significant\nspeedups over traditional CFM as demonstrated on controlled 2D datasets and\nreal-world benchmarks, MNIST, Fashion-MNIST (F-MNIST), and the Toronto Face\nDataset (TFD).

Randomness of measurements is then quantified by the guessing\nprobability of this eavesdropper, when minimized over all possible input\nstates. This optimization is in general hard to compute, but we solve it here\nfor any two-outcome qubit measurement and for projective measurements in\narbitrary dimension mixed with white noise. We also construct, for a given\nmeasured probability distribution, different realizations with (i) a noisy\nstate and noiseless measurement (ii) a noiseless state and noisy measurement\nand (iii) a noisy state and measurement, and we show that the latter gives an\neavesdropper significantly higher guessing power.",

    "abstract": "Generating realistic 3D indoor scenes from user inputs remains a challenging\nproblem in computer vision and graphics, requiring careful balance of geometric\nconsistency, spatial relationships, and visual realism. While neural generation\nmethods often produce repetitive elements due to limited global spatial\nreasoning, procedural approaches can leverage constraints for controllable\ngeneration but struggle with multi-constraint scenarios. When constraints\nbecome numerous, object collisions frequently occur, forcing the removal of\nfurniture items and compromising layout completeness.\n  To address these limitations, we propose RoomCraft, a multi-stage pipeline\nthat converts real images, sketches, or text descriptions into coherent 3D\nindoor scenes. Our approach combines a scene generation pipeline with a\nconstraint-driven optimization framework. The pipeline first extracts\nhigh-level scene information from user inputs and organizes it into a\nstructured format containing room type, furniture items, and spatial relations.\nIt then constructs a spatial relationship network to represent furniture\narrangements and generates an optimized placement sequence using a\nheuristic-based depth-first search (HDFS) algorithm to ensure layout coherence.\nTo handle complex multi-constraint scenarios, we introduce a unified constraint\nrepresentation that processes both formal specifications and natural language\ninputs, enabling flexible constraint-oriented adjustments through a\ncomprehensive action space design. Additionally, we propose a Conflict-Aware\nPositioning Strategy (CAPS) that dynamically adjusts placement weights to\nminimize furniture collisions and ensure layout completeness.\n  Extensive experiments demonstrate that RoomCraft significantly outperforms\nexisting methods in generating realistic, semantically coherent, and visually\nappealing room layouts across diverse input modalities.",

In this work, we explore this\nconcept in the context of continuous-variable quantum systems, focusing on\nGaussian states and general-dyne (Gaussian) measurements. We derive a general\nexpression for the daemonic ergotropy and examine two key scenarios: (i)\nbipartite Gaussian states where a general-dyne measurement is performed on one\nof the two parties, and (ii) open Gaussian quantum systems under continuous\ngeneral-dyne monitoring of the environment. Remarkably, we show that for\nsingle-mode Gaussian states, the ergotropy depends solely on the state's energy\nand purity. This enables us to express the daemonic ergotropy as a simple\nfunction of the unconditional energy and the purity of the conditional states,\nrevealing that enhanced daemonic work extraction is directly linked to\nmeasurement-induced purification. We illustrate our findings through two\nparadigmatic examples: extracting daemonic work from a two-mode squeezed\nthermal state and from a continuously monitored optical parametric oscillator.\nIn both case we identify the optimal general-dyne strategies that maximize the\nconditional purity and, in turn, the daemonic ergotropy.",

Our aim is to concatenate a stack 2D free-breathing\nreal-time cines and use Deep Learning (DL) to create an isotropic a fully\nsegmented 3D cine dataset from these images. Methods: Four DL models were\ntrained on open-source data that performed: a) Interslice contrast correction;\nb) Interslice respiratory motion correction; c) Super-resolution (slice\ndirection); and d) Segmentation of right and left atria and ventricles (RA, LA,\nRV, and LV), thoracic aorta (Ao) and pulmonary arteries (PA). In 10 patients\nundergoing routine cardiovascular examination, our method was validated on\nprospectively acquired sagittal stacks of real-time cine images. Quantitative\nmetrics (ventricular volumes and vessel diameters) and image quality of the 3D\ncines were compared to conventional breath hold cine and whole heart imaging.\nResults: All real-time data were successfully transformed into 3D cines with a\ntotal post-processing time of <1 min in all cases. There were no significant\nbiases in any LV or RV metrics with reasonable limits of agreement and\ncorrelation. There is also reasonable agreement for all vessel diameters,\nalthough there was a small but significant overestimation of RPA diameter.\nConclusion: We have demonstrated the potential of creating a 3D-cine data from\nconcatenated 2D real-time cine images using a series of DL models.

Previous efforts have explored visual token reduction either prior to\nor within the large language models (LLMs). However, most in-LLM reduction\napproaches rely on text-conditioned interactions, implicitly assuming that\ntextual tokens can reliably capture the importance of visual tokens. In this\nwork, we revisit this assumption and reveal causal, semantic, and spatial forms\nof cross-modal misalignment. These misalignments undermine the effectiveness of\ntext-guided visual token reduction. To address this, we introduce VisionDrop, a\ntraining-free, visual-only pruning framework that selects informative visual\ntokens based on intra-modal (visual-to-visual) attention, without relying on\ntextual signals. To further suppress redundancy throughout the model hierarchy,\nwe treat the visual encoder and the LLM as a unified system and design a\nprogressive pruning pipeline. Our method performs dominant token selection and\nlightweight contextual merging at multiple stages, enabling fine-grained visual\ninformation to be retained even under aggressive token budgets. Extensive\nexperiments across diverse benchmarks show that VisionDrop achieves consistent\nimprovements over existing approaches, despite requiring no additional training\nor complex modifications.

    "abstract": "3D Cone-Beam CT (CBCT) is widely used in radiotherapy but suffers from motion\nartifacts due to breathing. A common clinical approach mitigates this by\nsorting projections into respiratory phases and reconstructing images per\nphase, but this does not account for breathing variability. Dynamic CBCT\ninstead reconstructs images at each projection, capturing continuous motion\nwithout phase sorting. Recent advancements in 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS)\noffer powerful tools for modeling dynamic scenes, yet their application to\ndynamic CBCT remains underexplored. Existing 4DGS methods, such as HexPlane,\nuse implicit motion representations, which are computationally expensive. While\nexplicit low-rank motion models have been proposed, they lack spatial\nregularization, leading to inconsistencies in Gaussian motion. To address these\nlimitations, we introduce a free-form deformation (FFD)-based spatial basis\nfunction and a deformation-informed framework that enforces consistency by\ncoupling the temporal evolution of Gaussian's mean position, scale, and\nrotation under a unified deformation field. We evaluate our approach on six\nCBCT datasets, demonstrating superior image quality with a 6x speedup over\nHexPlane. These results highlight the potential of deformation-informed 4DGS\nfor efficient, motion-compensated CBCT reconstruction. The code is available at\nhttps://github.com/Yuliang-Huang/DIGS.",

    "abstract": "Magnetism in strongly correlated honeycomb systems with $d^5$ electronic\nconfiguration has garnered significant attention due to its potential to\nrealize the Kitaev spin liquid state, characterized by exotic properties.\nHowever, real materials exhibit not only Kitaev exchange interactions but also\nother magnetic exchanges, which may drive the transition from a spin liquid\nphase to a long-range ordered ground state. This work focuses on modelling the\neffective spin Hamiltonian for two-dimensional (2D) honeycomb magnetic systems\nwith $d^5$ electronic configurations. The Hubbard-Kanamori (HK) Hamiltonian\nequipped with spin-orbit coupling and electron correlations is considered where\nonsite energies and hopping parameters, preserving the crystal symmetry, are\nextracted from the first principles Density functional theory (DFT)\ncalculations. Exact diagonalization (ED) calculations for the HK Hamiltonian on\na two-site cluster are performed to construct the effective magnetic\nHamiltonian. The ground-state magnetic properties are explored using the\nsemi-classical Luttinger-Tisza approach. As a representative case, the magnetic\nground state of the $d^5$ honeycomb system OsCl$_3$ is investigated, and the\nvariation of magnetic exchange parameters with respect to the correlation\nstrength (U) and Hund's coupling ($J_H$) is analyzed. The magnetic ground state\nexhibits zigzag antiferromagnetic ordering for a chosen value of $U$ and $J_H$,\nconsistent with DFT results. This study provides insight into the magnetism of\nOsCl$_3$ and offers a computationally efficient alternative to traditional\nenergy-based methods for calculating exchange interactions for strongly\ncorrelated systems.",

    "abstract": "Robust regression models in the presence of outliers have significant\npractical relevance in areas such as signal processing, financial econometrics,\nand energy management. Many existing robust regression methods, either grounded\nin statistical theory or sparse signal recovery, typically rely on the explicit\nor implicit assumption of outlier sparsity to filter anomalies and recover the\nunderlying signal or data. However, these methods often suffer from limited\nrobustness or high computational complexity, rendering them inefficient for\nlarge-scale problems. In this work, we propose a novel robust regression model\nbased on a Self-scaled Approximate l0 Regularization Model (SARM) scheme. By\nintroducing a self-scaling mechanism into the regularization term, the proposed\nmodel mitigates the negative impact of uneven or excessively large outlier\nmagnitudes on robustness. We also develop an alternating minimization algorithm\ngrounded in Proximal Operators and Block Coordinate Descent. We rigorously\nprove the algorithm convergence. Empirical comparisons with several\nstate-of-the-art robust regression methods demonstrate that SARM not only\nachieves superior robustness but also significantly improves computational\nefficiency. Motivated by both the theoretical error bound and empirical\nobservations, we further design a Two-Stage SARM (TSSARM) framework, which\nbetter utilizes sample information when the singular values of the design\nmatrix are widely spread, thereby enhancing robustness under certain\nconditions. Finally, we validate our approach on a real-world load forecasting\ntask. The experimental results show that our method substantially enhances the\nrobustness of load forecasting against adversarial data attacks, which is\nincreasingly critical in the era of heightened data security concerns.",

    "abstract": "The mechanism by which odorants are recognized by olfactory receptors remains\nprimarily unresolved. While charge transport is believed to play a significant\nrole, its precise nature is still unclear. Here, we present a novel perspective\nby exploring the interplay between the intrinsic energy scales of odorant\nmolecules and the gap states that facilitate intermolecular charge transport.\nWe find that odorants act as weak tunneling conductors mainly because of the\nlimited magnitude of electronic coupling. This behavior is further connected to\nelectron-phonon interactions and reorganization energy, suggesting that\nphysically meaningful values for these parameters emerge only in the deep\noff-resonant tunneling regime. These findings complement the swipe card model\nof olfaction, in which an odorant needs both the right shape to bind to a\nreceptor and the correct vibrational frequency to trigger signal transduction.\nMoreover, they reveal that the underlying mechanisms are much more complex than\npreviously assumed.",

    "abstract": "Let $f$ and $f'$ be genus $2$ cuspidal Siegel paramodular newforms. We prove\nthat if their Hecke eigenvalues $a_p$ and $a_p'$ satisfy a non-trivial\npolynomial relation $P(a_p, a_p') = 0$ for a set of primes $p$ of positive\ndensity, then $f$ and $f'$ are twists of each other by a Dirichlet character.\nIn particular, if both forms have trivial nebentypus, then they differ by a\nquadratic twist. This result extends the strong multiplicity one theorem, which\nhandles the case $P(x,y) = x - y$, to arbitrary polynomial relations.\n  Our proof analyses the image of the product Galois representation attached to\nthe pair $(f, f')$: we show that this image is as large as possible, unless $f$\nis a twist of $f'$.\n  Our results also apply to elliptic modular forms. They therefore provide a\nunified method for distinguishing both elliptic and Siegel modular forms based\non their Hecke data, including their Hecke eigenvalues, Satake parameters,\nSato--Tate angles, and the coefficients of their $L$-functions. We apply our\nmethods to recover and generalise a range of existing results and to prove new\nones in both the elliptic and Siegel settings.",

In this paper, we present a new filtration constructed from\na directed graph, called the walk-length filtration. This filtration mirrors\nthe behavior of small walks visiting certain collections of vertices in the\ndirected graph. We show that, while the persistence is not stable under the\nusual $L_\\infty$-style network distance, a generalized $L_1$-style distance is,\nindeed, stable.

    "abstract": "Efficiently ranking relevant items from large candidate pools is a\ncornerstone of modern information retrieval systems -- such as web search,\nrecommendation, and retrieval-augmented generation. Listwise rerankers, which\nimprove relevance by jointly considering multiple candidates, are often limited\nin practice: either by model input size constraints, or by degraded quality\nwhen processing large sets. We propose a model-agnostic method for fast\nreranking large sets that exceed a model input limits. The method first\npartitions candidate items into overlapping blocks, each of which is ranked\nindependently in parallel. Implicit pairwise comparisons are then derived from\nthese local rankings. Finally, these comparisons are aggregated to construct a\nglobal ranking using algorithms such as Winrate or PageRank. Experiments on\nTREC DL-2019 show that our method achieves an nDCG@10 of 70.88 compared to the\n57.68 for full-context listwise approach using gpt-4.1-mini as long-context\nmodel, while reducing latency from 21 to 8 seconds.\n  The implementation of the algorithm and the experiments is available in the\nrepository: https://github.com/V3RGANz/jointrank",

    "abstract": "In this work we study shortest path problems in multimode graphs, a\ngeneralization of the min-distance measure introduced by Abboud, Vassilevska W.\nand Wang in [SODA'16]. A multimode shortest path is the shortest path using one\nof multiple `modes' of transportation that cannot be combined. This represents\nreal-world scenarios where different modes are not combinable, such as flights\noperated by different airlines. More precisely, a $k$-multimode graph is a\ncollection of $k$ graphs on the same vertex set and the $k$-mode distance\nbetween two vertices is defined as the minimum among the distances computed in\neach individual graph.\n  We focus on approximating fundamental graph parameters on these graphs,\nspecifically diameter and radius. In undirected multimode graphs we first show\nan elegant linear time 3-approximation algorithm for 2-mode diameter. We then\nextend this idea into a general subroutine that can be used as a part of any\n$\\alpha$-approximation, and use it to construct a 2 and 2.5 approximation\nalgorithm for 2-mode diameter. For undirected radius, we introduce a general\nscheme that can compute a 3-approximation of the $k$-mode radius for any $k$.\nIn the directed case we develop novel techniques to construct a linear time\nalgorithm to determine whether the diameter is finite.\n  We also develop many conditional fine-grained lower bounds for various\nmultimode diameter and radius approximation problems. We are able to show that\nmany of our algorithms are tight under popular fine-grained complexity\nhypotheses, including our linear time 3-approximation for $3$-mode undirected\ndiameter and radius. As part of this effort we propose the first extension to\nthe Hitting Set Hypothesis [SODA'16], which we call the $\\ell$-Hitting Set\nHypothesis. We use this hypothesis to prove the first parameterized lower bound\ntradeoff for radius approximation algorithms.",

    "abstract": "Wi-Fi networks have long relied on the Enhanced Distributed Channel Access\n(EDCA) mechanism, allowing stations to compete for transmission opportunities.\nHowever, as networks become denser and emerging applications demand lower\nlatency and higher reliability, the limitations of EDCA such as overhead due to\ncontention and collisions have become more pronounced. To address these\nchallenges, Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) has been\nintroduced in Wi-Fi, enabling more efficient channel utilization through\nscheduled resource allocation. Furthermore, Wi-Fi 6 defines Uplink Orthogonal\nFrequency Division Multiple Random Access (UORA), a hybrid mechanism that\ncombines both scheduled and random access, balancing efficiency and\nresponsiveness in resource allocation. Despite significant research on UORA,\nmost studies rely on custom simulators that are not publicly available,\nlimiting reproducibility and preventing validation of the presented results.\nThe only known open-source UORA implementation in the ns-3 simulator exhibits\nkey limitations, such as usage of the same trigger frame (TF) to schedule\nresources for buffer status reports and data transmissions, and lack of\nsignaling for UORA configuration. In this paper, we present a fully\nstandard-compliant and open source UORA implementation that is compatible with\nns-3 version 3.38, addressing these limitations to improve resource allocation\nefficiency and adaptability. This implementation enables more accurate and\nflexible evaluation of UORA, fostering future research on Wi-Fi resource\nallocation strategies.",

In the present work, an extended theoretical study of\nthis three-body F\\\"orster resonance is performed for various spatial\nconfigurations of three interacting Rb Rydberg atoms and conditions for their\nexperimental implementation are determined.

    "abstract": "We investigate the accuracy and range of validity of the perturbative model\nfor the 2-point (2PCF) and 3-point (3PCF) correlation functions in real space\nin view of the forthcoming analysis of the Euclid mission spectroscopic sample.\nWe take advantage of clustering measurements from four snapshots of the\nFlagship I N-body simulations at z = {0.9, 1.2, 1.5, 1.8}, which mimic the\nexpected galaxy population in the ideal case of absence of observational\neffects such as purity and completeness. For the 3PCF we consider all available\ntriangle configurations given a minimal separation. First, we assess the model\nperformance by fixing the cosmological parameters and evaluating the\ngoodness-of-fit provided by the perturbative bias expansion in the joint\nanalysis of the two statistics, finding overall agreement with the data down to\nseparations of 20 Mpc/h. Subsequently, we build on the state-of-the-art and\nextend the analysis to include the dependence on three cosmological parameters:\nthe amplitude of scalar perturbations As, the matter density {\\omega}cdm and\nthe Hubble parameter h. To achieve this goal, we develop an emulator capable of\ngenerating fast and robust modelling predictions for the two summary\nstatistics, allowing efficient sampling of the joint likelihood function. We\ntherefore present the first joint full-shape analysis of the real-space 2PCF\nand 3PCF, testing the consistency and constraining power of the perturbative\nmodel across both probes, and assessing its performance in a combined\nlikelihood framework. We explore possible systematic uncertainties induced by\nthe perturbative model at small scales finding an optimal scale cut of rmin =\n30 Mpc/h for the 3PCF, when imposing an additional limitation on nearly\nisosceles triangular configurations included in the data vector. This work is\npart of a Euclid Preparation series validating theoretical models for galaxy\nclustering.",

    "abstract": "Spatiotemporal forecasting tasks, such as traffic flow, combustion dynamics,\nand weather forecasting, often require complex models that suffer from low\ntraining efficiency and high memory consumption. This paper proposes a\nlightweight framework, Spectral Decoupled Knowledge Distillation (termed SDKD),\nwhich transfers the multi-scale spatiotemporal representations from a complex\nteacher model to a more efficient lightweight student network. The teacher\nmodel follows an encoder-latent evolution-decoder architecture, where its\nlatent evolution module decouples high-frequency details and low-frequency\ntrends using convolution and Transformer (global low-frequency modeler).\nHowever, the multi-layer convolution and deconvolution structures result in\nslow training and high memory usage. To address these issues, we propose a\nfrequency-aligned knowledge distillation strategy, which extracts multi-scale\nspectral features from the teacher's latent space, including both high and low\nfrequency components, to guide the lightweight student model in capturing both\nlocal fine-grained variations and global evolution patterns. Experimental\nresults show that SDKD significantly improves performance, achieving reductions\nof up to 81.3% in MSE and in MAE 52.3% on the Navier-Stokes equation dataset.\nThe framework effectively captures both high-frequency variations and long-term\ntrends while reducing computational complexity.

In ecosystems, the\nemergence of spatial patterns has traditionally been interpreted as a possible\n'early warning signal' for tipping. More recently, however, pattern formation\nhas been proposed to serve a fundamentally different role: as a mechanism\nthrough which an (eco)system may 'evade tipping' by forming stable patterns\nthat persist beyond the tipping point.\n  Mathematically, tipping is typically associated with a saddle-node\nbifurcation, while pattern formation is normally driven by a Turing\nbifurcation. Therefore, we study the co-dimension 2 Turing-fold bifurcation and\ninvestigate the question: 'When can patterns initiated by the Turing\nbifurcation enable a system to evade tipping?'\n  We develop our approach for a class of phase-field models and subsequently\napply it to $n$-component reaction-diffusion systems -- a class of PDEs often\nused in ecosystem modeling. We demonstrate that a two-component system of\nmodulation equations governs pattern formation near a Turing-fold bifurcation,\nand that tipping will be evaded when a critical parameter, $\\beta$, is\npositive. We derive explicit expressions for $\\beta$, allowing one to determine\nwhether a given system may evade tipping. Moreover, we show numerically that\nthis system exhibits rich behavior, ranging from stable, stationary, spatially\nquasi-periodic patterns to irregular, spatio-temporal, chaos-like dynamics.",

However,\nmethods to detect these repolarisation abnormalities are limited.\n  In this study, we introduce and assess a novel simulation-based method to\ninfer ventricular activation and repolarisation times from the 12-lead\nelectrocardiogram (ECG) and magnetic resonance-derived ventricular anatomical\nreconstruction, applicable for the first time to both healthy controls and\ncases with abnormal repolarisation.\n  First, ventricular activation times were reconstructed through iterative\nrefinement of early activation sites and conduction velocities, until the model\nand target QRS complexes matched. Then, ventricular repolarisation times were\nreconstructed through iterative refinement of ventricular action potential\ndurations and an action potential shape parameter until the model and target T\nwaves matched, including regularisation. Repolarisation inference was evaluated\nagainst 18 benchmark simulations with known repolarisation times, including\nboth control and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) cases with abnormal\nrepolarisation.\n  Inferred repolarisation times showed good agreement with the ground truth in\ncontrol and HCM (Spearman r=0.63+/-0.11 and 0.65+/-0.19, respectively), with\ninferred model T waves closely matching the target T waves (r=0.81+/-0.05 and\n0.78+/-0.08, respectively). The method further demonstrated flexibility in\nreconstructing the macroscopic patterns of delayed repolarisation across a\nrange of abnormal ventricular repolarisation sequences, demonstrating\napplicability to a range of pathological cases.\n  Simulation-based inference can accurately reconstruct repolarisation times\nfrom the 12-lead ECG in cases with both normal and abnormal repolarisation\npatterns.",

However, these inputs are often incomplete, resulting\nin a dispersed conditional action distribution-an issue we refer to as\ncoordinate system chaos and state chaos. This inconsistency significantly\nhampers pretraining efficiency. To address this, we propose 4D-VLA, a novel\napproach that effectively integrates 4D information into the input to mitigate\nthese sources of chaos. Our model introduces depth and temporal information\ninto visual features with sequential RGB-D inputs, aligning the coordinate\nsystems of the robot and the scene. This alignment endows the model with strong\nspatiotemporal reasoning capabilities while minimizing training overhead.\nAdditionally, we introduce memory bank sampling, a frame sampling strategy\ndesigned to extract informative frames from historical images, further\nimproving effectiveness and efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that\nour pretraining method and architectural components substantially enhance model\nperformance. In both simulated and real-world experiments, our model achieves a\nsignificant increase in success rate over OpenVLA.

    "abstract": "Understanding the impact of small quantum gate perturbations, which are\ncommon in quantum digital devices but absent in classical computers, is crucial\nfor identifying potential advantages in quantum machine learning. While these\nperturbations are typically seen as detrimental to quantum computation, they\ncan actually enhance performance by serving as a natural source of data\naugmentation. Additionally, they can often be efficiently simulated on\nclassical hardware, enabling quantum-inspired approaches to improve classical\nmachine learning methods. In this paper, we investigate random Bloch sphere\nrotations, which are fundamental SU(2) transformations, as a simple yet\neffective quantum-inspired data augmentation technique. Unlike conventional\naugmentations such as flipping, rotating, or cropping, quantum transformations\nlack intuitive spatial interpretations, making their application to tasks like\nimage classification less straightforward. While common quantum augmentation\nmethods rely on applying quantum models or trainable quanvolutional layers to\nclassical datasets, we focus on the direct application of small-angle Bloch\nrotations and their effect on classical data. Using the large-scale ImageNet\ndataset, we demonstrate that our quantum-inspired augmentation method improves\nimage classification performance, increasing Top-1 accuracy by 3%, Top-5\naccuracy by 2.5%, and the F$_1$ score from 8% to 12% compared to standard\nclassical augmentation methods. Finally, we examine the use of stronger unitary\naugmentations. Although these transformations preserve information in\nprinciple, they result in visually unrecognizable images with potential\napplications for privacy computations. However, we show that our augmentation\napproach and simple SU(2) transformations do not enhance differential privacy\nand discuss the implications of this limitation.",

The limitation of this idea is that it stems from a\nfirst-order approximation in the riblet-size parameter $s^+$, and as a\nconsequence it cannot predict other than a linear dependence of drag reduction\nupon $s^+$; in other words, the initial slope of the drag-reduction curve.

Yet such integration is more urgent than ever, as the\nrecent success of artificial intelligence has been driven largely by machine\nlearning -- a field historically developed alongside statistics. Today, the\nboundary between statistics and machine learning is increasingly blurred. What\nwe now need is integration, twice over: of history and philosophy, and of two\nfields they engage -- statistics and machine learning. I present a case study\nof a philosophical idea in machine learning (and in formal epistemology) whose\nroot can be traced back to an often under-appreciated insight in Neyman and\nPearson's 1936 work (a follow-up to their 1933 classic). This leads to the\narticulation of an epistemological principle -- largely implicit in, but shared\nby, the practices of frequentist statistics and machine learning -- which I\ncall achievabilism: the thesis that the correct standard for assessing\nnon-deductive inference methods should not be fixed, but should instead be\nsensitive to what is achievable in specific problem contexts. Another\nintegration also emerges at the level of methodology, combining two ends of the\nphilosophy of science spectrum: history and philosophy of science on the one\nhand, and formal epistemology on the other hand.",

Neighbor embedding (NE) algorithms, such as t-SNE and UMAP,\nare widely used to embed high-dimensional single-cell data into low dimensions.\nBut they often introduce undesirable distortions, resulting in misleading\ninterpretations. Existing evaluation methods for NE algorithms primarily focus\non separating discrete cell types rather than capturing continuous cell-state\ntransitions, while dynamic modeling approaches rely on strong assumptions about\ncellular processes and specialized data. To address these challenges, we build\non the Predictability-Computability-Stability (PCS) framework for reliable and\nreproducible data-driven discoveries. First, we systematically evaluate popular\nNE algorithms through empirical analysis, simulation, and theory, and reveal\ntheir key shortcomings, such as artifacts and instability. We then introduce\nNESS, a principled and interpretable machine learning approach to improve NE\nrepresentations by leveraging algorithmic stability and to enable robust\ninference of smooth biological structures. NESS offers useful concepts,\nquantitative stability metrics, and efficient computational workflows to\nuncover developmental trajectories and cell-state transitions in single-cell\ndata. Finally, we apply NESS to six single-cell datasets, spanning pluripotent\nstem cell differentiation, organoid development, and multiple tissue-specific\nlineage trajectories. Across these diverse contexts, NESS consistently yields\nuseful biological insights, such as identification of transitional and stable\ncell states and quantification of transcriptional dynamics during development.",

Our experiments on the publicly available\nASOCA dataset show that utilizing these features leads to better CVD\nclassification accuracy (87.50\\%) when compared against classification model\ntrained directly on raw CT images (67.50\\%).

The problem is\nparticularly challenging due to the presence of memory integrals and delayed\nstates, which necessitate strengthening the classical controllability\nrequirement to ensure complete rest at the final time. To address this, we\nadopt the notion of Delay and memory-type null controllability, which demands\nthe vanishing of the state, the accumulated memory term, and the influence of\ndelay at the terminal time. Utilizing duality arguments, we reduce the\ncontrollability analysis to proving suitable observability inequalities for the\ncorresponding adjoint system. We begin with finite-dimensional systems and\nestablish rank-type conditions characterizing controllability. These insights\nare then extended to parabolic partial differential equations with delay and\nmemory terms.

We present\nadvances in the research program of causal decompositions, which investigates\nthe existence of an equivalence between the causal and the compositional\nstructures of unitary channels. Our results concern one-dimensional Quantum\nCellular Automata (1D QCAs), i.e. unitary channels over a line of $N$ quantum\nsystems (with or without periodic boundary conditions) that feature a causality\nradius $r$: a given input cannot causally influence outputs at a distance more\nthan $r$. We prove that, for $N \\geq 4r + 1$, 1D QCAs all admit causal\ndecompositions: a unitary channel is a 1D QCA if and only if it can be\ndecomposed into a unitary routed circuit of nearest-neighbour interactions, in\nwhich its causal structure is compositionally obvious. This provides the first\nconstructive form of 1D QCAs with causality radius one or more, fully\nelucidating their structure.

    "abstract": "We present a geometric construction of irreversible dynamics on Poisson\nmanifolds that satisfies the axioms of metriplectic mechanics and the GENERIC\nframework. Our approach relies solely on the underlying Poisson structure and\nits deformation theory, without requiring any additional metric structure.\nSpecifically, we show that if the second Lichnerowicz-Poisson cohomology group\nof a Poisson manifold is nontrivial, one can construct a symmetric bracket that\ngenerates irreversible dynamics compatible with energy conservation and entropy\nproduction. This bracket is derived from a 2-cocycle that deforms the original\nPoisson structure, thereby modifying the associated Casimir foliation. We\nillustrate the construction with two finite-dimensional examples, the duals of\nthe Lie algebras of the special Euclidean group SE(2) and the Galilei group\nSGal(3). These examples demonstrate the applicability of the method in\nclassical mechanics, control theory, and mathematical physics. Our framework\nnaturally extends to infinite-dimensional settings, which are discussed as\ndirections for future work.",

However, their practical implementation remains critically\nconstrained by a severe endurance bottleneck: under conditions where the\nremanent polarization (2Pr) reaches or exceeds 200 uC/cm^2, devices typically\nundergo catastrophic failure before reaching 10^8 cycles. Here, we report a\nvacancy-confining superlattice strategy that addresses this limitation,\nachieving reliable ferroelectric switching beyond 10^10 cycles while preserving\nsaturated polarization (2Pr >= 200 uC/cm^2). This is achieved by embedding\nperiodic ultrathin AlN layers within AlScN films, forming wurtzite AlScN/AlN\nsuperlattices, in conjunction with a dynamic recovery protocol that actively\nstabilizes the defect landscape throughout repeated cycling. Atomic-resolution\nimaging and EELS spectrum imaging technique, supported by first-principles\ncalculations, reveal a self-regulated defect topology in which nitrogen\nvacancies are spatially confined by heterostructure energy barriers and\ndynamically re-trapped into energetically favorable lattice sites. This dual\nspatial-energetic confinement mechanism effectively inhibits both long-range\npercolative migration and local defect clustering, enabling such an ultrahigh\nendurance exceeding 10^10 cycles and limiting polarization degradation to below\n3% after 10^9 cycles. These findings establish nitrogen vacancy topology\nstabilization as a foundational design principle for reliable operation of\nwurtzite ferroelectrics, providing a scalable and CMOS-compatible platform for\nfuture high-endurance ferroelectric memory technologies.",

The analysis shows that the cubic gradient term shifts\nvortex cores by an amount proportional to the in-plane exchange field and\nsimultaneously generates a lateral torque that can rotate entire vortex\nensembles, showing how spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and the exchange field enable\nbreakdown of the vortex--antivortex symmetry in a finite-size sample.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have significantly enhanced\nthe reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Group Relative\nPolicy Optimization (GRPO), an efficient variant of PPO that lowers RL's\ncomputational cost, still faces limited exploration, low sample efficiency and\ninstability, constraining its performance on complex reasoning tasks. To\naddress these limitations, we introduce EFRame, an Exploration-Filter-Replay\nframework that systematically augments GRPO along three critical dimensions.\nEFRame performs additional rollouts to explore high-quality trajectories,\napplies online filtering to eliminate low-quality samples that introduce noise\nand variance, and leverages experience replay to repeatedly exploit rare but\ninformative samples. EFRame establishes a complete and stable learning cycle,\nguiding the model through a structured transition from exploration to\nconvergence. Our experiments across a variety of reasoning benchmarks\ndemonstrate that EFRame not only improves the robustness and efficiency of\ntraining, but also enables access to deeper reasoning capabilities that remain\nunattainable under vanilla GRPO. Furthermore, EFRame not only enables\nfine-grained categorization of training samples for deeper insight into their\ncontributions, but also introduces an efficient and precise mechanism for\nentropy control, which is critical for balancing exploration and convergence in\nRL training.

As a result, only towards a specific moving direction\nand beyond a critical velocity, the acquired spin polarization can trigger\ncollective interactions sufficient for self-binding and drive a first-order\ntransition from gas to droplet.

In this paper, we\npropose a novel multi-view 2D/3D rigid registration approach comprising two\nstages.

In the second stage, test-time optimization is\nperformed to refine the estimated poses from the coarse stage. Our method\nexploits the mutual constraints of multi-view projection poses to enhance the\nrobustness of the registration process.

This paper reports outcomes from the Columbia Convening on AI Openness\nand Safety (San Francisco, 19 Nov 2024) and its six-week preparatory programme\ninvolving more than forty-five researchers, engineers, and policy leaders from\nacademia, industry, civil society, and government. Using a participatory,\nsolutions-oriented process, the working groups produced (i) a research agenda\nat the intersection of safety and open source AI; (ii) a mapping of existing\nand needed technical interventions and open source tools to safely and\nresponsibly deploy open foundation models across the AI development workflow;\nand (iii) a mapping of the content safety filter ecosystem with a proposed\nroadmap for future research and development. We find that openness --\nunderstood as transparent weights, interoperable tooling, and public governance\n-- can enhance safety by enabling independent scrutiny, decentralized\nmitigation, and culturally plural oversight. However, significant gaps persist:\nscarce multimodal and multilingual benchmarks, limited defenses against\nprompt-injection and compositional attacks in agentic systems, and insufficient\nparticipatory mechanisms for communities most affected by AI harms. The paper\nconcludes with a roadmap of five priority research directions, emphasizing\nparticipatory inputs, future-proof content filters, ecosystem-wide safety\ninfrastructure, rigorous agentic safeguards, and expanded harm taxonomies.\nThese recommendations informed the February 2025 French AI Action Summit and\nlay groundwork for an open, plural, and accountable AI safety discipline.",

To address these limitations, we propose a Frequency-Semantic\nEnhanced Variational Autoencoder (FS-VAE) to explore the skeleton semantic\nrepresentation learning with frequency decomposition. FS-VAE consists of three\nkey components: 1) a frequency-based enhancement module with high- and\nlow-frequency adjustments to enrich the skeletal semantics learning and improve\nthe robustness of zero-shot action recognition; 2) a semantic-based action\ndescription with multilevel alignment to capture both local details and global\ncorrespondence, effectively bridging the semantic gap and compensating for the\ninherent loss of information in skeleton sequences; 3) a calibrated\ncross-alignment loss that enables valid skeleton-text pairs to counterbalance\nambiguous ones, mitigating discrepancies and ambiguities in skeleton and text\nfeatures, thereby ensuring robust alignment.

Dynamic\nactivation of experts allows for conditional computation, increasing the number\nof parameters of neural networks, which is critical for absorbing the vast\namounts of knowledge available in many deep learning areas. However, despite\nthe existing system and algorithm optimizations, there are significant\nchallenges to be tackled when it comes to the inefficiencies of communication\nand memory consumption.\n  In this paper, we present the design and implementation of MPipeMoE, a\nhigh-performance library that accelerates MoE training with adaptive and\nmemory-efficient pipeline parallelism. Inspired by that the MoE training\nprocedure can be divided into multiple independent sub-stages, we design\nadaptive pipeline parallelism with an online algorithm to configure the\ngranularity of the pipelining. Further, we analyze the memory footprint\nbreakdown of MoE training and identify that activations and temporary buffers\nare the primary contributors to the overall memory footprint. Toward memory\nefficiency, we propose memory reusing strategies to reduce memory requirements\nby eliminating memory redundancies, and develop an adaptive selection component\nto determine the optimal strategy that considers both hardware capacities and\nmodel characteristics at runtime. We implement MPipeMoE upon PyTorch and\nevaluate it with common MoE models in a physical cluster consisting of 8 NVIDIA\nDGX A100 servers.

However, its application in surface path planning for mobile\nrobots remains largely unexplored. In this letter, a surface optimal path\nplanning algorithm called RM-Dijkstra is proposed, which is based on Riemannian\nmetric model. By constructing a new Riemannian metric on the 2D projection\nplane, the surface optimal path planning problem is therefore transformed into\na geometric problem on the 2D plane with new Riemannian metric.

However,\nthe dynamicity of tensor dimension sizes could potentially lead to these\noperators becoming memory-bound, necessitating the generation of fused kernels,\na task hindered by limited search spaces for fusion strategies, redundant\nmemory access, and prolonged tuning time, leading to sub-optimal performance\nand inefficient deployment.\n  We introduce MCFuser, a pioneering framework designed to overcome these\nobstacles by generating high-performance fused kernels for what we define as\nmemory-bound compute-intensive (MBCI) operator chains. Leveraging high-level\ntiling expressions to delineate a comprehensive search space, coupled with\nDirected Acyclic Graph (DAG) analysis to eliminate redundant memory accesses,\nMCFuser streamlines kernel optimization. By implementing guidelines to prune\nthe search space and incorporating an analytical performance model with a\nheuristic search, MCFuser not only significantly accelerates the tuning process\nbut also demonstrates superior performance. Benchmarked against leading\ncompilers like Ansor on NVIDIA A100 and RTX3080 GPUs, MCFuser achieves up to a\n5.9x speedup in kernel performance and outpaces other baselines while reducing\ntuning time by over 70-fold, showcasing its agility.",

    "abstract": "Quasi-low-dimensional band structures in bulk high-symmetry materials can\nexhibiting density of states (DOS) profiles akin to those of low-dimensional\nmaterials. A particular striking example is the full-Heusler compound\nNa$_2$TlSb, with valence band energy isosurfaces consisting of intersecting\n2D-dimensional pockets forming a box-like structure, with the sides\nindividually akin to the energy isosurfaces arising in one-dimensional (1D)\nquantum wells. The combination of high velocities and rapidly increasing DOS\nwith energy is extremely promising for thermoelectric applications. However,\nthese beneficial properties could in principle be counteracted by high\nelectronic scattering rates, and the benefits of for instance band convergence\nhas been questioned precisely because of increased scattering rates. It is\ntherefore critical to understand the electronic scattering nature of\nlow-dimensional systems. In the current study, describing electronic transport\nproperties of Na$_2$TlSb from first principles, we found that electronic\nscattering rates remained modest despite the high DOS. This was caused by the\nintricate interplay between several effects: (i) delocalized energetic\nisosurfaces giving rise to large momentum scattering paths with low\nwavefunction overlap, reducing the scattering probability; (ii) a high DOS\nresulting in a high free-carrier screening; (iii) a large portion of the\nscattering paths within the flat energy isosurfaces keeps the electron group\nvelocity nearly constant, reducing the effective relaxation rates. The high\nvelocity and modest relaxation time result in a high carrier mobility, which,\ntogether with the high DOS and beneficial DOS profile, results in excellent\nelectron transport properties. Combined with an ultra-low $\\kappa_\\ell$ of $<1$\nreported in literature, we predict a thermoelectric figure of merit ranging\nfrom 2.4 at 300 K to a maximum of 4.4 at 600 K.",

A new pair correlation function based on the BMCSL\nequation of state is employed to enhance modeling accuracy, though compliance\nwith Onsager relations remains to be explored.\n  Validation through various numerical simulations demonstrates the solver's\ncapability. Results from binary fluid relaxation simulations closely match\nmolecular dynamics (MD) data, highlighting accurate collision frequency\nmodeling. Comparative studies against state-of-the-art models verify the\nsolver's precision in predicting liquid-vapor equilibria and evaporation\ncoefficients across diverse pressure scenarios.\n  Detailed simulations of argon-neon mixtures with realistic particle diameters\nand masses underscore the significant improvements achieved by employing this\nmulti-species approach over traditional single-species methods. Comparisons\nwith the SAFT-VRQ Mie and classical density functional theory confirm the\nsolver's reliability in predicting liquid and vapor compositions and detailed\ndensity profiles at interfaces over a wide range of pressures and temperatures.\n  Further analyses illustrate complex dependencies of evaporation and\ncondensation coefficients on temperature and pressure, consistent with existing\nresearch findings.

Existing\nFSOD approaches, predominantly built on the Faster R-CNN detector, entangle\nobjectness recognition and foreground classification within shared feature\nspaces. This paradigm inherently establishes class-specific objectness criteria\nand suffers from unrepresentative novel class samples. To resolve this\nlimitation, we propose a Uniform Orthogonal Feature Space (UOFS) optimization\nframework. First, UOFS decouples the feature space into two orthogonal\ncomponents, where magnitude encodes objectness and angle encodes\nclassification. This decoupling enables transferring class-agnostic objectness\nknowledge from base classes to novel classes. Moreover, implementing the\ndisentanglement requires careful attention to two challenges: (1) Base set\nimages contain unlabeled foreground instances, causing confusion between\npotential novel class instances and backgrounds. (2) Angular optimization\ndepends exclusively on base class foreground instances, inducing overfitting of\nangular distributions to base classes. To address these challenges, we propose\na Hybrid Background Optimization (HBO) strategy: (1) Constructing a pure\nbackground base set by removing unlabeled instances in original images to\nprovide unbiased magnitude-based objectness supervision. (2) Incorporating\nunlabeled foreground instances in the original base set into angular\noptimization to enhance distribution uniformity. Additionally, we propose a\nSpatial-wise Attention Disentanglement and Association (SADA) module to address\ntask conflicts between class-agnostic and class-specific tasks.

The corresponding ab initio\nsimulations reveal a characteristic ``knee'' in the ionization yield at lower\nfield intensities than in comparable two-electron systems. To understand the\norigin of this shift, a quantitative semi-analytic model for double ionization\nof a three-electron atom has been created. In this model, ionization is treated\nas a combination of different scenarios and channels. Each channel is simulated\nwith either Quantitative Rescattering Theory (QRS) or two-electron ab initio\nmodel. Analysis of the semi-analytical results indicates that the shifted part\nof the ``knee'' is dominated by a recollision-excitation channel in which the\nrescattering electron initially escapes the parent atom from an inner orbital.\nThis counterintuitive phenomenon is then discussed and explained.",

    "abstract": "We revisit the local Hubble constant measurement from type Ia supernovae\ncalibrated with Cepheids (SH0ES) by remodelling the supernova data using two\nsupernova populations emerging from the observed bimodal distribution of the\nSALT2 stretch parameter. Our analysis accounts for population differences in\nboth intrinsic properties (related to possible initial conditions, including\nsupernova progenitor channels) and host-galaxy extinction (expected from\nwell-known environmental differences associated observationally with the two\npopulations). Based on a two-population Bayesian hierarchical modelling of the\nSALT2 light-curve parameters from the Pantheon+ compilation, we simultaneously\nconstrain intrinsic and extrinsic properties of both supernova populations,\nmatch probabilistically the calibration supernovae with the corresponding\npopulation in the Hubble flow, and derive the Hubble constant. The difference\nbetween the two supernova populations is primarily driven by their mean\nabsolute magnitudes and total-to-selective extinction coefficients. This is\nrelated but not equivalent to the traditional mass-step correction (including\nits broadening for reddened supernovae). The mean extinction coefficient of the\nsupernova population used to propagate distances from the calibration galaxies\nto the Hubble flow is found to be consistent with the Milky Way-like\ninterstellar dust model with R_B~4 and substantially higher than the extinction\nmodel assumed in the SH0ES measurement. Allowing for possible differences\nbetween reddening in the calibration galaxies and the corresponding population\nin the Hubble flow, we obtain H_0=70.59+/-1.15 km/s/Mpc. For the most\nconservative choice assuming equal prior distributions, we find\nH_0=71.45+/-1.03 km/s/Mpc. Our reanalysis of type Ia supernovae results in a\nreduction of the discrepancy with the Planck H_0 by at least 30 and up to 50\nper cent (3.5-2.2sigma).",

    "abstract": "The rise of imaging techniques such as optical coherence tomography (OCT) and\nadvances in deep learning (DL) have enabled clinicians and researchers to\nstreamline retinal disease staging. A popular DL approach is self-supervised\nlearning (SSL), where models learn from vast amounts of unlabeled data,\navoiding costly annotation. SSL has allowed the development of foundation\nmodels (FMs), large models that can be used for a variety of downstream tasks.\nHowever, existing FMs for OCT, trained solely on image data, lack a\ncomprehensive and robust semantic understanding of images, as evidenced by\ntheir downstream performance (especially for complex tasks), and thus require\nsupervised fine-tuning (which may be unfeasible) to better adapt to specific\napplications and populations. To address this, we propose RetFiner, an SSL\nvision-language refinement scheme that improves the representations of existing\nFMs and enables their efficient and direct adaptation to specific populations\nfor improved downstream performance. Our method uses a diverse set of training\nobjectives which take advantage of the rich supervisory signal found in textual\ndata. We tested RetFiner on the retinal FMs RETFound, UrFound, and VisionFM,\nshowing significant improvements in linear probing performance on seven highly\ndiverse OCT classification tasks, with an average increase of 5.8, 3.9, and 2.1\npercentage points over their baselines, respectively.

    "abstract": "JWST has revealed a large population of active galactic nuclei (AGN) in the\ndistant universe, which are challenging our understanding of early massive\nblack hole seeding and growth. We expand the exploration of this population to\nlower luminosities by stacking $\\sim 600$ NIRSpec grating spectra from the JWST\nAdvanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) at $3<z<7$, in bins of redshift,\n[OIII]5007 luminosity and equivalent width, UV luminosity and stellar mass. In\nvarious stacks, we detect a broad component of H$\\alpha$ without a counterpart\nin [OIII], implying that it is not due to outflows but is tracing the Broad\nLine Region (BLR) of a large population of low-luminosity AGN not detected in\nindividual spectra. We also consider the possible contribution from Supernovae\n(SNe) and Very Massive Stars and conclude that while this is very unlikely, we\ncannot exclude some potential contribution by SNe to some of the stacks. The\ndetection, in some stacks, of high [OIII]4363/H$\\gamma$, typical of AGN,\nfurther confirms that such stacks reveal a large population of AGN. We infer\nthat the stacks probe black holes with masses of a few times $10^6~M_\\odot$\naccreting at rates $L/L_{Edd}\\sim 0.02-0.1$, i.e. a low mass and dormant\nparameter space poorly explored by previous studies on individual targets. We\nidentify populations of black holes that fall within the scatter of the local\n$M_{BH}-M_{*}$ scaling relation, indicating that there is a population of\nhigh-z BHs that are not overmassive relative to their host galaxies and which\nhave been mostly missed in previous JWST observations. Yet, on average, the\nstacks are still overmassive relative the local relation, with some of them 1-2\ndex above it. We infer that the BH mass function (BHMF) at $3<z<5$ rises\nsteeply at low masses.

    "abstract": "Despite progress in Vision-Language Models (VLMs), their capacity for visual\nreasoning is often limited by the binding problem: the failure to reliably\nassociate perceptual features with their correct visual referents. This\nlimitation underlies persistent errors in tasks such as counting, visual\nsearch, scene description, and spatial relationship understanding. A key factor\nis that current VLMs process visual features largely in parallel, lacking\nmechanisms for spatially grounded, serial attention. This paper introduces\nVISER (Visual Input Structure for Enhanced Reasoning), a simple yet effective\nintervention: augmenting visual inputs with low-level spatial structures and\npairing this with a textual prompt that encourages sequential, spatially-aware\nparsing. We empirically demonstrate substantial performance improvements across\ncore visual reasoning tasks. Specifically, VISER improves GPT-4o visual search\naccuracy by 25.00%, increases counting accuracy by 26.83%, reduces edit\ndistance error in scene description by 0.32, and enhances performance on\nspatial relationship tasks by 9.50% on a 2D synthetic dataset. Furthermore, we\nfind that the visual modification is essential for these gains; purely textual\nstrategies, including Chain-of-Thought prompting, are insufficient and can even\ndegrade performance. VISER enhances binding only with a single-query inference,\nunderscoring the importance of visual input design over purely\nlinguistically-based approaches. These findings suggest that low-level visual\nstructuring is a powerful and underexplored direction for improving\ncompositional visual reasoning and could serve as a general strategy for\nenhancing VLM performance on spatially grounded tasks.",

To\noperationalise this, we observe a DDS as a molecular concentration-based\nchannel. Semantic information is defined as the amount of information required\nfor a DDS to achieve its therapeutic goal in a dynamic environment. We derive\nit by introducing interventions, defined as modifications to DDS parameters, a\nviability function, and system-environment correlations quantified via the\nchannel capacity. Here, the viability function represents DDS performance based\non a drug dose-response relationship.

By analysing the MC-based DDS model through a semantic\ninformation perspective, we examine how correlations between the internalised\nparticle concentration $(Y)$ and the particle concentration in the\nextracellular environment $(X)$ evolve under interventions. The final catalogue\nof results provides a quantitative basis for DDS design and optimisation,\noffering a method to determine optimal DDS parameter values under constraints\nsuch as chemical budget, desired effect and accuracy.

However, how these networks evolve\nacross different age groups and how this evolution relates to properties like\ndisease prevalence and mortality remains understudied. To address these issues,\nwe used publicly available comorbidity networks extracted from a comprehensive\ndataset of 45 million Austrian hospital stays from 1997 to 2014, covering 8.9\nmillion patients. These networks grow and become denser with age. We identified\ngroups of diseases that exhibit similar patterns of structural centrality\nthroughout the lifespan, revealing three dominant age-related components with\npeaks in early childhood, midlife, and late life. To uncover the drivers of\nthis structural change, we examined the relationship between prevalence and\ndegree. This allowed us to identify conditions that were disproportionately\nconnected to other diseases. Using betweenness centrality in combination with\nmortality data, we further identified high-mortality bridging diseases. Several\ndiseases show high connectivity relative to their prevalence, such as iron\ndeficiency anemia (D50) in children, nicotine dependence (F17), and lipoprotein\nmetabolism disorders (E78) in adults. We also highlight structurally central\ndiseases with high mortality that emerge at different life stages, including\ncancers (C group), liver cirrhosis (K74), subarachnoid hemorrhage (I60), and\nchronic kidney disease (N18).

We analyze 20-second cadence TESS\nlight curves from sectors 27 to 80 to detect stellar flares and QPPs. Methods.\nStellar flare detection was carried out using an automated detection routine\nbased on autoregressive integrated moving average models.

The detected periods of the QPPs were in the range\nof 42 to 193 seconds. In the diagram showing QPP periods against the flare\nduration a branch emerges. It shows a positive correlation with the flare\nduration, meaning longer duration flares host longer period QPPs. Conclusion.\nOur study detected short-period and sub-minute QPPs in stellar flares that have\nrarely been explored in other works. We find similar scaling laws between solar\nand stellar QPPs which indicates that QPPs in stellar flares might be analogous\nto the ones in solar flares as both show evidence of scaling with flare\nduration.",

Here we present a\ntwo-dimensional (2D) EO-steered OPA based on a non-uniformly spaced X-cut\nthin-film LN ridge-waveguide array. A superlattice ridge design suppresses\noptical crosstalk to -20 dB, enabling low-sidelobe far-field radiation. Using\nparticle swarm optimization (PSO) method, we transform a uniformly spaced array\ninto an optimized non-uniform design, largely improving angular resolution\nwhile maintaining sidelobe suppression. When combined with a single-radiating\ntrapezoidal end-fire emitter incorporating an etched grating, the device\nproduces a main-lobe beam width of 0.99 degree*0.63 degree from an aperture of\nonly 140 um*250 um, achieving a wide 2D steering range of 47 degree*9.36 degree\nwith a 20 dB sidelobe-suppression ratio.

We propose a novel hybrid approach to reconstruct hazard-induced\ndisplacements by analysing the statistical properties of a diffusion process\n(walks) that explores the spatial network constructed from real displacements.\nThe likely trajectories produced by the walks inform the typical journey of\nindividuals, identifying potential hazards that may be encountered when fleeing\nhigh-risk areas.

We also find that the probability of\nconflict and drought across all trajectories is widely dispersed, meaning that\nthere is no typical exposure.

In each case, the\n$SL(2,\\mathbb{Z})$ modular symmetries of the known generating function of the\nexact microstate degeneracies enables the latter to be expressed as a\nRademacher series expansion, with each summand consisting of phases and a\nmodified Bessel function of the first kind. We make a motivated ansatz that the\nde Alfaro-Fubini-Furlan model (DFF) coupled to a simple harmonic oscillator is\na universal sector of the holographic CQM dual to the BPS black hole's\nnear-horizon $AdS_2$ geometry, and demonstrate how in both cases, the two\nparameters of this putative CQM, the DFF coupling as well as the oscillator\nfrequency, exactly encode both the index and the argument of the Bessel\nfunction. Consequently, we extract the leading, logarithmic and all sub-leading\npower law black hole entropy contributions from calculations in the CQM. In the\n${\\cal N}=4$ case, the DFF ansatz is sufficient to successfully reproduce the\nexact microscopic generating function from the CQM.",

    "abstract": "In this study we investigate how hierarchical structures within the Roman\nCatholic Church shape the ideological orientation of its leadership. The full\nepiscopal genealogy dataset comprises over 35,000 bishops, each typically\nconsecrated by one principal consecrator and two co-consecrators, forming a\ndense and historically continuous directed network of episcopal lineage. Within\nthis broader structure, we focus on a dataset of 245 living cardinals to\nexamine whether genealogical proximity correlates with doctrinal alignment on a\nbroad set of theological and sociopolitical issues. We identify motifs that\ncapture recurring patterns of lineage, such as shared consecrators or\nco-consecrators. In parallel, we apply natural language processing techniques\nto extract each cardinal's publicly stated positions on ten salient topics,\nincluding LGBTQIA+ rights, women's roles in the Church, liturgy, bioethics,\npriestly celibacy, and migration. Our results show that cardinals linked by\nspecific genealogical motifs, particularly those who share the same principal\nconsecrator, are significantly more likely to exhibit ideological similarity.\nWe find that the influence of pope John Paul II persists through the bishops he\nconsecrated, who demonstrate systematically more conservative views than their\npeers. These findings underscore the role of hierarchical mentorship in shaping\nideological coherence within large-scale religious institutions. Our\ncontribution offers quantitative evidence that institutional lineages, beyond\nindividual background factors, may have an impact on the transmission and\nconsolidation of doctrinal positions over time.",

Choosing $\\mathcal{C}$ to be the\n$(2,1)$-category of linear categories, this recovers a definition of modular\nfunctors, and choosing it to be the derived category of a ring yields a notion\nclosely related to cohomological field theories. We will introduce a notion of\nmodular $\\infty$-operads and algebras over them, construct the modular\n$\\infty$-operad of surfaces $\\mathcal{M}$, and show that algebras over\n$\\mathcal{M}$ in $\\mathcal{C}$ are exactly $2$D TFTs valued in $\\mathcal{C}$.\nAlong the way we will encounter variants modular $\\infty$-operads (such as\ncyclic $\\infty$-operads and $\\infty$-properads) as well as a proof of the $1$D\ncobordism hypothesis with singularities.

To address these shortcomings, we propose the Tied Prototype Model\n(TPM), a principled reformulation of ADNet with tied prototype locations for\nforeground and background distributions. Building on its probabilistic\nfoundation, TPM naturally extends to multiple prototypes and multi-class\nsegmentation while effectively separating non-typical background features.\nNotably, both extensions lead to improved segmentation accuracy. Finally, we\nleverage naturally occurring class priors to define an ideal target for\nadaptive thresholds, boosting segmentation performance.

    "abstract": "We address the challenge of certifying quantum behavior with single\nmacroscopic massive particles, subject to decoherence and finite data. We\npropose a hypothesis testing framework that distinguishes between classical and\nquantum mechanics based on position measurements. While interference pattern\nvisibility in single-particle quantum superposition experiments has been\ncommonly used as a sufficient criterion to falsify classical mechanics, we show\nthat, from a hypothesis testing perspective, it is neither necessary nor\nefficient. Focusing on recent proposals to prepare macroscopic superposition\nstates of levitated nanoparticles, we show that the likelihood ratio test --\nwhich leverages differences across the entire probability distribution --\nprovides an exponential reduction in measurements needed to reach a given\nconfidence level. These results offer a principled, efficient method to falsify\nclassical mechanics in interference experiments, relaxing the experimental\nconstraints faced by current efforts to test quantum mechanics at the\nmacroscopic scale.",

    "abstract": "We consider the problem of a game theorist analyzing a game that uses\ncryptographic protocols. Ideally, a theorist abstracts protocols as ideal,\nimplementation-independent primitives, letting conclusions in the \"ideal world\"\ncarry over to the \"real world.\" This is crucial, since the game theorist\ncannot--and should not be expected to--handle full cryptographic complexity. In\ntoday's landscape, the rise of distributed ledgers makes a shared language\nbetween cryptography and game theory increasingly necessary.\n  The security of cryptographic protocols hinges on two types of assumptions:\nstate-of-the-world (e.g., \"factoring is hard\") and behavioral (e.g., \"honest\nmajority\"). We observe that for protocols relying on behavioral assumptions\n(e.g., ledgers), our goal is unattainable in full generality. For\nstate-of-the-world assumptions, we show that standard solution concepts, e.g.,\n($\\epsilon$-)Nash equilibria, are not robust to transfer from the ideal to the\nreal world.\n  We propose a new solution concept: the pseudo-Nash equilibrium. Informally, a\nprofile $s=(s_1,\\dots,s_n)$ is a pseudo-Nash equilibrium if, for any player $i$\nand deviation $s'_i$ with higher expected utility, $i$'s utility from $s_i$ is\n(computationally) indistinguishable from that of $s'_i$. Pseudo-Nash is simpler\nand more accessible to game theorists than prior notions addressing the\nmismatch between (asymptotic) cryptography and game theory. We prove that Nash\nequilibria in games with ideal, unbreakable cryptography correspond to\npseudo-Nash equilibria when ideal cryptography is instantiated with real\nprotocols (under state-of-the-world assumptions). Our translation is\nconceptually simpler and more general: it avoids tuning or restricting utility\nfunctions in the ideal game to fit quirks of cryptographic implementations.\nThus, pseudo-Nash lets us study game-theoretic and cryptographic aspects\nseparately and seamlessly.",

We develop a\ndeep learning pipeline to detect LSNe using multi-band, multi-epoch image\ncutouts. Our model is based on a 2D convolutional long short-term memory\n(ConvLSTM2D) architecture, designed to capture both spatial and temporal\ncorrelations in time-series imaging data.

Negative examples include variable sources from HSC Transient Survey\n(including unclassified transients), and simulated unlensed SNe Ia in LRG and\nspiral galaxies. Our multi-band model shows rapid classification improvements\nduring the initial few observations and quickly reaches high detection\nefficiency: at a fixed false-positive rate (FPR) of $0.01\\%$, the true-positive\nrate (TPR) reaches $\\gtrsim 60\\%$ by the 7th observation and exceeds $\\gtrsim\n70\\%$ by the 9th.

    "abstract": "Reasoning is a hallmark of human intelligence, enabling adaptive\ndecision-making in complex and unfamiliar scenarios. In contrast, machine\nintelligence remains bound to training data, lacking the ability to dynamically\nrefine solutions at inference time. While some recent advances have explored\nreasoning in machines, these efforts are largely limited to verbal domains such\nas mathematical problem-solving, where explicit rules govern step-by-step\nreasoning. Other critical real-world tasks - including visual perception,\nspatial reasoning, and radiological diagnosis - require non-verbal reasoning,\nwhich remains an open challenge. Here we present a novel learning paradigm that\nenables machine reasoning in vision by allowing performance improvement with\nincreasing thinking time (inference-time compute), even under conditions where\nlabelled data is very limited. Inspired by dual-process theories of human\ncognition in psychology, our approach integrates a fast-thinking System I\nmodule for familiar tasks, with a slow-thinking System II module that\niteratively refines solutions using self-play reinforcement learning. This\nparadigm mimics human reasoning by proposing, competing over, and refining\nsolutions in data-scarce scenarios. We demonstrate superior performance through\nextended thinking time, compared not only to large-scale supervised learning\nbut also foundation models and even human experts, in real-world vision tasks.\nThese tasks include computer-vision benchmarks and cancer localisation on\nmedical images across five organs, showcasing transformative potential for\nnon-verbal machine reasoning.",

Similarities and differences in the morphological and the\nkinematical properties of the UDGs with their possible precursors, namely\nlow-surface brightness (LSBs), L*-type high-surface brightness (HSBs) and dwarf\ngalaxies, may provide crucial constraints on their origin and evolution. We\nselected samples of UDGs, LSBs, HSBs and dwarfs from TNG50-1. We first obtained\na few possible scaling relations involving some mass properties to analyse if\nthe regression fits for UDGs are in compliance with those of the other samples.\nThen, we studied individual galaxy cutouts to evaluate the intrinsic shapes of\ntheir dark-matter (DM) and stellar components, orbital and kinematical\nproperties related to their stellar velocity dispersion. Finally, we\nconstructed the mock IFU data using the SimSpin code to extract the stellar\nkinematic moment maps. We observe that the UDGs and the dwarf galaxies have\nnearly similar regression fits in a. stellar-to-gas mass ratio vs gas mass, b.\nstellar-to-gas mass ratio vs total dynamical mass, c. stellar central surface\ndensity vs ratio of stellar-to-total dynamical mass, and d. total baryonic mass\nvs total dynamical mass parameter spaces. Next, we find that the isolated UDGs\nare prolate rotators similar to the dwarf population, while the tidally-bound\nUDGs can exhibit both prolate and oblate-rotating shapes. The DM and stellar\nvelocity anisotropy properties of the UDGs suggest that they reside in a cored,\ndwarf-like halo and may be classified by early-type galaxies. Finally, the\nstellar kinematic properties suggest that both the UDGs and the dwarfs are\nslow-rotators having low to nearly no-rotations in contrast to the late-type,\ndisc-dominated, fast-rotating LSBs and HSBs. Therefore, we may conclude that\nthe UDGs and the dwarfs possibly have a common dynamical lineage.",

    "abstract": "With the deep penetration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the\ntransportation sector, intelligent cockpits, autonomous driving, and\nintelligent road networks are developing at an unprecedented pace. However, the\ndata ecosystems of these three key areas are increasingly fragmented and\nincompatible. Especially, existing testing methods rely on data stacking, fail\nto cover all edge cases, and lack flexibility. To address this issue, this\npaper introduces the concept of \"Query as Test\" (QaT). This concept shifts the\nfocus from rigid, prescripted test cases to flexible, on-demand logical queries\nagainst a unified data representation. Specifically, we identify the need for a\nfundamental improvement in data storage and representation, leading to our\nproposal of \"Extensible Scenarios Notations\" (ESN). ESN is a novel declarative\ndata framework based on Answer Set Programming (ASP), which uniformly\nrepresents heterogeneous multimodal data from the cockpit, vehicle, and road as\na collection of logical facts and rules. This approach not only achieves deep\nsemantic fusion of data, but also brings three core advantages: (1) supports\ncomplex and flexible semantic querying through logical reasoning; (2) provides\nnatural interpretability for decision-making processes; (3) allows for\non-demand data abstraction through logical rules, enabling fine-grained privacy\nprotection. We further elaborate on the QaT paradigm, transforming the\nfunctional validation and safety compliance checks of autonomous driving\nsystems into logical queries against the ESN database, significantly enhancing\nthe expressiveness and formal rigor of the testing. Finally, we introduce the\nconcept of \"Validation-Driven Development\" (VDD), which suggests to guide\ndevelopments by logical validation rather than quantitative testing in the era\nof Large Language Models, in order to accelerating the iteration and\ndevelopment process.",

While the bayron\nacoustic oscillation (BAO) imprint allows the determination of $(D_A(z),\nH(z))$, redshift space anisotropy (RSD) allows the measurement of a quantity\n$f_8(z) = f(z) \\sigma_{8,0} D_{+}(z)$. To extract $f(z)$ from $f_8(z)$, one\nusually requires some other data set. We show that precise BAO and RSD\nmeasurements in and around some key redshifts themselves can solely reconstruct\n$f(z)$ without requiring any other data sets. Secondly, we extend this approach\nto another tracer, namely the post-reionization 21-cm brightness temperature\nintensity maps. We demonstrate that the measured $f(z)$ from purely redshift\nspace clustering allows us to measure the 21-cm bias, which is a largely\nunknown quantity.

Two unfriendly species that\nanti-align or even interact non-reciprocally show more complex collective\nphenomena, ranging from parallel and anti-parallel flocking over runand chase\nbehavior to chiral phases. Whether flocking or any of these collective\nphenomena can survive in the presence of a large number of species with random\nnon-reciprocal interactions remained elusive so far. As a first step here the\nextreme case of a Vicsek-like model with fully random nonreciprocal\ninteractions between the individual particles is considered. As soon as the\nalignment bias is of the same order as the random interactions the ordered\nflocking phase occurs, but deep within this phase, the random non-reciprocal\ninteractions can still support global chiral and oscillating states in which\nthe collective movement direction rotates or oscillates slowly. For short-range\ninteractions, moreover, even without alignment bias self-organized cliques\nemerge, in which medium size clusters of particles that have predominantly\naligning interactions meet accidentally and stay together for macroscopic\ntimes. These results may serve as a starting point for the study of\nmulti-species flocking models with non-random but complex non-reciprocal\ninter-species interactions.",

    "abstract": "The application of symbol-level precoding (SLP) in reconfigurable intelligent\nsurfaces (RIS) enhanced multi-user multiple-input single-output (MU-MISO)\nsystems faces two main challenges. First, the state-of-the-art joint reflecting\nand SLP optimization approach requires exhaustive enumeration of all possible\ntransmit symbol combinations, resulting in scalability issues as the modulation\norder and number of users increase. Second, conventional quadrature amplitude\nmodulation (QAM) exhibits strict constructive interference (CI) regions,\nlimiting its effectiveness for CI exploitation in SLP. To address these\nchallenges, this paper proposes a novel modulation scheme, termed\nhybrid-constellation modulation (HCM), which has a structure of superposed QAM\nand ASK sub-constellations (SCs). HCM extends the CI regions compared to QAM.\nAdditionally, a two-stage reflecting and SLP optimization method is developed\nto support HCM. The proposed methods are designed for practical RIS with\ndiscrete phase shifts and has good scalability. Simulation results show that\nHCM achieves up to 1.5 dB and 1 dB SER gains over QAM with modulation order 16\nand 64, respectively.",

However, the\nincreasing number of devices communicating on the same channels will lead to\nsignificant channel load. To address this issue this study evaluates the\neffectiveness of Redundancy Mitigation (RM) for VRU Awareness Messages (VAM),\nfocusing specifically on cyclists. The objective of RM is to minimize the\ntransmission of redundant information. We conducted a simulation study using a\nurban scenario with a high bicycle density based on traffic data from Hannover,\nGermany. This study assessed the impact of RM on channel load, measured by\nChannel Busy Ratio (CBR), and safety, measured by VRU Perception Rate (VPR) in\nsimulation. To evaluate the accuracy and reliability of the RM mechanisms, we\nanalyzed the actual differences in position, speed, and heading between the ego\nVRU and the VRU, which was assumed to be redundant. Our findings indicate that\nwhile RM can reduce channel congestion, it also leads to a decrease in VPR. The\nanalysis of actual differences revealed that the RM mechanism standardized by\nETSI often uses outdated information, leading to significant discrepancies in\nposition, speed, and heading, which could result in dangerous situations. To\naddress these limitations, we propose an adapted RM mechanism that improves the\nbalance between reducing channel load and maintaining VRU awareness. The\nadapted approach shows a significant reduction in maximum CBR and a less\nsignificant decrease in VPR compared to the standardized RM. Moreover, it\ndemonstrates better performance in the actual differences in position, speed,\nand heading, thereby enhancing overall safety.

The RBDM significantly outperforms the existing slow-vehicle\napproximation in SUMO, aligning more closely with real-world data. These\nresults underscore the necessity of a realistic bicycle movement model for\naccurate simulations, given the significant differences in the movement\nprofiles of bicycles, cars, and pedestrians. Furthermore, the model is tested\nfor its ability to generalize to disparate scenarios and urban topologies,\nwhich is dependent on the manner and geographical region in which the SimRa\ndata were gathered. In addition, recommendations are provided for how it could\nbe adapted for use in different city topologies.",

    "abstract": "Millimeter galaxy surveys are particularly effective in detecting dusty\nstar-forming galaxies at high redshift. While such observations are typically\nconducted at ~1mm, studies suggest that 2mm may be better suited for selecting\nsources at even higher redshifts. We use the unprecedented 2mm data from the\nN2CLS, together with the SIDES simulation, to study and interpret the\nstatistical properties of 2mm-selected galaxies. We use the N2CLS robust sample\nat 2mm, which contains 25 sources in the deep GOODS-N field and 90 sources in\nthe wide COSMOS. The sources are matched with the N2CLS 1.2mm sources, the\nancillary 850um sources, and redshift catalogs to study the colors and redshift\ndistributions. We also produce end-to-end simulations based on SIDES and the\nobserved N2CLS detector timelines to interpret the data. We find a mean S2/S1.2\ncolor of 0.215$\\pm$0.006 with a standard deviation of 0.056$\\pm$0.004. We\nmeasure a mean redshift of $3.6\\pm0.3$ in GOODS-N, which is marginally higher\nthan expectations from SIDES ($3.0\\pm0.2$) because of an overdensity at\n$z\\sim5.2$, and $3.0\\pm0.2$ in COSMOS, which agrees with the $3.2\\pm0.2$\npredicted by SIDES. We also show that the observed S2/S1.2 colors exhibit a\nweak dependence with redshift but a large dispersion, which limits its\nefficiency to select high-z sources. Finally, we studied the nine 2mm sources\nnot detected at 1.2mm, and found that two of them are radiogalaxies, one is a\nz~2 galaxy, and the remaining six are compatible with the expected number of\nspurious detections. The N2CLS survey shows no evidence for any exotic 2mm-only\ngalaxy population. Using SIDES, we show that 2mm samples have a higher mean\nredshift compared to 1.2mm because they miss z~2 dusty galaxies. Finally, we\ncompare the N2CLS with the ex-MORA survey and show that N2CLS is more efficient\nthan interferometric observations to build samples of high-z dusty galaxies.",

Previous studies generally assumed\na fixed precession period when analysing the temporal profiles in GRBs;\nhowever, the dynamic evolution of the fallback process and accretion disk can\nsignificantly affect the precession behaviour. In this work we present a jet\nprecession model that incorporates the co-evolution of fallback accretion and\nthe central black hole (BH). Our model demonstrates that the jet precession\nperiod initially decreases rapidly during the early fallback phase and\nsubsequently increases nearly linearly as the disk evolves. We find that a\nhigher accretion disk viscosity and a slower BH spin lead to longer precession\nperiods and faster precession period growth rates, and that the geometric\nstructure of the precession system modulates the pulse amplitude of the light\ncurve. By fitting the model to observational data of GRBs with multi-pulse\nstructures, we show that jet precession can naturally explain the increasing\npulse intervals and broadened pulse widths observed in both long and short\nGRBs.",

While multimodal MRI\noffers complementary contrasts for detecting and contextualizing WM lesions,\nexisting approaches often lack flexibility in handling missing modalities and\nfail to integrate anatomical localization efficiently. We propose a deep\nlearning framework for WM lesion segmentation and localization that operates\ndirectly in native space using single- and multi-modal MRI inputs. Our study\nevaluates four input configurations: FLAIR-only, T1-only, concatenated FLAIR\nand T1, and a modality-interchangeable setup. It further introduces a\nmulti-task model for jointly predicting lesion and anatomical region masks to\nestimate region-wise lesion burden. Experiments conducted on the MICCAI WMH\nSegmentation Challenge dataset demonstrate that multimodal input significantly\nimproves the segmentation performance, outperforming unimodal models. While the\nmodality-interchangeable setting trades accuracy for robustness, it enables\ninference in cases with missing modalities. Joint lesion-region segmentation\nusing multi-task learning was less effective than separate models, suggesting\nrepresentational conflict between tasks. Our findings highlight the utility of\nmultimodal fusion for accurate and robust WMH analysis, and the potential of\njoint modeling for integrated predictions.",

    "abstract": "As inference workloads for large language models (LLMs) scale to meet growing\nuser demand, pipeline parallelism (PP) has become a widely adopted strategy for\nmulti-GPU deployment, particularly in cross-node setups, to improve key-value\n(KV) cache capacity and inference throughput. However, PP suffers from inherent\ninefficiencies caused by three types of execution bubbles-load-imbalance,\nintra-stage, and inter-stage-which limit pipeline saturation. We present\nSiPipe, a heterogeneous pipeline design that improves throughput by leveraging\nunderutilized CPU resources to offload auxiliary computation and communication.\nSiPipe incorporates three key techniques-CPU sampling, a token-safe execution\nmodel, and structure-aware transmission-to mitigate pipeline bubbles and\nimprove execution efficiency. Across diverse LLMs, SiPipe achieves up to 2.1\ntimes higher throughput, 43% lower per-token latency, and up to 23% higher\naverage GPU utilization compared to the state-of-the-art vLLM under the same PP\nconfiguration, demonstrating its generality across LLMs and deployment\nscenarios.",

    "abstract": "Zero-shot Semantic Segmentation (ZSS) aims to segment both seen and unseen\nclasses using supervision from only seen classes. Beyond adaptation-based\nmethods, distillation-based approaches transfer vision-language alignment of\nvision-language model, e.g., CLIP, to segmentation models. However, such\nknowledge transfer remains challenging due to: (1) the difficulty of aligning\nvision-based features with the textual space, which requires combining spatial\nprecision with vision-language alignment; and (2) the semantic gap between\nCLIP's global representations and the local, fine-grained features of\nsegmentation models. To address challenge (1), we propose Chimera-Seg, which\nintegrates a segmentation backbone as the body and a CLIP-based semantic head\nas the head, like the Chimera in Greek mythology, combining spatial precision\nwith vision-language alignment. Specifically, Chimera-Seg comprises a trainable\nsegmentation model and a CLIP Semantic Head (CSH), which maps dense features\ninto the CLIP-aligned space. The CSH incorporates a frozen subnetwork and fixed\nprojection layers from the CLIP visual encoder, along with lightweight\ntrainable components. The partial module from CLIP visual encoder, paired with\nthe segmentation model, retains segmentation capability while easing the\nmapping to CLIP's semantic space. To address challenge (2), we propose\nSelective Global Distillation (SGD), which distills knowledge from dense\nfeatures exhibiting high similarity to the CLIP CLS token, while gradually\nreducing the number of features used for alignment as training progresses.\nBesides, we also use a Semantic Alignment Module (SAM) to further align dense\nvisual features with semantic embeddings extracted from the frozen CLIP text\nencoder.

    "abstract": "Modern industry is increasingly moving away from mass manufacturing, towards\nmore specialized and personalized products. As manufacturing tasks become more\ncomplex, full automation is not always an option, human involvement may be\nrequired. This has increased the need for advanced human robot collaboration\n(HRC), and with it, improved methods for interaction, such as voice control.\nRecent advances in natural language processing, driven by artificial\nintelligence (AI), have the potential to answer this demand. Large language\nmodels (LLMs) have rapidly developed very impressive general reasoning\ncapabilities, and many methods of applying this to robotics have been proposed,\nincluding through the use of code generation. This paper presents Language\nModel Program Voice Control (LMPVC), an LLM-based prototype voice control\narchitecture with integrated policy programming and teaching capabilities,\nbuilt for use with Robot Operating System 2 (ROS2) compatible robots. The\narchitecture builds on prior works using code generation for voice control by\nimplementing an additional programming and teaching system, the Policy Bank.

Continuous maritime\nship tracking is crucial for applications such as maritime search and rescue,\nlaw enforcement, and shipping analysis.

The former offer\nlow resolution and are susceptible to weather conditions, while the latter have\nshort filming durations and limited coverage areas, making them less suitable\nfor the real-world requirements of ship tracking. To address these limitations,\nwe present the Hybrid Optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Ship\nRe-Identification Dataset (HOSS ReID dataset), designed to evaluate the\neffectiveness of ship tracking using low-Earth orbit constellations of optical\nand SAR sensors. This approach ensures shorter re-imaging cycles and enables\nall-weather tracking.

However, conventional AR speech synthesis models relying on the\nnext-token prediction paradigm often encounter significant challenges when\nhandling long speech sequences. These models often struggle to construct stable\nframe-to-frame attention, leading to increased latency and degraded synthesis\nquality, thereby limiting their feasibility for real-time applications. To\naddress these limitations, we introduce a novel dynamic chunk-wise\nautoregressive synthesis framework, termed DCAR, designed to enhance both\nefficiency and intelligibility robustness in AR speech generation. DCAR\nintroduces a chunk-to-frame attention mechanism through training with\nmulti-token prediction, enabling dynamic chunk prediction in variable speech\ncontexts using a lightweight module trained on-policy. DCAR dynamically adjusts\nthe token prediction span, significantly reducing the sequence length\ndependency while obtaining high synthesis quality. Comprehensive empirical\nevaluations demonstrate that DCAR substantially outperforms traditional\nnext-token prediction models, achieving up to 72.27% intelligibility\nimprovement and 2.61x inference speedup simultaneously on the test set.\nFurthermore, we conduct comprehensive analysis to support it as a versatile\nfoundation for next-generation speech synthesis systems.",

    "abstract": "High-resolution processing of seismic signals is crucial for subsurface\ngeological characterization and thin-layer reservoir identification.\nTraditional high-resolution algorithms can partially recover high-frequency\ninformation but often lack robustness, computational efficiency, and\nconsideration of inter-trace structural relationships. Many deep learning\nmethods use end-to-end architectures that do not incorporate prior knowledge or\naddress data domain disparities, leading to limited generalization.To overcome\nthese challenges, this paper presents the Domain-Adaptive Knowledge\nDistillation Network (DAKD-Net), which integrates a knowledge distillation\nstrategy with a domain adaptation mechanism for high-resolution seismic data\nprocessing. Trained on datasets from forward modeling, DAKD-Net establishes\nphysical relationships between low and high-resolution data, extracting\nhigh-frequency prior knowledge during a guided phase before detail restoration\nwithout prior conditions. Domain adaptation enhances the model's generalization\nto real seismic data, improving both generalization capability and structural\nexpression accuracy.DAKD-Net employs a U-Net backbone to extract spatial\nstructural information from multi-trace seismic profiles. The knowledge\ndistillation mechanism enables prior knowledge transfer, allowing recovery of\nhigh-resolution data directly from low-resolution inputs. Domain-adaptive\nfine-tuning further enhances the network's performance in actual survey areas.\nExperimental results show that DAKD-Net outperforms traditional methods and\nclassical deep networks in longitudinal resolution and complex structural\ndetail restoration, demonstrating strong robustness and practicality.",

    "abstract": "Unlike many physical nonequilibrium systems, in biological systems, the\ncoupling to external energy sources is not a fixed parameter but adaptively\ncontrolled by the system itself. We do not have theoretical frameworks that\nallow for such adaptability. As a result, we cannot understand emergent\nbehavior in living systems where structure formation and non-equilibrium drive\ncoevolve. Here, using ecosystems as a model of adaptive systems, we develop a\nframework of living circuits whose architecture changes adaptively with the\nenergy dissipated in each circuit edge. We find that unlike traditional\nnonequilibrium systems, living circuits exhibit a phase transition from\nequilibrium death to a nonequilibrium dissipative state beyond a critical\ndriving potential. This transition emerges through a feedback mechanism that\nsaves the weakest edges by routing dissipation through them, even though the\nadaptive rule locally rewards the strongest dissipating edges. Despite lacking\nany global optimization principle, living circuits achieve near-maximal\ndissipation, with higher drive promoting more complex circuits. Our work\nestablishes ecosystems as paradigmatic examples of living circuits whose\nstructure and dissipation are tuned through local adaptive rules.",

Previous efforts heavily rely on paired data to improve\nthe generalization performance and robustness through collecting either diverse\nCT data for re-training or a few test data for fine-tuning. Recently, diffusion\nmodels have shown promising and generalizable performance in low-dose CT (LDCT)\nreconstruction, however, they may produce unrealistic structures due to the CT\nimage noise deviating from Gaussian distribution and imprecise prior\ninformation from the guidance of noisy LDCT images. In this paper, we propose a\nnoise-inspired diffusion model for generalizable LDCT reconstruction, termed\nNEED, which tailors diffusion models for noise characteristics of each domain.\nFirst, we propose a novel shifted Poisson diffusion model to denoise projection\ndata, which aligns the diffusion process with the noise model in pre-log LDCT\nprojections. Second, we devise a doubly guided diffusion model to refine\nreconstructed images, which leverages LDCT images and initial reconstructions\nto more accurately locate prior information and enhance reconstruction\nfidelity. By cascading these two diffusion models for dual-domain\nreconstruction, our NEED requires only normal-dose data for training and can be\neffectively extended to various unseen dose levels during testing via a time\nstep matching strategy. Extensive qualitative, quantitative, and\nsegmentation-based evaluations on two datasets demonstrate that our NEED\nconsistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in reconstruction and\ngeneralization performance.

We focus on mutation distributions for\nunbounded integer decision variables. We briefly discuss a couple of candidate\ndiscrete probabilities induced by the uniform and binomial distributions, which\nwe show to possess less appealing theoretical properties, and then narrow down\nto the Truncated Normal (TN) and Double Geometric (DG) distributions. We\nexplore their theoretical properties, including entropy functions, and propose\na procedure to generate scalable correlated mutation distributions. Our\ninvestigations are accompanied by extensive numerical simulations, which\nconsistently support the claim that the DG distribution is better suited for\nunbounded integer search.

    "abstract": "Inference tasks with time series over graphs are of importance in\napplications such as urban water networks, economics, and networked\nneuroscience. Addressing these tasks typically relies on identifying a\ncomputationally affordable model that jointly captures the graph-temporal\npatterns of the data. In this work, we propose a graph-aware state space model\nfor graph time series, where both the latent state and the observation equation\nare parametric graph-induced models with a limited number of parameters that\nneed to be learned. More specifically, we consider the state equation to follow\na stochastic partial differential equation driven by noise over the graphs\nedges accounting not only for potential edge uncertainties but also for\nincreasing the degrees of freedom in the latter in a tractable manner. The\ngraph structure conditioning of the noise dispersion allows the state variable\nto deviate from the stochastic process in certain neighborhoods. The\nobservation model is a sampled and graph-filtered version of the state\ncapturing multi-hop neighboring influence. The goal is to learn the parameters\nin both state and observation models from the partially observed data for\ndownstream tasks such as prediction and imputation. The model is inferred first\nthrough a maximum likelihood approach that provides theoretical tractability\nbut is limited in expressivity and scalability. To improve on the latter, we\nuse the state-space formulation to build a principled deep learning\narchitecture that jointly learns the parameters and tracks the state in an\nend-to-end manner in the spirit of Kalman neural networks.",

    "abstract": "Deterministic game-solving algorithms are conventionally analyzed in the\nlight of their average-case complexity against a distribution of random\ngame-trees, where leaf values are independently sampled from a fixed\ndistribution. This simplified model enables uncluttered mathematical analysis,\nrevealing two key properties: root value distributions asymptotically collapse\nto a single fixed value for finite-valued trees, and all reasonable algorithms\nachieve global optimality. However, these findings are artifacts of the model's\ndesign-its long criticized independence assumption strips games of structural\ncomplexity, producing trivial instances where no algorithm faces meaningful\nchallenges. To address this limitation, we introduce a new probabilistic model\nthat incrementally constructs game-trees using a fixed level-wise conditional\ndistribution. By enforcing ancestor dependency, a critical structural feature\nof real-world games, our framework generates problems with adjustable\ndifficulty while retaining some form of analytical tractability. For several\nalgorithms, including AlphaBeta and Scout, we derive recursive formulas\ncharacterizing their average-case complexities under this model. These allow us\nto rigorously compare algorithms on deep game-trees, where Monte-Carlo\nsimulations are no longer feasible. While asymptotically, all algorithms seem\nto converge to identical branching factor (a result analogous to those of\nindependence-based models), deep finite trees reveal stark differences:\nAlphaBeta incurs a significantly larger constant multiplicative factor compared\nto algorithms like Scout, leading to a substantial practical slowdown. Our\nframework sheds new light on classical game-solving algorithms, offering\nrigorous evidence and analytical tools to advance the understanding of these\nmethods under a more realistic, challenging, and yet tractable model.",

There are two primary approaches to distributing these\nstages between the client and the server that impose different constraints on\ncryptographic techniques and experimental implementations. In the\nprepare-and-send setting, the client prepares the qubits and sends them to the\nserver, while in the receive-and-measure setting, the client receives the\nqubits from the server and measures them. Although these settings have been\nextensively studied independently, their interrelation and whether\nsetting-dependent theoretical constraints are inevitable remain unclear.

Non-Abelian systems characterized by noncommutative braid patterns are\nassociated with intriguing physical features and applications. Non-Abelian\nbraiding of the non-Hermitian bands and anomalous skin mode localization may\nemerge due to a host of competing physical effects. The quest for the\ngenerality of their physical origin and the associated new phenomena,\ntherefore, constitutes a pertinent question to consider. Here, we consider a\nsynthetic gauge photonic lattice with competing sources of non-Hermiticity,\ni.e. NN and NNN hopping mismatches, non-Abelian SU(2) phases, and gain/loss\nprocesses. Formation of the distinctive braid patterns and nested Hopf-links is\nobserved, which is followed by a non-Hermitian topological phase transition at\nEP and the opening of an imaginary gap beyond. The PBC and OBC eigenspectra and\nconcomitant localization dynamics of the OBC eigenstates show rich physical\nfeatures that are unattainable in their less complex counterparts. This\nincludes the formation of the conjoint open-arcs in the OBC spectra which give\nrise to a completely localized purely dipole skin effect without any extended\nmodes.

Substrates provide solid support, but metallenes'\nwanted properties can only be retained in weak physisorption. Here, we study\nthe 45 physisorbed, atomically thin metallene structures in flat and buckled\nlattices using a sequential multi-scale model based on density-functional\ntheory calculations. The lattices are mostly buckled but flat for a handful of\nelements such as Na, K, Rb, Ag, Au, and Cd, depending on physisorption\nstrength. Moreover, under certain conditions, the structure can be controlled\nby applying biaxial tensile stress parallel or an electric field normal to the\nsurface. The stress reduces the threshold of adhesion strength required to\nflatten a buckled lattice, and the electric field can be used to increase that\nthreshold controllably. Our results help provide fundamental information about\nthe structures of physisorbed metallenes and suggest means to control them at\nwill by suitable substrate choice or tuning of experimental parameters.",

    "abstract": "The advancement of Pre-Trained Language Models (PTLMs) and Large Language\nModels (LLMs) has led to their widespread adoption across diverse applications.\nDespite their success, these models remain vulnerable to attacks that exploit\ntheir inherent weaknesses to bypass safety measures. Two primary\ninference-phase threats are token-level and prompt-level jailbreaks.\nToken-level attacks embed adversarial sequences that transfer well to black-box\nmodels like GPT but leave detectable patterns and rely on gradient-based token\noptimization, whereas prompt-level attacks use semantically structured inputs\nto elicit harmful responses yet depend on iterative feedback that can be\nunreliable. To address the complementary limitations of these methods, we\npropose two hybrid approaches that integrate token- and prompt-level techniques\nto enhance jailbreak effectiveness across diverse PTLMs. GCG + PAIR and the\nnewly explored GCG + WordGame hybrids were evaluated across multiple Vicuna and\nLlama models. GCG + PAIR consistently raised attack-success rates over its\nconstituent techniques on undefended models; for instance, on Llama-3, its\nAttack Success Rate (ASR) reached 91.6%, a substantial increase from PAIR's\n58.4% baseline. Meanwhile, GCG + WordGame matched the raw performance of\nWordGame maintaining a high ASR of over 80% even under stricter evaluators like\nMistral-Sorry-Bench. Crucially, both hybrids retained transferability and\nreliably pierced advanced defenses such as Gradient Cuff and JBShield, which\nfully blocked single-mode attacks. These findings expose previously unreported\nvulnerabilities in current safety stacks, highlight trade-offs between raw\nsuccess and defensive robustness, and underscore the need for holistic\nsafeguards against adaptive adversaries.",

The PLRs for EW-type and RR Lyrae stars are in good agreement\nwith previous studies, while the PLR zero point for DSCT stars appears\nsystematically fainter by approximately 0.15--0.30 mag. Our PLRs exhibit low\ndispersion and are minimally affected by crowding. We analyzed the capability\nof JWST archival data to detect low-amplitude variables and found that only\nstars with amplitudes greater than approximately 0.05 mag can be reliably\ndetected. Through simulations, we quantified how increasing the number of\nphotometric epochs improves the detectability of low-amplitude, low\nsignal-to-noise ratio variables. Despite current limitations in observational\ncadence, JWST demonstrates unique advantages in detecting short-period\neclipsing binaries, rotational variables, and high-amplitude pulsators.

First, we propose a hybrid multi-IRS architecture,\nwhich consists of several passive IRSs and one semi-passive IRS equipped with\nboth active sensors and reflecting elements. To be specific, the active sensors\nare exploited to receive the echo signals for estimating the target's angle\ninformation, and the multiple reflecting paths provided by multi-IRS are\nemployed to improve the degree of freedoms (DoFs) of communication. Under the\ngiven budget on the number of total IRSs elements, we theoretically show that\nincreasing the number of deployed IRSs is beneficial for improving DoFs of\nspatial multiplexing for communication while increasing the Cramer-Rao bound\n(CRB) of target estimation, which unveils a fundamental tradeoff between the\nsensing and communication performance. To characterize the rate-CRB tradeoff,\nwe study a rate maximization problem, by optimizing the BS transmit covariance\nmatrix, IRSs phase-shifts, and the number of deployed IRSs, subject to a\nmaximum CRB constraint. Analytical results reveal that the\ncommunication-oriented design becomes optimal when the total number of IRSs\nelements exceeds a certain threshold, wherein the relationships of the rate and\nCRB with the number of IRS elements/sensors, transmit power, and the number of\ndeployed IRSs are theoretically derived and demystified. Simulation results\nvalidate our theoretical findings and also demonstrate the superiority of our\nproposed designs over the benchmark schemes.",

Previous work on redundancy\nelimination of array computations in loop nests lacks universality. These\napproaches either focus on specific computation patterns or fail to recognize\nredundancies with complex structures. This paper proposes RACE (Redundant Array\nComputation Elimination), a more general redundancy elimination technique. RACE\nutilizes a novel two-level scheme to identify the data reuse between array\nreferences and the computation redundancies between expressions. It traverses\nthe expression trees in loop nests to detect redundancies hierarchically in\nlinear time and generates efficient code with optimized auxiliary arrays that\nstore redundant computation results. Furthermore, RACE supports the expression\nreassociation with various aggressive strategies to improve the redundancy\nopportunities. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of RACE.",

To improve the automation of these bidding\nsystems, we adopt generative models, namely the Decision Transformer (DT), to\ntackle the difficulties inherent in automated bidding. Applying the Decision\nTransformer to the auto-bidding task enables a unified approach to sequential\nmodeling, which efficiently overcomes short-sightedness by capturing long-term\ndependencies between past bidding actions and user behavior. Nevertheless,\nconventional DT has certain drawbacks: (1) DT necessitates a preset\nreturn-to-go (RTG) value before generating actions, which is not inherently\nproduced; (2) The policy learned by DT is restricted by its training data,\nwhich is consists of mixed-quality trajectories. To address these challenges,\nwe introduce the R* Decision Transformer (R* DT), developed in a three-step\nprocess: (1) R DT: Similar to traditional DT, R DT stores actions based on\nstate and RTG value, as well as memorizing the RTG for a given state using the\ntraining set; (2) R^ DT: We forecast the highest value (within the training\nset) of RTG for a given state, deriving a suboptimal policy based on the\ncurrent state and the forecasted supreme RTG value; (3) R* DT: Based on R^ DT,\nwe generate trajectories and select those with high rewards (using a simulator)\nto augment our training dataset. This data enhancement has been shown to\nimprove the RTG of trajectories in the training data and gradually leads the\nsuboptimal policy towards optimality. Comprehensive tests on a publicly\navailable bidding dataset validate the R* DT's efficacy and highlight its\nsuperiority when dealing with mixed-quality trajectories.",

Previous studies have\ndeveloped multiple parameterizations (e.g. ``bumpy\" spacetime) to characterize\nsuch deviations in extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRI) and employed analyses\nbased on the Fisher information matrix (FIM) formalism to quantify the\nconstraining power of space-borne GW detectors like LISA and Tianqin, e.g.,\nachieving a constraint sensitivity levels of $10^{-4} \\sim 10^{-2}$ on the\ndimensionless bumpy parameter $\\delta \\tilde{Q}$ under varying source\nconfigurations in analytical kluge waveform for LISA. In this paper, we advance\nprior analyses by integrating particle swarm optimization (PSO) with matched\nfiltering under a restricted parameter search range to enforce a high\nprobability of convergence for PSO. Our results reveal a significant number of\ndegenerate peaks in the likelihood function over the signal parameter space\nwith values that exceed the injected one. This extreme level of degeneracy\narises from the involvement of the additional bumpy parameter $\\delta\n\\tilde{Q}$ in the parameter space and introduces systematic errors in parameter\nestimation. We show that these systematic errors can be mitigated using\ninformation contained in the ensemble of degenerate peaks, thereby restoring\nthe reliability of astrophysical inferences about EMRI systems from GW\nobservations.

Unlike conventional\ndistillation methods that require separate teacher and student models, the\nproposed framework utilizes a smoothed, historical version of the model itself\nas the teacher, significantly reducing training computational overhead while\nmaintaining performance benefits. To support this research, we developed a\ncomprehensive accelerometer-based dataset capturing 12 distinct sleep postures\nacross three different wearing positions, complementing two existing public\ndatasets (MHealth and WISDM). Experimental results show that Smooth-Distill\nconsistently outperforms alternative approaches across different evaluation\nscenarios, achieving notable improvements in both human activity recognition\nand device placement detection tasks. This method demonstrates enhanced\nstability in convergence patterns during training and exhibits reduced\noverfitting compared to traditional multitask learning baselines. This\nframework contributes to the practical implementation of knowledge distillation\nin human activity recognition systems, offering an effective solution for\nmultitask learning with accelerometer data that balances accuracy and training\nefficiency.

    "abstract": "We propose UPOQA, a derivative-free optimization algorithm for partially\nseparable unconstrained problems, leveraging quadratic interpolation and a\nstructured trust-region framework. By decomposing the objective into element\nfunctions, UPOQA constructs underdetermined element models and solves\nsubproblems efficiently via a modified projected gradient method. Innovations\ninclude an approximate projection operator for structured trust regions,\nimproved management of elemental radii and models, a starting point search\nmechanism, and support for hybrid black-white-box optimization, etc. Numerical\nexperiments on 85 CUTEst problems demonstrate that \\texttt{UPOQA} can\nsignificantly reduce the number of function evaluations. To quantify the impact\nof exploiting partial separability, we introduce the speed-up profile to\nfurther evaluate the acceleration effect. Results show that the speed-up of\nUPOQA over baselines is less significant in low-precision scenarios but becomes\nmore pronounced in high-precision scenarios. Applications to quantum\nvariational problems further validate its practical utility.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we investigate the CFT phase transitions of various AdS black\nhole solutions, including the Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om-AdS (RN-AdS) black hole, the\nModMax-AdS black hole, and the RN-AdS black hole formulated within the\nframework of Kaniadakis statistics, through the lens of the AdS/CFT\ncorrespondence. Employing the generalized Ehrenfest classification scheme based\non fractional-order derivatives, we analyze the nature of phase transitions at\nboth Davies points and critical points. Davies points, defined as the loci of\ndivergent heat capacity, are typically associated with second-order transitions\nin the classical Ehrenfest paradigm. However, a refined analysis reveals that\nthese points can be categorized into two distinct types: the first corresponds\nto extrema in the temperature profile, while the second aligns with its\ninflection point, i.e., the thermodynamic critical point. Our findings\ndemonstrate that the order of the phase transition is sensitive to this\nclassification, with the first type corresponding to a fractional order of\n$3/2$, and the second to $4/3$, which is consistent across RN-AdS black holes.\nNotably, when a specific constraint is imposed, we observe a $3/2$-order phase\ntransition for both the RN-AdS and ModMax-AdS black holes, whereas in the case\nof the RN-AdS black hole with Kaniadakis statistics, two critical points arise\nunder constrained paths, each exhibiting a transition of order $4/3$. This\ngeneralized, fractional-order framework enables a more precise and\ndiscriminating characterization of CFT phase transitions in holographic\nsettings, revealing distinctions that remain hidden under traditional\nclassifications. The results provide deeper insight into the rich structure of\nblack hole thermodynamics on the CFT side and highlight the significance of\nfractional calculus as a powerful tool for probing critical phenomena within\nthe AdS/CFT framework.",

Currently, massive fine-resolution remotely sensed\n(FRRS) images acquired by improving sensing and imaging technologies become\navailable. However, accurate semantic segmentation of such FRRS images is\ngreatly affected by substantial class disparities, the invisibility of key\nground objects due to occlusion, and object size variation. Despite the\nextraordinary potential in deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) in image\nfeature learning and representation, extracting sufficient features from FRRS\nimages for accurate semantic segmentation is still challenging. These\nchallenges demand the deep learning models to learn robust features and\ngenerate sufficient feature descriptors. Specifically, learning\nmulti-contextual features to guarantee adequate coverage of varied object sizes\nfrom the ground scene and harnessing global-local contexts to overcome class\ndisparities challenge even profound networks. Deeper networks significantly\nlose spatial details due to gradual downsampling processes resulting in poor\nsegmentation results and coarse boundaries. This article presents a stacked\ndeep residual network (SDRNet) for semantic segmentation from FRRS images. The\nproposed framework utilizes two stacked encoder-decoder networks to harness\nlong-range semantics yet preserve spatial information and dilated residual\nblocks (DRB) between each encoder and decoder network to capture sufficient\nglobal dependencies thus improving segmentation performance. Our experimental\nresults obtained using the ISPRS Vaihingen and Potsdam datasets demonstrate\nthat the SDRNet performs effectively and competitively against current DCNNs in\nsemantic segmentation.",

In this process, MutS homologs (MSH)\nplay crucial roles in identifying mismatched basepairs and recruiting\ndownstream MMR proteins. The MSH protein exhibits distinct functions and\ndiffusion dynamics before and after the recognition of mismatches while\ntraversing along DNA. An ADP-bound MSH, known as the MSH searching clamp, scans\nDNA sequences via rotational diffusion along the DNA backbone. Upon recognizing\na mismatch, the MSH combines with ATP molecules, forming a stable sliding\nclamp. Recent experimental evidence challenges the conventional view that the\nsliding clamp performs a simple Brownian motion. In this study, we explore the\ndiffusion dynamics of the ATP-bound MSH sliding clamp through single-particle\ntracking experiments and introduce a Bayesian single-trajectory modeling\nframework to analyze its motion. Our quantitative analysis reveals that the\ndiffusion characteristics defy explanation by a single-state diffusion\nmechanism. Instead, our in-depth model inference uncovers three distinct\ndiffusion states, each characterized by specific diffusion coefficients. These\nstates alternate over time, with cross-state transitions predominantly\ninvolving one intermediate state, and direct transitions between the slowest\nand the fastest states being scarce.

Our theoretical\nanalysis identifies the logarithmic condition number of the Fubini Study metric\nas a critical geometric quantity governing trainability, optimization dynamics,\nand generalization. Sculpture uses a classical meta model trained to generate\ndata dependent quantum circuit initializations that minimize the logarithmic\ncondition number, thereby promoting an isotropic and well conditioned parameter\nspace.\n  Empirical results show that meta training reduces the logarithmic condition\nnumber from approximately 1.47 to 0.64 by significantly increasing the minimum\neigenvalue and slightly decreasing the maximum eigenvalue of the metric,\neffectively alleviating barren plateaus. This improved conditioning generalizes\nwell to unseen data, consistently producing well conditioned quantum circuit\ninitializations.

The system is systematically modeled from\nthe perspectives of communication channels, computational costs, and constraint\nconditions, and the joint optimization problem of offloading decisions and\nresource allocation is uniformly abstracted into a graph-structured modeling\ntask. On this basis, we propose a graph attention diffusion-based solution\ngenerator (GADSG). This method integrates the contextual awareness of graph\nattention networks with the solution distribution learning capability of\ndiffusion models, enabling joint modeling and optimization of discrete\noffloading variables and continuous resource allocation variables within a\nhigh-dimensional latent space. We construct multiple simulation datasets with\nvarying scales and topologies. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the\nproposed GADSG model significantly outperforms existing baseline methods in\nterms of optimization performance, robustness, and generalization across task\nstructures, showing strong potential for efficient task scheduling in dynamic\nand complex low-altitude economic network environments.",

    "abstract": "Parallel multigrid is widely used as preconditioners in solving large-scale\nsparse linear systems. However, the current multigrid library still needs more\nsatisfactory performance for structured grid problems regarding speed and\nscalability. Based on the classical 'multigrid seesaw', we derive three\nnecessary principles for an efficient structured multigrid, which instructs our\ndesign and implementation of StructMG, a fast and scalable algebraic multigrid\nthat constructs hierarchical grids automatically. As a preconditioner, StructMG\ncan achieve both low cost per iteration and good convergence when solving\nlarge-scale linear systems with iterative methods in parallel. A stencil-based\ntriple-matrix product via symbolic derivation and code generation is proposed\nfor multi-dimensional Galerkin coarsening to reduce grid complexity, operator\ncomplexity, and implementation effort. A unified parallel framework of sparse\ntriangular solver is presented to achieve fast convergence and high parallel\nefficiency for smoothers, including dependence-preserving Gauss-Seidel and\nincomplete LU methods. Idealized and real-world problems from radiation\nhydrodynamics, petroleum reservoir simulation, numerical weather prediction,\nand solid mechanics, are evaluated on ARM and X86 platforms to show StructMG's\neffectiveness. In comparison to \\textit{hypre}'s structured and general\nmultigrid preconditioners, StructMG achieves the fastest time-to-solutions in\nall cases with average speedups of 15.5x, 5.5x, 6.7x, 7.3x over SMG, PFMG,\nSysPFMG, and BoomerAMG, respectively.

We evaluate\nARAG accross three datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that ARAG\nsignificantly outperforms standard RAG and recency-based baselines, achieving\nup to 42.1% improvement in NDCG@5 and 35.5% in Hit@5.

    "abstract": "During its earth-bound phase of the Aditya-L1 spacecraft of India, the\nSupra-Thermal and Energetic Particle Spectrometer (STEPS) of the Aditya Solar\nwind Particle EXperiment (ASPEX) was operated whenever the orbit was above\n52000 km during 11 - 19 September 2023. This phase of operation provided\nmeasurements of energetic ions (with energies 0.1--2 MeV) in the magnetosphere,\nmagnetosheath, and interplanetary medium. Three interplanetary coronal mass\nejections (ICME) hit the magnetosphere during this period. This provided\nopportunity to examine the relative roles of ICME-generated solar energetic\nparticles (SEPs) and substorm generated energetic ions on the magnetosphere. We\napproach this objective by detailed spectral analyses of energetic ion fluxes\nmeasured by two units of ASPEX-STEPS. We identify three distinctly different\nconditions of the north-south component of the interplanetary magnetic field\n(IMF $B_z$ = 0, $>$ 0, and $<$ 0) and use the derived spectral indices to\nunderstand this relative role. By combining these with the simultaneous\nenergetic ion flux variations from the Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE)\naround the Sun-Earth first Lagrangian (L1) point and the Geostationary\nOperational Environmental Satellite (GOES) in the Earth's magnetosphere, we\nshow that the polarity of IMF $B_z$ influences the energetic ion spectra in the\nmagnetosphere by modulating the interplay of the ICME-generated SEP with the\nenergetic particles generated inside the magnetosphere by substorms.\nInterestingly, ASPEX-STEPS observations also indicate towards directional\nanisotropy based on spectral indices. This suggests spatially inhomogeneous\nmixing of energetic ions coming from different source processes.",

The model-free approach learns from breather simulations with five\nunstable modes. A properly tuned parallel Echo State Network can predict\ndynamics from two distinct testing datasets. The first set is a continuation of\nthe training data, whereas the second set involves a higher-order breather. An\ninvestigation of the one-step prediction capability shows remarkable agreement\nbetween the testing data and the models. Furthermore, we show that the trained\nreservoir can predict the propagation of rogue waves over a relatively long\nprediction horizon, despite facing unseen dynamics. Finally, we introduce a\nmethod to significantly improve the Reservoir Computing prediction in\nautonomous mode, enhancing its long-term forecasting ability.

Our approach enhances local to global feature modeling while\nfocusing on key areas during learning. Bayesian inference selects high quality\npseudo labels for stability. Experiments show strong performance on FGVC\nbenchmarks with occlusions, demonstrating robustness when labeled data is\nlimited. Code is available at https://github.com/wxqnl/RAUM Net.",

    "abstract": "Video is transforming education with online courses and recorded lectures\nsupplementing and replacing classroom teaching. Recent research has focused on\nenhancing information retrieval for video lectures with advanced navigation,\nsearchability, summarization, as well as question answering chatbots. Visual\nelements like tables, charts, and illustrations are central to comprehension,\nretention, and data presentation in lecture videos, yet their full potential\nfor improving access to video content remains underutilized. A major factor is\nthat accurate automatic detection of visual elements in a lecture video is\nchallenging; reasons include i) most visual elements, such as charts, graphs,\ntables, and illustrations, are artificially created and lack any standard\nstructure, and ii) coherent visual objects may lack clear boundaries and may be\ncomposed of connected text and visual components. Despite advancements in deep\nlearning based object detection, current models do not yield satisfactory\nperformance due to the unique nature of visual content in lectures and scarcity\nof annotated datasets. This paper reports on a transfer learning approach for\ndetecting visual elements in lecture video frames. A suite of state of the art\nobject detection models were evaluated for their performance on lecture video\ndatasets. YOLO emerged as the most promising model for this task. Subsequently\nYOLO was optimized for lecture video object detection with training on multiple\nbenchmark datasets and deploying a semi-supervised auto labeling strategy.\nResults evaluate the success of this approach, also in developing a general\nsolution to the problem of object detection in lecture videos.

Augmented reality (AR) has the potential\nto increase efficiency in endoscopic surgical training, but additional research\nis critical to understanding the needs of surgical trainees to inform the\ndesign of AR training systems. Therefore, we worked with 18 surgical trainees\nto understand the strengths, limitations, and unmet needs of their current\ntraining environment and to co-design an AR eye-gaze tracking system based on\ntheir preferences.

In particular, probabilistic forecasting, which\nmodels demand as a stochastic process, is capable of capturing uncertainty. An\nexample of such modeling is the use of L\\'evy processes, which possess\nindependent increments and accommodate discontinuous changes (jumps). However,\nto the best of our knowledge, in inventory control using L\\'evy processes, no\nstudies have investigated how the order quantity and reorder point affect the\ntotal cost. One major difficulty has been the mathematical formulation of\ninventory replenishment triggered at reorder points. To address this challenge,\nthe present study formulates a reorder-point policy by modeling cumulative\ndemand as a drifted Poisson process and introducing a stopping time to\nrepresent the timing at which the reorder point is reached. Furthermore, the\nvalidity of the proposed method is verified by comparing the total cost with\nthat obtained from a case where an ARIMA model is combined with a reorder-point\npolicy. As a main result, while the total cost under ARIMA-based forecasting\nincreases linearly over time, the L\\'evy process-based formulation provides an\nanalytical expression for the total cost, revealing that random demand\nfluctuations cause the expected total cost to grow at a rate faster than\nlinear.",

However, this problem\nremains under-explored in existing research. Inspired by success in the image\ndomain, we propose to exploit advances in 3D vision-language models (3D VLMs)\nfor OOD detection in point cloud objects. However, a major challenge is that\npoint cloud datasets used to pre-train 3D VLMs are drastically smaller in size\nand object diversity than their image-based counterparts. Critically, they\noften contain exclusively computer-designed synthetic objects. This leads to a\nsubstantial domain shift when the model is transferred to practical tasks\ninvolving real objects scanned from the physical environment. In this paper,\nour empirical experiments show that synthetic-to-real domain shift\nsignificantly degrades the alignment of point cloud with their associated text\nembeddings in the 3D VLM latent space, hindering downstream performance. To\naddress this, we propose a novel methodology called SODA which improves the\ndetection of OOD point clouds through a neighborhood-based score propagation\nscheme. SODA is inference-based, requires no additional model training, and\nachieves state-of-the-art performance over existing approaches across datasets\nand problem settings.",

A functional analysis attempt to solve this type of boundary\ncondition is not straight forward since results about existence and uniqueness\nof solution are still limited. Hence, a semi analytical method is described\nhere to approach a solution. A perturbation solution around the monopole\nconverts the nonlinear oblique problem into a series of known Neumann problems\nin the exterior of the sphere. The corresponding Green's function\nrepresentation for the exterior Neumann problem gives an exact analytic\nsolution for each perturbation step as an integral on the surface of the\nsphere. Nevertheless, the boundary conditions become very complicated and\nrequire to be approximated numerically. The perturbation solutions given by\nintegrals of the Green's function on the sphere are computed at each\nperturbation step using different subdivisions of the surface integrals with\nthe help of adaptive quadrature method. We call icosahedron method to the\nintegration on the sphere with an icosahedron mesh using Gauss 5-point or\nadaptive quadrature, according to the integration parameter. This method was\nvery effective to deal with the singularity of the Green's function\nsuccessfully avoiding inaccuracies on the numerical approximation and is an\nimportant contribution of this work. The numerical perturbation scheme is\nperformed for two given exact solutions. The icosahedron method is found to be\nvery precise.

    "abstract": "High-stakes decision-making involves navigating multiple competing objectives\nwith expensive evaluations. For instance, in brachytherapy, clinicians must\nbalance maximizing tumor coverage (e.g., an aspirational target or soft bound\nof >95% coverage) against strict organ dose limits (e.g., a non-negotiable hard\nbound of <601 cGy to the bladder), with each plan evaluation being\nresource-intensive. Selecting Pareto-optimal solutions that match implicit\npreferences is challenging, as exhaustive Pareto frontier exploration is\ncomputationally and cognitively prohibitive, necessitating interactive\nframeworks to guide users. While decision-makers (DMs) often possess domain\nknowledge to narrow the search via such soft-hard bounds, current methods often\nlack systematic approaches to iteratively refine these multi-faceted preference\nstructures. Critically, DMs must trust their final decision, confident they\nhaven't missed superior alternatives; this trust is paramount in\nhigh-consequence scenarios.

This is guided\nby an active sampling strategy optimizing exploration-exploitation while\nminimizing cognitive burden.

We demonstrate\nActive-MoSH's performance benefits through diverse synthetic and real-world\napplications.

The central research question is whether\ntISCS can achieve targeted activation of spinal cord circuits while reducing\nunwanted stimulation of skin and muscle tissues, which are common limitations\nof conventional transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation (tSCS). Methods: A\nfinite element model of the lower thorax was developed to simulate electric\nfield distributions for various skin electrode montages. To address the\ncomputational bottleneck associated with high-resolution modeling and montage\noptimization, we implemented a leadfield-based Pareto optimization strategy to\nidentify the electrode configuration that maximizes the electric field in the\nspinal cord and minimizes it in off-target tissues. tISCS montages were\ncompared with tSCS montages in terms of focality and stimulation efficiency.\nResults: Optimized tISCS configurations significantly reduced electric field\nintensity in the skin by over 20-fold compared to tSCS. The ratio of spinal\ncord to skin electric fields increased by at least 10-fold, indicating enhanced\nfocality. The injection current efficiency in tISCS can be leveraged to\nincrease spinal cord electric fields by at least 5-fold while keeping skin\nexposure below the levels observed with tSCS. Conclusion: tISCS enables deeper\nand more selective spinal cord stimulation compared to tSCS, with substantially\nreduced off-target effects. This is the first computational demonstration of\ntISCS feasibility. Leadfield-guided Pareto optimization enables efficient\nmontage selection, providing a foundation for future experimental applications.",

It is proved that the lowest\ndiscriminant ideal of $(H,C,\\text{tr})$ is of level\n$\\text{FPdim}(\\text{Gr}(H/\\mathfrak{m}_{\\overline{\\varepsilon}}H))+1$, where\n$\\text{Gr}(H/\\mathfrak{m}_{\\overline{\\varepsilon}}H)$ is the Grothendieck ring\nof the finite-dimensional Hopf algebra\n$H/\\mathfrak{m}_{\\overline{\\varepsilon}}H$ and\n$\\text{FPdim}(\\text{Gr}(H/\\mathfrak{m}_{\\overline{\\varepsilon}}H))$ is the\nFrobenius-Perron dimension of\n$\\text{Gr}(H/\\mathfrak{m}_{\\overline{\\varepsilon}}H)$. Some recent results of\nMi-Wu-Yakimov about lowest discriminant ideals are generalized. Secondly, we\nprove that all the discriminant ideals are trivial if $H$ has the Chevalley\nproperty.",

In this\npaper, guided by the general equation for nonequilibrium\nreversible-irreversible coupling (GENERIC) framework, a novel GENERIC-guided\nactive learning smoothed particle hydrodynamics (${\\rm{G^2ALSPH}}$) method is\nproposed to obtain effective constitutive relations for reliable simulations of\nviscoelastic flows. By utilizing the GENERIC framework, the target viscoelastic\nconstitutive relation is reduced to a simple functional relation between the\neigenvalues of the conformation tensor and the eigenvalues of its\nthermodynamically conjugated tensorial variable, which incorporates the\nflow-history-dependent memory effect. Based on data and Gaussian process\nregression (GPR), a new active learning strategy is developed to obtain the\nsimplified constitutive relation, in which the generalization ability is\nensured by actively acquiring more data points when needed. Moreover, a novel\nrelative uncertainty is devised to establish an accuracy evaluation tool for\nthe GPR prediction results, which reduces the number of required training data\npoints while maintaining accuracy. Furthermore, the SPH method combined with\nthe latest techniques serves as an effective macroscopic numerical method.\nEventually, the Poiseuille flows and the flows around a periodic array of\ncylinders at different Weissenberg numbers are simulated to validate the\neffectiveness and accuracy of the ${\\rm{G^2ALSPH}}$ method. The Oldroyd-B model\nis used as the ground truth constitutive relation to provide data for GPR,\nbringing analytical solutions for comparison. The excellent performance\ndemonstrates that the ${\\rm{G^2ALSPH}}$ method has promising applications in\ndata-driven simulations of viscoelastic fluids.",

This part of the training pipeline is critical\nfor supplying the models with large volumes of high-quality image-caption pairs\nduring training. However, recent work suggests that VLMs are vulnerable to\nstealthy adversarial attacks, where adversarial perturbations are added to\nimages to mislead the VLMs into producing incorrect captions.\n  In this paper, we explore the feasibility of adversarial mislabeling attacks\non VLMs as a mechanism to poisoning training pipelines for text-to-image\nmodels. Our experiments demonstrate that VLMs are highly vulnerable to\nadversarial perturbations, allowing attackers to produce benign-looking images\nthat are consistently miscaptioned by the VLM models. This has the effect of\ninjecting strong \"dirty-label\" poison samples into the training pipeline for\ntext-to-image models, successfully altering their behavior with a small number\nof poisoned samples. We find that while potential defenses can be effective,\nthey can be targeted and circumvented by adaptive attackers.

However, we observe that\npruning significantly weakens the model's grounding ability, leading to\nincorrect predictions and drastic performance degradation. In Referring\nExpression Comprehension (REC), for instance, pruning causes the accuracy of\nLLaVA on the RefCOCO validation set to drop from 56.14% to 15.34%. Our analysis\nidentifies misaligned position IDs after pruning as the primary cause of this\ndegradation, as both the order and value of these IDs are crucial for\nmaintaining performance in grounding tasks. To address this issue, we propose\nGrounding-Aware Token Pruning (GAP), a simple yet effective adjustment to\nposition IDs that recovers REC accuracy back to 51.42%, which is 90% of the\noriginal performance in the without pruning setting, all while requiring no\nadditional training, memory, or computational overhead.

    "abstract": "Native multimodal large language models (MLLMs) restructure a single large\nlanguage model (LLM) into a spoken language model (SLM) capable of both speech\nand text generation. Compared to modular and aligned MLLMs, native MLLMs\npreserve richer paralinguistic features such as emotion and prosody, and\ngenerate speech responses directly within the backbone LLM rather than using a\nseparate speech decoder. This integration also results in lower response\nlatency and smoother interaction. However, native MLLMs suffer from\ncatastrophic forgetting and performance degradation because the available\npaired speech-text data is insufficient to support the pretraining of MLLMs\ncompared to the vast amount of text data required to pretrain text LLMs. To\naddress this issue, we propose DeepTalk, a framework for adaptive modality\nexpert learning based on a Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture. DeepTalk\nfirst adaptively distinguishes modality experts according to their modality\nload within the LLM. Each modality expert then undergoes specialized\nsingle-modality training, followed by joint multimodal collaborative training.\nAs a result, DeepTalk incurs only a 5.5% performance drop compared to the\noriginal LLM, which is significantly lower than the average performance drop of\nover 20% typically seen in native MLLMs (such as GLM-4-Voice), and is on par\nwith modular MLLMs. Meanwhile, the end-to-end dialogue latency remains within\n0.5 seconds, ensuring a seamless and intelligent speech interaction experience.\nCode and models are released at https://github.com/talkking/DeepTalk.",

    "abstract": "Large Vision and Language Models (LVLMs) have shown strong performance across\nvarious vision-language tasks in natural image domains. However, their\napplication to remote sensing (RS) remains underexplored due to significant\ndomain differences in visual appearances, object scales, and semantics. These\ndiscrepancies hider the effective understanding of RS scenes, which contain\nrich, multi-level semantic information spanning from coarse-to-fine levels.\nHence, it limits the direct adaptation of existing LVLMs to RS imagery. To\naddress this gap, we propose a novel LVLM framework tailored for RS\nunderstanding, incorporating two core components: Semantic-augmented\nMulti-level Alignment and Semantic-aware Expert Modeling. First, to align\nmulti-level visual features, we introduce the retrieval-based Semantic\nAugmentation Module which enriches the visual features with relevant semantics\nacross fine-to-coarse levels (e.g., object- and scene-level information). It is\ndesigned to retrieve relevant semantic cues from a RS semantic knowledge\ndatabase, followed by aggregation of semantic cues with user query and\nmulti-level visual features, resulting in semantically enriched representation\nacross multiple levels. Second, for Semantic-aware Expert Modeling, we design\nsemantic experts, where each expert is responsible for processing semantic\nrepresentation at different levels separately. This enables hierarchical\nsemantic understanding from coarse to fine levels. Evaluations across multiple\nRS tasks-including scene classification and VQA, etc.-demonstrate that the\nproposed framework achieves consistent improvements across multiple semantic\nlevels. This highlights its capability and effectiveness in bridging the gap\nbetween general LVLMs and unique demands of RS-specific vision-language\nunderstanding.",

In\nthis work, we apply a novel image-manipulation technique, termed\n'X-arithmetic', to a sample of 15 galaxy clusters and groups deeply observed\nwith Chandra. This technique decomposes perturbations in feedback-dominated\nregions into images excluding either (1) weak shocks and sound waves, (2)\nbubbles inflated by jets, or (3) cooling and slow gas motions (isobaric\nperturbations), enabling efficient spatial identification of these features\nwithout involving spectroscopic analysis. We confirm the nature of previously\n(spectroscopically-)identified features and newly establish the origin of other\nstructures. We find that feedback produces multiple shocks in groups and\nmassive galaxies, but only one to two shocks in clusters. Prominent isobaric\nstructures are abundant around inner cavities in clusters, compared to almost\nno such structures in groups. These differences suggest that feedback effects\nare stronger in smaller-mass systems, possibly due to the shallower\ngravitational potential of groups or more violent feedback. Follow-up\nspectroscopy, guided by the X-arithmetic results, suggests that\nearlier-identified \"isothermal shocks\" could be a mix of isobaric and adiabatic\nstructures. We applied X-arithmetic to galaxy cluster simulations,\ndemonstrating its straightforward application and future potential for testing\nthe feedback physics details in simulations.

Allowing for the fact that each of the four $P_c$ states couples\nstrongly to a nearby $S$-wave channel, three criteria on the\ncompositeness/elementariness are adopted in this study: the pole-counting rule,\nthe spectral density function, and the Gamow wave function.

    "abstract": "RGB-IR(RGB-Infrared) image pairs are frequently applied simultaneously in\nvarious applications like intelligent surveillance. However, as the number of\nmodalities increases, the required data storage and transmission costs also\ndouble. Therefore, efficient RGB-IR data compression is essential. This work\nproposes a joint compression framework for RGB-IR image pair. Specifically, to\nfully utilize cross-modality prior information for accurate context probability\nmodeling within and between modalities, we propose a Channel-wise\nCross-modality Entropy Model (CCEM). Among CCEM, a Low-frequency Context\nExtraction Block (LCEB) and a Low-frequency Context Fusion Block (LCFB) are\ndesigned for extracting and aggregating the global low-frequency information\nfrom both modalities, which assist the model in predicting entropy parameters\nmore accurately. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms\nexisting RGB-IR image pair and single-modality compression methods on LLVIP and\nKAIST datasets. For instance, the proposed framework achieves a 23.1% bit rate\nsaving on LLVIP dataset compared to the state-of-the-art RGB-IR image codec\npresented at CVPR 2022.",

    "abstract": "Treating the electron as a charged spinon we propose a theory of magnon\nspintronics, a non-Abelian gauge theory of SU(2)xU(1), which could be viewed as\nan effective theory of electron spintronics. Just like QED the theory has the\nU(1) electromagnetic interaction, but the new ingredient is the non-Abelian\nSU(2) gauge interaction of the magnon with the spinon. A remarkable feature of\nthe theory is the photon-magnon mixing, the mixing between the electromagnetic\nU(1) gauge boson and the diagonal part of the SU(2) magnon gauge boson. After\nthe mixing we have the massless Abelian magnon and a massive photon, and the\ndoubly charged massive off-diagonal non-Abelian magnons which induce the\nspin-flip interaction to the spinon. The theory is characterized by three\nscales. In addition to the correlation length fixed by the mass of the Higgs\nfield it has two different penetration lengths, the one fixed by the mass of\nthe photon which generates the well known Meissner effect and the other fixed\nby the mass of the off-diagonal magnons which generates the non-Abelian\nMeissner effect. The non-Abelian structure of the theory naturally accommodates\nnew topological objects, the non-Abrikosov quantized magnonic vortex and\nnon-Abelian magnonic monopole of the Cho-Maison type, as well as the well known\nAbrikosov vortex. We discuss the physical implications of the non-Abelian gauge\ntheory of the magnon spintronics.",

This limitation is noteworthy, as the human brain\ninherently processes three-dimensional spatial information regardless of\nwhether observing 2D images or the real world. The neural activities captured\nby EEG contain rich spatial information that is inevitably lost when\nreconstructing only 2D images, thus limiting its practical applications in BCI.\nThe transition from EEG data to 3D object reconstruction faces considerable\nobstacles.

The HST ACS F814W i-band and H$\\alpha$ + [N II]\n$\\lambda\\lambda$ 6548,84 narrow-band images indicate that this galaxy is a\nlate-stage merger. The ionized gas emission in the inner $\\sim$ 2 kpc radius,\ntraced by the GMOS data, is consistent with two kinematic components: (i) a\nrotating disk, observed as a narrow component in the emission-line profiles,\nwith velocity dispersion of $\\sigma$ $\\leq$ 200 km s$^{-1}$, and (ii) an\noutflow, traced by a broad component in the emission-line profiles, with\n$\\sigma\\geq$ 500 km s$^{-1}$. The disk component is well reproduced by a model\nof rotation in a plane with similar orientation to that of the large-scale\ngalaxy disk. The outflow component presents bulk velocities of up to -500 km\ns$^{-1}$ and corresponds to a mass outflow rate of $\\dot{M}_o = 0.122 \\pm 0.026\nM_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. Emission-line ratio diagrams indicate that the gas\nexcitation is mainly due to an active galactic nucleus, likely the driver of\nthe outflow. The VLA radio image reveals a dominant radio core with two-sided\nemission along the NE-SW direction. The radio core's spectral index and\nbrightness temperature indicate AGN emission, with the extended emission\nresembling both in morphology and spectral index the emission observed in\nradio-quiet quasars. Combined with previous similar studies of other OHM\ngalaxies, the present work supports that this phase is linked to the triggering\nof an AGN, that seems to occur in the final stages of a merger.",

Recently, several\nSAM-based methods have made notable progress in this task by automatically\ngenerating prompts to guide SAM. However, these methods often generate prompts\nat boundaries of target regions due to suboptimal prompt encoder, which results\nin instability and reduced robustness. In this work, we introduce ProSAM, a\nsimple but effective method to address the stability challenges we identified\nin existing SAM-based visual reference segmentation approaches.
