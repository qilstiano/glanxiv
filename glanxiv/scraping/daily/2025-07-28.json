    "abstract": "This paper is concerned with mixed finite element method (FEM) for solving\nthe two-dimensional, nonlinear fourth-order active fluid equations. By\nintroducing an auxiliary variable $w=-\\Delta u$, the original fourth problem is\ntransformed into a system of second-order equations, which relaxes the\nregularity requirements of standard $H^2$-conforming finite spaces. To further\nenhance the robustness and efficiency of the algorithm, an additional auxiliary\nvariable $\\phi$, treated analogously to the pressure, is introduced, leading to\na divergence-free preserving mixed finite element scheme. A fully discrete\nscheme is then constructed by coupling the spatial mixed FEM with the\nvariable-step Dahlquist-Liniger-Nevanlinna (DLN) time integrator. The\nboundedness of the scheme and corresponding error estimates can be rigorously\nproven under appropriate assumptions due to unconditional non-linear stability\nand second-order accuracy of the DLN method. To enhance computational\nefficiency in practice, we develop an adaptive time-stepping strategy based on\na minimum-dissipation criterion. Several numerical experiments are displayed to\nfully validate the theoretical results and demonstrate the accuracy and\nefficiency of the scheme for complex active fluid simulations.",

    "abstract": "We have initiated a large project on identifying the requirements for\ndeveloping a realistic and ground-up approach to simulating the formation of\nterrestrial planets in our solar system. As the first phase of this project, we\npresent here the criteria that any model of planetesimal growth needs to\nfulfill in order to be self-consistent and produce reliable results. We\ndemonstrate how these criteria emerge by revisiting runaway growth and carrying\nout a thorough analysis of its results. As our goal is to identify the pathway\nto a realistic model, we focus analysis on simulations where at the beginning,\nplanetesimals are not artificially enlarged. We show how using uninflated\nplanetesimals, as the first requirement for a realistic model, will result in a\nset of criteria naturally emerging from the evolution of the system. For\ninstance, the growth times in simulations with uninflated planetesimals become\ncomparable to the time of giant planet formation implying that any realistic\nsimulation of planetesimal growth, in addition to using real-size\nplanetesimals, needs to include the perturbation of the growing giant planets\nas well. Our analysis also points to a strong connection between the initial\ndistribution of planetesimals and the final outcome. For instance, due to their\nnatural expansion, initially isolated distributions, or a collection of\ninitially isolated distributions, such as rings of planetesimals, do not\nproduce reliable results. In a self-consistent and realistic model, where the\ninitial conditions are supported by basic principles and do not include\nsimplifying, ad hoc assumptions, the entire disk of planetesimals has to be\nsimulated at once. We present the results of our analyses and discuss their\nimplied criteria.",

In this\nwork, we introduce a new task paradigm: proactive information gathering, where\nLLMs must identify gaps in the provided context and strategically elicit\nimplicit user knowledge through targeted questions. To systematically study and\ntrain this capability, we design a scalable framework that generates partially\nspecified, real-world tasks, masking key information and simulating authentic\nambiguity.

While deep\nlearning models achieve over 97% classification accuracy, their vulnerability\nto adversarial attacks remains largely unexplored in the physical domain. We\npresent ERa Attack, the first radio frequency (RF) adversarial method targeting\nEMG devices through intentional electromagnetic interference (IEMI). Using\nlow-power software-defined radio transmitters, attackers inject optimized RF\nperturbations to mislead downstream models. Our approach bridges digital and\nphysical domains: we generate adversarial perturbations using Projected\nGradient Descent, extract 50-150 Hz components via inverse STFT, and employ\nsynchronization-free strategies (constant spectrum noise or narrowband\nmodulation). Perturbations, constrained to 1-10% of signal amplitude, are\namplitude-modulated onto 433 MHz carriers. Experiments on the Myo Dataset (7\ngestures, 350 samples) demonstrate significant impact: at 1 meter and 0 dBm\ntransmission power, classification accuracy drops from 97.8% to 58.3%, with\n41.7% misclassification rate and 25.6% targeted attack success rate.

Existing MMHCVRP solvers typically select a\nvehicle and its next node to visit at each decoding step, but often make myopic\ndecoding decisions and overlook key properties of MMHCVRP, including local\ntopological relationships, vehicle permutation invariance, and node symmetry,\nresulting in suboptimal performance.

To assess the\nperformance of ECHO, we conduct extensive experiments.

However, inevitably\nthe packet delay is increased, as during the silent period no transmission is\nallowed. In this paper we study how to configure cell DTX/DRX to optimally\nbalance energy saving and packet delay, so that for delay-sensitive traffic\nmaximum energy saving can be achieved while the degradation of quality of\nservice (QoS) is minimized. As the optimal configuration can be different for\ndifferent network and traffic conditions, the problem is complex and we resort\nto deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework to train an AI agent to solve\nit. Through careful design of 1) the learning algorithm, which implements a\ndeep Q-network (DQN) on a contextual bandit (CB) model, and 2) the reward\nfunction, which utilizes a smooth approximation of a theoretically optimal but\ndiscontinuous reward function, we are able to train an AI agent that always\ntries to select the best possible Cell DTX/DRX configuration under any network\nand traffic conditions.

Our result confirmed that motor\nlearning improved both physical and perceived gait pattern towards normal,\nindicating that via practice the wearers incorporated the robotic leg into\ntheir sensorimotor systems to enable wearer-robot movement coordination.\nHowever, a persistent discrepancy between perceived and actual motion remained,\nlikely due to the absence of direct sensation and control of the prosthesis\nfrom wearers.

While this\napproach has successfully produced evidence for the presence of\nnanohertz-wavelength gravitational waves, it does not, on its own, produce any\ndirectional information. It is also insensitive to the polarization of the\ngravitational waves. An alternative approach is to construct maps of the\ngravitational wave distribution on the sky. In this paper, we present a simple\nquadratic estimator of the gravitational wave power as a function of direction\non the sky that is sensitive to the polarization state of the wave. In this\nway, we describe the full, $S_2 \\times S_2$, state-space of a polarized\ngravitational wave background across the sky and the Poincar\\'e sphere\ndescribing polarization. A natural question arises from this perspective: what\nis the resolution of a polarized sky-map, i.e. effectively how many independent\npixels can a such a map contain? In other words, how many distinct\ngravitational waves can a PTA, in principle, distinguish? It turns out the\nanswer is finite, and is approximately $N_{\\rm res} = 16 \\times 2 = 32$ per\nfrequency, where 16 is the number of resolvable sky-positions and 2 is the\nnumber of distinct polarization states. This corresponds to an angular\nresolution of $58^\\circ$, which can be achieved by a PTA with more than $N_{\\rm\npulsar} \\gtrsim 20$ pulsars. We demonstrate that the variance of the map is\nequivalent to the HD significance, while for a single point source, a\n3-$\\sigma$ HD signal corresponds to a 5.2-$\\sigma$ map significance.",

In this paper, we introduce PDAF, a\nProbabilistic Diffusion Alignment Framework that enhances the generalization of\nexisting segmentation networks through probabilistic diffusion modeling. PDAF\nintroduces a Latent Domain Prior (LDP) to capture domain shifts and uses this\nprior as a conditioning factor to align both source and unseen target domains.\nTo achieve this, PDAF integrates into a pre-trained segmentation model and\nutilizes paired source and pseudo-target images to simulate latent domain\nshifts, enabling LDP modeling. The framework comprises three modules: the\nLatent Prior Extractor (LPE) predicts the LDP by supervising domain shifts; the\nDomain Compensation Module (DCM) adjusts feature representations to mitigate\ndomain shifts; and the Diffusion Prior Estimator (DPE) leverages a diffusion\nprocess to estimate the LDP without requiring paired samples.

The pseudo prior used in PP-VB-EP acts as an approximated\nposterior and serves as a regularization term that prevents the Message Passing\n(MP) algorithm from diverging. To compute the pseudo prior in a distributed\nfashion, we further develop a distributed version of the Variable-Level\nExpectation Propagation (VL-EP) algorithm.",

We study six different\nhigh entropy nitrides with eight different metal species to build a predictive\nmodel of the nitrogen vacancy formation energy. We construct sets of supercells\nthat maximize the number of unique nitrogen environments for a given chemistry,\nand then use density-functional theory to calculate the energy density for all\nnitrogen sites, and the vacancy formation energies for the highest, lowest, and\na median subset based on the energy densities. The energy density of nitrogen\nsites correlates with the vacancy formation energies, for binary, ternary and\nhigh entropy nitrides. A linear regression model predicts the vacancy formation\nenergies using only the nearest-neighbor composition; across our eight metals,\nwe find the largest vacancy formation energies next to Hf, then Zr, Ti, V, Cr,\nTa, Nb, and the lowest near Mo. Additionally, we see that binary nitride data\nshows qualitatively similar vacancy formation energy trends for high entropy\nnitrides; however, the binary data alone is insufficient to predict the complex\nnitride behavior. Our model is both predictive and easily interpretable, and\ncorrelates with experimental data.",

This hinders detectors\nfrom comprehensively perceiving the characteristics of the physical world. To\nalleviate this, we introduce a multi-task learning framework, Collaborative\nPerceiver (CoP), that leverages spatial occupancy as auxiliary information to\nmine consistent structural and conceptual similarities shared between 3D object\ndetection and occupancy prediction tasks, bridging gaps in spatial\nrepresentations and feature refinement. To this end, we first propose a\npipeline to generate dense occupancy ground truths incorporating local density\ninformation (LDO) for reconstructing detailed environmental information. Next,\nwe employ a voxel-height-guided sampling (VHS) strategy to distill fine-grained\nlocal features according to distinct object properties. Furthermore, we develop\na global-local collaborative feature fusion (CFF) module that seamlessly\nintegrates complementary knowledge between both tasks, thus composing more\nrobust BEV representations.

The\nonset of such instabilities is governed by the eigenvalues of the thermodynamic\nHessian matrix, while the flavour-space polarisations of the unstable diffusion\nmodes are determined by the corresponding eigenvectors. We illustrate this\nconnection using strongly coupled N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory at\nfinite densities of the three U(1) R-charges. In the dual holographic\ndescription, the five-dimensional STU black brane exhibits unstable quasinormal\nmodes precisely at the onset of thermodynamic instability. We derive analytic\nexpressions for the R-charge diffusion coefficients in several representative\ncases, including the configuration with three equal chemical potentials.",

To address these gaps, we propose a multi-stage\nreinforcement learning framework that simulates EV charging demand across large\ngeographical areas. We validate the model against real-world data, and identify\nthe training stage that most closely reflects actual driver behaviour, which\ncaptures both the adaptive behaviours and bounded rationality of private\ndrivers.

Building such\nbenchmarks by manual annotations is labour-intensive and limits the size and\nscalability of the benchmarks. In this work, we present StructText, an\nend-to-end framework for automatically generating high-fidelity benchmarks for\nkey-value extraction from text using existing tabular data. It uses available\ntabular data as structured ground truth, and follows a two-stage\n``plan-then-execute'' pipeline to synthetically generate corresponding\nnatural-language text. To ensure alignment between text and structured source,\nwe introduce a multi-dimensional evaluation strategy that combines (a)\nLLM-based judgments on factuality, hallucination, and coherence and (b)\nobjective extraction metrics measuring numeric and temporal accuracy. We\nevaluated the proposed method on 71,539 examples across 49 datasets. Results\nreveal that while LLMs achieve strong factual accuracy and avoid hallucination,\nthey struggle with narrative coherence in producing extractable text.

As Daniel\nKahneman and Amos Tversky famously discovered, humans do so in a distinctive\nway that departs from mathematical rationalism.

I report the first tests of\nKahneman and Tversky's landmark 'prospect theory' with Large Language Models,\nincluding today's state of the art chain-of-thought 'reasoners'.\n  In common with humans, I find that prospect theory often anticipates how\nthese models approach risky decisions across a range of scenarios. I also\ndemonstrate that context is key to explaining much of the variance in risk\nappetite. The 'frame' through which risk is apprehended appears to be embedded\nwithin the language of the scenarios tackled by the models. Specifically, I\nfind that military scenarios generate far larger 'framing effects' than do\ncivilian settings, ceteris paribus. My research suggests, therefore, that\nlanguage models the world, capturing our human heuristics and biases. But also\nthat these biases are uneven - the idea of a 'frame' is richer than simple\ngains and losses. Wittgenstein's notion of 'language games' explains the\ncontingent, localised biases activated by these scenarios.

In this study, we investigate\nthe gravitational-wave signatures of PBHs, with a particular focus on\nevaluating their integrated contribution to the stochastic gravitational-wave\nbackground arising from binary mergers over a broad range of redshifts. We\nperform a Bayesian analysis of gravitational-wave events following all\nGravitational-Wave Transient Catalog data, assuming a log-normal PBH mass\nfunction. We compute the merger rate distribution of PBH binaries by accounting\nfor gravitational torques from the surrounding PBH. To constrain this rate, we\nemploy the latest limits from the third observing run of LIGO/Virgo. Owing to\ntheir primordial origin, PBHs exhibit enhanced merger activity at high\nredshifts, prior to the onset of stellar formation. Our analysis yields a\nrelatively weak inference on the redshift evolution index of the PBH merger\nrate, with $\\alpha = 2.19^{+0.16}_{-0.16}$ at 68\\% confidence level. The local\nmerger rate of PBH binaries is found with posterior estimates lying in the\nrange $23.5-30.3~\\mathrm{Gpc}^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$, reflecting a high degree\nof statistical precision in the inferred distribution.

    "abstract": "This study presented the development of a deep learning-based Automatic\nSpeech Recognition system for Shona, a low-resource language characterized by\nunique tonal and grammatical complexities. The research aimed to address the\nchallenges posed by limited training data, lack of labelled data, and the\nintricate tonal nuances present in Shona speech, with the objective of\nachieving significant improvements in recognition accuracy compared to\ntraditional statistical models. The research first explored the feasibility of\nusing deep learning to develop an accurate ASR system for Shona. Second, it\ninvestigated the specific challenges involved in designing and implementing\ndeep learning architectures for Shona speech recognition and proposed\nstrategies to mitigate these challenges. Lastly, it compared the performance of\nthe deep learning-based model with existing statistical models in terms of\naccuracy. The developed ASR system utilized a hybrid architecture consisting of\na Convolutional Neural Network for acoustic modelling and a Long Short-Term\nMemory network for language modelling. To overcome the scarcity of data, data\naugmentation techniques and transfer learning were employed. Attention\nmechanisms were also incorporated to accommodate the tonal nature of Shona\nspeech. The resulting ASR system achieved impressive results, with a Word Error\nRate of 29%, Phoneme Error Rate of 12%, and an overall accuracy of 74%. These\nmetrics indicated the potential of deep learning to enhance ASR accuracy for\nunder-resourced languages like Shona.

After filtering for singleton births with\none or two prior cesareans and complete data across 47 prenatal-period\nfeatures, three classifiers were trained: logistic regression, XGBoost, and a\nmultilayer perceptron (MLP).

By applying the Israel junction\nconditions explicitly in the presence of a scalar field minimally coupled to\nthe gravitational sector, it is shown that a nontrivial scalar profile cannot\nbe sustained, as it induces a divergence at the stellar center. Since\nanalytical solutions are unattainable, the background metric is determined\nthrough numerical integration for a few representative configurations. For\naxial gravitational perturbations, it is found that the system of equations of\nmotion cannot be decoupled as long as the {\\AE}ther parameter $c_i$ does not\nvanish. Subsequently, the dynamics of the system can be simplified to two\ncoupled equations that describe vector and tensor perturbations with distinct\nwave velocities $c_V$ and $c_T$, giving rise to a bimodal system. It is shown\nthat as the stellar radius is smaller than that of the maximum of the vacuum\nSchwarzschild-type effective potential, a potential well is formed, leading to\nthe emergence of echo phenomenon for the axial gravitational perturbations.\nWhen the stellar radius exceeds the {\\it could-have-been} maximum, the\nresulting effective potential decreases monotonically, and the wave propagation\nis primarily dictated by the discontinuity occurring at the star's surface,\nproducing a type of more attenuated echo waves. In addition, we explore the\nspecific properties of the resultant bimodal medium consisting of two degrees\nof freedom with distinct sound speeds.

    "abstract": "Bugs, especially those in concurrent systems, are often hard to reproduce\nbecause they manifest only under rare conditions. Testers frequently encounter\nfailures that occur only under specific inputs, even when occurring with low\nprobability. We propose an approach to systematically amplify the occurrence of\nsuch elusive bugs. We treat the system under test as a black-box and use\nrepeated trial executions to train a predictive model that estimates the\nprobability of a given input configuration triggering a bug. We evaluate this\napproach on a dataset of 17 representative concurrency bugs spanning diverse\ncategories. Several model-based search techniques are compared against a\nbrute-force random sampling baseline. Our results show that an ensemble of\nregression models can significantly increase bug occurrence rates across nearly\nall scenarios, often achieving an order-of-magnitude improvement over random\nsampling. The contributions of this work include: (i) a novel formulation of\nbug-amplification as a rare-event regression problem; (ii) an empirical\nevaluation of multiple techniques for amplifying bug occurrence, demonstrating\nthe effectiveness of model-guided search; and (iii) a practical, non-invasive\ntesting framework that helps practitioners expose hidden concurrency faults\nwithout altering the internal system architecture.",

We observe\nthat this isn't always true -- higher-order references, by themselves, don't\nlead to non-termination. The key insight is that Landin's Knot relies not\nprimarily on references storing functions, but on unrestricted quantification\nover a function's environment. We show this through a closure converted\nlanguage, in which the function's environment is made explicit and hides the\ntype of the environment through impredicative quantification. Once references\nare added, this impredicative quantification can be exploited to encode\nrecursion. We conjecture that by restricting the quantification over the\nenvironment, higher-order references can be safely added to terminating\nlanguages, without resorting to more complex type systems such as linearity,\nand without restricting references from storing functions.",

    "abstract": "A well-established result in quantum field theory in four-dimensional de\nSitter space is that the vacuum state of a massless scalar field breaks the de\nSitter isometry group, leading to time-dependent (secular) growth in\ncorrelation functions computed in inflationary coordinates. This behavior is\nwidely believed to extend to more general theories involving light scalar\nfields with weak non-derivative interactions. In such cases, secular growth is\nthought to be further amplified by loop corrections, and the stochastic\nformalism is often regarded as the appropriate framework to resum these\ninfrared effects. In this article we challenge this prevailing view. A crucial\ndistinction must be made between two cases: a massless scalar field protected\nby a shift symmetry, and a light scalar without such a symmetry. In the former,\nthe shift symmetry enforces derivative interactions, yielding observables in\nwhich secular growth plays no physical role. In the latter, although\ncorrelation functions develop infrared divergences in the massless limit, they\nremain fully invariant under the de Sitter isometry group. We analyze the\nstructure of these divergences arising from loop integrals and show that, in\nthe soft-momentum limit, they do not alter the time dependence of tree-level\ncorrelators. In fact, using a de Sitter-invariant renormalization scheme based\non Wilson's axioms for integration, these divergences can be systematically\nremoved order by order. We therefore conclude that neither massless nor light\nscalar fields in de Sitter space exhibit genuine secular growth. We further\ndiscuss the implications of these findings for the validity and scope of the\nstochastic approach to inflation.",

The number, strength, and\nduration of these pulses can lead to shell collisions that produce\nshock-powered transients, potentially explaining some of the most luminous\nevents, such as superluminous supernovae, and other rare transients. Rapid\nprogenitor rotation lowers the PPISN mass threshold and influences the\ndynamics, energetics, and chemical composition of PPISN-driven pulses. In this\nstudy, we computed 1D evolutionary models of massive, rotating PPISN progenitor\nstars with zero-age main-sequence masses of 85-140 solar masses and solar\nmetallicity and 10% solar metallicity. Our analysis reveals strong correlations\nbetween PPISN ejected mass and total energy as well as between ejected mass and\npeak ejected shell velocity. Additionally, moderate correlations indicate that\nhigher initial PPISN progenitor mass leads to greater mass ejection and energy\nrelease, while negative correlations show that rapid rotation appears to reduce\nmass ejection and kinetic energy of the shells. Subsequent pulses lead to\nhydrogen-poor, carbon- and oxygen-enriched ejected shells, indicating the\neffect of rotationally-induced chemical mixing in PPISN-driven episodic mass\nloss with implications for their transients. We model the light curve and\nsynthetic spectra that arise from the collision of two H-poor shells for one of\nour models using the radiation transport code SuperLite.

    "abstract": "We study the bolometric evolution of the exceptional Type Ic Supernova (SN)\n2022jli, aiming to understand the underlying mechanisms responsible for its\ndistinctive double-peaked light curve morphology, extended timescales, and the\nrapid, steep decline in luminosity observed at around 270 days after the SN\ndiscovery. We present a quantitative assessment of two leading models through\nhydrodynamic radiative simulations: two shells enriched with nickel and a\ncombination of nickel and magnetar power. We explore the parameter space of a\nmodel in which the SN is powered by radioactive decay assuming a bimodal nickel\ndistribution. While this setup can reproduce the early light curve properties,\nit faces problems to explain the prominent second peak. We therefore consider a\nhybrid scenario with a rapidly rotating magnetar as additional energy source.\nWe find that the observed light curve morphology can be well reproduced by a\nmodel combining a magnetar engine and a double-layer $^{56}$Ni distribution.\nThe best-fitting case consist of a magnetar with a spin period of $P\\simeq 22$\nms and a bipolar magnetic field strength of $B\\simeq 5\\times 10^{14}$ G and a\nradioactive content with total nickel mass of 0.15 M$_\\odot$, distributed\nacross two distinct shells within a pre-SN structure of 11 M$_\\odot$. To\nreproduce the abrupt drop in luminosity at $\\sim 270$ d, the energy deposition\nfrom the magnetar must be rapidly and effectively switched off.",

Level-5 automated driving\nsystems (ADSs) could reduce driver errors contributing to pedestrian accidents,\nthough effectiveness depends on clarity and understandability for other road\nusers. External human-machine interfaces (eHMIs) have been proposed to\nfacilitate pedestrian-ADS communication, though consensus on optimal eHMI\nfeatures remains unclear. In an online survey, 153 participants responded to\nroad-crossing scenarios involving level-5 ADSs, with and without eHMIs. With\neHMIs, pedestrians crossed earlier and more confidently, and reported\nsignificantly increased perceptions of safety, trust, and understanding when\ninteracting with level-5 ADSs. Visual eHMI features (including a text display\nand external speedometer) were ranked more necessary than auditory ones, though\nauditory cues received positive feedback.

This work investigates\nwhether human-based clinical rationales can serve as additional supervision to\nimprove both performance and explainability of transformer-based models that\nautomatically encode clinical documents. We analyzed 99,125 human-based\nclinical rationales that provide plausible explanations for primary cancer site\ndiagnoses, using them as additional training samples alongside 128,649\nelectronic pathology reports to evaluate transformer-based models for\nextracting primary cancer sites. We also investigated sufficiency as a way to\nmeasure rationale quality for pre-selecting rationales. Our results showed that\nclinical rationales as additional training data can improve model performance\nin high-resource scenarios but produce inconsistent behavior when resources are\nlimited. Using sufficiency as an automatic metric to preselect rationales also\nleads to inconsistent results. Importantly, models trained on rationales were\nconsistently outperformed by models trained on additional reports instead. This\nsuggests that clinical rationales don't consistently improve model performance\nand are outperformed by simply using more reports. Therefore, if the goal is\noptimizing accuracy, annotation efforts should focus on labeling more reports\nrather than creating rationales. However, if explainability is the priority,\ntraining models on rationale-supplemented data may help them better identify\nrationale-like features. We conclude that using clinical rationales as\nadditional training data results in smaller performance improvements and only\nslightly better explainability (measured as average token-level rationale\ncoverage) compared to training on additional reports.",

The first method\nof construction is by detuning the regularities of the two subgraphs and the\nsecond is by asymmetrically constructing the bipartite connection matrix $C$ by\nallowing it to be directed, and then detuning those regularities. While the\nintuition is derived from the motivation of using complex synchronized networks\nfor quantum information storage and computations, the proofs for constructing\neigenvectors that interact in a quantum-like fashion only require the structure\nof the graph embedded in the adjacency matrix.

    "abstract": "We study the out-of-equilibrium scaling behavior of two-dimensional and\nthree-dimensional Ising systems, when they are slowly driven across their {\\em\nmagnetic} first-order transitions at low temperature $T<T_c$, where $T_c$ is\nthe temperature of their continuous transition. We consider Kibble-Zurek (KZ)\nprotocols in which a spatially homogenous magnetic field $h$ varies as\n$h(t)=t/t_s$ with a time scale $t_s$. The KZ dynamics starts from\nnegatively-magnetized configurations equilibrated at $h_i<0$ and stops at a\npositive value of $h$ where the configurations acquire a positive average\nmagnetization. We consider the Metropolis and the heat-bath dynamics, which are\ntwo specific examples of a purely relaxational dynamics. We focus on two\ndifferent dynamic regimes. We consider the out-equilibrium finite-size scaling\n(OFSS) limit in which the system size $L$ and the time scale $t_s$ diverge\nsimultaneously, keeping an appropriate combination fixed. Then, we analyze the\nKZ dynamics in the thermodynamic limit (TL), obtained by taking first the\n$L\\to\\infty$ limit at fixed $t$ and $t_s$, and then considering the scaling\nbehavior in the large-$t_s$ limit. Our numerical results provide evidence of\nOFSS, as predicted by general scaling arguments. The results in the TL show the\nemergence of spinodal-like behaviors: The passage from the\nnegatively-magnetized phase to the positively-magnetized one occurs at positive\nvalues $h_*>0$ of the magnetic field, which decrease as $h_* \\sim 1/(\\ln\nt_s)^\\kappa$, with $\\kappa = 2$ and $\\kappa=1$ in two and three dimensions,\nrespectively, for $t_s\\to\\infty$. We identify $\\sigma \\equiv t (\\ln\nt)^\\kappa/t_s$ as the relevant scaling variable associated with the KZ dynamics\nin the TL.",

    "abstract": "Near-infrared high-resolution echelle spectrographs unlock access to\nfundamental properties of exoplanets, from their atmospheric escape and\ncomposition to their orbital architecture, which can all be studied\nsimultaneously from transit observations. We present the first results of the\nnewly commissioned ESO near-infrared spectrograph, NIRPS, from three transits\nof WASP-69b. We used the RM Revolutions technique to better constrain the\norbital architecture of the system. We extracted the high-resolution helium\nabsorption profile to study its spectral shape and temporal variations. Then,\nwe made 3D simulations from the EVE code to fit the helium absorption time\nseries. We measure a slightly misaligned orbit for WASP-69b (psi of 28.7+/-5.7\ndeg). We confirm the detection of helium with an average excess absorption of\n3.17+/-0.05%. The helium absorption is spectrally and temporally resolved,\nextends to high altitudes and has a strong velocity shift up to -29.5+/-2.5\nkm/s 50 minutes after egress. EVE simulations put constraints on the mass loss\nof 2.25 10^11 g/s and hint at reactive chemistry within the cometary-like tail\nand interaction with the stellar winds that allow the metastable helium to\nsurvive longer than expected. Our results suggest that WASP-69b is undergoing a\ntransformative phase in its history, losing mass while evolving on a misaligned\norbit. This work shows how combining multiple observational tracers such as\norbital architecture, atmospheric escape, and composition, is critical to\nunderstand exoplanet demographics and their formation and evolution. We\ndemonstrate that NIRPS can reach precisions similar to HARPS for RM studies,\nand the high data quality of NIRPS leads to unprecedented atmospheric\ncharacterization. The high stability of NIRPS combined with the large GTO\navailable for its consortium, enables in-depth studies of exoplanets as well as\nlarge population surveys.",

Lett. 117, 076804 (2016)] have recently generalized Bloch's\ntheorem to lattice models with broken translational symmetry. Their formalism\nprovides a bulk-boundary correspondence indicator, D, sensitive directly to the\nlocalization of edge states. We extend this formalism in two significant ways.\nFirst, we explicitly classify the edge-state basis provided by the theory\naccording to their underlying protecting symmetries. Second, acknowledging that\nthe true topological invariant is the Zak phase, inherently defined only for\nperiodic boundary conditions, we introduce an analogous quantity $\\gamma_Z$,\nsuitable for open-boundary systems. We illustrate these developments on the\nexample of the Kitaev wire model. We demonstrate that both indicators, $D$ and\nour open-boundary analog, $\\gamma_Z$, effectively capture topological\nlocalization: while D diverges within the topological phase, $\\gamma_Z = \\pi$ .\nWe further examine eigenvalues ($z$) of the lattice shift operator, showing\nthat variations in these eigenvalues as a function of chemical potential\nprovide additional signatures of topological phase transitions. Additionally,\nwe study a periodic Kitaev wire containing a bond impurity, revealing that\nwhile the topological phase remains characterized by $\\gamma_Z = \\pi$,\nsignificant state localization near the impurity emerges only at critical\nvalues of the chemical potential.",

Specifically, the nonlinear observer-based framework enables the\nreconstruction of unmodeled fault signals without assuming that they originate\nfrom a known exogenous system, offering robustness against parametric\nuncertainties. Meanwhile, the predictor forwards the delayed output in time.\nSubsequently, a sliding mode control law is formulated to enforce an ideal\nsliding mode and ensure global stabilization, even under a broader class of\nperturbations, unmodeled disturbances, parametric uncertainties, and delays,\nowing to the integration of the Super-Twisting observer.

However, the inherent\nsparsity of these measurements raises concerns regarding the feasibility of\nthis approach. We assessed the achievable accuracy of UHECR backtracking using\nmock sparse local GMF data derived from the Jansson & Farrar 2012 (JF12) GMF\nmodel and mock UHECR events. We created mock UHECR datasets that trace back\nwithin a 3 degree angular range from the galaxy M82 (a hypothesized UHECR\nsource), and we investigated the impact on such backtracking attempts of\nvarying GMF measurement sparsity and of varying GMF strength, which we emulated\nby rescaling the strength of the ordered components of the JF12 model. We found\nthat: (a) for an average GMF strength of $1\\mu G$, satisfactory backtracking\nresults for magnetic rigidities of $10^{20}$ eV can be obtained even with very\nsparse measurements ($ \\sim 1600$ pc); (b) when the average GMF strength is\nsignificantly increased ($\\sim$ factor of 10) the accuracy of backtracking\nbreaks down at measurement spacings of 400 pc. These findings emphasize on one\nhand that sparsity is not an automatic deal-breaker for the utility of local\nGMF measurements in UHECR backtracking. On the other hand, we also confirm that\nimportant challenges remain on the path from sparse local GMF measurements to\nprecise charge-particle astronomy, especially in directions of high-strength\nordered magnetic fields.

    "abstract": "The Compton Spectrometer and Imager (COSI) is an upcoming NASA Small Explorer\nsatellite mission, designed for all-sky observations in the soft gamma-ray\ndomain with the use of germanium detectors (GeDs). An active Anticoincidence\nSystem (ACS) of BGO scintillators surrounds the GeDs to reduce the background\nand contribute to the detection of transient events. Accurately modeling the\nACS performance requires simulating the intricate scintillation processes\nwithin the shields, which significantly increases the computational cost. We\nhave encoded these effects into a correction matrix derived from dedicated\nGeant4 simulations with the inclusion of the optical physics. For this purpose,\nwe use laboratory measurements for the energy and spatial response of the ACS\nlateral wall to benchmark the simulation and define instrument parameters,\nincluding the BGO absorption length and the electronic noise. We demonstrate\nthat the simulations replicate the experimental energy resolution and light\ncollection uniformity along the BGO crystal, with maximum discrepancies of 20%\nand 10%, respectively. The validated simulations are then used to develop the\ncorrection matrix for the lateral wall, accounting for the light collection\nefficiency and energy resolution based on the position within the crystal. The\ngamma-ray quantum detection efficiency is also position-dependent via the\ninclusion of the optical physics. It is enhanced by $\\sim$8% close to the SiPMs\nand suppressed by $\\sim$2% in the adjacent corners with respect to the average\nvalue. Finally, we explore the energy threshold and resolution of the bottom\nACS, considering the impact of its smaller crystals compared with the lateral\nwalls.",

We propose LAAC (LLM-guided Adversarial Actor Critic), a\nnovel method that leverages large language models (LLMs) as reference policies\nto suggest novel items, while training a lightweight policy to refine these\nsuggestions using system-specific data. The method formulates training as a\nbilevel optimization between actor and critic networks, enabling the critic to\nselectively favor promising novel actions and the actor to improve its policy\nbeyond LLM recommendations. To mitigate overestimation of unreliable LLM\nsuggestions, we apply regularization that anchors critic values for unexplored\nitems close to well-estimated dataset actions. Experiments on real-world\ndatasets show that LAAC outperforms existing baselines in diversity, novelty,\nand accuracy, while remaining robust on imbalanced data, effectively\nintegrating LLM knowledge without expensive fine-tuning.",

Here, we leverage\nultralow-loss photonic waveguides, as well as strategic resonator designs that\nallow us to tailor Raman effects and engineer desired spatial mode\ninteractions, for the robust generation of normal-dispersion Kerr microcombs.\nSpecifically, we show microcombs that substantially surpass state-of-the-art\nbright cavity soliton and EO microcombs on X-cut TFLN in key performance\nmetrics. Additionally, we demonstrate a novel microcomb whose existence is\nunderpinned by both normal-dispersion Kerr dynamics and stimulated Raman\nscattering, in a single spatial mode of a microresonator. This microcomb\nmanifests itself as two interleaved frequency combs centered about the pump and\nStokes frequencies, resulting in extended spectral spans.

These methods either provide no\nuncertainty quantification or require large computational overhead to do so.\nLearned reconstruction methods have shown promise in providing efficient and\nhigh quality reconstruction. In this article we explore the use of generative\nneural networks that enable efficient approximate sampling of the posterior\ndistribution for high quality reconstructions with uncertainty quantification.\nOur RI-GAN framework, builds on the regularised conditional generative\nadversarial network (rcGAN) framework by integrating a gradient U-Net (GU-Net)\narchitecture - a hybrid reconstruction model that embeds the measurement\noperator directly into the network.

There is no evidence for synchrotron\nor spinning dust grain emission contributions for these targets. The inferred\ndust disk spectra all show substantial curvature: their spectral indices\ndecrease with frequency, from $\\alpha_{\\rm d} \\approx 2.8$-4.0 around 43 GHz to\n1.7-2.1 around 340 GHz. This curvature suggests that a substantial fraction of\nthe (sub)millimeter ($\\gtrsim$ 200 GHz) dust emission may be optically thick,\nand therefore the traditional metrics for estimating dust masses are flawed.\nAssuming the emission at lower frequencies (43 GHz) is optically thin, the\nlocal spectral indices and fluxes were used to constrain the disk-averaged dust\nproperties and estimate corresponding dust masses. These masses are roughly an\norder of magnitude higher ($\\approx 1000 \\, M_\\oplus$) than those found from\nthe traditional approach based on (sub)millimeter fluxes. These findings\nemphasize the value of broad spectral coverage - particularly extending to\nlower frequencies ($\\sim$cm-band) - for accurately interpreting dust disk\nemission; such observations may help reshape our perspective on the available\nmass budgets for planet formation.",

    "abstract": "Stellar activity variability is one of the main obstacles to the detection of\nEarth-like planets using the RV method. The aim of this work is to measure the\neffect of activity in the spectra of M dwarfs and detect activity-sensitive\nlines in the NIR. We took advantage of the simultaneous observations of HARPS\nand the newly commissioned NIRPS spectrograph to carry out a blind search of\nthe most activity-sensitive spectral lines in the NIR using NIRPS spectra and\nknown activity indicators in the optical from HARPS as a reference. We analysed\nthe spectra of Proxima (M5.5V) and Gl 581 (M3V), two M dwarfs with different\nactivity levels and internal structures. Spectral lines were identified for\nboth stars and their profiles were fitted using different models. We found\nhundreds of lines sensitive to activity for both stars; the Proxima spectra\nwere more affected. For Proxima, 32% of the identified lines can be used to\nmeasure the rotation period of the star, while for Gl 581 the numbers drops to\n1%. The fraction of lines sensitive to activity increases with increasing line\ndepth. A list of 17 lines with rotation period detection for both stars is\nprovided. Stellar activity is able to affect a significant number of spectral\nlines in the NIR, and methods should be developed to mitigate those effects at\nthe spectral level. The line distortions detected here are expected to come\nmainly from the flux effect due to temperature contrasts between active regions\nand the quiet photosphere; however, we cannot rule out the possibility that\ncore-emission from chromospheric activity or Zeeman splitting are also\naffecting some lines. The new line lists presented here can be used to improve\nthe RV extraction and the detection of RV variability due to stellar activity\nsignals, and to help false positive detection and the modelling of activity\nvariability, thereby enhancing exoplanet detection in the NIR.",

An open question is how systematic this interpretation process\nis. Toward this question, in this paper, we propose a benchmark for\ninvestigating to what extent the abilities of LLMs to interpret questions are\nactually compositional. For this, we generate three datasets of varying\ndifficulty based on graph patterns in DBpedia, relying on Lemon lexica for\nverbalization. Our datasets are created in a very controlled fashion in order\nto test the ability of LLMs to interpret structurally complex questions, given\nthat they have seen the atomic building blocks. This allows us to evaluate to\nwhat degree LLMs are able to interpret complex questions for which they\n\"understand\" the atomic parts. We conduct experiments with models of different\nsizes using both various prompt and few-shot optimization techniques as well as\nfine-tuning. Our results show that performance in terms of macro $F_1$ degrades\nfrom $0.45$ over $0.26$ down to $0.09$ with increasing deviation from the\nsamples optimized on. Even when all necessary information was provided to the\nmodel in the input, the $F_1$ scores do not exceed $0.57$ for the dataset of\nlowest complexity.

    "abstract": "Sparse matrix-sparse matrix multiplication (SpGEMM) is a key kernel in many\nscientific applications and graph workloads. Unfortunately, SpGEMM is\nbottlenecked by data movement due to its irregular memory access patterns.\nSignificant work has been devoted to developing row reordering schemes towards\nimproving locality in sparse operations, but prior studies mostly focus on the\ncase of sparse-matrix vector multiplication (SpMV).\n  In this paper, we address these issues with hierarchical clustering for\nSpGEMM that leverages both row reordering and cluster-wise computation to\nimprove reuse in the second input (B) matrix with a novel row-clustered matrix\nformat and access pattern in the first input (A) matrix. We find that\nhierarchical clustering can speed up SpGEMM by 1.39x on average with low\npreprocessing cost (less than 20x the cost of a single SpGEMM on about 90% of\ninputs). Furthermore, we decouple the reordering algorithm from the clustered\nmatrix format so they can be applied as independent optimizations.\n  Additionally, this paper sheds light on the role of both row reordering and\nclustering independently and together for SpGEMM with a comprehensive empirical\nstudy of the effect of 10 different reordering algorithms and 3 clustering\nschemes on SpGEMM performance on a suite of 110 matrices. We find that\nreordering based on graph partitioning provides better SpGEMM performance than\nexisting alternatives at the cost of high preprocessing time. The evaluation\ndemonstrates that the proposed hierarchical clustering method achieves greater\naverage speedup compared to other reordering schemes with similar preprocessing\ntimes.",

Secular resonances can control the dynamical evolution of near-Earth\nasteroids (NEAs) and, in some cases, lead to increased orbital stability.\nAsteroid 622577 Miorita (2014 LU14) was the first NEA found by the Isaac Newton\nTelescope (INT) and exhibits unusual dynamical traits although it approaches\nVenus, Earth, and Mars at relatively close range.\n  Aims. Here, we investigate the orbital context of Miorita and search for\npossible dynamical analogs within the NEA population.\n  Methods. We studied the orbital evolution of Miorita using direct N-body\ncalculations. We used the NEOMOD 3 orbital distribution model to verify our\nconclusions. Observational data were obtained with INT's Wide Field Camera.\n  Results. Miorita is subjected to a von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai secular resonance,\nbut it is also in a near apsidal resonance, both controlled by Jupiter. We\nidentified a group of dynamical analogs of Miorita that includes 387668 (2002\nSZ), 2004 US1 , 299582 (2006 GQ2), and 2018 AC4.

Concurrent secular resonances tend to stabilize the orbits of\nthese asteroids as they are protected against collision with Earth and other\ninner planets by the resonances.

    "abstract": "While stellar metallicity has long been known to correlate with planetary\nproperties, the galactic metallicity gradient alone does not account for the\ntrend. It is therefore possible that there exists some time-dependent component\nto planet occurrence in the Milky Way over Gyr timescales, driven by something\nother than the metal enrichment of the ISM. In this paper, we investigate the\nobservable effect of a time-dependent planet occurrence rate upon a Kepler-like\nsample of stars. Using a novel planetary system population synthesis code,\npsps, we impose several prescriptions for time-variable planet occurrence upon\nour sample. For this study, we employ a simplistic step function fiducial model\nfor Milky Way planet occurrence, where we vary the time of the step and the\nplanet occurrence rate before and after. We then forward model the expected\nyield for a synthetic Kepler mission as a function of galactic height,\nemploying the mission's footprint and sensitivity to transits. Finally, we\ncompare the modeled trends to the observed result from the mission itself. We\nfind that, broadly speaking, models in which planet occurrence increased by a\nfactor of several within the past few Gyr can reproduce the occurrence-galactic\nheight trend as-observed; this timing is broadly consistent with the galactic\nkinematic heating timescale. We consider how varying the functional form of our\nplanet occurrence prescription affects our conclusions. Finally, we consider\nthe physical implications of a seemingly recent increase in planet occurrence\non Gyr timescales, as part of a broader conversation about the galactic context\nfor planet formation.",

VLA 6 GHz continuum data reveal compact radio\nemission in SDSS J2258+2313, while SDSS J1448+1010 hosts small radio jets\nindicative of AGN activity. Both galaxies retain substantial molecular gas\nreservoirs in their central regions that appear more turbulent than 'normal'\nstar-forming galaxies, likely contributing to the observed low star formation\nrates in the hosts.

    "abstract": "Over the last few years, an increasing number of gamma-ray bursts (GRB) have\nbeen detected with very high energy (VHE) emission in excess of 100 GeV, with a\nfew cases above 1 TeV. In several instances, synchrotron seed photons do not\nfully explain the emission observed, suggesting the presence of other seed\nphoton sources to up-scatter. In this work, we consider the kilonova as a\nsource of seed photons for up-scattering in the afterglow. We model the\nkilonova as a thermal source injecting into the back of a GRB fireball, evolved\nusing a shell model, and with the electron and photon populations updated via a\nkinetic solver. We find that VHE emission from weaker afterglows, such as those\nfound in short GRBs, can be affected by such seed photons, with the kilonova\nseed photons mitigating the loss of synchrotron photons on the VHE emission\nwhen afterglow parameters are varied. We also find that VHE emission in\nstructured jets, due to weaker synchrotron emission at their wings, can also\nbenefit from this supply of seed photons, especially when viewed off-axis. We\napply this model to GRB 170817A, and show that its VHE emission is higher than\nexpected in previous models for the first 100 days, though still below the\ndetection threshold.",

In particular, introducing inelastic scattering\nresults in a more realistic hydrodynamization time. With or without number\nnon-conservation, we find that first-order hydrodynamics becomes applicable at\nthe same time that a unique ground state emerges in the dynamical evolution of\nthe one-particle distribution function. Furthermore, we find a set of\nlow-effective-energy attractor modes which evolve adiabatically long before\nhydrodynamization, and find that the emergence of a gap between these ground\nstate modes and the excited modes coincides with the time at which the system\nfalls onto an attractor surface. Strikingly, this is the case even in the\nabsence of pre-thermal scaling of the gluon distribution function, which has\npreviously been strongly associated with pre-thermal attractor behavior.\nFinally, motivated by a generic feature we observe in the spectrum, we show\nthat as the system hydrodynamizes, the rapid decoupling of non-hydrodynamic\nmodes in boost-invariant kinetic theory can be understood with the AH framework\nin a model-independent fashion.",

A cosmological interpretation of this signal\ncorresponds to absorption of 21 cm photons by neutral hydrogen at $z \\sim 17$.\nThe large depth of the signal has been shown to require an excess radio\nbackground above the CMB and/or non-standard cooling processes in the IGM.\nHere, we explore the plausibility of a scenario in which the EDGES signal is\nback-lit by an excess radio background sourced from a population of radio-loud\nAGN at high redshift. These AGN could also explain the unexpected abundance of\nUV-bright objects observed at $z > 10$ by JWST. We find that producing enough\nradio photons to explain the EDGES depth requires that nearly all high-$z$\nUV-bright objects down to $M_{\\mathrm{UV}} \\gtrsim -15$ are radio-loud AGN and\nthat the UV density of such objects declines by at most 1.5 orders of magnitude\nbetween $z = $10 and 20. In addition, the fraction of X-ray photons escaping\nthese objects must be $\\lesssim 1\\%$ of their expected intrinsic production\nrate to prevent the absorption signal being washed out by early IGM\npre-heating. Reproducing the sharp boundaries of the absorption trough and its\nflat bottom requires that the UV luminosity function, the fraction of UV light\nproduced by AGN, and the X-ray escape fraction have fine-tuned redshift\ndependence. We conclude that radio-loud AGN are an unlikely (although\nphysically possible) candidate to explain EDGES because of the extreme physical\nproperties required for them to do so.",

Their close proximity to host stars subjects them to intense stellar\nirradiation, driving high temperatures where hydride ions (H$^-$) significantly\ncontribute to opacity, potentially obscuring metal features in near-infrared\ntransmission spectra. We investigate the atmosphere of WASP-189b, targeting\natomic, ionic, and molecular species (H, He, Fe, Ti, V, Mn, Na, Mg, Ca, Cr, Ni,\nY, Ba, Sc, Fe$^+$, Ti$^+$, TiO, H$_2$O, CO, and OH), focusing on (i) the role\nof H$^-$ as a source of continuum opacity, and (ii) the relative hydride-to-Fe\nabundance using joint optical and near-infrared data. We present two transits\nof WASP-189b gathered simultaneously in the optical with HARPS and\nnear-infrared with NIRPS, supported by photometric light curves from EulerCam\nand ExTrA. Transmission spectra were analysed via cross-correlation to detect\nabsorption features and enhance the signal-to-noise ratio. Atmospheric\nretrievals quantified relative abundances by fitting overall metallicity and\nproxies for TiO, H$^-$, and e$^-$. Only atomic iron is detected in HARPS data\n(S/N ~5.5), but not in NIRPS, likely due to H$^-$ continuum dampening.\nRetrievals on HARPS-only and HARPS+NIRPS suggest the hydride-to-Fe ratio\nexceeds equilibrium predictions by about 0.5 dex, hinting at strong hydrogen\nionisation. Including NIRPS data helps constrain H$^-$ abundance and set an\nupper limit on free electron density, unconstrained in HARPS-only data. These\nresults emphasise H$^-$ as a significant continuum opacity source impeding\ndetection of planetary absorption features in WASP-189b's near-infrared\ntransmission spectrum.",

    "abstract": "The Wigner's Friend (WF) thought experiment concerns quantum measurements by\na 'superobserver' of an observer measuring a quantum system. Variations on the\nsetup and its extended versions have seen a resurgence in recent years, in\nlight of a series of no-go theorems that reveal new quantum effects and\nquestion the existence of absolute events. But most theoretical and\nexperimental studies of WF scenarios have restricted themselves to a 'friend'\ncomposed of a single qubit with idealised measurement settings in an idealised\nlab. In this work, we consider a specific, unitary model of the interaction\nbetween the Friend and the system in the presence of a decohering environment.\nIn particular, we study WF scenarios from the perspective of quantum Darwinism\n(QD). The QD framework is well-suited to studying the questions of observations\nand agents in quantum theory that WF scenarios raise, as it is concerned with\nhow observers record objective information about a system with access only to\nits surroundings. Here we describe how to add environments to simple and\nextended WF scenarios in the QD framework, and present numerical results that\nstudy the emergence of classicality, in the form of the Friend's measurement\nresult becoming more objective. In both the simple and extended cases, we also\nfind that the model and the environment obfuscate genuine WF effects and\nintroduce strong restrictions on them. However, we also find a novel form of WF\neffect that exploits coherence between the Friend and the environment.",

The classical-to-quantum correspondence is controlled by an\ninterpolation parameter, $a$, which is zero in the classical limit. Increasing\n$a$ introduces quantum uncertainty into the measurements, which is shown to\nimprove network performance at moderate values of the interpolation parameter.\nWe then focus on particular images that fail to be classified by a classical\nneural network but are detected correctly in the quantum network. For such\nborderline cases, we observe strong deviations from the simulated behavior. We\nattribute this to physical noise, which causes the output to fluctuate between\nnearby minima of the classification energy landscape. Such strong sensitivity\nto physical noise is absent for clear images. We further benchmark physical\nnoise by inserting additional single-qubit and two-qubit gate pairs into the\nneural network circuits.

Observations with RXTE have shown that the strongest\nX-ray variability appears in the transition from/to the flaring state. During\nthis transition, it has been proposed that two particular types of\nquasi-periodic oscillations might be connected with the ejection of the\nso-called ultra-relativistic flows. In this paper, we present an analysis of\nthe first NICER observations of Sco X-1 obtained during a multi-wavelenght\ncampaign conducted in February 2019, in order to characterise the properties of\nQPOs as the system evolves through its various accretion states. We compute a\nlight-curve and a Hardness-Intensity diagram to track the evolution of the\nsource spectral properties, while we investigate the X-ray time variability\nwith a Dynamical Power Density Spectrum. To trace the temporal evolution of\nQPOs, we segment the dataset into shorter, continuous intervals, and compute\nand fit the averaged PDS for each interval. Our analysis shows that the overall\nbehaviour of the source is consistent with the literature; strong QPOs around 6\nHz are detected on the normal branch, while transitions to/from the flaring\nbranch -- occurring over timescales of a few hundreds of seconds -- are\ncharacterised by rapid, weaker quasi-periodic variability reaching frequencies\nup to 15 Hz. Despite limited statistical significance, we also identify faint,\ntransient timing features above 20 Hz, occasionally coexisting with the\nprominent 6 Hz QPOs. Although tentative, the existence of these features in the\nNICER data is crucial for interpreting the simultaneous radio observations from\nthe same multi-wavelength campaign, potentially reinforcing the connection\nbetween the ejection of relativistic outflows and the accretion states in Sco\nX-1.",

A distinctive feature of\nthis model is the inclusion of both the pion and the scalar meson, which\nrespectively capture the effects of the current quark mass and gluonic quantum\ncontributions to the scale anomaly. By varying the mass of the scalar meson, we\nevaluate the sensitivity of the gluonic scale anomaly to the nucleon\nproperties.

Pal 5's leading and trailing arms stretch over 20 degrees on\nthe sky, making them sensitive probes of the Milky Way's mass distribution. In\nthis work, we search for red giant members of Pal 5 using spectroscopic data\nfrom APOGEE DR17 and photometric and astrometric data from Gaia DR3. Based on\nposition and proper motion, we identify eight members of Pal 5: six in the core\nand two in the stream. The clustering algorithm HDBSCAN finds these same eight.\nWe then use chemical tagging with APOGEE abundances to search for additional\nmembers across five APOGEE fields overlapping Pal 5. While several dozen\ncandidates are identified, most deviate (some significantly) from known\nkinematic and color-magnitude trends, suggesting that they are less likely to\nbe true members. We estimate the expected number of giants in the APOGEE\npointings based on the area and stellar mass of the streams. Given APOGEE's\nlimiting magnitude, we find that few, if any, new giants are expected,\nespecially if the stream is more diffuse at these locations. Our results\nsupport the presence of density variations in Pal 5's tidal streams, consistent\nwith earlier studies attributing such features to baryonic perturbers in the\nMilky Way, dark matter subhaloes, or interactions with passing globular\nclusters.",

Using analytics as well as Monte Carlo simulations, we show\nthat there exists a universal black hole regime where the eigenvalue densities\nare given by parabolas and the correlation functions of probes in these\nbackgrounds are completely determined by a few parameters. An important feature\nof strong coupling in this model is that the matrices commute and one can\ndefine joint eigenvalue distributions which also exhibit universality. These\ntwo results extend the beautiful findings of Berenstein, Hanada and Hartnoll.\nNot all heavy operators are universal and at strong coupling there is a sharp\nphase boundary between the universal and non universal regimes.

We find that lattice anomalies reproduce the\nexpected properties of QFT anomalies in many ways, but also have crucial\ndifferences. In particular, lattice anomalies and QFT anomalies are not,\ncontrary to a common expectation, in one-to-one correspondence, and there can\nbe non-trivial anomalies on the lattice that are infrared (IR) trivial: they\nadmit symmetric trivial gapped ground states, and map to trivial QFT anomalies\nat low energies. Nevertheless, we show that lattice anomalies (including\nIR-trivial ones) have a number of interesting consequences in their own right,\nincluding connections to commuting projector models, phases of many-body\nlocalized (MBL) systems, and quantum cellular automata (QCA). We make\nsubstantial progress on the classification of lattice anomalies and develop\nseveral theoretical tools to characterize their consequences on symmetric\nHamiltonians.

In this\npaper, we argue that the shared representation space, where task interactions\nnaturally occur, offers rich information and potential for operations\ncomplementary to existing optimizers, especially for facilitating the\ninter-task complementarity, which is rarely explored in MTO. This intuition\nleads to Rep-MTL, which exploits the representation-level task saliency to\nquantify interactions between task-specific optimization and shared\nrepresentation learning. By steering these saliencies through entropy-based\npenalization and sample-wise cross-task alignment, Rep-MTL aims to mitigate\nnegative transfer by maintaining the effective training of individual tasks\ninstead pure conflict-solving, while explicitly promoting complementary\ninformation sharing. Experiments are conducted on four challenging MTL\nbenchmarks covering both task-shift and domain-shift scenarios. The results\nshow that Rep-MTL, even paired with the basic equal weighting policy, achieves\ncompetitive performance gains with favorable efficiency.

    "abstract": "The emergence of AI agents powered by large language models (LLMs) marks a\npivotal shift toward the Agentic Web, a new phase of the internet defined by\nautonomous, goal-driven interactions. In this paradigm, agents interact\ndirectly with one another to plan, coordinate, and execute complex tasks on\nbehalf of users. This transition from human-driven to machine-to-machine\ninteraction allows intent to be delegated, relieving users from routine digital\noperations and enabling a more interactive, automated web experience. In this\npaper, we present a structured framework for understanding and building the\nAgentic Web. We trace its evolution from the PC and Mobile Web eras and\nidentify the core technological foundations that support this shift. Central to\nour framework is a conceptual model consisting of three key dimensions:\nintelligence, interaction, and economics. These dimensions collectively enable\nthe capabilities of AI agents, such as retrieval, recommendation, planning, and\ncollaboration. We analyze the architectural and infrastructural challenges\ninvolved in creating scalable agentic systems, including communication\nprotocols, orchestration strategies, and emerging paradigms such as the Agent\nAttention Economy. We conclude by discussing the potential applications,\nsocietal risks, and governance issues posed by agentic systems, and outline\nresearch directions for developing open, secure, and intelligent ecosystems\nshaped by both human intent and autonomous agent behavior.

However, MI-EEG\ndecoding remains challenging due to substantial inter-subject variability and\nlimited labeled target data, which necessitate costly calibration for new\nusers. Many existing multi-source domain adaptation (MSDA) methods\nindiscriminately incorporate all available source domains, disregarding the\nlarge inter-subject differences in EEG signals, which leads to negative\ntransfer and excessive computational costs. Moreover, while many approaches\nfocus on feature distribution alignment, they often neglect the explicit\ndependence between features and decision-level outputs, limiting their ability\nto preserve discriminative structures. To address these gaps, we propose a\nnovel MSDA framework that leverages a pretrained large Brain Foundation Model\n(BFM) for dynamic and informed source subject selection, ensuring only relevant\nsources contribute to adaptation. Furthermore, we employ Cauchy-Schwarz (CS)\nand Conditional CS (CCS) divergences to jointly perform feature-level and\ndecision-level alignment, enhancing domain invariance while maintaining class\ndiscriminability. Extensive evaluations on two benchmark MI-EEG datasets\ndemonstrate that our framework outperforms a broad range of state-of-the-art\nbaselines. Additional experiments with a large source pool validate the\nscalability and efficiency of BFM-guided selection, which significantly reduces\ntraining time without sacrificing performance.",

We show that tilt\ncorrection and summation of the symmetric and antisymmetric scattering\ncomponents within the bright-field disk -- corresponding to tilt-corrected\nbright field (tcBF) and tilt-corrected differential phase contrast (tcDPC)\nrespectively -- enables aberration-corrected, bright-field phase contrast\nimaging (acBF) that makes maximal use of the 4D-STEM information under the weak\nphase object approximation (WPOA). Beyond the WPOA, we identify the contrast\ntransfer from the interference between inelastic/plural scattering electrons,\nwhich show up as quadratic terms, and show that under overfocus conditions,\ncontrast can be further enhanced at selected frequencies, similar to\nphase-contrast TEM imaging. There is also usable information encoded in the\ndark field region which we demonstrate by constructing a tilt-corrected\ndark-field image (tcDF) that sums up the incoherent scattering components and\nholds promise for depth sectioning of strong scatterers.

The list of problems we tackle\nincludes propagation of a free wave packet, vibration of a harmonic oscillator,\nand tunneling through a barrier. Each of these problems starts with the initial\nwave packet setup. Although Qiskit provides a general method for initializing\nwavefunctions, in most cases it generates deep quantum circuits. While these\ncircuits perform well on noiseless simulators, they suffer from excessive noise\non quantum hardware. To overcome this issue, we designed a shallower quantum\ncircuit for preparing a Gaussian-like initial wave packet, which improves the\nperformance on real hardware. Next, quantum circuits are implemented to apply\nthe kinetic and potential energy operators for the evolution of a wavefunction\nover time. The results of our modelling on classical emulators of quantum\nhardware agree perfectly with the results obtained using the traditional\n(classical) methods. This serves as a benchmark and demonstrates that the\nquantum algorithms and Qiskit codes we developed are accurate. However, the\nresults obtained on the actual quantum hardware available today, such as IBM's\nsuperconducting qubits and IonQ's trapped ions, indicate large discrepancies\ndue to hardware limitations. This work highlights both the potential and\nchallenges of using quantum computers to solve fundamental quantum molecular\ndynamics problems.",

To address these challenges, we propose\nMAJ-EVAL, a Multi-Agent-as-Judge evaluation framework that can automatically\nconstruct multiple evaluator personas with distinct dimensions from relevant\ntext documents (e.g., research papers), instantiate LLM agents with the\npersonas, and engage in-group debates with multi-agents to Generate\nmulti-dimensional feedback.

    "abstract": "Understanding the dynamic adsorption of colloidal particles at fluid\ninterfaces is essential for applications ranging from emulsion stabilization to\ninterfacial assembly of functional materials. Adsorption dynamics is often\ndescribed through diffusion-limited models (such as the Ward-Tordai framework)\nalong with assuming dynamic equilibrium between the adsorbed and dispersed\nparticles. However, most experiments show that particle adsorption is\nirreversible, and diffusion-limited models fail as the surface coverage goes\nbeyond the dilute limit where particle crowding limits further adsorption.\nHere, we present a unified model that captures the transition from\ndiffusion-limited to kinetic-limited regimes by coupling diffusion with a\nRandom Sequential Adsorption (RSA)-based boundary condition that accounts for\nirreversible adsorption and particle blocking for a spherical droplet. Using\nboth a microtensiometer and pendant drop tensiometry, we measure dynamic\ninterfacial tension changes for 3-(Trimethoxysilyl)propyl methacrylate (TPM)\nparticles at the toluene/water interface across a range of bulk concentrations,\ndrop sizes, and particle functionalization. Our analysis shows that the\nadsorption flux becomes increasingly hindered as the surface area fills, in\nagreement with RSA predictions. Furthermore, we calculate the Thiele modulus as\na dimensionless number that quantifies the relative importance of adsorption\nkinetics to diffusion. We find that above a critical surface coverage,\nadsorption becomes reaction-limited, marking a transition to kinetically\ncontrolled dynamics. This approach provides a predictive framework for particle\nadsorption at fluid interfaces and highlights the necessity of moving beyond\nequilibrium diffusion-limited models.",

Although FMA has\ndemonstrated strong optimization performance across various applications, its\nperformance often stagnates as the number of optimization iterations increases.\nOne contributing factor to this stagnation is the growing number of data points\nin the dataset used to train FM. It is hypothesized that as more data points\nare accumulated, the contribution of newly added data points becomes diluted\nwithin the entire dataset, thereby reducing their impact on improving the\nprediction accuracy of FM. To address this issue, we propose a novel method for\nsequential dataset construction that retains at most a specified number of the\nmost recently added data points.

Among the methods compared, a GNN combining structural connectivity\n(SC) and functional connectivity (FC) consistently achieved the highest\nperformance across all fMRI modalities; however, its advantage over KRR using\nFC alone was not statistically significant. The TGNN, designed to model\ntemporal dynamics with SC as a prior, performed competitively with FC-based\napproaches for task-fMRI but struggled with RS data, where its performance\naligned with the lower-performing GNN that directly used fMRI time-series data\nas node features. These findings emphasize the importance of selecting\nappropriate model architectures and feature representations to fully leverage\nthe spatial and temporal richness of neuroimaging data.\n  This study highlights the potential of multimodal graph-aware DL models to\ncombine SC and FC for cognitive prediction, as well as the promise of\nTransformer-based approaches for capturing temporal dynamics. By providing a\ncomprehensive comparison of models, this work serves as a guide for advancing\nbrain-behavior modeling using fMRI, SC and DL.",

    "abstract": "Current facial emotion recognition systems are predominately trained to\npredict a fixed set of predefined categories or abstract dimensional values.\nThis constrained form of supervision hinders generalization and applicability,\nas it reduces the rich and nuanced spectrum of emotions into oversimplified\nlabels or scales. In contrast, natural language provides a more flexible,\nexpressive, and interpretable way to represent emotions, offering a much\nbroader source of supervision. Yet, leveraging semantically rich natural\nlanguage captions as supervisory signals for facial emotion representation\nlearning remains relatively underexplored, primarily due to two key challenges:\n1) the lack of large-scale caption datasets with rich emotional semantics, and\n2) the absence of effective frameworks tailored to harness such rich\nsupervision. To this end, we introduce EmoCap100K, a large-scale facial emotion\ncaption dataset comprising over 100,000 samples, featuring rich and structured\nsemantic descriptions that capture both global affective states and\nfine-grained local facial behaviors. Building upon this dataset, we further\npropose EmoCapCLIP, which incorporates a joint global-local contrastive\nlearning framework enhanced by a cross-modal guided positive mining module.\nThis design facilitates the comprehensive exploitation of multi-level caption\ninformation while accommodating semantic similarities between closely related\nexpressions. Extensive evaluations on over 20 benchmarks covering five tasks\ndemonstrate the superior performance of our method, highlighting the promise of\nlearning facial emotion representations from large-scale semantically rich\ncaptions.

    "abstract": "Modern large language models excel in knowledge-intensive tasks, yet how\ntransformers acquire (store) knowledge during pre-training and extract\n(retrieve) it during post-fine-tuning inference remains theoretically opaque.\nWhile prior theoretical work has begun to investigate these questions through\nthe analysis of training dynamics, such studies are limited to single-layer,\nattention-only architectures. However, most existing studies suggest that MLPs\nare the most contributing components for storing knowledge in transformer-based\nlanguage models. Meanwhile, our empirical investigations reveal that such\nsimplified models, when trained using standard next-token prediction\nobjectives, may be incapable of acquiring or extracting factual knowledge. To\novercome this limitation, we introduce a tractable one-layer transformer\nframework that crucially incorporates both self-attention and MLP modules. By\ntracking its gradient dynamics, we establish convergence and generalization\nguarantees that illuminate the ability of knowledge acquisition and extraction.\nWe prove that 1) Transformers can achieve near-optimal training loss during\npre-training, signifying effective knowledge acquisition; 2) With a large\nfine-tuning dataset and specific data multiplicity conditions met, transformers\ncan achieve low generalization error when tested on factual knowledge learned\nduring pre-training but not reinforced during the fine-tuning, indicating\nsuccessful knowledge extraction; 3) When the conditions are not satisfied,\ntransformers exhibit high generalization loss, resulting in hallucinations. Our\nanalysis includes both full fine-tuning and low-rank fine-tuning.

The observations can be well\nexplained by a photo-ionized nebula with a low ionization parameter. It is\ngenerally thought that the source of ionization (and heating) of the WIM is due\nto Lyman continuum leaking from HII regions which are concentrated in the\nGalactic plane. The rays of the diffuse Galactic Lyman-continuum radiation\nfield incident on the Warm Neutral Medium (WNM) are absorbed, forming an\nionized skin.

Domgorgen\n& Mathis (1994) recognized the value of [OI] 6300 as a diagnostic of the\nfraction of the diffuse continuum that is absorbed by the WNM and therefore\nconstrains the fraction of the diffuse Lyman continuum that escapes to the\nhalo. Unfortunately, observations of Galactic [OI] 6300 have been stymied by\nbright [OI] 6300 airglow emission. [NI] 5200,5198 has been a historically less\npopular probe because this doublet is less luminous than the oxygen doublet.\nHowever, we point out that the [NI] airglow is two orders of magnitude smaller\nthan that of [OI]. Furthermore, even in the presence of comparable airglow, the\nWIM [NI] emission can be inferred using the doublet intensity ratio for which a\nmedium-resolution spectrometer such as the Local Volume Mapper will suffice.\nSeparately, we note, in extragalactic systems, that [OI]6300/[NI]5200 is a\nrobust measure of the O/N abundance ratio.",

In particular, we propose strategies based on a good\nisolation of $\\gamma \\gamma$ and b-jet pairs, and focus specially on specific\nvariables like $\\eta_{\\gamma \\gamma}$ and $P^T_{\\gamma \\gamma}$ where the\nsignal events distributions may discriminate efficiently between BSM signal\nversus SM background. We will show here how the high transversality of these\ntwo pairs in the signal (inherited from the high transversality of the $H$'s)\nis correlated with the non-vanishing value of this $(\\kappa_V^2-\\kappa_{2V})$\ncombination.",

We challenge this paradigm with SmallThinker, a family of LLMs\nnatively designed - not adapted - for the unique constraints of local devices:\nweak computational power, limited memory, and slow storage. Unlike traditional\napproaches that mainly compress existing models built for clouds, we architect\nSmallThinker from the ground up to thrive within these limitations. Our\ninnovation lies in a deployment-aware architecture that transforms constraints\ninto design principles. First, We introduce a two-level sparse structure\ncombining fine-grained Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) with sparse feed-forward\nnetworks, drastically reducing computational demands without sacrificing model\ncapacity. Second, to conquer the I/O bottleneck of slow storage, we design a\npre-attention router that enables our co-designed inference engine to prefetch\nexpert parameters from storage while computing attention, effectively hiding\nstorage latency that would otherwise cripple on-device inference. Third, for\nmemory efficiency, we utilize NoPE-RoPE hybrid sparse attention mechanism to\nslash KV cache requirements. We release SmallThinker-4B-A0.6B and\nSmallThinker-21B-A3B, which achieve state-of-the-art performance scores and\neven outperform larger LLMs. Remarkably, our co-designed system mostly\neliminates the need for expensive GPU hardware: with Q4_0 quantization, both\nmodels exceed 20 tokens/s on ordinary consumer CPUs, while consuming only 1GB\nand 8GB of memory respectively.

If LLMs merely regurgitate memorized fixes, both small and large\nlocalization errors should yield the same number of correct patches, because\nany offset should divert the model from the original fix.\n  Method: Our pipeline repairs vulnerabilities from the Vul4J and VJTrans\nbenchmarks after shifting the fault location by n lines from the ground truth.\nA first LLM generates a patch, a second LLM reviews it, and we validate the\nresult with regression and proof-of-vulnerability tests.

    "abstract": "The ability of the network digital twin (NDT) to remain aware of changes in\nits physical counterpart, known as the physical twin (PTwin), is a fundamental\ncondition to enable timely synchronization, also referred to as twinning. In\nthis way, considering a transport network, a key requirement is to handle\nunexpected traffic variability and dynamically adapt to maintain optimal\nperformance in the associated virtual model, known as the virtual twin (VTwin).\nIn this context, we propose a self-adaptive implementation of a novel NDT\narchitecture designed to provide accurate delay predictions, even under\nfluctuating traffic conditions. This architecture addresses an essential\nchallenge, underexplored in the literature: improving the resilience of\ndata-driven NDT platforms against traffic variability and improving\nsynchronization between the VTwin and its physical counterpart. Therefore, the\ncontributions of this article rely on NDT lifecycle by focusing on the\noperational phase, where telemetry modules are used to monitor incoming\ntraffic, and concept drift detection techniques guide retraining decisions\naimed at updating and redeploying the VTwin when necessary. We validate our\narchitecture with a network management use case, across various emulated\nnetwork topologies, and diverse traffic patterns to demonstrate its\neffectiveness in preserving acceptable performance and predicting per-flow\ndelay under unexpected traffic variation. The results in all tested topologies,\nusing the normalized mean square error as the evaluation metric, demonstrate\nthat our proposed architecture, after a traffic concept drift, achieves a\nperformance improvement in prediction of at least 56.7% compared to a\nconfiguration without NDT synchronization.",

Our\nframework replaces a single opaque reward with five *structurally separate*\nutility heads -- deference, switch-access preservation, truthfulness,\nlow-impact behavior via a belief-based extension of Attainable Utility\nPreservation, and bounded task reward -- combined lexicographically by strict\nweight gaps. Theorem 1 proves exact single-round corrigibility in the partially\nobservable off-switch game; Theorem 3 extends the guarantee to multi-step,\nself-spawning agents, showing that even if each head is \\emph{learned} to\nmean-squared error $\\varepsilon$ and the planner is $\\varepsilon$-sub-optimal,\nthe probability of violating \\emph{any} safety property is bounded while still\nensuring net human benefit.

    "abstract": "In finance, Large Language Models (LLMs) face frequent knowledge conflicts\ndue to discrepancies between pre-trained parametric knowledge and real-time\nmarket data. These conflicts become particularly problematic when LLMs are\ndeployed in real-world investment services, where misalignment between a\nmodel's embedded preferences and those of the financial institution can lead to\nunreliable recommendations. Yet little research has examined what investment\nviews LLMs actually hold. We propose an experimental framework to investigate\nsuch conflicts, offering the first quantitative analysis of confirmation bias\nin LLM-based investment analysis. Using hypothetical scenarios with balanced\nand imbalanced arguments, we extract the latent preferences of models and\nmeasure their persistence. Focusing on sector, size, and momentum, our analysis\nreveals distinct, model-specific tendencies. In particular, we observe a\nconsistent preference for large-cap stocks and contrarian strategies across\nmost models. These preferences often harden into confirmation bias, with models\nclinging to initial judgments despite counter-evidence.",

To address this, we propose a novel 3D perception pipeline\ntailored for flower-harvesting robots, focusing on sparse 3D localization of\nrose centers. Our two-stage algorithm first performs 2D point-based detection\non stereo images, followed by depth estimation using a lightweight deep neural\nnetwork. To overcome the challenge of scarce real-world labeled data, we\nintroduce a photorealistic synthetic dataset generated via Blender, simulating\na dynamic rose farm environment with precise 3D annotations. This approach\nminimizes manual labeling costs while enabling robust model training. We\nevaluate two depth estimation paradigms: a traditional triangulation-based\nmethod and our proposed deep learning framework. Results demonstrate the\nsuperiority of our method, achieving an F1 score of 95.6% (synthetic) and 74.4%\n(real) in 2D detection, with a depth estimation error of 3% at a 2-meter range\non synthetic data.

Recent state-of-the-art\nmethods are based on inpainting, meaning that the lower half of the input face\nis masked, and the model fills the masked region by generating lips aligned\nwith the given audio. Hence, to preserve identity-related visual details from\nthe lower half, these approaches additionally require an unmasked identity\nreference image randomly selected from the same video. However, this common\nmasking strategy suffers from (1) information loss in the input faces,\nsignificantly affecting the networks' ability to preserve visual quality and\nidentity details, (2) variation between identity reference and input image\ndegrading reconstruction performance, and (3) the identity reference negatively\nimpacting the model, causing unintended copying of elements unaligned with the\naudio. To address these issues, we propose a mask-free talking face generation\napproach while maintaining the 2D-based face editing task. Instead of masking\nthe lower half, we transform the input images to have closed mouths, using a\ntwo-step landmark-based approach trained in an unpaired manner. Subsequently,\nwe provide these edited but unmasked faces to a lip adaptation model alongside\nthe audio to generate appropriate lip movements.

    "abstract": "Health surveys provide valuable information for monitoring population health,\nidentifying risk factors and informing public health policies. Most of the\nquestions included are coded as ordinal variables and organized into thematic\nblocks. Accordingly, multivariate modeling provides a natural framework for\nconsidering these variables as true groups, thereby accounting for potential\ndependencies among the responses within each block. In this paper, we propose a\nmultivariate spatial analysis of ordinal survey-based data. This multivariate\napproach enables the joint analysis of sets of ordinal responses that are\nlikely to be correlated, accounting for individual-level effects, while\nsimultaneously improving the estimation of the geographical patterns for each\nvariable and capturing their interdependencies. We apply this methodology to\ndescribe the spatial distribution of several mental health indicators from the\nHealth Survey of the Region of Valencia (Spain) for the year 2022.\nSpecifically, we analyze the block of questions from the 12-item General Health\nQuestionnaire included in the survey.",

    "abstract": "Objective: The study examined the effects of varying all three core elements\nof cognitive load on learning efficiency during a shape assembly task in\nvirtual reality (VR).\n  Background: Adaptive training systems aim to improve learning efficiency and\nretention by dynamically adjusting difficulty. However, design choices can\nimpact the cognitive workload imposed on the learner. The present experiments\nexamined how aspects of cognitive load impact training outcomes.\n  Method: Participants learned step-by-step shape assembly in a VR environment.\nCognitive load was manipulated across three dimensions: Intrinsic Load (shape\ncomplexity), Extraneous Load (instruction verbosity), and Germane Load\n(adaptive vs. fixed training). In adaptive training (experiment 1), difficulty\nincreased based on individual performance. In fixed training (experiment 2),\ndifficulty followed a preset schedule from a yoked participant.\n  Results: Higher Intrinsic Load significantly increased training times and\nsubjective workload but did not affect retention test accuracy. Extraneous Load\nmodestly impacted training time, with little impact on workload or retention.\nAdaptive training shortened overall training time without increasing workload\nor impairing retention. No interactions were observed between the three types\nof load. Conclusion: Both Intrinsic and Extraneous Load increased training\ntime, but adaptive training improved efficiency without harming retention. The\nlack of interaction between the elements suggests training benefits can be\nworth seeking within any of the components of cognitive load. Application:\nThese findings support the use of VR adaptive systems in domains such as\nmanufacturing and military service, where efficient assembly skill acquisition\nis critical. Tailoring difficulty in real-time can optimize efficiency without\ncompromising learning.",

    "abstract": "Multistatic integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) systems, which use\ndistributed transmitters and receivers, offer enhanced spatial coverage and\nsensing accuracy compared to stand-alone ISAC configurations. However, these\nsystems face challenges due to interference between co-existing ISAC nodes,\nespecially during simultaneous operation. In this paper, we analyze the impact\nof this mutual interference arising from the co-existence in a multistatic ISAC\nscenario, where a mono- and a bistatic ISAC system share the same spectral\nresources. We first classify differenct types of interference in the power\ndomain. Then, we discuss how the interference can affect both sensing and\ncommunications in terms of bit error rate (BER), error vector magnitude (EVM),\nand radar image under varied transmit power and RCS configurations through\nsimulations. Along with interfernce analysis, we propose a low-complexity\nsuccessive interference cancellation method that adaptively cancels either the\nmonostatic reflection or the bistatic line-of-sight signal based on a\nmonostatic radar image signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). The\nproposed framework is evaluated with both simulations and proof-of-concept\nmeasurements using an ISAC testbed with a radar echo generator for object\nemulation. The results have shown that the proposed method reduces BER and\nimproves EVM as well as radar image SINR across a wide range of SINR\nconditions. These results demonstrate that accurate component-wise cancellation\ncan be achieved with low computational overhead, making the method suitable for\npractical applications.",

    "abstract": "While achieving exact conditional coverage in conformal prediction is\nunattainable without making strong, untestable regularity assumptions, the\npromise of conformal prediction hinges on finding approximations to conditional\nguarantees that are realizable in practice. A promising direction for obtaining\nconditional dependence for conformal sets--in particular capturing\nheteroskedasticity--is through estimating the conditional density\n$\\mathbb{P}_{Y|X}$ and conformalizing its level sets. Previous work in this\nvein has focused on nonconformity scores based on the empirical cumulative\ndistribution function (CDF). Such scores are, however, computationally costly,\ntypically requiring expensive sampling methods. To avoid the need for sampling,\nwe observe that the CDF-based score reduces to a Mahalanobis distance in the\ncase of Gaussian scores, yielding a closed-form expression that can be directly\nconformalized. Moreover, the use of a Gaussian-based score opens the door to a\nnumber of extensions of the basic conformal method; in particular, we show how\nto construct conformal sets with missing output values, refine conformal sets\nas partial information about $Y$ becomes available, and construct conformal\nsets on transformations of the output space. Finally, empirical results\nindicate that our approach produces conformal sets that more closely\napproximate conditional coverage in multivariate settings compared to\nalternative methods.",

Understanding real-world shorts is actually challenging due\nto their complex visual elements, high information density in both visuals and\naudio, and fast pacing that focuses on emotional expression and viewpoint\ndelivery. This requires advanced reasoning to effectively integrate multimodal\ninformation, including visual, audio, and text. In this work, we introduce\nARC-Hunyuan-Video, a multimodal model that processes visual, audio, and textual\nsignals from raw video inputs end-to-end for structured comprehension. The\nmodel is capable of multi-granularity timestamped video captioning and\nsummarization, open-ended video question answering, temporal video grounding,\nand video reasoning. Leveraging high-quality data from an automated annotation\npipeline, our compact 7B-parameter model is trained through a comprehensive\nregimen: pre-training, instruction fine-tuning, cold start, reinforcement\nlearning (RL) post-training, and final instruction fine-tuning. Quantitative\nevaluations on our introduced benchmark ShortVid-Bench and qualitative\ncomparisons demonstrate its strong performance in real-world video\ncomprehension, and it supports zero-shot or fine-tuning with a few samples for\ndiverse downstream applications. The real-world production deployment of our\nmodel has yielded tangible and measurable improvements in user engagement and\nsatisfaction, a success supported by its remarkable efficiency, with stress\ntests indicating an inference time of just 10 seconds for a one-minute video on\nH20 GPU.",

    "abstract": "We investigate a very recent concept for visualizing various aspects of a\ngraph in the plane using a collection of drawings introduced by Hlin\\v{e}n\\'y\nand Masa\\v{r}\\'ik [GD 2023]. Formally, given a graph $G$, we aim to find an\nuncrossed collection containing drawings of $G$ in the plane such that each\nedge of $G$ is not crossed in at least one drawing in the collection. The\nuncrossed number of $G$ ($unc(G)$) is the smallest integer $k$ such that an\nuncrossed collection for $G$ of size $k$ exists. The uncrossed number is\nlower-bounded by the well-known thickness, which is an edge-decomposition of\n$G$ into planar graphs. This connection gives a trivial lower-bound\n$\\lceil\\frac{|E(G)|}{3|V(G)|-6}\\rceil \\le unc(G)$. In a recent paper, Balko,\nHlin\\v{e}n\\'y, Masa\\v{r}\\'ik, Orthaber, Vogtenhuber, and Wagner [GD 2024]\npresented the first non-trivial and general lower-bound on the uncrossed\nnumber. We summarize it in terms of dense graphs (where\n$|E(G)|=\\epsilon(|V(G)|)^2$ for some $\\epsilon>0$):\n$\\lceil\\frac{|E(G)|}{c_\\epsilon|V(G)|}\\rceil \\le unc(G)$, where $c_\\epsilon\\ge\n2.82$ is a constant depending on $\\epsilon$.\n  We improve the lower-bound to state that\n$\\lceil\\frac{|E(G)|}{3|V(G)|-6-\\sqrt{2|E(G)|}+\\sqrt{6(|V(G)|-2)}}\\rceil \\le\nunc(G)$. Translated to dense graphs regime, the bound yields a multiplicative\nconstant $c'_\\epsilon=3-\\sqrt{(2-\\epsilon)}$ in the expression\n$\\lceil\\frac{|E(G)|}{c'_\\epsilon|V(G)|+o(|V(G)|)}\\rceil \\le unc(G)$. Hence, it\nis tight (up to low-order terms) for $\\epsilon \\approx \\frac{1}{2}$ as\nwarranted by complete graphs.\n  In fact, we formulate our result in the language of the maximum uncrossed\nsubgraph number, that is, the maximum number of edges of $G$ that are not\ncrossed in a drawing of $G$ in the plane. In that case, we also provide a\nconstruction certifying that our bound is asymptotically tight (up to low-order\nterms) on dense graphs for all $\\epsilon>0$.",

    "abstract": "Attribute-based document image retrieval (ABDIR) was recently proposed as an\nalternative to query-by-example (QBE) searches, the dominant document image\nretrieval (DIR) paradigm. One drawback of QBE searches is that they require\nsample query documents on hand that may not be available. ABDIR aims to offer\nusers a flexible way to retrieve document images based on memorable visual\nfeatures of document contents, describing document images with combinations of\nvisual attributes determined via convolutional neural network (CNN)-based\nbinary classifiers. We present an exploratory study of the use of generative AI\nto bridge the gap between QBE and ABDIR, focusing on historical documents as a\nuse case for their diversity and uniqueness in visual features. We hypothesize\nthat text-to-image (T2I) generation can be leveraged to create query document\nimages using text prompts based on ABDIR-like attributes. We propose T2I-QBE,\nwhich uses Leonardo.Ai as the T2I generator with prompts that include a rough\ndescription of the desired document type and a list of the desired ABDIR-style\nattributes. This creates query images that are then used within the traditional\nQBE paradigm, which compares CNN-extracted query features to those of the\ndocument images in the dataset to retrieve the most relevant documents.\nExperiments on the HisIR19 dataset of historical documents confirm our\nhypothesis and suggest that T2I-QBE is a viable option for historical document\nimage retrieval.

    "abstract": "Within the continuous endeavour of improving the efficiency and resilience of\nair transport, the trend of using concepts and metrics from statistical physics\nhas recently gained momentum. This scientific discipline, which integrates\nelements from physics and statistics, aims at extracting knowledge about the\nmicroscale rules governing a (potentially complex) system when only its\nmacroscale is observable. Translated to air transport, this entails extracting\ninformation about how individual operations are managed, by only studying\ncoarse-grained information, e.g. average delays. We here review some\nfundamental concepts of statistical physics, and explore how these have been\napplied to the analysis of time series representing different aspects of the\nair transport system. In order to overcome the abstractness and complexity of\nsome of these concepts, intuitive definitions and explanations are provided\nwhenever possible. We further conclude by discussing the main obstacles towards\na more widespread adoption of statistical physics in air transport, and sketch\ntopics that we believe may be relevant in the future.",

To\nhelp address this issue, the fifth Sexism Identification in Social Networks\n(EXIST) challenge is initiated at CLEF 2025. Among this year's international\nbenchmarks, we concentrate on solving the first task aiming to identify and\nclassify sexism in social media textual posts. In this paper, we describe our\nsolutions and report results for three subtasks: Subtask 1.1 - Sexism\nIdentification in Tweets, Subtask 1.2 - Source Intention in Tweets, and Subtask\n1.3 - Sexism Categorization in Tweets. We implement three models to address\neach subtask which constitute three individual runs: Speech Concept Bottleneck\nModel (SCBM), Speech Concept Bottleneck Model with Transformer (SCBMT), and a\nfine-tuned XLM-RoBERTa transformer model. SCBM uses descriptive adjectives as\nhuman-interpretable bottleneck concepts. SCBM leverages large language models\n(LLMs) to encode input texts into a human-interpretable representation of\nadjectives, then used to train a lightweight classifier for downstream tasks.\nSCBMT extends SCBM by fusing adjective-based representation with contextual\nembeddings from transformers to balance interpretability and classification\nperformance. Beyond competitive results, these two models offer fine-grained\nexplanations at both instance (local) and class (global) levels. We also\ninvestigate how additional metadata, e.g., annotators' demographic profiles,\ncan be leveraged. For Subtask 1.1, XLM-RoBERTa, fine-tuned on provided data\naugmented with prior datasets, ranks 6th for English and Spanish and 4th for\nEnglish in the Soft-Soft evaluation.

Recently,\nintegration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into evolutionary computation has\nopened new avenues for automatic heuristic generation, using their advanced\nlanguage understanding and code synthesis capabilities.

Two sub-algorithms intelligently evaluate the geometry and optimal\ninjection point location. The first sub-algorithm generates a geometric matrix\nbased on a two-dimensional nodal quadrature adapted to the part's bounding box.\nThe second sub-algorithm projects the nodal matrix and associated circular\nareas orthogonally on the part's surface along the demolding direction. The\noptimal injection point location is determined by minimizing the distance to\nthe center of mass from the first algorithm's result. This novel methodology\nhas been validated through rheological simulations in six case studies with\ncomplex geometries. The results demonstrate uniform and homogeneous molten\nplastic distribution with minimal pressure loss during the filling phase.\nImportantly, this methodology does not require expert intervention, reducing\ntime and costs associated with manual injection mold feed system design.

Despite its progress in remote sensing\napplications, RIS in Low-Altitude Drone (LAD) scenarios remains underexplored.\nExisting datasets and methods are typically designed for high-altitude and\nstatic-view imagery. They struggle to handle the unique characteristics of LAD\nviews, such as diverse viewpoints and high object density. To fill this gap, we\npresent RIS-LAD, the first fine-grained RIS benchmark tailored for LAD\nscenarios. This dataset comprises 13,871 carefully annotated image-text-mask\ntriplets collected from realistic drone footage, with a focus on small,\ncluttered, and multi-viewpoint scenes. It highlights new challenges absent in\nprevious benchmarks, such as category drift caused by tiny objects and object\ndrift under crowded same-class objects. To tackle these issues, we propose the\nSemantic-Aware Adaptive Reasoning Network (SAARN). Rather than uniformly\ninjecting all linguistic features, SAARN decomposes and routes semantic\ninformation to different stages of the network. Specifically, the\nCategory-Dominated Linguistic Enhancement (CDLE) aligns visual features with\nobject categories during early encoding, while the Adaptive Reasoning Fusion\nModule (ARFM) dynamically selects semantic cues across scales to improve\nreasoning in complex scenes. The experimental evaluation reveals that RIS-LAD\npresents substantial challenges to state-of-the-art RIS algorithms, and also\ndemonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed model in addressing these\nchallenges.

Comparisons of\ndatasets obtained from different space missions on common targets represent in\nthis sense a way to explore the respective biases and reliability of the\nconsidered instruments, as well as a possibility to perform a more in-depth\ninvestigation of the properties of the observed stars. In this perspective, we\naim at using observations for the K2 mission to provide an external validation\nto Gaia rotation measurements, and confront observables available from Gaia,\nK2, and Kepler. We therefore crossmatch the Gaia rotation catalogue and the K2\nmission Ecliptic Plane Input Catalogue (EPIC) in order to find Gaia stars with\nboth measured rotation and periods and available K2 light curves. Using our\ncrossmatch, we analyse 1063 light curves from the K2 mission in order to\ncharacterise stellar rotational modulations and compare the recovered periods\nwith Gaia reference values. The K2/Gaia cross-validated sample is used as a\nrandom-forest classifier training set to identify a subsample of Gaia stars\nwith similar properties. We validate the Gaia rotation measurements for a large\nfraction of the sample and we discuss the possible origin of the discrepancies\nbetween some K2 and Gaia measurements. We note that the K2 sample does not\ninclude members of the low-activity ultra-fast-rotating (UFR) population that\nwas highlighted by Gaia observations, a feature that we explain considering the\ninstrumental capabilities of K2. Placing our sample in perspective with the\nfull Gaia rotation catalogues and Kepler observations, we show that the\npopulation for which both Gaia and K2 are able to measure rotation is composed\nof young late-type stars, a significant fraction of which is not yet converged\non the slow-rotator gyrochronological sequence.

    "abstract": "Ensuring reliable model performance across diverse domains is a critical\nchallenge in computational pathology. A particular source of variability in\nWhole-Slide Images is introduced by differences in digital scanners, thus\ncalling for better scanner generalization. This is critical for the real-world\nadoption of computational pathology, where the scanning devices may differ per\ninstitution or hospital, and the model should not be dependent on\nscanner-induced details, which can ultimately affect the patient's diagnosis\nand treatment planning. However, past efforts have primarily focused on\nstandard domain generalization settings, evaluating on unseen scanners during\ntraining, without directly evaluating consistency across scanners for the same\ntissue. To overcome this limitation, we introduce SCORPION, a new dataset\nexplicitly designed to evaluate model reliability under scanner variability.\nSCORPION includes 480 tissue samples, each scanned with 5 scanners, yielding\n2,400 spatially aligned patches. This scanner-paired design allows for the\nisolation of scanner-induced variability, enabling a rigorous evaluation of\nmodel consistency while controlling for differences in tissue composition.\nFurthermore, we propose SimCons, a flexible framework that combines\naugmentation-based domain generalization techniques with a consistency loss to\nexplicitly address scanner generalization. We empirically show that SimCons\nimproves model consistency on varying scanners without compromising\ntask-specific performance. By releasing the SCORPION dataset and proposing\nSimCons, we provide the research community with a crucial resource for\nevaluating and improving model consistency across diverse scanners, setting a\nnew standard for reliability testing.",

While widely adopted, it remains unclear\nwhether prompting with multiple examples is the most effective and efficient\nway to convey task information. In this work, we propose Soft Injection of task\nembeddings. The task embeddings are constructed only once using few-shot ICL\nprompts and repeatedly used during inference. Soft injection is performed by\nsoftly mixing task embeddings with attention head activations using\npre-optimized mixing parameters, referred to as soft head-selection parameters.\nThis method not only allows a desired task to be performed without in-prompt\ndemonstrations but also significantly outperforms existing ICL approaches while\nreducing memory usage and compute cost at inference time. An extensive\nevaluation is performed across 57 tasks and 12 LLMs, spanning four model\nfamilies of sizes from 4B to 70B. Averaged across 57 tasks, our method\noutperforms 10-shot ICL by 10.2%-14.3% across 12 LLMs. Additional analyses show\nthat our method also serves as an insightful tool for analyzing task-relevant\nroles of attention heads, revealing that task-relevant head positions selected\nby our method transfer across similar tasks but not across dissimilar ones --\nunderscoring the task-specific nature of head functionality. Our soft injection\nmethod opens a new paradigm for reducing prompt length and improving task\nperformance by shifting task conditioning from the prompt space to the\nactivation space.",

The utility of this system, when compared to other\nquantum optomechanical systems, is its extreme isolation from the environment\nand, by the relatively few degrees of freedom that a levitated object has.\nWhile work in the field has strongly focused on the three translational degrees\nof freedom of this system, it has become increasingly important to understand\nthe induced rotational motion of levitated objects, particularly in optical\ntrapping fields, but also in magnetic and electric traps. These additional\nthree degrees of freedom, which are intrinsic to levitated systems, offer a new\nset of optomechanical nonlinear interactions that lead to a rich and yet\nlargely unexplored roto-translational motion. The control and utilization of\nthese interactions promise to extend the utility of levitated optomechanics in\nboth fundamental studies and applications. In this review, we provide an\noverview of levitated optomechanics, before focusing on the roto-translational\nmotion of optically levitated anisotropic objects. We first present a classical\ntreatment of this induced motion, bridging the gap between classical and\nquantum formalisms. We describe the different types of roto-translational\nmotion for different particle shapes via their interaction with polarized\noptical trapping fields. Subsequently, we provide an overview of the\ntheoretical and experimental approaches as well as applications that have\nestablished this new field.

Here, we demonstrate that the color and transparency\nof materials can be direct manifestations of their underlying quantum geometry.\nTo illustrate this principle, we employ quadratic band-touching models that\nallow us to tune only the geometric properties of Bloch states, while keeping\nthe energy dispersion fixed. This decoupling reveals that modifying the\nwavefunction texture alone can lead to dramatic changes in the optical\nconductivity and, consequently, in the reflectance spectrum of the material.\nThis results in distinct and controllable changes in perceived color.\nSimilarly, we show that quantum geometry can govern the transparency of\ntwo-dimensional materials. Our findings demonstrate how quantum geometry shapes\nthe visual appearance of materials, opening new avenues for tailoring color and\ntransparency beyond traditional band structure design.

In even lower symmetry materials, such\nas monoclinic $\\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ (bGO), hyperbolic shear polaritons (HShPs)\nfurther enhance the directionality. Yet, HShPs are intrinsically supported only\nwithin narrow frequency ranges defined by the phonon frequencies of the host\nmaterial. Here, we report spectral tuning of HShPs in bGO by isotopic\nsubstitution. Employing near-field optical microscopy to image HShPs in\n$^{18}$O bGO films homo-epitaxially grown on a $^{16}$O bGO substrate, we\ndemonstrate a spectral redshift of $\\sim~40~$cm$^{-1}$ for the $^{18}$O bGO,\ncompared to $^{16}$O bGO. The technique allows for direct observation and a\nmodel-free estimation of the spectral shift driven by isotopic substitution\nwithout the need for knowledge of the dielectric tensor. Complementary\nfar-field measurements and ab initio calculations - in good agreement with the\nnear-field data - confirm the effectiveness of this estimation.

As symbiosis grows, AI\nsystems pose greater ethical risks, including harm to human rights and trust.\nEthical Risk Assessment (ERA) thus becomes crucial for guiding decisions that\nminimize such risks. However, ERA is hindered by uncertainty, vagueness, and\nincomplete information, and morality itself is context-dependent and imprecise.\nThis motivates the need for a flexible, transparent, yet robust framework for\nERA. Our work supports ethical decision-making by quantitatively assessing and\nprioritizing multiple ethical risks so that artificial agents can select\nactions aligned with human values and acceptable risk levels. We introduce\nff4ERA, a fuzzy framework that integrates Fuzzy Logic, the Fuzzy Analytic\nHierarchy Process (FAHP), and Certainty Factors (CF) to quantify ethical risks\nvia an Ethical Risk Score (ERS) for each risk type. The final ERS combines the\nFAHP-derived weight, propagated CF, and risk level. The framework offers a\nrobust mathematical approach for collaborative ERA modeling and systematic,\nstep-by-step analysis. A case study confirms that ff4ERA yields\ncontext-sensitive, ethically meaningful risk scores reflecting both expert\ninput and sensor-based evidence. Risk scores vary consistently with relevant\nfactors while remaining robust to unrelated inputs. Local sensitivity analysis\nshows predictable, mostly monotonic behavior across perturbations, and global\nSobol analysis highlights the dominant influence of expert-defined weights and\ncertainty factors, validating the model design. Overall, the results\ndemonstrate ff4ERA ability to produce interpretable, traceable, and risk-aware\nethical assessments, enabling what-if analyses and guiding designers in\ncalibrating membership functions and expert judgments for reliable ethical\ndecision support.",

    "abstract": "Applications of terawatt-class lasers can enormously benefit from pulse\ntrains with kHz repetition rates. The associated unprecedented combinations of\npeak and average powers require the development of new concepts for scalable\nultrashort pulse generation. We propose using multi-mirror multi-pass cells as\na compact and cost-efficient solution for the direct post-compression of\nsub-nanosecond pulses into the femtosecond regime. We simulate spectral\nbroadening of 100-mJ, 300-ps pulses to a sub-ps Fourier transform-limit in a\n1-m diameter multi-pass cell. Furthermore, an 11-mirror cell for about 300\npasses was set-up for proof-of-concept. To reach a spectral broadening factor\nof 15 in air, only 260 MW of peak power were required. The proposed scheme can\nefficiently transform industrially mature high-power, high-energy lasers into\nunique ultrafast sources.",

FL allows\ndecentralized clients to collaboratively train an AI model without directly\nsharing their data, preserving privacy. Clients train local models on private\ndata and share model updates, which a central server aggregates to refine the\nglobal model and redistribute it for the next iteration. However, client data\nheterogeneity slows convergence and reduces model accuracy, and frequent client\nparticipation imposes communication and computational burdens. To address these\nchallenges, we propose FedABC, an innovative client selection algorithm\ndesigned to take a long-term view in managing data heterogeneity and optimizing\nclient participation. Inspired by attention mechanisms, FedABC prioritizes\ninformative clients by evaluating both model similarity and each model's unique\ncontributions to the global model. Moreover, considering the evolving demands\nof the global model, we formulate an optimization problem to guide FedABC\nthroughout the training process. Following the \"later-is-better\" principle,\nFedABC adaptively adjusts the client selection threshold, encouraging greater\nparticipation in later training stages. Extensive simulations on CIFAR-10\ndemonstrate that FedABC significantly outperforms existing approaches in model\naccuracy and client participation efficiency, achieving comparable performance\nwith 32% fewer clients than the classical FL algorithm FedAvg, and 3.5% higher\naccuracy with 2% fewer clients than the state-of-the-art.

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the characteristics and control of tip vortices\ngenerated by a finite wing, focusing on the impact of the novel grooved-tip\ndesigns. Tip vortices can lead to flow loss, noise, vibration and cavitation in\nhydrodynamic systems. We propose and develop a grooved-tip design, featuring\nmultiple grooves distributed along the wing tip to alter the tip vortex\nstructure and dynamics. Four grooved-tip designs, including tilted and\nshrinking grooves, were experimentally investigated. Streamwise and cross-flow\nParticle Image Velocimetry (PIV) measurements were employed to visualise the\nflow fields near the wing tip and along the primary tip vortex trajectory. The\nPIV results demonstrate that the grooved-tip designs significantly reduce the\nvelocity magnitude within the primary tip vortex. This velocity deficit is\nattributed to the decreased suction within the vortex core. Furthermore,\ncross-flow PIV measurements reveal that the tip separation vortex is\nsubstantially suppressed, and the strength of the primary tip vortex is\nsignificantly mitigated. Downstream of the wing, the grooved tips lead to a\nreduction in vortex swirling strength and an enlargement of the vortex\ndimensions, suggesting enhanced diffusion and a reduction of the pressure drop\nof approximately 40%. Our findings highlight the potential of these grooved-tip\ndesigns to effectively modify tip vortex behaviour and mitigate the pressure\ndrop within the tip vortex region, with negligible changes to the lift and drag\nperformance. This work can inform advanced passive vortex control strategies in\nwing- and blade-based systems, with potential applications in hydrofoils of\nmarine vessels and underwater vehicles, as well as in turbines, propellers,\npumps, etc.",

    "abstract": "Unsupervised object discovery (UOD) aims to detect and segment objects in 2D\nimages without handcrafted annotations. Recent progress in self-supervised\nrepresentation learning has led to some success in UOD algorithms. However, the\nabsence of ground truth provides existing UOD methods with two challenges: 1)\ndetermining if a discovered region is foreground or background, and 2) knowing\nhow many objects remain undiscovered. To address these two problems, previous\nsolutions rely on foreground priors to distinguish if the discovered region is\nforeground, and conduct one or fixed iterations of discovery. However, the\nexisting foreground priors are heuristic and not always robust, and a fixed\nnumber of discoveries leads to under or over-segmentation, since the number of\nobjects in images varies. This paper introduces UnionCut, a robust and\nwell-grounded foreground prior based on min-cut and ensemble methods that\ndetects the union of foreground areas of an image, allowing UOD algorithms to\nidentify foreground objects and stop discovery once the majority of the\nforeground union in the image is segmented. In addition, we propose UnionSeg, a\ndistilled transformer of UnionCut that outputs the foreground union more\nefficiently and accurately. Our experiments show that by combining with\nUnionCut or UnionSeg, previous state-of-the-art UOD methods witness an increase\nin the performance of single object discovery, saliency detection and\nself-supervised instance segmentation on various benchmarks.

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the symmetry and magnetic field properties of the\njets in the radio galaxy NGC 1052, with particular attention to the impact of\nthe ionized torus that surrounds the central region on the emitted radiation.\nOur study is based on three new 43 GHz Very-Long-Baseline Interferometry (VLBI)\nobservations and one 86 GHz observation conducted between April 2021 and April\n2022. We derive key jet parameters, such as speed, width, and flux density for\nboth jets at the two frequencies and compare them with those obtained from\nprevious VLBI campaigns. Additionally, we present the first (43-86) GHz\nspectral index image of NGC 1052, which is crucial to assess the role of the\ntorus at high frequencies. Finally, we leverage the derived observational\nparameters to constrain the magnetic field strength and configuration in the\nlaunched jets. We observe variability in the jet morphology at 43 GHz across\nthe three epochs, which can be associated with the propagation of jet knots\nlaunched from the nuclear region. The stacked 43 GHz image reveals that the\nwestern and receding jet is approximately three times fainter than its eastern\n(approaching) counterpart in the sub-mas region. This asymmetry, together with\nthe (43-86) GHz spectral index map, suggests that free-free absorption may\naffect the 43 GHz emission. On the contrary, the jets appear highly symmetric\nat 86 GHz. From the stacked images at 43 GHz and 86 GHz, we extract the jet\nwidth, which is consistent with previous VLBI studies and supports the presence\nof a parabolic jet profile on very compact scales. Overall, our results suggest\nthat the jets are intrinsically launched symmetrically, and that the observed\ntime-dependent asymmetries may result from free-free absorption by the torus\nand the downstream propagation of jet components, a scenario supported by\nprevious theoretical studies.",

Previous work like Triad propose protocols for TEEs to maintain a\ntrustworthy time source. However, in this paper, based on a public\nimplementation of Triad that we contribute, we empirically showcase\nvulnerabilities to this protocol. For example, an attacker controlling the\noperating system, and consequently the scheduling algorithm, may arbitrarily\nmanipulate their local TEE's clock speed. What is worse, in case of faster\nmalicious clock speeds, an attacker on a single compromised machine may\npropagate the attack to honest machines participating in Triad's Trusted Time\nprotocol, causing them to skip to timestamps arbitrarily far in the future.\nThen, infected honest machines propagate time-skips themselves to other honest\nmachines interacting with them.

However, achieving human-like prediction and decision-making in\ninteractions with vulnerable road users remains a key challenge in complex\nmulti-agent interactive environments. Existing research focuses primarily on\ncrowd navigation for small mobile robots, which cannot be directly applied to\nAVs due to inherent differences in their decision-making strategies and dynamic\nboundaries. Moreover, pedestrians in these multi-agent simulations follow fixed\nbehavior patterns that cannot dynamically respond to AV actions. To overcome\nthese limitations, this paper proposes a novel framework for modeling\ninteractions between the AV and multiple pedestrians. In this framework, a\ncognitive process modeling approach inspired by the Free Energy Principle is\nintegrated into both the AV and pedestrian models to simulate more realistic\ninteraction dynamics. Specifically, the proposed pedestrian Cognitive-Risk\nSocial Force Model adjusts goal-directed and repulsive forces using a fused\nmeasure of cognitive uncertainty and physical risk to produce human-like\ntrajectories. Meanwhile, the AV leverages this fused risk to construct a\ndynamic, risk-aware adjacency matrix for a Graph Convolutional Network within a\nSoft Actor-Critic architecture, allowing it to make more reasonable and\ninformed decisions. Simulation results indicate that our proposed framework\neffectively improves safety, efficiency, and smoothness of AV navigation\ncompared to the state-of-the-art method.",

The TPOSSP aims at\ndetermining trailer routes over a time-dependent network using existing\nscheduled services, while considering tractor capacity constraints and time\nwindows for trailer pickups and deliveries. The objective is to minimize both\nthe number of schedules used and the total miles traveled. To address the large\nscale of industrial instances, the paper proposes a network reduction technique\nthat identifies the set of feasible schedule-legs for each requests. Moreover,\nto address the resulting MIP models, that still contains hundred of millions\nvariables, the paper proposes a stabilized column-generation, whose pricing\nproblem is a time-dependent shortest path. The approach is evaluated on\nindustrial instances both for tactical planning where requests for the entire\nnetwork are re-optimized and for real-time operations where new requests are\ninserted. In the tactical planning setting, the column-generation heuristic\nreturns solutions with a 3.7%-5.7% optimality gap (based on a MIP relaxation)\nin under 1.7-10.3 hours, and improves the current practice by 2.3-3.2%, with\ntranslates into savings of tens of millions of dollars a year. In the real-time\nsetting, the column-generation heuristic returns solution within 3% of\noptimality in under 1 minute, which makes it adequate for real-time deployment.\nThe results also show that the network reduction decreases run times by 85% for\nthe column-generation heuristic.",

    "abstract": "Designing stable cluster synchronization patterns is a fundamental challenge\nin nonlinear dynamics of networks with great relevance to understanding\nneuronal and brain dynamics. So far, cluster synchronizion have been studied\nexclusively in a node-based dynamical approach, according to which oscillators\nare associated only with the nodes of the network. Here, we propose a\ntopological synchronization dynamics model based on the use of the Topological\nDirac operator, which allows us to design cluster synchronization patterns for\ntopological oscillators associated with both nodes and edges of a network. In\nparticular, by modulating the ground state of the free energy associated with\nthe dynamical model we construct topological cluster synchronization patterns.\nThese are aligned with the eigenstates of the Topological Dirac Equation that\nprovide a very useful decomposition of the dynamical state of node and edge\nsignals associated with the network. We use linear stability analysis to\npredict the stability of the topological cluster synchronization patterns and\nprovide numerical evidence of the ability to design several stable topological\ncluster synchronization states on random graphs and on stochastic block models.",

The discovered concepts allow the robot to\nautonomously acquire training data and adjust its subsymbolic perception to\nrecognize the parts, as well as making planning for more complex tasks feasible\nby focusing search on those relevant object parts. We demonstrate our approach\nin a simulated world, in which an agent learns to recognize parts of objects\ninvolved in support relations.

In some cases, however, enhanced\nuniformity is expected to be present even at intermediate and possibly small\nlength scales. There exist three different classes of hyperuniform systems,\nwhere class I and class III are the strongest and weakest forms, respectively.\nWe utilize the local number variance $\\sigma_N^2(R)$ associated with a window\nof radius $R$ as a diagnostic to quantify the approach to the asymptotic\nlarge-$R$ hyperuniform scaling of a variety of class I, II, and III systems. We\nfind, for all class I systems we analyzed, including crystals, quasicrystals,\ndisordered stealthy hyperuniform systems, and the one-component plasma, a\nfaster approach to the asymptotic scaling of $\\sigma_N^2(R)$, governed by\ncorrections with integer powers of $1/R$. Thus, we conclude this represents the\nhighest degree of effective uniformity from small to large length scales. Class\nII systems, such as Fermi-sphere point processes, are characterized by\nlogarithmic $1/\\ln(R)$ corrections and, consequently, a lower degree of local\nuniformity. Class III systems, such as perturbed lattice patterns, present an\nasymptotic scaling of $1/R^{\\alpha}$, $0 < \\alpha < 1$, implying, curiously, an\nintermediate degree of local uniformity. In addition, our study provides\ninsight into when experimental and numerical finite systems are representative\nof large-scale behavior. Our findings may thereby facilitate the design of\nhyperuniform systems with enhanced physical properties arising from local\nuniformity.",

However, the search for\nthis configuration is a global optimization problem with exponentially growing\ncomplexity as the number of adsorbates and possible adsorption sites increases.\nTo address this, we express the adsorption energy as a sum of multi-adsorbate\ninteraction terms, evaluated using our in-house trained machine learning\ninteratomic potential MACE-Osaka24, and formulate the search for the most\nstable configuration as a higher-order unconstrained binary optimization (HUBO)\nproblem. We employ a tensor-train-based method, Tensor Train Optimizer (TTOpt),\nto solve the HUBO problem and identify optimal adsorption configurations of CO\nand NO molecules on various alloys up to full surface coverage. Our results\nshow that including interaction terms up to third order may be sufficient to\napproximate adsorption energies within chemical accuracy and to identify\noptimal configurations. We also observed that TTOpt performs better with the\nHUBO formulation, suggesting that third-order terms help preserve correlations\nbetween adsorption sites, which allow TTOpt to optimize configurations more\neffectively. The extensive benchmarks across various alloys, surface\ngeometries, and adsorbates demonstrate the robustness and applicability of\nusing TTOpt to solve HUBO-type global optimization problems in surface\nchemistry.

    "abstract": "This work investigates the impact of mirror dark matter (DM) on the global\nproperties of rotating neutron stars (NSs) across evolutionary stages, from\nhot, lepton-rich proto-neutron stars (PNSs) to cold, catalyzed NSs along the\nKelvin--Helmholtz timescale. The baryonic matter (BM) is modeled using a\nrelativistic mean-field (RMF) approach with density-dependent couplings, while\nthe dark sector mirrors the visible sector with analogous thermodynamic\nconditions. Using a two-fluid formalism with purely gravitational DM-BM\ninteraction, we find that rotation enlarges the star, whereas DM admixture\nincreases compactness and enhances gravitational stability. However, increased\ncompactness due to DM lowers the threshold for rotational instabilities, making\nDM-admixed stars more susceptible. Rotation decreases temperature profiles by\nredistributing thermal energy over a larger volume and reducing central\ndensity, while DM raises temperatures by deepening the gravitational potential\nand increasing thermal energy. Stars become more prone to collapse and\nrotational instabilities as frequency ($\\nu$) rises and the polar-to-equatorial\nradius ratio ($r_p/r_e$) decreases, especially near the Keplerian limit\n($\\nu_K$). DM-admixed stars also show higher surface gravitational redshifts\ndue to their compactness. Our results qualitatively agree with universal\nrelations primarily derived for rotating cold stars. These findings highlight\ncompeting effects of rotation and DM on NS thermal evolution, structure, and\nobservables, potentially offering indirect probes of DM within NSs.",

One of the key mechanisms by which this takes place is via a\ngalaxy's interactions with a local, over-dense environment (satellite or\nenvironmental quenching). In the very local Universe, we see these processes in\naction, and can also observe their effects via the distribution of satellite\ngalaxy properties. However, extending similar analyses outside of the local\nUniverse is problematic, largely due to the difficulties in robustly defining\nenvironments with small and/or incomplete spectroscopic samples. We use new\nenvironmental metrics from the high-completeness Deep Extragalactic VIsible\nLegacy Survey (DEVILS) to explore the properties of satellite galaxies at\nintermediate redshift (0.3$<$z$<$0.5) and compare directly to the Galaxy And\nMass Assembly Survey (GAMA) at 0$<$z$<$0.2. Importantly, both the galaxy\nproperties and environmental metrics in DEVILS and GAMA are derived in an\nidentical manner, reducing any methodology biases. We find: i) that satellite\ngalaxies in DEVILS and GAMA show suppressed star-formation in comparison to\nisolated systems at the same stellar mass, by $\\sim$0.5dex in\nlog$_{10}$(SFR/M$_{\\odot}$yr$^{-1}$), ii) that this suppression is strongest in\nhigher mass dark matter halos (up to $\\sim$1dex in\nlog$_{10}$(SFR/M$_{\\odot}$yr$^{-1}$) in the most massive halos) and iii) that\nat fixed stellar and halo mass, this suppression increases with time - with\nsatellite passive fractions increasing by $\\sim$10-15\\% over the last\n$\\sim$5Gyr.

    "abstract": "Modern software development heavily relies on third-party libraries to speed\nup development and enhance quality. As libraries evolve, they may break the\ntacit contract established with their clients by introducing behavioral\nbreaking changes (BBCs) that alter run-time behavior and silently break client\napplications without being detected at compile time. Traditional regression\ntests on the client side often fail to detect such BBCs, either due to limited\nlibrary coverage or weak assertions that do not sufficiently exercise the\nlibrary's expected behavior. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach\nto client--library compatibility testing that leverages existing client tests\nin a novel way. Instead of relying on developer-written assertions, we propose\nrecording the actual interactions at the API boundary during the execution of\nclient tests (protocol, input and output values, exceptions, etc.). These\nsequences of API interactions are stored as snapshots which capture the exact\ncontract expected by a client at a specific point in time. As the library\nevolves, we compare the original and new snapshots to identify perturbations in\nthe contract, flag potential BBCs, and notify clients. We implement this\ntechnique in our prototype tool Gilesi, a Java framework that automatically\ninstruments library APIs, records snapshots, and compares them. Through a\npreliminary case study on several client--library pairs with artificially\nseeded BBCs, we show that Gilesi reliably detects BBCs missed by client test\nsuites.",

Particularly SCANet achieves the best IoU, 91.61% and\n75.49% for the two datasets. Our code is available at\nhttps://github.com/AiEson/SCANet",

    "abstract": "Advancements in image generation led to the availability of easy-to-use tools\nfor malicious actors to create forged images. These tools pose a serious threat\nto the widespread Know Your Customer (KYC) applications, requiring robust\nsystems for detection of the forged Identity Documents (IDs). To facilitate the\ndevelopment of the detection algorithms, in this paper, we propose a novel\npublicly available (including commercial use) dataset, FantasyID, which mimics\nreal-world IDs but without tampering with legal documents and, compared to\nprevious public datasets, it does not contain generated faces or specimen\nwatermarks. FantasyID contains ID cards with diverse design styles, languages,\nand faces of real people. To simulate a realistic KYC scenario, the cards from\nFantasyID were printed and captured with three different devices, constituting\nthe bonafide class. We have emulated digital forgery/injection attacks that\ncould be performed by a malicious actor to tamper the IDs using the existing\ngenerative tools. The current state-of-the-art forgery detection algorithms,\nsuch as TruFor, MMFusion, UniFD, and FatFormer, are challenged by FantasyID\ndataset. It especially evident, in the evaluation conditions close to\npractical, with the operational threshold set on validation set so that false\npositive rate is at 10%, leading to false negative rates close to 50% across\nthe board on the test set. The evaluation experiments demonstrate that\nFantasyID dataset is complex enough to be used as an evaluation benchmark for\ndetection algorithms.",

    "abstract": "There has been a growing interest in Internet user privacy, demonstrated by\nthe popularity of privacy-preserving products such as Telegram and Brave, and\nthe widespread adoption of HTTPS. The Domain Name System (DNS) is a key\ncomponent of Internet-based communication and its privacy has been neglected\nfor years. Recently, DNS over HTTPS (DoH) has improved the situation by fixing\nthe issue of in-path middleboxes. Further progress has been made with\nproxy-based solutions such as Oblivious DoH (ODoH), which separate a user's\nidentity from their DNS queries. However, these solutions rely on non-collusion\nassumptions between DNS resolvers and proxies -- an assumption difficult to\nguarantee in practice. To address this, we explore integrating single-server\nPrivate Information Retrieval (PIR) into DNS to enable encrypted query\nprocessing without relying on trust assumptions. However, applying PIR to DNS\nis challenging due to its hierarchical nature -- particularly, interactions\nwith recursive resolvers can still leak information. Navigating performance and\nprivacy trade-offs, we propose PDNS, a DNS extension leveraging single-server\nPIR to strengthen privacy guarantees. We have implemented a prototype of PDNS\nand compared its performance against state-of-the-art solutions via\ntrace-driven experiments. The results show that PDNS achieves acceptable\nperformance (2x faster than DoH over Tor with similar privacy guarantees) and\nstrong privacy guarantees today, mainly at the cost of its scalability, which\nspecialized hardware for PIR can address in the near future.",

It\nprovides overdamped conditions, allowing for the extraction of purely\nstructural responses in the absence of thermal vibration. However, it requires\ncomputationally expensive sequences of affine deformation followed by\nminimization of the potential energy to incrementally find the path in the\npotential energy landscape that corresponds to the correct solution trajectory.\nTherefore, we propose an athermal parallel stepping scheme that significantly\nimproves the computational time necessary to find the correct solution\ntrajectory using a multi-thread approach. Our approach proposes athermal\nstepping at two levels. Level I stepping provides a sequence of initial guesses\nat large increments by affine deformation of the system and land-marking anchor\npoints on the potential energy landscape. Level II stepping performs a set of\nindividual finely resolved athermal quasistatic deformation steps between the\ninherent structures of the initial level I guesses executed in parallel. The\nevaluated candidate trajectory is then verified by consecutively comparing the\nconfiguration of every last level II result with the corresponding inherent\nstructure of the level I guesses at the same strain states. If the two\nconfigurations are not equivalent, the solution must be rejected and\nrecalculated from this point. Rigorous numerical testing with $4,8,16$ and $32$\nparallel threads demonstrates that our method achieves computational speed-ups\nof factors ranging from $1.49$ to $27.09$, with averages of $3.0$ to $6.62$\ndepending on the number of threads, while maintaining simulation accuracy,\noffering a powerful new tool for athermal molecular simulations.",

    "abstract": "This study presents a practical and dose-efficient strategy for resolution\nenhancement in planar radiography, based on mechanically supersampled\nacquisition with high-Z photon-counting detectors (PCDs). Unlike prior\nevent-based or cluster methods, our approach operates in true photon-counting\nmode and supports clinical flux rates. Using detector trajectories spanning\nmultiple pixels and image registration-based shift estimation, we achieve\nsub-pixel sampling without requiring mechanical precision, while also\ncompensating for motion and geometric instabilities. An iterative\nreconstruction framework based on Maximum Likelihood Expectation Maximization\n(MLEM) with a distance-driven ray model further enhances resolution and noise\nrobustness. Long-range supersampling additionally mitigates pixel defects and\nspectral inhomogeneities inherent to high-Z detectors. Phantom studies\ndemonstrate substantial resolution improvement and image uniformity. In\ncomparison with a clinical mammography system, the method reveals sharper\ndetail and more homogeneous contrast at comparable or reduced dose. The\nresolution gain also reduces the need for geometric magnification, enabling\nsmaller and more cost-effective PCDs. These results establish mechanically\nsupersampled radiography as a clinically viable approach for micron-scale\nimaging, with strong potential for digital mammography and other\nhigh-resolution applications and with scan times compatible with clinical\nworkflow.",

    "abstract": "Advancements in analog-to-digital converter (ADC) technology have enabled\nhigher sampling rates, making it feasible to adopt digital radar architectures\nthat directly sample the radio-frequency (RF) signal, eliminating the need for\nanalog downconversion. This digital approach supports greater flexibility in\nwaveform design and signal processing, particularly through digital modulation\nschemes like orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM). This paper\npresents a digital radar system mounted on an uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV),\nwhich employs OFDM waveforms for coherent multistatic synthetic aperture radar\n(SAR) imaging in the L-band. The radar setup features a primary UAV node\nresponsible for signal transmission and monostatic data acquisition, alongside\nsecondary nodes that operate in a receive-only mode. These secondary nodes\ncapture the radar signal reflected from the scene as well as a direct sidelink\nsignal. RF signals from both the radar and sidelink paths are sampled and\nprocessed offline. To manage data storage efficiently, a trigger mechanism is\nemployed to record only the relevant portions of the radar signal. The system\nmaintains coherency in both fast-time and slow-time domains, which is essential\nfor multistatic SAR imaging. Because the secondary nodes are passive, the\nsystem can be easily scaled to accommodate a larger swarm of UAVs. The paper\ndetails the full signal processing workflow for both monostatic and multistatic\nSAR image formation, including an analysis and correction of synchronization\nerrors that arise from the uncoupled operation of the nodes. The proposed\ncoherent processing method is validated through static radar measurements,\ndemonstrating coherency achieved by the concept. Additionally, a UAV-based\nbistatic SAR experiment demonstrates the system's performance by producing\nhigh-resolution monostatic, bistatic, and combined multistatic SAR images.",

The scattering hypervolume $D$ is\ndefined for this collision. Unlike the scattering hypervolume defined by one of\nus in 2008, whose dimension is length to the fourth power, the dimension of $D$\nstudied in the present paper is length to the eighth power. We then derive the\nexpression of $D$ when the interaction potentials are weak, using the Born's\nexpansion. We also calculate the energy shift of such three bosons with three\ndifferent momenta $\\hbar \\mathbf{k_{1}}$, $\\hbar\\mathbf{k_{2}}$ and\n$\\hbar\\mathbf{k_{3}}$ in a large periodic box. The obtained energy shift\ndepends on $D^{(0)}/\\Omega^{2}$ and $D/\\Omega^{2}$, where $D^{(0)}$ is the\nthree-body scattering hypervolume defined for the three-body $L=0$ collision\nand $\\Omega$ is the volume of the periodic box.

We then calculate the shift of the energy and the three-body\nrecombination rate due to $D^{(0)}$ and $D$ in the dilute homogeneous Bose gas.\nThe contribution to the three-body recombination rate constant from $D$ is\nproportional to $T^2$ if the temperature $T$ is much larger than the quantum\ndegeneracy temperature but still much lower than the temperature scale at which\nthe thermal de Broglie wave length becomes comparable to the physical range of\ninteraction.",

Analysis of\nthese reports has previously been constrained by the manual effort required to\nidentify and code relevant cases. In 2025, the Office for National Statistics\n(ONS) published a national thematic review of child-suicide PFD reports ($\\leq$\n18 years), identifying 37 cases from January 2015 to November 2023 - a process\nbased entirely on manual curation and coding. We evaluated whether a fully\nautomated, open source \"text-to-table\" language-model pipeline (PFD Toolkit)\ncould reproduce the ONS's identification and thematic analysis of child-suicide\nPFD reports, and assessed gains in efficiency and reliability. All 4,249 PFD\nreports published from July 2013 to November 2023 were processed via PFD\nToolkit's large language model pipelines. Automated screening identified cases\nwhere the coroner attributed death to suicide in individuals aged 18 or\nyounger, and eligible reports were coded for recipient category and 23 concern\nsub-themes, replicating the ONS coding frame. PFD Toolkit identified 72\nchild-suicide PFD reports - almost twice the ONS count. Three blinded\nclinicians adjudicated a stratified sample of 144 reports to validate the\nchild-suicide screening. Against the post-consensus clinical annotations, the\nLLM-based workflow showed substantial to almost-perfect agreement (Cohen's\n$\\kappa$ = 0.82, 95% CI: 0.66-0.98, raw agreement = 91%). The end-to-end script\nruntime was 8m 16s, transforming a process that previously took months into one\nthat can be completed in minutes. This demonstrates that automated LLM analysis\ncan reliably and efficiently replicate manual thematic reviews of coronial\ndata, enabling scalable, reproducible, and timely insights for public health\nand safety.

    "abstract": "Observations of double-lined spectroscopic eclipsing binaries are ideal to\nstudy stellar evolution. They have tight model-independent constraints on their\nmasses and radii. With the addition of spectroscopically determined effective\ntemperatures and surface abundances, they can be used to calibrate and improve\nmodels. Here we determine whether the observed trends of surface nitrogen\nabundance in single and binary stars can be explained by wave-induced mixing\noccurring in the stellar envelope. We use MESA to run the simulations. We\ncompare the outcome of the models to observations of the surface nitrogen\nabundance for samples of detached eclipsing binary systems and of single B-type\nstars. From this we determine the amount of wave-induced mixing required to\nbring the model predictions in agreement with the observations. We find\nnitrogen to be enriched at the surface of theoretical models with wave-induced\nmixing provided that we use levels above log(Denv)=5-6 at the convective core\nboundary. A prominent observation is that the B-type components of detached\neclipsing binaries do not show any nitrogen surface enhancement, which can be\nexplained by their relatively fast rotation enforced by the tidal forces in the\nsystems. The slowly rotating or evolved stars among the sample of single B\nstars do reveal a nitrogen enhancement. Our findings on the difference between\nsingle B stars and B-type components of detached binary systems can potentially\nbe explained by internal wave-induced mixing profiles based on recent\n2-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of rotating B stars. Such wave-induced\nmixing decreases with increasing rotation and may act in combination with\nadditional rotational mixing. Our findings motivate future asteroseismic\nstudies in samples of single B stars and pulsating eclipsing binaries with\nB-type components as optimal laboratories to further test our interpretations.",

This approach provides a more realistic\ndepiction of axially symmetric disk dynamics and assesses observable burst\nsignatures. We simulate the inner 10 astronomical units of a circumstellar disk\naround a high-mass protostar, incorporating viscous heating and radiative\ntransport in radial and vertical directions. Unlike previous one-dimensional\nstudies, our two-dimensional model resolves time-dependent vertical disk\nstructure, capturing complex radial-vertical dynamics. Our simulations show\nthermal instability causes significant structural changes. Steep temperature\ngradients and vigorous convection develop at outburst onset, with gas flows\ndiffering between midplane and upper layers. Energy release produces 15-30 year\noutbursts with peak accretion rates of $2-3\\times10^{-4}~\\rm\nM_{\\odot}~\\rm{yr}^{-1}$. While observable, these bursts are insufficiently\nbright with rise times differing from rapid observed events. Our models lack\nthe \"reflares\" seen in one-dimensional calculations.

    "abstract": "Relativistic leptons in galaxy clusters lose their energy via radiation\n(synchrotron and inverse Compton losses) and interactions with the ambient\nplasma. At z~0, pure radiative losses limit the lifetime of electrons emitting\nat ~GHz frequencies to t<100 Myr. Adiabatic losses can further lower Lorentz\nfactors of electrons trapped in an expanding medium. If the propagation speed\nof electrons relative to the ambient weakly magnetized (plasma $\\beta\\sim10^2$)\nIntracluster Medium (ICM) is limited by the Alfv\\'en speed,\n$v_{a,ICM}=c_{s,ICM}/\\beta^{1/2}\\sim 10^7\\,{\\rm cm\\,s^{-1}}$, GHz-emitting\nelectrons can travel only $l \\sim v_{a,ICM}t_r\\sim 10\\,kpc$ relative to the\nunderlying plasma. Yet, elongated structures spanning hundreds of kpc or even a\nfew Mpc are observed, requiring either a re-acceleration mechanism or another\nform of synchronization, e.g., by a large-scale shock. We argue that filaments\nwith ordered magnetic fields supported by non-thermal pressure have $v_{a}\\gg\nv_{a,{\\rm ICM}}$ and so can provide such a synchronization even without\nre-acceleration or shocks. In particular, along quasi-stationary filaments,\nelectrons can propagate without experiencing adiabatic losses, and their\nvelocity is not limited by the Alfv\\'en or sound speeds of the ambient thermal\nplasma. This model predicts that along filaments that span significant pressure\ngradients, e.g., in the cores of galaxy clusters, the synchrotron break\nfrequency $\\nu_b\\propto B$ should scale with the ambient gas pressure as\n$P^{1/2}$, and the emission from such filaments should be strongly polarized.\nWhile some of these structures can be observed as \"filaments\", i.e., long and\nnarrow bright structures, others can be unresolved and have a collective\nappearance of a diffuse structure, or be too faint to be detected, while still\nproviding channels for electrons' propagation.",

However,\ndespite the use of such equipment, measurement errors can occur due to\nmechanical and software-related factors within the system. These errors are\nparticularly evident in applications where parts of different diameters are\nmeasured using the same setup. This study proposes two innovative approaches to\nenhance measurement accuracy using multiple known reference parts: a conversion\nfactor-based method and a pixel-based method. In the first approach, the\nconversion factor is estimated from known references to calculate the diameter\n(mm) of the unknown part. In the second approach, the diameter (mm) is directly\nestimated using pixel-based diameter information from the references. The\nexperimental setup includes an industrial-grade camera and telecentric lenses.\nTests conducted on glass samples (1-12 mm) and metal workpieces (3-24 mm) show\nthat measurement errors, which originally ranged from 13-114 micrometers, were\nreduced to 1-2 micrometers using the proposed methods. By utilizing only a few\nknown reference parts, the proposed approach enables high-accuracy measurement\nof all parts within the camera's field of view. Additionally, this method\nenhances the existing diameter measurement literature by significantly reducing\nerror rates and improving measurement reliability.",

In this work, we\ninvestigate the design of a spatial B&B algorithm that involves an\ninterval-based GPU-parallel lower bounding solver: The domain of each B&B node\nis temporarily partitioned into numerous subdomains, then massive GPU\nparallelism is leveraged to compute interval bounds of the objective function\nand constraints on each subdomain, using the Mean Value Form.

Subsequent investigations into enhancing their\nvisual reasoning abilities have significantly expanded their performance\nenvelope. However, a critical bottleneck in the advancement of MLLMs toward\ndeep visual reasoning is their heavy reliance on curated image-text\nsupervision. To solve this problem, we introduce a novel framework,\n``Reasoning-Rendering-Visual-Feedback'' (RRVF), that enables MLLMs to learn\ncomplex visual reasoning from only raw images. This framework builds on the\n``Asymmetry of Verification'' principle, i.e., verifying the rendered output\nagainst the source image is substantially easier than performing deep visual\nreasoning to generate a faithful, structured representation such as code. We\ndemonstrate that this relative ease provides an ideal reward signal for\noptimization via Reinforcement Learning (RL), thereby reducing reliance on\nimage-text supervision. RRVF implements a closed-loop iterative process\nencompassing reasoning, rendering, and visual feedback components, enabling the\nmodel to perform complex reasoning, including self-correction through\nmulti-turn interactions. This process is optimized end-to-end using the GRPO\nalgorithm. Extensive evaluations are conducted on image-to-code generation\nacross two diverse domains: data charts and web interfaces. The RRVF-trained\nmodel not only outperforms existing similarly sized open-source MLLMs and\nsupervised fine-tuning baselines but also exhibits superior generalization.\nNotably, the model outperforms the more advanced MLLM used to generate visual\nfeedback during training.

    "abstract": "Hyperspectral imagers on satellites obtain the fine spectral signatures\nessential for distinguishing one material from another at the expense of\nlimited spatial resolution. Enhancing the latter is thus a desirable\npreprocessing step in order to further improve the detection capabilities\noffered by hyperspectral images on downstream tasks. At the same time, there is\na growing interest towards deploying inference methods directly onboard of\nsatellites, which calls for lightweight image super-resolution methods that can\nbe run on the payload in real time. In this paper, we present a novel neural\nnetwork design, called Deep Pushbroom Super-Resolution (DPSR) that matches the\npushbroom acquisition of hyperspectral sensors by processing an image line by\nline in the along-track direction with a causal memory mechanism to exploit\npreviously acquired lines. This design greatly limits memory requirements and\ncomputational complexity, achieving onboard real-time performance, i.e., the\nability to super-resolve a line in the time it takes to acquire the next one,\non low-power hardware. Experiments show that the quality of the super-resolved\nimages is competitive or even outperforms state-of-the-art methods that are\nsignificantly more complex.",

    "abstract": "Multimodal fusion has become a key enabler for UAV-based object detection, as\neach modality provides complementary cues for robust feature extraction.\nHowever, due to significant differences in resolution, field of view, and\nsensing characteristics across modalities, accurate registration is a\nprerequisite before fusion. Despite its importance, there is currently no\npublicly available benchmark specifically designed for multimodal registration\nin UAV-based aerial scenarios, which severely limits the development and\nevaluation of advanced registration methods under real-world conditions. To\nbridge this gap, we present ATR-UMMIM, the first benchmark dataset specifically\ntailored for multimodal image registration in UAV-based applications. This\ndataset includes 7,969 triplets of raw visible, infrared, and precisely\nregistered visible images captured covers diverse scenarios including flight\naltitudes from 80m to 300m, camera angles from 0{\\deg} to 75{\\deg}, and\nall-day, all-year temporal variations under rich weather and illumination\nconditions. To ensure high registration quality, we design a semi-automated\nannotation pipeline to introduce reliable pixel-level ground truth to each\ntriplet. In addition, each triplet is annotated with six imaging condition\nattributes, enabling benchmarking of registration robustness under real-world\ndeployment settings. To further support downstream tasks, we provide\nobject-level annotations on all registered images, covering 11 object\ncategories with 77,753 visible and 78,409 infrared bounding boxes. We believe\nATR-UMMIM will serve as a foundational benchmark for advancing multimodal\nregistration, fusion, and perception in real-world UAV scenarios.

Albeit these\napproaches achieve fruitful results on benchmark datasets, they tend to fall\nshort of sports scenarios where human movements are more complicated than daily\nlife actions, as being hindered by motion blur, occlusions, and domain shifts.\nMoreover, due to the fact that critical motions in a sports game often finish\nin moments of time (e.g., shooting), the ability to focus on momentary actions\nis becoming a crucial factor in sports analysis, where current methods appear\nto struggle with instantaneous scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we\nintroduce KASportsFormer, a novel transformer based 3D pose estimation\nframework for sports that incorporates a kinematic anatomy-informed feature\nrepresentation and integration module. In which the inherent kinematic motion\ninformation is extracted with the Bone Extractor (BoneExt) and Limb Fuser\n(LimbFus) modules and encoded in a multimodal manner.

However,\nthis emerging paradigm introduces two critical challenges. First, the\nsubstantial commercial potential and resource-intensive development raise\nurgent concerns about intellectual property (IP) protection. Second, their\npowerful time series forecasting capabilities may be misused to produce\nmisleading or fabricated deepfake time series data. To address these concerns,\nwe explore watermarking the outputs of LLMTS models, that is, embedding\nimperceptible signals into the generated time series data that remain\ndetectable by specialized algorithms. We propose a novel post-hoc watermarking\nframework, Waltz, which is broadly compatible with existing LLMTS models. Waltz\nis inspired by the empirical observation that time series patch embeddings are\nrarely aligned with a specific set of LLM tokens, which we term ``cold\ntokens''. Leveraging this insight, Waltz embeds watermarks by rewiring the\nsimilarity statistics between patch embeddings and cold token embeddings, and\ndetects watermarks using similarity z-scores. To minimize potential side\neffects, we introduce a similarity-based embedding position identification\nstrategy and employ projected gradient descent to constrain the watermark noise\nwithin a defined boundary. Extensive experiments using two popular LLMTS models\nacross seven benchmark datasets demonstrate that Waltz achieves high watermark\ndetection accuracy with minimal impact on the quality of the generated time\nseries.",

A 10 x 10 cm^2 prototype of the NMX\ndetector was equipped with two enriched Gd samples (157Gd and 155Gd) that were\nattached with copper tape to the natural Gd cathode of the detector. Three sets\nof measurements were taken, with the beam focused on either the natural Gd, the\n157Gd, or the 155Gd samples. Using the time-of-flight technique with the\nsubsequent conversion of time-of-flight into energy, the resonant region\nbetween 1 eV and 200 eV of the 157Gd and 155Gd cross sections was studied. The\npeaks in the resonant region were clearly visible, having higher ADC values in\nthe ADC spectrum. Additionally, the resonant peaks had a larger number of\ncounts per energy bin. In the thermal neutron energy range, the count rate at\nthe center of the beam was measured for natural Gd, 157Gd, and 155Gd. Enriched\n157Gd showed an efficiency that was between 60 - 180% higher, compared to\nnatural Gd, for neutron wavelengths between 0.8 A and 1.8 A. The measured 60 %\nincrease in efficiency at 1.8 A is lower than expected from simulations (100 %)\nand previous measurements with solid state detectors (80 %). Gamma background\ndetection, bad focusing, and saturation effects most likely explain this\ndeviation. An upgrade of the natural Gd converter to enriched 157Gd would thus\nlead to an efficiency increase of at least 60 %.

Current parameter reduction\ntechniques primarily involve training MLLMs from Small Language Models (SLMs),\nbut these methods offer limited flexibility and remain computationally\nintensive. To address this gap, we propose to directly compress existing MLLMs\nthrough structural pruning combined with efficient recovery training.\nSpecifically, we investigate two structural pruning paradigms--layerwise and\nwidthwise pruning--applied to the language model backbone of MLLMs, alongside\nsupervised finetuning and knowledge distillation. Additionally, we assess the\nfeasibility of conducting recovery training with only a small fraction of the\navailable data. Our results show that widthwise pruning generally maintains\nbetter performance in low-resource scenarios with limited computational\nresources or insufficient finetuning data. As for the recovery training,\nfinetuning only the multimodal projector is sufficient at small compression\nlevels (< 20%). Furthermore, a combination of supervised finetuning and\nhidden-state distillation yields optimal recovery across various pruning\nlevels. Notably, effective recovery can be achieved with as little as 5% of the\noriginal training data, while retaining over 95% of the original performance.\nThrough empirical study on two representative MLLMs, i.e., LLaVA-v1.5-7B and\nBunny-v1.0-3B, this study offers actionable insights for practitioners aiming\nto compress MLLMs effectively without extensive computation resources or\nsufficient data.",

In this work, we investigate the\nimpact of distance-based adaptive behaviors on epidemic dynamics, where a\nfraction of the population adjusts its transmission range and susceptibility to\ninfection based on global prevalence. We consider three adaptation scenarios: a\nconstant adaptive fraction, a power-law dependence and a sigmoidal dependence\nof adaptive fraction on global prevalence. In the spatially well-mixed regime,\nwe analytically obtain critical adaptation thresholds necessary for epidemic\nmitigation and in the spatially static regime, we establish bounds for the\nthresholds using continuum percolation results. Our results indicate that a\nlinear adaptive response to prevalence provides no additional advantage over a\nconstant adaptive fraction in controlling outbreaks, and a highly super-linear\nresponse is required to suppress epidemic spread. For a sigmoidal adaptation,\nwe identify conditions under which oscillations in prevalence can emerge, with\npeak prevalence exhibiting a non-monotonic dependence on the width of the\nsigmoidal function, suggesting an optimal parameter range that minimizes\nepidemic severity. We obtain prevalence, final epidemic size, and peak\nprevalence as functions of adaptation parameters in all adaptation scenarios\nconsidered, providing a comprehensive characterization of the effects of\nspatial adaptation based on global prevalence information in shaping adaptive\nepidemic dynamics.",

Moreover, previous studies incorporate all\nmodalities statically or adaptively, overlooking the negative impacts of\nirrelevant or misleading information in the incompetent modalities. To address\nthese issues, we introduce a novel Reinforced Multimodal Distillation\nframework, exploiting the Dark Side of Modalities (DSoM) from two perspectives:\n(1) Dark knowledge from non-target entities: We propose to train a unimodal KGR\nmodel through logit distillation to mimic the multimodal soft labels provided\nby pre-trained multimodal teacher models. The multimodal soft labels could\nprovide rich supervision signals with subtle correlations among both target and\nnon-target entities from multiple perspectives. We further decouple logits into\nneighbor entities and non-neighbor entities to divide into two types of\ncorrelations. (2) Dark side in unhelpful modalities: To exclude the adverse\neffects of unhelpful modalities, we introduce a reinforced teacher combination\nmechanism that dynamically selects the optimal set of multimodal teachers for\neach triple. The agent is trained to maximize the rewards, which are only\nassigned to the beneficial multimodal combination strategies for the student\nmodel. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of DSoM\nframework on 5 MKGR datasets. Codes are available at github.com/OreOZhao/DSoM.",

In this\nwork, we investigate the consequences of finite resources in the emergence of\nintersubjectivity as a model for measurement processes with multiple observers.\nHere, intersubjectivity refers to a condition in which observers agree on the\nobserved outcome (agreement), and their local random variables exactly\nreproduce the original random variable for the system observable (probability\nreproducibility). While agreement and reproducibility are mutually implied in\nthe case of ideal measurement, finite thermodynamic resources constrain each of\nthem. Starting from the third law of thermodynamics, we derive how the\nachievability of ideal intersubjectivity is affected by restricted\nthermodynamic resources. Specifically, we establish a no-go theorem concerning\nperfect intersubjectivity and present a deviation metric to account for the\ninfluence of limited resources.

Here, we define an algorithm to identify\nBLT states, which is based on the physically motivated crosshair marker and\nrobustness analyses. Applying the algorithm to the Hofstadter model on the\nAmmann-Beenker tiling, we find that the BLT states appear mainly for magnetic\nfluxes within a specific interval. While edge states appear at low densities of\nstates, we find that BLT states can appear at many different densities of\nstates. Many of the BLT states are found to have real-space localization that\nfollows geometric patterns characteristic of the given quasicrystal.\nFurthermore, BLT states can appear both isolated and in groups within the\nenergy spectrum which could imply greater robustness for the states within such\ngroups.

Despite progress in same-domain composition, cross-domain\ncomposition remains under-explored. The main challenges are the stochastic\nnature of diffusion models and the style gap between input images, leading to\nfailures and artifacts. Additionally, heavy reliance on text prompts limits\npractical applications. This paper presents the first cross-domain image\ncomposition method that does not require text prompts, allowing natural\nstylization and seamless compositions. Our method is efficient and robust,\npreserving the diffusion prior, as it involves minor steps for backward\ninversion and forward denoising without training the diffuser. Our method also\nuses a simple multilayer perceptron network to integrate CLIP features from\nforeground and background, manipulating diffusion with a local cross-attention\nstrategy. It effectively preserves foreground content while enabling stable\nstylization without a pre-stylization network. Finally, we create a benchmark\ndataset with diverse contents and styles for fair evaluation, addressing the\nlack of testing datasets for cross-domain image composition. Our method\noutperforms state-of-the-art techniques in both qualitative and quantitative\nevaluations, significantly improving the LPIPS score by 30.5% and the CSD\nmetric by 18.1%.

    "abstract": "Optimal transport has recently been brought forward as a tool for modeling\nand efficiently solving a variety of flow problems, such as origin-destination\nproblems and multi-commodity flow problems. Although the framework has shown to\nbe effective for many large scale flow problems, the formulations typically\nlack dynamic properties used in common traffic models, such as the\nLighthill-Whitham-Richards model. In this work, we propose an optimal transport\nframework that includes dynamic constraints specified by the fundamental\ndiagram for modeling macroscopic traffic flow. The problem is cast as a convex\nvariant of dynamic optimal transport, with additional nonlinear\ntemporal-spatial inequality constraints of momentum, modeled after the\nfundamental diagram from traffic theory. This constraint imposes a\ndensity-dependent upper bound on the admissible flux, capturing flow saturation\nand congestion effects, and thus leaves space for kinetic optimization. The\nformulation follows the Benamou-Brenier transportation rationale, whereby\nkinetic energy over density and momentum fields is optimized subject to the\nmass conservation law. We develop proximal splitting methods, namely the\nDouglas-Rachford and Chambolle-Pock algorithms, which exploit the separable\nstructure of the constraint set and require only simple proximal operations,\nand can accommodate additional (time-varying) spatial restrictions or\nobstacles. Numerical experiments illustrate the impact of the constraint on\ntransport behavior, including congestion-aware spreading, rerouting, and\nconvergence. The framework establishes a connection between optimal transport\nand macroscopic traffic flow theory and provides a scalable, variational tool\nfor modeling congestion-constricted (or saturation-aware) Wasserstein gradient\nflow.",

However, the key distinction persists:\nthe bound state crosses zero in the trivial phase but not in the topological\nphase. Two complementary diagrammatic approaches give matching densities of\nstates for the normal, topological, Weyl and anomalous quantum Hall regimes.\nOff diagonal disorder inserts bulk states into the gap and can close it: the\nWeyl phase remains robust under strong disorder, whereas the anomalous quantum\nHall phase survives only for weak fluctuations, and the added bulk states\nshrink the Hall plateau, clarifying experimental deviations.

    "abstract": "We consider different choices of Keplerian conservation laws for the\ncomputation of preliminary orbits with two very short arcs (VSAs) of\nastrometric observations. In total we have 7 equations in 4 unknowns. Adding\ntwo auxiliary variables we can embed the full set of conservation laws into a\npolynomial system of 9 equations. This complete system generically has no\nsolutions. However, combining these equations, in [10] the authors found an\nover-determined polynomial system that is consistent, and leads by variable\nelimination to a univariate polynomial $\\mathsf{p}_9$ of degree 9 in one radial\ndistance. In [9] the authors showed that this corresponds to taking a subsystem\nwith 7 equations of the complete system. In this paper we consider all the\nother possibilities and we find two additional over-determined cases which are\nconsistent and lead to a univariate polynomial $\\mathsf{p}_{18}$ of degree 18\nin the same variable as $\\mathsf{p}_9$. In the other over-determined cases the\ncorresponding system is inconsistent. We also present a method to compute an\napproximate gcd of $\\mathsf{p}_9$ and $\\mathsf{p}_{18}$, that can allow us to\nfind preliminary orbits that approximately satisfy inconsistent systems of\nconservation laws, or to discard incompatible pairs of VSAs. We show this\nthrough some numerical tests with real asteroid data.",

To mitigate this issue, outlier detection\nand removal algorithms are often applied before the circle fitting procedure.\nThis study introduces the Polar Coordinate-Based Outlier Detection (PCOD)\nalgorithm, which can be effectively employed in circle fitting applications. In\nthe proposed approach, the point set is first transformed into polar\ncoordinates, followed by the calculation of both local and global standard\ndeviations. Outliers are then identified by comparing local mean values with\nthe global standard deviation. The practicality and efficiency of the proposed\nmethod are demonstrated by focusing on the high-precision diameter measurement\nof industrial washer parts. Images from a machine vision system are processed\nthrough preprocessing steps, including sub-pixel edge detection. The resulting\nsub-pixel edge points are then cleaned using the proposed outlier detection and\nremoval algorithm, after which circle fitting is performed.

    "abstract": "Hydrogen produced through electrolysis offers a pathway to decarbonize\nhard-to-abate sectors by replacing gray hydrogen derived from natural gas\nreforming when produced using renewable power. However, grid-connected\nelectrolyzers may inadvertently increase power-system emissions, resulting in\nhydrogen whose life-cycle intensity is similar to or higher than that of gray\nhydrogen. To address the high cost barrier of electrolytic hydrogen, both the\nE.U. and U.S. have introduced subsidy schemes conditional on low associated\nemissions. One key requirement is temporal matching, under which a subsidy\napplies only to the hydrogen volume that, ex-post, can be shown to match\nrenewable generation over each one-hour interval. This requirement exposes the\nelectrolyzer to uncertainty in the subsidy-eligible volume and thus the value\nof the produced hydrogen. This paper develops an uncertainty-aware day-ahead\nbid curve for a grid-connected electrolyzer. We formulate a linear program that\nmaximizes expected profit across scenarios of renewable production and derive\nthe bid curve from its Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions. A case study demonstrates\nthat incorporating renewable uncertainty into the bid curve increases\nelectrolyzer profit by approximately 4%, although it does not improve ex-post\ntemporal matching.

A training problem is defined that is structurally similar\nto the Support Vector Machine (SVM) one, thus leading to call our method the\nEllipsoidal Separation Machine (ESM). Like SVM, the training problem is convex,\nand can in particular be formulated as a Semidefinite Program (SDP); however,\nsolving it by means of standard SDP approaches does not scale to the size\nrequired by practical classification task. As an alternative, a nonconvex\nformulation is proposed that is amenable to a Block-Gauss-Seidel approach\nalternating between a much smaller SDP and a simple separable Second-Order Cone\nProgram (SOCP). For the purpose of the classification approach the reduced SDP\ncan even be solved approximately by relaxing it in a Lagrangian way and\nupdating the multipliers by fast subgradient-type approaches. A characteristic\nof ESM is that it necessarily defines ``indeterminate points'', i.e., those\nthat cannot be reliably classified as belonging to one of the two sets. This\nmakes it particularly suitable for Classification with Rejection (CwR) tasks,\nwhereby the system explicitly indicates that classification of some points as\nbelonging to one of the two sets is too doubtful to be reliable.

Our method is based on measuring the local current\nthrough a lead as the coupling to a second one is varied: the shape of the\ncurrent is determined by the ratio between the local coherence factors,\nbecoming independent of the coupling to the second lead in the presence of\nlocal electron-hole symmetry, {\\it i.e.} coherence factors $|u|=|v|$. We apply\nour method to minimal Kitaev chains: arrays of quantum dots coupled via narrow\nsuperconducting segments. These chains feature Majorana-like quasiparticles\n(zero-energy states with $|u|=|v|$) at discrete points in parameter space. We\ndemonstrate that the local current allows us to estimate the local Majorana\npolarization (MP) -- a measurement of the local Majorana properties of the\nstate. We derive an analytical expression for the MP in terms of local currents\nand benchmark it against numerical calculations for 2- and 3-sites chains that\ninclude a finite Zeeman field and electron-electron interactions. These results\nprovide a way to quantitatively assess the quality of Majorana states in short\nKitaev chains.",

At half fillings, continuous\nquasiparticle phase transitions between paired FQH states, magnetic Bloch\nstates, and composite Fermi liquids are clearly identified upon tuning external\nfields.

We first evaluate the\npotential gain of ideal IC-NLC in 4 THz systems by estimating the proportion of\nself-channel interference (SCI) using the split-step Fourier method (SSFM)\nbased simulation with either lumped amplification or distributed amplification.\nAs the symbol rate increases to 300 GBaud, the SCI proportion exceeds 65%. On\nthe other hand, the non-deterministic polarization mode dispersion (PMD) will\nimpact the effectiveness of IC-NLC, especially for ultra-high symbol rate\nsystems. Therefore, we investigate the power spectral density of the residual\nnonlinear noise after ideal IC-NLC in the presence of PMD. The results indicate\nthat the gain of ideal digital backpropagation (IDBP) decreases by 3.85 dB in\n300 GBaud erbium-doped fiber amplifier (EDFA)-amplified links with a PMD\nparameter of 0.05 ps/km1/2, and 5.09 dB in distributed Raman amplifier\n(DRA)-amplified links. Finally, we evaluate the potential gains of practical\nIC-NLC in C-band wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) systems by employing\nthe low-pass-filter assisted digital backpropagation (LDBP). As the symbol rate\nincreases from 100 GBaud to 300 GBaud, the gain of 20-step-per-span (20-stps)\nLDBP increases from 0.53 dB to 0.87 dB for EDFA-amplified links, and from 0.89\ndB to 1.30 dB for DRA-amplified links.

    "abstract": "In recent years, advances in Artificial Intelligence have significantly\nimpacted computer science, particularly in the field of computer vision,\nenabling solutions to complex problems such as video frame prediction. Video\nframe prediction has critical applications in weather forecasting or autonomous\nsystems and can provide technical improvements, such as video compression and\nstreaming. Among Artificial Intelligence methods, Deep Learning has emerged as\nhighly effective for solving vision-related tasks, although current frame\nprediction models still have room for enhancement. This paper evaluates several\nhybrid deep learning approaches that combine the feature extraction\ncapabilities of autoencoders with temporal sequence modelling using Recurrent\nNeural Networks (RNNs), 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (3D CNNs), and related\narchitectures. The proposed solutions were rigorously evaluated on three\ndatasets that differ in terms of synthetic versus real-world scenarios and\ngrayscale versus color imagery. Results demonstrate that the approaches perform\nwell, with SSIM metrics increasing from 0.69 to 0.82, indicating that hybrid\nmodels utilizing 3DCNNs and ConvLSTMs are the most effective, and greyscale\nvideos with real data are the easiest to predict.",

This fine-tuning step plays a vital role in mitigating the\ngap between synthetic and real-world data, thereby enhancing the model's\nrobustness and generalization across diverse hypergraph topologies. Extensive\nexperiments on eight empirical hypergraphs show that AHGA outperforms classical\ncentrality-based baselines by approximately 37.4%.

Its numerical stability can be\nimproved by introducing a pivoting strategy that iteratively permutes the rows\nand columns of the matrix. The order of pivoting indices determines how\naccurately the intermediate decomposition can reconstruct the original matrix,\nthus is decisive for the algorithm's efficiency in the case of early\ntermination. Standard implementations select the next pivot from the largest\nvalue on the diagonal. In the case of Bayesian nonparametric inference, this\nstrategy corresponds to greedy entropy maximization, which is often used in\nactive learning and design of experiments. We explore this connection in detail\nand deduce novel pivoting strategies for the Cholesky decomposition. The\nresulting algorithms are more efficient at reducing the uncertainty over a data\nset, can be updated to include information about observations, and additionally\nbenefit from a tailored implementation. We benchmark the effectiveness of the\nnew selection strategies on two tasks important to Gaussian processes: sparse\nregression and inference based on preconditioned iterative solvers.

    "abstract": "Digital signatures are fundamental cryptographic primitives that ensure the\nauthenticity and integrity of digital documents. In the post-quantum era,\nclassical public key-based signature schemes become vulnerable to brute-force\nand key-recovery attacks due to the computational power of quantum algorithms.\nMultivariate polynomial based signature schemes are among the one of the\ncryptographic constructions that offers strong security guarantees against such\nquantum threats. With the growing capabilities of neural networks, it is\nnatural to explore their potential application in the design of cryptographic\nprimitives. Neural networks inherently captures the non-linear relationships\nwithin the data, which are encoded in their synaptic weight matrices and bias\nvectors. In this paper, we propose a novel construction of a multivariate\npolynomial based digital signature scheme that leverages neural network\narchitectures. A neural network with binary weights is employed to define the\ncentral structure of the signature scheme. The design introduces a recurrent\nrandom vector, functionally analogous to an attention mechanism, which\ncontributes dynamic randomness based on the previous state, thereby enhancing\nthe scheme's security. It is demonstrated that the proposed signature scheme\nprovide security against Existential Unforgeability under adaptive\nChosen-Message Attacks (EUF-CMA). Furthermore, it is proven that direct attacks\naimed to recover the private keys are computationally infeasible within\npolynomial time, even in the presence of quantum computing abilities. The\noperational characteristics of the proposed scheme are also evaluated, with\nresults indicating notable efficiency and practical viability in post-quantum\ncryptographic applications.",

    "abstract": "Modern Java projects increasingly adopt static analysis tools that prevent\nnull-pointer exceptions by treating nullness as a type property. However,\nintegrating such tools into large, existing codebases remains a significant\nchallenge. While annotation inference can eliminate many errors automatically,\na subset of residual errors -- typically a mix of real bugs and false positives\n-- often persist and can only be resolved via code changes. Manually addressing\nthese errors is tedious and error-prone. Large language models (LLMs) offer a\npromising path toward automating these repairs, but naively-prompted LLMs often\ngenerate incorrect, contextually-inappropriate edits. Resolving a nullability\nerror demands a deep understanding of how a symbol is used across the codebase,\noften spanning methods, classes, and packages. We present NullRepair, a system\nthat integrates LLMs into a structured workflow for resolving the errors from a\nnullability checker. NullRepair's decision process follows a flowchart derived\nfrom manual analysis of 200 real-world errors. It leverages static analysis to\nidentify safe and unsafe usage regions of symbols, using error-free usage\nexamples to contextualize model prompts. Patches are generated through an\niterative interaction with the LLM that incorporates project-wide context and\ndecision logic. Our evaluation on 12 real-world Java projects shows that\nNullRepair resolves an average of 72% of the errors that remain after applying\na state-of-the-art annotation inference technique. Unlike a naively-prompted\nLLM, NullRepair also largely preserves program semantics, with all unit tests\npassing in 10/12 projects after applying every edit proposed by NullRepair, and\n98% or more tests passing in the remaining two projects.",

Recent advances in large language\nmodels (LLMs) utilize mixture-of-experts (MoE) mechanisms to empower multiple\nIMAs, with each LLM trained individually for a specific task that presents\ndifferent business workflows. In contrast to existing approaches that rely on\nmultiple LLMs for IMAs, this paper presents a novel paradigm that accomplishes\nvarious IMAs using a single compositional LLM over wireless networks. The two\nprimary challenges include 1) guiding a single LLM to adapt to diverse IMA\nobjectives and 2) ensuring the flexibility and efficiency of the LLM in\nresource-constrained mobile environments. To tackle the first challenge, we\npropose ContextLoRA, a novel method that guides an LLM to learn the rich\nstructured context among IMAs by constructing a task dependency graph. We\npartition the learnable parameter matrix of neural layers for each IMA to\nfacilitate LLM composition. Then, we develop a step-by-step fine-tuning\nprocedure guided by task relations, including training, freezing, and masking\nphases. This allows the LLM to learn to reason among tasks for better\nadaptation, capturing the latent dependencies between tasks. For the second\nchallenge, we introduce ContextGear, a scheduling strategy to optimize the\ntraining procedure of ContextLoRA, aiming to minimize computational and\ncommunication costs through a strategic grouping mechanism. Experiments on\nthree benchmarks show the superiority of the proposed ContextLoRA and\nContextGear. Furthermore, we prototype our proposed paradigm on a real-world\nwireless testbed, demonstrating its practical applicability for various IMAs.\nWe will release our code to the community.",

    "abstract": "This article solves the initial boundary value problem for the vacuum\nEinstein equations with a negative cosmological constant in dimension 4, giving\nrise to asymptotically Anti-de Sitter spaces. We introduce a new family of\ngeometric reflective boundary conditions, which can be regarded as the\nhomogeneous Robin boundary conditions, involving both the conformal class and\nthe stress-energy tensor of the timelike conformal boundary. This family\nincludes as a special case the homogeneous Neumann boundary condition,\nconsisting of setting the boundary stress-energy tensor to zero. It also\nagrees, in a limit case, with the homogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition,\nwhere one fixes a locally conformally flat conformal class on the boundary,\nalready covered in Friedrich's pioneering work of 1995.\n  The proof of local existence and uniqueness for this family of boundary\nconditions relies notably on Friedrich's framework and his extended conformal\nEinstein equations. These are rewritten in a tensorial formalism, rather than a\nspinorial one, as it facilitates the comparison with the Fefferman-Graham\nexpansion of asymptotically Anti-de Sitter metrics. Similarly to Friedrich's\nproof, our geometric boundary conditions are eventually inferred from\ngauge-dependent boundary conditions by means of an auxiliary system on the\nconformal boundary.\n  In addition, our analysis also comprises new necessary and sufficient\nconditions for the unphysical fields associated to the initial data to be\nsmooth up to the conformal boundary. Finally, the paper contains examples of\nasymptotically Anti-de Sitter spaces, with a focus on their conformal boundary\ndata.

CoGrader\nwas found effective in improving grading efficiency and consistency while\nproviding reliable peer-comparative feedback to students. We also discuss\ndesign insights and ethical considerations for the development of human-AI\ncollaborative grading systems.",

Most existing ownership protection\nsolutions (e.g., backdoor-based watermarking) are designed for cloud-based\nAI-as-a-Service (AIaaS) and are not directly applicable to large-scale\ndistribution scenarios, where each user-specific model instance must carry a\nunique watermark.

It encodes user-specific $n$-bit binary signatures by independently\nembedding multiple watermarks into a multi-branch Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)\nmodule, enabling efficient watermark customization without retraining through\nbranch swapping. A parameter obfuscation mechanism further entangles the\nwatermark weights with those of the base model, preventing removal without\ndegrading model performance. The method supports black-box verification and is\ncompatible with various model architectures and DL tasks, including\nclassification, image generation, and text generation.

First, the construction\nstrategy of traditional fuzzy time series is improved to further extract short\nand long term temporal interrelation, which enables every time node to\nautomatically possess corresponding global information and inner relationships\namong them in a restricted sliding window and the process does not require\nhuman involvement. Second, a bilateral Atrous algorithm is devised to reduce\ncalculation demand of the proposed model without sacrificing global\ncharacteristics of elements. And it also allows the model to avoid processing\nredundant information. Third, after the transformation of time series, a\npartially asymmetric convolutional architecture is designed to more flexibly\nmine data features by filters in different directions on feature maps, which\ngives the convolutional neural network (CNN) the ability to construct\nsub-windows within existing sliding windows to model at a more fine-grained\nlevel. And after obtaining the time series information at different levels, the\nmulti-scale features from different sub-windows will be sent to the\ncorresponding network layer for time series information fusion. Compared with\nother competitive modern models, the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art\nresults on most of popular time series datasets, which is fully verified by the\nexperimental results.",

Indeed, convergence in the presence of multiple stable\nequilibrium points (EPs) is crucial to implement content addressable memories\nand solve several other signal processing tasks in real time. There are two\ntypical ways to use a convergent NN, i.e.: a) let the activations evolve while\nmaintaining fixed weights and inputs (activation dynamics) or b) adapt the\nweights while maintaining fixed activations (weight dynamics). As remarked in a\nseminal paper by Hirsch, there is another interesting possibility, i.e., let\nthe neuron interconnection weights evolve while simultaneously running the\nactivation dynamics (weight-activation dynamics). The weight-activation\ndynamics is of importance also because it is more plausible than the other two\ntypes for modeling neural systems. The paper breaks new ground by analyzing for\nthe first time in a systematic way the convergence properties of the\nweight-activation dynamics for a class of memristor feedback dynamic NNs. The\nmain result is that, under suitable assumptions on the structure of the\nmemristor interconnections, the solutions (weights and activations) converge to\nan EP, except at most for a set of initial conditions with zero measure.

The key challenge\nlies in identifying which tokens are truly important. Most existing approaches\nrely on attention-based criteria to estimate token importance. However, they\ninherently suffer from certain limitations, such as positional bias. In this\nwork, we explore a new perspective on token importance based on token\ntransitions in LVLMs. We observe that the transition of token representations\nprovides a meaningful signal of semantic information. Based on this insight, we\npropose TransPrune, a training-free and efficient token pruning method.\nSpecifically, TransPrune progressively prunes tokens by assessing their\nimportance through a combination of Token Transition Variation (TTV)-which\nmeasures changes in both the magnitude and direction of token\nrepresentations-and Instruction-Guided Attention (IGA), which measures how\nstrongly the instruction attends to image tokens via attention. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that TransPrune achieves comparable multimodal\nperformance to original LVLMs, such as LLaVA-v1.5 and LLaVA-Next, across eight\nbenchmarks, while reducing inference TFLOPs by more than half. Moreover, TTV\nalone can serve as an effective criterion without relying on attention,\nachieving performance comparable to attention-based methods.

The multiscale\ntemporal dependencies, visual-semantic heterogeneity, and the scarcity of\nlabeled data exhibited by video anomalies collectively present a challenging\nresearch problem in computer vision. This study offers a dual-path architecture\ncalled the Dual-Branch Adaptive Multiscale Spatiotemporal Framework (DAMS),\nwhich is based on multilevel feature decoupling and fusion, enabling efficient\nanomaly detection modeling by integrating hierarchical feature learning and\ncomplementary information. The main processing path of this framework\nintegrates the Adaptive Multiscale Time Pyramid Network (AMTPN) with the\nConvolutional Block Attention Mechanism (CBAM). AMTPN enables multigrained\nrepresentation and dynamically weighted reconstruction of temporal features\nthrough a three-level cascade structure (time pyramid pooling, adaptive feature\nfusion, and temporal context enhancement). CBAM maximizes the entropy\ndistribution of feature channels and spatial dimensions through dual attention\nmapping. Simultaneously, the parallel path driven by CLIP introduces a\ncontrastive language-visual pre-training paradigm. Cross-modal semantic\nalignment and a multiscale instance selection mechanism provide high-order\nsemantic guidance for spatio-temporal features. This creates a complete\ninference chain from the underlying spatio-temporal features to high-level\nsemantic concepts. The orthogonal complementarity of the two paths and the\ninformation fusion mechanism jointly construct a comprehensive representation\nand identification capability for anomalous events.

    "abstract": "Audio effects (AFXs) are essential tools in music production, frequently\napplied in chains to shape timbre and dynamics. The order of AFXs in a chain\nplays a crucial role in determining the final sound, particularly when\nnon-linear (e.g., distortion) or time-variant (e.g., chorus) processors are\ninvolved. Despite its importance, most AFX-related studies have primarily\nfocused on estimating effect types and their parameters from a wet signal. To\naddress this gap, we formulate AFX chain recognition as the task of jointly\nestimating AFX types and their order from a wet signal. We propose a\nneural-network-based method that embeds wet signals into a hyperbolic space and\nclassifies their AFX chains. Hyperbolic space can represent tree-structured\ndata more efficiently than Euclidean space due to its exponential expansion\nproperty. Since AFX chains can be represented as trees, with AFXs as nodes and\nedges encoding effect order, hyperbolic space is well-suited for modeling the\nexponentially growing and non-commutative nature of ordered AFX combinations,\nwhere changes in effect order can result in different final sounds. Experiments\nusing guitar sounds demonstrate that, with an appropriate curvature, the\nproposed method outperforms its Euclidean counterpart. Further analysis based\non AFX type and chain length highlights the effectiveness of the proposed\nmethod in capturing AFX order.",

In this\npaper, we propose a lightweight RSSC framework, which includes a distilled\nglobal filter network (GFNet) model and an early-exit mechanism designed for\nedge devices to achieve state-of-the-art performance. Specifically, we first\napply frequency domain distillation on the GFNet model to reduce model size.\nThen we design a dynamic early-exit model tailored for DNN models on edge\ndevices to further improve model inference efficiency. We evaluate our E3C\nmodel on three edge devices across four datasets. Extensive experimental\nresults show that it achieves an average of 1.3x speedup on model inference and\nover 40% improvement on energy efficiency, while maintaining high\nclassification accuracy.",

Energy management systems oversee their operation, deciding the\nset points of the primary control layer. This paper presents a novel 2-stage\neconomic model predictive controller for electrified buildings including\nphysics-based models of the battery degradation and thermal systems. The\nhierarchical control operates in the Dutch sequential energy markets. In\nparticular common assumptions regarding intra-day markets (auction and\ncontinuous-time) are discussed as well as the coupling of the different storage\nsystems. The best control policy is to co-optimize day-ahead and intra-day\nauctions in the first stage, to later follow intra-day auctions. If no\nintra-day prices are known at the time of the day-ahead auction, its best to\nfollow continuous time intra-day in the summer and the intra-day auction in the\nwinter. Additionally, this sequential operation increases battery degradation.\nFinally, under our controller the realized short-term flexibility of the\nthermal energy storage is marginal compared to the flexibility delivered by\nstatic battery pack and electric vehicles with bidirectional charging.",

    "abstract": "Multi-modal Knowledge Graph Completion (MMKGC) aims to uncover hidden world\nknowledge in multimodal knowledge graphs by leveraging both multimodal and\nstructural entity information.

Existing MMKGC methods typically rely on attention or\ngate-based fusion mechanisms but overlook complementarity contained in\nmulti-modal data. In this paper, we propose a novel framework named Mixture of\nComplementary Modality Experts (MoCME), which consists of a\nComplementarity-guided Modality Knowledge Fusion (CMKF) module and an\nEntropy-guided Negative Sampling (EGNS) mechanism. The CMKF module exploits\nboth intra-modal and inter-modal complementarity to fuse multi-view and\nmulti-modal embeddings, enhancing representations of entities. Additionally, we\nintroduce an Entropy-guided Negative Sampling mechanism to dynamically\nprioritize informative and uncertain negative samples to enhance training\neffectiveness and model robustness.

    "abstract": "Test cases are valuable assets for maintaining software quality. While\nnumerous automated techniques have been proposed for generating tests (either\nby maximizing code coverage or by translating focal code into test code),\npractical tests are seldom driven by coverage alone. In real projects, each\ntest reflects a developer's validation intention for a specific behaviour and\nembodies rich, project-specific knowledge: which specific APIs to call and what\nassertions truly matter. Without considering such knowledge, tests can hardly\npass code review and be integrated into the software product.\n  In this work, we propose IntentionTest, which generates project-specific\ntests with validation intention as a structured description. Our design is\nmotivated by two insights: (1) a description of validation intention, compared\nto coverage and focal code, carries more crucial information about what to\ntest; and (2) practical tests exhibit high code duplication, indicating that\ndomain knowledge is highly reusable for writing new tests. Given a focal code\nand a description of validation intention (in the form of either an informal\ncomment or a formal test plan), IntentionTest retrieves a referable test in the\nproject to guide test generation. Moreover, IntentionTest reduces the test\ngeneration problem into an editing problem on the test code regarding the\nvalidation intention. It generates a test including both test prefix and\noracle, which aims to be executable and semantically correct.\n  We evaluate IntentionTest against state-of-the-art baselines on 4,146 test\ncases from 13 open-source projects. Specifically, compared to ChatTester,\nIntentionTest can (1) generate significantly more semantically correct tests,\nimproving common mutation scores by 39.03% and coverage overlap with\nground-truth tests by 40.14%; (2) generate 21.30% more successful passing\ntests.",

    "abstract": "Here, we report experimental evidence suggesting the emergence of robust,\npossibly chiral, edge states in artificially engineered multilayers composed of\nalternating nanometer-thick layers of nonmagnetic aluminum (Al) and\nferromagnetic nickel (Ni). Using phase-sensitive Josephson interferometry, we\nobserved distinct SQUID-like oscillations (instead of the conventional\nFraunhofer patterns) in the maximum supercurrent versus in-plane probing\nmagnetic field patterns, which can be associated with one-dimensional\ncurrent-carrying modes localized at the sample boundaries. These results were\nobtained for multilayers consisting of up to ten Al/Ni bilayers sandwiched\nbetween superconducting Nb electrodes to form Josephson junctions. The\nspatially confined flow of supercurrent suggests the possible presence of\nchiral Andreev edge states reminiscent of those found in higher-order\ntopological insulators, despite the absence of strong spin-orbit coupling or\nintrinsic topological band structure. The discovery of edge-localized charge\ntransport in structures made of materials without intrinsic topological order\nchallenges the prevailing understanding of topological phenomena and highlights\nthe possibility of developing topological metamaterials as a tunable platform\nfor exploring nontrivial edge physics.",

This paper introduces a\nformal representation framework for INS, inspired by diverse approaches from\nthe state of the art. By providing a consistent vocabulary and modeling\nstructure, the framework facilitates the analysis, the description and\ncomparison of INS properties. Experimental validations on the \"Little Red\nRiding Hood\" scenario highlight the usefulness of the proposed formalism and\nits impact on improving the evaluation of INS.

    ],
    "abstract": "Stream-based monitoring is a well-established runtime verification approach\nwhich relates input streams, representing sensor readings from the monitored\nsystem, with output streams that capture filtered or aggregated results. In\nsuch approaches, the monitor is a passive external component that continuously\nreceives sensor data from the system under observation. This setup assumes that\nthe system dictates what data is sent and when, regardless of the monitor's\ncurrent needs. However, in many applications -- particularly in\nresource-constrained environments like autonomous aircraft, where energy, size,\nor weight are limited -- this can lead to inefficient use of communication\nresources. We propose making the monitor an active component that decides,\nbased on its current internal state, which sensors to query and how often. This\nbehavior is driven by scheduling annotations in the specification, which guide\nthe dynamic allocation of bandwidth towards the most relevant data, thereby\nimproving monitoring efficiency. We demonstrate our approach using the\nstream-based specification language RTLola and assess the performance by\nmonitoring a specification from the aerospace domain.

    "abstract": "Antisocial behavior (ASB) on social media-including hate speech, harassment,\nand trolling-poses growing challenges for platform safety and societal\nwellbeing. While prior work has primarily focused on detecting harmful content\nafter it appears, predictive approaches aim to forecast future harmful\nbehaviors-such as hate speech propagation, conversation derailment, or user\nrecidivism-before they fully unfold. Despite increasing interest, the field\nremains fragmented, lacking a unified taxonomy or clear synthesis of existing\nmethods. This paper presents a systematic review of over 49 studies on ASB\nprediction, offering a structured taxonomy of five core task types: early harm\ndetection, harm emergence prediction, harm propagation prediction, behavioral\nrisk prediction, and proactive moderation support. We analyze how these tasks\ndiffer by temporal framing, prediction granularity, and operational goals. In\naddition, we examine trends in modeling techniques-from classical machine\nlearning to pre-trained language models-and assess the influence of dataset\ncharacteristics on task feasibility and generalization. Our review highlights\nmethodological challenges, such as dataset scarcity, temporal drift, and\nlimited benchmarks, while outlining emerging research directions including\nmultilingual modeling, cross-platform generalization, and human-in-the-loop\nsystems. By organizing the field around a coherent framework, this survey aims\nto guide future work toward more robust and socially responsible ASB\nprediction.",

    "abstract": "The impact of permeability heterogeneity on reactive buoyancy-driven\nconvective dissolution is analyzed numerically in the case of a bimolecular\nA+B$\\to$C reaction across varying Rayleigh numbers. The convective dynamics is\ncompared in homogeneous, horizontally stratified, vertically stratified, and\nlog-normally distributed permeability fields. Key variables, such as the total\namount of product, mixing length, front position and width, reaction and scalar\ndissipation rates, and dissolution fluxes, are strongly influenced by the type\nof permeability heterogeneity. Vertically stratified and log-normally\ndistributed permeability fields lead to larger values for all parameters\ncompared to homogeneous fields. Horizontally stratified fields act as an\nobstacle to convective flow, resulting in slower front progression, thicker\nfingers, wider reaction fronts, and the lowest dissolution fluxes among all\ncases. When the reaction stabilizes convection, flow stagnation occurs near the\nextremum of the non-monotonic density profile, even in vertically stratified\nsystems, highlighting the complex interaction between reactions and\ndissolution-driven convection. In log-normally distributed fields, the flow\nbehavior depends on the permeability structure: smaller horizontal correlation\nlengths cause fingers to spread more horizontally, while larger horizontal\ncorrelation lengths promote more vertical movement with shorter wavelengths.\nOverall, a shorter horizontal correlation length relative to the vertical one\nleads to an increase in the value of all aforementioned parameters and thus to\na more efficient mixing. These findings reveal how heterogeneity affects\nconvective dynamics by influencing the reaction front, dissolution rates,\nmixing behavior, and mass transport efficiency, emphasizing the intricate role\nof permeability structure in reactive convective processes.",

We address this challenge using a\nsemi-empirical approach that connects dark matter halos to observed UV\nluminosity through physically motivated double power-law star formation\nefficiency (SFE) model as a function of halo mass, redshift and perform joint\nBayesian analysis of luminosity functions spanning $z = 4 - 16$ using combined\nHST and JWST data. Through systematic model comparison using information\ncriteria (AIC, BIC, DIC), we identify the optimal framework requiring redshift\nevolution only in the low-mass slope parameter $\\alpha(z)$ while maintaining\nother SFE parameters constant. Our best-fitting model achieves excellent\nagreement with observations using modest, constant UV scatter $\\sigma_{\\rm UV}\n= 0.32$ dex, significantly lower than the $\\gtrsim 1.3$ dex values suggested by\nprevious studies for $z > 13$. This reduced scatter requirement is compensated\nby strongly evolving star formation efficiency, with $\\alpha$ increasing toward\nhigher redshifts, indicating enhanced star formation in low-mass halos during\ncosmic dawn. The model also successfully reproduces another important\nobservational diagnostic such as effective galaxy bias across the full redshift\nrange. Furthermore, model predictions are consistent up to a redshift of $z\\sim\n20$.

In this paper, we propose a\nquantum-classical hybrid Fourier space readout (FSR) method to efficiently\nrecover the underlying function from its corresponding quantum state. We\nprovide explicit quantum circuits, followed by theoretical and numerical\ndiscussions on its complexity. In particular, the complexity on quantum\ncomputers has only a logarithmic dependence on the grid number, while the\ncomplexity on classical computers has a linear dependence on the number of\ntarget points instead of the grid number.

    "abstract": "Differential expression (DE) analysis is a key task in RNA-seq studies,\naiming to identify genes with expression differences across conditions. A\ncentral challenge is balancing false discovery rate (FDR) control with\nstatistical power. Parametric methods such as DESeq2 and edgeR achieve high\npower by modeling gene-level counts using negative binomial distributions and\napplying empirical Bayes shrinkage. However, these methods may suffer from FDR\ninflation when model assumptions are mildly violated, especially in\nlarge-sample settings. In contrast, non-parametric tests like Wilcoxon offer\nmore robust FDR control but often lack power and do not support covariate\nadjustment. We propose Nullstrap-DE, a general add-on framework that combines\nthe strengths of both approaches. Designed to augment tools like DESeq2 and\nedgeR, Nullstrap-DE calibrates FDR while preserving power, without modifying\nthe original method's implementation. It generates synthetic null data from a\nmodel fitted under the gene-specific null (no DE), applies the same test\nstatistic to both observed and synthetic data, and derives a threshold that\nsatisfies the target FDR level. We show theoretically that Nullstrap-DE\nasymptotically controls FDR while maintaining power consistency. Simulations\nconfirm that it achieves reliable FDR control and high power across diverse\nsettings, where DESeq2, edgeR, or Wilcoxon often show inflated FDR or low\npower. Applications to real datasets show that Nullstrap-DE enhances\nstatistical rigor and identifies biologically meaningful genes.",

    "abstract": "A significant fraction of white dwarfs (WDs) host dust/debris disks formed\nfrom the tidal disruption of asteroids and planetsimals. Several studies\nindicate that the disks can attain significant vertical heights through\ncollisional cascade. In this work I model the effects of geometrically thick\ndisks on two primary observables: photometric transits by the disk when viewed\nat high inclinations and infrared dust emission. Specifically, I consider disks\nwith a Gaussian vertical profile with scale heights comparable to or larger\nthan the WD radius. I primarily focus on inclinations $\\gtrsim$$87$ degrees\n('edge-off'), which can produce significant transits with moderate disk\nthickness. Both the transit depth and color become strong functions of\ninclination, and I explore their dependence on the disk parameters. I show that\nsuch a setup can produce the recently discovered reddening in the transit of WD\nJ1013$-$0427. Moving to infrared emission, I show that the contribution from\nthe heated inner rim can be substantial even at high inclinations. It can\npotentially explain the infrared excess observed in two transiting debris\nsystems, WD 1145$+$017 and WD 1232$+$563, consistently with the transits. The\nother two important radiation components are the optically thin dust emission\nfrom the disk's outer layers and the optically thick emission from the\nbackwarmed disk interior. Extending my analysis to G29-38 shows that the former\ncan adequately produce the silicate emission feature. The inner dense layers,\non the other hand, allows the disk to contain a large dust mass. Overall, I\nshow that thick disk effects can be significant and should be taken into\naccount. I motivate detailed studies to quantify the effects accurately.",

Moreover, HYPIR inherits the capabilities of diffusion models with\nrich user control, enabling text-guided restoration and adjustable texture\nrichness.

This\npaper presents a new solution to these challenges, through a FPGA-accelerated\nextreme lightweight model along with a newly proposed knowledge distillation\nframework.

We address this by deploying non-uniform,\nmolecule-adaptive grids that concentrate points where electronic density is\nhigh. Using Voronoi partitions of these grids, the molecular Hamiltonian is\nexpressed in a Hermitian form and in a transcorrelated, isospectral form that\neliminates Coulomb singularities and yields cusp-free eigenfunctions. Both\nformulations slot naturally into quantum eigenvalue solvers: Hermitian Quantum\nPhase Estimation (QPE) and the recent generalised Quantum Eigenvalue Estimation\n(QEVE) protocol for its non-Hermitian, transcorrelated counterpart.

    "abstract": "MRI tumor segmentation remains a critical challenge in medical imaging, where\nvolumetric analysis faces unique computational demands due to the complexity of\n3D data. The spatially sequential arrangement of adjacent MRI slices provides\nvaluable information that enhances segmentation continuity and accuracy, yet\nthis characteristic remains underutilized in many existing models. The spatial\ncorrelations between adjacent MRI slices can be regarded as \"temporal-like\"\ndata, similar to frame sequences in video segmentation tasks. To bridge this\ngap, we propose M-Net, a flexible framework specifically designed for\nsequential image segmentation. M-Net introduces the novel Mesh-Cast mechanism,\nwhich seamlessly integrates arbitrary sequential models into the processing of\nboth channel and temporal information, thereby systematically capturing the\ninherent \"temporal-like\" spatial correlations between MRI slices. Additionally,\nwe define an MRI sequential input pattern and design a Two-Phase Sequential\n(TPS) training strategy, which first focuses on learning common patterns across\nsequences before refining slice-specific feature extraction. This approach\nleverages temporal modeling techniques to preserve volumetric contextual\ninformation while avoiding the high computational cost of full 3D convolutions,\nthereby enhancing the generalizability and robustness of M-Net in sequential\nsegmentation tasks.

DeePO is an adaptive,\ndata-driven approach designed to iteratively compute a feedback gain equivalent\nto the certainty-equivalence LQR gain. Like other data-driven approaches based\non Willems' fundamental lemma, DeePO requires persistently exciting input\nsignals. However, linear state-feedback gains from LQR designs cannot\ninherently produce such inputs. To address this, probing noise is\nconventionally added to the control signal to ensure persistent excitation.\nHowever, the added noise may induce undesirable state perturbations. We first\nidentify two key issues that jeopardize the desired performance of DeePO when\nprobing noise is not added: the convergence of states to the equilibrium point,\nand the convergence of the controller to its optimal value. To address these\nchallenges without relying on probing noise, we propose Perturbation-Free DeePO\n(PFDeePO) built on two fundamental principles. First, the algorithm pauses the\ncontrol gain updating in DeePO process when system states are near the\nequilibrium point. Second, it applies a multiplicative noise, scaled by a mean\nvalue of $1$ as a gain for the control signal, when the controller converges.\nThis approach minimizes the impact of noise as the system approaches\nequilibrium while preserving stability. We demonstrate the effectiveness of\nPFDeePO through simulations, showcasing its ability to eliminate state\nperturbations while maintaining system performance and stability.",

It is therefore desirable to create data-driven models which\neffectively combine these advantages. Such data fusion methods for distributed\nquantities mainly rely on proper orthogonal decomposition as of now, which is a\nlinear method. In this paper, we introduce a non-linear method based on neural\nnetworks combining simulation and measurement data via transfer learning. The\nnetwork training accounts for the heterogeneity of the data, as simulation data\nusually features a high spatial resolution, while measurement data is sparse\nbut more accurate. In a first step, the neural network is trained on simulation\ndata to learn spatial features of the distributed quantities. The second step\ninvolves transfer learning on the measurement data to correct for systematic\nerrors between simulation and measurement by only re-training a small subset of\nthe entire neural network model. This approach is applied to a multilayer\nperceptron architecture and shows significant improvements over the established\nmethod based on proper orthogonal decomposition by producing more physical\nsolutions near nonlinearities. In addition, the neural network provides\nsolutions at arbitrary flow conditions, thus making the model useful for flight\nmechanical design, structural sizing, and certification. As the proposed\ntraining strategy is very general, it can also be applied to more complex\nneural network architectures in the future.",

Specifically, we introduce sine activation into\nthe DL model to restore the broadband nature of PARF signals given the observed\nband-limited and high-frequency PARF data.

In particular, these\nalgorithms introduce implicit residuals which facilitate privacy attacks\ntargeting at unlearned data. We observe that these residuals persist regardless\nof model architectures, parameters, and unlearning algorithms, exposing a new\nattack surface beyond conventional output-based leakage. Based on this insight,\nwe propose the Reminiscence Attack (ReA), which amplifies the correlation\nbetween residuals and membership privacy through targeted fine-tuning\nprocesses. ReA achieves up to 1.90x and 1.12x higher accuracy than prior\nattacks when inferring class-wise and sample-wise membership, respectively. To\nmitigate such residual-induced privacy risk, we develop a dual-phase\napproximate unlearning framework that first eliminates deep-layer unlearned\ndata traces and then enforces convergence stability to prevent models from\n\"pseudo-convergence\", where their outputs are similar to retrained models but\nstill preserve unlearned residuals. Our framework works for both classification\nand generation tasks.

    "abstract": "Speech-driven 3D facial animation aims to generate realistic facial movements\nsynchronized with audio. Traditional methods primarily minimize reconstruction\nloss by aligning each frame with ground-truth. However, this frame-wise\napproach often fails to capture the continuity of facial motion, leading to\njittery and unnatural outputs due to coarticulation. To address this, we\npropose a novel phonetic context-aware loss, which explicitly models the\ninfluence of phonetic context on viseme transitions. By incorporating a viseme\ncoarticulation weight, we assign adaptive importance to facial movements based\non their dynamic changes over time, ensuring smoother and perceptually\nconsistent animations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that replacing the\nconventional reconstruction loss with ours improves both quantitative metrics\nand visual quality. It highlights the importance of explicitly modeling\nphonetic context-dependent visemes in synthesizing natural speech-driven 3D\nfacial animation.

    "abstract": "Existing knowledge graphs (KGs) inevitably contain outdated or erroneous\nknowledge that needs to be removed from knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models.\nTo address this challenge, knowledge unlearning can be applied to eliminate\nspecific information while preserving the integrity of the remaining knowledge\nin KGs. Existing unlearning methods can generally be categorized into exact\nunlearning and approximate unlearning. However, exact unlearning requires high\ntraining costs while approximate unlearning faces two issues when applied to\nKGs due to the inherent connectivity of triples: (1) It fails to fully remove\ntargeted information, as forgetting triples can still be inferred from\nremaining ones. (2) It focuses on local data for specific removal, which\nweakens the remaining knowledge in the forgetting boundary. To address these\nissues, we propose GraphDPO, a novel approximate unlearning framework based on\ndirect preference optimization (DPO). Firstly, to effectively remove forgetting\ntriples, we reframe unlearning as a preference optimization problem, where the\nmodel is trained by DPO to prefer reconstructed alternatives over the original\nforgetting triples. This formulation penalizes reliance on forgettable\nknowledge, mitigating incomplete forgetting caused by KG connectivity.\nMoreover, we introduce an out-boundary sampling strategy to construct\npreference pairs with minimal semantic overlap, weakening the connection\nbetween forgetting and retained knowledge. Secondly, to preserve boundary\nknowledge, we introduce a boundary recall mechanism that replays and distills\nrelevant information both within and across time steps. We construct eight\nunlearning datasets across four popular KGs with varying unlearning rates.\nExperiments show that GraphDPO outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by up to\n10.1% in MRR_Avg and 14.0% in MRR_F1.",

    "abstract": "Photonic neural networks (PNNs) of sufficiently large physical dimensions and\nhigh operation accuracies are envisaged as an ideal candidate for breaking the\nmajor bottlenecks in the current artificial intelligence architectures in terms\nof latency, energy efficiency and computational power. To achieve this vision,\nit is of vital importance to scale up the PNNs and in the meantime reduce the\nhigh demand on the dimensions required by the PNNs. The underlying cause of\nthis strategy is the enormous gap between the scales of photonic and electronic\nintegrated circuits. Here, we demonstrate monolithically integrated optical\nconvolutional processors on thin film lithium niobate (TFLN) to enable\nlarge-scale programmable convolution kernels and in turn greatly reduce the\ndimensions required by the subsequent fully connected layers. Experimental\nvalidation achieves high classification accuracies of 96%/86% on the\nMNIST/Fashion-MNIST datasets and 84.6% on the AG News dataset, while\ndramatically reducing the required subsequent fully connected layer dimensions\nto 196x10 (from 784x10) and 175x4 (from 800x4), respectively. Furthermore, our\ndevices can be driven by commercial field-programmable gate array (FPGA)\nsystems, a unique advantage in addition to their scalable channel number and\nkernel size, our architecture provides a solution to build practical machine\nlearning photonic devices.",

We\nconsider two distinct types of electrons in the system: one with\nSchr\\\"odinger-like dispersion and the other exhibiting Dirac-like behavior.\nRemarkably, we show that, for both electron types, this spin texture induces an\nexotic coexistence of opposite-spin singlet and equal-spin triplet Cooper pairs\nwith finite momentum when proximity-coupled to conventional superconductors.\nThe triplet pairing arises from the intrinsic spin rotation of the\nantiferromagnet and does not require net magnetization or spin-orbit coupling.\nMoreover, we identify an unprecedented and tunable phase difference between\nsinglet and triplet pairings, controllable through junction orientation. This\nmixed pairing state can be experimentally probed via damped oscillations in\norder parameters and 0-$\\pi$ transitions in Josephson junctions.

This paper recognises this very problem and\nstudies sketch quality assessment for the first time -- letting you find these\nbadly drawn ones. Our key discovery lies in exploiting the magnitude ($L_2$\nnorm) of a sketch feature as a quantitative quality metric. We propose\nGeometry-Aware Classification Layer (GACL), a generic method that makes\nfeature-magnitude-as-quality-metric possible and importantly does it without\nthe need for specific quality annotations from humans. GACL sees feature\nmagnitude and recognisability learning as a dual task, which can be\nsimultaneously optimised under a neat cross-entropy classification loss with\ntheoretic guarantee. This gives GACL a nice geometric interpretation (the\nbetter the quality, the easier the recognition), and makes it agnostic to both\nnetwork architecture changes and the underlying sketch representation. Through\na large scale human study of 160,000 \\doublecheck{trials}, we confirm the\nagreement between our GACL-induced metric and human quality perception. We\nfurther demonstrate how such a quality assessment capability can for the first\ntime enable three practical sketch applications. Interestingly, we show GACL\nnot only works on abstract visual representations such as sketch but also\nextends well to natural images on the problem of image quality assessment\n(IQA).

As a\nresult, its potential privacy threats remain largely underestimated, despite FL\nbeing an emerging training method for language models. In this work, we propose\na domain-specific gradient inversion attack named Grab (gradient inversion with\nhybrid optimization). Grab features two alternating optimization processes to\naddress the challenges caused by practical training settings, including a\nsimultaneous optimization on dropout masks between layers for improved token\nrecovery and a discrete optimization for effective token sequencing. Grab can\nrecover a significant portion (up to 92.9% recovery rate) of the private\ntraining data, outperforming the attack strategy of utilizing discrete\noptimization with an auxiliary model by notable improvements of up to 28.9%\nrecovery rate in benchmark settings and 48.5% recovery rate in practical\nsettings.

We adopt a\ncentralized anchor-node strategy to mitigate intra-session drift errors during\nmap merging. In the final stage, centralized anchor-node-based pose graph\noptimization is performed to address intra- and inter-map loop closures for\nglobally consistent map merging. Our framework is evaluated on diverse\nreal-world datasets with dynamic objects and heterogeneous LiDARs, showing\nsuperior performance in loop detection across sensor modalities, robust mapping\nin dynamic environments, and accurate multi-map alignment over existing\nmethods.

    "abstract": "Text-to-Image (T2I) generative models have revolutionized content creation\nbut remain highly sensitive to prompt phrasing, often requiring users to\nrepeatedly refine prompts multiple times without clear feedback. While\ntechniques such as automatic prompt engineering, controlled text embeddings,\ndenoising, and multi-turn generation mitigate these issues, they offer limited\ncontrollability, or often necessitate additional training, restricting the\ngeneralization abilities. Thus, we introduce T2I-Copilot, a training-free\nmulti-agent system that leverages collaboration between (Multimodal) Large\nLanguage Models to automate prompt phrasing, model selection, and iterative\nrefinement. This approach significantly simplifies prompt engineering while\nenhancing generation quality and text-image alignment compared to direct\ngeneration. Specifically, T2I-Copilot consists of three agents: (1) Input\nInterpreter, which parses the input prompt, resolves ambiguities, and generates\na standardized report; (2) Generation Engine, which selects the appropriate\nmodel from different types of T2I models and organizes visual and textual\nprompts to initiate generation; and (3) Quality Evaluator, which assesses\naesthetic quality and text-image alignment, providing scores and feedback for\npotential regeneration. T2I-Copilot can operate fully autonomously while also\nsupporting human-in-the-loop intervention for fine-grained control. On\nGenAI-Bench, using open-source generation models, T2I-Copilot achieves a VQA\nscore comparable to commercial models RecraftV3 and Imagen 3, surpasses\nFLUX1.1-pro by 6.17% at only 16.59% of its cost, and outperforms FLUX.1-dev and\nSD 3.5 Large by 9.11% and 6.36%.

Second, in a\ndedicated ablation study, we show our Difficulty Hiking process is highly\neffective: by increasing average problem difficulty from 5.02 to 5.98, this\nstep lifts AIME25 performance from 46.38\\% to 49.23\\%. The full generation\npipeline, final dataset, and a fine-tuned model form a practical and scalable\ntoolkit for building more capable and efficient mathematical reasoning LLMs.\nSAND-Math dataset is released here:\n\\href{https://huggingface.co/datasets/amd/SAND-MATH}{https://huggingface.co/datasets/amd/SAND-MATH}",

    "abstract": "Recent advances have enabled LLM-powered AI agents to autonomously execute\ncomplex tasks by combining language model reasoning with tools, memory, and web\naccess. But can these systems be trusted to follow deployment policies in\nrealistic environments, especially under attack? To investigate, we ran the\nlargest public red-teaming competition to date, targeting 22 frontier AI agents\nacross 44 realistic deployment scenarios. Participants submitted 1.8 million\nprompt-injection attacks, with over 60,000 successfully eliciting policy\nviolations such as unauthorized data access, illicit financial actions, and\nregulatory noncompliance. We use these results to build the Agent Red Teaming\n(ART) benchmark - a curated set of high-impact attacks - and evaluate it across\n19 state-of-the-art models. Nearly all agents exhibit policy violations for\nmost behaviors within 10-100 queries, with high attack transferability across\nmodels and tasks. Importantly, we find limited correlation between agent\nrobustness and model size, capability, or inference-time compute, suggesting\nthat additional defenses are needed against adversarial misuse. Our findings\nhighlight critical and persistent vulnerabilities in today's AI agents. By\nreleasing the ART benchmark and accompanying evaluation framework, we aim to\nsupport more rigorous security assessment and drive progress toward safer agent\ndeployment.",

However, several\ncritical challenges persist, including the dynamic optimization of network\nresources and UAV trajectories, limited UAV endurance, and imperfect channel\nstate information (CSI). In this paper, we offer new insights into low-altitude\neconomy networking by exploring intelligent UAV-assisted vehicle-to-everything\ncommunication strategies aligned with UAV energy efficiency. Particularly, we\nformulate an optimization problem of joint channel allocation, power control,\nand flight altitude adjustment in UAV-assisted vehicular networks. Taking CSI\nfeedback delay into account, our objective is to maximize the vehicle-to-UAV\ncommunication sum rate while satisfying the UAV's long-term energy constraint.\nTo this end, we first leverage Lyapunov optimization to decompose the original\nlong-term problem into a series of per-slot deterministic subproblems. We then\npropose a diffusion-based deep deterministic policy gradient (D3PG) algorithm,\nwhich innovatively integrates diffusion models to determine optimal channel\nallocation, power control, and flight altitude adjustment decisions. Through\nextensive simulations using real-world vehicle mobility traces, we demonstrate\nthe superior performance of the proposed D3PG algorithm compared to existing\nbenchmark solutions.",

We examined different degrees of confinement in small systems\ncontaining 2-6 particles of different individual swimming velocities and\nshapes. Thanks to the strong repulsive interactions between particles, a\nsustained chasing mode was observed for particle packing fractions above a\ncritical value of 0.25.

Ray2Ray learns the mapping between rays emitted\nfrom a given source and their corresponding rays after passing through a given\noptical system in a physically accurate manner. We train Ray2Ray on nine\noff-the-shelf optical systems, achieving positional errors on the order of\n1{\\mu}m and angular deviations on the order 0.01 degrees in the estimated\noutput rays.

A few studies have\nexplored the use of LLMs in feedback controller design; however, these efforts\nare restricted to overly simplified systems, fixed-structure gain tuning, and\nlack real-world validation. To further investigate LLMs in automatic control,\nthis work targets a key subfield: adaptive control. Inspired by the framework\nof model reference adaptive control (MRAC), we propose an LLM-guided adaptive\ncompensator framework that avoids designing controllers from scratch. Instead,\nthe LLMs are prompted using the discrepancies between an unknown system and a\nreference system to design a compensator that aligns the response of the\nunknown system with that of the reference, thereby achieving adaptivity.\nExperiments evaluate five methods: LLM-guided adaptive compensator, LLM-guided\nadaptive controller, indirect adaptive control, learning-based adaptive\ncontrol, and MRAC, on soft and humanoid robots in both simulated and real-world\nenvironments. Results show that the LLM-guided adaptive compensator outperforms\ntraditional adaptive controllers and significantly reduces reasoning complexity\ncompared to the LLM-guided adaptive controller. The Lyapunov-based analysis and\nreasoning-path inspection demonstrate that the LLM-guided adaptive compensator\nenables a more structured design process by transforming mathematical\nderivation into a reasoning task, while exhibiting strong generalizability,\nadaptability, and robustness.

Similarly, conventional graph coarsening methods,\nthough reducing graph scale, frequently lose fine-grained structural details.\nMPCCL addresses these challenges through an innovative multi-scale coarsening\nstrategy, which progressively condenses the graph while prioritizing the\nmerging of key edges based on global node similarity to preserve essential\nstructural information. It further introduces a one-to-many contrastive\nlearning paradigm, integrating node embeddings with augmented graph views and\ncluster centroids to enhance feature diversity, while mitigating feature\nmasking issues caused by the accumulation of high-frequency node weights during\nmulti-scale coarsening. By incorporating a graph reconstruction loss and KL\ndivergence into its self-supervised learning framework, MPCCL ensures\ncross-scale consistency of node representations.

While widely used for its simplicity and modularity, PTO\ncan lead to suboptimal decisions because the estimation step does not account\nfor the structure of the downstream optimization problem. We study a class of\nproblems where the objective function, evaluated at the PTO decision, is\nasymmetric with respect to estimation errors. This asymmetry causes the\nexpected outcome to be systematically degraded by noise in the parameter\nestimate, as the penalty for underestimation differs from that of\noverestimation. To address this, we develop a data-driven post-estimation\nadjustment that improves decision quality while preserving the practicality and\nmodularity of PTO. We show that when the objective function satisfies a\nparticular curvature condition, based on the ratio of its third and second\nderivatives, the adjustment simplifies to a closed-form expression. This\ncondition holds for a broad range of pricing problems, including those with\nlinear, log-linear, and power-law demand models. Under this condition, we\nestablish theoretical guarantees that our adjustment uniformly and\nasymptotically outperforms standard PTO, and we precisely characterize the\nresulting improvement. Additionally, we extend our framework to multi-parameter\noptimization and settings with biased estimators.

    "abstract": "Cross-domain offline reinforcement learning (RL) seeks to enhance sample\nefficiency in offline RL by utilizing additional offline source datasets. A key\nchallenge is to identify and utilize source samples that are most relevant to\nthe target domain. Existing approaches address this challenge by measuring\ndomain gaps through domain classifiers, target transition dynamics modeling, or\nmutual information estimation using contrastive loss. However, these methods\noften require large target datasets, which is impractical in many real-world\nscenarios. In this work, we address cross-domain offline RL under a limited\ntarget data setting, identifying two primary challenges: (1) Dataset imbalance,\nwhich is caused by large source and small target datasets and leads to\noverfitting in neural network-based domain gap estimators, resulting in\nuninformative measurements; and (2) Partial domain overlap, where only a subset\nof the source data is closely aligned with the target domain. To overcome these\nissues, we propose DmC, a novel framework for cross-domain offline RL with\nlimited target samples. Specifically, DmC utilizes $k$-nearest neighbor\n($k$-NN) based estimation to measure domain proximity without neural network\ntraining, effectively mitigating overfitting. Then, by utilizing this domain\nproximity, we introduce a nearest-neighbor-guided diffusion model to generate\nadditional source samples that are better aligned with the target domain, thus\nenhancing policy learning with more effective source samples. Through\ntheoretical analysis and extensive experiments in diverse MuJoCo environments,\nwe demonstrate that DmC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art cross-domain\noffline RL methods, achieving substantial performance gains.",

To address this challenge in\nthe context of pedestrian crossings - a crucial component of walkability - we\nintroduce a scalable and accurate method for automatically measuring crossing\ndistance at both marked and unmarked crosswalks, applied to America's 100\nlargest cities. First, OpenStreetMap coordinates were used to retrieve\nsatellite imagery of intersections throughout each city, totaling roughly three\nmillion images. Next, Meta's Segment Anything Model was trained on a\nmanually-labelled subset of these images to differentiate drivable from\nnon-drivable surfaces (i.e., roads vs. sidewalks). Third, all available\ncrossing edges from OpenStreetMap were extracted. Finally, crossing edges were\noverlaid on the segmented intersection images, and a grow-cut algorithm was\napplied to connect each edge to its adjacent non-drivable surface (e.g.,\nsidewalk, private property, etc.), thus enabling the calculation of crossing\ndistance. This achieved 93 percent accuracy in measuring crossing distance,\nwith a median absolute error of 2 feet 3 inches (0.69 meters), when compared to\nmanually-verified data for an entire city. Across the 100 largest US cities,\nmedian crossing distance ranges from 32 feet to 78 feet (9.8 to 23.8m), with\ndetectable regional patterns. Median crossing distance also displays a positive\nrelationship with cities' year of incorporation, illustrating in a novel way\nhow American cities increasingly emphasize wider (and more car-centric)\nstreets.",

Machine learning\nmodels trained on DFT data have emerged as a promising alternative, but face\nchallenges such as functional dependency, limited labeled high-fidelity data,\nand interpretability issues.

The model resolves long-standing challenges, such as the \"CO\npuzzle\" and outperforms traditional theories, like the d-band center and Fermi\nsoftness models.

However, this mechanism typically\nrequires large axion-dark photon couplings or some degree of fine-tuning. In\nthis work, we present a new scenario in which efficient dark photon production\narises from axion potentials that are shallower than quadratic at large field\nvalues. For moderately large initial misalignment angles, the oscillation of\nthe axion field can trigger either efficient dark photon production or strong\naxion self-resonance via parametric resonance. When self-resonance dominates\nand disrupts the field's homogeneity, we show that oscillons -- localized,\noscillating axion field configurations -- naturally form and can sustain\ncontinued dark photon production, provided the coupling is $\\gtrsim \\mathcal\nO(1)$. For dark photon mass up to three orders of magnitude below the axion\nmass, the produced dark photons can account for a significant fraction of the\npresent-day dark matter. We support this scenario with numerical lattice\nsimulations of a benchmark model. Our results further motivate experimental\nsearches for ultralight dark photon dark matter.

The SW dynamics was introduced as an attractive\nalternative to the local Glauber dynamics, often offering faster convergence\nrates to stationarity in a variety of settings. A series of works have\ncharacterized the asymptotic behavior of the speed of convergence of the\nmean-field SW dynamics for all $q \\ge 2$ and all values of the inverse\ntemperature parameter $\\beta > 0$. In particular, it is known that when $\\beta\n> q$ the mixing time of the SW dynamics is $\\Theta(\\log n)$. We strengthen this\nresult by showing that for all $\\beta > q$, there exists a constant $c(\\beta,q)\n> 0$ such that the mixing time of the SW dynamics is $c(\\beta,q) \\log n +\n\\Theta(1)$. This implies that the mean-field SW dynamics exhibits the cutoff\nphenomenon in this temperature regime, demonstrating that this Markov chain\nundergoes a sharp transition from ''far from stationarity'' to ''well-mixed''\nwithin a narrow $\\Theta(1)$ time window. The presence of cutoff is\nalgorithmically significant, as simulating the chain for fewer steps than its\nmixing time could lead to highly biased samples.",

Existing methods typically rely on manual intervention to\nselect a reference sub-map as a template and use point cloud matching for\nregistration.

Compared to traditional systems, inter-user\ninterference in SemCom severely degrades key semantic information, often\ncausing worse performance than Gaussian noise under the same power level. To\naddress this challenge, inspired by the recently proposed concept of Orthogonal\nModel Division Multiple Access (OMDMA) that leverages semantic orthogonality\nrooted in the personalized joint source and channel (JSCC) models to\ndistinguish users, we propose a novel, scalable framework that eliminates the\nneed for user-specific JSCC models as did in original OMDMA. Our key innovation\nlies in shuffle-based orthogonalization, where randomly permuting the positions\nof JSCC feature vectors transforms inter-user interference into Gaussian-like\nnoise. By assigning each user a unique shuffling pattern, the interference is\ntreated as channel noise, enabling effective mitigation using diffusion models\n(DMs). This approach not only simplifies system design by requiring a single\nuniversal JSCC model but also enhances privacy, as shuffling patterns act as\nimplicit private keys. Additionally, we extend the framework to scenarios\ninvolving semantically correlated data. By grouping users based on semantic\nsimilarity, a cooperative beamforming strategy is introduced to exploit\nredundancy in correlated data, further improving system performance. Extensive\nsimulations demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art\nmulti-user SemCom frameworks, achieving superior semantic fidelity, robustness\nto interference, and scalability-all without requiring additional training\noverhead.",

    "abstract": "The Security-Constrained Unit Commitment (SCUC) problem presents formidable\ncomputational challenges due to its combinatorial complexity, large-scale\nnetwork dimensions, and numerous security constraints. While conventional\ntemporal decomposition methods achieve computational tractability through fixed\nshort-term time windows, this limited look-ahead capability often results in\nsuboptimal, myopic solutions. We propose an innovative relax-and-cut framework\nthat alleviates these limitations through two key innovations. First, our\nenhanced temporal decomposition strategy maintains integer variables for\nimmediate unit commitment decisions while relaxing integrality constraints for\nfuture time periods, thereby extending the optimization horizon without\ncompromising tractability. Second, we develop a dynamic cutting-plane mechanism\nthat selectively incorporates N-1 contingency constraints during the\nbranch-and-cut process, avoiding the computational burden of complete upfront\nenumeration. The framework optionally employs a Relaxation-Induced Neighborhood\nSearch procedure for additional solution refinement when computational\nresources permit. Comprehensive numerical experiments demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our approach on large-scale systems up to 13,000 buses. The\nproposed method can achieve optimality gaps below 1% while requiring only 20%\nof the computation time of monolithic Gurobi solutions. Compared to existing\ndecomposition approaches, our framework provides superior performance,\nsimultaneously reducing primal gaps by 60% and doubling solution speed. These\nsignificant improvements make our method particularly well-suited for practical\nSCUC implementations where both solution quality and computational efficiency\nare crucial.",

A,\n185 (1894), pp. 71-110] first applied the method of moments (MM) for modeling\ndata as a mixture of one-dimensional Gaussians, moment-based estimation methods\nhave proliferated. Among these methods, the generalized method of moments (GMM)\nimproves the statistical efficiency of MM by weighting the moments\nappropriately. However, the computational complexity and storage complexity of\nMM and GMM grow exponentially with the dimension, making these methods\nimpractical for high-dimensional data or when higher-order moments are\nrequired. Such computational bottlenecks are more severe in GMM since it\nadditionally requires estimating a large weighting matrix.

We apply DGMM to study the parameter estimation problem for weakly\nseparated heteroscedastic low-rank Gaussian mixtures and design a\ncomputationally efficient and numerically stable algorithm that obtains the\nDGMM estimator without explicitly computing or storing the moment tensors. We\nimplement the proposed algorithm and empirically validate the advantages of\nDGMM: in numerical studies, DGMM attains smaller estimation errors while\nrequiring substantially shorter runtime than MM and GMM.

In this\nstudy, we introduce STARN-GAT, a Multi-Modal Spatio-Temporal Graph Attention\nNetwork, which leverages adaptive graph construction and modality-aware\nattention mechanisms to capture these complex relationships. Unlike\nconventional methods, STARN-GAT integrates road network topology, temporal\ntraffic patterns, and environmental context within a unified attention-based\nframework. The model is evaluated on the Fatality Analysis Reporting System\n(FARS) dataset, achieving a Macro F1-score of 85 percent, ROC-AUC of 0.91, and\nrecall of 81 percent for severe incidents. To ensure generalizability within\nthe South Asian context, STARN-GAT is further validated on the ARI-BUET traffic\naccident dataset, where it attains a Macro F1-score of 0.84, recall of 0.78,\nand ROC-AUC of 0.89. These results demonstrate the model's effectiveness in\nidentifying high-risk cases and its potential for deployment in real-time,\nsafety-critical traffic management systems. Furthermore, the attention-based\narchitecture enhances interpretability, offering insights into contributing\nfactors and supporting trust in AI-assisted decision-making. Overall, STARN-GAT\nbridges the gap between advanced graph neural network techniques and practical\napplications in road safety analytics.",

To address these problems, we propose MaXsive, a training-free\ndiffusion model generative watermarking technique that has high capacity and\nrobustness.

The arm with\na higher probability of advancing will be allocated more resources.\nExperimental results show that BOASF is effective for speeding up the model\nselection and hyperparameter optimization processes while achieving robust and\nbetter prediction performance than the existing state-of-the-art automatic\nmachine learning methods.

    "abstract": "The transformer architecture, which processes sequences of input tokens to\nproduce outputs for query tokens, has revolutionized numerous areas of machine\nlearning. A defining feature of transformers is their ability to perform\npreviously unseen tasks using task-specific prompts without updating\nparameters, a phenomenon known as in-context learning (ICL). Recent research\nhas actively explored the training dynamics behind ICL, with much of the focus\non relatively simple tasks such as linear regression and binary classification.\nTo advance the theoretical understanding of ICL, this paper investigates more\ncomplex nonlinear regression tasks, aiming to uncover how transformers acquire\nin-context learning capabilities in these settings. We analyze the stage-wise\ndynamics of attention during training: attention scores between a query token\nand its target features grow rapidly in the early phase, then gradually\nconverge to one, while attention to irrelevant features decays more slowly and\nexhibits oscillatory behavior. Our analysis introduces new proof techniques\nthat explicitly characterize how the nature of general non-degenerate\nL-Lipschitz task functions affects attention weights. Specifically, we identify\nthat the Lipschitz constant L of nonlinear function classes as a key factor\ngoverning the convergence dynamics of transformers in ICL. Leveraging these\ninsights, for two distinct regimes depending on whether L is below or above a\nthreshold, we derive different time bounds to guarantee near-zero prediction\nerror. Notably, despite the convergence time depending on the underlying task\nfunctions, we prove that query tokens consistently attend to prompt tokens with\nhighly relevant features at convergence, demonstrating the ICL capability of\ntransformers for unseen functions.",
