    "abstract": "Audio-visual feature synchronization for real-time speech enhancement in\nhearing aids represents a progressive approach to improving speech\nintelligibility and user experience, particularly in strong noisy backgrounds.\nThis approach integrates auditory signals with visual cues, utilizing the\ncomplementary description of these modalities to improve speech\nintelligibility. Audio-visual feature synchronization for real-time SE in\nhearing aids can be further optimized using an efficient feature alignment\nmodule. In this study, a lightweight cross-attentional model learns robust\naudio-visual representations by exploiting large-scale data and simple\narchitecture. By incorporating the lightweight cross-attentional model in an\nAVSE framework, the neural system dynamically emphasizes critical features\nacross audio and visual modalities, enabling defined synchronization and\nimproved speech intelligibility. The proposed AVSE model not only ensures high\nperformance in noise suppression and feature alignment but also achieves\nreal-time processing with minimal latency (36ms) and energy consumption.\nEvaluations on the AVSEC3 dataset show the efficiency of the model, achieving\nsignificant gains over baselines in perceptual quality (PESQ:0.52),\nintelligibility (STOI:19\\%), and fidelity (SI-SDR:10.10dB).",

    "abstract": "Simulating aging in 3D brain MRI scans can reveal disease progression\npatterns in neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. Current deep\nlearning-based generative models typically approach this problem by predicting\nfuture scans from a single observed scan. We investigate modeling brain aging\nvia linear models in the latent space of convolutional autoencoders (MRExtrap).\nOur approach, MRExtrap, is based on our observation that autoencoders trained\non brain MRIs create latent spaces where aging trajectories appear\napproximately linear. We train autoencoders on brain MRIs to create latent\nspaces, and investigate how these latent spaces allow predicting future MRIs\nthrough linear extrapolation based on age, using an estimated latent\nprogression rate $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$. For single-scan prediction, we propose\nusing population-averaged and subject-specific priors on linear progression\nrates. We also demonstrate that predictions in the presence of additional scans\ncan be flexibly updated using Bayesian posterior sampling, providing a\nmechanism for subject-specific refinement. On the ADNI dataset, MRExtrap\npredicts aging patterns accurately and beats a GAN-based baseline for\nsingle-volume prediction of brain aging. We also demonstrate and analyze\nmulti-scan conditioning to incorporate subject-specific progression rates.\nFinally, we show that the latent progression rates in MRExtrap's linear\nframework correlate with disease and age-based aging patterns from previously\nstudied structural atrophy rates. MRExtrap offers a simple and robust method\nfor the age-based generation of 3D brain MRIs, particularly valuable in\nscenarios with multiple longitudinal observations.",

We propose a novel\napproach that enhances translation for low-resource languages by integrating an\nexternal dictionary tool and training models end-to-end using reinforcement\nlearning, in addition to supervised fine-tuning. Focusing on the\nSpanish-Wayuunaiki language pair, we frame translation as a tool-augmented\ndecision-making problem in which the model can selectively consult a bilingual\ndictionary during generation. Our method combines supervised instruction tuning\nwith Guided Reward Policy Optimization (GRPO), enabling the model to learn both\nwhen and how to use the tool effectively. BLEU similarity scores are used as\nrewards to guide this learning process. Preliminary results show that our\ntool-augmented models achieve up to +3.37 BLEU improvement over previous work,\nand a 18% relative gain compared to a supervised baseline without dictionary\naccess, on the Spanish-Wayuunaiki test set from the AmericasNLP 2025 Shared\nTask. We also conduct ablation studies to assess the effects of model\narchitecture and training strategy, comparing Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct with other\nmodels such as LLaMA and a prior NLLB-based system.

Agents are visually\nrepresented with face photos from the KDEF database and endowed with one of\nthree classifiers trained on the JAFFE (poor), CK+ (medium), or KDEF (high)\ndatasets. Agents communicate locally on a 2D toroidal lattice, perceiving\nneighbors' emotional state based on their classifier and responding with\nmovement toward perceived positive emotions and away from perceived negative\nemotions. Note that the agents respond to perceived, instead of ground-truth,\nemotions, introducing systematic misperception and frustration. A battery of\nexperiments is carried out on homogeneous and heterogeneous populations and\nscenarios with repeated emotional shocks. Results show that low-accuracy\nclassifiers on the part of the agent reliably result in diminished trust,\nemotional disintegration into sadness, and disordered social organization. By\ncontrast, the agent that develops high accuracy develops hardy emotional\nclusters and resilience to emotional disruptions.

This construction extends kernel-based methods\nand overcomes the incompleteness of MMD on non-compact spaces. Viewed as an\nintegral probability metric (IPM), QPMs have dual functions that uniformly\napproximate all bounded, uniformly continuous functions on $\\mathbb{R}^n$,\noffering enhanced sensitivity to subtle distributional differences in high\ndimensions. For empirical distributions, QPMs are readily calculated using\neigenvalue methods, with analytic gradients suited for learning and\noptimization.

Second, monitor scaffolding matters more than monitor\nawareness: the hybrid scaffolding consistently outperforms baseline monitor\nscaffolding, and can enable weaker models to reliably monitor stronger agents\n-- a weak-to-strong scaling effect. Third, in a human-in-the-loop setting where\nhumans discuss with the LLM monitor to get an updated judgment for the agent's\nbehavior, targeted human oversight is most effective; escalating only\npre-flagged cases to human reviewers improved the TPR by approximately 15% at\nFPR = 0.01.

In this work we study how much information the\nattacker needs for membership inference by investigating the sample\ncomplexity-the minimum number of reference samples required-for a successful\nattack. We study this question in the fundamental setting of Gaussian mean\nestimation where the learning algorithm is given $n$ samples from a Gaussian\ndistribution $\\mathcal{N}(\\mu,\\Sigma)$ in $d$ dimensions, and tries to estimate\n$\\hat\\mu$ up to some error $\\mathbb{E}[\\|\\hat \\mu - \\mu\\|^2_{\\Sigma}]\\leq\n\\rho^2 d$.

Aims: We aim to identify member stars, detect and\nanalyze tidal tails in five open clusters, BH 164, Alessi 2, NGC 2281, NGC\n2354, and M67, of ages between 60 Myr and 4 Gyr. These clusters were selected\nbased on the previous evidence of extended tidal structures. Methods: We\nutilized machine learning algorithms such as Density-Based Spatial Clustering\nof Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA),\nalong with statistical methods to analyze the kinematic, photometric, and\nastrometric properties of stars. Key characteristics of tidal tails, including\nradial velocity, color-magnitude diagram, and spatial projections in the\ntangent plane beyond the cluster's Jacobi radius ($r_J$), were used to detect\nthem. We used N-body simulations to visualize and compare the observables with\nreal data. Further analysis was done on the detected cluster and tail stars to\nstudy their internal dynamics and populations, including binary fraction. We\nalso applied the residual velocity method to detect rotational patterns in the\nclusters and their tails. Results: We identified tidal tails in all five\nclusters, with detected tails extending farther in some clusters and containing\nsignificantly more stars than previously reported (tails ranging from 40 to 100\npc, one to four times the Jacobi radius, with 100 - 200 tail stars). The\nluminosity functions of the tails and their parent clusters were generally\nconsistent, and tails lacked massive stars. In general, the binary fraction was\nfound to be higher in the tidal tails. Significant rotation was detected in M67\nand NGC 2281 for the first time.",

This approach ensures strong performance\nwhile reducing the need for retraining, and it generalizes well across\ndifferent domains with varying data distributions and feature spaces.\nExperiments show that ReLATE+ reduces computational overhead by an average of\n77.68%, enhancing adversarial resilience and streamlining robust model\nselection, all without sacrificing performance, within 2.02% of Oracle.",

In Fulton, there is no statistical evidence that in-person voting was\nsuppressed in precincts closed by bomb threats.",

It can be convenient to express such models as neural\nPDEs rather than using traditional numerical PDE solvers by replacing part or\nall of the PDE's governing equations with a neural network representation.\nNeural PDEs are often easier to differentiate, linearize, reduce, or use for\nuncertainty quantification than the original numerical solver. They are usually\ntrained on solution trajectories obtained by long time integration of the PDE\nsolver. Here we propose a more sample-efficient data-augmentation strategy for\ngenerating neural PDE training data from a computer model by space-filling\nsampling of local \"stencil\" states. This approach removes a large degree of\nspatiotemporal redundancy present in trajectory data and oversamples states\nthat may be rarely visited but help the neural PDE generalize across the state\nspace. We demonstrate that accurate neural PDE stencil operators can be learned\nfrom synthetic training data generated by the computational equivalent of 10\ntimesteps' worth of numerical simulation. Accuracy is further improved if we\nassume access to a single full-trajectory simulation from the computer model,\nwhich is typically available in practice. Across several PDE systems, we show\nthat our data-augmented synthetic stencil data yield better trained neural\nstencil operators, with clear performance gains compared with naively sampled\nstencil data from simulation trajectories.",

CA is achieved by\ncombining two or more carriers and providing a virtual, wider overall bandwidth\nto high-demand users of the system. CA was introduced in the 4G/LTE wireless\nera and has been proven effective in 5G as well, where it is said to play a\nsignificant role in efficient network capacity management. Given this success,\nthe satellite communication (SatCom) community has put its attention into CA\nand the potential benefits it can bring in terms of better spectrum utilization\nand better meeting the user traffic demand. While the theoretical evaluation of\nCA for SatCom has already been presented in several works, this article\npresents the design and results obtained with an experimentation testbed based\non Software Defined Radio (SDR) and a satellite channel emulator. We first\npresent the detailed implementation design, which includes a Gateway (GW)\nmodule responsible for PDU-scheduling across the aggregated carriers, and a\nUser Terminal (UT) module responsible for aggregating the multiple received\nstreams. The second part of the article presents the experimental evaluation,\nincluding CA over a single Geostationary (GEO) satellite, CA over a single\nMedium Earth Orbit (MEO) satellite, and CA combining carriers sent over GEO and\nMEO satellites. A key contribution of this work is the explicit consideration\nof multi-orbit scenarios in the testbed design and validation.

The purpose of this study was\nto extend prior benchmarks focused only on surface streets to additionally\ncapture freeway crash risk for future ADS safety performance assessments. Using\npublicly available police-reported crash and vehicle miles traveled (VMT) data,\nthe methodology details the isolation of in-transport passenger vehicles, road\ntype classification, and crash typology. Key findings revealed that freeway\ncrash rates exhibit large geographic dependence variations with\nany-injury-reported crash rates being nearly 3.5 times higher in Atlanta (2.4\nIPMM; the highest) when compared to Phoenix (0.7 IPMM; the lowest). The results\nshow the critical need for location-specific benchmarks to avoid biased safety\nevaluations and provide insights into the vehicle miles traveled (VMT) required\nto achieve statistical significance for various safety impact levels. The\ndistribution of crash types depended on the outcome severity level. Higher\nseverity outcomes (e.g., fatal crashes) had a larger proportion of\nsingle-vehicle, vulnerable road users (VRU), and opposite-direction collisions\ncompared to lower severity (police-reported) crashes. Given heterogeneity in\ncrash types by severity, performance in low-severity scenarios may not be\npredictive of high-severity outcomes. These benchmarks are additionally used to\nquantify at the required mileage to show statistically significant deviations\nfrom human performance. This is the first paper to generate freeway-specific\nbenchmarks for ADS evaluation and provides a foundational framework for future\nADS benchmarking by evaluators and developers.",

    "abstract": "Accurate subsurface reservoir pressure control is extremely challenging due\nto geological heterogeneity and multiphase fluid-flow dynamics. Predicting\nbehavior in this setting relies on high-fidelity physics-based simulations that\nare computationally expensive. Yet, the uncertain, heterogeneous properties\nthat control these flows make it necessary to perform many of these expensive\nsimulations, which is often prohibitive. To address these challenges, we\nintroduce a physics-informed machine learning workflow that couples a fully\ndifferentiable multiphase flow simulator, which is implemented in the DPFEHM\nframework with a convolutional neural network (CNN). The CNN learns to predict\nfluid extraction rates from heterogeneous permeability fields to enforce\npressure limits at critical reservoir locations. By incorporating transient\nmultiphase flow physics into the training process, our method enables more\npractical and accurate predictions for realistic injection-extraction scenarios\ncompare to previous works. To speed up training, we pretrain the model on\nsingle-phase, steady-state simulations and then fine-tune it on full multiphase\nscenarios, which dramatically reduces the computational cost. We demonstrate\nthat high-accuracy training can be achieved with fewer than three thousand\nfull-physics multiphase flow simulations -- compared to previous estimates\nrequiring up to ten million. This drastic reduction in the number of\nsimulations is achieved by leveraging transfer learning from much less\nexpensive single-phase simulations.",

    "abstract": "Several algorithms for the construction of orthogonal drawings of graphs,\nincluding those based on the Topology-Shape-Metrics (TSM) paradigm, tend to\nprioritize the minimization of crossings. This emphasis has two notable side\neffects: some edges are drawn with unnecessarily long sequences of segments and\nbends, and the overall drawing area may become excessively large. As a result,\nthe produced drawings often lack geometric uniformity. Moreover, orthogonal\ncrossings are known to have a limited impact on readability, suggesting that\ncrossing minimization may not always be the optimal goal. In this paper, we\nintroduce a methodology that 'subverts' the traditional TSM pipeline by\nfocusing on minimizing bends. Given a graph $G$, we ideally seek to construct a\nrectilinear drawing of $G$, that is, an orthogonal drawing with no bends. When\nnot possible, we incrementally subdivide the edges of $G$ by introducing dummy\nvertices that will (possibly) correspond to bends in the final drawing. This\nprocess continues until a rectilinear drawing of a subdivision of the graph is\nfound, after which the final coordinates are computed. We tackle the\n(NP-complete) rectilinear drawability problem by encoding it as a SAT formula\nand solving it with state-of-the-art SAT solvers. If the SAT formula is\nunsatisfiable, we use the solver's proof to determine which edge to subdivide.\nOur implementation, DOMUS, which is fairly simple, is evaluated through\nextensive experiments on small- to medium-sized graphs. The results show that\nit consistently outperforms OGDF's TSM-based approach across most standard\ngraph drawing metrics.",

    "abstract": "Analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) play a critical role in digital signal\nacquisition across various applications, but their performance is inherently\nconstrained by sampling rates and bit budgets. This bit budget imposes a\ntrade-off between dynamic range (DR) and digital resolution, with ADC energy\nconsumption scaling linearly with sampling rate and exponentially with bit\ndepth. To bypass this, numerous approaches, including oversampling with\nlow-resolution ADCs, have been explored. A prominent example is 1-Bit ADCs with\nSigma-Delta Quantization (SDQ), a widely used consumer-grade solution. However,\nSDQs suffer from overloading or saturation issues, limiting their ability to\nhandle inputs with arbitrary DR. The Unlimited Sensing Framework (USF)\naddresses this challenge by injecting modulo non-linearity in hardware,\nresulting in a new digital sensing technology. In this paper, we introduce a\nnovel 1-Bit sampling architecture that extends both conventional 1-Bit SDQ and\nUSF. Our contributions are twofold: (1) We generalize the concept of noise\nshaping beyond the Fourier domain, allowing the inclusion of non-bandlimited\nsignals in the Fourier domain but bandlimited in alternative transform domains.\n(2) Building on this generalization, we develop a new transform-domain recovery\nmethod for 1-Bit USF. When applied to the Fourier domain, our method\ndemonstrates superior performance compared to existing time-domain techniques,\noffering reduced oversampling requirements and improved robustness. Extensive\nnumerical experiments validate our findings, laying the groundwork for a\nbroader generalization of 1-Bit sampling systems.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are prone to critical failure modes, including\n\\textit{intrinsic faithfulness hallucinations} (also known as confabulations),\nwhere a response deviates semantically from the provided context. Frameworks\ndesigned to detect this, such as Semantic Divergence Metrics (SDM), rely on\nidentifying latent topics shared between prompts and responses, typically by\napplying geometric clustering to their sentence embeddings. This creates a\ndisconnect, as the topics are optimized for spatial proximity, not for the\ndownstream information-theoretic analysis. In this paper, we bridge this gap by\ndeveloping a principled topic identification method grounded in the\nDeterministic Information Bottleneck (DIB) for geometric clustering. Our key\ncontribution is to transform the DIB method into a practical algorithm for\nhigh-dimensional data by substituting its intractable KL divergence term with a\ncomputationally efficient upper bound. The resulting method, which we dub UDIB,\ncan be interpreted as an entropy-regularized and robustified version of K-means\nthat inherently favors a parsimonious number of informative clusters. By\napplying UDIB to the joint clustering of LLM prompt and response embeddings, we\ngenerate a shared topic representation that is not merely spatially coherent\nbut is fundamentally structured to be maximally informative about the\nprompt-response relationship. This provides a superior foundation for the SDM\nframework and offers a novel, more sensitive tool for detecting confabulations.",

This question is especially timely as new humor types\ncontinuously emerge in online and social media contexts (e.g., memes,\nanti-humor, AI fails). If Large Language Models (LLMs) are to keep up with this\nevolving landscape, they must be able to generalize across humor types by\ncapturing deeper, transferable mechanisms. To investigate this, we conduct a\nseries of transfer learning experiments across four datasets, representing\ndifferent humor tasks. We train LLMs under varied diversity settings (1-3\ndatasets in training, testing on a novel task). Experiments reveal that models\nare capable of some transfer, and can reach up to 75% accuracy on unseen\ndatasets; training on diverse sources improves transferability (1.88-4.05%)\nwith minimal-to-no drop in in-domain performance.

Although both approaches provide\nsteady-state reactive power-voltage droop characteristics, their impacts on\nhigh-frequency (HF) stability differ significantly. Firstly, on open-loop (OL)\ncomparison reveals that droop-I control alters HF pole locations. The\napplication of Routh's Stability Criterion further analytically demonstrates\nthat such pole shifts inevitably lead to OL instability. This HF OL instability\nis identified as a structural phenomenon in purely inductive grids and cannot\nbe mitigated through control parameter tuning. As a result, droop-I control\nsignificantly degrades HF stability, making conventional gain and phase margins\ninsufficient for evaluating robustness against parameter variations. Then, the\nperformance of established active damping (AD) is assessed for both control\nschemes. The finding indicates that AD designs effective for droop control may\nfail to suppress HF resonance under droop-I control due to the presence of\nunstable OL poles.

Emission from stars is included according to age-dependent\nspectra, and a redshift-dependent UV background. The inclusion of RT results in\nthe formation of eight additional faint dwarf galaxies with stellar masses of\n$10^{4}$ M$_{\\odot}$ to several $10^{5}$ M$_{\\odot}$ and only old stellar\npopulations, similar to the observed Ultra-Faint Dwarf galaxies. They formed\nbefore and during cosmic reionisation and were mostly quenched by $z \\sim 3-4$.\nThe simulated galaxies follow many observed scaling relations such as the\nstellar mass-halo mass relation, the mass-size relation, and the\nluminosity-velocity dispersion relation. For the more massive dwarf galaxies,\nradiative feedback suppresses star formation, making it less bursty and\nreducing explosive outflows. This consequently reduces the dark matter core\nsizes by a factor of 2-3, rendering the core sizes ($\\sim$ 1 kpc) more\nconsistent with observations. The distribution of HI in the circumgalactic\nmedium (CGM) is ubiquitous with a covering fraction of unity within $R_{vir}$,\nin good agreement with observations. It is rather insensitive to radiative or\nSN feedback at $z=0$, but at $z>5$ it is much higher in the RT simulation. In\ncontrast, the distribution of low ions like SiII is very compact and declines\nsharply beyond the ISM scale. CIV and OVI have a more extended distribution,\nbut their column densities are generally below the detection limit. Radiative\nfeedback leads to smaller column densities of the metal ions, partly due to the\nreduction of total metal production, and partly because hard photons from the\nstellar radiation escape the ISM and further ionise the CGM. The abundance of\nCIV is particularly sensitive to the latter effect.",

    "abstract": "Recent gravitational-wave (GW) observations offer a unique opportunity to\nprobe the fundamental nature of compact objects. A growing body of research has\nfocused on exploring the role of dark matter (DM) through the concept of\nDM-admixed neutron stars (NSs), where the presence of DM can significantly\nalter key physical properties of NSs, such as their mass, radius, and tidal\ndeformability, ultimately affecting the predicted GW waveform emitted during\nbinary coalescences. In this work, we present a novel observational test that,\nfor the first time, places constraints on the influence of DM inside NSs using\nreal GW data. By reanalyzing signals from events such as GW230529, GW200115,\nand GW200105, we derive new upper bounds on the DM fraction, $F_{\\chi}$, and\nparticle mass, $m_{\\chi}$, under the assumption that DM is described by a\nscalar field with a self-interaction potential. We find that the upper bound on\n$F_{\\chi}$ depends on the specific binary system under analysis, indicating\nthat different DM configurations can be consistent with observations in\ndifferent ways. In particular, the event GW190814 may be compatible with a DM\nhalo configuration. In contrast, the other events analyzed (GW230529, GW200105\nand GW200115) are consistent with DM forming a core inside the NS, yielding\nstrong upper bounds on $F_{\\chi}$. The corresponding values for the mass scale\n$m_{\\chi}$ are also discussed in the text. This work offers a new approach to\nprobing DM in the context of compact NS objects through GW observations.",

Like the Jacob's\nLadder toy, FlipWalker features two interconnected segments joined by flexible\ncables, enabling it to pivot and flip around singularities in a manner\nreminiscent of the toy's cascading motion. Actuation is provided by\nmotor-driven legs within each segment that push off either the ground or the\nopposing segment, depending on the robot's current configuration. A\nphysics-based model of the underactuated flipping dynamics is formulated to\nelucidate the critical design parameters governing forward motion and obstacle\nclearance or climbing. The untethered prototype weighs 0.78 kg, achieves a\nmaximum flipping speed of 0.2 body lengths per second. Experimental trials on\nartificial grass, river rocks, and snow demonstrate that FlipWalker's flipping\nstrategy, which relies on ground reaction forces applied normal to the surface,\noffers a promising alternative to traditional locomotion for navigating\nirregular outdoor terrain.",

    "abstract": "Efficient multi-core parallel processing of recursive join queries is\ncritical for achieving good performance in graph database management systems\n(GDBMSs). Prior work adopts two broad approaches. First is the state of the art\nmorsel-driven parallelism, whose vanilla application in GDBMSs parallelizes\ncomputations at the source node level. Second is to parallelize each iteration\nof the computation at the frontier level. We show that these approaches can be\nseen as part of a design space of morsel dispatching policies based on picking\ndifferent granularities of morsels. We then empirically study the question of\nwhich policies parallelize better in practice under a variety of datasets and\nquery workloads that contain one to many source nodes. We show that these two\npolicies can be combined in a hybrid policy that issues morsels both at the\nsource node and frontier levels. We then show that the multi-source\nbreadth-first search optimization from prior work can also be modeled as a\nmorsel dispatching policy that packs multiple source nodes into multi-source\nmorsels. We implement these policies inside a single system, the Kuzu GDBMS,\nand evaluate them both within Kuzu and across other systems. We show that the\nhybrid policy captures the behavior of both source morsel-only and frontier\nmorsel-only policies in cases when these approaches parallelize well, and\nout-perform them on queries when they are limited, and propose it as a robust\napproach to parallelizing recursive queries. We further show that assigning\nmulti-sources is beneficial, as it reduces the amount of scans, but only when\nthere is enough sources in the query.",

    "abstract": "Fictitious play (FP) is a well-studied algorithm that enables agents to learn\nNash equilibrium in games with certain reward structures. However, when agents\nhave no prior knowledge of the reward functions, FP faces a major challenge:\nthe joint action space grows exponentially with the number of agents, which\nslows down reward exploration. Anonymous games offer a structure that mitigates\nthis issue. In these games, the rewards depend only on the actions taken; not\non who is taking which action. Under such a structure, we introduce aggregate\nfictitious play (agg-FP), a variant of FP where each agent tracks the frequency\nof the number of other agents playing each action, rather than these agents'\nindividual actions. We show that in anonymous polymatrix games, agg-FP\nconverges to a Nash equilibrium under the same conditions as classical FP. In\nessence, by aggregating the agents' actions, we reduce the action space without\nlosing the convergence guarantees. Using simulations, we provide empirical\nevidence on how this reduction accelerates convergence.",

However, corneal\ndosimetry remains underexplored due to historical focus and measurement\nchallenges. This study uses a high-resolution digital eye phantom in Monte\nCarlo simulations to estimate corneal and lens doses for nuclear medicine\nstaff, with and without lead glasses. Method: The Monte Carlo code GATE\n(version 9.0) based on GEANT4 (version 10.6) was used to estimate and compare\ndoses in a digital eye phantom, accounting for primary and scattered radiation\nfrom common radionuclides (F18, I131, Tc99m) with varying lead glass shielding\n(0 to 0.75 mm). Results: Across all radionuclides, the dose to the cornea was\nconsistently higher than the dose to the lens. Notably, the ratio of corneal to\nlens dose increased with thicker lead glasses, indicating a greater dose\nreduction to the lens compared to the cornea. Conclusion: The findings show\nthat corneal doses from all studied radionuclides exceeded lens doses. Although\nincreasing lead glass thickness reduced both, the reduction was more\nsignificant for the lens, raising the cornea-to-lens dose ratio. This trend\nsuggests that while thicker lead glasses enhance lens protection, their\npracticality may be limited due to diminishing returns and potential\ndiscomfort.

To address these challenges, we\npropose Agreement-based Reflective Inference System (ARIS), a hybrid approach\ncombining a Self Mixture of Agents with a discriminative sequence tagger. ARIS\nexplicitly leverages structured model consensus, confidence-based filtering,\nand an LLM reflective inference module to reliably resolve ambiguities and\nenhance overall event prediction quality. We further investigate decomposed\ninstruction fine-tuning for enhanced LLM event extraction understanding.\nExperiments demonstrate our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art\nevent extraction methods across three benchmark datasets.",

Most\nimportantly, the emerging fields offer valuable insights into how energy and\nmass are transferred to the upper solar atmosphere. As a result, they have\ngarnered significant attention from both observational and theoretical\nperspectives. In this article, we present two models of quiet-Sun-like magnetic\nfields generated by the Bifrost code. We compare these models with observations\nfrom the Swedish 1-meter Solar Telescope (SST) and the Interface Region Imaging\nSpectrograph (IRIS). By tracking the magnetic features in both the SST and\nBifrost data, we determine the similarities and differences between the fields\nidentified in the models and those observed. We conduct a quantitative\ncomparison of various properties, such as flux content, flux densities,\nhorizontal and line-of-sight velocities, lifetimes, sizes, and surface\ninteractions. Additionally, we identify and analyze the properties of the\nlargest emerging bipoles in the SST and Bifrost data. Our findings indicate\nthat the magnetic bipoles in the Bifrost simulations are generally stronger\nthan those observed with the SST. However, a qualitative comparison of the\nchromospheric and transition region responses to the emerging fields in the\nBifrost models, SST, and IRIS observations shows similar heating processes\noccurring above and around the emerging fields.

Observing at that frequency it is possible to obtain information on\nthe electrons spectrum at energies where the effect of turbulent reacceleration\nbecomes sub-dominant with respect to energy losses, and therefore to obtain\ninformation on the properties of seed electrons. Under the assumption that dark\nmatter particles are neutralino-like particles annihilating at a rate close to\nthe maximum allowed by Fermi-LAT upper limits in dwarf galaxies, we obtain some\nconstraints on the intensity of the reacceleration and on the value of the\nneutralino mass. In particular, models with mass of the order of 10 GeV are\ngenerally disfavored, because they produce a high-frequency radio spectrum that\ncan not reproduce the possible flattening observed between 5 and 6.6 GHz; on\nthe other hand, models with mass of the order of 500 GeV, in order to reproduce\nthe observed spectrum at frequencies below 100 MHz, require a reacceleration\nphase longer than $10^9$ yr, which would require more than one event\nresponsible of the generation of turbulence in the cluster.

To best preserve and leverage the synthesized knowledge\nbase, our method adapts to the target task by fine-tuning only the principal\nsingular values of the merged matrix.

We introduce NCMemo (Node Classification Memorization), the\nfirst framework to quantify label memorization in semi-supervised node\nclassification. We first establish an inverse relationship between memorization\nand graph homophily, i.e., the property that connected nodes share similar\nlabels/features. We find that lower homophily significantly increases\nmemorization, indicating that GNNs rely on memorization to learn less\nhomophilic graphs. Secondly, we analyze GNN training dynamics. We find that the\nincreased memorization in low homophily graphs is tightly coupled to the GNNs'\nimplicit bias on using graph structure during learning. In low homophily\nregimes, this structure is less informative, hence inducing memorization of the\nnode labels to minimize training loss. Finally, we show that nodes with higher\nlabel inconsistency in their feature-space neighborhood are significantly more\nprone to memorization. Building on our insights into the link between graph\nhomophily and memorization, we investigate graph rewiring as a means to\nmitigate memorization. Our results demonstrate that this approach effectively\nreduces memorization without compromising model performance. Moreover, we show\nthat it lowers the privacy risk for previously memorized data points in\npractice. Thus, our work not only advances understanding of GNN learning but\nalso supports more privacy-preserving GNN deployment.",

Following a\nhierarchical Bayesian inference approach, we measure the cumulative mass of the\nMilky Way using full 6D phase-space information of stars from the first data\nrelease of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). We employ 330 blue\nhorizontal-branch stars (BHBs) and 110 RR Lyrae stars (RRLs) in DESI covering\nGalactocentric distances in the range $\\sim$50--100 kpc. Within 100 kpc from\nthe Galactic center, we report an enclosed mass of $M(<100\\ {\\rm kpc}) =\n0.57^{+0.08}_{-0.07}\\times10^{12}$ M$_\\odot$ and $M(<100\\ {\\rm kpc}) =\n0.55^{+0.12}_{-0.10}\\times10^{12}$ M$_\\odot$ when using BHBs and RRLs,\nrespectively.

We\nvalidate the effectiveness and limitations of our method using mock BHBs and\nRRLs from two AuriDESI halos. These tests show that the code recovers the\nenclosed mass of the mock galaxy with high precision and accuracy between 50\nand 200 kpc, independent of the stellar tracer used and their spatial\ndistribution. The tests also suggest an underestimation of the galaxy's\ncumulative mass at a level of up to $\\sim20$\\% if stars close to the Galactic\ncenter are used in the models.

Since AD is irreversible, early diagnosis is crucial for\nmanaging its progression. Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) represents an\nintermediate stage between Cognitively Normal (CN) individuals and those with\nAD, and is considered a transitional phase from normal cognition to Alzheimer's\ndisease. Diagnosing MCI is particularly challenging due to the subtle\ndifferences between adjacent diagnostic categories. In this study, we propose\nEffNetViTLoRA, a generalized end-to-end model for AD diagnosis using the whole\nAlzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) Magnetic Resonance Imaging\n(MRI) dataset. Our model integrates a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with a\nVision Transformer (ViT) to capture both local and global features from MRI\nimages. Unlike previous studies that rely on limited subsets of data, our\napproach is trained on the full T1-weighted MRI dataset from ADNI, resulting in\na more robust and unbiased model. This comprehensive methodology enhances the\nmodel's clinical reliability. Furthermore, fine-tuning large pretrained models\noften yields suboptimal results when source and target dataset domains differ.\nTo address this, we incorporate Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to effectively adapt\nthe pretrained ViT model to our target domain. This method enables efficient\nknowledge transfer and reduces the risk of overfitting. Our model achieves a\nclassification accuracy of 92.52% and an F1-score of 92.76% across three\ndiagnostic categories: AD, MCI, and CN for full ADNI dataset.",

A\ncentral challenge is therefore how to best leverage scarce expert\ndemonstrations alongside abundant but lower-quality data. We demonstrate that\nincorporating even a tiny amount of expert experience can substantially improve\nRL agent performance. We introduce Re:Frame (Retrieving Experience From\nAssociative Memory), a plug-in module that augments a standard offline RL\npolicy (e.g., Decision Transformer) with a small external Associative Memory\nBuffer (AMB) populated by expert trajectories drawn from a separate dataset.\nDuring training on low-quality data, the policy learns to retrieve expert data\nfrom the Associative Memory Buffer (AMB) via content-based associations and\nintegrate them into decision-making; the same AMB is queried at evaluation.\nThis requires no environment interaction and no modifications to the backbone\narchitecture. On D4RL MuJoCo tasks, using as few as 60 expert trajectories\n(0.1% of a 6000-trajectory dataset), Re:Frame consistently improves over a\nstrong Decision Transformer baseline in three of four settings, with gains up\nto +10.7 normalized points.

Unlike previous work, our Hamiltonian does not\ninclude an explicit Coulomb interaction between particles. Rather, the Coulomb\ninteraction emerges from the imposition of Gauss' law as a constraint upon the\nsystem in an appropriate non-relativistic limit. Furthermore, a form of\ntopological protection emerges in our formalism, analogous to that of the Toric\ncode Hamiltonian. This mechanism prevents simulation-induced electric field\nerrors that can be contracted to a point from causing any deviations from\nCoulomb's law in the non-relativistic limit and any error that forms a\nnon-contractable loop is energetically dissallowed in the limit of large\nvolume. We find that, under appropriate continuity assumptions, the number of\nnon-Clifford gates required by our algorithm scales in the thermodynamic limit\nas $\\widetilde{O}(N^{2/3}\\eta^{4/3} t \\log^5(1/\\epsilon))$ for $\\eta$\nparticles, $N$ spatial grid points, simulation time $t$ and error tolerance\n$\\epsilon$.

The post-merger amplification of the\nfield due to winding may be suppressed by toroidal fields, and enhanced by\nasymmetries or mixtures of poloidal and toroidal fields. The field strength in\nthe ejecta may be impacted by the initial magnetic field, with configurations\nwhich lead to large amplifications and those with mixtures of poloidal and\ntoroidal fields preferentially emitting highly magnetised material in the polar\nregions, showing a weaker dependence of the magnetic field on the density of\nthe ejecta than in cases that amplify the magnetic field less.

Using 186 Milky Way (MW) and Andromeda (M31) analogues from the\nTNG50 cosmological simulation, we compare star formation rates (SFRs) inferred\nfrom present-day stellar positions with those based on stellar birth radii to\nquantify the magnitude, spatial structure, and temporal evolution of\nmigration-induced biases. We find that radial migration systematically produces\nartificial star formation in regions that had not yet formed stars. Notably,\nabout 80% of galaxies exhibit outer-disk stars older than 10 Gyr, implying that\nthese populations must have migrated from the inner disk. Similar effects\nappear in about 45% of galaxies at intermediate radii during early epochs, and\nin 30% of quenched inner disks within the past 4 Gyr. Migration also smooths\nSFHs, washing out localized bursts and periods of suppressed star formation by\ndispersing stars across neighboring radii. The strength and imprint of these\ndistortions depend sensitively on galactic structure and evolutionary history:\nstrong bars drive mean SFR overestimates of up to 75% in the inner disk and\n150% in the outskirts; thinner, dynamically cold disks suffer average\nouter-disk biases up to 160%; while thick disks exhibit typical inner-disk\nbiases up to 125%. Merger timing further modulates these patterns. Our results\ndemonstrate that failing to account for stellar migration can lead to severe\nmisinterpretations of when and where stars formed, with direct implications for\nthe chemical and evolutionary histories of the MW and external galaxies.",

We investigate the binding energies of atoms to interstellar dust\nparticles, which play a key role in their growth and evolution, as well as for\nthe chemical reactions on their surfaces. Aims. We aim to compute the binding\nenergies of abundant atoms in the interstellar medium (C, N, O, Mg, Al, Si, S,\nCa, Fe, and Ni) to silicate dust. Methods. We used the Geometries, Frequencies,\nand Non-covalent Interactions Tight Binding (GFN1-xTB) method to compute the\nbinding energies. An FeMgSiO$_4$ periodic surface model, containing 81 local\nminima on the surface, was used. Results. A range of binding energies was found\nfor each element. The median of the binding energies follows the order Si (14.8\neV) > Al (12.8 eV) > Ca (12.7 eV) > C (9.5 eV) > O (8.1 eV) > N (6.2 eV) > Fe\n(6.0 eV) > S (5.2 eV) > Mg (2.4 eV). The probability distribution of binding\nenergies for each element except Ca is statistically consistent with a\nlog-normal distribution. Conclusions. In general, Si, Ca, and Al atoms have\nlarge binding energies. Thus, these atoms can stay on the silicate dust\nparticles at high temperatures. The binding energies of the other atoms, C, N,\nO, Mg, S, Fe and Ni, are relatively weak. However, the computed binding\nenergies for these elements are still far stronger than the energies associated\nwith dust temperatures typical of the ambient interstellar medium (ISM),\nsuggesting that silicate grains are generally stable against sublimation. We\nestimate sublimation temperatures for silicate grains to range from 1600 K to\n3000K depending on assumed grain size and lifetime.

Its infrared spectrum reveals\na mixed oxygen and carbon dust chemistry, displaying both silicate and\npolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) features. Using the JWST Mid-Infrared\nInstrument (MIRI) and Medium Resolution Spectrometer, a mosaic map was obtained\nover the core of NGC 6302, covering the wavelength range of 5--28 micron and\nspanning an area of ~18.5 arcsec x15 arcsec. The spatially resolved spectrum\nreveals ~200 molecular and ionized lines from species requiring ionisation\npotentials of up to 205 eV. The spatial distributions highlight a complex\nstructure at the nebula's centre. Highly ionized species such as Mg VII and Si\nVII show compact structures, while lower-ionization species such as H^+ extend\nmuch farther outwards, forming filament-defined rims that delineate a bubble.\nWithin the bubble, the H^+ and H_2 emission coincide, while the PAH emission\nappears farther out, indicating an ionization structure distinct from typical\nphotodissociation regions, such as the Orion Bar. This may be the first\nidentification of a PAH formation site in a PN. This PN appears to be shaped\nnot by a steady, continuous outflow, but by a series of dynamic, impulsive\nbubble ejections, creating local conditions conducive to PAH formation. A dusty\ntorus surrounds the core, primarily composed of large (micron-sized) silicate\ngrains with crystalline components. The long-lived torus contains a substantial\nmass of material, which could support an equilibrium chemistry and a slow\ndust-formation process.",

We provide an analytic\nunderstanding of this behavior, showing that the undershoots originate from the\nfractionalization of the Hilbert space into several towers of states: for\nantiferromagnetic couplings this occurs only at strong $J$, driven by\nboundary-localized bound modes, while for ferromagnetic couplings undershoots\noccur for all $J<0$, becoming deeper with increasing $|J|$ and vanishing as\n$J\\to 0^{-}$. These bound modes screen the impurity. Incorporating the bound\nmodes and edge states provides a complete analytic understanding of this\nphenomenon and yields closed expressions for the impurity contribution to free\nenergy and entropy that are valid across all phases.

Recent methods typically edit rendered multi-view images and then\nreconstruct 3D models, but they face challenges in precisely preserving\nunedited regions and overall coherence. Inspired by structured 3D generative\nmodels, we propose VoxHammer, a novel training-free approach that performs\nprecise and coherent editing in 3D latent space. Given a 3D model, VoxHammer\nfirst predicts its inversion trajectory and obtains its inverted latents and\nkey-value tokens at each timestep. Subsequently, in the denoising and editing\nphase, we replace the denoising features of preserved regions with the\ncorresponding inverted latents and cached key-value tokens. By retaining these\ncontextual features, this approach ensures consistent reconstruction of\npreserved areas and coherent integration of edited parts. To evaluate the\nconsistency of preserved regions, we constructed Edit3D-Bench, a\nhuman-annotated dataset comprising hundreds of samples, each with carefully\nlabeled 3D editing regions. Experiments demonstrate that VoxHammer\nsignificantly outperforms existing methods in terms of both 3D consistency of\npreserved regions and overall quality.

    "abstract": "We propose a training-free method, Articulate3D, to pose a 3D asset through\nlanguage control. Despite advances in vision and language models, this task\nremains surprisingly challenging. To achieve this goal, we decompose the\nproblem into two steps. We modify a powerful image-generator to create target\nimages conditioned on the input image and a text instruction. We then align the\nmesh to the target images through a multi-view pose optimisation step. In\ndetail, we introduce a self-attention rewiring mechanism (RSActrl) that\ndecouples the source structure from pose within an image generative model,\nallowing it to maintain a consistent structure across varying poses. We\nobserved that differentiable rendering is an unreliable signal for articulation\noptimisation; instead, we use keypoints to establish correspondences between\ninput and target images. The effectiveness of Articulate3D is demonstrated\nacross a diverse range of 3D objects and free-form text prompts, successfully\nmanipulating poses while maintaining the original identity of the mesh.\nQuantitative evaluations and a comparative user study, in which our method was\npreferred over 85\\% of the time, confirm its superiority over existing\napproaches.

    "abstract": "Recent video foundation models such as SAM2 excel at prompted video\nsegmentation by treating masks as a general-purpose primitive. However, many\nreal-world settings require unprompted segmentation that aims to detect and\ntrack all objects in a video without external cues, leaving today's landscape\nfragmented across task-specific models and pipelines. We recast streaming video\nsegmentation as sequential mask prediction, analogous to language modeling, and\nintroduce the Autoregressive Universal Segmentation Model (AUSM), a single\narchitecture that unifies both prompted and unprompted video segmentation.\nBuilt on recent state-space models, AUSM maintains a fixed-size spatial state\nand scales to video streams of arbitrary length. Furthermore, all components of\nAUSM are designed for parallel training across frames, yielding substantial\nspeedups over iterative training. On standard benchmarks (DAVIS17, YouTube-VOS\n2018 & 2019, MOSE, YouTube-VIS 2019 & 2021, and OVIS) AUSM outperforms prior\nuniversal streaming video segmentation methods and achieves up to 2.5x faster\ntraining on 16-frame sequences.",

This behavior\nemerges when the oscillation frequency $\\omega$ exceeds the naive cutoff of the\ntheory, $4\\pi f$.

To draw meaningful conclusions from\nexperimental data, a theoretical framework is needed to link QCD thermodynamics\nwith the particle spectra and correlations observed in detectors. The Equation\nof State (EoS) of QCD near a critical point can be related to the universal\nGibbs free energy of the 3D Ising model using four currently unknown\nnon-universal mapping parameters whose values are determined by the microscopic\ndetails of QCD. We utilize the maximum entropy approach to freeze-out the\nfluctuations in order to make estimates for factorial cumulants of proton\nmultiplicities, assuming thermal equilibrium, for a family of EoS with a 3D\nIsing-like critical point, varying the microscopic inputs that determine the\nstrength and structure of the critical features.

Cognitive science\nsuggests that humans rely on working memory to buffer short-lived\nrepresentations for immediate control, while the hippocampal system preserves\nverbatim episodic details and semantic gist of past experience for long-term\nmemory. Inspired by these mechanisms, we propose MemoryVLA, a\nCognition-Memory-Action framework for long-horizon robotic manipulation. A\npretrained VLM encodes the observation into perceptual and cognitive tokens\nthat form working memory, while a Perceptual-Cognitive Memory Bank stores\nlow-level details and high-level semantics consolidated from it. Working memory\nretrieves decision-relevant entries from the bank, adaptively fuses them with\ncurrent tokens, and updates the bank by merging redundancies. Using these\ntokens, a memory-conditioned diffusion action expert yields temporally aware\naction sequences. We evaluate MemoryVLA on 150+ simulation and real-world tasks\nacross three robots. On SimplerEnv-Bridge, Fractal, and LIBERO-5 suites, it\nachieves 71.9%, 72.7%, and 96.5% success rates, respectively, all outperforming\nstate-of-the-art baselines CogACT and pi-0, with a notable +14.6 gain on\nBridge.

The presence of magma oceans on sub-Neptunes is expected to\nstrongly alter the chemistry of their envelopes (100 bar-100 kbar) and\natmospheres (1 mbar-100 bar). At the magma ocean-envelope boundary (MEB, >10\nkbar), gas properties deviate from ideality, yet the effects of real gas\nbehaviour on chemical equilibria remain underexplored. Here, we compute\nequilibrium between magma-gas and gas-gas reactions using real gas equations of\nstate in the H-He-C-N-O-Si system for TOI-421b, a canonical hot sub-Neptune\npotentially hosting a magma ocean. We find that H and N are the most soluble in\nmagma, followed by He and C. We fit real gas equations of state to experimental\ndata on SiH$_4$, and show that, for a fully molten mantle, SiH$_4$ dominates at\nthe MEB under accreted gas metallicity of 1$\\times$ solar, but is supplanted by\nCH$_4$ at 100$\\times$ solar. Lower mantle melt fractions lower both\nmagma-derived Si abundances in the envelope and the solubility of H and He in\nmagma, yielding H$_2$- and He-rich envelopes. Projecting equilibrium chemistry\nthrough the atmosphere (1 mbar-100 bar), we find that condensation of\n$\\beta$-quartz 'clouds' depletes Si-bearing gases, although SiH$_4$ remains\nabundant at solar metallicity. SiH$_4$/CH$_4$ ratios increase with mantle melt\nfraction and decrease with metallicity. These effects also deplete H$_2$ via\nCH$_4$ and SiH$_4$ formation and the dissolution of H$_2$ into magma. The\ncompetition between SiH$_4$ and CH$_4$ presents a diagnostic of metallicity and\nmagma oceans. The corollary is that H$_2$- and He-rich, SiH$_4$- and\nCH$_4$-poor (<5%) atmospheres may indicate a limited role or absence of magma\noceans on sub-Neptunes.",

We show it provides (i) better judgment accuracy on\nintermediate steps than existing methods; (ii) can be used to improve the\npolicy model at training time; and (iii) improves inference-time search.",

However, most systems remain constrained by a linear\nrequest-response format that often makes interactions inefficient in\nmulti-turn, information-dense, and exploratory tasks. To address these\nlimitations, we propose Generative Interfaces for Language Models, a paradigm\nin which LLMs respond to user queries by proactively generating user interfaces\n(UIs) that enable more adaptive and interactive engagement. Our framework\nleverages structured interface-specific representations and iterative\nrefinements to translate user queries into task-specific UIs. For systematic\nevaluation, we introduce a multidimensional assessment framework that compares\ngenerative interfaces with traditional chat-based ones across diverse tasks,\ninteraction patterns, and query types, capturing functional, interactive, and\nemotional aspects of user experience. Results show that generative interfaces\nconsistently outperform conversational ones, with humans preferring them in\nover 70% of cases. These findings clarify when and why users favor generative\ninterfaces, paving the way for future advancements in human-AI interaction.",

Owing\nto IoT devices' limited resources, traditional consensus algorithms such as PoW\nand PoS in the blockchain are computationally expensive.

We present PRISM (Prompt-guided\nRepresentation Integration for Survival Modeling), a self-supervised framework\nthat integrates visual representations from non-contrast cardiac cine magnetic\nresonance imaging with structured electronic health records (EHRs) for survival\nanalysis. PRISM extracts temporally synchronized imaging features through\nmotion-aware multi-view distillation and modulates them using medically\ninformed textual prompts to enable fine-grained risk prediction. Across four\nindependent clinical cohorts, PRISM consistently surpasses classical survival\nprediction models and state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep learning baselines under\ninternal and external validation. Further clinical findings demonstrate that\nthe combined imaging and EHR representations derived from PRISM provide\nvaluable insights into cardiac risk across diverse cohorts. Three distinct\nimaging signatures associated with elevated MACE risk are uncovered, including\nlateral wall dyssynchrony, inferior wall hypersensitivity, and anterior\nelevated focus during diastole.

To bridge this gap, \\textbf{we propose a framework designed to\ngenerate character animations that are not only physically plausible but also\nsemantically coherent and expressive.} Our model, \\textbf{OmniHuman-1.5}, is\nbuilt upon two key technical contributions. First, we leverage Multimodal Large\nLanguage Models to synthesize a structured textual representation of conditions\nthat provides high-level semantic guidance. This guidance steers our motion\ngenerator beyond simplistic rhythmic synchronization, enabling the production\nof actions that are contextually and emotionally resonant. Second, to ensure\nthe effective fusion of these multimodal inputs and mitigate inter-modality\nconflicts, we introduce a specialized Multimodal DiT architecture with a novel\nPseudo Last Frame design. The synergy of these components allows our model to\naccurately interpret the joint semantics of audio, images, and text, thereby\ngenerating motions that are deeply coherent with the character, scene, and\nlinguistic content. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves\nleading performance across a comprehensive set of metrics, including lip-sync\naccuracy, video quality, motion naturalness and semantic consistency with\ntextual prompts.

Our model employs Gaussian\nProcesses (GPs) with astrophysically motivated priors to represent the mass\ndistribution, assuming both component masses are independently drawn from a\ncommon mass function. This approach enables us to capture complex features in\nthe population without relying on rigid parametric forms. Motivated by\npredictions from binary stellar evolution, we focus on the presence of a mass\ngap in the range $40-120~ M_\\odot$, attributed to the pair-instability\nsupernova (PISN) and pulsational PISN (PPISN) processes. Using our GP-based\nmodel, we find for the first time, strong evidence for the onset of this mass\ngap, locating its lower edge at approximately $45-60 ~M_\\odot$. We observe a\nsuppression in the BBH merger rate when comparing the latest constraints\nagainst our GP model, by a factor of $10-60$ at $\\sim60~M_\\odot$, corresponding\nto the minimum of the mass gap. Additionally, we find evidence of a\nsubpopulation of mergers populating the mass gap around $70 ~M_\\odot$, which we\nargue is due to hierarchical mergers, as well as of a feature in the $40-50~\nM_\\odot$ range, albeit with low significance, which we attribute to the\npredicted PPISN build up. We discuss the astrophysical implications of this\nresult in light of GW231123, a recently reported BBH merger with a total mass\npotentially above the PISN gap, suggesting the need for revised models of\nmassive stellar evolution or alternative formation channels.",

The data of the Wang et al. experiment show destructive interference\nwhich surpasses the required threshold for Bell non-classicality in the\nmodified version, and thus effectively constitutes a positive experimental Bell\nnon-classicality test employing our proposal. The essence of our method is to\nabandon the usual approach in which macroscopically controlled optical phases\ndefine the measurement settings in a Bell experiment. Instead, in our case, the\nlocal settings are determined by switching on or off the local pumping fields\nof the parametric down conversion crystals at the local measuring stations of\n\"Alice and Bob''.\n  We also show that in a standard framework of local hidden variable theories\nthat do not require any additional assumptions, it is possible to construct a\nlocal realistic model which exactly reproduces the probabilities on which the\nconjecture by Wang et al. violation of local realism was based. Thus, we prove\nthat the tacit additional assumptions in the Bell analysis of Wang et al.\nconstrain the class of local realistic models refuted by the experiment.

However, in mixed\nautonomy environments where CAVs coexist with human-driven vehicles (HDVs),\nachieving efficient coordination among CAVs remains challenging due to\nheterogeneous driving behaviors. To address this, this paper proposes a\nmultiagent truncated rollout approach that enhances CAV speed coordination to\nimprove highway throughput while reducing computational overhead. In this\napproach, a traffic density evolution equation is formulated that\ncomprehensively accounts for the presence or absence of CAVs, and a distributed\ncoordination control framework is established accordingly. By incorporating\nkinematic information from neighbor agents and employing an agent-by-agent\nsequential solution mechanism, our method enables explicit cooperation among\nCAVs. Furthermore, we introduce a truncated rollout scheme that adaptively\nshortens the optimization horizon based on the evaluation of control sequences.\nThis significantly reduces the time complexity, thereby improving real-time\nperformance and scalability. Theoretical analysis provides rigorous guarantees\non the stability and performance improvement of the system. Simulations\nconducted on real-world bottleneck scenarios demonstrate that, in large-scale\nmixed traffic flows, the proposed method outperforms conventional model\npredictive control methods by reducing both the average travel time in the\nbottleneck area and overall computational time, highlighting its strong\npotential for practical deployment.",

To guide model behavior without compromising training stability and\nperformance, we also introduce Advantage Shaping Policy Optimization (ASPO), a\nnovel algorithm that directly modifies the advantage function to guide the\npolicy behavior. We conduct comprehensive experiments on challenging\nmathematical benchmarks, leveraging a Python interpreter as the external tool.\nOur results show that the TIR model decisively outperforms its pure-text\ncounterpart on the pass@k metric. Crucially, this advantage is not confined to\ncomputationally-intensive problems but extends to those requiring significant\nabstract insight. We further identify the emergent cognitive patterns that\nillustrate how models learn to think with tools. Finally, we report improved\ntool usage behavior with early code invocation and much more interactive turns\nwith ASPO. Overall, our work provides the first principled explanation for\nTIR's success, shifting the focus from the mere fact that tools work to why and\nhow they enable more powerful reasoning.",

However, progressively manipulating certain\nattributes of generated images to meet the desired user expectations remains\nchallenging, particularly for content with rich details, such as human faces.\nSome studies have attempted to address this by training slider modules.\nHowever, they follow a One-for-One manner, where an independent slider is\ntrained for each attribute, requiring additional training whenever a new\nattribute is introduced. This not only results in parameter redundancy\naccumulated by sliders but also restricts the flexibility of practical\napplications and the scalability of attribute manipulation.

Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nour method enables accurate and scalable attribute manipulation, achieving\nnotable improvements compared to previous methods.

    "abstract": "We present a new application of model checking which achieves real-time\nmulti-step planning and obstacle avoidance on a real autonomous robot. We have\ndeveloped a small, purpose-built model checking algorithm which generates plans\nin situ based on \"core\" knowledge and attention as found in biological agents.\nThis is achieved in real-time using no pre-computed data on a low-powered\ndevice. Our approach is based on chaining temporary control systems which are\nspawned to counteract disturbances in the local environment that disrupt an\nautonomous agent from its preferred action (or resting state). A novel\ndiscretization of 2D LiDAR data sensitive to bounded variations in the local\nenvironment is used. Multi-step planning using model checking by forward\ndepth-first search is applied to cul-de-sac and playground scenarios. Both\nempirical results and informal proofs of two fundamental properties of our\napproach demonstrate that model checking can be used to create efficient\nmulti-step plans for local obstacle avoidance, improving on the performance of\na reactive agent which can only plan one step. Our approach is an instructional\ncase study for the development of safe, reliable and explainable planning in\nthe context of autonomous vehicles.",

    "abstract": "Control has long been recognized as a critical component of pitcher\nperformance, reflecting a pitcher's ability to execute pitches in alignment\nwith his intended targets. However, accurately inferring a pitcher's intentions\npresents a persistent challenge. Traditional metrics typically rely on\nuniformity assumptions, inferring intent based on the behavior of a ``typical''\npitcher across similar situations. In this study, we propose an alternative,\nindividualized approach to measuring control, one that eschews such assumptions\nin favor of personalized inference. We estimate a pitcher's intended location\non a pitch-by-pitch basis, conditioning on both individual tendencies and\nspecific game contexts. This allows us to assess control by comparing the\nactual pitch location to the inferred intended target, thereby aligning\nmeasurement more closely with the unique strategies of each pitcher. We\nintroduce xCTRL, a novel metric that quantifies control as the distance between\na pitch's actual location and its estimated intended location. We find that\nxCTRL exhibits strong stability and greater predictive power than existing\ncontrol metrics. By capturing pitcher-specific intent, xCTRL enhances our\nunderstanding of control and offers a more intuitive and accurate\nrepresentation of pitching performance.",

In this\nwork, we propose the Mask Diffusion Detector (MDD), a novel adversarial\ndetection and purification framework based on a \\textit{text-conditioned masked\ndiffusion model}. During training, MDD applies partial masking to\nMel-spectrograms and progressively adds noise through a forward diffusion\nprocess, simulating the degradation of clean speech features. A reverse process\nthen reconstructs the clean representation conditioned on the input\ntranscription. Unlike prior approaches, MDD does not require adversarial\nexamples or large-scale pretraining. Experimental results show that MDD\nachieves strong adversarial detection performance and outperforms prior\nstate-of-the-art methods, including both diffusion-based and neural codec-based\napproaches. Furthermore, MDD effectively purifies adversarially-manipulated\nspeech, restoring speaker verification performance to levels close to those\nobserved under clean conditions.

    "abstract": "Vision Transformers have demonstrated remarkable success in computer vision\ntasks, yet their reliance on learnable one-dimensional positional embeddings\nfundamentally disrupts the inherent two-dimensional spatial structure of images\nthrough patch flattening procedures. Traditional positional encoding approaches\nlack geometric constraints and fail to establish monotonic correspondence\nbetween Euclidean spatial distances and sequential index distances, thereby\nlimiting the model's capacity to leverage spatial proximity priors effectively.\nWe propose Weierstrass Elliptic Function Positional Encoding (WEF-PE), a\nmathematically principled approach that directly addresses two-dimensional\ncoordinates through natural complex domain representation, where the doubly\nperiodic properties of elliptic functions align remarkably with translational\ninvariance patterns commonly observed in visual data. Our method exploits the\nnon-linear geometric nature of elliptic functions to encode spatial distance\nrelationships naturally, while the algebraic addition formula enables direct\nderivation of relative positional information between arbitrary patch pairs\nfrom their absolute encodings. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that\nWEF-PE achieves superior performance across diverse scenarios, including\n63.78\\% accuracy on CIFAR-100 from-scratch training with ViT-Tiny architecture,\n93.28\\% on CIFAR-100 fine-tuning with ViT-Base, and consistent improvements on\nVTAB-1k benchmark tasks.

While previous work has largely\ntargeted rigid, near-spherical particles, the sorting of flexible, anisotropic\nobjects such as fibers remains largely unexplored. Here, we combine experiments\nand simulations to demonstrate how tilted pillar arrays enable efficient,\nlength-based separation of flexible fibers. We discover that these arrays act\nas band-pass filters, selectively inducing lateral migration in fibers whose\nlengths are close to the array period. Fibers significantly shorter or longer\nexhibit minimal lateral deviation. This migration arises from the interplay of\nfluid-structure interactions between fibers and the complex flow and steric\ninteractions with the pillars. Depending on their length, fibers exhibit\ndistinct transport regimes: short fibers zigzag in between pillars following\nthe flow, intermediate length fibers exhibit wrapping and jumping from one\npillar to another, leading to lateral displacement, and long fibers deform\nextensively, following mixed zigzag-jump trajectories with minimal lateral\nmigration. We identify the mechanical tension that develops in the fiber when\nwrapped around the pillars as the driving mechanism of cross-streamline\ntransport. Leveraging this band-pass effect, we designed a highly efficient\nseparation device to collect monodisperse fiber suspensions. Our findings not\nonly expand the functional scope of DLD-like systems but also open new avenues\nfor understanding transport of anisotropic objects in porous media.",

    "abstract": "To enable practically useful quantum computing, we require hundreds to\nthousands of logical qubits (collections of physical qubits with error\ncorrection). Current monolithic device architectures have scaling limits beyond\nfew tens of logical qubits. To scale up, we require architectures that\norchestrate several monolithic devices into a distributed quantum computing\nsystem. Currently, resource estimation, which is crucial for determining\nhardware needs and bottlenecks, focuses exclusively on monolithic systems. Our\nwork fills this gap and answers key architectural design questions about\ndistributed systems, including the impact of distribution on application\nresource needs, the organization of qubits across nodes and the requirements of\nentanglement distillation (quantum network). To answer these questions, we\ndevelop a novel resource estimation framework that models the key components of\nthe distributed execution stack. We analyse the performance of practical\nquantum algorithms on various hardware configurations, spanning different qubit\nspeeds, entanglement generation rates and distillation protocols. We show that\ndistributed architectures have practically feasible resource requirements; for\na node size of 45K qubits, distributed systems need on average 1.4X higher\nnumber of physical qubits and 4X higher execution time compared to monolithic\narchitectures, but with more favourable hardware implementation prospects.

Many works\nhave studied the communication complexity of pointer chasing, although the\nfocus has always been on protocols with $k-1$ communication rounds, or with $k$\nrounds where Bob (the ``wrong player'') speaks first.

As these\nmodels process lossy sRGB inputs and neglect the accessibility of the sensor\nRAW images in many scenarios, e.g., in image and video capturing in edge\ndevices, resulting in sub-optimal performance. RDDM bypasses this limitation by\ndirectly restoring images in the RAW domain, replacing the conventional\ntwo-stage image signal processing (ISP) + IR pipeline. However, a simple\nadaptation of pre-trained diffusion models to the RAW domain confronts the\nout-of-distribution (OOD) issues. To this end, we propose: (1) a RAW-domain VAE\n(RVAE) learning optimal latent representations, (2) a differentiable Post Tone\nProcessing (PTP) module enabling joint RAW and sRGB space optimization. To\ncompensate for the deficiency in the dataset, we develop a scalable degradation\npipeline synthesizing RAW LQ-HQ pairs from existing sRGB datasets for\nlarge-scale training. Furthermore, we devise a configurable multi-bayer (CMB)\nLoRA module handling diverse RAW patterns such as RGGB, BGGR, etc. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate RDDM's superiority over state-of-the-art sRGB diffusion\nmethods, yielding higher fidelity results with fewer artifacts.",

Yet in real-world contexts, an intelligent agent's\ndecisions are shaped not only by logic but also by deeper influences such as\nbeliefs, values, and preferences. The diversity of human decision-making styles\nemerges from these differences, highlighting that \"style\" is an essential but\noften overlooked dimension of intelligence.\n  This dissertation introduces playstyle as an alternative lens for observing\nand analyzing the decision-making behavior of intelligent agents, and examines\nits foundational meaning and historical context from a philosophical\nperspective. By analyzing how beliefs and values drive intentions and actions,\nwe construct a two-tier framework for style formation: the external interaction\nloop with the environment and the internal cognitive loop of deliberation. On\nthis basis, we formalize style-related characteristics and propose measurable\nindicators such as style capacity, style popularity, and evolutionary dynamics.\n  The study focuses on three core research directions: (1) Defining and\nmeasuring playstyle, proposing a general playstyle metric based on discretized\nstate spaces, and extending it to quantify strategic diversity and competitive\nbalance; (2) Expressing and generating playstyle, exploring how reinforcement\nlearning and imitation learning can be used to train agents exhibiting specific\nstylistic tendencies, and introducing a novel approach for human-like style\nlearning and modeling; and (3) Practical applications, analyzing the potential\nof these techniques in domains such as game design and interactive\nentertainment.\n  Finally, the dissertation outlines future extensions, including the role of\nstyle as a core element in building artificial general intelligence (AGI).",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a feasibility-guaranteed learning interior point method\n(L-IPM) to solve both AC and DC optimal power flow (OPF) problems. Given the\ncriticality of OPF, the proposed L-IPM uses a hybrid learning model approach\nrather than relying solely on a simple black-box prediction. The traditional\nIPM follows a central path from an initial point to the optimal solution.\nHowever, each iteration involves solving large linear systems, which becomes\nincreasingly expensive as the matrices grow more ill-conditioned in later\nsteps. To address this, we model the IPM trajectory as a time series and train\na Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to project the IPM central path using\nonly the first few stable iterations, which carry the most informative features\nabout the path to optimality. We introduce a grid-informed methodology that\nenforces operational constraints on generation, voltage magnitudes, and line\nflows to ensure feasibility. The grid-informed LSTM serves as a tool for the\nIPM central path projection and, followed by a final IPM refinement step,\nsignificantly reduces the total number of iterations and time required for\nconvergence. We use a sampling method to generate a wide range of load\nscenarios to improve generalization across diverse operating conditions,\nefficiently covering the power system's operational space. Simulation results\non a 2869-bus European high-voltage transmission system show that the proposed\nL-IPM significantly reduces solution time by up to 94\\%, while maintaining\naccuracy and feasibility of the solution. By leveraging early iterations and\nbypassing the final ill-conditioned and computationally demanding steps of\ntraditional IPM, the proposed L-IPM reduces the number of required iterations\nby up to 85.5\\%. Since solution feasibility is also guaranteed, L-IPM\noutperforms the conventional IPM in both computational efficiency and\nrobustness.",

    "abstract": "Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have become increasingly popular in\ninformation processing tasks involving time series and temporal data. A\nfundamental property of RNNs is their ability to create reliable input/output\nresponses, often linked to how the network handles its memory of the\ninformation it processed. Various notions have been proposed to conceptualize\nthe behavior of memory in RNNs, including steady states, echo states, state\nforgetting, input forgetting, and fading memory. Although these notions are\noften used interchangeably, their precise relationships remain unclear. This\nwork aims to unify these notions in a common language, derive new implications\nand equivalences between them, and provide alternative proofs to some existing\nresults.

This article\nasks whether machine learning can guide the development of new economic\ntheories.\n  Economic models serve an important purpose beyond prediction -- they uncover\nthe general mechanisms behind observed behaviors. A model that identifies the\ncausal pathways of economic development is more valuable than one that merely\npredicts which countries will escape poverty, because it enables policymakers\nto encourage that development in countries where it might not have happened\notherwise. Similarly, a model that predicts imperfectly across many domains can\nbe more valuable than one that is highly accurate in a specific domain, since\nthe former allows insights and data obtained from one setting to inform\ndecisions and policy in another.\n  Applying machine learning algorithms off-the-shelf is unlikely to yield such\nmodels.

The presence of\ndust grains and their local distribution play a significant role throughout the\nprotostellar sequence, from the thermodynamics and the chemistry of molecular\nclouds to the opacity of collapsing protostellar cores and the coupling between\nthe gas and the magnetic field and down to planet formation in young and\nevolved disks. We aim to simulate the dynamics of the dust, considering the\nwhole range of grain sizes, from few nanometers to millimeters. We implemented\na neutral pressureless multifluid that samples the dust size distribution in\nthe RAMSES code. This multifluid is dynamically coupled to the gas via a drag\nsource term and self-gravity, relying on the Eulerian approach. We designed a\nRiemann solver for the gas and dust mixture that prevents unphysical\ndust-to-gas ratio variations for well-coupled grains. We illustrated the\ncapacities of the code by performing simulations of a protostellar collapse\ndown to the formation of a first hydrostatic core, both for small and large\ndust grains. Grains over 100 microns significantly decouple from the gas. The\nspatial maps and the probability density functions indicate that dust\nenrichment within the first hydrostatic core and in some locations of the\nenvelope increases as a function of the grain size and the level of initial\nturbulence. Thanks to the novel Riemann solver, we recovered the terminal\nvelocity regime, even at low resolution. Moreover, we successfully extended it\nto regimes where the grain inertia matters. The multifluid module performs the\ncoupling between the dust and the gas self-consistently all through the\ndynamical scales. The dust enrichment in the first hydrostatic core and the\nenvelope have been revised here, assuming the initial turbulence and grain\nsizes. This enables us to probe new potential conditions for planet formation.",

In addition, the signal is also sensitive to how the HI is\ndistributed among the dark matter haloes, this being quantified through the\nHIHM relation, which relates the HI mass to the halo mass. In this work, we\ninvestigate whether measurements of the 21-cm power spectrum (PS) and\nbispectrum (BS) at large scales can be used to estimate the HIHM relation,\nwhich quantifies the HI distribution at small scales. As a proof of concept, we\nconsider the simulated 21-cm IM signal at $z=1$. We find that the measured\n21-cm PS and BS at large scales $(k \\le k_{ul} = 0.32 \\, {\\rm Mpc}^{-1})$ are\nwell modeled using perturbation theory, with only two free parameters namely\n$[\\Omega_{\\rm HI} b_1]$ and $\\gamma = b_2/b_1$. Combining the measured 21-cm PS\nand BS with an independent measurement of $\\Omega_{\\rm HI} $, we show that it\nis possible to estimate the three parameters that quantify the HIHM relation.\nWe expect observational estimates of the HIHM relation to shed light on galaxy\nformation and the evolution of the ISM.

The existence of multiple stationary solutions is\nestablished through countably many saddle-node bifurcations at critical shear\nspeeds for the algebraic equation. We then establish similar local bifurcations\nfor the stationary solutions; more precisely, (i) for each critical shear\nspeed, there is a unique stationary solution, the stationary solution\ndisappears for smaller shear speed, and two stationary solutions nearby\nbifurcate for larger shear speed; (ii) more importantly, under a generic\ncondition, there is exactly one zero eigenvalue for the linearization of the\nshear flow at the critical stationary solution, and the zero eigenvalue\nbifurcates to a negative eigenvalue for one of the two stationary solutions and\nto a positive eigenvalue for the other stationary solution.

Both the atomically disordered ($A1$) fcc phase, as well as\nthe atomically ordered, tetragonal $\\textrm{L}1_0$ phase - which is under\nconsideration as a material for a rare-earth-free 'gap' magnet for advanced\nengineering applications - are investigated. Across an ensemble of NEB\ncalculations performed on supercell configurations spanning a range of\ncompositions and containing disordered, partially ordered, and fully ordered\nstructures, we find that Ni atoms are consistently significantly less mobile\nthan Fe atoms. Crucially, we are able to interpret these findings in terms of\nthe ferromagnetic alloy's underlying spin-polarised electronic structure.\nSpecifically, we report a coupling between the size of local lattice\ndistortions and the magnitude of the local electronic spin polarisation around\nvacancies. This causes Fe atoms to relax into lattice vacancies, while Ni atoms\nremain rigidly fixed to their original lattice positions. This effect plays a\nkey role in determining the reduced mobility of Ni atoms compared to that of Fe\natoms. These results shed atomic-scale insight into the longstanding\nexperimental observation that Ni exhibits remarkably slow atomic diffusion in\nFe-Ni alloys.",

Operating one or\nmore VLBI nodes in space will require the use of frequency standards that are\nspace qualified, greatly reducing the number of options available. The\ncoherence function C(T) is the metric usually used to determine the viability\nof a frequency standard. Here we show that C(T) is a useful but not sufficient\nmetric for gauging frequency standard performance in VLBI and instead derive an\nexpression for the clock-limited VLBI visibility S/N. We evaluate this\nexpression for real frequency standards and find only the Ultra-Stable\nOscillator (USO) and hydrogen maser to be viable for upcoming high-frequency\nVLBI with the USO only useful for very limited integration times (30s at 90\nGHz, 10s at 230 GHz, 5s at 345 GHz, and not viable at 630 GHz). The maser\nextends these, but may have prohivitive size for a space mission. We also\nevaluate emerging frequency standard technologies and find the Optical Local\nOscillator portion of optical clocks to be very promising (conservatively >100s\nat 90 GHz, 60s at 230 GHz, 40s at 345 GHz, and 22s at 630 GHz) when accounting\nfor both performance and potential operation in space.",

Here, we present a novel method to\ntime-continuously measure and decode perceived risk.

    "abstract": "The dSphs around the Milky Way are commonly considered as systems that are\nsupported by velocity dispersion against self-gravitation. They have been long\naccounted among the best targets to search for indirect DM signatures in the\nGeV-to-TeV gamma-rays due to absence of astrophysical gamma-ray foreground or\nbackground emission. We present forecasts on the sensitivity of the future CTAO\nfor the search for annihilating or decaying DM in such targets. We perform an\noriginal selection of candidates out of the current catalog of known objects,\nincluding both classical and ultra-faint targets. For each of them, we\ncalculate the expected amount of DM using the most updated and complete\navailable samples of photometric and spectroscopic data of member stars,\nadopting a common framework of data treatment for both classes of objects. In\nthis way, we are able to generate novel astrophysical factor profiles for\ngeneral indirect DM searches that we compare with the current literature. Out\nof a starting sample of 64 dSphs, we highlight the 8 most promising targets -\nDraI, CBe, UMaII, UMi and Wil1 in the Northern hemisphere; RetII, Scl and SgrII\nin the Southern hemisphere - for which different DM density models (either\ncored or cuspy) lead to similar expectations, at variance with what happens for\nother DM targets - thus resulting in more robust predictions. We find that CTAO\nwill provide the strongest limits above ~10 TeV, down to values of\nvelocity-averaged annihilation cross section of ~5$ \\times 10^{-25}$ cm$^3$\ns$^{-1}$ and up to decay lifetimes of ~10$^{26}$ s for combined limits on the\nbest targets. We argue that the largest source of inaccuracy is due to the\nstill imprecise determination of the DM content, especially for ultra-faint\ndSphs. We propose possible strategies of observation for CTAO, either optimized\non a deep focus on the best known candidates, or on the diversification of\ntargets.",

The MissionMotion Project addresses this issue by providing a\ngamified physical-computational environment combining low-cost sensors,\nphysical activity, computational thinking, and real-time visualization of\nmotion graphs. This paper presents the design, development, and implementation\nof the project, with a particular focus on the pilot phase conducted with high\nschool students in Uruguay. During this phase, we primarily used the MEEGA+\nquestionnaire to evaluate the gaming experience, usability, and motivation of\nthe participants. Our analysis of the results shows high levels of\nsatisfaction, perceived learning, and engagement, supporting the proposal's\nviability. Finally, we plan to conduct a large-scale conceptual evaluation to\nanalyze how the proposal impacts understanding of kinematic graphs using\nstandardized assessment tools.",

However, the absence of\ngeneral-purpose MLIPs capable of handling a wide range of elements and their\ncombinations has limited their broader applicability. In this work, we\nintroduce MACE4IR, a machine learning foundation model built on the MACE\narchitecture and trained on 10 million geometries and corresponding\ndensity-functional theory (DFT) energies, forces and dipole moments from the\nQCML dataset. The training data encompasses approximately 80 elements and a\ndiverse set of molecules, including organic compounds, inorganic species, and\nmetal complexes. MACE4IR accurately predicts energies, forces, dipole moments,\nand infrared spectra at significantly reduced computational cost compared to\nDFT. By combining generality, accuracy, and efficiency, MACE4IR opens the door\nto rapid and reliable infrared spectra prediction for complex systems across\nchemistry, biology, and materials science.",

Among these quantum\nphenomena is the charge density wave (CDW), or the distortion of the lattice\nstructure due to the motion of correlated electrons through the material. CDWs\nlower the energy of the compound, creating an energy gap that facilitates\nbehaviors akin to superconductivity, nonlinear transport, or other quantum\ncorrelated phenomena. The kagome metal FeGe has been shown to host a CDW\ntransition at approximately 100 K, and its occurrence is strongly influenced by\nthe sample annealing conditions.

Here we present evidence of\nelectron behavior modification due to annealing disorder via thermoelectric\nmeasurements on FeGe crystals presenting a CDW transition and those without a\nCDW. The observed Nernst effect and Seebeck effect under sufficient annealing\ndemonstrate modified electrical transport properties resulting from induced\ndisorder, including a change in carrier sign and an enhancement of the Nernst\neffect due to the CDW.

    "abstract": "Diffusion models have become prevalent in generative modeling due to their\nability to sample from complex distributions. To improve the quality of\ngenerated samples and their compliance with user requirements, two commonly\nused methods are: (i) Alignment, which involves fine-tuning a diffusion model\nto align it with a reward; and (ii) Composition, which combines several\npre-trained diffusion models, each emphasizing a desirable attribute in the\ngenerated outputs. However, trade-offs often arise when optimizing for multiple\nrewards or combining multiple models, as they can often represent competing\nproperties. Existing methods cannot guarantee that the resulting model\nfaithfully generates samples with all the desired properties. To address this\ngap, we propose a constrained optimization framework that unifies alignment and\ncomposition of diffusion models by enforcing that the aligned model satisfies\nreward constraints and/or remains close to (potentially multiple) pre-trained\nmodels. We provide a theoretical characterization of the solutions to the\nconstrained alignment and composition problems and develop a Lagrangian-based\nprimal-dual training algorithm to approximate these solutions. Empirically, we\ndemonstrate the effectiveness and merits of our proposed approach in image\ngeneration, applying it to alignment and composition, and show that our aligned\nor composed model satisfies constraints effectively, and improves on the\nequally-weighted approach.

To understand how peer relationships shape this process, we\ndraw on unique sociocentric network data from students in classrooms across\nthree countries, focusing on peer-to-peer advice-giving and advice-seeking\nnetworks related to digital skills. Using exponential random graph models, we\nfind that digital skills systematically spread through peer interactions:\nhigher-skilled students are more likely to be sought for advice while less\nlikely to seek it themselves. Students perceived as highly skilled are more\nlikely to seek and offer advice, but it has limited influence on being sought\nout by others. Gender plays a significant role: girls both seek and give more\nadvice, with strong gender homophily shaping these interactions.

These are\nmodels with Lagrangians that involve higher powers of the kinetic energy\n$\\dot\\phi^2$, or where the dark matter (DM) mass is a function of $\\phi$. Both\nhave similar features with respect to the reconstructed redshift-dependent\n$w(z)$: moderate tuning of parameters is required to achieve the desired shape,\nand it is difficult or impossible for $w(z)$ to continue evolving smoothly as\n$z$ becomes large. Nevertheless, they give a strong improvement over\n$\\Lambda$CDM in fitting the data. We point out that models of coupled dark\nmatter and dark energy that cross the phantom divide are under pressure from\nconstraints on long-range DM forces. They rule out the simplest renormalizable\ncoupling of scalar DM to quintessence, but leave the fermionic case marginally\nallowed, while exponentially coupled models are safe from current constraints.",

    "abstract": "Quantitative Discourse Analysis has seen growing adoption with the rise of\nLarge Language Models and computational tools. However, reliance on black box\nsoftware such as MAXQDA and NVivo risks undermining methodological transparency\nand alignment with research goals. This paper presents a hybrid, transparent\nframework for QDA that combines lexical and semantic methods to enable\ntriangulation, reproducibility, and interpretability. Drawing from a case study\nin historical political discourse, we demonstrate how custom Python pipelines\nusing NLTK, spaCy, and Sentence Transformers allow fine-grained control over\npreprocessing, lemmatisation, and embedding generation. We further detail our\niterative BERTopic modelling process, incorporating UMAP dimensionality\nreduction, HDBSCAN clustering, and c-TF-IDF keyword extraction, optimised\nthrough parameter tuning and multiple runs to enhance topic coherence and\ncoverage. By juxtaposing precise lexical searches with context-aware semantic\nclustering, we argue for a multi-layered approach that mitigates the\nlimitations of either method in isolation. Our workflow underscores the\nimportance of code-level transparency, researcher agency, and methodological\ntriangulation in computational discourse studies.

    "abstract": "Autoregressive (AR) language models have emerged as powerful solutions for\nzero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis, capable of generating natural speech\nfrom a few seconds of audio prompts. However, conventional AR-based TTS systems\nrelying on discrete audio tokens face the challenge of lossy compression during\ntokenization, requiring longer discrete token sequences to capture the same\ninformation as continuous ones, which adds inference latency and complicates AR\nmodeling. To address this challenge, this paper proposes the Continuous Latent\nAutoregressive model (CLEAR), a unified zero-shot TTS framework that directly\nmodels continuous audio representations. More specifically, CLEAR introduces an\nenhanced variational autoencoder with shortcut connections, which achieves a\nhigh compression ratio to map waveforms into compact continuous latents. A\nlightweight MLP-based rectified flow head that operates independently for each\nhidden state is presented to model the continuous latent probability\ndistribution, and trained jointly with the AR model within a single-stage\nframework. Experiments show that the proposed zero-shot CLEAR TTS can\nsynthesize high-quality speech with low latency. Compared to state-of-the-art\n(SOTA) TTS models, CLEAR delivers competitive performance in robustness,\nspeaker similarity and naturalness, while offering a lower real-time factor\n(RTF). In particular, CLEAR achieves SOTA results on the LibriSpeech test-clean\ndataset, with a word error rate of 1.88\\% and an RTF of 0.29. Moreover, CLEAR\nfacilitates streaming speech synthesis with a first-frame delay of 96ms, while\nmaintaining high-quality speech synthesis.",

    "abstract": "Modern computing workloads, particularly in AI and edge applications, demand\nhardware-software co-design to meet aggressive performance and energy targets.\nSuch co-design benefits from open and agile platforms that replace closed,\nvertically integrated development with modular, community-driven ecosystems.\nCoarse-Grained Reconfigurable Architectures (CGRAs), with their unique balance\nof flexibility and efficiency are particularly well-suited for this paradigm.\nWhen built on open-source hardware generators and software toolchains, CGRAs\nprovide a compelling foundation for architectural exploration, cross-layer\noptimization, and real-world deployment. In this paper, we will present an open\nCGRA ecosystem that we have developed to support agile innovation across the\nstack. Our contributions include HyCUBE, a CGRA with a reconfigurable\nsingle-cycle multi-hop interconnect for efficient data movement; PACE, which\nembeds a power-efficient HyCUBE within a RISC-V SoC targeting edge computing;\nand Morpher, a fully open-source, architecture-adaptive CGRA design framework\nthat supports design space exploration, compilation, simulation, and\nvalidation. By embracing openness at every layer, we aim to lower barriers to\ninnovation, enable reproducible research, and demonstrate how CGRAs can anchor\nthe next wave of agile hardware development. We will conclude with a call for a\nunified abstraction layer for CGRAs and spatial accelerators, one that\ndecouples hardware specialization from software development. Such a\nrepresentation would unlock architectural portability, compiler innovation, and\na scalable, open foundation for spatial computing.",

This paper delivers the first comprehensive analysis of whether LLMs can\nacquire such languages purely via in-context learning (ICL), with or without\nauxiliary alignment signals, and how these methods compare to\nparameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). We systematically evaluate 20\nunder-represented languages across three state-of-the-art multilingual LLMs.\nOur findings highlight the limitation of PEFT when both language and its script\nare extremely under-represented by the LLM. In contrast, zero-shot ICL with\nlanguage alignment is impressively effective on extremely low-resource\nlanguages, while few-shot ICL or PEFT is more beneficial for languages\nrelatively better represented by LLMs. For LLM practitioners working on\nextremely low-resource languages, we summarise guidelines grounded by our\nresults on adapting LLMs to low-resource languages, e.g., avoiding fine-tuning\na multilingual model on languages of unseen scripts.",

Modularity is inevitable if the substrate\ncannot support the desired error-correction code due to its planar geometry or\nmanufacturing constraints resulting in a limited number of logical qubits per\nmodule. Even if the computer is compact enough there may be functional\nrequirements to distribute the quantum computation substrate over distant\nregions of varying scales. In both cases, matter-based quantum information,\nsuch as spins, ions or neutral atoms, is the most conveniently transmitted or\nmediated by photonic interconnects. To avoid long algorithm execution times and\nreduce errors, each module of a universal quantum computer should be\ndynamically interconnected with as many other modules as possible.

Quantization methods can help reduce computational costs, however,\nattaining the extreme efficiency associated with ultra-low-bit quantized LLMs\nat arbitrary precision presents challenges on GPUs. This is primarily due to\nthe limited support for GPU Tensor Cores, inefficient memory management, and\ninflexible kernel optimizations. To tackle these challenges, we propose a\ncomprehensive acceleration scheme for arbitrary precision LLMs, namely APT-LLM.\nFirstly, we introduce a novel data format, bipolar-INT, which allows for\nefficient and lossless conversion with signed INT, while also being more\nconducive to parallel computation. We also develop a matrix multiplication\n(MatMul) method allowing for arbitrary precision by dismantling and\nreassembling matrices at the bit level. This method provides flexible precision\nand optimizes the utilization of GPU Tensor Cores. In addition, we propose a\nmemory management system focused on data recovery, which strategically employs\nfast shared memory to substantially increase kernel execution speed and reduce\nmemory access latency. Finally, we develop a kernel mapping method that\ndynamically selects the optimal configurable hyperparameters of kernels for\nvarying matrix sizes, enabling optimal performance across different LLM\narchitectures and precision settings.

Methods:We reformulate a previously\nproposed momentum-equation-based post-processing method (SPREME) as a\nregularization term directly integrated into an image registration energy\nfunctional. Four regularization types are implemented and compared: a strain\nmagnitude ($\\R_\\epsilon$), a strain magnitude with incompressibility constraint\n($R_{\\epsilon i}$), and a momentum-based regularization under plane strain\n($R_{P\\epsilon}$) and plane stress ($R_{P\\sigma}$) assumptions.

    "abstract": "Large language model (LLM)-based agents have demonstrated remarkable\ncapabilities in decision-making tasks, but struggle significantly with complex,\nlong-horizon planning scenarios. This arises from their lack of macroscopic\nguidance, causing disorientation and failures in complex tasks, as well as\ninsufficient continuous oversight during execution, rendering them unresponsive\nto environmental changes and prone to deviations. To tackle these challenges,\nwe introduce HiPlan, a hierarchical planning framework that provides adaptive\nglobal-local guidance to boost LLM-based agents'decision-making. HiPlan\ndecomposes complex tasks into milestone action guides for general direction and\nstep-wise hints for detailed actions. During the offline phase, we construct a\nmilestone library from expert demonstrations, enabling structured experience\nreuse by retrieving semantically similar tasks and milestones. In the execution\nphase, trajectory segments from past milestones are dynamically adapted to\ngenerate step-wise hints that align current observations with the milestone\nobjectives, bridging gaps and correcting deviations. Extensive experiments\nacross two challenging benchmarks demonstrate that HiPlan substantially\noutperforms strong baselines, and ablation studies validate the complementary\nbenefits of its hierarchical components.",

    "abstract": "Analog quantum simulators with global control fields have emerged as powerful\nplatforms for exploring complex quantum phenomena. Recent breakthroughs, such\nas the coherent control of thousands of atoms, highlight the growing potential\nfor quantum applications at scale. Despite these advances, a fundamental\ntheoretical question remains unresolved: to what extent can such systems\nrealize universal quantum dynamics under global control? Here we establish a\nnecessary and sufficient condition for universal quantum computation using only\nglobal pulse control, proving that a broad class of analog quantum simulators\nis, in fact, universal. We further extend this framework to fermionic and\nbosonic systems, including modern platforms such as ultracold atoms in optical\nsuperlattices. Crucially, to connect the theoretical possibility with\nexperimental reality, we introduce a new control technique into the experiment\n- direct quantum optimal control. This method enables the synthesis of complex\neffective Hamiltonians and allows us to incorporate realistic hardware\nconstraints. To show its practical power, we experimentally engineer three-body\ninteractions outside the blockade regime and demonstrate topological dynamics\non a Rydberg atom array. Using the new control framework, we overcome key\nexperimental challenges, including hardware limitations and atom position\nfluctuations in the non-blockade regime, by identifying smooth, short-duration\npulses that achieve high-fidelity dynamics. Experimental measurements reveal\ndynamical signatures of symmetry-protected-topological edge modes, confirming\nboth the expressivity and feasibility of our approach. Our work opens a new\navenue for quantum simulation beyond native hardware Hamiltonians, enabling the\nengineering of effective multi-body interactions and advancing the frontier of\nquantum information processing with globally-controlled analog platforms.",

Existing methods primarily focus on LLM training and prompt\ndesign that utilize LLMs to generate executable programs directly from user\ntasks in natural language. However, due to the inconsistency of the LLMs and\nthe high complexity of the tasks, such best-effort approaches often lead to\ntremendous programming errors in the generated code, which significantly\nundermines the effectiveness especially when the light-weight LLMs are applied.\nThis paper introduces a natural-robotic language translation framework that (i)\nprovides correctness verification for generated control programs and (ii)\nenhances the performance of LLMs in program generation via feedback-based\nfine-tuning for the programs. To achieve this, a Robot Skill Language (RSL) is\nproposed to abstract away from the intricate details of the control programs,\nbridging the natural language tasks with the underlying robot skills. Then, the\nRSL compiler and debugger are constructed to verify RSL programs generated by\nthe LLM and provide error feedback to the LLM for refining the outputs until\nbeing verified by the compiler. This provides correctness guarantees for the\nLLM-generated programs before being offloaded to the robots for execution,\nsignificantly enhancing the effectiveness of LLM-powered robotic applications.\nExperiments demonstrate NRTrans outperforms the existing method under a range\nof LLMs and tasks, and achieves a high success rate for light-weight LLMs.",

    "abstract": "Empirical science needs to be based on facts and claims that can be\nreproduced. This calls for replicating the studies that proclaim the claims,\nbut practice in most fields still fails to implement this idea. When such\nstudies emerged in the past decade, the results were generally disappointing.\nThere have been an overwhelming number of papers addressing the\n``reproducibility crisis'' in the last 20 years. Nevertheless, terminology is\nnot yet settled, and there is no consensus about when a replication should be\ncalled successful. This paper intends to clarify such issues. A fundamental\nproblem in empirical science is that usual claims only state that effects are\nnon-zero, and such statements are scientifically void. An effect must have a\n\\emph{relevant} size to become a reasonable item of knowledge. Therefore,\nestimation of an effect, with an indication of precision, forms a substantial\nscientific task, whereas testing it against zero does not. A relevant effect is\none that is shown to exceed a relevance threshold. This paradigm has\nimplications for the judgement on replication success.\n  A further issue is the unavoidable variability between studies, called\nheterogeneity in meta-analysis. Therefore, it is of little value, again, to\ntest for zero difference between an original effect and its replication, but\nexceedance of a corresponding relevance threshold should be tested. In order to\nestimate the degree of heterogeneity, more than one replication is needed, and\nan appropriate indication of the precision of an estimated effect requires such\nan estimate.\n  These insights, which are discussed in the paper, show the complexity of\nobtaining solid scientific results, implying the need for a strategy to make\nreplication happen.",

Such networks present unprecedented challenges due to their\ndynamic nature, which state-of-the-art data transport protocols do not address.\nThese challenges include: (1) non-congestive latency variation and loss, caused\nby continuous satellite movement and fluctuating link quality due to weather\neffects; (2) transient hotspots leading to buffer build-up, latency inflation,\nand potential packet loss; and (3) frequent handovers, which may result in\ntemporary connectivity loss and re-routing through paths with unknown\ncongestion and delay characteristics. In this paper, we introduce LeoTCP, a\nnovel data transport protocol designed specifically to address these\nchallenges. LeoTCP leverages in-network telemetry (INT) to gather congestion\ninformation on a per-hop basis. Using this information, LeoTCP (1) minimises\nboth buffer occupancy and latency for end users, (2) maximises application\nthroughput and network utilisation, and (3) swiftly reacts to network hotspots.\nWe compare LeoTCP to state-of-the-art data transport protocols using a LEO\nsatellite simulation model and targeted micro-benchmarks, both based on\nOMNeT++/INET. The simulation model captures RTT dynamics in a simulated LEO\nsatellite constellation, while the micro-benchmarks isolate key LEO-specific\ncharacteristics, including non-congestive latency variation and loss, path\nchanges, and congestion hotspots.

    "abstract": "In the search for life in the Universe, molecular oxygen (O$_2$) combined\nwith a reducing species, such as methane (CH$_4$), is considered a promising\ndisequilibrium biosignature. In cases where it would be difficult or impossible\nto detect O$_2$ (e.g., mid-IR or low O$_2$ levels), it has been suggested that\nozone (O$_3$), the photochemical product of O$_2$, could be used as a proxy for\ndetermining the abundance of O$_2$. As the O$_2$-O$_3$ relationship is\nnonlinear, the goal of this series of papers is to explore how it would change\nfor different host stars and atmospheric compositions and learning how to use\nO$_3$ to infer O$_2$. We used photochemistry and climate modeling to further\nexplore the O$_2$-O$_3$ relationship by modeling Earth-like planets with the\npresent atmospheric level (PAL) of O$_2$ between 0.01% to 150% along with high\nand low CH$_4$ abundances of 1000% and 10% PAL, respectively. Methane is of\ninterest not only because it is a biosignature, but also the source of hydrogen\natoms for hydrogen oxide (HO$_x$) which destroys O$_3$ through catalytic cycles\nand acts as a catalyst for the smog mechanism of O$_3$ formation in the lower\natmosphere. We find varying CH$_4$ causes changes to the O$_2$-O$_3$\nrelationship in ways that are highly dependent on both host star and O$_2$\nabundance. A striking result for high CH$_4$ models in high O$_2$ atmospheres\naround hotter hosts is that enough CH$_4$ is efficiently converted into H$_2$O\nto significantly impact stratospheric temperatures, and therefore the\nformation/destruction rates of O$_3$. Changes in HO$_x$ also influenced the\nHO$_x$ catalytic cycle and smog O$_3$, causing variations in harmful UV\nreaching the surface as well as changes in the 9.6~$\\mu$m O$_3$ feature in\nemission spectra. This demonstrates the need to explore the O$_2$-O$_3$\nrelationship in order to use O$_3$ as a reliable proxy for O$_2$ in future\nobservations.",

    "abstract": "Triangle counting is a fundamental problem in graph mining, essential for\nanalyzing graph streams with arbitrary edge orders. However, exact counting\nbecomes impractical due to the massive size of real-world graph streams. To\naddress this, approximate algorithms have been developed, but existing\ndistributed streaming algorithms lack adaptability and struggle with edge\ndeletions. In this article, we propose DTC, a novel family of single-pass\ndistributed streaming algorithms for global and local triangle counting in\nfully dynamic graph streams. Our DTC-AR algorithm accurately estimates triangle\ncounts without prior knowledge of graph size, leveraging multi-machine\nresources. Additionally, we introduce DTC-FD, an algorithm tailored for fully\ndynamic graph streams, incorporating edge insertions and deletions. Using\nRandom Pairing and future edge insertion compensation, DTC-FD achieves unbiased\nand accurate approximations across multiple machines. Experimental results\ndemonstrate significant improvements over baselines. DTC-AR achieves up to\n$2029.4\\times$ and $27.1\\times$ more accuracy, while maintaining the best\ntrade-off between accuracy and storage space. DTC-FD reduces estimation errors\nby up to $32.5\\times$ and $19.3\\times$, scaling linearly with graph stream\nsize.

By comparison with planet\nevolutionary models, we find a mass of the planet of $4.9^{+0.9}_{-0.6}$\nJupiter masses. This mass is also consistent with the width of the observed\ndisk gap, retrieved from hydrodynamic models.

In this work, we establish that GNNs can serve purposes beyond their\ntraditional role, and be exploited to generate numerical schemes, in\nconjunction with symbolic regression. First, we show numerically and\ntheoretically that a GNN trained on a dataset consisting solely of two-node\ngraphs can extrapolate a first-order Finite Volume (FV) scheme for the heat\nequation on out-of-distribution, unstructured meshes. Specifically, if a GNN\nachieves a loss $\\varepsilon$ on such a dataset, it implements the FV scheme\nwith an error of $\\mathcal{O}(\\varepsilon)$. Using symbolic regression, we show\nthat the network effectively rediscovers the exact analytical formulation of\nthe standard first-order FV scheme. We then extend this approach to an\nunsupervised context: the GNN recovers the first-order FV scheme using only a\nresidual loss similar to Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) with no\naccess to ground-truth data. Finally, we push the methodology further by\nconsidering higher-order schemes: we train (i) a 2-hop and (ii) a 2-layers GNN\nusing the same PINN loss, that autonomously discover (i) a second-order\ncorrection term to the initial scheme using a 2-hop stencil, and (ii) the\nclassic second-order midpoint scheme.

    "abstract": "We perform direct numerical simulations of flows over finite-aspect-ratio\nrotating circular cylinders at a Reynolds number of 150 over a range of aspect\nratios ($AR=2-12$) and rotation rates ($\\alpha=0-5$), aiming at revealing the\nfree-end effects on the wake dynamics and aerodynamic performance. As a direct\nconsequence of lift generation, a pair of counter-rotating tip vortices is\nformed at the free ends. At low rotation rates, the finite rotating cylinder\nbehaves like a typical bluff body that generates unsteady vortex shedding with\nthree-dimensional modal structures. Such unsteady flows can be stabilized not\nonly by increasing rotation rate that weakens the free shear layer, but also by\ndecreasing aspect ratio which enhances the tip-vortex-induced downwash. A\nfurther increase of $\\alpha$ triggers the onset of unsteadiness in the tip\nvortices. At still higher rotation rates, the C-shaped Taylor-like vortices\nbounded on the cylinder surface emerge from the free ends and propel towards\nthe midspan due to the self-induced velocity by vortex-wall interaction. With\nincreasing $\\alpha$, the free-end effects penetrate to the inboard span,\nleading to reduced lift and elevated drag compared to the two-dimensional\nflows. The three-dimensional end effects can be effectively suppressed by the\naddition of end plates, which position the tip vortices away from the cylinder,\nthereby significantly improving the aerodynamic performance. This study reveals\nthe mechanisms for the formation of three-dimensional wakes under the influence\nof the free ends of finite rotating cylinders. The insights obtained here can\nserve as a stepping stone for understanding the complex high-$Re$ flows that\nare more relevant to industrial applications.",

However, building such a practical\nsystem that can interact with diverse input signals in real time remains\nchallenging to existing methods, which often struggle with heavy computational\ncost and limited controllability. In this work, we introduce an autoregressive\nvideo generation framework that enables interactive multimodal control and\nlow-latency extrapolation in a streaming manner. With minimal modifications to\na standard large language model (LLM), our framework accepts multimodal\ncondition encodings including audio, pose, and text, and outputs spatially and\nsemantically coherent representations to guide the denoising process of a\ndiffusion head. To support this, we construct a large-scale dialogue dataset of\napproximately 20,000 hours from multiple sources, providing rich conversational\nscenarios for training. We further introduce a deep compression autoencoder\nwith up to 64$\\times$ reduction ratio, which effectively alleviates the\nlong-horizon inference burden of the autoregressive model. Extensive\nexperiments on duplex conversation, multilingual human synthesis, and\ninteractive world model highlight the advantages of our approach in low\nlatency, high efficiency, and fine-grained multimodal controllability.",

    "abstract": "Multi-stage stochastic optimization is a well-known quantitative tool for\ndecision-making under uncertainty. It is broadly used in financial and\ninvestment planning, inventory control, and also natural disaster risk\nmanagement. Theoretical solutions of multi-stage stochastic programs can be\nfound explicitly only in very exceptional cases due to their variational form\nand interdependency of uncertainty in time. Nevertheless, numerical solutions\nare often inaccurate, as they rely on Monte-Carlo sampling, which requires the\nLaw of Large Numbers to hold for the approximation quality. In this article, we\nintroduce a new approximation scheme, which computes and groups together\nstage-wise optimal quantizers of conditional Fr\\'echet distributions for\noptimal weighting of value functions in the dynamic programming. We consider\noptimality of scenario quantization methods in the sense of minimal\nKantorovich-Wasserstein distance at each stage of the scenario tree. By this,\nwe bound the approximation error with convergence guarantees. We also provide\nglobal solution guarantees under convexity and monotonicity conditions on the\nvalue function. We apply the developed methods to the governmental budget\nallocation problem for risk management of flood events in Austria. For this, we\npropose an extremely efficient way to approximate optimal quantizers for\nconditional Fr\\'echet distributions. Our approach allows to enhance the overall\nefficiency of dynamic programming via the use of different parameter estimation\nmethods for different groups of quantizers. The groups are distinguished by a\nparticular risk threshold and are able to differentiate between higher- and\nlower-impact flood events.",

Ferrimagnetic yttrium\niron garnet (YIG), known for its exceptionally long magnon lifetimes, is a\ncornerstone material for magnonics and is typically grown into thin films on\ngadolinium gallium garnet (GGG) substrates due to near-perfect lattice\nmatching. However, the paramagnetic nature of GGG introduces damping mechanisms\ndetrimental to quantum applications at low temperatures.

Our results demonstrate that the YIG/YSGAG system maintains\nlow magnetic damping from room temperature, with $\\alpha = 4.29\\times10^{-5}$,\nwhich is the lowest value reported so far for YIG/GGG films and comparable to\nthe best YIG bulk material, and down to 30$\\,$mK, with no significant\ntemperature-dependent increase in damping.

The analysis reveals that AI technologies are reshaping\ndemocratic processes in fundamental ways: enabling mass-scale deliberation,\nchanging how citizens access and engage with political information, and\ntransforming how representatives make and implement decisions. While AI offers\nunprecedented opportunities for enhancing democratic participation and\ngovernance efficiency, it also presents significant challenges to democratic\nlegitimacy and accountability. Social media platforms' AI-driven algorithms\ncurrently mediate much political discourse, creating concerns about information\nmanipulation and privacy. Large Language Models introduce both epistemic\nchallenges and potential tools for improving democratic dialogue. The emergence\nof Mass Online Deliberation platforms suggests possibilities for scaling up\nmeaningful citizen participation, while Algorithmic Decision-Making systems\npromise more efficient policy implementation but face limitations in handling\ncomplex political trade-offs. As these systems become prevalent,\nrepresentatives may assume the role of architects of automated decision\nframeworks, responsible for guiding the translation of politically contested\nconcepts into technical parameters and metrics. Advanced deliberation platforms\noffering real-time insights into citizen preferences will challenge traditional\nrepresentative independence and discretion to interpret public will.

To tackle this challenge,\nwe present OrthoVortex, a novel framework that estimates the misalignment\nangles and applies the appropriate phase correction to restore orthogonality\nbetween modes. Unlike purely theoretical prior efforts that rely on impractical\nfully digital arrays or exhaustive beam scans, OrthoVortex introduces and\nleverages the cross-modal phase, as a unique signature for identifying the\nmisalignment angles. OrthoVortex is a few-shot alignment technique, making it\nfeasible for real-world implementations. Our key contributions include: (i) a\nrobust angle estimation and phase correction framework based on the physics of\nOAM propagation that estimates the misalignment and restores modal\northogonality, (ii) the first-ever experimental validation of OAM beam\nalignment with RF transceivers, and (iii) a comprehensive analysis of practical\nconstraints, including the impact of antenna count and bandwidth. Simulations\nand over-the-air measurements using low-cost, rapidly prototyped metasurfaces\noperating at 120 GHz demonstrate that OrthoVortex achieves fast and precise\nmisalignment estimation (mean absolute error of $0.69^{\\circ}$ for azimuth and\n$2.54^{\\circ}$ for elevation angle). Further, OrthoVortex can mitigate the\ninter-modal interference, yielding more than 12 dB increase in\nsignal-to-interference ratio and more than 4.5-fold improvement in link\ncapacity.",

Additionally, these databases\nsuffer from significant data imbalances: fewer large, critically damaging\nrecords near the fault compared to abundant, less severely damaging distant\nrecords. These two limitations are addressed in this work by developing a\ntransparent ML architecture using the HazBinLoss function. Each input (e.g.,\nmagnitude, distance, their interaction term, etc.) is processed separately and\nadded linearly to obtain the output, resulting in exact contribution of each\nterm. The HazBinLoss function assigns higher weights to critical near-field\nlarge magnitude records and lower weights to less-critical far-field smaller\nmagnitude records, during training to prevent underprediction of the most\ndamaging scenarios. Our model captures known seismological principles and\nachieves comparable performance with established GMMs while maintaining\ntransparency.

    "abstract": "Ionic transport in nanofluidic channels holds great promise for applications\nsuch as single-molecule analysis, molecular manipulation, and energy\nharvesting. However, achieving precise control over ion transport remains a\nmajor challenge. In this work, we introduce a MoS2 SiN hybrid nanochannel\narchitecture that enables electrical tuning of ionic transport via external\ngating, and we examine its potential for osmotic power generation and single\nmolecule detection. To fabricate the channels, we employed a combined focused\nion beam (FIB) milling and dry transfer method, producing sub 10 nm thick\nstructures while preserving the structural integrity and electronic properties\nof MoS2, essential for reliable surface charge modulation. We first\ninvestigated how the gate voltage influences ionic conductance, finding\nevidence of gate dependent modulation of ion selectivity under different bias\npolarities. Next, by applying a salt concentration gradient across the\nnanochannels, we demonstrated the feasibility of this platform for osmotic\nenergy harvesting. Finally, we tested the system for single molecule sensing,\nshowing that linearized bovine serum albumin (BSA) produced translocation\nsignals with notably long dwell times. Together, these results highlight gated\nMoS2 SiN nanochannels as a promising platform for tunable nanofluidics, with\npotential applications in controlled molecular transport and energy harvesting\nfrom osmotic gradients.",

By coarse-graining cell trajectories\nover multiple spatial windows, we find that cell velocity correlates positively\nwith local density at small scales, but negatively at large scales.

A minimal model incorporating\nactivity-induced shape changes reproduces this crossover and identifies the\ncompetition between active force generation and mechanical confinement as the\nunderlying mechanism.

In this paper, we present mmKey, a novel\nPLKG framework that capitalizes on the availability of multiple antennas at\nmmWave wireless nodes to inject randomness into an otherwise quasi-static\nwireless channel. Different from prior works that sacrifice either the secrecy\nof the key generation or the robustness, mmKey balances these two requirements.\nIn particular, mmKey leverages a genetic algorithm to gradually evolve the\ninitial weight vector population toward configurations that suppress the LOS\ncomponent while taking into account the channel conditions, specifically, the\nsparsity and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Extensive simulations show that\nmmKey improves the secrecy gap by an average of 39.4% over random beamforming\nand 34.0% over null beamforming, outperforming conventional schemes.",

While humans typically learn norms through embodied\nsocial experience, we investigated whether large language models can achieve\nsophisticated norm understanding through statistical learning alone. Across two\nstudies, we systematically evaluated multiple AI systems' ability to predict\nhuman social appropriateness judgments for 555 everyday scenarios by examining\nhow closely they predicted the average judgment compared to each human\nparticipant. In Study 1, GPT-4.5's accuracy in predicting the collective\njudgment on a continuous scale exceeded that of every human participant (100th\npercentile).

These findings\ndemonstrate that sophisticated models of social cognition can emerge from\nstatistical learning over linguistic data alone, challenging strong versions of\ntheories emphasizing the exclusive necessity of embodied experience for\ncultural competence. The systematic nature of AI limitations across different\narchitectures indicates potential boundaries of pattern-based social\nunderstanding, while the models' ability to outperform nearly all individual\nhumans in this predictive task suggests that language serves as a remarkably\nrich repository for cultural knowledge transmission.",

The majority of\ncurrent approaches for roof plane segmentation rely on the manually designed or\nlearned features followed by some specifically designed geometric clustering\nstrategies. Because the learned features are more powerful than the manually\ndesigned features, the deep learning-based approaches usually perform better\nthan the traditional approaches. However, the current deep learning-based\napproaches have three unsolved problems. The first is that most of them are not\ntruly end-to-end, the plane segmentation results may be not optimal. The second\nis that the point feature discriminability near the edges is relatively low,\nleading to inaccurate planar edges. The third is that the planar geometric\ncharacteristics are not sufficiently considered to constrain the network\ntraining. To solve these issues, a novel edge-aware transformer-based network,\nnamed RoofSeg, is developed for segmenting roof planes from LiDAR point clouds\nin a truly end-to-end manner. In the RoofSeg, we leverage a transformer\nencoder-decoder-based framework to hierarchically predict the plane instance\nmasks with the use of a set of learnable plane queries. To further improve the\nsegmentation accuracy of edge regions, we also design an Edge-Aware Mask Module\n(EAMM) that sufficiently incorporates planar geometric prior of edges to\nenhance its discriminability for plane instance mask refinement. In addition,\nwe propose an adaptive weighting strategy in the mask loss to reduce the\ninfluence of misclassified points, and also propose a new plane geometric loss\nto constrain the network training.",

In this work, we propose MOSA\n(Mixture of Simple Adapters), leveraging a Mixture-of-Experts mechanism to\ncombine lightweight adapters that learn shared and language-specific knowledge.\nThis enables better utilization of high-resource language data to support\nlow-resource languages, mitigating data scarcity issues. Experimental results\nshow that MOSA-Base achieves a 15.4\\% relative reduction in average WER\ncompared to the Baseline-Base and consistently outperforms it across all\nlanguages. Remarkably, MOSA-Base surpasses the Baseline-Base even when trained\nwith only 60\\% of its parameters. Similarly, MOSA-Large outperforms the\nBaseline-Large in average WER and demonstrates greater robustness to data\nimbalance. Ablation studies further indicate that MOSA is more effective at\nhandling individual languages and learning both language-specific and shared\nlinguistic knowledge. These findings support that, in LLM-based ASR, a mixture\nof simple adapters is more effective than a single, complex adapter design.",

In this work, we proposed the Iterative\nPartition Search Algorithm (IPSA), which is a targeted synthesis and refinement\nof these preceding methods. Our algorithm inherits the core idea of\n``partitioning to circumvent the zero vector\" from PSA and the ``iterative\nlattice basis reduction\" framework from IQOAP. A key feature of IPSA is the\n``1-tailed search spaces\", which can be viewed as a highly constrained variant\nof PSA's partitioning strategy, specifically designed for optimal performance\nwithin IQOAP's iterative structure. We supplant IQOAP's fixed iteration count\nwith a dynamic, stack-managed process and substitute a more expressive and\nshallower circuit structure for its original ansatz. Crucially, the 1-tailed\ndesign fundamentally ensures that every successful VQA execution yields an\neffective lattice basis update, thereby eliminating the issue of ineffective\niterations in IQOAP. This evolutionary path of refinement allows IPSA to\novercome the drawbacks of its predecessors precisely. Numerical simulations on\n4- to 6-dimensional SVP instances demonstrate that IPSA achieves at least a\n73\\% improvement in success rate for finding optimal solutions and over a 35\\%\nimprovement in average solution quality compared with the methods above while\nmaintaining comparable total circuit depth.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a framework for the categorification of the\nLe-Murakami-Ohtsuki (LMO) invariant of 3-manifolds, defining a new invariant,\nthe LMO Spectrum, via factorization homology. The theoretical foundation of\nthis framework is the main algebraic result of this paper (Theorem A): a proof\nthat the algebra of Jacobi diagrams, A_Jac, possesses the structure of a\nhomotopy E3-algebra. This algebraic structure is shown to be a consequence of\n3-dimensional geometry, originating from a \"Tetrahedron Principle\" where the\nfundamental IHX relation is interpreted as an algebraic manifestation of the\ntetrahedron's combinatorial properties. This geometric perspective is used to\nprovide a rigorous proof of the \"Principle of Decomposability\" that underpins\nthe Goussarov-Habiro clasper calculus, thereby supplying a mathematical\njustification for the consistency of this geometric surgery theory. To\nestablish a computational basis, the framework is built from the first\nprinciples of factorization homology, from which a universal surgery formula is\nderived via the excision axiom (Theorem B) independently of any conjectural\nmodels. The utility of this axiomatically-grounded theory is demonstrated by\nconstructing a new observable, the \"H_1-decorated LMO invariant.\" This\ninvariant is defined in accordance with the principles of TQFT, where the\nevaluation of a closed diagram (a numerical invariant) is the trace of the\ncorresponding open diagram (an operator). As the main applied result of this\npaper (Theorem C), it is proven that this invariant distinguishes the lens\nspaces L(156, 5) and L(156, 29), a pair known to be indistinguishable by the\nclassical LMO invariant. This result validates the proposed framework and\nestablishes the LMO Spectrum as a new tool in quantum topology that unifies the\ngeometric intuition of clasper theory with the algebraic rigor of modern\nhomotopy theory.",

As a result, this design reduces memory usage and data transfer,\nwhile largely eliminating PCIe overhead. In addition, we introduce a scheduling\npolicy that maximizes the reuse ratio of GPU-cached experts, further boosting\nefficiency.

Modern forecasting models are generally opaque and do\nnot provide explanations for their forecasts, while well-known post-hoc\nexplainability methods like LIME are not suitable for the forecasting context.\nWe propose PAX-TS, a model-agnostic post-hoc algorithm to explain time series\nforecasting models and their forecasts. Our method is based on localized input\nperturbations and results in multi-granular explanations. Further, it is able\nto characterize cross-channel correlations for multivariate time series\nforecasts. We clearly outline the algorithmic procedure behind PAX-TS,\ndemonstrate it on a benchmark with 7 algorithms and 10 diverse datasets,\ncompare it with two other state-of-the-art explanation algorithms, and present\nthe different explanation types of the method. We found that the explanations\nof high-performing and low-performing algorithms differ on the same datasets,\nhighlighting that the explanations of PAX-TS effectively capture a model's\nbehavior. Based on time step correlation matrices resulting from the benchmark,\nwe identify 6 classes of patterns that repeatedly occur across different\ndatasets and algorithms. We found that the patterns are indicators of\nperformance, with noticeable differences in forecasting error between the\nclasses. Lastly, we outline a multivariate example where PAX-TS demonstrates\nhow the forecasting model takes cross-channel correlations into account.

However, MRI\nacquisition is typically time-consuming, leading to patient discomfort and\nincreased costs to the healthcare system. Recent years have seen substantial\nresearch effort into the development of methods that allow for accelerated MRI\nacquisition while still obtaining a reconstruction that appears similar to the\nfully-sampled MR image. However, for many applications a perfectly\nreconstructed MR image may not be necessary, particularly, when the primary\ngoal is a downstream task such as segmentation. This has led to growing\ninterest in methods that aim to perform segmentation directly on accelerated\nMRI data. Despite recent advances, existing methods have largely been developed\nin isolation, without direct comparison to one another, often using separate or\nprivate datasets, and lacking unified evaluation standards. To date, no\nhigh-quality, comprehensive comparison of these methods exists, and the optimal\nstrategy for segmenting accelerated MR data remains unknown. This paper\nprovides the first unified benchmark for the segmentation of undersampled MRI\ndata comparing 7 approaches. A particular focus is placed on comparing\n\\textit{one-stage approaches}, that combine reconstruction and segmentation\ninto a unified model, with \\textit{two-stage approaches}, that utilize\nestablished MRI reconstruction methods followed by a segmentation network. We\ntest these methods on two MRI datasets that include multi-coil k-space data as\nwell as a human-annotated segmentation ground-truth.

However, the influence of these configurations\non magnetospheric accretion remains poorly understood. Aims: We aim to simulate\nmagnetospheric accretion incorporating non-dipolar and strong magnetic field.\nOur model is informed by observations of IRAS 17449+2320, a post-merger\nbelonging to the group of FS CMa stars, which indicate a dominant dipolar\nmagnetic field with an additional quadrupole component. Methods: Using the\nPLUTO code, we conduct 2.5-D non-ideal viscous-resistive magnetohydrodynamical\n(MHD) simulations of star-disk magnetospheric interactions. We consider a thin\naccretion disk and strong stellar magnetic field ($B_\\star= 6.2\\mathrm{kG}$)\nunder four configurations: pure dipole, pure quadrupole, dipole plus\nquadrupole, and dipole plus octupole. In the latter two cases, different\nmagnetic polar strength ratios are explored. Results: For asymmetric magnetic\nfield configurations, we find that accretion exhibits funnel streams below the\nmidplane, indicating the dominance of the quadrupolar and octupolar components.\nIn contrast, in dipolar configurations, we observe the formation of two\nsymmetrical funnels with respect to the midplane. However, in the quadrupolar\nconfiguration, accretion is entirely confined to the disk midplane forming a\ncone-like pattern that leads to disk widening. Remarkably, the presence of a\nquadrupolar component gives rise to highly asymmetric substructures in the\ncorona region. Conclusions: Multipolar stellar magnetic fields drive\nnon-uniform accretion and lead to asymmetric density distributions in both the\ndisk and corona. These results resemble observed features of some FS CMa\npost-mergers and Herbig Ae/Be stars, highlighting the critical role of magnetic\nfield complexity in shaping circumstellar environments.",

VL methods, a.o., can be distinguished based on how they represent the\nscene, e.g., explicitly through a (sparse) point cloud or a collection of\nimages or implicitly through the weights of a neural network. Recently,\nNeRF-based methods have become popular for VL. While NeRFs offer high-quality\nnovel view synthesis, they inadvertently encode fine scene details, raising\nprivacy concerns when deployed in cloud-based localization services as\nsensitive information could be recovered. In this paper, we tackle this\nchallenge on two ends. We first propose a new protocol to assess\nprivacy-preservation of NeRF-based representations. We show that NeRFs trained\nwith photometric losses store fine-grained details in their geometry\nrepresentations, making them vulnerable to privacy attacks, even if the head\nthat predicts colors is removed. Second, we propose ppNeSF (Privacy-Preserving\nNeural Segmentation Field), a NeRF variant trained with segmentation\nsupervision instead of RGB images. These segmentation labels are learned in a\nself-supervised manner, ensuring they are coarse enough to obscure identifiable\nscene details while remaining discriminativeness in 3D.

We optimize\nthe supercritical flame simulation software DeepFlame -- which incorporates\ndeep neural networks while retaining the real-fluid mechanical and chemical\naccuracy -- from three perspectives: parallel computing, computational\nefficiency, and I/O performance. Our highly optimized DeepFlame achieves\nsupercritical liquid oxygen/methane (LOX/\\ce{CH4}) turbulent combustion\nsimulation of up to 618 and 154 billion cells with unprecedented\ntime-to-solution, attaining 439/1186 and 187/316 PFlop/s (32.3\\%/21.8\\% and\n37.4\\%/31.8\\% of the peak) in FP32/mixed-FP16 precision on Sunway (98,304\nnodes) and Fugaku (73,728 nodes) supercomputers, respectively. This\ncomputational capability surpasses existing capacities by three orders of\nmagnitude, enabling the first practical simulation of rocket engine combustion\nwith >100 LOX/\\ce{CH4} injectors. This breakthrough establishes high-fidelity\nsupercritical flame modeling as a critical design tool for next-generation\nrocket propulsion and ultra-high energy density systems.",

    "abstract": "The soft context formation coder is a pixel-wise state-of-the-art lossless\nscreen content coder using pattern matching and color palette coding in\ncombination with arithmetic coding. It achieves excellent compression\nperformance on screen content images in RGB 4:4:4 format with few distinct\ncolors. In contrast to many other lossless compression methods, it codes entire\ncolor pixels at once, i.e., all color components of one pixel are coded\ntogether. Consequently, it does not natively support image formats with\ndownsampled chroma, such as YCbCr 4:2:0, which is an often used chroma format\nin video compression. In this paper, we extend the soft context formation\ncoding capabilities to 4:2:0 image compression, by successively coding Y and\nCbCr planes based on an analysis of normalized mutual information between image\nplanes. Additionally, we propose an enhancement to the chroma prediction based\non the luminance plane. Furthermore, we propose to transmit side-information\nabout occurring luma-chroma combinations to improve chroma probability\ndistribution modelling. Averaged over a large screen content image dataset, our\nproposed method outperforms HEVC-SCC, with HEVC-SCC needing 5.66% more bitrate\ncompared to our method.",

The algorithm uses the elliptic tangent intersection\nmethod to generate feasible paths. It generates two sub-paths for each threat,\nselects the optimal route based on a heuristic rule, and iteratively refines\nthe path until the target is reached. Considering the UAV kinematic and dynamic\nconstraints, a modified smoothing technique based on quadratic B\\'ezier curves\nis adopted to generate a smooth and efficient route. Experimental results show\nthat the TIG algorithm can generate the shortest path in less time, starting\nfrom 0.01 seconds, with fewer turning angles compared to A*, PRM, RRT*, Tangent\nGraph, and Static APPATT algorithms in static environments. Furthermore, in\ncompletely unknown and partially known environments, TIG demonstrates efficient\nreal-time path planning capabilities for collision avoidance, outperforming APF\nand Dynamic APPATT algorithms.",

    "abstract": "Existing literature typically treats style-driven and subject-driven\ngeneration as two disjoint tasks: the former prioritizes stylistic similarity,\nwhereas the latter insists on subject consistency, resulting in an apparent\nantagonism. We argue that both objectives can be unified under a single\nframework because they ultimately concern the disentanglement and\nre-composition of content and style, a long-standing theme in style-driven\nresearch. To this end, we present USO, a Unified Style-Subject Optimized\ncustomization model. First, we construct a large-scale triplet dataset\nconsisting of content images, style images, and their corresponding stylized\ncontent images. Second, we introduce a disentangled learning scheme that\nsimultaneously aligns style features and disentangles content from style\nthrough two complementary objectives, style-alignment training and\ncontent-style disentanglement training. Third, we incorporate a style\nreward-learning paradigm denoted as SRL to further enhance the model's\nperformance. Finally, we release USO-Bench, the first benchmark that jointly\nevaluates style similarity and subject fidelity across multiple metrics.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that USO achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance among open-source models along both dimensions of subject\nconsistency and style similarity.

Each has its own strengths and\nweaknesses, so there are benefits to both approaches. This is especially true\nfor challenging targets such as cooler, smaller exoplanets whose atmospheres\nlikely contain many molecular species and cloud decks.\n  We aim to study the atmosphere of the warm Neptune-like exoplanet WASP-107 b\n(Teq~740 K). Several molecular species have been detected in this exoplanet in\nrecent space-based JWST studies, and we aim to confirm and expand upon these\ndetections using ground-based VLT, evaluating how well our findings agree with\npreviously retrieved atmospheric parameters.\n  We observe two transits of WASP-107 b with VLT/CRIRES+ and create\ncross-correlation templates of the target atmosphere based on retrieval results\nfrom JWST studies. We create different templates to investigate the impact of\nvarying volume mixing ratios of species and inclusion or exclusion of clouds.\nConsidering this target's observational challenges, we create simulated\nobservations prior to evaluating real data to assess expected detection\nsignificances.\n  We report detections of two molecular species, CO (~6 S/N) and H2O (~4.5\nS/N). This confirms previous space-based detections and demonstrates, for the\nfirst time, the capability of VLT/CRIRES+ to detect species in targets cooler\nthan hot Jupiters using transmission spectroscopy. We show our analysis is\nsensitive to cloud inclusion, but less so to different volume mixing ratios.\nInterestingly, our detection deviates from its expected location in our Kp-vsys\ndiagrams, and we speculate on possible reasons for this. We demonstrate that\nthe error budget for relatively cooler exoplanets is severely reduced in\ncomparison to hotter exoplanets, and underline need for further work in context\nof high-resolution spectroscopy.",

    "abstract": "Testing compilers with AI models, especially large language models (LLMs),\nhas shown great promise. However, current approaches struggle with two key\nproblems: The generated programs for testing compilers are often too simple,\nand extensive testing with the LLMs is computationally expensive. In this\npaper, we propose a novel compiler testing framework that decouples the testing\nprocess into two distinct phases: an offline phase and an online phase. In the\noffline phase, we use LLMs to generate a collection of small but feature-rich\ncode pieces. In the online phase, we reuse these code pieces by strategically\ncombining them to build high-quality and valid test programs, which are then\nused to test compilers.\n  We implement this idea in a tool, LegoFuzz, for testing C compilers. The\nresults are striking: we found 66 bugs in GCC and LLVM, the most widely used C\ncompilers. Almost half of the bugs are miscompilation bugs, which are serious\nand hard-to-find bugs that none of the existing LLM-based tools could find. We\nbelieve this efficient design opens up new possibilities for using AI models in\nsoftware testing beyond just C compilers.",

To overcome the high computational load of the\nk-nearest neighbors method, the paper proposes using tree-like data structures\nbased on Kohonen self-organizing maps, thereby greatly accelerating nearest\nneighbor searches. Tests conducted on handwritten digit recognition and simple\nsubtitle translation tasks confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed\napproach. With only a slight reduction in accuracy, the nearest neighbor search\ntime was reduced hundreds of times compared to exhaustive search methods.

Consequently,\nmodels invoking newly formed millisecond magnetars have been widely proposed,\ncapable of supplying additional energy through magnetic dipole radiation. For\nthese rapidly rotating magnetars, however, gravitational-wave (GW) emission may\nalso contribute significantly to the spin-down, particularly during their early\nevolutionary stages. While high-energy photons initially remain trapped within\nthe optically thick ejecta, they will eventually escape as the ejecta becomes\ntransparent during the expansion, thereby influencing the late-time lightcurve.\nIn this work, we adopt an analytical framework to systematically explore the\ncombined effects of GW emission and high-energy leakage on the lightcurve of\nSLSNe. Compared to scenarios that neglect these processes, we find that for\nmagnetars with initial spin periods of millisecond, the combined influence\nsuppresses early-time luminosities but enhances late-time emission. We further\ninvestigate the effects of the neutron-star equation of state to the\nlightcurve, GW emission efficiency, ejecta mass, and other relevant quantities.\nOur results highlight the complex interplay between GW-driven spin-down and\nradiative transport in shaping the observable features of SLSNe, offering new\ninsights into diagnosing the nature of their central engines.",

By\nsegmenting pedestrian trajectories into fixed time bins and applying a\nTransformer-based pair classification model, we identify cohesive groups and\nisolate single pedestrians over a structured sequence-based filtering process.\nTo prepare for deeper analysis, we establish a comprehensive metric framework\nincorporating both spatial and behavioral dimensions. Spatial utilization\nmetrics include convex hull area, smallest enclosing circle radius, and\nheatmap-based spatial densities to characterize how different pedestrian types\noccupy and interact with space. Behavioral metrics such as velocity change,\nmotion angle deviation, clearance radius, and trajectory straightness are\ndesigned to capture local adaptations and responses during interactions.\nFurthermore, we introduce a typology of encounter types-single-to-single,\nsingle-to-group, and group-to-group to categorize and later quantify different\ninteraction scenarios. Although this version focuses primarily on the\nclassification pipeline and dataset structuring, it establishes the groundwork\nfor scalable analysis across different sequence lengths 60, 100, and 200\nframes. Future versions will incorporate complete quantitative analysis of the\nproposed metrics and their implications for pedestrian simulation and space\ndesign validation in crowd dynamics research.",

GNNs often learn 'spurious' correlations from superficial code\nsimilarities, producing detectors that fail to generalize well to unseen\nreal-world data. In this work, we propose a unified framework for robust and\ninterpretable vulnerability detection, called VISION, to mitigate spurious\ncorrelations by systematically augmenting a counterfactual training dataset.\nCounterfactuals are samples with minimal semantic modifications but opposite\nlabels. Our framework includes: (i) generating counterfactuals by prompting a\nLarge Language Model (LLM); (ii) targeted GNN training on paired code examples\nwith opposite labels; and (iii) graph-based interpretability to identify the\ncrucial code statements relevant for vulnerability predictions while ignoring\nspurious ones. We find that VISION reduces spurious learning and enables more\nrobust, generalizable detection, improving overall accuracy (from 51.8% to\n97.8%), pairwise contrast accuracy (from 4.5% to 95.8%), and worst-group\naccuracy (from 0.7% to 85.5%) on the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)-20\nvulnerability.

Several habitat\nclassification schemes are in use, typically based on analysis of satellite\nimagery with validation by field ecologists. Here we present a methodology for\nclassification of habitats based solely on ground-level imagery (photographs),\noffering improved validation and the ability to classify habitats at scale (for\nexample using citizen-science imagery). In collaboration with Natural England,\na public sector organisation responsible for nature conservation in England,\nthis study develops a classification system that applies deep learning to\nground-level habitat photographs, categorising each image into one of 18\nclasses defined by the 'Living England' framework. Images were pre-processed\nusing resizing, normalisation, and augmentation; re-sampling was used to\nbalance classes in the training data and enhance model robustness. We developed\nand fine-tuned a DeepLabV3-ResNet101 classifier to assign a habitat class label\nto each photograph. Using five-fold cross-validation, the model demonstrated\nstrong overall performance across 18 habitat classes, with accuracy and\nF1-scores varying between classes. Across all folds, the model achieved a mean\nF1-score of 0.61, with visually distinct habitats such as Bare Soil, Silt and\nPeat (BSSP) and Bare Sand (BS) reaching values above 0.90, and mixed or\nambiguous classes scoring lower. These findings demonstrate the potential of\nthis approach for ecological monitoring. Ground-level imagery is readily\nobtained, and accurate computational methods for habitat classification based\non such data have many potential applications.

Moreover, a comparison of lateral force maps on pristine and\nworn areas shows a considerable reduction of friction on both forms, which is\npossibly due to the significant smoothing of the surfaces caused by scratching.\nWith normal forces in the micro N range, the analysis is made difficult by the\nfact that the linear dimensions of the wear tracks are comparable to those of\nthe granular structures forming the surfaces. Even if the Archard equation\ncould not be tested in this case, the wear resistance is considerably larger on\namorphous MoS2 also on the nanoscale.

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in speaker verification techniques show promise, but\ntheir performance often deteriorates significantly in challenging acoustic\nenvironments. Although speech enhancement methods can improve perceived audio\nquality, they may unintentionally distort speaker-specific information, which\ncan affect verification accuracy. This problem has become more noticeable with\nthe increasing use of generative deep neural networks (DNNs) for speech\nenhancement. While these networks can produce intelligible speech even in\nconditions of very low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), they may also severely\nalter distinctive speaker characteristics. To tackle this issue, we propose a\nnovel neural network framework that effectively combines speaker embeddings\nextracted from both noisy and enhanced speech using a Siamese architecture.\nThis architecture allows us to leverage complementary information from both\nsources, enhancing the robustness of speaker verification under severe noise\nconditions. Our framework is lightweight and agnostic to specific speaker\nverification and speech enhancement techniques, enabling the use of a wide\nrange of state-of-the-art solutions without modification. Experimental results\ndemonstrate the superior performance of our proposed framework.",

DNP addresses these limitations by\nintroducing a global latent variable to model task-level variations and a local\nlatent variable to capture input similarity within a distance-preserving latent\nspace. This is achieved through bi-Lipschitz regularization, which bounds\ndistortions in input relationships and encourages the preservation of relative\ndistances in the latent space.

Given these developments, it is essential to\nexamine if and how companies report AI-related risks to the public. This study\npresents the first large-scale systematic analysis of AI risk disclosures in\nSEC 10-K filings, which require public companies to report material risks to\ntheir company.

    "abstract": "Using the newly proposed tetraquark Regge trajectory relations, we\ninvestigate three series of Regge trajectories for bottom-charm tetraquarks\n$(bq)(\\bar{c}\\bar{q}')$ and $(cq)(\\bar{b}\\bar{q}')$ with $q,q'=u,d,s$: the\n$\\rho_1$-, $\\rho_2$-, and $\\lambda$-trajectories. We provide rough estimates\nfor the masses of the $\\rho_1$-, $\\rho_2$-, and $\\lambda$-excited states.\nExcept for the $\\lambda$-trajectories, the complete forms of the other two\nseries of Regge trajectories for bottom-charm tetraquarks are lengthy and\ncumbersome. We show that the $\\rho_1$- and $\\rho_2$-trajectories cannot be\nobtained by simply imitating meson Regge trajectories, because mesons have no\nsubstructures. To derive these trajectories, the tetraquarks' structure and\nsubstructure must be taken into consideration. Otherwise, the $\\rho_1$- and\n$\\rho_2$-trajectories would have to rely solely on fitting existing theoretical\nresults or future experimental data. Consequently, the fundamental relationship\nbetween the slopes of the obtained trajectories and string tension would become\nunobvious, and the predictive power of the Regge trajectories would be\ncompromised. Moreover, we show that the lengthy complete forms of the $\\rho_1$-\nand $\\rho_2$-trajectories can be well approximated by simple fitted formulas.\nFor the bottom-charm tetraquarks $(bq)(\\bar{c}\\bar{q}')$ and\n$(cq)(\\bar{b}\\bar{q}')$, $\\rho_1$- and $\\rho_2$-trajectories exhibit a behavior\nof $M{\\sim}x^{1/2}$ $(x=n_{r_1},n_{r_2},l_1,l_2)$, whereas\n$\\lambda$-trajectories exhibit a behavior of $M{\\sim}x^{2/3}$ $(x=N_{r},L)$.\nAll three series of trajectories display concave downward behavior in the\n$(M^2,\\,x)$ plane when the confining potential is linear. This conclusion holds\nirrespective of whether light-quark masses are included, owing to the large\nmasses of the heavy quarks.",

Recently, the DETR-based framework\nhas been widely adopted in HOI detection. In DETR-based HOI models, queries\nwith clear meaning are crucial for accurately detecting HOIs. However, prior\nworks have typically relied on randomly initialized queries, leading to vague\nrepresentations that limit the model's effectiveness. Meanwhile, humans in the\nHOI categories are fixed, while objects and their interactions are variable.\nTherefore, we propose a Dual Query Enhancement Network (DQEN) to enhance object\nand interaction queries.

On the other hand, we\ndesign a novel Interaction Semantic Fusion module to exploit the HOI candidates\nthat are promoted by the CLIP model. Semantic features are extracted to enhance\nthe initialization of interaction queries, thereby improving the model's\nability to understand interactions. Furthermore, we introduce an Auxiliary\nPrediction Unit aimed at improving the representation of interaction features.\nOur proposed method achieves competitive performance on both the HICO-Det and\nthe V-COCO datasets.

    "abstract": "For coprime $p,q\\in\\mathbb{Z}_{\\geq 2}$, the triplet vertex operator algebra\n$W_{p,q}$ is a non-simple extension of the universal Virasoro vertex operator\nalgebra of central charge $c_{p,q}=1-\\frac{6(p-q)^2}{pq}$, and it is a basic\nexample of a vertex operator algebra appearing in logarithmic conformal field\ntheory. Here, we give a new construction of $W_{p,q}$ different from the\noriginal screening operator definition of\nFeigin-Gainutdinov-Semikhatov-Tipunin. Using our earlier work on the tensor\ncategory structure of modules for the Virasoro algebra at central charge\n$c_{p,q}$, we show that the simple modules appearing in the decomposition of\n$W_{p,q}$ as a module for the Virasoro algebra have $PSL_2$-fusion rules and\ngenerate a symmetric tensor category equivalent to $\\mathrm{Rep}\\,PSL_2$. Then\nwe use the theory of commutative algebras in braided tensor categories to\nconstruct $W_{p,q}$ as an appropriate non-simple modification of the canonical\nalgebra in the Deligne tensor product of $\\mathrm{Rep}\\,PSL_2$ with this\nVirasoro subcategory. As a consequence, we show that the automorphism group of\n$W_{p,q}$ is $PSL_2(\\mathbb{C})$. We also define a braided tensor category\n$\\mathcal{O}_{c_{p,q}}^0$ consisting of modules for the Virasoro algebra at\ncentral charge $c_{p,q}$ that induce to untwisted modules of $W_{p,q}$.

QCBP embeds quantum computation within the\nclassical Branch-and-Price (BP) framework to address three bottlenecks in\nclassical BP algorithms: the computational cost of Pricing Subproblems (PSPs),\nbranching efficiency, and the quality of primal heuristics. It uses\nquantum-assisted Column Generation (CG) based on Quantum Adiabatic Algorithms\n(QAA) to sample high-quality maximum-weight independent sets (MWIS), reducing\nthe need to repeatedly solve NP-hard PSPs. The adapted branching strategy\nleverages quantum-generated independent sets to explore fewer nodes, tighten\nlower bounds, and converge faster. A classical primal heuristic rapidly builds\nfeasible solutions from quantum-generated sets, avoiding unnecessary quantum\ncalls or additional Integer Linear Programming (ILP) solves. Compared with our\nprior Hybrid Column Generation (HCG) and Branch-and-Bound through maximal\nIndependent Set (BBQ-mIS), QCBP improves both quantum-resource utilization and\nsolution quality. Extensive experiments show QCBP significantly outperforms HCG\nand BBQ-mIS, reaching optimality on $\\approx 98\\%$ of benchmark instances.\nPreliminary validation on real neutral-atom hardware indicates robustness to\nquantum noise and hardware constraints, supporting practical applicability and\nscalability to larger graph instances.

Vision-language models\n(VLMs) exhibit strong generalization, and text prompts encode identity\nattributes, enabling explicit identification and removal of sensitive\ndirections. However, existing debiasing approaches typically address vision and\ntext modalities independently, leaving residual cross-modal misalignment and\nfairness gaps. To address this challenge, we propose DualFairVL, a multimodal\nprompt-learning framework that jointly debiases and aligns cross-modal\nrepresentations. DualFairVL employs a parallel dual-branch architecture that\nseparates sensitive and target attributes, enabling disentangled yet aligned\nrepresentations across modalities. Approximately orthogonal text anchors are\nconstructed via linear projections, guiding cross-attention mechanisms to\nproduce fused features. A hypernetwork further disentangles attribute-related\ninformation and generates instance-aware visual prompts, which encode\ndual-modal cues for fairness and robustness. Prototype-based regularization is\napplied in the visual branch to enforce separation of sensitive features and\nstrengthen alignment with textual anchors. Extensive experiments on eight\nmedical imaging datasets across four modalities show that DualFairVL achieves\nstate-of-the-art fairness and accuracy under both in- and out-of-distribution\nsettings, outperforming full fine-tuning and parameter-efficient baselines with\nonly 3.6M trainable parameters.

An\nadditional close to resonance harmonic force excites nonlinear oscillations\nabout the fixed point in the rotating frame. When the secondary drive is\nremoved, we measure decay of the in-phase and quadrature components toward this\nfixed point. We show that the decay of the in-phase signal is non-exponential,\neven though the vibration amplitude decays exponentially if both forces are\nswitched off.

However, both often\nlimit exploration on long-horizon tasks. We introduce History-Aggregated\nExploratory Policy Optimization (HAEPO), a history-aware exploratory loss to\ncombat these shortcomings. HAEPO compresses each trajectory into the sum of its\nlogarithmic probabilities (a cumulative logarithmic likelihood), and applies a\nPlackett-Luce softmax across trajectories to obtain normalized weights\nproportional to their returns, thus encouraging broader exploration. We add\nentropy regularization to stabilize the aggressive updates to prevent premature\ncollapse and a soft KL penalty relative to a frozen copy of the previous\n(reference) policy. Empirically, HAEPO converges fast, explores thoroughly,\naligns closely with true rewards, and demonstrates robust learning behavior\nbetter or at par with PPO, GRPO, and DPO across diverse tasks. Thus, HAEPO\nprovides a stable and interpretable framework by explicitly leveraging\nfull-trajectory history while balancing exploration and stability.",

Using the\nIRAC (Issue-Rule-Application-Conclusion) model as an analytical framework, the\nstudy focuses on the most challenging phases of legal adjudication: determining\nthe applicable Rule (R) and performing the Application (A) of that rule to the\nfacts of a case. From a judicial perspective, the analysis deconstructs legal\nreasoning into a series of core requirements, including the ability to select\nthe correct legal framework across jurisdictions, generate sound arguments\nbased on the doctrine of legal sources, distinguish ratio decidendi from obiter\ndictum in case law, resolve ambiguity arising from general clauses like\n\"reasonableness\", manage conflicting legal provisions, and correctly apply the\nburden of proof.

    "abstract": "We describe a Matlab routine that allows us to estimate the jumps in\nfinancial asset prices using the Threshold (or Truncation) method of Mancini\n(2009). The routine is designed for application to five-minute log-returns. The\nunderlying assumption is that asset prices evolve in time following an Ito\nsemimartingale with, possibly stochastic, volatility and jumps. A log-return is\nlikely to contain a jump if its absolute value is larger than a threshold\ndetermined by the maximum increment of the Brownian semimartingale part. The\nlatter is particularly sensitive to the magnitude of the volatility\ncoefficient, and from an empirical point of view, volatility levels typically\ndepend on the time of day (TOD), with volatility being highest at the beginning\nand end of the day, while it is low in the middle. The first routine presented\nallows for an estimation of the TOD effect, and is an implementation of the\nmethod described in Bollerslev and Todorov (2011). Subsequently, the TOD effect\nfor the stock Apple Inc. (AAPL) is visualized. The second routine presented is\nan implementation of the threshold method for estimating jumps in AAPL prices.\nThe procedure recursively estimates daily volatility and jumps. In each round,\nthe threshold depends on the time of the day and is constructed using the\nestimate of the daily volatility multiplied by the daytime TOD factor and by\nthe continuity modulus of the Brownian motion paths. Once the jumps are\ndetected, the daily volatility estimate is updated using only the log-returns\nnot containing jumps. Before application to empirical data, the reliability of\nthe procedure was separately tested on simulated asset prices. The results\nobtained on a record of AAPL stock prices are visualized.",

Here we present an observational analysis of the evolving shape and\nkinematics of a large-scale CME that occurred on May 7, 2021 on the eastern\nlimb of the Sun as seen from 1 au. The eruption was observed continuously,\nconsecutively by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) telescope suite on the\nSolar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), the ground-based COronal Solar Magnetism\nObservatory (COSMO) K-coronagraph (K-Cor) on Mauna Loa, and the C2 and C3\ntelescopes of the Large Angle Solar Coronagraph (LASCO) on the Solar and\nHeliospheric Observatory (SoHO). We apply the updated multi-instument version\nof the recently developed Wavetrack Python suite for automated detection and\ntracking of coronal eruptive features to evaluate and compare the evolving\nshape of the CME front as it propagated from the solar surface out to 20 solar\nradii. Our tool allows tracking features beyond just the leading edge and is an\nimportant step towards semi-automatic manufacturing of training sets for\ntraining data-driven image segmentation models for solar imaging.

The energy-latency-reliability profile resulting from\nthe concatenation of pre-processing operations (specifically, data compression)\nand data transmission is particularly relevant in wireless communication\nservices, whose requirements may change dramatically with the application\ndomain.

Both systems exhibit pronounced dynamic\nheterogeneities, as evidenced by the cage-trapping plateaus in the mean-squared\ndisplacement and the pronounced peaks in the non-Gaussian parameter. In both\ncases, we observe a strong correlation between local structural order and\ndynamic propensity, indicating similar structure-dynamics relationships, albeit\ndriven by distinct microscopic mechanisms.

    "abstract": "Reliable predictions from systems biology models require knowing whether\nparameters can be estimated from available data, and with what certainty.\nIdentifiability analysis reveals whether parameters are learnable in principle\n(structural identifiability) and in practice (practical identifiability). We\nintroduce the core ideas using linear models, highlighting how experimental\ndesign and output sensitivity shape identifiability. In nonlinear models,\nidentifiability can vary with parameter values, motivating global and\nsimulation-based approaches. We summarise computational methods for assessing\nidentifiability noting that weakly identifiable parameters can undermine\npredictions beyond the calibration dataset. Strategies to improve\nidentifiability include measuring different outputs, refining model structure,\nand adding prior knowledge. Far from a technical afterthought, identifiability\ndetermines the limits of inference and prediction. Recognising and addressing\nidentifiability is essential for building models that are not only well-fitted\nto data, but also capable of delivering predictions with robust, quantifiable\nuncertainty.",

Their effect is quantified mainly\nby means of the cosmic-ray ionisation rate $\\zeta_2$.\n  Aims: We aim to obtain a sample of $\\zeta_2$ measurements in 20 low-mass\nstarless cores embedded in different parental clouds, to assess the average\nlevel of ionisation in this kind of sources and to investigate the role of the\nenvironment in this context. The warmest clouds in our sample are Ophiuchus and\nCorona Australis, where star formation activity is higher than in the Taurus\ncloud and the other isolated cores we targeted.\n  Methods: We compute $\\zeta_2$ using an analytical method based on the {column\ndensity} of ortho-$\\rm H_2D^+$, the CO abundance, and the deuteration level of\nHCO$^+$. To estimate these quantities, we analysed new, high-sensitivity\nmolecular line observations obtained with the Atacama Pathfinder EXperiment\n(APEX) single-dish telescope and archival continuum data from Herschel.\n  Results: We report $\\zeta_2$ estimates in 17 cores in our sample and provide\nupper limits on the three remaining sources.

The warmest clouds in our sample are Ophiuchus and Corona Australis,\nwhere star formation activity is higher than in the other clouds we targeted.\nThe higher ionisation rates in these regions support the scenario that low-mass\nprotostars in the vicinity of our targeted cores contribute to the\nre-acceleration of local cosmic rays.",

Existing approaches either rely on prompt\nengineering or fine-tuning with heuristically generated uncertainty estimates,\nboth of which have limited effectiveness and generalizability.

ConfTuner improves calibration across\ndiverse reasoning tasks and generalizes to black-box models such as GPT-4o.

This setup is well suited for implicit choices users\nmake when navigating a content platform, but does not capture other possible\ncomparison queries. Motivated by the fact that users provide more reliable\nfeedback after consuming items, we propose a new bandit model that can be\ndescribed as follows. The algorithm recommends one item per time step; after\nconsuming that item, the user is asked to compare it with another item chosen\nfrom the user's consumption history. Importantly, in our model, this comparison\nitem can be chosen without incurring any additional regret, potentially leading\nto better performance. However, the regret analysis is challenging because of\nthe temporal dependency in the user's history. To overcome this challenge, we\nfirst show that the algorithm can construct informative queries provided the\nhistory is rich, i.e., satisfies a certain diversity condition.

Modern\nmalware detection pipelines combine classifiers with monthly active learning\n(AL) and rejection mechanisms to mitigate the impact of concept drift. In this\nwork, we develop a novel formulation of malware detection as a one-step Markov\nDecision Process and train a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agent,\nsimultaneously optimizing sample classification performance and rejecting\nhigh-risk samples for manual labeling. We evaluated the joint detection and\ndrift mitigation policy learned by the DRL-based Malware Detection (DRMD) agent\nthrough time-aware evaluations on Android malware datasets subject to realistic\ndrift requiring multi-year performance stability. The policies learned under\nthese conditions achieve a higher Area Under Time (AUT) performance compared to\nstandard classification approaches used in the domain, showing improved\nresilience to concept drift.

The source had remained in a persistent soft spectral\nstate since its hard-to-soft transition in 2015 July until a soft-to-hard\ntransition occurred in 2025 May. On 2025 June 23, NinjaSat began monitoring GS\n1826$-$238 in the hard state and continued until the source returned to a\nsteady soft state. During this period, we detected 19 X-ray bursts: 14 during\nthe hard state, 4 in the transitional state, and 1 in the soft state. In the\nhard state, we identified a new clocked bursting epoch, during which the burst\nrecurrence time remained highly stable and unprecedentedly short among the\nclocked bursting phases of GS 1826$-$238, with $t_{\\rm rec} = 1.603 \\pm 0.040$\nhr ($1\\sigma$ error). Furthermore, this recurrence time deviates significantly\nby approximately 37% from the previously established empirical relation $t_{\\rm\nrec} \\propto F_{\\rm bol}^{-1.05}$, where $F_{\\rm bol}$ is the bolometric\npersistent flux. These results suggest that the ignition conditions for X-ray\nbursts differed from those in earlier epochs. We explore possible explanations\nfor this discrepancy and propose a scenario in which a smaller fraction of the\nneutron star surface was involved in fuel accumulation and nuclear burning.\nThis situation leads to a high local accretion rate compared to earlier epochs,\nwhich naturally results in the exceptionally short recurrence time, as well as\nthe observed reductions of approximately 38% in blackbody normalization\n(proportional to the emitting area) and 29% in burst fluence.",

To summarize, we compare shell-type\nStrichartz estimates in different settings (the Euclidean, the periodic, and\nthe waveguide).\n  Numerical verification on $\\mathbb{R}^2\\times\\mathbb{T}$ reveals a uniform\n$L^4$-spacetime bound, while $\\mathbb{R}\\times\\mathbb{T}^2$ exhibits sublinear\ngrowth, quantitatively confirming the theoretical dichotomy between geometries\nwith different dimensional confinement.\n  These findings advance the understanding of dispersive effects in hybrid\ngeometries and provide mathematical foundations for efficient waveguide design\nand signal transmission.\n  Finally, for the Euclidean case, we establish well-posedness theory for\nsupercritical nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation (NLS) with \\textit{strip-type}\nfrequency-restricted initial data, revealing a trade-off between dispersion and\nconfinement, which is of independent mathematical interest. This provides a\ndeterministic analogue to random data theory of NLS.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies have shown that Machine Learning (ML) models can exhibit bias\nin real-world scenarios, posing significant challenges in ethically sensitive\ndomains such as healthcare. Such bias can negatively affect model fairness,\nmodel generalization abilities and further risks amplifying social\ndiscrimination. There is a need to remove biases from trained models. Existing\ndebiasing approaches often necessitate access to original training data and\nneed extensive model retraining; they also typically exhibit trade-offs between\nmodel fairness and discriminative performance. To address these challenges, we\npropose Soft-Mask Weight Fine-Tuning (SWiFT), a debiasing framework that\nefficiently improves fairness while preserving discriminative performance with\nmuch less debiasing costs. Notably, SWiFT requires only a small external\ndataset and only a few epochs of model fine-tuning. The idea behind SWiFT is to\nfirst find the relative, and yet distinct, contributions of model parameters to\nboth bias and predictive performance. Then, a two-step fine-tuning process\nupdates each parameter with different gradient flows defined by its\ncontribution. Extensive experiments with three bias sensitive attributes\n(gender, skin tone, and age) across four dermatological and two chest X-ray\ndatasets demonstrate that SWiFT can consistently reduce model bias while\nachieving competitive or even superior diagnostic accuracy under common\nfairness and accuracy metrics, compared to the state-of-the-art. Specifically,\nwe demonstrate improved model generalization ability as evidenced by superior\nperformance on several out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets.",

Due to the limited spatial resolution of\nSPIRE, it is uncertain whether the far-infrared (FIR) emission originates from\nthe quasar itself, nearby sources, or unrelated sources within the SPIRE beam.\nHigh-resolution observations at wavelengths close to the SPIRE coverage are\nneeded to pinpoint the true source of the FIR emission. In this work we\nunambiguously identify the ALMA Band 7 counterparts of a statistical sample of\n152 FIR-bright SDSS quasars and estimate the multiplicity rates among these\nsystems. Based on the multiplicities, we assess the importance of mergers as\ntriggers for concomitant accretion onto supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and\nextreme star formation. In ~60% of cases, the submm emission originates from a\nsingle counterpart within the SPIRE beam, centred on the optical coordinates of\nthe quasar. The multiplicity rate increases by a factor of ~2.5 between\nredshifts 1 and 2.5. The incidence of multiplicities is consistent among broad\nabsorption line (BAL) quasars and non-BAL quasars. The multiplicities observed\nin a fraction of the sample indicate that, while mergers enhance gas inflow\nefficiency, there must be viable alternatives for driving synchronous SMBH\ngrowth and intense star formation in isolated systems. We report the\nserendipitous detection of two CO(6-5) and three CO(7-6) transitions out of the\neight such transitions expected based on the spectral setup and the redshifts\nof the objects in the sample. Higher transitions are not detected, indicating\nthat the quasars are not exciting sufficiently the gas in their hosts. Finally,\nwe also detect a potential emission of H2O, HCN (10-9) or a combination of both\nin the spectrum of a quasar at redshift 1.67.",

Method:\nWe conducted a mining study of GitHub projects that are linked through GitHub\nActions to SonarQube Cloud projects. Results: Among 321 GitHub projects using\nSonarQube Cloud, 81% of them are correctly connected to SonarQube Cloud\nprojects, while others exhibit misconfigurations or restricted access. Among\n265 accessible SonarQube Cloud projects, 75% use the organization's default\nquality gate, i.e., a set of conditions that deployed source code must meet to\npass automated checks. While 55% of the projects use the built-in quality gate\nprovided by SonarQube Cloud, 45% of them customize their quality gate with\ndifferent conditions. Overall, the most common quality conditions align with\nSonarQube Cloud's \"Clean as You Code\" principle and enforce security,\nmaintainability, reliability, coverage, and a few duplicates on newly added or\nmodified source code.

Experiments on\nMovieLens 1M and Amazon CDs benchmarks demonstrate that STARec achieves\nsubstantial performance gains compared with state-of-the-art baselines, despite\nusing only 0.4% of the full training data.",

    "abstract": "We present a comprehensive theoretical analysis of the General Standard Model\n(GSM), a recently proposed framework that unifies particle physics and\ncosmology within the Gravitational Quantum Field Theory (GQFT). Constructed\nfrom first principles based exclusively on the intrinsic properties of leptons\nand quarks, the GSM reveals an enlarged gauge symmetry structure,\nWS$_{c}$(1,3)$\\times$GS(1)$\\times$Z$_2$, which extends beyond the conventional\nU$_Y$(1)$\\times$SU$_L$(2)$\\times$SU$_C$(3) symmetry of the Standard Model.\nHere, WS$_{c}$(1,3) = SP(1,3)$\\rtimes$W$^{1,3}\\rtimes$SP$_c$(1,1) emerges as\nthe conformal inhomogeneous spin gauge symmetry. Within GQFT, the GSM provides\na consistent unification of the Standard Model of particle physics with\ncosmological models. It incorporates the four known fundamental interactions,\nelectromagnetic, weak, strong, and gravitational, plus the Higgs scalar\ninteraction, and also predicts novel interactions. These include spin gauge,\nchirality boost-spin gauge, chiral conformal-spin gauge, and scaling gauge\nforces, as well as additional scalar interactions. Furthermore, the GSM offers\nprofound insights into the nature of gravity and spacetime and elucidates key\nmysteries of the dark side of the universe, such as the origins of dark matter,\nthe dynamics of dark energy, and the physics of the early inflationary epoch.\nBy establishing a new theoretical bridge between quantum field theory and\ngeneral relativity, the GSM opens novel pathways for addressing long-standing\nchallenges in fundamental physics. It provides a unified description of both\nfundamental interactions and cosmic evolution.",

    "abstract": "An efficient technique of computing on encrypted data allows a client with\nlimited capability to perform complex operations on a remote fault-tolerant\nserver without leaking anything about the input or output. Quantum computing\nprovides information-theoretic security to solve such a problem, and many such\ntechniques have been proposed under the premises of half-blind quantum\ncomputation. However, they are dependent on a fixed non-parametric resource set\nthat comprises some universal combination of $H,S,T,CX, CZ$ or $CCX$ gates. In\nthis study, we show that recursive decryption of the parametric gate,\n$R_z(\\theta)$, is possible exactly when $\\theta=\\pm\\pi/2^m$ for $m\\in\n\\mathbb{Z^{+}}$, and approximately with arbitrary precision $\\epsilon$ for\ngiven $\\theta$.

For $-\\frac{3}{2}< L<0,$ we rigorously justify the limit from the\nLandau-de Gennes flow to a sharp interface system characterized by a two-phase\nflow: The interface evolves via motion by mean curvature; In the isotropic\nregion, $Q=0$; In the nematic region, $Q=s_+(nn-\\frac{1}{3}I)$ with $n\\in\n\\mathbb{S}^2$ and $s_+>0$, where the alignment vector field $n$ satisfies\n$$(2s_+^2\\partial_t n+h)\\times n=0$$ and $h=-\\frac{\\delta E(n,\\nabla n)}{\\delta\nn}$ with $E(n,\\nabla n)$ denoting the Oseen-Frank energy; On the interface, the\nstrong anchoring condition $n=\\nu$ is satisfied. This result rigorously\nverifies a claim made by de Gennes [Mol. Cryst. Liq.

Second, we derive a uniform\nspectral lower bound for the linearized operator around the approximate\nsolution. To achieve this, we introduce a suitable basis decomposition and a\ncoordinate transformation to reduce the problem to spectral analysis of two\nscalar one-dimensional linear operators and some singular product estimates. To\naddress the difficulties arising from anisotropic elasticity and the strong\nanchoring boundary condition, we introduce a div-curl decomposition and, when\nestimating the cross terms, combine these with the anisotropic elastic terms to\nclose the energy estimates.",

We find\nthat, in contrast to flexible chains, for stiff chains the position of the\nactive monomer has minimal influence on both the structural and dynamic\nproperties of the chain. An active head monomer pulls the chain behind it,\nstraightening the backbone -- an effect that can be interpreted as\nactivity-induced stiffening. In contrast, an active tail pushes into the chain,\ncausing crumpling. This leads to faster decorrelation of the polymer backbone\nover time, rendering the active motion less persistent. These effects occur\nregardless of whether hydrodynamic interactions are included or not.\nHydrodynamics is included by the imposition of a local counter-force in the\nsurrounding fluid, as opposed to distributing the former equally to all fluid\nelements.

However, deploying these\nsystems in real-time on resource-constrained platforms introduces significant\nchallenges related to scalability, interoperability, and performance. This\npaper presents a real-time remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) system optimized\nfor low-power devices, designed to extract physiological signals, such as heart\nrate (HR), respiratory rate (RR), and oxygen saturation (SpO2), from facial\nvideo streams. The system is built on the Face2PPG pipeline, which processes\nvideo frames sequentially for rPPG signal extraction and analysis, while\nleveraging a multithreaded architecture to manage video capture, real-time\nprocessing, network communication, and graphical user interface (GUI) updates\nconcurrently. This design ensures continuous, reliable operation at 30 frames\nper second (fps), with adaptive feedback through a collaborative user interface\nto guide optimal signal capture conditions. The network interface includes both\nan HTTP server for continuous video streaming and a RESTful API for on-demand\nvital sign retrieval. To ensure accurate performance despite the limitations of\nlow-power devices, we use a hybrid programming model combining Functional\nReactive Programming (FRP) and the Actor Model, allowing event-driven\nprocessing and efficient task parallelization. The system is evaluated under\nreal-time constraints, demonstrating robustness while minimizing computational\noverhead. Our work addresses key challenges in real-time biosignal monitoring,\noffering practical solutions for optimizing performance in modern healthcare\nand human-computer interaction applications.",

Electromagnetic communication and\nsensing tasks are diverse, current methods lack cross task generalization and\ntransfer efficiency, and the scarcity of large high quality datasets blocks the\ncreation of a truly general multitask learning framework.

We developed a custom measurement system and\nconstructed a longitudinal dataset by collecting physiological signals --\nincluding blood volume pulse, electrodermal activity (EDA), skin temperature,\nand acceleration--along with self-reported emotional states from 24\nparticipants over two three-month periods. Data were collected in naturalistic\nworking environments, allowing analysis of the relationship between\nphysiological features and subjective arousal in everyday contexts.

We address this question by\ntracing the evolutionary histories of haloes in the MultiDark Planck2\nsimulation. By following the 100 most massive halos at $z = 0$ across cosmic\ntime, we find that only 40\\% of them were among the largest 100 halos at $z =\n1$. This suggests that many of today's most massive clusters were not the most\ndominant structures at earlier times, while some of the most massive objects at\nhigh redshift do not remain in the top mass ranks at later epochs. The\nhierarchical nature of structure formation predicts that, on average, massive\nhaloes grow over time, with their abundance in comoving space decreasing\nrapidly at higher redshifts. However, individual clusters exhibit diverse\nevolutionary paths: some undergo early rapid growth, while others experience\nsteady accretion or significant merger-driven mass changes. A key assumption in\nself-similar models of cluster evolution is that the most massive objects\nmaintain their rank in the mass hierarchy across cosmic time. In this work, we\ntest this assumption by constructing a mass-complete sample of haloes within\nthe $(1 h^{-1}{\\rm Gpc})^3$ volume of MultiDark and analysing when clusters\nenter and exit a high-mass-selected sample. Our results demonstrate that\ncluster selections must be carefully constructed, as significant numbers of\nobjects can enter and leave the sample over time.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) with chain-of-thought reasoning have\ndemonstrated remarkable problem-solving capabilities, but controlling their\ncomputational effort remains a significant challenge for practical deployment.\nRecent proprietary systems like OpenAI's gpt-oss series have introduced\ndiscrete operational modes for intuitive reasoning control, but the open-source\ncommunity has largely failed to achieve such capabilities. In this paper, we\nintroduce ThinkDial, the first open-recipe end-to-end framework that\nsuccessfully implements gpt-oss-style controllable reasoning through discrete\noperational modes. Our system enables seamless switching between three distinct\nreasoning regimes: High mode (full reasoning capability), Medium mode (50\npercent token reduction with <10 percent performance degradation), and Low mode\n(75 percent token reduction with <15 percent performance degradation). We\nachieve this through an end-to-end training paradigm that integrates\nbudget-mode control throughout the entire pipeline: budget-mode supervised\nfine-tuning that embeds controllable reasoning capabilities directly into the\nlearning process, and two-phase budget-aware reinforcement learning with\nadaptive reward shaping. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ThinkDial\nachieves target compression-performance trade-offs with clear response length\nreductions while maintaining performance thresholds. The framework also\nexhibits strong generalization capabilities on out-of-distribution tasks.",

    "abstract": "Multiple-choice questions (MCQs) play a crucial role in fostering deep\nthinking and knowledge integration in education. However, previous research has\nprimarily focused on generating MCQs with textual options, but it largely\noverlooks the visual options. Moreover, generating high-quality distractors\nremains a major challenge due to the high cost and limited scalability of\nmanual authoring. To tackle these problems, we propose a Cross-modal Options\nSynthesis (CmOS), a novel framework for generating educational MCQs with visual\noptions. Our framework integrates Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (MCoT) reasoning\nprocess and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to produce semantically\nplausible and visually similar answer and distractors. It also includes a\ndiscrimination module to identify content suitable for visual options.\nExperimental results on test tasks demonstrate the superiority of CmOS in\ncontent discrimination, question generation and visual option generation over\nexisting methods across various subjects and educational levels.",

The NiFe/Ru/NiFe\nSAF reference layer, operating in the spin-flop state, couples with the NiFe\nfree layer through a Cu spacer to achieve a remarkable GMR ratio of 0.568% -\nexhibiting complete independence of magnetic field/current orientation.\nSpin-torque ferromagnetic resonance (ST-FMR) verifies that the ferromagnetic\nresonance linewidth of the free layer can be effectively modulated by dc\ncurrent through the Pt heavy metal layer, while maintaining decoupled dynamics\nfrom the SAF layer. Thermal management via high-thermal-conductivity SiC\nsubstrates and AlN capping layers successfully mitigates\ncurrent-shunting-induced Joule heating. Notably, stable auto-oscillation peaks\nare observed at 0.82 mA bias current, with oscillation frequency tunable by\nexternal magnetic field and potential dual-mode behavior at low fields.

Conversely, moment-based distributionally\nrobust optimization (DRO) effectively employs partial distributional\ninformation but can yield conservative solutions even with ample data. To\nbridge these approaches, we propose a novel method called harmonizing\noptimization (HO), which integrates SAA and DRO by adaptively adjusting the\nweights of data and information based on sample size N. This allows HO to\namplify data effects in large samples while emphasizing information in smaller\nones. More importantly, HO performs well across varying data sizes without\nneeding to classify them as large or small. We provide practical methods for\ndetermining these weights and demonstrate that HO offers finite-sample\nperformance guarantees, proving asymptotic optimality when the weight of\ninformation follows a 1/\\sqrt{N}-rate. In addition, HO can be applied to\nenhance scenario reduction, improving approximation quality and reducing\ncompletion time by retaining critical information from reduced scenarios.\nNumerical results show significant advantages of HO in solution quality\ncompared to Wasserstein-based DRO, and highlight its effectiveness in scenario\nreduction.",

Existing oversight mechanisms are\nreactive, brittle, and embedded within agent architectures, making them\nnon-auditable and hard to generalize across heterogeneous deployments.\n  We introduce Governance-as-a-Service (GaaS): a modular, policy-driven\nenforcement layer that regulates agent outputs at runtime without altering\nmodel internals or requiring agent cooperation. GaaS employs declarative rules\nand a Trust Factor mechanism that scores agents based on compliance and\nseverity-weighted violations.

A publicly available dataset of 75000\nimages was used for training and testing. Model evaluation employed accuracy,\nrecall, precision, F1-score, ROC curves, and confusion matrices. Results\ndemonstrated high classification accuracy with minimal misclassifications,\nconfirming the model effectiveness in distinguishing rice varieties.

In this paper, we demonstrate that\ncoordinated TDMA (Co-TDMA), one of the MAPC techniques, effectively reduces the\nlatency of transmitting time-sensitive traffic. In particular, we focus on\nworst-case latency and jitter, which are key metrics for evaluating the\nperformance of real-time applications. We first introduce a Co-TDMA scheduling\nstrategy. We then investigate how this scheduling strategy impacts latency\nunder varying levels of network congestion and traffic volume characteristics.\nFinally, we validate our findings through system-level simulations. Our\nsimulation results demonstrate that Co-TDMA effectively mitigates jitter and\nworst-case latency for low-latency traffic, with the latter exhibiting an\nimprovement of approximately 24%.",

We\nestablish that the sharp interface limit is a two-phase flow system: (i) The\ninterface evolves by mean curvature flow; (ii) Within the bulk phase regions,\nthe solution follows the harmonic map heat flow into $\\mathbb{S}^{n-1}$; (iii)\nAcross the interface, the $\\mathbb{S}^{n-1}$-valued vectors on the two sides\nsatisfy a mixed boundary condition.\n  Furthermore, we rigorously justify this limit using the matched asymptotic\nexpansion method. First, we employ the idea of ``quasi-minimal connecting\norbits'' developed in Fei, Lin, Wang, and Zhang [Invent. Math. 2023] to\nconstruct approximated solutions up to arbitrary order. Second, we derive a\nuniform spectral lower bound for the linearized operator around the approximate\nsolution, which relies on a novel application of the boundary condition.

    "abstract": "Prior human-object interaction (HOI) detection methods have integrated early\nvision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP, but only as supporting components\nwithin their frameworks. In contrast, recent advances in large, generative VLMs\nsuggest that these models may already possess strong ability to understand\nimages involving HOI. This naturally raises an important question: can\ngeneral-purpose standalone VLMs effectively solve HOI detection, and how do\nthey compare with specialized HOI methods? Answering this requires a benchmark\nthat can accommodate both paradigms. However, existing HOI benchmarks such as\nHICO-DET were developed before the emergence of modern VLMs, and their\nevaluation protocols require exact matches to annotated HOI classes. This is\npoorly aligned with the generative nature of VLMs, which often yield multiple\nvalid interpretations in ambiguous cases. For example, a static image may\ncapture a person mid-motion with a frisbee, which can plausibly be interpreted\nas either \"throwing\" or \"catching\". When only \"catching\" is annotated, the\nother, though equally plausible for the image, is marked incorrect when exact\nmatching is used. As a result, correct predictions might be penalized,\naffecting both VLMs and HOI-specific methods. To avoid penalizing valid\npredictions, we introduce a new benchmark that reformulates HOI detection as a\nmultiple-answer multiple-choice task, where each question includes only\nground-truth positive options and a curated set of negatives that are\nconstructed to reduce ambiguity (e.g., when \"catching\" is annotated, \"throwing\"\nis not selected as a negative to avoid penalizing valid predictions). The\nproposed evaluation protocol is the first of its kind for both VLMs and HOI\nmethods, enabling direct comparison and offering new insight into the current\nstate of progress in HOI understanding.",

Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) addresses this challenge by adapting the\nmodel to test data during inference. While most TTA studies assume that the\ntraining and test data share the same class set (closed-set TTA), real-world\nscenarios often involve open-set data (open-set TTA), which can degrade\nclosed-set accuracy. A recent study showed that identifying open-set data\nduring adaptation and maximizing its entropy is an effective solution. However,\nthe previous method relies on the source model for filtering, resulting in\nsuboptimal filtering accuracy on domain-shifted test data.

To address this problem, we propose Primary-Auxiliary Filtering\n(PAF), which employs an auxiliary filter to validate data filtered by the\nprimary filter. Furthermore, we propose Knowledge-Integrated Prediction (KIP),\nwhich calibrates the outputs of the adapting model, EMA model, and source model\nto integrate their complementary knowledge for OSTTA.

Furthermore, they are susceptible\nto overfitting, often yielding prompt updates that generalize poorly beyond the\nimmediate task context.\n  To address these limitations, we propose Reflection-Enhanced\nMeta-Optimization (REMO), a novel framework that integrates (1) a\nmemory-augmented Reflection Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) module -\nstructured as a \"mistake notebook\" and (2) a Self-Adaptive Optimizer,\nimplemented via an LLM-driven meta-controller that synthesizes epoch-level\nreflective insights to iteratively improve system-level prompting strategies.\nThis architecture enables not only local, fine-grained prompt tuning akin to\nTextGrad, but also the systematic accumulation and reuse of cross-run\noptimization knowledge, thereby supporting continual improvement over time.\n  We instantiate the REMO framework using Qwen3-32B in standard inference mode\n- without explicit chain-of-thought prompting - and evaluate its efficacy on\nthe GSM8K benchmark for mathematical reasoning.

    "abstract": "Long-context question answering over narrative tasks is challenging because\ncorrect answers often hinge on reconstructing a coherent timeline of events\nwhile preserving contextual flow in a limited context window.\nRetrieval-augmented generation (RAG) indexing methods aim to address this\nchallenge by selectively retrieving only necessary document segments. However,\nnarrative texts possess unique characteristics that limit the effectiveness of\nthese existing approaches. Specifically, understanding narrative texts requires\nmore than isolated segments, as the broader context and sequential\nrelationships between segments are crucial for comprehension. To address these\nlimitations, we propose ChronoRAG, a novel RAG framework specialized for\nnarrative texts. This approach focuses on two essential aspects: refining\ndispersed document information into coherent and structured passages, and\npreserving narrative flow by explicitly capturing and maintaining the temporal\norder among retrieved passages. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of\nChronoRAG through experiments on the NarrativeQA dataset, showing substantial\nimprovements in tasks requiring both factual identification and comprehension\nof complex sequential relationships, underscoring that reasoning over temporal\norder is crucial in resolving narrative QA.",

Most existing model reduction methods are based on variable reduction,\nwhich predicts a solution value for a subset of variables. From a dual\nperspective, constraint reduction that transforms a subset of inequality\nconstraints into equalities can also reduce the complexity of MILP, but has\nbeen largely ignored. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel constraint-based\nmodel reduction approach for the MILP. Constraint-based MILP reduction has two\nchallenges: 1) which inequality constraints are critical such that reducing\nthem can accelerate MILP solving while preserving feasibility, and 2) how to\npredict these critical constraints efficiently. To identify critical\nconstraints, we first label these tight-constraints at the optimal solution as\npotential critical constraints and design a heuristic rule to select a subset\nof critical tight-constraints. To learn the critical tight-constraints, we\npropose a multi-modal representation technique that leverages information from\nboth instance-level and abstract-level MILP formulations.

    "abstract": "Robust audio-visual speech recognition (AVSR) in noisy environments remains\nchallenging, as existing systems struggle to estimate audio reliability and\ndynamically adjust modality reliance. We propose router-gated cross-modal\nfeature fusion, a novel AVSR framework that adaptively reweights audio and\nvisual features based on token-level acoustic corruption scores. Using an\naudio-visual feature fusion-based router, our method down-weights unreliable\naudio tokens and reinforces visual cues through gated cross-attention in each\ndecoder layer. This enables the model to pivot toward the visual modality when\naudio quality deteriorates. Experiments on LRS3 demonstrate that our approach\nachieves an 16.51-42.67% relative reduction in word error rate compared to\nAV-HuBERT. Ablation studies confirm that both the router and gating mechanism\ncontribute to improved robustness under real-world acoustic noise.",

    "abstract": "The key idea behind PID Passivity-based Control (PID-PBC) is to leverage the\npassivity property of PIDs (for all positive gains) and wrap the PID controller\naround a passive output to ensure global stability in closed-loop. However, the\npractical applicability of PID-PBC is stymied by two key facts: (i) the vast\nmajority of practical implementations of PIDs is carried-out in discrete time\n-- discretizing the continuous time dynamical system of the PID; (ii) the\nwell-known problem that passivity is not preserved upon discretization, even\nwith small sampling times. Therefore, two aspects of the PID-PBC must be\nrevisited for its safe practical application. First, we propose a\ndiscretization of the PID that ensures its passivity. Second, since the output\nthat is identified as passive for the continuous time system is not necessarily\npassive for its discrete time version, we construct a new output that ensures\nthe passivity property for the discretization of the system. In this paper, we\nprovide a constructive answer to both issues for the case of power converter\nmodels. Instrumental to achieve this objective is the use of the implicit\nmidpoint discretization method -- which is a symplectic integration technique\nthat preserves system invariants. Since the reference value for the output to\nbe regulated in power converters is non-zero, we are henceforth interested in\nthe property of passivity of the incremental model -- currently known as\nshifted passivity. Therefore, we demonstrate that the resulting discrete-time\nPID-PBC defines a passive map for the incremental model and establish shifted\npassivity for the discretized power converter model. Combining these\nproperties, we prove global stability for the feedback interconnection of the\npower converter with the discretized PID-PBC. The paper also presents\nsimulations and experiments that demonstrate the performance of the proposed\ndiscretization.",

After the symmetry breaking as $Z_4$ to $Z_2$\nvia the singlet scalar vacuum expectation value (VEV), the lightest Majorana\nfermion works as a viable thermal freeze-out dark matter (DM) candidate, and\nthe mass terms for active neutrinos are generated as a finite quantum\ncorrection at the 1-loop level. A key point of realising our Scotogenic\nstructure is to introduce two types of Majorana fermions (heavy right-handed\nneutrinos) and inert Higgs doublets with opposite $Z_4$ parities. Since a large\nVEV for the singlet scalar is not so harmful in an appropriate realisation of\nthe Higgs mechanism for the SM gauge symmetry, we can naturally realise a\nTeV-scale fermionic DM candidate, where constraints via direct detection\nexperiments are less than those for sub-TeV DM. Our scenario involves the\nHiggs-portal DM interactions, which help the realisation of the correct DM\nrelic abundance. Relying on the structure of the model, it is possible to find\na natural partner for coannihilation. Our scenario can be investigated via the\nmeasurement of the Higgs trilinear self-coupling at the Large Hadron Collider.\nThe simplest way to evade the domain-wall problem by adding a tiny soft $Z_2$\nbreaking term works, keeping a sufficient longevity of the decaying DM\nlifetime.",

Current unsupervised domain\nadaptation (UDA) methods predominantly rely on fine-tuning feature extractors -\nan approach limited by inefficiency, reduced interpretability, and poor\nscalability to modern architectures.\n  Our analysis reveals that models pretrained on large-scale data exhibit\ndomain-invariant geometric patterns in their feature space, characterized by\nintra-class clustering and inter-class separation, thereby preserving\ntransferable discriminative structures. These findings indicate that domain\nshifts primarily manifest as boundary misalignment rather than feature\ndegradation.\n  Unlike fine-tuning entire pre-trained models - which risks introducing\nunpredictable feature distortions - we propose the Feature-space Planes\nSearcher (FPS): a novel domain adaptation framework that optimizes decision\nboundaries by leveraging these geometric patterns while keeping the feature\nencoder frozen. This streamlined approach enables interpretative analysis of\nadaptation while substantially reducing memory and computational costs through\noffline feature extraction, permitting full-dataset optimization in a single\ncomputation cycle.\n  Evaluations on public benchmarks demonstrate that FPS achieves competitive or\nsuperior performance to state-of-the-art methods.

    "abstract": "The Kagome metal Potassium Tri-vanadium Pent-antimonide can support the\nquantum anomalous Hall effect theoretically. This is justified by flat bands\nand Dirac points susceptible to gap opening by spin-orbit coupling or magnetic\nordering. The theoretical investigation of this quantum effect is possible\nexploring strategies like magnetic proximity, and strain or electric gating\ntuning. Our goal here is to explore the possibility of quantum anomalous Hall\neffect with a system Hamiltonian involving nearest-neighbour and complex next\nnearest-neighbour hopping, Rashba spin-orbit coupling, exchange field due to\nmagnetic proximity, and charge density wave. Our preliminary analysis with\nthese ingredients reveals that the system hosts multiple bands whose Chern\nnumbers values suggest weak topological characteristics-not yet quantized, but\nshowing signs of nontrivial Berry curvature accumulation. Upon introducing\nmomentum-space winding, mimicking an orbital magnetic flux, through the\nmomentum-dependence of the phase of the complex hopping, we find that two bands\nin the multiple band system carry opposite Chern numbers, indicating the\nemergence of chiral edge states and a quantized anomalous Hall effect. The rest\nremain trivial, but the system as a whole is no longer topologically inert.",

We\nattribute this to two limitations: (1) insufficient alignment of medical\nconcepts, leading to divergent reasoning patterns, and (2) hidden biases in\ntraining data that prioritize syntactic shortcuts over semantic understanding.\nTo address these challenges, we construct RoMed, a dataset built upon original\nVQA datasets containing 144k questions with variations spanning word-level,\nsentence-level, and semantic-level perturbations. When evaluating\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) models like LLaVA-Med on RoMed, we observe alarming\nperformance drops (e.g., a 40\\% decline in Recall) compared to original VQA\nbenchmarks, exposing critical robustness gaps.

To address this, we propose a novel framework inspired by the\npedagogical principle of \"tailored teaching with balanced difficulty\". We\nreframe prompt selection as a prompt curriculum design problem: constructing a\nwell ordered set of training examples that align with the model's current\ncapabilities.

By jointly analyzing these\nsignals, we develop a difficulty-balanced sampling strategy that ensures the\nselected prompt examples are diverse across both dimensions. Extensive\nexperiments conducted on five challenging benchmarks and multiple popular\nMultimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate that our method yields\nsubstantial and consistent improvements and greatly reduces performance\ndiscrepancies caused by random sampling, providing a principled and robust\napproach for enhancing multimodal reasoning.",

Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, now standard in\nstate-of-the-art systems, introduce a new sparsity dimension that current\ndense-model frontiers overlook. We investigate how MoE sparsity influences two\ndistinct capability regimes: memorization and reasoning. We train families of\nMoE Transformers that systematically vary total parameters, active parameters,\nand top-$k$ routing while holding the compute budget fixed. For every model we\nrecord pre-training loss, downstream task loss, and task accuracy, allowing us\nto separate the train-test generalization gap from the loss-accuracy gap.\nMemorization benchmarks improve monotonically with total parameters, mirroring\ntraining loss. By contrast, reasoning performance saturates and can even\nregress despite continued gains in both total parameters and training loss.\nAltering top-$k$ alone has little effect when active parameters are constant,\nand classic hyperparameters such as learning rate and initialization modulate\nthe generalization gap in the same direction as sparsity.

Agents are no longer expected to simply call tools to deliver a\nresult; rather, they must iteratively refine their understanding of user needs\nthrough communication while simultaneously invoking tools to resolve user\nqueries. Existing reinforcement learning (RL) approaches for tool use lack the\nintegration of genuinely dynamic users during the RL training process.

We resolve this by introducing a\nnovel, four-part coupled process built upon the Poisson Hierarchical Indian\nBuffet Process (PHIBP), a framework we recently developed for modeling\nmicrobiome species sampling across multiple ($J \\ge 1$) groups. This provides a\ntractable generalization of the duality to processes driven by arbitrary\nsubordinators, yielding explicit laws for both single-group and the previously\nuncharacterised multi-group structured partitions.\n  The static, fixed-time partitions are revealed to be a single projection of\nan inherently dynamic, four-component coupled system. This new construction\nsimultaneously defines: (i) the fine-grained partition, (ii) its coagulation\noperator, (iii) a forward-in-time system of coupled, time-homogeneous\nfragmentation processes in the sense of Jean Bertoin (2006), and (iv) a dual,\nbackward-in-time structured coalescent. All four components are governed by the\nsame underlying compositional structure, which yields their exact compound\nPoisson representations and, for the coalescent, drives simultaneous,\nacross-group merger events.\n  The chief result is a general coagulation-fragmentation duality that\ngeneralizes Pitman's duality in two fundamental directions. First, it holds for\narbitrary driving subordinators, defining a vast new family of single-group\ndualities. Second, it operates in the previously uncharacterised multi-group\n($J$-group) setting.

    "abstract": "Recent learning-based underwater image enhancement (UIE) methods have\nadvanced by incorporating physical priors into deep neural networks,\nparticularly using the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) prior to reduce\nwavelength-dependent attenuation. However, spatial domain SNR priors have two\nlimitations: (i) they cannot effectively separate cross-channel interference,\nand (ii) they provide limited help in amplifying informative structures while\nsuppressing noise. To overcome these, we propose using the SNR prior in the\nfrequency domain, decomposing features into amplitude and phase spectra for\nbetter channel modulation. We introduce the Fourier Attention SNR-prior\nTransformer (FAST), combining spectral interactions with SNR cues to highlight\nkey spectral components. Additionally, the Frequency Adaptive Transformer (FAT)\nbottleneck merges low- and high-frequency branches using a gated attention\nmechanism to enhance perceptual quality. Embedded in a unified U-shaped\narchitecture, these modules integrate a conventional RGB stream with an\nSNR-guided branch, forming SFormer. Trained on 4,800 paired images from UIEB,\nEUVP, and LSUI, SFormer surpasses recent methods with a 3.1 dB gain in PSNR and\n0.08 in SSIM, successfully restoring colors, textures, and contrast in\nunderwater scenes.",

    "abstract": "As FMs drive progress toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI),\nfine-tuning them under privacy and resource constraints has become increasingly\ncritical particularly when highquality training data resides on distributed\nedge devices. Federated Learning (FL) offers a compelling solution through\nFederated Fine-Tuning (FFT), which enables collaborative model adaptation\nwithout sharing raw data. Recent approaches incorporate Parameter-Efficient\nFine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques such as Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to reduce\ncomputational overhead. However, LoRA-based FFT faces two major limitations in\nheterogeneous FL environments: structural incompatibility across clients with\nvarying LoRA configurations and limited adaptability to non-IID data\ndistributions, which hinders convergence and generalization. To address these\nchallenges, we propose FFT MoE, a novel FFT framework that replaces LoRA with\nsparse Mixture of Experts (MoE) adapters. Each client trains a lightweight\ngating network to selectively activate a personalized subset of experts,\nenabling fine-grained adaptation to local resource budgets while preserving\naggregation compatibility. To further combat the expert load imbalance caused\nby device and data heterogeneity, we introduce a heterogeneity-aware auxiliary\nloss that dynamically regularizes the routing distribution to ensure expert\ndiversity and balanced utilization. Extensive experiments spanning both IID and\nnon-IID conditions demonstrate that FFT MoE consistently outperforms state of\nthe art FFT baselines in generalization performance and training efficiency.",

Emotional understanding is thus essential\nfor improving human-machine interaction. Most empathetic speech LLMs rely on\nmassive datasets, demanding high computational cost. A key challenge is to\nbuild models that generate empathetic responses with limited data and without\nlarge-scale training.

We propose a novel multimodal framework for financial risk\nassessment that integrates textual sentiment with paralinguistic cues derived\nfrom executive vocal tract dynamics in earnings calls. Central to this\nframework is the Physics-Informed Acoustic Model (PIAM), which applies\nnonlinear acoustics to robustly extract emotional signatures from raw\nteleconference sound subject to distortions such as signal clipping. Both\nacoustic and textual emotional states are projected onto an interpretable\nthree-dimensional Affective State Label (ASL) space-Tension, Stability, and\nArousal. Using a dataset of 1,795 earnings calls (approximately 1,800 hours),\nwe construct features capturing dynamic shifts in executive affect between\nscripted presentation and spontaneous Q&A exchanges. Our key finding reveals a\npronounced divergence in predictive capacity: while multimodal features do not\nforecast directional stock returns, they explain up to 43.8% of the\nout-of-sample variance in 30-day realized volatility. Importantly, volatility\npredictions are strongly driven by emotional dynamics during executive\ntransitions from scripted to spontaneous speech, particularly reduced textual\nstability and heightened acoustic instability from CFOs, and significant\narousal variability from CEOs. An ablation study confirms that our multimodal\napproach substantially outperforms a financials-only baseline, underscoring the\ncomplementary contributions of acoustic and textual modalities.

However, many studies showed that they are vulnerable to\nknowledge corruption attacks, where an attacker can inject adversarial texts\ninto the knowledge database of a RAG system to induce the LLM to generate\nattacker-desired outputs. Existing studies mainly focus on attacking specific\nqueries or queries with similar topics (or keywords). In this work, we propose\nUniC-RAG, a universal knowledge corruption attack against RAG systems. Unlike\nprior work, UniC-RAG jointly optimizes a small number of adversarial texts that\ncan simultaneously attack a large number of user queries with diverse topics\nand domains, enabling an attacker to achieve various malicious objectives, such\nas directing users to malicious websites, triggering harmful command execution,\nor launching denial-of-service attacks.

Our extensive evaluations demonstrate that UniC-RAG is highly\neffective and significantly outperforms baselines. For instance, UniC-RAG could\nachieve over 90% attack success rate by injecting 100 adversarial texts into a\nknowledge database with millions of texts to simultaneously attack a large set\nof user queries (e.g., 2,000). Additionally, we evaluate existing defenses and\nshow that they are insufficient to defend against UniC-RAG, highlighting the\nneed for new defense mechanisms in RAG systems.",

To this end, we introduce PRISM (Principled Reasoning for Integrated\nSafety in Multimodality), a system2-like framework that aligns VLMs by\nembedding a structured, safety-aware reasoning process. Our framework consists\nof two key components: PRISM-CoT, a dataset that teaches safety-aware\nchain-of-thought reasoning, and PRISM-DPO, generated via Monte Carlo Tree\nSearch (MCTS) to further refine this reasoning through Direct Preference\nOptimization to help obtain a delicate safety boundary. Comprehensive\nevaluations demonstrate PRISM's effectiveness, achieving remarkably low attack\nsuccess rates including 0.15% on JailbreakV-28K for Qwen2-VL and 90%\nimprovement over the previous best method on VLBreak for LLaVA-1.5. PRISM also\nexhibits strong robustness against adaptive attacks, significantly increasing\ncomputational costs for adversaries, and generalizes effectively to\nout-of-distribution challenges, reducing attack success rates to just 8.70% on\nthe challenging multi-image MIS benchmark. Remarkably, this robust defense is\nachieved while preserving, and in some cases enhancing, model utility.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit deficiencies with complex\nreasoning tasks, such as maths, which we attribute to the discrepancy between\nhuman reasoning patterns and those presented in the LLMs' training data. When\ndealing with complex problems, humans tend to think carefully before expressing\nsolutions. However, they often do not articulate their inner thoughts,\nincluding their intentions and chosen methodologies. Consequently, critical\ninsights essential for bridging reasoning steps may be absent in training data\ncollected from human sources. To bridge this gap, we proposes inserting\n\\emph{insight}s between consecutive reasoning steps, which review the status\nand initiate the next reasoning steps.

To address this\nproblem, we propose Reinforcement Learning with Mixed Rewards (RLMR), utilizing\na dynamically mixed reward system from a writing reward model evaluating\nsubjective writing quality and a constraint verification model assessing\nobjective constraint following. The constraint following reward weight is\nadjusted dynamically according to the writing quality within sampled groups,\nensuring that samples violating constraints get negative advantage in GRPO and\nthus penalized during training, which is the key innovation of this proposed\nmethod.

Twisted MoTe$_2$ bilayer (tMoTe$_2$) is a newly discovered zero-field\nfractional Chern insulator (FCI), exhibiting the fractionally quantized\nanomalous Hall (FQAH) effect. Since the chirality of the edge states and sign\nof the Chern number are determined by the underlying ferromagnetic\npolarization, manipulation of ferromagnetism would realize control of the\nCI/FCI states. Here, we demonstrate control and switching of ferromagnetic\npolarization, and thus the CI and FCI states by circularly polarized optical\npumping in tMoTe$_2$. At low optical excitation power, we achieve on-demand\npreparation of ferromagnetic polarization by optical training, i.e.,\nelectrically tuning the system from non-ferromagnetic to desirable\nferromagnetic states accompanied with helicity-selective optical pumping. With\nincreased excitation power, we further realize direct optical switching of\nferromagnetic polarization at a temperature far below the Curie temperature.\nBoth optical training and direct switching of ferromagnetism are most effective\nnear CI/FCI states, which we attribute to a gap enhanced valley polarization of\nphoto-injected holes. We show that the magnetization can be dynamically\nswitched by modulating the helicity of optical excitation.

However, the current methods for\nranking and recommending apps in these stores mostly rely on static metrics\nlike user activity and favorites, which makes it hard for users to efficiently\nfind high-quality apps. To address these challenges, we propose LaQual, an\nautomated framework for evaluating the quality of LLM apps. LaQual consists of\nthree main stages: first, it labels and classifies LLM apps in a hierarchical\nway to accurately match them to different scenarios; second, it uses static\nindicators, such as time-weighted user engagement and functional capability\nmetrics, to filter out low-quality apps; and third, it conducts a dynamic,\nscenario-adaptive evaluation, where the LLM itself generates scenario-specific\nevaluation metrics, scoring rules, and tasks for a thorough quality assessment.\nExperiments on a popular LLM app store show that LaQual is effective. Its\nautomated scores are highly consistent with human judgments (with Spearman's\nrho of 0.62 and p=0.006 in legal consulting, and rho of 0.60 and p=0.009 in\ntravel planning).

    "abstract": "Urban forecasting models often face a severe data imbalance problem: only a\nfew cities have dense, long-span records, while many others expose short or\nincomplete histories. Direct transfer from data-rich to data-scarce cities is\nunreliable because only a limited subset of source patterns truly benefits the\ntarget domain, whereas indiscriminate transfer risks introducing noise and\nnegative transfer. We present STRATA-TS (Selective TRAnsfer via TArget-aware\nretrieval for Time Series), a framework that combines domain-adapted retrieval\nwith reasoning-capable large models to improve forecasting in scarce data\nregimes. STRATA-TS employs a patch-based temporal encoder to identify source\nsubsequences that are semantically and dynamically aligned with the target\nquery. These retrieved exemplars are then injected into a retrieval-guided\nreasoning stage, where an LLM performs structured inference over target inputs\nand retrieved support. To enable efficient deployment, we distill the reasoning\nprocess into a compact open model via supervised fine-tuning. Extensive\nexperiments on three parking availability datasets across Singapore,\nNottingham, and Glasgow demonstrate that STRATA-TS consistently outperforms\nstrong forecasting and transfer baselines, while providing interpretable\nknowledge transfer pathways.",

CSER enhances completeness\nand accuracy in capturing both motion and details through unit-to-set matching\nand bidirectional validation. Based on the HMD-270K supervised fine-tuning and\nGRPO post-training with CSER, we developed OwlCap, a powerful video captioning\nmulti-modal large language model (MLLM) with motion-detail balance.\nExperimental results demonstrate that OwlCap achieves significant improvements\ncompared to baseline models on two benchmarks: the detail-focused VDC (+4.2\nAcc) and the motion-focused DREAM-1K (+4.6 F1).

However, when addressing the side effects\nof objects, e.g., their shadows and reflections, existing works struggle to\neliminate these effects for the scarcity of paired video data as supervision.\nThis paper presents ROSE, termed Remove Objects with Side Effects, a framework\nthat systematically studies the object's effects on environment, which can be\ncategorized into five common cases: shadows, reflections, light, translucency\nand mirror. Given the challenges of curating paired videos exhibiting the\naforementioned effects, we leverage a 3D rendering engine for synthetic data\ngeneration. We carefully construct a fully-automatic pipeline for data\npreparation, which simulates a large-scale paired dataset with diverse scenes,\nobjects, shooting angles, and camera trajectories. ROSE is implemented as an\nvideo inpainting model built on diffusion transformer. To localize all\nobject-correlated areas, the entire video is fed into the model for\nreference-based erasing. Moreover, additional supervision is introduced to\nexplicitly predict the areas affected by side effects, which can be revealed\nthrough the differential mask between the paired videos. To fully investigate\nthe model performance on various side effect removal, we presents a new\nbenchmark, dubbed ROSE-Bench, incorporating both common scenarios and the five\nspecial side effects for comprehensive evaluation. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that ROSE achieves superior performance compared to existing video\nobject erasing models and generalizes well to real-world video scenarios.

Existing methods\nprimarily focus on extracting different decoupled features of modalities and\nperforming fusion operations such as concatenation, attention, and MoE-based\n(Mixture-of-Experts) fusion. However, these methods still face two key\nchallenges: i) Fixed fusion schemes (concatenation and attention) can lead to\nmodel over-reliance on predefined feature combinations, limiting the dynamic\nfusion of decoupled features; ii) in MoE-based fusion methods, each expert\nnetwork handles separate decoupled features, which limits information\ninteraction among the decoupled features. To address these challenges, we\npropose a novel Decoupling-Reorganization-Fusion framework (DeReF), which\ndevises a random feature reorganization strategy between modalities decoupling\nand dynamic MoE fusion modules.Its advantages are: i) it increases the\ndiversity of feature combinations and granularity, enhancing the generalization\nability of the subsequent expert networks; ii) it overcomes the problem of\ninformation closure and helps expert networks better capture information among\ndecoupled features. Additionally, we incorporate a regional cross-attention\nnetwork within the modality decoupling module to improve the representation\nquality of decoupled features.

By contrast, the faster coherence decay in the other configuration\nsuppresses such violations, driving it closer to classical behavior.

It is a fundamental function in vector database\nmanagement systems and intelligent systems with embedding abilities. Dedicated\nindices for RFANNS accelerate query speed with an acceptable accuracy loss on\nnearest neighbors. However, they are still facing the challenges to be\nconstructed incrementally and generalized to achieve superior query performance\nfor arbitrary range filters. In this paper, we introduce a window graph-based\nRFANNS index. For incremental construction, we propose an insertion algorithm\nto add new vector-attribute pairs into hierarchical window graphs with varying\nwindow size. To handle arbitrary range filters, we optimize relevant window\nsearch for attribute filter checks and vector distance computations by range\nselectivity. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that for index\nconstruction, the indexing time is on par with the most building-efficient\nindex, and 4.9x faster than the most query-efficient index with 0.4-0.5x\nsmaller size; For RFANNS query, it is 4x faster than the most efficient\nincremental index, and matches the performance of the best statically-built\nindex.",

The recently proposed $(\\alpha,\n\\beta)$-dense subgraph model has demonstrated superior capability in capturing\nthe intrinsic density structure of bipartite graphs compared to existing\nalternatives. However, despite its modeling advantages, the $(\\alpha,\n\\beta)$-dense subgraph model lacks efficient support for query processing and\ndynamic updates, limiting its practical utility in large-scale applications. To\naddress these limitations, we propose BD-Index, a novel index that answers\n$(\\alpha, \\beta)$-dense subgraph queries in optimal time while using only\nlinear space $O(|E|)$, making it well-suited for real-world applications\nrequiring both fast query processing and low memory consumption. We further\ndevelop two complementary maintenance strategies for dynamic bipartite graphs\nto support efficient updates to the BD-Index. The space-efficient strategy\nupdates the index in time complexity of $O(p \\cdot |E|^{1.5})$ per edge\ninsertion or deletion, while maintaining a low space cost of $O(|E|)$ (the same\nas the index itself), where $p$ is typically a small constant in real-world\ngraphs. In contrast, the time-efficient strategy significantly reduces the\nupdate time to $O(p \\cdot |E|)$ per edge update by maintaining auxiliary\norientation structures, at the cost of increased memory usage up to $O(p \\cdot\n|E|)$. These two strategies provide flexible trade-offs between maintenance\nefficiency and memory usage, enabling BD-Index to adapt to diverse application\nrequirements. Extensive experiments on 10 large-scale real-world datasets\ndemonstrate high efficiency and scalability of our proposed solutions.",

We introduce ModAn-MulSupCon, a modality- and\nanatomy-aware multi-label supervised contrastive pretraining method that\nleverages such metadata to learn transferable representations.\n  Method: Each image's modality and anatomy are encoded as a multi-hot vector.\nA ResNet-18 encoder is pretrained on a mini subset of RadImageNet (miniRIN,\n16,222 images) with a Jaccard-weighted multi-label supervised contrastive loss,\nand then evaluated by fine-tuning and linear probing on three binary\nclassification tasks--ACL tear (knee MRI), lesion malignancy (breast\nultrasound), and nodule malignancy (thyroid ultrasound).\n  Result: With fine-tuning, ModAn-MulSupCon achieved the best AUC on MRNet-ACL\n(0.964) and Thyroid (0.763), surpassing all baselines ($p<0.05$), and ranked\nsecond on Breast (0.926) behind SimCLR (0.940; not significant).

    "abstract": "Translating electronic health record (EHR) narratives from English to Spanish\nis a clinically important yet challenging task due to the lack of a\nparallel-aligned corpus and the abundant unknown words contained. To address\nsuch challenges, we propose \\textbf{NOOV} (for No OOV), a new neural machine\ntranslation (NMT) system that requires little in-domain parallel-aligned corpus\nfor training. NOOV integrates a bilingual lexicon automatically learned from\nparallel-aligned corpora and a phrase look-up table extracted from a large\nbiomedical knowledge resource, to alleviate both the unknown word problem and\nthe word-repeat challenge in NMT, enhancing better phrase generation of NMT\nsystems. Evaluation shows that NOOV is able to generate better translation of\nEHR with improvement in both accuracy and fluency.",

    "abstract": "Navigation signs and maps, such as floor plans and street maps, are widely\navailable and serve as ubiquitous aids for way-finding in human environments.\nYet, they are rarely used by robot systems. This paper presents SignLoc, a\nglobal localization method that leverages navigation signs to localize the\nrobot on publicly available maps -- specifically floor plans and OpenStreetMap\n(OSM) graphs -- without prior sensor-based mapping. SignLoc first extracts a\nnavigation graph from the input map. It then employs a probabilistic\nobservation model to match directional and locational cues from the detected\nsigns to the graph, enabling robust topo-semantic localization within a Monte\nCarlo framework. We evaluated SignLoc in diverse large-scale environments: part\nof a university campus, a shopping mall, and a hospital complex. Experimental\nresults show that SignLoc reliably localizes the robot after observing only one\nto two signs.",

    "abstract": "Many mechanical structures, both engineered and biological, combine heavy\nrigid elements such as bones and beams with lightweight flexible ones such as\ncables and membranes. These are referred to as tensegrities, reflecting that\ncables can only support extensile tension. We model such systems via\nsimulations of depleted triangular lattices in which we minimize the energies\nof tensegrities subject to strained boundary conditions. When there are equal\nnumbers of cables and struts (which support only compressive tension), a cable\nand a strut together each contribute as much toward rigidity as a rod, with the\ntwo contributions being equal in the case of shear strain. Due to the highly\nnonaffine deformations at the rigidity transitions, the contribution of a cable\n(strut) can be significant even under global compression (dilation) despite a\ncable's inability to resist local compression. Further, we find that when\nneighboring elements tend to point away from one another, as is common in real\nsystems, cables interact significantly more strongly with other cables than do\ncables with struts in supporting stress. These phenomena shed new light on a\nvariety of realistic, disordered systems at the threshold of mechanical\nstability.",

    "abstract": "Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (FTRL) policies have achieved\nBest-of-Both-Worlds (BOBW) results in various settings through hybrid\nregularizers, whereas analogous results for Follow-the-Perturbed-Leader (FTPL)\nremain limited due to inherent analytical challenges. To advance the analytical\nfoundations of FTPL, we revisit classical FTRL-FTPL duality for unbounded\nperturbations and establish BOBW results for FTPL under a broad family of\nasymmetric unbounded Fr\\'echet-type perturbations, including hybrid\nperturbations combining Gumbel-type and Fr\\'echet-type tails. These results not\nonly extend the BOBW results of FTPL but also offer new insights into designing\nalternative FTPL policies competitive with hybrid regularization approaches.\nMotivated by earlier observations in two-armed bandits, we further investigate\nthe connection between the $1/2$-Tsallis entropy and a Fr\\'echet-type\nperturbation. Our numerical observations suggest that it corresponds to a\nsymmetric Fr\\'echet-type perturbation, and based on this, we establish the\nfirst BOBW guarantee for symmetric unbounded perturbations in the two-armed\nsetting. In contrast, in general multi-armed bandits, we find an instance in\nwhich symmetric Fr\\'echet-type perturbations violate the key condition for\nstandard BOBW analysis, which is a problem not observed with asymmetric or\nnonnegative Fr\\'echet-type perturbations. Although this example does not rule\nout alternative analyses achieving BOBW results, it suggests the limitations of\ndirectly applying the relationship observed in two-armed cases to the general\ncase and thus emphasizes the need for further investigation to fully understand\nthe behavior of FTPL in broader settings.",

We\naddress this challenge with a persona-based approach that leverages\nindividual-level behavioral data from behavioral economics to adjust model\nbiases. Applying this method to the ultimatum game--a standard but difficult\nbenchmark for LLMs--we observe improved alignment between simulated and\nempirical behavior, particularly on the responder side. While further\nrefinement of trait representations is needed, our results demonstrate the\npromise of persona-conditioned LLMs for simulating human-like decision patterns\nat scale.",

    "abstract": "What do large language models actually model? Do they tell us something about\nhuman capacities, or are they models of the corpus we've trained them on? I\ngive a non-deflationary defence of the latter position. Cognitive science tells\nus that linguistic capabilities in humans rely supralinear formats for\ncomputation. The transformer architecture, by contrast, supports at best a\nlinear formats for processing. This argument will rely primarily on certain\ninvariants of the computational architecture of transformers. I then suggest a\npositive story about what transformers are doing, focusing on Liu et al.\n(2022)'s intriguing speculations about shortcut automata. I conclude with why I\ndon't think this is a terribly deflationary story. Language is not (just) a\nmeans for expressing inner state but also a kind of 'discourse machine' that\nlets us make new language given appropriate context. We have learned to use\nthis technology in one way; LLMs have also learned to use it too, but via very\ndifferent means.",

The model introduces a scene layout\nrepresentation combining a top-down semantic map and attributes for each\nobject. Unlike prior approaches, which cannot condition on architectural\nconstraints, SemLayoutDiff employs a categorical diffusion model capable of\nconditioning scene synthesis explicitly on room masks. It first generates a\ncoherent semantic map, followed by a cross-attention-based network to predict\nfurniture placements that respect the synthesized layout. Our method also\naccounts for architectural elements such as doors and windows, ensuring that\ngenerated furniture arrangements remain practical and unobstructed. Experiments\non the 3D-FRONT dataset show that SemLayoutDiff produces spatially coherent,\nrealistic, and varied scenes, outperforming previous methods.",

Existing hallucination detection methods, however, are\nimpractical for real-world use, as they are either limited to short factual\nqueries or require costly external verification. We present a cheap, scalable\nmethod for real-time identification of hallucinated tokens in long-form\ngenerations, and scale it effectively to 70B parameter models. Our approach\ntargets \\emph{entity-level hallucinations} -- e.g., fabricated names, dates,\ncitations -- rather than claim-level, thereby naturally mapping to token-level\nlabels and enabling streaming detection. We develop an annotation methodology\nthat leverages web search to annotate model responses with grounded labels\nindicating which tokens correspond to fabricated entities. This dataset enables\nus to train effective hallucination classifiers with simple and efficient\nmethods such as linear probes. Evaluating across four model families, our\nclassifiers consistently outperform baselines on long-form responses, including\nmore expensive methods such as semantic entropy (e.g., AUC 0.90 vs 0.71 for\nLlama-3.3-70B), and are also an improvement in short-form question-answering\nsettings. Moreover, despite being trained only with entity-level labels, our\nprobes effectively detect incorrect answers in mathematical reasoning tasks,\nindicating generalization beyond entities. While our annotation methodology is\nexpensive, we find that annotated responses from one model can be used to train\neffective classifiers on other models; accordingly, we publicly release our\ndatasets to facilitate reuse. Overall, our work suggests a promising new\napproach for scalable, real-world hallucination detection.",

In the Standard Model of particle\nphysics, neutrino decay is highly suppressed, with a predicted lifetime on the\norder of $10^{43}$ years. However, non-standard models suggest the possibility\nof significantly shorter lifetimes, ranging from $10^{12}$ to $10^{17}$ years.\nObservations to date, however, only provide a lower limit of approximately\n$10^{12}$ years for the neutrino lifetime. In PRIMA's low-resolution mode ($R\n\\sim 100$), a diffuse background analysis, combined with the removal of point\nsources associated with known galaxies in a wide-field ($\\sim 1$ square degree)\nspectroscopic survey covering in the 24-240 $\\mu$m range could facilitate a\nsearch for neutrino decay lifetimes up to $O(10^{15})$ years. The expected\nsignal from C$\\nu$B decay at 50 $\\mu$m for a neutrino lifetime of $O(10^{15})$\nyears is more than an order of magnitude fainter than the CIB and over three\norders of magnitude fainter than the zodiacal emission foreground. Taking\nadvantage of the characteristic spectral features of C$\\nu$B decay, this level\nof sensitivity can be achieved with approximately 100 hours of total\nobservation time, based on estimated surface brightness sensitivity. Searching\nfor neutrino decay at this sensitivity could place strong constraints on\nseveral non-standard theories. A positive detection would provide compelling\nevidence for non-standard contributions to neutrino decay and could directly\nreveal the cosmic neutrino background. Furthermore, the decay photon spectrum\ncould offer insights into the absolute mass of neutrinos, and key cosmological\nparameters.",

    "abstract": "With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), reinforcement\nlearning (RL) has emerged as a pivotal methodology for enhancing the reasoning\ncapabilities of LLMs. Unlike traditional pre-training approaches, RL\nencompasses multiple stages: rollout, reward, and training, which necessitates\ncollaboration among various worker types. However, current RL systems continue\nto grapple with substantial GPU underutilization, due to two primary factors:\n(1) The rollout stage dominates the overall RL process due to test-time\nscaling; (2) Imbalances in rollout lengths (within the same batch) result in\nGPU bubbles. While prior solutions like asynchronous execution and truncation\noffer partial relief, they may compromise training accuracy for efficiency.\n  Our key insight stems from a previously overlooked observation: rollout\nresponses exhibit remarkable similarity across adjacent training epochs. Based\non the insight, we introduce RhymeRL, an LLM RL system designed to accelerate\nRL training with two key innovations. First, to enhance rollout generation, we\npresent HistoSpec, a speculative decoding inference engine that utilizes the\nsimilarity of historical rollout token sequences to obtain accurate drafts.\nSecond, to tackle rollout bubbles, we introduce HistoPipe, a two-tier\nscheduling strategy that leverages the similarity of historical rollout\ndistributions to balance workload among rollout workers. We have evaluated\nRhymeRL within a real production environment, demonstrating scalability from\ndozens to thousands of GPUs. Experimental results demonstrate that RhymeRL\nachieves a 2.6x performance improvement over existing methods, without\ncompromising accuracy or modifying the RL paradigm.",

Although exercise rehabilitation is a staple in\nrelieving pain and improving muscle function for the condition, traditional\none-on-one rehabilitation sessions are costly and suffer from poor adherence\nand accessibility for the patients. Thanks to the increasing accessibility and\nrecent advancements in sensing and display technology, virtual reality (VR)\noffers the potential to tackle the challenges in traditional exercise\nrehabilitation, particularly through gamification. However, still in its\ninfancy, VR-based neck exercise rehabilitation lacks exploration in effective\ngamification strategies and existing prototypes. To address the knowledge gap,\nwe conduct an exploratory study on the gamification strategies for VR-based\ncervical rehabilitation exercises by using chin tuck and neck range of motion\nexercises as examples. Specifically, with different game themes, we investigate\na survival and level progression strategy for muscle strengthening (chin tuck)\nexercise for the first time, and the suitability of ambient reward for a neck\nrange of motion exercise. Through a preliminary user study, we assess the\nproposed novel VR neck rehabilitation games and they demonstrate excellent\nusability, engagement, and perceived health value.",

Here we demonstrate a simple in situ transfer strategy for van der\nWaals integration, in which a thin film of amorphous water ice acts as a buffer\nlayer to shield against the bombardment of energetic clusters during\nmetallization. After ice sublimation, the deposited metal film can be gently\nand in situ placed onto underlying substrates, to form an atomically clean and\ndamage-free metal-semiconductor interface. This strategy allows ultra-clean and\nnon-destructive fabrication of high-quality contacts on monolayer MoS2, which\nis extremely beneficial to produce a high-performance 2D field-effect\ntransistor with an ultra-high on/off ratio of 1010, mobility of 80 (cm2\nV-1s-1), and also with reduced Fermi level pinning effect. We also demonstrate\nthe batch production of CVD-grown MoS2 transistor arrays with uniform\nelectrical characteristics.

Traditional concurrency\ncontrol approaches encounter significant difficulties under high contention,\nresulting in excessive transaction aborts and deadlocks. In this paper, we\npropose Brook-2PL, a novel two-phase locking (2PL) protocol that (1) introduces\nSLW-Graph for deadlock-free transaction execution, and (2) proposes partial\ntransaction chopping for early lock release. Previous methods suffer from\ntransaction aborts that lead to wasted work and can further burden the system\ndue to their cascading effects. Brook-2PL addresses this limitation by\nstatically analyzing a new graph-based dependency structure called SLW-Graph,\nenabling deadlock-free two-phase locking through predetermined lock\nacquisition. Brook-2PL also reduces contention by enabling early lock release\nusing partial transaction chopping and static transaction analysis. We overcome\nthe inherent limitations of traditional transaction chopping by providing a\nmore flexible chopping method. Evaluation using both our synthetic online game\nstore workload and the TPC-C benchmark shows that Brook-2PL significantly\noutperforms state-of-the-art CC protocols.

Improvements to protein force\nfields for increased accuracy in secondary structure prediction and new water\nmodels with increased water-water dispersion interactions have been proposed in\nsearch of a generalized simulation method. Validating the proposed improvements\nagainst experiments poses challenges such as a lack of suitable systems to test\nthe generalizability and choosing a property of interest to match the\nsimulation results against experiments. In this work, we use small angle X-ray\nscattering (SAXS) data from peptide-based polyampholytes that mimic IDPs to\ntest the generalizability of the AMBER protein force fields and the OPC water\nmodel. The specific improvements due to the AMBER ff19SB protein force field\nand the OPC water model are isolated and studied. Analysis of SAXS profiles and\nthe conformational distribution of polyampholyte sequences show the AMBER\nff19SB-OPC water combination to be a generalized model that predicts both\nordered polyampholyte sequences and disordered polyampholyte sequences in good\nagreement with experiments.

In binary systems, such radiation-driven torques can change the mutual\nasteroid orbits, termed the binary YORP or BYORP effect. To study how binary\nasteroid shapes and thermophysical properties affect surface temperatures and\nBYORP, we developed a new 3D thermophysical model which balances insolation, 1D\nconduction, visible light reflection, and mutual heating through scattered\ninfrared radiation. Using 3D ray tracing, we include eclipses, shadowing from\nhorizons and topography, and mutual radiation exchange between the primary and\nsecondary asteroids. We perform global modeling of the binary asteroid (175706)\n1996 FG3, a Janus mission target. At perihelion, we find that the 1996 FG3\nsystem experiences temperatures between 100 and 475 K. We find that eclipses\nand thermal inertia can alter secondary surface temperatures by up to 14%, with\na mean difference due to radiation from the primary of just over 1%. We also\npresent a model for calculating the BYORP effect using binary thermophysical\nmodel results. This model compares well to analytical approximations of the\nBYORP coefficient B, and suggests that thermal effects like eclipses and\nthermal inertia can reduce torque in the 1996 FG3 system and alter the BYORP\ncoefficient by up to several percent. For 1996 FG3, eclipses alter B by\napproximately 7%, resulting in a lower torque on the secondary. Though small,\nin the absence of tidal effects this would reduce the contraction of the\nsemimajor axis by about 20 meters over 10,000 years. Our findings suggest that\nthermal effects can alter temperatures and BYORP calculations sufficiently that\nthey should be included when modeling binaries. The relative importance of each\neffect is predicted to vary with the properties of the studied system.",
