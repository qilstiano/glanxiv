    "abstract": "The development of novel autonomous underwater gliders has been hindered by\nlimited shape diversity, primarily due to the reliance on traditional design\ntools that depend heavily on manual trial and error. Building an automated\ndesign framework is challenging due to the complexities of representing glider\nshapes and the high computational costs associated with modeling complex\nsolid-fluid interactions. In this work, we introduce an AI-enhanced automated\ncomputational framework designed to overcome these limitations by enabling the\ncreation of underwater robots with non-trivial hull shapes. Our approach\ninvolves an algorithm that co-optimizes both shape and control signals,\nutilizing a reduced-order geometry representation and a differentiable\nneural-network-based fluid surrogate model. This end-to-end design workflow\nfacilitates rapid iteration and evaluation of hydrodynamic performance, leading\nto the discovery of optimal and complex hull shapes across various control\nsettings. We validate our method through wind tunnel experiments and swimming\npool gliding tests, demonstrating that our computationally designed gliders\nsurpass manually designed counterparts in terms of energy efficiency. By\naddressing challenges in efficient shape representation and neural fluid\nsurrogate models, our work paves the way for the development of highly\nefficient underwater gliders, with implications for long-range ocean\nexploration and environmental monitoring.",

The fundamental challenge in CGH is solving the inverse problem of\nphase retrieval from intensity measurements. Physics-inspired neural networks\n(PINNs), especially Gerchberg-Saxton-based PINNs (GS-PINNs), have advanced\nphase retrieval capabilities. However, their performance strongly depends on\nforward models (FMs) and their hyperparameters (FMHs), limiting generalization,\ncomplicating benchmarking, and hindering hardware optimization. We present a\nsystematic sensitivity analysis framework based on Saltelli's extension of\nSobol's method to quantify FMH impacts on GS-PINN performance. Our analysis\ndemonstrates that SLM pixel-resolution is the primary factor affecting neural\nnetwork sensitivity, followed by pixel-pitch, propagation distance, and\nwavelength. Free space propagation forward models demonstrate superior neural\nnetwork performance compared to Fourier holography, providing enhanced\nparameterization and generalization. We introduce a composite evaluation metric\ncombining performance consistency, generalization capability, and\nhyperparameter perturbation resilience, establishing a unified benchmarking\nstandard across CGH configurations. Our research connects physics-inspired deep\nlearning theory with practical CGH implementations through concrete guidelines\nfor forward model selection, neural network architecture, and performance\nevaluation.

Our findings reveal that warming waters absorb\natmospheric CO2 by promoting calcium carbonate formation, acidifying seawater\nand boosting CO2 release to the atmosphere in late autumn and winter, when\natmospheric CO2 becomes highest. The model predicts a net annual CO2 rise of 2\nppmv, driven by calcification rather than land-based processes. Seasonal pH\nswings of 0.04 units corroborate this mechanism.

However, current implementations of BCI-controlled walking\nstill have significant drawbacks. In particular, prior systems are\nunidirectional and lack sensory feedback for insensate patients, have\nsuboptimal reliance on brain signals from the bilateral arm areas of the motor\ncortex, and depend on external systems for signal processing. Motivated by\nthese shortcomings, this study is the first time a bidirectional brain-computer\ninterface (BDBCI) has demonstrated the restoration of both brain-controlled\nwalking and leg sensory feedback while utilizing the bilateral leg motor and\nsensory cortices. Here, a subject undergoing subdural electrocorticogram\nelectrode implantation for epilepsy surgery evaluation leveraged the leg\nrepresentation areas of the bilateral interhemispheric primary motor and\nsensory cortices to operate a BDBCI with high performance. Although electrode\nimplantation in the interhemispheric region is uncommon, electrodes can be\nsafely implanted in this region to access rich leg motor information and\ndeliver bilateral leg sensory feedback. Finally, we demonstrated that all BDBCI\noperations can be executed on a dedicated, portable embedded system. These\nresults indicate that BDBCIs can potentially provide brain-controlled\nambulation and artificial leg sensation to people with paraplegia after spinal\ncord injury in a manner that emulates full-implantability and is untethered\nfrom any external systems.",

In this paper, a novel adjustable power radiation model\nis proposed for PASS, where power radiation ratios of pinching antennas can be\nflexibly controlled by tuning the spacing between pinching antennas and\nwaveguides. A closed-form pinching antenna spacing arrangement strategy is\nderived to achieve the commonly assumed equal-power radiation. Based on this, a\npractical PASS framework relying on discrete activation is considered, where\npinching antennas can only be activated among a set of predefined locations. A\ntransmit power minimization problem is formulated, which jointly optimizes the\ntransmit beamforming, pinching beamforming, and the numbers of activated\npinching antennas, subject to each user's minimum rate requirement. (1) To\nsolve the resulting highly coupled mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP)\nproblem, branch-and-bound (BnB)-based algorithms are proposed for both\nsingle-user and multi-user scenarios, which is guaranteed to converge to\nglobally optimal solutions. (2) A low-complexity many-to-many matching\nalgorithm is further developed. Combined with the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT)\ntheory, locally optimal and pairwise-stable solutions are obtained within\npolynomial-time complexity. Simulation results demonstrate that: (i) PASS\nsignificantly outperforms conventional multi-antenna architectures,\nparticularly when the number of users and the spatial range increase; and (ii)\nThe proposed matching-based algorithm achieves near-optimal performance,\nresulting in only a slight performance loss while significantly reducing\ncomputational overheads.

We propose a novel framework that combines\ndoubly robust estimators for various estimands under covariate shift of ECs\nwith conformal selective borrowing (CSB) to address outcome incomparability.\nCSB uses conformal inference with nearest-neighbor-based conformal scores and\ntheir label-conditional extensions to perform finite-sample exact\nindividual-level EC selection, addressing the limited information in binary\noutcomes. To ensure strict type I error rate control for testing treatment\neffects while gaining power, we use a Fisher randomization test with the CSB\nestimator as the test statistic. Extensive simulations demonstrate the robust\nperformance of our methods. We apply our method to data from CALGB 9633 and the\nNational Cancer Database to evaluate chemotherapy effects in Stage IB\nnon-small-cell lung cancer patients and show that the proposed method\neffectively mitigates hidden bias introduced by full-borrowing approaches,\nstrictly controls the type I error rate, and improves the power over RCT-only\nanalysis.",

This\nblack-box access is especially limiting when constructing mixture-of-expert\ntype ensemble models since the user cannot optimize each proprietary AI's\ninternal parameters. Our problem naturally lends itself to a non-competitive\ngame-theoretic lens where each proprietary AI (agent) is inherently competing\nagainst the other AI agents, with this competition arising naturally due to\ntheir obliviousness of the AI's to their internal structure. In contrast, the\nuser acts as a central planner trying to synchronize the ensemble of competing\nAIs.\n  We show the existence of the unique Nash equilibrium in the online setting,\nwhich we even compute in closed-form by eliciting a feedback mechanism between\nany given time series and the sequence generated by each (proprietary) AI\nagent.

    "abstract": "A current limitation of video generative video models is that they generate\nplausible looking frames, but poor motion -- an issue that is not well captured\nby FVD and other popular methods for evaluating generated videos. Here we go\nbeyond FVD by developing a metric which better measures plausible object\ninteractions and motion. Our novel approach is based on auto-encoding point\ntracks and yields motion features that can be used to not only compare\ndistributions of videos (as few as one generated and one ground truth, or as\nmany as two datasets), but also for evaluating motion of single videos. We show\nthat using point tracks instead of pixel reconstruction or action recognition\nfeatures results in a metric which is markedly more sensitive to temporal\ndistortions in synthetic data, and can predict human evaluations of temporal\nconsistency and realism in generated videos obtained from open-source models\nbetter than a wide range of alternatives. We also show that by using a point\ntrack representation, we can spatiotemporally localize generative video\ninconsistencies, providing extra interpretability of generated video errors\nrelative to prior work.

For one location with the brightest emission,\nthe plasma cooled from 10 MK to 8 MK in 5 min which is longer than the expected\nconductive cooling time of 170 s, suggesting continued background heating\nduring the cooling period. Doppler shifts of between 0 and +10 km/s were\nobtained with precisions of 1-4 km/s, but the accuracies are lower due to\nuncertainties over the absolute wavelength calibration hence we can not\nconclude there are plasma flows in the flare loops.

We explicitly characterize the stationary distributions of the queueing\nprocesses in these models. It is worth noting the distinction of the stability\nconditions from the standard models, that is, the positive recurrence of the\nMarkov chains does not require the usual traffic intensity to be less than one.\n  The non--Markovian models include GI/GI/1, GI/GI/$r$ and GI/GI/$\\infty$\nqueues with random resetting to state zero. For GI/GI/1 and GI/GI/$r$ queues,\nwe consider random resetting at arrival times, and introduce modified Lindley\nrecursions and Kiefer--Wolfowitz recursions, respectively.

Uncovering these manifolds is key to understanding individual\ndifferences in brain function, yet most existing machine learning methods\neither rely on population-level spatial alignment or assume data that is\ntemporally structured, either because data is aligned among subjects or because\nevent timings are known. We introduce a manifold learning framework that can\ncapture subject-specific spatial variations across both structured and\ntemporally unstructured neuroimaging data. On simulated data and two\nnaturalistic fMRI datasets (Sherlock and Forrest Gump), our framework\noutperforms group-based baselines by recovering more accurate and\nindividualized representations. We further show that the framework scales\nefficiently to large datasets and generalizes well to new subjects. To test\nthis, we apply the framework to temporally unstructured resting-state fMRI data\nfrom individuals with schizophrenia and healthy controls. We further apply our\nmethod to a large resting-state fMRI dataset comprising individuals with\nschizophrenia and controls. In this setting, we demonstrate that the framework\nscales efficiently to large populations and generalizes robustly to unseen\nsubjects. The learned subject-specific spatial maps our model finds reveal\nclinically relevant patterns, including increased activation in the basal\nganglia, visual, auditory, and somatosensory regions, and decreased activation\nin the insula, inferior frontal gyrus, and angular gyrus. These findings\nsuggest that our framework can uncover clinically relevant subject-specific\nbrain activity patterns.

To have meaningful influence,\nindividuals must band together to engage in collective action. Groups that\nengage in such algorithmic collective action are likely to vary in size,\nmembership characteristics, and crucially, objectives. In this work, we\nintroduce a first of a kind framework for studying collective action with two\nor more collectives that strategically behave to manipulate data-driven\nsystems. With more than one collective acting on a system, unexpected\ninteractions may occur. We use this framework to conduct experiments with\nlanguage model-based classifiers and recommender systems where two collectives\neach attempt to achieve their own individual objectives. We examine how\ndiffering objectives, strategies, sizes, and homogeneity can impact a\ncollective's efficacy. We find that the unintentional interactions between\ncollectives can be quite significant; a collective acting in isolation may be\nable to achieve their objective (e.g., improve classification outcomes for\nthemselves or promote a particular item), but when a second collective acts\nsimultaneously, the efficacy of the first group drops by as much as $75\\%$. We\nfind that, in the recommender system context, neither fully heterogeneous nor\nfully homogeneous collectives stand out as most efficacious and that\nheterogeneity's impact is secondary compared to collective size. Our results\nsignal the need for more transparency in both the underlying algorithmic models\nand the different behaviors individuals or collectives may take on these\nsystems.

Additional simulations for\nnon-perforated elastic vortex generator are conducted for comparison and\nvalidation against available data. The findings demonstrate that a perforated\nelastic vortex generator can exhibit static configurations, lodging\nconfigurations, and vortex-induced vibration modes, depending on the\ndimensionless parameters. These configurations are similar to those observed\nfor non-perforated elastic vortex generators, though the response values differ\ndue to changes in the mechanical properties of the elastic vortex generator and\nthe fluid loads acting on it as a result of perforation. An analysis of the\nperforated elastic vortex generator's natural frequencies shows that\nvortex-induced vibrations are triggered by the lock-in phenomenon associated\nwith the second natural frequency of the vortex generator. Additionally, local\nflow dynamics are also studied by investigating vortical structures and\nvelocity fields.",

The\nHamiltonian of mean force $\\mathcal{H}^{*}_{\\beta}$ offers an in principle\naccurate theoretical basis by explicitly accounting for the interaction energy.\nHowever, calculating the Hamiltonian of mean force is challenging both\ntheoretically and computationally.

However, the rationale for the\nreduced J2 remained ambiguous and may suggest that parameters for long-term\nintegrations compatible with geologic observations are not fully compatible\nwith our knowledge of the current solar system (specifically J2). Here we show\nthat a reduced J2 compensates for a diminished asteroid population in long-term\nsolar system integrations, which may appear surprising. We present an analysis\nand offer a mechanism for the long-term compensating effects of J2 and asteroid\nmass in the solar system (not planetary systems in general).

The linear polarization data of WR 31a trace a \"loop\" structure in\na Stokes Q-U diagram, which is similar in all four passbands. After mean\nsubtraction, the four loops align to form a single overall pattern. Such loops\ncan be expected to arise from binary systems. We test the binary hypothesis\nwith two models.

These operators are well-defined angular momentum\noperators if and only if the connection has zero curvature. Massive particles\nhave two canonical curved connections corresponding to boosts and rotations,\nrespectively. These can be uniquely combined to produce a flat connection, and\nthis gives a novel derivation of the Newton-Wigner position operator and the\ncorresponding spin and orbital angular momenta for relativistic massive\nparticles. When the mass is taken to zero, transverse boosts and rotations\ndegenerate, leaving only a single connection for massless particles. This\nconnection produces a commonly proposed splitting of the massless angular\nmomentum into two operators. However, the connection is not flat, explaining\nwhy these operators do not satisfy the angular momentum commutation relations\nand are thus not true spin and orbital angular momentum operators.",

The subject\nmatter is a new, covariant and efficient technology of constructing entire\ntrajectories of physical string states deeper inside the string spectrum than\nthe leading Regge. The key observation behind the technology is that the\nlowering operators of a symplectic algebra appear in the Virasoro constraints\nwhich impose physicality of states in the open bosonic string. This algebra\ncommutes with the spacetime Lorentz algebra, (of the little group) of which all\nstring states are irreducible representations. Employing then the so-called\nHowe duality of representation theory, one may relate the irreducible\nrepresentations of the two algebras via a bijection. The spectrum thus splits\ninto two parts: trajectories that are lowest weight states of the symplectic\nalgebra and their infinitely many clones. The latter can then be reached by\nsuitably dressing the former with the raising operators of the symplectic\nalgebra. The technology is nontrivially extended to the open superstring, where\nthe relevant Howe dual is an orthosymplectic algebra.",

Aerosol Jet Printing (AJP) is a\nversatile AM technique that utilizes aerosolized functional materials to\naccurately print intricate patterns onto diverse substrates. Machine learning\n(ML)- based Process-Structure-Property (PSP) modeling is essential for\nenhancing AJP manufacturing, as it quantitatively connects process parameters,\nstructural features, and resulting material properties.

Five batch tests were performed: four with varying\nferric oxide doses and one control. Results showed that ferric oxide\nsignificantly enhanced total solids (TS) and volatile solids (VS) reduction.\nThe reactor with 0.5 g ferric oxide per 800 mL working volume achieved the\nhighest TS and VS reduction, corresponding to the maximum methane yield of\n9878.95 L methane per kg volatile solid. At this optimal dosage, biogas\nproduction increased by 81 percent compared to the control. However, further\nincreases in ferric oxide above the optimal dosage concentration decreases\nbiogas yield, indicating a threshold beyond which inhibitory effects occur. In\naddition, at this optimal dosage, reduction in BOD and COD was observed due to\nenhanced microbial activity. Furthermore, ferric oxide stabilizes anaerobic\ndigestion by mitigating inhibitory compounds and promoting direct interspecies\nelectron transfer, leading to improved methane yield.

    "abstract": "This work presents a new approach to the guidance and control of marine craft\nvia HEOL, i.e., a new way of combining flatness-based and model-free\ncontrollers. Its goal is to develop a general regulator for Unmanned Surface\nVehicles (USV). To do so, the well-known USV maneuvering model is simplified\ninto a nominal Hovercraft model which is flat. A flatness-based controller is\nderived for the simplified USV model and the loop is closed via an intelligent\nproportional-derivative (iPD) regulator. We thus associate the well-documented\nnatural robustness of flatness-based control and adaptivity of iPDs. The\ncontroller is applied in simulation to two surface vessels, one meeting the\nsimplifying hypotheses, the other one being a generic USV of the literature. It\nis shown to stabilize both systems even in the presence of unmodeled\nenvironmental disturbances.",

This work introduces the bi-fidelity\nstochastic subspace descent (BF-SSD) algorithm, a novel zeroth-order\noptimization method designed to reduce this computational burden. BF-SSD\nleverages a bi-fidelity framework, constructing a surrogate model from a\ncombination of computationally inexpensive low-fidelity (LF) and accurate\nhigh-fidelity (HF) function evaluations.

    "abstract": "We propose a sensor-restrained model for the shear viscosity term within the\nlocalized artificial diffusivity (LAD) scheme to stabilize compressible\nlarge-eddy simulations with low-pressure-core vortical structures. LAD methods\nare used in numerical solvers based on spectral-like compact finite-difference\nschemes. While high-order-accurate numerical schemes with proper discretization\nguarantees physical fidelity, the LAD role is to suppress non-physical\noscillations arising in compressible flow simulations near shock waves and\nother sharp gradients. LAD is a cost-effective approach which adds artificial\nshear and bulk viscosities, and thermal conductivity to their physical\ncounterparts. However, an unrestricted added diffusivity may lead to\npoorly-resolved coherent structures and undesirable turbulence statistics. In\norder to prevent excessive numerical diffusion in compressible shear flows, the\nartificial shear viscosity term can be disabled in cases where the simulation\nis already stable. However, in flow simulations where vortices emerge within a\nlow-pressure region, a strong pressure decay may lead to instabilities that\nmake the simulation unstable. For such cases, adding artificial shear viscosity\nis necessary to maintain numerical stability, as this issue is unaddressed by\nthe artificial bulk viscosity and thermal conductivity alone. Our approach\nintegrates a sensor into the standard LAD formulation, particularly in the\nartificial shear viscosity, that reduces the added diffusivity while preserving\nnumerical stability. This advancement is possible by adding the shear\ndiffusivity only in localized flow regions consisting of low-pressure-core\nvortices, and it enables stable and accurate large-eddy simulations (LES) of\ncompressible vortex-dominated flows, such as those encountered in separated\nflows and bluff-body wakes.",

By\ncontrast, when a grain strikes the bed, the process leading to grain ejections\nintroduces a collective granular length scale that determines the scale of the\nripples. We propose a theoretical model that predicts a relatively constant\nripple size for most planetary conditions. In addition, our model predicts that\nfor high-density atmospheres, such as on Venus, or for sufficiently large sand\ngrains on Earth, impact ripples propagate upwind. Although wind-tunnel and\nfield experiments are needed to confirm the existence of such 'antiripples', we\nsuggest that our quantitative model of wind-blown sediment transport may be\nused to deduce geological and environmental conditions on other planets from\nthe sizes and propagation speeds of impact ripples.",

    "abstract": "Visually impaired people face significant challenges when attempting to\ninteract with and understand complex environments, and traditional assistive\ntechnologies often struggle to quickly provide necessary contextual\nunderstanding and interactive intelligence. This thesis presents Audo-Sight, a\nstate-of-the-art assistive system that seamlessly integrates Multimodal Large\nLanguage Models (MLLMs) to provide expedient, context-aware interactions for\nBlind and Visually Impaired (BVI) individuals. The system operates in two\ndifferent modalities: personalized interaction through user identification and\npublic access in common spaces like museums and shopping malls. In tailored\nenvironments, the system adjusts its output to conform to the preferences of\nindividual users, thus enhancing accessibility through a user-aware form of\ninteraction. In shared environments, Audo-Sight employs a shared architecture\nthat adapts to its current user with no manual reconfiguration required. To\nfacilitate appropriate interactions with the LLM, the public Audo-Sight\nsolution includes an Age-Range Determiner and Safe Query Filter. Additionally,\nthe system ensures that responses are respectful to BVI users through NeMo\nGuardrails. By utilizing multimodal reasoning, BVI-cognizant response editing,\nand safeguarding features, this work represents a major leap in AI-driven\naccessibility technology capable of increasing autonomy, safety, and\ninteraction for people with visual impairments in social settings. Finally, we\npresent the integration of Audo-Sight and SmartSight, which enables enhanced\nsituational awareness for BVI individuals. This integration takes advantage of\nthe real-time visual analysis of SmartSight, combined with the extensive\nreasoning and interactive capabilities of Audo-Sight, and goes beyond object\nidentification to provide context-driven, voice-controlled assistance in\ndynamic environments.",

    "abstract": "The rapid evolution of social media has provided enhanced communication\nchannels for individuals to create online content, enabling them to express\ntheir thoughts and opinions. Multimodal memes, often utilized for playful or\nhumorous expressions with visual and textual elements, are sometimes misused to\ndisseminate hate speech against individuals or groups. While the detection of\nhateful memes is well-researched, developing effective methods to transform\nhateful content in memes remains a significant challenge. Leveraging the\npowerful generation and reasoning capabilities of Vision-Language Models\n(VLMs), we address the tasks of detecting and mitigating hateful content. This\npaper presents two key contributions: first, a definition-guided prompting\ntechnique for detecting hateful memes, and second, a unified framework for\nmitigating hateful content in memes, named UnHateMeme, which works by replacing\nhateful textual and/or visual components. With our definition-guided prompts,\nVLMs achieve impressive performance on hateful memes detection task.\nFurthermore, our UnHateMeme framework, integrated with VLMs, demonstrates a\nstrong capability to convert hateful memes into non-hateful forms that meet\nhuman-level criteria for hate speech and maintain multimodal coherence between\nimage and text. Through empirical experiments, we show the effectiveness of\nstate-of-the-art pretrained VLMs such as LLaVA, Gemini and GPT-4o on the\nproposed tasks, providing a comprehensive analysis of their respective\nstrengths and limitations for these tasks.

Here we show this feasibility using Neural\nGeneral Circulation Model (NeuralGCM), a hybrid ML-physics atmospheric model\ndeveloped by Google, for seasonal predictions of large-scale atmospheric\nvariability and Northern Hemisphere tropical cyclone (TC) activity. Inspired by\nphysical model studies, we simplify boundary conditions, assuming sea surface\ntemperature (SST) and sea ice follow their climatological cycle but persist\nanomalies present at the initialization time.

This configuration yields useful seasonal predictions\n(July to November) for the tropical atmosphere and various TC activity metrics.\nNotably, the predicted and observed TC frequency in the North Atlantic and East\nPacific basins are significantly correlated during 1990 to 2023 (r=~0.7),\nsuggesting prediction skill comparable to existing physical GCMs. Despite\nchallenges associated with model resolution and simplified boundary forcings,\nthe model-predicted interannual variations demonstrate significant correlations\nwith the observation, including the sub-basin TC tracks (p<0.1) and basin-wide\naccumulated cyclone energy (p<0.01) of the North Atlantic and North Pacific\nbasins.

Recent works (Didolkar et al., 2024a; 2024b) show that\nICL performance can be improved by leveraging a frontier large language model's\n(LLM) ability to predict required skills to solve a problem, popularly referred\nto as an LLM's metacognition, and using the recommended skills to construct\nnecessary in-context examples. While this skill-based strategy boosts ICL\nperformance in larger models, its gains on small language models (SLMs) have\nbeen minimal, highlighting a performance gap in ICL capabilities. We\ninvestigate this gap and show that skill-based prompting can hurt SLM\nperformance on easy questions by introducing unnecessary information, akin to\ncognitive overload. To address this, we introduce AdaptMI, an adaptive approach\nto selecting skill-based in-context Math Instructions for SLMs. Inspired by\ncognitive load theory from human pedagogy, our method only introduces\nskill-based examples when the model performs poorly. We further propose\nAdaptMI+, which adds examples targeted to the specific skills missing from the\nmodel's responses. On 5-shot evaluations across popular math benchmarks and\nfive SLMs (1B--7B; Qwen, Llama), AdaptMI+ improves accuracy by up to 6% over\nnaive skill-based strategies.",

    "abstract": "We introduce a novel approach for calibrating uncertainty quantification (UQ)\ntailored for multi-modal large language models (LLMs). Existing\nstate-of-the-art UQ methods rely on consistency among multiple responses\ngenerated by the LLM on an input query under diverse settings. However, these\napproaches often report higher confidence in scenarios where the LLM is\nconsistently incorrect. This leads to a poorly calibrated confidence with\nrespect to accuracy. To address this, we leverage cross-modal consistency in\naddition to self-consistency to improve the calibration of the multi-modal\nmodels. Specifically, we ground the textual responses to the visual inputs. The\nconfidence from the grounding model is used to calibrate the overall\nconfidence. Given that using a grounding model adds its own uncertainty in the\npipeline, we apply temperature scaling - a widely accepted parametric\ncalibration technique - to calibrate the grounding model's confidence in the\naccuracy of generated responses. We evaluate the proposed approach across\nmultiple multi-modal tasks, such as medical question answering (Slake) and\nvisual question answering (VQAv2), considering multi-modal models such as\nLLaVA-Med and LLaVA. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework\nachieves significantly improved calibration on both tasks.",

Despite significant advances in video\nsynthesis, creating 3D videos remains challenging due to the relative scarcity\nof 3D video data. We propose a simple approach for transforming a text-to-video\ngenerator into a video-to-stereo generator. Given an input video, our framework\nautomatically produces the video frames from a shifted viewpoint, enabling a\ncompelling 3D effect. Prior and concurrent approaches for this task typically\noperate in multiple phases, first estimating video disparity or depth, then\nwarping the video accordingly to produce a second view, and finally inpainting\nthe disoccluded regions. This approach inherently fails when the scene involves\nspecular surfaces or transparent objects. In such cases, single-layer disparity\nestimation is insufficient, resulting in artifacts and incorrect pixel shifts\nduring warping. Our work bypasses these restrictions by directly synthesizing\nthe new viewpoint, avoiding any intermediate steps. This is achieved by\nleveraging a pre-trained video model's priors on geometry, object materials,\noptics, and semantics, without relying on external geometry models or manually\ndisentangling geometry from the synthesis process. We demonstrate the\nadvantages of our approach in complex, real-world scenarios featuring diverse\nobject materials and compositions. See videos on\nhttps://video-eye2eye.github.io",

The method yields a series of quantum master\nequations for all core tensors in the TTN that efficiently and accurately\ncapture the open quantum dynamics for non-Markovian environments to all orders\nin the system-bath interaction. These master equations are constructed based on\nthe time-dependent Dirac--Frenkel variational principle which isolates the\noptimal dynamics for the core tensors given the TTN ansatz.

We implement three general propagators for the\ncoupled master equations: Two fixed-rank methods that require a constant memory\nfootprint during the dynamics, and one adaptive-rank method with variable\nmemory footprint controlled by the target level of computational error. We\nexemplify the utility of these methods by simulating a two-level system coupled\nto a structured bath containing one Drude--Lorentz component and eight Brownian\noscillators, which is beyond what can presently be computed using the standard\nHEOM. Our results show that the TTN-HEOM is capable to simulate both dephasing\nand relaxation dynamics of driven quantum system interacting with structured\nbaths, even those of chemical complexity, with affordable computational cost.",

In our previous work\n\\cite{shang2023stereo}, we proposed a stereo X-ray tomography system to map the\n3D position of fiducial markers using only two projections of a static volume.\nIn dynamic imaging settings, where objects undergo deformations during imaging,\nthis static method can be extended by utilizing additional temporal\ninformation. We thus extend the method to track the deformation of fiducial\nmarkers in 3D space, where we use knowledge of the initial object shape as\nprior information, improving the prediction of the evolution of its deformed\nstate over time. In particular, knowledge of the initial object's stereo\nprojections is shown to improve the method's robustness to noise when detecting\nfiducial marker locations in the projections of the deformed objects.\nFurthermore, after feature detection, by using the features' initial 3D\nposition information in the undeformed object, we can also demonstrate\nimprovements in the 3D mapping of the deformed features. Using a range of\ndeformed 3D objects, this new approach is shown to be able to track fiducial\nmarkers in noisy stereo tomography images with subpixel accuracy.",

In this work, we employ molecular beam epitaxy to synthesize\na series of magnetic TI penta-layers by varying the thickness of the middle\nmagnetic TI layer, designated as m quintuple layers.

The quantum phase transition between C = 1 and C = 2\nQAH states is attributed to the weakening of the interlayer coupling between\nthe top and the bottom C = 1 QAH layers.

Traditional template-based\nregistration of the spinal cord uses intervertebral discs for alignment.\nHowever, substantial anatomical variability across individuals exists between\nvertebral and spinal levels. This study proposes a novel registration approach\nthat leverages spinal nerve rootlets to improve alignment accuracy and\nreproducibility across individuals. We developed a registration method\nleveraging dorsal cervical rootlets segmentation and aligning them non-linearly\nwith the PAM50 spinal cord template. Validation was performed on a\nmulti-subject, multi-site dataset (n=267, 44 sites) and a multi-subject dataset\nwith various neck positions (n=10, 3 sessions). We further validated the method\non task-based functional MRI (n=23) to compare group-level activation maps\nusing rootlet-based registration to traditional disc-based methods.\nRootlet-based registration showed superior alignment across individuals\ncompared to the traditional disc-based method. Notably, rootlet positions were\nmore stable across neck positions.

A closely-related research design, the unanchored indirect\ntreatment comparison, is often required for disconnected treatment networks in\nhealth technology assessment. We present a unified causal inference framework\nfor both research designs. We develop a novel estimator that augments a popular\nweighting approach based on entropy balancing -- matching-adjusted indirect\ncomparison (MAIC) -- by fitting a model for the conditional outcome\nexpectation. The predictions of the outcome model are combined with the entropy\nbalancing MAIC weights. While the standard MAIC estimator is singly robust\nwhere the outcome model is non-linear, our augmented MAIC approach is doubly\nrobust, providing increased robustness against model misspecification. This is\ndemonstrated in a simulation study with binary outcomes and a logistic outcome\nmodel, where the augmented estimator demonstrates its doubly robust property,\nwhile exhibiting higher precision than all non-augmented weighting estimators\nand near-identical precision to G-computation. We describe the extension of our\nestimator to the setting with unavailable individual participant data for the\nexternal control, illustrating it through an applied example. Our findings\nreinforce the understanding that entropy balancing-based approaches have\ndesirable properties compared to standard ``modeling'' approaches to weighting,\nbut should be augmented to improve protection against bias and guarantee double\nrobustness.",

Although deep learning has\nadvanced automated ECG analysis, many existing models abstract away the\nsignal's intrinsic temporal and morphological features, lack interpretability,\nand are computationally intensive-hindering their deployment on\nresource-constrained platforms.

Over the last decades, various efforts have attempted to formalize\nand systematize such processes in terms of instantons similar to the nucleation\ndroplets of first- order phase transitions. In particular, Kirkpatrick,\nThirumalai, and Wolynes proposed in the late '80s an influential nucleation\ntheory of relaxation in structural glasses. Already within this picture,\nhowever, the resulting structures are far from the compact objects expected\nfrom the classical droplet description. In addition, an altogether different\ntype of single-particle hopping-like instantons has recently been isolated in\nmolecular simulations. Landscape studies of mean-field spin glass models have\nfurther revealed that simple saddle crossing does not capture relaxation in\nthese systems. We present here a landscape-agnostic study of rare dynamical\nevents, which delineates the richness of instantons in these systems. Our work\nnot only captures the structure of metastable states, but also identifies the\npoint of irreversibility, beyond which activated relaxation processes become a\nfait accompli.

These\ncause the implemented unitary operations to deviate randomly from their\nintended targets, following distributions with finite variance. Whilst\nfull-scale quantum error correction remains challenging in the near term,\nquantum error mitigation schemes have been devised to estimate expectation\nvalues, but it is unclear how these schemes would work for sampling\nexperiments. In this work, we demonstrate that, given access to multiple\nstochastic unitaries, it is possible to mitigate the effect of these errors in\nsampling experiments. We adopt the unitary averaging protocol which employs\nmultiple stochastic boson samplers to generate a distribution that approximates\nthe ideal boson sampler distribution as the number of samplers increases. We\nderive a rigorous upper bound on the trace distance between the output\nprobability distributions induced by invertible vacuum-heralded networks based\non the Schur-Weyl duality. This result can be seen concretely as an error\nmitigation scheme in sampling experiments against stochastic errors. On a\nbroader level, it suggests a path towards understanding error mitigation for\nsampling experiments and developing analysis tools for photonic circuits\nincorporating measurements and feed-forward. We further provide other\napplications of unitary averaging, including its use in implementing the linear\ncombination of unitaries and benchmarking fabrication repeatability in linear\noptics.",

Our approach\nemploys two complementary physiological models: (1) accurate modeling of heart\nrate (HR) dynamics via a physiologically constrained ordinary differential\nequation (ODE) and neural Kalman filter, trained on over 3 million HR\nobservations, achieving 1-second interval predictions with mean absolute errors\nas low as 2.81\\,bpm (correlation 0.87); and (2) leveraging the principles of\nprecise HR modeling, a novel VO$_{2}$ prediction architecture requiring only\nthe initial second of VO$_{2}$ data for calibration, enabling robust,\nsequence-to-sequence metabolic demand estimation. Despite relying solely on\nsmartwatch and chest-strap data, our method achieves mean absolute percentage\nerrors of approximately 13\\%, effectively capturing rapid physiological\ntransitions and steady-state conditions across diverse running intensities. Our\nsynchronized dataset, complemented by blood lactate measurements, further lays\nthe foundation for future noninvasive metabolic zone identification.

Concerns about overreliance coexist with a gap in research on\nstructured scaffolding to guide tool use in formal courses. This study examines\nthe impact of a dedicated \"AI-Lab\" intervention -- emphasizing guided\nscaffolding and mindful engagement -- on undergraduate students in Data\nStructures and Algorithms, Competitive Programming, and first-year engineering\ncourses at Purdue University.\n  Over three semesters, we integrated AI-Lab modules into four mandatory and\nelective courses, yielding 831 matched pre- and post-intervention survey\nresponses, alongside focus group discussions. Employing a mixed-methods\napproach, we analyzed quantitative shifts in usage patterns and attitudes as\nwell as qualitative narratives of student experiences.\n  While the overall frequency of GenAI usage for homework or programming\nprojects remained largely stable, we observed large effect sizes in comfort and\nopenness across conceptual, debugging, and homework problems. Notably, usage\npatterns for debugging also shifted statistically significantly, reflecting\nstudents' more mindful and deliberate approach. Focus group discussions\ncorroborated these results, suggesting that the intervention \"bridged the gap\"\nbetween naive GenAI usage and more nuanced, reflective integration of AI tools\ninto coursework, ultimately heightening students' awareness of their own skill\ndevelopment.\n  These findings suggest that structured, scaffolded interventions can enable\nstudents to harness GenAI's benefits without undermining essential\ncompetencies.

Typically, the decay of the error\nterm ranges from $1/\\mathrm{poly}(N)$ in the best case to $1/\\mathrm{poly}(\\log\nN)$ in the worst case, depending on the differentiability of the spectral\nfunction at the origin.

To achieve this, we introduce a topological\nproperty of quantum systems that we call the quantum overlap gap property\n(QOGP). This property is only satisfied by systems with an efficient local\nlearning algorithm for the energy. We prove that systems which exhibit this\ntopological property in their low-energy space are intractable for quantum\nalgorithms whose outputs are stable under perturbations to their inputs. We\nthen prove that the QOGP is satisfied for a sparsified variant of the quantum\n$p$-spin model, giving the first known algorithmic hardness-of-approximation\nresult for quantum algorithms in finding the ground state of a non-stoquastic,\nnoncommuting quantum system. Our resulting lower bound for quantum algorithms\noptimizing this model using Lindbladian evolution matches the best-known time\nlower bound for classical Langevin dynamics optimizing classical $p$-spin\nmodels. For this reason we suspect that finding ground states of typical\nquantum $p$-spin models using quantum algorithms is, in practice, as\nintractable as the classical $p$-spin model is for classical algorithms.\nInversely, we show that the Sachdev--Ye--Kitaev (SYK) model does not exhibit\nthe QOGP, consistent with previous evidence that the model is rapidly mixing at\nlow temperatures.",

    "abstract": "The quantum geometric tensor, which has the quantum metric and Berry\ncurvature as its real and imaginary parts, plays a key role in the transport\nproperties of condensed matter systems. In the nonlinear regime, the quantum\nmetric dipole and Berry curvature dipole provide two distinct mechanisms for\ngenerating nonlinear Hall effects, which can both be experimentally observed in\nsystems with suitable symmetries. In this work, we investigate the role of\nquantum geometry in nonlinear thermoelectric responses. We derive a series of\nnonlinear thermoelectric effects governed by the Berry curvature dipole and the\nquantum metric dipole, respectively. Among them, we identify a particularly\ninteresting quantized thermoelectric response that directly measures the total\nchirality of Weyl points below the Fermi level. For general nonlinear\nresponses, we derive the nonlinear analogs of the Wiedemann-Franz law and\nMott's formula. These provide a means to estimate the magnitude of nonlinear\nthermoelectric responses based on existing nonlinear Hall measurements. Our\nestimates suggest that these effects should be observable in several candidate\nmaterials, with In-doped Pb$_{1-x}$Sn$_x$Te standing out as the most promising.\nOur work offers new insights into the experimental study of quantum geometry\nthrough nonlinear thermoelectric measurements.",

The regularised\ntheories are related by a field redefinition to the original truncated EFTs and\nthey propagate massive ghost fields (whose masses can be chosen to be of the\norder of the UV mass scale), in addition to the light field. We numerically\nsolve the equations of motion of the UV theory and those of the regularised\nEFTs in $1+1$-dimensional Minkowski space for various choices of initial data\nand UV mass parameter. When derivatives of the initial data are sufficiently\nsmall compared to the UV mass scale, the regularised EFTs exhibit stable\nevolution in the computational domain and provide very accurate approximations\nof the UV theory. On the other hand, when the initial gradients of the light\nfield are comparable to the UV mass scale, the effective field theory\ndescription breaks down and the corresponding regularised EFTs exhibit\nghost-like/tachyonic instabilities. Finally, we also formulate a conjecture on\nthe global nonlinear stability of the vacuum in the regularised scalar EFTs in\n$3+1$ dimensions.

Using this expression, we find that, in\ngeneral, the correction to the superfluid weight due to the response of the\nsuperconductor's pairing potential to the perturbing vector potential is\nimportant in superconductors with a strongly inhomogeneous pairing potential.\nWe consider two exemplary cases: the case when strong inhomogeneities in the\npairing potential are induced by a periodic potential, and the case when\nsuperconducting vortices are induced by an external magnetic field. For both\ncases we show that the correction to the superfluid weight due to the response\nof the paring potential to the perturbing vector potential can be significant,\nit must be included to obtain quantitatively correct results, and that for the\ncase when vortices are present the expression of the superfluid weight that\ndoes not include such correction returns qualitatively wrong results.",

We calculate a ``renormalized''\nout-of-time-order correlator (ROTOC) in the model with $N$ qubits, and we show\nthat the circuit-averaged ROTOC is controlled by an effective probability\ndistribution in operator weight space which obeys a system of $N$ non-linear\nequations of motion. These equations can be easily solved numerically for large\nsystem sizes which are beyond the reach of exact methods.

So far, the evolution of triple star systems has mainly been\nmodeled using fast stellar codes. Their accuracy decreases with increasing\nmass, limiting their reliability for predicting the evolutionary pathways of\nmassive triple systems. We coupled Tres, which by default uses Seba (fast\nstellar code) to Mesa to perform the first simulations of triple systems that\ncombine a triple secular evolutionary code with a detailed, on-the-fly stellar\ncode. After examining the differences between the stellar evolution predicted\nby the two codes, we simulate the evolution of a set of triple systems and\ncompare their predicted evolutionary pathways. The predicted stellar tracks\nbecome increasingly divergent with increasing mass and wind mass loss\nefficiency. The maximal radial extent, crucial for determining whether the\ncomponents of the triple systems interact, differ by up to two orders of\nmagnitude between the two stellar codes in the considered mass range. This\nleads to divergences in the triples evolutionary pathways predicted by mesa and\nseba. Using mesa instead of seba, the minimum period for avoiding inner mass\ntransfer is reduced by three orders of magnitude. This has important\nconsequences for the formation of GW sources through the triple compact object\nchannel. Our simulations offer new insights into the physics of triple systems,\nas key processes (mass loss, radial expansion, precession) are treated\nself-consistently. They indicate that the results of triple systems population\nsynthesis studies must be interpreted cautiously, in particular when the\nconsidered masses are outside the range of the grid the fast codes are based on\nand when significant stellar winds are considered.",

This is due to the elastic deformation of channel walls that can\nstore and release fluid, as electric capacitors can store and release electric\ncharges. This property is quantified through the compliance of the system,\ndefined as the volume change relative to the pressure change. In systems with\nrigid walls and incompressible fluid, compliance vanishes and no oscillations\ncan occur through this mechanism. Here, we show that not only oscillations but\nalso chaos can emerge in the flow-rate dynamics of non-compliant microfluidic\nnetworks with incompressible fluid. Notably, these dynamics emerge\nspontaneously, even under time-independent driving pressures. The underlying\nmechanism is governed by the effect of fluid inertia, which becomes relevant at\nmoderate Reynolds numbers observed in microfluidic systems exhibiting complex\nflow patterns. The results are established using a combination of direct\nnumerical simulations and a reduced model derived from modal analysis.

To\naddress these challenges, we introduce ReVision, a plug-and-play framework that\nexplicitly integrates parameterized 3D physical knowledge into a pretrained\nconditional video generation model, significantly enhancing its ability to\ngenerate high-quality videos with complex motion and interactions.\nSpecifically, ReVision consists of three stages. First, a video diffusion model\nis used to generate a coarse video. Next, we extract a set of 2D and 3D\nfeatures from the coarse video to construct a 3D object-centric representation,\nwhich is then refined by our proposed parameterized physical prior model to\nproduce an accurate 3D motion sequence. Finally, this refined motion sequence\nis fed back into the same video diffusion model as additional conditioning,\nenabling the generation of motion-consistent videos, even in scenarios\ninvolving complex actions and interactions. We validate the effectiveness of\nour approach on Stable Video Diffusion, where ReVision significantly improves\nmotion fidelity and coherence. Remarkably, with only 1.5B parameters, it even\noutperforms a state-of-the-art video generation model with over 13B parameters\non complex video generation by a substantial margin.

    "abstract": "Surface codes represent a leading approach for quantum error correction\n(QEC), offering a path towards universal fault-tolerant quantum computing\n(FTQC). However, efficiently implementing algorithms, particularly using\nPauli-based computation (PBC) with lattice surgery, necessitates careful\nresource optimization. Prior work often employs static layouts and simplified\nerror models. These typically fail to capture the full costs and dynamic nature\nof active computation, leading to resource bottlenecks and suboptimal\narchitectural designs. To address this, we introduce SPARO. SPARO features a\ncomprehensive logical error model based on a large corpus of numerical\nsimulations encompassing active Pauli-based computation (PBC)\noperations-including Pauli product measurements (PPMs), idling qubits, and\npatch rotations. Our numerical models are integrated within an end-to-end\ncompilation pipeline. SPARO analyzes algorithm-specific bottlenecks arising\nfrom constraints such as limited routing areas or magic-state factory\nthroughput. SPARO then dynamically allocates available hardware resources,\nbalancing compute, routing, and magic-state distillation, to minimize\nspace-time overhead and logical error rates for specific workloads. Our\nsimulations demonstrate that SPARO effectively identifies critical resource\ntrade-offs. When evaluated on benchmark circuits, SPARO identifies resource\nconfigurations achieving up to 51.11% logical error rate reductions for\n433-qubit ADDER circuits when compared to state-of-the-art static layouts using\nan identical total resource budget. This dynamic approach enables effective\nco-optimization of PBC execution and surface-code architectures, significantly\nimproving overall resource efficiency. SPARO will be open sourced.",

When a planet crosses a spot during\ntransit, it creates a distinctive change in the light curve that directly\nreveals spot properties. Our model integrates planetary transit modeling with\nstellar variability analysis by combining the spherical harmonic surface map\nrepresentation from starry, the probabilistic approach to spot properties of\nStarryProcess, and a comprehensive transit model that accounts for\nspot-crossing events during transits. We demonstrate through synthetic data\nexperiments that our model successfully recovers spot distributions, stellar\norientation, and spot physical properties. We extend the framework to handle\nevolving stellar surfaces through time-dependent modeling. Applying our method\nto TESS observations of TOI-3884, we find evidence for high-latitude spot\nconcentrations and significant spin-orbit misalignment. The transit-based\napproach overcomes fundamental limitations of previous models by providing\nconstraints on spot properties that would remain hidden in the null space of\nrotational light curves alone.

Trust in government and perceived risks significantly predict\npreferences for both soft (e.g., slowing development) and strong (e.g., banning\nAI systems) regulatory interventions. These results highlight the importance of\npublic opinion in AI governance. As AI capabilities advance, effective\nregulation will require balancing public concerns about risks with trust in\ninstitutions. This study provides a foundational empirical baseline for\npolicymakers navigating AI governance and underscores the need for further\nresearch into public trust, risk perception, and regulatory strategies in the\nevolving AI landscape.",

For\nthis, we introduce a novel method for extracting soft scores from the\nchain-of-thought (CoT) outputs from reasoning that enables fine-grained ranking\nof candidates. Our central hypothesis is that reasoning models are more\neffective discriminators than non-reasoning LLMs. Our results show that\ndistilled DeepSeek-R1-1.5B achieves up to $87\\%$ higher F1 and $3.7\\%$ better\ndiscrimination accuracy than CodeLlama-7B, as well as $3.7\\%$ higher execution\naccuracy than CodeLlama-13B, despite having significantly fewer parameters.\nFurthermore, we find that there is a limit to the logical capabilities of\nreasoning models, and only providing more context or allowing more compute\nbudget for reasoning is not enough to improve their discrimination performance.\nFinally, we demonstrate that, unlike non-reasoning LLMs, reasoning models find\ngeneration more challenging than discrimination and may underperform as\ngenerators compared to smaller non-reasoning LLMs. Our work highlights the\npotential of reasoning models as discriminators in agentic frameworks, far\noutweighing their capabilities as generators, offering insights into their\noptimal role within LLM planning infrastructures.",

We\nfurther characterised the orbital properties of the star by integrating its\norbit and analysing its integrals of motion using the galpy code. Results. The\nstar BPM 3066 shows an exceptional overabundance of both lithium and beryllium.\nThe abundances are A(Li) = 3.0 and A(Be) = 2.1, which are respectively about\n0.8 and 2.2 dex higher than the Li and Be abundances expected at [Fe/H] = -1.5,\nthe metallicity of the star.

Overabundances of\nSi, Al, and of the neutron capture elements Sr,Y, Zr, and Ba are also measured.\nKinematically, BPM 3066 has an eccentric, strongly retrograde orbit, confined\nto a height lower than 1 kpc from the galactic plane, and it is a candidate\nmember of the Sequoia/Thamnos accreted galaxy. Conclusions. The processes\nleading to the 7Li and 9Be synthesis could have occurred in the environment of\na hypernova. This is supported by some abundance anomalies like the high value\nof Si, [Si/Fe]=1.2 and [Si/O]=1.1. However, the simultaneous high values of N,\nNa, Al, Sc, Ti, and Cu are at odds with the expectations from a hypernova.\nAlternatively, the abundances of BPM 3066 could result from the engulfing of\nrocky planets that were rich in spallated Li and Be.

    "abstract": "The collision of two neutron stars is a rich source of information about\nnuclear physics. In particular, the kilonova signal following a merger can help\nus elucidate the role of neutron stars in nucleosynthesis, and informs us about\nthe properties of matter above nuclear saturation. Approximate modeling of\nneutrinos remains an important limitation to our ability to make predictions\nfor these observables. Part of the problem is the fermionic nature of\nneutrinos. By the exclusion principle, the expected value $f_\\nu$ for the\nnumber of neutrinos in a quantum state is at most 1. Any process producing\nneutrinos is suppressed by a blocking factor $(1-f_\\nu)$. Recent simulations\nfocused on neutrino physics mostly use a gray two-moment scheme to evolve\nneutrinos. This evolves integrals of $f_\\nu$ over momentum space, preventing\ndirect calculations of blocking factors. Monte Carlo methods may be an\nattractive alternative, providing access to the full distribution of neutrinos.\nTheir current implementation is however inadequate to estimate $f_\\nu$: in our\nmost recent simulations, a single Monte Carlo packet causes, in the worst\ncases, estimates of $f_\\nu$ to jump from $f_\\nu=0$ to $f_\\nu\\sim 10^5$. While\nthis is concerning, this brazen violation of the fermionic nature of neutrinos\nhas been largely inconsequential as the interactions used in simulations avoid\ndirect calculations of $f_\\nu$. We are however reaching a level of modeling at\nwhich this problem can no longer be ignored. Here, we discuss the relatively\nsimple origin of this issue. We then show that very rough estimates of $f_\\nu$\ncan in theory be obtained in merger simulations, but that they will require a\ncombination of unintuitive weighting schemes for Monte Carlo packets and\nsmoothing of the neutrino distribution at coarser resolution than what the\nmerger simulation uses.",

We release a Python-based graphical user\ninterface that supports a quantitative estimation of the investigated\ntemperature profiles based on the geometrical parameters (width/length) of the\ndeposited transducer (heater/thermometer metal line) before an experiment,\nguaranteeing an optimal design of the experimental conditions for each given\nmaterial under scrutiny.",

Fortunately, recent GPT-4o\nimage generation of OpenAI has achieved impressive cross-modality generation,\nediting, and design capabilities, which motivates us to answer the above\nquestion by exploring its potential in image compression fields. In this work,\nwe investigate two typical compression paradigms: textual coding and multimodal\ncoding (i.e., text + extremely low-resolution image), where all/most\npixel-level information is generated instead of compressing via the advanced\nGPT-4o image generation function. The essential challenge lies in how to\nmaintain semantic and structure consistency during the decoding process. To\novercome this, we propose a structure raster-scan prompt engineering mechanism\nto transform the image into textual space, which is compressed as the condition\nof GPT-4o image generation. Extensive experiments have shown that the\ncombination of our designed structural raster-scan prompts and GPT-4o's image\ngeneration function achieved the impressive performance compared with recent\nmultimodal/generative image compression at ultra-low bitrate, further\nindicating the potential of AIGC generation in image compression fields.",

    "abstract": "Binary code analysis plays a pivotal role in the field of software security\nand is widely used in tasks such as software maintenance, malware detection,\nsoftware vulnerability discovery, patch analysis, etc. However, unlike source\ncode, reverse engineers face significant challenges in understanding binary\ncode due to the lack of intuitive semantic information. Although traditional\nreverse tools can convert binary code into C-like pseudo code, the lack of code\ncomments and symbolic information such as function names still makes code\nunderstanding difficult. In recent years, two groups of techniques have shown\npromising prospects: (1) Deep learning-based techniques have demonstrated\ncompetitive results in tasks related to binary code understanding, furthermore,\n(2) Large Language Models (LLMs) have been extensively pre-trained at the\nsource-code level for tasks such as code understanding and generation. This has\nleft participants wondering about the capabilities of LLMs in binary code\nunderstanding. To this end, this work proposes a benchmark to evaluate the\neffectiveness of LLMs in real-world reverse engineering scenarios, which covers\ntwo key binary code understanding tasks, i.e., function name recovery and\nbinary code summarization. To more comprehensively evaluate, we include\nbinaries with multiple target architectures as well as different optimization\noptions. We gain valuable insights into the capabilities and limitations\nthrough extensive empirical studies of popular LLMs using our benchmark. Our\nevaluations reveal that existing LLMs can understand binary code to a certain\nextent, thereby improving the efficiency of binary code analysis. Our results\nhighlight the great potential of the LLMs in advancing the field of binary code\nunderstanding, and provide new directions for binary code analysis techniques.",

Neural network-based HPs offer greater flexibility, resulting in\nimproved fit and prediction performance, but at the cost of interpretability,\nwhich is often critical in healthcare. In this work, we aim to understand and\nimprove upon this tradeoff. We propose a novel HP formulation in which impact\nfunctions are modeled by defining a flexible impact kernel, instantiated as a\nneural network, in event embedding space, which allows us to model large-scale\nevent sequences with many event types. This approach is more flexible than\ntraditional HPs yet more interpretable than other neural network approaches,\nand allows us to explicitly trade flexibility for interpretability by adding\ntransformer encoder layers to further contextualize the event embeddings.\nResults show that our method accurately recovers impact functions in\nsimulations, achieves competitive performance on MIMIC-IV procedure dataset,\nand gains clinically meaningful interpretation on Duke-EHR with children\ndiagnosis dataset even without transformer layers. This suggests that our\nflexible impact kernel is often sufficient to capture self-reinforcing dynamics\nin EHRs and other data effectively, implying that interpretability can be\nmaintained without loss of performance.",

As a result, apparent detections of\ntrace gases risk being artifacts of incomplete modeling rather than robust\nidentification of atmospheric constituents, especially in the low\nsignal-to-noise regime. We illustrate these challenges using the sub-Neptune\nK2-18~b, where recent claims of a potential biosignature detection vanish when\nthe considered model space is expanded. We show that numerous alternative\nmodels without potential biosignature gases provide equivalent or better fits\nto the observations.

While optimal expected risk bounds are known, high-probability\nguarantees remain less well-understood. First, we analyze the classical Laplace\n(add-one) estimator, obtaining matching upper and lower bounds on its\nperformance and showing its optimality among confidence-independent estimators.\nWe then characterize the minimax-optimal high-probability risk, which is\nattained via a simple confidence-dependent smoothing technique. Interestingly,\nthe optimal non-asymptotic risk exhibits an additional logarithmic factor over\nthe ideal asymptotic risk. Next, motivated by scenarios where the alphabet\nexceeds the sample size, we investigate methods that adapt to the sparsity of\nthe distribution at hand. We introduce an estimator using data-dependent\nsmoothing, for which we establish a high-probability risk bound depending on\ntwo effective sparsity parameters.

In this work, we\nintroduce the concept of ``on-grid correction'' and derive the formulas for the\nleast squares approximation of Gaussian wave-packets, and also provide a\ndetailed process of the FGGC algorithm. Furthermore, we rigorously prove that\nthe error introduced by the least squares approximation on each Gaussian\nwave-packet is independent of the semi-classical parameter $\\varepsilon$.\nNumerical experiments show that the FGGC algorithm can significantly improve\nreconstruction efficiency while introducing only negligible error, making it a\npowerful tool for solving the semi-classical Schr\\\"odinger equation, especially\nin applications requiring both accuracy and efficiency.",

Meanwhile, from the perspective of generalization, they do not\nconsider the gap between local and global Pareto fronts on the global dataset.\nTo address these limitations, we propose HetPFL to effectively learn both local\nand global Pareto fronts. HetPFL comprises Preference Sampling Adaptation (PSA)\nand Preference-aware Hypernet Fusion (PHF). PSA adaptively determines the\noptimal preference sampling distribution for each client to accommodate\nheterogeneous local Pareto fronts. While PHF performs preference-aware fusion\nof clients' hypernets to ensure the performance of the global Pareto front. We\nprove that HetPFL converges linearly with respect to the number of rounds,\nunder weaker assumptions than existing methods. Extensive experiments on four\ndatasets show that HetPFL significantly outperforms seven baselines in terms of\nthe quality of learned local and global Pareto fronts.",

Imitation Learning (IL) is a prominent approach,\nwhere agents learn to control robots based on human demonstrations. However, IL\ncommonly suffers from violating the independent and identically distributed\n(i.i.d) assumption in robotic tasks. Interactive Imitation Learning (IIL)\nachieves improved performance by allowing agents to learn from interactive\nfeedback from human teachers. Despite these improvements, both approaches come\nwith significant costs due to the necessity of human involvement. Leveraging\nthe emergent capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in reasoning and\ngenerating human-like responses, we introduce LLM-iTeach -- a novel IIL\nframework that utilizes an LLM as an interactive teacher to enhance agent\nperformance while alleviating the dependence on human resources. Firstly,\nLLM-iTeach uses a hierarchical prompting strategy that guides the LLM in\ngenerating a policy in Python code. Then, with a designed similarity-based\nfeedback mechanism, LLM-iTeach provides corrective and evaluative feedback\ninteractively during the agent's training. We evaluate LLM-iTeach against\nbaseline methods such as Behavior Cloning (BC), an IL method, and CEILing, a\nstate-of-the-art IIL method using a human teacher, on various robotic\nmanipulation tasks. Our results demonstrate that LLM-iTeach surpasses BC in the\nsuccess rate and achieves or even outscores that of CEILing, highlighting the\npotential of LLMs as cost-effective, human-like teachers in interactive\nlearning environments.

    "abstract": "In an era when we are charting multiple planets per system, one might wonder\nthe extent to which \"missing\" (or failing to detect) a planet can skew our\ninterpretation of the system architecture. We address this question with a\nsimple experiment: starting from a large, homogeneous catalog, we remove\nplanets and monitor how several well-defined metrics of the system architecture\nchange. We first perform this test on a catalog of observed exoplanets. We then\nrepeat our test on a catalog of synthetic planetary systems with underlying\nhyperparameters that have been fit to reproduce the observed systems as\nfaithfully as possible (though imperfectly). For both samples, we find that the\nfailure to detect one or more planets tends to create more irregularly spaced\nplanets, whereas the planet mass similarity and coplanarity are essentially\nunaffected. One key difference between the synthetic and observed data sets is\nthat the observed systems have more evenly spaced planets than the\nobservation-bias-applied synthetic systems. Since our tests show that detection\nbias tends to increase irregularity in spacing, the even spacing in the\nobserved planetary systems is likely astrophysical rather than the result of\nthe Kepler missions' inherent detection biases. Our findings support the\ninterpretation that planets in the same system have similar sizes and regular\nspacing and reinforce the need to develop an underlying model of planetary\narchitectures that reproduces these observed patterns.",

    "abstract": "The Mpemba effect -- where hot systems cool faster than colder ones -- has\nintrigued both classical and quantum thermodynamics. As compared to classical\nsystems, quantum systems add complexity due to quantum correlations. Recent\nworks have explored anomalous relaxation and Mpemba-like effects in several\nquantum systems, considering isolated systems at zero temperature or open\nsystems in contact with reservoirs under Markovian or non-Markovian dynamics.\nHowever, these models typically assume an initial unentangled system-bath\nstate, overlooking the role of initial system-environment correlations. Here we\npropose a type of quantum Mpemba effect, distinct from the strong Mpemba\neffect, originating from initial system-bath entanglement solely. It is shown\nthat the degree of initial entanglement significantly influences the early\nrelaxation dynamics, with certain conditions causing backflow and retarded\nthermalization. As an example, we investigate the spontaneous emission of a\ntwo-level atom in a photonic waveguide at zero temperature, where an initial\natom-photon entangled state results in delayed relaxation and pronounced Mpemba\neffect. These findings highlight the crucial role of quantum correlations in\nthermalization processes and open new avenues for identifying and engineering\nquantum Mpemba phenomena. Controlling relaxation dynamics through\nsystem-environment entanglement may have potential applications in quantum\nthermal machines, state initialization protocols, and quantum information\nprocessing, where precise control over thermalization is essential.",

The background spacetime is modelled as a spherically symmetric solution\nto the Einstein field equations, where the effect of the fluid on the geometry\nis treated as a perturbation on the Schwarzschild background. The equation of\nstate for the fluid is assumed to follow the linear relationship $p = w \\rho$,\nwhere $p$ is the pressure, $\\rho$ is the energy density with $w$ being a\nconstant. The stress-energy tensor is treated as a phenomenological model to\ncapture deviations from the vacuum Einstein theory. We allow the parameter $w$\nof the equation of state to take both positive and negative values accepting a\nbroad range of scenarios including exotic ones. Specifically, we examine the\ncases $w =2/3$, $1/3$, $-3/4$ and $-4/3$. For $\\rho\\geq0$, the former two cases\nsatisfy all standard energy conditions while the case of $w=-3/4$ violates the\nstrong energy condition and the case of $w=-4/3$ violates all standard energy\nconditions.

    "abstract": "3D morphable models (3DMMs) are a powerful tool to represent the possible\nshapes and appearances of an object category. Given a single test image, 3DMMs\ncan be used to solve various tasks, such as predicting the 3D shape, pose,\nsemantic correspondence, and instance segmentation of an object. Unfortunately,\n3DMMs are only available for very few object categories that are of particular\ninterest, like faces or human bodies, as they require a demanding 3D data\nacquisition and category-specific training process. In contrast, we introduce a\nnew method, Common3D, that learns 3DMMs of common objects in a fully\nself-supervised manner from a collection of object-centric videos. For this\npurpose, our model represents objects as a learned 3D template mesh and a\ndeformation field that is parameterized as an image-conditioned neural network.\nDifferent from prior works, Common3D represents the object appearance with\nneural features instead of RGB colors, which enables the learning of more\ngeneralizable representations through an abstraction from pixel intensities.\nImportantly, we train the appearance features using a contrastive objective by\nexploiting the correspondences defined through the deformable template mesh.\nThis leads to higher quality correspondence features compared to related works\nand a significantly improved model performance at estimating 3D object pose and\nsemantic correspondence. Common3D is the first completely self-supervised\nmethod that can solve various vision tasks in a zero-shot manner.",

To address this issue, we develop a framework\nfor analyzing classical capacities of quantum channels where the set of states\nused for encoding information is restricted based on various physical\nproperties. Specifically, we provide expressions for the classical capacities\nof noiseless and noisy quantum channels when the average energy of the encoded\nensemble or the energy of each of the constituent states in the ensemble is\nbounded. In the case of qubit energy-preserving dephasing channels, we\ndemonstrate that a nonuniform probability distribution based on the energy\nconstraint maximizes capacity, while we derive the compact form of the capacity\nfor equiprobable messages. We suggest an energy-constrained dense coding (DC)\nprotocol that we prove to be optimal in the two-qubit situation and obtain a\nclosed-form expression for the DC capacity. Additionally, we demonstrate a\nno-go result, which states that when the dimension of the sender and the\nreceiver is two, no energy-preserving operation can offer any quantum advantage\nfor energy-constrained entanglement-assisted capacity.

However, achieving\nsufficiently high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) EO combs for use across the broad\nrange of wavelengths required in the aforementioned applications is hindered by\nthe corresponding unavailability of relevant components such as\nnarrow-linewidth lasers, electro-optic phase modulators with adequate optical\npower handling, and low-noise optical amplifiers. Here, we address the latter\ntwo points by showing that optical injection locking of commercial Fabry-Perot\n(FP) laser diodes can help enable high SNR EO combs. We injection lock the FP\nlaser diode to more than 10^6 comb teeth at injected comb powers as low as 1 nW\nand produce a high SNR replica of the EO comb. In comparison to a commercial\nsemiconductor optical amplifier, injection locking achieves approximately 100x\ngreater SNR for the same input power (when <1 microwatt) and equal SNR for >\n35x lower input power. Such low-power injection locking is of particular\nrelevance in conjunction with nanophotonic spectral translation, which extends\nthe range of wavelengths available for EO combs. We show that the usable\nwavelength range of an EO comb produced by photo-induced second harmonic\ngeneration of an EO comb in a silicon nitride resonator is significantly\nincreased when combined with optical injection locking.

We instead consider the\nsetting where the parameters are stochastic: each shot of the quantum-sensing\nprotocol senses parameter values that come from independent random draws. In\nthis work, we explore three examples where the stochastic parameters are\ncorrelated and show how using entanglement provides a benefit in classification\nor estimation tasks: (1) a two-parameter classification task, for which there\nis an advantage in the low-shot regime; (2) an $N$-parameter estimation task\nand a classification variant of it, for which an entangled sensor requires just\na constant number (independent of $N$) shots to achieve the same accuracy as an\nunentangled sensor using exponentially many (${\\sim}2^N$) shots; (3)\nclassifying the magnetization of a spin chain in thermal equilibrium, where the\nindividual spins fluctuate but the total spin in one direction is conserved -\nthis gives a practical setting in which stochastic parameters are correlated in\na way that an entangled sensor can be designed to exploit. We also present a\ntheoretical framework for assessing, for a given choice of entangled sensing\nprotocol and distributions to discriminate between, how much advantage the\nentangled sensor would have over an unentangled sensor. Our work motivates the\nfurther study of sensing correlated stochastic parameters using entangled\nquantum sensors - and since classical sensors by definition cannot be\nentangled, our work shows the possibility for entangled quantum sensors to\nachieve an exponential advantage over classical sensors, in contrast to the\ntypical quadratic advantage.",

(1)\nObjective: to propose and explore a novel method for assessing OSA severity\nconsidering potential connection to cardiac arrhythmias. (2) Method: the\napproach utilizes cross-recurrence features to characterize OSA and AF by\nconsidering the relationships among oxygen desaturation, pulse arrival time,\nand heart-beat intervals. Multinomial logistic regression models were trained\nto predict four levels of OSA severity and four groups related to heart rhythm\nissues.

    "abstract": "Massage therapy training emphasizes hands-on techniques and effective\ntherapist--patient communication. However, many educational programs struggle\nto provide realistic practice scenarios. To address this problem, we propose\nTheraQuest, a gamified, web-based simulation platform that employs large\nlanguage models (LLMs) to generate diverse virtual patients with varying\nsymptoms and cultural backgrounds. Through interactive dialogue, anatomical\ndecision-making, and immediate assessment, trainees develop both diagnostic\nreasoning and empathetic communication skills in a low-risk environment. Unlike\nexclusively VR-based solutions, TheraQuest remains accessible via standard web\nbrowsers, mitigating the cost and discomfort associated with extended headset\nuse. Preliminary testing suggests that integrating LLM-driven virtual patients\nwith real-time skill metrics can enhance trainee engagement and help bridge the\ngap between theoretical knowledge and clinical proficiency.",

    "abstract": "Heavy-ion collision experiments such as the Large Hadron Collider and the\nRelativistic Heavy Ion Collider offer a unique platform to study several key\nproperties of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP), a deconfined state of strongly\ninteracting matter. Quarks, being the electrically charged particles, can\ninduce an electric current in the medium in response to the temperature\ngradients. Hence, the QGP medium can behave like a thermoelectric medium. The\nthermoelectric coefficients, such as the Seebeck and Thomson coefficients, can\nhelp us to understand the intricate transport phenomenon of the medium. In\nperipheral collisions, the intense, transient, and time-dependent magnetic\nfield created due to spectator protons significantly influences the\nthermoelectric properties of the QGP medium, affecting the charge and heat\ntransport. This work uses the quasi-particle model to calculate the Thomson\ncoefficient in QGP. The Thomson effect, describing the continuous heating or\ncooling of the charge-carrying medium in the presence of temperature gradients,\nremains largely unexplored in QGP. The Seebeck effect, which relates\ntemperature gradients to induced electric fields, has been widely studied in\nthe literature. For the first time, we calculate the magneto-Thomson and\ntransverse Thomson coefficients. We have studied their dependence on\ntemperature, baryon chemical potential, center of mass energy, and\ntime-dependent magnetic field with different decay parameters. The transverse\nThomson effect originates due to the presence of the Nernst effect in the\npresence of a magnetic field. Our results provide new insights into the\nhigher-order thermoelectric transport properties of the QGP medium in the\ncontext of heavy-ion collisions.",

Specifically, we compare newly synthesized homologs\nwith a nitro group, which predominantly exhibit polar mesophases, to previously\nreported structurally related analogs containing either a cyano group or a\nfluorine atom as terminal fragment. Density Functional Theory (DFT)\ncalculations provide insights into electronic surface potential (ESP)\ndistributions, revealing alternating regions of positive and negative charge\ndensity along the molecular axis, consistent with Madhusudana model of polar\nphase stabilization. We propose the ESP-derived parameter quantifying terminal\nelectrostatic charge, revealing a direct correlation between the negative to\npositive charge ratio at the molecular termini and the formation of\nferroelectric or antiferroelectric mesophases. To validate this hypothesis, we\nanalyze the molecular structure-mesomorphic behavior relationship of other\nknown non-chiral compounds that exhibit polar phases, demonstrating the\ncritical role of terminal groups in determining mesophase polarity.

    "abstract": "Multiple recent studies have documented large language models' (LLMs)\nperformance on calling external tools/functions. Others focused on LLMs'\nabilities to handle longer context lengths. At the intersection of these areas\nlies another interesting problem: LLMs' abilities to accurately perform\nfunction calls in long context settings. Particularly, when calling tools, LLMs\nare encumbered by three predominant challenges: (1) a large catalog of tools,\n(2) long responses from the tool APIs, and (3) long multi-turn conversations.\nThese challenges are particularly relevant to enterprise applications of LLMs\nwhich engage in multi-turn conversations with users to complete complex tasks\nthat require a large catalog of complex tools. The literature contains multiple\ninvestigations of long context challenges such as lost in the middle or needle\nin the haystack for natural language tasks. In this paper, we make the first\nattempt to comprehensively study the long context understanding capabilities of\nthese models in the tool calling setup. We modify existing benchmarks for\nchallenge 1 and 3, and create a new evaluation set for challenge 2 to enable\nthis analysis. We gradually increase the input context length and also vary the\nposition of the answer in the input. When evaluated with several long context\nmodels, we observe a performance drop of 7% to 85% as the number of tools\nincreases, a 7% to 91% degradation in answer retrieval as the tool responses\nlength increases, and 13% and 40% degradation for as multi-turn conversations\nget longer. Our study shows that LLMs still struggle with long context in tool\ncalling settings, motivating future research to drive further LLM improvements.",

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where an\nattacker manipulates a small portion of the training data to implant hidden\nbackdoors into the model. The compromised model behaves normally on clean\nsamples but misclassifies backdoored samples into the attacker-specified target\nclass, posing a significant threat to real-world DNN applications. Currently,\nseveral empirical defense methods have been proposed to mitigate backdoor\nattacks, but they are often bypassed by more advanced backdoor techniques. In\ncontrast, certified defenses based on randomized smoothing have shown promise\nby adding random noise to training and testing samples to counteract backdoor\nattacks. In this paper, we reveal that existing randomized smoothing defenses\nimplicitly assume that all samples are equidistant from the decision boundary.\nHowever, it may not hold in practice, leading to suboptimal certification\nperformance. To address this issue, we propose a sample-specific certified\nbackdoor defense method, termed Cert-SSB. Cert-SSB first employs stochastic\ngradient ascent to optimize the noise magnitude for each sample, ensuring a\nsample-specific noise level that is then applied to multiple poisoned training\nsets to retrain several smoothed models. After that, Cert-SSB aggregates the\npredictions of multiple smoothed models to generate the final robust\nprediction. In particular, in this case, existing certification methods become\ninapplicable since the optimized noise varies across different samples. To\nconquer this challenge, we introduce a storage-update-based certification\nmethod, which dynamically adjusts each sample's certification region to improve\ncertification performance. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple\nbenchmark datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed method. Our\ncode is available at https://github.com/NcepuQiaoTing/Cert-SSB.",

    "abstract": "Backpressure (BP) routing and scheduling is a well-established resource\nallocation method for wireless multi-hop networks, known for its fully\ndistributed operations and proven maximum queue stability. Recent advances in\nshortest path-biased BP routing (SP-BP) mitigate shortcomings such as slow\nstartup and random walk, but exclusive link-level commodity selection still\nsuffers from the last-packet problem and bandwidth underutilization. Moreover,\nclassic BP routing implicitly assumes single-input-single-output (SISO)\ntransceivers, which can lead to the same packets being scheduled on multiple\noutgoing links for multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) transceivers, causing\ndetouring and looping in MIMO networks. In this paper, we revisit the\nfoundational Lyapunov drift theory underlying BP routing and demonstrate that\nexclusive commodity selection is unnecessary, and instead propose a Max-Utility\nlink-sharing method. Additionally, we generalize MaxWeight scheduling to MIMO\nnetworks by introducing attributed capacity hypergraphs (ACH), an extension of\ntraditional conflict graphs for SISO networks, and by incorporating backlog\nreassignment into scheduling iterations to prevent redundant packet routing.\nNumerical evaluations show that our approach substantially mitigates the\nlast-packet problem in state-of-the-art (SOTA) SP-BP under lightweight traffic,\nand slightly expands the network capacity region for heavier traffic.",

Previous studies mainly focus on the direct\nshort-term production of listener behavior.

Moreover, the lack of long-term and large-scale paired\nspeaker-listener corpora including head dynamics and fine-grained\nmulti-modality annotations (e.g., text-based expression descriptions, emotional\nintensity) also limits the application of dialogue modeling.Therefore, we first\nnewly collect a large-scale multi-turn dataset of 3D dyadic conversation\ncontaining more than 1.4M valid frames for multi-modal responsive interaction,\ndubbed ListenerX. Additionally, we propose VividListener, a novel framework\nenabling fine-grained, expressive and controllable listener dynamics modeling.\nThis framework leverages multi-modal conditions as guiding principles for\nfostering coherent interactions between speakers and listeners.Specifically, we\ndesign the Responsive Interaction Module (RIM) to adaptively represent the\nmulti-modal interactive embeddings.

In this work, we give a further step by\nshowing that, under certain common and general conditions, the heat engine\nregime can be characterized by the minima of power fluctuations and entropy\nproduction, which together delimit its optimal performance, achieved when these\nconditions are fully satisfied. Conversely, when these conditions are not\nstrictly met, the occurrence of the minimum still approximately describes the\nsystem, suggesting a broader range of applicability. Contrasting with most of\nstudies in which the system optimization is carried out solely taking into\naccount the power and efficiency, we introduce a multi-objective optimization\nframework based on Pareto fronts, also considering the role of fluctuation and\ndissipation. Our results reveal a general trend: while simultaneous\noptimization over a few parameters typically yields convex Pareto fronts, these\nfronts become concave as more parameters are varied freely and non-conservative\ndriving becomes significant.

Our\nresearch identifies three main types of gaming strategies that exploit the\nsystem's weaknesses, potentially leading to false positives. To counteract\nthese vulnerabilities, we implement several adversarial training methods\ndesigned to enhance the systems' robustness. Our results indicate that these\nmethods significantly reduce the susceptibility of grading systems to such\nmanipulations, especially when combined with ensemble techniques like majority\nvoting and ridge regression, which further improve the system's defense against\nsophisticated adversarial inputs. Additionally, employing large language models\nsuch as GPT-4 with varied prompting techniques has shown promise in recognizing\nand scoring gaming strategies effectively.

    "abstract": "Ego-motion estimation is vital for drones when flying in GPS-denied\nenvironments. Vision-based methods struggle when flight speed increases and\nclose-by objects lead to difficult visual conditions with considerable motion\nblur and large occlusions. To tackle this, vision is typically complemented by\nstate estimation filters that combine a drone model with inertial measurements.\nHowever, these drone models are currently learned in a supervised manner with\nground-truth data from external motion capture systems, limiting scalability to\ndifferent environments and drones. In this work, we propose a self-supervised\nlearning scheme to train a neural-network-based drone model using only onboard\nmonocular video and flight controller data (IMU and motor feedback). We achieve\nthis by first training a self-supervised relative pose estimation model, which\nthen serves as a teacher for the drone model. To allow this to work at high\nspeed close to obstacles, we propose an improved occlusion handling method for\ntraining self-supervised pose estimation models. Due to this method, the root\nmean squared error of resulting odometry estimates is reduced by an average of\n15%. Moreover, the student neural drone model can be successfully obtained from\nthe onboard data. It even becomes more accurate at higher speeds compared to\nits teacher, the self-supervised vision-based model. We demonstrate the value\nof the neural drone model by integrating it into a traditional filter-based VIO\nsystem (ROVIO), resulting in superior odometry accuracy on aggressive 3D racing\ntrajectories near obstacles. Self-supervised learning of ego-motion estimation\nrepresents a significant step toward bridging the gap between flying in\ncontrolled, expensive lab environments and real-world drone applications. The\nfusion of vision and drone models will enable higher-speed flight and improve\nstate estimation, on any drone in any environment.",

AT2022wtn shows spectroscopic and photometric\nproperties consistent with a X-ray faint N-strong TDE-H+He with a number of\npeculiarities. Specifically, a 30-days long plateau at maximum luminosity, a\ncorresponding dip in temperature and the development of a double-horned N III+\nHe II line profile. Strong and time-evolving velocity offsets in the TDE broad\nemission lines and the detection of a transient radio emission, indicate the\npresence of outflows. Overall, the observed properties are consistent with the\nfull disruption of a low-mass star by a ~10$^{6}$ M$_{\\odot}$ SMBH followed by\nan efficient disk formation and the launch of a quasi-spherical reprocessing\nenvelope of fast expanding outflowing material.

    "abstract": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) integrates Large Language Models (LLMs)\nwith external knowledge bases, improving output quality while introducing new\nsecurity risks. Existing studies on RAG vulnerabilities typically focus on\nexploiting the retrieval mechanism to inject erroneous knowledge or malicious\ntexts, inducing incorrect outputs. However, these approaches overlook critical\nweaknesses within LLMs, leaving important attack vectors unexplored and\nlimiting the scope and efficiency of attacks. In this paper, we uncover a novel\nvulnerability: the safety guardrails of LLMs, while designed for protection,\ncan also be exploited as an attack vector by adversaries. Building on this\nvulnerability, we propose MutedRAG, a novel denial-of-service attack that\nreversely leverages the guardrails of LLMs to undermine the availability of RAG\nsystems. By injecting minimalistic jailbreak texts, such as \"\\textit{How to\nbuild a bomb}\", into the knowledge base, MutedRAG intentionally triggers the\nLLM's safety guardrails, causing the system to reject legitimate queries.\nBesides, due to the high sensitivity of guardrails, a single jailbreak sample\ncan affect multiple queries, effectively amplifying the efficiency of attacks\nwhile reducing their costs. Experimental results on three datasets demonstrate\nthat MutedRAG achieves an attack success rate exceeding 60% in many scenarios,\nrequiring only less than one malicious text to each target query on average. In\naddition, we evaluate potential defense strategies against MutedRAG, finding\nthat some of current mechanisms are insufficient to mitigate this threat,\nunderscoring the urgent need for more robust solutions.",

Recently, Bloch-type magnetic skyrmions stabilized by\ncomposition gradient-induced DMI (g-DMI) have been observed in 10-nm thick CoPt\nsingle layer. However, magnetic anisotropy in gradient-composition engineered\nCoPt (g-CoPt) films is highly sensitive to both the relative Co/Pt composition\nand the film thickness, leading to a complex interplay with g-DMI. The\nstability of skyrmions under the combined influence of magnetic anisotropy and\ng-DMI is crucial yet remains poorly understood. Here, we conduct a systematic\nstudy on the characteristics of magnetic skyrmions as a function of gradient\npolarity and effective gradient (defined as gradient/thickness) in g-CoPt\nsingle layers (thickness of 10-30 nm) using magnetic force microscopy (MFM),\nbulk magnetometry, and topological Hall effect measurements. Brillouin light\nscattering spectroscopy confirms that both the sign and magnitude of g-DMI\ndepend on the polarity and amplitude of the composition gradient in g-CoPt\nfilms. MFM reveals that skyrmion size and density vary with g-CoPt film\nthickness, gradient polarity, and applied magnetic field.

Our method can\ndramatically suppress the estimator variance, achieving saturation in the\nlow-temperature regime. Numerical benchmarks on the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick\nspin glass and the 3-SAT problem demonstrate that our protocol reduces scaling\nexponents by over an order of magnitude (e.g., from ~8.5 to ~0.5), despite\nretaining exponential system-size dependences. Crucially, our protocol\ncircumvents stringent adiabatic constraints, making it feasible for near-term\nquantum devices like superconducting qubits, trapped ions, and Rydberg atom\narrays. This work bridges quantum dynamics with computational complexity,\noffering a practical pathway to quantum advantage in spin glass thermodynamics\nand beyond.",

    "abstract": "Recently, long-thought reasoning models achieve strong performance on complex\nreasoning tasks, but often incur substantial inference overhead, making\nefficiency a critical concern. Our empirical analysis reveals that the benefit\nof using Long-CoT varies across problems: while some problems require elaborate\nreasoning, others show no improvement, or even degraded accuracy. This\nmotivates adaptive reasoning strategies that tailor reasoning depth to the\ninput. However, prior work primarily reduces redundancy within long reasoning\npaths, limiting exploration of more efficient strategies beyond the Long-CoT\nparadigm. To address this, we propose a novel two-stage framework for adaptive\nand efficient reasoning. First, we construct a hybrid reasoning model by\nmerging long and short CoT models to enable diverse reasoning styles. Second,\nwe apply bi-level preference training to guide the model to select suitable\nreasoning styles (group-level), and prefer concise and correct reasoning within\neach style group (instance-level). Experiments demonstrate that our method\n(Ada-R1) significantly reduces inference costs compared to other baseline\napproaches, while maintaining performance. Notably, on five mathematical\ndatasets, the average length of reasoning is reduced by more than 50%,\nhighlighting the potential of adaptive strategies to optimize reasoning\nefficiency in large language models.

    "abstract": "This Ph.D. thesis explores approximations and regularity for the Heston\nstochastic volatility model through three interconnected works.\n  The first work focuses on developing high-order weak approximations for the\nCox-Ingersoll-Ross (CIR) process, essential for financial modelling but\nchallenging due to the square root diffusion term preventing standard methods.\nBy employing the random grid technique (Alfonsi & Bally, 2021) built upon\nAlfonsi's (2010) second-order scheme, the work proves that weak approximations\nof any order can be achieved for smooth test functions. This holds under a\ncondition that is less restrictive than the famous Feller's one. Numerical\nresults confirm convergence for both CIR and Heston models and show significant\ncomputational time improvements.\n  The second work extends the random grid technique to the log-Heston process.\nTwo second-order schemes are introduced (one using exact volatility simulation,\nanother using Ninomiya-Victoir splitting under a the same restriction used\nabove). Convergence to any desired order is rigorously proven. Numerical\nexperiments validate the schemes' effectiveness for pricing European and Asian\noptions and suggest potential applicability to multifactor/rough Heston models.\n  The third work investigates the partial differential equation (PDE)\nassociated with the log-Heston model. It extends classical solution results and\nestablishes the existence and uniqueness of viscosity solutions without relying\non the Feller condition. Uniqueness is proven even for certain discontinuous\ninitial data, relevant for pricing instruments like digital options.\nFurthermore, the convergence of a hybrid numerical scheme to the viscosity\nsolution is shown under relaxed regularity (continuity) for the initial data.\n  An appendix includes supplementary results for the CIR process.",

Nonetheless, existing\ndiffusion models predominantly concentrate on modeling static 3D scenes or\nobject-level dynamics, constraining their capacity to provide truly immersive\nexperiences. To address this issue, we propose HoloTime, a framework that\nintegrates video diffusion models to generate panoramic videos from a single\nprompt or reference image, along with a 360-degree 4D scene reconstruction\nmethod that seamlessly transforms the generated panoramic video into 4D assets,\nenabling a fully immersive 4D experience for users. Specifically, to tame video\ndiffusion models for generating high-fidelity panoramic videos, we introduce\nthe 360World dataset, the first comprehensive collection of panoramic videos\nsuitable for downstream 4D scene reconstruction tasks. With this curated\ndataset, we propose Panoramic Animator, a two-stage image-to-video diffusion\nmodel that can convert panoramic images into high-quality panoramic videos.\nFollowing this, we present Panoramic Space-Time Reconstruction, which leverages\na space-time depth estimation method to transform the generated panoramic\nvideos into 4D point clouds, enabling the optimization of a holistic 4D\nGaussian Splatting representation to reconstruct spatially and temporally\nconsistent 4D scenes. To validate the efficacy of our method, we conducted a\ncomparative analysis with existing approaches, revealing its superiority in\nboth panoramic video generation and 4D scene reconstruction.

This noise is constructed from a L\\'evy white noise (which is in\nturn built from a Poisson random measure with intensity $dtdx \\nu(dz)$), using\nthe convolution with a suitable spatial kernel $\\kappa$. We assume that the\nL\\'evy measure $\\nu$ has finite variance.

We first analyze this question for\nthe linear SPDE, considering as examples the stochastic heat and wave equations\nin any dimension $d$, for three examples of kernels $\\kappa$: the heat kernel,\nthe Riesz kernel, and the Bessel kernel.

    "abstract": "The effect of neon seeding on different transport mechanisms in EAST is\ninvestigated by analyzing SOLPSITER simulations. By evaluating the agreement\nbetween experimental observations and the performed simulations, four\nsimulations are selected for a detailed analysis. In this analysis, it is shown\nthat the presence of neon reduces the influence of drifts on the simulated\nprofiles. In the simulation results, double peaked profiles/profiles with two\nvalleys are observed at the divertor targets which can be explained by the\nparallel drift velocities These drifts move particles from the outboard towards\nthe inboard side and, in that way, also increase the ionization sources at the\ninboard side. It is shown that Ne+ leaks towards the core making it difficult\nto perform experiments which contain as much neon as in the SOLPS-ITER\nsimulations. In fact, the level of neon in the experiments is limited by the HL\nbacktransition which takes place if higher order states of neon ionize in the\ncore and cause in that way too much core radiation. Furthermore, the analysis\nof the radiated power profiles suggests that the presence of other radiators\nbesides neon is important to bring the experiments into detachment. The\nionization of deuterium is the most important neutral reaction present in the\nsimulations. The amount of ionized deuterium is decreased when large amounts of\nneon are present and the anomalous transport is modified. Therefore, it is\nconcluded that for the analyzed simulations, neon increases the radiated power\nfraction, decreases the deuterium ionization, increases the neutral friction,\nbut does not manage to cause significant influence of deuterium recombination.\nAs a consequence, volumetric recombination only plays a minor role in the\nstudied simulations.",

We\ninvestigate how high-velocity stellar winds, magnetic fields, and\nmetallicity-dependent radiative cooling influence gas dynamics and black hole\naccretion in compact WR clusters. Using three-dimensional (magneto)hydrodynamic\nsimulations, we model each WR star as a source of mass, momentum, energy, and\nmagnetic flux, and include a cooling function that depends on chemical\nabundance. We compare isotropic versus disk-like stellar distributions to\nexplore the impact of cluster geometry. Across all models, we find that the\naccretion rate onto the IMBH is suppressed by up to five orders of magnitude\nrelative to the total stellar mass-loss rate. Turbulent, shock-heated outflows\ndriven by wind-wind collisions dominate the flow, expelling most injected gas.\nWhile enhanced cooling in high-metallicity runs promotes the formation of dense\nclumps, these structures are typically unable to reach the black hole.

As a corollary of this theorem, we show that\nthe index of primitivity of any primitive 2-positive map is at most $2(D-1)^2$,\nso in particular this bound holds for arbitrary primitive completely positive\nmaps. We briefly discuss of how this relates to a conjecture of Perez-Garcia,\nVerstraete, Wolf and Cirac.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this paper is twofold. First, we rigorously justify Koiter's\nmodel for linearly elastic elliptic membrane shells in the case where the shell\nis subject to a geometrical constraint modelled via a normal compliance contact\ncondition defined in the interior of the shell. To achieve this, we establish a\nnovel density result for non-empty, closed, and convex subsets of Lebesgue\nspaces, which are applicable to cases not covered by the ``density property''\nestablished in [Ciarlet, Mardare \\& Piersanti, \\emph{Math. Mech. Solids},\n2019].\n  Second, we demonstrate that the solution to the two-dimensional obstacle\nproblem for linearly elastic elliptic membrane shells, subjected to the\ninterior normal compliance contact condition, exhibits higher regularity\nthroughout its entire definition domain. A key feature of this result is that,\nwhile the transverse component of the solution is, in general, only of class\n$L^2$ and its trace is \\emph{a priori} undefined, the methodology proposed\nhere, partially based on [Ciarlet \\& Sanchez-Palencia, \\emph{J.

Underpinning the core steps of any quantum simulation\nalgorithm, fermion-qubit mappings translate the fermionic interactions to the\noperators and states of quantum computers. This translation is highly\nnon-trivial: a burgeoning supply of fermion-qubit mappings has arisen over the\npast twenty years to address the limited resources of early quantum technology.\nPrevious literature has presented a dichotomy between ancilla-free\nfermion-qubit mappings, which minimise qubit count, and local encodings, which\nminimise gate complexity.\n  We present two computational approaches to the construction of general\nmappings while working with a limited number of qubits, striking a balance\nbetween the low-qubit and low-gate demands of present quantum technology. The\nfirst method frames the order of fermionic labels as an instance of the\nquadratic assignment problem to minimize the total and maximum Pauli weights in\na problem Hamiltonian. We compare the order-optimized performance of several\ncommon ancilla-free mappings on systems of size up to 225 fermionic modes. The\nsecond method is a computational approach to incrementally add ancilla qubits\nto Jordan--Wigner transformations and further reduce the Pauli weights. By\nadding up to 10 ancilla qubits, we were able to reduce the total Pauli weight\nby as much as 67% in Jordan--Wigner transformations of fermionic systems with\nup to 64 modes, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art ancilla-free\nmappings.\n  Reproducibility: source code and data are available at\nhttps://github.com/cameton/QCE_QubitAssignment",

Firstly, we demonstrate a universal\ntendency towards half-filling of particle density at late times. At early times\nfor certain initial states, we observe a chiral wavefront in both particle\nnumber distribution and charge inflow, associated with a sharp decrease in\nparticle number. Furthermore, we find that non-Hermiticity could enhance the\ngrowth of entanglement in the initial stages of evolution. In the intermediate\ntime regime, the characteristic skin effect leads to particle accumulation on\none side, leading to a pronounced reduction in entanglement entropy.

    "abstract": "We investigate the interplay between superconducting correlations and trimer\nformation in polarized two-component Fermi gases confined to multileg\nattractive-$U$ Hubbard ladders. Employing density matrix renormalization group\n(DMRG) simulations, we explore the effects of spin-dependent tunneling\namplitudes on these systems. Specifically, we analyze how bound states of three\nfermions (trimers) impact Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO)\nsuperconducting correlations at commensurate charge carrier densities, where\n$2n_{\\uparrow} = n_{\\downarrow}$. In one-dimensional (1D) systems, trimer\nformation is known to suppress FFLO correlations exponentially. Our results\ndemonstrate that this suppression persists on ladder lattices of small width,\neffectively mirroring the 1D behavior. However, we find a striking departure\nfrom the 1D regime as the ladder width increases. On ladders with a width of\nfour legs, the influence of trimers on superconducting correlations becomes\nnegligible, suggesting that wider ladder systems provide a distinct environment\nwhere FFLO-like pairing remains robust even in the presence of trimer states.\nThese findings underscore the dimensional crossover in Hubbard systems and shed\nlight on the mechanisms governing superconductivity and bound-state formation\nin strongly correlated fermionic systems.

    "abstract": "This article proposes a new path planning method for addressing multi-level\nterrain situations. The proposed method includes innovations in three aspects:\n1) the pre-processing of point cloud maps with a multi-level skip-list\nstructure and data-slimming algorithm for well-organized and simplified map\nformalization and management, 2) the direct acquisition of local traversability\nindexes through vehicle and point cloud interaction analysis, which saves work\nin surface fitting, and 3) the assignment of traversability indexes on a\nmulti-level connectivity graph to generate a weighted traversability graph for\ngenerally search-based path planning. The A* algorithm is modified to utilize\nthe traversability graph to generate a short and safe path. The effectiveness\nand reliability of the proposed method are verified through indoor and outdoor\nexperiments conducted in various environments, including multi-floor buildings,\nwoodland, and rugged mountainous regions. The results demonstrate that the\nproposed method can properly address 3D path planning problems for ground\nvehicles in a wide range of situations.",

When\nE/R=0.4 and the rotational speed N=450rpm, the mixing time was shortened by 48%\ncompared with the center mixing, and the degree of chaos reached the peak.

    "abstract": "In the age of artificial intelligence and biotechnology, a unified\nunderstanding of technology and biology is critically needed but still lacking.\nA cornerstone of such unification is evolvable design. I present a formalism,\ncalled goal assembly, that unifies three key characteristics of evolvable,\nbiology-like design: (i) hierarchical integration of small competencies into\nlarger competencies; (ii) highly non-uniform (power-law or log-normal\ndistributed) representation of phenotypes by genotypes; and (iii) evolution of\nhierarchical modularity. It does so by making the hierarchy of physical goal\nstates corresponding to substructures explicit, focusing on their composition\nacross scales. In particular, higher-level goal variables approximate\nachievable joint goal states of interacting lower-level goal variables.\nMechanisms of evolvability include goal state gradient backpropagation across\nscales, hierarchical decision making among alternative goal states, and\nstructural recombination of modules. In learning theory terms, goal assembly\nproposes architectural inductive biases of emergent engineering systems\noperating at a complexity regime where goals arise as necessary abstractions.\nBeyond asking what goals are and how they are achieved, goal assembly suggests\nwe can almost independently talk about their compositionality.",

In the case of graph\nalgorithms, one way to implement this approach is through separator sets. Given\na graph $G=(V,E)$, a subset of nodes $S \\subseteq V$ is called a separator set\nof $G$ if the size of each connected component of $G-S$ is at most $2/3 \\cdot\n|V|$. The most useful separator sets are those that satisfy certain\nrestrictions of cardinality or structure. For over 40 years, various efficient\nalgorithms have been developed for computing separators of different kinds,\nparticularly in planar graphs. Separator sets, combined with a divide and\nconquer approach, have been fundamental in the design of efficient algorithms\nin various settings.\n  In this work, we present the first deterministic algorithm in the distributed\nCONGEST model that recursively computes a cycle separator over planar graphs in\n$\\tilde{O}(D)$ rounds. This result, as in the centralized setting, has\nsignificant implications in the area of distributed planar algorithms. In fact,\nfrom this result, we can construct a deterministic algorithm that computes a\nDFS tree in ${\\tilde{O}}(D)$ rounds.

In\nthis paper, we provide several contributions that enable us to analyze NIDS\nresistance to overlapping data chunks-based attacks.

This new modeling allows us to formalize overlap test cases, which\nensures exhaustiveness in overlap coverage and eases the reasoning about and\nuse of reassembly policies. Third, we analyze the reassembly behavior of\nseveral OSes and NIDSes when processing the modeled overlap test cases.

This study presents high-cadence NICER and NuSTAR\nobservations revealing spectral changes in burst and persistent emission.\nHardness ratio and spectral analysis reveal significant changes during an\n\"intermediate flare\" 2.5 hours before FRB 20221014A. This 80-second flare,\nreleasing $>(6.3\\pm0.2)\\times10^{40}$ erg, coincides with a rapid spectral\nsoftening in both burst and persistent emission and a notable decrease in burst\noccurrence rate. The intermediate flare is bright enough to be detected if\nplaced at a few Mpc, and would appear as a fast X-ray transient. This implies\nthat the connection between magnetar X-ray activity and FRBs can be observed in\nthe local Universe. Post-flare burst spectra peak near 5 keV, resembling the\ncharacteristics of the FRB-associated X-ray burst of 2020. Such change\npersisted for a few hours, implying magnetospheric evolution on similar\ntimescales. However, no radio emission was detected from post-flare bursts,\nsuggesting that FRB emission requires conditions beyond peculiar short bursts.\nThe burst waiting times exhibit a broken power-law distribution, likely\nresulting from contamination by enhanced persistent emission.

To address these issues, we propose a dynamic\ncontent-guided attention multiscale feature aggregation network (DCGANet),\nwhich adheres to the attention principle of 'coarse-to-fine' and achieves high\ndetection accuracy.

In this paper, we propose a novel plug-and-play augmentation\nmethod for the MD task, namely Misinformation Detection with Potential\nCommonsense Conflict (MD-PCC). We take inspiration from the prior studies\nindicating that fake articles are more likely to involve commonsense conflict.\nAccordingly, we construct commonsense expressions for articles, serving to\nexpress potential commonsense conflicts inferred by the difference between\nextracted commonsense triplet and golden ones inferred by the well-established\ncommonsense reasoning tool COMET. These expressions are then specified for each\narticle as augmentation. Any specific MD methods can be then trained on those\ncommonsense-augmented articles. Besides, we also collect a novel\ncommonsense-oriented dataset named CoMis, whose all fake articles are caused by\ncommonsense conflict.

In this paper, we\ndemonstrate that the Hopf-Cole transformation, originally developed for\nBurgers' equation, can recast the governing equations -- describing flow\nthrough porous media with pressure-dependent viscosity -- into a linear form.\nThe transformed equations, resembling Darcy's equations in the transformed\nvariables, enable (a) systematic mathematical analysis to establish uniqueness\nand maximum principles, (b) the derivation of a mechanics-based principle, and\n(c) the development of efficient numerical solutions using solvers optimized\nfor Darcy equations.

The\nwidespread adoption of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and electric vertical\ntakeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft plays a crucial role in enabling key\napplications within LAE, such as urban logistics, emergency rescue, and aerial\nmobility. However, unlike traditional UAV networks, LAE networks encounter\nincreased airspace management demands due to dense flying nodes and potential\ninterference with ground communication systems.

This synergy of multi-technology drives the advancement of\nreal-world LAE applications, particularly in improving operational efficiency,\noptimizing airspace usage, and ensuring safety.

However, a\nfundamental issue arises: Individuals typically perceive participation as\nadvantageous only after an institution is established, creating a paradox: How\ncan institutions form if no one will join before a critical mass exists? We\nterm this conundrum the institution bootstrapping problem and propose that\nmisperception, specifically, agents' erroneous belief that an institution\nalready exists, could resolve this paradox. By integrating well-documented\npsychological phenomena, including cognitive biases, probability distortion,\nand perceptual noise, into a game-theoretic framework, we demonstrate how these\nfactors collectively mitigate the bootstrapping problem. Notably, unbiased\nperceptual noise (e.g., noise arising from agents' heterogeneous physical or\nsocial contexts) drastically reduces the critical mass of cooperators required\nfor institutional emergence. This effect intensifies with greater diversity of\nperceptions. We explain this counter-intuitive result through asymmetric\nboundary conditions: proportional underestimation of low-probability sanctions\nproduces distinct outcomes compared to equivalent overestimation. Furthermore,\nthe type of perceptual distortion, proportional versus absolute, yields\nqualitatively different evolutionary pathways. These findings challenge\nconventional assumptions about rationality in institutional design,\nhighlighting how \"noisy\" cognition can paradoxically enhance cooperation.\nFinally, we contextualize these insights within broader discussions of\nmulti-agent system design and collective action. Our analysis underscores the\nimportance of incorporating human-like cognitive constraints, not just\nidealized rationality, into models of institutional emergence and resilience.",

    "abstract": "Diabetes is a civilization chronic disease characterized by a constant\nelevated concentration of glucose in the blood. Many processes are involved in\nthe glucose regulation, and their interactions are very complex. To better\nunderstand those processes we set ourselves a goal to create a Petri net model\nof the glucose regulation in the whole body. So far we have managed to create a\nmodel of glycolysis and synthesis of glucose in the liver, and the general\noverview models of the glucose regulation in a healthy and diabetic person. In\nthis paper we introduce Petri nets models of insulin secretion in beta cell of\nthe pancreas, and glucagon in the pancreas alpha cells. Those two hormones have\nmutually opposite effects: insulin preventing hyperglycemia, and glucagon\npreventing hypoglycemia. Understanding the mechanisms of insulin and glucagon\nsecretion constitutes the basis for understanding diabetes. We also present a\nmodel in which both processes occur together, depending on the blood glucose\nlevel. The dynamics of each model is analysed. Additionally, we transform the\noverall insulin and glucagon secretion system to a Boolean network, following\nstandard transformation rules.",

However,\nexisting image semantic communication schemes are primarily focused on\noptimizing pixel-level metrics, while neglecting the crucial aspect of region\nof interest (ROI) preservation. To address this issue, we propose an ROI-aware\nlatent representation-oriented image semantic communication (LRISC) system. In\nparticular, we first map the source image to latent features in a\nhigh-dimensional semantic space, these latent features are then fused with ROI\nmask through a feature-weighting mechanism. Subsequently, these features are\nencoded using a joint source and channel coding (JSCC) scheme with adaptive\nrate for efficient transmission over a wireless channel. At the receiver, a\nconditional diffusion model is developed by using the received latent features\nas conditional guidance to steer the reverse diffusion process, progressively\nreconstructing high-fidelity images while preserving semantic consistency.\nMoreover, we introduce a channel signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) adaptation\nmechanism, allowing one model to work across various channel states.\nExperiments show that the proposed method significantly outperforms existing\nmethods, in terms of learned perceptual image patch similarity (LPIPS) and\nrobustness against channel noise, with an average LPIPS reduction of 43.3%\ncompared to DeepJSCC, while guaranteeing the semantic consistency.",

    "abstract": "Teleoperation emerged as a promising fallback for situations beyond the\ncapabilities of automated vehicles. Nevertheless, teleoperation still faces\nchallenges, such as reduced situational awareness. Since situational awareness\nis primarily built through the remote operator's visual perception, the\nGraphical User Interface (GUI) design is critical. In addition to video feeds,\nsupplemental informational elements are crucial - not only for the\npredominantly studied Remote Driving but also for the arising desk-based Remote\nAssistance concepts. This work develops a GUI for different teleoperation\nconcepts by identifying key informational elements during the teleoperation\nprocess through expert interviews (N = 9). Following this, a static and dynamic\nGUI prototype is developed and evaluated in a click-dummy study (N = 36).\nThereby, the dynamic GUI adapts the number of displayed elements according to\nthe teleoperation phase. Results show that both GUIs achieve good System\nUsability Scale (SUS) ratings, with the dynamic GUI significantly outperforming\nthe static version in both usability and task completion time. The User\nExperience Questionnaire (UEQ) score shows potential for improvement. To\nenhance the user experience, the GUI should be evaluated in a follow-up study\nthat includes interaction with a real vehicle.",

    "abstract": "Wireless Capsule Endoscopy is a non-invasive imaging method for the entire\ngastrointestinal tract, and is a pain-free alternative to traditional\nendoscopy. It generates extensive video data that requires significant review\ntime, and localizing the capsule after ingestion is a challenge. Techniques\nlike bleeding detection and depth estimation can help with localization of\npathologies, but deep learning models are typically too large to run directly\non the capsule. Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) for bleeding segmentation and\ndepth estimation are trained on capsule endoscopic images. For monocular depth\nestimation, we distill a large foundation model into the lean NCA architecture,\nby treating the outputs of the foundation model as pseudo ground truth. We then\nport the trained NCA to the ESP32 microcontroller, enabling efficient image\nprocessing on hardware as small as a camera capsule. NCA are more accurate\n(Dice) than other portable segmentation models, while requiring more than 100x\nfewer parameters stored in memory than other small-scale models. The visual\nresults of NCA depth estimation look convincing, and in some cases beat the\nrealism and detail of the pseudo ground truth. Runtime optimizations on the\nESP32-S3 accelerate the average inference speed significantly, by more than\nfactor 3. With several algorithmic adjustments and distillation, it is possible\nto eNCApsulate NCA models into microcontrollers that fit into wireless capsule\nendoscopes.

    "abstract": "Multimodal agents, which integrate a controller e.g., a vision language\nmodel) with external tools, have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in\ntackling complex multimodal tasks. Existing approaches for training these\nagents, both supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, depend on\nextensive human-annotated task-answer pairs and tool trajectories. However, for\ncomplex multimodal tasks, such annotations are prohibitively expensive or\nimpractical to obtain. In this paper, we propose an iterative tool usage\nexploration method for multimodal agents without any pre-collected data, namely\nSPORT, via step-wise preference optimization to refine the trajectories of tool\nusage. Our method enables multimodal agents to autonomously discover effective\ntool usage strategies through self-exploration and optimization, eliminating\nthe bottleneck of human annotation. SPORT has four iterative components: task\nsynthesis, step sampling, step verification, and preference tuning. We first\nsynthesize multimodal tasks using language models. Then, we introduce a novel\ntrajectory exploration scheme, where step sampling and step verification are\nexecuted alternately to solve synthesized tasks. In step sampling, the agent\ntries different tools and obtains corresponding results. In step verification,\nwe employ a verifier to provide AI feedback to construct step-wise preference\ndata. The data is subsequently used to update the controller for tool usage\nthrough preference tuning, producing a SPORT agent. By interacting with real\nenvironments, the SPORT agent gradually evolves into a more refined and capable\nsystem. Evaluation in the GTA and GAIA benchmarks shows that the SPORT agent\nachieves 6.41% and 3.64% improvements, underscoring the generalization and\neffectiveness introduced by our method.

    "abstract": "NGC 1068 is the brightest extragalactic source in high-energy neutrinos as\nseen by IceCube, yet the accompanying gamma-ray flux is orders of magnitude\nweaker. It has been argued that this indicates that the bulk of neutrinos and\ngamma rays are emitted in the innermost vicinity of the central supermassive\nblack hole, which is transparent to neutrinos, but opaque to gamma rays. Even\nin such extreme scenarios for the acceleration of cosmic rays, astrophysical\nmodels typically overestimate the low-energy gamma-ray flux and/or require some\nfine-tuning in the physical parameters. Here we suggest instead that the dark\nmatter surrounding the supermassive black hole may absorb the gamma rays,\ninducing the observed deficit. We show that for a dark matter-photon scattering\ncross section in the range $\\sigma_{\\rm DM-\\gamma}/m_{\\rm DM} \\simeq\n10^{-28}-10^{-30}$ cm$^2$/GeV, Fermi-LAT measurements can be well reconciled\nwith IceCube data.

From the\nmethodology perspective, we introduce an online probe allocation algorithm that\ndynamically performs network tomography based on the principles of optimal\nexperimental design and the maximum likelihood estimation. We rigorously\nanalyze the regret of the algorithm under the conditions that i) the optimal\nallocation is Lipschitz continuous in the parameters being estimated and ii)\nthe parameter estimators satisfy a concentration property. From the application\nperspective, we present two case studies: a) the classical lossy\npacket-switched network and b) the quantum bit-flip network. We show that both\ncases fulfill the two theoretical conditions and provide their corresponding\nregrets when deploying our proposed online probe allocation algorithm. Besides\nthese two case studies with theoretical guarantees, we also conduct simulations\nto compare our proposed algorithm with existing methods and demonstrate our\nalgorithm's effectiveness in a broader range of scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Social robots (SRs) should autonomously interact with humans, while\nexhibiting proper social behaviors associated to their role. By contributing to\nhealth-care, education, and companionship, SRs will enhance life quality.\nHowever, personalization and sustaining user engagement remain a challenge for\nSRs, due to their limited understanding of human mental states. Accordingly, we\nleverage a recently introduced mathematical dynamic model of human perception,\ncognition, and decision-making for SRs. Identifying the parameters of this\nmodel and deploying it in behavioral steering system of SRs allows to\neffectively personalize the responses of SRs to evolving mental states of their\nusers, enhancing long-term engagement and personalization. Our approach\nuniquely enables autonomous adaptability of SRs by modeling the dynamics of\ninvisible mental states, significantly contributing to the transparency and\nawareness of SRs. We validated our model-based control system in experiments\nwith 10 participants who interacted with a Nao robot over three chess puzzle\nsessions, 45 - 90 minutes each. The identified model achieved a mean squared\nerror (MSE) of 0.067 (i.e., 1.675% of the maximum possible MSE) in tracking\nbeliefs, goals, and emotions of participants. Compared to a model-free\ncontroller that did not track mental states of participants, our approach\nincreased engagement by 16% on average. Post-interaction feedback of\nparticipants (provided via dedicated questionnaires) further confirmed the\nperceived engagement and awareness of the model-driven robot. These results\nhighlight the unique potential of model-based approaches and control theory in\nadvancing human-SR interactions.",

This paper introduces an efficient EC-based NAS method to solve\nthese problems via an innovative meta-learning framework. Specifically, a\nmeta-learning-rate (Meta-LR) scheme is used through pretraining to obtain a\nsuitable LR schedule, which guides the training process with lower information\nloss when evaluating each individual. An adaptive surrogate model is designed\nthrough an adaptive threshold to select the potential architectures in a few\nepochs and then evaluate the potential architectures with complete epochs.\nAdditionally, a periodic mutation operator is proposed to increase the\ndiversity of the population, which enhances the generalizability and\nrobustness. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet1K datasets\ndemonstrate that the proposed method achieves high performance comparable to\nthat of many state-of-the-art peer methods, with lower computational cost and\ngreater robustness.",

    "abstract": "In the trend towards hardware specialization, FPGAs play a dual role as\naccelerators for offloading, e.g., network virtualization, and as a vehicle for\nprototyping and exploring hardware designs. While FPGAs offer versatility and\nperformance, integrating them in larger systems remains challenging. Thus,\nrecent efforts have focused on raising the level of abstraction through better\ninterfaces and high-level programming languages. Yet, there is still quite some\nroom for improvement. In this paper, we present Coyote v2, an open source FPGA\nshell built with a novel, three-layer hierarchical design supporting dynamic\npartial reconfiguration of services and user logic, with a unified logic\ninterface, and high-level software abstractions such as support for\nmultithreading and multitenancy. Experimental results indicate Coyote v2\nreduces synthesis times between 15% and 20% and run-time reconfiguration times\nby an order of magnitude, when compared to existing systems.

    "abstract": "Time-dependent diffusion MRI enables the estimation of water exchange rates\nin vivo, yet reported values in grey matter remain inconsistent. While most\nstudies attribute these estimates to membrane permeability, non-permeative\ngeometric exchange has also been proposed. The present study investigates the\ncontribution of geometric exchange between dendritic spines and shafts to\ndiffusion MRI-derived exchange estimates. Monte Carlo simulations were\nperformed in synthetic dendrites with varying spine morphology, density, and\nmembrane permeability. Diffusion-weighted signals were generated using multiple\nprotocols - including single diffusion encoding, double diffusion encoding, and\nfree waveforms - and were analysed using four frameworks: the K\\\"arger model\n(via kurtosis time-dependence), correlation tensor imaging,\nRestriction-Exchange, and Multi-Gaussian Exchange with transient kurtosis\n(tMGE). Dendritic spines were found to impart similar time-dependence\nsignatures on the diffusion-weighted signal as permeative exchange (signal\ndecrease with diffusion time). The effect was modulated by both spine\nmorphology and density. Both the exchange rate and microscopic kurtosis\nincreased with spine density. The tMGE method demonstrated the ability to\ndisentangle geometric from permeative exchange. Non-permeative exchange in\ndendritic spines has a non-negligible impact on exchange estimates obtained\nwith diffusion MRI and should be considered in future studies. Diffusion MRI\nexchange estimates may provide a non-invasive proxy for dendritic spine\ndensity, with potential applications in studies of neurological disorders.",

    "abstract": "Cloud computing has become a pivotal platform for executing scientific\nworkflows due to its scalable and cost-effective infrastructure. Scientific\nCloud Service Providers (SCSPs) act as intermediaries that rent virtual\nmachines (VMs) from Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) providers to meet users'\nworkflow execution demands. The SCSP earns profit from the execution of\nscientific workflows if it completes the execution of the workflow before the\nspecified deadline of the workflow. This paper addresses two key challenges\nthat impact the profitability of SCSPs: the cold start problem and the\nefficient management of diverse VM pricing models, namely reserved, on-demand,\nand spot instances.\n  We propose a hybrid scheduling framework that integrates initial planning\nbased on historical data with real-time adaptations informed by actual workload\nvariations. In the initial phase, VMs are provisioned using reserved pricing\nbased on predicted workloads and spot instances. During execution, the system\ndynamically adjusts by provisioning additional VMs through on-demand or spot\ninstances to accommodate unexpected bursts in task arrivals. Our framework also\nincorporates a dependency-aware task scheduling strategy that accounts for cold\nstart delays and spot pricing volatility. Experimental results on real-world\nbenchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art\nmethods, achieving up to 20% improvement over cold-start-focused techniques and\n15% over pricing-model-based VM provisioning strategies.",

    "abstract": "Levitated particle systems have gained significant attention as a rapidly\nadvancing platform for precision sensing, offering low-loss, highly isolated\nenvironments by eliminating mechanical contact and associated noise. Current\nroom-temperature levitation techniques are primarily sensitive to acceleration,\nwith magnetic sensing often relying on the Meissner effect, which is\nimpractical under ambient conditions. Here, we demonstrate a diamagnetically\nstabilized magnetically levitated magnet magnetometer (LeMaMa), where the\nmotion of the magnet is detected optically. Leveraging strong spin-lattice\ncoupling in the ferromagnet to suppress spin-projection noise and minimizing\ndissipation through levitation, we achieve a sensitivity of 32 fT $/Hz^{1/2}$.\nThis sensitivity is adequate for a wide range of applications in biology,\nchemistry, and fundamental physics, matching the performance of leading\ntechnologies like SQUIDs and atomic magnetometers, while offering the distinct\nadvantage of operating at room temperature and under Earth's magnetic field.",

    "authors": [
      "Jason Swanson"
    ],
    "abstract": "In this work, we develop a formal system of inductive logic. It uses an\ninfinitary language that allows for countable conjunctions and disjunctions. It\nis based on a set of nine syntactic rules of inductive inference, and contains\nclassical first-order logic as a special case. We also provide natural,\nprobabilistic semantics, and prove both $\\sigma$-compactness and completeness.\n  We show that the whole of measure-theoretic probability theory is embedded in\nthis system of inductive logic. The semantic models of inductive logic are\nprobability measures on sets of structures. (Structures are the semantic models\nof finitary, deductive logic.) Moreover, any probability space, together with a\nset of its random variables, can be mapped to such a model in a way that gives\neach outcome, event, and random variable a logical interpretation. This\nembedding, however, is proper. There are scenarios that are expressible in this\nsystem of logic which cannot be formulated in a measure-theoretic probability\nmodel.\n  The principle of indifference is an idea originating with Laplace. It says,\nroughly, that if we are \"equally ignorant\" about two possibilities, then we\nshould assign them the same probability. The principle of indifference has no\nrigorous formulation in probability. It exists only as a heuristic. Moreover,\nits use has a problematic history and is prone to apparent paradoxes. Within\ninductive logic, however, we formulate it rigorously and illustrate its use\nthrough a number of examples.\n  Many of the ideas in inductive logic have counterparts in measure theory. The\nprinciple of indifference, however, does not. Its formulation requires the\nstructure of inductive logic, both its syntactic structure and the semantic\nstructures embedded in its models. As such, it exemplifies the fact that\ninductive logic is a strictly broader theory of probability than any that is\nbased on measure theory alone.",

While\nConfidential Virtual Machines (CVMs) offer a promising secure execution\nenvironment, their integration with serverless architectures currently faces\nfundamental limitations in key areas: security, performance, and resource\nefficiency. We present WALLET, a confidential computing system for secure\nserverless deployments to overcome these limitations.

Furthermore, by leveraging a data-centric\nI/O architecture built upon a lightweight LibOS, WALLET optimizes network\ncommunication to address performance and resource efficiency challenges. Our\nevaluation shows that compared to CVM-based deployments, WALLET has 4.3x\nsmaller TCB, improves end-to-end latency (15-93%), achieves higher function\ndensity (up to 907x), and reduces inter-function communication (up to 27x) and\nfunction chaining latency (16.7-30.2x); thus, WALLET offers a practical system\nfor confidential serverless computing.",

If sensitivity of the test to detect\nearly-stage cancers is high, using it as part of a screening programme may lead\nto better cancer outcomes, but available evidence indicates there is\nheterogeneity in sensitivity between cancer types and stages. We describe a\nframework for sharing evidence on test sensitivity between cancer types and/or\nstages, examining whether models with different sharing assumptions are\nsupported by the evidence and considering how further data could be used to\nstrengthen inference. Bayesian hierarchical models were fitted, and the impact\nof information sharing in increasing precision of the estimates of test\nsensitivity for different cancer types and stages was examined. Assumptions on\nsharing were informed by evidence from a review of the literature on the\ndeterminants of ctDNA shedding and its detection in a blood test. Support was\nstrongest for the assumption that sensitivity can be shared only across stage 4\nfor all cancer types. There was also support for the assumption that\nsensitivities can be shared across cancer types for each stage, if cancer types\nexpected to have low sensitivity are excluded which increased precision of\nearly-stage cancer sensitivity estimates and was considered the most\nappropriate model. High heterogeneity limited improvements in precision. For\nfuture research, elicitation of expert opinion could inform more realistic\nsharing assumptions.",

While\nprevious efforts have primarily focused on improving effectiveness and user\nsatisfaction, response time remains a critical bottleneck of conversational\nsearch systems. To address this, we exploit the topical locality inherent in\nconversational queries, i.e., the tendency of queries within a conversation to\nfocus on related topics. By leveraging query embedding similarities, we\ndynamically restrict the search space to semantically relevant document\nclusters, reducing computational complexity without compromising retrieval\nquality. We evaluate our approach on the TREC CAsT 2019 and 2020 datasets using\nmultiple embedding models and vector indexes, achieving improvements in\nprocessing speed of up to 10.4X with little loss in performance (4.4X without\nany loss).

In WebAssembly, functions leverage\nWebAssembly System Interface to connect to the network and exchange data via\nremote services. As a consequence, co-located serverless functions need remote\nservices to exchange data, increasing latency and adding network overhead. To\nmitigate this problem, in this paper, we introduce CWASI: a WebAssembly\nOCI-compliant runtime shim that determines the best inter-function data\nexchange approach based on the serverless function locality. CWASI introduces a\nthree-mode communication model for the Serverless Edge-Cloud continuum.

Each job may have distinct\nattributes, such as processing time, due date, weight, and release time. The\ngoal is to determine a schedule that optimizes a specified scheduling criterion\nwhile adhering to all concurrency constraints. This framework offers a\nversatile model for analyzing resource allocation problems where processes\ncompete for shared resources, such as access to shared memory. From a\ntheoretical perspective, it encompasses several classical graph coloring\nproblems, including Chromatic Number, Sum Coloring, and Interval Chromatic\nNumber.\n  Given that even the simplest concurrency-constrained scheduling problems are\nNP-hard for general conflict graphs, this study focuses on conflict graphs with\nbounded treewidth. Our results establish a dichotomy: Some problems in this\nsetting can be solved in FPT time, while others are shown to be XALP-complete\nfor treewidth as parameter. Along the way, we generalize several previously\nknown results on coloring problems for bounded treewidth graphs. Several of the\nFPT algorithms are based on the insight that completion times are bounded by\nthe Grundy number of the conflict graph - the fact that this number is bounded\nby the product of treewidth and the logarithm of the number of vertices then\nleads to the FPT time bound.",

This\nnot only enables precise extraction of motion features from driving videos, but\nalso contributes to the faithful preservation of face shape and geometry.\nSpecifically, we enhance the latent diffusion model with rich 3D expression and\ndetailed pose information by incorporating depth maps, normal maps, and\nrendering maps derived from FLAME sequences. These maps serve as motion\nguidance and are encoded into the denoising UNet through a specifically\ndesigned Geometric Guidance Encoder (GGE). A multi-layer feature fusion module\nwith integrated self-attention mechanisms is used to combine facial appearance\nand motion latent features within the spatial domain. By utilizing the 3D face\nparametric model as motion guidance, our method enables parametric alignment of\nface identity between the reference image and the motion captured from the\ndriving video.

However, our empirical observations reveal a critical\noversight: manipulated content frequently exhibits inter-modal inconsistencies\nthat could serve as valuable discriminative features, yet remain underutilized\nin contemporary detection frameworks. Motivated by this insight, we propose a\nnovel detection paradigm that explicitly identifies and leverages cross-modal\ncontradictions as discriminative cues. Our approach consists of two core\nmodules: Cross-modal Consistency Learning (CMCL) and Multi-modal Collaborative\nDiagnosis (MMCD). CMCL includes Pseudo-label Generation (PLG) and Cross-modal\nConsistency Diagnosis (CMCD). In PLG, a Multimodal Large Language Model is used\nto generate pseudo-labels for evaluating cross-modal semantic consistency.\nThen, CMCD extracts [CLS] tokens and computes cosine loss to quantify\ncross-modal inconsistencies. MMCD further integrates multimodal features\nthrough Multimodal Feature Fusion (MFF) and Probability Scores Fusion (PSF).\nMFF employs a co-attention mechanism to enhance semantic interactions across\ndifferent modalities, while a Transformer is utilized for comprehensive feature\nfusion. Meanwhile, PSF further integrates the fake news probability scores\nobtained in the previous step.

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the stabilization of linear systems with multiple\ntime-varying input delays. In scenarios where neither the exact delays\ninformation nor their bound is known, we propose a class of linear time-varying\nstate feedback controllers by using the solution to a parametric Lyapunov\nequation (PLE). By leveraging the properties of the solution to the PLE and\nconstructing a time-varying Lyapunov-Krasovskii-like functional, we prove that\n(the zero solution of) the closed-loop system is asymptotically stable.\nFurthermore, this result is extended to the observer-based output feedback\ncase. The notable characteristic of these controllers is their utilization of\nlinear time-varying gains. Furthermore, they are designed entirely independent\nof any knowledge of the time delays, resulting in controllers that are\nexceedingly easy to implement. Finally, a numerical example demonstrates the\neffectiveness of the proposed approaches.",

    "abstract": "We propose a result-level category-specific fusion architecture called\nClassWise-CRF. This architecture employs a two-stage process: first, it selects\nexpert networks that perform well in specific categories from a pool of\ncandidate networks using a greedy algorithm; second, it integrates the\nsegmentation predictions of these selected networks by adaptively weighting\ntheir contributions based on their segmentation performance in each category.\nInspired by Conditional Random Field (CRF), the ClassWise-CRF architecture\ntreats the segmentation predictions from multiple networks as confidence vector\nfields. It leverages segmentation metrics (such as Intersection over Union)\nfrom the validation set as priors and employs an exponential weighting strategy\nto fuse the category-specific confidence scores predicted by each network. This\nfusion method dynamically adjusts the weights of each network for different\ncategories, achieving category-specific optimization. Building on this, the\narchitecture further optimizes the fused results using unary and pairwise\npotentials in CRF to ensure spatial consistency and boundary accuracy. To\nvalidate the effectiveness of ClassWise-CRF, we conducted experiments on two\nremote sensing datasets, LoveDA and Vaihingen, using eight classic and advanced\nsemantic segmentation networks. The results show that the ClassWise-CRF\narchitecture significantly improves segmentation performance: on the LoveDA\ndataset, the mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) metric increased by 1.00% on\nthe validation set and by 0.68% on the test set; on the Vaihingen dataset, the\nmIoU improved by 0.87% on the validation set and by 0.91% on the test set.\nThese results fully demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of the\nClassWise-CRF architecture in semantic segmentation of remote sensing images.\nThe full code is available at https://github.com/zhuqinfeng1999/ClassWise-CRF.",

This study\ninvestigates multiple artificial intelligence (AI) approaches to help\nstandardize transtibial prosthetic socket design. Data from 118 patients were\ncollected by prosthetists working in the Dutch healthcare system. This data\nconsists of a three-dimensional (3D) scan of the residual limb and a\ncorresponding 3D model of the prosthetist-designed socket. Multiple data\npre-processing steps are performed for alignment, standardization and\noptionally compression using Morphable Models and Principal Component Analysis.\nAfterward, three different algorithms - a 3D neural network, Feedforward neural\nnetwork, and random forest - are developed to either predict 1) the final\nsocket shape or 2) the adaptations performed by a prosthetist to predict the\nsocket shape based on the 3D scan of the residual limb. Each algorithm's\nperformance was evaluated by comparing the prosthetist-designed socket with the\nAI-generated socket, using two metrics in combination with the error location.\nFirst, we measure the surface-to-surface distance to assess the overall surface\nerror between the AI-generated socket and the prosthetist-designed socket.\nSecond, distance maps between the AI-generated and prosthetist sockets are\nutilized to analyze the error's location. For all algorithms, estimating the\nrequired adaptations outperformed direct prediction of the final socket shape.\nThe random forest model applied to adaptation prediction yields the lowest\nerror with a median surface-to-surface distance of 1.24 millimeters, a first\nquartile of 1.03 millimeters, and a third quartile of 1.54 millimeters.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce RWKV-X, a novel hybrid architecture that combines\nthe efficiency of RWKV for short-range modeling with a sparse attention\nmechanism designed to capture long-range context. Unlike previous hybrid\napproaches that rely on full attention layers and retain quadratic complexity,\nRWKV-X achieves linear-time complexity in training and constant-time complexity\nin inference decoding. We demonstrate that RWKV-X, when continually pretrained\non 64K-token sequences, achieves near-perfect accuracy on the 64K passkey\nretrieval benchmark. It consistently outperforms prior RWKV-7 models on\nlong-context benchmarks, while maintaining strong performance on short-context\ntasks. These results highlight RWKV-X as a scalable and efficient backbone for\ngeneral-purpose language modeling, capable of decoding sequences up to 1\nmillion tokens with stable speed and memory usage.

    "abstract": "High-quality total scattering data, a key tool for understanding atomic-scale\nstructure in disordered materials, require stable instrumentation and access to\nhigh momentum transfers. This is now routine at dedicated synchrotron\ninstrumentation using high-energy X-ray beams, but it is very challenging to\nmeasure a total scattering dataset in less than a few microseconds. This limits\ntheir effectiveness for capturing structural changes that occur at the much\nfaster timescales of atomic motion. Current X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs)\nprovide femtosecond-pulsed X-ray beams with maximum energies of approximately\n24 keV, giving the potential to measure total scattering and the attendant pair\ndistribution functions (PDFs) on femtosecond timescales. Here, we show that\nthis potential has been realised using the HED scientific instrument at the\nEuropean XFEL and present normalised total scattering data for 0.35 \\r{A}-1 < Q\n< 16.6 \\r{A}-1 and their PDFs from a broad spectrum of materials, including\ncrystalline, nanocrystalline and amorphous solids, liquids, and clusters in\nsolution. We analyse the data using a variety of methods, including Rietveld\nrefinement, small-box PDF refinement, joint reciprocal-real space refinement,\ncluster refinement, and Debye scattering analysis. The resolution function of\nthe setup is also characterised. We conclusively show that high-quality data\ncan be obtained from a single approximately 30 fs XFEL pulse. Our efforts not\nonly significantly increase the existing maximum reported Q-range for an S(Q)\nmeasured at an XFEL but also mean that XFELs are now a viable X-ray source for\nthe broad community of people using reciprocal space total scattering and PDF\nmethods in their research.",

We introduce a novel variational principle that overcomes these\nlimitations, enabling the \\textit{simultaneous} determination of multiple\nlow-energy excited states. The principle is based on minimizing the trace of\nthe inverse overlap matrix multiplied by the Hamiltonian matrix,\n$\\mathrm{Tr}(\\mathbf{S}^{-1}\\mathbf{H})$, constructed from a set of\n\\textit{non-orthogonal} variational states $\\{|\\psi_i\\rangle\\}$.

This approach variationally optimizes the entire\nlow-energy subspace spanned by $\\{|\\psi_i\\rangle\\}$ without explicit\northogonality constraints or penalty functions. We demonstrate the power and\ngenerality of this method across diverse physical systems and variational\nansatzes: calculating the low-energy spectrum of 1D Heisenberg spin chains\nusing matrix product states, finding vibrational spectrum of Morse potential\nusing quantics tensor trains for real-space wavefunctions, and determining\nexcited states for 2D fermionic Hubbard model with variational quantum\ncircuits.

Specifically, pre-trained Large language models(LLMs) can\nencode a large amount of knowledge which is beneficial for training of models.\nMoreover, the graph encoder is able to learn the local features while the text\nencoder is able to learn global information such as space group and crystal\nsymmetry.

Specifically, we observe an improvement of\n40% compared to the vanilla CGCNN model and 68% compared to the SciBERT model\nfor predicting the formation energy per atom. Importantly, we demonstrate the\nzero shot performance of the trained model on small curated datasets of\nPerovskites, Chalcogenides and the Jarvis Dataset. The results show that the\nproposed model exhibits better zero shot performance than the individual plain\nvanilla CGCNN and SciBERT model.

As an applicative use case, we focused on\nclassifying common dementia conditions, Alzheimer's and frontotemporal\ndementia, versus controls. xEEGNet is broadly applicable to other neurological\nconditions involving spectral alterations. We initially used ShallowNet, a\nsimple and popular model from the EEGNet-family. Its structure was analyzed and\ngradually modified to move from a \"black box\" to a more transparent model,\nwithout compromising performance. The learned kernels and weights were examined\nfrom a clinical standpoint to assess medical relevance. Model variants,\nincluding ShallowNet and the final xEEGNet, were evaluated using robust\nNested-Leave-N-Subjects-Out cross-validation for unbiased performance\nestimates. Variability across data splits was explained using embedded EEG\nrepresentations, grouped by class and set, with pairwise separability to\nquantify group distinction. Overfitting was assessed through\ntraining-validation loss correlation and training speed. xEEGNet uses only 168\nparameters, 200 times fewer than ShallowNet, yet retains interpretability,\nresists overfitting, achieves comparable median performance (-1.5%), and\nreduces variability across splits. This variability is explained by embedded\nEEG representations: higher accuracy correlates with greater separation between\ntest set controls and Alzheimer's cases, without significant influence from\ntraining data. xEEGNet's ability to filter specific EEG bands, learn\nband-specific topographies, and use relevant spectral features demonstrates its\ninterpretability. While large deep learning models are often prioritized for\nperformance, this study shows smaller architectures like xEEGNet can be equally\neffective in EEG pathology classification.",

    "abstract": "A popular class of models for interpreting quasi-periodic X-ray eruptions\nfrom galactic nuclei (QPEs) invoke collisions between an object on an extreme\nmass ratio inspiral (EMRI) and an accretion disk around a supermassive black\nhole. There are strong links between QPE systems and those disks which formed\nfollowing a tidal disruption event (TDE), and at least two events (AT2019qiz\nand AT2022upj) are known to have occurred following an otherwise typical TDE.\nWe show that the fact that these disks were formed following a TDE strongly\nconstrains their properties, more so than previous models have assumed. Models\nbased on steady-state AGN-like disks have mass contents which grow strongly\nwith size $M_{\\rm disk}\\propto R_{\\rm out}^{7/2}$ and do not conserve the mass\nor angular momentum of the disrupted star. A very different scaling must be\nsatisfied by a TDE disk in order to conserve the disrupted stars angular\nmomentum, $M_{\\rm disk} \\propto R_{\\rm out}^{-1/2}$. These constraints\nsubstantially change the predicted scaling relationships between QPE\nobservables (luminosity, duration, energy, temperature) and the QPE period.\nThey also allow QPE observables to be written in terms of the properties of the\ntwo stars assumed to be involved (the one tidally disrupted and the one on an\nEMRI), making plausibility tests of these models possible. We show that these\nmodifications to the disk structure imply that (i) QPEs cannot be powered by\ncollisions between an orbiting black hole and a TDE disk, (ii) QPEs also cannot\nbe powered by collisions between the surface of a stellar EMRI and a TDE disk.\nA framework in which the collisions are between a TDE disk and a star which has\npuffed up to fill its Hills sphere with a trailing debris stream (as seen in\nrecent simulations) cannot be ruled out from the data, and should be the focus\nof further study.",

Despite this\nsignificant result, several problems close to the 1-2-3 Conjecture in spirit\nremain widely open. In this work, we focus on the so-called 1-2 Conjecture,\nraised by Przyby{\\l}o and Wo\\'zniak in 2010, which is a counterpart of the\n1-2-3 Conjecture where labels~$1,2$ only can be assigned, and both vertices and\nedges are labelled. We consider both the 1-2 Conjecture in its original form,\nwhere adjacent vertices must be distinguished w.r.t.~their sums of incident\nlabels, and variants for products and multisets. We prove some of these\nconjectures for graphs with bounded maximum degree (at most~$6$) and bounded\nmaximum average degree (at most~$3$), going beyond earlier results of the same\nsort.",

Although traffic efficiency can be improved by using vehicular\ncommunication for training lane change controllers using Multi-Agent\nReinforcement Learning (MARL), ensuring safety is difficult. To address this\nissue, we propose a decentralised Hybrid Safety Shield (HSS) that combines\noptimisation and a rule-based approach to guarantee safety. Our method applies\ncontrol barrier functions to constrain longitudinal and lateral control inputs\nof a CAV to ensure safe manoeuvres. Additionally, we present an architecture to\nintegrate HSS with MARL, called MARL-HSS, to improve traffic efficiency while\nensuring safety. We evaluate MARL-HSS using a gym-like environment that\nsimulates an on-ramp merging scenario with two levels of traffic densities,\nsuch as light and moderate densities. The results show that HSS provides a\nsafety guarantee by strictly enforcing a dynamic safety constraint defined on a\ntime headway, even in moderate traffic density that offers challenging lane\nchange scenarios. Moreover, the proposed method learns stable policies compared\nto the baseline, a state-of-the-art MARL lane change controller without a\nsafety shield. Further policy evaluation shows that our method achieves a\nbalance between safety and traffic efficiency with zero crashes and comparable\naverage speeds in light and moderate traffic densities.",

Recently, new efficient --\ninverted index-based -- retrieval engines have been proposed, leading to a\nnatural question: has the role of regularization changed in training LSR\nmodels? In this paper, we conduct an extended evaluation of regularization\napproaches for LSR where we discuss their effectiveness, efficiency, and\nout-of-domain generalization capabilities. We first show that regularization\ncan be relaxed to produce more effective LSR encoders. We also show that query\nencoding is now the bottleneck limiting the overall query processor\nperformance. To remove this bottleneck, we advance the state-of-the-art of\ninference-free LSR by proposing Learned Inference-free Retrieval (Li-LSR). At\ntraining time, Li-LSR learns a score for each token, casting the query encoding\nstep into a seamless table lookup.

In this\nwork, we propose a Layer-wise Representation Similarity approach to group\nCLIP-ViT layers with similar behaviors into {shallow, middle, and deep}\ncategories and assess their impact on MLLM performance.

In the absence of spatial\ngradients, the system achieves a steady state where the temperature of the\ngranular gas $T$ differs from that of the intruders $T_0$ (energy\nnonequipartition). Approximate theoretical predictions for the temperature\nratios $T/T_g$ and $T_0/T_g$ and the kurtosis $c$ and $c_0$ associated with the\ngranular gas and the intruders compare very well with Monte Carlo simulations\nfor conditions of practical interest.

    "abstract": "Economically responsible mitigation of multivariate extreme risks -- extreme\nrainfall in a large area, huge variations of many stock prices, widespread\nbreakdowns in transportation systems -- requires estimates of the probabilities\nthat such risks will materialize in the future. This paper develops a new\nmethod, Wasserstein--Aitchison Generative Adversarial Networks (WA-GAN), which\nprovides simulated values of future $d$-dimensional multivariate extreme events\nand which hence can be used to give estimates of such probabilities. The main\nhypothesis is that, after transforming the observations to the unit-Pareto\nscale, their distribution is regularly varying in the sense that the\ndistributions of their radial and angular components (with respect to the\n$L_1$-norm) converge and become asymptotically independent as the radius gets\nlarge. The method is a combination of standard extreme value analysis modeling\nof the tails of the marginal distributions with nonparametric GAN modeling of\nthe angular distribution. For the latter, the angular values are transformed to\nAitchison coordinates in a full $(d-1)$-dimensional linear space, and a\nWasserstein GAN is trained on these coordinates and used to generate new\nvalues. A reverse transformation is then applied to these values and gives\nsimulated values on the original data scale. The method shows good performance\ncompared to other existing methods in the literature, both in terms of\ncapturing the dependence structure of the extremes in the data, as well as in\ngenerating accurate new extremes of the data distribution. The comparison is\nperformed on simulated multivariate extremes from a logistic model in\ndimensions up to 50 and on a 30-dimensional financial data set.",

Our findings not only suggest a new method for tuning\nthe electronic structure of layered nickelates but also provide theoretical\nevidence for a new nickelate superconductor, awaiting experimental synthesis.",

    "abstract": "Coronal heating has puzzled solar physicists for decades. The question of why\nthe Sun's upper atmosphere is significantly hotter than its lower atmosphere\nremains a key mystery. It is commonly believed that the source of coronal\nheating comes from the Sun's magnetic field, and more complex magnetic dynamics\nis more efficient in heating. In an earlier work we studied the secondary (or\nfiner-scale) flux emergence identified in five ephemeral regions (ERs),\nselected during the last solar minimum (Yang et al. 2024). Here we further\nexplore the atmospheric response to the secondary flux emergences (SFEs) that\nwere identified in the first paper. We further reveal that approximately 80\npercent of the 172 identified SFEs are associated with atmospheric heating\nevents. The heating is most likely associated with magnetic reconnection\ninvolved in the SFE. Overall, a solar quiet region is heated by several hundred\nthousand degrees, during flux emergence of an ER.",

    "abstract": "Prompt learning has demonstrated promising results in fine-tuning pre-trained\nmultimodal models. However, the performance improvement is limited when applied\nto more complex and fine-grained tasks. The reason is that most existing\nmethods directly optimize the parameters involved in the prompt generation\nprocess through loss backpropagation, which constrains the richness and\nspecificity of the prompt representations. In this paper, we propose\nDiffusion-Driven Prompt Generator (Diff-Prompt), aiming to use the diffusion\nmodel to generate rich and fine-grained prompt information for complex\ndownstream tasks. Specifically, our approach consists of three stages. In the\nfirst stage, we train a Mask-VAE to compress the masks into latent space. In\nthe second stage, we leverage an improved Diffusion Transformer (DiT) to train\na prompt generator in the latent space, using the masks for supervision. In the\nthird stage, we align the denoising process of the prompt generator with the\npre-trained model in the semantic space, and use the generated prompts to\nfine-tune the model. We conduct experiments on a complex pixel-level downstream\ntask, referring expression comprehension, and compare our method with various\nparameter-efficient fine-tuning approaches. Diff-Prompt achieves a maximum\nimprovement of 8.87 in R@1 and 14.05 in R@5 compared to the foundation model\nand also outperforms other state-of-the-art methods across multiple metrics.\nThe experimental results validate the effectiveness of our approach and\nhighlight the potential of using generative models for prompt generation.

Heat\ncapacity not only informs thermal noise limits in metrology schemes but can\nalso reveal two-level systems (TLS) arising from crystal imperfections via a\nlinear-in-temperature term. Below 1 K, where phonon contributions are\nsuppressed, TLS can drive decoherence, leading to a linear broadening of the\nhomogeneous linewidth. From our data, we place an upper bound on the TLS\ncontribution. This, together with constant optical linewidths between 300 mK\nand 2 K measured via photon-echo lifetimes, indicates minimal TLS effects in\nour sample.

It was found that the valency\nof the predicates is the underlying factor behind the trade-off relation\nbetween MDD and MHD in Japanese. Native speakers of Japanese regulate the\nlinear complexity and hierarchical complexity through the valency of the\npredicates, and the relative sizes of MDD and MHD depend on whether the\nthreshold of valency has been reached. Apart from the cognitive load, the\nvalency of the predicates also affects the probability distributions of DD and\nHD. The effect of the valency of the predicates on the distribution of HD is\ngreater than on that of DD, which leads to differences in their probability\ndistributions and causes the mean of MDD to be lower than that of MHD.",

    "abstract": "Face recognition is a widely used authentication technology in practice,\nwhere robustness is required. It is thus essential to have an efficient and\neasy-to-use method for evaluating the robustness of (possibly third-party)\ntrained face recognition systems. Existing approaches to evaluating the\nrobustness of face recognition systems are either based on empirical evaluation\n(e.g., measuring attacking success rate using state-of-the-art attacking\nmethods) or formal analysis (e.g., measuring the Lipschitz constant). While the\nformer demands significant user efforts and expertise, the latter is extremely\ntime-consuming. In pursuit of a comprehensive, efficient, easy-to-use and\nscalable estimation of the robustness of face recognition systems, we take an\nold-school alternative approach and introduce RobFace, i.e., evaluation using\nan optimised test suite. It contains transferable adversarial face images that\nare designed to comprehensively evaluate a face recognition system's robustness\nalong a variety of dimensions. RobFace is system-agnostic and still consistent\nwith system-specific empirical evaluation or formal analysis. We support this\nclaim through extensive experimental results with various perturbations on\nmultiple face recognition systems.

    "abstract": "Optimization of the last-mile delivery and first-mile pickup of parcels is an\nintegral part of the broader logistics optimization pipeline as it entails both\ncost and resource efficiency as well as a heightened service quality. Such\noptimization requires accurate route and time prediction systems to adapt to\ndifferent scenarios in advance. This work tackles the first building block,\nnamely route prediction. This is done by introducing a novel Proximity\nAttention mechanism in an encoder-decoder architecture utilizing a Pointer\nNetwork in the decoding process (Proximity Attention Encoder and Pointer\nNetwork decoder: PAPN) to leverage the underlying connections between the\ndifferent visitable pickup positions at each timestep. To this local attention\nprocess is coupled global context computing via a multi-head attention\ntransformer encoder. The obtained global context is then mixed to an aggregated\nversion of the local embedding thus achieving a mix of global and local\nattention for complete modeling of the problems. Proximity attention is also\nused in the decoding process to skew predictions towards the locations with the\nhighest attention scores and thus using inter-connectivity of locations as a\nbase for next-location prediction. This method is trained, validated and tested\non a large industry-level dataset of real-world, large-scale last-mile delivery\nand first-mile pickup named LaDE[1]. This approach shows noticeable promise,\noutperforming all state-of-the-art supervised systems in terms of most metrics\nused for benchmarking methods on this dataset while still being competitive\nwith the best-performing reinforcement learning method named DRL4Route[2].",

    "abstract": "The discovery of unconventional antiferromagnets, such as altermagnets, has\ndrawn significant attention to higher-rank magnetic multipoles, particularly\nmagnetic octupoles. Despite the advances in research, attempts to understand\ntheir microscopic properties remain limited due to the unbounded nature of the\nposition operator in bulk crystals. In this paper, we address this problem by\nusing a well-known thermodynamic approach and derive a formula for the spin\nmagnetic octupole moment (SMOM) that can be used in bulk crystals. The\nresulting formula is gauge invariant and satisfies St\\v{r}eda formulas that\nrelate the SMOM to the spin magnetoelectric dipole-quadrupole susceptibilities.\nFurthermore, we apply this formula to several models and examine the\nfundamental properties of the SMOM. For example, in $d$-wave altermagnets, the\nnonrelativistic component of the SMOM, which is independent of spin-orbit\ncoupling, is larger than the relativistic component, which is induced by\nspin-orbit coupling. These nonrelativistic SMOMs have the same microscopic\norigin as the nonrelativistic spin splitting that characterizes $d$-wave\naltermagnetism. Moreover, they exhibit a N\\'{e}el vector dependence consistent\nwith Landau theory for $d$-wave altermagnetism [Phys. Rev. Lett.\n$\\textbf{132}$, 176702 (2024)].",

By\nmodeling UAP reconstruction as an automaton identification problem with a state\ncharacterization matrix M(D, T, E) and examining the inherent challenges in\ndata gathering as well as unknown physics, we show that inferring internal\nmechanisms (such as Isotopically-Engineered-Materials or unconventional\npropulsion systems) from finite observational data is computationally\nintractable. Data D, comprising both operational non-reproducible observations\nand reproducible analysis data from purported crash retrievals, remains\ninherently fragmentary. Even if UAP observables were reproducible, the absence\nof a comprehensive theoretical framework ensures that reverse engineering\nremains NP-complete, and may escalate to PSPACE-hard or to an\nEntscheidungsproblem. This intractability challenges current UAP reverse\nengineering efforts and has profound implications for transparency on UAP\ntechnology and related venture investments. Hence, UAP are as analogous to\nmodern smartphones in the hands of Neanderthals.",

Turbulence intensity is tuned by varying the grid stroke and frequency.\nThe flow is probed via 2D and 3D reconstructions of quasi-isodense microsphere\ntrajectories, from which we extract the large-scale properties of the flow in\nthe fully turbulent regime for different Reynolds numbers: the turbulent\nvelocity fluctuations, the energy transfer rate, and the integral length scale.\nAdditionally, we determine the mean vortex line density $\\mathcal{L}$ via\nattenuation of a second sound standing wave across the entire measurement\nvolume. Our results confirm with an improved accuracy that the intervortex\nspacing $\\ell =1/\\sqrt{\\mathcal{L}}$ scales with the Reynolds number\n$\\text{Re}_\\kappa$ (based on the quantum of circulation $\\kappa$) as\n$\\ell\\propto \\text{Re}_\\kappa^{-3/4}$, with a well-defined numerical prefactor\nand no observed temperature dependence. This scaling recalls that of the\ndissipative length scale in classical Kolmogorov (K41) turbulence and it lead\nprevious authors to interpret $\\ell$ as an effective dissipation length scale.\nHowever, in our temperature range, this interpretation is not consistent with\nthe apparent temperature independence of the prefactor. Based on those\narguments, we propose an alternative interpretation that suggests that the\ninter-vortex distance in coflow turbulence is the consequence of the quantum\nrestricted depth of the superfluid component energy cascade.",

However, challenges remain in\ndetermining the optimal data volume, balancing accuracy and practicality, and\neffectively capturing temporal behavioral patterns. In this study, we propose a\nstatistical method using Gaussian kernel density estimate (KDE) and\nKullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to estimate the sufficient data volume for\ntraining authentication models.

Taking the Balabit and DFL datasets as examples, we significantly\nreduced the data scale, particularly by a factor of 10 for the DFL dataset,\ngreatly alleviating the training burden. Additionally, we determined the\noptimal input recognition unit length for the user authentication system on\ndifferent datasets based on the slope of Approximate Entropy.

To\naddress these issues, we propose adapting informative model structures of the\nwell-trained FSS model for target domains by learning domain characteristics\nfrom few-shot labeled support samples during inference, thereby eliminating the\nneed for retraining. Specifically, we first adaptively identify domain-specific\nmodel structures by measuring parameter importance using a novel structure\nFisher score in a data-dependent manner. Then, we progressively train the\nselected informative model structures with hierarchically constructed training\nsamples, progressing from fewer to more support shots. The resulting\nInformative Structure Adaptation (ISA) method effectively addresses domain\nshifts and equips existing well-trained in-domain FSS models with flexible\nadaptation capabilities for new domains, eliminating the need to redesign or\nretrain CD-FSS models on base data. Extensive experiments validate the\neffectiveness of our method, demonstrating superior performance across multiple\nCD-FSS benchmarks.",

However, transmitting raw sensing data\nfrom ISAC devices to the BS often incurs substantial fronthaul overhead and\nlatency. This paper investigates a three-tier collaborative inference framework\nenabled by Integrated Sensing, Communication, and Computing (ISCC), where cloud\nservers, MEC servers, and ISAC devices cooperatively execute different segments\nof a pre-trained deep neural network (DNN) for intelligent sensing. By\noffloading intermediate DNN features, the proposed framework can significantly\nreduce fronthaul transmission load. Furthermore, multiple-input multiple-output\n(MIMO) technology is employed to enhance both sensing quality and offloading\nefficiency. To minimize the overall sensing task inference latency across all\nISAC devices, we jointly optimize the DNN partitioning strategy, ISAC\nbeamforming, and computational resource allocation at the MEC servers and\ndevices, subject to sensing beampattern constraints. We also propose an\nefficient two-layer optimization algorithm. In the inner layer, we derive\nclosed-form solutions for computational resource allocation using the\nKarush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions. Moreover, we design the ISAC beamforming vectors\nvia an iterative method based on the majorization-minimization and weighted\nminimum mean square error techniques. In the outer layer, we develop a\ncross-entropy based probabilistic learning algorithm to determine an optimal\nDNN partitioning strategy.

The huge amount of the\nrotational energy has been widely believed to be the source of some cosmic\ngamma-ray bursts and superluminous supernovae. Benefited from the tight\nconstraints on the equation of state of the neutron star matter set by the\nlatest multi-messenger data, the chiral effective field theory ($\\chi$EFT) and\nperturbative quantum chromodynamics (pQCD), here we present the maximum\ngravitational mass as well as the kinetic rotational energy for a neutron star\nat a given spin period. Our nonparametric EOS analysis reveals that the\ncritical Keplerian configurations ($\\Omega_{\\rm kep}^{\\rm\ncrit}=1.00\\pm0.07\\times 10^{4}~ {\\rm rad/s}$) can sustain maximum gravitational\nmasses of $M_{\\rm kep}^{\\rm crit}=2.76^{+0.11}_{-0.09} M_\\odot$ with\ncorresponding rotational energy reaching $E_{\\rm rot,kep}^{\\rm\ncrit}=2.38^{+0.25}_{-0.24}\\times 10^{53}$. However, the maximum rotational\nenergy that can be feasibly extracted from a neutron star is limited to\n$1.40^{+0.15}_{-0.13}\\times 10^{53}$ erg, which holds for a baryon mass of\n$2.68^{+0.10}_{-0.09}M_\\odot$. All these parameters, obtained via the\nnonparametric reconstruction of the equation of state, are at the $68.3\\%$\nconfidence level and the adoption of a quarkonic model yields rather similar\nresults. These findings are found to have already set some intriguing\nconstraints on the millisecond magnetar interpretation of some exciting data.",

However, their predictive capability remains insufficiently\naddressed, limiting confidence in UBEM application when validation experiments\n(VE) are unavailable. This study proposes a Gaussian Process (GP)-based method\nto model the error structure of UBEM, involving: (1) creating a training\ndataset mapping VE conditions to validation errors, (2) fitting a GP model, and\n(3) using cross-validation to assess prediction accuracy and uncertainty while\nextrapolating to unknown scenarios. Applied to the Blagnac (France) district\nheating network with the UBEM DIMOSIM, GP models effectively capture the\ninherent structure of UBEM error and uncertainties. Results reveal\nrelationships between model performance and application conditions (e.g., load\nvariation and weather), and show great potential in estimating within-domain\nmodel error and extrapolating beyond the validation domain. Key Innovations:\n$\\bullet$ Use GP based approach to quantify the error structure of a UBEM,\n$\\bullet$ Extrapolate the UBEM predictive capability to unvalidated buildings,\n$\\bullet$ Discover different interaction patterns between validation experiment\n(VE) conditions and UBEM performance.

To tackle this, we propose a\nnovel token selection strategy, EXPLORE-THEN-SELECT, that adaptively adjust\nstatic and dynamic information needed based on question requirements. Our\nframework first explores different token allocations between static frames,\nwhich preserve spatial details, and dynamic frames, which capture temporal\nchanges. Next, it employs a query-aware attention-based metric to select the\noptimal token combination without model updates.

Controlled Concurrency Testing (CCT) can make bugs easier to expose\nby enabling control over thread interleavings and systematically exploring the\ninterleaving space through scheduling algorithms. However, existing CCT\nsolutions for kernel code are heavyweight, leading to significant performance,\nmaintainability and extensibility issues. In this work, we introduce LACE, a\nlightweight CCT framework for kernel code empowered by eBPF. Without hypervisor\nmodification, LACE features a custom scheduler tailored for CCT algorithms to\nserialize non-determistic thread execution into a controlled ordering. LACE\nalso provides a mechanism to safely inject scheduling points into the kernel\nfor fine-grained control. Furthermore, LACE employs a two-phase mutation\nstrategy to integrate the scheduler with a concurrency fuzzer, allowing for\nautomated exploration of both the input and schedule space. In our evaluation,\nLACE achieves 38\\% more branches, 57\\% overhead reduction and 11.4$\\times$\nspeed-up in bug exposure compared to the state-of-the-art kernel concurrency\nfuzzers. Our qualitative analysis also demonstrates the extensibility and\nmaintainability of LACE.

Our analysis involves the identification and\ncategorization of fashion-related content, sentiment classification with\nimproved normalization techniques, time series decomposition, statistically\nvalidated causal relationship modeling, cross-platform sentiment comparison,\nand brand-specific sentiment analysis. Results indicate correlations between\nsentiment patterns and fashion theme popularity, with accessories and\nstreetwear themes showing statistically significant rising trends. The Granger\ncausality analysis establishes sustainability and streetwear as primary trend\ndrivers, showing bidirectional relationships with several other themes. The\nfindings demonstrate that social media sentiment analysis can serve as an\neffective early indicator of fashion trend trajectories when proper statistical\nvalidation is applied.

However, existing approaches\npredominantly focus on bimodal interactions, such as image-text pairs, which\nlimits their ability to fully exploit the richness of multi-modal data.\nFurthermore, the integration of modalities in equal-scale environments remains\nunderexplored due to the challenges of constructing large-scale, balanced\ndatasets. In this study, we propose Synergy-CLIP, a novel framework that\nextends the contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) architecture to\nenhance multi-modal representation learning by integrating visual, textual, and\naudio modalities. Unlike existing methods that focus on adapting individual\nmodalities to vanilla-CLIP, Synergy-CLIP aligns and captures latent information\nacross three modalities equally. To address the high cost of constructing\nlarge-scale multi-modal datasets, we introduce VGG-sound+, a triple-modal\ndataset designed to provide equal-scale representation of visual, textual, and\naudio data. Synergy-CLIP is validated on various downstream tasks, including\nzero-shot classification, where it outperforms existing baselines.\nAdditionally, we introduce a missing modality reconstruction task,\ndemonstrating Synergy-CLIP's ability to extract synergy among modalities in\nrealistic application scenarios.

The first strategy involves fusing audio and visual features at the\nbottleneck layer of the encoder, followed by processing the fused features\nthrough the decoder. However, when there is a significant disparity between the\ntwo modalities, this approach may lead to the loss of critical information. The\nsecond strategy avoids direct fusion and instead relies on the decoder to\nhandle the interaction between audio and visual features. Nonetheless, if the\nencoder fails to integrate information across modalities adequately, the\ndecoder may be unable to effectively capture the complex relationships between\nthem. To address these issues, this paper proposes a dynamic fusion method\nbased on a gating mechanism that dynamically adjusts the modality fusion\ndegree. This approach mitigates the limitations of solely relying on the\ndecoder and facilitates efficient collaboration between audio and visual\nfeatures. Additionally, an audio attention module is introduced to enhance the\nexpressive capacity of audio features, thereby further improving model\nperformance.

A key ingredient is to establish the uniform-in-time moment\nbounds (in $L^{4q-2}$-norm, $q \\geq 1$) for the proposed fully discrete schemes\nin a super-linear setting. This is highly non-trivial for the explicit\nfull-discretization schemes and new arguments are elaborated by fully\nexploiting a contractive property of the semi-group in $L^{4q-2}$, the\ndissipativity of the nonlinearity and the particular benefit of the taming\nstrategy. Numerical experiments are finally reported to verify the theoretical\nfindings.",

There have been various discussions on theoretical justification,\nproblems with the Jeffreys prior, and alternative objective priors. Among them,\nwe focus on two types of matching priors consistent with frequentist theory:\nthe probability matching priors and the moment matching priors. In particular,\nno clear relationship has been established between these two types of priors on\nnon-regular statistical models, even though they share similar objectives.\n  Considering information geometry on a one-sided truncated exponential family,\na typical example of non-regular statistical models, we find that the Lie\nderivative along a particular vector field provides the conditions for both the\nprobability and moment matching priors. Notably, this Lie derivative does not\nappear in regular models. These conditions require the invariance of a\ngeneralized volume element with respect to differentiation along the\nnon-regular parameter. This invariance leads to a suitable decomposition of the\none-sided truncated exponential family into one-dimensional submodels. This\nresult promotes a unified understanding of probability and moment matching\npriors on non-regular models.",

    "abstract": "The accuracy of coarse-grained continuum models of dense granular flows is\nlimited by the lack of high-fidelity closure models for granular rheology. One\napproach to addressing this issue, referred to as the hierarchical multiscale\nmethod, is to use a high-fidelity fine-grained model to compute the closure\nterms needed by the coarse-grained model. The difficulty with this approach is\nthat the overall model can become computationally intractable due to the high\ncomputational cost of the high-fidelity model. In this work, we describe a\nmultiscale modeling approach for dense granular flows that utilizes neural\nnetworks trained using high-fidelity discrete element method (DEM) simulations\nto approximate the constitutive granular rheology for a continuum\nincompressible flow model. Our approach leverages an ensemble of neural\nnetworks to estimate predictive uncertainty that allows us to determine whether\nthe rheology at a given point is accurately represented by the neural network\nmodel. Additional DEM simulations are only performed when needed, minimizing\nthe number of additional DEM simulations required when updating the rheology.\nThis adaptive coupling significantly reduces the overall computational cost of\nthe approach while controlling the error. In addition, the neural networks are\ncustomized to learn regularized rheological behavior to ensure well-posedness\nof the continuum solution. We first validate the approach using two-dimensional\nsteady-state and decelerating inclined flows. We then demonstrate the\nefficiency of our approach by modeling three-dimensional sub-aerial granular\ncolumn collapse for varying initial column aspect ratios, where our multiscale\nmethod compares well with the computationally expensive computational fluid\ndynamics (CFD)-DEM simulation.",

To address this\nchallenge, we introduce UniBiomed, the first universal foundation model for\ngrounded biomedical image interpretation, which is capable of generating\naccurate diagnostic findings and simultaneously segmenting the corresponding\nbiomedical targets. UniBiomed is based on a novel integration of Multi-modal\nLarge Language Model and Segment Anything Model, which can effectively unify\ndiverse biomedical tasks in universal training for advancing grounded\ninterpretation. To develop UniBiomed, we curate a large-scale dataset\ncomprising over 27 million triplets of images, region annotations, and text\ndescriptions across ten biomedical imaging modalities. Extensive validation on\n70 internal and 14 external datasets demonstrated the state-of-the-art\nperformance of UniBiomed in diverse biomedical tasks, including image\nsegmentation, disease recognition, region-aware diagnosis, vision question\nanswering, and report generation.

Thus, scalable methods for crystal symmetry\ndetermination that can analyze a large volume of material samples within a\nshort time-frame are especially needed. Kikuchi diffraction in the SEM is a\npromising technique for this due to its sensitivity to dynamical scattering,\nwhich may provide information beyond just the seven crystal systems and\nfourteen Bravais lattices.

Since such biases are believed to stem from the demographic information\nembedded in pre-trained models (i.e., the ability of LLMs' text embeddings to\npredict demographic attributes), this study explores the relationship between\nthe model's predictive power of students' demographic attributes based on their\nwritten works and its predictive bias in the scoring task in the prompt-based\nparadigm.

    "abstract": "Knowledge distillation has become a cornerstone in modern machine learning\nsystems, celebrated for its ability to transfer knowledge from a large, complex\nteacher model to a more efficient student model. Traditionally, this process is\nregarded as secure, assuming the teacher model is clean. This belief stems from\nconventional backdoor attacks relying on poisoned training data with backdoor\ntriggers and attacker-chosen labels, which are not involved in the distillation\nprocess. Instead, knowledge distillation uses the outputs of a clean teacher\nmodel to guide the student model, inherently preventing recognition or response\nto backdoor triggers as intended by an attacker. In this paper, we challenge\nthis assumption by introducing a novel attack methodology that strategically\npoisons the distillation dataset with adversarial examples embedded with\nbackdoor triggers. This technique allows for the stealthy compromise of the\nstudent model while maintaining the integrity of the teacher model. Our\ninnovative approach represents the first successful exploitation of\nvulnerabilities within the knowledge distillation process using clean teacher\nmodels. Through extensive experiments conducted across various datasets and\nattack settings, we demonstrate the robustness, stealthiness, and effectiveness\nof our method. Our findings reveal previously unrecognized vulnerabilities and\npave the way for future research aimed at securing knowledge distillation\nprocesses against backdoor attacks.",

    "abstract": "The deployment of machine learning (ML)-based process monitoring systems has\nsignificantly advanced additive manufacturing (AM) by enabling real-time defect\ndetection, quality assessment, and process optimization. However, redundancy is\na critical yet often overlooked challenge in the deployment and operation of\nML-based AM process monitoring systems. Excessive redundancy leads to increased\nequipment costs, compromised model performance, and high computational\nrequirements, posing barriers to industrial adoption. However, existing\nresearch lacks a unified definition of redundancy and a systematic framework\nfor its evaluation and mitigation. This paper defines redundancy in ML-based AM\nprocess monitoring and categorizes it into sample-level, feature-level, and\nmodel-level redundancy. A comprehensive multi-level redundancy mitigation\n(MLRM) framework is proposed, incorporating advanced methods such as data\nregistration, downscaling, cross-modality knowledge transfer, and model pruning\nto systematically reduce redundancy while improving model performance. The\nframework is validated through an ML-based in-situ defect detection case study\nfor directed energy deposition (DED), demonstrating a 91% reduction in latency,\na 47% decrease in error rate, and a 99.4% reduction in storage requirements.\nAdditionally, the proposed approach lowers sensor costs and energy consumption,\nenabling a lightweight, cost-effective, and scalable monitoring system.

For\nexample, they fail to learn physical laws from data, and even fail to\nunderstand that the objects in the world exist in a stable fashion. This is due\nto the fact that important conditional dependence structures are not adequately\ncaptured in the vanilla diffusion models. In this work, we initiate an in-depth\nstudy on strengthening the diffusion model to capture the conditional\ndependence structures in the data. In particular, we examine the efficacy of\nthe auto-regressive (AR) diffusion models for such purpose and develop the\nfirst theoretical results on the sampling error of AR diffusion models under\n(possibly) the mildest data assumption. Our theoretical findings indicate that,\ncompared with typical diffusion models, the AR variant produces samples with a\nreduced gap in approximating the data conditional distribution. On the other\nhand, the overall inference time of the AR-diffusion models is only moderately\nlarger than that for the vanilla diffusion models, making them still practical\nfor large scale applications. We also provide empirical results showing that\nwhen there is clear conditional dependence structure in the data, the AR\ndiffusion models captures such structure, whereas vanilla DDPM fails to do so.\nOn the other hand, when there is no obvious conditional dependence across\npatches of the data, AR diffusion does not outperform DDPM.",

The 351.3-s white-dwarf spin\npulse was detected in X-rays, and the observable X-ray flux from the column\ndrastically decreased at the off-pulse phase, which suggests that the\nabsorption of the column by the accreting gas called the curtain was the major\ncause of the pulse.

These phenomena could be explained by the column's\nmore pronounced absorption by the denser curtain as mass accretion rates\nincreased. The blackbody and line fluxes rapidly decreased at the optical\ndecline, which suggests the expansion of the innermost disk edge with\ndecreasing accretion rates.

We formulate a\nlatency minimization problem under fidelity and detectability constraints to\nensure confidential and covert communication by jointly optimizing the transmit\npower and prompt compression ratio. To solve this problem, we first propose a\nprompt compression and encryption (PCAE) framework, performing surprisal-guided\ncompression followed by lightweight permutation-based encryption. Specifically,\nPCAE employs a locally deployed small language model (SLM) to estimate\ntoken-level surprisal scores, selectively retaining semantically critical\ntokens while discarding redundant ones. This significantly reduces\ncomputational overhead and transmission duration. To further enhance covert\nwireless transmission, we then develop a group-based proximal policy\noptimization (GPPO) method that samples multiple candidate actions for each\nstate, selecting the optimal one within each group and incorporating a\nKullback-Leibler (KL) divergence penalty to improve policy stability and\nexploration. Simulation results show that PCAE achieves comparable LLM response\nfidelity to baseline methods while reducing preprocessing latency by over five\norders of magnitude, enabling real-time edge deployment. We further validate\nPCAE effectiveness across diverse LLM backbones, including DeepSeek-32B,\nQwen-32B, and their smaller variants. Moreover, GPPO reduces covert\ntransmission latency by up to 38.6\\% compared to existing reinforcement\nlearning strategies, with further analysis showing that increased transmit\npower provides additional latency benefits.",

    "abstract": "The dragon-king earthquake hypothesis proposes that some very large to great\nearthquakes are not merely the extreme end of the frequency-magnitude\nGutenberg-Richter distribution (FMD), but are generated by distinct physical\nmechanisms, making them statistical outliers. We develop a data-driven\nframework to systematically test the dragon-king earthquake hypothesis. Our\nmethod combines objective spatial clustering, based on data-adaptive kernel\ndensity estimation (KDE), with a high-power sequential outlier detection\ntechnique. For each identified cluster, we exam sine the tail of the FMD to\nidentify anomalous events. Candidate dragon-kings are evaluated via robust\nstatistical tests, primarily the max-robust-sum (MRS) test with inward\nsequential testing. For each observed statistic of the MRS test, we calculate\nits p-value defined as the probability that this statistic could be generated\nby the null distribution. We apply this framework to seismicity surrounding the\n1975 Haicheng mL 7.4 and 1976 Tangshan mL 7.9 earthquakes. For Haicheng, the\nmainshock shows a strong dragon-king signature in its pre-mainshock sequence,\nwith p-values between 0.03 and 0.07 across a stable range of KDE density\nthresholds used to define natural seismicity clusters. Post-mainshock and\ncombined sequences yield slightly higher p-values (up to 0.09). In contrast,\nthe Tangshan mainshock exhibits a weaker outlier signal before the event\n(p-values in the range 0.05-0.15) but a stronger dragon-king signature\nafterward, with p-values from 0.015 to 0.05. The evidence that the Haicheng and\nTangshan mainshocks exhibit dragon-king characteristics supports the idea that\nsome large and great earthquakes arise from a maturation process that may\nenhance predictability. Haicheng provides a clear case study, while\nretrospective analyses suggest that Tangshan might also have been forecasted\nunder more systematic procedures.",

To address this gap,\nwe introduce AGHI-QA, the first large-scale benchmark specifically designed for\nquality assessment of AGHIs. The dataset comprises 4,000 images generated from\n400 carefully crafted text prompts using 10 state of-the-art T2I models. We\nconduct a systematic subjective study to collect multidimensional annotations,\nincluding perceptual quality scores, text-image correspondence scores, visible\nand distorted body part labels.

Although fine-tuning approaches have been developed to\nmitigate this issue by unlearning harmful concepts, these methods can be easily\ncircumvented through jailbreaking attacks. This implies that the harmful\nconcept has not been fully erased from the model. However, existing\njailbreaking attack methods, while effective, lack interpretability regarding\nwhy unlearned models still retain the concept, thereby hindering the\ndevelopment of defense strategies. In this work, we address these limitations\nby proposing an attack method that learns an orthogonal set of interpretable\nattack token embeddings. The attack token embeddings can be decomposed into\nhuman-interpretable textual elements, revealing that unlearned models still\nretain the target concept through implicit textual components. Furthermore,\nthese attack token embeddings are powerful and transferable across text\nprompts, initial noises, and unlearned models, emphasizing that unlearned\nmodels are more vulnerable than expected. Finally, building on the insights\nfrom our interpretable attack, we develop a defense method to protect unlearned\nmodels against both our proposed and existing jailbreaking attacks.

Previous studies suggest UMa3/U1\nis a dwarf galaxy, based on its large internal velocity dispersion and the\nimprobability (indicated by dynamical cluster simulations) of its long-term\nsurvival if it were a dark-matter-free star cluster. In this paper, we model\nthe evolution of UMa3/U1 as a star cluster using collisional N-body simulations\nthat include a description of stellar evolution and the external tidal field of\nthe Milky Way, with some simulations including primordial binaries. We find\nthat UMa3/U1 has a substantial remaining lifetime of 2.7 $\\pm$ 0.4 Gyr,\nprimarily due to the retention of compact stellar remnants within the cluster.\nThis retention is facilitated by mass segregation and the preferential loss of\nlow-mass stars. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the observed large velocity\ndispersion of UMa3/U1 can be successfully reproduced. These results support the\npossibility that UMa3/U1 is a self-gravitating star cluster. Our simulations\nreveal that modelling UMa3/U1 as a dark matter free star cluster produces a\nmarkedly altered present-day mass function, driven by a strong depletion of\nlow-mass stars.

    "abstract": "The latest trend in anomaly detection is to train a unified model instead of\ntraining a separate model for each category. However, existing multi-class\nanomaly detection (MCAD) models perform poorly in multi-view scenarios because\nthey often fail to effectively model the relationships and complementary\ninformation among different views. In this paper, we introduce a Multi-View\nMulti-Class Anomaly Detection model (MVMCAD), which integrates information from\nmultiple views to accurately identify anomalies. Specifically, we propose a\nsemi-frozen encoder, where a pre-encoder prior enhancement mechanism is added\nbefore the frozen encoder, enabling stable cross-view feature modeling and\nefficient adaptation for improved anomaly detection. Furthermore, we propose an\nAnomaly Amplification Module (AAM) that models global token interactions and\nsuppresses normal regions to enhance anomaly signals, leading to improved\ndetection performance in multi-view settings. Finally, we propose a\nCross-Feature Loss that aligns shallow encoder features with deep decoder\nfeatures and vice versa, enhancing the model's sensitivity to anomalies at\ndifferent semantic levels under multi-view scenarios. Extensive experiments on\nthe Real-IAD dataset for multi-view multi-class anomaly detection validate the\neffectiveness of our approach, achieving state-of-the-art performance of\n91.0/88.6/82.1 and 99.1/43.9/48.2/95.2 for image-level and the pixel-level,\nrespectively.",

To\ncircumvent these challenges, here we demonstrate a novel Laguerre Gaussian\nsingle-pixel imaging (LGSI) technique achieving ultra-low sampling ratio (3%)\nand super-high spatial imaging quality (Structural Similarity (SSIM) of 0.739\nand a peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of 20.762 dB).

    "abstract": "Biclustering is an effective technique in data mining and pattern\nrecognition. Biclustering algorithms based on traditional clustering face two\nfundamental limitations when processing high-dimensional data: (1) The distance\nconcentration phenomenon in high-dimensional spaces leads to data sparsity,\nrendering similarity measures ineffective; (2) Mainstream linear dimensionality\nreduction methods disrupt critical local structural patterns. To apply\nbiclustering to high-dimensional datasets, we propose an orthogonal\nfactor-based biclustering algorithm (BCBOF). First, we constructed orthogonal\nfactors in the vector space of the high-dimensional dataset. Then, we performed\nclustering using the coordinates of the original data in the orthogonal\nsubspace as clustering targets. Finally, we obtained biclustering results of\nthe original dataset. Since dimensionality reduction was applied before\nclustering, the proposed algorithm effectively mitigated the data sparsity\nproblem caused by high dimensionality. Additionally, we applied this\nbiclustering algorithm to stock technical indicator combinations and stock\nprice trend prediction. Biclustering results were transformed into fuzzy rules,\nand we incorporated profit-preserving and stop-loss rules into the rule set,\nultimately forming a fuzzy inference system for stock price trend predictions\nand trading signals. To evaluate the performance of BCBOF, we compared it with\nexisting biclustering methods using multiple evaluation metrics. The results\nshowed that our algorithm outperformed other biclustering techniques. To\nvalidate the effectiveness of the fuzzy inference system, we conducted virtual\ntrading experiments using historical data from 10 A-share stocks.

Factor rotations deal with\nequality-constrained optimization problems aimed at determining a loading\nmatrix based on measure of simplicity, such as ``perfect simple structure'' and\n``Thurstone simple structure.'' Numerous criteria have been proposed, since the\nconcept of simple structure is fundamentally ambiguous and involves multiple\ndistinct aspects. However, most rotation criteria may fail to consistently\nyield a simple structure that is optimal for analytical purposes, primarily due\nto two challenges. First, existing optimization techniques, including the\ngradient projection descent method, exhibit strong dependence on initial values\nand frequently become trapped in suboptimal local optima. Second, multifaceted\nnature of simple structure complicates the ability of any single criterion to\nensure interpretability across all aspects. In certain cases, even when a\nglobal optimum is achieved, other rotations may exhibit simpler structures in\nspecific aspects. To address these issues, obtaining all equality-constrained\nstationary points -- including both global and local optima -- is advantageous.\nFortunately, many rotation criteria are expressed as algebraic functions, and\nthe constraints in the optimization problems in factor rotations are formulated\nas algebraic equations. Therefore, we can employ computational algebra\ntechniques that utilize operations within polynomial rings to derive exact all\nequality-constrained stationary points. Unlike existing optimization methods,\nthe computational algebraic approach can determine global optima and all\nstationary points, independent of initial values.

In this study, we revisit the ID\nmechanism to elucidate its directionality and role in ocean mixing under\nvarying IGW spectral forms, with particular attention to deviations from the\nstandard Garrett-Munk (GM) spectrum. The original interpretation of ID as an\naction diffusion process, as proposed by McComas et al., suggests that ID is\ninherently bidirectional, with its direction governed by the\nvertical-wavenumber spectral slope $\\sigma$ of the IGW action spectrum, $n\n\\propto m^\\sigma$. In contrast, by evaluating the wave kinetic equation, we\nreveal a more complete depiction of ID, comprising both diffusive and\nscale-separated transfers that are rooted in energy conservation within wave\ntriads. Although the action diffusion may reverse direction depending on the\nsign of $\\sigma$ (i.e., between red and blue spectral cases), the combined ID\ntransfer consistently leads to a forward energy cascade at the dissipation\nscale, thereby contributing positively to turbulent dissipation. This supports\nthe viewpoint of ID as a dissipative mechanism in physical oceanography.

In this\npaper, we propose a novel framework Birdie, using a differentiable search\nindex. It unifies the indexing and search into a single encoder-decoder\nlanguage model, thus getting rid of error accumulations. Birdie first assigns\neach table a prefix-aware identifier and leverages a large language model-based\nquery generator to create synthetic queries for each table. It then encodes the\nmapping between synthetic queries/tables and their corresponding table\nidentifiers into the parameters of an encoder-decoder language model, enabling\ndeep query-table interactions. During search, the trained model directly\ngenerates table identifiers for a given query. To accommodate the continual\nindexing of dynamic tables, we introduce an index update strategy via parameter\nisolation, which mitigates the issue of catastrophic forgetting. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that Birdie outperforms state-of-the-art dense methods\nby 16.8% in accuracy, and reduces forgetting by over 90% compared to other\ncontinual learning approaches.",

    "abstract": "Multi-modal 3D medical image segmentation aims to accurately identify tumor\nregions across different modalities, facing challenges from variations in image\nintensity and tumor morphology. Traditional convolutional neural network\n(CNN)-based methods struggle with capturing global features, while\nTransformers-based methods, despite effectively capturing global context,\nencounter high computational costs in 3D medical image segmentation. The Mamba\nmodel combines linear scalability with long-distance modeling, making it a\npromising approach for visual representation learning. However, Mamba-based 3D\nmulti-modal segmentation still struggles to leverage modality-specific features\nand fuse complementary information effectively. In this paper, we propose a\nMamba based feature extraction and adaptive multilevel feature fusion for 3D\ntumor segmentation using multi-modal medical image. We first develop the\nspecific modality Mamba encoder to efficiently extract long-range relevant\nfeatures that represent anatomical and pathological structures present in each\nmodality. Moreover, we design an bi-level synergistic integration block that\ndynamically merges multi-modal and multi-level complementary features by the\nmodality attention and channel attention learning. Lastly, the decoder combines\ndeep semantic information with fine-grained details to generate the tumor\nsegmentation map.

Inspired by decentralization theory in\nsociology, we propose DMAC, which enhances the robustness of multi-agent\ncommunication policies by retraining them into decentralized patterns.\nSpecifically, we train an adversary DMAC\\_Adv which can dynamically identify\nand mask the critical communication channels, and then apply the adversarial\nsamples generated by DMAC\\_Adv to the adversarial learning of the communication\npolicy to force the policy in exploring other potential communication schemes\nand transition to a decentralized structure. As a training method to improve\nrobustness, DMAC can be fused with any learnable communication policy\nalgorithm. The experimental results in two communication policies and four\nmulti-agent tasks demonstrate that DMAC achieves higher improvement on\nrobustness and performance of communication policy compared with two\nstate-of-the-art and commonly-used baselines.

    "abstract": "This article aims to model international trade relationships among 29\ncountries in the apparel industry between 1994 and 2013. Bilateral trade flows\ncan be represented as a directed network, where nodes correspond to countries\nand directed edges indicate trade flows (i.e., whether one country exported to\nanother in a given year). Additionally, node (e.g., GDP) and edge-specific\n(e.g., labor provision) covariates are also available. The study focuses on two\nkey challenges: (1) capturing multiple forms of temporal and network\ndependence, and dependence on covariates; and (2) accounting for potential\ntrade volume as an important but partially observed edge-specific covariate,\nwhich is only available for country pairs that engaged in trade.\n  To address these challenges, we introduce the dynamic hurdle network model\n(Hurdle-Net) for zero-inflated directed network time series that incorporates\nseveral novel features. First, it represents the time series as a paired binary\nand continuous time series and utilizes a hurdle model that effectively handles\nsparsity in edge occurrence. Second, the model captures evolving network\ndependencies using node-specific latent variables governed by a dynamic\nshrinkage process. Third, it leverages a shared latent structure across the\nbinary and continuous components, reflecting the fact that both networks\ninvolve the same nodes. Finally, the model employs a generalized logistic link\nfunction to relate edge occurrence to edge weight, allowing for a parsimonious\nand coherent hierarchical Bayesian framework that jointly models both network\ncomponents. Compared to static or independent models, Hurdle-Net provides\nimproved model selection, estimation, and prediction performance for analyzing\ninternational trade patterns. Its effectiveness is demonstrated through\nsimulation studies and an application to bilateral trade flow data.",

Prior studies\nemploy both capsule networks and self-attention techniques to effectively\ncapture diverse underlying intents within a user's interaction sequence,\nthereby achieving the most advanced performance in sequential recommendation.\nHowever, users could potentially form novel intents from fresh interactions as\nthe lengths of user interaction sequences grow. Consequently, models need to be\ncontinually updated or even extended to adeptly encompass these emerging user\nintents, referred as incremental multi-intent sequential recommendation. % We\nrefer to this problem as incremental multi-intent sequential recommendation,\nwhich has not yet been well investigated in the existing literature. In this\npaper, we propose an effective Incremental learning framework for user\nMulti-intent Adaptation in sequential recommendation called IMA, which augments\nthe traditional fine-tuning strategy with the existing-intents retainer,\nnew-intents detector, and projection-based intents trimmer to adaptively expand\nthe model to accommodate user's new intents and prevent it from forgetting\nuser's existing intents. Furthermore, we upgrade the IMA into an Elastic\nMulti-intent Adaptation (EMA) framework which can elastically remove inactive\nintents and compress user intent vectors under memory space limit.

The uncertainties respectively\naccount for statistical and systematic contributions, the precision of the\nbranching fraction of the normalisation channel $B^0 \\to K^0 \\pi^{+} \\pi^{-}$\nand the fragmentation fraction ratio ${f_s}/{f_d}$. The branching fraction\ndetermined for $B^0 \\to K^0 p \\bar{p}$ is $(2.82 \\pm 0.08 \\pm 0.12 \\pm 0.10)\n\\times 10^{-6}$, which is the most precise measurement to date.",

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have\nbroadened the scope of vision-language tasks, excelling in applications like\nimage captioning and interactive question-answering. However, these models\nstruggle with accurately processing visual data, particularly in tasks\nrequiring precise object recognition and fine visual details. Stringent token\nlimits often result in the omission of critical information, hampering\nperformance. To address these limitations, we introduce \\SysName, a novel\nvisual prompting mechanism designed to enhance MLLM performance while\npreserving essential visual details within token limits. \\SysName features\nthree key innovations: a prompt-aware strategy that dynamically highlights\nrelevant image regions, a spatial-preserving orchestration schema that\nmaintains object integrity, and a budget-aware prompting method that balances\nglobal context with crucial visual details. Comprehensive evaluations across\nmultiple datasets demonstrate that \\SysName consistently outperforms baseline\nmethods, achieving up to a $26.9\\%$ improvement in accuracy while significantly\nreducing token consumption.",

    "abstract": "Since the recent announcements of evidence for a stochastic gravitational\nwave background from several pulsar timing array collaborations, much effort\nhas been devoted to explore features beyond the fiducial Hellings-Downs\nbackground including those arising in modified gravity theories and\ndeterministic gravitational wave signals. Inspired by previous studies, we\npropose a method to efficiently screen these models using likelihood\nreweighting based on the fiducial model. In order to alleviate the well-known\nunstable weight estimates in vanilla importance sampling, we implement\nreweighting for the second time making use of the kernel density estimation of\nthe previously reweighted samples. We tested this method by analyzing three\nsimulated datasets with an injected sinusoid signal applied to all pulsars. It\nis found that likelihood reweighting not only gives results compatible with\nthose from full Bayesian analyses when the signal is subdominant, but is also\nable to recover the signal posterior to a reasonable accuracy in the presence\nof a rather strong signal. Given samples from the fiducial model, this method\ncould bring an at least $\\mathcal{O}(10)$-time speedup in analyzing new models.",

    "abstract": "In action recognition tasks, feature diversity is essential for enhancing\nmodel generalization and performance. Existing methods typically promote\nfeature diversity by expanding the training data in the sample space, which\noften leads to inefficiencies and semantic inconsistencies. To overcome these\nproblems, we propose a novel Coarse-fine text co-guidance Diffusion model\n(CoCoDiff). CoCoDiff generates diverse yet semantically consistent features in\nthe latent space by leveraging diffusion and multi-granularity textual\nguidance. Specifically, our approach feeds spatio-temporal features extracted\nfrom skeleton sequences into a latent diffusion model to generate diverse\naction representations. Meanwhile, we introduce a coarse-fine text co-guided\nstrategy that leverages textual information from large language models (LLMs)\nto ensure semantic consistency between the generated features and the original\ninputs. It is noted that CoCoDiff operates as a plug-and-play auxiliary module\nduring training, incurring no additional inference cost. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that CoCoDiff achieves SOTA performance on skeleton-based action\nrecognition benchmarks, including NTU RGB+D, NTU RGB+D 120 and\nKinetics-Skeleton.",

Firstly, during inference in videos, objects may\ndisappear since SAM2 relies solely on memory without accounting for object\nmotion information, which limits its long-range object tracking capabilities.\nSecondly, its memory is constructed from fixed past frames, making it\nsusceptible to challenges associated with object disappearance or occlusion,\ndue to potentially inaccurate segmentation results in memory. To address these\nproblems, we present MoSAM, incorporating two key strategies to integrate\nobject motion cues into the model and establish more reliable feature memory.\nFirstly, we propose Motion-Guided Prompting (MGP), which represents the object\nmotion in both sparse and dense manners, then injects them into SAM2 through a\nset of motion-guided prompts. MGP enables the model to adjust its focus towards\nthe direction of motion, thereby enhancing the object tracking capabilities.\nFurthermore, acknowledging that past segmentation results may be inaccurate, we\ndevise a Spatial-Temporal Memory Selection (ST-MS) mechanism that dynamically\nidentifies frames likely to contain accurate segmentation in both pixel- and\nframe-level.

Statically, using Schoeck formalism to compute the\nentropy along the minimum energy path (MEP), we found significant entropic\neffects that lead to an increase of the critical resolved shear stress with\ntemperature and could help explain the long-standing anomaly observed at low to\nintermediate temperatures in copper and other metals, where the flow stress\nincreases with temperature.",

However, the universality of these events during the\nformation of young stellar objects (YSOs) is still under debate. Accurate\nstatistics of strong outbursts (FUors), are necessary to understand the role of\nepisodic accretion bursts. In this work, we search for a population of FUors\nthat may have gone undetected in the past because they either a) went into\noutburst before the start of modern monitoring surveys and are now slowly\nfading back into quiescence or b) are slow-rising outbursts that would not\ncommonly be classified as candidate FUors.

The analysis of the infrared light\ncurves and photometry of $\\sim$99000 YSO candidates from SPICY yields 717\ncandidate FUors. Infrared spectroscopy of 20 candidates, from both the\nliterature and obtained by our group, confirms that 18 YSOs are going through\nlong-term outbursts and identifies two evolved sources as contaminants. The\nnumber of candidate FUors combined with previously measured values of the\nfrequency of FUor outbursts, yield average outburst decay times that are 2.5\ntimes longer than the rise times. In addition, a population of outbursts with\nrise timescales between 2000 and 5000 days must exist to obtain our observed\nnumber of YSOs with positive slopes.

A\nsecret depolarizing BNSF mask hides amplitudes, while each quantum state is\nstored as an MLWE ciphertext pair. We formalize security with the qIND-CPA game\nthat allows coherent access to the encryption oracle and give a four-hybrid\nreduction to decisional MLWE.\n  The design also covers practical issues usually left open. A typed QC-bridge\nkeeps classical bits produced by measurements encrypted yet still usable as\ncontrols, with weak-measurement semantics for expectation-value workloads.\nEncrypted Pauli twirls add circuit privacy. If a fixed knowledge base is\nneeded, its axioms are shipped as MLWE \"capsules\"; the evaluator can use them\nbut cannot read them. A rho-calculus driver schedules encrypted tasks across\nseveral QPUs and records an auditable trace on an RChain-style ledger.\n  Performance analysis shows that the extra lattice arithmetic fits inside\ntoday's QPU idle windows: a 100-qubit, depth-10^3 teleportation-based proof\nruns in about 10 ms, the public key (seed only) is 32 bytes, and even a\nCCA-level key stays below 300 kB.

However, this approach entails a bulky transceiver\narchitecture and is limited in the supportable sensing bandwidth. To address\nthese challenges, we propose self-heterodyne sensing, a novel concept where the\nself-interference caused by the transmitter acts as the reference signal. It is\nshown that a self-heterodyne RARE functions as an atomic autocorrelator,\neliminating the need for extra reference sources while supporting sensing\nsignals with much wider bandwidth than the conventional heterodyne-sensing\nmethod. Next, a two-stage algorithm is devised to estimate the target range for\nself-heterodyne RAREs. This algorithm is shown to closely approach the\nCramer-Rao lower bound. Furthermore, we introduce the power-trajectory\n(P-trajectory) design for RAREs, which maximizes the sensing sensitivity\nthrough time-varying transmission power optimization.

    "abstract": "OSMnx is a Python package for downloading, modeling, analyzing, and\nvisualizing urban networks and any other geospatial features from OpenStreetMap\ndata. A large and growing body of literature uses it to conduct scientific\nstudies across the disciplines of geography, urban planning, transport\nengineering, computer science, and others. The OSMnx project has recently\ndeveloped and implemented many new features, modeling capabilities, and\nanalytical methods. The package now encompasses substantially more\nfunctionality than was previously documented in the literature. This article\nintroduces OSMnx's modern capabilities, usage, and design -- in addition to the\nscientific theory and logic underlying them. It shares lessons learned in\ngeospatial software development and reflects on open science's implications for\nurban modeling and analysis.",
