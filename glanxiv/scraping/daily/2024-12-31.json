    "abstract": "As quantum networks expand and are deployed outside research laboratories, a\nneed arises to design and integrate compact control electronics for each memory\nnode. It is essential to understand the performance requirements for such\nsystems, especially concerning tolerable levels of noise, since these\nspecifications dramatically affect a system's design complexity and cost. Here,\nusing an approach that can be easily generalized across quantum-hardware\nplatforms, we present a case study based on nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in\ndiamond. We model and experimentally verify the effects of phase noise and\ntiming jitter in the control system in conjunction with the spin qubit's\nenvironmental noise. We further consider the impact of different phase noise\ncharacteristics on the fidelity of dynamical decoupling sequences. The results\ndemonstrate a procedure to specify design requirements for integrated quantum\ncontrol signal generators for solid-state spin qubits, depending on their\ncoherence time, intrinsic noise spectrum, and required fidelity.",

In this work, we present a time-domain theory of\ntransient heat conduction rooted in Zwanzig's statistical theory of\nirreversible processes. Central to this framework is the time-domain transport\nfunction, Z(t), defined through equilibrium time-correlation functions of heat\nfluxes. This function generalizes the conventional concept of steady-state\nthermal conductivity, governing the transition of conduction dynamics from\nonset second sound type wave propagation at finite speeds to\ndiffusion-dominated behavior across broad temporal and spatial scales. Unlike\nphonon hydrodynamic models that rely on mesoscopic constructs such as phonon\ndrift velocity, our approach provides a quantitative and microscopic\ndescription of intrinsic memory effects in transient heat fluxes and applies\nuniversally to bulk materials at any temperature or length scale. By\nintegrating atomistic-scale first-principles calculations with continuum-level\nmacroscopic equations, this framework offers a robust foundation for numerical\nsimulations of transient temperature fields. Furthermore, it facilitates the\ninterpretation and design of transient thermal grating experiments using\nnanometer-scale heat sources and ultrafast laser systems in the extreme\nultraviolet and x-ray wavelength ranges, advancing our understanding of heat\ndissipation dynamics.",

Further, the change in perpendicular correlation\nlength with distance from the solar surface exhibits a plateau in the first 4\nMm, followed by a rapid increase until 9 Mm where it becomes shallower\nthereafter.

However, Ethereum\nlacks native solutions for post-deployment smart contract maintenance,\nrequiring developers to devise their own methods. A popular method is known as\nthe upgradeability proxy contract (UPC), which involves implementing the proxy\ndesign pattern (as defined by the Gang of Four). In this method, client calls\nfirst hit a proxy contract, which then delegates calls to a certain\nimplementation contract. Most importantly, the proxy contract can be\nreconfigured during runtime to delegate calls to another implementation\ncontract, effectively enabling application upgrades. For researchers, the\naccurate detection of UPCs is a strong requirement in the understanding of how\nexactly real-world DApps are maintained over time. For practitioners, the\naccurate detection of UPCs is crucial for providing application behavior\ntransparency and enabling auditing.

The objective of the presented study was to evaluate the\nfeasibility of a coded-mask (CM) gamma camera for real-time range verification\nin proton therapy, addressing the need for a precise and efficient method of\ntreatment monitoring.\n  Approach. A CM gamma camera prototype was tested in clinical conditions. The\nsetup incorporated a scintillator-based detection system and a structured\ntungsten collimator. The experiment consisted of the irradiation of PMMA\nphantom with proton beams of energies ranging from 70.51 to 108.15 MeV.\nExperimental data were benchmarked against Monte Carlo simulations. The distal\nfalloff position was determined for both experimental data and simulations.\n  Main results. The tested CM camera achieved a statistical precision of distal\nfalloff position determination of 1.7 mm for $10^8$ protons, which is\nconsistent with simulation predictions, despite hardware limitations such as\nnon-functional detector pixels. Simulations indicated that a fully operational\nsetup would further improve the performance of the detector. The system\ndemonstrated rate capability sufficient for clinical proton beam intensities\nand maintained performance without significant dead time.\n  Significance. This study validates the potential of the CM gamma camera for\nreal-time proton therapy monitoring. The technology promises to enhance\ntreatment accuracy and patient safety, offering a competitive alternative to\nexisting approaches such as single-slit and multi-slit systems.",

While recurrent models aim\nto compress the data into a fixed-size memory (called hidden state), attention\nallows attending to the entire context window, capturing the direct\ndependencies of all tokens. This more accurate modeling of dependencies,\nhowever, comes with a quadratic cost, limiting the model to a fixed-length\ncontext. We present a new neural long-term memory module that learns to\nmemorize historical context and helps attention to attend to the current\ncontext while utilizing long past information. We show that this neural memory\nhas the advantage of fast parallelizable training while maintaining a fast\ninference. From a memory perspective, we argue that attention due to its\nlimited context but accurate dependency modeling performs as a short-term\nmemory, while neural memory due to its ability to memorize the data, acts as a\nlong-term, more persistent, memory. Based on these two modules, we introduce a\nnew family of architectures, called Titans, and present three variants to\naddress how one can effectively incorporate memory into this architecture. Our\nexperimental results on language modeling, common-sense reasoning, genomics,\nand time series tasks show that Titans are more effective than Transformers and\nrecent modern linear recurrent models.

This property has been known since early efforts\n(contemporary with GPT-2) adopting the Transformer for language modeling.\nHowever, this result does not appear to have been well disseminated, leading to\nrecent rediscoveries.

The key\nfeatures include: (1) a homogenized anisotropic elastic response and\nstrongly-anisotropic model for the work to fracture; (2) an effective damage\nresponse that accounts consistently for compressive traction across the crack\nface, that is derived from the anisotropic elastic response; (3) a regularized\ncrack normal field that overcomes the shortcomings of the isotropic setting,\nand enables the correct crack response, both across and transverse to the crack\nface.\n  To test the model, we first compare the predictions to phase-field fracture\nevolution calculations in a fully-resolved layered specimen with spatial\ninhomogeneity, and show that it captures the overall patterns of crack growth.\nWe then apply the model to previously-reported experimental observations of\nfracture evolution in laboratory specimens of shales under compression with\nconfinement, and find that it predicts well the observed crack patterns in a\nbroad range of loading conditions. We further apply the model to predict the\ngrowth of wing cracks under compression and confinement. The effective crack\nresponse model enables us to treat the initial crack simply as a non-singular\ndamaged zone within the computational domain, thereby allowing for easy and\ngeneral computations.",

    "abstract": "Training vision-language models via instruction tuning often relies on large\nmixtures of data spanning diverse tasks and domains. However, these mixtures\nfrequently include redundant information, increasing computational costs\nwithout proportional performance gains, necessitating more effective data\nselection strategies. Existing methods typically rely on task-agnostic\nheuristics to estimate data importance or focus on optimizing single tasks in\nisolation, limiting their effectiveness in multitask settings. In this work, we\nintroduce ICONS, a gradient-based Influence CONsensus approach for\nvision-language data Selection. Our method leverages first-order training\ndynamics to estimate the influence of individual training examples on\nvalidation performance and aggregates these estimates across tasks via majority\nvoting over task-specific influences. This cross-task consensus identifies data\npoints that are consistently valuable across tasks, enabling us to prioritize\nexamples that drive overall performance. The voting-based design further\nmitigates issues such as score calibration and outlier sensitivity, resulting\nin robust and scalable data selection for diverse multitask mixtures. With only\n20% of the data from LLaVA-665K and Cambrian-7M, our selected subsets retain\n98.6% and 98.8% of the performance achieved with full datasets, and can even\nsurpass full data training at a 60% selection ratio on LLaVA-665K. Our approach\nalso generalizes to unseen tasks and architectures, demonstrating strong\ntransfer. We release two compact, high-utility subsets, LLaVA-ICONS-133K and\nCambrian-ICONS-1.4M, preserving impactful training examples for efficient and\nscalable vision-language model development.",

What emerges\nis a greatly generalised set-up with added structure and potential for\napplications in other areas. Let $A$ and $B$ be finite modules for a\ncommutative ring $R$, $C$ a finite abelian group and $\\lambda: A\\times\nB\\rightarrow C$ an $R$-balanced bilinear pairing. The main constructs are the\ngeneralised Heisenberg group ${\\cal H}={\\cal H}(A,B,C,\\lambda)$ attached to\nthese data (an abstract central extension of $A\\oplus B$ by $C$) which plays\nthe role of the Weyl-Heisenberg group in SIC theory, together with its\ncanonical, unitary Schr\\\"odinger representations. The SIC itself is replaced by\nan ${\\cal H}$-orbit of complex lines in the representation space, termed a\n`bouquet'. The overlaps of the SIC are interpreted as a map from ${\\cal\nH}/Z({\\cal H})$ into $\\mathbb C$ whose absolute values are the Hermitian\n`angles' between the lines in the bouquet. We also introduce a regularity\ncondition on bouquets in terms of the angle-map, intended to weaken the\nequiangularity condition of SICs. At the same time, it allows the incorporation\nof the $R$-structure via the abstract automorphism group of ${\\cal H}$ which in\nturn generalises the Clifford group of SIC theory via its associated Weil\nrepresentation. As well as several subsidiary definitions and `structural'\nresults, we prove a new `clinometric relation' for the angle-map, determine the\nstructure of the automorphism group and introduce a large class of examples of\narithmetic origin, derived from the trace-pairing on quotients of fractional\nideals in an arbitrary number field, which we investigate in greater detail.",

From the scattering parameters of\na single waveguide-fed cELC, effective electric and magnetic polarizabilities\ncan be determined that can be expressed in terms of equivalent lumped element\ncircuit components. The circuit model provides considerable insight into the\nelectromagnetic scattering properties of cELCs as a function of their geometric\nparameters and imparts intuition useful for element optimization. We find that\nplanar, inherently resonant, waveguide-fed elements exhibit a set of common\nproperties that place constraints on their coupling, maximum radiation, and\nother key scattering parameters. In addition, unlike simple slots and other\nnon-resonant irises, resonant elements introduce an effective transformer to\nthe equivalent circuit that accounts for the field enhancement occurring in\nsuch elements at resonance. We introduce a general and robust method to\ndetermine the effective circuit parameters by fitting to the extracted\npolarizability, extending the approach to resonant metamaterial elements\nintegrated with physical lumped circuit components, such as packaged capacitors\nor varactors. We find excellent agreement between the analytical predictions\nand full-wave simulations, such that with one or two full-wave simulations the\nproperties of the cELC can be determined for any externally added lumped\nelements.

We recorded honeybees flying through apertures\nwith varying shapes and sizes using high-speed cameras to examine their spatial\ndistribution patterns and trajectories during passage. Our results reveal that\nthe flight of bees was, on average, along the bilateral center of the edges of\nthe aperture irrespective of the size. When apertures were smaller, bees tended\nto also fly closer to the vertical center. However, for larger apertures, they\ntraverse at lower vertical positions (closer to the bottom edge). The behaviors\nsuggest that honeybees modulate their flight trajectories in response to\nspatial constraints, adjusting trajectory relative to aperture dimensions. When\nentering at off-center horizontal positions, bees tended to access the vertical\ncenter of the aperture, indicating altitude selection influenced by the\ncurvature of the edge below. This behavior suggests an acute awareness of the\nvertical and horizontal spatial constraints and a preference for maintaining a\ncurvature-dependent altitude that optimizes safe passage. Our analysis reveals\nthat honeybees modulate speed and altitude above the ventral edge passing\nbeneath them, maintaining a median ventral optic flow of 778 deg/s.

    "abstract": "The design space of dynamic multibody systems (MBSs), particularly those with\nflexible components, is considerably large. Consequently, having a means to\nefficiently explore this space and find the optimum solution within a feasible\ntimeframe is crucial. It is well known that for problems with several design\nvariables, sensitivity analysis using the adjoint variable method extensively\nreduces the computational costs. This paper presents the novel extension of the\ndiscrete adjoint variable method to the design optimization of dynamic flexible\nMBSs. The extension involves deriving the adjoint equations directly from the\ndiscrete, rather than the continuous, equations of motion. This results in a\nsystem of algebraic equations that is computationally less demanding to solve\ncompared to the system of differential algebraic equations produced by the\ncontinuous adjoint variable method.

REACh is an intermediate size chamber (~0.14 m$^3$)\ncombining the principle of an expansion chamber with the ability to probe the\ninfluence of turbulent flows. Nucleation is achieved via a sudden pressure drop\naccompanied by a temperature drop, which can cause humid air to condense into a\ncloud of droplets under the appropriate thermodynamic conditions. REACh\nfeatures tight control and monitoring of the initial saturation ratio of water\nvapor, identity and concentration of seeding aerosol particles, temperature,\npressure, and air flow mixing, together with high speed real time measurements\nof aerosol and droplet size and number. Here, we demonstrate that the minimum\ntemperature reached during each expansion can be reasonably described by the\nthermodynamics of dry or moist adiabats, for a wide range of initial relative\nhumidity. The size and number of droplets formed, and the overall lifetime of\nthe cloud, are characterized as a function of the aerosol concentration and\ninitial water vapor saturation ratio. The total droplet concentration scales\nlinearly with the seeding aerosol concentration, suggesting that all injected\naerosol particles serve as condensation nuclei. While the total number of\ndroplets formed increases with aerosol concentration, the mean droplet size\ndecreases with the concentration of seeding aerosols as a result of competition\nfor the available water vapor.

Another example is the co-occurrence of\nitem-item or user-item pairs in e-commerce, which also generates\nhigh-dimensional data. The objective is to utilize this data to predict the\nrelevance between items or users. In this paper, we assume that items or users\ncan be represented by unknown dense vectors. The model treats the co-occurrence\ncounts as arising from zero-inflated Gamma random variables and employs cosine\nsimilarity between the unknown vectors to summarize item-item relevance. The\nunknown values are estimated using the shared parameter alternating\nzero-inflated Gamma regression models (SA-ZIG). Both canonical link and log\nlink models are considered. Two parameter updating schemes are proposed, along\nwith an algorithm to estimate the unknown parameters. Convergence analysis is\npresented analytically. Numerical studies demonstrate that the SA-ZIG using\nFisher scoring without learning rate adjustment may fail to fi nd the maximum\nlikelihood estimate. However, the SA-ZIG with learning rate adjustment performs\nsatisfactorily in our simulation studies.",

    "abstract": "The thermodynamic uncertainty relation (TUR) is a fundamental principle in\nnon-equilibrium thermodynamics that relates entropy production to fluctuations\nin a system, establishing a trade-off between the precision of an observable\nand the thermodynamic cost. Investigating TUR violations challenges classical\nthermodynamic limits, offering the potential for improved precision-entropy\ntrade-offs, which is crucial for enhancing performance and optimization in\nquantum technologies. In this work, we investigate the thermodynamic\nuncertainty relation within a quantum collisional model, which offers the\nadvantage of discretizing interactions into successive collisions with\nauxiliaries, allowing for precise tracking of dynamics and the incorporation of\nmemory effects and non-Markovian behavior. We consider three types of dynamics\nin the collisional model: one is Markovian evolution, achieved by taking the\ncontinuous time limit and imposing the stability condition, while the other two\nare non-Markovian dynamics-one arising from increasing the collision time\nbetween the system and the auxiliaries, and the other from incorporating\ninteractions between the auxiliaries. For the Markovian dynamics, we examine\nthe classical and quantum TUR bounds in the non-equilibrium steady-state\nregime, and also the finite-time TUR bound. We identify two distinct regimes of\nclassical TUR violation: in some cases, the maximum violation occurs in the\nsteady state, while in others, it is necessarily transient-appearing only at\nearly times and vanishing with further evolution. For the two non-Markovian\napproaches, we find that both the degree and type of non-Markovianity crucially\naffect TUR violations. The second approach shows more pronounced violations\nduring transient times, while the first approach has much stronger violations\nin the steady-state regime for a certain parameter window.",

For example, in bird flocks and fish schools,\nlong-range vision and flow coupling drive individual behaviors across the\ncollective. Such collective motion can be modeled using graph neural networks\n(GNNs), but GNNs struggle when graphs become large and often fail to capture\nlong-range interactions. Here, we construct hierarchical and equivariant GNNs,\nand show that these GNNs accurately predict local and global behavior in\nsystems with collective motion. As representative examples, we apply this\napproach to simulations of clusters of point vortices and populations of\nmicroswimmers. For the point vortices, we define a local graph of vortices\nwithin a cluster and a global graph of interactions between clusters. For the\nmicroswimmers, we define a local graph around each microswimmer and a global\ngraph that groups long-range interactions. We then combine this hierarchy of\ngraphs with an approach that enforces equivariance to rotations and\ntranslations. This combination results in a significant improvement over a\nfully-connected GNN. For point vortices, our method conserves the Hamiltonian\nover long times, and, for microswimmers, our method predicts the transition\nfrom aggregation to swirling.",

Understanding the number and types of barges conveyed along\nriver segments, between ports, and at ports is crucial for estimating the\nquantities of freight transported on the nation's waterways. This insight is\nalso valuable for waterway management and infrastructure operations impacting\nareas such as targeted dredging operations, and data-driven resource\nallocation.

A\nsample of 164 vessels representing up to 42 barge convoys per vessel was used\nfor model development. The methodology involved first predicting barge presence\nand then predicting barge quantity. Features derived from the AIS data included\nspeed measures, vessel characteristics, turning measures, and interaction\nterms. For predicting barge presence, the AdaBoost model achieved an F1 score\nof 0.932. For predicting barge quantity, the Random Forest combined with an\nAdaBoost ensemble model achieved an F1 score of 0.886. Bayesian optimization\nwas used for hyperparameter tuning.

    "abstract": "Information theory has provided foundations for the theories of several\napplication areas critical for modern society, including communications,\ncomputer storage, and AI. A key aspect of Shannon's 1948 theory is a sharp\nlower bound on the number of bits needed to encode and communicate a string of\nsymbols. When he introduced the theory, Shannon famously excluded any notion of\nsemantics behind the symbols being communicated. This semantics-free notion\nwent on to have massive impact on communication and computing technologies,\neven as multiple proposals for reintroducing semantics in a theory of\ninformation were being made, notably one where Carnap and Bar-Hillel used logic\nand reasoning to capture semantics. In this paper we present, for the first\ntime, a Shannon-style analysis of a communication system equipped with a\ndeductive reasoning capability, implemented using logical inference. We use\nsome of the most important techniques developed in information theory to\ndemonstrate significant and sometimes surprising gains in communication\nefficiency availed to us through such capability, demonstrated also through\npractical codes. We thus argue that proposals for a semantic information theory\nshould include the power of deductive reasoning to magnify the value of\ntransmitted bits as we strive to fully unlock the inherent potential of\nsemantics.",

Bone growth into the implant is estimated using a\nfinite element based mechanobiological model considering the magnitude and\nfrequency of in vivo loads, as well as the density distribution of the\nsurrounding bone. The wall thicknesses of the implant unit cells are determined\nvia linear interpolation of the thicknesses over a user defined grid of control\npoints, avoiding mesh dependency and providing control over the sensitivity\ncomputation costs. The TPMS structure is modeled as a homogenized material to\nreduce computational cost. Local properties of the implant are determined at\nrun-time on an element-by-element basis using a pre-constructed surrogate model\nof the TPMS's physical and geometric properties as a function of the local wall\nthickness and the density of in-grown bone. Design sensitivities of the bone\ngrowth within the implant are computed using the direct sensitivity method.

Existing\ndynamic reconstruction methods often rely on per-scene optimization, dense\nobservations across space and time, and strong motion supervision, resulting in\nlengthy optimization times, limited generalization to novel views or scenes,\nand degenerated quality caused by noisy pseudo-labels for dynamics. To address\nthese challenges, STORM leverages a data-driven Transformer architecture that\ndirectly infers dynamic 3D scene representations--parameterized by 3D Gaussians\nand their velocities--in a single forward pass. Our key design is to aggregate\n3D Gaussians from all frames using self-supervised scene flows, transforming\nthem to the target timestep to enable complete (i.e., \"amodal\") reconstructions\nfrom arbitrary viewpoints at any moment in time. As an emergent property, STORM\nautomatically captures dynamic instances and generates high-quality masks using\nonly reconstruction losses. Extensive experiments on public datasets show that\nSTORM achieves precise dynamic scene reconstruction, surpassing\nstate-of-the-art per-scene optimization methods (+4.3 to 6.6 PSNR) and existing\nfeed-forward approaches (+2.1 to 4.7 PSNR) in dynamic regions.

However, they mainly focus on\nholistic comprehension and struggle with capturing fine-grained spatial and\ntemporal details. Besides, the lack of high-quality object-level video\ninstruction data and a comprehensive benchmark further hinders their\nadvancements. To tackle these challenges, we introduce the VideoRefer Suite to\nempower Video LLM for finer-level spatial-temporal video understanding, i.e.,\nenabling perception and reasoning on any objects throughout the video.\nSpecially, we thoroughly develop VideoRefer Suite across three essential\naspects: dataset, model, and benchmark. Firstly, we introduce a multi-agent\ndata engine to meticulously curate a large-scale, high-quality object-level\nvideo instruction dataset, termed VideoRefer-700K. Next, we present the\nVideoRefer model, which equips a versatile spatial-temporal object encoder to\ncapture precise regional and sequential representations. Finally, we\nmeticulously create a VideoRefer-Bench to comprehensively assess the\nspatial-temporal understanding capability of a Video LLM, evaluating it across\nvarious aspects. Extensive experiments and analyses demonstrate that our\nVideoRefer model not only achieves promising performance on video referring\nbenchmarks but also facilitates general video understanding capabilities.",

    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable efficacy in\ntackling a wide array of graph-related tasks across diverse domains. However, a\nsignificant challenge lies in their propensity to generate biased predictions,\nparticularly with respect to sensitive node attributes such as age and gender.\nThese biases, inherent in many machine learning models, are amplified in GNNs\ndue to the message-passing mechanism, which allows nodes to influence each\nother, rendering the task of making fair predictions notably challenging. This\nissue is particularly pertinent in critical domains where model fairness holds\nparamount importance. In this paper, we propose a novel generative\nFairness-Aware Subgraph Diffusion (FASD) method for unbiased GNN learning. The\nmethod initiates by strategically sampling small subgraphs from the original\nlarge input graph, and then proceeds to conduct subgraph debiasing via\ngenerative fairness-aware graph diffusion processes based on stochastic\ndifferential equations (SDEs). To effectively diffuse unfairness in the input\ndata, we introduce additional adversary bias perturbations to the subgraphs\nduring the forward diffusion process, and train score-based models to predict\nthese applied perturbations, enabling them to learn the underlying dynamics of\nthe biases present in the data. Subsequently, the trained score-based models\nare utilized to further debias the original subgraph samples through the\nreverse diffusion process. Finally, FASD induces fair node predictions on the\ninput graph by performing standard GNN learning on the debiased subgraphs.\nExperimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed\nmethod over state-of-the-art Fair GNN baselines across multiple benchmark\ndatasets.",

Though sampling\nmethods have been proposed that avoid computing this integral, all\ncorrectly-specified methods for full Bayesian inference that have appeared in\nthe literature involve at least one \"Metropolis-within-Gibbs\" update, requiring\ntuning of proposal distributions. The computational landscape is complicated by\nthe fact that two forms of the Bayesian elastic net prior have been introduced,\nand two representations (with and without data augmentation) of the prior\nsuggest different MCMC algorithms. We review the forms and representations of\nthe prior, discuss all combinations of these different treatments for the first\ntime, and introduce one combination of form and representation that has yet to\nappear in the literature.

A typical example is an erbium fibre laser (erbium ions in modified\nsilica glass) operating around 1550 nm or ytterbium fibre laser (ytterbium ions\nin modified silica glass) operating around 1060 nm. When erbium and ytterbium\nions together are randomly distributed in a silica glass matrix and pumped at\nabsorption band of ytterbium, laser emission is typically obtained only at 1550\nnm (emission of erbium) thanks to energy transfer from ytterbium to erbium\nions, supported by modification of silica glass matrix with phosphorous\npentoxide. However, when erbium and ytterbium ions are specifically structured\nin micro or nano scale in the fibre core it is possible to obtain\ndual-wavelength laser operation with controlled output parameters.

    "abstract": "Lung cancer is an extremely lethal disease primarily due to its late-stage\ndiagnosis and significant mortality rate, making it the major cause of\ncancer-related demises globally. Machine Learning (ML) and Convolution Neural\nnetwork (CNN) based Deep Learning (DL) techniques are primarily used for\nprecise segmentation and classification of cancerous nodules in the CT\n(Computed Tomography) or MRI images. This study introduces an innovative\napproach to lung nodule segmentation by utilizing the Segment Anything Model\n(SAM) combined with transfer learning techniques. Precise segmentation of lung\nnodules is crucial for the early detection of lung cancer. The proposed method\nleverages Bounding Box prompts and a vision transformer model to enhance\nsegmentation performance, achieving high accuracy, Dice Similarity Coefficient\n(DSC) and Intersection over Union (IoU) metrics. The integration of SAM and\nTransfer Learning significantly improves Computer-Aided Detection (CAD) systems\nin medical imaging, particularly for lung cancer diagnosis. The findings\ndemonstrate the proposed model effectiveness in precisely segmenting lung\nnodules from CT scans, underscoring its potential to advance early detection\nand improve patient care outcomes in lung cancer diagnosis. The results show\nSAM Model with transfer learning achieving a DSC of 97.08% and an IoU of 95.6%,\nfor segmentation and accuracy of 96.71% for classification indicates that ,its\nperformance is noteworthy compared to existing techniques.",

    "abstract": "The unpredictable nature of outdoor settings introduces numerous safety\nconcerns, making hazard detection crucial for safe navigation. This paper\nintroduces a novel system for sidewalk safety navigation utilizing a hybrid\napproach that combines a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) with a One-Class Support\nVector Machine (OCSVM). The system is designed to detect anomalies on sidewalks\nthat could potentially pose walking hazards. A dataset comprising over 15,000\ntraining frames and 5,000 testing frames was collected using video recordings,\ncapturing various sidewalk scenarios, including normal and hazardous\nconditions. During deployment, the VAE utilizes its reconstruction mechanism to\ndetect anomalies within a frame. Poor reconstruction by the VAE implies the\npresence of an anomaly, after which the OCSVM is used to confirm whether the\nanomaly is hazardous or non-hazardous. The proposed VAE model demonstrated\nstrong performance, with a high Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.94, effectively\ndistinguishing anomalies that could be potential hazards. The OCSVM is employed\nto reduce the detection of false hazard anomalies, such as manhole or water\nvalve covers. This approach achieves an accuracy of 91.4%, providing a highly\nreliable system for distinguishing between hazardous and non-hazardous\nscenarios. These results suggest that the proposed system offers a robust\nsolution for hazard detection in uncertain environments.",

To this end, this paper presents systematic efforts from three\nperspectives: evaluation benchmark, model architecture, and training strategy.\nFirst, we introduce OVBench, a comprehensive question-answering benchmark\ndesigned to evaluate models' ability to perceive, memorize, and reason within\nonline video contexts.

In general, jets accelerated by active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are\nefficient sources of non-thermal radiation, spanning from the radio band to\nX-ray and gamma-ray energies. Due to relativistic beaming, much of this\nradiation, particularly in the high-energy domain, is concentrated within a\nnarrow cone aligned with the jet's direction. Consequently, high-energy\nemission is more easily detected in blazars, where the jet is closely aligned\nwith the line of sight of the observer. Beginning in 2022 November, Fermi-LAT\nobserved increased gamma-ray activity from 3C 216, culminating in a strong\noutburst in 2023 May. This event was followed up by observations from the Neil\nGehrels Swift Observatory telescope. In this work, we perform a careful\nanalysis of the multifrequency data (gamma ray, X-ray, UV, optical) collected\nduring this observational campaign. We find that the spectral energy\ndistribution (SED) of the flaring source evolves in a coherent way, supporting\na common origin for the multifrequency emission. These results suggest that the\nSED observed during the outburst was dominated by a single emission zone, where\nsynchrotron self-Compton (SSC) processes played a primary role. Since\nsingle-zone SSC models have typically fewer free parameters than multizone\nalternatives, they are a powerful probe of the physical conditions of the\nhigh-energy emitting regions. Therefore, observing SSC radiation even in CSS\nsources improves our understanding of the production of high-energy radiation\nin AGN jets.",

In this work, we demonstrate the existence of an\nintrinsic STI, which has no clean counterpart. Using a real space construction\n(topological crystal), we find an axion STI characterized by the average axion\nangle $\\bar{\\theta}=\\pi$, protected by an average $C_4T$ symmetry with\n$(C_4T)^4=1$. While the exact $C_{4}T$ symmetry reverses the sign of $\\theta$\nangle, and hence seems to protect a $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ classification of\n$\\theta\\!=\\!0,\\pi$, we prove that the $\\theta\\!=\\!\\pi$ state cannot be realized\nin the clean limit if $(C_{4}T)^4 \\!=\\! 1$. Therefore, the axion STI lacks band\ninsulator correspondence and is thus intrinsic. To illustrate this state, we\nconstruct a lattice model and numerically explore its phase diagram,\nidentifying an axion STI phase separated from both band insulators and trivial\nAnderson insulators by a metallic phase, revealing the intrinsic nature of the\nSTI. We also argue that the intrinsic STI is robust against electron-electron\ninteractions. Our work thus provides the first intrinsic crystalline ASPT and\nits lattice realization.",

However, most existing Doc-RE methods focus\non optimizing single reasoning ability, but lack the ability to utilize\nexternal knowledge for comprehensive reasoning on long documents. To solve\nthese problems, a knowledge retrieval augmented method, named KnowRA, was\nproposed with comprehensive reasoning to autonomously determine whether to\naccept external knowledge to assist DocRE. Firstly, we constructed a document\ngraph for semantic encoding and integrated the co-reference resolution model to\naugment the co-reference reasoning ability. Then, we expanded the document\ngraph into a document knowledge graph by retrieving the external knowledge base\nfor common-sense reasoning and a novel knowledge filtration method was\npresented to filter out irrelevant knowledge. Finally, we proposed the axis\nattention mechanism to build direct and indirect associations with intermediary\nentities for achieving cross-sentence logical reasoning. Extensive experiments\nconducted on two datasets verified the effectiveness of our method compared to\nthe state-of-the-art baselines.

The heart of our method consists into\napproaching these scores via a computationally cheap estimator and relating the\nvariance of this estimator to the smoothness properties of the forward process.\nUnder the assumption that the density to sample from is $L$-log-smooth and that\nthe forward process is semi-log-concave: $-\\nabla^2 \\log(p_t) \\succeq -\\beta\nI_d$ for some $\\beta \\geq 0$, we prove that our algorithm achieves an expected\n$\\epsilon$ error in $\\text{KL}$ divergence in\n$O(d^7(L+\\beta)^2L^{d+2}\\epsilon^{-2(d+3)}(d+m_2(\\mu))^{2(d+1)})$ time with\n$m_2(\\mu)$ the second order moment of $\\mu$.

Several existing post-processing methods have shown the feasibility to\nimprove 3T images to produce 7T-like images [3,18]. It has been observed that\nimproving lower field (LF, <=1.5T) images comes with additional challenges due\nto poor image quality such as the function mapping 1.5T and higher field (HF,\n3T) images is more complex than the function relating 3T and 7T images [10].\nExcept for [10], no method has been addressed to improve <=1.5T MRI images.\nFurther, most of the existing methods [3,18] including [10] require example\nimages, and also often rely on pixel to pixel correspondences between LF and HF\nimages which are usually inaccurate for <=1.5T images. The focus of this paper\nis to address the unsupervised framework for quality improvement of 1.5T images\nand avoid the expensive requirements of example images and associated image\nregistration. The LF and HF images are assumed to be related by a linear\ntransformation (LT). The unknown HF image and unknown LT are estimated in\nalternate minimization framework. Further, a physics based constraint is\nproposed that provides an additional non-linear function relating LF and HF\nimages in order to achieve the desired high contrast in estimated HF image. The\nexperimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach provides processed\n1.5T images, i.e., estimated 3T-like images with improved image quality, and is\ncomparably better than the existing methods addressing similar problems. The\nimprovement in image quality is also shown to provide better tissue\nsegmentation and volume quantification as compared to scanner acquired 1.5T\nimages.",

Our findings show that publicly available models of varying sizes\nstruggle with this dataset, and underscores the need for more localized\nlanguage models.

    "abstract": "Objective: Automatic sleep scoring is crucial for diagnosing sleep disorders.\nExisting frameworks based on Polysomnography often rely on long sequences of\ninput signals to predict sleep stages, which can introduce complexity.\nMoreover, there is limited exploration of simplifying representation learning\nin sleep scoring methods. Methods: In this study, we propose NeuroSleepNet, an\nautomatic sleep scoring method designed to classify the current sleep stage\nusing only the microevents in the current input signal, without the need for\npast inputs. Our model employs supervised spatial and multi-scale temporal\ncontext learning and incorporates a transformer encoder to enhance\nrepresentation learning. Additionally, NeuroSleepNet is optimized for balanced\nperformance across five sleep stages by introducing a logarithmic scale-based\nweighting technique as a loss function. Results: NeuroSleepNet achieved similar\nand comparable performance with current state-of-the-art results. The best\naccuracy, macro-F1 score, and Cohen's kappa were 86.1 percent, 80.8 percent,\nand 0.805 for Sleep-EDF expanded; 82.0 percent, 76.3 percent, and 0.753 for\nMESA; 80.5 percent, 76.8 percent, and 0.738 for Physio2018; and 86.7 percent,\n80.9 percent, and 0.804 for the SHHS database. Conclusion: NeuroSleepNet\ndemonstrates that even with a focus on computational efficiency and a purely\nsupervised learning approach, it is possible to achieve performance that is\ncomparable to state-of-the-art methods. Significance: Our study simplifies\nautomatic sleep scoring by focusing solely on microevents in the current input\nsignal while maintaining remarkable performance. This offers a streamlined\nalternative for sleep diagnosis applications.",

To quantify LLM uncertainty\nand thereby mitigate these risks, recent works employ conformal prediction\n(CP), a model- and distribution-agnostic framework that uses LLM outputs to\ngenerate a \\emph{prediction set} containing the true answer with high\nprobability. Leveraging CP, we propose \\emph{conformal revision of questions}\n(CROQ), which revises the question by narrowing down the available choices to\nthose in the prediction set and asking the LLM the revised question. We expect\nLLMs to be more accurate on revised questions with fewer choices. Furthermore,\nwe expect CROQ to be effective when the prediction sets from CP are small.\nCommonly used logit scores often lead to large sets, diminishing CROQ's\neffectiveness. To overcome this, we propose CP-OPT, an optimization framework\nto learn scores that minimize set sizes while maintaining coverage. Our\nextensive experiments on MMLU, ToolAlpaca, and TruthfulQA datasets with\nmultiple LLMs show that CROQ improves accuracy over the standard inference,\nwith more pronounced gains when paired with CP-OPT.",

Moreover, a closed-form expression of the downlink ergodic\nspectral efficiency (SE) is derived based on maximum ratio (MR) based transmit\nprecoding and channel statistics, where both a finite number of access points\n(APs) and STAR-RIS elements as well as imperfect hardware are considered.\nFurthermore, by exploiting the ergodic signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratios\n(SINRs) among user equipment (UE), a max-min fairness problem is formulated for\nthe joint optimization of the passive transmitting and reflecting beamforming\n(BF) at the STAR-RIS as well as of the power control coefficients. An\nalternating optimization (AO) algorithm is proposed for solving the resultant\nproblems, where iterative adaptive particle swarm optimization (APSO) and\nbisection methods are proposed for circumventing the non-convexity of the RIS\npassive BF and the quasi-concave power control sub-problems, respectively. Our\nsimulation results illustrate that the STAR-RIS-aided CF-mMIMO system attains\nhigher SE than its RIS-aided counterpart. The performance of different hardware\nparameters is also evaluated. Additionally, it is demonstrated that the SE of\nthe worst UE can be significantly improved by exploiting the proposed AO-based\nalgorithm compared to conventional solutions associated with random passive BF\nand equal-power scenarios.",

While the Corona problem is well-understood\nin the context of one complex variable, it remains highly challenging in the\ncase of several complex variables. The extension of the theory of one complex\nvariable to several complex variables is not the only possible extension to\nmulti-dimensional complex analysis. Instead of functions holomorphic in each\nvariable separately, in this paper we will consider functions in some\nhypercomplex algebras, in particular in the algebra of quaternions. Previously,\nthe Corona problem had not been studied within the hypercomplex framework\nbecause of challenges posed by pointwise multiplication, which is not closed\nfor hypercomplex-valued analytic functions. Alternative notions of\nmultiplication that are closed often compromise other desirable properties,\nfurther complicating the analysis. In this work, we resolve the Corona problem\nwithin the quaternionic slice hyperholomorphic setting. Our approach involves\nreformulating the quaternionic Bezout equation with respect to the appropriate\nmultiplication into a new system of Bezout equations on the unit disc. We solve\nthis system by adapting Wolff's proof of the Corona theorem for bounded\nanalytic functions. As the number of generators increases, the associated\nalgebra grows increasingly intricate.",

There have been several advances in\nmodel selection from the standpoint of core ML methods, including basic\nprobability measures and resampling methods.

The selection adapts to a\nvariety of contextual factors that affect the model selection, such as data\ncharacteristics, number of features, prediction type, and their intricate\ndependencies. Further, it does not provide an explanation for selecting a model\nand does not consider the contextual factors and their interdependencies when\nselecting a technique.

Our ab initio calculations show a significant drop in energy, the\nemergence of a plateau and a local minimum in the potential energy surface, and\nstabilization of all phonon modes at elevated electron temperatures (>1-1.5\neV). These effects increase the competition among the BCC, HCP, and the\nface-centered cubic (FCC) phases and lead to the metastability of the BCC\nstructure.

    "abstract": "The success rate of catheterization procedures is closely linked to the\nsensory data provided to the surgeon. Vision-based deep learning models can\ndeliver both tactile and visual information in a sensor-free manner, while also\nbeing cost-effective to produce. Given the complexity of these models for\ndevices with limited computational resources, research has focused on force\nestimation and catheter segmentation separately. However, there is a lack of a\ncomprehensive architecture capable of simultaneously segmenting the catheter\nfrom two different angles and estimating the applied forces in 3D. To bridge\nthis gap, this work proposes a novel, lightweight, multi-input, multi-output\nencoder-decoder-based architecture. It is designed to segment the catheter from\ntwo points of view and concurrently measure the applied forces in the x, y, and\nz directions. This network processes two simultaneous X-Ray images, intended to\nbe fed by a biplane fluoroscopy system, showing a catheter's deflection from\ndifferent angles. It uses two parallel sub-networks with shared parameters to\noutput two segmentation maps corresponding to the inputs. Additionally, it\nleverages stereo vision to estimate the applied forces at the catheter's tip in\n3D. The architecture features two input channels, two classification heads for\nsegmentation, and a regression head for force estimation through a single\nend-to-end architecture. The output of all heads was assessed and compared with\nthe literature, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in both segmentation\nand force estimation. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first\ntime such a model has been proposed",

To address this problem, we present\nCaReBench, a testing benchmark for fine-grained video captioning and retrieval\nwith 1,000 high-quality pairs of videos and human-annotated detailed captions.\nUniquely, it provides manually separated spatial annotations and temporal\nannotations for each video. Based on this design, we introduce two evaluation\nmetrics, ReBias and CapST, specifically tailored for video retrieval and video\ncaptioning tasks, respectively. These metrics enable a comprehensive\ninvestigation into the spatial and temporal biases inherent in VLMs. In\naddition, to handle both video retrieval and video captioning tasks in a\nunified framework, we develop a simple baseline based on a Multimodal Language\nModel (MLLM). By implementing a two-stage Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), we\nfully unlock the potential of MLLM, enabling it not only to generate detailed\nvideo descriptions but also to extract video features. Surprisingly,\nexperimental results demonstrate that, compared to the CLIP-based models\ndesigned for retrieval and the popular MLLMs skilled in video captioning, our\nbaseline shows competitive performance in both fine-grained video retrieval and\nvideo detailed captioning.",

In the classical pool-based active learning model, where\nthe algorithm is allowed to make adaptive label queries to previously sampled\npoints, we establish a strong information-theoretic lower bound ruling out\nnon-trivial improvements over the passive setting. Specifically, we show that\nany active learner requires label complexity of\n$\\tilde{\\Omega}(d/(\\log(m)\\epsilon))$, where $m$ is the number of unlabeled\nexamples. Specifically, to beat the passive label complexity of $\\tilde{O}\n(d/\\epsilon)$, an active learner requires a pool of $2^{poly(d)}$ unlabeled\nsamples. On the positive side, we show that this lower bound can be\ncircumvented with membership query access, even in the agnostic model.\nSpecifically, we give a computationally efficient learner with query complexity\nof $\\tilde{O}(\\min\\{1/p, 1/\\epsilon\\} + d\\cdot polylog(1/\\epsilon))$ achieving\nerror guarantee of $O(opt)+\\epsilon$.

In particular, besides other\ninteresting results, we will clarify the connection of this system to related\nsystems developed by Paul Ruet and Norihiro Kamide. By doing so, we discuss two\nphilosophical problems that arise from making such connections quite explicit:\nfirst, there is an issue with how to make intelligible the meaning of the\nconnectives and the nature of the truth values involved in the many-valued\nsetting employed -- what we have called `the Haackian theme'. We argue that\nthis can be done in a satisfactory way, when seen according to the classicist's\nlight. Second, and related to the first problem, there is a complication\narising from the fact that the proof system advanced may be made sense of by\nadvancing at least four such different and incompatible readings -- a\nsharpening of the so-called `Carnap problem'. We make explicit how the problems\nconnect with each other precisely and argue that what results is a kind of\nunderdetermination by the deductive apparatus for the system.",

Uustalu et al. used sequents with stoup (the leftmost position of\nan antecedent that can be either empty or a single formula) to deductively\nmodel left skew monoidal closed categories, yielding results regarding proof\nidentities and categorical coherence. However, their syntax does not work well\nwhen modeling right skew monoidal closed and skew monoidal bi-closed\ncategories.\n  We solve the problem by constructing cut-free sequent calculi for left skew\nmonoidal closed and skew monoidal bi-closed categories, reminiscent of\nnon-associative Lambek calculus, with trees as antecedents. Each calculus is\nrespectively equivalent to the sequent calculus with stoup (for left skew\nmonoidal categories) and the axiomatic calculus (for skew monoidal bi-closed\ncategories). Moreover, we prove that the latter calculus is sound and complete\nwith respect to its relational models.

Lorenz ratio is defined as thermal to electrical conductivity ratio,\nnormalized by temperature and Lorenz number\n$L_{0}=\\frac{\\pi^{2}}{3}\\left(\\frac{k_{B}}{e}\\right)^{2}$. The validity of the\nWiedemann-Franz law can be checked by evaluating the Lorenz ratio, which is\nexpected to be unity. We investigate the validity of the Wiedemann-Franz law by\nexamining whether the Lorenz ratio equals unity or deviates from it. Our\nfindings indicate that, within the fluid-based framework, the Lorenz ratio\nconsistently leads to a violation of the Wiedemann-Franz law. This is\nattributed to the proportional relation between Lorenz ratio and enthalpy per\nnet charge carriers in the fluid. Based on the experimental observation,\ngraphene and quark-gluon plasma, both systems at a low net carrier density,\nviolate the Wiedemann-Franz law due to their fluidic nature. However, graphene\nat a relatively high net carrier density obeys the Wiedemann-Franz law,\nfollowed by metals with high Fermi energy or electron density. It indicates a\nfluid to the non-fluid transition of the graphene system from low to high\ncarrier density.

The\nanalog-to-digital converter incorporates design techniques that are effective\nin mitigating the adverse effects of the high temperature, such as increased\nleakage currents and electromigration. We use configurations of dummy\ntransistors for leakage compensation, clock-boosting methods to limit pass-gate\ncross-talk, and we optimized the circuit architecture to ensure stability and\naccuracy at high temperature. Comprehensive measurements demonstrate that the\nanalog-to-digital converter achieves a signal-to-noise ratio exceeding 93 dB at\n250 $^\\circ$C, with an effective number of bits of 12, and a power consumption\nof only 44~mW. The die area of the converter is only 0.065~mm$^2$ and the area\noverhead of the high-temperature mitigation circuits is only 13.7%. The\nSchreier Figure of Merit is 140~dB at the maximum temperature of 250 $^\\circ$C,\nproving the potential of the circuit for reliable operation in challenging\napplications such as gas and oil extraction and aeronautics.",

K\\\"urbis first looked at I in intuitionistic logic\nand its negative free form. It is well-known that intuitionistic reasoning\napproaches truth constructively. We also want to approach falsehood\nconstructively, in Nelson's footsteps. Within the context of Nelson's\nparaconsistent logic N4 and its negative free variant, we examine I. We offer\nan embedding function from Nelson's (free) logic into intuitionistic (free)\nlogic, as well as a natural deduction system for Nelson's (free) logic supplied\nwith I and Kripke style semantics for it. Our method not only yields\nconstructive falsehood, but also provides an alternate resolution to an issue\npertaining to Russell's interpretation of definite descriptions. This\ncomprehension might result in paradoxes. Free logic, which is often used to\nsolve this issue, is insufficiently powerful to produce contradictions.\nInstead, we employ paraconsistent logic, which is made to function in the\npresence of contradicting data without devaluing the process of reasoning.",

Analysis of the perturbation equations\nreveals that the effective potential along the extra dimension exhibits the\nshape of P\\\"oschl-Teller potential, asymptotically approaching a constant value\n(mass gap) at infinity. And analytical calculations further indicate that the\ngravitational perturbations, apart from the zero mode, possess a series of\ndiscrete, purely imaginary quasinormal modes in the late stages. This result\nimplies that these perturbations decay without oscillation over time. The\nanalytical findings also demonstrate that the brane structure primarily\ndetermines the distribution of the quasinormal spectrum while preserving the\npurely imaginary nature of the quasinormal frequencies. Subsequently, we\nfurther simulate the gravitational wave signal by numerically evolving the\nperturbation equations, which yield late-stage results consistent with the\nanalytical predictions.

    "abstract": "Dementia is a neurodegenerative disease that causes gradual cognitive\nimpairment, which is very common in the world and undergoes a lot of research\nevery year to prevent and cure it. It severely impacts the patient's ability to\nremember events and communicate clearly, where most variations of it have no\nknown cure, but early detection can help alleviate symptoms before they become\nworse. One of the main symptoms of dementia is difficulty in expressing ideas\nthrough speech. This paper attempts to talk about a model developed to predict\nthe onset of the disease using audio recordings from patients. An ASR-based\nmodel was developed that generates transcripts from the audio files using\nWhisper model and then applies RoBERTa regression model to generate an MMSE\nscore for the patient. This score can be used to predict the extent to which\nthe cognitive ability of a patient has been affected. We use the PROCESS_V1\ndataset for this task, which is introduced through the PROCESS Grand Challenge\n2025. The model achieved an RMSE score of 2.6911 which is around 10 percent\nlower than the described baseline.",

    "abstract": "Malaria remains a significant global health burden, particularly in\nresource-limited regions where timely and accurate diagnosis is critical to\neffective treatment and control. Deep Learning (DL) has emerged as a\ntransformative tool for automating malaria detection and it offers high\naccuracy and scalability. However, the effectiveness of these models is\nconstrained by challenges in data quality and model generalization including\nimbalanced datasets, limited diversity and annotation variability. These issues\nreduce diagnostic reliability and hinder real-world applicability.\n  This article provides a comprehensive analysis of these challenges and their\nimplications for malaria detection performance. Key findings highlight the\nimpact of data imbalances which can lead to a 20\\% drop in F1-score and\nregional biases which significantly hinder model generalization. Proposed\nsolutions, such as GAN-based augmentation, improved accuracy by 15-20\\% by\ngenerating synthetic data to balance classes and enhance dataset diversity.\nDomain adaptation techniques, including transfer learning, further improved\ncross-domain robustness by up to 25\\% in sensitivity.\n  Additionally, the development of diverse global datasets and collaborative\ndata-sharing frameworks is emphasized as a cornerstone for equitable and\nreliable malaria diagnostics. The role of explainable AI techniques in\nimproving clinical adoption and trustworthiness is also underscored. By\naddressing these challenges, this work advances the field of AI-driven malaria\ndetection and provides actionable insights for researchers and practitioners.\nThe proposed solutions aim to support the development of accessible and\naccurate diagnostic tools, particularly for resource-constrained populations.",

These challenging customer issues\nrepresent a major opportunity for machine learning and knowledge graph that\nidentifies the ideal engineer / group of engineers(swarm) that can best address\nthe solution, reducing the wait times for the customer. The concrete ML task we\nconsider here is a learning-to-rank(LTR) task that given an incident and a set\nof engineers currently assigned to the incident (which might be the empty set\nin the non-swarming context), produce a ranked list of engineers best fit to\nhelp resolve that incident. To calculate the rankings, we may consider a wide\nvariety of input features including the incident description provided by the\ncustomer, the affected component(s), engineer ratings of their expertise,\nknowledge base article text written by engineers, response to customer text\nwritten by engineers, and historic swarming data.

Manually designed deep continuous prompts exhibit a remarkable\nimprovement compared to the zero-shot pre-trained model on downstream tasks.\nHow to automate the continuous prompt design is an underexplored area, and a\nfundamental question arises, is manually designed deep prompt strategy optimal?\nTo answer this question, we propose a method dubbed differentiable prompt\nlearning (DPL).

Going beyond the group theoretical analyses,\nwhich focus on providing a binary description of the presence or absence of the\naltermagnetic state, in this work, we explore the role of crystal chemical\nbonding. As the latter successfully integrates the crystal and orbital\nsymmetries and is tunable, it provides a quantitative and realistic mechanism\nto explain the formation of altermagnetism. From the first principles\ncalculations and tight-binding models within the framework of the linear\ncombination of atomic orbitals on NiS, we establish a set of selection rules\nfor the formation of altermagnetism in the NiAs prototype compounds (e.g. CrSb,\nMnTe, etc.). Broadly, if single orbitals from Ni and S sites are involved in\nthe bonding, the second neighbor interaction between the nonmagnetic atoms is a\nmust to modulate the intra-sublattice interactions differently for the opposite\nspin sublattices so that the antiferromagnetic sublattice band degeneracy is\nlifted and momentum-dependent altermagnetic spin split (AMSS) appears. However,\nwhen multiple orbitals are involved from the Ni and S sites in the chemical\nbonding, altermagnetism is naturally present. Together, they amplify the AMSS.\nFurther, we propose twelve antinodal regions in the NiAs type hexagonal\ncrystals, where AMSS split is maximum. Specific to NiS, AMSS increases with\ncorrelation, and for the edge valence and conduction bands, it can go beyond\n1eV. The present study opens up new pathways to design chemical bonding driven\nselection rules in addition to the existing crystal symmetry criteria to tailor\ntunable altermagnetism.",

Both systems were designed based on adversarial\nnetworks to generate music by learning from examples. The classical system was\ntrained to learn a set of music pieces without differentiating between classes,\nwhereas the new system was trained to learn the different composers and their\nstyles to generate a creative music piece by deviating from the learned\ncomposers' styles.\n  The base structure utilized was generative adversarial networks (GANs), which\nare capable of generating novel outputs given a set of inputs to learn from and\nmimic their distribution.

In order to facilitate these new large data sizes and\nreduce computation time a distributed approach to the algorithm has been\ninvestigated. The serial nature of the CLEAN algorithm, due to its matching\npursuit design, makes this challenging. Splitting the image into a number of\ntiles which can be individually deconvolved has been investigated, but this\ncreates discontinuities in the deconvolved image and makes it difficult to\ndeconvolve faint sources in the presence of a point spread function associated\nwith bright sources in other tiles. A method of feedback between each of the\ntiles has been developed to deal with these problems. This new approach has\nbeen tested on a simulated dataset containing multiple point sources of known\nintensity. When compared to a standard H\\\"ogbom deconvolution the tiled\nfeedback version produced a reconstructed image, containing sources up to 2.1\nJy, which agreed to between -0.1 Jy and +0.04 Jy of the standard method across\nthe whole deconvolved image at a speed up to 10.66 times faster.",

Despite the bilinear nature of the observations\nin said blind deconvolution task, by requiring invertibility of the diffusion\nfilter we are able to formulate a convex optimization problem and solve it\nusing the alternating-direction method of multipliers (ADMM).

This supervised learning\napproach offers several advantages such as interpretability, parameter\nefficiency, and controllable complexity during inference. Our reproducible\nnumerical experiments corroborate that SLoG-Net exhibits performance on par\nwith the iterative ADMM baseline, but with markedly faster inference times and\nwithout needing to manually tune step-size or penalty parameters.

Finally, a visual-semantic encoder is\nexploited to refine the derived feature map, which is further incorporated into\nthe sentence decoder for caption generation. Additionally, to facilitate the\nmodel training with synthetic data, a novel CLIP-weighted cross-entropy loss is\ndevised to prioritize the high-quality image-text pairs over the low-quality\ncounterparts.

Quantization of an\nobjective function is an effective optimization methodology that decreases the\nmeasure of a level set containing several saddle points and local minima and\nfinds the optimal point at the limit level set. To investigate the dynamics of\nquantization-based optimization, we derive an overdamped Langevin dynamics\nmodel from an intuitive analysis to minimize the level set by iterative\nquantization. We claim that quantization-based optimization involves the\nquantities of thermodynamical and quantum mechanical optimization as the core\nmethodologies of global optimization. Furthermore, on the basis of the proposed\nSDE, we provide thermodynamic and quantum mechanical analysis with\nWitten-Laplacian. The simulation results with the benchmark functions, which\ncompare the performance of the nonlinear optimization, demonstrate the validity\nof the quantization-based optimization.",

There has been\nlong-standing debate about its origin. While many people believe that it black\nconsists of nearby supernova remnants (SNRs), some others consider it as a\ngiant bubble close to the Galactic Center (GC), associated with the Fermi\nBubble and the eROSITA X-ray bubble. At ultra-long wavelengths (wavelength\n$\\gtrsim 10$ m or frequency $\\lesssim 30$ MHz), particularly below $\\sim 10$\nMHz, the free-free absorption of the radio signal by diffuse electrons in the\ninterstellar medium (ISM) becomes significant, resulting in different sky\nmorphologies from those at higher frequencies. In this paper, we develop\nemissivity models for the two Loop I/NPS origin scenarios, and predict the Loop\nI/NPS morphology at ultra-long wavelengths in both scenarios, taking into\naccount the free-free absorption effect.We find that in the SNRs model, the\nfull Loop I/NPS will still be a bright arc even at $\\sim 1$ MHz. In the GC\nmodel, the arc is fully visible only above $\\sim 3$ MHz. While below this\nfrequency, it is visible only at Galactic latitudes $b\\gtrsim 30\\degree$; the\n$b\\lesssim 30 \\degree$ part becomes invisible due to the absorption by the ISM\nelectrons between the GC and the Sun.

Several recent papers have conducted a non-asymptotic\nanalysis of this problem, relying crucially on the assumption that the process\nnoise is either Gaussian or sub-Gaussian, i.e., \"light-tailed\". In sharp\ncontrast, we work under a significantly weaker noise model, assuming nothing\nmore than the existence of the fourth moment of the noise distribution. For\nthis setting, we provide the first set of results demonstrating that one can\nobtain sample-complexity bounds for linear system identification that are\nnearly of the same order as under sub-Gaussian noise. To achieve such results,\nwe develop a novel robust system identification algorithm that relies on\nconstructing multiple weakly-concentrated estimators, and then boosting their\nperformance using suitable tools from high-dimensional robust statistics.\nInterestingly, our analysis reveals how the kurtosis of the noise distribution,\na measure of heavy-tailedness, affects the number of trajectories needed to\nachieve desired estimation error bounds.

    "abstract": "In cooperative human decision-making, agreements are often not total; a\npartial degree of agreement is sufficient to commit to a decision and move on,\nas long as one is somewhat confident that the involved parties are likely to\nstand by their commitment in the future, given no drastic unexpected changes.\nIn this paper, we introduce the notion of agreement scenarios that allow\nartificial autonomous agents to reach such agreements, using formal models of\nargumentation, in particular abstract argumentation and value-based\nargumentation. We introduce the notions of degrees of satisfaction and\n(minimum, mean, and median) agreement, as well as a measure of the impact a\nvalue in a value-based argumentation framework has on these notions. We then\nanalyze how degrees of agreement are affected when agreement scenarios are\nexpanded with new information, to shed light on the reliability of partial\nagreements in dynamic scenarios. An implementation of the introduced concepts\nis provided as part of an argumentation-based reasoning software library.",

If $G$\nis not a $3$-path or a $3$-cycle or a $6$-cycle, then $\\iota(G,P_3) \\leq 2n/7$.\nThis was proved by Zhang and Wu, and independently by Borg in a slightly\nextended form. The bound is attained by infinitely many graphs having induced\n$6$-cycles. Huang, Zhang and Jin showed that if $G$ has no $6$-cycles, or $G$\nhas no induced $5$-cycles and no induced $6$-cycles, then $\\iota(G,P_3) \\leq\nn/4$ unless $G$ is a $3$-path or a $3$-cycle or a $7$-cycle or an $11$-cycle.\nThey asked if the bound still holds asymptotically for connected graphs having\nno induced $6$-cycles. Thus, the problem essentially is whether induced\n$6$-cycles solely account for the difference between the two bounds. In this\npaper, we solve this problem for subcubic graphs, which need to be treated\ndifferently from other graphs. We show that if $G$ is subcubic and has no\ninduced $6$-cycles, then $\\iota(G,P_3) \\leq n/4$ unless $G$ is a copy of one of\n$12$ particular graphs whose orders are $3$, $7$, $11$ and $15$.

A key phenomenon\nknown as weak-to-strong generalization - where a strong model trained on a weak\nmodel's outputs surpasses the weak model in task performance - has gained\nsignificant attention. Yet, whether critical trustworthiness properties such as\nrobustness, fairness, and privacy can generalize similarly remains an open\nquestion. In this work, we study this question by examining if a stronger model\ncan inherit trustworthiness properties when fine-tuned on a weaker model's\noutputs, a process we term weak-to-strong trustworthiness generalization. To\naddress this, we introduce two foundational training strategies: 1) Weak\nTrustworthiness Finetuning (Weak TFT), which leverages trustworthiness\nregularization during the fine-tuning of the weak model, and 2) Weak and\nWeak-to-Strong Trustworthiness Finetuning (Weak+WTS TFT), which extends\nregularization to both weak and strong models. Our experimental evaluation on\nreal-world datasets reveals that while some trustworthiness properties, such as\nfairness, adversarial, and OOD robustness, show significant improvement in\ntransfer when both models were regularized, others like privacy do not exhibit\nsigns of weak-to-strong trustworthiness. As the first study to explore\ntrustworthiness generalization via weak-to-strong generalization, our work\nprovides valuable insights into the potential and limitations of weak-to-strong\ngeneralization.",

    "abstract": "This study focuses on parameter-free importance measures, based on the\nrecursive definition of importance (RDI), for network nodes. The best-known\nexamples of such RDI-based measures are eigenvector centrality and Seeley\ncentrality, but they are applicable only to strongly connected networks. In\ncontrast, Katz centrality and its variants, including PageRank, are\nRDI-inspired measures that introduce free parameters to handle general\nnetworks. This motivates the overlooked question of whether an RDI-based\nmeasure can be defined for arbitrary networks without introducing free\nparameters. This question is addressed by introducing $PureRank$, a\nparameter-free recursive importance measure. PureRank proceeds in three steps:\n(i) nodes are classified into recurrent, transient, and dangling classes via\nstrongly connected component decomposition; (ii) local importance vectors for\nthese classes are formulated as solutions to Katz parameter optimization\nproblems aimed at best approximating eigenvector centrality within each class;\nand (iii) these vectors are aggregated into global scores via the RDI\nprinciple. This modular design enables parallel and incremental computation.\nPureRank also admits a probabilistic interpretation via a random-surfer model.\nThe effectiveness and characteristics of PureRank are evaluated through\nnumerical experiments on large-scale real-world networks, in comparison with\nPageRank.

    "abstract": "High-order tensor methods that employ local Taylor models of degree $p$\nwithin adaptive regularization frameworks (AR$p$) have recently received\nsignificant attention, due to their optimal global and local rates of\nconvergence for both convex and nonconvex optimization problems. However, their\nnumerical performance for general unconstrained optimization problems remains\ninsufficiently explored, which we address by showcasing the numerical\nperformance of standard second- and third-order variants ($p=2,3$) and\nproposing novel techniques for key algorithmic aspects when $p\\geq3$ to improve\nnumerical efficiency. To improve the adaptive choice of the regularization\nparameter, we extend the interpolation-based updating strategy introduced in\n(Gould, Porcelli, and Toint, 2012) for $p=2$ to $p\\geq3$. We identify\nfundamental differences between the local minima of regularized subproblems for\n$p=2$ and $p\\geq3$ and their effect on performance. Then, for $p\\geq3$, we\nintroduce a novel pre-rejection technique that rejects poor subproblem\nminimizers (referred to as `transient') before any function evaluation,\nreducing cost and selecting useful (`persistent') ones. Numerical studies\nconfirm efficiency improvements in our modified AR$3$ algorithm. We also assess\nthe effect of different subproblem termination conditions and the choice of the\ninitial regularization parameter on overall performance. Finally, we benchmark\nour best-performing AR$3$ variants, along with those in (Birgin et al., 2020),\nagainst second-order ones (AR$2$). Encouraging results on standard test\nproblems confirm that AR$3$ variants can outperform AR$2$ in terms of objective\nevaluations, derivative evaluations, and subproblem solves. We provide an\nefficient, extensive, and modular MATLAB software package including various\nAR$2$ and AR$3$ variants, allowing ease of use and experimentation for\ninterested users.",

To address this, link\nprediction or knowledge graph completion (KGC) aims to infer missing new facts\nbased on existing facts in KGs. Previous knowledge graph embedding models are\nlimited in their ability to capture expressive features, especially when\ncompared to deeper, multi-layer models. These approaches also assign a single\nstatic embedding to each entity and relation, disregarding the fact that\nentities and relations can exhibit different behaviors in varying graph\ncontexts. Due to complex context over a fact triple of a KG, existing methods\nhave to leverage complex non-linear context encoder, like transformer, to\nproject entity and relation into low dimensional representations, resulting in\nhigh computation cost. To overcome these limitations, we propose Triple\nReceptance Perception (TRP) architecture to model sequential information,\nenabling the learning of dynamic context of entities and relations. Then we use\ntensor decomposition to calculate triple scores, providing robust relational\ndecoding capabilities. This integration allows for more expressive\nrepresentations.

That paper considered\ndifferential-drive robots that are memoryless and unable to compute. Moreover,\nthe robots cannot communicate with one another and are only equipped with a\nsimple sensor that determines whether another robot is directly in front of\nthem. Despite those severe limitations, Gauci et al. introduced a controller\nand proved mathematically that it aggregates a system of two robots for any\ninitial state. Unfortunately, for larger systems, the same controller\naggregates empirically in many cases but not all. Thus, the question of whether\na controller exists that aggregates for any number of robots remains open. In\nthis paper, we show that no such controller exists by investigating the\ngeometric structure of controllers. In addition, we disprove the aggregation\nproof of the paper above for two robots and present an alternative controller\nalongside a simple and rigorous aggregation proof.",

However, existing\nSR methods typically overlook the complementary relationship between global and\nlocal dependencies. These methods either focus on capturing local information\nor prioritize global information, which results in models that are unable to\neffectively capture both global and local features simultaneously. Moreover,\ntheir computational cost becomes prohibitive when applied to large-scale RSIs.\nTo address these challenges, we introduce the novel application of Receptance\nWeighted Key Value (RWKV) to RSI-SR, which captures long-range dependencies\nwith linear complexity. To simultaneously model global and local features, we\npropose the Global-Detail dual-branch structure, GDSR, which performs SR by\nparalleling RWKV and convolutional operations to handle large-scale RSIs.\nFurthermore, we introduce the Global-Detail Reconstruction Module (GDRM) as an\nintermediary between the two branches to bridge their complementary roles. In\naddition, we propose the Dual-Group Multi-Scale Wavelet Loss, a wavelet-domain\nconstraint mechanism via dual-group subband strategy and cross-resolution\nfrequency alignment for enhanced reconstruction fidelity in RSI-SR. Extensive\nexperiments under two degradation methods on several benchmarks, including AID,\nUCMerced, and RSSRD-QH, demonstrate that GSDR outperforms the state-of-the-art\nTransformer-based method HAT by an average of 0.09 dB in PSNR, while using only\n63% of its parameters and 51% of its FLOPs, achieving an inference speed 3.2\ntimes faster.",

In this paper, we demonstrate the limitations of such methods\nand rethink what it means for AI to be proactive in multi-party, human-AI\nconversations. We propose that just like humans, rather than merely reacting to\nturn-taking cues, a proactive AI formulates its own inner thoughts during a\nconversation, and seeks the right moment to contribute.

Our framework equips AI\nwith a continuous, covert train of thoughts in parallel to the overt\ncommunication process, which enables it to proactively engage by modeling its\nintrinsic motivation to express these thoughts. We instantiated this framework\ninto two real-time systems: an AI playground web app and a chatbot.

The method will\nbe applied in simulating tasks to select Mars landing sites using a selecting\nsmall-scale area of the Mars analaogue the evaporite region of Qaidam Basin,\nQinghai-Tibet Plateau. This learning process minimizes discriminative loss\nfunction, which makes the similarity measure smaller for images from the same\nlocation and larger for images from different locations. This study selected a\nConvolutional Neural Networks (CNN) based model, which has been trained to\nexplain various changes in image appearance and identify different landforms in\nMars. By identifying different landforms, priority landing sites on Mars can be\nselected.",

    "abstract": "Stable Diffusion has achieved remarkable success in the field of\ntext-to-image generation, with its powerful generative capabilities and diverse\ngeneration results making a lasting impact. However, its iterative denoising\nintroduces high computational costs and slows generation speed, limiting\nbroader adoption. The community has made numerous efforts to reduce this\ncomputational burden, with methods like feature caching attracting attention\ndue to their effectiveness and simplicity. Nonetheless, simply reusing features\ncomputed at previous timesteps causes the features across adjacent timesteps to\nbecome similar, reducing the dynamics of features over time and ultimately\ncompromising the quality of generated images. In this paper, we introduce a\ndynamics-aware token pruning (DaTo) approach that addresses the limitations of\nfeature caching. DaTo selectively prunes tokens with lower dynamics, allowing\nonly high-dynamic tokens to participate in self-attention layers, thereby\nextending feature dynamics across timesteps. DaTo combines feature caching with\ntoken pruning in a training-free manner, achieving both temporal and token-wise\ninformation reuse. Applied to Stable Diffusion on the ImageNet, our approach\ndelivered a 9$\\times$ speedup while reducing FID by 0.33, indicating enhanced\nimage quality. On the COCO-30k, we observed a 7$\\times$ acceleration coupled\nwith a notable FID reduction of 2.17.",

This paper\naims to investigate Galactic Cepheids across the instability strip in the\nmid-infrared with MATISSE/VLTI in order to constrain the geometry and physical\nnature (gas and/or dust) of their CSEs. We secured observations of eight\nGalactic Cepheids from short up to long period of pulsation, with MATISSE/VLTI\nin $L$, $M$ and $N$-bands. The SED analysis in the mid-IR confirms the absence\nof dust spectral signature for all the star sample.

Finally, the visibilities\nin $L$, $M$ and $N$ bands are in agreement with the expected star angular\ndiameter, although the observations are compatible with the presence of compact\nCSEs within the uncertainties.

In a\nsetting with two nodes, with the first node having access to ${\\bf A}$ and the\nsecond to ${\\bf B}$, we establish bounds on the optimal sum-rate that allows a\nreceiver to compute an important class of non-linear functions, and in\nparticular bilinear functions, including dot products $\\langle {\\bf A},{\\bf\nB}\\rangle$, and general matrix products ${\\bf A}^{\\intercal}{\\bf B}$ over\nfinite fields. The bounds are tight, for large field sizes, for which case we\ncan derive the exact fundamental performance limits for all problem dimensions\nand a large class of sources. Our achievability scheme involves the design of\nnon-linear transformations of ${\\bf A}$ and ${\\bf B}$, which are carefully\ncalibrated to work synergistically with the structured linear encoding scheme\nby K\\\"orner and Marton. The subsequent converse derived here, calibrates the\nHan-Kobayashi approach to yield a relatively tight converse on the sum rate. We\nalso demonstrate unbounded compression gains over Slepian-Wolf coding,\ndepending on the source correlations. In the end, our work derives fundamental\nlimits for distributed computing of a crucial class of functions, succinctly\ncapturing the computation structures and source correlations.\n  Our findings are subsequently applied to the practical\nmaster-workers-receiver framework, where each of $N$ distributed workers has a\nbounded memory reflecting a bounded computational capability. By combining the\nabove scheme with the polynomial code framework, we design novel structured\npolynomial codes for distributed matrix multiplication, and show that our codes\ncan surpass the performance of the existing state of art, while also adapting\nthese new codes to support chain matrix multiplications and\ninformation-theoretically secure computations.",

Automating the generation of privacy computing code with Large\nLanguage Models can streamline development effort and lower the barrier to\nusing privacy computing frameworks. However, existing LLMs still encounter\nchallenges in code translation for privacy-preserving computation, such as\ntranslating Python to MP-SPDZ, due to the scarcity of MP-SPDZ data required for\neffective pre-training or fine-tuning. Moreover, the lack of a benchmark\nfurther complicates the evaluation of translation quality. To address the\nlimitations, this work proposes SPDZCoder, a rule-based framework that combines\nLLMs with expert knowledge for generating privacy-computing code without\nrequiring additional training data. Specifically, SPDZCoder employ a rigorous\nprocedure for collecting high-quality expert knowledge to represent the\nsemantic-expressing differences between Python and MP-SPDZ, and to derive\ntransformation rules for translating Python to MP-SPDZ based on these\nknowledge. Then, SPDZCoder progressively converts Python code into MP-SPDZ code\nusing transformation rules in a three stage pipeline.

In this study, we propose a novel Shape Guided Transformer\nNetwork (SGTN) to accurately extract objects at the instance level. Inspired by\nthe global contextual modeling capacity of the self-attention mechanism, we\npropose an effective transformer encoder termed LSwin, which incorporates\nvertical and horizontal 1D global self-attention mechanisms to obtain better\nglobal-perception capacity for RSIs than the popular local-shifted-window based\nSwin Transformer. To achieve accurate instance mask segmentation, we introduce\na shape guidance module (SGM) to emphasize the object boundary and shape\ninformation. The combination of SGM, which emphasizes the local detail\ninformation, and LSwin, which focuses on the global context relationships,\nachieve excellent RSI instance segmentation. Their effectiveness was validated\nthrough comprehensive ablation experiments. Especially, LSwin is proved better\nthan the popular ResNet and Swin transformer encoder at the same level of\nefficiency. Compared to other instance segmentation methods, our SGTN achieves\nthe highest average precision (AP) scores on two single-class public datasets\n(WHU dataset and BITCC dataset) and a multi-class public dataset (NWPU VHR-10\ndataset).

On the other hand, we propose the\nNon-Aligned Residual (NAR) method by analyzing the audio data, which allows the\nresidual connection can be used in two audio data with different time lengths.\nWe have conducted plentiful experiments on the Spiking Speech Commands (SSC),\nthe Spiking Heidelberg Digits (SHD), and the Google Speech Commands v0.02 (GSC)\ndatasets. According to the experiment results, we have achieved the\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) result 81.02\\% on SSC for the test classification\naccuracy of all SNN models, and we have obtained the SOTA result 96.04\\% on SHD\nfor the classification accuracy of all models.",

The\nachieved nonreciprocal behaviors mostly rely on various dispersive effects in\noptical media, which give rise to dispersive modulations of the transverse beam\nprofile, such as spatial broadening and discretization, of the incident\nsignals. Such deformation inevitably reduces the matching with subsequent\ncomponents for information processing. Here we experimentally demonstrate the\nnonreciprocal transverse localization of light in a moir\\'e photonic lattice\ninduced in atomic vapors. When the probe field is set to co- or\ncounter-propagate with the coupling field formed by superposing two identical\nhoneycomb beams in a certain rotation angle, the output pattern can exhibit\nlocalized or dispersive behavior. The localization in the forward case is\nderived from the moir\\'e structure, and the nonreciprocal behaviors (in both\nbeam size and transmitted intensity) are introduced by the thermal motion of\natoms. The thermal-motion-induced Doppler effect can destroy the coherent\ncondition for electromagnetically induced transparency in the backward case,\nbecause of which the probe beam becomes immune to the modulation of the\ncoupling field. The current work provides an approach to control the transverse\nbeam profile in one-way transmission.",

    "abstract": "The Stochastic Burgers Equation (SBE) is a singular, non-linear Stochastic\nPartial Differential Equation (SPDE) that describes, on mesoscopic scales, the\nfluctuations of stochastic driven diffusive systems with a conserved scalar\nquantity. In space dimension d = 2, the SBE is critical, being formally scale\ninvariant under diffusive scaling. As such, it falls outside of the domain of\napplicability of the theories of Regularity Structures and paracontrolled\ncalculus. In apparent contrast with the formal scale invariance, we fully prove\nthe conjecture first appeared in [H. van Beijeren, R. Kutner, & H. Spohn, Phys.\nRev. Lett., 1986] according to which the 2d-SBE is logarithmically\nsuperdiffusive, i.e. its diffusion coefficient diverges like $(\\log t)^{2/3}$\nas $t\\to\\infty$, thus removing subleading diverging multiplicative corrections\nin [D. De Gaspari & L. Haunschmid-Sibitz, Electron. J. Probab., 2024] and in\n[H.-T. Yau, Ann. of Math., 2004] for 2d-ASEP. We precisely identify the\nconstant prefactor of the logarithm and show it is proportional to\n$\\lambda^{4/3}$, for $\\lambda>0$ the coupling constant, which, intriguingly,\nturns out to be exactly the same as for the one-dimensional Stochastic\nBurgers/KPZ equation. More importantly, we prove that, under super-diffusive\nspace-time rescaling, the SBE has an explicit Gaussian fixed point in the\nRenormalization Group sense, by deriving a superdiffusive central limit-type\ntheorem for its solution.\n  This is the first scaling limit result for a critical singular SPDE, beyond\nthe weak coupling regime, and is obtained via a refined control, on all\nlength-scales, of the resolvent of the generator of the SBE. We believe our\nmethods are well-suited to study other out-of-equilibrium driven diffusive\nsystems at the critical dimension, such as 2d-ASEP, which, we conjecture, have\nthe same large-scale Fixed Point as SBE.",

Overall, the manuscript outlines the development of FMR studies\nalong the two major lines: (i) downscaling from multiple to individual magnetic\nnanoelements and (ii) extending planar nanomagnets into the third dimension.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are becoming essential tools for various natural\nlanguage processing tasks but often suffer from generating outdated or\nincorrect information. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this\nissue by incorporating external, real-time information retrieval to ground LLM\nresponses. However, the existing RAG systems frequently struggle with the\nquality of retrieval documents, as irrelevant or noisy documents degrade\nperformance, increase computational overhead, and undermine response\nreliability. To tackle this problem, we propose Multi-Agent Filtering\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (MAIN-RAG), a training-free RAG framework that\nleverages multiple LLM agents to collaboratively filter and score retrieved\ndocuments. Specifically, MAIN-RAG introduces an adaptive filtering mechanism\nthat dynamically adjusts the relevance filtering threshold based on score\ndistributions, effectively minimizing noise while maintaining high recall of\nrelevant documents. The proposed approach leverages inter-agent consensus to\nensure robust document selection without requiring additional training data or\nfine-tuning. Experimental results across four QA benchmarks demonstrate that\nMAIN-RAG consistently outperforms traditional RAG approaches, achieving a 2-11%\nimprovement in answer accuracy while reducing the number of irrelevant\nretrieved documents. Quantitative analysis further reveals that our approach\nachieves superior response consistency and answer accuracy over baseline\nmethods, offering a competitive and practical alternative to training-based\nsolutions.",

    "abstract": "Demonstrating small error rates by integrating quantum error correction (QEC)\ninto an architecture of quantum computing is the next milestone towards\nscalable fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC). Encoding logical qubits with\nsuperconducting qubits and surface codes is considered a promising candidate\nfor FTQC architectures. In this paper, we propose an FTQC architecture, which\nwe call Q3DE, that enhances the tolerance to multi-bit burst errors (MBBEs) by\ncosmic rays with moderate changes and overhead. There are three core components\nin Q3DE: in-situ anomaly DEtection, dynamic code DEformation, and optimized\nerror DEcoding. In this architecture, MBBEs are detected only from syndrome\nvalues for error correction. The effect of MBBEs is immediately mitigated by\ndynamically increasing the encoding level of logical qubits and re-estimating\nprobable recovery operation with the rollback of the decoding process. We\ninvestigate the performance and overhead of the Q3DE architecture with\nquantum-error simulators and demonstrate that Q3DE effectively reduces the\nperiod of MBBEs by 1000 times and halves the size of their region. Therefore,\nQ3DE significantly relaxes the requirement of qubit density and qubit chip size\nto realize FTQC. Our scheme is versatile for mitigating MBBEs, i.e., temporal\nvariations of error properties, on a wide range of physical devices and FTQC\narchitectures since it relies only on the standard features of topological\nstabilizer codes.",

Traditional QST\nmethods face scalability challenges, requiring $\\mathcal{O}(d^2)$ measurements\nfor a general $d$-dimensional state. This complexity can be substantially\nreduced to $\\mathcal{O}(d)$ in pure state tomography, indicating that full\nmeasurements are unnecessary for pure states. In this paper, we investigate the\nconditions under which a given pure state can be uniquely determined by a\nsubset of full measurements, focusing on the concepts of uniquely determined\namong pure states (UDP) and uniquely determined among all states (UDA). The UDP\ndetermination inherently involves non-convexity challenges, while the UDA\ndetermination, though convex, becomes computationally intensive for\nhigh-dimensional systems. To address these issues, we develop a unified\nframework based on the Augmented Lagrangian Method (ALM). Specifically, our\ntheorem on the existence of low-rank solutions in QST allows us to reformulate\nthe UDA problem with low-rank constraints, thereby reducing the number of\nvariables involved. Our approach entails parameterizing quantum states and\nemploying ALM to handle the constrained non-convex optimization tasks\nassociated with UDP and low-rank UDA determinations. Numerical experiments\nconducted on qutrit systems and four-qubit symmetric states not only validate\ntheoretical findings but also reveal the complete distribution of quantum\nstates across three uniqueness categories: (A) UDA, (B) UDP but not UDA, and\n(C) neither UDP nor UDA.

Existing benchmarks\nhave highlighted the impressive performance of LMMs in text recognition;\nhowever, their abilities in certain challenging tasks, such as text\nlocalization, handwritten content extraction, and logical reasoning, remain\nunderexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce OCRBench v2, a large-scale\nbilingual text-centric benchmark with currently the most comprehensive set of\ntasks (4x more tasks than the previous multi-scene benchmark OCRBench), the\nwidest coverage of scenarios (31 diverse scenarios), and thorough evaluation\nmetrics, with 10,000 human-verified question-answering pairs and a high\nproportion of difficult samples. Moreover, we construct a private test set with\n1,500 manually annotated images. The consistent evaluation trends observed\nacross both public and private test sets validate the OCRBench v2's\nreliability. After carefully benchmarking state-of-the-art LMMs, we find that\nmost LMMs score below 50 (100 in total) and suffer from five-type limitations,\nincluding less frequently encountered text recognition, fine-grained\nperception, layout perception, complex element parsing, and logical reasoning.\nThe project website is at: https://99franklin.github.io/ocrbench_v2/",

    "abstract": "With the widespread application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in human\nsociety, enabling AI to autonomously align with human values has become a\npressing issue to ensure its sustainable development and benefit to humanity.\nOne of the most important aspects of aligning with human values is the\nnecessity for agents to autonomously make altruistic, safe, and ethical\ndecisions, considering and caring for human well-being. Current AI extremely\npursues absolute superiority in certain tasks, remaining indifferent to the\nsurrounding environment and other agents, which has led to numerous safety\nrisks. Altruistic behavior in human society originates from humans' capacity\nfor empathizing others, known as Theory of Mind (ToM), combined with predictive\nimaginative interactions before taking action to produce thoughtful and\naltruistic behaviors. Inspired by this, we are committed to endow agents with\nconsiderate self-imagination and ToM capabilities, driving them through\nimplicit intrinsic motivations to autonomously align with human altruistic\nvalues. By integrating ToM within the imaginative space, agents keep an eye on\nthe well-being of other agents in real time, proactively anticipate potential\nrisks to themselves and others, and make thoughtful altruistic decisions that\nbalance negative effects on the environment. The ancient Chinese story of Sima\nGuang Smashes the Vat illustrates the moral behavior of the young Sima Guang\nsmashed a vat to save a child who had accidentally fallen into it, which is an\nexcellent reference scenario for this paper. We design an experimental scenario\nsimilar to Sima Guang Smashes the Vat and its variants with different\ncomplexities, which reflects the trade-offs and comprehensive considerations\nbetween self-goals, altruistic rescue, and avoiding negative side effects.",

To address this challenge, we introduce an\nefficient encoder-decoder model that extracts coarse-to-fine embedding vectors\nwhich are semantically aligned across the two modalities without supervision\nfor the alignment. There is another challenge of learning to capture\nfine-grained information with only person IDs as supervision, where similar\nbody parts of different individuals are considered different due to the lack of\npart-level supervision. To tackle this, we propose a novel ranking loss, dubbed\ncommonality-based margin ranking loss, which quantifies the degree of\ncommonality of each body part and reflects it during the learning of\nfine-grained body part details.

    "abstract": "Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a powerful technique that enhances\ndownstream task execution by retrieving additional information, such as\nknowledge, skills, and tools from external sources. Graph, by its intrinsic\n\"nodes connected by edges\" nature, encodes massive heterogeneous and relational\ninformation, making it a golden resource for RAG in tremendous real-world\napplications. As a result, we have recently witnessed increasing attention on\nequipping RAG with Graph, i.e., GraphRAG. However, unlike conventional RAG,\nwhere the retriever, generator, and external data sources can be uniformly\ndesigned in the neural-embedding space, the uniqueness of graph-structured\ndata, such as diverse-formatted and domain-specific relational knowledge, poses\nunique and significant challenges when designing GraphRAG for different\ndomains. Given the broad applicability, the associated design challenges, and\nthe recent surge in GraphRAG, a systematic and up-to-date survey of its key\nconcepts and techniques is urgently desired. Following this motivation, we\npresent a comprehensive and up-to-date survey on GraphRAG. Our survey first\nproposes a holistic GraphRAG framework by defining its key components,\nincluding query processor, retriever, organizer, generator, and data source.\nFurthermore, recognizing that graphs in different domains exhibit distinct\nrelational patterns and require dedicated designs, we review GraphRAG\ntechniques uniquely tailored to each domain. Finally, we discuss research\nchallenges and brainstorm directions to inspire cross-disciplinary\nopportunities.

Existing ML-based MILP\nsolvers mainly focus on end-to-end solution learning, which suffers from the\nscalability issue due to the high dimensionality of the solution space. Instead\nof directly learning the optimal solution, this paper aims to learn a reduced\nand equivalent model of the original MILP as an intermediate step. The reduced\nmodel often corresponds to interpretable operations and is much simpler,\nenabling us to solve large-scale MILP problems much faster than existing\ncommercial solvers. However, current approaches rely only on the optimal\nreduced model, overlooking the significant preference information of all\nreduced models. To address this issue, this paper proposes a preference-based\nmodel reduction learning method, which considers the relative performance\n(i.e., objective cost and constraint feasibility) of all reduced models on each\nMILP instance as preferences. We also introduce an attention mechanism to\ncapture and represent preference information, which helps improve the\nperformance of model reduction learning tasks. Moreover, we propose a SetCover\nbased pruning method to control the number of reduced models (i.e., labels),\nthereby simplifying the learning process. Evaluation on real-world MILP\nproblems shows that 1) compared to the state-of-the-art model reduction ML\nmethods, our method obtains nearly 20% improvement on solution accuracy, and 2)\ncompared to the commercial solver Gurobi, two to four orders of magnitude\nspeedups are achieved.",

    "abstract": "Spatiotemporal prediction over graphs (STPG) is challenging, because\nreal-world data suffers from the Out-of-Distribution (OOD) generalization\nproblem, where test data follow different distributions from training ones. To\naddress this issue, Invariant Risk Minimization (IRM) has emerged as a\npromising approach for learning invariant representations across different\nenvironments. However, IRM and its variants are originally designed for\nEuclidean data like images, and may not generalize well to graph-structure data\nsuch as spatiotemporal graphs due to spatial correlations in graphs. To\novercome the challenge posed by graph-structure data, the existing graph OOD\nmethods adhere to the principles of invariance existence, or environment\ndiversity. However, there is little research that combines both principles in\nthe STPG problem. A combination of the two is crucial for efficiently\ndistinguishing between invariant features and spurious ones. In this study, we\nfill in this research gap and propose a diffusion-augmented invariant risk\nminimization (diffIRM) framework that combines these two principles for the\nSTPG problem. Our diffIRM contains two processes: i) data augmentation and ii)\ninvariant learning. In the data augmentation process, a causal mask generator\nidentifies causal features and a graph-based diffusion model acts as an\nenvironment augmentor to generate augmented spatiotemporal graph data. In the\ninvariant learning process, an invariance penalty is designed using the\naugmented data, and then serves as a regularizer for training the\nspatiotemporal prediction model. The real-world experiment uses three human\nmobility datasets, i.e. SafeGraph, PeMS04, and PeMS08. Our proposed diffIRM\noutperforms baselines.",

Previous models struggle to learn\nfeature representations that generalize to various unknown domains from limited\ntraining domain samples. In contrast, the large-scale visual model SAM,\npre-trained on tens of millions of images from various domains and classes,\npossesses excellent generalizability. In this work, we propose a SAM-aware\ngraph prompt reasoning network (GPRN) that fully leverages SAM to guide CD-FSS\nfeature representation learning and improve prediction accuracy. Specifically,\nwe propose a SAM-aware prompt initialization module (SPI) to transform the\nmasks generated by SAM into visual prompts enriched with high-level semantic\ninformation. Since SAM tends to divide an object into many sub-regions, this\nmay lead to visual prompts representing the same semantic object having\ninconsistent or fragmented features. We further propose a graph prompt\nreasoning (GPR) module that constructs a graph among visual prompts to reason\nabout their interrelationships and enable each visual prompt to aggregate\ninformation from similar prompts, thus achieving global semantic consistency.\nSubsequently, each visual prompt embeds its semantic information into the\ncorresponding mask region to assist in feature representation learning. To\nrefine the segmentation mask during testing, we also design a non-parameter\nadaptive point selection module (APS) to select representative point prompts\nfrom query predictions and feed them back to SAM to refine inaccurate\nsegmentation results.

Traditionally,\ncontamination is estimated from spectroscopic follow-up and/or simulations.\nHere, we introduce a novel approach to estimating contamination for Lyman-break\ngalaxy (LBG) samples based on measuring spatial correlation with the parent\npopulation of lower redshift interlopers. We propose two conceptual approaches\napplicable to different survey strategies: a single large contiguous field and\na survey consisting of multiple independent lines of sight. For a large single\nfield, we compute the cross-correlation function between galaxies at redshift\n$z \\sim 6$ and intermediate-redshift galaxies at $z \\sim 1.3$. We apply the\nmethod to the CANDELS GOODS-S and XDF surveys and compare the measurement with\nsimulated mock observations, finding that the contamination level in both cases\nis not measurable and lies below $5.5\\%$ (at $90\\%$ confidence). For\nrandom-pointing multiple field surveys, we measure instead the number count\ncorrelation between high-redshift galaxies and interlopers, as a two-point\ncorrelation analysis is not generally feasible. We show an application to the\nLBG samples at redshift $z \\sim 8$ and the possible interloper population at $z\n\\sim 2$ in the Brightest of Reionizing Galaxies (BoRG) survey. By comparing the\nPearson correlation coefficient with the result from Monte Carlo simulations,\nwe estimate a contamination fraction of $62^{+13}_{-39}\\%$, consistent with\nprevious estimates in the literature.

Since the atmosphere is not fully ionized, upward propagating Alfv\\'enic\nwaves excited by surface convection are affected by ambipolar diffusion. Our\nfiducial run with the nonideal MHD effect for $\\alpha$ Boo gives a\ntime-averaged mass-loss rate, $\\dot{M}=3.3\\times 10^{-11}M_{\\odot}$/yr, which\nis more than one order of magnitude reduced from the result in the ideal MHD\nrun and nicely explains the observational value. Magnetized hot bubbles with\n$T\\gtrsim 10^6$ K are occasionally present simultaneously with cool gas with a\nfew $10^3$ K in the atmosphere because of the thermal instability triggered by\nradiative cooling; there coexist fully ionized plasma emitting soft X-rays and\nmolecules absorbing/emitting infrared radiations. The inhomogeneity in the\natmosphere also causes large temporal variations in $\\dot{M}$ within an\nindividual magnetic flux tube. We also study the effect of magnetic field\nstrength and metallicity, and find that the wind density, and accordingly the\nmass-loss rate, positively and sensitively depends on both of them through the\nambipolar diffusion of Alfv\\'enic waves. The nonideal MHD simulation for\n$\\alpha$ Tau, which is slightly more evolved than $\\alpha$ Boo and has weaker\nmagnetic field, results in weaker wind with $\\dot{M}=1.5\\times\n10^{-12}M_{\\odot}$/yr with $T\\lesssim 10^5$ K throughout the simulation time.\nHowever, given the observations implying the presence of locally strong\nmagnetic fields on the surface of $\\alpha$ Tau, we also conduct a simulation\nwith a field strength twice as strong.

    "abstract": "BLAS is a fundamental building block of advanced linear algebra libraries and\nmany modern scientific computing applications. GPUs are known for their strong\narithmetic computing capabilities and are highly suited for BLAS operations.\nHowever, porting code to GPUs often requires significant effort, especially for\nlarge, complex codes or legacy codes, even for BLAS-heavy applications. While\nvarious tools exist to automatically offload BLAS to GPUs, they are often\nimpractical due to the high costs associated with mandatory data transfers. The\nadvent of unified memory architectures in recent GPU designs, such as the\nNVIDIA Grace-Hopper, allows cache-coherent memory access across all types of\nmemory for both CPU and GPU, potentially eliminating the bottlenecks faced in\nconventional architectures. This breakthrough paves the way for innovative\napplication developments and porting strategies. Building on our preliminary\nwork demonstrating the potential of automatic *gemm offload, this paper extends\nthe framework to all level-3 BLAS operations and introduces SCILIB-Accel, a\nnovel tool for automatic BLAS offload. SCILIB-Accel leverages the memory\ncoherency in Grace-Hopper and introduces a Device First-Use data movement\npolicy inspired by the OpenMP First-Touch approach in multi-socket CPU\nprogramming, minimizing CPU-GPU data transfers for typical scientific computing\ncodes. Additionally, utilizing dynamic binary instrumentation, the tool\nintercepts BLAS symbols directly from a CPU binary, requiring no code\nmodifications or recompilation. SCILIB-Accel has been evaluated using multiple\nquantum physics codes on up to a few hundred GPU nodes, yielding promising\nspeedups. Notably, for the LSMS method in the MuST suite, a 3x speedup was\nachieved on Grace-Hopper compared to Grace-Grace.",

Although experimentalists have identified a number of\npremotor neurons as drivers of forward and reverse motion, how these neurons\nwork together to produce the behaviors observed remains to be understood.\nTowards a better understanding of C. elegans neurodynamics, we present in this\npaper a minimally parameterized, biophysical dynamical systems model of the\npremotor network. Our model consists of a recurrently connected collection of\npremotor neurons (the core group) driven by over a hundred sensory and\ninterneurons that provide diverse feedforward inputs to the core group. It is\ndata-driven in the sense that the choice of neurons in the core group follows\nexperimental guidance, anatomical structures are dictated by the connectome,\nand physiological parameters are deduced from whole-brain imaging and voltage\nclamps data. When simulated with realistic input signals, our model produces\npremotor activity that closely resembles experimental data: from the seemingly\nrandom switching between forward and reversal behaviors to the synchronization\nof subnetworks to various higher-order statistics. We posit that different\nroles are played by gap junctions and synaptic connections in switching\ndynamics.

    "abstract": "This paper is a sequel to an evolving research project on a diagrammatic\nmethodology called thinging machine (TM). Initially, it was proposed as a base\nfor conceptual modelling (e.g., conceptual UML) in areas such as requirement\nengineering. Conceptual modelling involves a high-level representation of a\nreal-world system that integrates various components to refine it into a more\nconcrete (computer) executable form. The TM project has progressed into a more\ncomprehensive approach by applying it in several research areas and expanding\nits theoretical and ontological foundation. Accordingly, the first part of the\npaper involves enhancing some TM aspects related to structuring events in\nexistence, such as absent events. The second part of the paper focuses on how\nto classify events and the kinds of relationships that can be recognized among\nevents. The notion of events has occupied a central role in modelling. It\ninfluences computer science and such diverse disciplines as linguistics,\nprobability theory, artificial intelligence, physics, philosophy and history.\nIn TM, an event is defined as the so-called thimac (thing/machine) with a time\nbreath that infuses dynamism into the static description of the thimac called a\nregion. A region is a diagrammatic specification based on five generic actions:\ncreate, process, release, transfer and receive. The results of this research\nprovide (a) an enrichment of conceptual modelling, especially concerning\nvarieties of existence, e.g., absent events of negative propositions, and (b) a\nproposal that instead of semantic categorizations of events, it is possible to\ndevelop a new type of classification based on graphs grounded on the TM model\ndiagrams.",

The LLM predictions often fail to agree well with human judges --\nindeed, the humans do not fully agree with one another. However, the multiple\nLLM distributions can be $\\textit{combined}$ to $\\textit{predict}$ each human\njudge's annotations on all questions, including a summary question that\nassesses overall quality or relevance. LLM-Rubric accomplishes this by training\na small feed-forward neural network that includes both judge-specific and\njudge-independent parameters. When evaluating dialogue systems in a human-AI\ninformation-seeking task, we find that LLM-Rubric with 9 questions (assessing\ndimensions such as naturalness, conciseness, and citation quality) predicts\nhuman judges' assessment of overall user satisfaction, on a scale of 1--4, with\nRMS error $< 0.5$, a $2\\times$ improvement over the uncalibrated baseline.",

The\nBrauer disc (BD) theorem is then employed to filter out THPD matrices\ncontaining target signals, retaining only clutter-related matrices. These\nclutter matrices undergo eigendecomposition to construct the Grassmann\nmanifold, enabling CCM estimation through the volume cross-correlation function\n(VCF) and gradient descent method. Finally, the filter weight vector is\ncomputed for filtering.

In recent years, self-supervised deep-learning (SSDL) techniques\nhave shown great potential for the studies of CT image reconstruction. In this\nwork, we propose a self-supervised cross-task mutual learning (SS-CTML)\nframework for CT image reconstruction. Specifically, a sparse-view scanned and\na limited-view scanned sinogram data are first extracted from a full-view\nscanned sinogram data, which results in three individual reconstruction tasks,\ni.e., the full-view CT (FVCT) reconstruction, the sparse-view CT (SVCT)\nreconstruction, and limited-view CT (LVCT) reconstruction. Then, three neural\nnetworks are constructed for the three reconstruction tasks. Considering that\nthe ultimate goals of the three tasks are all to reconstruct high-quality CT\nimages, we therefore construct a set of cross-task mutual learning objectives\nfor the three tasks, in which way, the three neural networks can be\nself-supervised optimized by learning from each other. Clinical datasets are\nadopted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

The use of robust losses is a\npopular approach and is known to mitigate the impact of outliers. We bring to\nlight two literatures that have diverged in their ways of designing robust\nlosses: one using M-estimation, which is popular in robotics and computer\nvision, and another using a risk-minimization framework, which is popular in\ndeep learning. We first show that a simple modification of the Black-Rangarajan\nduality provides a unifying view. The modified duality brings out a definition\nof a robust loss kernel $\\sigma$ that is satisfied by robust losses in both the\nliteratures. Secondly, using the modified duality, we propose an Adaptive\nAlternation Algorithm (AAA) for training machine learning models with outliers.\nThe algorithm iteratively trains the model by using a weighted version of the\nnon-robust loss, while updating the weights at each iteration. The algorithm is\naugmented with a novel parameter update rule by interpreting the weights as\ninlier probabilities, and obviates the need for complex parameter tuning.\nThirdly, we investigate convergence of the adaptive alternation algorithm to\noutlier-free optima.

Additionally, the proposed approach\nenables synthesis of high-resolution and distortion-free $R_{2}^{*}$-weighted\nimages.\n  Conclusion: This study demonstrates the feasibility of using multi-echo\nradial FLASH combined with calibrationless model-based reconstruction for\nmotion-robust, distortion-free $R_{2}^{*}$ mapping of the fetal brain at 3T,\nachieving a nominal resolution of $1.1 \\times 1.1 \\times 3$ mm$^{3}$ within 2\nseconds per slice.",

    "abstract": "We study the asymmetric interaction of wave-like velocity perturbation with a\ncoronal current sheet (CS) in the presence of resistivity, thermal conduction\n(TC) and radiative cooling (RC). We analyze the dynamics and energetics of CS\nin four cases, namely, (i) no energy loss, (ii) TC only, (iii) RC only and,\n(iv) TC+RC. Before fragmentation, thinning and elongation of the CS are found\nto be identical in all four cases and therefore independent of presence or\nabsence of energy loss effects. Onset times, corresponding Lundquist numbers\nand aspect ratios suggest that TC advances the onset of fragmentation while RC\nhas the opposite effect in comparison to absence of energy losses. Reconnection\ntakes place at a higher rate in presence of TC and TC+RC in the tearing\nunstable CS. The speed of plasmoids are also found to be higher under the\neffect of TC and TC+RC. In presence of TC and TC+RC, average density becomes\nhigher within the tearing unstable CS than in other two cases. As expected,\nestimated average temperature is increasing with highest and lowest rate in\nabsence of energy losses and in presence of both TC and RC respectively. After\nthe onset of fragmentation, the rate of decrement of average magnetic energy\ndensity and increment of average kinetic energy density becomes higher in\npresence of TC and TC+RC than in other two cases. Thus we conclude that\npresence of energy loss mechanisms critically influence the dynamics,\nenergetics, and plasmoid formation within a reconnecting coronal CS.",

    "abstract": "Predicting missing facts for temporal knowledge graphs (TKGs) is a\nfundamental task, called temporal knowledge graph completion (TKGC). One key\nchallenge in this task is the imbalance in data distribution, where facts are\nunevenly spread across entities and timestamps. This imbalance can lead to poor\ncompletion performance or long-tail entities and timestamps, and unstable\ntraining due to the introduction of false negative samples. Unfortunately, few\nprevious studies have investigated how to mitigate these effects. Moreover, for\nthe first time, we found that existing methods suffer from model preferences,\nrevealing that entities with specific properties (e.g., recently active) are\nfavored by different models. Such preferences will lead to error accumulation\nand further exacerbate the effects of imbalanced data distribution, but are\noverlooked by previous studies. To alleviate the impacts of imbalanced data and\nmodel preferences, we introduce Booster, the first data augmentation strategy\nfor TKGs. The unique requirements here lie in generating new samples that fit\nthe complex semantic and temporal patterns within TKGs, and identifying\nhard-learning samples specific to models. Therefore, we propose a hierarchical\nscoring algorithm based on triadic closures within TKGs. By incorporating both\nglobal semantic patterns and local time-aware structures, the algorithm enables\npattern-aware validation for new samples. Meanwhile, we propose a two-stage\ntraining approach to identify samples that deviate from the model's preferred\npatterns. With a well-designed frequency-based filtering strategy, this\napproach also helps to avoid the misleading of false negatives. Experiments\njustify that Booster can seamlessly adapt to existing TKGC models and achieve\nup to an 8.7% performance improvement.",

While traditional FGIR\ndeals with classifying different species, UFGIR goes beyond by classifying\nsub-categories within a species such as cultivars of a plant. In recent times\nthe usage of Vision Transformer-based backbones has allowed methods to obtain\noutstanding recognition performances in this task but this comes at a\nsignificant cost in terms of computation specially since this task\nsignificantly benefits from incorporating higher resolution images. Therefore,\ntechniques such as token reduction have emerged to reduce the computational\ncost.

Through structured\nexperiments, we examine the influence of hyperparameters such as learning rate,\nbatch size, and epochs on accuracy, F1-score, and loss. Polynomial regression\nanalyses capture foundational and incremental impacts of these hyperparameters,\nfocusing on fine-tuning adjustments relative to a baseline model.\n  Results reveal variability in metrics due to hyperparameter configurations,\nshowing trade-offs among performance metrics. For example, a higher learning\nrate reduces loss in relative analysis (p=0.027) but challenges accuracy\nimprovements. Meanwhile, batch size significantly impacts accuracy and F1-score\nin absolute regression (p=0.028 and p=0.005) but has limited influence on loss\noptimization (p=0.170). The interaction between epochs and batch size maximizes\nF1-score (p=0.001), underscoring the importance of hyperparameter interplay.\n  These findings highlight the need for fine-tuning strategies addressing\nnon-linear hyperparameter interactions to balance performance across metrics.\nSuch variability and metric trade-offs are relevant for tasks beyond text\nclassification, including NLP and computer vision.

Here I summarize various physical\nfactors that can shape the duration of a GRB and propose that the duration of a\nGRB can be defined by four factors: progentor, central engine, emitter, and\ngeometry. The progenitor-defined duration is only relevant when the central\nengine is powered by accretion and when the modifications by other factors are\nnot important. The untidy situation of duration - progenitor mismatches\nsuggests that other factors likely play important roles in defining GRB\nduration at least in some GRBs. In particular, a GRB may not be powered by\naccretion but rather by a millisecond magnetar at least for some GRBs. The\ncomplicated lightcurve of GRB 211211A suggests both progenitor- and\nengine-defined durations, which may require a new type of progenitor system\ninvolving a white dwarf - neutron star merger with a magnetar merger product.\nThe single broad pulse lightcurve with well-behaved energy-dependent behavior\nof GRB 230307A suggests an emitter-defined long duration. The central engine\ntimescale may be short enough to be accommodated within the framework of a\nstandard binary neutron star merger. Its spiky lightcurve with fast variability\nas well as extended X-ray emission suggest the existence of mini-jets in the\nglobal dissipation region, powered by an underlying magnetar.",

To address these issues, this\nwork proposes the CRRG-CLIP Model (Chest Radiology Report Generation and\nRadiograph Classification Model), an end-to-end model for automated report\ngeneration and radiograph classification. The model consists of two modules:\nthe radiology report generation module and the radiograph classification\nmodule.

The classification module uses the\nunsupervised Contrastive Language Image Pretraining (CLIP) model, addressing\nthe challenges of high-cost labelled datasets and insufficient features. The\nresults show that the generation module performs comparably to high-performance\nbaseline models on BLEU, METEOR, and ROUGE-L metrics, and outperformed the\nGPT-4o model on BLEU-2, BLEU-3, BLEU-4, and ROUGE-L metrics.

We derive the late-time dynamics of the detector in the context of open\nquantum system, and capture the path distinguishability and thermodynamic\nirreversibility of detector thermalization process by using quantum relative\nentropy (QRE). We find that beyond the Planckian transition rate, the refined\nthermalization process in detector Hilbert space can be distinguished by the\ntime behavior of the related QRE. We show that the exotic position-dependent\nbehaviors of the QRE emerge corresponding to different choices of black hole\nvacua (i.e., the Boulware, Hartle-Hawking, and Unruh vacua). Finally, from a\nperspective of quantum thermodynamics, we recast the free energy change of the\nUDW detector undergoing Hawking radiation into an entropic combination form,\nwhere the classical Kullback-Leibler divergence and quantum coherence are\npresented in specific QRE-like forms. With growing Hawking temperature, we find\nthat the consumption rate of quantum coherence is larger than that of its\nclassical counterpart.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated a remarkable ability to\ncapture extensive world knowledge, yet how this is achieved without direct\nsensorimotor experience remains a fundamental puzzle. This study proposes a\nnovel theoretical solution by introducing the Collective World Model\nhypothesis. We argue that an LLM does not learn a world model from scratch;\ninstead, it learns a statistical approximation of a collective world model that\nis already implicitly encoded in human language through a society-wide process\nof embodied, interactive sense-making. To formalize this process, we introduce\ngenerative emergent communication (Generative EmCom), a framework built on the\nCollective Predictive Coding (CPC). This framework models the emergence of\nlanguage as a process of decentralized Bayesian inference over the internal\nstates of multiple agents. We argue that this process effectively creates an\nencoder-decoder structure at a societal scale: human society collectively\nencodes its grounded, internal representations into language, and an LLM\nsubsequently decodes these symbols to reconstruct a latent space that mirrors\nthe structure of the original collective representations. This perspective\nprovides a principled, mathematical explanation for how LLMs acquire their\ncapabilities. The main contributions of this paper are: 1) the formalization of\nthe Generative EmCom framework, clarifying its connection to world models and\nmulti-agent reinforcement learning, and 2) its application to interpret LLMs,\nexplaining phenomena such as distributional semantics as a natural consequence\nof representation reconstruction.

Overall rail freight experienced a rapid rebound following the\nprecipitous drop in traffic in March and April 2020, achieving a near-full\nrecovery in five months. As the recovery proceeded through 2020, intermodal\nflow, containers moving by rail for their longest overland trips, rebounded\nstrongly, some exceeding 2019 levels.

Using the algebraic\napproach of quantum field theory on curved spacetime, we derive the precise\nexpression for the expected number of entangling particles in the scalar field\ncase. This expression establishes the relation between the decoherence and the\nlocal two-point correlation function. Specifically, we analyze the quantum\nsuperposition Gendankenexperiment performed by a local observer at the center\nof dS spacetime. We compute the entangling particle numbers in scalar field,\nelectromagnetic field, and gravitational field scenarios. It is demonstrated\nthat the quantum spatial superposition state can be decohered by emitting\nentangling particles into the cosmological horizon. Our setup is equivalent to\nan accelerating observer in 5-dimensional Minkowski spacetime. The results for\nthe scalar and electromagnetic cases are consistent with those obtained in\nRef.[1], which investigated the decoherence effect from the perspective of an\naccelerating observer in Minkovski spacetime. However, our result fixes the\nnumerical prefactor of the gravitational decoherence.",

    "abstract": "The ongoing technological revolution in measurement systems enables the\nacquisition of high-resolution samples in fields such as engineering, biology,\nand medicine. However, these observations are often subject to errors from\nmeasurement devices. Motivated by this challenge, we propose a denoising\nframework that employs diffusion models to generate denoised data whose\ndistribution closely approximates the unobservable, error-free data, thereby\npermitting standard data analysis based on the denoised data. The key element\nof our framework is a novel Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space-based method that\ntrains the diffusion model with only error-contaminated data, admits a\nclosed-form solution, and achieves a fast convergence rate in terms of\nestimation error. Furthermore, we verify the effectiveness of our method by\nderiving an upper bound on the Kullback--Leibler divergence between the\ndistributions of the generated denoised data and the error-free data. A series\nof conducted simulations also verify the promising empirical performance of the\nproposed method compared to other state-of-the-art methods. To further\nillustrate the potential of this denoising framework in a real-world\napplication, we apply it in a digital health context, showing how measurement\nerror in continuous glucose monitors can influence conclusions drawn from a\nclinical trial on diabetes Mellitus disease.",

These vehicles have sophisticated sensors, advanced\nalgorithms, and powerful computing systems that allow them to navigate and\noperate without direct human intervention. However, AVs' systems still get\noverwhelmed when they encounter a complex dynamic change in the environment\nresulting from an accident or a roadblock for maintenance. The advanced\nfeatures of Sixth Generation (6G) technology are set to offer strong support to\nAVs, enabling real-time data exchange and management of complex driving\nmaneuvers. This paper proposes a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL)\nframework to improve AVs' decision-making in dynamic and complex Intelligent\nTransportation Systems (ITS) utilizing 6G-V2X communication. The primary\nobjective is to enable AVs to avoid roadblocks efficiently by changing lanes\nwhile maintaining optimal traffic flow and maximizing the mean harmonic speed.\nTo ensure realistic operations, key constraints such as minimum vehicle speed,\nroadblock count, and lane change frequency are integrated. We train and test\nthe proposed MARL model with two traffic simulation scenarios using the SUMO\nand TraCI interface. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate that the\nproposed model adapts to various traffic conditions and achieves efficient and\nrobust traffic flow management. The trained model effectively navigates dynamic\nroadblocks, promoting improved traffic efficiency in AV operations with more\nthan 70% efficiency over other benchmark solutions.",

    "abstract": "The spontaneous switching of a quantum particle between the wells of a\ndouble-well potential is a phenomenon of general interest to physics and\nchemistry. It was broadly believed that the switching rate decreases steadily\nwith the size of the energy barrier. This view was challenged by a recent\nexperiment on a driven superconducting Kerr nonlinear oscillator (often called\nthe Kerr-cat qubit or the Kerr parametric oscillator), whose energy barrier can\nbe increased by ramping up the drive. Remarkably, as the drive amplitude\nincreases, the switching rate exhibits a step-like decrease termed the\n\"staircase\". The view challenged by the experiment demands a deep review of our\nunderstanding of quantum effects in double wells. In this work, we derive a\nsemi-analytical formula for the switching rate that resolves a continuous\ntransition between tunneling- and dissipation-dominated dynamics. These two\ndynamics are observed respectively in the flat and the steep parts of each step\nin the staircase. Our formula exposes two distinct dissipative processes that\nlimit tunneling: dephasing and decay. This allows us to predict the critical\ndrive amplitudes where steps occur. In addition, we show that in the regime of\na few states in the well and under moderate to low temperatures, highly excited\nstates are populated predominantly via cascaded and direct thermal heating\nrather than quantum heating. At very low temperatures, however, the\nperturbation induced by the nonhermitian Hamiltonian becomes important and\nfacilitates a new form of quantum heating. We numerically map the activation\nmechanism as a function of drive amplitude, damping rate, and temperature. Our\ntheory deepens the understanding of switching dynamics between metastable\nquantum states, highlights the importance of a general interplay between\ntunneling and dissipation, and identifies a novel quantum regime in activated\ntransitions.",

However, beyond a certain\nthreshold (temperature >= 0.3), the relationship between randomness and\nperformance becomes unpredictable, diminishing the gains from prompt\ncomplexity.\n  These findings suggest that, while GPT-4 shows promise for clinical\nassessment, the configuration of the prompts and model parameters requires\ncareful calibration to ensure consistent results. This preliminary study\ncontributes to understanding the dynamics between prompt engineering and large\nlanguage models, offering insights for future development of AI-powered tools\nin clinical settings.",

However, while scientific machine\nlearning (SciML) has shown considerable promise, most studies in this field are\nlimited to simple geometries, and complex, real-world scenarios are\nunderexplored. This paper addresses this gap by benchmarking diverse SciML\nmodels, including neural operators and vision transformer-based foundation\nmodels, for fluid flow prediction over intricate geometries. Using a\nhigh-fidelity dataset of steady-state flows across various geometries, we\nevaluate the impact of geometric representations -- Signed Distance Fields\n(SDF) and binary masks -- on model accuracy, scalability, and generalization.\nCentral to this effort is the introduction of a novel, unified scoring\nframework that integrates metrics for global accuracy, boundary layer fidelity,\nand physical consistency to enable a robust, comparative evaluation of model\nperformance. Our findings demonstrate that newer foundation models\nsignificantly outperform neural operators, particularly in data-limited\nscenarios, and that SDF representations yield superior results with sufficient\ntraining data. Despite these promises, all models struggle with\nout-of-distribution generalization, highlighting a critical challenge for\nfuture SciML applications.

    "abstract": "A quantum Latin square is an $n \\times n$ array of unit vectors where each\nrow and column forms an orthonormal basis of a fixed complex vector space. We\nintroduce the notion of $(G,G')$-invariant quantum Latin squares for finite\ngroups $G$ and $G'$. These are quantum Latin squares with rows and columns\nindexed by $G$ and $G'$ respectively such that the inner product of the\n$a,b$-entry with the $c,d$-entry depends only on $a^{-1}c \\in G$ and $b^{-1}d\n\\in G'$. This definition is motivated by the notion of group invariant\nbijective correlations introduced in [Roberson \\& Schmidt (2020)], and every\ngroup invariant quantum Latin square produces a group invariant bijective\ncorrelation, though the converse does not hold. In this work we investigate\nthese group invariant quantum Latin squares and their corresponding\ncorrelations. Our main result is that, up to applying a global isometry to\nevery vector in a $(G,G')$-invariant quantum Latin square, there is a natural\nbijection between these objects and trace and conjugate transpose preserving\nisomorphisms between the group algebras of $G$ and $G'$. This in particular\nproves that a $(G,G')$-invariant quantum Latin square exists if and only if the\nmultisets of degrees of irreducible representations are equal for $G$ and $G'$.\nAnother motivation for this line of work is that whenever Cayley graphs for\ngroups $G$ and $G'$ are quantum isomorphic, then there is a $(G,G')$-invariant\nquantum correlation witnessing this, and thus it suffices to consider such\ncorrelations when searching for quantum isomorphic Cayley graphs. Given a group\ninvariant quantum correlation, we show how to construct all pairs of graphs for\nwhich it gives a quantum isomorphism.",

Our somewhat surprising findings, based on both theoretic and\nexperimental studies, reveal that for the case with zero drift, modest latent\nrepresentation errors can in fact function as implicit regularization and hence\nresult in improved robustness. We further propose a Jacobian regularization\nscheme to mitigate the compounding error propagation effects of non-zero drift,\nthereby enhancing training stability and robustness.

Meanwhile, in the age of AI-generated content\n(AIGC), many image generation models are capable of producing harmful content,\nsuch as images containing sexual or violent material. Thus, it becomes crucial\nto identify such unsafe images based on established safety rules. Pre-trained\nMultimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offer potential in this regard, given\ntheir strong pattern recognition abilities. Existing approaches typically\nfine-tune MLLMs with human-labeled datasets, which however brings a series of\ndrawbacks. First, relying on human annotators to label data following intricate\nand detailed guidelines is both expensive and labor-intensive. Furthermore,\nusers of safety judgment systems may need to frequently update safety rules,\nmaking fine-tuning on human-based annotation more challenging. This raises the\nresearch question: Can we detect unsafe images by querying MLLMs in a zero-shot\nsetting using a predefined safety constitution (a set of safety rules)? Our\nresearch showed that simply querying pre-trained MLLMs does not yield\nsatisfactory results. This lack of effectiveness stems from factors such as the\nsubjectivity of safety rules, the complexity of lengthy constitutions, and the\ninherent biases in the models. To address these challenges, we propose a\nMLLM-based method includes objectifying safety rules, assessing the relevance\nbetween rules and images, making quick judgments based on debiased token\nprobabilities with logically complete yet simplified precondition chains for\nsafety rules, and conducting more in-depth reasoning with cascaded\nchain-of-thought processes if necessary.

Producers compete \\`a la\nCournot, by choosing the quantities of good to supply to each market they have\naccess to in order to maximize their profit. Every market is characterized by\nits inverse demand functions returning the unit price of the considered good as\na function of the total available quantity. Markets are interconnected by a\ndispatch network through which quantities of the considered good can flow\nwithin finite capacity constraints. Such flows are determined by the market\nmaker, who aims at maximizing a designated welfare function. We model such\ncompetition as a strategic game with $n+1$ players: the producers and the\nmarket game. For this game, we first establish the existence of Nash equilibria\nunder standard concavity assumptions. We then identify sufficient conditions\nfor the game to be potential with an essentially unique Nash equilibrium. Next,\nwe present a general result that connects the optimal action of the market\nmaker with the capacity constraints imposed on the network. For the commonly\nused Walrasian welfare, our finding proves a connection between capacity\nbottlenecks in the market network and the emergence of price differences\nbetween markets separated by saturated lines.

However, artificial\nintelligence (AI) sepsis prediction models typically generate a single sepsis\nrisk score without incorporating clinical calculators for assessing organ\ndysfunctions, making the models less convincing and transparent to clinicians.\nTo bridge the gap, we propose to mimic clinicians' workflow with a novel\nframework SepsisCalc to integrate clinical calculators into the predictive\nmodel, yielding a clinically transparent and precise model for utilization in\nclinical settings. Practically, clinical calculators usually combine\ninformation from multiple component variables in Electronic Health Records\n(EHR), and might not be applicable when the variables are (partially) missing.\nWe mitigate this issue by representing EHRs as temporal graphs and integrating\na learning module to dynamically add the accurately estimated calculator to the\ngraphs.
