    "abstract": "Combining query answering and data science workloads has become prevalent. An\nimportant class of such workloads is top-k queries with a scoring function\nimplemented as an opaque UDF - a black box whose internal structure and scores\non the search domain are unavailable. Some typical examples include costly\ncalls to fuzzy classification and regression models. The models may also be\nchanged in an ad-hoc manner. Since the algorithm does not know the scoring\nfunction's behavior on the input data, opaque top-k queries become expensive to\nevaluate exactly or speed up by indexing. Hence, we propose an approximation\nalgorithm for opaque top-k query answering. Our proposed solution is a\ntask-independent hierarchical index and a novel bandit algorithm. The index\nclusters elements by some cheap vector representation then builds a tree of the\nclusters. Our bandit is a diminishing returns submodular epsilon-greedy bandit\nalgorithm that maximizes the sum of the solution set's scores. Our bandit\nmodels the distribution of scores in each arm using a histogram, then targets\narms with fat tails. We prove that our bandit algorithm approaches a constant\nfactor of the optimal algorithm. We evaluate our standalone library on large\nsynthetic, image, and tabular datasets over a variety of scoring functions. Our\nmethod accelerates the time required to achieve nearly optimal scores by up to\nan order of magnitude compared to exhaustive scan while consistently\noutperforming baseline sampling algorithms.",

    "abstract": "Human-object interaction (HOI) synthesis is important for various\napplications, ranging from virtual reality to robotics. However, acquiring 3D\nHOI data is challenging due to its complexity and high cost, limiting existing\nmethods to the narrow diversity of object types and interaction patterns in\ntraining datasets. This paper proposes a novel zero-shot HOI synthesis\nframework without relying on end-to-end training on currently limited 3D HOI\ndatasets. The core idea of our method lies in leveraging extensive HOI\nknowledge from pre-trained Multimodal Models. Given a text description, our\nsystem first obtains temporally consistent 2D HOI image sequences using image\nor video generation models, which are then uplifted to 3D HOI milestones of\nhuman and object poses. We employ pre-trained human pose estimation models to\nextract human poses and introduce a generalizable category-level 6-DoF\nestimation method to obtain the object poses from 2D HOI images. Our estimation\nmethod is adaptive to various object templates obtained from text-to-3D models\nor online retrieval. A physics-based tracking of the 3D HOI kinematic milestone\nis further applied to refine both body motions and object poses, yielding more\nphysically plausible HOI generation results. The experimental results\ndemonstrate that our method is capable of generating open-vocabulary HOIs with\nphysical realism and semantic diversity.",

An integral\npart of traffic management is understanding the turning movement counts (TMCs)\nat intersections, Accurate TMCs at intersections are crucial for traffic signal\ncontrol, congestion mitigation, and road safety. In general, TMCs are obtained\nusing physical sensors installed at intersections, but this approach can be\ncost-prohibitive and technically challenging, especially for cities with\nextensive road networks.

One approach to understanding model errors is to\nsummarize the common characteristics of error samples. This can be particularly\nchallenging in tasks that utilize unstructured, complex data such as images,\nwhere patterns are not always obvious. Another method is to analyze error\ndistributions across pre-defined categories, which requires analysts to\nhypothesize about potential error causes in advance. Forming such hypotheses\nwithout access to explicit labels or annotations makes it difficult to isolate\nmeaningful subgroups or patterns, however, as analysts must rely on manual\ninspection, prior expertise, or intuition. This lack of structured guidance can\nhinder a comprehensive understanding of where models fail. To address these\nchallenges, we introduce VibE, a semantic error analysis workflow designed to\nidentify where and why computer vision and machine learning (CVML) models fail\nat the subgroup level, even when labels or annotations are unavailable. VibE\nincorporates several core features to enhance error analysis: semantic subgroup\ngeneration, semantic summarization, candidate issue proposals, semantic concept\nsearch, and interactive subgroup analysis. By leveraging large foundation\nmodels (such as CLIP and GPT-4) alongside visual analytics, VibE enables\ndevelopers to semantically interpret and analyze CVML model errors. This\ninteractive workflow helps identify errors through subgroup discovery, supports\nhypothesis generation with auto-generated subgroup summaries and suggested\nissues, and allows hypothesis validation through semantic concept search and\ncomparative analysis. Through three diverse CVML tasks and in-depth expert\ninterviews, we demonstrate how VibE can assist error understanding and\nanalysis.",

This challenge also\napplies to domain- or language-specific models, where fine-tuning on\nspecialized data must be redone for every new base model release. In this\npaper, we explore the transfer of fine-tuning updates between model versions.\nSpecifically, we derive the diff vector from one source model version, which\nrepresents the weight changes from fine-tuning, and apply it to the base model\nof a different target version. Through empirical evaluations on various\nopen-weight model versions, we show that transferring diff vectors can\nsignificantly improve the target base model, often achieving performance\ncomparable to its fine-tuned counterpart. For example, reusing the fine-tuning\nupdates from Llama 3.0 8B leads to an absolute accuracy improvement of 10.7% on\nGPQA over the base Llama 3.1 8B without additional training, surpassing Llama\n3.1 8B Instruct. In a multilingual model development setting, we show that this\napproach can significantly increase performance on target-language tasks\nwithout retraining, achieving an absolute improvement of 4.7% and 15.5% on\nGlobal MMLU for Malagasy and Turkish, respectively, compared to Llama 3.1 8B\nInstruct. Our controlled experiments reveal that fine-tuning transfer is most\neffective when the source and target models are linearly connected in the\nparameter space. Additionally, we demonstrate that fine-tuning transfer offers\na stronger and more computationally efficient starting point for further\nfine-tuning. Finally, we propose an iterative recycling-then-finetuning\napproach for continuous model development, which improves both efficiency and\neffectiveness.

In this formulation, the\nmaterial displacement field is uniquely determined by the initial boundary\nvalue problem. The theory naturally satisfies energy balance, with positive\nenergy dissipation rate in accord with the Clausius-Duhem inequality. Notably,\nthese properties are not imposed but follow directly from the constitutive law\nand evolution equation when multiplying the equation of motion by the velocity\nand integrating by parts. In addition to elastic constants, the model requires\nat most three key material parameters: the strain at the onset of nonlinearity,\nthe ultimate tensile strength, and the fracture toughness. The approach\nsimplifies parameter identification while ensuring representation of material\nbehavior. The approach seamlessly handles fracture evolution across loading\nregimes, from quasi-static to dynamic, accommodating both fast crack\npropagation and quasi-brittle failure under monotonic and cyclic loading.\nNumerical simulations show quantitative and qualitative agreement with\nexperiments, including three-point bending tests on concrete.

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in LLMs have revolutionized motion generation models in\nembodied applications. While LLM-type auto-regressive motion generation models\nbenefit from training scalability, there remains a discrepancy between their\ntoken prediction objectives and human preferences. As a result, models\npre-trained solely with token-prediction objectives often generate behaviors\nthat deviate from what humans would prefer, making post-training preference\nalignment crucial for producing human-preferred motions. Unfortunately,\npost-training alignment requires extensive preference rankings of motions\ngenerated by the pre-trained model, which are costly to annotate, especially in\nmulti-agent settings. Recently, there has been growing interest in leveraging\npre-training demonstrations to scalably generate preference data for\npost-training alignment. However, these methods often adopt an adversarial\nassumption, treating all pre-trained model-generated samples as unpreferred\nexamples. This adversarial approach overlooks the valuable signal provided by\npreference rankings among the model's own generations, ultimately reducing\nalignment effectiveness and potentially leading to misaligned behaviors. In\nthis work, instead of treating all generated samples as equally bad, we\nleverage implicit preferences encoded in pre-training demonstrations to\nconstruct preference rankings among the pre-trained model's generations,\noffering more nuanced preference alignment guidance with zero human cost. We\napply our approach to large-scale traffic simulation and demonstrate its\neffectiveness in improving the realism of pre-trained model's generated\nbehaviors, making a lightweight 1M motion generation model comparable to SOTA\nlarge imitation-based models by relying solely on implicit feedback from\npre-training demonstrations, without additional post-training human preference\nannotations or high computational costs.",

Since individual\ndrug use is driven by many unobservable factors, accounting for unobserved\nheterogeneity is crucial for modeling demand and designing targeted public\npolicies. This paper introduces a finite Gaussian mixture of Exact Affine Stone\nIndex (EASI) demand systems to estimate the joint demand for marijuana,\ncocaine, and basuco (cocaine residual or \"crack\") in Colombia, accounting for\ncorner solutions and endogenous price variation. Our results highlight the\nimportance of unobserved heterogeneity in identifying reliable price\nelasticities. The method reveals two regular consumer subpopulations: \"safe\"\n(recreational) and \"addict\" users, with the majority falling into the first\ngroup. For the \"safe\" group, whose estimates are precise and nationally\nrepresentative, all three drugs exhibit unitary price elasticities, with\ncocaine being complementary to marijuana and basuco an inferior substitute to\ncocaine. Given the low production cost of marijuana in Colombia, legalization\nis likely to drive prices down significantly. Our counterfactual analysis\nsuggests that a 50% price decrease would result in a \\$363 USD gain in\nutility-equivalent expenditure per representative consumer, \\$120 million USD\nin government tax revenue, and a \\$127 million USD revenue loss for drug\ndealers.

This is typically\nachieved by using a rigid substrate and two independent actuators. However,\nthis framework is unable to establish different motion conditions in different\nregions of the substrate, achieving spatial variability and selectivity, since\nthis would violate the rigid-body assumption and require a proliferation of\nactuation channels. Challenging this paradigm, we leverage the inherent\nelasticity of the substrate to provide the modal and spatial diversity required\nto establish the desired regimes. To this end, we design deformable substrates\nexhibiting a rich landscape of deformation modes, and we exploit their\nmulti-modal response to switch between drop motion regimes and select desired\nspatial patterns, using the excitation frequency as our tuning parameter.",

Here we focus on the\ncontext where food harvesting is first preceded by a separate exploration\nperiod. Foraging then consists of three distinct steps: (1) exploration of the\nlandscape (site-generation), (2) selection of a foraging site (site-selection),\nand (3) exploitation (harvesting) through repeated trips between the foraging\nsite and \"home base\". This type of foraging has received scant attention by\nmodellers, leading to two main knowledge gaps. First, little is known about how\norganisms implement steps (1) and (2). Second, it is not known how the choice\nof implementation method affects the outcomes of step (3). We investigate these\ntwo gaps using an agent-based model, with bumble bees as our model organism,\nforaging in a patchy resource landscape of crop, wildflower, and empty cells.\nWe tested two different site-generation methods (random and circular foray\nexploration behaviour) and four different site-selection methods (random and\noptimizing based on distance from the nest, local wildflower density, or net\nrate of energy return) on a variety of outcomes from the site-constant\nharvesting step. We find that site-selection method has a high impact on crop\npollination services as well as the percent of crop resources collected, while\nsite-generation method has a high impact on the percent of time spent\nharvesting and the total trip time. We also find that some of the patterns we\nidentify can be used to infer how a given real organism is identifying a\nforaging site.

    "abstract": "Studying peer relationships is crucial in solving complex challenges\nunderserved communities face and designing interventions. The effectiveness of\nsuch peer-based interventions relies on accurate network data regarding\nindividual attributes and social influences. However, these datasets are often\ncollected through self-reported surveys, introducing ambiguities in network\nconstruction. These ambiguities make it challenging to fully utilize the\nnetwork data to understand the issues and to design the best interventions. We\npropose and solve two variations of link ambiguities in such network data --\n(i) which among the two candidate links exists, and (ii) if a candidate link\nexists. We design a Graph Attention Network (GAT) that accounts for personal\nattributes and network relationships on real-world data with real and simulated\nambiguities. We also demonstrate that by resolving these ambiguities, we\nimprove network accuracy, and in turn, improve suicide risk prediction. We also\nuncover patterns using GNNExplainer to provide additional insights into vital\nfeatures and relationships. This research demonstrates the potential of Graph\nNeural Networks (GNN) to advance real-world network data analysis facilitating\nmore effective peer interventions across various fields.",

We analyzed, for the first\ntime, the longitudinal in-vivo neurometabolic and morphological changes in\nastrocytes, neurons and microglia in the hippocampus, striatum and cerebellum\nduring the progression of CLD-induced type C HE in the bile duct ligated (BDL)\nrat model. Methods: Wistar rats underwent BDL and their brains were studied\nbefore BDL and at post-operative weeks-2, 4, 6 and 8 using in-vivo 1H-MRS\n(9.4T) of the hippocampus, striatum and cerebellum along with histological\nassessment (astrocytes, microglia, and neurons) and blood biochemistry.\nResults: Across all brain regions, glutamine (Gln) was the first metabolite to\nincrease, followed by a decrease in osmolytes and neurotransmitters. The\ncerebellum was characterized by the highest Gln burden (+134%), elevated\nLactate (+84%) and decreased GABA (-23%), suggesting its increased\nvulnerability. This coincided with pronounced alterations in astrocyte\nmorphology, possibly related to the high Gln load.

We also showed mutual and distinct regional\nmorphological changes in microglia (activation) and neurons (decreased\ndendritic spine density, soma size alterations). Conclusions: Our findings\nhighlight both common and differential metabolic and cellular responses to CLD\nacross the brain regions, with cerebellum and striatum showing differential\nresponses. We also hypothesized that glutamine is one of the initial brain\nmetabolic markers of type C HE, impacting astrocytes and inevitably neurons\ncontributing to cognitive decline.",

To address this, recent advances in\ncausal inference and robust learning have introduced strategies such as\ninvariant causal prediction and anchor regression. While these approaches have\nbeen explored for traditional structural equation models (SEMs), their\nextension to functional systems remains limited. This paper develops a risk\nminimization framework for functional SEMs using linear, potentially unbounded\noperators.

The case of\nprincipal ideals (i.e., $m=1$) corresponds to the more familiar absolute\nirreducibility testing of polynomials, where the seminal work of (Kaltofen\n1995) yields a randomized, polynomial time algorithm for this problem. However,\nwhen $m > 1$, the complexity of the primality testing problem seems much\nharder.

For these\nclasses of ideals, assuming the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis, we show that\nprimality testing lies in $\\Sigma_3^p \\cap \\Pi_3^p$. This significantly\nimproves the upper bound for these classes, approaching their lower bound, as\nthe primality testing problem is coNP-hard for these classes of ideals.

A strong\nenhancement of ferromagnetic correlations between pseudospins is observed in\nthe spin-polarized (3 Tesla) phase up to about 60 GPa. Higher pressures drive a\nspin transition into a low-spin state destroying the $J_{\\rm eff}=\\frac{1}{2}$\nlocal moments required to map the spin Hamiltonian into Kitaev's model. The\nspin transition strongly suppresses the low-temperature magnetic susceptibility\nand appears to stabilize a paramagnetic phase driven by frustration. Although\napplied pressure fails to realize a KQSL state, the possible emergence of\nfrustrated magnetism of localized, low-spin $S=\\frac{1}{2}$ moments opens the\ndoor for exploration of novel magnetic quantum states in compressed honeycomb\nlattices of divalent cobaltates.",

We investigate these questions in the high-stakes\ncontext of undergraduate admissions at a selective university by comparing\nlexical and sentence variation between essays written by 30,000 applicants to\ntwo types of LLM-generated essays: one prompted with only the essay question\nused by the human applicants; and another with additional demographic\ninformation about each applicant. We consistently find that both types of\nLLM-generated essays are linguistically distinct from human-authored essays,\nregardless of the specific model and analytical approach. Further, prompting a\nspecific sociodemographic identity is remarkably ineffective in aligning the\nmodel with the linguistic patterns observed in human writing from this identity\ngroup. This holds along the key dimensions of sex, race, first-generation\nstatus, and geographic location. The demographically prompted and unprompted\nsynthetic texts were also more similar to each other than to the human text,\nmeaning that prompting did not alleviate homogenization. These issues of model\nalignment and steerability in current LLMs raise concerns about the use of LLMs\nin high-stakes contexts.",

The quantum approximate optimization algorithm\n(QAOA) is particularly well adapted for such a \"warm start\" approach, and can\nbe combined with the powerful classical Goemans-Williamson (GW) algorithms\nbased on semi-definite programming. Nonetheless, the best way to leverage the\npower of the QAOA remains an open question. Here we propose a general model\nthat describes a class of QAOA variants, and use it to explore routes to\nquantum advantages in a canonical optimization problem, MaxCut. For these\nalgorithms we derive analytic expectation values of the cost Hamiltonian for\nthe MaxCut problem in the level-1 case. Using these analytic results we obtain\nreliable averages over many instances for fairly large numbers of qubits. We\nfind that the warm start adaptive-bias QAOA (WS-ab-QAOA) initialized by the GW\nalgorithm outperforms previously proposed warm start variants on problems with\n$40$ to $180$ qubits. To assess whether a quantum advantage exists with this\nalgorithm, we did numerical simulations with up to $1000$ qubits to see whether\nthe level-1 WS-ab-QAOA can improve the GW solution for 3-regular graphs. In\nfact the improvement in the $1000$-qubit case even in level 1 can only be\nmatched by the GW algorithm after about $10^{5.5}$ random projections performed\nafter the semi-definite program stage. This work gives evidence that the final\nstage of optimization after an efficient classical algorithm has produced an\napproximate solution may be a place where quantum advantages can be realized.",

On the smaller Albiorix and Siarnaq, we observe\na broad 3 micron O-H band but do not see a Fresnel peak or the 1.5/2.0 micron\nfeatures characteristic of H$_2$O ice. We posit that after capture, the\nfrequent high-velocity collisions between smaller irregular satellites\nsublimate the water ice, while the much larger Phoebe is resistant to\ndisruption and retains its water ice.

The advent\nof large language models (LLM) provides a new opportunity to refine agent-based\nmodeling in transportation. LLM agents, which have impressive reasoning and\nplanning abilities, can serve as a proxy of human travelers and be integrated\ninto the modeling framework.

These findings\nunderscore the feasibility of developing multi-task foundation models tailored\nfor power systems, demonstrating that while larger datasets and models\ngenerally improve performance, extreme scaling is unnecessary to achieve\nsatisfactory outcomes.",

    "abstract": "We present new results on the spatial structure and kinematics of Lya and\nseveral far-UV metallic ions in the circumgalactic medium of Keck Baryonic\nStructure Survey galaxies using foreground/background galaxy pairs with angular\nseparations < 30\". Keck/KCWI and Keck/LRIS spectra of 736 background galaxies\nwith z_bg = 2.58 +/- 0.38 probe sightlines through 1033 foreground galaxies\n(z_fg = 2.03 +/- 0.36) at projected distances 8 < D_tran/kpc < 250. For each\nion, we measure equivalent widths (W_lambda) as a function of D_tran and find\nW_lambda ~ D_tran^(-gamma) with 0.3 < gamma < 0.6. Higher ionization species (C\nIV) decrease less rapidly and extend to larger D_tran compared to low ions (O\nI, C II, Si II). Splitting the pair sample into subsets based on foreground\ngalaxy properties, we find W_lambda(C IV) exhibits a strong dependence on\nstellar mass (M_star) and a weaker dependence on star formation rate.\nSimilarly, W_lambda(Lya) increases with M_star, albeit with more scatter. In\n2D, we map the excess Lya and C IV absorption as functions of line-of-sight\nvelocity and D_tran. The Lya velocity centroid varies with D_tran; at D_tran <\n50 kpc, Lya emission from the foreground galaxy affects the Lya absorption\nfeature measured in the background galaxy spectrum, resulting in a net\nblueshifted absorption profile. We construct a two-component model to fit the\nobserved Lya map. The best fit suggests approximately half of the excess Lya\nabsorption arises from a decelerating outflow component with initial velocity\nv_out ~ 750 km/s; the remainder is associated with a component centered on the\ngalaxy systemic redshift with a D_tran-independent 1D velocity dispersion of\nsigma_v ~ 220 km/s, consistent with the average foreground galaxy circular\nvelocity.",

    "abstract": "Reproducing game bugs, in our case crash bugs in continuously evolving games\nlike Minecraft, is a notoriously manual, time-consuming, and challenging\nprocess to automate. Despite the success of LLM-driven bug reproduction in\nother software domains, games, with their complex interactive environments,\nremain largely unaddressed. This paper introduces BugCraft, a novel end-to-end\nframework designed to automate the reproduction of crash bugs in Minecraft\ndirectly from user-submitted bug reports, addressing the critical gap in\nautomated game bug reproduction. BugCraft employs a two-stage approach: first,\na Step Synthesizer leverages LLMs and Minecraft Wiki knowledge to transform bug\nreports into high-quality, structured steps to reproduce (S2R). Second, an\nAction Model, powered by a vision-based LLM agent (GPT-4o) and a custom macro\nAPI, executes these S2R steps within Minecraft to trigger the reported crash.\nTo facilitate evaluation, we introduce BugCraft-Bench, a curated dataset of\nMinecraft crash bug reports. Evaluated on BugCraft-Bench, our framework\nsuccessfully reproduced 30.23% of crash bugs end-to-end. The Step Synthesizer\ndemonstrated a 66.28% accuracy in generating correct bug reproduction plans,\nhighlighting its effectiveness in interpreting and structuring bug report\ninformation. BugCraft demonstrates the feasibility of automated reproduction of\ncrash bugs in complex game environments using LLMs, opening promising avenues\nfor game testing and development. The framework and the BugCraft-Bench dataset\npave the way for future research in automated game bug analysis and hold\npotential for generalization to other interactive game platforms.

The results demonstrate the exceptional ability\nof this approach for NSCLC subtype differentiation, achieving an area under the\ncurve above 0.981 and 0.996 for binary- and multi-class classification.\nFurthermore, this approach produces clinical-grade virtual IHC staining which\nwas blind-evaluated by three experienced thoracic pathologists. Our label-free\nNSCLC subtyping approach enables rapid and accurate diagnosis without\nconventional tissue processing and staining. Both strategies can significantly\naccelerate diagnostic workflows and support efficient lung cancer diagnosis,\nwithout compromising clinical decision-making.",

We report a detailed study of optimal design criteria for\na JJ-based sampler which balances the highest sampler bandwidth (shortest\n10\\%--90\\% rise time) with minimal sampled waveform distortion. We explore the\nimpacts on performance of a sampler, realized using a single underdamped JJ as\nthe logical sampling element (the comparator), due to the type of\nsignal-comparator coupling scheme that is utilized (galvanic, inductive, or\ncapacitive). In these simulations we emulate the entire waveform reconstruction\nsampling process, via comparator threshold detection, while sweeping the time\nlocation at which the waveform is being sampled. We extract the sampled\nwaveform rise time (or FWHM) as a function of the comparator's Stewart-McCumber\nparameter and as a function of the coupling strength between the device under\ntest and comparator. Based on our simulation results we design, fabricate, and\ncharacterize a cryocooled (3.6 K operating temperature) JJ sampler utilizing\nthe NIST state-of-the-art Nb/amorphous-Si/Nb junctions. We separately sample a\nstep signal and impulse generator co-located on-chip with the comparator and\nsampling strobe generator by implementing the same binary search comparator\nthreshold detection technique during sampler operation as is used in\nsimulation. With this technique the system is fully-digital and automated and\noperation of the fabricated device directly mirrors simulation. Our sampler\ntechnology shows a 10\\%--90\\% rise time of 3.3 ps and the capability to measure\ntransient pulse widths of 2.5 ps FWHM.

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in large multimodal models have led to the emergence of\nremarkable generalist capabilities in digital domains, yet their translation to\nphysical agents such as robots remains a significant challenge. This report\nintroduces a new family of AI models purposefully designed for robotics and\nbuilt upon the foundation of Gemini 2.0. We present Gemini Robotics, an\nadvanced Vision-Language-Action (VLA) generalist model capable of directly\ncontrolling robots. Gemini Robotics executes smooth and reactive movements to\ntackle a wide range of complex manipulation tasks while also being robust to\nvariations in object types and positions, handling unseen environments as well\nas following diverse, open vocabulary instructions. We show that with\nadditional fine-tuning, Gemini Robotics can be specialized to new capabilities\nincluding solving long-horizon, highly dexterous tasks, learning new\nshort-horizon tasks from as few as 100 demonstrations and adapting to\ncompletely novel robot embodiments. This is made possible because Gemini\nRobotics builds on top of the Gemini Robotics-ER model, the second model we\nintroduce in this work. Gemini Robotics-ER (Embodied Reasoning) extends\nGemini's multimodal reasoning capabilities into the physical world, with\nenhanced spatial and temporal understanding. This enables capabilities relevant\nto robotics including object detection, pointing, trajectory and grasp\nprediction, as well as multi-view correspondence and 3D bounding box\npredictions. We show how this novel combination can support a variety of\nrobotics applications. We also discuss and address important safety\nconsiderations related to this new class of robotics foundation models. The\nGemini Robotics family marks a substantial step towards developing\ngeneral-purpose robots that realizes AI's potential in the physical world.",

The $\\nu$-point projected energy\ncorrelators (or, $\\nu$-correlators) are an analytically continued family of the\ninteger $N$-point projected energy correlators, which probe correlations\nbetween $N$ final-state particles. By tracking the largest separation ($\\chi$)\nbetween the $N$ particles, in vacuum, their structure is closely related to the\nDGLAP splitting functions and exhibits a classical scaling behavior $\\sim\n1/\\chi$ which is modified by resummation through the anomalous dimensions. We\nshow that, in a thermal medium, the $\\nu$-correlators display non-trivial\nangular scaling already at the leading order in perturbation theory. We find\nthat for non-integer values, particularly $\\nu<1$, medium-induced jet function\nis enhanced compared to $\\nu>1$. This is particularly manifested in the ratios\nof $\\nu$-correlators with respect to the two-point energy correlator which\nencode an intrinsic angular information for $\\nu<1$ when compared to large\n$\\nu$ values. Moreover, for small-$\\nu$ values, the $\\nu$-correlators appear to\nsaturate at $\\nu=0.01$. We further confirm our leading-order numerical\ncomputations against simulated events from JEWEL for the parton level\nproduction cross-section.

A concurrent solution arises when one of the right-handed\nneutrinos, necessary for the generation of light neutrino masses, is itself the\ndark matter candidate. In this article, we study the generation of such a dark\nmatter candidate relying solely on the presence of neutrino mixing. This\ntightly links the generation of dark matter with searches in laboratory\nexperiments on top of the usual indirect dark matter probes.

However, it is crucial to\nnote that numerical resistivity can fail to replicate essential features of\nexplicit resistivity. In this study, we compare the 1D resistive decay and 2D\nreconnection properties of four commonly used physical models. We demonstrate\nthat the 1D Ohmic decay of current sheets via numerical dissipation in both\nideal MHD and magnetodynamics (MD) is subdiffusive (i.e., sub-linear in time),\nwhereas explicit resistive FFE and resistive MHD simulations match the\npredictions of resistive theory adequately. For low-resolution, reconnecting\ncurrent sheets in 2D, we show that ideal MHD and MD have an analogue to the\nSweet--Parker regime where the scaling of the reconnection rate depends\ndirectly on the resolution. At high resolutions, ideal MHD and MD have an\nasymptotic reconnection rate similar to resistive MHD. Furthermore, we find\nthat guide field-balanced current sheets in ideal MHD and MD have a qualitative\nstructure similar to that of one in resistive MHD. Similarly, a\npressure-balanced current sheet in ideal MHD is found to have a qualitative\nstructure similar to that of one in resistive MHD. For a guide field-balanced\nsheet, resistive FFE is found to have a nearly identical Sweet--Parker regime\ncompared to resistive MHD and a similar asymptotic reconnection rate for large\nenough Lundquist numbers, but differs in the timescale for reconnection onset\nin the asymptotic regime.

However,\nexisting approaches typically quantify task-level output prediction uncertainty\nwithout considering epistemic uncertainty at the multimodal feature fusion\nlevel, leading to sub-optimal outcomes. Additionally, popular uncertainty\nquantification methods, e.g., Bayesian approximations, remain challenging to\ndeploy in practice due to high computational costs in training and inference.\nIn this paper, we propose HyperDUM, a novel deterministic uncertainty method\n(DUM) that efficiently quantifies feature-level epistemic uncertainty by\nleveraging hyperdimensional computing. Our method captures the channel and\nspatial uncertainties through channel and patch -wise projection and bundling\ntechniques respectively. Multimodal sensor features are then adaptively\nweighted to mitigate uncertainty propagation and improve feature fusion. Our\nevaluations show that HyperDUM on average outperforms the state-of-the-art\n(SOTA) algorithms by up to 2.01%/1.27% in 3D Object Detection and up to 1.29%\nimprovement over baselines in semantic segmentation tasks under various types\nof uncertainties.

In the limit of full coupled-cluster theory (which is\nequivalent to full configuration interaction (FCI)), the electronic\nwavefunction and correlation energy are exact within a given one-particle basis\nset and the symmetric character of the exact density matrix is recovered. The\nextent of the density matrix asymmetry is shown to provide a measure of ``how\ndifficult the problem is'' (like the well-known T$_1$ diagnostic), but its\nvariation with level of theory also gives information about ``how well this\nparticular method works'', irrespective of the difficulty of the problem at\nhand. The proposed diagnostic is described and applied to a select group of\nsmall molecules, and an example of its overall utility for the practicing\nquantum chemist is illustrated through its application to the beryllium dimer\n(Be$_2$).

In particular, discovering new\nsuperconductors is massively impeded by the cost of computing the\nelectron-phonon spectral functions, which limits the feasible materials space.\nRecent advances in machine learning offer an opportunity to accelerate the\nsuperconductor discovery workflow by developing machine-learning-based\nsurrogates for DFT.

To avoid the negative parallax values, we\nselect 31,129,169 sources in Gaia DR3 with radial velocity, where the\nfractional parallax error is less than 20% ($0 < \\sigma_\\varpi/\\varpi < 0.2$).\nTo select the most accurate and efficient method of propagating mean and\ncovariance, we use the Monte Carlo results with $10^7$ samples (MC7) as the\nbenchmark, and compare the precision of linear, second-order, and Monte Carlo\nerror propagation methods. By assessing the accuracy of propagated mean and\ncovariance, we observe that second-order error propagation exhibits mean\ndeviations of at most 0.5% compared to MC7, with variance deviations of up to\n10%. Overall, this outperforms linear transformation. Though Monte Carlo method\nwith $10^4$ samples (MC4) is an order of magnitude slower than second-order\nerror propagation, its covariances propagation accuracy reaches 1% when\n$\\sigma_\\varpi/\\varpi$ is below 15%. Consequently, we employ second-order error\npropagation to convert the mean astrometry and radial velocity into Cartesian\ncoordinates and velocities in both equatorial and galactic systems for 30\nmillion Gaia sources, and apply MC4 for covariance propagation. The Cartesian\ncatalog and source code are provided for future applications in high-precision\nstellar and galactic dynamics.",

Quantifying the impact of increased cost-sharing from\ndeductibles on utilization is a challenging empirical question because\nindividuals and employers self-select into plans with deductibles. We evaluated\nthe impact of cost-sharing in plans with deductibles by leveraging an\naccidental injury to a family member as an instrumental variable that strongly\npredicted the non-injured family member reaching their deductible maximum,\nwhich resulted in a reduction in cost-sharing. Our outcome measures examined\nutilization subject to cost-sharing as compared to utilization exempt from\ncost-sharing.

Nearly one-quarter\nof the increased ED utilization was potentially avoidable.

    "abstract": "Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) based quantum sensors hold great potential for\nreal-time single-cell sensing with far-reaching applications in fundamental\nbiology and medical diagnostics. Although highly sensitive, the mapping of\nquantum measurements onto cellular physiological states has remained an\nexceptional challenge. Here we introduce a novel quantum sensing modality\ncapable of detecting changes in cellular activity. Our approach is based on the\ndetection of environment-induced charge depletion within an individual particle\nthat, owing to a previously unaccounted transverse dipole term, induces\nsystematic shifts in the zero-field splitting (ZFS). Importantly, these\ncharge-induced shifts serve as a reliable indicator for lipopolysaccharide\n(LPS)-mediated inflammatory response in macrophages. Furthermore, we\ndemonstrate that surface modification of our diamond nanoprobes effectively\nsuppresses these environment-induced ZFS shifts, providing an important tool\nfor differentiating electrostatic shifts caused by the environment from other\nunrelated effects, such as temperature variations. Notably, this surface\nmodification also leads to significant reductions in particle-induced toxicity\nand inflammation. Our findings shed light on systematic drifts and sensitivity\nlimits of NV spectroscopy in a biological environment with ramification on the\ncritical discussion surrounding single-cell thermogenesis. Notably, this work\nestablishes the foundation for a novel sensing modality capable of probing\ncomplex cellular processes through straightforward physical measurements.",

    "abstract": "Face anti-spoofing (FAS) plays a pivotal role in ensuring the security and\nreliability of face recognition systems. With advancements in vision-language\npretrained (VLP) models, recent two-class FAS techniques have leveraged the\nadvantages of using VLP guidance, while this potential remains unexplored in\none-class FAS methods. The one-class FAS focuses on learning intrinsic liveness\nfeatures solely from live training images to differentiate between live and\nspoof faces. However, the lack of spoof training data can lead one-class FAS\nmodels to inadvertently incorporate domain information irrelevant to the\nlive/spoof distinction (e.g., facial content), causing performance degradation\nwhen tested with a new application domain. To address this issue, we propose a\nnovel framework called Spoof-aware one-class face anti-spoofing with Language\nImage Pretraining (SLIP). Given that live faces should ideally not be obscured\nby any spoof-attack-related objects (e.g., paper, or masks) and are assumed to\nyield zero spoof cue maps, we first propose an effective language-guided spoof\ncue map estimation to enhance one-class FAS models by simulating whether the\nunderlying faces are covered by attack-related objects and generating\ncorresponding nonzero spoof cue maps. Next, we introduce a novel prompt-driven\nliveness feature disentanglement to alleviate live/spoof-irrelative domain\nvariations by disentangling live/spoof-relevant and domain-dependent\ninformation. Finally, we design an effective augmentation strategy by fusing\nlatent features from live images and spoof prompts to generate spoof-like image\nfeatures and thus diversify latent spoof features to facilitate the learning of\none-class FAS. Our extensive experiments and ablation studies support that SLIP\nconsistently outperforms previous one-class FAS methods.",

    "abstract": "Variations in Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanners and acquisition\nprotocols cause distribution shifts that degrade reconstruction performance on\nunseen data. Test-time adaptation (TTA) offers a promising solution to address\nthis discrepancies. However, previous single-shot TTA approaches are\ninefficient due to repeated training and suboptimal distributional models.\nSelf-supervised learning methods may risk over-smoothing in scarce data\nscenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Dual-Stage\nDistribution and Slice Adaptation (D2SA) via MRI implicit neural representation\n(MR-INR) to improve MRI reconstruction performance and efficiency, which\nfeatures two stages. In the first stage, an MR-INR branch performs patient-wise\ndistribution adaptation by learning shared representations across slices and\nmodelling patient-specific shifts with mean and variance adjustments. In the\nsecond stage, single-slice adaptation refines the output from frozen\nconvolutional layers with a learnable anisotropic diffusion module, preventing\nover-smoothing and reducing computation. Experiments across five MRI\ndistribution shifts demonstrate that our method can integrate well with various\nself-supervised learning (SSL) framework, improving performance and\naccelerating convergence under diverse conditions.",

This short review aims to provide a comprehensive,\nconceptually clear, and accessible introduction to the physics of (re)heating,\ntailored to the particle physics community. We critically examine the standard\nBoltzmann approach, emphasizing its limitations in capturing the intrinsically\nnon-perturbative and non-linear dynamics that dominate the early stages of\nenergy transfer. These include explosive particle production, inflaton\nfragmentation, turbulence, and thermalization; phenomena often overlooked in\nperturbative treatments. We survey a wide range of theoretical tools, from\nBoltzmann equations to lattice simulations, clarifying when each is applicable\nand highlighting scenarios where analytic control is still feasible. Special\nattention is given to model-dependent features such as (pre)heating, the role\nof fermions, gravitational couplings, and the impact of multifield dynamics. We\nalso discuss exceptional cases, including Starobinsky-like models and instant\n(pre)heating, where (re)heating proceeds through analytically tractable\nchannels without requiring full non-linear simulations. Ultimately, this review\nserves both as a practical guide and a cautionary tale, advocating for a more\nnuanced and physically accurate understanding of this pivotal epoch within the\nparticle physics community.",

In this work, we extend these investigations by properly\nincorporating plasma dynamics, particularly the plasma-induced photon effective\nmass, which suppresses the axion-photon mixing. Using two toy models for the\nconductive regions in the magnetosphere and accounting for fluid dynamics in\nboth the frequency and time domain, we show that typical astrophysical plasma\ndensities strongly inhibits the axionic instability.

They are\ndetectable across most of the visible Universe. However, they are also rare and\nfrequently poorly localized. In this paper, we review searches for\ngravitational lensing in GRBs and comment on promising avenues for the future.\nWe note that the highly structured jets in GRBs can show variations on\nsufficiently small scales that, unlike lensing of most transient sources,\ngravitational lensing in gamma-ray bursts may not be achromatic. Such behavior\nwould weaken the stringent requirements for identifying lensed bursts but would\nalso make robust identification of lensing more challenging. A continuously\nrunning search that could identify candidate lensed events in near real-time\nwould enable afterglow searches with current and near-future wide-field\noptical/IR surveys that could yield the first unambiguous detection of a lensed\nGRB. The new generation of sensitive X-ray and gamma-ray detectors, such as the\nEinstein Probe and SVOM, will complement Swift and significantly enhance the\nnumber of well-localized gamma-ray and X-ray transients.

    "abstract": "3D reconstruction of highly deformable surfaces (e.g. cloths) from monocular\nRGB videos is a challenging problem, and no solution provides a consistent and\naccurate recovery of fine-grained surface details. To account for the ill-posed\nnature of the setting, existing methods use deformation models with\nstatistical, neural, or physical priors. They also predominantly rely on\nnonadaptive discrete surface representations (e.g. polygonal meshes), perform\nframe-by-frame optimisation leading to error propagation, and suffer from poor\ngradients of the mesh-based differentiable renderers. Consequently, fine\nsurface details such as cloth wrinkles are often not recovered with the desired\naccuracy. In response to these limitations, we propose ThinShell-SfT, a new\nmethod for non-rigid 3D tracking that represents a surface as an implicit and\ncontinuous spatiotemporal neural field. We incorporate continuous thin shell\nphysics prior based on the Kirchhoff-Love model for spatial regularisation,\nwhich starkly contrasts the discretised alternatives of earlier works. Lastly,\nwe leverage 3D Gaussian splatting to differentiably render the surface into\nimage space and optimise the deformations based on analysis-bysynthesis\nprinciples. Our Thin-Shell-SfT outperforms prior works qualitatively and\nquantitatively thanks to our continuous surface formulation in conjunction with\na specially tailored simulation prior and surface-induced 3D Gaussians.

Tracing their stellar populations can provide insight into the\nprocesses that transformed these galaxies into their observed quiescent state.\nIn particular, higher-redshift galaxies exhibit more pronounced relative age\ndifferences. At early stages, even small differences in age remain significant,\nwhereas as galaxies evolve, these differences become harder to detect in the\nlocal Universe. The COSMOS Wall is a structure at z ~ 0.73 that contains a\nlarge variety of environments, from rich clusters down to field-like regions.\nThis sample offers a great opportunity to study the effect of the environment\non the quiescent galaxy population. Leveraging high-quality spectroscopic data\nfrom the LEGA-C survey, and photometric data from the COSMOS2020 catalogue, we\nperformed a full-index and photometry fitting of 74 massive quiescent galaxies,\nderiving their mass-weighted ages, metallicities, and star formation\ntimescales. We characterised the environment in three subsamples: X-ray and\nnon-X-ray groups and a field subsample. We find a decreasing trend in\nmass-weighted age with increasing environmental density, with galaxies groups >\n1 Gyr older than those in the field. Conversely, we do not find any significant\ndifference in stellar metallicity between galaxies in X-ray and non-X-ray\ngroups, while we find galaxies with 0.15 dex higher metallicities in the field.\nOur results indicate that, at z ~ 0.7, the environment plays a crucial role in\nshaping the evolution of massive quiescent galaxies, noticeably affecting both\ntheir mass-weighted age and star formation timescale.

Here, we present a detailed light curve analysis of a\nmagnitude-limited sample of 639 Type II SNe from the Zwicky Transient Facility\nBright Transient Survey. Using Gaussian processes, we systematically measure\nempirical light curve features (e.g. rise times, peak colours and luminosities)\nin a robust sampling-independent manner. We focus on rise times as they are\nhighly sensitive to pre-explosion progenitor properties, especially the\npresence of a dense circumstellar medium (CSM) shed by the progenitor in the\nyears immediately pre-explosion. By correlating our feature measurements with\nphysical parameters from an extensive grid of STELLA hydrodynamical models with\nvarying progenitor properties (CSM structure, $\\dot M$, $R_{CSM}$ and\n$M_{ZAMS}$), we quantify the proportion of events with sufficient pre-explosion\nmass-loss to significantly alter the initial light curve (roughly $M_{CSM} \\geq\n10^{-2.5} M_{\\odot}$) in a highly complete sample of 377 spectroscopically\nclassified Type II SNe.

After applying a volumetric-correction, we find\n36$^{+5}_{-7}$\\% of all Type II SN progenitors possess substantial CSM within\n$10^{15}$ cm at the time of explosion. This high fraction of progenitors with\ndense CSM, supported by photometric and spectroscopic evidence of previous SNe,\nreveals mass-loss rates significantly exceeding those measured in local group\nred supergiants or predicted by current theoretical models.",

The newest of the first\nthree definitions of BC was accepted and used throughout the century.\nTherefore, the part of the development line of BC before Kuiper could be\nconsidered a prescience period.

The\nextended core region excludes collisional formation as a viable channel for BS\nformation. Our binary evolution models suggest that non-conservative mass\ntransfer (MT) is essential for shaping the distribution of BS binaries in the\nCMD. The red sequence primarily comprises BS binaries formed through\nconservative ongoing MT. In contrast, the blue sequence BS binaries are formed\nthrough non-conservative post-MT processes, all involving white dwarf (WD)\ncompanions.

We then\nperform a perturbative analysis on the dynamical formation of nonlinear tails\nin a self-interacting scalar field model, wherein the nonlinear tails are\nsourced by a $\\lambda \\Phi^3$ cubic coupling. Due to cascading mode excitations\nand back-reactions, nonlinear tails with $t^{-l-1}$ power law are sourced in\neach harmonic mode, dominating the late time behavior of the scalar\nperturbations. In verification, we conducted numerical simulations of the\nself-interacting scalar model, including all real spherical harmonic (RSH) with\n$l\\leq 4$ and their respective nonlinear couplings. We find general agreement\nbetween the predicted and numerical power law indices and amplitudes for the\nnonlinear tails, with the exception of $l=4$ modes, which display $t^{-4}$\npower law instead of the predicted $t^{-5}$. This discrepancy is due to\ndistortion in the source of the tails, which is caused by another nonlinear\neffect.

In this work we investigate the\nlarge-scale matter flows that connect collapsed structures to their cosmic\nenvironments specifically for their agreement with self-similarity in various\nproperties. For this purpose we use the full power of the hydrodynamical\ncosmological simulation suite Magneticum Pathfinder to calculate the in- and\noutflow rates for haloes on a large range of masses and redshifts. We find a\nstriking self-similarity across the whole mass range and cosmic epochs that\nonly breaks in the outflowing regime due to the different outflow driving\nmechanisms for galaxies vs. galaxy clusters. Geometrical analysis of the\npatterns of in vs. outflow demonstrate how the inflows organize into\nanisotropic filaments driven by the tidal environment, while the outflows are\nisotropic due to their thermal nature. This also manifests in the thermal and\nchemical properties of the gas: While the inflowing gas is pristine and colder,\nencountering the accretion shocks and entering the influence region of AGN and\nstellar feedback heats the gas up into a diffuse, metal enriched and hot\natmosphere. Overall the differences between outflowing and infalling gas are\nenhanced at the galaxy cluster scale compared to the galaxy scale due to the\naccretion shocks that reach out to large radii for these objects. An individual\nstudy of the gas motions in the outskirts of one of the most massive clusters\nin the simulations illustrates these results: Gas found in the outer hot\natmosphere at z=0 falls in and is completely enriched early before being shock\nheated and expanding.",

One of the most intriguing aspects of\nthe stasis phenomenon is that it can give rise to cosmological epochs in which\nthe effective equation-of-state parameter $\\langle w \\rangle$ for the universe\nis constant, but differs from the canonical values associated with matter,\nradiation, vacuum energy, etc. Indeed, during such a stasis epoch, the spatial\naverage of the energy density of the universe evolves in precisely the same\nmanner as it would have evolved if the universe were instead dominated by a\nperfect fluid with an equation-of-state parameter equal to $\\langle w \\rangle$.\nHowever, as we shall demonstrate, this equivalence is broken at the level of\nthe perturbations of the energy density. To illustrate this point, we consider\na stasis epoch involving matter and radiation and demonstrate that within this\nstasis background the density perturbations associated with a spectator matter\ncomponent with exceedingly small energy density exhibit a power-law growth that\npersists across the entire duration of the stasis epoch.

To address this limitation, we propose\nSuperFlow++, a novel framework that integrates spatiotemporal cues in both\npretraining and downstream tasks using consecutive LiDAR-camera pairs.\nSuperFlow++ introduces four key components: (1) a view consistency alignment\nmodule to unify semantic information across camera views, (2) a dense-to-sparse\nconsistency regularization mechanism to enhance feature robustness across\nvarying point cloud densities, (3) a flow-based contrastive learning approach\nthat models temporal relationships for improved scene understanding, and (4) a\ntemporal voting strategy that propagates semantic information across LiDAR\nscans to improve prediction consistency.

We select\nparametric triplanes as the intermediate 4D representation and propose a\npractical training paradigm that takes advantage of both generative adversarial\nnetworks (GANs) and diffusion models. Our design stems from the observation\nthat 4D GANs excel at bridging images and triplanes without supervision yet\nusually face challenges in handling diverse data distributions. A robust 2D\ndiffusion prior emerges as the solution, assisting the GAN in transferring its\nexpertise across various domains. The synergy between these experts permits the\nconstruction of a multi-domain image-triplane dataset, which drives the\ndevelopment of a general 4D avatar creator. Extensive experiments suggest that\nour model, AvatarArtist, is capable of producing high-quality 4D avatars with\nstrong robustness to various source image domains. The code, the data, and the\nmodels will be made publicly available to facilitate future studies.",

    "abstract": "Context: Solar eruptions are crucial for space weather studies. Understanding\nthe mechanisms influencing their evolution is key to improving predictions of\ntheir geoeffectiveness. Helmet streamers (HSs) are persistent structures in the\nsolar corona, present in both minimum and maximum solar activity periods. These\nstructures contain a current sheet of low magnetic energy, where coronal mass\nejections (CMEs) tend to deflect. However, they also feature a closed magnetic\nfield region beneath this sheet, often confining eruptions. Their complexity\nmakes predicting eruptions challenging. Aims: This study examines how HSs\ninfluence the evolution and potential confinement of magnetic flux ropes\n(MFRs). We explore magnetic configurations where the MFR is more likely to rise\nthrough the overlying field, aiming to establish simple parameters that help\npredict whether an MFR will ascend or remain confined. Methods: Using 2.5D MHD\nsimulations, we model MFR dynamics in the presence of an HS, analyzing\ndifferent magnetic configurations and focusing on the mechanisms that enable\nascent or confinement. Results: Null-point reconnection plays a key role in MFR\ndynamics. Depending on the initial configuration, it can either disrupt the\nMFR, preventing ascent, or reduce the strapping flux, facilitating upward\nmotion. We identify a critical threshold: if the strapping flux above the MFR\nis less than two-thirds of its poloidal flux, the MFR ascends successfully.\nConclusions: Our simulations show that null-point reconnection significantly\nimpacts MFR ascent. A key predictor of successful rise is the initial ratio of\nthe MFR's poloidal flux to the strapping flux above it.",

Instead of contrastive learning on global image\nrepresentation, PS3 is pre-trained by selectively processing local regions and\ncontrasting them with local detailed captions, enabling high-resolution\nrepresentation learning with greatly reduced computational overhead.

The most prominent one is\nthe first dredge-up that occurs at the beginning of the red giant branch. Then,\nvarious extra-mixing processes, such as those caused by thermohaline- and/or\nrotation-induced mixing, come into action. The extent of the influence of\nstellar magnetic activity on alterations in stellar chemical composition is\namong the least studied questions. Aims. To investigate how magnetic activity\ninfluences mixing in the atmospheres of magnetically active stars, we carried\nout a detailed study of C, N, and up to ten other chemical element abundances,\nas well as carbon isotope ratios in a sample of RS CVn stars. Methods. Using a\ndifferential model atmosphere method, we analysed high-resolution spectra that\nhad been observed with the VUES spectrograph on the 1.65 m telescope at the\nMoletai Astronomical Observatory of Vilnius University. Abundances of other\nchemical elements were determined from equivalent widths or spectral syntheses\nof unblended spectral lines. Results. We determined the main atmospheric\nparameters and abundances of up to 12 chemical elements for a sample of 20 RS\nCVn giants that represented different evolutionary stages. We determined that\n*29 Dra, *b01 Cyg, and V* V834 Her, which are in the evolutionary stage below\nthe red giant branch luminosity bump, already show evidence of extra-mixing in\ntheir lowered carbon isotope ratios. Conclusions. We provide observational\nevidence that in low-mass chromospherically active RS CVn stars, due to their\nmagnetic activity, extra-mixing processes may start acting below the luminosity\nbump of the red giant branch.",

    "abstract": "Recent progress in AI capabilities has heightened concerns that AI systems\ncould pose a threat to national security, for example, by making it easier for\nmalicious actors to perform cyberattacks on critical national infrastructure,\nor through loss of control of autonomous AI systems. In parallel, federal\nlegislators in the US have proposed nascent 'AI incident regimes' to identify\nand counter similar threats. In this paper, we consolidate these two trends and\npresent a timely proposal for a legally mandated post-deployment AI incident\nregime that aims to counter potential national security threats from AI\nsystems. We start the paper by introducing the concept of 'security-critical'\nto describe sectors that pose extreme risks to national security, before\narguing that 'security-critical' describes civilian nuclear power, aviation,\nlife science dual-use research of concern, and frontier AI development. We then\npresent in detail our AI incident regime proposal, justifying each component of\nthe proposal by demonstrating its similarity to US domestic incident regimes in\nother 'security-critical' sectors. Finally, we sketch a hypothetical scenario\nwhere our proposed AI incident regime deals with an AI cyber incident. Our\nproposed AI incident regime is split into three phases. The first phase\nrevolves around a novel operationalization of what counts as an 'AI incident'\nand we suggest that AI providers must create a 'national security case' before\ndeploying a frontier AI system. The second and third phases spell out that AI\nproviders should notify a government agency about incidents, and that the\ngovernment agency should be involved in amending AI providers' security and\nsafety procedures, in order to counter future threats to national security.",

    "abstract": "We address the problem of cluster identity estimation in a personalized\nfederated learning (PFL) setting in which users aim to learn different personal\nmodels. The backbone of effective learning in such a setting is to cluster\nusers into groups whose objectives are similar. A typical approach in the\nliterature is to achieve this by training users' data on different proposed\npersonal models and assign them to groups based on which model achieves the\nlowest value of the users' loss functions. This process is to be done\niteratively until group identities converge. A key challenge in such a setting\narises when users have noisy labeled data, which may produce misleading values\nof their loss functions, and hence lead to ineffective clustering. To overcome\nthis challenge, we propose a label-agnostic data similarity-based clustering\nalgorithm, coined RCC-PFL, with three main advantages: the cluster identity\nestimation procedure is independent from the training labels; it is a one-shot\nclustering algorithm performed prior to the training; and it requires fewer\ncommunication rounds and less computation compared to iterative-based\nclustering methods. We validate our proposed algorithm using various models and\ndatasets and show that it outperforms multiple baselines in terms of average\naccuracy and variance reduction.",

We explore a\nrange of stellar magnetic moment orientations and relative strengths, finding\nthat the magnetospheres and Poynting flux evolution are strongly\nconfiguration-dependent. The Poynting flux exhibits pulsations at twice the\norbital frequency, $2\\Omega$, and is highly anisotropic, following a power-law\ndependence on orbital frequency. The index ranges from 1 to 6, shaped by the\nintricate dynamics of the magnetospheres. Furthermore, we present the first\ncomputation of: (1) The EM forces acting on the star surfaces, revealing the\npresence of torques that, for highly-magnetized stars, could influence the\norbital dynamics or break the crust.

To bridge this gap, we propose Mask$^2$DiT, a\nnovel approach that establishes fine-grained, one-to-one alignment between\nvideo segments and their corresponding text annotations. Specifically, we\nintroduce a symmetric binary mask at each attention layer within the DiT\narchitecture, ensuring that each text annotation applies exclusively to its\nrespective video segment while preserving temporal coherence across visual\ntokens. This attention mechanism enables precise segment-level\ntextual-to-visual alignment, allowing the DiT architecture to effectively\nhandle video generation tasks with a fixed number of scenes. To further equip\nthe DiT architecture with the ability to generate additional scenes based on\nexisting ones, we incorporate a segment-level conditional mask, which\nconditions each newly generated segment on the preceding video segments,\nthereby enabling auto-regressive scene extension. Both qualitative and\nquantitative experiments confirm that Mask$^2$DiT excels in maintaining visual\nconsistency across segments while ensuring semantic alignment between each\nsegment and its corresponding text description.

    "abstract": "HALHF is a hybrid linear collider that uses electron-driven plasma-wakefield\nacceleration to accelerate electrons to high energy while using radio-frequency\ncavity technology to accelerate positrons. The most cost-effective solution\ncollides low-energy positrons with high-energy electrons, producing a boost to\nthe final state in the electron direction with $\\gamma= 1.67$. The current\nHALHF baseline design produces a luminosity comparable to that of the baseline\nILC but with a greatly reduced construction and carbon footprint and hence much\nlower cost than the mature linear-collider designs ILC and CLIC. Costs for\nHALHF are evaluated, together with that for the approximate 15-year R\\&D\nprogramme necessary to realise HALHF. Time scales and cost for the R\\&D are\nestimated. Upgrade paths for HALHF technology from a 250~GeV Higgs factory,\nthrough 380 and 550~GeV, up to 10~TeV are sketched.",

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the problem of collaboratively satisfying long-term\nspatial constraints in multi-agent systems. Each agent is subject to spatial\nconstraints, expressed as inequalities, which may depend on the positions of\nother agents with whom they may or may not have direct communication. These\nconstraints need to be satisfied asymptotically or after an unknown finite\ntime. The agents' objective is to collectively achieve a formation that\nfulfills all constraints. The problem is initially framed as a centralized\nunconstrained optimization, where the solution yields the optimal configuration\nby maximizing an objective function that reflects the degree of constraint\nsatisfaction. This function encourages collaboration, ensuring agents help each\nother meet their constraints while fulfilling their own. When the constraints\nare infeasible, agents converge to a least-violating solution. A distributed\nconsensus-based optimization scheme is then introduced, which approximates the\ncentralized solution, leading to the development of distributed controllers for\nsingle-integrator agents. Finally, simulations validate the effectiveness of\nthe proposed approach.",

To address these issues, we propose CausalRAG, a\nnovel framework that incorporates causal graphs into the retrieval process. By\nconstructing and tracing causal relationships, CausalRAG preserves contextual\ncontinuity and improves retrieval precision, leading to more accurate and\ninterpretable responses.

Simultaneously, increasing LMs'\n\"thinking\" time through scaling test-time compute has proven an effective\ntechnique to solve challenging problems in domains such as math and code. This\nraises a natural question: can an LM's evaluation capability also be improved\nby spending more test-time compute? To answer this, we investigate employing\nreasoning models-LMs that natively generate long chain-of-thought reasoning-as\nevaluators. Specifically, we examine methods to leverage more test-time compute\nby (1) using reasoning models, and (2) prompting these models to evaluate not\nonly the response as a whole (i.e., outcome evaluation) but also assess each\nstep in the response separately (i.e., process evaluation). In experiments, we\nobserve that the evaluator's performance improves monotonically when generating\nmore reasoning tokens, similar to the trends observed in LM-based generation.\nFurthermore, we use these more accurate evaluators to rerank multiple\ngenerations, and demonstrate that spending more compute at evaluation time can\nbe as effective as using more compute at generation time in improving an LM's\nproblem-solving capability.",

These were blindly estimated using cyclostationary signal\nprocessing (CSP) and were then input into the CAP for training and\nclassification. The results showed that the classification of digitally\nmodulated signals using CAPs and CCs proposed in this dissertation outperformed\nalternative approaches for classifying digitally modulated signals that\nincluded conventional classifiers that employed CSP-based techniques, as well\nas alternative DL-based classifiers that used various conventional neural\nnetworks (NNs) with in-phase/quadrature (I/Q) data used for training and\nclassification.\n  Another method of digital modulation classification presented in this\ndissertation showcases two novel DL-based classifiers that each use a CAP with\ncustom-designed feature extraction layers. The classifiers take I/Q data as\ninput, and the feature extraction layers are inspired by CSP techniques, which\nextract the CC features employed by conventional CSP-based approaches to blind\nmodulation classification and signal identification. Specifically, the feature\nextraction layers implement a proxy of the mathematical functions used in the\ncalculation of the CC features and include a squaring layer, a\nraise-to-the-power-of-three layer, and a fast-Fourier-transform (FFT) layer,\nalong with additional normalization and warping layers to ensure that the\nrelative signal powers are retained and to prevent the trainable NN layers from\ndiverging in the training process.",

These coding assistants automate repetitive\nand time-consuming coding tasks such as code generation, code completion, code\nsummarization, and code translation. Responsiveness is a crucial requirement of\nthese coding assistants to maintain real-time interactivity, such that their\nuse does not impede the developers' workflows. Different coding tasks have\nunique characteristics and latency requirements: Time-To-First-Token (TTFT)\nlatency is essential for code completion tasks, while End-To-End (E2E) latency\nis crucial for code translation tasks. Managing these varying requirements\nsimultaneously while optimizing resource usage poses significant challenges.\nExisting work adopts the Model-as-a-Service paradigm for serving individual\nCodeLLMs, but cannot effectively manage latency requirements of concurrent\ncoding tasks and sequences of CodeLLM inference calls, due to a lack of\nend-to-end latency awareness. Another challenge is keeping resource utilization\nhigh, when the serving system is deployed on a shared cluster environment. To\naddress these challenges, we propose Coding Assistant Task Orchestrator (CATO),\na runtime system designed to serve a diverse assortment of coding tasks while\nmeeting latency requirements and maximizing resource utilization. Our\nexperiments demonstrate that when all types of coding tasks were served\nsimultaneously, for TTFT-critical tasks, CATO improves overall Goodput rate and\nresource utilization by up to 10% and 41.1%, respectively.

Additionally, on mixing with the light fields all\nthe Higgs fields become heavy except for one pair of light Higgs doublets just\nas in MSSM. This model has not been fully explored thus far because of the\ntechnical difficulty of computing the couplings of the heavy and the light\nHiggs sectors, specifically the interaction $(\\mathsf{560\\times 560)\\cdot 320}$\ninvolving the coupling of tensor-spinors with a third rank ~mixed tensor\n$\\mathsf{320}$. An explicit analysis of such couplings is given in this paper.\nSpontaneous symmetry breaking of the $\\mathsf{SO(10)}$ symmetry is carried out\nreducing the gauge group to $\\mathsf{SU(3)}_c\\times \\mathsf{SU(2)}_L\\times\n\\mathsf{U(1)}_Y$ with just one just pair of light Higgs. Thus a natural\ndeduction of MSSM arises from the $\\mathsf{SO(10)}$ model with no fine tuning\nneeded.

We highlight new challenges when\ncomparing data and hydrodynamical simulations. Our simple and most conservative\nanalysis suggests that the gas is more extended than the dark matter (99.5%\nconfidence, i.e. PTE = 0.005). It also hints at a preference for galaxy\nformation models with more feedback (Illustris $z=0.5$, PTE = 0.37) rather than\nless (Illustris TNG $z=0.8$, PTE = 0.045), though with less statistical\nsignificance. In all cases, a free multiplicative amplitude was fit to the\nsimulated profiles, and further modeling work is required to firm up these\nconclusions. We find consistency between kSZ profiles around spectroscopic and\nphotometric LRG, with comparable statistical power, thus increasing our\nconfidence in the photometric analysis. Additionally, we present the first kSZ\nmeasurement around DESI Y1 bright galaxy sample (BGS) and emission-line\ngalaxies (ELG), whose features match qualitative expectations. Finally, we\nforecast $S/N \\sim 50$ for future stacked kSZ measurements using data from ACT,\nDESI Y3, and Rubin Observatory.

This paper proposes GENIUS, a universal generative\nretrieval framework supporting diverse tasks across multiple modalities and\ndomains. At its core, GENIUS introduces modality-decoupled semantic\nquantization, transforming multimodal data into discrete IDs encoding both\nmodality and semantics. Moreover, to enhance generalization, we propose a query\naugmentation that interpolates between a query and its target, allowing GENIUS\nto adapt to varied query forms. Evaluated on the M-BEIR benchmark, it surpasses\nprior generative methods by a clear margin. Unlike embedding-based retrieval,\nGENIUS consistently maintains high retrieval speed across database size, with\ncompetitive performance across multiple benchmarks.

Thermodiffusive effects in premixed hydrogen flames are typically\nexplained and modelled via local equivalence ratio fluctuations. However, it is\nreiterated here that the imbalance between species and thermal diffusion\n(differential diffusion), rather than local species-to-species diffusive\nimbalances (preferential diffusion) is the leading-order effect. Reactant\n(H$_2$), product (H$_2$O) and intermediate (H) species are demonstrated to all\nplay a role in the transport of enthalpy through an analysis of enthalpy flux\ndivergence terms in unstretched flames. Premixed counterflow flames at various\nstrain rates and pressures are then analysed to demonstrate that enhanced\nreactivity originates from a combination of enthalpy transport and the\nbroadness of the reaction zone relative to the thickness of the flame. Effects\nresulting from key pressure fall-off reactions are also discussed to determine\nthe importance of detailed chemistry, and the usage of Zeldovich number.\nFinally, two-dimensional planar flames are simulated and analysed to\ndemonstrate the role of curvature in addition to strain rate, and the\nimplications of the findings in blends and turbulent flames are discussed.",

In this paper, we present a photonic\ndevice with highly programmable nonlinear functionality: an optical slab\nwaveguide with an arbitrarily reconfigurable two-dimensional distribution of\n$\\chi^{(2)}$ nonlinearity. The nonlinearity is realized using\nelectric-field-induced $\\chi^{(2)}$ in a $\\chi^{(3)}$ material. The\nprogrammability is engineered by massively parallel control of the\nelectric-field distribution within the device using a photoconductive layer and\noptical programming with a spatial light pattern. To showcase the versatility\nof our device, we demonstrated spectral, spatial, and spatio-spectral\nengineering of second-harmonic generation by tailoring arbitrary\nquasi-phase-matching (QPM) grating structures in two dimensions.\nSecond-harmonic light was generated with programmable spectra, enabled by\nreal-time in situ inverse design of QPM gratings. Flexible spatial control was\nalso achieved, including the generation of complex waveforms such as Airy beams\nand the simultaneous engineering of spectral and spatial features. This allowed\nus to create distinct spatial light profiles across multiple wavelengths. The\nprogrammability also allowed us to demonstrate in situ, real-time compensation\nof fluctuations in pump laser wavelength. Our work shows that we can transcend\nthe conventional one-device--one-function paradigm, expanding the potential\napplications of nonlinear optics in situations where fast device\nreconfigurability is not merely practically convenient but essential -- such as\nin programmable optical quantum gates and quantum light sources, all-optical\nsignal processing, optical computation, and structured light for sensing.",

However, lung opacities in CXRs frequently\nobscure anatomical structures, impeding clear identification of lung borders\nand complicating the localization of pathology. This challenge significantly\nhampers segmentation accuracy and precise lesion identification, which are\ncrucial for diagnosis. To tackle these issues, our study proposes an unpaired\nCXR translation framework that converts CXRs with lung opacities into\ncounterparts without lung opacities while preserving semantic features. Central\nto our approach is the use of adaptive activation masks to selectively modify\nopacity regions in lung CXRs. Cross-domain alignment ensures translated CXRs\nwithout opacity issues align with feature maps and prediction labels from a\npre-trained CXR lesion classifier, facilitating the interpretability of the\ntranslation process.

Recent research has uncovered a widespread phenomenon in deep\nnetworks: the emergence of low-rank structures in weight matrices and learned\nrepresentations during training. These implicit low-dimensional patterns\nprovide valuable insights for improving the efficiency of training and\nfine-tuning large-scale models. Practical techniques inspired by this\nphenomenon, such as low-rank adaptation (LoRA) and training, enable significant\nreductions in computational cost while preserving model performance. In this\npaper, we present a comprehensive review of recent advances in exploiting\nlow-rank structures for deep learning and shed light on their mathematical\nfoundations. Mathematically, we present two complementary perspectives on\nunderstanding the low-rankness in deep networks: (i) the emergence of low-rank\nstructures throughout the whole optimization dynamics of gradient and (ii) the\nimplicit regularization effects that induce such low-rank structures at\nconvergence. From a practical standpoint, studying the low-rank learning\ndynamics of gradient descent offers a mathematical foundation for understanding\nthe effectiveness of LoRA in fine-tuning large-scale models and inspires\nparameter-efficient low-rank training strategies. Furthermore, the implicit\nlow-rank regularization effect helps explain the success of various masked\ntraining approaches in deep neural networks, ranging from dropout to masked\nself-supervised learning.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in large language models (LLMs), such as OpenAI-o1 and\nDeepSeek-R1, have demonstrated the effectiveness of test-time scaling, where\nextended reasoning processes substantially enhance model performance. Despite\nthis, current models are constrained by limitations in handling long texts and\nreinforcement learning (RL) training efficiency. To address these issues, we\npropose a simple yet effective test-time scaling approach Multi-round Thinking.\nThis method iteratively refines model reasoning by leveraging previous answers\nas prompts for subsequent rounds. Extensive experiments across multiple models,\nincluding QwQ-32B and DeepSeek-R1, consistently show performance improvements\non various benchmarks such as AIME 2024, MATH-500, GPQA-diamond, and\nLiveCodeBench. For instance, the accuracy of QwQ-32B improved from 80.3% (Round\n1) to 82.1% (Round 2) on the AIME 2024 dataset, while DeepSeek-R1 showed a\nsimilar increase from 79.7% to 82.0%. These results confirm that Multi-round\nThinking is a broadly applicable, straightforward approach to achieving stable\nenhancements in model performance, underscoring its potential for future\ndevelopments in test-time scaling techniques.

We overcome this by considering an extension of the\n$T\\overline{T}$ deformation with a boundary cosmological constant and a\nprescription for a sequence of flows that successfully pushes the cutoff\nboundary past the event horizon and arbitrarily close to the black hole\nsingularity. We show how this sequence avoids the complexification of the\ndeformed boundary energies. The approach to the singularity is reflected on the\nboundary by the approach of the deformed energies to an accumulation point in\nthe limit of arbitrarily large distance in deformation space. We argue that\nthis sequence of flows is automatically implemented by the gravitational path\nintegral given only the values of the initial ADM charges and the area of the\nfinite cutoff surface, suggesting a similar automatic boundary mechanism that\nkeeps all the deformed energies real at arbitrary values of the deformation\nparameter. This leads to a natural definition of a deformed boundary canonical\nensemble partition function that sums over the entire spectrum and remains real\nfor any value of the deformation parameter. We find that this partition\nfunction displays Hagedorn growth at the scale set by the deformation\nparameter, which we associate to the region near the inner horizon in the bulk\ndual.",

    "abstract": "Currently, instruction-based image editing methods have made significant\nprogress by leveraging the powerful cross-modal understanding capabilities of\nvision language models (VLMs). However, they still face challenges in three key\nareas: 1) complex scenarios; 2) semantic consistency; and 3) fine-grained\nediting. To address these issues, we propose FireEdit, an innovative\nFine-grained Instruction-based image editing framework that exploits a\nREgion-aware VLM. FireEdit is designed to accurately comprehend user\ninstructions and ensure effective control over the editing process.\nSpecifically, we enhance the fine-grained visual perception capabilities of the\nVLM by introducing additional region tokens. Relying solely on the output of\nthe LLM to guide the diffusion model may lead to suboptimal editing results.\nTherefore, we propose a Time-Aware Target Injection module and a Hybrid Visual\nCross Attention module. The former dynamically adjusts the guidance strength at\nvarious denoising stages by integrating timestep embeddings with the text\nembeddings. The latter enhances visual details for image editing, thereby\npreserving semantic consistency between the edited result and the source image.\nBy combining the VLM enhanced with fine-grained region tokens and the\ntime-dependent diffusion model, FireEdit demonstrates significant advantages in\ncomprehending editing instructions and maintaining high semantic consistency.\nExtensive experiments indicate that our approach surpasses the state-of-the-art\ninstruction-based image editing methods.

The classical proof that every maximal ideal in\n$\\mathbb{Z}[X]$ contains a prime number is revisited, highlighting its reliance\non non-constructive principles such as the law of excluded middle. A\nconstructive proof is then developed, replacing abstract constructs with\nexplicit case distinctions and direct computations in $\\mathbb{Z}[X]$.

Reconstituted fiber networks serve as valuable in vitro\nmodels to simplify the intricacy of in vivo systems for targeted\ninvestigations. Concurrently, advances in imaging enable microstructure\nvisualization and, through generative pipelines, modeling as discrete element\nnetworks. These mesoscale models provide insights into macroscale tissue\nbehavior.

Leveraging these networks, we generate models of\ninterconnected load-bearing fiber components that exhibit softening under\ncompression and are bending-resistant. The generative topology framework\nenables control over network-level features, such as fiber volume fraction and\ncross-link density, along with fiber-level properties, like length\ndistribution, to simulate changes driven by different polymerization\nconditions.

To facilitate this, a range of\ntechnologies and policies will be needed. Alternatives to traditional power\ngrid reinforcement, such as grid-enhancing technologies and system automation,\nare particularly attractive due to their potentially low cost and fast\ndeployment time. One alternative is System Integrity Protection Schemes (SIPS)\n- automatic and curative remedial actions (RAs) which can boost grid transfer\ncapacities without compromising with reliability since they can act faster than\nmanual control. The use of SIPS however is scattered, with limited coordination\nbetween countries, and the full potential of using SIPS for capacity\nenhancement is not yet realized. The aim of this paper is to provide a case\nstudy and comparison of SIPS in the Nordic countries, particularly in relation\nto capacity allocation. It also seeks to harmonize terminology relating to\nancillary services, RAs, and SIPS. Finally, it examines and compares the\ninclusion of RAs and SIPS in different Capacity Calculation Methodologies\n(CCMs). In both main EU CCMs - Net Transfer Capacity (NTC) and Flow-Based (FB)\n- RAs play a pronounced role. The paper is based on a survey and interviews\nwith Nordic stakeholders, along with a literature review and analysis of public\ndata. The results indicate a large variation in SIPS use across the Nordics.\nRegarding terminology, we suggest that SIPS is a subcategory of RAs which\noverlaps with ancillary services. Concerning CCMs, NTC is unable to fully\nrepresent capacity constraints in meshed AC systems, which in turn hinders\nsystematic capacity enhancement using RAs.

    "abstract": "Despite the recent progress of audio-driven video generation, existing\nmethods mostly focus on driving facial movements, leading to non-coherent head\nand body dynamics. Moving forward, it is desirable yet challenging to generate\nholistic human videos with both accurate lip-sync and delicate co-speech\ngestures w.r.t. given audio. In this work, we propose AudCast, a generalized\naudio-driven human video generation framework adopting a cascade\nDiffusion-Transformers (DiTs) paradigm, which synthesizes holistic human videos\nbased on a reference image and a given audio. 1) Firstly, an audio-conditioned\nHolistic Human DiT architecture is proposed to directly drive the movements of\nany human body with vivid gesture dynamics. 2) Then to enhance hand and face\ndetails that are well-knownly difficult to handle, a Regional Refinement DiT\nleverages regional 3D fitting as the bridge to reform the signals, producing\nthe final results. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework\ngenerates high-fidelity audio-driven holistic human videos with temporal\ncoherence and fine facial and hand details.

    "abstract": "Understanding the structural and functional organization of the human brain\nrequires a detailed examination of cortical folding patterns, among which the\nthree-hinge gyrus (3HG) has been identified as a key structural landmark.\nGyralNet, a network representation of cortical folding, models 3HGs as nodes\nand gyral crests as edges, highlighting their role as critical hubs in\ncortico-cortical connectivity. However, existing methods for analyzing 3HGs\nface significant challenges, including the sub-voxel scale of 3HGs at typical\nneuroimaging resolutions, the computational complexity of establishing\ncross-subject correspondences, and the oversimplification of treating 3HGs as\nindependent nodes without considering their community-level relationships. To\naddress these limitations, we propose a fully differentiable subnetwork\npartitioning framework that employs a spectral modularity maximization\noptimization strategy to modularize the organization of 3HGs within GyralNet.\nBy incorporating topological structural similarity and DTI-derived connectivity\npatterns as attribute features, our approach provides a biologically meaningful\nrepresentation of cortical organization.

However, it faces significant challenges\ndue to domain shifts caused by variations in sample sources (e.g., blood or\nbone marrow) and differing imaging conditions across hospitals. Traditional\ndeep learning models often suffer from catastrophic forgetting in such dynamic\nenvironments, while foundation models, though generally robust, experience\nperformance degradation when the distribution of inference data differs from\nthat of the training data. To address these challenges, we propose a generative\nreplay-based Continual Learning (CL) strategy designed to prevent forgetting in\nfoundation models for WBC classification. Our method employs lightweight\ngenerators to mimic past data with a synthetic latent representation to enable\nprivacy-preserving replay. To showcase the effectiveness, we carry out\nextensive experiments with a total of four datasets with different task\nordering and four backbone models including ResNet50, RetCCL, CTransPath, and\nUNI. Experimental results demonstrate that conventional fine-tuning methods\ndegrade performance on previously learned tasks and struggle with domain\nshifts. In contrast, our continual learning strategy effectively mitigates\ncatastrophic forgetting, preserving model performance across varying domains.\nThis work presents a practical solution for maintaining reliable WBC\nclassification in real-world clinical settings, where data distributions\nfrequently evolve.",

At equilibrium, the ferroelectric\npolarization is proportional to the strain, and is typically assumed to be so\nalso out of equilibrium. Decoupling the polarization from the strain would\nremove the constraint of sample design and provide an effective knob to\nmanipulate the polarization by light. Here, upon an above-bandgap laser\nexcitation of the prototypical ferroelectric BaTiO$_3$, we induce and measure\nan ultrafast decoupling between polarization and strain that begins within 350\nfs, by softening Ti-O bonds via charge transfer, and lasts for several tens of\npicoseconds. We show that the ferroelectric polarization out of equilibrium is\nmainly determined by photoexcited electrons, instead of the strain. This\nexcited state could serve as a starting point to achieve stable and reversible\npolarization switching via THz light.

    "abstract": "Topology optimization (TO) is a well-established methodology for structural\ndesign under user-defined constraints, e.g. minimum volume and maximum\nstiffness. However, such methods have traditionally been applied to static,\ndeterministic loading, in which modulus, position and direction are known and\ninvariant. This is against the probabilistic load combination used in the\nstructural engineering designs, and entails two important shortcomings.\n  The first one is related to maintenance and reliability: static loading fails\nto consider naturally occurring uncertainties in the loading process,\nmeasurements or regular service; also ignoring (quantitatively) unforeseen\nphenomena such as vibrations, and the material's behavior is assumed linear\nisotropic, ignoring fatigue, plasticity and anisotropy in functionally-graded\nmaterials. The second one concerns optimality itself: often times, the\nstructure presented as \"optimal\" in fact over-estimates loading and thus wastes\nmaterial by exceeding its real needs and/or distributing it poorly throughout\nthe design dominion.\n  In this article, a probabilistic framework is presented: uncertain and\npseudo-dynamic loading is introduced to create robust topologies via a\nreinforced SIMP scheme with embedded penalization addressing fatigue damage,\nlayer direction, mechanical response (traction/compression) and yield limit\n(von Mises equivalent stress). This computationally efficient framework is\napplied to various loading scenarios, generating diverse designs for the same\nvolume fraction constraint with improved and more realistic performances. Under\nthe proposed method, if loads are permanent and damage isotropic, the\nmethodology converges to the traditional (deterministic) topological\noptimization results. Future ramifications of this work are pondered,\nespecially regarding metamaterial design.",

In this framework, the Newtonian and cosmological constants in two\ndimensions are fully determined by the electric charge. The solution to this\ngravitational model is found to be trivial: a constant dilaton field on a flat\nmanifold.

Translating SAR images into optical images\nis a promising solution to enhance interpretation and support downstream tasks.\nMost existing research focuses on scene-level translation, with limited work on\nobject-level translation due to the scarcity of paired data and the challenge\nof accurately preserving contour and texture details. To address these issues,\nthis study proposes a keypoint-guided diffusion model (KeypointDiff) for\nSAR-to-optical image translation of unpaired aircraft targets. This framework\nintroduces supervision on target class and azimuth angle via keypoints, along\nwith a training strategy for unpaired data. Based on the classifier-free\nguidance diffusion architecture, a class-angle guidance module (CAGM) is\ndesigned to integrate class and angle information into the diffusion generation\nprocess. Furthermore, adversarial loss and consistency loss are employed to\nimprove image fidelity and detail quality, tailored for aircraft targets.\nDuring sampling, aided by a pre-trained keypoint detector, the model eliminates\nthe requirement for manually labeled class and azimuth information, enabling\nautomated SAR-to-optical translation. Experimental results demonstrate that the\nproposed method outperforms existing approaches across multiple metrics,\nproviding an efficient and effective solution for object-level SAR-to-optical\ntranslation and downstream tasks.

We apply this technique to leading\ngenerator libraries in OCaml and Scala 3, significantly improving performance.\nTo quantify the performance impact of the randomness source, we carry out a\ncontrolled experiment, replacing the randomness in the OCaml PBT library with\nan optimized version. Both interventions exactly preserve the semantics of\ngenerators, enabling precise, pointwise comparisons. Together, these\nimprovements find bugs up to $13\\times$ faster.",

We measure the correlation function of\nthese galaxies with tiny statistical uncertainties at the percent level and\nsystematic uncertainties up to 5\\%. A 4-parameter halo occupation distribution\n(HOD) model is fitted to retrieve the population of host halos, yielding\nresults on the stellar to halo mass relation consistent with the current models\nof galaxy formation and evolution. Using these complete galaxy samples, we\nmeasure and analyze the cross-correlation (X-corr) between galaxies and all\nsoft X-ray photons observed by SRG/eROSITA in the 0.5-2 keV band over\n$\\sim13,000$ deg$^2$. The cross correlation measurements have unprecedented\nsub-percent statistical uncertainty and ~5-10\\% systematic uncertainty.\n  An extension to the halo model is introduced to interpret the X-corr,\ndecomposing contributions from X-ray point sources, hot gas (CGM), satellites,\nand the 2-halo term. For low stellar mass thresholds ($\\log M^*/M_{\\odot}>$ 10,\n10.25, 10.5), we find that the point source emission dominates the X-corr at\nsmall separation ($r<80$kpc). Then, in the range ($80<r<2$Mpc), the emission\nfrom large halos hosting satellite galaxies dominates. Finally, on scales\nbeyond that considered here ($r>2$Mpc), the 2-halo term becomes dominant.\nInterestingly, there is no scale at which the CGM dominates. In the range\n($20<r<200$kpc), the CGM contributes to more than 10\\% of the signal.\nProgressively, with the minimum stellar mass increasing, the CGM emission\nincreases. We constrain the $M_{500c}-L_X$ scaling relation slope,\n$1.629^{+0.091}_{-0.089}$, at the 5\\% level using the samples with the lowest\nmass threshold.",

A common\napproach to mitigate these disadvantages is to introduce a fixed non-adaptive\nrandomization stage at the start of the RA design, known as the burn-in period.\nCurrently, investigations and guidance on the effect of the burn-in length are\nscarce. To this end, this paper provides an exact evaluation approach to\ninvestigate how the burn-in length impacts the statistical properties of\ntwo-arm binary RA designs. We show that (1) for commonly used calibration and\nasymptotic tests an increase in the burn-in length reduces type I error rate\ninflation but does not lead to strict type I error rate control, necessitating\nexact tests; (2) the burn-in length substantially influences the power and\nparticipant benefit, and these measures are often not maximized at the maximum\nor minimum possible burn-in length; (3) the conditional exact test conditioning\non total successes provides the highest average and minimum power for both\nsmall and moderate burn-in lengths compared to other tests. Using our exact\nanalysis method, we re-design the ARREST trial to improve its statistical\nproperties.",

PAVE introduces lightweight adapters,\nreferred to as \"patches,\" which add a small number of parameters and operations\nto a base model without modifying its architecture or pre-trained weights. In\ndoing so, PAVE can effectively adapt the pre-trained base model to support\ndiverse downstream tasks, including audio-visual question answering, 3D\nreasoning, multi-view video recognition, and high frame rate video\nunderstanding. Across these tasks, PAVE significantly enhances the performance\nof the base model, surpassing state-of-the-art task-specific models while\nincurring a minor cost of ~0.1% additional FLOPs and parameters. Further, PAVE\nsupports multi-task learning and generalizes well across different Video LLMs.\nOur code is available at https://github.com/dragonlzm/PAVE.",

A comparative evaluation\nof our two methods with adapted versions of several state-of-the art models\nshows that our GAN-based brush produces the sharpest and most detailed outputs\nwhile preserving image context while the evaluated state-of-the-art models tend\ntowards blurrier results and exhibit difficulties in maintaining contextual\nconsistency.",

    "abstract": "Image generation technology has brought significant advancements across\nvarious fields but has also raised concerns about data misuse and potential\nrights infringements, particularly with respect to creating visual artworks.\nCurrent methods aimed at safeguarding artworks often employ adversarial\nattacks. However, these methods face challenges such as poor transferability,\nhigh computational costs, and the introduction of noticeable noise, which\ncompromises the aesthetic quality of the original artwork. To address these\nlimitations, we propose a Structurally Imperceptible and Transferable\nAdversarial (SITA) attacks. SITA leverages a CLIP-based destylization loss,\nwhich decouples and disrupts the robust style representation of the image. This\ndisruption hinders style extraction during stylized image generation, thereby\nimpairing the overall stylization process. Importantly, SITA eliminates the\nneed for a surrogate diffusion model, leading to significantly reduced\ncomputational overhead. The method's robust style feature disruption ensures\nhigh transferability across diverse models. Moreover, SITA introduces\nperturbations by embedding noise within the imperceptible structural details of\nthe image. This approach effectively protects against style extraction without\ncompromising the visual quality of the artwork. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that SITA offers superior protection for artworks against\nunauthorized use in stylized generation. It significantly outperforms existing\nmethods in terms of transferability, computational efficiency, and noise\nimperceptibility. Code is available at https://github.com/A-raniy-day/SITA.",

We\nuse a sample of star-forming galaxies from a comprehensive range of\nenvironments and across a wide stellar mass range and discuss the correlation\nbetween the environment and the galaxy's internal properties, including its\nmetallicity from the present-day gas-phase value measured from emission-lines\nand its past evolution as imprinted in its stellar populations. We build a\nsimple yet comprehensive galaxy chemical evolution model, which is constrained\nby the gas-phase metallicities, stacked spectra and photometry of galaxies to\nreach a full description of the galaxies' past star formation and chemical\nevolution histories in different environments. We reproduce the `downsizing'\nformation of galaxies in both their star formation histories and chemical\nevolution histories at $z\\sim0.73$ so that more massive galaxies tend to grow\ntheir stellar mass and become enriched in metals earlier than less massive\nones. In addition, the current gas-phase metallicity of a galaxy and its past\nevolution correlate with the environment it inhabits. Galaxies in groups,\nespecially massive groups that have X-ray counterparts, tend to have higher\ngas-phase metallicities and are enriched in metals earlier than field galaxies\nof similar stellar mass. Galaxies in the highest stellar mass bin and located\nin X-ray groups exhibit a more complex and varied chemical composition.\nStrangulation due to interactions with the group environment, leading to an\nearly cessation of gas supply, may have driven the faster mass growth and\nchemical enrichment observed in group galaxies. Additionally, the removal of\nmetal-enriched gas could play a key role in the evolution of the most massive\ngalaxies. Alternative mechanisms other than environmental processes are also\ndiscussed.",

    "abstract": "An adaptive refinement strategy, based on an equilibrated flux a posteriori\nerror estimator, is proposed in the context of defeaturing problems.\nDefeaturing consists in removing features from complex domains in order to ease\nthe meshing process, and to reduce the computational burden of simulations. It\nis a common procedure, for example, in computer aided design for simulation\nbased manufacturing. However, depending on the problem at hand, the effect of\ngeometrical simplification on the accuracy of the solution may be detrimental.\nThe proposed adaptive strategy is hence twofold: starting from a defeatured\ngeometry it allows both for standard mesh refinement and geometrical\nrefinement, which consists in choosing, at each step, which features need to be\nincluded into the geometry in order to significantly increase the accuracy of\nthe solution. With respect to other estimators that were previously proposed in\nthe context of defeaturing, the use of an equilibrated flux reconstruction\nallows us to avoid the evaluation of the numerical flux on the boundary of\nfeatures. This makes the estimator and the adaptive strategy particularly\nwell-suited for finite element discretizations, in which the numerical flux is\ntypically discontinuous across element edges. The inclusion of the features\nduring the adaptive process is tackled by a CutFEM strategy, in order to\npreserve the non conformity of the mesh to the feature boundary and never\nremesh the computational domain as the features are added. Hence, the estimator\nalso accounts for the error introduced by weakly imposing the boundary\nconditions on the boundary of the added features.",

The two primary approaches in the\nexperimental mechanics' community for calibration from full-field digital image\ncorrelation data are known as finite element model updating (FEMU) and the\nvirtual fields method (VFM). In VFM, the objective function is a squared\nmismatch between internal and external virtual work or power. In FEMU, the\nobjective function quantifies the weighted mismatch between model predictions\nand corresponding experimentally measured quantities of interest. It is\nminimized by iteratively updating the parameters of an FE model. While FEMU is\nseen as more flexible, VFM is commonly used instead of FEMU due to its\nconsiderably greater computational expense. However, comparisons between the\ntwo methods usually involve approximations of gradients or sensitivities with\nfinite difference schemes, thereby making direct assessments difficult. Hence,\nin this study, we rigorously compare VFM and FEMU in the context of\nnumerically-exact sensitivities obtained through local sensitivity analyses and\nthe application of automatic differentiation software. To this end, both\nmethods are tested on a finite strain elastoplasticity model. We conduct a\nseries of test cases to assess both methods' robustness under practical\nchallenges.",

This resolves long-standing ambiguities\nin the nonlinear theory of synchronization and provides a systematic\nclassification of asymptotic behaviors in finite-size oscillator networks. The\nframework further provides sharpened necessary conditions for synchronization\nacross both first- and second-order classical Kuramoto flows, by establishing\nupper and lower bounds on the long-time behavior of the order parameter.\n  Beyond its mathematical depth, our theory offers a broadly applicable\nframework that may inform future studies in nonlinear optics, quantum\nsynchronization, and collective behavior in open systems.

Building on this success, this document outlines the scientific case\nand design considerations for an upgraded FASER neutrino detector to operate\nduring LHC Run 4 and beyond. The proposed detector will significantly enhance\nthe neutrino physics program by increasing event statistics, improving flavor\nidentification, and enabling precision measurements of neutrino interactions at\nthe highest man-made energies. Key objectives include measuring neutrino cross\nsections, probing proton structure and forward QCD dynamics, testing lepton\nflavor universality, and searching for beyond-the-Standard Model physics.\nSeveral detector configurations are under study, including high-granularity\nscintillator-based tracking calorimeters, high-precision silicon tracking\nlayers, and advanced emulsion-based detectors for exclusive event\nreconstruction.

Among the sample of 9\nexoplanets in the programme, here we aim to determine whether TOI-1468 b has a\nsubstantial atmosphere or is consistent with a low-albedo bare rock. The James\nWebb Space Telescope provides an opportunity to characterise the thermal\nemission with MIRI at 15 $\\mu$m. TOI-1468 b's occultation was observed three\ntimes. We compare our observations to atmospheric models including varying\namounts of CO$_{2}$ and H$_{2}$O. The observed occultation depth for the\nindividual visits are 239$\\pm$52 ppm, 341$\\pm$53 ppm and 357$\\pm$52 ppm. A\njoint fit yields an occultation depth of 311$\\pm$31 ppm.

Surprisingly, TOI-1468 b presents a surface\nmarginally hotter than expected, hinting at an additional source of energy on\nthe planet. It could originate from a temperature inversion, induction heating\nor be an instrumental artifact.

    "abstract": "Segmentation is a fundamental task in computer vision, with prompt-driven\nmethods gaining prominence due to their flexibility. The Segment Anything Model\n(SAM) excels at point-prompted segmentation, while text-based models, often\nleveraging powerful multimodal encoders like BEIT-3, provide rich semantic\nunderstanding. However, effectively combining these complementary modalities\nremains a challenge. This paper introduces BiPrompt-SAM, a novel dual-modal\nprompt segmentation framework employing an explicit selection mechanism. We\nleverage SAM's ability to generate multiple mask candidates from a single point\nprompt and use a text-guided mask (generated via EVF-SAM with BEIT-3) to select\nthe point-generated mask that best aligns spatially, measured by Intersection\nover Union (IoU). This approach, interpretable as a simplified Mixture of\nExperts (MoE), effectively fuses spatial precision and semantic context without\ncomplex model modifications. Notably, our method achieves strong zero-shot\nperformance on the Endovis17 medical dataset (89.55% mDice, 81.46% mIoU) using\nonly a single point prompt per instance. This significantly reduces annotation\nburden compared to bounding boxes and aligns better with practical clinical\nworkflows, demonstrating the method's effectiveness without domain-specific\ntraining. On the RefCOCO series, BiPrompt-SAM attained 87.1%, 86.5%, and 85.8%\nIoU, significantly outperforming existing approaches. Experiments show\nBiPrompt-SAM excels in scenarios requiring both spatial accuracy and semantic\ndisambiguation, offering a simple, effective, and interpretable perspective on\nmulti-modal prompt fusion.",

One of the functionalities that Fermilab experimenters rely on is the\nability to automate batch job submission, which in turn depends on the ability\nto securely refresh and distribute the necessary credentials to experiment job\nsubmit points. Thus, with the transition to using tokens for grid operations,\nwe needed to create a service that would obtain, refresh, and distribute tokens\nfor experimenters' use. This service would avoid the need for experimenters to\nbe experts in obtaining their own tokens and would better protect the most\nsensitive long-lived credentials. Further, the service needed to be widely\nscalable, as Fermilab hosts many experiments, each of which would need their\nown credentials. To address these issues, we created and deployed a Managed\nTokens service. The service is written in Go, taking advantage of that\nlanguage's native concurrency primitives to easily be able to scale operations\nas we onboard experiments. The service uses as its first credentials a set of\nkerberos keytabs, stored on the same secure machine that the Managed Tokens\nservice runs on. These kerberos credentials allow the service to use htgettoken\nvia condor_vault_storer to store vault tokens in the HTCondor credential\nmanagers (credds) that run on the batch system scheduler machines (HTCondor\nschedds); as well as downloading a local, shorter-lived copy of the vault\ntoken.

However, deep learning methods for\ninterval-censored data, where the unobservable failure time is only known to\nlie in an interval, remain underexplored and limited to specific data type or\nmodel. This work proposes a general regression framework for interval-censored\ndata with a broad class of partially linear transformation models, where key\ncovariate effects are modeled parametrically while nonlinear effects of\nnuisance multi-modal covariates are approximated via DNNs, balancing\ninterpretability and flexibility. We employ sieve maximum likelihood estimation\nby leveraging monotone splines to approximate the cumulative baseline hazard\nfunction. To ensure reliable and tractable estimation, we develop an EM\nalgorithm incorporating stochastic gradient descent. We establish the\nasymptotic properties of parameter estimators and show that the DNN estimator\nachieves minimax-optimal convergence. Extensive simulations demonstrate\nsuperior estimation and prediction accuracy over state-of-the-art methods.\nApplying our method to the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative dataset\nyields novel insights and improved predictive performance compared to\ntraditional approaches.",

In contrast to conventional magic state distillation (MSD) combined\nwith gate teleportation, our method obviates the need for concatenating\nseparate codes for distillation and logical qubits, thus reducing the total\noverhead from multiplicative to additive scaling.

We present\nDita, a scalable framework that leverages Transformer architectures to directly\ndenoise continuous action sequences through a unified multimodal diffusion\nprocess. Departing from prior methods that condition denoising on fused\nembeddings via shallow networks, Dita employs in-context conditioning --\nenabling fine-grained alignment between denoised actions and raw visual tokens\nfrom historical observations. This design explicitly models action deltas and\nenvironmental nuances. By scaling the diffusion action denoiser alongside the\nTransformer's scalability, Dita effectively integrates cross-embodiment\ndatasets across diverse camera perspectives, observation scenes, tasks, and\naction spaces. Such synergy enhances robustness against various variances and\nfacilitates the successful execution of long-horizon tasks. Evaluations across\nextensive benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art or comparative performance in\nsimulation. Notably, Dita achieves robust real-world adaptation to\nenvironmental variances and complex long-horizon tasks through 10-shot\nfinetuning, using only third-person camera inputs.

In addition to depolarisation, some\nrepeating sources (in particular those with active magneto-ionic environments)\nhave been identified to have co-located persistent radio sources (PRS).\nSearches for depolarisation of non-repeating sources are challenging due to the\nlimited bandwidth of most FRB detection systems used to detect one-off bursts.\nHowever, even with a limited bandwidth, such depolarisation can be identified\nif it lies within the $\\rm \\sigma^{\\prime}_{RM}$ sensitivity window of the\ntelescope. In this paper, we present a search for depolarisation in $12$\none-off FRBs detected by the Australian SKA Pathfinder. We report on the first\nstrongly depolarised FRB detected by ASKAP (FRB$~$20230526A) and a marginal\ndetection of depolarisation in a second. We also report constraints on the\npresence of a PRS coincident with FRB$~$20230526A using observations obtained\nwith the Australia Telescope Compact Array. We use this to study the\nrelationship between $\\rm \\sigma^{\\prime}_{RM}$ and PRS luminosity. Our\ninvestigation supports a scenario in which repeaters and non-repeaters share a\ncommon origin and where non-repeaters represent an older population relative to\nrepeating FRBs.",

    "abstract": "When prior information is lacking, the go-to strategy for probabilistic\ninference is to combine a \"default prior\" and the likelihood via Bayes's\ntheorem. Objective Bayes, (generalized) fiducial inference, etc. fall under\nthis umbrella. This construction is natural, but the corresponding posterior\ndistributions generally only offer limited, approximately valid uncertainty\nquantification. The present paper takes a reimagined approach offering\nposterior distributions with stronger reliability properties. The proposed\nconstruction starts with an inferential model (IM), one that takes the\nmathematical form of a data-driven possibility measure and features exactly\nvalid uncertainty quantification, and then returns a so-called inner\nprobabilistic approximation thereof. This inner probabilistic approximation\ninherits many of the original IM's desirable properties, including credible\nsets with exact coverage and asymptotic efficiency. The approximation also\nagrees with the familiar Bayes/fiducial solution obtained in applications where\nthe model has a group transformation structure. A Monte Carlo method for\nevaluating the probabilistic approximation is presented, along with numerical\nillustrations.",

    "abstract": "Context: The environments of young star clusters are shaped by the\ninteractions of the powerful winds of massive stars, and their feedback on the\ncluster birth cloud. Several such clusters show diffuse gamma-ray emission on\nthe degree scale, which hints at ongoing particle acceleration. Aims: To date,\nparticle acceleration and transport in star-cluster environments are not well\nunderstood. A characterisation of magnetic fields and flow structures is\nnecessary to progress toward physical models. Previous work has largely focused\non 100 pc scale feedback or detailed modelling of wind interaction of just a\nfew stars. We aim to bridge this gap. We focus in particular on compact\nclusters to study collective effects arising from stellar-wind interaction.\nObjects in this class include Westerlund 1 and R136. Methods: We perform 3D\nideal-MHD simulations of compact, young, massive star clusters. Stellar winds\nare injected kinetically for 46 individual very massive stars (M > 40 Msun),\ndistributed in a spherical region of radius 0.6 - 1 pc. We include a\nsub-population of five magnetic stars with increased dipole field strengths of\n0.1 - 1 kG. We study the evolving superbubble over several 100 kyrs. Results:\nThe bulk flow and magnetic fields show an intricate, non-uniform morphology,\nwhich is critically impacted by the relative position of individual stars. The\ncluster wind terminates in a strong shock, which is non-spherical and, like the\nflow, has non-uniform properties. The magnetic field is both composed of highly\ntangled sections and coherent quasi-radial field-line bundles. Steep particle\nspectra in the TeV domain arise naturally from the variation of magnetic field\nmagnitude over the cluster-wind termination shock. This finding is consistent\nwith gamma-ray observations. The scenario of PeV particle acceleration at the\ncluster-wind termination shock is deemed unlikely.",

To validate the performance of InterSliceBoost, we utilized a dataset of\n76 B-mode ultrasound scans acquired on 29 subjects enrolled in an ongoing cLBP\nstudy. InterSliceBoost, trained on only 33% of the image slices, achieved a\nmean Dice coefficient of 80.84% across all six layers on the independent test\nset, with Dice coefficients of 73.48%, 61.11%, 81.87%, 95.74%, 83.52% and\n88.74% for segmenting dermis, superficial fat, superficial fascial membrane,\ndeep fat, deep fascial membrane, and muscle. This performance is significantly\nhigher than the conventional model trained on fully annotated images (p<0.05).\nInterSliceBoost can effectively segment the six tissue layers depicted on 3-D\nB-model ultrasound images in settings with partial annotations.",

To address this, a parallel sampling method\nbased on Picard iteration was introduced, effectively reducing sequential steps\nwhile ensuring exact convergence to the original output. Nonetheless, Picard\niteration does not guarantee faster convergence, which can still result in slow\ngeneration in practice. In this work, we propose a new parallelization scheme,\nthe Picard Consistency Model (PCM), which significantly reduces the number of\ngeneration steps in Picard iteration. Inspired by the consistency model, PCM is\ndirectly trained to predict the fixed-point solution, or the final output, at\nany stage of the convergence trajectory. Additionally, we introduce a new\nconcept called model switching, which addresses PCM's limitations and ensures\nexact convergence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PCM achieves up to a\n2.71x speedup over sequential sampling and a 1.77x speedup over Picard\niteration across various tasks, including image generation and robotic control.",

To\nvalidate this concept, a series of CrN(111) films with controlled N\nconcentrations (approximately from 0.0 to 5.0 at.%) were epitaxially grown on\nAl2O3(0001) substrates. Experimental characterization reveals that higher N\nvacancy concentrations significantly facilitate the out-of-plane contraction of\nthe films at 273 K (0.8%), reaching up to 60% of the contraction magnitude of\nCrN powders (1.2%) without compromising the stability and reproducibility of\nthe phase transition. Reducing N vacancy concentrations diminishes the lattice\ncontraction, lowers the phase transition temperature to 193 K, and triggers a\nmetallic to insulator transition in electrical behavior. First-principles\ncalculations corroborate these findings, showing that N vacancies decrease the\ninternal tensile stress within triangular Cr atomic layers, which enhances the\nout-of-plane contraction, elevates phase transition temperatures, and promotes\nbandgap closure.

    "abstract": "Leveraging its robust linear global modeling capability, Mamba has notably\nexcelled in computer vision. Despite its success, existing Mamba-based vision\nmodels have overlooked the nuances of event-driven tasks, especially in video\nreconstruction. Event-based video reconstruction (EBVR) demands spatial\ntranslation invariance and close attention to local event relationships in the\nspatio-temporal domain. Unfortunately, conventional Mamba algorithms apply\nstatic window partitions and standard reshape scanning methods, leading to\nsignificant losses in local connectivity. To overcome these limitations, we\nintroduce EventMamba--a specialized model designed for EBVR tasks. EventMamba\ninnovates by incorporating random window offset (RWO) in the spatial domain,\nmoving away from the restrictive fixed partitioning. Additionally, it features\na new consistent traversal serialization approach in the spatio-temporal\ndomain, which maintains the proximity of adjacent events both spatially and\ntemporally. These enhancements enable EventMamba to retain Mamba's robust\nmodeling capabilities while significantly preserving the spatio-temporal\nlocality of event data. Comprehensive testing on multiple datasets shows that\nEventMamba markedly enhances video reconstruction, drastically improving\ncomputation speed while delivering superior visual quality compared to\nTransformer-based methods.",

However, existing Koopman operator-based methods suffer from\nshortcomings in constructing the well-behaved observable function and its\ninverse and are inefficient enough when dealing with partial differential\nequations (PDEs). To address these issues, this paper proposes the Invertible\nKoopman Neural Operator (IKNO), a novel data-driven modeling approach inspired\nby the Koopman operator theory and neural operator. IKNO leverages an\nInvertible Neural Network to parameterize observable function and its inverse\nsimultaneously under the same learnable parameters, explicitly guaranteeing the\nreconstruction relation, thus eliminating the dependency on the reconstruction\nloss, which is an essential improvement over the original Koopman Neural\nOperator (KNO). The structured linear matrix inspired by the Koopman operator\ntheory is parameterized to learn the evolution of observables' low-frequency\nmodes in the frequency space rather than directly in the observable space,\nsustaining IKNO is resolution-invariant like other neural operators. Moreover,\nwith preprocessing such as interpolation and dimension expansion, IKNO can be\nextended to operator learning tasks defined on non-Cartesian domains. We fully\nsupport the above claims based on rich numerical and real-world examples and\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of IKNO and superiority over other neural\noperators.",

Our study reveals that the\nmaximum of the magnetization of the outer sublattice corresponds to smaller\nratio parameter $g={J_{//}}/{J_{\\bot}}$, a finding that is verified using the\nfinite-size extrapolation. As $g$ decreases, the excitation spectra gradually\nevolve from a degenerate magnon mode with continua to low-energy and\nhigh-energy branches.

    "abstract": "Generative Information Retrieval (GenIR) is a novel paradigm in which a\ntransformer encoder-decoder model predicts document rankings based on a query\nin an end-to-end fashion. These GenIR models have received significant\nattention due to their simple retrieval architecture while maintaining high\nretrieval effectiveness. However, in contrast to established retrieval\narchitectures like cross-encoders or bi-encoders, their internal computations\nremain largely unknown. Therefore, this work studies the internal retrieval\nprocess of GenIR models by applying methods based on mechanistic\ninterpretability, such as patching and vocabulary projections. By replacing the\nGenIR encoder with one trained on fewer documents, we demonstrate that the\ndecoder is the primary component responsible for successful retrieval. Our\npatching experiments reveal that not all components in the decoder are crucial\nfor the retrieval process. More specifically, we find that a pass through the\ndecoder can be divided into three stages: (I) the priming stage, which\ncontributes important information for activating subsequent components in later\nlayers; (II) the bridging stage, where cross-attention is primarily active to\ntransfer query information from the encoder to the decoder; and (III) the\ninteraction stage, where predominantly MLPs are active to predict the document\nidentifier. Our findings indicate that interaction between query and document\ninformation occurs only in the last stage.

Two specialized\nnetworks form the core of the framework: a quaternion-based Rigid Net for rigid\nmotion and a coordinate-based Deformation Net for local deformation. By\nindependently handling fundamentally distinct physical phenomena, the proposed\narchitecture achieves accurate predictions without requiring separate\nsupervision for each component. The model, trained on only 10% of available\nsimulation data, significantly outperforms baseline models, including single\nmulti-layer perceptron (MLP) and deep operator networks (DeepONet), with\nprediction errors reduced by up to 83%. Extensive validation demonstrates\nstrong generalization to collision conditions outside the training range,\naccurately predicting responses even under severe impacts involving extreme\nvelocities and large impact angles.

We analyze 13 state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models, uncovering\npivotal insights into their spatial reasoning performance. Our results reveal\nprofound shortcomings in current VLMs, with average accuracy across the 13\nmodels approximating random chance, highlighting spatial reasoning as a\npersistent obstacle. This work not only exposes the pressing need to advance\nspatial reasoning within VLMs but also establishes a solid platform for future\nexploration.

    "abstract": "Traditionally, mobile wallets rely on a trusted server that provides them\nwith a current view of the blockchain, and thus, these wallets do not need to\nvalidate the header chain or transaction inclusion themselves. If a mobile\nwallet were to validate a header chain and inclusion of its transactions, it\nwould require significant storage and performance overhead, which is\nchallenging and expensive to ensure on resource-limited devices, such as\nsmartphones. Moreover, such an overhead would be multiplied by the number of\ncryptocurrencies the user holds in a wallet. Therefore, we introduce a novel\napproach, called FeatherWallet, to mobile wallet synchronization designed to\neliminate trust in a server while providing efficient utilization of resources.\nOur approach addresses the challenges associated with storage and bandwidth\nrequirements by off-chaining validation of header chains using SNARK-based\nproofs of chain extension, which are verified by a smart contract. This offers\nus a means of storing checkpoints in header chains of multiple blockchains. The\nkey feature of our approach is the ability of mobile clients to update their\npartial local header chains using checkpoints derived from the proof\nverification results stored in the smart contract. In the evaluation, we\ncreated zk-SNARK proofs for the 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64 headers within our\ntrustless off-chain service. For 64-header proofs, the off-chain service\nproducing proofs requires at least 40 GB of RAM, while the minimal gas\nconsumption is achieved for 12 proofs bundled in a single transaction. We\nachieved a 20-fold reduction in storage overhead for a mobile client in\ncontrast to traditional SPV clients. Although we have developed a\nproof-of-concept for PoW blockchains, the whole approach can be extended in\nprinciple to other consensus mechanisms, e.g., PoS.",

We analyze whether Myers-Briggs Type Indicator\n(MBTI) personality types impact the dynamics of interactions on an anonymous\nchat system with over 288,000 messages from 6,076 users. Using a data set\nincluding 940 users voluntarily providing MBTI typing and gender, we create a\nweighted undirected network and apply network-science measures-such as\nassortativity, centrality measures, and community detection with the Louvain\nalgorithm-to estimate the level of personality-based homophily and heterophily.\nContrary to previous observations in structured social settings, our research\nshows a dominance of heterophilous interactions (89.3%), particularly among\ncognitively complementary types, i.e., NT (Intuitive-Thinking) and NF\n(Intuitive-Feeling). However, there is a moderate level of personality-based\nhomophily (10.7%), notably among introverted intuitive personalities (e.g.,\nINTJ, INFP, INFJ), reflecting an underlying cognitive alignment that persists\nregardless of identity markers. The interaction network exhibits scale-free\nproperties with a power-law exponent of 1.45. In contrast, gender is a stronger\nhomophily attribute, as evidenced by stronger levels of female users' group\ninteractions compared with male users. While MBTI type influences minor\ninteraction preferences, community structure exhibits low modularity (Q =\n0.2584). The findings indicate that, in the absence of identity cues,\npsychological traits subtly shape online behavior, blending exploratory\nheterophily with subtle homophilic inclinations.",

Second, when\ndealing with medical image targets characterized by irregular shapes and\ncomplex structures, segmentation often relies on narrowing the bounding box to\nrefine segmentation intent.

Compared to the cINNs presented in our first study, the\nupdated cINN considers the influence of the relative flux error on the\nparameter estimation and predicts an additional fourth parameter, veiling. We\ntest the performance of cINN on synthetic test models to quantify the intrinsic\nerror of the cINN as a function of relative flux error and on 36 class III\ntemplate stars to validate the performance on real spectra. Using our cINN, we\nestimate the stellar parameters of young stars in Trumpler 14 (Tr14) in the\nCarina Nebula Complex, observed with VLT-MUSE, and compare them with those\nderived using the classical template fitting method. We provide Teff, log g,\nAv, and veiling values measured by our cINN as well as stellar ages and masses\nderived from the HR diagram. Our parameter estimates generally agree well with\nthose measured by template fitting. However, for K- and G-type stars, the Teff\nderived from template fitting is, on average, 2-3 subclasses hotter than the\ncINN estimates, while the corresponding veiling values from template fitting\nappear to be underestimated compared to the cINN predictions. We obtain an\naverage age of 0.7(+3.2)(-0.6) Myr for the Tr14 stars. By examining the impact\nof veiling on the equivalent width-based classification, we demonstrate that\nthe main cause of temperature overestimation for K- and G-type stars in the\nprevious study is that veiling and effective temperature are not considered\nsimultaneously in their process.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive versatility as general\npurpose models. However, their broad applicability comes at a high-cost\ncomputational overhead, particularly in auto-regressive decoding where each\nstep requires a forward pass. In domain-specific settings, general-purpose\ncapabilities are unnecessary and can be exchanged for efficiency. In this work,\nwe take a novel perspective on domain adaptation, reducing latency and\ncomputational costs by adapting the vocabulary to focused domains of interest.\nWe introduce AdaptiVocab, an end-to-end approach for vocabulary adaptation,\ndesigned to enhance LLM efficiency in low-resource domains. AdaptiVocab can be\napplied to any tokenizer and architecture, modifying the vocabulary by\nreplacing tokens with domain-specific n-gram-based tokens, thereby reducing the\nnumber of tokens required for both input processing and output generation.\nAdaptiVocab initializes new n-token embeddings using an exponentially weighted\ncombination of existing embeddings and employs a lightweight fine-tuning phase\nthat can be efficiently performed on a single GPU. We evaluate two 7B LLMs\nacross three niche domains, assessing efficiency, generation quality, and\nend-task performance. Our results show that AdaptiVocab reduces token usage by\nover 25% without compromising performance",

In an adaptive strategy, the user state with respect to the\ncurrent state of understanding and processing capacity was estimated via a\nscoring scheme based on task performance, prior scaffolding strategy, and\ncurrent eye gaze behavior. In the study, the adaptive strategy of providing\nnegations and hesitations was compared with a non-adaptive strategy of\nproviding only affirmations. The adaptive scaffolding strategy was generated\nusing the computational model SHIFT. Our findings indicate that using adaptive\nscaffolding strategies with SHIFT tends to (1) increased processing costs, as\nreflected in longer reaction times, but (2) improved task understanding,\nevidenced by a lower error rate of almost 23%. We assessed the efficiency of\nSHIFT's selected scaffolding strategies across different cognitive states,\nfinding that in three out of five states, the error rate was lower compared to\nthe baseline condition.

This paper proposes a risk-aware\nreinforcement learning approach for autonomous driving to improve the safety\nperformance when crossing the intersection. Safe critics are constructed to\nevaluate driving risk and work in conjunction with the reward critic to update\nthe actor. Based on this, a Lagrangian relaxation method and cyclic gradient\niteration are combined to project actions into a feasible safe region.\nFurthermore, a Multi-hop and Multi-layer perception (MLP) mixed Attention\nMechanism (MMAM) is incorporated into the actor-critic network, enabling the\npolicy to adapt to dynamic traffic and overcome permutation sensitivity\nchallenges. This allows the policy to focus more effectively on surrounding\npotential risks while enhancing the identification of passing opportunities.\nSimulation tests are conducted on different tasks at unsignalized\nintersections. The results show that the proposed approach effectively reduces\ncollision rates and improves crossing efficiency in comparison to baseline\nalgorithms.

This conflation makes it difficult to isolate the effects of\nmeasurement inconsistencies from deficiencies in the turbulence model. In\ncontrast, three-dimensional assimilation allows the corrective forcing term to\nprimarily address experimental setup errors while enabling the turbulence model\nto more accurately capture the flow physics.

Short-term\npulsatile dynamics of compliant vessels affects the long-term structures of\nadapting networks; however, what the correct adaptation rule is for pulsatile\nflows still remains an open question. Here we propose a new adaptation rule for\nperiodically driven complex elastic networks that accounts for the effect of\nshort-term pulsatile dynamics on the remodeling signal at long time-scales.\nUsing this rule to adapt hierarchical elastic networks with multiple levels of\nlooping, we show that very different network architectures are possible at\nsteady-state depending on the driving frequency of the pulsatile source and the\ngeometric asymmetry of the paths between the externally driven nodes of the\nnetwork. Specifically resonant frequencies are shown to prioritize the\nstabilization of fully looped structures or higher level loops proximal to the\nsource, whereas anti-resonant frequencies predominantly stabilize loop-less\nstructures or lower-level loops distal to the source. Thus, this model offers a\nmechanism that can explain the stabilization of phenotypically diverse loopy\nnetwork architectures in response to source pulsatility under physiologically\nrelevant conditions and in the absence of other known loop stabilization\nmechanisms, such as random fluctuations in the load or perfusion\nhomogenization.",

    "abstract": "To leverage the vast amounts of onboard data while ensuring privacy and\nsecurity, federated learning (FL) is emerging as a promising technology for\nsupporting a wide range of vehicular applications. Although FL has great\npotential to improve the architecture of intelligent vehicular networks,\nchallenges arise due to vehicle mobility, wireless channel instability, and\ndata heterogeneity. To mitigate the issue of heterogeneous data across\nvehicles, artificial intelligence-generated content (AIGC) can be employed as\nan innovative data synthesis technique to enhance FL model performance. In this\npaper, we propose AIGC-assisted Federated Learning for Vehicular Edge\nIntelligence (GenFV). We further propose a weighted policy using the Earth\nMover's Distance (EMD) to quantify data distribution heterogeneity and\nintroduce a convergence analysis for GenFV. Subsequently, we analyze system\ndelay and formulate a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem to\nminimize system delay. To solve this MINLP NP-hard problem, we propose a\ntwo-scale algorithm. At large communication scale, we implement label sharing\nand vehicle selection based on velocity and data heterogeneity. At the small\ncomputation scale, we optimally allocate bandwidth, transmission power and\namount of generated data. Extensive experiments show that GenFV significantly\nimproves the performance and robustness of FL in dynamic, resource-constrained\nenvironments, outperforming other schemes and confirming the effectiveness of\nour approach.",

Most known LOCAL certification protocols are specifically\ntailored to the problem they work on and cannot be translated more generally.\nThus we target general protocols that can certify any property expressible\nwithin a certain logical framework. We consider Monadic Second Order Logic\n(MSO$_2$), a powerful framework that can express properties such as\nnon-$k$-colorability, Hamiltonicity, and $H$-minor-freeness. Unfortunately, in\ngeneral, there are MSO$_2$-expressible properties that cannot be certified\nwithout huge certificates.

This limitation arises because current CLIP formulations rely\non global image features, which overlook the fine-grained semantics and\ncontextual details crucial for complex tasks like zero-shot triplet\nrecognition. Furthermore, these models do not explore the hierarchical\nstructure inherent in triplets, reducing their ability to generalize to novel\ntriplets.

Since triplet classification is a\nchallenging task, we introduce an alternative yet meaningful base-to-novel\ngeneralization benchmark with two settings on the CholecT50 dataset:\nUnseen-Target, assessing adaptability to triplets with novel anatomical\nstructures, and Unseen-Instrument-Verb, where models need to generalize to\nnovel instrument-verb interactions. fine-CLIP shows significant improvements in\nF1 and mAP, enhancing zero-shot recognition of novel surgical triplets.",

In consequence, main challenge today is the automatic\ntranslation among spatiotemporal sign representation and natural text language.\nRecent approaches are based on encoder-decoder architectures, where the most\nrelevant strategies integrate attention modules to enhance non-linear\ncorrespondences, besides, many of these approximations require complex training\nand architectural schemes to achieve reasonable predictions, because of the\nabsence of intermediate text projections.

    "abstract": "Due to the persistence of latently infected CD4$^+$ T cells, achieving a\nfunctional cure for HIV-1 remains a significant challenge since the viruses are\nable to evade immune clearance, which in turn enables post-treatment viral\nrebound. Because traditional deterministic models assume a constant\nreactivation rate, they fail to capture the stochastic nature of latency\nreversal influenced by immune perturbations and ART pharmacokinetics. Thus, in\nthis study, by using a Poisson-driven stochastic framework that incorporates\nfluctuations in activation rates, we study viral rebound dynamics. Via an\nexponentially decreasing drug washout model, we accurately quantifies the\nnonlinear interplay between ART decay and stochastic reactivation, improving\nthe theoretical estimates of post-treatment control. Beyond the introduction of\nstochasticity, our model establishes a time-dependent viral reactivation\nframework that integrates periodic and random perturbations in the activation\nrates. Unlike conventional models that assume uniform (temporally independent\nreactivation), we show that latency reversal follows structured oscillatory\npatterns modulated by immune cycles, circadian rhythms, and transient\ninflammatory episodes. This finding suggests that viral rebound risk is\ndynamically shaped by immune fluctuations, contrary to the assumption of a\nconstant reactivation probability. We also study the model system by\nincorporating Gamma-distributed waiting times to account for heterogeneity in\nreactivation kinetics, which in turn provides a more flexible characterization\nof reservoir dynamics. We believe that these insights have critical\nimplications for HIV cure strategies.",

    "abstract": "The acquisition of annotated datasets with paired images and segmentation\nmasks is a critical challenge in domains such as medical imaging, remote\nsensing, and computer vision. Manual annotation demands significant resources,\nfaces ethical constraints, and depends heavily on domain expertise. Existing\ngenerative models often target single-modality outputs, either images or\nsegmentation masks, failing to address the need for high-quality, simultaneous\nimage-mask generation. Additionally, these models frequently lack adaptable\nconditioning mechanisms, restricting control over the generated outputs and\nlimiting their applicability for dataset augmentation and rare scenario\nsimulation. We propose CoSimGen, a diffusion-based framework for controllable\nsimultaneous image and mask generation. Conditioning is intuitively achieved\nthrough (1) text prompts grounded in class semantics, (2) spatial embedding of\ncontext prompts to provide spatial coherence, and (3) spectral embedding of\ntimestep information to model noise levels during diffusion. To enhance\ncontrollability and training efficiency, the framework incorporates contrastive\ntriplet loss between text and class embeddings, alongside diffusion and\nadversarial losses. Initial low-resolution outputs 128 x 128 are super-resolved\nto 512 x 512, producing high-fidelity images and masks with strict adherence to\nconditions. We evaluate CoSimGen on metrics such as FID, KID, LPIPS, Class FID,\nPositive predicted value for image fidelity and semantic alignment of generated\nsamples over 4 diverse datasets. CoSimGen achieves state-of-the-art performance\nacross all datasets, achieving the lowest KID of 0.11 and LPIPS of 0.53 across\ndatasets.",

    "abstract": "This paper develops a homogenized harmonic balance finite element method\n(HomHBFEM) to predict the dynamic behavior of magnets with fast excitation\ncycles, including eddy current and skin effects. A homogenization technique for\nlaminated yokes avoids resolving the individual laminates and the skin depth in\nthe finite element (FE) mesh. Instead, the yoke is represented by a bulk\nsurrogate material with frequency-dependent parameters. The ferromagnetic\nsaturation of the yoke at higher excitation currents is tackled by a harmonic\nbalance method, which accounts for a coupled set of frequency components.\nThereby, a computationally expensive time-stepping of the eddy-current field\nproblem and a convolution of the homogenized yoke model are avoided. The\nHomHBFEM enables, for the first time, to conduct nonlinear simulations of fast\ncorrector magnets, which are embedded in a fast orbit feedback system to\ncounteract orbit disturbances over a broad frequency spectrum, and thus\nguarantee a stable light-source operation. The results show the impact of the\nnonlinearity on the phase lag and the field attenuation as well as the eddy\ncurrent losses at frequencies up to 65 kHz. The numerical validation for a\nC-dipole magnet example shows that the HomHBFEM achieves a sufficient accuracy\nat an affordable computational effort, with simulation times of a few hours. In\ncomparison, standard 3D transient FE simulations need to resolve the lamination\nthickness and the skin depth in space and the largest relevant frequency in\ntime, which leads to a two to three orders of magnitude larger mesh and\nprohibitive computational effort, with simulation times of a few weeks on a\ncontemporary computer server.",

To address these limitations, RGB-Th-Bench provides a comprehensive\nevaluation framework covering 14 distinct skill dimensions, with a total of\n1,600+ expert-annotated Yes/No questions.

We\nconduct extensive evaluations on 19 state-of-the-art VLMs, revealing\nsignificant performance gaps in RGB-Thermal understanding.

However, this\nassumption is often violated in real-world scenarios where the mean evolves\nover time due to external influences, trends, or regime shifts. When the mean\nis not properly accounted for, applying GL directly can lead to estimating a\nbiased precision matrix, hence hindering the graph learning task. To overcome\nthis limitation, we propose Graphical Lasso with Adaptive Targeted Adaptive\nImportance Sampling (GL-ATAIS), an iterative method that jointly estimates the\ntime-varying mean and the precision matrix. Our approach integrates Bayesian\ninference with frequentist estimation, leveraging importance sampling to obtain\nan estimate of the mean while using a regularized maximum likelihood estimator\nto infer the precision matrix. By iteratively refining both estimates, GL-ATAIS\nmitigates the bias introduced by time-varying means, leading to more accurate\ngraph recovery.

In this work, we investigate this\neffect in a two-black-hole Majumdar-Papapetrou spacetime modified by\nfour-derivative EFT correction terms. Our analysis shows that while the scaling\nexponents, which measure the strength of the tidal forces near the horizon,\nremain unchanged under EFT corrections in $D=4$, they decrease for higher\ndimensions, enhancing the near-horizon tidal forces. We find an expression for\nthe EFT corrections to the scaling exponents till $D \\le 10$ and demonstrate\nthat the metric corrections can be structured such that only the near-horizon\n$AdS_2$ throat undergoes angle-dependent modifications, while the transverse\n$S^{D-2}$ sector remains unaffected.",

We\nexamine four key dimensions of emotion representation: text length, sentiment\npolarity, emotion co-occurrence, and intensity variations. Our findings reveal\ndiverse language-specific patterns in emotional expression -- with Somali texts\ntypically longer, while others like IsiZulu and Algerian Arabic show more\nconcise emotional expression. We observe a higher prevalence of negative\nsentiment in several Nigerian languages compared to lower negativity in\nlanguages like IsiXhosa. Further, emotion co-occurrence analysis demonstrates\nstrong cross-linguistic associations between specific emotion pairs\n(anger-disgust, sadness-fear), suggesting universal psychological connections.\nIntensity distributions show multimodal patterns with significant variations\nbetween language families; Bantu languages display similar yet distinct\nprofiles, while Afroasiatic languages and Nigerian Pidgin demonstrate wider\nintensity ranges.

Using this technique, we obtain the first\noptimal sketching lower bounds for discrete inputs in a data stream, for\nclassical problems such as approximating the frequency moments, estimating the\noperator norm, and compressed sensing. Additionally, we lift the adaptive\nattack of Hardt and Woodruff (STOC, 2013) for breaking any real-valued linear\nsketch via a sequence of real-valued queries, and show how to obtain an attack\non any integer-valued linear sketch using integer-valued queries. This shows\nthat there is no linear sketch in a data stream with insertions and deletions\nthat is adversarially robust for approximating any $L_p$ norm of the input,\nresolving a central open question for adversarially robust streaming\nalgorithms. To do so, we introduce a new pre-processing technique of\nindependent interest which, given an integer-valued linear sketch, increases\nthe dimension of the sketch by only a constant factor in order to make the\northogonal lattice to its row span smooth. This pre-processing then enables us\nto leverage results in lattice theory on discrete Gaussian distributions and\nreason that efficient discrete sketches imply efficient continuous sketches.\nOur work resolves open questions from the Banff '14 and '17 workshops on\nCommunication Complexity and Applications, as well as the STOC '21 and FOCS '23\nworkshops on adaptivity and robustness.",

In particular, the developing region has been described using an\nanalytical approach in combination with using a numerical recursive program.\nBoth approaches assume that the only forces acting on the flow are internal\nshear forces in a Newtonian constant density fluid. The analytical and\nnumerical predictions both display excellent agreement with carefully conducted\nmeasurements. The jet spreading angle is observed to be directly coupled to the\nturbulent momentum diffusion, hence the spreading rate depends on the upstream,\nor initial, conditions. The jet entrainment and momentum rate are both observed\nto be constant, even across the developing jet. Since the solution of the jet\ndevelopment depends on the initial conditions, the total (molecular and\nturbulent) viscosity and the initial velocity profile must be input into the\nanalytical or numerical solver to obtain the correct solution. The Reynolds\nnumber is observed to not enter into the analytical or numerical solution and\nexperiments confirm that the jet spreading is independent of the Reynolds\nnumber in the tested range, $Re = 3\\,200 - 32\\,000$.

    "abstract": "Dynamic control of topological properties in materials is central to modern\ncondensed matter physics, and Floquet engineering, utilizing periodic light\nfields, provides a promising avenue. Here, we use Floquet theory to\ntheoretically study the topological response of a Z2 nodal line semimetal\n(NLSM) when driven by circularly polarized light (CPL). We demonstrate that the\ndirection of CPL irradiation critically dictates the resulting topological\nphase transitions. Specifically, when light is incident perpendicular to the\nnodal line plane, increasing the light amplitude induces two successive\ntopological phase transitions: first, from the Z2 NLSM to a vortex NLSM, a rare\nand intriguing topological state; and second, a transition from the vortex NLSM\nto a semimetal with a pair of Weyl points (WPs). In stark contrast, irradiation\nalong other directions directly transforms the Z2 nodal line into a pair of\nWPs. We further investigate the transport properties of the Floquet Z2 NLSM,\nfocusing on the anomalous and planar Hall effects. The anomalous Hall effect\nexhibits a direction-dependent amplitude variation, deviating from conventional\ntwo-band NLSM behavior. Importantly, we reveal a significant and tunable planar\nHall effect, a phenomenon largely unexplored in Floquet topological materials,\nwhich is highly sensitive to both light amplitude and direction. Our findings\nnot only present a novel route to realize the vortex NLSM, but also establish\nan efficient way to control Hall transport phenomena in Z2 NLSMs.",

MusiCoT empowers the AR\nmodel to first outline an overall music structure before generating audio\ntokens, thereby enhancing the coherence and creativity of the resulting\ncompositions.

This innovative\napproach effectively addresses copying issues, positioning MusiCoT as a vital\npractical method for music prompting.

Proving that these compilation chains are secure is, however,\nchallenging, and involves a non-trivial back-translation step: for any attack a\ntarget context mounts against the compiled program one has to exhibit a source\ncontext mounting the same attack against the source program. We describe a\nnovel back-translation technique, which results in simpler proofs that can be\nmore easily mechanized in a proof assistant. Given a finite set of finite trace\nprefixes, capturing the interaction recorded during an attack between a target\ncontext and the compiled program, we build a call-return tree that we\nback-translate into a source context producing the same trace prefixes. We use\nstate in the generated source context to record the current location in the\ncall-return tree. The back-translation is done in several small steps, each\nadding to the tree new information describing how the location should change\ndepending on how the context regains control. To prove this back-translation\ncorrect we give semantics to every intermediate call-return tree language,\nusing ghost state to store information and explicitly enforce execution\ninvariants. We prove several small forward simulations, basically seeing the\nback-translation as a verified nanopass compiler. Thanks to this modular\nstructure, we are able to mechanize this complex back-translation and its\ncorrectness proof in the Rocq prover without too much effort.",

Further analysis demonstrates that CoT prompting\neffectively controls the distribution of the numbers of thinking tokens and\nreasoning steps, reducing excessive reflections by approximately 90% in some\ncases.

    "abstract": "Data center networks (DCNs) require a low-cost, low-power optical transceiver\nto handle increased traffic from generative artificial intelligence, video\nstreaming services, and more. Improving the required signal-to-noise ratio\n(RSNR) by digital signal processing such as forward error correction (FEC)\nmitigates the requirements for electrical and optical components. The optical\ntransceivers in DCNs exploit a low-complexity soft-decision (SD) FEC,\nconsisting of short block-length linear error-correcting codes and a\nlow-complexity SD decoder (SDD), such as Chase decoding and ordered statistics\ndecoding. The low-complexity SDD efficiently approaches a maximum likelihood\ndecoding (MLD). However, the decoding performance of MLD is limited by its\nfinite block length. In this paper, we describe the details of our proposed\nchannel-polarized multilevel coding with iterative decoding (CP-MLC-ID). The\nproposed CP-MLC-ID improves the decoding performance by extending the codeword\nlength to weakly and indirectly connect codewords via bypassed bits. The\n19.5%-OH CP-MLC-ID using 128-bit extended Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem (eBCH) and\nKP4 codes outperforms the concatenated eBCH and KP4 codes with a net coding\ngain of 0.25 and 0.40 dB for the same and double the number of SDDs,\nrespectively. We also investigate the dependency of the decoding performance on\nthe size of a bit interleaver. The performance degradation of CP-MLC-ID using\nan 8-bit interleaver is about 0.1 dB compared to using the large-bit\ninterleaver. Our results indicate that even a weak connection by exclusive-OR\nbetween codewords improves the decoding performance, compared to simple\nconcatenated codes in the DCNs.",

Large language models (LLMs) are promising candidates\nfor addressing this challenge, however our experience shows that they are\nineffective in this task, often failing to detect even straightforward bugs. To\naddress this gap, we introduce HoarePrompt, a novel approach that adapts\nfundamental ideas from program verification to natural language artifacts.\nInspired from the strongest postcondition calculus, HoarePrompt employs a\nsystematic, step-by-step process in which an LLM generates natural language\ndescriptions of reachable program states at various code points. To manage\nloops, we propose few-shot-driven k-induction, an adaptation of the k-induction\nmethod widely used in model checking. Once program states are described,\nHoarePrompt leverages the LLM to assess whether the program, annotated with\nthese state descriptions, conforms to the natural language requirements. For\nevaluating the quality of classifiers of program correctness with respect to\nnatural language requirements, we constructed CoCoClaNeL, a challenging dataset\nof solutions to programming competition problems. Our experiments show that\nHoarePrompt improves the MCC by 61% compared to directly using Zero-shot-CoT\nprompts for correctness classification. Furthermore, HoarePrompt outperforms a\nclassifier that assesses correctness via LLM-based test generation by an MCC\nincrease of 106%. The inductive reasoning mechanism contributes a 26% boost to\nMCC, underscoring its effectiveness in managing loops.",

From micro-robotics to biology at the subcellular scale, this versatile\ntechnique has found a broad range of applications. Through the interplay\nbetween thermal expansion and thermal viscosity changes, the repeated scanning\nof the laser along a scan path results in fluid flow and hence net transport of\nparticles, without physical channels. Building on previous work focusing on\ntwo-dimensional microfluidic settings, we present an analytical, theoretical\nmodel for the thermoviscous and thermal expansion flows and net transport\ninduced by a translating heat spot in three-dimensional, unconfined fluid. We\nfirst numerically solve for the temperature field due to a translating heat\nsource in the experimentally relevant limit. Then, in our flow model, the\nsmall, localised temperature increase causes local changes in the mass density,\nshear viscosity and bulk viscosity of the fluid. We derive analytically the\ninstantaneous flow generated during one scan and compute the net transport of\npassive tracers due to a full scan, up to quadratic order in the thermal\nexpansion and thermal shear viscosity coefficients. We further show that the\nflow and transport are independent of bulk viscosity. In the far field, while\nthe leading-order instantaneous flow is typically a three-dimensional source or\nsink, the leading-order average velocity of tracers is instead a source dipole,\nwhose strength depends on the relative magnitudes of the thermal expansion and\nthermal shear viscosity coefficients.

In this study, we analyzed measurements of the\ncorotation radius obtained using several methods for three galaxies (NGC 3686,\nNGC 4321, and NGC 2403) that exhibit different morphologies of spiral\nstructures. We also performed independent measurements to estimate the location\nof the resonance, which allowed us to determine whether each galaxy has a clear\ncorotation radius position. This examination, along with other tests such as\nstellar age gradient, interlocking resonances, and the radial distribution of\nmetallicity, enables us to understand the mechanism that may be responsible for\nthe formation of spiral arms in the studied galaxies.",

It is hypothesised that the period variation observed in many RR\nLyrae stars, which are much faster and stronger than may be explained by an\nevolutionary origin, may in fact be caused by this cycle-to-cycle (C2C)\nvariation effect. So far, quantitative studies have not really been performed,\nand space data have not been used at all. Our primary goal was to\nquantitatively analyse the O$-$C diagrams of RR Lyrae stars obtained from space\nphotometry and explained by quasi-periodic or irregular periodic variations to\nsee if they can be explained by random fluctuations in pulsation cycle length\nwithout assuming real period variations. We fitted statistical models to the\nO-C diagrams and tested their validity and fit. The necessary analysis of the\nlight curves was performed using standard Fourier methods. We found that the\nvast majority of the O-C curves can be satisfactorily explained by assuming\ntiming noise and the C2C variation without a real mean period variation. We\nhave shown that the strength of the C2C variation is strongly dependent on the\npulsation period and metallicity. These correlations suggests that turbulent\nconvection may be behind the C2C variation. The additional frequencies of some\nRR Lyrae stars and their variation over time play only a marginal role in O-Cs.\nWe have found new arguments that the phase jump phenomenon in RRc stars is in\nfact a continuous change, moreover, it could also be caused by the C2C\nvariation.",

    "abstract": "Motif counting plays a crucial role in understanding the structural\nproperties of networks. By computing motif frequencies, researchers can draw\nkey insights into the structural properties of the underlying network. As\nnetworks become increasingly complex, different graph models have been\nproposed, giving rise to diverse motif patterns. These variations introduce\nunique computational challenges that require specialized algorithms tailored to\nspecific motifs within different graph structures. This survey provides a\ncomprehensive and structured overview of motif counting techniques across\ngeneral graphs, heterogeneous graphs, and hypergraphs. We categorize existing\nalgorithms according to their underlying computational strategies, emphasizing\nkey similarities and distinctions. In addition to reviewing current\nmethodologies, we examine their strengths, limitations, and computational\ntrade-offs. Furthermore, we explore future directions in motif counting,\nincluding scalable implementations to improve efficiency in large-scale\nnetworks, algorithmic adaptations for dynamic, temporal, and attributed graphs,\nand deeper integration with large language models (LLMs) and graph-based\nretrieval-augmented generation (GraphRAG). By offering a detailed analysis of\nthese approaches, this survey aims to support researchers and practitioners in\nadvancing motif counting for increasingly complex network data.",

Advanced image reconstruction algorithms, such as\ncompressed sensing (CS), have been shown to potentially reduce PVE. Therefore,\nwe investigated the feasibility of CS-based methods for image quality and TSC\nquantification accuracy improvement in patients with breast cancer (BC).\nSubjects and Methods: Three healthy participants and 12 female participants\nwith BC were examined on a 7T MRI scanner in this study. We reconstructed\n23Na-MRI images using the weighted total variation (wTV) and directional total\nvariation (dTV), anatomically guided total variation (AG-TV), and adaptive\ncombine (ADC) reconstruction and performed image quality assessment. We\nevaluated agreement in tumor volumes delineated on sodium data using the Dice\nscore and performed TSC quantification for different image reconstruction\napproaches. Results: All methods provided sodium images of the breast with good\nquality. The mean Dice scores for wTV, dTV, and AG-TV were 65%, 72%, and 75%,\nrespectively. In the breast tumors, average TSC values were 83.0, 72.0, 80.0,\nand 84.0 mmol/L, respectively. There was a significant difference between dTV\nand wTV (p<0.001), as well as between dTV and AG-TV (p<0.001) and dTV and ADC\nalgorithm (p<0.001). Conclusion: The results of this study showed that there\nare differences in tumor appearance and TSC estimations that might be depending\non the type of image reconstruction and parameters used, most likely due to\ndifferences in their robustness in reducing PVE.",

In this paper, we do not propose\nany new safety criteria. Instead, we further investigate the role that the\ncombinatorial component plays in the safety verification problem. First, we\nprove that path-completeness, which is a property on a graph that describes the\nswitching sequences, is necessary to obtain a set of valid safety conditions.\nAs a result, the path-complete framework is able to provide a complete\ncharacterization of safety conditions for switched systems. Furthermore, we\nprovide a systematic methodology for comparing two path-complete graphs and the\nconservatism associated with the resulting safety conditions. Specifically, we\nprove that under some conditions, such as when there exists a simulation\nrelation between two path-complete graphs, it is possible to conclude that one\ngraph is always able to provide less conservative safety conditions than\nanother, independent of the algebraic properties of the switched system and the\ntemplate of the barrier function under consideration. Such a result paves the\nway for a systematic use of the path-complete framework with barrier functions,\nas one can then consistently choose the appropriate graph that provides less\nconservative safety conditions.",

    "abstract": "We investigate a method for controlling light scattering based on the\nexcitation of non-radiating states in a half-space through a tailored choice of\nincident radiation. For a fixed particle geometry, we demonstrate that small\nvariations in the refractive index can lead to a significant redistribution of\nscattered light between two half spaces while keeping the incident illumination\nunchanged. This effect is particularly relevant for dynamic beam shaping and\noptical signal routing at the microscale. Our study focuses on spherical\nsemiconductor particles of varying radii illuminated in the visible range, with\nrefractive index modulation achieved via charge carrier injection. Using AlGaAs\nand InP as model materials, we analyze the feasibility of achieving efficient\ndirectional control of scattering. These results provide insight into\nall-optical manipulation of light using tunable semiconductor structures.",

    "abstract": "With large-scale surveys such as the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), it has\nbecome possible to obtain a well-sampled light curve spanning the full length\nof the survey for any discovery within the survey footprint. Similarly, any\ntransient within the footprint that was first detected before the start of the\nsurvey will likely have a large number of post-transient observations, making\nthem excellent targets to search for the presence of late-time signals, in\nparticular due to interaction with circumstellar material (CSM). We search for\nlate-time signals in a sample of 7718 transients, mainly supernovae (SNe),\nwhich were first detected during the 10 years before the start of ZTF, aiming\nto find objects showing signs of late-time interaction with CSM. We find one\ncandidate whose late-time signal is best explained by late-time CSM\ninteraction, with the signal being around 300 days after transient discovery. A\nthin, distant shell containing $\\lesssim5$ M$_\\odot$ of material could explain\nthe recovered signal. We also find five objects whose late-time signal is best\nexplained by faint nuclear transients occurring in host nuclei close to the\npre-ZTF transient locations. Finally, we find two objects where it is difficult\nto determine whether the signal is from a nuclear transient or due to late-time\nCSM interaction $>5$ years after the SN. This study demonstrates the ability of\nlarge-scale surveys to find faint transient signals for a variety of objects,\nuncovering a population of previously unknown sources. However, the large\nnumber of non-detections show that strong late-time CSM interaction occurring\nyears after the SN explosion is extremely rare.",

    "abstract": "Text-to-motion generative models span a wide range of 3D human actions but\nstruggle with nuanced stylistic attributes such as a \"Chicken\" style. Due to\nthe scarcity of style-specific data, existing approaches pull the generative\nprior towards a reference style, which often results in out-of-distribution low\nquality generations. In this work, we introduce LoRA-MDM, a lightweight\nframework for motion stylization that generalizes to complex actions while\nmaintaining editability. Our key insight is that adapting the generative prior\nto include the style, while preserving its overall distribution, is more\neffective than modifying each individual motion during generation. Building on\nthis idea, LoRA-MDM learns to adapt the prior to include the reference style\nusing only a few samples. The style can then be used in the context of\ndifferent textual prompts for generation. The low-rank adaptation shifts the\nmotion manifold in a semantically meaningful way, enabling realistic style\ninfusion even for actions not present in the reference samples. Moreover,\npreserving the distribution structure enables advanced operations such as style\nblending and motion editing. We compare LoRA-MDM to state-of-the-art stylized\nmotion generation methods and demonstrate a favorable balance between text\nfidelity and style consistency.",

To address this, we propose a new method for the CBO\nframework that operates without prior knowledge of the causal graph. Consistent\nwith causal bandit theory, we demonstrate through theoretical analysis and that\nfocusing on the direct causal parents of the target variable is sufficient for\noptimization, and provide empirical validation in the context of CBO.\nFurthermore we introduce a new method that learns a Bayesian posterior over the\ndirect parents of the target variable.

In the nonlinear case where the posterior is not tractable, we present a\nGaussian Process (GP) approximation that still enables CBO by inferring the\nparents of the outcome variable.

In the second\nstage, users' active precoders are designed under different criteria such as\nminimizing the IL (min-IL), maximizing the signal-to-interference-plus-noise\nratio (max-SINR), or maximizing the sum rate (max-SR). The residual\ninterference not cancelled by the BD-RIS is treated as noise by the precoders.\nOur simulation results show that the max-SR precoders provide more than 20% sum\nrate improvement compared to other designs, especially when the BD-RIS has a\nmoderate number of elements ($M<20$) and users transmit with high power, in\nwhich case the residual interference is still significant.",

    "abstract": "A common use case for OCR applications involves users uploading documents and\nprogressively correcting automatic recognition to obtain the final transcript.\nThis correction phase presents an opportunity for progressive adaptation of the\nOCR model, making it crucial to adapt early, while ensuring stability and\nreliability. We demonstrate that state-of-the-art transformer-based models can\neffectively support this adaptation, gradually reducing the annotator's\nworkload. Our results show that fine-tuning can reliably start with just 16\nlines, yielding a 10% relative improvement in CER, and scale up to 40% with 256\nlines. We further investigate the impact of model components, clarifying the\nroles of the encoder and decoder in the fine-tuning process. To guide\nadaptation, we propose reliable stopping criteria, considering both direct\napproaches and global trend analysis. Additionally, we show that OCR models can\nbe leveraged to cut annotation costs by half through confidence-based selection\nof informative lines, achieving the same performance with fewer annotations.",

    "abstract": "We study $\\mathbb{E}_n$-Koszul duality for pairs of algebras of the form\n$\\mathrm{C}_{\\bullet}(\\Omega^{n}_*X;\\Bbbk) \\leftrightarrow\n\\mathrm{C}^{\\bullet}(X;\\Bbbk)$, and the closely related question of\n$n$-affineness for Betti stacks. It was expected, but not known, that\n$\\mathbb{E}_n$-Koszul duality should induce a kind of Morita equivalence\nbetween categories of iterated modules. We establish this rigorously by proving\nthat the $(\\infty,n)$-category of iterated modules over\n$\\mathrm{C}_{\\bullet}(\\Omega_*^{n+1}X;\\Bbbk)$ is equivalent to the\n$(\\infty,n)$-category of quasi-coherent sheaves of $(\\infty,n-1)$-categories on\n$\\mathrm{cSpec}(\\mathrm{C}^{\\bullet}(X;\\Bbbk))$, where\n$\\mathrm{cSpec}(\\mathrm{C}^{\\bullet}(X;\\Bbbk))$ is the cospectrum of\n$\\mathrm{C}^{\\bullet}(X;\\Bbbk)$. By the monodromy equivalence, these categories\nare also equivalent to the category of higher local systems on $X$,\n$n\\mathbf{LocSysCat}^{n-1}(X;\\Bbbk)$. Our result is new already in the\nclassical case $n=1$, although it can be seen to recover well known\nformulations of $\\mathbb{E}_1$-Koszul duality as a Morita equivalence of module\ncategories (up to appropriate completions of the $t$-structures). We also\ninvestigate (higher) affineness properties of Betti stacks. We give a complete\ncharacterization of $n$-affine Betti stacks, in terms of the $0$-affineness of\ntheir iterated loop space. As a consequence, we prove that $n$-truncated Betti\nstacks are $n$-affine; and that $\\pi_{n+1}(X)$ is an obstruction to\n$n$-affineness.",

We propose\nindicators to detect normalization issues and further explore the trade-offs\nbetween artifact-free and high-quality predictions, using three diverse\nmicroscopy datasets as examples.

By utilizing cross-coupled micro-ring\nresonators and differential photodiode structures, along with optical\nwaveguides instead of traditional wordlines and bitlines, our pSRAM exhibits\nhigh-speed, and energy-efficient performance. The pSRAM bitcell demonstrates a\nread/write speed of 40 GHz, with a switching (static) energy consumption of\napproximately 0.6 pJ (0.03 pJ) per bit and a footprint of 330x290 um^2 using\nthe GlobalFoundries 45SPCLO process node. These bitcells can be arranged into a\n2D memory array, enabling large-scale, on-chip photonic memory subsystems ideal\nfor high-speed memory, data processing and computing applications.",

Visual Odometry (VO) generalizes well in unseen environments but\nsuffers from accumulated error in open trajectories. To address this dilemma,\nwe introduce a new task, Scene-agnostic Pose Regression (SPR), which can\nachieve accurate pose regression in a flexible way while eliminating the need\nfor retraining or databases. To benchmark SPR, we created a large-scale\ndataset, 360SPR, with over 200K photorealistic panoramas, 3.6M pinhole images\nand camera poses in 270 scenes at three different sensor heights. Furthermore,\na SPR-Mamba model is initially proposed to address SPR in a dual-branch manner.\nExtensive experiments and studies demonstrate the effectiveness of our SPR\nparadigm, dataset, and model. In the unknown scenes of both 360SPR and 360Loc\ndatasets, our method consistently outperforms APR, RPR and VO.

    "abstract": "We establish a relationship between the equations that constitute the\nso-called good-bad-ugly model, whose nonlinearities are known to mimic those\npresent in the Einstein field equations in generalized harmonic gauge. This\nrelationship between ugly fields and good and bad ones stems from the fact that\none can write the equation for the rescaled derivative of an ugly along an\nincoming null direction as a good or a bad equation depending on whether there\nare source terms or not. This provides a new interpretation of the logarithms\nof the radial coordinate that show up in expansions of solutions to ugly\nequations near null infinity. This furthermore allows us to use the\nKlainerman-Sobolev inequality for the standard wave equation on Cauchy slices\nto show uniform boundedness for the ugly equation. In the second part of this\npaper we perform a first order reduction of the ugly equation with given\nsources in flat space and we radially compactify the coordinates in order to\nshow an energy estimate for that equation on hyperboloidal slices. This result\nis an important first step towards establishing energy estimates for the\nhyperboloidal initial value problem of the first order compactified Einstein\nfield equations in generalized harmonic gauge.",

These advancements concurrently\nunderscore the need for rigorous safety evaluations due to the manifestation of\nsocial biases, which can lead to harmful societal impacts. Despite these\nconcerns, existing benchmarks may overlook the intrinsic weaknesses of LLMs,\nwhich can generate biased responses even with simple adversarial instructions.\nTo address this critical gap, we introduce a new benchmark, Fairness Benchmark\nin LLM under Extreme Scenarios (FLEX), designed to test whether LLMs can\nsustain fairness even when exposed to prompts constructed to induce bias. To\nthoroughly evaluate the robustness of LLMs, we integrate prompts that amplify\npotential biases into the fairness assessment. Comparative experiments between\nFLEX and existing benchmarks demonstrate that traditional evaluations may\nunderestimate the inherent risks in models. This highlights the need for more\nstringent LLM evaluation benchmarks to guarantee safety and fairness.",

    "abstract": "In the absence of a unique, gauge-independent definition of eccentricity in\nGeneral Relativity, there have been efforts to standardize the definition for\nGravitational-Wave astronomy. Recently, Shaikh et al. proposed a\nmodel-independent measurement of eccentricity $e_{\\mathrm{gw}}$ from the phase\nevolution of the dominant mode. Many works use loss functions (LFs) to assign\neccentricity to a reference waveform, for instance by fitting a Post-Newtonian\nexpression to assign eccentricity to Numerical Relativity (NR) simulations.\nTherefore, we ask whether minimizing common LFs on gauge-dependent model\nparameters, such as the mismatch $\\mathcal{M}$ or the $L_2$-norm of the\ndominant mode $h_{22}$ residuals, for non-precessing binaries, ensures a\nsufficient $e_{\\mathrm{gw}}$ agreement. We use $10$ eccentric NR simulations\nand the eccentric waveform TEOBResumS-Dali as the parametric model to fit on\neccentricity $e_0$ and reference frequency $f_0$. We first show that a\nminimized mismatch, the $\\mathcal{M} \\sim 10^{-3}- 10^{-2}$ results in better\n$e_{\\mathrm{gw}}$ fractional differences ($\\sim 1\\%$) than with the minimized\n$h_{22}$ residuals. Nonetheless, for small eccentricity NR simulations\n$(e_{\\mathrm{gw}} \\lesssim 10^{-2}$), the mismatch can favor quasi-circular\n($e_0=0$) best-fit models. Thus, with sufficiently long NR simulations, we can\ninclude $e_{\\mathrm{gw}}$ in the LF. We explain why solely fitting with\n$e_{\\mathrm{gw}}$ constitutes a degenerate problem. To circumvent these\nlimitations, we propose to minimize a convex sum of $\\mathcal{M}$ and the\n$e_{\\mathrm{gw}}$ difference to both assign non-zero eccentric values to NR\nstrains and to control the mismatch threshold.",

    "abstract": "Phone automation agents aim to autonomously perform a given natural-language\nuser request, such as scheduling appointments or booking a hotel. While much\nresearch effort has been devoted to screen understanding and action planning,\ncomplex tasks often necessitate user interaction for successful completion.\nAligning the agent with the user's expectations is crucial for building trust\nand enabling personalized experiences. This requires the agent to proactively\nengage the user when necessary, avoiding actions that violate their preferences\nwhile refraining from unnecessary questions where a default action is expected.\nWe argue that such subtle agent-initiated interaction with the user deserves\nfocused research attention.\n  To promote such research, this paper introduces a task formulation for\ndetecting the need for user interaction and generating appropriate messages. We\nthoroughly define the task, including aspects like interaction timing and the\nscope of the agent's autonomy. Using this definition, we derived annotation\nguidelines and created AndroidInteraction, a diverse dataset for the task,\nleveraging an existing UI automation dataset. We tested several text-based and\nmultimodal baseline models for the task, finding that it is very challenging\nfor current LLMs. We suggest that our task formulation, dataset, baseline\nmodels and analysis will be valuable for future UI automation research,\nspecifically in addressing this crucial yet often overlooked aspect of\nagent-initiated interaction. This work provides a needed foundation to allow\npersonalized agents to properly engage the user when needed, within the context\nof phone UI automation.",

We derive age and metallicity\ndistributions of the kinematic thick and thin discs using the CMDft.Gaia\npipeline and Gaia DR3 data within 250 pc of the Sun, covering 1 kpc in height.\nOur results show that the kinematic thick disc is mostly older than 10 Gyr,\nundergoing three main metallicity enrichment episodes: (1) over 12 Gyr ago,\npeaking at [M/H] $\\sim$ -0.5 dex, (2) $\\sim$11 Gyr ago, rapidly increasing to\nsolar [M/H] and spanning [$\\alpha$/Fe] from 0.3 to solar, and (3) just over 10\nGyr ago, reaching supersolar metallicities. Meanwhile, the kinematic thin disc\nbegan forming $\\sim$10 Gyr ago, just as thick disc star formation ended,\ncharacterized by supersolar metallicities and low [$\\alpha$/Fe]. This\ntransition coincides with the Milky Way's last major merger: Gaia-Sausage\nEnceladus (GSE). We also identify a subset of kinematic thin disc stars older\nthan 10 Gyr with high/intermediate [$\\alpha$/Fe], indicating a transition\nphase. The age-metallicity relation of the thin disc suggests overlapping star\nformation episodes and radial mixing in the solar neighborhood, with the\ngreatest spread $\\sim$6 Gyr ago. Additionally, we detect an isolated thick disc\nstar formation event at solar metallicity, coinciding with Sagittarius' first\npericenter passage. These findings provide precise age-metallicity\ndistributions and star formation rates, offering key insights for chemical\nevolution models and cosmological simulations.",

    "abstract": "Union Pacific (UP) is one of the largest transportation companies in the\nworld, with over 50.000 kms of rail network covering 23 states in the United\nStates. In 2017 Union Pacific embarked on a project that within 5 years would\nlead it to become the only rail operator in the world equipped with a\ntechnology capable of fully automating the real-time management and\noptimization of train traffic. In 2021 the main milestone of such project has\nbeen reached with the first deployment of the automated dispatching system we\npresent here. To attack such large and complex problem, we decomposed it into\ndistinct but interrelated functional components, and developed optimization\nmodels and methods to handle such components. The models communicate with each\nother through variables and constraints, and by a careful timing of\ninvocations. In this paper we give an overview of the overall approach.",

Identifying these\ncryptographic elements in existing code is only the first step. It is crucial\nnot only to identify quantum vulnerable algorithms but also to detect\nvulnerabilities and incorrect crypto usages, to prioritize, report, monitor as\nwell as remediate and modernize code bases. A U.S. government memorandum\nrequire agencies to begin their transition to PQC (Post Quantum Cryptograpy) by\nconducting a prioritized inventory of cryptographic systems including software\nand hardware systems. In this paper we describe our code scanning tool -\nCryptoscope - which leverages cryptographic domain knowledge as well as\ncompiler techniques to statically parse and analyze source code. By analyzing\ncontrol and data flow the tool is able to build an extendable and querriable\ninventory of cryptography. Cryptoscope goes beyond identifying disconnected\ncryptographic APIs and instead provides the user with an inventory of\ncryptographic assets - containing comprehensive views of the cryptographic\noperations implemented. We show that for more than 92% of our test cases, these\nviews include the cryptographic operation itself, APIs, as well as the related\nmaterial such as keys, nonces, random sources etc. Lastly, building on top of\nthis inventory, our tool is able to detect and report all the cryptographic\nrelated weaknesses and vulnerabilities (11 out of 15) in CamBench - achieving\nstate-of-the-art performance.",

This paper aims to assess the\nreliability of the HCN/HCO+ ratio, from J = 1-0 to J = 4-3 transitions, as a\ndiagnostic tool for differentiating AGN and SB activity across a diverse sample\nof nearby galaxies. We focus on evaluating the effect of spatial resolution on\nthe robustness of these ratios and investigate the underlying physical\nconditions that drive observed variations. We compile observations of HCN and\nHCO+ lines across multiple J transitions from various sources, covering\ndifferent galaxy types, including Seyferts, starbursts, and (ultra-)luminous\ninfrared galaxies (U/LIRGs). The observations span spatial scales from\ncloud-sized regions to kiloparsec scales. We analyse the behaviour of these\nratios at varying resolutions and employ non-LTE radiative transfer models to\ninfer the physical conditions that drive the observed ratios. We find that the\nHCN/HCO+ ratio from higher J transitions can differentiate between AGN and SB\nactivity when observed at high spatial resolution. This distinction occurs\naround unity. However, at lower resolutions, contamination from multiple\nemission sources and beam averaging effects destroy these distinctions.\nModelling suggests that elevated HCN/HCO+ ratios in AGN-dominated regions are\nlargely driven by an enhancement in HCN abundance relative to HCO+, likely due\nto high-temperature chemistry or increased excitation. Our study confirms that\nthe HCN/HCO+ ratio, particularly of higher J transitions, can be a reliable\ntracer of AGN versus SB activity if observations are conducted at sufficiently\nhigh spatial resolution.",

Our model introduces two key\ndifferences: (1) Earth forms from a dense ring of planetesimals and planetary\nembryos near 1 AU, extending into the asteroid belt, and (2) we divide this\npopulation into four zones. The innermost zone contains planetesimals enriched\nin refractory elements relative to Si and depleted in volatiles. The remaining\nzones represent enstatite, ordinary, and CI chondrites. We fit the Earth's bulk\nsilicate composition by adjusting the boundaries of these zones and the\nrefractory enrichment in the inner zone, giving us four compositional free\nparameters. A fifth parameter relates to the depth of planetesimal\nequilibration after a giant impact. We examined twenty-two ring model\nsimulations, expanded to forty-eight based on hot or cold targets during\ncollisions. Seventeen simulations resulted in a mantle chemistry resembling the\nbulk silicate Earth (BSE), despite differences in growth sequences. These\nvariations lead to different fitting parameter values, altering the proportions\nof different meteorite types required to match the BSE. However, findings show\nEarth must accrete 60-80% of material from the innermost refractory-enriched\nzone. This indicates that, with the right growth sequence, multiple ring model\nstructures can yield an Earth-anaologue composition consistent with the BSE.",

Under the control laws, kinematically constrained nonholonomic robots\nare guaranteed to track the reference CVF and converge to the target positive\nlimit set with bounded trajectory curvature.

In this paper, we investigate some notions\nof mixed-order regularity by using advanced tools of first-order and\nsecond-order variational analysis and generalized differentiation of both\nprimal and dual types. Efficient characterizations of such mixed-order\nregularity concepts are established by employing a fresh notion of the least\nsingular value function. The obtained conditions are applied to deriving\nconstructive criteria for mixed-order regularity in coupled constraint and\nvariational systems.",

Study Focus: In\nJuly 2017, the cities of Goslar and G\\\"ottingen experienced severe flood events\ncharacterized by short warning time of only 20 minutes, resulting in extensive\nregional flooding and significant damage. This highlights the critical need for\na more reliable and timely flood forecasting system. This paper presents a\ncomprehensive study on the impact of radar-based precipitation data on\nforecasting river water levels in Goslar. Additionally, the study examines how\nprecipitation influences water level forecasts in G\\\"ottingen. The analysis\nintegrates radar-derived spatiotemporal precipitation patterns with\nhydrological sensor data obtained from ground stations to evaluate the\neffectiveness of this approach in improving flood prediction capabilities. New\nHydrological Insights for the Region: A key innovation in this paper is the use\nof residual-based modeling to address the non-linearity between precipitation\nimages and water levels, leading to a Spatiotemporal Radar-based Precipitation\nModel with residuals (STRPMr). Unlike traditional hydrological models, our\napproach does not rely on upstream data, making it independent of additional\nhydrological inputs. This independence enhances its adaptability and allows for\nbroader applicability in other regions with RADOLAN precipitation. The deep\nlearning architecture integrates (2+1)D convolutional neural networks for\nspatial and temporal feature extraction with LSTM for timeseries forecasting.\nThe results demonstrate the potential of the STRPMr for capturing extreme\nevents and more accurate flood forecasting.",

However, a unified\napproach to align these models across diverse tasks such as image captioning\nand visual question answering remains a challenge. Existing methods either\nrequire very big language models or very big datasets which is not efficient in\nutilizing existing models. This paper addresses this gap and devises a training\nstrategy of auto-regressive vision-language models, to unify vision-language\ntasks like image-captioning and visual question answering. We propose four\ntraining stages for aligning the vision model with the language model, in other\nwords, the language model is given an ability to process visual inputs. We also\ndevise different attention masks for training transformer-based language models\nthat improve the quality of visual features. Further, we introduce some\nfindings, 1) the attention mask should not be applied on visual inputs, 2) the\nLanguage model converges faster on AI- generated data, 3) More work should be\ndone in the alignment stage during the pre-training of the model, 4) the model\ncan easily adapt to any downstream tasks like visual question answering on\nhealthcare datasets like PathVQA. After training the model for one epoch for\nall the stages, it outperforms large models like VILA-13 billion models on\ncommon benchmarks like CIDEr scores on COCO and Flickr30k datasets and achieves\nvery close scores to GIT-2 on the same dataset despite being a much smaller\nmodel trained on a much smaller dataset.

The estimation depends on the underlying model of the\nturbulence. Beside the propagation time of the turbulence, its decay with the\nfading time must be considered. For the description of the propagation, the\nelliptical approach is applied, which takes into account the propagation and\nfading time of the turbulence. The model has been applied successfully in\nexperimental fluid dynamics and is confirmed by direct numerical simulations,\nalso.\n  In this paper, the elliptical approach is applied in the analysis of density\nfluctuations, measured by poloidal correlation reflectometry at two different\nfusion devices, TEXTOR and W7-X. For the latter, it is demonstrated that the\nelliptical approach is necessary for a correct description of the turbulence\npropagation. In addition, the velocity modulations are investigated, which in\nprinciple can be either generated by an oscillation of the propagation time of\ndensity fluctuations and/or an oscillation of the fading of the turbulence. An\nexample for low frequency velocity oscillations in W7-X will be given in the\npaper, showing a relation between turbulence properties and small oscillations\non the measured diamagnetic plasma energy.",

    "abstract": "SLAM plays a crucial role in automation tasks, such as warehouse logistics,\nhealthcare robotics, and restaurant delivery. These scenes come with various\nchallenges, including navigating around crowds of people, dealing with flying\nplastic bags that can temporarily blind sensors, and addressing reduced LiDAR\ndensity caused by cooking smoke. Such scenarios can result in over-degeneracy,\ncausing the map to drift. To address this issue, this paper presents a\nmulti-map LiDAR-inertial system (MM-LINS) for the first time. The front-end\nemploys an iterated error state Kalman filter for state estimation and\nintroduces a reliable evaluation strategy for degeneracy detection. If\nover-degeneracy is detected, the active map will be stored into sleeping maps.\nSubsequently, the system continuously attempts to construct new maps using a\ndynamic initialization method to ensure successful initialization upon leaving\nthe over-degeneracy. Regarding the back-end, the Scan Context descriptor is\nutilized to detect inter-map similarity. Upon successful recognition of a\nsleeping map that shares a common region with the active map, the overlapping\ntrajectory region is utilized to constrain the positional transformation near\nthe edge of the prior map. In response to this, a constraint-enhanced map\nfusion strategy is proposed to achieve high-precision positional and mapping\nresults. Experiments have been conducted separately on both public datasets\nthat exhibited over-degenerate conditions and in real-world environments. These\ntests demonstrated the effectiveness of MM-LINS in over-degeneracy environment.\nOur codes are open-sourced on Github.",

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in diffusion models (DMs) have greatly advanced remote\nsensing image super-resolution (RSISR). However, their iterative sampling\nprocesses often result in slow inference speeds, limiting their application in\nreal-time tasks. To address this challenge, we propose the latent consistency\nmodel for super-resolution (LCMSR), a novel single-step diffusion approach\ndesigned to enhance both efficiency and visual quality in RSISR tasks. Our\nproposal is structured into two distinct stages. In the first stage, we\npretrain a residual autoencoder to encode the differential information between\nhigh-resolution (HR) and low-resolution (LR) images, transitioning the\ndiffusion process into a latent space to reduce computational costs. The second\nstage focuses on consistency diffusion learning, which aims to learn the\ndistribution of residual encodings in the latent space, conditioned on LR\nimages. The consistency constraint enforces that predictions at any two\ntimesteps along the reverse diffusion trajectory remain consistent, enabling\ndirect mapping from noise to data. As a result, the proposed LCMSR reduces the\niterative steps of traditional diffusion models from 50-1000 or more to just a\nsingle step, significantly improving efficiency. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that LCMSR effectively balances efficiency and performance,\nachieving inference times comparable to non-diffusion models while maintaining\nhigh-quality output.",

To better elucidate the\nlink between planet formation and disk substructures, observational biases\nshould be reduced through observations of these small, faint disks at the\nhighest resolution using the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA). In this\nwork, we present new high-resolution (0.03-0.04\") ALMA observations at 1.3 mm\nof 33 disks located in the Lupus star-forming region. Combining archival data\nand previously published work, we provide a near-complete high resolution image\nlibrary of 73 protoplanetary (Class II) disks in Lupus. This enable us to\nmeasure dust disk radii down to a limit of 0.6 au and analyze intensity\nprofiles using visibility modeling. We show that 67% of Lupus protoplanetary\ndisks have dust radii smaller than 30 au, with new substructures detected in\n11, showing some of the shortest separation gaps. The size-luminosity relation\nin Lupus aligns well with a drift-dominated dust evolution scenario and, for\nthe most compact disks (< 30 au), we found dust masses ranging from 0.3 to 26.3\nEarth masses. Assuming that the detected substructures were dynamical effects\nof planets, we estimated the planet masses to range from 20 to 2000 Earth\nmasses with separations between 2 to 74 au. Our results indicate that\ntwo-thirds of the protoplanetary disks in Lupus are smooth, and compact, with\nsubstructures being more prominent in the few larger disks. These compact disks\nare consistent with drift-dominated evolution, with their masses and optical\ndepths suggesting that they may have already experienced some planet formation,\nwith most of the small solids converted into planetesimals and planets. This\nmakes them prime candidates, for explaining the formation and origin of\nsuper-Earths. [Abridged]",

While\nexisting methods have made significant strides, they often struggle to\neffectively differentiate and integrate modality-shared and modality-specific\ninformation, limiting the performance of multimodal learning. To address this\nchallenge, we propose the Hierarchical Adaptive Expert for Multimodal Sentiment\nAnalysis (HAEMSA), a novel framework that synergistically combines evolutionary\noptimization, cross-modal knowledge transfer, and multi-task learning. HAEMSA\nemploys a hierarchical structure of adaptive experts to capture both global and\nlocal modality representations, enabling more nuanced sentiment analysis. Our\napproach leverages evolutionary algorithms to dynamically optimize network\narchitectures and modality combinations, adapting to both partial and full\nmodality scenarios.

On CMU-MOSEI, HAEMSA achieves a\n2.6% increase in 7-class accuracy and a 0.059 decrease in MAE compared to the\nprevious best method. For CMU-MOSI, we observe a 6.3% improvement in 7-class\naccuracy and a 0.058 reduction in MAE. On IEMOCAP, HAEMSA outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art by 2.84% in weighted-F1 score for emotion recognition.

Beginning with classical wear\ntheories, including the Archard and Rabinowicz models, we analyze their\napplicability to both metals and elastomers and discuss extensions relevant to\nelastic contact and multiscale surface roughness. Various experimental studies\non rubber, such as abrasion by sharp tools, erosion by particle impact, and\nwear during sliding on rough substrates, are reviewed and interpreted. The\neffects of environmental factors, such as oxygen and lubrication, are also\ndiscussed. In addition, we review a recently proposed wear model based on\nfatigue crack growth within asperity contact regions, which accounts for energy\ndissipation and multiscale interactions. This model explains the wide\nvariability in the wear coefficient and predicts wear rates consistent with\nexperimental observations across a broad range of conditions. It also explains\nthe formation mechanism and provides the size distribution of rubber wear\nparticles, from micrometer-scale up to severe cut-chip-chunk (CCC) wear. The\nresults have implications for tire wear and the environmental impact of\nmicroscale wear debris (microplastics).",

Existing methods primarily focus on\neither facial synthesis or near-frontal body generation, with limited ability\nto simultaneously control key factors such as viewpoint, pose, clothing, and\nidentity in a disentangled manner. In this paper, we introduce a new\ndisentangled and controllable human synthesis task, which explicitly separates\nand manipulates these four factors within a unified framework. We first develop\nan end-to-end generative model trained on MVHumanNet for factor\ndisentanglement. However, the domain gap between MVHumanNet and in-the-wild\ndata produces unsatisfactory results, motivating the exploration of virtual\ntry-on (VTON) dataset as a potential solution. Through experiments, we observe\nthat simply incorporating the VTON dataset as additional data to train the\nend-to-end model degrades performance, primarily due to the inconsistency in\ndata forms between the two datasets, which disrupts the disentanglement\nprocess. To better leverage both datasets, we propose a stage-by-stage\nframework that decomposes human image generation into three sequential steps:\nclothed A-pose generation, back-view synthesis, and pose and view control. This\nstructured pipeline enables better dataset utilization at different stages,\nsignificantly improving controllability and generalization, especially for\nin-the-wild scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our\nstage-by-stage approach outperforms end-to-end models in both visual fidelity\nand disentanglement quality, offering a scalable solution for real-world tasks.\nAdditional demos are available on the project page:\nhttps://taited.github.io/discohuman-project/.",

While the construction of a\nreduced basis for the microscopic nodal displacements using proper orthogonal\ndecomposition (POD) has become a standard technique, the reduction of the\ncomputational effort for the projected nodal forces, the so-called hyper\nreduction, is an additional challenge, for which different strategies have been\nproposed in the literature.

    "abstract": "The synergy between generative and discriminative models receives growing\nattention. While discriminative Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP)\nexcels in high-level semantics, it struggles with perceiving fine-grained\nvisual details. Generally, to enhance representations, generative models take\nCLIP's visual features as conditions for reconstruction. However, the\nunderlying principle remains underexplored. In this work, we empirically found\nthat visually perfect generations are not always optimal for representation\nenhancement. The essence lies in effectively extracting fine-grained knowledge\nfrom generative models while mitigating irrelevant information. To explore\ncritical factors, we delve into three aspects: (1) Conditioning mechanisms: We\nfound that even a small number of local tokens can drastically reduce the\ndifficulty of reconstruction, leading to collapsed training. We thus conclude\nthat utilizing only global visual tokens as conditions is the most effective\nstrategy. (2) Denoising configurations: We observed that end-to-end training\nintroduces extraneous information. To address this, we propose a two-stage\ntraining strategy to prioritize learning useful visual knowledge. Additionally,\nwe demonstrate that lightweight denoisers can yield remarkable improvements.\n(3) Generation paradigms: We explore both continuous and discrete denoisers\nwith desirable outcomes, validating the versatility of our method. Through our\nin-depth explorations, we have finally arrived at an effective method, namely\nGenHancer, which consistently outperforms prior arts on the MMVP-VLM benchmark,\ne.g., 6.0% on OpenAICLIP. The enhanced CLIP can be further plugged into\nmultimodal large language models for better vision-centric performance. All the\nmodels and codes are made publicly available.",

These processes often require numerous evaluations\nof complex objective functions, which can be computationally expensive and\ntime-consuming. To build efficient and accurate predictive models, we propose a\nnew approach that leverages Bayesian Optimization (BO) to optimize the\nhyper-parameters of a lightweight and accurate Neural Network (NN) for\naerodynamic performance prediction. To clearly describe the interplay between\ndesign variables, hierarchical and categorical kernels are used in the BO\nformulation. We demonstrate the efficiency of our approach through two\ncomprehensive case studies, where the optimized NN significantly outperforms\nbaseline models and other publicly available NNs in terms of accuracy and\nparameter efficiency. For the drag coefficient prediction task, the Mean\nAbsolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of our optimized model drops from 0.1433\\% to\n0.0163\\%, which is nearly an order of magnitude improvement over the baseline\nmodel. Additionally, our model achieves a MAPE of 0.82\\% on a benchmark\naircraft self-noise prediction problem, significantly outperforming existing\nmodels (where their MAPE values are around 2 to 3\\%) while requiring less\ncomputational resources.

We derive effective temperatures from H$\\alpha$ profiles\nusing three-dimensional non local thermodynamic equilibrium (3D NLTE) models,\nand surface gravities and ages from isochrone fitting based on Gaia data. Iron\nabundances were derived in one-dimensional (1D) NLTE, while Mg abundances were\nderived in 1D LTE, 1D NLTE, 3D LTE, and 3D NLTE to show the increasing level of\naccuracy. The stars show a tight trend in the [Mg/Fe] vs [Fe/H] plane with a\nknee at [Fe/H]$\\sim$ -2.8 dex, which indicates a low level of stochasticity.\nTheir location in the Lindblad diagram confirms their belonging to the Galactic\nhalo, but does not show a distinct clustering that might be expected for a\nmerger with a single low-mass galaxy. Comparison with chemical evolution models\nis also not definitive on whether the sample stars were born in-situ or in\naccreted low-mass galaxy mergers.

Similar to Noisier2Noise, a key step in our approach is the\ngeneration of noisier data from which the reconstruction network learns.\nHowever, unlike Noisier2Noise, the proposed loss function operates in\nmeasurement space and is trained to recover an extrapolated image instead of\nthe original noisy one.

    "abstract": "Equilibrium reconstruction, which infers internal magnetic fields, plasmas\ncurrent, and pressure distributions in tokamaks using diagnostic and coil\ncurrent data, is crucial for controlled magnetic confinement nuclear fusion\nresearch. However, traditional numerical methods often fall short of real-time\ncontrol needs due to time-consuming computations or iteration convergence\nissues. This paper introduces EFIT-mini, a novel algorithm blending machine\nlearning with numerical simulation. It employs a multi-task neural network to\nreplace complex steps in numerical equilibrium inversion, such as magnetic\nsurface boundary identification, combining the strengths of both approaches\nwhile mitigating their individual drawbacks. The neural network processes coil\ncurrents and magnetic measurements to directly output plasmas parameters,\nincluding polynomial coefficients for $p'$ and $ff'$, providing high-precision\ninitial values for subsequent Picard iterations. Compared to existing AI-driven\nmethods, EFIT-mini incorporates more physical priors (e.g., least squares\nconstraints) to enhance inversion accuracy. Validated on EXL-50U tokamak\ndischarge data, EFIT-mini achieves over 98% overlap in the last closed flux\nsurface area with traditional methods. Besides, EFIT-mini's neural network and\nfull algorithm compute single time slices in just 0.11ms and 0.36ms at\n129$\\times$129 resolution, respectively, representing a\nthree-order-of-magnitude speedup. This innovative approach leverages machine\nlearning's speed and numerical algorithms' explainability, offering a robust\nsolution for real-time plasmas shape control and potential extension to kinetic\nequilibrium reconstruction. Its efficiency and versatility position EFIT-mini\nas a promising tool for tokamak real-time monitoring and control, as well as\nfor providing key inputs to other real-time inversion algorithms.",

    "abstract": "We study a persistent exclusion process with time-periodic external potential\non a 1d periodic lattice through numerical simulations. A set of run-and-tumble\nparticles move on a lattice of length $L$ and tumbling probability $\\gamma \\ll\n1$ and interact among each other via hardcore exclusion. The effect of the\nexternal potential has been modeled as a special site where the tumbling\nprobability is $1$. We call it a \"defect\" site and move its location along the\nring lattice with speed $u$. In the case of $\\gamma=0$ the system goes to a\njammed state when there is no defect. But introduction of the moving defect\ncreates a strongly phase-separated state where almost all active particles are\npresent in a single large cluster, for small and moderate $u$. This striking\neffect is caused by the long-range velocity correlation of the active\nparticles, induced by the moving defect. For large $u$, a single large cluster\nis no longer stable and breaks into multiple smaller clusters. For nonzero\n$\\gamma$ a competition develops between the timescales associated with tumbling\nand defect motion. While the moving defect attempts to create long-range\nvelocity order, bulk tumbling tends to randomize the velocity alignment. If\n$\\gamma$ is comparable to $u/L$, then a relatively small number of tumbles take\nplace during the time the moving defect travels through the entire system. In\nthis case, the defect has enough time to restore the order in the system and\nour simulations show that the long-range order in velocity and density survive\nfor $\\gamma$ values in this range. As $\\gamma$ increases further, long range\norder is destroyed and the system develops multiple regions of high and low\ndensity. We characterize the density inhomogeneity in this case by measuring\nsubsystem density fluctuations and present a heatmap in the $\\gamma$-$u$ plane\nshowing the regions with most pronounced density inhomogeneities.",

Furthermore, since the synthetic dataset captures\nthe data distribution at each diffusion timestep, we introduce an adversarial\ntraining strategy to align the output distribution of the student model with\nthat of our synthetic dataset, thereby enhancing the video quality. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that our model achieves 8.5x improvements in generation\nspeed compared to the teacher model while maintaining comparable performance.\nCompared to previous accelerating methods, our approach is capable of\ngenerating videos with higher quality and resolution, i.e., 5-seconds,\n720x1280, 24fps.",

A\npain point of FGL is the heterogeneity problem, where nodes or structures\npresent non-IID properties among clients (e.g., different node label\ndistributions), dramatically undermining the convergence and performance of\nFGL. To address this, existing efforts focus on design strategies at the model\nlevel, i.e., they design models to extract common knowledge to mitigate\nheterogeneity. However, these model-level strategies fail to fundamentally\naddress the heterogeneity problem as the model needs to be designed from\nscratch when transferring to other tasks.

Specifically, for each client, it first utilizes the LLM to\ngenerate missing neighbors and then infers connections between generated nodes\nand raw nodes. To improve the quality of generated nodes, we design a novel\nfederated generation-and-reflection mechanism for LLMs, without the need to\nmodify the parameters of the LLM but relying solely on the collective feedback\nfrom all clients. After neighbor generation, all the clients utilize a\npre-trained edge predictor to infer the missing edges. Furthermore, our\nframework can seamlessly integrate as a plug-in with existing FGL methods.\nExperiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our\nmethod compared to advanced baselines.",

State-of-the-art solutions to attain privacy and resilient consensus\nentail an explicit trade-off between the two with an implicit compromise on\naccuracy. In contrast, in the present work, we propose a methodology that\navoids trade-offs between privacy, resilience, and accuracy. We design a\nmethodology that, under certain conditions, enables non-faulty agents, i.e.,\nagents complying with the established protocol, to reach average consensus in\nthe presence of faulty agents, while keeping the non-faulty agents' initial\nstates private. For privacy, agents strategically add noise to obscure their\noriginal state, while later withdrawing a function of it to ensure accuracy.\nBesides, and unlikely many consensus methods, our approach does not require\neach agent to compute the left-eigenvector of the dynamics matrix associated\nwith the eigenvalue one. Moreover, the proposed framework has a polynomial time\ncomplexity relative to the number of agents and the maximum quantity of faulty\nagents.

However, state-of-the-art approaches still struggle\nto handle intricate code patterns, often requiring manual hints or\ndomain-specific expertise. Large language models (LLMs), with their ability to\ncapture intricate patterns, provide a promising solution, yet their effective\napplication in compiler optimizations remains an open challenge due to issues\nsuch as hallucinations and a lack of domain-specific reasoning. In this paper,\nwe present VecTrans, a novel framework that leverages LLMs to enhance\ncompiler-based code vectorization. VecTrans first employs compiler analysis to\nidentify potentially vectorizable code regions. It then utilizes an LLM to\nrefactor these regions into patterns that are more amenable to the compilers\nauto-vectorization. To ensure semantic correctness, VecTrans further integrates\na hybrid validation mechanism at the intermediate representation (IR) level.\nWith the above efforts, VecTrans combines the adaptability of LLMs with the\nprecision of compiler vectorization, thereby effectively opening up the\nvectorization opportunities. experimental results show that among all TSVC\nfunctions unvectorizable by GCC, ICC, Clang, and BiSheng Compiler, VecTrans\nachieves an geomean speedup of 1.77x and successfully vectorizes 24 of 51 test\ncases.

Unintended behaviours arise when a register is mutated\neven when its dependent signals are expected to remain stable (unchanged). Such\ntiming hazards are common because, with a few exceptions, existing HDLs lack\nthe abstraction for stable values and delegate this responsibility to hardware\ndesigners, who then have to carefully decide whether a value remains unchanged,\nsometimes even across hardware modules. This paper proposes Anvil, an HDL which\nstatically prevents timing hazards with a novel type system. Anvil is the only\nHDL we know of that guarantees timing safety without sacrificing expressiveness\nfor cycle-level timing control or dynamic timing behaviours. Instead of\nabstracting away differences between registers and signals, Anvil's type system\nexposes them fully but captures timing relationships between register mutations\nand signal usages for enforcing timing safety. This, in turn, enables safe\ncomposition of communicating hardware modules by static enforcement of timing\ncontracts that encode timing constraints on shared signals. Such timing\ncontracts can be specified parametric on abstract time points that can vary\nduring run-time, allowing the type system to statically express dynamic timing\nbehaviour. We have implemented Anvil and successfully used it for implementing\nkey timing-sensitive modules in an open-source RISC-V CPU, which demonstrates\nits expressiveness and practicality.",

    "abstract": "We present cosmic shear constraints from the completed Kilo-Degree Survey\n(KiDS), where the cosmological parameter $S_8\\equiv\\sigma_8\\sqrt{\\Omega_{\\rm\nm}/0.3} = 0.815^{+0.016}_{-0.021}$, is found to be in agreement ($0.73\\sigma$)\nwith results from the Planck Legacy cosmic microwave background experiment. The\nfinal KiDS footprint spans $1347$ square degrees of deep nine-band imaging\nacross the optical and near-infrared, along with an extra $23$ square degrees\nof KiDS-like calibration observations of deep spectroscopic surveys.\nImprovements in our redshift distribution estimation methodology, combined with\nour enhanced calibration data and multi-band image simulations, allow us to\nextend our lensed sample out to a photometric redshift of $z_{\\rm B}\\leq2.0$.\nCompared to previous KiDS analyses, the increased survey area and redshift\ndepth results in a $\\sim32\\%$ improvement in constraining power in terms of\n$\\Sigma_8\\equiv\\sigma_8\\left(\\Omega_{\\rm m}/0.3\\right)^\\alpha =\n0.821^{+0.014}_{-0.016}$, where $\\alpha = 0.58$ has been optimised to match the\nrevised degeneracy direction of $\\sigma_8$ and $\\Omega_{\\rm m}$. We adopt a new\nphysically motivated intrinsic alignment model that depends jointly on the\ngalaxy sample's halo mass and spectral type distributions, and that is informed\nby previous direct alignment measurements. We also marginalise over our\nuncertainty on the impact of baryon feedback on the non-linear matter power\nspectrum. Comparing to previous KiDS analyses, we conclude that the increase\nseen in $S_8$ primarily results from our improved redshift distribution\nestimation and calibration, as well as new survey area and improved image\nreduction. Our companion paper St\\\"olzner et al.

In Physics,\nsymmetries are used to derive conservation laws and selection rules for\ntransitions in interacting systems. In the early days of nonlinear optics\n(NLO), symmetries were used to formulate a set of rules for photonic processes\naccording to the medium's symmetries that are reflected in the NLO coefficient\ntensor. While this approach was believed to be complete and closed, the field\nhas recently reignited as multi-color ultrashort laser pulses with tailored\npolarization and spatiotemporal structures become standard in NLO. A more\ncomplete theory has been recently emerging, which aims to incorporate all\npossible dynamical degrees of freedom of light: spin and orbital angular\nmomentum, spatial structure, time-dependent polarizations, temporal envelopes,\netc., in addition to the symmetries of the medium. This theoretical development\nis also accompanied by experimental advances that rely on tailored light beams\nthat can now be generated with ever-increasing complexity, including topologies\nin real and a variety of synthetic dimensions, carrying poly-chromatic carrier\nwaves, time-dependent varying angular momenta, local-chirality, and more. The\nnonlinear interactions between light fields with unique symmetries (or\nasymmetries) and matter is especially appealing, since that holds the key for\ndeveloping new ultrafast spectroscopies with sub-femtosecond resolution, for\nexerting exact control over matter, and improving our fundamental understanding\nof how light and matter interact. We review these recent advances in this\nexpanding field, focusing on the theory, its implications, and seminal\nexperiments.

We find that the large-$N$ limit equivalence of the quenched and\nannealed averages provides a field theory version of the ER=EPR. Since the\nwormhole establishes momentum exchanges over arbitrary distance without causal\nsuppression, it provides a mechanism of the planckian dissipation.

In ceramics-based\nthermoelectric materials, the key challenge lies in achieving sufficiently\nhigh-density dislocations to effectively scatter phonons, as the typical\ndislocation density in ceramics after bulk deformation is constrained to 10 to\nthe power of 12 per square meter. In this work, we adopted the mechanical\nimprinting method and achieved a dislocation density of 10 to the power of 15\nper square meter in single-crystal SrTiO3, which is known for its\nroom-temperature plasticity and acts as a promising material for thermoelectric\napplications.

    "abstract": "Diffusion models, which have been advancing rapidly in recent years, may\ngenerate samples that closely resemble the training data. This phenomenon,\nknown as memorization, may lead to copyright issues. In this study, we propose\na method to quantify the ease of reproducing training data in unconditional\ndiffusion models. The average of a sample population following the Langevin\nequation in the reverse diffusion process moves according to a first-order\nordinary differential equation (ODE). This ODE establishes a 1-to-1\ncorrespondence between images and their noisy counterparts in the latent space.\nSince the ODE is reversible and the initial noisy images are sampled randomly,\nthe volume of an image's projected area represents the probability of\ngenerating those images. We examined the ODE, which projects images to latent\nspace, and succeeded in quantifying the ease of reproducing training data by\nmeasuring the volume growth rate in this process. Given the relatively low\ncomputational complexity of this method, it allows us to enhance the quality of\ntraining data by detecting and modifying the easily memorized training samples.",

The\nframework introduces an atrous scan technique that minimizes background\ninterference and expands the receptive field, enhancing Mamba's scanning\ncapabilities. Additionally, the inclusion of a Parallel Vision Mamba (PVM)\nlayer and a shift round operation optimizes feature segmentation and fosters\nrich inter-segment information exchange.

However, many\nfundamental mechanisms of the biomineralization processes such as HAP\nformation, the influence of trace elements, the mineral-collagen arrangement,\netc., are not clearly understood. This is partly due to the analytical\nchallenge of simultaneously characterizing the three-dimensional (3D) structure\nand chemical composition of biominerals in general at the nanometer scale,\nwhich can, in principle be achieved by atom probe tomography (APT). Yet, the\nhierarchical structures of bone represent a critical hurdle for APT analysis in\nterms of sample yield and analytical resolution, particularly for trace\nelements, and organic components from the collagen appear to systematically get\nlost from the analysis. Here, we applied in-situ metallic coating of APT\nspecimens within the focused ion beam (FIB) used for preparing specimens, and\ndemonstrate that the sample yield and chemical sensitivity are tremendously\nimproved, allowing the analysis of individual collagen fibrils and trace\nelements such as Mg and Na. We explored a range of measurement parameters with\nand without coating, in terms of analytical resolution performance and\ndetermined the best practice parameters for analyzing bone samples in APT. To\ndecipher the complex mass spectra of the bone specimens, reference spectra from\npure HAP and collagen were acquired to unambiguously identify the signals,\nallowing us to analyze entire collagen fibrils and interfaces at the\nnear-atomic scale. Our results open new possibilities for understanding the\nhierarchical structure and chemical heterogeneity of bone structures at the\nnear-atomic level and demonstrate the potential of this new method to provide\nnew, unexplored insights into biomineralization processes in the future.",

    "abstract": "Catastrophic forgetting remains a major challenge when neural networks learn\ntasks sequentially. Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) attempts to address this\nproblem by introducing a Bayesian-inspired regularization loss to preserve\nknowledge of previously learned tasks. However, EWC relies on a Laplace\napproximation where the Hessian is simplified to the diagonal of the Fisher\ninformation matrix, assuming uncorrelated model parameters. This overly\nsimplistic assumption often leads to poor Hessian estimates, limiting its\neffectiveness. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Continual Learning\nwith Sampled Quasi-Newton (CSQN), which leverages Quasi-Newton methods to\ncompute more accurate Hessian approximations. CSQN captures parameter\ninteractions beyond the diagonal without requiring architecture-specific\nmodifications, making it applicable across diverse tasks and architectures.\nExperimental results across four benchmarks demonstrate that CSQN consistently\noutperforms EWC and other state-of-the-art baselines, including rehearsal-based\nmethods. CSQN reduces EWC's forgetting by 50 percent and improves its\nperformance by 8 percent on average. Notably, CSQN achieves superior results on\nthree out of four benchmarks, including the most challenging scenarios,\nhighlighting its potential as a robust solution for continual learning.",

However, conventional cloud service\nmanagement techniques, originally designed for traditional workloads, are\nsuboptimal for LMaaS due to its dynamic service workloads and variable request\nloads. To address this, we propose PreServe, a tailored LMaaS management\nframework centered on hierarchical prediction. PreServe incorporates a service\nworkload predictor to estimate periodic token density at a coarse granularity\nand a novel request load predictor to assess the resource demand of individual\nLLM requests, enabling the construction of a load anticipator for each LLM\ninstance. By integrating both long-term and short-term predictions, PreServe\nadjusts resource allocation in advance, mitigating the risks of instance under-\nor over-provisioning. Moreover, PreServe optimizes request routing by\nconsidering both current and anticipated future instance loads, ensuring\nbalanced load distribution across instances. Evaluations on real-world LMaaS\nproduction datasets demonstrate that \\nm outperforms state-of-the-art\napproaches, achieving over 45.9% reduction in tail latency, an average 44.5%\ndecrease in resource consumption, while incurring only 0.23% additional\noverhead.",

Following LLaVA's paradigm, mainstream LVLMs\ntypically employ a shallow MLP for visual-language alignment through a\ntwo-stage training process: pretraining for cross-modal alignment followed by\ninstruction tuning. While this approach has proven effective, the underlying\nmechanisms of how MLPs bridge the modality gap remain poorly understood.\nAlthough some research has explored how LLMs process transformed visual tokens,\nfew studies have investigated the fundamental alignment mechanism. Furthermore,\nthe MLP adapter requires retraining whenever switching LLM backbones. To\naddress these limitations, we first investigate the working principles of MLP\nadapters and discover that they learn to project visual embeddings into\nsubspaces spanned by corresponding text embeddings progressively. Based on this\ninsight, we propose LangBridge, a novel adapter that explicitly maps visual\ntokens to linear combinations of LLM vocabulary embeddings. This innovative\ndesign enables pretraining-free adapter transfer across different LLMs while\nmaintaining performance. Our experimental results demonstrate that a LangBridge\nadapter pre-trained on Qwen2-0.5B can be directly applied to larger models such\nas LLaMA3-8B or Qwen2.5-14B while maintaining competitive performance. Overall,\nLangBridge enables interpretable vision-language alignment by grounding visual\nrepresentations in LLM vocab embedding, while its plug-and-play design ensures\nefficient reuse across multiple LLMs with nearly no performance degradation.\nSee our project page at https://jiaqiliao77.github.io/LangBridge.github.io/",

    "abstract": "Radio experiments trying to detect the global $21$-cm signal from the early\nUniverse are very sensitive to the electrical properties of their environment.\nFor ground-based experiments with the antenna above the soil it is critical to\ncharacterize the effect from the soil on the sky observations. This\ncharacterization requires estimating the soil's electrical conductivity and\nrelative permittivity in the same frequency range as the observations. Here we\npresent our initial effort to estimate the conductivity and relative\npermittivity of the soil using the impedance of an antenna mounted at a\ndistance above the surface. The antenna used is part of the MIST global $21$-cm\nexperiment. We measured the antenna impedance at three sites in the Greater\nConcepci\\'on area, Chile. The measurements were done between $25$ and $125$\nMHz, matching the range used by MIST for sky observations. The soil parameters\nwere estimated by fitting the impedance measurements with electromagnetic\nsimulations of the antenna and soil. In this initial effort the soil was\nmodeled as homogeneous. The conductivity at the three sites was found to be\nbetween $0.007$ and $0.049$ Sm$^{-1}$, and the relative permittivity between\n$1.6$ and $12.7$. The percent precision of the estimates at $68\\%$ probability\nis, with one exception, better (lower) than $33\\%$. The best-fit simulations\nhave a better than $10\\%$ agreement with the measurements relative to the peak\nvalues of the resistance and reactance across our frequency range. For MIST,\nthese results represent a successful proof of concept of the use of the antenna\nimpedance for soil characterization, and are expected to significantly improve\nin future implementations.",

The threshold behavior of positronium (Ps) formation\ncross sections is analyzed as the positron impact energy $E$ approaches zero.\nWithin this framework, we derive a generalized expression for partial-wave\nPs-formation cross sections at low positron energies, which applies to both\nground-state and excited-state sodium targets.

Furthermore, we find that Ps-formation cross sections for positron\nscattering from excited Na states are significantly larger than those from the\nground state in the low-energy region.

However, these methods with this\ngeneralizability tend to recognize the human hand and its adjacent objects as\ngraspable targets, compromising safety during Human-Robot Interaction (HRI). In\nthis work, we propose the Quality-focused Active Adversarial Policy (QFAAP) to\nsolve this problem. Specifically, the first part is the Adversarial Quality\nPatch (AQP), wherein we design the adversarial quality patch loss and leverage\nthe grasp dataset to optimize a patch with high quality scores. Next, we\nconstruct the Projected Quality Gradient Descent (PQGD) and integrate it with\nthe AQP, which contains only the hand region within each real-time frame,\nendowing the AQP with fast adaptability to the human hand shape. Through AQP\nand PQGD, the hand can be actively adversarial with the surrounding objects,\nlowering their quality scores. Therefore, further setting the quality score of\nthe hand to zero will reduce the grasping priority of both the hand and its\nadjacent objects, enabling the robot to grasp other objects away from the hand\nwithout emergency stops. We conduct extensive experiments on the benchmark\ndatasets and a cobot, showing the effectiveness of QFAAP. Our code and demo\nvideos are available here: https://github.com/clee-jaist/QFAAP.",

The complexity of applications results in a wide variety of memory\naccess patterns, prompting the development of numerous cache-prefetching\nalgorithms. Consequently, commercial processors often employ a hybrid of these\nalgorithms to enhance the overall prefetching performance. Nonetheless, since\nthese prefetchers share hardware resources, conflicts arising from competing\nprefetching requests can negate the benefits of hardware prefetching. Under\nsuch circumstances, several prefetcher selection algorithms have been proposed\nto mitigate conflicts between prefetchers. However, these prior solutions\nsuffer from two limitations. First, the input demand request allocation is\ninaccurate. Second, the prefetcher selection criteria are coarse-grained.\n  In this paper, we address both limitations by introducing an efficient and\nwidely applicable prefetcher selection algorithm--Alecto, which tailors the\ndemand requests for each prefetcher. Every demand request is first sent to\nAlecto to identify suitable prefetchers before being routed to prefetchers for\ntraining and prefetching. Our analysis shows that Alecto is adept at not only\nharmonizing prefetching accuracy, coverage, and timeliness but also\nsignificantly enhancing the utilization of the prefetcher table, which is vital\nfor temporal prefetching. Alecto outperforms the state-of-the-art RL-based\nprefetcher selection algorithm--Bandit by 2.76% in single-core, and 7.56% in\neight-core. For memory-intensive benchmarks, Alecto outperforms Bandit by\n5.25%. Alecto consistently delivers state-of-the-art performance in scheduling\nvarious types of cache prefetchers.

    "abstract": "In recent years, the rapid development of machine learning has brought\nreforms and challenges to traditional communication systems. Semantic\ncommunication has appeared as an effective strategy to effectively extract\nrelevant semantic signals semantic segmentation labels and image features for\nimage transmission. However, the insufficient number of extracted semantic\nfeatures of images will potentially result in a low reconstruction accuracy,\nwhich hinders the practical applications and still remains challenging for\nsolving. In order to fill this gap, this letter proposes a multi-text\ntransmission semantic communication (Multi-SC) system, which uses the visual\nlanguage model (VLM) to assist in the transmission of image semantic signals.\nUnlike previous image transmission semantic communication systems, the proposed\nsystem divides the image into multiple blocks and extracts multiple text\ninformation from the image using a modified large language and visual assistant\n(LLaVA), and combines semantic segmentation tags with semantic text for image\nrecovery. Simulation results show that the proposed text semantics diversity\nscheme can significantly improve the reconstruction accuracy compared with\nrelated works.",

On the contrary, while flow models have gained\npopularity as an alternative to diffusion models--offering faster generation\nand high-quality outputs in state-of-the-art image and video generative\nmodels--efficient inference-time scaling methods used for diffusion models\ncannot be directly applied due to their deterministic generative process.

It is naturally suited, and has been successfully used,\nto describe the thermodynamics of chemical reaction networks (CRNs) based on\nthe Legendre duality between concentration and potential spaces, where\nalgebraic constraints are enforced by the stoichiometry. In this article, the\nRiemannian geometrical aspects of the theory are explored. It is shown that\nduality between concentration and potential spaces and the natural\nparametrizations of equilibrium subspace are isometries, which leads to a\nmultivariate Cramer-Rao bound through the comparison of two Riemannian metric\ntensors.\n  In the subsequent part, the theory is applied to the recently introduced\nconcept of absolute sensitivity. Using the Riemannian geometric tools, it is\nproven that the absolute sensitivity is a projection operator onto the tangent\nbundle of the equilibrium manifold. A linear algebraic characterization and\nexplicit results on first order corrections to the thermodynamics of ideal\nsolutions are provided. Finally, the theory is applied to the IDHKP-IDH\nglyoxylate bypass regulation system.\n  The novelty of the theory is that it is applicable to CRNs with non-ideal\nthermodynamical behavior, which are prevalent in highly crowded cellular\nenvironments due to various interactions between the chemicals. Indeed, the\nanalyzed example shows remarkable behavior ranging from hypersensitivity to\nnegative-self regulations. These are effects which usually require strongly\nnonlinear reaction kinetics.

However, the\nspatial heterogeneity and temporal dynamics of geographic data make the\nout-of-distribution (OOD) generalisation problem particularly salient. The\nlatter are particularly sensitive to distribution shifts (feature and\nstructural shifts) between testing and training data and are the main causes of\nthe OOD generalisation problem. Spurious correlations are present between\ninvariant and background representations due to selection biases and\nenvironmental effects, resulting in the model extremes being more likely to\nlearn background representations. The existing approaches focus on background\nrepresentation changes that are determined by shifts in the feature\ndistributions of nodes in the training and test data while ignoring changes in\nthe proportional distributions of heterogeneous and homogeneous neighbour\nnodes, which we refer to as structural distribution shifts. We propose a\nfeature-structure mixed invariant representation learning (FSM-IRL) model that\naccounts for both feature distribution shifts and structural distribution\nshifts. To address structural distribution shifts, we introduce a sampling\nmethod based on causal attention, encouraging the model to identify nodes\npossessing strong causal relationships with labels or nodes that are more\nsimilar to the target node. Inspired by the Hilbert-Schmidt independence\ncriterion, we implement a reweighting strategy to maximise the orthogonality of\nthe node representations, thereby mitigating the spurious correlations among\nthe node representations and suppressing the learning of background\nrepresentations.

    "abstract": "Studying exotic hadrons is a challenge against the conventional quark model,\nproviding us with a good platform to deepen our understanding of the strong\ninteraction. An inclusive study of the exotic hadrons in vacuum and at finite\ntemperature is an intriguing approach to shed light on their nature. As a first\nstep, we study the $Z_c(3900)$ in both the $D\\bar{D}^\\ast$ hadronic molecular\nand the triangle singularity pictures, and discuss the behaviors of $Z_c(3900)$\nat finite temperature in these two different pictures. As a result, we show the\nproperties that its mass becomes smaller and its width becomes larger when the\ntemperature increases, which are seen commonly in the hadronic molecular\npicture and in the triangle singularity picture. The enhanced widths in hot\nmedium indicate that the $Z_c(3900)$ will be dissociated at a sufficiently high\ntemperature. This feature is also reflected by a decrease of the effective\ncouplings in the hadronic molecular picture. It is concluded that, not only in\nvacuum but also in hot medium, the behaviors of $Z_{c}(3900)$ are similar in\nthe two different interpretations of $Z_c(3900)$.",

In this regard, we present DeClotH, which separately\nreconstructs 3D cloth and human body from a single image. This task remains\nlargely unexplored due to the extreme occlusion between cloth and the human\nbody, making it challenging to infer accurate geometries and textures.\nMoreover, while recent 3D human reconstruction methods have achieved impressive\nresults using text-to-image diffusion models, directly applying such an\napproach to this problem often leads to incorrect guidance, particularly in\nreconstructing 3D cloth. To address these challenges, we propose two core\ndesigns in our framework. First, to alleviate the occlusion issue, we leverage\n3D template models of cloth and human body as regularizations, which provide\nstrong geometric priors to prevent erroneous reconstruction by the occlusion.\nSecond, we introduce a cloth diffusion model specifically designed to provide\ncontextual information about cloth appearance, thereby enhancing the\nreconstruction of 3D cloth. Qualitative and quantitative experiments\ndemonstrate that our proposed approach is highly effective in reconstructing\nboth 3D cloth and the human body.

However, the\nproblem of dependency explosion, in which a large number of normal computer\nsystem operations such as operations by authorized users are included in the\ndependencies, results in a huge generated graph, making it difficult to\nidentify malicious activities.\n  In this paper, we propose a method to reduce the search space for malicious\nactivities by extracting and removing frequently occurring benign activities\nthrough natural language processing of log data and analysis of activities in\nthe computer system using similarity judgments. In the evaluation experiment,\nwe used the DARPA TC Dateset, a large-scale public dataset, to evaluate the\neffectiveness of the proposed method on the dependency explosion problem.

Traditional RIS-based\nlocalization methods typically rely on prior channel knowledge, beam scanning,\nand pilot-based assistance. These approaches often result in substantial energy\nand computational overhead, and require real-time coordination between the base\nstation (BS) and the RIS. To address these challenges, in this work, we move\nbeyond conventional methods and introduce a novel data-driven, multiple\nRISs-assisted passive localization approach (RAPL). The proposed method\nincludes two stages, the angle-of-directions (AoDs) between the RISs and the\nuser is estimated by using the conditional sample mean in the first stage, and\nthen the user's position is determined based on the estimated multiple AoD\npairs in the second stage. This approach only utilizes the existing\ncommunication signals between the user and the BS, relying solely on the\nmeasurement of received signal power at each BS antenna for a set of randomly\ngenerated phase shifts across all RISs. Moreover, by obviating the need for\nreal-time RIS phase shift optimization or user-to-BS pilot transmissions, the\nmethod introduces no additional communication overhead, making it highly\nsuitable for deployment in real-world networks. The proposed scheme is then\nextended to multi-RIS scenarios considering both parallel and cascaded RIS\ntopologies.

    "abstract": "Training large language models (LLMs) is resource-intensive and expensive,\nmaking protecting intellectual property (IP) for LLMs crucial. Recently,\nembedding fingerprints into LLMs has emerged as a prevalent method for\nestablishing model ownership. However, existing fingerprinting techniques\ntypically embed identifiable patterns with weak semantic coherence, resulting\nin fingerprints that significantly differ from the natural question-answering\n(QA) behavior inherent to LLMs. This discrepancy undermines the stealthiness of\nthe embedded fingerprints and makes them vulnerable to adversarial attacks. In\nthis paper, we first demonstrate the critical vulnerability of existing\nfingerprint embedding methods by introducing a novel adversarial attack named\nGeneration Revision Intervention (GRI) attack. GRI attack exploits the semantic\nfragility of current fingerprinting methods, effectively erasing fingerprints\nby disrupting their weakly correlated semantic structures. Our empirical\nevaluation highlights that traditional fingerprinting approaches are\nsignificantly compromised by the GRI attack, revealing severe limitations in\ntheir robustness under realistic adversarial conditions. To advance the\nstate-of-the-art in model fingerprinting, we propose a novel model fingerprint\nparadigm called Implicit Fingerprints (ImF). ImF leverages steganography\ntechniques to subtly embed ownership information within natural texts,\nsubsequently using Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting to construct semantically\ncoherent and contextually natural QA pairs. This design ensures that\nfingerprints seamlessly integrate with the standard model behavior, remaining\nindistinguishable from regular outputs and substantially reducing the risk of\naccidental triggering and targeted removal. We conduct a comprehensive\nevaluation of ImF on 15 diverse LLMs, spanning different architectures and\nvarying scales.",

In\ncontrast, the Arctic mode showed a 5-6-year cycle without 11-year periodicity.\nThis difference likely arises from the seasonal timing of polar vortex\nbreakdowns: the Antarctic vortex persists into late spring and summer, making\nit more sensitive to solar radiation, while the Arctic vortex peaks in winter\nand early spring. The fourth mode showed features of a Southern Hemisphere\ndipole and was significantly correlated with the Antarctic mode, leading it by\nabout two months.

Our results suggest that the multi-agent system (MAS)\nperformed better than the single-agent system (SAS) with mortality prediction\naccuracy (59%, 56%) and the mean error for length of stay (LOS)(4.37 days, 5.82\ndays), respectively. However, the transparency score for the SAS (86.21) is\nslightly better than the transparency score for MAS (85.5).

However,\nthese methods may struggle with maintaining structural integrity and recovering\nthe anomaly-free content of abnormal regions, especially in multi-class\nscenarios. Furthermore, diffusion models are inherently designed to generate\nimages from pure noise and struggle to selectively alter anomalous regions of\nan image while preserving normal ones. This leads to potential degradation of\nnormal regions during reconstruction, hampering the effectiveness of anomaly\ndetection. This paper introduces a reformulation of the standard diffusion\nmodel geared toward selective region alteration, allowing the accurate\nidentification of anomalies. By modeling anomalies as noise in the latent\nspace, our proposed Deviation correction diffusion (DeCo-Diff) model preserves\nthe normal regions and encourages transformations exclusively on anomalous\nareas. This selective approach enhances the reconstruction quality,\nfacilitating effective unsupervised detection and localization of anomaly\nregions. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate the superiority of our method in\naccurately identifying and localizing anomalies in complex images, with\npixel-level AUPRC improvements of 11-14% over state-of-the-art models on well\nknown anomaly detection datasets.

The recent experimental realization of the Pauli engine, where energy\nis extracted via changes in particle statistics as an alternative to\nconventional heat sources has opened new avenues of research where quantum\nstatistics can be considered as a thermodynamic resource. In this work we\npropose hybrid quantum heat engines which utilize additional strokes that\nchange the single particle statistics between bosonic and fermionic\ndescriptions during the cycle. To accomplish this we consider the 1D Lieb\nLiniger gas whereby the s wave interactions can be tuned between the non\ninteracting and the hard core limit, which are described by bosonic and\nfermionic statistics respectively. We show that by suitably choosing where to\nimplement these statistical strokes during an Otto like cycle, the efficiency\nand work output can be significantly enhanced when compared to fully bosonic or\nfully fermionic engines. Furthermore, in the degenerate regime our engine can\noperate at the Carnot efficiency, due to the interplay between the different\ncontributions of heat and work induced by the statistical strokes.

Despite recent progress in the field, it remains\nchallenging to quantify uncertainty in these networks. While approaches such as\nBayesian PINNs (B-PINNs) provide a principled approach to capturing uncertainty\nthrough Bayesian inference, they can be computationally expensive for\nlarge-scale applications. In this work, we propose Epistemic Physics-Informed\nNeural Networks (E-PINNs), a framework that leverages a small network, the\n\\emph{epinet}, to efficiently quantify uncertainty in PINNs. The proposed\napproach works as an add-on to existing, pre-trained PINNs with a small\ncomputational overhead. We demonstrate the applicability of the proposed\nframework in various test cases and compare the results with B-PINNs using\nHamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) posterior estimation and dropout-equipped PINNs\n(Dropout-PINNs). Our experiments show that E-PINNs provide similar coverage to\nB-PINNs, with often comparable sharpness, while being computationally more\nefficient.

    "abstract": "Prior work using Masked Autoencoders (MAEs) typically relies on random patch\nmasking based on the assumption that images have significant redundancies\nacross different channels, allowing for the reconstruction of masked content\nusing cross-channel correlations. However, this assumption does not hold in\nMulti-Channel Imaging (MCI), where channels may provide complementary\ninformation with minimal feature overlap. Thus, these MAEs primarily learn\nlocal structures within individual channels from patch reconstruction, failing\nto fully leverage cross-channel interactions and limiting their MCI\neffectiveness. In this paper, we present ChA-MAEViT, an MAE-based method that\nenhances feature learning across MCI channels via four key strategies: (1)\ndynamic channel-patch masking, which compels the model to reconstruct missing\nchannels in addition to masked patches, thereby enhancing cross-channel\ndependencies and improving robustness to varying channel configurations; (2)\nmemory tokens, which serve as long-term memory aids to promote information\nsharing across channels, addressing the challenges of reconstructing\nstructurally diverse channels; (3) hybrid token fusion module, which merges\nfine-grained patch tokens with a global class token to capture richer\nrepresentations; and (4) Channel-Aware Decoder, a lightweight decoder utilizes\nchannel tokens to effectively reconstruct image patches. Experiments on\nsatellite and microscopy datasets, CHAMMI, JUMP-CP, and So2Sat, show that\nChA-MAEViT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art MCI-ViTs by 3.0-21.5%,\nhighlighting the importance of cross-channel interactions in MCI.",

    "abstract": "Though high-performance computing enables high-fidelity simulations of\ncomplex engineering systems, accurately resolving multi-scale physics for\nreal-world problems remains computationally prohibitive, particularly in\nmany-query applications such as optimization and uncertainty quantification.\nProjection-based model order reduction (MOR) has demonstrated significant\npotential for reducing computational costs by orders of magnitude through the\ncreation of reduced-order models (ROMs). However, physical problems featuring\nstrong convection, such as hypersonic flows and detonations, pose significant\nchallenges to conventional MOR techniques due to the slow decay of Kolmogorov\nN-width present in these problems. In the past few years various approaches\nhave been proposed to address this challenge; one of the promising methods is\nthe adaptive MOR. In this work, we introduce a feature-guided adaptive\nprojection-based MOR framework tailored for convection-dominated problems\ninvolving flames and shocks. This approach dynamically updates the ROM subspace\nand incorporates a feature-guided sampling method that strategically selects\nsampling points to capture prominent convective features, ensuring accurate\npredictions of crucial dynamics in the target problems. We evaluate the\nproposed methodology using a suite of challenging convection-dominated test\nproblems, including shocks, flames, and detonations. The results demonstrate\nthe feature-guided adaptive ROM's capability in producing efficient and\nreliable predictions of the nonlinear convection-dominated physical phenomena\nin the selected test suite, which are well recognized to be challenging for\nconventional ROM methods.",

    "abstract": "This paper explores the advancement of Vehicular Edge Computing (VEC) as a\ntailored application of Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) for the automotive\nindustry, addressing the rising demand for real-time processing in connected\nand autonomous vehicles. VEC brings computational resources closer to vehicles,\nreducing data processing delays crucial for safety-critical applications such\nas autonomous driving and intelligent traffic management. However, the\nchallenge lies in managing the high and dynamic task load generated by\nvehicles' data streams. We focus on enhancing task offloading and scheduling\ntechniques to optimize both communication and computation latencies in VEC\nnetworks. Our approach involves implementing task scheduling algorithms,\nincluding First-Come, First-Served (FCFS), Shortest Deadline First (SDF), and\nParticle Swarm Optimization (PSO) for optimization. Additionally, we divide\nportions of tasks between the MEC servers and vehicles to reduce the number of\ndropped tasks and improve real-time adaptability. This paper also compares\nfixed and shared bandwidth scenarios to manage transmission efficiency under\nvarying loads. Our findings indicate that MEC+Local (partitioning) scenario\nsignificantly outperforms MEC-only scenario by ensuring the completion of all\ntasks, resulting in a zero task drop ratio. The MEC-only scenario demonstrates\napproximately 5.65% better average end-to-end latency compared to the MEC+Local\n(partitioning) scenario when handling 200 tasks. However, this improvement\ncomes at the cost of dropping a significant number of tasks (109 out of 200).\nAdditionally, allocating shared bandwidth helps to slightly decrease\ntransmission waiting time compared to using fixed bandwidth.",

To facilitate our\nanalysis, we propose a data synthesis pipeline to synthesize high-quality data.\nWe demonstrate that synthetic hand data can achieve the same level of accuracy\nas real data when integrating our identified components, paving the path to use\nsynthetic data alone for hand pose estimation.

    "abstract": "This paper introduces the centroid decision forest (CDF), a novel ensemble\nlearning framework that redefines the splitting strategy and tree building in\nthe ordinary decision trees for high-dimensional classification. The splitting\napproach in CDF differs from the traditional decision trees in theat the class\nseparability score (CSS) determines the selection of the most discriminative\nfeatures at each node to construct centroids of the partitions (daughter\nnodes). The splitting criterion uses the Euclidean distance measurements from\neach class centroid to achieve a splitting mechanism that is more flexible and\nrobust. Centroids are constructed by computing the mean feature values of the\nselected features for each class, ensuring a class-representative division of\nthe feature space. This centroid-driven approach enables CDF to capture complex\nclass structures while maintaining interpretability and scalability. To\nevaluate CDF, 23 high-dimensional datasets are used to assess its performance\nagainst different state-of-the-art classifiers through classification accuracy\nand Cohen's kappa statistic. The experimental results show that CDF outperforms\nthe conventional methods establishing its effectiveness and flexibility for\nhigh-dimensional classification problems.",

    "abstract": "The Categorical Message Passing Language (CaMPL) is a concurrent programming\nlanguage with a categorical semantics based on a linear actegory. CaMPL has a\nsequential and a concurrent side. The sequential side is a functional-style\nprogramming language which has a linear actegorical action on the concurrent\nside to produce a semantics for message passing. Concurrent processes in CaMPL\ntalk to each other along typed channels (or protocols). The typed channels of\neach CaMPL process are split into input and output polarity channels, allowing\nprocesses to be plugged together by connecting an output polarity channel of\none process to an input polarity channel of another (provided the channels are\nof the same protocol). Channel polarities can be flipped input to output with a\nlinear logic-style negation. A desirable feature of a concurrent\nmessage-passing language, such as CaMPL, is that it should support higher-order\nprocesses. This allows processes to be passed as first-class citizens between\nprocesses. While the ability to pass concurrent processes is already present in\nany closed linear type system-such as CaMPL's-supporting arbitrary recursive\nprocess definitions requires reusing passed processes. Concurrent resources in\nCaMPL cannot be duplicated, thus, passing processes as linear closures does not\nprovide the required flexibility. Instead, processes must be passed as\nsequential data, and the concurrent side must be enriched in the sequential\nside. This paper concerns the categorical semantics that lets us store\nconcurrent processes as sequential data and yet use them. Abstractly, this is\ngiven by the equivalence between an actegory with hom-objects and an enriched\ncategory with copowers. In the closed symmetric case, this was studied by Kelly\nand Janelidze. Here, we present the proof of this equivalence for the\nnon-symmetric, non-closed case in detail.",

Nevertheless, existing RGB-T\nsemantic segmentation models typically depend on simple addition or\nconcatenation strategies or ignore the differences between information at\ndifferent levels. To address these issues, we proposed a novel RGB-T road scene\nsemantic segmentation network called Brain-Inspired Multi-Iteration Interaction\nNetwork (BIMII-Net). First, to meet the requirements of accurate texture and\nlocal information extraction in road scenarios like autonomous driving, we\nproposed a deep continuous-coupled neural network (DCCNN) architecture based on\na brain-inspired model. Second, to enhance the interaction and expression\ncapabilities among multi-modal information, we designed a cross explicit\nattention-enhanced fusion module (CEAEF-Module) in the feature fusion stage of\nBIMII-Net to effectively integrate features at different levels.

    "abstract": "Blockchain consensus mechanisms must balance security, decentralization, and\nefficiency while ensuring fair participation. Proof of Team Sprint (PoTS) is a\ncooperative consensus mechanism designed to address the energy inefficiencies\nand centralization tendencies of traditional Proof of Work (PoW). Unlike PoW,\nwhere rewards disproportionately favor high-performance nodes, PoTS encourages\ncollaboration by forming teams and distributing rewards more equitably among\nparticipants. In this study, we evaluate the fairness properties of PoTS by\nanalyzing reward distribution under varying computational power distributions.\nThrough extensive simulations, we compare equal-share allocation and\nproportional reward allocation, highlighting their impact on decentralization\nand participation. Our results demonstrate that PoTS significantly reduces\nreward disparity between high-performance and low-performance nodes, fostering\na more inclusive ecosystem. Additionally, we observe that as team sizes\nincrease, the influence of individual computational power is mitigated,\nallowing lower-performance nodes to contribute meaningfully. Moreover, our\nfindings reveal that the marginal benefit of investing in extremely\nhigh-performance hardware diminishes, which discourages centralization and\naligns incentives toward sustainable participation. We also discuss the\neconomic implications of PoTS, particularly its potential to reshape blockchain\nmining strategies by balancing fairness with computational efficiency.

These additive\ncombinatorics results play a central role in the recent progress of fundamental\nproblems in theoretical computer science including Knapsack and Subset Sum. The\nnon-constructiveness of relevant additive combinatorics results affects their\napplication in algorithms. In particular, several additive combinatorics-based\nalgorithms for Subset Sum work only for the decision version of the problem,\nbut not for the search version.\n  We provide constructive proofs for finite addition theorems [S\\'ark\\H{o}zy'89\n'94], which are fundamental results in additive combinatorics concerning the\nexistence of long arithmetic progression in sumsets and subset sums. Our\nconstructive proofs yield a near-linear time algorithm that returns an\narithmetic progression explicitly, and moreover, for each term in the\narithmetic progression, it also returns its representation as the sum of\nelements in the base set.\n  As an application, we obtain an $\\tilde{O}(n)$-time algorithm for the search\nversion of dense subset sum now.

    "abstract": "This work introduces a novel multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) metamodeling\napproach for variance function estimation. Although devising an efficient\nexperimental design for simulation metamodeling can be elusive, the MLMC-based\napproach addresses this challenge by dynamically adjusting the number of design\npoints and budget allocation at each level, thereby automatically creating an\nefficient design. Theoretical analyses show that, under mild conditions, the\nproposed MLMC metamodeling approach for variance function estimation can\nachieve superior computational efficiency compared to standard Monte Carlo\nmetamodeling while achieving the desired level of accuracy. Additionally, this\nwork establishes the asymptotic normality of the MLMC metamodeling estimator\nunder certain sufficient conditions, providing valuable insights for\nuncertainty quantification. Finally, two MLMC metamodeling procedures are\nproposed for variance function estimation: one to achieve a target accuracy\nlevel and another to efficiently utilize a fixed computational budget.\nNumerical evaluations support the theoretical results and demonstrate the\npotential of the proposed approach in facilitating global sensitivity analysis.",

    "abstract": "This study evaluates the robustness of Proof of Team Sprint (PoTS) against\nadversarial attacks through simulations, focusing on the attacker win rate and\ncomputational efficiency under varying team sizes (\\( N \\)) and attacker ratios\n(\\( \\alpha \\)). Our results demonstrate that PoTS effectively reduces an\nattacker's ability to dominate the consensus process. For instance, when \\(\n\\alpha = 0.5 \\), the attacker win rate decreases from 50.7\\% at \\( N = 1 \\) to\nbelow 0.4\\% at \\( N = 8 \\), effectively neutralizing adversarial influence.\nSimilarly, at \\( \\alpha = 0.8 \\), the attacker win rate drops from 80.47\\% at\n\\( N = 1 \\) to only 2.79\\% at \\( N = 16 \\). In addition to its strong security\nproperties, PoTS maintains high computational efficiency. We introduce the\nconcept of Normalized Computation Efficiency (NCE) to quantify this efficiency\ngain, showing that PoTS significantly improves resource utilization as team\nsize increases. The results indicate that as \\( N \\) grows, PoTS not only\nenhances security but also achieves better computational efficiency due to the\naveraging effects of execution time variations. These findings highlight PoTS\nas a promising alternative to traditional consensus mechanisms, offering both\nrobust security and efficient resource utilization. By leveraging team-based\nblock generation and randomized participant reassignment, PoTS provides a\nscalable and resilient approach to decentralized consensus.",

Recent studies have suggested that texture features extracted from\nretinal layers can be adopted as biomarkers for PD diagnosis under optical\ncoherence tomography (OCT) images. Frequency domain learning techniques can\nenhance the feature representations of deep neural networks (DNNs) by\ndecomposing frequency components involving rich texture features. Additionally,\nprevious works have not exploited texture features for automated PD screening\nin OCT. Motivated by the above analysis, we propose a novel Adaptive Wavelet\nFilter (AWF) that serves as the Practical Texture Feature Amplifier to fully\nleverage the merits of texture features to boost the PD screening performance\nof DNNs with the aid of frequency domain learning. Specifically, AWF first\nenhances texture feature representation diversities via channel mixer, then\nemphasizes informative texture feature representations with the well-designed\nadaptive wavelet filtering token mixer. By combining the AWFs with the DNN\nstem, AWFNet is constructed for automated PD screening. Additionally, we\nintroduce a novel Balanced Confidence (BC) Loss by mining the potential of\nsample-wise predicted probabilities of all classes and class frequency prior,\nto further boost the PD screening performance and trustworthiness of AWFNet.\nThe extensive experiments manifest the superiority of our AWFNet and BC over\nstate-of-the-art methods in terms of PD screening performance and\ntrustworthiness.",

We conducted large-scale simulations\ncomparing PoTS with conventional Proof of Work (PoW) across various team sizes\nand computational conditions. In PoW, the highest-performance node ranked first\nin all 100 trials, demonstrating extreme centralization. In contrast, PoTS\nreduced this dominance: the same node ranked first only 54 times, indicating\nfairer reward distribution. Statistical analysis showed that as team size\nincreased, skewness and kurtosis of reward distributions decreased, confirming\nimproved equity among participants. PoTS also demonstrated significant energy\nsavings. The total active computation time followed a near $1/N$ scaling trend,\nreducing energy use by up to 64 times when team size was 64, while preserving\nconsensus integrity. Repeated simulations showed stable reward distributions\nand system performance, affirming PoTS's robustness.

The\nphysical properties of the PN can then be linked to those of its progenitor\nstar. Using GHOST/Gemini high-resolution nebular spectra, we measured the PN\nsystemic radial velocity to compare it with that of the putative host cluster,\ndetermined from Gaia. We estimated the physical parameters of both the OC and\nthe PN using our data, together with estimates from previous studies and\ntheoretical cluster isochrones and evolutionary tracks to show they are\ncompatible. The precise, systemic radial velocity of the PN that was\ndetermined, is consistent among the errors with that of the OC and its 1 km/s\nassociated velocity dispersion, a primary requirement for cluster membership.\nWe have determined other physical parameters of the PN and the OC, such as age\nand distance, which also match within the errors. These results present\ncompelling evidence for the physical association of the PN and the OC. The PN\nage was found to be 11 kyr and the effective temperature of its central star\nwas estimated as 130 kK.

    "abstract": "The study investigates the efficacy of pre-trained language models (PLMs) in\nanalyzing argumentative moves in a longitudinal learner corpus. Prior studies\non argumentative moves often rely on qualitative analysis and manual coding,\nlimiting their efficiency and generalizability. The study aims to: 1) to assess\nthe reliability of PLMs in analyzing argumentative moves; 2) to utilize\nPLM-generated annotations to illustrate developmental patterns and predict\nwriting quality. A longitudinal corpus of 1643 argumentative texts from 235\nEnglish learners in China is collected and annotated into six move types:\nclaim, data, counter-claim, counter-data, rebuttal, and non-argument. The\ncorpus is divided into training, validation, and application sets annotated by\nhuman experts and PLMs. We use BERT as one of the implementations of PLMs. The\nresults indicate a robust reliability of PLMs in analyzing argumentative moves,\nwith an overall F1 score of 0.743, surpassing existing models in the field.\nAdditionally, PLM-labeled argumentative moves effectively capture developmental\npatterns and predict writing quality. Over time, students exhibit an increase\nin the use of data and counter-claims and a decrease in non-argument moves.\nWhile low-quality texts are characterized by a predominant use of claims and\ndata supporting only oneside position, mid- and high-quality texts demonstrate\nan integrative perspective with a higher ratio of counter-claims, counter-data,\nand rebuttals. This study underscores the transformative potential of\nintegrating artificial intelligence into language education, enhancing the\nefficiency and accuracy of evaluating students' writing. The successful\napplication of PLMs can catalyze the development of educational technology,\npromoting a more data-driven and personalized learning environment that\nsupports diverse educational needs.",

    "abstract": "Semantic segmentation has made significant strides in pixel-level image\nunderstanding, yet it remains limited in capturing contextual and semantic\nrelationships between objects. Current models, such as CNN and\nTransformer-based architectures, excel at identifying pixel-level features but\nfail to distinguish semantically similar objects (e.g., \"doctor\" vs. \"nurse\" in\na hospital scene) or understand complex contextual scenarios (e.g.,\ndifferentiating a running child from a regular pedestrian in autonomous\ndriving). To address these limitations, we proposed a novel Context-Aware\nSemantic Segmentation framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs)\nwith state-of-the-art vision backbones. Our hybrid model leverages the Swin\nTransformer for robust visual feature extraction and GPT-4 for enriching\nsemantic understanding through text embeddings. A Cross-Attention Mechanism is\nintroduced to align vision and language features, enabling the model to reason\nabout context more effectively. Additionally, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are\nemployed to model object relationships within the scene, capturing dependencies\nthat are overlooked by traditional models. Experimental results on benchmark\ndatasets (e.g., COCO, Cityscapes) demonstrate that our approach outperforms the\nexisting methods in both pixel-level accuracy (mIoU) and contextual\nunderstanding (mAP). This work bridges the gap between vision and language,\npaving the path for more intelligent and context-aware vision systems in\napplications including autonomous driving, medical imaging, and robotics.",

This technique enables us to gain\ninsights from reference images, understand the creative processes of great\nartists, and generate impressive new images. To address this challenge, we\npropose a method known as automatic reverse prompt optimization (ARPO).\nSpecifically, our method refines an initial prompt into a high-quality prompt\nthrough an iteratively imitative gradient prompt optimization process: 1)\ngenerating a recreated image from the current prompt to instantiate its\nguidance capability; 2) producing textual gradients, which are candidate\nprompts intended to reduce the difference between the recreated image and the\nreference image; 3) updating the current prompt with textual gradients using a\ngreedy search method to maximize the CLIP similarity between prompt and\nreference image. We compare ARPO with several baseline methods, including\nhandcrafted techniques, gradient-based prompt tuning methods, image captioning,\nand data-driven selection method.

This concurrent\nobject (which we call a \"channel\" object) exports traditional methods, but,\nespecially in an incoherent or uncacheable memory network, stores its state in\na distributed fashion across all participating nodes. In a sense, the channel\nobject's state is stored \"across the network\".\n  Based on this philosophy, we introduce the Library of Channel Objects (LOCO),\na library for building multi-node objects on RDMA. Channel objects are\ncomposable and designed for both the strong locality effects and the weak\nconsistency of RDMA. Unlike prior work, channel objects do not hide memory\ncomplexity, instead relying on the programmer to use NUMA-like techniques to\nexplicitly manage each object. As a consequence, our channel objects have\nperformance similar to custom RDMA systems (e.g. distributed maps), but with a\nfar simpler programming model. Our distributed map channel has better read and\ncomparable write performance to a state-of-the-art custom RDMA solution, using\nwell-encapsulated and reusable primitives.",

We study\ndifferentially private algorithms, called privacy wrappers, that, given\nblack-box access to a real-valued function $f$ and a sensitive dataset $x$,\noutput an accurate approximation to $f(x)$. The dataset $x$ is modeled as a\nfinite subset of a possibly infinite set $U$, in which each entry represents\ndata of one individual.

We deployed 39 single-sensor stations across Nevada and\nUtah, strategically distributed to capture signals from distinct trajectory\npoints. Infrasound data were analyzed to examine how signal amplitude and\nperiod vary with altitude and propagation path for a non-ablating hypersonic\nobject with well-defined physical and aerodynamic properties. Raytracing\nsimulations incorporated atmospheric specifications from the Ground-2-Space\nmodel to estimate source altitudes for observed signals. Results confirmed\nballistic arrivals at all stations, with source altitudes ranging from 44 km to\n62 km along the trajectory. Signal period and amplitude exhibited strong\ndependence on source altitude, with higher altitudes corresponding to lower\namplitudes, longer periods, and reduced high-frequency content. Regression\nanalysis demonstrated strong correlations between signal characteristics and\nboth altitude and propagation geometry. Our results suggest, when attenuation\nis considered, the amplitude is primarily determined by the source, with the\npropagation path playing a secondary role over the distances examined.

    "abstract": "Abstraction or substitution and aggregation are the most widely used\nsimulation model simplification operations. Abstraction involves replacing\nsubsystems within a discrete-event simulation (DES) with one or more quantities\n- typically random variables - representing the lengths of stay in the\nsubsystems(s) in question to create a `simplified' system comprising only of\nsubsystems of interest to the analysis at hand. Aggregation involves replacing\nmore than one subsystem of the original `parent' simulation with a single\nsubsystem. However, the model simplification process itself can be expensive,\nin terms of the computational runtime and effort required to collect the data\nrequired to estimate the distributions of the length of stay variables, the\ndistribution-fitting process, and testing and validation of the simplified\nmodel. Moreover, the savings in simulation runtime that the simplification\nprocess yields is \\textit{a priori} unknown to the modeller. In this context, a\nmethod that predicts the runtime savings (RS) from DES model simplification\noperations before their execution - at the conceptualisation stage of the\nsimplified model development process - may help judge whether its development\nis indeed worth undertaking. In this paper, we present a queueing-theoretic\nframework for the prediction of RS from model simplification operations. Our\nframework is applicable for DES models comprising $M/M/, M/G/ \\text{ and }\nG/G/$ subsystems. The performance of the RS prediction framework is\ndemonstrated using multiple computational experiments. Our proposed framework\ncontributes to the literature around DES model complexity and more broadly to\nDES runtime prediction.",

Recently,\ncompositional visual reasoning approaches, which leverage the reasoning\nabilities of large language models (LLMs) with integrated tools to solve\nproblems, have shown promise as more effective strategies than end-to-end VR\nmethods. However, these approaches face limitations, as frozen LLMs lack tool\nawareness in VR, leading to performance bottlenecks. While leveraging LLMs for\nreasoning is widely used in other domains, they are not directly applicable to\nVR due to limited training data, imperfect tools that introduce errors and\nreduce data collection efficiency in VR, and challenging in fine-tuning on\nnoisy workflows. To address these challenges, we propose DWIM: i)\nDiscrepancy-aware training Workflow generation, which assesses tool usage and\nextracts more viable workflows for training; and ii) Instruct-Masking\nfine-tuning, which guides the model to only clone effective actions, enabling\nthe generation of more practical solutions.

A general joint latent\nclass model with heterogeneous random-effects modelling is a natural extension\nof the time-varying JLCM, which consists of the linear and the log link\nfunctions to model the covariance matrices as the variance-covariance\nregression submodel based on the modified Cholesky decomposition, longitudinal\nsubmodel, survival submodel as well as the membership probability.

By adding the regression model, the homogeneous\nrandom effects assumption can be tested and the issue of high-dimensional\nheterogeneous random effects can be easily solved. The Bayesian approach will\nbe used to estimate the data. DIC value is the criterion for deciding the\noptimal k value.

    "abstract": "In contrast to monolithic devices, modular, networked quantum architectures\nare based on interconnecting smaller quantum hardware nodes using quantum\ncommunication links, and offer a promising approach to scalability. Virtual\ndistillation (VD) is a technique that can, under ideal conditions, suppress\nerrors exponentially as the number of quantum state copies increases. However,\nadditional gate operations required for VD introduce further errors, which may\nlimit its practical effectiveness. In this work, we analyse three practical\nimplementations of VD that correspond to edge cases that maximise space-time\ntradeoffs. Specifically, we consider an implementation that minimises the\nnumber of qubits but introduces significantly deeper quantum circuits, and\ncontrast it with implementations that parallelise the preparation of copies\nusing additional qubits, including a constant-depth implementation. We\nrigorously characterise their circuit depth and gate count requirements, and\ndevelop explicit architectures for implementing them in networked quantum\nsystems -- while also detailing implementations in early fault-tolerant quantum\narchitectures. We numerically compare the performance of the three\nimplementations under realistic noise characteristics of networked ion trap\nsystems and conclude the following. Firstly, VD effectively suppresses errors\neven for very noisy states. Secondly, the constant-depth implementation\nconsistently outperforms the implementation that minimises the number of\nqubits. Finally, the approach is highly robust to errors in remote entangling\noperations, with noise in local gates being the main limiting factor to its\nperformance.",

In this work, we extend the well-established differential\nalgebra framework for structural identifiability analysis to linear and a class\nof near-linear, two-dimensional, partially observed stochastic differential\nequation (SDE) models. Our framework is based on a deterministic recurrence\nrelation that describes the dynamics of the statistical moments of the system\nof SDEs.

    "abstract": "Silicon-based integrated photonics has demonstrated significant advances in\nminiaturization and performance, yet critical challenges remain in achieving\nefficient on-chip communication at high bandwidths. Plasmonic devices on\nsilicon and silicon-on-insulator substrates offer a promising solution,\nenabling subwavelength light confinement and enhanced light-matter interactions\nthrough hybrid modes. However, integrating traditional plasmonic materials like\ngold and silver into silicon-based platforms presents significant challenges,\nparticularly due to their incompatibility with standard silicon processing\ntechniques and their increased optical losses at longer wavelengths, which can\nhinder performance in near-infrared applications. Plasmonic devices, leveraging\nadvances in device architectures, have the potential to close these performance\ngaps and enable the next generation of high-speed, on-chip data communication.\nThis review explores recent progress in silicon-integrated hybrid-mode\nplasmonic devices, highlighting the potential of transparent conductive oxides\nlike indium tin oxide for low-loss and tunable operation. Key device topologies\nincluding coupled hybrid plasmonic waveguides and dielectric-based\nheterostructures are examined, along with fabrication techniques and practical\nconsiderations. By critically comparing various plasmonic approaches and\nidentifying their respective advantages and limitations, a path toward\nrealizing the full potential of plasmonics in shaping the future of\nhigh-performance, silicon-based integrated photonics is charted.",
