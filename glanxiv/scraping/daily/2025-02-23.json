This research introduces an\ninnovative approach for non-destructive evaluation using micro-CT imaging,\nMicro-Computed Tomography, combined with machine vision and deep learning\ntechniques, specifically focusing on automated keypoint estimation to assess\njoint quality. Recognizing the scarcity of real micro-CT data, this study\nutilizes synthetic data for initial model training, followed by transfer\nlearning to adapt the model for real-world conditions. A UNet-based\narchitecture is employed to localize three keypoints with precision, enabling\nthe measurement of critical parameters such as head height, interlock, and\nbottom layer thickness. Extensive validation demonstrates that pre-training on\nsynthetic data, complemented by fine-tuning with limited real data, bridges\ndomain gaps and enhances predictive accuracy. The proposed framework not only\noffers a scalable and cost-efficient solution for evaluating SPR joints but\nalso establishes a foundation for broader applications of machine vision and\nnon-destructive testing in manufacturing processes.

Self-supervised approaches are particularly\npopular as they avoid the pitfall of distributional shift that affects\nsupervised methods. However, it is unknown how such methods behave if similar\nsignals can result from multiple tissue properties, a common challenge known as\nmodel degeneracy. Understanding this is crucial for ascertaining the scope\nwithin which self-supervised approaches may be applied. To this end, this work\nmakes two contributions.

Second, we propose a mitigation strategy based on\napplying appropriate constraining transforms on the output of the bottleneck\nlayer of the autoencoder network typically employed in self-supervised\napproaches. We illustrate both contributions using the estimation of proton\ndensity fat fraction and $R_2^*$ from chemical shift-encoded MRI, an ideal\nexemplar due to its exhibition of degeneracy across the full parameter space.\nThe results from both simulation and $\\textit{in vivo}$ experiments demonstrate\nthat the proposed strategy helps resolve model degeneracy.",

By integrating a separation oracle with adaptive Online Gradient\nDescent (OGD) and employing a Lyapunov-driven surrogate function, while\ndynamically adjusting step sizes using gradient norms, our method jointly\noptimizes the regret and cumulative constraint violation (CCV). We also use a\nblocked version of OGD that helps achieve tradeoffs betweeen the regret and CCV\nwith the number of calls to the separation oracle. For convex cost functions,\nour algorithm attains an optimal regret of $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{T})$ and a CCV of\n$\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{T} \\log T)$, matching the best-known projection-based\nresults, while only using $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}({T})$ calls to the separation\noracle. The results also demonstrate a tradeoff where lower calls to the\nseparation oracle increase the regret and the CCV. In the strongly convex\nsetting, we further achieve a regret of $\\mathcal{O}(\\log T)$ and a CCV of\n$\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{T\\log T} )$, while requiring ${\\mathcal{O}}({T}^2)$ calls to\nthe separation oracle.

Consequently, it makes them a lucrative target for breach and abuse as\nthey often serve as centralized hubs for diverse types of sensitive data, from\nacademic records to health information. Existing studies looked into how\nexisting stakeholders perceive the security and privacy risks of educational\ntechnologies and how those risks are affecting institutional policies for\nacquiring new technologies. However, outside of institutional vetting and\napproval, there is a pervasive practice of using applications and devices\nacquired personally. It is unclear how these applications and devices affect\nthe dynamics of the overall institutional ecosystem.\n  This study aims to address this gap by understanding why instructors use\nunsanctioned applications, how instructors perceive the associated risks, and\nhow it affects institutional security and privacy postures. We designed and\nconducted an online survey-based study targeting instructors and administrators\nfrom K-12 and higher education institutions.",

However, guidance signals can\nbe noisy due to domain shifts and limited data availability and may not\ngeneralize well.

To\naddress these challenges, we propose $\\underline{Ada}$ptive\n$\\underline{Con}$formal $\\underline{G}$uidance (AdaConG), a universal,\nplug-and-play framework that dynamically modulates the influence of guidance\nsignals based on their associated uncertainty, quantified via split conformal\nprediction (CP). By adaptively adjusting to guidance uncertainty, AdaConG\nenables models to reduce reliance on potentially misleading signals and enhance\nlearning performance. We validate AdaConG across diverse domains and tasks,\nincluding knowledge distillation, semi-supervised image classification,\ngridworld navigation, and autonomous driving. Experimental results demonstrate\nthat AdaConG improves performance and robustness under imperfect guidance,\ne.g., in gridworld navigation, it accelerates convergence and achieves over\n$6\\times$ higher rewards than the best-performing baseline.

Recent\nresearch highlights the challenges of achieving state-adversarial robustness\nand suggests that an optimal robust policy (ORP) does not always exist,\ncomplicating the enforcement of strict robustness constraints. In this paper,\nwe further explore the concept of ORP. We first introduce the Intrinsic\nState-adversarial Markov Decision Process (ISA-MDP), a novel formulation where\nadversaries cannot fundamentally alter the intrinsic nature of state\nobservations. ISA-MDP, supported by empirical and theoretical evidence,\nuniversally characterizes decision-making under state-adversarial paradigms. We\nrigorously prove that within ISA-MDP, a deterministic and stationary ORP\nexists, aligning with the Bellman optimal policy. Our findings theoretically\nreveal that improving DRL robustness does not necessarily compromise\nperformance in natural environments. Furthermore, we demonstrate the necessity\nof infinity measurement error (IME) in both $Q$-function and probability spaces\nto achieve ORP, unveiling vulnerabilities of previous DRL algorithms that rely\non $1$-measurement errors. Motivated by these insights, we develop the\nConsistent Adversarial Robust Reinforcement Learning (CAR-RL) framework, which\noptimizes surrogates of IME. We apply CAR-RL to both value-based and\npolicy-based DRL algorithms, achieving superior performance and validating our\ntheoretical analysis.",

Our work addresses these challenges by\nproposing a score that computes a sample's difficulty using\nhuman-understandable textual attributes (concepts) independent of any\ndownstream model. Specifically, we measure the alignment between a sample's\nvisual features and concept bottlenecks, derived via large language models, by\ntraining a linear concept bottleneck layer and computing the sample's\ndifficulty score using it.We then use stratified sampling based on this score\nto generate a coreset of the dataset.Crucially, our score is efficiently\ncomputable without training the downstream model on the full dataset even once,\nleads to high-performing coresets for various downstream models, and is\ncomputable even for an unlabeled dataset.

We complement our main result by studying the\ncomplexity of MinHLT and related problems in several other settings. First, we\nshow that it remains NP-complete on chordal graphs, and give an FPT-algorithm\non chordal graphs for the dual problem, asking for a DFS tree of height at most\n$n-k$, parameterized by $k$. The parameterized complexity of Dual MinHLT on\ngeneral graphs is wide open.

    "abstract": "Fine-tuning pre-trained transformers is a powerful technique for enhancing\nthe performance of base models on specific tasks. From early applications in\nmodels like BERT to fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs), this approach has\nbeen instrumental in adapting general-purpose architectures for specialized\ndownstream tasks. Understanding the fine-tuning process is crucial for\nuncovering how transformers adapt to specific objectives, retain general\nrepresentations, and acquire task-specific features. This paper explores the\nunderlying mechanisms of fine-tuning, specifically in the BERT transformer, by\nanalyzing activation similarity, training Sparse AutoEncoders (SAEs), and\nvisualizing token-level activations across different layers. Based on\nexperiments conducted across multiple datasets and BERT layers, we observe a\nsteady progression in how features adapt to the task at hand: early layers\nprimarily retain general representations, middle layers act as a transition\nbetween general and task-specific features, and later layers fully specialize\nin task adaptation. These findings provide key insights into the inner workings\nof fine-tuning and its impact on representation learning within transformer\narchitectures.",

    "abstract": "In astrochemical exploration, infrared (IR) spectroscopy is vital for\nunderstanding the composition and structure of ice in various space\nenvironments. This article explores the impact of incident angles on IR\nspectroscopy, focusing on molecular components present in interstellar and\ncircumstellar ice mantles such as CO, CO$_2$, H$_2$O, CH$_3$OH, NH$_3$, CH$_4$,\nH$_2$S. The experiment involves changing the angle at which the infrared beam\nhits the surface used for ice deposition. It is important to measure the\ndensity of the ice layer accurately, especially for experiments that involve\nusing different angles in infrared spectroscopy. Furthermore, the experimental\nmethodology allowed us to derive the {\\it effective} refraction index values in\nthe infrared range for each ice component. Existing corrections typically\nconsider geometric configurations but overlook the refractive index of the ice\n($n$), a factor dependent on ice composition. The study reveals that the\nincident angle and the refractive index, determine the pathlength of the IR\nbeam across the ice sample. This insight challenges conventional corrections,\nimpacting the integrated absorption values of the IR bands and column\ndensities. In addition, for certain ice components, variations in the incidence\nangle affect the longitudinal (LO) and transverse (TO) optical modes of the\nice, leading to observable changes in the IR band profiles that provide\ninformation on the amorphous or crystalline structure of the ice. The practical\nimplications of this work apply to experimental setups where normal IR\nmeasurements are unfeasible. Researchers using, for example, the standard\n45$^{\\circ}$ angle for IR spectroscopy, will benefit from a more accurate\nestimation of ice column density.",

    "abstract": "Recent research on instant runoff voting (IRV) shows that it exhibits a\nstriking combinatorial property in one-dimensional preference spaces: there is\nan \"exclusion zone\" around the median voter such that if a candidate from the\nexclusion zone is on the ballot, then the winner must come from the exclusion\nzone. Thus, in one dimension, IRV cannot elect an extreme candidate as long as\na sufficiently moderate candidate is running. In this work, we examine the\nmathematical structure of exclusion zones as a broad phenomenon in more general\npreference spaces. We prove that with voters uniformly distributed over any\n$d$-dimensional hyperrectangle (for $d > 1$), IRV has no nontrivial exclusion\nzone. However, we also show that IRV exclusion zones are not solely a\none-dimensional phenomenon. For irregular higher-dimensional preference spaces\nwith fewer symmetries than hyperrectangles, IRV can exhibit nontrivial\nexclusion zones. As a further exploration, we study IRV exclusion zones in\ngraph voting, where nodes represent voters who prefer candidates closer to them\nin the graph. Here, we show that IRV exclusion zones present a surprising\ncomputational challenge: even checking whether a given set of positions is an\nIRV exclusion zone is NP-hard. We develop an efficient randomized approximation\nalgorithm for checking and finding exclusion zones. We also report on\ncomputational experiments with exclusion zones in two directions: (i) applying\nour approximation algorithm to a collection of real-world school friendship\nnetworks, we find that about 60% of these networks have probable nontrivial IRV\nexclusion zones; and (ii) performing an exhaustive computer search of small\ngraphs and trees, we also find nontrivial IRV exclusion zones in most graphs.\nWhile our focus is on IRV, the properties of exclusion zones we establish\nprovide a novel method for analyzing voting systems in metric spaces more\ngenerally.",

    "abstract": "Background and Purpose: Functional assessment of the left ventricle using\ngated myocardial perfusion (MPS) single-photon emission computed tomography\nrelies on the precise extraction of the left ventricular contours while\nsimultaneously ensuring the security of patient data. Methods: In this paper,\nwe introduce the integration of Federated Domain Adaptation with TimeSformer,\nnamed 'FedDA-TSformer' for left ventricle segmentation using MPS.\nFedDA-TSformer captures spatial and temporal features in gated MPS images,\nleveraging spatial attention, temporal attention, and federated learning for\nimproved domain adaptation while ensuring patient data security. In detail, we\nemployed Divide-Space-Time-Attention mechanism to extract spatio-temporal\ncorrelations from the multi-centered MPS datasets, ensuring that predictions\nare spatio-temporally consistent. To achieve domain adaptation, we align the\nmodel output on MPS from three different centers using local maximum mean\ndiscrepancy (LMMD) loss. This approach effectively addresses the dual\nrequirements of federated learning and domain adaptation, enhancing the model's\nperformance during training with multi-site datasets while ensuring the\nprotection of data from different hospitals. Results: Our FedDA-TSformer was\ntrained and evaluated using MPS datasets collected from three hospitals,\ncomprising a total of 150 subjects. Each subject's cardiac cycle was divided\ninto eight gates. The model achieved Dice Similarity Coefficients (DSC) of\n0.842 and 0.907 for left ventricular (LV) endocardium and epicardium\nsegmentation, respectively. Conclusion: Our proposed FedDA-TSformer model\naddresses the challenge of multi-center generalization, ensures patient data\nprivacy protection, and demonstrates effectiveness in left ventricular (LV)\nsegmentation.",

This question is of fundamental interest, as smaller datasets reduce\nlabeling costs, storage requirements, and computational resources needed for\ntraining. Selecting an effective subset is challenging: a poorly chosen\nsubsample can severely degrade model performance, and empirically testing\nmultiple subsets for quality obviates the benefits of subsampling. Therefore,\nit is critical that subsampling comes with guarantees on model performance. In\nthis work, we introduce new subsampling methods for graph datasets that\nleverage the Tree Mover's Distance to reduce both the number of graphs and the\nsize of individual graphs. To our knowledge, our approach is the first that is\nsupported by rigorous theoretical guarantees: we prove that training a GNN on\nthe subsampled data results in a bounded increase in loss compared to training\non the full dataset. Unlike existing methods, our approach is both\nmodel-agnostic, requiring minimal assumptions about the GNN architecture, and\nlabel-agnostic, eliminating the need to label the full training set. This\nenables subsampling early in the model development pipeline (before data\nannotation, model selection, and hyperparameter tuning) reducing costs and\nresources needed for storage, labeling, and training.

    "abstract": "Interpretability is crucial to enhance trust in machine learning models for\nmedical diagnostics. However, most state-of-the-art image classifiers based on\nneural networks are not interpretable. As a result, clinicians often resort to\nknown biomarkers for diagnosis, although biomarker-based classification\ntypically performs worse than large neural networks. This work proposes a\nmethod that surpasses the performance of established machine learning models\nwhile simultaneously improving prediction interpretability for diabetic\nretinopathy staging from optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA)\nimages. Our method is based on a novel biology-informed heterogeneous graph\nrepresentation that models retinal vessel segments, intercapillary areas, and\nthe foveal avascular zone (FAZ) in a human-interpretable way. This graph\nrepresentation allows us to frame diabetic retinopathy staging as a graph-level\nclassification task, which we solve using an efficient graph neural network. We\nbenchmark our method against well-established baselines, including classical\nbiomarker-based classifiers, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and vision\ntransformers. Our model outperforms all baselines on two datasets. Crucially,\nwe use our biology-informed graph to provide explanations of unprecedented\ndetail. Our approach surpasses existing methods in precisely localizing and\nidentifying critical vessels or intercapillary areas. In addition, we give\ninformative and human-interpretable attributions to critical characteristics.\nOur work contributes to the development of clinical decision-support tools in\nophthalmology.",

The primary goal is to\ntransform high-resolution or high-dimensional data into an interpretable format\nto generate actionable insights, aiding decision-making and advancing\nknowledge. Currently, this task relies on complex, human-designed workflows\ncomprising iterative steps such as denoising, spatial sampling, keypoint\ndetection, feature generation, clustering, dimensionality reduction, and\nphysics-based deconvolutions. The introduction of machine learning over the\npast decade has accelerated tasks like image segmentation and object detection\nvia supervised learning, and dimensionality reduction via unsupervised methods.\nHowever, both classical and NN-based approaches still require human input,\nwhether for hyperparameter tuning, data labeling, or both. The growing use of\nautomated imaging tools, from atomically resolved imaging to biological\napplications, demands unsupervised methods that optimize data representation\nfor human decision-making or autonomous experimentation.

This\nstudy proposes a multimodal bearing fault classification approach that relies\non vibration and motor phase current signals within a one-dimensional\nconvolutional neural network (1D CNN) framework. The method fuses features from\nmultiple signals to enhance the accuracy of fault detection. Under the baseline\ncondition (1,500 rpm, 0.7 Nm load torque, and 1,000 N radial force), the model\nreaches an accuracy of 96% with addition of L2 regularization. This represents\na notable improvement of 2% compared to the non-regularized model. In addition,\nthe model demonstrates robust performance across three distinct operating\nconditions by employing transfer learning (TL) strategies. Among the tested TL\nvariants, the approach that preserves parameters up to the first max-pool layer\nand then adjusts subsequent layers achieves the highest performance. While this\napproach attains excellent accuracy across varied conditions, it requires more\ncomputational time due to its greater number of trainable parameters. To\naddress resource constraints, less computationally intensive models offer\nfeasible trade-offs, albeit at a slight accuracy cost.

    "abstract": "Can we improve machine translation (MT) with LLMs by rewriting their inputs\nautomatically? Users commonly rely on the intuition that well-written text is\neasier to translate when using off-the-shelf MT systems. LLMs can rewrite text\nin many ways but in the context of MT, these capabilities have been primarily\nexploited to rewrite outputs via post-editing. We present an empirical study of\n21 input rewriting methods with 3 open-weight LLMs for translating from English\ninto 6 target languages. We show that text simplification is the most effective\nMT-agnostic rewrite strategy and that it can be improved further when using\nquality estimation to assess translatability. Human evaluation further confirms\nthat simplified rewrites and their MT outputs both largely preserve the\noriginal meaning of the source and MT.

However, there is a lack\nof evidence regarding the validity of their interpretations due to the lack of\na ground truth for the concepts used by an LLM, and a growing number of works\nhave presented problems with current SAEs. One alternative source of evidence\nwould be demonstrating that SAEs improve performance on downstream tasks beyond\nexisting baselines. We test this by applying SAEs to the real-world task of LLM\nactivation probing in four regimes: data scarcity, class imbalance, label\nnoise, and covariate shift. Due to the difficulty of detecting concepts in\nthese challenging settings, we hypothesize that SAEs' basis of interpretable,\nconcept-level latents should provide a useful inductive bias. However, although\nSAEs occasionally perform better than baselines on individual datasets, we are\nunable to design ensemble methods combining SAEs with baselines that\nconsistently outperform ensemble methods solely using baselines. Additionally,\nalthough SAEs initially appear promising for identifying spurious correlations,\ndetecting poor dataset quality, and training multi-token probes, we are able to\nachieve similar results with simple non-SAE baselines as well. Though we cannot\ndiscount SAEs' utility on other tasks, our findings highlight the shortcomings\nof current SAEs and the need to rigorously evaluate interpretability methods on\ndownstream tasks with strong baselines.",

Fluid flow and transport in fractured\nporous media are critical in subsurface hydrology, geophysics, and reservoir\ngeomechanics. Reduced fracture models, which represent fractures as\nlower-dimensional interfaces, enable efficient multi-scale simulations.\nHowever, reduced fracture models also face accuracy challenges due to modeling\nerrors and uncertainties in physical parameters such as permeability and\nfracture geometry. To address these challenges, we propose a United Filter\nmethod, which integrates the Ensemble Score Filter (EnSF) for state estimation\nwith the Direct Filter for parameter estimation. EnSF, based on a score-based\ndiffusion model framework, produces ensemble representations of the state\ndistribution without deep learning. Meanwhile, the Direct Filter, a recursive\nBayesian inference method, estimates parameters directly from state\nobservations. The United Filter combines these methods iteratively: EnSF\nestimates are used to refine parameter values, which are then fed back to\nimprove state estimation. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the United\nFilter method surpasses the state-of-the-art Augmented Ensemble Kalman Filter,\ndelivering more accurate state and parameter estimation for reduced fracture\nmodels. This framework also provides a robust and efficient solution for\nPDE-constrained inverse problems with uncertainties and sparse observations.",

    "abstract": "In Bangladesh, tomatoes are a staple vegetable, prized for their versatility\nin various culinary applications. However, the cultivation of tomatoes is often\nhindered by a range of diseases that can significantly reduce crop yields and\nquality. Early detection of these diseases is crucial for implementing timely\ninterventions and ensuring the sustainability of tomato production. Traditional\nmanual inspection methods, while effective, are labor-intensive and prone to\nhuman error. To address these challenges, this research paper sought to develop\nan automated disease detection system using Convolutional Neural Networks\n(CNNs). A comprehensive dataset of tomato leaves was collected from the\nBrahmanbaria district, preprocessed to enhance image quality, and then applied\nto various deep learning models. Comparative performance analysis was conducted\nbetween YOLOv5, MobileNetV2, ResNet18, and our custom CNN model. In our study,\nthe Custom CNN model achieved an impressive accuracy of 95.2%, significantly\noutperforming the other models, which achieved an accuracy of 77%, 89.38% and\n71.88% respectively. While other models showed solid performance, our Custom\nCNN demonstrated superior results specifically tailored for the task of tomato\nleaf disease detection. These findings highlight the strong potential of deep\nlearning techniques for improving early disease detection in tomato crops. By\nleveraging these advanced technologies, farmers can gain valuable insights to\ndetect diseases at an early stage, allowing for more effective management\npractices.

The present work continues with and\ncontributes to this research with a replication-motivated large-scale analysis\nof software written in the PHP programming language. The dataset examined\ncontains nearly four hundred thousand open source software packages written in\nPHP. According to the results based on reported security vulnerabilities, the\nhypothesis does holds; packages having been affected by vulnerabilities over\ntheir release histories are generally more popular than packages without having\nbeen affected by a single vulnerability. With this replication results, the\npaper contributes to the efforts to strengthen the empirical knowledge base in\ncyber and software security.",

This paper\ninvestigates the holographic multiple-input multiple-output (HMIMO)-aided\nmulti-cell systems with practical per-radio frequency (RF) chain power\nconstraints. With multiple antennas at both base stations (BSs) and users, we\ndesign the baseband digital precoder and the tuning response of HMIMO\nmetamaterial elements to maximize the weighted sum user rate. Specifically,\nunder the framework of block coordinate descent (BCD) and weighted minimum mean\nsquare error (WMMSE) techniques, we derive the low-complexity closed-form\nsolution for baseband precoder without requiring bisection search and matrix\ninversion. Then, for the design of HMIMO metamaterial elements under binary\ntuning constraints, we first propose a low-complexity suboptimal algorithm with\nclosed-form solutions by exploiting the hidden convexity (HC) in the quadratic\nproblem and then further propose an accelerated sphere decoding (SD)-based\nalgorithm which yields global optimal solution in the iteration. For HMIMO\nmetamaterial element design under the Lorentzian-constrained phase model, we\npropose a maximization-minorization (MM) algorithm with closed-form solutions\nat each iteration step. Furthermore, in a simplified multiple-input\nsingle-output (MISO) scenario, we derive the scaling law of downlink\nsingle-to-noise (SNR) for HMIMO with binary and Lorentzian tuning constraints\nand theoretically compare it with conventional fully digital/hybrid arrays.\nSimulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms compared to\nbenchmarks and the benefits of HMIMO compared to conventional arrays.",

These observations\nspan a broad frequency range of ~300 to 3100 MHz, encompassing the P-, L-, and\nS-bands, and covered heliocentric distances from ~5 to 200 solar radii. The\ndynamic spectrum of the scintillations obtained at L-band shows a systematic\ndecrease in the scintillation index from the lowest to the highest frequency,\noffering valuable insight into the influence of the solar wind density\nmicrostructures responsible for scintillation. Analyses of the scintillation\nindex ($m$) for multiple sources at L-band, along with near-simultaneous\nobservations of selected sources covering the P-, L-, and S-bands, clearly\ndemonstrate a wavelength dependence of $m \\propto \\lambda^\\omega$, which\ninherently leads to a dependence of $m$ on the Fresnel scale, when considering\nthe effective distance to the scattering screen, $z$. The index $\\omega$ ranges\nbetween $\\sim$1 and 1.8. The average $\\omega$ value of a source, determined\nfrom observations made on different days, exhibits variability across sources.\nThe results on the radial dependence of scintillation agree with earlier IPS\nmeasurements. The temporal power spectra obtained over the wide frequency range\nexhibit a power-level evolution in accordance with the wavelength dependence,\nand a broadening with increasing observation frequency. Furthermore, the\nincreased temporal-frequency rounding of the `Fresnel knee' in the spectrum\nwith the observing frequency suggests a novel phenomenon: an increase in\nanisotropy as the scale size of the density-turbulence structure decreases.",

    "abstract": "Serious games can teach essential coding and testing concepts even to younger\naudiences. In the Code Critter game critters execute short snippets of\nblock-based code while traversing the game map, and players position magical\nportals (akin to test oracles) at locations (akin to test inputs) to\ndistinguish between critters executing correct code from those who execute\nfaulty code. However, this adaptation of the tower defense genre limits code\nunder test to basic sequences and branches, and excludes the fundamental\nprogramming concept of loops. To address this limitation, in this paper we\nintroduce an entirely new game concept integrated into the Code Critters\nstoryline, tasking players to test the behavior of critters collecting\ningredients for a healing potion using loop-based recipes at a second-stage\nlevel.

Unlike the many related studies that share the same homogeneous\nparadigms, VPNeXt offers a fresh perspective on dense representation based on\nViT. In more detail, the proposed VPNeXt addressed two concerns about the\nexisting paradigm: (1) Is it necessary to use a complex Transformer Mask\nDecoder architecture to obtain good representations? (2) Does the Plain ViT\nreally need to depend on the mock pyramid feature for upsampling? For (1), we\ninvestigated the potential underlying reasons that contributed to the\neffectiveness of the Transformer Decoder and introduced the Visual Context\nReplay (VCR) to achieve similar effects efficiently. For (2), we introduced the\nViTUp module. This module fully utilizes the previously overlooked ViT real\npyramid feature to achieve better upsampling results compared to the earlier\nmock pyramid feature. This represents the first instance of such functionality\nin the field of semantic segmentation for Plain ViT. We performed ablation\nstudies on related modules to verify their effectiveness gradually. We\nconducted relevant comparative experiments and visualizations to show that\nVPNeXt achieved state-of-the-art performance with a simple and effective\ndesign.

The spin-charge\nscreening cloud exhibits scaling behavior analogous to that of traditional\nKondo systems, though the sub-leading even-odd effect is subtly modified by the\nboundary conditions. These findings enhance our understanding of Kondo physics\nand resolve key debates on quantum dot nanostructures with Majorana zero modes.",

Restricting ourselves to periodic configurations\nof particles, two possibilities are considered: an equidistant chain of\nparticles with the uniform spacing $A=1/\\rho$ and its simplest non-Bravais\nmodulation, namely a bipartite lattice composed of two equidistant chains,\nshifted with respect to one another. Assuming the long range of the interaction\npotential, the equidistant chain dominates if $A$ is small enough, $0<A<A_c$.\nAt a critical value of $A=A_c$, the system undergoes a continuous second-order\nphase transition from the equidistant chain to a bipartite lattice. The energy\nand the order parameter are singular functions of the deviation from the\ncritical point $A-A_c$ with universal (i.e., independent of the model's\nparameters) mean-field values of critical exponents. The tricritical point at\nwhich the curve of continuous second-order transitions meets with the one of\ndiscontinuous first-order transitions is determined. The general theory is\napplied to the Lennard-Jones model with the $(n,m)$ Mie potential for which the\nphase diagram is constructed.

However, modeling precise\ncausal structures in high-dimensional data, such as videos, remains\nchallenging. Additionally, direct causal edges may not exist among observed\nvariables (e.g., pixels). These limitations hinder the applicability of\nexisting approaches to real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we\nfind that the high-dimension time series data are generated from the\nlow-dimension latent variables, which motivates us to model the causal\nmechanisms of the temporal latent process. Based on this intuition, we propose\na latent causal mechanism identification framework that guarantees the\nuniqueness of the reconstructed latent causal structures. Specifically, we\nfirst identify latent variables by utilizing sufficient changes in historical\ninformation. Moreover, by enforcing the sparsity of the relationships of latent\nvariables, we can achieve identifiable latent causal structures. Built on the\ntheoretical results, we develop the Latent Causality Alignment (LCA) model that\nleverages variational inference, which incorporates an intra-domain latent\nsparsity constraint for latent structure reconstruction and an inter-domain\nlatent sparsity constraint for domain-invariant structure reconstruction.\nExperiment results on eight benchmarks show a general improvement in the\ndomain-adaptive time series classification and forecasting tasks, highlighting\nthe effectiveness of our method in real-world scenarios.

We also show\nthat our model can reproduce the waiting time distribution of a pulsar phase of\nthe galactic magnetar SGR J1935+2154 with a larger inclination angle than the\nhyper-active repeaters, which could explain the detection of spin period and\nthe relatively low observed energy for FRBs from the magnetar. The spin periods\nof hyper-active repeaters are not well constrained, but most likely fall in the\nvalley region between the two peaks of the waiting time distributions.",

In the weak coupling case (larger value of\ncoupling parameter $\\alpha$) with an initial scalar field $\\psi_0$, the images\non the screen predominantly show direct and lensed images, where $\\psi_0$ and\n$\\alpha$ modulate the image region size while the observation inclination\n$\\theta$ controls morphological asymmetry.

We also\nanalyze how the effective potential and redshift factor depend on the\ncorrelation parameter.

This problem is NP-hard (even\n$\\exists\\mathbb{R}$-complete [Schaefer, 2010]) in the general case\n[Kratochv\\'il & Ne\\^setril, 1992] and remains so if we restrict the segments to\nbe axis-aligned, i.e., horizontal and vertical [Kratochv\\'il, 1994]. A long\nstanding open question for the latter variant is its complexity when the order\nof segments along one axis (say the vertical order of horizontal segments) is\nalready given [Kratochv\\'il & Ne\\^setril, 1992; Kratochv\\'il, 1994].\n  We resolve this question by giving efficient solutions using two very\ndifferent approaches that are interesting on their own. First, using a\ngraph-drawing perspective, we relate the problem to a variant of the well-known\nLevel Planarity problem, where vertices have to lie on pre-assigned horizontal\nlevels. In our case, each level also carries consecutivity constraints on its\nvertices; this Level Planarity variant is known to have a quadratic solution.\n  Second, we use an entirely combinatorial approach, and show that both\nproblems can equivalently be formulated as a linear ordering problem subject to\ncertain consecutivity constraints. While the complexity of such problems varies\ngreatly, we show that in this case the constraints are well-structured in a way\nthat allows a direct quadratic solution.

This progress has sparked interest in\ntheir potential use for tutoring students in mathematics. However, the\nreliability of LLMs in tutoring contexts -- where correctness and instructional\nquality are crucial -- remains underexplored. Moreover, LLM problem-solving\ncapabilities may not necessarily translate into effective tutoring support for\nstudents. In this work, we present two novel approaches to evaluate the\ncorrectness and quality of LLMs in math tutoring contexts. The first approach\nuses an intelligent tutoring system for college algebra as a testbed to assess\nLLM problem-solving capabilities. We generate benchmark problems using the\ntutor, prompt a diverse set of LLMs to solve them, and compare the solutions to\nthose generated by the tutor. The second approach evaluates LLM as tutors\nrather than problem solvers. We employ human evaluators, who act as students\nseeking tutoring support from each LLM. We then assess the quality and\ncorrectness of the support provided by the LLMs via a qualitative coding\nprocess. We applied these methods to evaluate several ChatGPT models, including\n3.5 Turbo, 4, 4o, o1-mini, and o1-preview. Our findings show that when used as\nproblem solvers, LLMs generate correct final answers for 85.5% of the college\nalgebra problems tested. When employed interactively as tutors, 90% of LLM\ndialogues show high-quality instructional support; however, many contain errors\n-- only 56.6% are entirely correct. We conclude that, despite their potential,\nLLMs are not yet suitable as intelligent tutors for math without human\noversight or additional mechanisms to ensure correctness and quality.",

    "abstract": "Target speaker extraction focuses on isolating a specific speaker's voice\nfrom an audio mixture containing multiple speakers. To provide information\nabout the target speaker's identity, prior works have utilized clean audio\nsamples as conditioning inputs. However, such clean audio examples are not\nalways readily available. For instance, obtaining a clean recording of a\nstranger's voice at a cocktail party without leaving the noisy environment is\ngenerally infeasible. Limited prior research has explored extracting the target\nspeaker's characteristics from noisy enrollments, which may contain overlapping\nspeech from interfering speakers. In this work, we explore a novel enrollment\nstrategy that encodes target speaker information from the noisy enrollment by\ncomparing segments where the target speaker is talking (Positive Enrollments)\nwith segments where the target speaker is silent (Negative Enrollments).\nExperiments show the effectiveness of our model architecture, which achieves\nover 2.1 dB higher SI-SNRi compared to prior works in extracting the monaural\nspeech from the mixture of two speakers. Additionally, the proposed two-stage\ntraining strategy accelerates convergence, reducing the number of optimization\nsteps required to reach 3 dB SNR by 60\\%.

Covariate shifts are subtle\nvariations in the data distribution caused by different imaging devices or\nsettings and can severely degrade model performance, similar to the effects of\nadversarial attacks. Therefore, it is vital to have a lightweight and fast\nmethod to assess the quality of these images prior to using CAD models.\nAdverX-Ray addresses this need by serving as an image-quality assessment layer,\ndesigned to detect covariate shifts effectively. This Adversarial Variational\nAutoencoder prioritizes the discriminator's role, using the suboptimal outputs\nof the generator as negative samples to fine-tune the discriminator's ability\nto identify high-frequency artifacts. Images generated by adversarial networks\noften exhibit severe high-frequency artifacts, guiding the discriminator to\nfocus excessively on these components. This makes the discriminator ideal for\nthis approach. Trained on patches from X-ray images of specific machine models,\nAdverX-Ray can evaluate whether a scan matches the training distribution, or if\na scan from the same machine is captured under different settings. Extensive\ncomparisons with various OOD detection methods show that AdverX-Ray\nsignificantly outperforms existing techniques, achieving a 96.2% average AUROC\nusing only 64 random patches from an X-ray.

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) emerges as a promising data-driven approach for\nadaptive traffic signal control (ATSC) in complex urban traffic networks, with\ndeep neural networks substantially augmenting its learning capabilities.\nHowever, centralized RL becomes impractical for ATSC involving multiple agents\ndue to the exceedingly high dimensionality of the joint action space.\nMulti-agent RL (MARL) mitigates this scalability issue by decentralizing\ncontrol to local RL agents. Nevertheless, this decentralized method introduces\nnew challenges: the environment becomes partially observable from the\nperspective of each local agent due to constrained inter-agent communication.\nBoth centralized RL and MARL exhibit distinct strengths and weaknesses,\nparticularly under heavy intersectional traffic conditions. In this paper, we\njustify that MARL can achieve the optimal global Q-value by separating into\nmultiple IRL (Independent Reinforcement Learning) processes when no spill-back\ncongestion occurs (no agent dependency) among agents (intersections). In the\npresence of spill-back congestion (with agent dependency), the maximum global\nQ-value can be achieved by using centralized RL. Building upon the conclusions,\nwe propose a novel Dynamic Parameter Update Strategy for Deep Q-Network\n(DQN-DPUS), which updates the weights and bias based on the dependency dynamics\namong agents, i.e. updating only the diagonal sub-matrices for the scenario\nwithout spill-back congestion. We validate the DQN-DPUS in a simple network\nwith two intersections under varying traffic, and show that the proposed\nstrategy can speed up the convergence rate without sacrificing optimal\nexploration. The results corroborate our theoretical findings, demonstrating\nthe efficacy of DQN-DPUS in optimizing traffic signal control.",

This method can produce both global and\nlocal features that focus on discriminative landmarks to recognize places for\ntwo-stage VPR by a parameter-efficient adaptation approach. Although SelaVPR\nhas achieved competitive results, we argue that the previous adaptation is\ninefficient in training time and GPU memory usage, and the re-ranking paradigm\nis also costly in retrieval latency and storage usage. In pursuit of higher\nefficiency and better performance, we propose an extension of the SelaVPR,\ncalled SelaVPR++. Concretely, we first design a parameter-, time-, and\nmemory-efficient adaptation method that uses lightweight multi-scale\nconvolution (MultiConv) adapters to refine intermediate features from the\nfrozen foundation backbone. This adaptation method does not back-propagate\ngradients through the backbone during training, and the MultiConv adapter\nfacilitates feature interactions along the spatial axes and introduces proper\nlocal priors, thus achieving higher efficiency and better performance.\nMoreover, we propose an innovative re-ranking paradigm for more efficient VPR.\nInstead of relying on local features for re-ranking, which incurs huge overhead\nin latency and storage, we employ compact binary features for initial retrieval\nand robust floating-point (global) features for re-ranking. To obtain such\nbinary features, we propose a similarity-constrained deep hashing method, which\ncan be easily integrated into the VPR pipeline.

    "abstract": "Monocular visual inertial odometry (VIO) has facilitated a wide range of\nreal-time motion tracking applications, thanks to the small size of the sensor\nsuite and low power consumption. To successfully bootstrap VIO algorithms, the\ninitialization module is extremely important. Most initialization methods rely\non the reconstruction of 3D visual point clouds. These methods suffer from high\ncomputational cost as state vector contains both motion states and 3D feature\npoints. To address this issue, some researchers recently proposed a\nstructureless initialization method, which can solve the initial state without\nrecovering 3D structure. However, this method potentially compromises\nperformance due to the decoupled estimation of rotation and translation, as\nwell as linear constraints. To improve its accuracy, we propose novel\nstructureless visual-inertial bundle adjustment to further refine previous\nstructureless solution. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show our\nmethod significantly improves the VIO initialization accuracy, while\nmaintaining real-time performance.",

In\nthis paper, a numerical investigation of the RM instability during the reshock\nprocess is conducted using the two-component discrete Boltzmann method. The\ninfluence of reflection distance on the RM instability, including both\nhydrodynamic and thermodynamic non-equilibrium effects, is explored in detail.\nThe interaction time between the reflected shock wave and the material\ninterface varies with different reflection distances. Larger reflection\ndistances lead to a longer evolution time of the material interface before\nreshock, resulting in more complex effects on the interface deformation, the\nmixing extent of the fluid system, and non-equilibrium behaviors after reshock.\nAdditionally, while the reflection distance has a minimal impact on mixing\nentropy before the secondary impact, a significant difference emerges after the\nsecondary impact. This suggests that the secondary impact enhances the\nevolution of the RM instability. Furthermore, non-equilibrium behaviors or\nquantities exhibit complex dynamics due to the influence of the transmitted\nshock wave, transverse waves, rarefaction waves, material interfaces, and\ndissipation/diffusion processes.",

    "abstract": "Accurately representing the complex linkages and inherent uncertainties\nincluded in huge datasets is still a major difficulty in the field of data\nclustering. We address these issues with our proposed Unified Neutrosophic\nClustering Algorithm (UNCA), which combines a multifaceted strategy with\nNeutrosophic logic to improve clustering performance. UNCA starts with a\nfull-fledged similarity examination via a {\\lambda}-cutting matrix that filters\nmeaningful relationships between each two points of data. Then, we initialize\ncentroids for Neutrosophic K-Means clustering, where the membership values are\nbased on their degrees of truth, indeterminacy and falsity. The algorithm then\nintegrates with a dynamic network visualization and MST (Minimum Spanning Tree)\nso that a visual interpretation of the relationships between the clusters can\nbe clearly represented. UNCA employs SingleValued Neutrosophic Sets (SVNSs) to\nrefine cluster assignments, and after fuzzifying similarity measures,\nguarantees a precise clustering result. The final step involves solidifying the\nclustering results through defuzzification methods, offering definitive cluster\nassignments. According to the performance evaluation results, UNCA outperforms\nconventional approaches in several metrics: it achieved a Silhouette Score of\n0.89 on the Iris Dataset, a Davies-Bouldin Index of 0.59 on the Wine Dataset,\nan Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) of 0.76 on the Digits Dataset, and a Normalized\nMutual Information (NMI) of 0.80 on the Customer Segmentation Dataset. These\nresults demonstrate how UNCA enhances interpretability and resilience in\naddition to improving clustering accuracy when contrasted with Fuzzy C-Means\n(FCM), Neutrosophic C-Means (NCM), as well as Kernel Neutrosophic C-Means\n(KNCM).

To defend against such\nattacks, recent studies have developed various detection mechanisms. If we\nrestrict ourselves specifically to works which perform detection rather than\ndirect defense, most of them focus on direct prompt injection attacks, while\nthere are few works for the indirect scenario, where injected instructions are\nindirectly from external tools, such as a search engine. Moreover, current\nworks mainly investigate injection detection methods and pay less attention to\nthe post-processing method that aims to mitigate the injection after detection.\nIn this paper, we investigate the feasibility of detecting and removing\nindirect prompt injection attacks, and we construct a benchmark dataset for\nevaluation. For detection, we assess the performance of existing LLMs and\nopen-source detection models, and we further train detection models using our\ncrafted training datasets. For removal, we evaluate two intuitive methods: (1)\nthe segmentation removal method, which segments the injected document and\nremoves parts containing injected instructions, and (2) the extraction removal\nmethod, which trains an extraction model to identify and remove injected\ninstructions.",

We introduce\nEntropy-Lens, a model-agnostic framework that extracts entropy profiles from\nfrozen, off-the-shelf transformers. We show that these profiles (i) reveal\nfamily-specific computation patterns invariant under depth rescaling, (ii) are\npredictive of prompt type and task format, and (iii) correlate with output\ncorrectness. We further show that R\\'enyi entropies yield similar results\nwithin a broad range of $\\alpha$ values, justifying the use of Shannon entropy\nas a stable and principled summary. Our results hold across different\ntransformers, without requiring gradients, fine-tuning, or access to model\ninternals.",

Consequently, studying vision-based\nunderwater robot navigation and control has recently gained increasing\nattention to counter the numerous challenges faced in underwater conditions,\nsuch as lighting variability, turbidity, camera image distortions (due to\nbubbles), and ROV positional disturbances (due to underwater currents). In this\npaper, we propose (to the best of our knowledge) a first rigorous unified\nbenchmarking of more than seven Machine Learning (ML)-based one-shot object\ntracking algorithms for vision-based position locking of ROV platforms. We\npropose a position-locking system that processes images of an object of\ninterest in front of which the ROV must be kept stable. Then, our proposed\nsystem uses the output result of different object tracking algorithms to\nautomatically correct the position of the ROV against external disturbances. We\nconducted numerous real-world experiments using a BlueROV2 platform within an\nindoor pool and provided clear demonstrations of the strengths and weaknesses\nof each tracking approach. Finally, to help alleviate the scarcity of\nunderwater ROV data, we release our acquired data base as open-source with the\nhope of benefiting future research.",

In this work, we explore a special\napproach to mass sensing, which is purely based on the classical nonlinear\ndynamics of cavity optomechanical systems. We consider two types of systems,\nthe mechanical resonator as a suspended membrane inside optical cavity or as a\nlarger movable membrane that separates the optical cavity into two parts. Under\na driving laser field with two tones satisfying a specific frequency condition,\nboth systems enter a special dynamical pattern correlating the mechanical\noscillation and the sidebands of oscillatory cavity field. After adding the\nnano-particle, which has its mass \\delta m to be measured, to the mechanical\nmembrane as the detector, the cavity field sidebands will exhibit detectable\nchanges, so that the tiny mass \\delta m can be deduced from the measured\nsideband intensities. For the latter system with a membrane in the middle, one\ncan apply an additional single-tone laser field to magnify the modified\nsidebands much further, achieving an ultra-high sensitivity (\\delta m/m) \\sim\n10^{-11} ($m$ is the mass of the membrane), even given a moderate mechanical\nquality factor. The operation range of the sensors is very wide, covering 7 or\n8 orders of magnitudes. Moreover, a particular advantage of this type of mass\nsensors comes from the robustness of the realized dynamical pattern against\nthermal noise, and it enables such mass sensors to work well at room\ntemperature.",

However,\nthese methods require careful design of the shape and position of trigger\npatches and lack the feature interactions between trigger patches during\ntraining, resulting in poor backdoor attack success rates. Moreover, the pixels\nof the patches remain untruncated, thereby making abrupt areas in backdoor\nexamples easily detectable by the detection algorithm. To this end, we propose\na novel benchmark for the federated backdoor attack based on feature\naggregation. Specifically, we align the dimensions of triggers with images,\ndelimit the trigger's pixel boundaries, and facilitate feature interaction\namong local triggers trained by each compromised client. Furthermore,\nleveraging the intra-class attack strategy, we propose the simultaneous\ngeneration of backdoor triggers for all target classes, significantly reducing\nthe overall production time for triggers across all target classes and\nincreasing the risk of the federated model being attacked. Experiments\ndemonstrate that our method can not only bypass the detection of defense\nmethods while patch-based methods fail, but also achieve a zero-shot backdoor\nattack with a success rate of 77.39%. To the best of our knowledge, our work is\nthe first to implement such a zero-shot attack in federated learning.

    "abstract": "Loss functions constructed by applying transformations to the realization and\nprediction variables of (strictly) consistent loss functions have been\nextensively studied empirically, yet their theoretical foundations remain\nunexplored. To address this gap, we establish formal characterizations of\n(strict) consistency for such transformed loss functions and their\ncorresponding elicitable functionals. Our analysis focuses on two interrelated\ncases: (a) transformations applied solely to the realization variable and (b)\nbijective transformations applied jointly to both the realization and\nprediction variables. These cases extend the well-established framework of\ntransformations applied exclusively to the prediction variable, as formalized\nby Osband's revelation principle. We further develop analogous\ncharacterizations for (strict) identification functions. The resulting\ntheoretical framework is broadly applicable to statistical and machine learning\nmethodologies. When applied to Bregman and expectile loss functions, our\nframework enables two key advancements: (a) the interpretation of empirical\nfindings from models trained with transformed loss functions and (b) the\nsystematic construction of novel identifiable and elicitable functionals,\nincluding the g-transformed expectation and g-transformed expectile. By\nunifying theoretical insights with practical applications, this work advances\nprincipled methodologies for designing loss functions in complex predictive\ntasks. Applications of the framework to simulated and real-world data\nillustrate its practical utility in diverse settings.",

    "abstract": "In electronic design, engineers often manually search through extensive\ndocuments to retrieve component parameters required for constructing SPICE\nmodels, a process that is both labor-intensive and time-consuming. To address\nthis challenge, we present an automated framework called D2S-FLOW that\nleverages large language models (LLMs) to extract electrical parameters from\ndatasheets and generate SPICE models with high precision and efficiency,\nsignificantly reducing the need for manual intervention. Unlike traditional RAG\nsystems, D2S-FLOW employs a workflow to enhance precision in handling\nunstructured documents and inconsistent naming conventions through three\ninnovative mechanisms: Attention-Guided Document Focusing (AGDF), Hierarchical\nDocument-Enhanced Retrieval (HDER), and Heterogeneous Named Entity\nNormalization (HNEN). AGDF narrows retrieval to user-selected documents, HDER\nutilizes document structure for precise parameter localization, and HNEN\nstandardizes terminology via semantic inference. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that the framework achieves an Exact Match (EM) of 0.86, an F1\nscore of 0.92, and an Exact Correctness (EC) of 0.96, outperforming the\nstrongest baseline by 19.4%, 5.7%, and 13.1%, respectively.

    "abstract": "This work describes the principled design of a theoretical framework leading\nto fast and accurate algorithmic information measures on finite multisets of\nfinite strings by means of compression. One distinctive feature of our approach\nis to manipulate {\\em reified}, explicit representations of the very entities\nand quantities of the theory itself: compressed strings, models,\nrate-distortion states, minimal sufficient models, joint and relative\ncomplexity. To do so, a programmable, recursive data structure called a {\\em\nparselet} essentially provides modeling of a string as a concatenation of\nparameterized instantiations from sets of finite strings that encode the\nregular part of the data. This supports another distinctive feature of this\nwork, which is the native embodiment of Epicurus' Principle on top of Occam's\nRazor, so as to produce both a most-significant and most-general explicit model\nfor the data. This model is iteratively evolved through the Principle of\nMinimal Change to reach the so-called minimal sufficient model of the data.\nParselets may also be used to compute a compression score to any arbitrary\nhypothesis about the data. A lossless, rate-distortion oriented, compressed\nrepresentation is proposed, that allows immediate reusability of the costly\ncomputations stored on disk for their fast merging as our core routine for\ninformation calculus. Two information measures are deduced: one is exact\nbecause it is purely combinatorial, and the other may occasionally incur slight\nnumerical inaccuracies because it is an approximation of the Kolmogorov\ncomplexity of the minimal sufficient model. Symmetry of information is enforced\nat the bit level. Whenever possible, parselets are compared with off-the-shelf\ncompressors on real data.

    "abstract": "Recent studies have highlighted the vulnerability of deep neural networks to\nbackdoor attacks, where models are manipulated to rely on embedded triggers\nwithin poisoned samples, despite the presence of both benign and trigger\ninformation. While several defense methods have been proposed, they often\nstruggle to balance backdoor mitigation with maintaining benign performance.In\nthis work, inspired by the concept of optical polarizer-which allows light\nwaves of specific polarizations to pass while filtering others-we propose a\nlightweight backdoor defense approach, NPD. This method integrates a neural\npolarizer (NP) as an intermediate layer within the compromised model,\nimplemented as a lightweight linear transformation optimized via bi-level\noptimization. The learnable NP filters trigger information from poisoned\nsamples while preserving benign content. Despite its effectiveness, we identify\nthrough empirical studies that NPD's performance degrades when the target\nlabels (required for purification) are inaccurately estimated. To address this\nlimitation while harnessing the potential of targeted adversarial mitigation,\nwe propose class-conditional neural polarizer-based defense (CNPD). The key\ninnovation is a fusion module that integrates the backdoored model's predicted\nlabel with the features to be purified. This architecture inherently mimics\ntargeted adversarial defense mechanisms without requiring label estimation used\nin NPD. We propose three implementations of CNPD: the first is r-CNPD, which\ntrains a replicated NP layer for each class and, during inference, selects the\nappropriate NP layer for defense based on the predicted class from the\nbackdoored model. To efficiently handle a large number of classes, two variants\nare designed: e-CNPD, which embeds class information as additional features,\nand a-CNPD, which directs network attention using class information.",

    "abstract": "Large dynamic economies with heterogeneous agents and aggregate shocks are\ncentral to many important applications, yet their equilibrium analysis remains\ncomputationally challenging. This is because the standard solution approach,\nrational expectations equilibria require agents to predict the evolution of the\nfull cross-sectional distribution of state variables, leading to an extreme\ncurse of dimensionality. In this paper, we introduce a novel equilibrium\nconcept, N-Bounded Foresight Equilibrium (N-BFE), and establish its existence\nunder mild conditions. In N-BFE, agents optimize over an infinite horizon but\nform expectations about key economic variables only for the next N periods.\nBeyond this horizon, they assume that economic variables remain constant and\nuse a predetermined continuation value. This equilibrium notion reduces\ncomputational complexity and draws a direct parallel to lookahead policies in\nreinforcement learning, where agents make near-term calculations while relying\non approximate valuations beyond a computationally feasible horizon. At the\nsame time, it lowers cognitive demands on agents while better aligning with the\nbehavioral literature by incorporating time inconsistency and limited\nattention, all while preserving desired forward-looking behavior and ensuring\nthat agents still respond to policy changes. Importantly, in N-BFE equilibria,\nforecast errors arise endogenously. We measure the foresight errors for\ndifferent foresight horizons and show that foresight significantly influences\nthe variation in endogenous equilibrium variables, distinguishing our findings\nfrom traditional risk aversion or precautionary savings channels. This\nvariation arises from a feedback mechanism between individual decision-making\nand equilibrium variables, where increased foresight induces greater\nnon-stationarity in agents' decisions and, consequently, in economic variables.",

The objective was to maximise material removal\nwhile minimising surface roughness (Ra) by operating above the photoablation\nthreshold. Results demonstrate that 30-fs laser photoablation achieves Ra <0.1\n\\mum, meeting both high- and ultra-high-precision machining standards, while\nmaintaining surface integrity and preventing heat-affected zone (HAZ) damage.\nAt 1 kJ/cm^2 (10 J/cm^2 fluence, 100 pulses), an Ra of 0.09 \\mum was achieved,\nsatisfying ultra-high precision criteria (Ra <0.1 \\mum). Additionally, doses\nbelow 10 kJ/cm^2 consistently met high-precision machining requirements (Ra\n<0.2 \\mum). Photoablation efficiency peaked below 50 kJ/cm^2, after which\nmaterial removal diminished, indicating non-linear process limitations. The\nsp3-diamond phase remained intact, as confirmed by the unchanged T2g Raman mode\nat 1332 cm^-1, with no detectable Raman G or D modes, confirming the absence of\nsp2-related graphitization, structural disorder, of nitrogen vacancy (NV)\ncentre annealing.

Instead, the causal structure must be defined using the fastest\npropagating modes, which travel along characteristic surfaces. The superluminal\npropagation in higher-curvature theories has significant implications for black\nholes. Specifically, if the Killing horizon of a black hole is not a\ncharacteristic surface corresponding to the fastest propagating mode, the\nhorizon can no longer function as a causal barrier. Our analysis demonstrates\nthat GQG with a genuine fourth-order equation of motion possesses only null\ncharacteristics, implying that the horizon is a characteristic surface.\nFurthermore, we perform a detailed characteristic analysis of ECG. We show that\nwhile all null surfaces are characteristic surfaces in ECG, the converse is not\ntrue - there exist non-null characteristic surfaces. In particular, we identify\na non-null characteristic surface in a Type N spacetime in the algebraic\nclassification of spacetimes.

By identifying\nmeet irreducible neurons, our lattice-based pruning algorithm selectively\nretains critical connections while eliminating redundant ones. The method is\nimplemented using both binary and continuous-valued adjacency matrices to\ncapture different aspects of network connectivity.

To cope, several training algorithms guarantee\ndifferential privacy (DP) by adding noise to their computation. However, DP\nrequires to add noise considering every possible training set. This leads to a\nsignificant decrease in the network's accuracy. Individual DP (iDP) restricts\nDP to a given training set. We observe that some inputs deterministically\nsatisfy iDP without any noise. By identifying them, we can provide iDP\nlabel-only access to the network with a minor decrease to its accuracy.\nHowever, identifying the inputs that satisfy iDP without any noise is highly\nchallenging. Our key idea is to compute the iDP deterministic bound (iDP-DB),\nwhich overapproximates the set of inputs that do not satisfy iDP, and add noise\nonly to their predicted labels. To compute the tightest iDP-DB, which enables\nto guard the label-only access with minimal accuracy decrease, we propose\nLUCID, which leverages several formal verification techniques. First, it\nencodes the problem as a mixed-integer linear program, defined over a network\nand over every network trained identically but without a unique data point.\nSecond, it abstracts a set of networks using a hyper-network. Third, it\neliminates the overapproximation error via a novel branch-and-bound technique.\nFourth, it bounds the differences of matching neurons in the network and the\nhyper-network and employs linear relaxation if they are small. We show that\nLUCID can provide classifiers with a perfect individuals' privacy guarantee\n(0-iDP) -- which is infeasible for DP training algorithms -- with an accuracy\ndecrease of 1.4%. For more relaxed $\\varepsilon$-iDP guarantees, LUCID has an\naccuracy decrease of 1.2%. In contrast, existing DP training algorithms reduce\nthe accuracy by 12.7%.",

With IG-PRM, we\naim to address this problem by allowing robot operators to specify such\nconstraints through natural language instructions, such as ``aim for wider\npaths'' or ``mind small gaps''. The key idea is to convert such instructions\ninto embedding vectors using large-language models (LLMs) and use the vectors\nas a condition to predict instruction-guided cost maps from occupancy maps.

This substitution invalidates the\nexchangeability between imputed nonconformity scores for test data and those\nderived from calibration data, resulting in reduced power. In contrast, our\napproach circumvents the need for conformal p-values by constructing a\nlikelihood-ratio-based decision rule that directly utilizes observed covariates\nfrom both calibration and test samples. The asymptotic optimality and FDR\ncontrol of the proposed method are established under a correctly specified\nmodel, and modified selection procedures are introduced to improve power under\nmodel misspecification. The proposed methods are computationally efficient and\ncan be readily extended to handle covariate shifts, making them well-suited for\nreal-world applications.

    "abstract": "Accurate underwater navigation is a challenging task due to the absence of\nglobal navigation satellite system signals and the reliance on inertial\nnavigation systems that suffer from drift over time. Doppler velocity logs\n(DVLs) are typically used to mitigate this drift through velocity measurements,\nwhich are commonly estimated using a parameter estimation approach such as\nleast squares (LS). However, LS works under the assumption of ideal conditions\nand does not account for sensor biases, leading to suboptimal performance. This\npaper proposes a data-driven alternative based on multi-output Gaussian process\nregression (MOGPR) to improve DVL velocity estimation. MOGPR provides velocity\nestimates and associated measurement covariances, enabling an adaptive\nintegration within an error-state Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). We evaluate our\nproposed approach using real-world AUV data and compare it against LS and a\nstate-of-the-art deep learning model, BeamsNet. Results demonstrate that MOGPR\nreduces velocity estimation errors by approximately 20% while simultaneously\nenhancing overall navigation accuracy, particularly in the orientation states.\nAdditionally, the incorporation of uncertainty estimates from MOGPR enables an\nadaptive EKF framework, improving navigation robustness in dynamic underwater\nenvironments.",

Recently, Beyond Diagonal RIS (BD-RIS) has been proposed\nas a generalization of conventional RIS, offering enhanced design flexibility\nthanks to the presence of tunable impedances that connect RIS elements.\nHowever, increased interconnections lead to high circuit complexity, which\nposes a significant practical challenge. In this paper, we address the\nfundamental open question: What is the class of BD-RIS architectures that\nachieves the optimal performance in a RIS-aided multiuser multi-input\nmulti-output (MIMO) system? By modeling BD-RIS architectures using graph\ntheory, we identify a class of BD-RIS architectures that achieves the optimal\nperformance--matching that of fully-connected RIS--while maintaining low\ncircuit complexity. Our result holds for a broad class of performance metrics,\nincluding the commonly used sum channel gain/sum-rate/energy efficiency\nmaximization, transmit power minimization, and the information-theoretic\ncapacity region. The number of tunable impedances in the proposed class is\n${O}(N\\min\\{D,N/2\\})$, where $N$ denotes the number of RIS elements and $D$ is\nthe degree of freedom of the multiuser MIMO channel, i.e., the minimum between\nthe number of transmit antennas and the total number of received antennas\nacross all users. Since $D$ is much smaller than $N$ in practice, the\ncomplexity scales as ${O}(ND)$, which is substantially lower than the\n${O}(N^2)$ complexity of fully-connected RIS. We further introduce two novel\nBD-RIS architectures--band-connected RIS and stem-connected RIS--and show that\nthey belong to the optimal architecture class under certain conditions.\nSimulation results validate the optimality and enhanced performance-complexity\ntradeoff of our proposed architectures.",

Our extensive experiments reveal\nthat parody-related tasks still remain challenging for all models, and\ncontextual information plays a critical role. Interestingly, we find that, in\ncertain scenarios, traditional sentence embedding methods combined with simple\nclassifiers can outperform advanced LLMs, i.e. DeepSeek-R1 and GPT-o3,\nhighlighting parody as a significant challenge for LLMs.",

    "abstract": "To satisfy the rigorous requirements of precise edge detection in critical\nhigh-accuracy measurements, this article proposes a series of efficient\napproaches for localizing subpixel edge. In contrast to the fitting based\nmethods, which consider pixel intensity as a sample value derived from a\nspecific model. We take an innovative perspective by assuming that the\nintensity at the pixel level can be interpreted as a local integral mapping in\nthe intensity model for subpixel localization. Consequently, we propose a\nstraightforward subpixel edge localization method called Converted Intensity\nSummation (CIS). To address the limited robustness associated with focusing\nsolely on the localization of individual edge points, a Stable Edge Region\n(SER) based algorithm is presented to alleviate local interference near edges.\nGiven the observation that the consistency of edge statistics exists in the\nlocal region, the algorithm seeks correlated stable regions in the vicinity of\nedges to facilitate the acquisition of robust parameters and achieve higher\nprecision positioning. In addition, an edge complement method based on\nextension-adjustment is also introduced to rectify the irregular edges through\nthe efficient migration of SERs. A large number of experiments are conducted on\nboth synthetic and real image datasets which cover common edge patterns as well\nas various real scenarios such as industrial PCB images, remote sensing and\nmedical images. It is verified that CIS can achieve higher accuracy than the\nstate-of-the-art method, while requiring less execution time. Moreover, by\nintegrating SER into CIS, the proposed algorithm demonstrates excellent\nperformance in further improving the anti-interference capability and\npositioning accuracy.",

    "abstract": "The expressive power and computational complexity of deep visual generative\nmodels, such as flow-based and autoregressive (AR) models, have gained\nconsiderable interest for their wide-ranging applications in generative tasks.\nHowever, the theoretical characterization of their expressiveness through the\nlens of circuit complexity remains underexplored, particularly for the\nstate-of-the-art architecture like FlowAR proposed by [Ren et al., 2024], which\nintegrates flow-based and autoregressive mechanisms. This gap limits our\nunderstanding of their inherent computational limits and practical efficiency.\nIn this study, we address this gap by analyzing the circuit complexity of the\nFlowAR architecture. We demonstrate that when the largest feature map produced\nby the FlowAR model has dimensions $n \\times n \\times c$, the FlowAR model is\nsimulable by a family of threshold circuits $\\mathsf{TC}^0$, which have\nconstant depth $O(1)$ and polynomial width $\\mathrm{poly}(n)$. This is the\nfirst study to rigorously highlight the limitations in the expressive power of\nFlowAR models. Furthermore, we identify the conditions under which the FlowAR\nmodel computations can achieve almost quadratic time. To validate our\ntheoretical findings, we present efficient model variant constructions based on\nlow-rank approximations that align with the derived criteria. Our work provides\na foundation for future comparisons with other generative paradigms and guides\nthe development of more efficient and expressive implementations.",

The variability in\nEEG data across individuals poses a significant barrier to the development of\neffective and widely applicable aBCI models. To tackle this issue, we propose a\nnovel transfer learning framework called Semi-supervised Domain Adaptation with\nDynamic Distribution Alignment (SDA-DDA). This approach aligns the marginal and\nconditional probability distribution of source and target domains using maximum\nmean discrepancy (MMD) and conditional maximum mean discrepancy (CMMD).

Additionally, a pseudo-label\nconfidence filtering module is integrated into the semi-supervised process to\nrefine pseudo-label generation and improve the estimation of conditional\ndistributions. Extensive experiments on EEG benchmark databases (SEED, SEED-IV\nand DEAP) validate the robustness and effectiveness of SDA-DDA.

However, their\neffectiveness depends on the consistency between the problems Pareto front\nshape and the weight distribution. Decomposition-based MOEAs, with uniformly\ndistributed weights (in a simplex), perform well on problems with a regular\n(simplex-like) Pareto front, but not on those with an irregular Pareto front.\nPrevious studies have focused on adapting the weights to approximate the\nirregular Pareto front during the evolutionary process. However, these\nadaptations can actually harm the performance on the regular Pareto front via\nchanging the weights during the search process that are eventually the best fit\nfor the Pareto front. In this paper, we propose an algorithm called the weight\nadaptation trigger mechanism for decomposition-based MOEAs (ATM-MOEA/D) to\ntackle this issue. ATM-MOEA/D uses an archive to gradually approximate the\nshape of the Pareto front during the search. When the algorithm detects\nevolution stagnation (meaning the population no longer improves significantly),\nit compares the distribution of the population with that of the archive to\ndistinguish between regular and irregular Pareto fronts. Only when an irregular\nPareto front is identified, the weights are adapted. Our experimental results\nshow that the proposed algorithm not only performs generally better than seven\nstate-of-the-art weight-adapting methods on irregular Pareto fronts but also is\nable to achieve the same results as fixed-weight methods like MOEA/D on regular\nPareto fronts.",

The price paid for\nthis is the fact that at each scale the wavelet transform lives on the rotation\ngroup $SO(d)$, and not on $\\mathbb{S}^{d-1}$ as in the zonal setting. Thus, the\nstandard approach of building discrete frames by sampling the continuous\nwavelet transform requires a significantly larger amount of sample points.\nHowever, by keeping the directionality limited, this number can be greatly\nreduced to the point where it is comparable to the number of samples needed in\nthe isotropic case. Moreover, the limited directionality is reflected in the\nwavelets being steerable and their great localization in space leads to a fast\nconvergence of the wavelet expansion in the spaces $L^p(\\mathbb{S}^{d-1})$,\n$1\\leq p \\leq \\infty$.",

We introduce the Anchor-Gaussian Variational Autoencoder (Anchor-GS\nVAE), which encodes a point cloud and a single image into anchor latents and\ndecode these latents into 3DGS, enabling efficient latent-space generation. To\nenable multi-view geometry consistent and controllable generation, we propose a\nSeed-Point-Driven strategy: first generate sparse seed points as a coarse\ngeometry representation, then map them to anchor latents via the Seed-Anchor\nMapping Module. Geometric consistency is ensured by the easily learned sparse\nseed points, and users can intuitively drag the seed points to deform the final\n3DGS geometry, with changes propagated through the anchor latents. To the best\nof our knowledge, we are the first to achieve geometrically controllable 3D\nGaussian generation and editing without relying on 2D diffusion priors,\ndelivering comparable 3D generation quality to state-of-the-art methods.",

    "abstract": "The quantum geometric structure of electrons introduces fundamental insights\ninto understanding quantum effects in materials. One notable manifestation is\nthe non-linear Hall effect (NLHE), which has drawn considerable interest for\nits potential to overcome the intrinsic limitations of semiconductor diodes at\nlow input power and high frequency. In this study, we investigate NLHE stemming\nfrom the real part of the quantum geometric tensor, specifically the quantum\nmetric, in an antiferromagnetic topological material, EuSn2As2, using density\nfunctional theory. Our calculations predict a remarkable NLHE arising from a\nsymmetry-protected, single Type-II surface Dirac cone in the\neven-numbered-layer two-dimensional slab thin-film, yielding a non-linear Hall\nconductivity exceeding 20 mA/V2-an order of magnitude larger than previously\nreported. This single Dirac band dispersion represents the simplest model for\ngenerating NLHE, positioning the EuSn2As2 thin-film as a hydrogen atom for NLHE\nsystems. Additionally, we observe NLHE from band-edge states near the Fermi\nlevel. Our findings also reveal that 30% phosphorus (P) doping can double the\nnon-linear Hall conductivity. With its substantial and tunable NLHE, EuSn2As2\nthin-films present promising applications in antiferromagnetic spintronics and\nrectification devices.",

Since a majority of multi-robot systems (MRSs) rely on\ncommunication and relative sensing for their efficient operation, a failure in\none robot could result in a cascade of failures in the entire system. In this\nwork, we propose a hierarchical framework for area coverage, combining\ncentralized coordination by leveraging Voronoi partitioning with decentralized\nreference tracking model predictive control (MPC) for control design. In\naddition to reference tracking, the decentralized MPC also performs bearing\nmaintenance to enforce a rigid MRS network, thereby enhancing the structural\nresilience, i.e., the ability to detect and mitigate the effects of\nlocalization errors and robot loss during the mission. Furthermore, we show\nthat the resulting control architecture guarantees the recovery of the MRS\nnetwork in the event of robot loss while maintaining a minimally rigid\nstructure.

Its real-world\nadoption in surgical applications, however, remains limited. We review the\ncurrent state-of-the-art performance of deep learning (DL)-based CV models for\nsegmentation and object detection of anatomical structures in videos obtained\nduring surgical procedures.\n  Methods: We conducted a scoping review of studies on semantic segmentation\nand object detection of anatomical structures published between 2014 and 2024\nfrom 3 major databases - PubMed, Embase, and IEEE Xplore. The primary objective\nwas to evaluate the state-of-the-art performance of semantic segmentation in\nsurgical videos. Secondary objectives included examining DL models, progress\ntoward clinical applications, and the specific challenges with segmentation of\norgans/tissues in surgical videos.\n  Results: We identified 58 relevant published studies. These focused\npredominantly on procedures from general surgery [20(34.4%)], colorectal\nsurgery [9(15.5%)], and neurosurgery [8(13.8%)]. Cholecystectomy [14(24.1%)]\nand low anterior rectal resection [5(8.6%)] were the most common procedures\naddressed. Semantic segmentation [47(81%)] was the primary CV task. U-Net\n[14(24.1%)] and DeepLab [13(22.4%)] were the most widely used models. Larger\norgans such as the liver (Dice score: 0.88) had higher accuracy compared to\nsmaller structures such as nerves (Dice score: 0.49). Models demonstrated\nreal-time inference potential ranging from 5-298 frames-per-second (fps).\n  Conclusion: This review highlights the significant progress made in DL-based\nsemantic segmentation for surgical videos with real-time applicability,\nparticularly for larger organs. Addressing challenges with smaller structures,\ndata availability, and generalizability remains crucial for future\nadvancements.",

Here, we investigate whether artificial neural networks (ANNs)\nexhibit similar category-selective neurons and how these neurons vary across\nmodel layers and between purely visual and vision-language models. Inspired by\nfMRI functional localizer experiments, we presented images from different\ncategories (faces, bodies, scenes, words, scrambled scenes, and scrambled\nwords) to deep networks and identified category-selective neurons using\nstatistical criteria. Comparing ResNet and the structurally controlled\nResNet-based CLIP model, we found that both models contain category-selective\nneurons, with their proportion increasing across layers, mirroring category\nselectivity in higher-level visual brain regions. However, CLIP exhibited a\nhigher proportion but lower specificity of category-selective neurons compared\nto ResNet. Additionally, CLIP's category-selective neurons were more evenly\ndistributed across feature maps and demonstrated greater representational\nconsistency across layers. These findings suggest that language learning\nincreases the number of category-selective neurons while reducing their\nselectivity strength, reshaping visual representations in deep networks.

To address\nthese challenges in deep neural networks for large-scale heterogeneous graphs,\nthis paper introduces the Mamba-based Asynchronous Propagation Network (MAPN),\nwhich enhances the representation of heterogeneous sparse graphs.

The\nstructure is found to be hierarchal and in this simulated hierarchy, the\nstratification, the parabola profile in the stratified core, the double layer,\nand the coagulated profile in the core center are examined. This fluid\nsimulation version and a quasi-fluid simulation of an Ar/CF4 ICP given by the\nHPEM code, cooperatively enlighten the discharge structure of highly\nelectronegative ICPs and meanwhile suggest the potential applications of them.\nIt is found that when the ions are cold the hierarchy is predicted and when the\nions are thermalized the simple discharge structure appears.

In\nthis work, we introduce a contrastive language-crystals model (CLaC)\npre-trained on a newly synthesized dataset of 126k crystal structure-text\npairs. To demonstrate the advantage of using synthetic data to overcome data\nscarcity, we constructed a comparable dataset extracted from academic papers.\nWe evaluate CLaC's generalization ability through various zero-shot cross-modal\ntasks and downstream applications. In experiments, CLaC achieves\nstate-of-the-art zero-shot generalization performance in understanding crystal\nstructures, surpassing latest large language models.",

Likewise, the primary sites of the r-process are still areas of\nextensive research. Until now, the number of stars with neutron-capture element\nabundances in dSphs has been limited by the need for stars bright enough for\nhigh-resolution spectroscopy. We present abundance measurements of the\nneutron-capture elements Sr, Y, Ba, and Eu with errors < 0.4 dex - as well as\nnew measurements of Mg - in 491 stars in Sculptor, Fornax, Draco, Sextans, and\nUrsa Minor. The large number of stars in our sample is possible because we used\nmedium-resolution spectra from the DEIMOS spectrograph, assembling the largest\nhomogeneous set of neutron-capture abundances in dwarf spheroidal galaxies to\ndate. By utilizing the abundances of both s- and r-process elements, we find\nevidence of an s-process contribution at early times in Sculptor from our\nmeasurements of [Ba/Fe]. This is a potential signature of s-process\nnucleosynthesis in fast-rotating massive stars. By comparing our measurements\nof [Eu/Fe] with [Mg/Fe], we show the need for an r-process source that has a\nshort delay time to enrich stars in the dSphs.

With deep\nneural networks like long short-term memory (LSTM), using either lagged\nobservations as inputs (called \"data integration\") or variational DA has shown\nsuccess in improving forecasts. However, it is unclear which methods are\nperformant or optimal for physics-informed machine learning (\"differentiable\")\nmodels, which represent only a small amount of physically-meaningful states\nwhile using deep networks to supply parameters or missing processes. Here we\ndeveloped variational DA methods for differentiable models, including\noptimizing adjusters for just precipitation data, just model internal\nhydrological states, or both. Our results demonstrated that differentiable\nstreamflow models using the CAMELS dataset can benefit strongly and\nequivalently from variational DA as LSTM, with one-day lead time median\nNash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) elevated from 0.75 to 0.82. The resulting\nforecast matched or outperformed LSTM with DA in the eastern, northwestern, and\ncentral Great Plains regions of the conterminous United States. Both\nprecipitation and state adjusters were needed to achieve these results, with\nthe latter being substantially more effective on its own, and the former adding\nmoderate benefits for high flows.

    "abstract": "Despite significant progress on popular multimodal benchmarks,\nstate-of-the-art Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) continue to struggle\nwith basic visual reasoning tasks that are trivially solved by humans, such as\nrecognizing spatial relationships. To systematically investigate this gap, we\nintroduce VisFactor, a benchmark that digitizes 20 vision-centric subtests from\na well-established cognitive psychology assessment. These subtests span four\ncore domains of human visual cognition: (1) Visualization and Spatial\nProcessing, (2) Perceptual and Closure, (3) Memory, and (4) Reasoning. We\nevaluate 20 frontier MLLMs from GPT, Gemini, Claude, LLaMA, Qwen, and SEED\nfamilies. The best-performing model achieves a score of only 25.19 out of 100,\nwith consistent failures on tasks such as mental rotation, spatial relation\ninference, and figure-ground discrimination, regardless of model size or\nprompting strategy. These findings suggest that current MLLM performance gains\non high-level benchmarks do not reflect human-like low-level visual cognition,\nchallenging the assumption that large-scale pretraining naturally induces\ngestalt-like perceptual capabilities.

Recent advances\nin Artificial Intelligence (AI) have reinvigorated the imagination of adopting\nAI for SPM applications. This manuscript begins with a concise review of the\nhistorical development of the statistically based SPM methods. Next, this\nmanuscript explores AI and Machine Learning (ML) algorithms and methods applied\nin various SPM applications, addressing quality characteristics of univariate,\nmultivariate, profile, and image. These AI methods can be classified into the\nfollowing categories: classification, pattern recognition, time series\napplications, and generative AI. Specifically, different kinds of neural\nnetworks, such as artificial neural networks (ANN), convolutional neural\nnetworks (CNN), recurrent neural networks (RNN), and generative adversarial\nnetworks (GAN), are among the most implemented AI methods impacting SPM.\nFinally, this manuscript outlines a couple of future directions that harness\nthe potential of the Large Multimodal Model (LMM) for advancing SPM research\nand applications in complex systems.

They differ in temporal granularity: Continuous-Time Dynamic Graphs\n(CTDGs) exhibit rapid, localized changes, while Discrete-Time Dynamic Graphs\n(DTDGs) show gradual, global updates. This difference leads to isolated\ndevelopments in representation learning for each type. To advance\nrepresentation learning, recent research attempts to design a unified model\ncapable of handling both CTDGs and DTDGs. However, it typically focuses on\nlocal dynamic propagation for temporal structure learning in the time domain,\nfailing to accurately capture the structural evolution associated with each\ntemporal granularity. In addition, existing works-whether specific or\nunified-often overlook the issue of temporal noise, compromising the model\nrobustness and effectiveness. To better model both types of dynamic graphs, we\npropose UniDyG, a unified and effective representation learning approach, which\nscales to large dynamic graphs. We first propose a novel Fourier Graph\nAttention (FGAT) mechanism that can model local and global structural\ncorrelations based on recent neighbors and complex-number selective\naggregation, while theoretically ensuring consistent representations of dynamic\ngraphs over time. Based on approximation theory, we demonstrate that FGAT is\nwell-suited to capture the underlying structures in CTDGs and DTDGs. We further\nenhance FGAT to resist temporal noise by designing an energy-gated unit, which\nadaptively filters out high-frequency noise according to the energy. Last, we\nleverage our FGAT mechanisms for temporal structure learning and employ the\nfrequency-enhanced linear function for node-level dynamic updates, facilitating\nthe generation of high-quality temporal embeddings. Extensive experiments show\nthat our UniDyG achieves an average improvement of 14.4% over sixteen baselines\nacross nine dynamic graphs.",

However, most existing methods either assume complete\nknowledge of network topology and metric formulas-an unrealistic expectation in\nmany real-world scenarios with limited observability-or rely entirely on\nblack-box end-to-end models. To tackle this, in this paper, we argue that a\ngood network tomography requires synergizing the knowledge from both data and\nappropriate inductive bias from (partial) prior knowledge. To see this, we\npropose Deep Network Tomography (DeepNT), a novel framework that leverages a\npath-centric graph neural network to predict path performance metrics without\nrelying on predefined hand-crafted metrics, assumptions, or the real network\ntopology. The path-centric graph neural network learns the path embedding by\ninferring and aggregating the embeddings of the sequence of nodes that compose\nthis path. Training path-centric graph neural networks requires learning the\nneural netowrk parameters and network topology under discrete constraints\ninduced by the observed path performance metrics, which motivates us to design\na learning objective that imposes connectivity and sparsity constraints on\ntopology and path performance triangle inequality on path performance.\nExtensive experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate the\nsuperiority of DeepNT in predicting performance metrics and inferring graph\ntopology compared to state-of-the-art methods.",

Additionally, it enables gradient-based optimization,\novercoming reliance on enumeration for improved efficiency and effectiveness.\nTo handle cases where T2I models block image outputs due to defenses, we\nintroduce Sphere-Probing Learning (SPL) to enable optimization even without\nimage results. Following SPL, our model bypasses defenses, inducing the\ngeneration of harmful content. To ensure semantic alignment with attacker\nintent, we propose Semantic-Enhancing Learning (SEL) for precise semantic\ncontrol. UPAM also prioritizes the naturalness of adversarial prompts using\nIn-context Naturalness Enhancement (INE), making them harder for human\nexaminers to detect. Additionally, we address the issue of iterative\nqueries--common in prior methods and easily detectable by API defenders--by\nintroducing Transferable Attack Learning (TAL), allowing effective attacks with\nminimal queries. Extensive experiments validate UPAM's superiority in\neffectiveness, efficiency, naturalness, and low query detection rates.",

However, the reliability\nof evaluation depends on the diversity and realism of the generated scenes.\nExtreme weather conditions, particularly extreme rainfalls, are rare and costly\nto capture in real-world settings. While simulated environments can help\naddress this limitation, existing rainy image synthesizers often suffer from\npoor controllability over illumination and limited realism, which significantly\nundermines the effectiveness of the model evaluation. To that end, we propose a\nlearning-from-rendering rainy image synthesizer, which combines the benefits of\nthe realism of rendering-based methods and the controllability of\nlearning-based methods. To validate the effectiveness of our extreme rainy\nimage synthesizer on semantic segmentation task, we require a continuous set of\nwell-labeled extreme rainy images.

However, in real-world\nscenarios, issues such as occlusion, noise interference, and missing viewpoints\ncan severely affect pose estimation. To address these challenges, we introduce\nthe task of Deficiency-Aware 3D Pose Estimation. Traditional 3D pose estimation\nmethods often rely on multi-stage networks and modular combinations, which can\nlead to cumulative errors and increased training complexity, making them unable\nto effectively address deficiency-aware estimation. To this end, we propose\nDeProPose, a flexible method that simplifies the network architecture to reduce\ntraining complexity and avoid information loss in multi-stage designs.\nAdditionally, the model innovatively introduces a multi-view feature fusion\nmechanism based on relative projection error, which effectively utilizes\ninformation from multiple viewpoints and dynamically assigns weights, enabling\nefficient integration and enhanced robustness to overcome deficiency-aware 3D\nPose Estimation challenges. Furthermore, to thoroughly evaluate this end-to-end\nmulti-view 3D human pose estimation model and to advance research on\nocclusion-related challenges, we have developed a novel 3D human pose\nestimation dataset, termed the Deficiency-Aware 3D Pose Estimation (DA-3DPE)\ndataset. This dataset encompasses a wide range of deficiency scenarios,\nincluding noise interference, missing viewpoints, and occlusion challenges.\nCompared to state-of-the-art methods, DeProPose not only excels in addressing\nthe deficiency-aware problem but also shows improvement in conventional\nscenarios, providing a powerful and user-friendly solution for 3D human pose\nestimation.

    "abstract": "The diameter of a polytope is a fundamental geometric parameter that plays a\ncrucial role in understanding the efficiency of the simplex method. Despite its\ncentral nature, the computational complexity of computing the diameter of a\ngiven polytope is poorly understood. Already in 1994, Frieze and Teng [Comp.\nCompl.] recognized the possibility that this task could potentially be harder\nthan NP-hard, and asked whether the corresponding decision problem is complete\nfor the second stage of the polynomial hierarchy, i.e. $\\Pi^p_2$-complete. In\nthe following years, partial results could be obtained. In a cornerstone\nresult, Frieze and Teng themselves proved weak NP-hardness for a family of\ncustom defined polytopes. Sanit\\`a [FOCS18] in a break-through result proved\nthat already for the much simpler fractional matching polytope the problem is\nstrongly NP-hard. Very recently, Steiner and N\\\"obel [SODA25] generalized this\nresult to the even simpler bipartite perfect matching polytope and the circuit\ndiameter. In this paper, we finally show that computing the diameter of the\nbipartite perfect matching polytope is $\\Pi^p_2$-hard. Since the corresponding\ndecision problem is also trivially contained in $\\Pi^p_2$, this decidedly\nanswers Frieze and Teng's 30 year old question. Our results also hold when the\ndiameter is replaced by the circuit diameter. As our second main result, we\nprove that for some $\\varepsilon > 0$ the (circuit) diameter of the bipartite\nperfect matching polytope cannot be approximated by a factor better than $(1 +\n\\varepsilon)$. This answers a recent question by N\\\"obel and Steiner. It is the\nfirst known inapproximability result for the circuit diameter, and extends\nSanit\\`a's inapproximability result of the diameter to the totally unimodular\ncase.",

    "abstract": "Federated learning systems are increasingly threatened by data poisoning\nattacks, where malicious clients compromise global models by contributing\ntampered updates. Existing defenses often rely on impractical assumptions, such\nas access to a central test dataset, or fail to generalize across diverse\nattack types, particularly those involving multiple malicious clients working\ncollaboratively. To address this, we propose Federated Noise-Induced Activation\nAnalysis (FedNIA), a novel defense framework to identify and exclude\nadversarial clients without relying on any central test dataset. FedNIA injects\nrandom noise inputs to analyze the layerwise activation patterns in client\nmodels leveraging an autoencoder that detects abnormal behaviors indicative of\ndata poisoning. FedNIA can defend against diverse attack types, including\nsample poisoning, label flipping, and backdoors, even in scenarios with\nmultiple attacking nodes. Experimental results on non-iid federated datasets\ndemonstrate its effectiveness and robustness, underscoring its potential as a\nfoundational approach for enhancing the security of federated learning systems.",

Yet, data science tasks often admit\nmultiple statistically valid solutions, e.g. different modeling strategies,\nmaking it critical to understand the reasoning behind analyses, not just their\noutcomes. While manual review of LLM-generated code can help ensure statistical\nsoundness, it is labor-intensive and requires expertise. A more scalable\napproach is to evaluate the underlying workflows - the logical plans guiding\ncode generation. However, it remains unclear how to assess whether a\nLLM-generated workflow supports reproducible implementations.\n  To address this, we present $\\it{AIRepr}$, an $\\it{A}$nalyst -\n$\\it{I}$nspector framework for automatically evaluating and improving the\n$\\it{Repr}$oducibility of LLM-generated data analysis workflows. Our framework\nis grounded in statistical principles and supports scalable, automated\nassessment.

First, the adjoint Lax pair and auxiliary\neigenfunctions are introduced for the direct scattering, and the analyticity,\nsymmetries of eigenfunctions and scattering matrix are studied in detail. Then,\nthe distribution of discrete eigenvalues is examined, and the asymptotic\nbehaviors of the eigenfunctions and scattering coefficients are analyzed\nrigorously.

Further, the\nRiemann-Hilbert problem is formulated for the the inverse problem with the\nscattering coefficients admitting an arbitrary number of simple zeros. For the\nreflectionless case, the N-soliton solutions are presented in the determinant\nform.

The ability to detect anomalous situations outside\nof the operational design domain is a key component in self-driving cars,\nenabling us to mitigate the impact of abnormal ego behaviors and to realize\ntrustworthy driving systems. On-road anomaly detection in egocentric videos\nremains a challenging problem due to the difficulties introduced by complex and\ninteractive scenarios. We conduct a holistic analysis of common on-road anomaly\npatterns, from which we propose three unsupervised anomaly detection experts: a\nscene expert that focuses on frame-level appearances to detect abnormal scenes\nand unexpected scene motions; an interaction expert that models normal relative\nmotions between two road participants and raises alarms whenever anomalous\ninteractions emerge; and a behavior expert which monitors abnormal behaviors of\nindividual objects by future trajectory prediction. To combine the strengths of\nall the modules, we propose an expert ensemble (Xen) using a Kalman filter, in\nwhich the final anomaly score is absorbed as one of the states and the\nobservations are generated by the experts.

One recent such example is the work\nby Fishelson et al.

In this work, we significantly generalize\ntheir result in the following ways: (a) in addition to smooth univariate forms,\nour algorithm also simultaneously achieves $O(T^{1/3})$ swap regret for any\nproper loss with a twice continuously differentiable univariate form (such as\nTsallis entropy); (b) our bounds hold not only for pseudo swap regret that\nmeasures losses using the forecaster's distributions on predictions, but also\nhold for the actual swap regret that measures losses using the forecaster's\nactual realized predictions.\n  We achieve so by introducing a new stronger notion of calibration called\n(pseudo) KL-Calibration, which we show is equivalent to the (pseudo) swap\nregret for log loss.

Starting from a \\( D \\)-dimensional\nEinstein--Hilbert action on a warped product manifold, we perform a systematic\ndimensional reduction to obtain a four-dimensional effective action in the\nEinstein frame. Our formulation extends the classical potential by including\nself-interacting moduli fields and RG-improved parameters via the\nColeman--Weinberg mechanism, thereby accounting for both matter and graviton\nloop corrections. The resulting renormalization group flow modifies the\neffective mass and coupling constants, which in turn plays a critical role in\nmoduli stabilization and the low-energy phenomenology. Taking the\nnon-relativistic limit, we derive a Gross-Pitaevskii equation that governs the\ndynamics of the gravitational exciton condensate, and couple it\nself-consistently with Poisson's equation to capture gravitational\nbackreaction. Through both variational and numerical analyses, we obtain\nstationary solutions in spherically symmetric, rotating, and anisotropic\nconfigurations, and perform a linear stability analysis using the Bogoliubov-de\nGennes formalism. Our results reveal a Bogoliubov dispersion relation that\nexhibits a phonon-like linear regime at low momenta, transitioning to quadratic\nfree-particle behavior at high momenta.",
