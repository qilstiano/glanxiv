    "abstract": "This work examines the plausibility of a lunar origin of natural objects that\nhave a negative total energy (ET) with respect to the geocenter while within 3\nEarth Hill radii (RH), a population that we will refer to as 'bound'. They are\na super-set of the population of 'minimoons' which require that the object make\nat least one orbit around Earth in a synodic frame rotating with Earth and that\nits geocentric distance be <RH at some point while ET<0. Only two minimoons\nhave been discovered to date, 2006 RH120 and 2020 CD3, while 2024 PT5 and 2022\nNX1 meet our condition for 'bound'. The likely source region of co-orbital\nobjects is either the main belt, lunar ejecta, or a combination of both.\nEarlier works found that dynamical evolution of asteroids from the MB could\nexplain the observed minimoon population, but spectra of 2020 CD3 and 2024 PT5\nand Earth co-orbital (469219) Kamo'oalewa are more consistent with lunar\nbasalts than any MB asteroid spectra. This work calculates the steady-state\nsize-frequency distribution of the bound population given our understanding of\nthe lunar impact rate, the energy of the impactors, crater-scaling relations,\nand the relationship between the ejecta mass and speed. We integrate the\ntrajectory of lunar ejecta and calculate the statistics of 'prompt' bounding\nthat take place immediately after ejection, and 'delayed' bounding that occurs\nafter the objects have spent time on heliocentric orbits. A sub-set of the\ndelayed bound population composes the minimoon population. We find that lunar\nejecta can account for the observed population of bound objects but\nuncertainties in the crater formation and lunar ejecta properties induce a many\norders of magnitude range on the predicted population. If the bound objects can\nbe distinguished as lunar or asteroidal based on their spectra it may be\npossible to constrain crater formation processes.",

    "abstract": "Young stellar objects (YSOs) are surrounded by protoplanetary disks, which\nare the birthplace of young planets. Ring and gap structures are observed among\nevolved protoplanetary disks, often interpreted as a consequence of planet\nformation. The pre-Main Sequence (pre-MS) star MP Mus hosts one of the few\nknown examples of protoplanetary disks within ~100 pc. Previously, a disk ring\nstructure, with a radius of 80-85 au, was detected in scattered light via\nnear-infrared coronographic/polarimetric imaging. This ring structure may be\nindicative of the disk clearing process. Although such ring structures were not\nseen in the ALMA Band 6 images, some features were detected at $\\sim$50 au. In\nthis paper, we analyzed new ALMA Band 7 observations of MP Mus in order to\ninvestigate the details of its disk substructures. By subtracting the continuum\nprofile generated from Band 7 data, we discovered a ring structure in the Band\n7 dust continuum image at $\\sim$50 au. We calculated the overall dust mass as\n$28.4\\pm2.8 M_{\\oplus}$ at 0.89 mm and $26.3\\pm2.6 M_{\\oplus}$ at 1.3 mm and\nthe millimeter spectral index $\\alpha_{0.89-1.3mm} \\sim 2.2 \\pm 0.3$ between\n0.89 mm and 1.3 mm. Moreover, we display the spatial distribution of the\nspectral index ($\\alpha_{mm}$), estimating values ranging from 1.3 at the inner\ndisk to 4.0 at a large radius. Additionally, we observed an extended gas disk\nup to $\\sim$120 au, in contrast with a compact continuum millimeter extent of\n$\\sim$60 au. We conclude that there are strong indicators for an active radial\ndrift process within the disk. However, we cannot discard the possibility of a\ndust evolution process and a grain growth process as responsible for the outer\ndisk structures observed in the ALMA continuum imaging.",

In addition, the phase transition temperature of vanadium dioxide is\naround 68{\\deg}C, which is higher than most of terrestrial and extraterrestrial\napplications. In this study, we report the fabrication and characterization of\ntungsten-doped vanadium dioxide thin films with lowered phase transition\ntemperatures via co-sputtering, furnace oxidation and thermal annealing\nprocesses for wider application needs. The doping is achieved by co-sputtering\nof tungsten and vanadium targets while the doping level is varied by carefully\ncontrolling the sputtering power for tungsten. Doped thin film samples of 30-nm\nthick with different tungsten atomic concentrations are prepared by\nco-sputtering onto undoped silicon wafers. Optimal oxidation time of 4 hours is\ndetermined to reach full oxidation in an oxygen-rich furnace environment at\n300{\\deg}C. Systematic thermal annealing study is carried out to find the\noptimal annealing temperature and time. By using an optical cryostat coupled to\nan infrared spectrometer, the temperature-dependent infrared transmittance of\nfully annealed tungsten-doped vanadium dioxide thin films are measured in a\nwide temperature range from -60{\\deg}C to 100{\\deg}C.

Given the\nsensitive nature of this data and their frequent distribution among\ncollaborators, ensuring secure and attributable sharing is essential. Graph\nwatermarking enables attribution by embedding user-specific signatures into\ngraph-structured data. While prior work has addressed random perturbation\nattacks, the threat posed by adversaries leveraging structural properties\nthrough community detection remains unexplored. In this work, we introduce a\ncluster-aware threat model in which adversaries apply community-guided\nmodifications to evade detection. We propose two novel attack strategies and\nevaluate them on real-world social network graphs. Our results show that\ncluster-aware attacks can reduce attribution accuracy by up to 80% more than\nrandom baselines under equivalent perturbation budgets on sparse graphs. To\nmitigate this threat, we propose a lightweight embedding enhancement that\ndistributes watermark nodes across graph communities. This approach improves\nattribution accuracy by up to 60% under attack on dense graphs, without\nincreasing runtime or structural distortion. Our findings underscore the\nimportance of cluster-topological awareness in both watermarking design and\nadversarial modeling.",

    "abstract": "We introduce and study the Marco Polo problem, which is a combinatorial\napproach to geometric localization. In this problem, we are told there are one\nor more points of interest (POIs) within distance $n$ of the origin that we\nwish to localize. Given a mobile search point, $\\Delta$, that is initially at\nthe origin, a localization algorithm is a strategy to move $\\Delta$ to be\nwithin a distance of $1$ of a POI. In the combinatorial localization problem we\nstudy, the only tool we can use is reminiscent of the children's game, \"Marco\nPolo,\" in that $\\Delta$ can issue a probe signal out a specified distance, $d$,\nand the search algorithm learns whether or not there is a POI within distance\n$d$ of $\\Delta$. For example, we could imagine that POIs are one or more hikers\nlost in a forest and we need to design a search-and-rescue (SAR) strategy to\nfind them using radio signal probes to a response device that hikers carry.\nUnlike other known localization algorithms, probe responses do not inform our\nsearch algorithm of the direction or distance to a POI. The optimization\nproblem is to minimize the number of probes and/or POI responses, as well as\npossibly minimizing the distance traveled by $\\Delta$. We describe a number of\nefficient combinatorial Marco Polo localization strategies and we analyze each\none in terms of the size, $n$, of the search domain. Moreover, we derive strong\nbounds for the constant factors for the search costs for our algorithms, which\nin some cases involve computer-assisted proofs. We also show how to extend\nthese strategies to find all POIs using a simple, memoryless search algorithm,\ntraveling a distance that is $\\mathcal{O}(\\log{k})$-competitive with the\noptimal traveling salesperson (TSP) tour for $k$ POIs.",

    "abstract": "In volume visualization, users can interactively explore the\nthree-dimensional data by specifying color and opacity mappings in the transfer\nfunction (TF) or adjusting lighting parameters, facilitating meaningful\ninterpretation of the underlying structure. However, rendering large-scale\nvolumes demands powerful GPUs and high-speed memory access for real-time\nperformance. While existing novel view synthesis (NVS) methods offer faster\nrendering speeds with lower hardware requirements, the visible parts of a\nreconstructed scene are fixed and constrained by preset TF settings,\nsignificantly limiting user exploration. This paper introduces inverse volume\nrendering via Gaussian splatting (iVR-GS), an innovative NVS method that\nreduces the rendering cost while enabling scene editing for interactive volume\nexploration. Specifically, we compose multiple iVR-GS models associated with\nbasic TFs covering disjoint visible parts to make the entire volumetric scene\nvisible. Each basic model contains a collection of 3D editable Gaussians, where\neach Gaussian is a 3D spatial point that supports real-time scene rendering and\nediting. We demonstrate the superior reconstruction quality and composability\nof iVR-GS against other NVS solutions (Plenoxels, CCNeRF, and base 3DGS) on\nvarious volume datasets.

This paradigm has been used in\ndevelopmental psychology to explore how infants learn the sensory effects of\ntheir actions. In this paradigm, a mobile (an articulated and movable object\nhanging above an infant's crib) is connected to one of the infant's limbs,\nprompting the infant to preferentially move that \"connected\" limb. This ability\nto detect a \"sensorimotor contingency\" is considered to be a foundational\ncognitive ability in development. To understand how infants learn sensorimotor\ncontingencies, we built a model that attempts to replicate infant behavior. Our\nmodel incorporates a neural network, action-outcome prediction, exploration,\nmotor noise, preferred activity level, and biologically-inspired motor control.\nWe find that simulations with our model replicate the classic findings in the\nliterature showing preferential movement of the connected limb. An interesting\nobservation is that the model sometimes exhibits a burst of movement after the\nmobile is disconnected, casting light on a similar occasional finding in\ninfants. In addition to these general findings, the simulations also replicate\ndata from two recent more detailed studies using a connection with the mobile\nthat was either gradual or all-or-none. A series of ablation studies further\nshows that the inclusion of mechanisms of action-outcome prediction,\nexploration, motor noise, and biologically-inspired motor control was essential\nfor the model to correctly replicate infant behavior. This suggests that these\ncomponents are also involved in infants' sensorimotor learning.",

QoE of YouTube\nreflects the smooth streaming session without any buffering and quality shift\nevents. One of the most important factors nowadays affecting QoE of YouTube is\nfrequent shifts from higher to lower resolutions and vice versa. These shifts\nensure a smooth streaming session; however, it might get a lower mean opinion\nscore. For instance, dropping from 1080p to 480p during a video can preserve\ncontinuity but might reduce the viewers enjoyment. Over time, OTT platforms are\nlooking for alternative ways to boost user experience instead of relying on\ntraditional Quality of Service (QoS) metrics such as bandwidth, latency, and\nthroughput. As a result, we look into the relationship between quality shifting\nin YouTube streaming sessions and the channel metrics RSRP, RSRQ, and SNR. Our\nfindings state that these channel metrics positively correlate with shifts.\nThus, in real-time, OTT can only rely on them to predict video streaming\nsessions into lower- and higher-resolution categories, thus providing more\nresources to improve user experience. Using traditional Machine Learning (ML)\nclassifiers, we achieved an accuracy of 77-percent, while using only RSRP,\nRSRQ, and SNR.

    "abstract": "The hematology analytics used for detection and classification of small blood\ncomponents is a significant challenge. In particular, when objects exists as\nsmall pixel-sized entities in a large context of similar objects. Deep learning\napproaches using supervised models with pre-trained weights, such as residual\nnetworks and vision transformers have demonstrated success for many\napplications. Unfortunately, when applied to images outside the domain of\nlearned representations, these methods often result with less than acceptable\nperformance. A strategy to overcome this can be achieved by using\nself-supervised models, where representations are learned and weights are then\napplied for downstream applications. Recently, masked autoencoders have proven\nto be effective to obtain representations that captures global context\ninformation. By masking regions of an image and having the model learn to\nreconstruct both the masked and non-masked regions, weights can be used for\nvarious applications. However, if the sizes of the objects in images are less\nthan the size of the mask, the global context information is lost, making it\nalmost impossible to reconstruct the image. In this study, we investigated the\neffect of mask ratios and patch sizes for blood components using a MAE to\nobtain learned ViT encoder representations. We then applied the encoder weights\nto train a U-Net Transformer for semantic segmentation to obtain both local and\nglobal contextual information. Our experimental results demonstrates that both\nsmaller mask ratios and patch sizes improve the reconstruction of images using\na MAE. We also show the results of semantic segmentation with and without\npre-trained weights, where smaller-sized blood components benefited with\npre-training. Overall, our proposed method offers an efficient and effective\nstrategy for the segmentation and classification of small objects.",

This paper is a\nfirst step towards understanding what Strichartz estimates are achievable for\nthe aforementioned equation. Our object of study is the corresponding\nlinearized problem in a model case, in which our domain is represented by the\nupper half-space.

In this study, we examined the\nunderlying mechanisms responsible for the generation of recurrent chromospheric\nfan-shaped jets utilizing data from the Goode Solar Telescope (GST) at Big Bear\nSolar Observatory, along with data from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA)\nand the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) onboard the Solar Dynamic\nObservatory (SDO). These jets appear as dark elongated structures in H$\\alpha$\nwing images, persist for over an hour, and are located in the intergranular\nlanes between a pair of same-polarity sunspots. Our analysis reveals that\nmagnetic flux cancellation at the jet base plays a crucial role in their\nformation. HMI line-of-sight magnetograms show a gradual decrease in\nopposite-polarity fluxes spanning the sequence of jets in H$\\alpha$ - 0.8\nangstrom images, suggesting that recurrent magnetic reconnection, likely driven\nby recurrent miniature flux-rope eruptions that are built up and triggered by\nflux cancellation, powers these jets. Additionally, magnetic field\nextrapolations reveal a 3D magnetic null-point topology at the jet formation\nsite $\\sim$1.25 Mm height. Furthermore, we observed strong brightening in AIA\n304 angstrom channel above the neutral line. Based on our observations and\nextrapolation results, we propose that these recurrent chromospheric fan-shaped\njets align with the minifilament eruption model previously proposed for coronal\njets.

This\nstudy provides estimates of energy partition based on a statistical analysis of\nmagnetic reconnection events in Earth's magnetotail using data from the\nMagnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission. Ions are up to ten times more\nenergetic than electrons but have softer spectra.

    "abstract": "The increasing adoption of approximate computing in deep neural network\naccelerators (AxDNNs) promises significant energy efficiency gains.

Traditional fault detection and\nmitigation approaches, while effective for AccDNNs, introduce substantial\noverhead and latency, making them impractical for energy-constrained real-time\ndeployment. To address this, we introduce EPSILON, a lightweight framework that\nleverages pre-computed statistical signatures and layer-wise importance metrics\nfor efficient fault detection and mitigation in AxDNNs. Our framework\nintroduces a novel non-parametric pattern-matching algorithm that enables\nconstant-time fault detection without interrupting normal execution while\ndynamically adapting to different network architectures and fault patterns.\nEPSILON maintains model accuracy by intelligently adjusting mitigation\nstrategies based on a statistical analysis of weight distribution and layer\ncriticality while preserving the energy benefits of approximate computing.\nExtensive evaluations across various approximate multipliers, AxDNN\narchitectures, popular datasets (MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet-1k), and\nfault scenarios demonstrate that EPSILON maintains 80.05\\% accuracy while\noffering 22\\% improvement in inference time and 28\\% improvement in energy\nefficiency, establishing EPSILON as a practical solution for deploying reliable\nAxDNNs in safety-critical edge applications.",

    "abstract": "Long-term time series forecasting plays a pivotal role in various real-world\napplications. Despite recent advancements and the success of different\narchitectures, forecasting is often challenging due to non-stationary nature of\nthe real-world data, which frequently exhibit distribution shifts and temporal\nchanges in statistical properties like mean and variance over time. Previous\nstudies suggest that this inherent variability complicates forecasting,\nlimiting the performance of many models by leading to loss of non-stationarity\nand resulting in over-stationarization (Liu, Wu, Wang and Long, 2022). To\naddress this challenge, we introduce a novel architecture, ChoronoAdaptive\nNetwork (CANet), inspired by style-transfer techniques. The core of CANet is\nthe Non-stationary Adaptive Normalization module, seamlessly integrating the\nStyle Blending Gate and Adaptive Instance Normalization (AdaIN) (Huang and\nBelongie, 2017). The Style Blending Gate preserves and reintegrates\nnon-stationary characteristics, such as mean and standard deviation, by\nblending internal and external statistics, preventing over-stationarization\nwhile maintaining essential temporal dependencies. Coupled with AdaIN, which\ndynamically adapts the model to statistical changes, this approach enhances\npredictive accuracy under non-stationary conditions. CANet also employs\nmulti-resolution patching to handle short-term fluctuations and long-term\ntrends, along with Fourier analysis-based adaptive thresholding to reduce\nnoise. A Stacked Kronecker Product Layer further optimizes the model's\nefficiency while maintaining high performance. Extensive experiments on\nreal-world datasets validate CANet's superiority over state-of-the-art methods,\nachieving a 42% reduction in MSE and a 22% reduction in MAE.

The\ninversion method based on real-time measurement of acoustic field data improves\noperational efficiency, but loses the accuracy of SSP estimation and suffers\nfrom limited spatial applicability due to its stringent requirements for ocean\nobservation infrastructure. To achieve accurate long-term ocean SSP estimation\nindependent of real-time underwater data measurements, we propose a\nSemi-Transformer neural network (STNet) specifically designed for simulating\nsound velocity distribution patterns from the perspective of time series\nprediction. The proposed network architecture incorporates an optimized\nself-attention mechanism to effectively capture long-range temporal\ndependencies within historical sound velocity time-series data, facilitating\naccurate estimation of current SSPs or prediction of future SSPs. Through\narchitectural optimization of the Transformer framework and integration of a\ntime encoding mechanism, STNet could effectively improve computational\nefficiency.

    "abstract": "Physical inactivity significantly contributes to obesity and other\nnon-communicable diseases, yet efforts to increase population-wide physical\nactivity levels have met with limited success. The built environment plays a\npivotal role in encouraging active behaviors like walking. Walkability indices,\nwhich aggregate various environmental features, provide a valuable tool for\npromoting healthy, walkable environments. However, a standardized,\nhigh-resolution walkability index for Europe has been lacking. This study\naddresses that gap by developing a standardized, high-resolution walkability\nindex for the entire European region. Seven core components were selected to\ndefine walkability: walkable street length, intersection density, green spaces,\nslope, public transport access, land use mix, and 15-minute walking isochrones.\nThese were derived from harmonized, high-resolution datasets such as\nSentinel-2, NASA's elevation models, OpenStreetMap, and CORINE Land Cover. A\n100 m x 100 m hierarchical grid system and advanced geospatial methods, like\nnetwork buffers and distance decay, were used at scale to efficiently model\nreal-world density and proximity effects. The resulting index was weighted by\npopulation and analyzed at different spatial levels using visual mapping,\nspatial clustering, and correlation analysis. Findings revealed a distinct\nurban-to-rural gradient, with high walkability scores concentrated in compact\nurban centers rich in street connectivity and land use diversity. The index\nhighlighted cities like Barcelona, Berlin, Munich, Paris, and Warsaw as\nwalkability leaders. This standardized, high-resolution walkability index\nserves as a practical tool for researchers, planners, and policymakers aiming\nto support active living and public health across diverse European contexts.",

The critical kinetic energy value is identified,\ncorresponding to the maximum supercurrent that can flow in the thin film. The\npeak in supercurrent density as a function of the Cooper pairs' kinetic energy\narises from the interplay between the increase in supercurrent due to increased\nkinetic energy and the depairing effect when the kinetic energy becomes\nsufficiently large. The critical value of the pair's kinetic energy is\nsubsequently employed to estimate the critical value of an external electric\nfield required to suppress superconductivity in the sample. This estimation is\nin parameter-free agreement with the experimental observations.

Terrain-aware motion planners use an\nestimate of the vehicle roll and pitch as a function of pose, vehicle\nsuspension, and ground elevation map to weigh the cost of edges in the search\nspace. Encoding such information in a traditional two-dimensional cost map is\nlimiting because it is unable to capture the influence of orientation on the\nroll and pitch estimates from sloped terrain. The research presented herein\naddresses this problem by encoding kinodynamic information in the edges of a\nrecombinant motion planning search space based on the Efficiently Adaptive\nState Lattice (EASL). This approach, which we describe as a Kinodynamic\nEfficiently Adaptive State Lattice (KEASL), differs from the prior\nrepresentation in two ways. First, this method uses a novel encoding of\nvelocity and acceleration constraints and vehicle direction at expanded nodes\nin the motion planning graph. Second, this approach describes additional steps\nfor evaluating the roll, pitch, constraints, and velocities associated with\nposes along each edge during search in a manner that still enables the graph to\nremain recombinant. Velocities are computed using an iterative bidirectional\nmethod using Eulerian integration that more accurately estimates the duration\nof edges that are subject to terrain-dependent velocity limits. Real-world\nexperiments on a Clearpath Robotics Warthog Unmanned Ground Vehicle were\nperformed in a non-flat, unstructured environment. Results from 2093 planning\nqueries from these experiments showed that KEASL provided a more efficient\nroute than EASL in 83.72% of cases when EASL plans were adjusted to satisfy\nterrain-dependent velocity constraints.

It is unclear if and how seizure severity is\nmodulated over longer timescales. Characterising seizure severity variability\nover time could lead to tailored treatments. In this study, we test if\ncontinuously-recorded interictal intracranial EEG (iEEG) features encapsulate\nsignatures of such modulations.\n  Methods We analysed 20 subjects with iEEG recordings of at least one day. We\nidentified cycles on timescales of hours to days embedded in long-term iEEG\nband power and associated them with seizure severity, which we approximated\nusing seizure duration. In order to quantify these associations, we created\nlinear-circular statistical models of seizure duration that incorporated\ndifferent band power cycles within each subject.\n  Findings In most subjects, seizure duration was weakly to moderately\ncorrelated with individual band power cycles. Combinations of multiple band\npower cycles significantly explained most of the variability in seizure\nduration. Specifically, we found 70% of the models had a higher than 60%\nadjusted $R^2$ across all subjects. From these models, around 80% were deemed\nto be above chance-level (p-value < 0.05) based on permutation tests. Models\nincluded cycles of ultradian, circadian and slower timescales in a\nsubject-specific manner.\n  Interpretation These results suggest that seizure severity, as measured by\nseizure duration, may be modulated over timescales of minutes to days by\nsubject-specific cycles in interictal iEEG signal properties.

QuantBench offers\nthree key strengths: (1) standardization that aligns with quantitative\ninvestment industry practices, (2) flexibility to integrate various AI\nalgorithms, and (3) full-pipeline coverage of the entire quantitative\ninvestment process. Our empirical studies using QuantBench reveal some critical\nresearch directions, including the need for continual learning to address\ndistribution shifts, improved methods for modeling relational financial data,\nand more robust approaches to mitigate overfitting in low signal-to-noise\nenvironments. By providing a common ground for evaluation and fostering\ncollaboration between researchers and practitioners, QuantBench aims to\naccelerate progress in AI for quantitative investment, similar to the impact of\nbenchmark platforms in computer vision and natural language processing.",

    "abstract": "This paper concerns corpus poisoning attacks in dense information retrieval,\nwhere an adversary attempts to compromise the ranking performance of a search\nalgorithm by injecting a small number of maliciously generated documents into\nthe corpus. Our work addresses two limitations in the current literature.\nFirst, attacks that perform adversarial gradient-based word substitution search\ndo so in the discrete lexical space, while retrieval itself happens in the\ncontinuous embedding space. We thus propose an optimization method that\noperates in the embedding space directly. Specifically, we train a perturbation\nmodel with the objective of maintaining the geometric distance between the\noriginal and adversarial document embeddings, while also maximizing the\ntoken-level dissimilarity between the original and adversarial documents.\nSecond, it is common for related work to have a strong assumption that the\nadversary has prior knowledge about the queries. In this paper, we focus on a\nmore challenging variant of the problem where the adversary assumes no prior\nknowledge about the query distribution (hence, unsupervised). Our core\ncontribution is an adversarial corpus attack that is fast and effective. We\npresent comprehensive experimental results on both in- and out-of-domain\ndatasets, focusing on two related tasks: a top-1 attack and a corpus poisoning\nattack. We consider attacks under both a white-box and a black-box setting.\nNotably, our method can generate successful adversarial examples in under two\nminutes per target document; four times faster compared to the fastest\ngradient-based word substitution methods in the literature with the same\nhardware. Furthermore, our adversarial generation method generates text that is\nmore likely to occur under the distribution of natural text (low perplexity),\nand is therefore more difficult to detect.",

Using a discrete-time analogue of the classical Feynman--Kac\nformula, we obtain two-sided estimates for the $n$-step heat kernels $u_n(x,y)$\nof the perturbed chain. These estimates are of the form $u_n(x,y)\\asymp\n\\lambda_0^n\\phi_0(x)\\widehat\\phi_0(y)+F_n(x,y)$, where $\\phi_0$ (and\n$\\widehat\\phi_0$) are the (dual) eigenfunctions for the lowest eigenvalue\n$\\lambda_0$; the perturbation $F_n(x,y)$ is explicitly given, and it vanishes\nif either $x$ or $y$ is in a bounded set. The key assumptions are that the\nchain is uniformly lazy and that the \\enquote{direct step property} (DSP) is\nsatisfied. This means that the chain is more likely to move from state $x$ to\nstate $y$ in a single step rather than in two or more steps. Starting from the\nform of the heat kernel estimate, we define the intrinsic (or ground-state\ntransformed) chains and we introduce time-dependent ultracontractivity notions\n-- asymptotic and progressive intrinsic ultracontractivity -- which we can link\nto the growth behaviour of the confining potential; this allows us to consider\narbitrarily slow growing potentials.

Due to data drift, any model built on the past training data\nbecomes less relevant and inaccurate over time. Thus, detecting and controlling\nfor data drift is critical in machine learning models. Hierarchical Temporal\nMemory (HTM) is a machine learning model developed by Jeff Hawkins, inspired by\nhow the human brain processes information. It is a biologically inspired model\nof memory that is similar in structure to the neocortex, and whose performance\nis claimed to be comparable to state of the art models in detecting anomalies\nin time series data. Another unique benefit of HTMs is its independence from\ntraining and testing cycle; all the learning takes place online with streaming\ndata and no separate training and testing cycle is required. In sequential\nlearning paradigm, Sequential Probability Ratio Test (SPRT) offers some unique\nbenefit for online learning and inference. This paper proposes a novel hybrid\nframework combining HTM and SPRT for real-time data drift detection and anomaly\nidentification. Unlike existing data drift methods, our approach eliminates\nfrequent retraining and ensures low false positive rates. HTMs currently work\nwith one dimensional or univariate data.

To tackle these issues, in this paper\nwe suggest a new method of high-dimensional manifold-based SOFAR inference for\nlatent responses (SOFARI-R), where two variants of SOFARI-R are introduced. The\nfirst variant deals with strongly orthogonal factors by coupling left singular\nvectors with the design matrix and then appropriately rescaling them to\ngenerate new Stiefel manifolds. The second variant handles the more general\nweakly orthogonal factors by employing the hard-thresholded SOFARI estimates\nand delicately incorporating approximation errors into the distribution. Both\nvariants produce bias-corrected estimators for the latent right factor vectors\nthat enjoy asymptotically normal distributions with justified asymptotic\nvariance estimates. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the newly suggested\nmethod using extensive simulation studies and an economic application.",

    "abstract": "Multiparameter quantum estimation theory is crucial for many applications\ninvolving infinite-dimensional Gaussian quantum systems, since they can\ndescribe many physical platforms, e.g., quantum optical and optomechanical\nsystems and atomic ensembles. In the multiparameter setting, the most\nfundamental estimation error (quantified by the trace of the estimator\ncovariance matrix) is given by the Holevo Cram\\'er-Rao bound (HCRB), which\ntakes into account the asymptotic detrimental impact of measurement\nincompatibility on the simultaneous estimation of parameters encoded in a\nquantum state. However, the difficulty of evaluating the HCRB for\ninfinite-dimensional systems weakens the practicality of applying this tool in\nrealistic scenarios. In this paper, we introduce an efficient numerical method\nto evaluate the HCRB for general Gaussian states, by solving a semidefinite\nprogram involving only the covariance matrix and first moment vector and their\nparametric derivatives. This approach follows similar techniques developed for\nfinite-dimensional systems, and hinges on a phase-space evaluation of inner\nproducts between observables that are at most quadratic in the canonical\nbosonic operators. From this vantage point, we can also understand symmetric\nand right logarithmic derivative scalar Cram\\'er-Rao bounds under the same\ncommon framework, showing how they can similarly be evaluated as semidefinite\nprograms. To exemplify the relevance and applicability of this methodology, we\nconsider two paradigmatic applications, where the parameter dependence appears\nboth in the first moments and in the covariance matrix of Gaussian states:\nestimation of phase and loss, and estimation of squeezing and displacement.",

    "abstract": "Ergodic coverage effectively generates exploratory behaviors for embodied\nagents by aligning the spatial distribution of the agent's trajectory with a\ntarget distribution, where the difference between these two distributions is\nmeasured by the ergodic metric. However, existing ergodic coverage methods are\nconstrained by the limited set of ergodic metrics available for control\nsynthesis, fundamentally limiting their performance. In this work, we propose\nan alternative approach to ergodic coverage based on flow matching, a technique\nwidely used in generative inference for efficient and scalable sampling. We\nformally derive the flow matching problem for ergodic coverage and show that it\nis equivalent to a linear quadratic regulator problem with a closed-form\nsolution. Our formulation enables alternative ergodic metrics from generative\ninference that overcome the limitations of existing ones. These metrics were\npreviously infeasible for control synthesis but can now be supported with no\ncomputational overhead. Specifically, flow matching with the Stein variational\ngradient flow enables control synthesis directly over the score function of the\ntarget distribution, improving robustness to the unnormalized distributions; on\nthe other hand, flow matching with the Sinkhorn divergence flow enables an\noptimal transport-based ergodic metric, improving coverage performance on\nnon-smooth distributions with irregular supports. We validate the improved\nperformance and competitive computational efficiency of our method through\ncomprehensive numerical benchmarks and across different nonlinear dynamics. We\nfurther demonstrate the practicality of our method through a series of drawing\nand erasing tasks on a Franka robot.",

    "abstract": "We study color fault-tolerant (CFT) network design problems: Given an\n$n$-vertex graph $G$ whose edges are arbitrarily colored (with no ``legality''\nrestrictions), the goal is to find a sparse subgraph $H$ such that, when any\ncolor fault causes all edges of some color $c$ to crash, the surviving subgraph\n$H-c$ remains ``similar'' to the surviving graph $G-c$. The similarity is\nproblem-dependent, usually pertaining to distance preserving. If each color\nclass has size $\\Delta$ or less, a brute-force approach can disregard the\ncolors and take $H$ to be $\\Delta$-edge fault-tolerant ($\\Delta$-EFT), so that\n$H-F$ is similar to $G-F$ for every set $F$ of $\\leq \\Delta$ edges. We ask if\nthe colors can be utilized to provide a sparser $H$.\n  Our main results concern CFT sourcewise distance preservers, where there is a\ngiven set $S \\subseteq V$ of $\\sigma$ sources, and all $S \\times V$ distances\nshould be exactly equal in $H-c$ and in $G-c$. We give nearly-tight upper and\nlower bounds of $\\tilde{\\Theta} (n^{2-1/(\\Delta+1)} \\cdot\n\\sigma^{1/(\\Delta+1)})$ on the worst-case size of such preservers. The\ncorresponding $\\Delta$-EFT problem admits the same lower bound, but the\nstate-of-the-art upper bound for $\\Delta\\geq 3$ is $\\tilde{O}(n^{2-1/2^\\Delta}\n\\cdot \\sigma^{1/2^\\Delta})$. Our approach also leads to new and arguably\nsimpler constructions that recover these $\\Delta$-EFT bounds and shed some\nlight on their current gaps.\n  We provide additional results along these lines, showcasing problems where\nthe color structure helps or does not help sparsification. For preserving the\ndistance between a single pair of vertices after a color fault, the brute-force\napproach via $\\Delta$-EFT is shown to be suboptimal. In contrast, for\npreserving reachability from a single source in a directed graph, it is\n(worst-case) optimal.",

    "abstract": "The Cosmic Dawn Survey Pre-launch (PL) catalogues cover an effective 10.13\ndeg$^{2}$ area with uniform deep Spitzer/IRAC data ($m\\sim25$ mag, 5$\\sigma$),\nthe largest area covered to these depths in the infrared. These data are used\nto gain new insight into the growth of stellar mass across cosmic history by\ncharacterising the evolution of the galaxy stellar mass function (GSMF) through\n$0.2 < z \\leq 6.5$. The total volume (0.62 Gpc$^{3}$) represents a tenfold\nincrease compared to previous works that have explored $z > 3$ and\nsignificantly reduces cosmic variance, yielding strong constraints on the\nabundance of massive galaxies. Results are generally consistent with the\nliterature but now provide firm estimates of number density where only upper\nlimits were previously available. Contrasting the GSMF with the dark matter\nhalo mass function suggests that massive galaxies ($M \\gtrsim10^{11}$\nM$_{\\odot}$) at $z > 3.5$ required integrated star-formation efficiencies of\n$M/(M_{\\rm h}f_{\\rm b}) \\gtrsim$ 0.25--0.5, in excess of the commonly-held view\nof ``universal peak efficiency\" from studies on the stellar-to-halo mass\nrelation (SHMR). Such increased efficiencies imply an evolving peak in the SHMR\nat $z > 3.5$ which can be maintained if feedback mechanisms from active\ngalactic nuclei and stellar processes are ineffective at early times. In\naddition, a significant fraction of the most massive quiescent galaxies are\nobserved to be in place already by $z\\sim 2.5$--3. The apparent lack in change\nof their number density by $z\\sim 0.2$ is consistent with relatively little\nmass growth from mergers. Utilising the unique volume, evidence for an\nenvironmental dependence of the galaxy stellar mass function is found all the\nway through $z\\sim 3.5$ for the first time, though a more careful\ncharacterisation of the density field is ultimately required for confirmation.",

In this context, we can show that the distance between the\niterates and the set of zeros of the system decreases super-linearly.

The rapid\nadvancement of solid-state technologies has significantly improved qubit\nquality, including the time scales characterizing electrical operation,\nrelaxation, and dephasing. At this stage of development, understanding the\nrelations between the underlying spin-orbit coupling and experimental\nparameters, such as quantum dot geometry and external electric and magnetic\nfields, has become a priority. Here we focus on a Ge hole double quantum dot in\nthe Pauli spin blockade regime and present a complete analysis of the leakage\ncurrent under an out-of-plane magnetic field. By considering a model of\nanisotropic in-plane confinement and $k^3$-Rashba spin-orbit coupling, we\ndetermine the behaviour of the leakage current as a function of detuning,\nmagnetic field magnitude, interdot distance, and individual dot ellipticities.\nWe identify regions in which the leakage current can be suppressed by quantum\ndot geometry designs. Most importantly, by rotating one of the quantum dots, we\nobserve that the quantum dot shape induces a strongly anisotropic leakage\ncurrent. These findings provide guidelines for probing the spin-orbit coupling,\nenhancing the signal-to-noise ratio, and improving the precision of Pauli spin\nblockade readout in hole qubit architectures.",

    "abstract": "For the same quantum field theory distinct effective actions can be obtained\nby coupling sources to different choices of field variables. This is the same\nas considering effective actions for theories related by a change of variables\nand thus differ only by the values of so called inessential couplings. The\neffective actions will appear quite different since they generate correlation\nfunctions of different operators. Here we show that the effective actions are\nrelated by an implicit change of variables of the mean field, i.e. the argument\nof the effective action. Conversely, one can go the other way: by making a\nchange of variables of the mean variable we obtain a new effective action which\ngenerates correlation functions of an implicitly defined composite field. The\nexistence of the implicit transformations in both cases rests on the existence\nof solutions to initial value problems where the ``time'' parameter is an\ninessential coupling. Non-perturbatively the solutions may only exist for some\nnon-zero amount of this time. However, at each order in perturbation theory one\nobtains linear equations which implies that unique solutions exist. We then\nshow that scattering amplitudes are independent of inessential couplings\nwithout use of perturbation theory. For gauge theories we expect our\ncorrespondence to extend to effective actions which differ by a choice of\ngauge.",

The origin and connection of\nphosphorus-bearing molecules to early Solar system objects and star-forming\nmolecular clouds is therefore of great interest, yet there are limited\nobservations throughout different stages of low-mass ($M < $ a few M$_\\odot$)\nstar formation. Observations from the Yebes 40 m and IRAM 30 m telescopes\ndetect for the first time in the 7mm, 3mm, and 2mm bands multiple transitions\nof PN and PO, as well as a single transition of PO$^{+}$, toward a low-mass\nstarless core. The presence of PN, PO and PO$^{+}$ is kinematically correlated\nwith bright SiO(1-0) emission. Our results reveal not only that shocks are the\nmain driver of releasing phosphorus from dust grains and into the gas-phase,\nbut that the emission originates from gas not affiliated with the shock itself,\nbut quiescent gas that has been shocked in the recent past. From radiative\ntransfer calculations, the PO/PN abundance ratio is found to be\n$3.1^{+0.4}_{-0.6}$, consistent with other high-mass and low-mass star-forming\nregions. This first detection of PO$^{+}$ toward any low-mass star-forming\nregion reveals a PO$^{+}$/PO ratio of $0.0115^{+0.0008}_{-0.0009}$, a factor of\nten lower than previously determined from observations of a Galactic Center\nmolecular cloud, suggesting its formation can occur under more standard\nGalactic cosmic-ray ionization rates.

    "abstract": "We propose a method for constructing quantum error-correcting codes based on\nnon-binary low-density parity-check codes with Tanner graph girth 16. While\nconventional constructions using circulant permutation matrices are limited to\ngirth 12, our method employs affine permutation matrices and a randomized\nsequential selection procedure to eliminate short cycles and achieve girth 16.\n  Numerical experiments show that the proposed codes significantly reduce the\nnumber of low-weight codewords. Joint belief propagation decoding over\ndepolarizing channels reveals that although a slight degradation appears in the\nwaterfall region, a substantial improvement is achieved in the error floor\nperformance.\n  We also evaluated the minimum distance and found that the proposed codes\nachieve a larger upper bound compared to conventional constructions.",

    "abstract": "Autoregressive (AR) models, long dominant in language generation, are\nincreasingly applied to image synthesis but are often considered less\ncompetitive than Diffusion-based models. A primary limitation is the\nsubstantial number of image tokens required for AR models, which constrains\nboth training and inference efficiency, as well as image resolution. To address\nthis, we present Token-Shuffle, a novel yet simple method that reduces the\nnumber of image tokens in Transformer. Our key insight is the dimensional\nredundancy of visual vocabularies in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs),\nwhere low-dimensional visual codes from visual encoder are directly mapped to\nhigh-dimensional language vocabularies. Leveraging this, we consider two key\noperations: token-shuffle, which merges spatially local tokens along channel\ndimension to decrease the input token number, and token-unshuffle, which\nuntangles the inferred tokens after Transformer blocks to restore the spatial\narrangement for output. Jointly training with textual prompts, our strategy\nrequires no additional pretrained text-encoder and enables MLLMs to support\nextremely high-resolution image synthesis in a unified next-token prediction\nway while maintaining efficient training and inference. For the first time, we\npush the boundary of AR text-to-image generation to a resolution of 2048x2048\nwith gratifying generation performance. In GenAI-benchmark, our 2.7B model\nachieves 0.77 overall score on hard prompts, outperforming AR models LlamaGen\nby 0.18 and diffusion models LDM by 0.15. Exhaustive large-scale human\nevaluations also demonstrate our prominent image generation ability in terms of\ntext-alignment, visual flaw, and visual appearance. We hope that Token-Shuffle\ncan serve as a foundational design for efficient high-resolution image\ngeneration within MLLMs.",

    "abstract": "Outsourcing the ML training to cloud providers presents a compelling\nopportunity for resource constrained clients, while it simultaneously bears\ninherent privacy risks, especially for highly sensitive training data. We\nintroduce Silenzio, the first fully non-interactive outsourcing scheme for the\ntraining of multi-layer perceptrons that achieves 128 bit security using FHE.\nUnlike traditional MPC based protocols that necessitate interactive\ncommunication between the client and server(s) or non-collusion assumptions\namong multiple servers, Silenzio enables the fire-and-forget paradigm without\nsuch assumptions. In this approach, the client encrypts the training data once,\nand the cloud server performs the training without any further interaction.\n  Silenzio operates over low bitwidth integers - never exceeding 8 bit - to\nmitigate the computational overhead of FHE. Our approach features a novel\nlow-bitwidth matrix multiplication that leverages input-dependent residue\nnumber systems and a Karatsuba-inspired multiplication routine, ensuring that\nno intermediate FHE-processed value overflows 8 bit. Starting from an\nRNS-to-MRNS conversion process, we propose an efficient block-scaling\nmechanism, which approximately shifts encrypted tensor values to the\nuser-specified most significant bits. To instantiate the backpropagation of the\nerror, Silenzio introduces a low-bitwidth and TFHE friendly gradient\ncomputation for the cross entropy loss.\n  Implemented using the state-of-the-art Concrete library, we evaluate Silenzio\non standard MLP training tasks regarding runtime as well as model performance\nand achieve similar classification accuracy as MLPs trained using standard\nPyTorch with 32 bit floating-point computations. Our open-source implementation\nrepresents a significant advancement in privacy-preserving ML, providing a new\nbaseline for secure and non-interactive outsourced MLP training.",

At the extremes are Bernal (or ``ABAB...'')\nstacking, where the direction of the interlayer shift alternates with each\nlayer, and rhombohedral (or ``ABCABC...'') stacking order where the shifts are\nalways in the same direction. However, for an N-layer system, there are in\nprinciple $N-1$ unique metastable stacking orders of this type. Recently, it\nhas become clear that stacking order has a strong effect on the low energy\nelectronic band structure with single-layer shifts completely altering the\nelectronic properties.

    "abstract": "Bimanual manipulation is a challenging yet crucial robotic capability,\ndemanding precise spatial localization and versatile motion trajectories, which\npose significant challenges to existing approaches. Existing approaches fall\ninto two categories: keyframe-based strategies, which predict gripper poses in\nkeyframes and execute them via motion planners, and continuous control methods,\nwhich estimate actions sequentially at each timestep. The keyframe-based method\nlacks inter-frame supervision, struggling to perform consistently or execute\ncurved motions, while the continuous method suffers from weaker spatial\nperception. To address these issues, this paper introduces an end-to-end\nframework PPI (keyPose and Pointflow Interface), which integrates the\nprediction of target gripper poses and object pointflow with the continuous\nactions estimation. These interfaces enable the model to effectively attend to\nthe target manipulation area, while the overall framework guides diverse and\ncollision-free trajectories. By combining interface predictions with continuous\nactions estimation, PPI demonstrates superior performance in diverse bimanual\nmanipulation tasks, providing enhanced spatial localization and satisfying\nflexibility in handling movement restrictions. In extensive evaluations, PPI\nsignificantly outperforms prior methods in both simulated and real-world\nexperiments, achieving state-of-the-art performance with a +16.1% improvement\non the RLBench2 simulation benchmark and an average of +27.5% gain across four\nchallenging real-world tasks.

We\nshed light on the matter by identifying the Fourier scales, density scales, and\nmorphological features of the cosmic web that CNNs pay most attention to. We\nfind that CNNs extract cosmological information from both high and low density\nregions: overdense regions provide the most information per pixel, while\nunderdense regions -- particularly deep voids and their surroundings --\ncontribute significantly due to their large spatial extent and coherent spatial\nfeatures. Remarkably, we demonstrate that there is negligible degradation in\ncosmological constraining power after aggressive cutting in both maximum\nFourier scale and density.

State-of-the-art approaches for this task are rule-based,\nbut these methods do not scale to the long tail. RL, on the other hand, is\nscalable and does not suffer from compounding errors like imitation learning.\nContemporary RL approaches for driving use complex shaped rewards that sum\nmultiple individual rewards, \\eg~progress, position, or orientation rewards. We\nshow that PPO fails to optimize a popular version of these rewards when the\nmini-batch size is increased, which limits the scalability of these approaches.\nInstead, we propose a new reward design based primarily on optimizing a single\nintuitive reward term: route completion. Infractions are penalized by\nterminating the episode or multiplicatively reducing route completion. We find\nthat PPO scales well with higher mini-batch sizes when trained with our simple\nreward, even improving performance. Training with large mini-batch sizes\nenables efficient scaling via distributed data parallelism. We scale PPO to\n300M samples in CARLA and 500M samples in nuPlan with a single 8-GPU node. The\nresulting model achieves 64 DS on the CARLA longest6 v2 benchmark,\noutperforming other RL methods with more complex rewards by a large margin.\nRequiring only minimal adaptations from its use in CARLA, the same method is\nthe best learning-based approach on nuPlan. It scores 91.3 in non-reactive and\n90.6 in reactive traffic on the Val14 benchmark while being an order of\nmagnitude faster than prior work.",

Statistical noise inevitably\narises in real settings of quantum reservoir computing (QRC) due to the\npractical necessity of taking a small to moderate number of measurements. We\ninvestigate the effect of statistical noise in spin-network QRC on the possible\nperformance benefits conferred by quantumness. As our measures of quantumness,\nwe employ both quantum entanglement, which we quantify by the partial transpose\nof the density matrix, and coherence, which we quantify as the sum of the\nabsolute values of the off-diagonal elements of the density matrix. We find\nthat reservoirs which enjoy a finite degree of quantum entanglement and\ncoherence are more stable against the adverse effects of statistical noise on\nperformance compared to their unentangled, incoherent counterparts.

Given a positive distance function\n$D:\\binom{V}{2}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}_{>0}$, the goal is to find a tree (or\nultrametric) $T$ including all elements of set $V$ such that the difference\nbetween the distances among vertices in $T$ and those specified by $D$ is\nminimized. In this paper, we initiate the study of ultrametric and tree metric\nfitting problems in the semi-streaming model, where the distances between pairs\nof elements from $V$ (with $|V|=n$), defined by the function $D$, can arrive in\nan arbitrary order. We study these problems under various distance norms:\n  For the $\\ell_0$ objective, we provide a single-pass polynomial-time\n$\\tilde{O}(n)$-space $O(1)$ approximation algorithm for ultrametrics and prove\nthat no single-pass exact algorithm exists, even with exponential time.\n  Next, we show that the algorithm for $\\ell_0$ implies an $O(\\Delta/\\delta)$\napproximation for the $\\ell_1$ objective, where $\\Delta$ is the maximum and\n$\\delta$ is the minimum absolute difference between distances in the input.\nThis bound matches the best-known approximation for the RAM model using a\ncombinatorial algorithm when $\\Delta/\\delta=O(n)$.\n  For the $\\ell_\\infty$ objective, we provide a complete characterization of\nthe ultrametric fitting problem. We present a single-pass polynomial-time\n$\\tilde{O}(n)$-space 2-approximation algorithm and show that no better than\n2-approximation is possible, even with exponential time. We also show that,\nwith an additional pass, it is possible to achieve a polynomial-time exact\nalgorithm for ultrametrics.\n  Finally, we extend the results for all these objectives to tree metrics by\nusing only one additional pass through the stream and without asymptotically\nincreasing the approximation factor.",

The ensemble Kalman\nfilter (EnKF) approximates this mean-field model with an ensemble of\ninteracting particles, employing a Gaussian ansatz for the joint distribution\nof the state and observation at each observation time. These methods are\nrobust, but the Gaussian ansatz limits accuracy. This shortcoming is addressed\nby approximating the mean-field evolution using a novel form of neural operator\ntaking probability distributions as input: a measure neural mapping (MNM). A\nMNM is used to design a novel approach to filtering, the MNM-enhanced ensemble\nfilter (MNMEF), which is defined in both the mean-field limit and for\ninteracting ensemble particle approximations. The ensemble approach uses\nempirical measures as input to the MNM and is implemented using the set\ntransformer, which is invariant to ensemble permutation and allows for\ndifferent ensemble sizes. The derivation of methods from a mean-field\nformulation allows a single parameterization of the algorithm to be deployed at\ndifferent ensemble sizes. In practice fine-tuning of a small number of\nparameters, for specific ensemble sizes, further enhances the accuracy of the\nscheme.

Here,\nwe displace the need for phenomenological arguments by rigorously deriving an\nextended LLG equation via Schwinger-Keldysh field theory (SKFT). Within such a\ntheory, light interacts with itinerant electrons, and then spin current carried\nby them exerts spin-transfer torque onto localized spins, so that when\nphotoexcited electrons are integrated out we arrive at a spin-only equation.\nUnlike the standard phenomenological LLG equation with local-in-time Gilbert\ndamping, our extended one contains a non-Markovian memory kernel whose plot\nwithin the plane of its two times variables exhibits fractal properties. By\napplying SKFT-derived extended LLG equation, as our central result, to a\nlight-driven ferromagnet as an example, we predict an optically induced\nmagnetic inertia term. Its magnitude is governed by spatially nonlocal and\ntime-dependent prefactor, leading to excitation of coherent magnons at sharp\nfrequencies in and outside of the band of incoherent (or thermal) magnons.",

    "abstract": "Sparse attention offers a promising strategy to extend long-context\ncapabilities in Transformer LLMs, yet its viability, its efficiency-accuracy\ntrade-offs, and systematic scaling studies remain unexplored. To address this\ngap, we perform a careful comparison of training-free sparse attention methods\nat varying model scales, sequence lengths, and sparsity levels on a diverse\ncollection of long-sequence tasks-including novel ones that rely on natural\nlanguage while remaining controllable and easy to evaluate. Based on our\nexperiments, we report a series of key findings: 1) an isoFLOPS analysis\nreveals that for very long sequences, larger and highly sparse models are\npreferable to smaller and dense ones. 2) The level of sparsity attainable while\nstatistically guaranteeing accuracy preservation is higher during decoding than\nprefilling, and correlates with model size in the former. 3) There is no clear\nstrategy that performs best across tasks and phases, with different units of\nsparsification or budget adaptivity needed for different scenarios. Even\nmoderate sparsity levels often result in significant performance degradation on\nat least one task, highlighting that sparse attention is not a universal\nsolution. 4) We introduce and validate novel scaling laws specifically tailored\nfor sparse attention, providing evidence that our findings are likely to hold\ntrue beyond our range of experiments. Through these insights, we demonstrate\nthat sparse attention is a key tool to enhance the capabilities of Transformer\nLLMs for processing longer sequences, but requires careful evaluation of\ntrade-offs for performance-sensitive applications.",

    "abstract": "Mass loss through stellar winds governs the evolution of stars on the\nasymptotic giant branch (AGB). In the case of carbon-rich AGB stars, the wind\nis believed to be driven by radiation pressure on amorphous carbon (amC) dust\nforming in the atmosphere. The choice of dust optical data will have a\nsignificant impact on atmosphere and wind models of AGB stars. We compare two\ncommonly used optical data sets of amC and investigate how the wind\ncharacteristics and photometric properties resulting from dynamical models of\ncarbon-rich AGB stars are influenced by the micro-physical properties of dust\ngrains. We computed two extensive grids of carbon star atmosphere and wind\nmodels with the DARWIN 1D radiation-hydrodynamical code. Each of the two grids\nuses a different amC optical data set. The stellar parameters of the models\nwere varied to cover a wide range of possible combinations. A posteriori\nradiative transfer calculations were performed for a sub-set of the models,\nresulting in photometric fluxes and colours. We find small, but systematic\ndifferences in the predicted mass-loss rates for the two grids. The grain sizes\nand photometric properties are affected by the different dust optical data\nsets. Higher absorption efficiency leads to the formation of a greater number\nof grains, which are smaller. Models that are obscured by dust exhibit\ndifferences in terms of the covered colour range compared to observations,\ndepending on the dust optical data used. An important motivation for this study\nwas to investigate how strongly the predicted mass-loss rates depend on the\nchoice of dust optical data, as these mass-loss values are more frequently used\nin stellar evolution models. Based on the current results, we conclude that\nmass-loss rates may typically differ by about a factor of two for DARWIN models\nof C-type AGB stars for commonly used dust optical data sets.",

    "abstract": "In the field of image recognition, spiking neural networks (SNNs) have\nachieved performance comparable to conventional artificial neural networks\n(ANNs).

This article focuses on an another\nalternative perspective,viewing SNNs as binary-activated recurrent neural\nnetworks (RNNs) for sequential modeling tasks. From this viewpoint, current SNN\narchitectures face several fundamental challenges in sequence modeling: (1)\nTraditional models lack effective memory mechanisms for long-range sequence\nmodeling; (2) The biological-inspired components in SNNs (such as reset\nmechanisms and refractory period applications) remain theoretically\nunder-explored for sequence tasks; (3) The RNN-like computational paradigm in\nSNNs prevents parallel training across different timesteps. To address these\nchallenges, this study conducts a systematic analysis of the fundamental\nmechanisms underlying reset operations and refractory periods in\nbinary-activated RNN-based SNN sequence models. We re-examine whether such\nbiological mechanisms are strictly necessary for generating sparse spiking\npatterns, provide new theoretical explanations and insights, and ultimately\npropose the fixed-refractory-period SNN architecture for sequence modeling.",

As the axion rolls down its potential, it dissipates energy in the gauge\nsector thus sourcing fluctuations of scalar and tensor degrees of freedom\ntherein. Gauge field fluctuations will, in turn, feed primordial gravitational\nwaves as well as curvature perturbations. Remarkably, we can use upcoming\ncosmological probes to test this mechanism across a vast range of scales, from\nthe CMB to laser interferometers. Due to their flat plateau at large field\nvalues, we find that PNI potentials fare better vis-\\'{a}-vis CMB observations\nthan the conventional sinusoidal potential of chromo-natural inflation (CNI).\nWe show that, even when the dynamics begin in the weak backreaction regime, the\nrolling of the axion leads to a build-up of the gauge-quanta production,\ninvariably triggering the strong backreaction of the gauge sector tensors on\nthe background dynamics. This transition results in the copious production of\nboth scalar and tensor perturbations, which we study in detail. The\ngravitational wave signatures include a rich peak structure with a\ncharacteristic scale-dependent chirality, a compelling target for future\ngravitational wave detectors. Additionally, the peak in scalar perturbations\nmay lead to the formation of primordial black holes, potentially accounting for\na significant fraction of the observed dark matter abundance.",

They have considered a wider range of models.\nThe fronts do not need to be monotone, but are subject of a spectral condition\ninstead. Most importantly the method allows for large perturbations, as long as\nthe heteroclinic conditions at $\\pm \\infty$ are met. That is, there is\nasymptotic attraction to the said fronts or equivalently the limit set consist\nof one point.\n  The purpose of this paper is to extend the results of \\cite{BBHY} by\nproviding explicit algebraic rates of convergence as $t\\to \\infty$. We\nbootstrap these results from the results in \\cite{BBHY} using additional energy\nestimates for two important examples namely KdV-Burgers and the fractional\nBurgers problem. These rates are likely not optimal, but we conjecture that\nthey are algebraic nonetheless.",

    "abstract": "Open clusters offer unique opportunities to study stellar dynamics and\nevolution under the influence of their internal gravity, the Milky Way's\ngravitational field, and the interactions with encounters. Using the Gaia DR3\ndata for a catalog of open clusters within 500 parsecs that exhibit tidal\nfeatures reported by the literature, we apply a novel method based on 3D\nprincipal component analysis to select a ``golden sample'' of nearby open\nclusters with minimal line-of-sight distortions. This approach ensures a\nsystematic comparison of 3D and 2D structural parameters for tidally perturbed\nclusters. The selected golden sample includes Blanco 1, Melotte 20, Melotte 22,\nNGC 2632, NGC 7092, NGC 1662, Roslund 6 and Melotte 111. We analyze these\nclusters by fitting both 2D and 3D King Profiles to their stellar density\ndistributions. Our results reveal systematic discrepancies: most of the golden\nsample clusters exhibit larger 3D tidal radii compared to their 2D\ncounterparts, demonstrating that the 2D projection effects bias the measured\ncluster size. Furthermore, the 3D density profiles show stronger deviations\nfrom King profiles at the tidal radii ($\\Delta \\rho_{\\rm 3D} > \\Delta \\rho_{\\rm\n2D}$), highlighting enhanced sensitivity to tidal disturbances. Additionally,\nwe investigate the spatial distribution of cluster members relative to their\nbulk motion in the Galactic plane. We find that some clusters exhibit tidal\nfeatures oriented perpendicular to their direction of motion, which can be\nattributed to the fact that the current surveys only detect the curved inner\nregions of the tidal features. In conclusion, this work offers a golden sample\nof nearby open clusters that are most reliable for 3D structure analysis and\nunderscores the necessity of 3D analysis in characterizing OC morphological\nasymmetries, determining cluster size, and identifying tidal features.",

Existing approaches typically rely on\nDegradation-specific models or coarse-grained degradation prompts to guide\nimage restoration. However, they lack fine-grained modeling of degradation\ninformation and face limitations in balancing multi-task conflicts. To overcome\nthese limitations, we propose DPMambaIR, a novel All-in-One image restoration\nframework. By integrating a Degradation-Aware Prompt State Space Model (DP-SSM)\nand a High-Frequency Enhancement Block (HEB), DPMambaIR enables fine-grained\nmodeling of complex degradation information and efficient global integration,\nwhile mitigating the loss of high-frequency details caused by task competition.\nSpecifically, the DP-SSM utilizes a pre-trained degradation extractor to\ncapture fine-grained degradation features and dynamically incorporates them\ninto the state space modeling process, enhancing the model's adaptability to\ndiverse degradation types. Concurrently, the HEB supplements high-frequency\ninformation, effectively addressing the loss of critical details, such as edges\nand textures, in multi-task image restoration scenarios. Extensive experiments\non a mixed dataset containing seven degradation types show that DPMambaIR\nachieves the best performance, with 27.69dB and 0.893 in PSNR and SSIM,\nrespectively. These results highlight the potential and superiority of\nDPMambaIR as a unified solution for All-in-One image restoration.",

    "abstract": "Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) have emerged as a powerful architecture for large\nlanguage models (LLMs), enabling efficient scaling of model capacity while\nmaintaining manageable computational costs. The key advantage lies in their\nability to route different tokens to different ``expert'' networks within the\nmodel, enabling specialization and efficient handling of diverse input.\nHowever, the vulnerabilities of MoE-based LLMs still have barely been studied,\nand the potential for backdoor attacks in this context remains largely\nunexplored. This paper presents the first backdoor attack against MoE-based\nLLMs where the attackers poison ``dormant experts'' (i.e., underutilized\nexperts) and activate them by optimizing routing triggers, thereby gaining\ncontrol over the model's output. We first rigorously prove the existence of a\nfew ``dominating experts'' in MoE models, whose outputs can determine the\noverall MoE's output. We also show that dormant experts can serve as dominating\nexperts to manipulate model predictions. Accordingly, our attack, namely\nBadMoE, exploits the unique architecture of MoE models by 1) identifying\ndormant experts unrelated to the target task, 2) constructing a routing-aware\nloss to optimize the activation triggers of these experts, and 3) promoting\ndormant experts to dominating roles via poisoned training data. Extensive\nexperiments show that BadMoE successfully enforces malicious prediction on\nattackers' target tasks while preserving overall model utility, making it a\nmore potent and stealthy attack than existing methods.",

However, most existing methods rely on\nlow dynamic range (LDR) images, limiting their ability to capture detailed\nscenes in high-contrast environments. While some prior works address high\ndynamic range (HDR) scene reconstruction, they typically require multi-view\nsharp images with varying exposure times captured at fixed camera positions,\nwhich is time-consuming and impractical.

However, its application has been limited in the study of\nvapor-to-liquid phase transitions due to the presence of complex liquid\ndynamics, multiple phases within the same field of view, and experimental\ndifficulty. Here, we develop a calibration framework which is capable to\nstudying one of the most complex two-phase heat transfer processes: dropwise\ncondensation. The framework accounts for non-uniformities arising from dynamic\ntwo-phase interactions such as droplet nucleation, growth, coalescence, and\ndeparture, as well as substrate effects particularly observed on micro- and\nnanoengineered surfaces. This approach enables high-resolution temperature\nmeasurements with both spatial (12 $\\mu$m) and temporal (5 ms) precision,\nleading to the discovery of local temperature phenomena unobservable using\nconventional approaches. These observed temperature variations are linked to\ndroplet statistics, showing how different regions contribute to local\ncondensation heat transfer. We extend the developed method to quantify local\nthermal parameters by fusing it with a generative machine learning model to map\nvisual images into temperature fields. The model is informed of the physical\nparameter by incorporating vapor pressure embedding as the conditional\nparameter. This work represents a significant step toward simplifying local\ntemperature measurements for vapor-to-liquid phase change phenomena by\ndeveloping a methodology as well as a machine learning approach to map local\nthermal phenomena using only optical images as the input.",

As a result, building a real sensor network\ntestbed for verifying, validating, or experimenting with a newly designed\nprotocol presents considerable challenges in adapting a laboratory scenario due\nto the significant financial and logistical barriers, such as the need for\nspecialized hardware and large-scale deployments. Additionally, WSN suffers\nfrom severe constraints such as restricted power supply, short communication\nrange, limited bandwidth availability, and restricted memory storage.\nAddressing these challenges, this work presents a flexible testbed solution\nnamed STGen that enables researchers to experiment with IoT protocols in a\nhybrid environment that emulates WSN implementations with the physical Internet\nthrough a dedicated physical server named STGen core, which receives sensor\ntraffic and processes it for further actions. The STGen testbed is lightweight\nin memory usage and easy to deploy. Most importantly, STGen supports\nlarge-scale distributed systems, facilitates experimentation with IoT\nprotocols, and enables integration with back-end services for big data\nanalytics and statistical insights. The key feature of STGen is the integration\nof real-world IoT protocols and their applications with WSN. Its modular and\nlightweight design makes STGen efficient and enables it to outperform other\npopular testbeds, such as Gotham and GothX, reducing memory usage by 89\\%.\nWhile GothX takes approximately 26 minutes to establish a large topology with\nfour VM nodes and 498 Docker nodes, STGen requires only 1.645 seconds to\ninitialize the platform with 500 sensor nodes.",

Although automated defect detection approaches\nbased on Convolutional Neural Networks(e.g., Mask R-CNN) have advanced rapidly,\ntheir reliability remains challenged due to data annotation uncertainties\nduring deep model training and overfitting issues. These limitations may lead\nto detection deviations when processing the given new test samples, rendering\nautomated detection processes unreliable. To address this challenge, we first\nevaluate the detection model's practical performance through calibration data\nthat satisfies the independent and identically distributed (i.i.d) condition\nwith test data. Specifically, we define a loss function for each calibration\nsample to quantify detection error rates, such as the complement of recall rate\nand false discovery rate. Subsequently, we derive a statistically rigorous\nthreshold based on a user-defined risk level to identify high-probability\ndefective pixels in test images, thereby constructing prediction sets (e.g.,\ndefect regions). This methodology ensures that the expected error rate (mean\nerror rate) on the test set remains strictly bounced by the predefined risk\nlevel. Additionally, we observe a negative correlation between the average\nprediction set size and the risk level on the test set, establishing a\nstatistically rigorous metric for assessing detection model uncertainty.\nFurthermore, our study demonstrates robust and efficient control over the\nexpected test set error rate across varying calibration-to-test partitioning\nratios, validating the method's adaptability and operational effectiveness.",

Results indicate DSPPs provide\nstrong in-distribution calibration leveraging their sigma point approximations.\nHowever, compared to Deep Ensembles, which demonstrated superior robustness in\nboth per- formance and calibration under the tested shifts, the GP-based\nmethods showed vulnerabilities, exhibiting particular sensitivity in the\nobserved metrics. Our findings underscore ensembles as a robust baseline,\nsuggesting that while deep GP methods offer good in-distribution calibration,\ntheir practical robustness under distribution shift requires careful\nevaluation.

This study proposes an interpretable Machine Learning (ML) framework\nfor MDR prediction, aiming for both accurate inference and enhanced\nexplainability.\n  Methods: Patients are modeled as Multivariate Time Series (MTS), capturing\nclinical progression and patient-to-patient interactions. Similarity among\npatients is quantified using MTS-based methods: descriptive statistics, Dynamic\nTime Warping, and Time Cluster Kernel. These similarity measures serve as\ninputs for MDR classification via Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and\nSupport Vector Machines, with dimensionality reduction and kernel\ntransformations improving model performance. For explainability, patient\nsimilarity networks are constructed from these metrics. Spectral clustering and\nt-SNE are applied to identify MDR-related subgroups and visualize high-risk\nclusters, enabling insight into clinically relevant patterns.\n  Results: The framework was validated on ICU Electronic Health Records from\nthe University Hospital of Fuenlabrada, achieving an AUC of 81%. It outperforms\nbaseline ML and deep learning models by leveraging graph-based patient\nsimilarity. The approach identifies key risk factors -- prolonged antibiotic\nuse, invasive procedures, co-infections, and extended ICU stays -- and reveals\nclinically meaningful clusters.

These forces scale\nwith plasma current and magnetic field strength, making disruptions one of the\nkey challenges for future devices. Unfortunately, disruptions are not fully\nunderstood, with many different underlying causes that are difficult to\nanticipate. Data-driven models have shown success in predicting them, but they\nonly provide limited interpretability. On the other hand, large-scale\nstatistical analyses have been a great asset to understanding disruptive\npatterns. In this paper, we leverage data-driven methods to find an\ninterpretable representation of the plasma state for disruption\ncharacterization. Specifically, we use a latent variable model to represent\ndiagnostic measurements as a low-dimensional, latent representation. We build\nupon the Variational Autoencoder (VAE) framework, and extend it for (1)\ncontinuous projections of plasma trajectories; (2) a multimodal structure to\nseparate operating regimes; and (3) separation with respect to disruptive\nregimes. Subsequently, we can identify continuous indicators for the disruption\nrate and the disruptivity based on statistical properties of measurement data.\nThe proposed method is demonstrated using a dataset of approximately 1600 TCV\ndischarges, selecting for flat-top disruptions or regular terminations. We\nevaluate the method with respect to (1) the identified disruption risk and its\ncorrelation with other plasma properties; (2) the ability to distinguish\ndifferent types of disruptions; and (3) downstream analyses. For the latter, we\nconduct a demonstrative study on identifying parameters connected to\ndisruptions using counterfactual-like analysis.

To overcome this limitation, we present a novel generative deep\ntransfer learning approach to make SCADA samples from one wind turbine lacking\ntraining data resemble SCADA data from wind turbines with representative\ntraining data. Through CycleGAN-based domain mapping, our method enables the\napplication of an NBM trained on an existing wind turbine to a new one with\nseverely limited data. We demonstrate our approach on field data mapping SCADA\nsamples across 7 substantially different WTs. Our findings show significantly\nimproved fault detection in wind turbines with scarce data.

Given a graph $G$ and a parameter $k$, one has to decide if\nthere is a set $S$ of at most $k$ vertices such that $G-S$ is acyclic. Assuming\nthe Exponential Time Hypothesis, it is known that FVS cannot be solved in time\n$2^{o(k)}n^{\\mathcal{O}(1)}$ in general graphs. To overcome this, many recent\nresults considered FVS restricted to particular intersection graph classes and\nprovided such $2^{o(k)}n^{\\mathcal{O}(1)}$ algorithms.\n  In this paper we provide generic conditions on a graph class for the\nexistence of an algorithm solving FVS in subexponential FPT time, i.e. time\n$2^{k^\\varepsilon} \\mathop{\\rm poly}(n)$, for some $\\varepsilon<1$, where $n$\ndenotes the number of vertices of the instance and $k$ the parameter. On the\none hand this result unifies algorithms that have been proposed over the years\nfor several graph classes such as planar graphs, map graphs, unit-disk graphs,\npseudo-disk graphs, and string graphs of bounded edge-degree.

This framework\ncouples pre-equilibrium dynamics with hydrodynamic evolution by solving the\nBoltzmann equation within the isotropization time approximation. A numerical\nscheme based on the method of characteristics enables the evolution to begin\nfrom a specified initial Boltzmann distribution.

Methods: Rep2Rep learning extends the\nNoise2Noise framework by training a neural network on two repeated MRI\nacquisitions, using one repetition as input and another as target, without\nrequiring ground-truth data. It incorporates noise-adaptive training, enabling\ndenoising generalization across varying noise levels and flexible inference\nwith any number of repetitions. Performance was evaluated on both synthetic\nnoisy brain MRI and 0.55T prostate MRI data, and compared against supervised\nlearning and Monte Carlo Stein's Unbiased Risk Estimator (MC-SURE). Results:\nRep2Rep learning outperforms MC-SURE on both synthetic and 0.55T MRI datasets.\nOn synthetic brain data, it achieved denoising quality comparable to supervised\nlearning and surpassed MC-SURE, particularly in preserving structural details\nand reducing residual noise. On the 0.55T prostate MRI dataset, a reader study\nshowed radiologists preferred Rep2Rep-denoised 2-average images over 8-average\nnoisy images. Rep2Rep demonstrated robustness to noise-level discrepancies\nbetween training and inference, supporting its practical implementation.\nConclusion: Rep2Rep learning offers an effective self-supervised denoising for\nlow-field MRI by leveraging routinely acquired multi-repetition data. Its\nnoise-adaptivity enables generalization to different SNR regimes without clean\nreference images. This makes Rep2Rep learning a promising tool for improving\nimage quality and scan efficiency in low-field MRI.",

Thus, past work requires controlled settings such\nas known object shapes and contacts, and tackles only limited object classes.\nInstead, we need methods that generalize to natural images and novel object\nclasses. We tackle this in two main ways: (1) We collect PICO-db, a new dataset\nof natural images uniquely paired with dense 3D contact on both body and object\nmeshes. To this end, we use images from the recent DAMON dataset that are\npaired with contacts, but these contacts are only annotated on a canonical 3D\nbody. In contrast, we seek contact labels on both the body and the object. To\ninfer these given an image, we retrieve an appropriate 3D object mesh from a\ndatabase by leveraging vision foundation models. Then, we project DAMON's body\ncontact patches onto the object via a novel method needing only 2 clicks per\npatch. This minimal human input establishes rich contact correspondences\nbetween bodies and objects. (2) We exploit our new dataset of contact\ncorrespondences in a novel render-and-compare fitting method, called PICO-fit,\nto recover 3D body and object meshes in interaction. PICO-fit infers contact\nfor the SMPL-X body, retrieves a likely 3D object mesh and contact from PICO-db\nfor that object, and uses the contact to iteratively fit the 3D body and object\nmeshes to image evidence via optimization. Uniquely, PICO-fit works well for\nmany object categories that no existing method can tackle. This is crucial to\nenable HOI understanding to scale in the wild.

Block of individual types of ionic currents can now\nbe measured experimentally at an early stage of drug development, and this is\nthe standard screening approach for a number of ion currents in many large\npharmaceutical companies. However, clinical risk is a complex function of the\ndegree of block of many different types of cardiac ion currents, and this is\ndifficult to understand by looking at results of these screens independently.\nBy using ordinary differential equation models for the electrical activity of\nheart cells (electrophysiology models) we can integrate information from\ndifferent types of currents, to predict the effect on whole heart cells and\nsubsequent risk of side effects. The resulting simulations can provide a more\naccurate summary of the risk of a drug earlier in development and hence more\ncheaply than the pre-existing approaches.",

    "abstract": "Augmented reality (AR) applications for construction monitoring rely on\nreal-time environmental tracking to visualize architectural elements. However,\nconstruction sites present significant challenges for traditional tracking\nmethods due to featureless surfaces, dynamic changes, and drift accumulation,\nleading to misalignment between digital models and the physical world. This\npaper proposes a BIM-aware drift correction method to address these challenges.\nInstead of relying solely on SLAM-based localization, we align ``as-built\"\ndetected planes from the real-world environment with ``as-planned\"\narchitectural planes in BIM. Our method performs robust plane matching and\ncomputes a transformation (TF) between SLAM (S) and BIM (B) origin frames using\noptimization techniques, minimizing drift over time. By incorporating BIM as\nprior structural knowledge, we can achieve improved long-term localization and\nenhanced AR visualization accuracy in noisy construction environments. The\nmethod is evaluated through real-world experiments, showing significant\nreductions in drift-induced errors and optimized alignment consistency. On\naverage, our system achieves a reduction of 52.24% in angular deviations and a\nreduction of 60.8% in the distance error of the matched walls compared to the\ninitial manual alignment by the user.",

Streaming DiLoCo alleviates this\nissue via communication-computation overlapping but introduces update staleness\nand model inconsistency due to delayed global updates and partial\nsynchronization. These factors impair convergence, especially when aggressive\noverlap is needed to mask high latency.

To solve these challenges, we\nrethink the inductive bias for mesh reconstruction. First, we disentangle the\nunified geometry-texture solution space, where a single input admits multiple\nfeasible solutions, into geometry and texture spaces individually.\nSpecifically, given that normal maps are strictly consistent with geometry and\naccurately capture surface variations, the normal maps serve as the sole input\nfor geometry prediction in DiMeR, while the texture is estimated from RGB\nimages. Second, we streamline the algorithm of mesh extraction by eliminating\nmodules with low performance/cost ratios and redesigning regularization losses\nwith 3D supervision. Notably, DiMeR still accepts raw RGB images as input by\nleveraging foundation models for normal prediction. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that DiMeR generalises across sparse-view-, single-image-, and\ntext-to-3D tasks, consistently outperforming baselines.

Within this framework, we show that the\nratio $\\omega_P/\\omega_Q$ is the main parameter determining the mode spectrum,\nand obtain a thorough understanding of it by systematically solving this\nproblem with various degrees of sophistication. We first find analytical\nsolutions for truncated power-law disks and use this insight in disks with\nsmooth central cavities. Our main findings are: (i) The number of modes\nincreases for thinner disks and more-equal-mass binaries.

Conformal prediction is a powerful\npost-hoc technique that takes the output of any classifier and transforms it\ninto a set of likely labels, providing a statistical guarantee on the coverage\nof the true label. Unlike evaluations on standard benchmarks, our study\naddresses the complexities of data-scarce and highly variable real-world\nsettings. We investigate the effectiveness of leveraging pretrained models\n(MobileNet, DenseNet, and ResNet), fine-tuned with limited labeled data, to\ngenerate informative prediction sets. To further evaluate the impact of\ncalibration, we consider two parallel pipelines (with and without temperature\nscaling) and assess performance using two key metrics: empirical coverage and\naverage prediction set size. This setup allows us to systematically examine how\ncalibration choices influence the trade-off between reliability and efficiency.\nOur findings demonstrate that even with relatively small labeled samples and\nsimple nonconformity scores, conformal prediction can yield valuable\nuncertainty estimates for complex tasks. Moreover, our analysis reveals that\nwhile temperature scaling is often employed for calibration, it does not\nconsistently lead to smaller prediction sets, underscoring the importance of\ncareful consideration in its application. Furthermore, our results highlight\nthe significant potential of model compression techniques within the conformal\nprediction pipeline for deployment in resource-constrained environments.

Existing approaches primarily rely on context-free\nthread-local guarantees, and prohibit optimizations that introduce a data-race.\nHowever, compilers utilize global context-specific information, exposing safe\noptimizations that may violate such guarantees as well as introduce a race.\nSuch optimizations need to individually be proven safe for each language model.\nAn alternate approach to this would be proving them safe for an intuitive model\n(like interleaving semantics), and then determine their portability across\nother concurrent models. In this paper, we address this problem of porting\nacross models of concurrency. We first identify a global guarantee on\noptimizations portable from Sequential Consistency (SC) to Total Store Order\n(TSO). Our guarantee is in the form of constraints specifying the syntactic\nchanges an optimization must not incur.

    "abstract": "Dynamic node classification is critical for modeling evolving systems like\nfinancial transactions and academic collaborations. In such systems,\ndynamically capturing node information changes is critical for dynamic node\nclassification, which usually requires all labels at every timestamp. However,\nit is difficult to collect all dynamic labels in real-world scenarios due to\nhigh annotation costs and label uncertainty (e.g., ambiguous or delayed labels\nin fraud detection). In contrast, final timestamp labels are easier to obtain\nas they rely on complete temporal patterns and are usually maintained as a\nunique label for each user in many open platforms, without tracking the history\ndata. To bridge this gap, we propose PTCL(Pseudo-label Temporal Curriculum\nLearning), a pioneering method addressing label-limited dynamic node\nclassification where only final labels are available. PTCL introduces: (1) a\ntemporal decoupling architecture separating the backbone (learning time-aware\nrepresentations) and decoder (strictly aligned with final labels), which\ngenerate pseudo-labels, and (2) a Temporal Curriculum Learning strategy that\nprioritizes pseudo-labels closer to the final timestamp by assigning them\nhigher weights using an exponentially decaying function. We contribute a new\nacademic dataset (CoOAG), capturing long-range research interest in dynamic\ngraph. Experiments across real-world scenarios demonstrate PTCL's consistent\nsuperiority over other methods adapted to this task.

The molecular gas excitation properties have yet to be\nexamined in detail under such extreme conditions. Here we study the most far-IR\nluminous WISE Hot DOG W2246-0526, focusing on the central host galaxy. Multi-J\nCO transition measurements at J=2-1, 5-4, 7-6, 12-11, and 17-16 provide the\nmost well-sampled CO excitation ladder of any WISE Hot DOG to date, providing\nthe first self-consistent modeling constraints on the molecular gas and dust\nproperties. We implement a state-of-the-art TUrbulent Non-Equilibrium Radiative\ntransfer model (TUNER) that simultaneously models both the line and dust\ncontinuum measurements. Due to a combination of high molecular gas densities\nand high kinetic temperatures, this extreme CO spectral line energy\ndistribution peaks at J = 10 to 12, likely making this the most highly excited\ngalaxy ever reported. We derive the alpha_CO conversion factors and conclude\nthat (J=3-7) CO line luminosities trace the bulk of the molecular gas mass.\nW2246-0526 is a rapidly evolving system, with a high value of the molecular gas\nkinetic temperature versus dust temperature T_k / T_d ~ 3.9, reflecting\npreviously reported shocks and outflows injecting kinetic energy within the\ncentral kpc of this host. This first comprehensive simultaneous modeling of\nboth the molecular gas and dust in any object within the WISE-selected Hot DOG\nsample motivates obtaining well-sampled dust and line spectral energy\ndistributions to better understand the conditions within these short-lived\nepisodes in galaxy evolution that are associated with the most obscured\nsupermassive black hole activity.",

While such\napproaches are highly accurate, they are also rather inflexible when it comes\nto adjusting the underlying 3D model after changes in the scene. Structureless\nlocalization approaches represent the scene as a database of images with known\nposes and thus offer a much more flexible representation that can be easily\nupdated by adding or removing images. Although there is a large amount of\nliterature on structure-based approaches, there is significantly less work on\nstructureless methods. Hence, this paper is dedicated to providing the, to the\nbest of our knowledge, first comprehensive discussion and comparison of\nstructureless methods. Extensive experiments show that approaches that use a\nhigher degree of classical geometric reasoning generally achieve higher pose\naccuracy. In particular, approaches based on classical absolute or\nsemi-generalized relative pose estimation outperform very recent methods based\non pose regression by a wide margin. Compared with state-of-the-art\nstructure-based approaches, the flexibility of structureless methods comes at\nthe cost of (slightly) lower pose accuracy, indicating an interesting direction\nfor future work.",

Developing a\ncomplete picture of these processes requires complementary studies across this\nfull spectrum of jet-launching sources. Jet-interstellar medium (ISM)\ninteraction sites near black hole X-ray binaries provide unique laboratories to\nstudy jet energetics. This work aims to detect and characterise the bow shock\nnear one black hole X-ray binary, Cyg X-1, and then use this bow shock\nstructure to parametrise the properties of the jet launched by Cyg X-1 over its\nlifetime. We used the MeerKAT radio telescope to investigate the bow shock\nstructure formed by the interaction between the jets of Cyg X-1 and the ISM. We\nsuccessfully detect the bow shock north of Cyg X-1 in the L and S bands and\nreport its size and brightness. We present the spectral index distribution\nacross the bow shock, which is in the range -0.9 to 0.4, with an error\ndistribution (0.6 to 1.5) that peaks at unity. We determine that the unshocked\nISM density is 6-7 cm^-3 for a temperature range of 10^4 to 3*10^6 K. This\ntemperature range suggests that the velocity of the bow shock is 21 km/s to 364\nkm/s. The age of the Cyg X-1 jet responsible for the bow shock is 0.04 to 0.3\nMyr, and the power of the jet is constrained to 2*10^31 ergs/s to 10^35 ergs/s.\nWe also detect new morphological features of the bow shock in the S-band image.\nThe comparison of archival H_alpha maps with the new radio observations hints\nat different regions of emission, different temperature ranges, and different\nISM densities. The spectral index suggests a consistent emission origin across\nthe structure. The ISM density around Cyg X-1 is on the higher end for Galactic\nenvironments, and our results indicate a lower jet energy transport rate than\nprior estimates.",

A recently introduced technique, called the\nsize-invariant shape transformation, overcomes this by introducing a new\ncontrol parameter that deforms the potential landscape without altering system\nsize, enabling nonuniform level scaling. This shape parameter gives rise to\nquantum shape effects in confined systems, conceptually distinct from quantum\nsize effects. We explore the limits of this phenomenon by asking: what is the\nminimal system in which such spectral behavior can emerge? We show that even a\ntwo-level system can exhibit thermodynamic consequences of quantum shape\neffects, including spontaneous transitions into lower-entropy states, a feature\nabsent in classical thermodynamics for non-interacting systems. We identify the\norigin as geometry-induced asymmetric level coupling, where the ground-state\nenergy and level spacing respond oppositely to shape changes. This extends to\nmany-level systems, where the thermally averaged level spacing and ground-state\nenergy evolve in opposite directions. We construct spontaneity maps revealing\nenergy- and entropy-driven spontaneous processes. These behaviors emerge under\nquasistatic, isothermal deformations and show how geometry alone can induce\nthermodynamic effects typically exclusive to interacting or open systems.

Yet, the structure and\nimplications of these zero modes remain poorly understood. In this work, we\nfocus on the properties of the zero mode subspace in quantum kinetically\nconstrained models with a $U(1)$ particle-conservation symmetry.

It is well established already that optical losses in HCFs are highly\nsensitive to both the wavelength and the geometry of the cladding capillaries.\nThe underlying physical mechanisms behind reducing loss with the change of HCF\ndesign parameters while keeping the same fiber structure are not yet fully\nunderstood. In this work, we investigate the relationship between light\nlocalization and corresponding decrease of losses in HCFs and the distribution\nof reverse energy fluxes in air-core modes. We show here that the shape of the\ncapillaries plays a crucial role in controlling radial energy backflows that\ninfluence light confinement and the energy leakage from air-core modes of HCFs.\nThrough numerical modeling, we demonstrate that optimizing the capillary\ngeometry to tailor the distribution of reverse radial energy fluxes leads to a\nsubstantial reduction in transmission losses even in fibers with relatively\nsimple cladding structures.

We have previously proposed generalization criteria that rely on\nthe observation that Hessian eigenvalue spectral density (HESD) behaves\nsimilarly for a wide class of NNs. This paper further studies their\napplicability by investigating factors that can result in different types of\nHESD. We conduct a wide range of experiments showing that HESD mainly has\npositive eigenvalues (MP-HESD) for NN training and fine-tuning with various\noptimizers on different datasets with different preprocessing and augmentation\nprocedures. We also show that mainly negative HESD (MN-HESD) is a consequence\nof external gradient manipulation, indicating that the previously proposed\nHessian analysis methodology cannot be applied in such cases. We also propose\ncriteria and corresponding conditions to determine HESD type and estimate NN\ngeneralization potential. These HESD types and previously proposed\ngeneralization criteria are combined into a unified HESD analysis methodology.\nFinally, we discuss how HESD changes during training, and show the occurrence\nof quasi-singular (QS) HESD and its influence on the proposed methodology and\non the conventional assumptions about the relation between Hessian eigenvalues\nand NN loss landscape curvature.",

However, the\nuniversal utility of this field often hinders the possibility of having a\ngeneralized theory that accommodates every scenario. This tradeoff is better\nreflected through the lens of dependence, a central piece behind the\ntheoretical and applied developments of multiple testing. Although omnipresent\nin many scientific avenues, the nature and extent of dependence vary\nsubstantially with the context and complexity of the particular scenario.\nPositive dependence is the norm in testing many treatments versus a single\ncontrol or in spatial statistics. On the contrary, negative dependence arises\nnaturally in tests based on split samples and in cyclical, ordered comparisons.\nIn GWAS, the SNP markers are generally considered to be weakly dependent.\nGeneralized familywise error rate (k-FWER) control has been one of the\nprominent frequentist approaches in simultaneous inference.

This paper revisits the classical testing problem of\nnormal means in different correlated frameworks.

    "abstract": "Precise assembly of composite fuselages is critical for aircraft assembly to\nmeet the ultra-high precision requirements. Due to dimensional variations,\nthere is a gap when two fuselage assemble. In practice, actuators are required\nto adjust fuselage dimensions by applying forces to specific points on fuselage\nedge through pulling or pushing force actions. The positioning and force\nsettings of these actuators significantly influence the efficiency of the shape\nadjustments. The current literature usually predetermines the fixed number of\nactuators, which is not optimal in terms of overall quality and corresponding\nactuator costs. However, optimal placement of actuators in terms of both\nlocations and number is challenging due to compliant structures, complex\nmaterial properties, and dimensional variabilities of incoming fuselages. To\naddress these challenges, this paper introduces a reinforcement learning (RL)\nframework that enables sequential decision-making for actuator placement\nselection and optimal force computation. Specifically, our methodology employs\nthe Dueling Double Deep Q-Learning (D3QN) algorithm to refine the\ndecision-making capabilities of sequential actuator placements. The environment\nis meticulously crafted to enable sequential and incremental selection of an\nactuator based on system states. We formulate the actuator selection problem as\na submodular function optimization problem, where the sub-modularity properties\ncan be adopted to efficiently achieve near-optimal solutions. The proposed\nmethodology has been comprehensively evaluated through numerical studies and\ncomparison studies, demonstrating its effectiveness and outstanding performance\nin enhancing assembly precision with limited actuator numbers.",

    "abstract": "After the inflationary phase, the universe enters the preheating phase,\nduring which the inflaton field rolls down its potential and oscillates. When\nthe potential significantly deviates from a parabolic shape at its minimum,\nthese oscillations trigger an instability in the scalar perturbations, leading\nto their amplification. This phenomenon, known as self-resonance, has important\nimplications in cosmology. Notably, since scalar perturbations couple to tensor\nperturbations at second order in the equations of motion, this amplification\nresults in the production of Gravitational Waves (GWs), referred to as\nScalar-Induced Gravitational Waves (SIGWs). In this study, we investigate the\nproduction of SIGWs during the preheating phase for a class of inflationary\nmodels known as $\\alpha$-attractors, characterized by a single parameter\n$\\alpha$. We focus on small values of this parameter, specifically $\\alpha \\sim\nO(10^{-1} - 10^{-4})$, where the self-resonance effect is particularly\npronounced. We obtain lower bounds on this parameter, $\\log_{10}(\\alpha)>-3.54$\nfor the T-model and $\\log_{10}(\\alpha)>-3.17$ for the E-model, based on the\nenergy density of SIGWs constrained by Big Bang nucleosynthesis, which\nultimately translates into lower bounds on the tensor-to-scalar ratio,\n$r>9.61\\times10^{-7}$ for the T-model and $r>2.25\\times10^{-6}$ for the\nE-model.",

The theory gives\nrise to gauge correlation functions that characterize spatial and temporal\ninhomogeneity with microscopic resolution on the one-body level. Analyzing the\ndynamical gauge invariance allows one to identify a specific localized shift\ngauge current as a fundamental nonequilibrium observable that characterizes\nparticle-based dynamics. When averaged over the nonequilibrium ensemble, the\nshift current vanishes identically, which constitutes an exact nonequilibrium\nconservation law that generalizes the Yvon-Born-Green equilibrium balance of\nthe vanishing sum of ideal, interparticle, and external forces. Any given\nobservable is associated with a corresponding dynamical hyperforce density and\nhypercurrent correlation function. An exact nonequilibrium sum rule\ninterrelates these one-body functions, in generalization of the recent\nhyperforce balance for equilibrium systems. We demonstrate the physical\nconsequences of the dynamical gauge invariance using both harmonically confined\nideal gas setups, for which we present analytical solutions, and molecular\ndynamics simulations of interacting systems, for which we demonstrate the shift\ncurrent and hypercurrent correlation functions to be accessible both via\nfinite-difference methods and via trajectory-based automatic differentiation.\nWe show that the theory constitutes a starting point for developing\nnonequilibrium reduced-variance sampling algorithms and for investigating\nthermally-activated barrier crossing.",

In this work, we revisit the DKT model from two perspectives:\narchitectural improvements and optimization efficiency. First, we enhance the\nmodel using gated recurrent units, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)\nnetworks and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), which better capture long-term\ndependencies and help mitigate vanishing gradient issues. Second, we\nre-implement DKT using the PyTorch framework, enabling a modular and accessible\ninfrastructure compatible with modern deep learning workflows. We also\nbenchmark several optimization algorithms SGD, RMSProp, Adagrad, Adam, and\nAdamW to evaluate their impact on convergence speed and predictive accuracy in\neducational modeling tasks. Experiments on the Synthetic-5 and Khan Academy\ndatasets show that GRUs and LSTMs achieve higher accuracy and improved training\nstability compared to basic RNNs, while adaptive optimizers such as Adam and\nAdamW consistently outperform SGD in both early-stage learning and final model\nperformance.

To this end, we propose\na two-stage data update method called TSUE. TSUE divides the update process\ninto a synchronous stage that records updates in a data log, and an\nasynchronous stage that recycles the log in real-time. TSUE effectively reduces\nupdate latency by transforming random I/O into sequential I/O, and it\nsignificantly reduces recycle overhead by utilizing a three-layer log and the\nspatio-temporal locality of access patterns. In SSDs cluster, TSUE\nsignificantly im- proves update performance, achieving improvements of 7.6X\nunder Ali-Cloud trace, 5X under Ten-Cloud trace, while it also extends the\nSSD's lifespan by up to 13X through reducing the frequencies of reads/writes\nand of erase operations.",

Two of these contributions were a focus on theory that\nactually supports practice, and the identification of well-posed aspects of\ninverse problems that may quite ill-posed. This paper illustrates these two\nthemes in the context of Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT), which is both\nvery ill-posed and very practical. We show that for a highly constrained\nversion of this inverse problem, in which a small elliptical inclusion in a\nhomogeneous background is to be identified, optimization of the experimental\ndesign (that is, electrode locations) vastly improves the stability of the\nsolution.",

Network slicing within O-RAN allows network\noperators to create customized virtual networks, each tailored to meet the\nspecific needs of a particular application or service. Efficiently managing\nthese slices is crucial for future 6G networks. O-RAN introduces specialized\nsoftware applications called xApps that manage different network functions. In\nnetwork slicing, an xApp can be responsible for managing a separate network\nslice. To optimize resource allocation across numerous network slices, these\nxApps must coordinate. Traditional methods where all xApps communicate freely\ncan lead to excessive overhead, hindering network performance. In this paper,\nwe address the issue of xApp conflict mitigation by proposing an innovative\nZero-Touch Management (ZTM) solution for radio resource management in O-RAN.\nOur approach leverages Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) to enable\nxApps to learn and optimize resource allocation without the need for constant\nmanual intervention. We introduce a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN)-based\nattention mechanism to streamline communication among xApps, reducing overhead\nand improving overall system efficiency. Our results compare traditional MARL,\nwhere all xApps communicate, against our MARL GCN-based attention method. The\nfindings demonstrate the superiority of our approach, especially as the number\nof xApps increases, ultimately providing a scalable and efficient solution for\noptimal network slicing management in O-RAN.",

    "abstract": "Recent research in Cooperative Coevolution~(CC) have achieved promising\nprogress in solving large-scale global optimization problems. However, existing\nCC paradigms have a primary limitation in that they require deep expertise for\nselecting or designing effective variable decomposition strategies. Inspired by\nadvancements in Meta-Black-Box Optimization, this paper introduces LCC, a\npioneering learning-based cooperative coevolution framework that dynamically\nschedules decomposition strategies during optimization processes. The\ndecomposition strategy selector is parameterized through a neural network,\nwhich processes a meticulously crafted set of optimization status features to\ndetermine the optimal strategy for each optimization step. The network is\ntrained via the Proximal Policy Optimization method in a reinforcement learning\nmanner across a collection of representative problems, aiming to maximize the\nexpected optimization performance. Extensive experimental results demonstrate\nthat LCC not only offers certain advantages over state-of-the-art baselines in\nterms of optimization effectiveness and resource consumption, but it also\nexhibits promising transferability towards unseen problems.",

    "abstract": "Modern AI workloads rely heavily on optimized computing kernels for both\ntraining and inference. These AI kernels follow well-defined data-flow\npatterns, such as moving tiles between DRAM and SRAM and performing a sequence\nof computations on those tiles. However, writing high-performance kernels\nremains complex despite the clarity of these patterns. Achieving peak\nperformance requires careful, hardware-centric optimizations to fully leverage\nmodern accelerators. While domain-specific compilers attempt to reduce the\nburden of writing high-performance kernels, they often struggle with usability\nand expressiveness gaps. In this paper, we present TileLang, a generalized\ntiled programming model for more efficient AI Kernel programming. TileLang\ndecouples scheduling space (thread binding, layout, tensorize and pipeline)\nfrom dataflow, and encapsulated them as a set of customization annotations and\nprimitives. This approach allows users to focus on the kernel's data-flow\nitself, while leaving most other optimizations to compilers. We conduct\ncomprehensive experiments on commonly-used devices, across numerous\nexperiments, our evaluation shows that TileLang can achieve state-of-the-art\nperformance in key kernels, demonstrating that its unified block-and-thread\nparadigm and transparent scheduling capabilities deliver both the power and\nflexibility demanded by modern AI system development.",

When numerous electric vehicles (EVs)\ncharge concurrently, local transformers risk overloading - a problem that\ncurrent tariff-based strategies do not adequately address. This paper\nintroduces an aggregator-based coordination mechanism that shifts EV charging\nfrom congested to underutilized periods using a rule-based scheduling\nalgorithm. Unlike conventional methods that depend on complex real-time pricing\nsignals or optimization-heavy solutions, the aggregator approach uses a simple\nyet effective \"laxity\" measure to prioritize charging flexibility. To assess\ntechnical and economic viability, a multi-agent simulation was developed to\nreplicate residential user behavior and DSO constraints under the use of a 400\nkVA low-voltage transformer. The results indicate that overloads are completely\neliminated with minimal inconvenience to users, whose increased charging costs\nare offset by the aggregator at an annual total of under DKK 6000 -\nsignificantly lower than the cost of infrastructure reinforcement. This study\ncontributes by (i) quantifying the compensation needed to prevent large-scale\noverloads, (ii) presenting a replicable, computationally feasible, rule-based\naggregator model for DSOs, and (iii) comparing aggregator solutions to costly\ntransformer upgrades, underscoring the aggregator's role as a viable tool for\nfuture distribution systems.",

The candidates are selected by combining low-frequency radio and\noptical surveys that cover a total of ~2,000 squared degrees using the dropout\ntechnique, that is, the presence of a redshifted Lyman break in their\nphotometric data. We focused on 39 g-dropout sources, which is about one-third\nof the selected sources, that are expected to be at 3.0 < z < 4.5.\n  We considered single and double radio sources separately and searched for\ng-dropout sources at the location of the midpoint of the radio structure for\nthe latter. The host galaxy is expected to be located there. We confirm only\none out of 29 candidate HzRG associated with an extended radio source. For the\ncompact radio sources, we instead reach a success rate of 30% by confirming 3\nout of 10 HzRG targets.\n  The four newly discovered HzRGs show a wide range of spectral radio slopes.\nThis supports the idea that not all HzRGs are ultrasteep radio sources (USSs).\nThe criterion for USSs is most commonly used to find HzRGs, but this method\nonly selects a subpopulation. We discuss various contamination sources for the\nobjects that are selected with the Lyman-break method and conclude that they\nare likely mainly HzRGs, but with a Ly$\\alpha$ line that is underluminous with\nrespect to expectations.",

    "abstract": "Autoregressive models have demonstrated remarkable success in sequential data\ngeneration, particularly in NLP, but their extension to continuous-domain image\ngeneration presents significant challenges. Recent work, the masked\nautoregressive model (MAR), bypasses quantization by modeling per-token\ndistributions in continuous spaces using a diffusion head but suffers from slow\ninference due to the high computational cost of the iterative denoising\nprocess. To address this, we propose the Fast AutoRegressive model (FAR), a\nnovel framework that replaces MAR's diffusion head with a lightweight shortcut\nhead, enabling efficient few-step sampling while preserving autoregressive\nprinciples. Additionally, FAR seamlessly integrates with causal Transformers,\nextending them from discrete to continuous token generation without requiring\narchitectural modifications. Experiments demonstrate that FAR achieves\n$2.3\\times$ faster inference than MAR while maintaining competitive FID and IS\nscores. This work establishes the first efficient autoregressive paradigm for\nhigh-fidelity continuous-space image generation, bridging the critical gap\nbetween quality and scalability in visual autoregressive modeling.",

However, sketching algorithms in the graph semi-streaming\nmodel use $O(V polylog(V))$ space for a $V$-vertex graph, and the fact that\nimplementations of these algorithms are not used in the academic literature or\nin industrial applications may be because this space requirement is too large\nfor RAM on today's hardware.\n  In this paper we introduce the external semi-streaming model, which addresses\nthe aspects of the semi-streaming model that limit its practical impact. In\nthis model, the input is in the form of a stream and $O(V polylog(V))$ space is\navailable, but most of that space is accessible only via block I/O operations\nas in the external memory model. The goal in the external semi-streaming model\nis to simultaneously achieve small space and low I/O cost.\n  We present a general transformation from any vertex-based sketch algorithm to\none which has a low sketching cost in the new model. We prove that this\nautomatic transformation is tight or nearly (up to a $O(\\log(V))$ factor) tight\nvia an I/O lower bound for the task of sketching the input stream.\n  Using this transformation and other techniques, we present external\nsemi-streaming algorithms for connectivity, bipartiteness testing,\n$(1+\\epsilon)$-approximating MST weight, testing k-edge connectivity,\n$(1+\\epsilon)$-approximating the minimum cut of a graph, computing\n$\\epsilon$-cut sparsifiers, and approximating the density of the densest\nsubgraph.

One convenient approach to\ninvoke this ability is to prepend metadata (e.g. URLs, domains, and styles) at\nthe beginning of texts in the pre-training data, making it easier for the model\nto access latent semantics before observing the entire text. Previous studies\nhave reported that this technique actually improves the performance of trained\nmodels in downstream tasks; however, this improvement has been observed only in\nspecific downstream tasks, without consistent enhancement in average next-token\nprediction loss. To understand this phenomenon, we closely investigate how\nprepending metadata during pre-training affects model performance by examining\nits behavior using artificial data. Interestingly, we found that this approach\nproduces both positive and negative effects on the downstream tasks. We\ndemonstrate that the effectiveness of the approach depends on whether latent\nsemantics can be inferred from the downstream task's prompt. Specifically,\nthrough investigations using data generated by probabilistic context-free\ngrammars, we show that training with metadata helps improve model's performance\nwhen the given context is long enough to infer the latent semantics.

As our methodology relies on the\nuniversal spatial coherence of geospatial data (\"Tobler's law\"), it can be\nadapted to various settings where street view images are available, to enable\nscalable, unsupervised land use mapping and updating.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) often generate responses that deviate from user\ninput or training data, a phenomenon known as \"hallucination.\" These\nhallucinations undermine user trust and hinder the adoption of generative AI\nsystems. Addressing hallucinations is essential for the advancement of LLMs.\nThis paper introduces a comprehensive hallucination benchmark, incorporating\nboth new extrinsic and existing intrinsic evaluation tasks, built upon clear\ntaxonomy of hallucination. A major challenge in benchmarking hallucinations is\nthe lack of a unified framework due to inconsistent definitions and\ncategorizations. We disentangle LLM hallucination from \"factuality,\" proposing\na clear taxonomy that distinguishes between extrinsic and intrinsic\nhallucinations, to promote consistency and facilitate research. Extrinsic\nhallucinations, where the generated content is not consistent with the training\ndata, are increasingly important as LLMs evolve. Our benchmark includes dynamic\ntest set generation to mitigate data leakage and ensure robustness against such\nleakage. We also analyze existing benchmarks, highlighting their limitations\nand saturation. The work aims to: (1) establish a clear taxonomy of\nhallucinations, (2) introduce new extrinsic hallucination tasks, with data that\ncan be dynamically regenerated to prevent saturation by leakage, (3) provide a\ncomprehensive analysis of existing benchmarks, distinguishing them from\nfactuality evaluations.",

Large-scale\ncosmological simulations are an ideal tool to study the repeated BH mergers,\naccretion and feedback that conspire to regulate this process. While such\nsimulations are of fundamental importance for understanding the complex and\nintertwined relationship between BHs and their hosts, they are plagued with\nnumerical inaccuracies at the scale of individual BH orbits. To quantify this\nissue, taking advantage of the $(100 \\, h^{-1}\\,\\text{cMpc})^3$ FABLE\nsimulation box, we track all individual BH mergers and the corresponding host\ngalaxy mergers as a function of cosmic time. We demonstrate that BH mergers\nfrequently occur prematurely, well before the corresponding merger of the host\ngalaxies is complete, and that BHs are sometimes erroneously displaced from\ntheir hosts during close galaxy encounters. Correcting for these artefacts\nresults in substantial macrophysical delays, spanning over several Gyrs, which\nare additional to any microphysical delays arising from unresolved BH binary\nhardening processes. We find that once the macrophysical delays are accounted\nfor, high-mass BH merger events are suppressed, affecting the predictions for\nthe BH population that may be observable with LISA and pulsar timing arrays.\nFurthermore, including these macrophysical delays leads to an increase in the\nnumber of observable dual active galactic nuclei, especially at lower\nredshifts, with respect to FABLE.

    "abstract": "In biomedical science, a set of objects or persons can often be described by\nmultiple distinct sets of features obtained from different data sources or\nmodalities (called \"multi-view data\"). Classical machine learning methods\nignore the multi-view structure of such data, limiting model interpretability\nand performance. The R package `mvs` provides methods that were designed\nspecifically for dealing with multi-view data, based on the multi-view stacking\n(MVS) framework. MVS is a form of supervised (machine) learning used to train\nmulti-view classification or prediction models. MVS works by training a\nlearning algorithm on each view separately, estimating the predictive power of\neach view-specific model through cross-validation, and then using another\nlearning algorithm to assign weights to the view-specific models based on their\nestimated predictions. MVS is a form of ensemble learning, dividing the large\nmulti-view learning problem into smaller sub-problems. Most of these\nsub-problems can be solved in parallel, making it computationally attractive.\nAdditionally, the number of features of the sub-problems is greatly reduced\ncompared with the full multi-view learning problem. This makes MVS especially\nuseful when the total number of features is larger than the number of\nobservations (i.e., high-dimensional data). MVS can still be applied even if\nthe sub-problems are themselves high-dimensional by adding suitable penalty\nterms to the learning algorithms. Furthermore, MVS can be used to automatically\nselect the views which are most important for prediction. The R package `mvs`\nmakes fitting MVS models, including such penalty terms, easily and openly\naccessible. `mvs` allows for the fitting of stacked models with any number of\nlevels, with different penalty terms, different outcome distributions, and\nprovides several options for missing data handling.",

Existing concolic execution\nengines are significantly restricted by (1) input structure-agnostic path\nconstraint selection, leading to the waste of testing effort or missing\ncoverage; (2) limited constraint-solving capability, yielding many\nsyntactically invalid test inputs; (3) reliance on manual acquisition of highly\nstructured seed inputs, resulting in non-continuous testing.\n  This paper proposes Cottontail, a new Large Language Model (LLM)-driven\nconcolic execution engine, to mitigate the above limitations. A more complete\nprogram path representation, named Expressive Structural Coverage Tree (ESCT),\nis first constructed to select structure-aware path constraints. Later, an\nLLM-driven constraint solver based on a Solve-Complete paradigm is designed to\nsolve the path constraints smartly to get test inputs that are not only\nsatisfiable to the constraints but also valid to the input syntax. Finally, a\nhistory-guided seed acquisition is employed to obtain new highly structured\ntest inputs either before testing starts or after testing is saturated.\n  We implemented Cottontail on top of SymCC and evaluated eight extensively\ntested open-source libraries across four different formats (XML, SQL,\nJavaScript, and JSON).

    "abstract": "The Sawada-Kotera (SK) equation is an integrable system characterized by a\nthird-order Lax operator and is related to the modified Sawada-Kotera (mSK)\nequation through a Miura transformation. This work formulates the\nRiemann-Hilbert problem associated with the SK and mSK equations by using\ndirect and inverse scattering transforms. The long-time asymptotic behaviors of\nthe solutions to these equations are then analyzed via the Deift-Zhou steepest\ndescent method for Riemann-Hilbert problems. It is shown that the asymptotic\nsolutions of the SK and mSK equations are categorized into four distinct\nregions: the decay region, the dispersive wave region, the Painlev\\'{e} region,\nand the rapid decay region. Notably, the Painlev\\'{e} region is governed by the\nF-XVIII equation in the Painlev\\'{e} classification of fourth-order ordinary\ndifferential equations, a fourth-order analogue of the Painlev\\'{e}\ntranscendents. This connection is established through the Riemann-Hilbert\nformulation in this work. Similar to the KdV equation, the SK equation exhibits\na transition region between the dispersive wave and Painlev\\'{e} regions,\narising from the special values of the reflection coefficients at the origin.\nFinally, numerical comparisons demonstrate that the asymptotic solutions agree\nexcellently with results from direct numerical simulations.",

This generalizes the known $O(\\log n / \\log \\log\nn)$ upper bound over words, and it matches the lower bound of $\\Omega(\\log n /\n\\log \\log n)$ from dynamic membership to some word languages and from the\nexistential marked ancestor problem.\n  Our second contribution is to introduce a class of regular languages, dubbed\nalmost-commutative tree languages, and show that dynamic membership to such\nlanguages under relabeling updates can be decided in constant time per update.\nAlmost-commutative languages generalize both commutative languages and finite\nlanguages: they are the analogue for trees of the ZG languages enjoying\nconstant-time dynamic membership over words. Our main technical contribution is\nto show that this class is conditionally optimal when we assume that the\nalphabet features a neutral letter, i.e., a letter that has no effect on\nmembership to the language.

    "abstract": "Table structure recognition aims to parse tables in unstructured data into\nmachine-understandable formats. Recent methods address this problem through a\ntwo-stage process or optimized one-stage approaches. However, these methods\neither require multiple networks to be serially trained and perform more\ntime-consuming sequential decoding, or rely on complex post-processing\nalgorithms to parse the logical structure of tables. They struggle to balance\ncross-scenario adaptability, robustness, and computational efficiency. In this\npaper, we propose a one-stage end-to-end table structure parsing network called\nTableCenterNet. This network unifies the prediction of table spatial and\nlogical structure into a parallel regression task for the first time, and\nimplicitly learns the spatial-logical location mapping laws of cells through a\nsynergistic architecture of shared feature extraction layers and task-specific\ndecoding. Compared with two-stage methods, our method is easier to train and\nfaster to infer. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that TableCenterNet can\neffectively parse table structures in diverse scenarios and achieve\nstate-of-the-art performance on the TableGraph-24k dataset.

High power consumption, significantly high cost of\nRF chain components per antenna and complex signal processing task at base band\nmakes digital beamforming unsuitable for implementation in massive MIMO system.\nHybrid beamforming takes the benefits of both analog and digital beamforming\nschemes.

However, most existing GR models are developed and evaluated\nusing a static document collection, and their performance in dynamic corpora\nwhere document collections evolve continuously is rarely studied. In this\npaper, we first reproduce and systematically evaluate various representative GR\napproaches over dynamic corpora. Through extensive experiments, we reveal that\nexisting GR models with \\textit{text-based} docids show superior generalization\nto unseen documents. We observe that the more fine-grained the docid design in\nthe GR model, the better its performance over dynamic corpora, surpassing BM25\nand even being comparable to dense retrieval methods. While GR models with\n\\textit{numeric-based} docids show high efficiency, their performance drops\nsignificantly over dynamic corpora. Furthermore, our experiments find that the\nunderperformance of numeric-based docids is partly due to their excessive\ntendency toward the initial document set, which likely results from overfitting\non the training set. We then conduct an in-depth analysis of the\nbest-performing GR methods. We identify three critical advantages of text-based\ndocids in dynamic corpora: (i) Semantic alignment with language models'\npretrained knowledge, (ii) Fine-grained docid design, and (iii) High lexical\ndiversity. Building on these insights, we finally propose a novel multi-docid\ndesign that leverages both the efficiency of numeric-based docids and the\neffectiveness of text-based docids, achieving improved performance in dynamic\ncorpus without requiring additional retraining.

    "abstract": "To segment medical images with distribution shifts, domain generalization\n(DG) has emerged as a promising setting to train models on source domains that\ncan generalize to unseen target domains. Existing DG methods are mainly based\non CNN or ViT architectures. Recently, advanced state space models, represented\nby Mamba, have shown promising results in various supervised medical image\nsegmentation. The success of Mamba is primarily owing to its ability to capture\nlong-range dependencies while keeping linear complexity with input sequence\nlength, making it a promising alternative to CNNs and ViTs. Inspired by the\nsuccess, in the paper, we explore the potential of the Mamba architecture to\naddress distribution shifts in DG for medical image segmentation. Specifically,\nwe propose a novel Mamba-based framework, Mamba-Sea, incorporating\nglobal-to-local sequence augmentation to improve the model's generalizability\nunder domain shift issues. Our Mamba-Sea introduces a global augmentation\nmechanism designed to simulate potential variations in appearance across\ndifferent sites, aiming to suppress the model's learning of domain-specific\ninformation. At the local level, we propose a sequence-wise augmentation along\ninput sequences, which perturbs the style of tokens within random continuous\nsub-sequences by modeling and resampling style statistics associated with\ndomain shifts. To our best knowledge, Mamba-Sea is the first work to explore\nthe generalization of Mamba for medical image segmentation, providing an\nadvanced and promising Mamba-based architecture with strong robustness to\ndomain shifts. Remarkably, our proposed method is the first to surpass a Dice\ncoefficient of 90% on the Prostate dataset, which exceeds previous SOTA of\n88.61%.

In\nPart I of the two-part paper, we have investigated securely computing linear\nfunctions with the wiretapper who can eavesdrop any edge subset up to a certain\nsize r, referred to as the security level, where the security function is the\nidentity function. The notion of this security is called source security. In\nthe current paper, we consider another interesting model which is the same as\nthe above one except that the security function is identical to the target\nfunction, i.e., we need to protect the information on the target function from\nbeing leaked to the wiretapper. The notion of this security is called\ntarget-function security. We first prove a non-trivial upper bound on the\nsecure computing capacity, which is applicable to arbitrary network topologies\nand arbitrary security levels. In particular, when the security level r is\nequal to 0, the upper bound reduces to the computing capacity without security\nconsideration. Further, from an algebraic point of view, we prove two\nequivalent conditions for target-function security and source security for the\nexistence of the corresponding linear function-computing secure network codes.\nWith them, for any linear function over a given finite field, we develop a code\nconstruction of linear secure network codes for target-function security and\nthus obtain a lower bound on the secure computing capacity; and also generalize\nthe code construction developed in Part I for source security.",

While it is\nrecognized as important in traditional software teams, its role in open-source\nsoftware development remains understudied. Open-source contributors often\ncollaborate without formal roles or structures, where interpersonal\nrelationships can significantly influence participation. Code review, a central\nand collaborative activity in modern software development, offers a valuable\ncontext for observing such team interactions. Aims: This study investigates\nwhether team-level psychological safety, inferred from code review activities,\nis associated with contributors' sustained participation in open-source\nprojects. Method: Using data from 60,684 pull requests across multiple\nrepositories, we developed a psychological safety index based on observable\ncues such as merge decisions, comment activity, interaction diversity, and\nmentions. We analyzed the relationship between this index and contributors'\nshort-term (within 1 year) and long-term (over 4--5 years) sustained\nparticipation using three logistic regression models. Results: Contributors are\nmore likely to remain active in repositories with higher levels of\npsychological safety. Psychological safety is positively associated with both\nshort-term and long-term sustained participation. However, prior participation\nemerges as a stronger predictor of future engagement, reducing the effect of\npsychological safety when accounted for.

Therefore, MSD is a standard subroutine to obtain a fault-tolerant\nuniversal set of quantum gate operations on error-corrected logical qubits.\nWell-known schemes conventionally rely on performing operator measurements and\npost-selection on the measurement result, which makes distillation protocols\nnon-deterministic in the presence of noise. In this work, we adapt the 15-to-1\nMSD protocol such that it deterministically suppresses noise by using a\ncoherent feedback network on the output states without the need to perform\nindividual qubit measurements. These advantages over textbook MSD come at the\nprice of reducing the noise suppression per round from $\\mathcal{O}(p^3)$ to\n$\\mathcal{O}(p^2)$. Our technique can be applied to any MSD protocol with an\nacceptance rate of 1 in the absence of noise. It may be desirable to use our\nscheme if the coherent feedback network can be executed faster and more\nreliably than the measurements and/or if logical clock cycles in the quantum\nprocessor should be kept synchronous at all times. Our result broadens the path\nof potential experimental realizations of MSD in near-term devices and advances\nthe development of fault-tolerant quantum computers with practical use.",

In\nthese two models producing 0.07 Msun 56Ni without mixing fallback, a large\namount of silicates (0.260 Msun) created in O-rich layers are also ejected and\nlikely to hide the spectral feature of carbonaceous grains. We then consider\nmixing-fallback that can reproduce the observed elemental abundance ratios of\nC-normal and C-enhanced extremely metal-poor stars in the Milky Way.

The symmetries that\nare spontaneously broken by the Higgs mechanism are then the global ones.\nSecond, we explain how the dressing field method singles out the Coulomb gauge\nas a preferred gauge for a gauge-invariant account of the Abelian Higgs\nmechanism.

For primordial black holes (PBHs) with\nan initial mass of $\\sim 5\\times10^{14}$ g, their lifespans are expected to end\nin the present epoch. Detecting such PBH bursts would provide compelling\nevidence of their existence. The Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO)\nhas the potential to observe these bursts at the high-energy end of the\ngamma-ray spectrum. To investigate this possibility, we conduct a study to\nevaluate the sensitivity of CTAO to the local burst rate density of PBHs. Our\nresults suggest that during a 5-year observational campaign, CTAO could exclude\na local burst rate density exceeding $\\sim 36\\ \\mathrm{pc}^{-3}\\\n\\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$, which represents an improvement of one order of magnitude\nover the upper limit set by the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory\n(LHAASO).

    "abstract": "We propose a novel sample selection method for image classification in the\npresence of noisy labels. Existing methods typically consider small-loss\nsamples as correctly labeled. However, some correctly labeled samples are\ninherently difficult for the model to learn and can exhibit high loss similar\nto mislabeled samples in the early stages of training. Consequently, setting a\nthreshold on per-sample loss to select correct labels results in a trade-off\nbetween precision and recall in sample selection: a lower threshold may miss\nmany correctly labeled hard-to-learn samples (low recall), while a higher\nthreshold may include many mislabeled samples (low precision). To address this\nissue, our goal is to accurately distinguish correctly labeled yet\nhard-to-learn samples from mislabeled ones, thus alleviating the trade-off\ndilemma. We achieve this by considering the trends in model prediction\nconfidence rather than relying solely on loss values. Empirical observations\nshow that only for correctly labeled samples, the model's prediction confidence\nfor the annotated labels typically increases faster than for any other classes.\nBased on this insight, we propose tracking the confidence gaps between the\nannotated labels and other classes during training and evaluating their trends\nusing the Mann-Kendall Test. A sample is considered potentially correctly\nlabeled if all its confidence gaps tend to increase. Our method functions as a\nplug-and-play component that can be seamlessly integrated into existing sample\nselection techniques. Experiments on several standard benchmarks and real-world\ndatasets demonstrate that our method enhances the performance of existing\nmethods for learning with noisy labels.",

Thanks to graph\ndynamics, GL can achieve fast convergence even over extremely sparse\ntopologies. However, the robustness of GL over dy- namic graphs to Byzantine\n(model poisoning) attacks remains unaddressed especially when Byzantine nodes\nattack the RPS protocol to scale up model poisoning. We address this issue by\nintroducing GRANITE, a framework for robust learning over sparse, dynamic\ngraphs in the presence of a fraction of Byzantine nodes. GRANITE relies on two\nkey components (i) a History-aware Byzantine-resilient Peer Sampling protocol\n(HaPS), which tracks previously encountered identifiers to reduce adversarial\ninfluence over time, and (ii) an Adaptive Probabilistic Threshold (APT), which\nleverages an estimate of Byzantine presence to set aggregation thresholds with\nformal guarantees. Empirical results confirm that GRANITE maintains convergence\nwith up to 30% Byzantine nodes, improves learning speed via adaptive filtering\nof poisoned models and obtains these results in up to 9 times sparser graphs\nthan dictated by current theory.",

The main findings are as follows: (1) The three AR parameters\nshow significant hemispheric asymmetry in cycles 23-25. The strong correlation\nbetween AR area and flux indicates that they can better reflect the intrinsic\nproperties of solar magnetic field. (2) The correlation between sunspot\nactivity and AR parameters varies in the two hemispheres across the different\ncycles. The AR parameters provide additional information for the variations in\nsunspot activity, which can better predict the intensity and cyclical changes\nof solar activity. (3) The variation in the fitting slope sign of the asymmetry\nindex for AR parameters reflects periodic changes in hemispheric ARs, providing\nvaluable insights into the activity of other stars. (4) Both the dominant\nhemisphere and the cumulative trend of AR parameters display a cycle-dependent\nbehavior. Moreover, the trend variations of AR area and flux are similar,\nreflecting the long-term evolutionary characteristics of solar magnetic field.\nOur analysis results are relevant for understanding the hemispheric coupling of\nsolar magnetic activity and its cyclic evolutionary patterns.",

Kinematics were selected to enhance the cross-section contribution\nfrom high-momentum nucleons originating from the strongly interacting,\nshort-distance components of two-nucleon SRCs (2N-SRCs), known to exhibit a\nuniversal structure across both light and heavy nuclei.We analyzed the A/$^2$H\nratio within the region dominated by 2N-SRCs to characterize the nuclear\ndependence of SRC contributions across various nuclei. Additionally, the\nA/$^3$He ratio was examined at kinematics sensitive to nucleons with even\nhigher momentum, aiming to identify signals indicative of three-nucleon SRCs\n(3N-SRCs). The traditional analysis method in the expected 3N-SRC region ($x >\n2$) did not yield a clear plateau; instead, the data diverged from the\npredicted 3N-SRC behavior as momentum transfer increased. However, when\nanalyzed in terms of the struck nucleon's light-cone momentum, the data\nexhibited the opposite trend, progressively approaching the predicted 3N-SRC\nplateau. These observations suggest that future measurements at higher energies\nmay facilitate a definitive isolation and identification of 3N-SRCs.",

Although\ntraditional physics-based models are effective, they are costly to maintain and\ndifficult to adapt to evolving system dynamics. Machine Learning (ML)\napproaches offer cost-efficient alternatives with greater adaptability. To\nsystematically assess the potential of ML for modeling urban infrastructure\nsystems, we propose a protocol for evaluating Neural Network architectures for\nCSS time series forecasting with respect to predictive performance, model\ncomplexity, and robustness to perturbations. In addition, we assess model\nperformance on peak events and critical fluctuations, as these are the key\nregimes for urban wastewater management. To investigate the feasibility of\nlightweight models suitable for IoT deployment, we compare global models, which\nhave access to all information, with local models, which rely solely on nearby\nsensor readings. Additionally, to explore the security risks posed by network\noutages or adversarial attacks on urban infrastructure, we introduce error\nmodels that assess the resilience of models. Our results demonstrate that while\nglobal models achieve higher predictive performance, local models provide\nsufficient resilience in decentralized scenarios, ensuring robust modeling of\nurban infrastructure. Furthermore, models with longer native forecast horizons\nexhibit greater robustness to data perturbations. These findings contribute to\nthe development of interpretable and reliable ML solutions for sustainable\nurban wastewater management. The implementation is available in our GitHub\nrepository.",

Multi-tier\ncompilation uses light-weight compilers at early stages and highly-optimizing\ncompilers at later stages in order to balance between compilation overheads and\ncode quality.\n  We propose a novel approach to enabling multi-tier compilation in the VMs\ngenerated by a meta-compiler framework. Instead of extending the JIT compiler\nbackend of the framework, our approach drives an existing (heavyweight)\ncompiler backend in the framework to quickly generate unoptimized native code\nby merely embedding directives and compile-time operations into interpreter\ndefinitions.\n  As a validation of the approach, we developed 2SOM, a Simple Object Machine\nwith a two-tier JIT compiler based on RPython. 2SOM first applies the tier-1\nthreaded code generator that is generated by our proposed technique, then, to\nthe loops that exceed a threshold, applies the tier-2 tracing JIT compiler that\nis generated by the original RPython framework. Our performance evaluation that\nruns a program with a realistic workload showed that 2SOM improved, when\ncompared against an RPython-based VM, warm-up performance by 15\\%, with merely\na 5\\% reduction in peak performance.",

However, optimizing thermoelectric performance remains a\nsignificant challenge due to the complex interplay between electronic and\nthermal transport properties. In this work, we systematically optimize $ZT$ in\ngraphene antidot lattices (GALs), nanostructured graphene sheets with periodic\nnanopores characterized by two geometric parameters: the hexagonal unit cell\nside length $L$ and the antidot radius $R$. The lattice thermal conductivity is\ndetermined through machine-learned potential-driven molecular dynamics (MD)\nsimulations, while electronic transport properties are computed using\nlinear-scaling quantum transport in combination with MD trajectories based on a\nbond-length-dependent tight-binding model. This method is able to account for\nelectron-phonon scattering, allowing access to diffusive transport in\nlarge-scale systems, overcoming limitations of previous methods based on\nnonequilibrium Green function formalism. Our results show that the introduction\nof the antidots effectively decouples lattice and electronic transport and lead\nto a favorable and significant violation of the Wiedemann-Franz law. We find\nthat optimal $ZT$ values occur in GALs with intermediate $L$ and $R$, closely\ncorrelated with peak power factor values.

To address\nthis, we introduce HMI, a Hierarchical knowledge management-based Multi-tenant\nInference system, designed to manage tenants with distinct PLMs\nresource-efficiently. Our approach is three-fold: Firstly, we categorize PLM\nknowledge into general, domain-specific, and task-specific. Leveraging insights\non knowledge acquisition across different model layers, we construct\nhierarchical PLMs (hPLMs) by extracting and storing knowledge at different\nlevels, significantly reducing GPU memory usage per tenant. Secondly, we\nestablish hierarchical knowledge management for hPLMs generated by various\ntenants in HMI. We manage domain-specific knowledge with acceptable storage\nincreases by constructing and updating domain-specific knowledge trees based on\nfrequency. We manage task-specific knowledge within limited GPU memory through\nparameter swapping. Finally, we propose system optimizations to enhance\nresource utilization and inference throughput. These include fine-grained\npipelining via hierarchical knowledge prefetching to overlap CPU and I/O\noperations with GPU computations, and optimizing parallel implementations with\nbatched matrix multiplications. Our experimental results demonstrate that the\nproposed HMI can efficiently serve up to 10,000 hPLMs (hBERTs and hGPTs) on a\nsingle GPU, with only a negligible compromise in accuracy.",

In this work, we explore an orthogonal direction and process long\ninputs without long context LMMs. We propose Frame Selection Augmented\nGeneration (FRAG), where the model first selects relevant frames within the\ninput, and then only generates the final outputs based on the selected frames.\nThe core of the selection process is done by scoring each frame independently,\nwhich does not require long context processing. The frames with the highest\nscores are then selected by a simple Top-K selection.

Particularly in\nthe nondeterministic setting, the $\\forall\\exists$ relational Hoare logic is\nrequired. Existing approaches encode this logic into a Hoare logic with ghost\nstates and invariants, yet these extensions significantly increase\nformalization complexity and soundness proof overhead. This paper proposes a\ngeneric encoding theory that reduces the $\\forall\\exists$ relational Hoare\nlogic to standard (unary) Hoare logic. Precisely, we propose to redefine the\nvalidity of relational Hoare triples while preserving the original proof rules\nand then encapsulate the $\\forall\\exists$ pattern within assertions. We have\nproved that the validity of encoded standard Hoare triples is equivalent to the\nvalidity of the desired relational Hoare triples. Moreover, the encoding theory\ndemonstrates how common relational Hoare logic proof rules are indeed special\ncases of standard Hoare logic proof rules, and relational proof steps\ncorrespond to standard proof steps.

Given a multi-view\nobject scan and a long-form monocular video of human-object interaction, POD\niteratively trains a neural network to predict local part poses from RGB\nframes, uses this predictor to initialize a global optimization which refines\noutput poses through inverse rendering, then finally distills the results of\noptimization back into the model by generating synthetic self-labeled training\ndata from novel viewpoints. Each iteration improves both the predictive model\nand the optimized motion trajectory, creating a virtuous cycle that bootstraps\nits own training data to learn about the pose configurations of an object. We\nalso introduce a quasi-multiview mining strategy for reducing depth ambiguity\nby leveraging long video. We evaluate POD on 14 real-world and 5 synthetic\nobjects with various joint types, including revolute and prismatic joints as\nwell as multi-body configurations where parts detach or reattach independently.\nPOD demonstrates significant improvement over a pure optimization baseline\nwhich gets stuck in local minima, particularly for longer videos.

We first do a\nfast review of the current state of the art focusing mainly on distributed\nhistorical graph databases to provide the context of our proposals. We\ninvestigate the im- plementation of an enhanced vertex-centric storage model in\nMongoDB that prioritizes space efficiency by leveraging in-database query\nmechanisms to minimize redundant data and reduce storage costs.

Our experimental results both in centralized\nand distributed infrastructures, demonstrate significant improvements in query\nperformance, particularly for resource-intensive global queries that\ntraditionally suffer from inefficiencies in entity-centric frameworks. The\nproposed model achieves these gains by optimizing memory usage, reducing client\ninvolvement, and exploiting the computational capabilities of MongoDB.

In the first stage, we perform\ntextual discriminative knowledge distillation from a powerful LLM-based teacher\nmodel to enhance the embedding capability of the MLLM\\'s language component.

Specifically, we\ninitially mitigate false negative contamination and then sample multiple hard\nnegatives per instance within each batch, forcing the model to focus on\nchallenging samples. This approach not only improves discriminative power but\nalso enhances instruction-following ability in downstream tasks.

Heterogeneous strategy\nis efficient to extend scanning range but quantitatively characterization of\nthe effect is critically needed to guide design for achieving desired\nperformance. The proposed SES method derives theoretically the relationship\nbetween scanning range and the 3dB-beamwidth of the pattern envelope of one\nphased array, which is linear superposition of active radiation pattern (AEP)\nmagnitude of each element. Therefore, the contribution of each kind of\nheterogeneity can be quantitatively analyzed for further enhancing the scanning\nrange. As we see, a high active reflection coefficient of the phased array can\ndirectly reduce the realized gain. In this way, one ARC method is proposed to\nreduce the active reflection coefficient by counteracting the reflection\ncomponent of active reflection coefficient with its transmission component,\nthereby keeping the realized gain efficiently even when the array scans at\nlarge angels. For verification, one 24.5-29.5GHz 4x4 phased array scanning in\nE-plane is designed and fabricated. Benefiting from the proposed SES method,\nthe scanning range of the prototype is extended up to $\\pm74\\deg$, around\n10{\\deg} improvement over one traditional heterogeneous array.

Objective: We introduce the concept of Aging Debt (AD),\nrepresenting the increased maintenance efforts and costs needed to keep\nsoftware updated. We study AD through Self-Admitted Aging Debt (SAAD) observed\nin source code comments left by software developers. Method: We employ a\nmixed-methods approach, combining qualitative and quantitative analyses to\ndetect and measure AD in software. This includes framing SAAD patterns from the\nsource code comments after analysing the source code context, then utilizing\nthe SAAD patterns to detect SAAD comments. In the process, we develop a\ntaxonomy for SAAD that reflects the temporal aging of software and its\nassociated debt. Then we utilize the taxonomy to quantify the different types\nof AD prevalent in OSS repositories. Results: Our proposed taxonomy categorizes\ntemporal software aging into Active and Dormant types. Our extensive analysis\nof over 9,000+ Open Source Software (OSS) repositories reveals that more than\n21% repositories exhibit signs of SAAD as observed from our gold standard SAAD\ndataset.

These so-called model\nspin-ups are computationally expensive, often requiring many years of simulated\ntime, particularly when the initial DTWT configuration is far from steady\nstate.\n  To accelerate the model spin-up process we developed HydroStartML, a machine\nlearning emulator trained on steady-state DTWT configurations across the\ncontiguous United States.

Existing\nmethods struggle to generate high-quality and temporally consistent results\nwhen handling complex clothing patterns and diverse body poses.

Our approach employs generated\nanimatable textured 3D meshes as explicit frame-level guidance, alleviating the\nissue of models over-focusing on appearance fidelity at the expanse of motion\ncoherence. This is achieved by enabling direct reference to consistent garment\ntexture movements throughout video sequences.

We further introduce a\nrobust rectangular masking strategy that successfully mitigates artifact\npropagation caused by leaking clothing information during dynamic human and\ngarment movements.

Our approach introduces a novel\nsynthesis of techniques from fractional partial differential equations and\ncontrol theory, combining several key ingredients in an original and effective\nmanner:\n  1. Boundary observability for low-frequency solutions of the fractional wave\nequation. We begin by analyzing the associated fractional wave equation. Using\na fractional analogue of Pohozaev's identity, we establish a partial boundary\nobservability result for the low-frequency solutions. The corresponding\nobservability time horizon increases with the eigenmode frequency, reflecting\nthe inherently slower propagation speed of the fractional waves.\n  2. Transmutation to the parabolic setting. Using transmutation techniques, we\ntransfer the observability results from the wave setting to the parabolic one.\nThis yields a frequency-dependent observability inequality for the fractional\nheat equation, which - via duality - enables control of its low-frequency\ncomponents.\n  3. Frequency-wise iteration. Leveraging the dissipative nature of the\nfractional heat equation, we develop an iterative procedure to successively\ncontrol the entire frequency spectrum of solutions. The condition $s \\in (1/2,\n1)$ is crucial in this analysis, as it guarantees sufficient decay of\nhigh-frequency components, enabling the convergence of the iteration.\n  4. Duality. By a duality argument, we derive boundary observability from the\nboundary controllability of the fractional heat equation. Remarkably, this type\nof boundary observability result is entirely new in the multi-dimensional\nsetting and appears to be out of reach for existing methods. \\end{itemize}",

The sequences of dwell times of\nfunctionally different channel states also exhibit long-range correlations. We\nhave found that the memory effect within the dwell-time series is related to\nthe coupling between the channel's activation gate (AG) and selectivity filter\n(SF), which controls the ion conduction. In this work, we analyzed both the\nexperimental data describing the activity of potassium channels of different\ntypes (e.g., BK, mitoBK, mitoTASK-3, mitoKv1.3, TREK-2-like channels) and the\nseries generated according to our previously proposed Hurst effect model. The\nobtained results suggest that the strength of the allosteric cooperation\nbetween the AG and SF determines not only the conductance of the channel -\nwhich governs how often ions in SF move or remain blocked - but also modulates\nthe correlations present in the dwell times when sampled with a suitably high\nsampling rate. Moreover, we found that rectification can interfere with this\nprocess, contributing to additional changes in correlations within the\nchannel's sojourns in subsequent states. Similarly, the correlations may be\naffected by processes proceeding at longer time scales, like interactions with\nthe channel's auxiliary domains or lipid surroundings.",

The analysis explores this property\nacross different rapidity ranges, collision centralities, and collision\nenergies, while also examining the roles of multi-parton interactions (MPI) and\ncolor reconnection (CR) mechanisms. The results show that the light nuclei\nyield ratio remains stable with changes in rapidity coverage and collision\ncentrality but slightly increases with rising collision energy. The impact of\nCR on the light nuclei yield ratio depends entirely on the presence of MPI;\nwhen MPI is turned off, CR has no effect. Additionally, the three-nucleon\ncorrelation, enhances the light nuclei yield ratio in both central and\nperipheral collisions. However, the non-monotonic energy dependence observed in\nexperiments, the peak at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}$ = $20\\sim30$ GeV reported by the\nSTAR experiment, cannot be explained by the Angantyr model due to its lack of\nkey mechanisms related to the quark-gluon plasma (QGP). Nevertheless, the\nAngantyr model serves as an important baseline for studying collision behaviors\nin the absence of QGP effects.",

Furthermore, user-friendly human interaction with the\nsystem is essential for its adoption and some of the participants confirmed\nthey would be happy to be in the loop and provide necessary feedback that the\nsystem can learn from.

It is a pair of\nincidence-preserving vertex- and edge-mappings between two graphs, the\nedge-component being bijective on the edge-neighborhoods of every vertex and\nits image. In line with the current trends in topological graph theory and its\napplications in mathematical physics, graphs are considered in the most relaxed\nform and as such they may contain multiple edges, loops and semi-edges.\n  Nevertheless, simple graphs (binary structures without multiple edges, loops,\nor semi-edges) play an important role. It has been conjectured in [Bok et al.:\nList covering of regular multigraphs, Proceedings IWOCA 2022, LNCS 13270, pp.\n228--242] that for every fixed graph $H$, deciding if a graph covers $H$ is\neither polynomial time solvable for arbitrary input graphs, or NP-complete for\nsimple ones. A graph $A$ is called stronger than a graph $B$ if every simple\ngraph that covers $A$ also covers $B$. This notion was defined and found useful\nfor NP-hardness reductions for disconnected graphs in [Bok et al.:\nComputational complexity of covering disconnected multigraphs, Proceedings FCT\n2022, LNCS 12867, pp. 85--99].

Such an initial step generates a design space across which the\nregions of interest are determined to formulate a shape optimization problem\ntargeting at the maximization of the signal internally to the nanotubes by\nmodifying their boundary surface while maintaining the values for the remaining\noperational parameters. An IsoGeometric-Analysis-based Boundary Element Method\n(IGABEM) is employed for estimating the electric field around nanotube\nboundaries, which is subsequently used towards the overall solution of the\nboundary value problem. A combination of global and local optimizers along with\ngeometric parametric models that generate valid nanotube cross sections\ncomplement the IGABEM method in the quest of optimal designs. The achieved\noptimal shapes attain substantial boost in the concentration of the electric\nfield which can easily exceed, by 30 times or more, the corresponding value\nobtained by circular nanotube pairs. This superior performance is maintained\nfor a large range of wave angles and nanotube areas and, accordingly, the\nrobustness of the obtained results and their potential applicability in a wide\nrange of applications, is demonstrated.

A point $p$ on $P$ is covered if it is part of a subtrajectory\n$\\pi_p$ of $P$ such that there is a center $c\\in\\mathcal{C}$ whose Fr\\'echet\ndistance to $\\pi_p$ is at most $\\Delta$. We present an approximation algorithm\nfor this problem with a running time of $O((n^2\\ell +\n\\sqrt{k_\\Delta}n^{5/2})\\log^2n)$, where $k_\\Delta$ is the size of an optimal\nsolution. The algorithm gives a bicriterial approximation guarantee that\nrelaxes the Fr\\'echet distance threshold by a constant factor and the size of\nthe solution by a factor of $O(\\log n)$. The second problem variant asks for\nthe maximum fraction of the input curve $P$ that can be covered using $k$\ncenter curves, where $k\\leq n$ is a parameter to the algorithm. Here, we show\nthat our techniques lead to an algorithm with a running time of\n$O((k+\\ell)n^2\\log^2 n)$ and similar approximation guarantees. Note that in\nboth algorithms $k,k_\\Delta\\in O(n)$ and hence the running time is cubic, or\nbetter if $k\\ll n$.",

Instead of directly optimizing the parameters, DR-FWI optimizes\nthe network weights to reconstruct them, thereby embedding structural priors\nand facilitating optimization. To provide benchmark guidelines for the design\nof DR-FWI, we conduct a comparative analysis of three representative\narchitectures (U-Net, CNN, MLP) combined with two initial model embedding\nstrategies: one pretraining the network to generate predefined initial models\n(pretraining-based), while the other directly adds network outputs to the\ninitial models. Extensive ablation experiments show that combining CNN with\npretraining-based initialization significantly enhances inversion accuracy,\noffering valuable insights into network design. To further understand the\nmechanism of DR-FWI, spectral bias analysis reveals that the network first\ncaptures low-frequency features and gradually reconstructs high-frequency\ndetails, enabling an adaptive multi-scale inversion strategy. Notably, the\nrobustness of DR-FWI is validated under various noise levels and sparse\nacquisition scenarios, where its strong performance with limited shots and\nreceivers demonstrates reduced reliance on dense observational data.\nAdditionally, a backbone-branch structure is proposed to extend DR-FWI to\nmultiparameter inversion, and its efficacy in mitigating cross-parameter\ninterference is validated on a synthetic anomaly model and the Marmousi2 model.\nThese results suggest a promising direction for joint inversion involving\nmultiple parameters or multiphysics.",

Quantum chemical simulations on glycolamide\n(NH$_2$C(O)CH$_2$OH) formation on interstellar ice mantles, mimicked by a water\nice cluster model, are presented. Glycolamide synthesis has been here modeled\nconsidering a stepwise process: the coupling between formaldehyde (H$_2$CO) and\nthe radical of formamide (NH$_2$CO$^{\\bullet}$) occurs first, forming the\nglycolamide precursor NH$_2$C(O)CH$_2$O$^{\\bullet}$, which is then hydrogenated\nto give anti-glycolamide.

The\nreaction barrier for NH$_2$C(O)CH$_2$O$^{\\bullet}$ formation varies from 9 to\n26 kJ mol$^{-1}$, depending on surface binding sites. Kinetic studies indicate\nthat this reaction step is feasible in environments with a $T > 35~\\text{K}$,\nuntil desorption of the reactants. The hydrogenation step leading to\nanti-glycolamide presents almost no energy barrier due to the easy H atom\ndiffusion towards the NH$_2$C(O)CH$_2$O$^{\\bullet}$ intermediate.

In enf2enf, input geometries are encoded into\nlatent point cloud embeddings that inherently preserve geometric grounding and\ncapture local phenomena. The resulting representations are then combined with\nglobal parameters and directly decoded into continuous output fields, thus\nefficiently modeling the coupling between geometry and physics. By leveraging\nthe inductive biases of locality and translation invariance, our approach is\nable to capture fine-scale physical features as well as complex shape\nvariations, thereby enhancing generalization and physical compliance. Extensive\nexperiments on a high-fidelity aerodynamic dataset, a hyper-elastic material\nbenchmark, and multi-element airfoil geometries, demonstrate that the proposed\nmodel achieves superior or competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art\ngraph based, operator learning, and neural field methods.

Recent advances in Multimodal Large\nLanguage Models (MLLMs) offer promising capabilities in temporal grounding and\nvideo understanding, soccer commentary generation often requires precise\ntemporal localization and semantically rich descriptions over long-form video.\nHowever, existing soccer MLLMs often rely on the temporal a priori for caption\ngeneration, so they cannot process the soccer video end-to-end.

To solve the\nabove issues, we present TimeSoccer, the first end-to-end soccer MLLM for\nSingle-anchor Dense Video Captioning (SDVC) in full-match soccer videos.\nTimeSoccer jointly predicts timestamps and generates captions in a single pass,\nenabling global context modeling across 45-minute matches.

All models undergo hyperparameter optimization to enable fair\ncomparisons in terms of predictive accuracy and computational efficiency,\nevaluated using established quantitative metrics. Among the models, the Kernel\nRidge Regressor demonstrates the best trade-off between accuracy and\nefficiency, achieving high predictive accuracy, low prediction time, and\nminimal training overhead-making it a strong candidate for general-purpose\nsurrogate modeling. The Gaussian Process Regressor provides an attractive\nalternative when uncertainty quantification is required, although it incurs\nadditional computational cost due to variance estimation. The generalization\ncapability of the Kernel Ridge model is validated on an unseen simulation\nscenario, confirming its ability to transfer to new configurations. Database\ngeneration constitutes the dominant cost in the surrogate modeling process.\nNevertheless, the approach proves practical and efficient for multi-query\ntasks, even when accounting for this initial expense.",

To address the challenges posed by M-MRE, we further propose a\nPrompt Format Adapter (PFA) that is fully compatible with various Large\nVision-Language Models (LVLMs).

It aims to synthesize images tailored to\nindividual style preferences (e.g., color schemes, character appearances,\nlayout) and semantic intentions (e.g., emotion, action, scene contexts) by\nleveraging user-interacted history images and multimodal instructions. Despite\nnotable progress, existing methods -- whether based on diffusion models, large\nlanguage models, or Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) -- struggle to accurately\ncapture and fuse user style preferences and semantic intentions. In particular,\nthe state-of-the-art LMM-based method suffers from the entanglement of visual\nfeatures, leading to Guidance Collapse, where the generated images fail to\npreserve user-preferred styles or reflect the specified semantics.\n  To address these limitations, we introduce DRC, a novel personalized image\ngeneration framework that enhances LMMs through Disentangled Representation\nComposition. DRC explicitly extracts user style preferences and semantic\nintentions from history images and the reference image, respectively, to form\nuser-specific latent instructions that guide image generation within LMMs.\nSpecifically, it involves two critical learning stages: 1) Disentanglement\nlearning, which employs a dual-tower disentangler to explicitly separate style\nand semantic features, optimized via a reconstruction-driven paradigm with\ndifficulty-aware importance sampling; and 2) Personalized modeling, which\napplies semantic-preserving augmentations to effectively adapt the disentangled\nrepresentations for robust personalized generation. Extensive experiments on\ntwo benchmarks demonstrate that DRC shows competitive performance while\neffectively mitigating the guidance collapse issue, underscoring the importance\nof disentangled representation learning for controllable and effective\npersonalized image generation.",

Achieving more synergy\nbetween different energy sectors and manufacturing processes could lead to\nsubstantial improvements. Energy hubs are already well-known solutions for\nstudying multi-carrier energy systems. In the present study, a multi-carrier\nhub is defined as a geographic area where different processes take place to\nconvert energy and material flows possibly consumed locally, stored, or\nexported. Hub boundaries correspond to an area small enough to neglect losses\nwhen energy and materials flows are exchanged between the processes. A general\nformulation is introduced to model such a hub. This formalism encompasses all\nthe possible configurations without limitations or preconceptions regarding\nused carriers or processes' architecture. For this purpose, a new hub\nrepresentation is proposed that allows optimization while considering all\npossible arrangements (parallel, serial, or a combination of them). It is\nimplemented in a framework that allows the creation of several multi-carrier\nhubs and connecting some of them to exchange flows through dedicated networks.\nThe formalism is based on linear programming (LP). The features of the\ndeveloped framework are illustrated by a case study consisting of a network\nmade of three hubs and considering heat, electricity, water, and hydrogen\nflows.The study aims to optimally schedule processes usage and materials and\nenergy storage to minimize the cost of imported resources.

Here, we\nreport the development of a wearable optical sensor watch that integrates\nsurface plasmon resonance (SPR) technology with a functionalized silver-coated\nsilicon nanowire (Ag/SiNW) substrate for real-time, non-invasive glucose\nmonitoring in sweat. The nanostructured sensor is functionalized with\n4-mercaptophenylboronic acid (4-MPBA), enabling selective glucose capture and\noptical signal transduction through both Raman scattering and SPR shift. The\ndual-mode detection strategy was systematically optimized, and a miniaturized\nSPR system operating at 638 nm was successfully integrated into a wearable\nwatch format with wireless data transmission to a mobile application. This\nwearable device demonstrated excellent sensitivity (LOD down to 0.12 mM) and\nhigh selectivity in detecting glucose within physiological sweat concentration\nranges. Human subject trials confirmed its applicability in real-life\nscenarios. This study offers a promising non-invasive alternative to\ntraditional CGM and highlights the potential of integrating nanophotonic\nsensors with wearable platforms for continuous health monitoring and\npersonalized medicine.",

    "abstract": "We initiate the study of approximate maximum matching in the vertex partition\nmodel, for graphs subject to dynamic changes. We assume that the $n$ vertices\nof the graph are partitioned among $k$ players, who execute a distributed\nalgorithm and communicate via message passing. An adaptive adversary may\nperform dynamic updates to the graph topology by inserting or removing edges\nbetween the nodes, and the algorithm needs to respond to these changes by\nadapting the output of the players, with the goal of maintaining an approximate\nmaximum matching. The main performance metric in this setting is the\nalgorithm's update time, which corresponds to the number of rounds required for\nupdating the solution upon an adversarial change. For the standard setting of\nsingle-edge insertions and deletions, we obtain the following results:\n  We give a randomized Las Vegas algorithm with an expected update time of $O(\n\\frac{\\sqrt{m}}{\\beta k} )$ rounds that maintains a $\\frac{2}{3}$-approximate\nmaximum matching that is also maximal, where $m$ is the number of edges of the\ngraph. We also show that any algorithm has a worst case update time of $\\Omega(\n\\frac{n}{\\beta k^2\\log n} )$, assuming a link bandwidth of $O(\\beta\\log n)$\nbits per round, if it maintains a matching that is maximal and does not have\nany 3-augmenting paths. For batch-dynamic updates, where the adversary may\nmodify up to $\\ell\\ge 1$ edges at once, we prove the following: There is a\nrandomized algorithm that succeeds with high probability in maintaining a\n$\\frac{2}{3}$-approximate maximum matching and has a worst case update time of\n$\\Omega( \\frac{\\ell\\log n}{\\sqrt{\\beta k}} )$ rounds.

Theoretical computer science has\ndeveloped numerous fine-grained frameworks for analyzing algorithmic\nperformance beyond standard worst-case analysis, such as instance optimality\nand output sensitivity. Haeupler et al. [FOCS '24] consider the notion of\nuniversal optimality, a refined complexity measure that accounts for both the\ngraph topology and the edge weights. For a fixed graph topology, the universal\nrunning time of a weighted graph algorithm is defined as its worst-case running\ntime over all possible edge weightings of G. An algorithm is universally\noptimal if no other algorithm achieves a better asymptotic universal running\ntime on any particular graph topology. They show that Dijkstra's algorithm can\nbe made universally optimal by replacing the heap with a custom data structure.\n  We revisit their result. We introduce a simple heap property called timestamp\noptimality, where the cost of popping an element x is logarithmic in the number\nof elements inserted between pushing and popping x. We show that timestamp\noptimal heaps are not only easier to define but also easier to implement.

    "abstract": "This paper develops a conditional independence (CI) test from a conditional\ndensity ratio (CDR) for weakly dependent data. The main contribution is\npresenting a closed-form expression for the estimated conditional density ratio\nfunction with good finite-sample performance. The key idea is exploiting the\nlinear sieve combined with the quadratic norm. Matsushita et al. (2022)\nexploited the linear sieve to estimate the unconditional density ratio. We must\nexploit the linear sieve twice to estimate the conditional density ratio.\nFirst, we estimate an unconditional density ratio with an unweighted sieve\nleast-squares regression, as done in Matsushita et al. (2022), and then the\nconditional density ratio with a weighted sieve least-squares regression, where\nthe weights are the estimated unconditional density ratio. The proposed test\nhas several advantages over existing alternatives. First, the test statistic is\ninvariant to the monotone transformation of the data distribution and has a\nclosed-form expression that enhances computational speed and efficiency.\nSecond, the conditional density ratio satisfies the moment restrictions. The\nestimated ratio satisfies the empirical analog of those moment restrictions. As\na result, the estimated density ratio is unlikely to have extreme values.\nThird, the proposed test can detect all deviations from conditional\nindependence at rates arbitrarily close to $n^{-1/2}$ , and the local power\nloss is independent of the data dimension. A small-scale simulation study\nindicates that the proposed test outperforms the alternatives in various\ndependence structures.",

    "abstract": "This study proposes a novel design methodology for neutron beam shutters that\nintegrates Monte Carlo simulations (MCNP) with machine learning techniques to\nenhance shielding performance and accelerate the design process. The target\nfacility is a compact neutron science platform where neutrons are produced by\nproton beams from a cyclotron striking a neutron production target. The system\nincludes both thermal and fast neutron beamlines. A beam shutter is installed\non the thermal neutron line to reduce occupational radiation exposure during\nmaintenance activities.\n  In this work, 200 neutron shutter configurations with varying material\nsequences were simulated using MCNP. The resulting dataset was used to train a\nfully connected neural network to predict the neutron flux downstream of the\nshielding. The trained model was subsequently applied to 1,000 randomly\ngenerated shielding configurations for rapid flux prediction and performance\nranking. The 20 designs with the lowest predicted flux were selected and\nfurther validated via MCNP simulations.\n  Results show that the optimal design reduces the neutron flux from 5.61 x\n10^9 n/cm2*s at the shutter entrance to 4.96 x 10^5 n/cm2*s at the exit,\nachieving a reduction of four orders of magnitude.

A compromise approach involves predicting bias\ninformation using extensively pretrained foundation models, which requires\nlarge-scale data and becomes impractical for resource-limited rare domains. To\naddress these challenges, we offer a novel perspective by reframing the\nspurious correlations as imbalances or mismatches in class-conditional\ndistributions, and propose a simple yet effective robust learning method that\neliminates the need for both bias annotations and predictions. With the goal of\nreducing the mutual information between spurious factors and label information,\nour method leverages a sample reweighting strategy to achieve class-conditional\ndistribution balancing, which automatically highlights minority groups and\nclasses, effectively dismantling spurious correlations and producing a debiased\ndata distribution for classification.

These tasks enable informed decision-making, risk\nmanagement, strategic planning, and superior portfolio returns. Despite their\nimportance, forecasting and prediction are challenging due to the dynamic\nnature of stock price data, which exhibit significant temporal variations in\ndistribution and statistical properties. Additionally, while both forecasting\nand prediction targets are derived from the same dataset, their statistical\ncharacteristics differ significantly. Forecasting targets typically follow a\nlog-normal distribution, characterized by significant shifts in mean and\nvariance over time, whereas prediction targets adhere to a normal distribution.\nFurthermore, although multi-step forecasting and prediction offer a broader\nperspective and richer information compared to single-step approaches, it is\nmuch more challenging due to factors such as cumulative errors and long-term\ntemporal variance. As a result, many previous works have tackled either\nsingle-step stock price forecasting or prediction instead. To address these\nissues, we introduce a novel model, termed Patched Channel Integration Encoder\n(PCIE), to tackle both stock price forecasting and prediction. In this model,\nwe utilize multiple stock channels that cover both historical prices and price\nchanges, and design a novel tokenization method to effectively embed these\nchannels in a cross-channel and temporally efficient manner.

MOON incorporates hybrid optical switching (HOS) combining\noptical circuit switching (OCS) and optical time slotted switching (OTS)\ncapabilities that appropriately maps different traffic types to them.\nSpecifically, the OCS network slice explicitly serves aggregated traffic of\nlong duration and high volume, while OTS network slice serves short bursty\ntraffic. In order to provide flexibility, separate sets of wavelengths are used\nfor OCS and OTS traffic service, both within a metro-access network (MAN)\n(intra-MAN) and between different MANs (inter-MAN). We extensively study the\nrequired number of wavelengths to efficiently serve OCS and OTS traffic for\nintra- and inter-MAN communication scenarios, taking into account their\nspecific traffic access requirements in an effort to optimize wavelengths\nutilization. In our study, we assume nonblocking OCS communication for\nimmediate access; therefore the number of required OCS wavelengths depends only\non the number of nodes, while the number of required OTS wavelengths to obtain\na desired QoS and latency level is independent from the number for OCS\nwavelengths. Simulation results show that within an OTS intra-MAN we achieve\nend-to-end (E2E) latency in submilliseconds scale, suitable for dynamic bursty\ntraffic, while it is an decreasing function of the number of used OTS\nwavelengths.",

However, these embeddings are difficult to\nunderstand and integrate with external knowledge, limiting the effectiveness of\napplications such as customer segmentation, search navigation, and product\nrecommendations. To address this, our paper introduces the concept of the\ncustomer persona. Condensed from a customer's numerous purchasing histories, a\ncustomer persona provides a multi-faceted and human-readable characterization\nof specific purchase behaviors and preferences, such as Busy Parents or Bargain\nHunters.\n  This work then focuses on representing each customer by multiple personas\nfrom a predefined set, achieving readable and informative explicit user\nrepresentations. To this end, we propose an effective and efficient solution\nGPLR. To ensure effectiveness, GPLR leverages pre-trained LLMs to infer\npersonas for customers. To reduce overhead, GPLR applies LLM-based labeling to\nonly a fraction of users and utilizes a random walk technique to predict\npersonas for the remaining customers. We further propose RevAff, which provides\nan absolute error $\\epsilon$ guarantee while improving the time complexity of\nthe exact solution by a factor of at least\n$O(\\frac{\\epsilon\\cdot|E|N}{|E|+N\\log N})$, where $N$ represents the number of\ncustomers and products, and $E$ represents the interactions between them.

As a result, human annotators, who play a critical role in curating\ntraining data in practice, can easily detect and filter out these unnatural\ntexts during manual inspection, reducing the risk of such attacks. We argue\nthat a key criterion for a successful attack is for text with and without\ntriggers to be indistinguishable to humans. However, prior work neither\ndirectly nor comprehensively evaluated attack subtlety and invisibility with\nhuman involvement. We bridge the gap by conducting thorough human evaluations\nto assess attack subtlety. We also propose \\emph{AttrBkd}, consisting of three\nrecipes for crafting subtle yet effective trigger attributes, such as\nextracting fine-grained attributes from existing baseline backdoor attacks. Our\nhuman evaluations find that AttrBkd with these baseline-derived attributes is\noften more effective (higher attack success rate) and more subtle (fewer\ninstances detected by humans) than the original baseline backdoor attacks,\ndemonstrating that backdoor attacks can bypass detection by being inconspicuous\nand appearing natural even upon close inspection, while still remaining\neffective.

This prescription\nallows one to accommodate shift-symmetric and non-shift-symmetric scalar-tensor\ntheories by taking a particular weak coupling limit, with and without\nconsistency conditions respectively. We deal with the DM sector as a\nnon-relativistic perfect fluid, which can be described by a system of three\nscalar fields.

We explore the same in transonic to supersonic compressible turbulence\nof an isothermal ideal gas in two dimensions, driven by large-scale solenoidal\nand irrotational stirring forces, via direct numerical simulations. We find\nthat the scaling exponents of the order-$p$ negative moments of the\ndistribution of exit times -- in particular, the doubling and halving times of\npair separations -- are nonlinear functions of $p$. Furthermore, the doubling\nand halving time statistics are different. The halving-time exponents are\nuniversal -- they satisfy their multifractal model-based prediction,\nirrespective of the nature of the stirring. However, the doubling-time\nexponents are not. In the solenoidally-stirred flows, the doubling time\nexponents can be expressed solely in terms of the multifractal scaling\nexponents obtained from the structure functions of the solenoidal component of\nthe velocity. Moreover, they depend strongly on the Mach number, $\\Ma$, as\nelongated patches of high vorticity emerge along shock fronts at high $\\Ma$. In\ncontrast, in the irrotationally-stirred flows, the doubling-time exponents do\nnot satisfy any known multifractal model-based relation, and are independent of\n$\\Ma$.

The non-integrability proof for\n$g\\neq0$ based on the fact that the equations of motion for the sliding top are\na perturbation of the classical top equations of motion. We show that the\nintegrability of the classical top is a necessary condition for the\nintegrability of the sliding top. Among four integrable classical top cases the\ncorresponding two cases for the sliding top are also integrable, and for the\ntwo remaining cases, we prove their non-integrability by analyzing the\ndifferential Galois group of variational equations along a certain particular\nsolution. In the absence of constant gravitational field $g=0$ the\nintegrability is much more difficult. At first, we proved that if the sliding\ntop problem is integrable, then the body is symmetric.

However, no observational evidence for P9 has been found so far, as its\npredicted orbit lies far beyond Neptune, where it reflects only a faint amount\nof Sunlight. This work aims to find P9 candidates by taking advantage of two\nfar-infrared all-sky surveys, which are IRAS and AKARI. The epochs of these two\nsurveys were separated by 23 years, which is large enough to detect the\n~3'/year orbital motion of P9. We use a dedicated AKARI Far-Infrared point\nsource list for our P9 search - AKARI Monthly Unconfirmed Source List, which\nincludes sources detected repeatedly only in hours timescale, but not after\nmonths. We search for objects that moved slowly between IRAS and AKARI\ndetections given in the catalogues. First, we estimated the expected flux and\norbital motion of P9 by assuming its mass, distance, and effective temperature\nto ensure it can be detected by IRAS and AKARI, then applied the positional and\nflux selection criteria to narrow down the number of sources from the\ncatalogues. Next, we produced all possible candidate pairs whose angular\nseparations were limited between 42' and 69.6', corresponding to the\nheliocentric distance range of 500 - 700 AU and the mass range of 7 - 17 Earth\nmasses. There are 13 pairs obtained after the selection criteria. After image\ninspection, we found one good candidate, of which the IRAS source is absent\nfrom the same coordinate in the AKARI image after 23 years and vice versa.\nHowever, AKARI and IRAS detections are not enough to determine the full orbit\nof this candidate.

In this paper, we propose\nto combine a novel static analysis approach (in which the constraints for API\nresponse bodies are mined from API specifications), with the dynamic approach\n(which relies on API execution data).

Our empirical results show that~LLMs with OC prompting\nachieve high precision in constraint mining with the average of 91.2%.

We derive tight upper\nbounds on the number of non-isomorphic generalized cospectral mates an oriented\ngraph can admit, based on arithmetic criteria involving the determinant of its\nskew-walk matrix. As a special case, we also provide a criterion for an\noriented graph to be weakly determined by its generalized skew spectrum\n(WDGSS), that is, its only generalized cospectral mate is its transpose. These\ncriteria relate directly to the controllability of graphs, a fundamental\nconcept in the control of networked systems, thereby connecting spectral\ncharacterization of graphs to graph controllability.",

    "abstract": "Ordering a minimal subset of lab tests for patients in the intensive care\nunit (ICU) can be challenging. Care teams must balance between ensuring the\navailability of the right information and reducing the clinical burden and\ncosts associated with each lab test order. Most in-patient settings experience\nfrequent over-ordering of lab tests, but are now aiming to reduce this burden\non both hospital resources and the environment. This paper develops a novel\nmethod that combines off-policy learning with privileged information to\nidentify the optimal set of ICU lab tests to order. Our approach, EXplainable\nOff-policy learning with Side Information for ICU blood Test Orders (ExOSITO)\ncreates an interpretable assistive tool for clinicians to order lab tests by\nconsidering both the observed and predicted future status of each patient. We\npose this problem as a causal bandit trained using offline data and a reward\nfunction derived from clinically-approved rules; we introduce a novel learning\nframework that integrates clinical knowledge with observational data to bridge\nthe gap between the optimal and logging policies. The learned policy function\nprovides interpretable clinical information and reduces costs without omitting\nany vital lab orders, outperforming both a physician's policy and prior\napproaches to this practical problem.",

Upon verifying the impact of heterophily on solving the\nstructural imbalance problem, we propose to rectify the heterophily first and\nthen transfer homophilic knowledge. To the end, we devise a method named HeRB\n(Heterophily-Resolved Structure Balancer) for GNNs. HeRB consists of two\ninnovative components: 1) A heterophily-lessening augmentation module which\nserves to reduce inter-class edges and increase intra-class edges; 2) A\nhomophilic knowledge transfer mechanism to convey homophilic information from\nhead nodes to tail nodes. Experimental results demonstrate that HeRB achieves\nsuperior performance on two homophilic and six heterophilic benchmark datasets,\nand the ablation studies further validate the efficacy of two proposed\ncomponents.",

Here, we show a thermally quenched metastable phase in\nthe Ising model without conservation of magnetization by Monte Carlo\nsimulations. When multiple types of interactions that stabilize different\nlong-range orders are introduced, the ordering kinetics divergently slow toward\nlow temperatures, meaning that the system will reach a low temperature without\nordering if the cooling rate is high enough.

These workloads include latency-sensitive requests focused on\nper-token latency in streaming chat, throughput-intensive requests that require\nrapid full responses to invoke tools, and collective requests with dynamic\ndependencies arising from self-reflection or agent-based reasoning. This\nworkload diversity, amplified by unpredictable request information such as\nresponse lengths and runtime dependencies, makes existing schedulers inadequate\neven within their design envelopes.\n  In this paper, we define service gain as the useful service delivered by\ncompleting requests. We observe that as SLO directly reflects the actual\nperformance needs of requests, completing a request much faster than its SLO\n(e.g., deadline) yields limited additional service gain. Based on this insight,\nwe introduce Tempo, the first systematic SLO-aware scheduler designed to\nmaximize service gain across diverse LLM workloads. Tempo allocates just enough\nserving bandwidth to meet each SLO, maximizing residual capacity for others\nbest-effort workloads. Instead of assuming request information or none at all,\nit adopts a hybrid scheduling strategy: using quantile-based response upper\nbounds and dependency-graph matching for conservative initial estimates,\nprioritizing requests by service gain density, and refining decisions online as\ngeneration progresses. Our evaluation across diverse workloads, including chat,\nreasoning, and agentic pipelines, shows that Tempo improves end-to-end service\ngain by up to 8.3$\\times$ and achieves up to 10.3$\\times$ SLO goodput compared\nto state-of-the-art designs",

    "abstract": "Quantization Aware Training (QAT) is a neural network quantization technique\nthat compresses model size and improves operational efficiency while\neffectively maintaining model performance. The paradigm of QAT is to introduce\nfake quantization operators during the training process, allowing the model to\nautonomously compensate for information loss caused by quantization. Making\nquantization parameters trainable can significantly improve the performance of\nQAT, but at the cost of compromising the flexibility during inference,\nespecially when dealing with activation values with substantially different\ndistributions. In this paper, we propose an effective learnable adaptive neural\nnetwork quantization method, called Adaptive Step Size Quantization (ASQ), to\nresolve this conflict. Specifically, the proposed ASQ method first dynamically\nadjusts quantization scaling factors through a trained module capable of\naccommodating different activations. Then, to address the rigid resolution\nissue inherent in Power of Two (POT) quantization, we propose an efficient\nnon-uniform quantization scheme. We utilize the Power Of Square root of Two\n(POST) as the basis for exponential quantization, effectively handling the\nbell-shaped distribution of neural network weights across various bit-widths\nwhile maintaining computational efficiency through a Look-Up Table method\n(LUT). Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed ASQ method\nis superior to the state-of-the-art QAT approaches. Notably that the ASQ is\neven competitive compared to full precision baselines, with its 4-bit quantized\nResNet34 model improving accuracy by 1.2\\% on ImageNet.",

The boundary value\nproblem is transformed into a system of coupled Cauchy-type singular integral\nequations, which are solved analytically using the Hilbert transform method.\nThis approach yields elegant closed-form solutions for both the stress\nintensity factor and the crack opening displacement. The study considers two\nmonoclinic crystalline materials, Lithium Niobate and Lithium Tantalate, and\ncompares their behavior with that of an isotropic material to assess the role\nof material anisotropy. Numerical simulations and graphical analysis are\nperformed for the crystalline materials with monoclinic symmetry to evaluate\nthe influence of crack velocity, punch loading, material anisotropy, initial\nstress, and crack geometry on the fracture parameters. As a special case, the\nsystem is analyzed under the action of point loading from the punch pressure,\nand a comparative assessment is conducted between point loading and constant\nnormal punch pressure.

Traditional color\nDoppler ultrasound can only measure the velocity component along the ultrasound\nbeam, which restricts its ability to accurately capture the complete blood flow\nvector in complex environments. To overcome these limitations, we propose an\nultrafast pulse-coded vector Doppler (PC-UVD) imaging method, utilizing\nHadamard matrix-based pulse encoding to improve velocity estimation accuracy\nunder low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions.

Velocity vectors are subsequently\nestimated using a weighted least squares (WLS) approach, with iterative\nresidual-based weight optimization improving robustness to noise and minimizing\nthe impact of outliers. The effectiveness of this technique is confirmed\nthrough simulations with a spiral blood flow phantom, demonstrating a marked\nimprovement in velocity estimation accuracy, particularly in deep imaging\nregions with significant signal attenuation.

    "abstract": "Despite significant interest and advancements in humanoid robotics, most\nexisting commercially available hardware remains high-cost, closed-source, and\nnon-transparent within the robotics community. This lack of accessibility and\ncustomization hinders the growth of the field and the broader development of\nhumanoid technologies. To address these challenges and promote democratization\nin humanoid robotics, we demonstrate Berkeley Humanoid Lite, an open-source\nhumanoid robot designed to be accessible, customizable, and beneficial for the\nentire community. The core of this design is a modular 3D-printed gearbox for\nthe actuators and robot body. All components can be sourced from widely\navailable e-commerce platforms and fabricated using standard desktop 3D\nprinters, keeping the total hardware cost under $5,000 (based on U.S. market\nprices). The design emphasizes modularity and ease of fabrication. To address\nthe inherent limitations of 3D-printed gearboxes, such as reduced strength and\ndurability compared to metal alternatives, we adopted a cycloidal gear design,\nwhich provides an optimal form factor in this context. Extensive testing was\nconducted on the 3D-printed actuators to validate their durability and\nalleviate concerns about the reliability of plastic components. To demonstrate\nthe capabilities of Berkeley Humanoid Lite, we conducted a series of\nexperiments, including the development of a locomotion controller using\nreinforcement learning. These experiments successfully showcased zero-shot\npolicy transfer from simulation to hardware, highlighting the platform's\nsuitability for research validation. By fully open-sourcing the hardware\ndesign, embedded code, and training and deployment frameworks, we aim for\nBerkeley Humanoid Lite to serve as a pivotal step toward democratizing the\ndevelopment of humanoid robotics.

    "abstract": "This study investigates the relationship between Carl Jung's cognitive\nfunctions and success in computer industry careers by analyzing the\ndistribution of Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) types among professionals in\nthe field. Building on Carl Jung's theory of psychological types, which\ncategorizes human cognition into four primary functions, Sensing, Intuition,\nThinking, and Feeling, this study investigates how these functions, when\ncombined with the attitudes of Extraversion and Introversion, influence\npersonality types and career choices in the tech sector. Through a\ncomprehensive analysis of data from 30 studies spanning multiple countries and\ndecades, encompassing 18,264 individuals in computer-related professions, we\nidentified the most prevalent cognitive functions and their combinations. After\nnormalizing the data against general population distributions, our findings\nshowed that individual Jungian functions (Te, Ni, Ti, Ne), dual function\ncombinations (Ni-Te, Ti-Ne, Si-Te, Ni-Fe), and MBTI types (INTJ, ENTJ, INTP,\nENTP, ISTJ, INFJ, ESTJ, ESTP) had significantly higher representation compared\nto general population norms. The paper addresses gaps in the existing\nliterature by providing a more nuanced understanding of how cognitive functions\nimpact job performance and team dynamics, offering insights for career\nguidance, team composition, and professional development in the computer\nindustry, and a deeper understanding of how cognitive preferences influence\ncareer success in technology-related fields.",

    "abstract": "The service rate region (SRR) has emerged as a critical performance metric\nfor distributed systems that store data redundantly. It measures the system's\nability to serve multiple users concurrently. Mathematically, the SRR is a\npolytope in R^k where each dimension corresponds to the service request rate of\none of the k data objects. This paper focuses on systems employing a class of\nMaximum Distance Separable (MDS) codes. For each code in the class, we\ncharacterize the k axes intercept points of its SRR, and the smallest standard\nsimplex that includes the SRR. We use these results to show that the SRR grows\nwith the increasing number of systematic columns in the generator matrices. We\nestablish a graph-theoretic framework associating this SRR problem with\nfractional matchings in quasi-uniform hypergraphs. Identifying the SRR polytope\nis equivalent to determining a particular image of the fractional-matching\npolytope. We introduce a notion of Greedy Matching and show that it is\nsufficient to focus on these matchings to characterize the SRR rather than the\nentire matching polytope. With these tools, we determine the SRR of a large\nsubset of the considered class of codes. Our results generalize previous\ncharacterizations of systematic and non-systematic MDS-coded systems, offering\na unified framework for analyzing service rate regions of codes.",

Our extensive experiments demonstrate that NeuralGrok significantly\naccelerates generalization, particularly in challenging arithmetic tasks. We\nalso show that NeuralGrok promotes a more stable training paradigm, constantly\nreducing the model's complexity, while traditional regularization methods, such\nas weight decay, can introduce substantial instability and impede\ngeneralization. We further investigate the intrinsic model complexity\nleveraging a novel Absolute Gradient Entropy (AGE) metric, which explains that\nNeuralGrok effectively facilitates generalization by reducing the model\ncomplexity.

Unlike previous video editing understanding benchmarks that\nfocus mainly on editing element classification, VEU-Bench encompasses 19\nfine-grained tasks across three stages: recognition, reasoning, and judging. To\nenhance the annotation of VEU automatically, we built an annotation pipeline\nintegrated with an ontology-based knowledge base.

It outperforms existing\nopen-source Vid-LLMs on VEU-Bench by over 28.3% in accuracy and achieves\nperformance comparable to commercial models like GPT-4o.

While existing polymer\nnetwork models connect chain properties to emergent network behavior, they are\noften limited to monodisperse networks with regular connectivities, making the\nextension to heterogeneous systems an active area of research. In this work, we\nintroduce a novel modeling framework that shifts the focus from individual\npolymer chains to cross-links and their connected chains as the fundamental\nunit of analysis. This perspective enables direct incorporation of structural\nheterogeneity by averaging over cross-links with different chain lengths and\ncoordination numbers. We establish important connections between polymerization\ntheory and statistical descriptors of network structure, providing key\ncomponents of a theoretical foundation for predicting properties from the\nsynthesis parameters. Our results demonstrate that increased variance in\nmonomer numbers generally leads to network softening, while in bimodal\nnetworks, the onset of strain stiffening is controlled by shorter chains and\nthe stiffening response is modulated by the ratio of short to long chains. By\nderiving closed-form approximations valid in both the limits of (1) small\ndeformation and (2) finite deformation but with small polydispersity, we offer\nan efficient computational approach to modeling complex networks.

    "abstract": "The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence and widespread use of\nsmartphones have resulted in an exponential growth of image data, both real\n(camera-captured) and virtual (AI-generated). This surge underscores the\ncritical need for robust image quality assessment (IQA) methods that accurately\nreflect human visual perception. Traditional IQA techniques primarily rely on\nspatial features - such as signal-to-noise ratio, local structural distortions,\nand texture inconsistencies - to identify artifacts. While effective for\nunprocessed or conventionally altered images, these methods fall short in the\ncontext of modern image post-processing powered by deep neural networks (DNNs).\nThe rise of DNN-based models for image generation, enhancement, and restoration\nhas significantly improved visual quality, yet made accurate assessment\nincreasingly complex. To address this, we propose a novel IQA approach that\nbridges the gap between deep learning methods and human perception. Our model\ndisentangles deep features into high-level semantic information and low-level\nperceptual details, treating each stream separately. These features are then\ncombined with conventional IQA metrics to provide a more comprehensive\nevaluation framework. This hybrid design enables the model to assess both\nglobal context and intricate image details, better reflecting the human visual\nprocess, which first interprets overall structure before attending to\nfine-grained elements. The final stage employs a multilayer perceptron (MLP) to\nmap the integrated features into a concise quality score. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that our method achieves improved consistency with human perceptual\njudgments compared to existing IQA models.",

The effectiveness of\nthis means, albeit demonstrated in architype (incipient) ferroelectric systems\nsuch as SrTiO3, hinges on a spectral overlapping between their soft phonon\nmodes within the excitation bandwidth of THz pulses. Generally this can only\ninduce an appreciable coupling close to the phase transition temperatures,\nwhere the lattice phonons substantially soften. Because of their emergent\nsubterahertz collective dynamics, a fundamentally distinct and effective THz\ncoupling mechanism can be envisaged in topological polar structures recently\ndiscovered in PbTiO3/SrTiO3 superlattices.

Such an ultrafast THz-driven phase transition is\nfound to sustain across a broad temperature range of 4-470 K, in accordance\nwith the equilibrium stability field of the skyrmions.

To avoid missing\nnecessary properties, we develop a grammar-based approach to generate\ncomprehensive template sets that capture critical signal behaviors for various\ncommunication protocols.

A formal approach is first\nimplemented to check the candidate properties and filter out those inconsistent\nwith the timing diagrams.

    "abstract": "LLMs are increasingly explored for bundle generation, thanks to their\nreasoning capabilities and knowledge. However, deploying large-scale LLMs\nintroduces significant efficiency challenges, primarily high computational\ncosts during fine-tuning and inference due to their massive parameterization.\nKnowledge distillation (KD) offers a promising solution, transferring expertise\nfrom large teacher models to compact student models. This study systematically\ninvestigates knowledge distillation approaches for bundle generation, aiming to\nminimize computational demands while preserving performance. We explore three\ncritical research questions: (1) how does the format of KD impact bundle\ngeneration performance? (2) to what extent does the quantity of distilled\nknowledge influence performance? and (3) how do different ways of utilizing the\ndistilled knowledge affect performance? We propose a comprehensive KD framework\nthat (i) progressively extracts knowledge (patterns, rules, deep thoughts);\n(ii) captures varying quantities of distilled knowledge through different\nstrategies; and (iii) exploits complementary LLM adaptation techniques\n(in-context learning, supervised fine-tuning, combination) to leverage\ndistilled knowledge in small student models for domain-specific adaptation and\nenhanced efficiency.

Although adversarial\ntraining has been an established technique for enhancing robustness in\npredictive models, it has been overlooked for generative models due to concerns\nabout potential fidelity degradation by the nature of trade-offs between\nperformance and robustness. In this work, we challenge this presumption,\nintroducing Smooth Robust Latent VAE (SRL-VAE), a novel adversarial training\nframework that boosts both generation quality and robustness. In contrast to\nconventional adversarial training, which focuses on robustness only, our\napproach smooths the latent space via adversarial perturbations, promoting more\ngeneralizable representations while regularizing with originality\nrepresentation to sustain original fidelity. Applied as a post-training step on\npre-trained VAEs, SRL-VAE improves image robustness and fidelity with minimal\ncomputational overhead. Experiments show that SRL-VAE improves both generation\nquality, in image reconstruction and text-guided image editing, and robustness,\nagainst Nightshade attacks and image editing attacks. These results establish a\nnew paradigm, showing that adversarial training, once thought to be detrimental\nto generative models, can instead enhance both fidelity and robustness.",

    "abstract": "Learning grinding skills from human craftsmen via imitation learning has\nbecome a key research topic in robotic machining. Due to their strong\ngeneralization and robustness to external disturbances, Dynamical Movement\nPrimitives (DMPs) offer a promising approach for robotic grinding skill\nlearning. However, directly applying DMPs to grinding tasks faces challenges,\nsuch as low orientation accuracy, unsynchronized position-orientation-force,\nand limited generalization for surface trajectories. To address these issues,\nthis paper proposes a robotic grinding skill learning method based on geodesic\nlength DMPs (Geo-DMPs). First, a normalized 2D weighted Gaussian kernel and\nintrinsic mean clustering algorithm are developed to extract geometric features\nfrom multiple demonstrations. Then, an orientation manifold distance metric\nremoves the time dependency in traditional orientation DMPs, enabling accurate\norientation learning via Geo-DMPs. A synchronization encoding framework is\nfurther proposed to jointly model position, orientation, and force using a\ngeodesic length-based phase function. This framework enables robotic grinding\nactions to be generated between any two surface points. Experiments on robotic\nchamfer grinding and free-form surface grinding validate that the proposed\nmethod achieves high geometric accuracy and generalization in skill encoding\nand generation. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to use DMPs for\njointly learning and generating grinding skills in position, orientation, and\nforce on model-free surfaces, offering a novel path for robotic grinding.",

Our experiments on synthetic and real-image\nbenchmarks, compared with various VLMs, demonstrate significant improvements in\nperspective-aware reasoning with our framework, further outperforming\nfine-tuned spatial reasoning models and novel-view-synthesis-based approaches.",

In this paper, we introduce DPIR\n(Dual Prompting Image Restoration), a novel image restoration method that\neffectivly extracts conditional information of low-quality images from multiple\nperspectives. Specifically, DPIR consits of two branches: a low-quality image\nconditioning branch and a dual prompting control branch. The first branch\nutilizes a lightweight module to incorporate image priors into the DiT with\nhigh efficiency. More importantly, we believe that in image restoration,\ntextual description alone cannot fully capture its rich visual characteristics.\nTherefore, a dual prompting module is designed to provide DiT with additional\nvisual cues, capturing both global context and local appearance. The extracted\nglobal-local visual prompts as extra conditional control, alongside textual\nprompts to form dual prompts, greatly enhance the quality of the restoration.\nExtensive experimental results demonstrate that DPIR delivers superior image\nrestoration performance.",

This global\nhyperuniformity can be enhanced or weakened by changes in the driving torques\nor the particle density in various ways. The corresponding microscopic\nmechanism is attributed to the competition between a dynamical\nheterocoordination effect and effective like-particle attractions. Critical\nscaling for the absorbing state transition of the system is also found to\npersist, with a significant shift in its critical point observed. The system\ncan be further thermalized, by the driving torques or through thermostating,\ninto an ideal solution with identical partial radial distribution functions,\nwhich denys the possibility of being multi-hyperuniform. A simply-extented\ncoupled density-oscillator theory explains why the system can not be\nmulti-hyperuniform, but can have a global hyperuniformity with the scaling\nexponent $\\alpha$ approaching $2$.

    "abstract": "In intelligent transportation systems (ITS), traffic management departments\nrely on sensors, cameras, and GPS devices to collect real-time traffic data.\nTraffic speed data is often incomplete due to sensor failures, data\ntransmission delays, or occlusions, resulting in missing speed data in certain\nroad segments. Currently, tensor decomposition based methods are extensively\nutilized, they mostly rely on the $L_2$-norm to construct their learning\nobjectives, which leads to reduced robustness in the algorithms. To address\nthis, we propose Temporal-Aware Traffic Speed Imputation (TATSI), which\ncombines the $L_2$-norm and smooth $L_1$ (${SL}_1$)-norm in its loss function,\nthereby achieving both high accuracy and robust performance in imputing missing\ntime-varying traffic speed data. TATSI adopts a single latent factor-dependent,\nnonnegative, and multiplicative update (SLF-NMU) approach, which serves as an\nefficient solver for performing nonnegative latent factor analysis (LFA) on a\ntensor. Empirical studies on three real-world time-varying traffic speed\ndatasets demonstrate that, compared with state-of-the-art traffic speed\npredictors, TATSI more precisely captures temporal patterns, thereby yielding\nthe most accurate imputations for missing traffic speed data.",

    "abstract": "An important goal of environmental health research is to assess the health\nrisks posed by mixtures of multiple environmental exposures. In these mixtures\nanalyses, flexible models like Bayesian kernel machine regression and multiple\nindex models are appealing because they allow for arbitrary non-linear\nexposure-outcome relationships. However, this flexibility comes at the cost of\nlow power, particularly when exposures are highly correlated and the health\neffects are weak, as is typical in environmental health studies. We propose an\nadaptive index modelling strategy that borrows strength across exposures and\noutcomes by exploiting similar mixture component weights and exposure-response\nrelationships. In the special case of distributed lag models, in which\nexposures are measured repeatedly over time, we jointly encourage co-clustering\nof lag profiles and exposure-response curves to more efficiently identify\ncritical windows of vulnerability and characterize important exposure effects.\nWe then extend the proposed approach to the multivariate index model setting\nwhere the true index structure -- the number of indices and their composition\n-- is unknown, and introduce variable importance measures to quantify component\ncontributions to mixture effects. Using time series data from the National\nMorbidity, Mortality and Air Pollution Study, we demonstrate the proposed\nmethods by jointly modelling three mortality outcomes and two cumulative air\npollution measurements with a maximum lag of 14 days.",

Moreover, each\nphase is instantiated through a set of specialized agents designed to\ncollaborate effectively across the pipeline. We then evaluate PaperCoder on\ngenerating code implementations from machine learning papers based on both\nmodel-based and human evaluations, particularly from the authors of those\npapers, with author-released repositories as ground truth if available.

Bremsstrahlung radiation power loss is\none of the most significant losses in fusion plasmas, which is more pronounced\nin higher temperature fusion. The factors that affect bremsstrahlung power\ninclude the mean electron energy and the electron velocity distribution shape.\nIn this study, we systematically study the influence of the electron velocity\ndistribution shape on the bremsstrahlung power with fixed total electron\nenergy. It was found that the existing electron velocity distribution shapes\nhave little effect on the bremsstrahlung power. In addition, by analyzing the\nbounds of bremsstrahlung power, we have provided the theoretical upper and\nlower bounds of e-i radiation. Our analysis reveals that the e-i bremsstrahlung\npower depends critically on the degree of energy distribution concentration.\nSpecifically, in non-relativistic regimes, concentrated energy distributions\nenhance the radiation power, whereas in high-temperature relativistic regimes,\nsuch concentration suppresses it. This discrepancy arises from the distinct\ncontributions of high-energy electron populations to radiation power across\ndifferent energy regimes. For e-e bremsstrahlung, a similar dependence on\nenergy concentration is observed. Furthermore, e-e radiation power exhibits\nadditional sensitivity to the anisotropy of the electron velocity distribution\nfunction.

These Fermi arcs remain well-separated by bulk\nstates, thereby facilitating future experimental observations. In contrast, the\nchiral separation of Weyl points in LaGaGe is relatively modest. Upon\napplication of volume compression, the $f$ electrons in CeGaGe progressively\nbecome itinerant and begin to obscure the Weyl nodes formed by $spd$ electrons,\nrendering them less accessible for direct observation. These findings suggest\nthat in correlated materials, particularly $f$-electron systems, even when $f$\nelectrons do not directly contribute to the formation of topological nodes,\nthey can still exert a profound influence on the characteristics of Weyl nodes.",

To bridge this gap, we explore the deployment of a\nlarge-scale CSI-based localization system involving over 400 Access Points\n(APs) in a real-world building under the Integrated Sensing and Communication\n(ISAC) paradigm. We highlight two critical yet often overlooked factors: the\nunderutilization of unlabeled data and the inherent heterogeneity of CSI\nmeasurements. To address these challenges, we propose a novel CSI-based\nlearning framework for WiFi localization, tailored for large-scale ISAC\ndeployments on the server side. Specifically, we employ a novel graph-based\nstructure to model heterogeneous CSI data and reduce redundancy. We further\ndesign a pretext pretraining task that incorporates spatial and temporal priors\nto effectively leverage large-scale unlabeled CSI data. Complementarily, we\nintroduce a confidence-aware fine-tuning strategy to enhance the robustness of\nlocalization results. In a leave-one-smartphone-out experiment spanning five\nfloors and 25, 600 m2, we achieve a median localization error of 2.17 meters\nand a floor accuracy of 99.49%.

    "abstract": "Unresolved questions about how autonomous vehicles (AVs) should meet the\ninformational needs of riders hinder real-world adoption. Complicating our\nability to satisfy rider needs is that different people, goals, and driving\ncontexts have different criteria for what constitutes interaction success.\nUnfortunately, most human-AV research and design today treats all people and\nsituations uniformly. It is crucial to understand how an AV should communicate\nto meet rider needs, and how communications should change when the human-AV\ncomplex system changes. I argue that understanding the relationships between\ndifferent aspects of the human-AV system can help us build improved and\nadaptable AV communications. I support this argument using three empirical\nstudies. First, I identify optimal communication strategies that enhance\ndriving performance, confidence, and trust for learning in extreme driving\nenvironments. Findings highlight the need for task-sensitive,\nmodality-appropriate communications tuned to learner cognitive limits and\ngoals. Next, I highlight the consequences of deploying faulty communication\nsystems and demonstrate the need for context-sensitive communications. Third, I\nuse machine learning (ML) to illuminate personal factors predicting trust in\nAVs, emphasizing the importance of tailoring designs to individual traits and\nconcerns. Together, this dissertation supports the necessity of transparent,\nadaptable, and personalized AV systems that cater to individual needs, goals,\nand contextual demands. By considering the complex system within which human-AV\ninteractions occur, we can deliver valuable insights for designers,\nresearchers, and policymakers. This dissertation also provides a concrete\ndomain to study theories of human-machine joint action and situational\nawareness, and can be used to guide future human-AI interaction research.\n[shortened for arxiv]",

This addresses the singularities that arise at the crack tip\nin computations with sharp interface models, mollifying some of the\ndifficulties associated with the mathematical and numerical treatment of\nfracture. The introduction of the diffuse field helps with crack propagation\ndynamics, enabling phase-field approaches to model all phases of damage from\ncrack initiation to propagation, branching, and merging. Specific formulations,\nbeginning with brittle fracture, have also been shown to converge to classical\nsolutions. Extensions to cover the range of material failure, including ductile\nand cohesive fracture, leads to an array of possible models. There exists a\nlarge body of studies of these models and their consequences for crack\nevolution. However, there have not been systematic studies into how optimal\nmodels may be chosen.

We\nconsider some of the main models that have been used to model damage, its\ndegradation of elastic response, and its propagation.

After pre-training, cross-resolution and cross-modal features are\nhierarchically fused and fine-tuned to enhance emotion recognition.

Understanding RNA localization sheds light on processes\nlike gene expression regulation with spatial and temporal precision. However,\ntraditional wet lab methods for determining RNA localization, such as in situ\nhybridization, are often time-consuming, resource-demanding, and costly.

These issues significantly hinder the implementation of MF-TBD in\nautomotive radars. To address these challenges, a new MF-TBD detection\narchitecture is first proposed. It can adaptively adjust the detection\nthreshold value based on the existence of moving targets within the radar FOV.\nSince the implementation of MF-TBD necessitates the inclusion of position,\nvelocity, and yaw angle information of the ego-vehicle, each with varying\ndegrees of measurement error, we further propose a multi-frame energy\nintegration strategy for moving-platform radar and accurately derive the target\nenergy integration path functions. The self-positioning errors of the\nego-vehicle, which are usually not considered in some previous target tracking\napproaches, are well addressed. Numerical simulations and experimental results\nwith real radar data demonstrate large detection and tracking gains over\nstandard automotive radar processing in weak target environments.",

    "abstract": "Stochastic Optimal Control (SOC) problems arise in systems influenced by\nuncertainty, such as autonomous robots or financial models. Traditional methods\nlike dynamic programming are often intractable for high-dimensional, nonlinear\nsystems due to the curse of dimensionality. This dissertation explores the path\nintegral control framework as a scalable, sampling-based alternative. By\nreformulating SOC problems as expectations over stochastic trajectories, it\nenables efficient policy synthesis via Monte Carlo sampling and supports\nreal-time implementation through GPU parallelization.\n  We apply this framework to six classes of SOC problems: Chance-Constrained\nSOC, Stochastic Differential Games, Deceptive Control, Task Hierarchical\nControl, Risk Mitigation of Stealthy Attacks, and Discrete-Time LQR. A sample\ncomplexity analysis for the discrete-time case is also provided. These\ncontributions establish a foundation for simulator-driven autonomy in complex,\nuncertain environments.",

We show that the Gaussian ansatz allows us, via the\ngravitational Ward identities acting as a constraint between the variance and\nthe average, to maintain full general covariance, with hydrodynamic flow\nemerging as an approximate Killing vector. If the symmetry of relativistic\nhydrodynamics, volume-preserving diffeomorphisms, is preserved, we show that\nlinear response formulae are also generally covariant. We discuss our results\nand argue that in this approach, the applicability of the effective theory is\nparametrized around a very different quantity than the Knudsen number, offering\nhope of understanding the applicability of hydrodynamics to small systems.",

Using the decision maker's preferences over acts before and\nafter the arrival of new information as the primitive of the analysis, I\naxiomatically characterize a representation where the decision maker's\nprobability assessment can be described by a benchmark prior, which is\nreflected in her ex ante ranking of acts, and a set of plausible priors, which\nis revealed from her updated preferences. When new information is received, the\ndecision maker revises her benchmark prior within the set of plausible priors\nvia the maximum likelihood principle in a way that ensures maximally\ndynamically consistent behavior, and updates the new prior using Bayes' rule.\nRML updating accommodates most commonly observed biases in probabilistic\nreasoning.",
