    "abstract": "Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) integrates large language models ( LLM\ns) with retrievers to access external knowledge, improving the factuality of\nLLM generation in knowledge-grounded tasks. To optimize the RAG performance,\nmost previous work independently fine-tunes the retriever to adapt to frozen\nLLM s or trains the LLMs to use documents retrieved by off-the-shelf\nretrievers, lacking end-to-end training supervision. Recent work addresses this\nlimitation by jointly training these two components but relies on overly\nsimplifying assumptions of document independence, which has been criticized for\nbeing far from real-world scenarios. Thus, effectively optimizing the overall\nRAG performance remains a critical challenge.\n  We propose a direct retrieval-augmented optimization framework, named DRO,\nthat enables end-to-end training of two key components: (i) a generative\nknowledge selection model and (ii) an LLM generator. DRO alternates between two\nphases: (i) document permutation estimation and (ii) re-weighted maximization,\nprogressively improving RAG components through a variational approach. In the\nestimation step, we treat document permutation as a latent variable and\ndirectly estimate its distribution from the selection model by applying an\nimportance sampling strategy. In the maximization step, we calibrate the\noptimization expectation using importance weights and jointly train the\nselection model and LLM generator. Our theoretical analysis reveals that DRO is\nanalogous to policy-gradient methods in reinforcement learning. Extensive\nexperiments conducted on five datasets illustrate that DRO outperforms the best\nbaseline with 5%-15% improvements in EM and F1. We also provide in-depth\nexperiments to qualitatively analyze the stability, convergence, and variance\nof DRO.",

    "abstract": "We develop and analyze layer potential methods to represent harmonic\nfunctions on finitely-connected tori (i.e., doubly-periodic harmonic\nfunctions). The layer potentials are expressed in terms of a doubly-periodic\nand non-harmonic Green's function that can be explicitly written in terms of\nthe Jacobi theta function or a modified Weierstrass sigma function. Extending\nresults for finitely-connected Euclidean domains, we prove that the single- and\ndouble-layer potential operators are compact linear operators and derive\nrelevant limiting properties at the boundary. We show that when the boundary\nhas more than one connected component, the Fredholm operator of the second kind\nassociated with the double-layer potential operator has a non-trivial null\nspace, which can be explicitly constructed. Finally, we apply our developed\ntheory to obtain solutions to the Dirichlet and Neumann boundary value\nproblems, as well as the Steklov eigenvalue problem. We implement the developed\nmethods using Nystr\\\"om discretization and find approximate solutions for these\nproblems in several numerical examples. Our method avoids a lattice sum of the\nfree space Green's function, is shown to be spectrally convergent, and has a\nfaster convergence rate than the method of particular solutions for problems on\ntori with irregularly shaped holes.",

    "abstract": "Biofeedback is being used more recently as a general control paradigm for\nhuman-computer interfaces (HCIs). While biofeedback especially from breath has\nseen increasing uptake as a controller for novel musical interfaces, new\ninterfaces for musical expression (NIMEs), the community has not given as much\nattention to the heart. The heart is just as intimate a part of music as breath\nand it is argued that the heart determines our perception of time and so\nindirectly our perception of music. Inspired by this I demonstrate a\nphotoplethysmogram (PPG)-based NIME controller using heart rate as a 1D control\nparameter to transform the qualities of sounds in real-time over a Bluetooth\nwireless HCI. I apply time scaling to \"warp\" audio buffers inbound to the sound\ncard, and play these transformed audio buffers back to the listener wearing the\nPPG sensor, creating a hypothetical perceptual biofeedback loop: changes in\nsound change heart rate to change PPG measurements to change sound. I discuss\nhow a sound-heart-PPG biofeedback loop possibly affords greater control and/or\nvariety of movements with a 1D controller, how controlling the space and/or\ntime scale of sound playback with biofeedback makes for possibilities in\nperformance ambience, and I briefly discuss generative latent spaces as a\npossible way to extend a 1D PPG control space.",

In particular, we consider a\nnonlinear state space model to be robustly invertible if an inverse exists with\na state space realisation, and both the forward model and its inverse are\ncontracting, i.e. incrementally exponentially stable, and Lipschitz, i.e. have\nbounded incremental gain. This property of bi-Lipschitzness implies both\nrobustness in the sense of sensitivity to input perturbations, as well as\nrobust distinguishability of different inputs from their corresponding outputs,\ni.e. the inverse model robustly reconstructs the input sequence despite small\nperturbations to the initial conditions and measured output. Building on this\nfoundation, we propose a parameterization of neural dynamic models:\nbi-Lipschitz recurrent equilibrium networks (biLipREN), which are robustly\ninvertible by construction. Moreover, biLipRENs can be composed with orthogonal\nlinear systems to construct more general bi-Lipschitz dynamic models, e.g., a\nnonlinear analogue of minimum-phase/all-pass (inner/outer) factorization.

DiTSNe-Ia yields a mean squared error of 0.108 across all phases-five\ntimes lower than SALT3's 0.508-and an after-peak error of just 0.0191, an order\nof magnitude smaller than SALT3's 0.305. Additionally, our model produces\nwell-calibrated credible intervals with near-nominal coverage, particularly at\npost-peak phases. DiTSNe-Ia is a powerful tool for rapidly inferring the\nspectral properties of SNe Ia and other transient astrophysical phenomena for\nwhich a physical description does not yet exist.",

These conditions\ncorrespond to the mixed-multipoint tangential interpolation of the full-order\nlinear- and quadratic-output transfer functions, and generalize the\nMeier-Luenberger optimality framework for the $\\mathcal{H}_2$-optimal model\nreduction of linear time-invariant systems. Second, given the interpolation\ndata, we show how to enforce these mixed-multipoint tangential interpolation\nconditions explicitly by Petrov-Galerkin projection of the full-order model\nmatrices. Third, to find the optimal interpolation data, we build on this\nprojection framework and propose a generalization of the iterative rational\nKrylov algorithm for the $\\mathcal{H}_2$-optimal model reduction of linear\nquadratic-output systems, called LQO-IRKA. Upon convergence, LQO-IRKA produces\na reduced linear quadratic-output system that satisfies the interpolatory\noptimality conditions.

In this paper, we introduce Selective Loss to Understand but Not\nGenerate (SLUNG), a pre-training paradigm through which models learn to\nunderstand high-risk data without learning to generate it. Instead of uniformly\napplying the next-token prediction loss, SLUNG selectively avoids incentivizing\nthe generation of high-risk tokens while ensuring they remain within the\nmodel's context window. As the model learns to predict low-risk tokens that\nfollow high-risk ones, it is forced to understand the high-risk content.\nThrough our experiments, we show that SLUNG consistently improves models'\nunderstanding of high-risk data (e.g., ability to recognize toxic content)\nwithout increasing its generation (e.g., toxicity of model responses).

For lattices in higher spatial dimensions, we discover dynamical\neffects arising from the \"destructive interference\" of many connected neurons\nand miniature \"phase transitions\" from coordinated spiking threshold crossings.\nIn large two- and three-dimensional neuron lattices, we observe emergent\ndynamics such as local synchronization, quasi-synchronization, and lag\nsynchronization. These results illustrate the rich dynamics that emerge from\ncoupled neurons in multiple spatial dimensions, highlighting how\ndimensionality, connectivity, and heterogeneity critically shape the collective\nbehavior of neuronal systems.",

However, it is unclear how and why such a\nhash grid structure improves the capabilities of a neural network by such great\nmargins. A lack of principled understanding of the hash grid also implies that\nthe large set of hyperparameters accompanying Instant-NGP could only be tuned\nempirically without much heuristics. To provide an intuitive explanation of the\nworking principle of the hash grid, we propose a novel perspective, namely\ndomain manipulation. This perspective provides a ground-up explanation of how\nthe feature grid learns the target signal and increases the expressivity of the\nneural field by artificially creating multiples of pre-existing linear\nsegments. We conducted numerous experiments on carefully constructed\n1-dimensional signals to support our claims empirically and aid our\nillustrations.

This paper presents a thorough review of existing and\nemerging MIoT technologies designed to address these challenges, including\nLow-Power Wide-Area Networks (LPWAN), 5G/6G capabilities, edge and fog\ncomputing architectures, and hybrid access methodologies.

Through extensive comparative analysis, this study\nidentifies critical innovations and architectural adaptations required to\nsupport efficient, resilient, and scalable MIoT deployments. Key insights\ninclude the role of network slicing and intelligent resource management for\nscalability, adaptive protocols for real-time data handling, and lightweight AI\nmodels suited to the constraints of MIoT devices.

In particular, we consider the SAR model with\nGeneralized Extreme Value distribution innovations to combine the observation\nat a central grid location with its neighbors, capturing extreme spatial\nbehavior based on the heavy-tailed innovations.

For the SDO/AIA case, the\n1600\\r{A} channel is the most relevant one when used in combination with\n171\\r{A} and 304\\r{A}. The combination of the four different SDO/AIA passbands\nis not informative enough to accurately classify EBs. From our analysis of a\nfew sample SDO/AIA 1600\\r{A} and 1700\\r{A} light curves, we conclude that\ninclusion of the temporal variation may be a significant step towards\nestablishing an effective EB detection method that can be applied to the\nextensive SDO/AIA database of observations.

Topological Data Analysis Ball Mapper\n(TDABM) after Dlotko (2019), provides a model free means to visualize\nmultivariate datasets without information loss. To permit the construction of a\nTDABM graph, each variable must be ordinal and have sufficiently many values to\nmake a scatterplot of interest. Where a scatterplot works with two, or three,\naxes, the TDABM graph can handle any number of axes simultaneously. The result\nis a visualization of the structure of data. The TDABM graph also permits\ncoloration by additional variables, enabling the mapping of outcomes across the\njoint distribution of axes. The strengths of TDABM for understanding data, and\nevaluating models, lie behind a rapidly expanding literature. This guide\nprovides an introduction to TDABM with code in Python.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce a data-driven machine learning approach for\nmodeling one-dimensional stress-strain behavior under cyclic loading, utilizing\nexperimental data from the nickel-based Alloy 617. The study employs uniaxial\ncreep-fatigue test data acquired under various loading histories and compares\ntwo distinct neural network-based ODE models. The first model, known as the\nblack-box model, comprehensively describes the strain-stress relationship using\na Neural ODE equation. To interpret this black-box model, we apply the Sparse\nIdentification of Nonlinear Dynamical Systems (SINDy) technique, transforming\nthe black-box model into an equation-based model using symbolic regression. The\nsecond model, the Neural flow rule model, incorporates Hooke's Law for the\nlinear elastic component, with the nonlinear part characterized by a Neural\nODE. Both models are trained with experimental data to accurately reflect the\nobserved stress-strain behavior. We conduct a detailed comparison with the\nstandard Chaboche model, which includes three back stresses. Our results\ndemonstrate that the neural network-based ODE models precisely capture the\nexperimental creep-fatigue mechanical behavior, exceeding the standard Chaboche\nmodel's accuracy. Furthermore, an interpretable model derived from the\nblack-box neural ODE model through symbolic regression achieves accuracy\ncomparable to the Chaboche model, enhancing its interpretability. The results\nhighlight the potential of neural network-based ODE models to depict complex\ncreep-fatigue behavior, eliminating the necessity for experts to define a\nspecific, material-focused model form.",

However, while performance gains remain the gold\nstandard for evaluating multimodal systems, concerns around bias and robustness\nare frequently overlooked. In this context, this paper explores two key\nresearch questions (RQs): (i) RQ1 examines whether adding a modality\ncon-sistently enhances performance and investigates its role in shaping\nfairness measures, assessing whether it mitigates or amplifies bias in\nmultimodal models; (ii) RQ2 investigates the impact of missing modalities at\ninference time, analyzing how multimodal models generalize in terms of both\nperformance and fairness. Our analysis reveals that incorporating new\nmodalities during training consistently enhances the performance of multimodal\nmodels, while fairness trends exhibit variability across different evaluation\nmeasures and datasets. Additionally, the absence of modalities at inference\ndegrades performance and fairness, raising concerns about its robustness in\nreal-world deployment.

It acquires both a low-energy image, comparable to\nstandard mammography, and a high-energy image, which are then combined to\nproduce a dual-energy subtracted image highlighting lesion contrast\nenhancement. While CESM offers superior diagnostic accuracy compared to\nstandard mammography, its use entails higher radiation exposure and potential\nside effects associated with the contrast medium. To address these limitations,\nwe propose Seg-CycleGAN, a generative deep learning framework for Virtual\nContrast Enhancement in CESM. The model synthesizes high-fidelity dual-energy\nsubtracted images from low-energy images, leveraging lesion segmentation maps\nto guide the generative process and improve lesion reconstruction. Building\nupon the standard CycleGAN architecture, Seg-CycleGAN introduces localized loss\nterms focused on lesion areas, enhancing the synthesis of diagnostically\nrelevant regions. Experiments on the CESM@UCBM dataset demonstrate that\nSeg-CycleGAN outperforms the baseline in terms of PSNR and SSIM, while\nmaintaining competitive MSE and VIF.

Although promising, the association between the\ncomputation cost and the number of identities in the dataset remains linear\nonly with a reduced ratio. A shared characteristic among available FR methods\nis the employment of atomic scalar labels during training. Consequently, the\ninput to label matching is through a dot product between the feature vector of\nthe input and the Softmax centroids. Inspired by generative modeling, we\npresent a simple yet effective method that substitutes scalar labels with\nstructured identity code, i.e., a sequence of integers. Specifically, we\npropose a tokenization scheme that transforms atomic scalar labels into\nstructured identity codes. Then, we train an FR backbone to predict the code\nfor each input instead of its scalar label. As a result, the associated\ncomputational cost becomes logarithmic w.r.t. number of identities.

On cooling from the isotropic fluid, they directly\ntransition to a ferroelectric nematic liquid crystal (NF) phase that shows the\nstrongest spatial correlations corresponding to 1/3 of the molecular length\n(L/3). The set of thiophene compounds reported here have ferroelectric\npolarizations about 20% larger than that of usual ferroelectric nematic liquid\ncrystal materials. Such large polarization values are due to the ~20% larger\nmass densities of these thiophene compounds compared to most of the NF\nmaterials with short terminal chains. These unusual properties are consequences\nof tighter molecular packing due to the lack of flexible terminal chains. Below\nthe NF phase, compounds with a single nitro or two cyano polar groups on the\nterminal benzene ring exhibit a so far never observed smectic phase with\nperiodicity ~1/3 the molecular length. Based on our experimental results, we\npropose a model of this phase featuring antipolar packing of the molecules\nwithin the layers.",

We use a moving molasses technique to enable this configuration and\nshow that its performance depends critically on metastable-state shelving (to\n5s5p 3P2) during the atom transfer to the 3D MOT.

These observations are\nverified to great degree of accuracy using both our developed analytical and\nnumerical models.

The joint\ndata set yields a spectral index of primordial scalar perturbations $n_s =\n0.9743 \\pm 0.0034$ and an upper bound on the tensor-to-scalar ratio of $r <\n0.038$. This slight upward shift in $n_s$ puts the previously favored\nStarobinsky model, and the conventional metric Higgs(-like) inflation--based on\na quartic potential with a large non-minimal coupling in the Jordan\nframe--under tension with observations. In metric Higgs-like inflation the\nattractor behavior makes the predictions remarkably stable against higher-order\noperators, so modifying $n_s$ through such terms is difficult. In this paper, I\nshow that adding a quadratic mass term to the Jordan-frame potential can raise\n$n_s$ and restore compatibility with the new data.

    "abstract": "Bloom filters are used in query processing to perform early data reduction\nand improve query performance. The optimal query plan may be different when\nBloom filters are used, indicating the need for Bloom filter-aware query\noptimization. To date, Bloom filter-aware query optimization has only been\nincorporated in a top-down query optimizer and limited to snowflake queries. In\nthis paper, we show how Bloom filters can be incorporated in a bottom-up\ncost-based query optimizer. We highlight the challenges in limiting optimizer\nsearch space expansion, and offer an efficient solution. We show that including\nBloom filters in cost-based optimization can lead to better join orders with\neffective predicate transfer between operators. On a 100 GB instance of the\nTPC-H database, our approach achieved a 32.8% further reduction in latency for\nqueries involving Bloom filters, compared to the traditional approach of adding\nBloom filters in a separate post-optimization step. Our method applies to all\nquery types, and we provide several heuristics to balance limited increases in\noptimization time against improved query latency.",

    "abstract": "We study the spectroscopic appearance of very massive stars and their effect\non the integrated light of starbursts at low metallicity (Z). We adopt two\nframeworks for the mass loss rates of VMS: in one case we assume no Z\ndependence, in the other case we assume a linear scaling with Z. We compute\nevolutionary models for masses 150, 200, 250 and 300 Msun at Z=0.2, 0.1 and\n0.01 Zsun. We compute the associated synthetic spectra at selected points along\nthe evolutionary tracks. Finally we build population synthesis models including\nVMS. We find that the evolution of VMS critically depends on the assumptions\nregarding mass loss rates. In case of no Z dependence VMS remain hot for all\ntheir lifetime. Conversely when mass loss rates are reduced because of lower Z\nVMS follow a classical evolution towards the red part of the HR diagram. VMS\ndisplay HeII 1640 emission in most phases of their evolution, except when they\nbecome too cool. This line is present in the integrated light of population\nsynthesis models down to 0.1 Zsun whatever the star formation history, and is\nalso sometimes seen at Z=0.01 Zsun. HeII 1640 is weaker in models that include\na Z scaling of the mass loss rates. The optical spectra of starbursts,\nespecially the Wolf-Rayet bumps, sometimes display VMS signatures when these\nstars are present. At low Z, adding VMS to population synthesis models produces\nmore ionising photons down to 45 eV. At higher energy the ionising flux depends\non age, Z, assumption regarding VMS mass loss rates, and on the very short\nphases at the end of VMS evolution. HeII ionising fluxes large enough to\nproduce some amount of nebular HeII 4686 emission can be produced under\nspecific circumstances. Our models are able to reproduce qualitatively and\nsometimes also quantitatively the UV spectra of star-forming regions. However\nwe are not able to clearly identify which mass loss framework is favoured.",

Here we report an unusual\nhigh-frequency wide-band type-II burst with starting frequency as high as 600 -\n700 MHz and the instantaneous bandwidth being as wide as ~ 300 MHz. The\nestimated average spectral drift is ~ 2.18 MHz/s, its mean duration at each\nfrequency is ~ 3 min, the maximum brightness temperature can exceed 10^11 to\n10^12 K. According to the simultaneous EUV and radio imaging data, the radio\nsources distribute over a relatively broad region that concentrates around a\ndip of the nose front of the shock-like EUV wave structure. The dip is likely\ncaused by the strong interaction of the eruption with the overlying closed\ndense loops that are enclosed by the large-scale streamer structure, indicating\nthat the Type-II burst originates from such CME-shock interaction with\ndense-closed loop structures. The observations suggest that the unusual\nwide-band high frequency type-II radio burst originates from a dense streamer\nregion in the corona, supported by EUV shock-like structure that get steepened\nvery close to the solar surface ~ 1.23 R0 and type-II radio source coincides\nwith the shock dip. Further the wide-band feature is due to the source stemming\nfrom a region with large density variation and not due to the intensity\nvariation across the shock structure.",

Since the sparsity pattern of the\nrandomized factorization is unknown, computing such a factorization in parallel\nis extremely challenging, especially on many-core architectures such as GPUs.\nOur parallel algorithm dynamically computes the dependency among row/column\nindices of the Laplacian matrix to be factorized and processes the independent\nindices in parallel.

We propose GeoERM, a geometry-aware MTL\nframework that embeds the shared representation on its natural Riemannian\nmanifold and optimizes it via explicit manifold operations. Each training cycle\nperforms (i) a Riemannian gradient step that respects the intrinsic curvature\nof the search space, followed by (ii) an efficient polar retraction to remain\non the manifold, guaranteeing geometric fidelity at every iteration. The\nprocedure applies to a broad class of matrix-factorized MTL models and retains\nthe same per-iteration cost as Euclidean baselines.

Although this\ndirect reinforcement learning approach offers increased adaptability and\nresilience to model misspecification, its reliance on raw data leaves it\nvulnerable to system noise and disturbances that may undermine convergence,\nrobustness, and stability. In this article, we establish the convergence,\nrobustness, and stability of value iteration (VI) for data-driven control of\nstochastic linear quadratic (LQ) systems in discrete-time with entirely unknown\ndynamics and cost. Our contributions are three-fold. First, we prove that VI is\nglobally exponentially stable for any positive semidefinite initial value\nmatrix in noise-free settings, thereby significantly relaxing restrictive\nassumptions on initial value functions in existing literature. Second, we\nextend our analysis to scenarios with external disturbances, proving that VI\nmaintains small-disturbance input-to-state stability (ISS) and converges within\na small neighborhood of the optimal solution when disturbances are sufficiently\nsmall. Third, we propose a new non-model-based robust adaptive dynamic\nprogramming (ADP) algorithm for adaptive optimal controller design, which,\nunlike existing procedures, requires no prior knowledge of an initial\nadmissible control policy. Numerical experiments on a ``data center cooling''\nproblem demonstrate the convergence and stability of the algorithm compared to\nestablished methods, highlighting its robustness and adaptability for\ndata-driven control in noisy environments.

    "abstract": "Online Resource Allocation problem is a central problem in many areas of\nComputer Science, Operations Research, and Economics. In this problem, we\nsequentially receive $n$ stochastic requests for $m$ kinds of shared resources,\nwhere each request can be satisfied in multiple ways, consuming different\namounts of resources and generating different values. The goal is to achieve a\n$(1-\\epsilon)$-approximation to the hindsight optimum, where $\\epsilon>0$ is a\nsmall constant, assuming each resource has a large budget.\n  In this paper, we investigate the learnability and robustness of online\nresource allocation. Our primary contribution is a novel Exponential Pricing\nalgorithm with the following properties: 1. It requires only a \\emph{single\nsample} from each of the $n$ request distributions to achieve a\n$(1-\\epsilon)$-approximation for online resource allocation with large budgets.\nSuch an algorithm was previously unknown, even with access to polynomially many\nsamples, as prior work either assumed full distributional knowledge or was\nlimited to i.i.d.\\,or random-order arrivals. 2. It is robust to corruptions in\nthe outliers model and the value augmentation model. Specifically, it maintains\nits $(1 - \\epsilon)$-approximation guarantee under both these robustness\nmodels, resolving the open question posed in Argue, Gupta, Molinaro, and Singla\n(SODA'22). 3. It operates as a simple item-pricing algorithm that ensures\nincentive compatibility.\n  The intuition behind our Exponential Pricing algorithm is that the price of a\nresource should adjust exponentially as it is overused or underused. It differs\nfrom conventional approaches that use an online learning algorithm for item\npricing. This departure guarantees that the algorithm will never run out of any\nresource, but loses the usual no-regret properties of online learning\nalgorithms, necessitating a new analytical approach.",

The wide family of invariant solutions of the dispersionless Nizhnik\nequation that are related to the above submodel is expressed in terms of an\narbitrary function of the time variable and the double quadrature of the\nwell-known (implicit) general solution of the inviscid Burgers equation with\nrespect to a space-like submodel invariant variable.

Through this\ninvestigation, we first demonstrate that traditional distortion metrics are\nineffective in capturing bias in neural compression models. Next, we highlight\nthat racial bias is present in all neural compression models and can be\ncaptured by examining facial phenotype degradation in image reconstructions. We\nthen examine the relationship between bias and realism in the decoded images\nand demonstrate a trade-off across models. Finally, we show that utilizing a\nracially balanced training set can reduce bias but is not a sufficient bias\nmitigation strategy.

    "abstract": "In spite of accounting for only a small fraction of the mass of the\nInterstellar Medium (ISM), dust plays a primary role in many physical and\nchemical processes in the Universe. It is the main driver of extinction of\nradiation in the UV/optical wavelength range and a primary source of thermal IR\nemission. Dust grains contain most of the refractory elements of the ISM and\nthey host chemical processes that involve complex molecular compounds. However,\nobservational evidence suggests that grain structure is highly non-trivial and\nthat dust particles are characterized by granularity, asymmetry and\nstratification, which significantly affect their interaction with radiation\nfields. Accurate modeling of such interaction is fundamental to properly\nexplain observational results, but it is a computationally demanding task. Here\nwe present the possibility to investigate the effects of radiation/particle\ninteractions in non-spherically symmetric conditions using a novel\nimplementation of the Transition Matrix formalism, designed to run on scalable\nparallel hardware facilities.",

    "abstract": "The measurement of the Higgs boson self-coupling is crucial for our\nunderstanding of the nature of electroweak symmetry breaking and potential\nphysics beyond the Standard Model (BSM). In this work, we study in the\nframework of the 2-Higgs-Doublet Model (2HDM) the impact of one-loop\ncorrections to triple Higgs couplings (THCs) on the pair production of two\nStandard Model (SM)-like Higgs bosons $h$ at future high-energy $e^+ e^-$\ncolliders, focusing on the $e^+ e^- \\to Zhh$ process. By including the one-loop\ncorrections to the THCs relevant for this process, i.e. the coupling between\nthree SM-like Higgs bosons, $\\lambda_{hhh}$, and between the non-SM-like Higgs\n$H$, assumed to be heavier, and two SM-like Higgs bosons, $\\lambda_{hhH}$, we\naccount for the leading one-loop corrections to the di-Higgs production cross\nsection. We show that the one-loop corrected THC $\\lambda_{hhh}$ can be\nenhanced up to nearly six times its SM value, which substantially enhances the\ndi-Higgs production cross section w.r.t. the tree-level prediction, even in the\nalignment limit. On the other hand, one-loop corrections to $\\lambda_{hhH}$ can\nalso enhance its value, potentially yielding to more prominent heavy Higgs $H$\nresonant production. We explore the sensitivity to the loop-corrected\n$\\lambda_{hhh}$ and the possible access to $\\lambda_{hhH}$ via the $H$ resonant\npeak at a future high-energy $e^+e^-$ collider, such as the ILC. We highlight\nthe fact that including the one-loop corrected THCs can enhance the sensitivity\nto the $H$ resonant peak, and therefore to $\\lambda_{hhH}$. Finally, we discuss\nthe required experimental precision at future $e^+e^-$ colliders necessary to\nachieve these sensitivities.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a goal-oriented a posteriori error estimation framework\nfor linear functionals in the stabilized finite element discretization of the\nstationary convection-diffusion-reaction (CDR) equation. The theoretical\nframework for error estimation is based on the variational multiscale (VMS)\nconcept, where the solution is decomposed into resolved (finite element) and\nunresolved (sub-grid) scales. In this work, we propose an orthogonal sub-grid\nscale (OSGS) method for a goal-oriented error estimation in VMS\ndiscretizations. In the OSGS approach, the space of the sub-grid scales (SGSs)\nis orthogonal to the finite element space. The error is estimated in the\nquantity of interest, given by the linear functional $Q(u)$ of the unknown $u$.\nIf the SGS $u'$ is estimated, the error in the quantity of interest can be\napproximated by $Q(u')$. Our approach is compared with a duality-based a\nposteriori error estimation method, which requires the solution of an\nadditional auxiliary problem. The results indicate that both methods yield\nsimilar error estimates, whereas the VMS-based explicit approach is\ncomputationally less expensive than the duality-based implicit approach.\nNumerical tests demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed error estimation\ntechniques in terms of the quantity of interest functionals.",

    "abstract": "The origins of economic behavior remain unresolved-not only in the social\nsciences but also in AI, where dominant theories often rely on predefined\nincentives or institutional assumptions. Contrary to the longstanding myth of\nbarter as the foundation of exchange, converging evidence from early human\nsocieties suggests that reciprocity-not barter-was the foundational economic\nlogic, enabling communities to sustain exchange and social cohesion long before\nformal markets emerged. Yet despite its centrality, reciprocity lacks a\nsimulateable and cognitively grounded account. Here, we introduce a minimal\nbehavioral framework based on three empirically supported cognitive\nprimitives-individual recognition, reciprocal credence, and cost--return\nsensitivity-that enable agents to participate in and sustain reciprocal\nexchange, laying the foundation for scalable economic behavior. These\nmechanisms scaffold the emergence of cooperation, proto-economic exchange, and\ninstitutional structure from the bottom up. By bridging insights from\nprimatology, developmental psychology, and economic anthropology, this\nframework offers a unified substrate for modeling trust, coordination, and\neconomic behavior in both human and artificial systems.

JWST observations\nprovide unprecedented MIR spectroscopy of SN Iax, spanning from $+$11 to $+$42\ndays past maximum light. We detect forbidden emission lines in the MIR at these\nearly times while the optical and NIR are dominated by permitted lines with an\nabsorption component. Panchromatic spectra at early times can thus\nsimultaneously show nebular and photospheric lines, probing both inner and\nouter layers of the ejecta. We identify spectral lines not seen before in SN\nIax, including [Mg II] 4.76 $\\mu$m, [Mg II] 9.71 $\\mu$m, [Ne II] 12.81 $\\mu$m,\nand isolated O I 2.76 $\\mu$m that traces unburned material. Forbidden emission\nlines of all species are centrally peaked with similar kinematic distributions,\nindicating that the ejecta are well mixed in both SN 2024pxl and SN 2024vjm, a\nhallmark of pure deflagration explosion models. Radiative transfer modeling of\nSN 2024pxl shows good agreement with a weak deflagration of a\nnear-Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarf, but additional IR flux is needed to match\nthe observations, potentially attributable to a surviving remnant. We favor a\nweak deflagration origin for SN 2024vjm because of its panchromatic spectral\nsimilarity to SN 2024pxl, despite the large difference in luminosity. However,\nour comparison weak deflagration models are all too luminous and rapidly fading\ncompared to SN 2024vjm; future modeling should push to even weaker explosions\nand include the contribution of a bound remnant. Our observations demonstrate\nthe diagnostic power of panchromatic spectroscopy for unveiling explosion\nphysics in thermonuclear supernovae.",

Starting from spontaneous parametric down-conversion driven\nby a continuous-wave laser, we exploit the temporal entanglement between\nrandomly generated signal/idler pairs to obtain temporal resolution, and their\nspectral entanglement to select the excitation frequency. We also add spectral\nresolution in detection, using a Fourier transform approach which employs a\ncommon-path interferometer. We demonstrate the potential of our\nentangled-photon streak camera by resolving, at the single-photon level,\nexcitation energy transfer cascades from LH2 to LH1 in the photosynthetic\nmembrane and disentangling the lifetimes of two dyes in a mixture. We show that\ntime-resolved spectroscopy with quantum light can be performed without\ncompromising measurement time, recording a fluorescence time trace in less than\na minute even for samples with low quantum yield, which can be reduced to\nsub-second times with acceptable signal-to-noise ratio.

Using open-source geospatial data from\nOpenStreetMap, we extracted multidimensional features related to topography,\nmultimodality, green spaces, and points of interest for the cities of Lausanne,\nSwitzerland, and Philadelphia, USA. A grid-based approach was used to divide\neach city into Basic Spatial Units (BSU), and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)\nwere applied to cluster BSUs based on their urban characteristics. The results\nreveal coherent and interpretable urban typologies within each city, with some\ncluster types emerging across both cities despite their differences in scale,\ndensity, and cultural context. Comparative analysis showed that adapting the\ngrid size to each city's morphology improves the detection of shared\ntypologies. Simplified clustering based solely on network degree centrality\nfurther demonstrated that meaningful structural patterns can be captured even\nwith minimal feature sets. Our findings suggest the presence of functionally\nconvergent urban forms across continents and highlight the importance of\nspatial scale in cross-city comparisons. The framework offers a scalable and\ntransferable approach for urban analysis, providing valuable insights for\nplanners and policymakers aiming to enhance walkability, accessibility, and\nwell-being.

    "abstract": "Efficient and accurate particle tracking is crucial for measuring Standard\nModel parameters and searching for new physics. This task consists of two major\ncomputational steps: track finding, the identification of a subset of all hits\nthat are due to a single particle; and track fitting, the extraction of crucial\nparameters such as direction and momenta. Novel solutions to track finding via\nmachine learning have recently been developed. However, track fitting, which\ntraditionally requires searching for the best global solutions across a\nparameter volume plagued with local minima, has received comparatively little\nattention. Here, we propose a novel machine learning solution to track fitting.\nThe per-track optimization task of traditional fitting is transformed into a\nsingle learning task optimized in advance to provide constant-time track\nfitting via direct parameter regression. This approach allows us to optimize\ndirectly for the true targets, i.e., the precise and unbiased estimates of the\ntrack parameters. This is in contrast to traditional fitting, which optimizes a\nproxy based on the distance between the track and the hits. In addition, our\napproach removes the requirement of making simplifying assumptions about the\nnature of the noise model. Most crucially, in the simulated setting described\nhere, it provides more precise parameter estimates at a computational cost over\n1,000 times smaller, which leads directly to improvements in particle momentum\nestimation, vertex finding, jet substructure, and anomaly detection.",

Before the rise of LLM-based agents, a\ncommon strategy was to increase the number of generated patches, sometimes to\nthe thousands, to achieve better repair results on benchmarks. More recently,\nself-iterative capabilities enabled LLMs to refine patches over multiple rounds\nguided by feedback. However, literature often focuses on many iterations and\ndisregards different numbers of outputs.\n  We investigate an APR pipeline that balances these two approaches, the\ngeneration of multiple outputs and multiple rounds of iteration, while imposing\na limit of 10 total patches per bug. We apply three SOTA instruction-tuned LLMs\n- DeepSeekCoder-Instruct, Codellama-Instruct, Llama3.1-Instruct - to the APR\ntask. We further fine-tune each model on an APR dataset with three sizes (1K,\n30K, 65K) and two techniques (Full Fine-Tuning and LoRA), allowing us to assess\ntheir repair capabilities on two APR benchmarks: HumanEval-Java and Defects4J.\n  Our results show that by using only a fraction (<1%) of the fine-tuning\ndataset, we can achieve improvements of up to 78% in the number of plausible\npatches generated, challenging prior studies that reported limited gains using\nFull Fine-Tuning. However, we find that exceeding certain thresholds leads to\ndiminishing outcomes, likely due to overfitting. Moreover, we show that base\nmodels greatly benefit from creating patches in an iterative fashion rather\nthan generating them all at once. In addition, the benefit of iterative\nstrategies becomes more pronounced in complex benchmarks. Even fine-tuned\nmodels, while benefiting less from iterations, still gain advantages,\nparticularly on complex benchmarks. The research underscores the need for\nbalanced APR strategies that combine multi-output generation and iterative\nrefinement.",

The method that we adopt is based on determining an\noptimal separation of the Hamiltonian into a stabilizer component and a\nresidual part inducing non-stabilizerness. The corresponding stabilizer ground\nstate is efficiently prepared using techniques of graph states and stabilizer\ntableaux. We demonstrate this technique in context of the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick\nmodel, a fully-connected spin system presenting a second order phase transition\nfrom spherical to deformed state. The resulting stabilizer ground state is\nfound to capture to a large extent both bi-partite and collective multi-partite\nentanglement features of the exact solution in the region of large deformation.\nWe also explore several methods for injecting non-stabilizerness into the\nsystem, including ADAPT-VQE, and imaginary-time evolution (ITE) techniques.\nStabilizer ground states are found to accelerate ITE convergence due to a\nlarger overlap with the exact ground state. While further investigations are\nrequired, the present work suggests that collective features may be associated\nwith high but simple large-scale entanglement which can be captured by\nstabilizer states, while the interplay with single-particle motion may be\nresponsible for inducing non-stabilizerness. This study motivates applications\nof the proposed approach to more realistic quantum many-body systems, whose\nstabilizer ground states can be used in combinations with powerful classical\nmany-body techniques and/or quantum methods.",

In many cases, these\npopulations also show spatial and/or kinematic differences, which vary in\nstrength from cluster to cluster and tend to decrease with the clusters'\ndynamical ages. Aims: In this work, we aim to study the dynamical mixing of\nmultiple populations and establish a link between the more theoretical aspects\nof the mixing process and various observational parameters that quantify\ndifferences between the populations' spatial concentration and velocity\nanisotropy. Methods: We follow the dynamical mixing of multiple populations in\na set of numerical simulations through their distribution in the energy and\nangular momentum phase space and quantify the evolution of their degree of\ndynamical mixing. Results: We present the degree of dynamical mixing traced by\nthe intrinsic differences in the phase space distribution of the populations.\nWe compare the differences in phase-space with three observable quantities that\ndescribe the degree of mixing in the structural and kinematic differences of\nthe populations: $A^{+}$, commonly used in the literature for spatial\ndifferences; and we introduce two new parameters, $\\Delta A_{\\beta}$ that\ntraces the difference in velocity anisotropy and $\\sigma_{\\text{Lz}}$, that\ntraces the angular momentum distribution of stars. Conclusions: Our study\nprovides new insights into the dynamics of phase space mixing of multiple\npopulations in globular clusters.

The residuals reveal that stellar velocity dispersion $\\sigma$ and,\npossibly host dark matter halo mass $M_{\\rm halo}$, appear as the galactic\nproperties most correlated with SMBH mass, with a secondary (weaker)\ncorrelation with spheroidal (bulge) mass $M_{\\rm sph}$, as also corroborated by\nadditional Machine Learning tests.

Two state-of-the-art hydrodynamic simulations, inclusive of\nkinetic AGN feedback, are able to broadly capture the mean trends observed in\nthe residuals, although they tend to either favour $M_{\\rm sph}$ as the most\nfundamental property, or generate too flat residuals. Increasing AGN feedback\nkinetic output does not improve the comparison with the data. In the Appendix\nwe also show that the galaxies with dynamically measured SMBHs are biased high\nin $\\sigma$ at fixed luminosity with respect to the full sample of local\ngalaxies, proving that this bias is not a byproduct of stellar mass\ndiscrepancies.

At solar metallicity,\nbinary-stripped massive stars -- stars that lost their envelope through stable\ninteraction with a companion -- have been suggested to produce twice as much\ncarbon as their single-star counterparts. However, understanding the chemical\nevolution of galaxies over cosmic time requires examining stellar yields across\na range of metallicities. Using the stellar evolution code MESA, we compute the\ncarbon yields from wind mass loss and supernova explosions of single and\nbinary-stripped stars across a wide range of initial masses\n($10$-$46,M_\\odot$), metallicities ($Z = 0.0021$, $0.0047$, $0.0142$), and\ninitial orbital periods ($10$-$5000$ days). We find that metallicity is the\ndominant factor influencing the carbon yields of massive stars, outweighing the\neffects of binarity and detailed orbital parameters. Since the chemical yields\nfrom binary massive stars are highly sensitive to metallicity, we caution that\nyields predicted at solar metallicity should not be directly extrapolated to\nlower metallicities. At sub-solar metallicities, particularly below $1/7$\nsolar, weak stellar winds and inefficient binary stripping result in carbon\nyields from binary-stripped stars that closely resemble those of single stars.\nThis suggests that binary-stripped massive stars are unlikely to explain the\npresence of carbon-enhanced metal-poor stars or the carbon enrichment observed\nin high-redshift galaxies as probed by the James Webb Space Telescope. Our\nfindings only concern the stripped stars in massive binaries. The impact of\nother outcomes of binary star evolution, in particular stellar mergers and\naccretors, remains largely unexplored but will be necessary for a full\nunderstanding of the role of massive binaries in nucleosynthesis.",

While identifying the correct dual vacuum\nis subtle due to the rich structure of the Coulomb branch, we develop a mirror\ndualization algorithm that streamlines this process and systematically provides\nthe abelian-planar duals of chiral quivers.",

    "abstract": "We show that the direction of renormalization in effective field theory is\nconstrained by fundamental principles in the\ninfrared$\\unicode{x2014}$unitarity, analyticity, and Lorentz invariance. Our\ntheorem, in the spirit of the $a$-theorem in conformal field theory, determines\nthe sign of the one-loop running of couplings in the forward limit, when one\ninserts two operators whose mass dimensions are identical and even. The theorem\nholds for a broad class of effective field theories with arbitrary ultraviolet\ncompletions. The constraint directly applies to linear positivity bounds\nderived using tree-level amplitudes in the IR, providing a criterion for\nwhether renormalization effects can preserve the positivity bounds, or lead to\ntheir apparent violation. We discuss the phenomenological implications of our\ntheorem in chiral perturbation theory and the Standard Model Effective Field\nTheory, where our theorem is particularly constraining for the running at\ndimension eight. We provide several examples and show various extensions and\napplications even at dimension six.",

    "abstract": "We present early multi-wavelength photometric and spectroscopic observations\nof the Type IIb supernova SN 2024uwq, capturing its shock-cooling emission\nphase and double-peaked light curve evolution. Early spectra reveal broad\nH-alpha (v ~ 15,500 km s$^{-1}$) and He I P-Cygni profiles of similar\nstrengths. Over time the He I lines increase in strength while the H-alpha\ndecreases, consistent with a hydrogen envelope ($M_{env}$ = 0.7 - 1.35\n$M_\\odot$ ) overlying helium-rich ejecta. Analytic modeling of early shock\ncooling emission and bolometric light analysis constrains the progenitor to a\npartially stripped star with radius R = 10 - 60 $R_\\odot$, consistent with a\nblue/yellow supergiant with an initial ZAMS mass of 12 - 20 $M_\\odot$ , likely\nstripped via binary interaction. SN 2024uwq occupies a transitional position\nbetween compact and extended Type IIb supernovae, highlighting the role of\nbinary mass-transfer efficiency in shaping a continuum of stripped-envelope\nprogenitors. Our results underscore the importance of both early UV/optical\nobservations to characterize shock breakout signatures critical to map the\ndiversity in evolutionary pathways of massive stars. Upcoming time domain\nsurveys including Rubin Observatory's LSST and UV missions like ULTRASAT and\nUVEX will revolutionise our ability to systematically capture these early\nsignatures, probing the full diversity of stripped progenitors and their\nexplosive endpoints.",

    "abstract": "We investigate potential deviations from the standard adiabatic evolution of\nthe cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature, $T_{\\rm CMB}(z)$, using the\nlatest Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) effect measurements and molecular line excitation\ndata, covering a combined redshift range of $0 < z \\lesssim 6$. We follow\ndifferent approaches. First, we reconstruct the redshift evolution of $T_{\\rm\nCMB}(z)$ in a model-independent way using Gaussian Process regression. The\ntightest constraints come from SZ measurements at $z < 1$, while molecular line\ndata at $z > 3$ yield broader uncertainties. By combining both datasets, we\nfind good consistency with the standard evolution across the full analysed\nredshift range, inferring a present-day CMB monopole temperature of $T_0 =\n2.744 \\pm 0.019$ K. Next, we test for deviations from the standard scaling by\nadopting the parameterisation $T_{\\rm CMB}(z) = T_0(1+z)^{1-\\beta}$, where\n$\\beta$ quantifies departures from adiabaticity, with $\\beta = 0$ corresponding\nto the standard scenario. In this framework, we use Gaussian Process\nreconstruction to test the consistency of $\\beta = 0$ across the full redshift\nrange and perform $\\chi^2$ minimisation techniques to determine the best-fit\nvalues of $T_0$ and $\\beta$. In both cases, we find good consistency with the\nstandard temperature-redshift relation. The $\\chi^2$-minimisation analysis\nyields best-fit values of $\\beta = -0.0106 \\pm 0.0124$ and $T_0 = 2.7276 \\pm\n0.0095$ K, in excellent agreement with both $\\beta = 0$ and independent direct\nmeasurements of $T_0$ from FIRAS and ARCADE. We discuss the implications of our\nfindings, which offer strong empirical support for the standard cosmological\nprediction and place tight constraints on a wide range of alternative scenarios\nof interest in the context of cosmological tensions and fundamental physics.",

The main difference to\nStandard Perturbation Theory (SPT) arises from taking the velocity dispersion\ntensor into account, and the resulting screening of the backreaction of UV\nmodes renders loop integrals cutoff-independent. VPT is informed about\nnon-perturbative small scale dynamics via the average value of the dispersion\ngenerated by shell-crossing, which impacts the evolution of perturbations on\nweakly non-linear scales. When using an average dispersion from halo models,\nthe VPT power spectrum agrees with the one from the simulation, up to\ndifferences from missing three-loop contributions. Alternatively, treating the\naverage dispersion as free parameter we find a remarkably stable prediction of\nthe matter power spectrum from collisionless dynamics at percent level for a\nwide range of the dispersion scale. We quantify the impact of truncating the\nVlasov hierarchy for the cumulants of the phase-space distribution function,\nfinding that the two-loop matter power spectrum is robust to neglecting third\nand higher cumulants. Finally, we introduce and validate a simplified fast\nscheme fVPT that can be easily incorporated into existing codes and is as\nnumerically efficient as SPT.",

Studying their life cycle is essential to\nfully understand the SF process.\n  Aims: We aim to characterise the impact of magnetic field ($B$) and stellar\nfeedback on the evolution of filamentary structures in star-forming clouds.\n  Methods: We performed two numerical simulations of a collapsing\n$10^4\\,$M$_\\odot$ cloud with different mass-to-flux ratios ($\\mu=2$ and\n$\\mu=8$), including early stellar feedback (jets and HII regions). Using\nDisPerSE, we extracted the three-dimensional filamentary network and analysed\nits properties as it evolves throughout the SF event.\n  Results: We observed that the filamentary network in the simulations follow\ntwo distinct evolutionary pathways. In the strongly magnetised case, the cloud\nmaintains a sparser filamentary network, and the arising filaments are\npredominantly perpendicular to $B$ lines. With a weak field, the cloud develops\na single central hub, with converging filaments favouring a parallel alignment\nrelative to $B$. Furthermore, while always accreting, filaments exhibit faster\nflows towards the hub relative to the surrounding gas. In the weakly magnetised\nrun, the central hub dominates the dynamics, and filaments exhibit faster flows\nas they approach the central hub. Finally, once the expanding HII region\nimpacts the filaments, they align to $B$ independently of the initial\nconfiguration.\n  Conclusions: Magnetic fields play a critical role in shaping the structure\nand dynamics of molecular clouds. Stronger magnetic fields slow the cloud's\nevolution and inhibit the formation of central hubs, promoting a broader\nfilamentary network instead.\n  However, ionising feedback dominates the late-stage evolution, overriding the\ninitial differences and dictating the final filament configuration.",

Our work bridges many-body physics and waveguide QED,\nrevealing how photonic many-body states shape emitter dynamics.",

In contrast to their abelian\ncounterparts, non-abelian anyons present unique challenges due to their\nnon-invertible fusion rules and non-abelian braiding structures. We address\nthese challenges using a Chern-Simons-Ginzburg-Landau (CSGL) framework that\nincorporates the crucial effect of energy splitting between different anyon\nfusion channels at nonzero dopant density. For the Moore-Read state, we show\nthat doping the charge $e/4$ non-abelion naturally leads to a fully gapped\ncharge-$2$ superconductor without any coexisting topological order. The chiral\ncentral charge of the superconductor depends on details of the interactions\ndetermining the splitting of anyon fusion channels. For general $\\mathrm{RR}_k$\nstates, our analysis of states obtained by doping the basic non-abelion $a_0$\nwith charge $e/(k+2)$ reveals a striking even/odd pattern in the Read-Rezayi\nindex $k$. We develop a general physical picture for anyon-driven\nsuperconductivity based on charge-flux unbinding, and show how it relates to\nthe CSGL description of doped abelian quantum Hall states. Finally, as a bonus,\nwe use the CSGL formalism to describe transitions between the $\\mathrm{RR}_k$\nstate and a trivial period-$(k+2)$ CDW insulator at fixed filling, driven by\nthe gap closure of the fundamental non-abelian anyon $a_0$. Notably, for $k=2$,\nthis predicts a period-4 CDW neighboring the Moore-Read state at half-filling,\noffering a potential explanation of recent numerical observations in models of\ntwisted MoTe$_2$.",

To this end, we introduce\nScenethesis, a training-free agentic framework that integrates LLM-based scene\nplanning with vision-guided layout refinement. Given a text prompt, Scenethesis\nfirst employs an LLM to draft a coarse layout.

Next, an optimization module iteratively enforces\naccurate pose alignment and physical plausibility, preventing artifacts like\nobject penetration and instability.

To address this\nissue, we propose the StableReinforce algorithm, which refines the training\nloss, advantage estimation strategy, and reward design of existing RL methods.\nThese refinements result in more stable training dynamics and superior\nperformance. To facilitate MRM training, we collect 200K preference data from\ndiverse datasets. Our reward model, R1-Reward, trained using the\nStableReinforce algorithm on this dataset, significantly improves performance\non multimodal reward modeling benchmarks.

Because sepsis can worsen rapidly, early\ndetection is critical to saving lives. However, current diagnostic methods\noften identify sepsis only after significant damage has already occurred. Our\nproject aims to address this challenge by developing a machine learning based\nsystem to predict sepsis in its early stages, giving healthcare providers more\ntime to intervene.\n  A major problem with existing models is the wide variability in the patient\ninformation or features they use, such as heart rate, temperature, and lab\nresults. This inconsistency makes models difficult to compare and limits their\nability to work across different hospitals and settings. To solve this, we\npropose a method called Feature Aligned Transfer Learning (FATL), which\nidentifies and focuses on the most important and commonly reported features\nacross multiple studies, ensuring the model remains consistent and clinically\nrelevant.\n  Most existing models are trained on narrow patient groups, leading to\npopulation bias. FATL addresses this by combining knowledge from models trained\non diverse populations, using a weighted approach that reflects each models\ncontribution. This makes the system more generalizable and effective across\ndifferent patient demographics and clinical environments. FATL offers a\npractical and scalable solution for early sepsis detection, particularly in\nhospitals with limited resources, and has the potential to improve patient\noutcomes, reduce healthcare costs, and support more equitable healthcare\ndelivery.",

I show that\nin 1ES~1927+654 the white dwarf's orbital plane oscillates with angular\namplitude $\\simeq 71^{\\circ}$ each side of the orbital plane of the distant\nstar. This causes correlated changes of the orbital eccentricity and\nquasiperiod, and of the accretion luminosity driven by gravitational radiation\nlosses. The GR luminosity has the characteristic property that it is inversely\nproportional to the instantaneous binary quasiperiod in all cases.

    "abstract": "Recent studies have demonstrated that learning a meaningful internal\nrepresentation can both accelerate generative training and enhance the\ngeneration quality of diffusion transformers. However, existing approaches\nnecessitate to either introduce an external and complex representation training\nframework or rely on a large-scale, pre-trained representation foundation model\nto provide representation guidance during the original generative training\nprocess. In this study, we posit that the unique discriminative process\ninherent to diffusion transformers enables them to offer such guidance without\nrequiring external representation components. We therefore propose\nSelf-Representation Alignment (SRA), a simple yet straightforward method that\nobtains representation guidance through a self-distillation manner.\nSpecifically, SRA aligns the output latent representation of the diffusion\ntransformer in the earlier layer with higher noise to that in the later layer\nwith lower noise to progressively enhance the overall representation learning\nduring only the generative training process. Experimental results indicate that\napplying SRA to DiTs and SiTs yields consistent performance improvements.\nMoreover, SRA not only significantly outperforms approaches relying on\nauxiliary, complex representation training frameworks but also achieves\nperformance comparable to methods that are heavily dependent on powerful\nexternal representation priors.",

In this article, we conduct a scoping\nreview of existing literature to elicit details on the conflict between privacy\nand explainability.

However, the\ngrowing trend of fine-tuning pre-trained models for personalization raises\nserious concerns about unauthorized dataset usage. To combat this, dataset\nownership verification (DOV) has emerged as a solution, embedding watermarks\ninto the fine-tuning datasets using backdoor techniques. These watermarks\nremain inactive under benign samples but produce owner-specified outputs when\ntriggered. Despite the promise of DOV for T2I diffusion models, its robustness\nagainst copyright evasion attacks (CEA) remains unexplored. In this paper, we\nexplore how attackers can bypass these mechanisms through CEA, allowing models\nto circumvent watermarks even when trained on watermarked datasets. We propose\nthe first copyright evasion attack (i.e., CEAT2I) specifically designed to\nundermine DOV in T2I diffusion models. Concretely, our CEAT2I comprises three\nstages: watermarked sample detection, trigger identification, and efficient\nwatermark mitigation. A key insight driving our approach is that T2I models\nexhibit faster convergence on watermarked samples during the fine-tuning,\nevident through intermediate feature deviation. Leveraging this, CEAT2I can\nreliably detect the watermarked samples. Then, we iteratively ablate tokens\nfrom the prompts of detected watermarked samples and monitor shifts in\nintermediate features to pinpoint the exact trigger tokens. Finally, we adopt a\nclosed-form concept erasure method to remove the injected watermark. Extensive\nexperiments show that our CEAT2I effectively evades DOV mechanisms while\npreserving model performance.",

    "abstract": "Agents are predominantly evaluated and optimized via task success metrics,\nwhich are coarse, rely on manual design from experts, and fail to reward\nintermediate emergent behaviors. We propose AutoLibra, a framework for agent\nevaluation, that transforms open-ended human feedback e.g. \"If you find that\nthe button is disabled, don't click it again\", or \"This agent has too much\nautonomy to decide what to do on its own\" into metrics for evaluating\nfine-grained behaviors in agent trajectories. AutoLibra accomplishes this by\ngrounding feedback to an agent's behavior, clustering similar positive and\nnegative behaviors, and creating concrete metrics with clear definitions and\nconcrete examples, which can be used for prompting LLM-as-a-Judge as\nevaluators. We further propose two meta-metrics to evaluate the alignment of a\nset of (induced) metrics with open feedback: \"coverage\" and \"redundancy\".\nThrough optimizing these meta-metrics, we experimentally demonstrate\nAutoLibra's ability to induce more concrete agent evaluation metrics than the\nones proposed in previous agent evaluation benchmarks and discover new metrics\nto analyze agents. We also present two applications of AutoLibra in agent\nimprovement: First, we show that AutoLibra-induced metrics serve as better\nprompt-engineering targets than the task success rate on a wide range of text\ngame tasks, improving agent performance over baseline by a mean of 20%. Second,\nwe show that AutoLibra can iteratively select high-quality fine-tuning data for\nweb navigation agents. Our results suggest that AutoLibra is a powerful\ntask-agnostic tool for evaluating and improving language agents.",

Applied to several large language models (LLMs), ReplaceMe\nachieves up to 25% pruning while retaining approximately 90% of the original\nmodel's performance on open benchmarks - without any training or healing steps,\nresulting in minimal computational overhead (see Fig.1).

The lightest neutral states for both the scalar\nand fermion, which are non-trivially transformed under the extended symmetry,\nbehave as stable two-component DM candidates. While single components are\nunder-abundant due to their gauge interactions, in a mass region between $m_W$\nand $525$ GeV for the scalar and a mass below $1200$ GeV for the fermion, and\nthe fermion DM conflicts with direct detection limits over the whole parameter\nspace, having two components helps to saturate relic density in the regions\nwith under-abundance.

Although recent advances in deep learning and\nlarge-scale datasets have enabled highly accurate recognition under closed-set\nconditions, real-world deployment demands open-set gait enrollment, which means\ndetermining whether a new gait sample corresponds to a known identity or\nrepresents a previously unseen individual. In this work, we introduce a\ntransformer-based framework for open-set gait enrollment that is both\ndataset-agnostic and recognition-architecture-agnostic. Our method leverages a\nSetTransformer to make enrollment decisions based on the embedding of a probe\nsample and a context set drawn from the gallery, without requiring\ntask-specific thresholds or retraining for new environments. By decoupling\nenrollment from the main recognition pipeline, our model is generalized across\ndifferent datasets, gallery sizes, and identity distributions. We propose an\nevaluation protocol that uses existing datasets in different ratios of\nidentities and walks per identity. We instantiate our method using\nskeleton-based gait representations and evaluate it on two benchmark datasets\n(CASIA-B and PsyMo), using embeddings from three state-of-the-art recognition\nmodels (GaitGraph, GaitFormer, and GaitPT).

However, complex tasks requiring multi-round retrieval\nremain challenging, and early attempts tend to be overly optimistic without a\ngood sense of self-skepticism. Current multi-round RAG systems may continue\nsearching even when enough information has already been retrieved, or they may\nprovide incorrect answers without having sufficient information or knowledge.\nExisting solutions either require large amounts of expensive human-labeled\nprocess supervision data or lead to subpar performance. This paper aims to\naddress these limitations by introducing a new framework, SIM-RAG, to\nexplicitly enhance RAG systems' self-awareness and multi-round retrieval\ncapabilities. To train SIM-RAG, we first let a RAG system self-practice\nmulti-round retrieval, augmenting existing question-answer pairs with\nintermediate inner monologue reasoning steps to generate synthetic training\ndata. For each pair, the system may explore multiple retrieval paths, which are\nlabeled as successful if they reach the correct answer and unsuccessful\notherwise. Using this data, we train a lightweight information sufficiency\nCritic. At inference time, the Critic evaluates whether the RAG system has\nretrieved sufficient information at each round, guiding retrieval decisions and\nimproving system-level self-awareness through in-context reinforcement\nlearning. Experiments across multiple prominent RAG benchmarks show that\nSIM-RAG is an effective multi-round RAG solution. Furthermore, this framework\nis system-efficient, adding a lightweight component to RAG without requiring\nmodifications to existing LLMs or search engines, and data-efficient,\neliminating the need for costly human-annotated mid-step retrieval process\nsupervision data.",

Despite studies over the last five decades, it has been\nchallenging to obtain a clear physical link between the various populations of\nneutron stars, vital to constrain their formation and evolutionary pathways.\nHere we report the detection of a burst of coherent radio emission from a known\nradio-quiet, thermally emitting neutron star 2XMM J104608.7$-$594306in the\nCarina Nebula. The burst has a distinctive sharp rise followed by a decay made\nup of multiple components, which is unlike anything seen from other\nradio-emitting neutron stars. It suggests an episodic event from the neutron\nstar surface, akin to transient radio emission seen from magnetars. The radio\nburst confirms that the X-ray source is a neutron star and suggests a new link\nbetween these apparently radio-quiet X-ray emitting sources and other transient\nor persistent radio-emitting neutron stars. It also suggests that a common\nphysical mechanism for emission might operate over a range of magnetic field\nstrengths and neutron star ages. We propose that 2XMM J104608.7$-$594306\nstraddles the boundary between young, energetic neutron stars and their evolved\nradio-emitting cousins and may bridge these two populations. The detection of\nsuch a radio burst also shows that other radio-quiet neutron stars may also\nemit such sporadic radio emission that has been missed by previous radio\nsurveys and highlights the need for regular monitoring of this unique\nsub-population of neutron stars.",

The performance of the system, from both a\nspectral efficiency (SE) and energy efficiency (EE) perspective, is\ncomprehensively analyzed.

The challenging optimization problems are solved\nusing successive convex approximation (SCA) techniques. The proposed framework\ndesign is further applied to the average sum-HE maximization and energy\nharvesting fairness problems.

Resizing images is a common strategy to\nimprove detection accuracy, particularly for small objects.

This paper proposes a Dynamic Pooling Network (DPNet) for tiny\nobject detection to mitigate these issues. DPNet employs a flexible\ndown-sampling strategy by introducing a factor (df) to relax the fixed\ndownsampling process of the feature map to an adjustable one. Furthermore, we\ndesign a lightweight predictor to predict df for each input image, which is\nused to decrease the resolution of feature maps in the backbone. Thus, we\nachieve input-aware downsampling. We also design an Adaptive Normalization\nModule (ANM) to make a unified detector compatible with different dfs. A\nguidance loss supervises the predictor's training. DPNet dynamically allocates\ncomputing resources to trade off between detection accuracy and efficiency.\nExperiments on the TinyCOCO and TinyPerson datasets show that DPNet can save\nover 35% and 25% GFLOPs, respectively, while maintaining comparable detection\nperformance.

The 13 March 2023 event is particularly\nnotable as a widespread SEP event associated with an exceptionally fast\ninterplanetary shock. With speeds of up to 3000 km/s, it is one of the most\nextreme shocks observed in recent years.\n  We aim to investigate whether the flanks of a wide CME-driven shock can\ndecouple from the CME and continue propagating as freely propagating shock\nwaves. If shocks are the primary SEP source, such a mechanism could help\nexplain some of the widest SEP events.\n  Using EUHFORIA, a 3D magnetohydrodynamic heliospheric model, we simulated the\nevolution of wide CME-driven shocks. We modified the model to allow direct\nshock injection at the inner boundary, upstream of the CME ejecta. Applying\nthis to the 13 March 2023 event, we modelled two simultaneous CMEs whose shocks\nform a single, wide shock envelope that spans 280{\\deg} in longitude. We then\ncompared our results to in situ observations.\n  Our simulations show that the flanks of wide CME shocks can persist as freely\npropagating waves beyond 2 au. For the 13 March 2023 event, the modelled shock\narrival times and amplitudes of associated plasma parameters (e.g. speed and\ndensity) show good agreement with observations from various spacecraft\ndistributed across different radial distances and longitudes. Furthermore, the\ncombined shock structure expands into a quasi-circumsolar wave as it propagates\noutwards.\n  These findings indicate that the shock flanks of fast CMEs can persist for a\nlong time, supporting the idea that such freely propagating shock flanks play a\nkey role in the global distribution of SEPs in widespread events.",

This implies that on\nthe square lattice, the system with VH singularities is unstable with respect\nto altermagnetic perturbations. The leading instability for the\n$d_{x^2-y^2}$-model is real transverse spin density wave. For the $d_{xy}$-wave\nmodel, it is found to be real transverse spin density wave at large\naltermagnetic splitting.

The FeTA Challenge 2024 advanced\nautomated fetal brain MRI analysis by introducing biometry prediction as a new\ntask alongside tissue segmentation. For the first time, our diverse\nmulti-centric test set included data from a new low-field (0.55T) MRI dataset.\nEvaluation metrics were also expanded to include the topology-specific Euler\ncharacteristic difference (ED). Sixteen teams submitted segmentation methods,\nmost of which performed consistently across both high- and low-field scans.\nHowever, longitudinal trends indicate that segmentation accuracy may be\nreaching a plateau, with results now approaching inter-rater variability. The\nED metric uncovered topological differences that were missed by conventional\nmetrics, while the low-field dataset achieved the highest segmentation scores,\nhighlighting the potential of affordable imaging systems when paired with\nhigh-quality reconstruction. Seven teams participated in the biometry task, but\nmost methods failed to outperform a simple baseline that predicted measurements\nbased solely on gestational age, underscoring the challenge of extracting\nreliable biometric estimates from image data alone. Domain shift analysis\nidentified image quality as the most significant factor affecting model\ngeneralization, with super-resolution pipelines also playing a substantial\nrole. Other factors, such as gestational age, pathology, and acquisition site,\nhad smaller, though still measurable, effects. Overall, FeTA 2024 offers a\ncomprehensive benchmark for multi-class segmentation and biometry estimation in\nfetal brain MRI, underscoring the need for data-centric approaches, improved\ntopological evaluation, and greater dataset diversity to enable clinically\nrobust and generalizable AI tools.",

Essential graphs,\nwhich represent a Markov equivalence class of DAGs characterized by the same\nset of $d$-separations, provide a more practical and realistic alternative.\nHowever, learning the full essential graph is computationally intensive and\ntypically depends on strong, untestable assumptions.

Our\napproach uses a series representation of the MSD where the $k$-th term is given\nin terms of the mean scalar product $\\langle \\mathbf{r}_1\\cdot\\mathbf{r}_k\n\\rangle$, with $\\mathbf{r}_i$ denoting the displacements of the tracer between\nsuccessive collisions. We find that this series approximates a geometric series\nwith the ratio $\\Omega$. We derive an explicit analytical expression of\n$\\Omega$ for granular gases in three dimensions, and validate it through a\ncomparison with the numerical results obtained from the direct simulation Monte\nCarlo (DSMC) method. Our comparison covers a wide range of masses, sizes, and\ninelasticities. From the geometric series, we find that the MSD per collision\nis simply given by the mean-square free path of the particle divided by\n$1-\\Omega$. The analytical expression for the MSD derived here is compared with\nDSMC data and with the first- and second-Sonine approximations to the MSD\nobtained from the Chapman-Enskog solution of the Boltzmann equation.\nSurprisingly, despite their simplicity, our results outperforms the predictions\nof the first-Sonine approximation to the MSD, achieving accuracy comparable to\nthe second-Sonine approximation.",

    "abstract": "Public events, such as music concerts and fireworks displays, can cause\nirregular surges in cross-city travel demand, leading to potential\novercrowding, travel delays, and public safety concerns. To better anticipate\nand accommodate such demand surges, it is essential to estimate cross-city\nvisitor flows with awareness of public events. Although prior studies typically\nfocused on the effects of a single mega event or disruptions around a single\nvenue, this study introduces a generalizable framework to analyze visitor flows\nunder diverse and concurrent events. We propose to leverage large language\nmodels (LLMs) to extract event features from multi-source online information\nand massive user-generated content on social media platforms. Specifically,\nsocial media popularity metrics are designed to capture the effects of online\npromotion and word-of-mouth in attracting visitors. An event-aware machine\nlearning model is then adopted to uncover the specific impacts of different\nevent features and ultimately predict visitor flows for upcoming events. Using\nHong Kong as a case study, the framework is applied to predict daily flows of\nmainland Chinese visitors arriving at the city, achieving a testing R-squared\nof over 85%. We further investigate the heterogeneous event impacts on visitor\nnumbers across different event types and major travel modes. Both promotional\npopularity and word-of-mouth popularity are found to be associated with\nincreased visitor flows, but the specific effects vary by the event type. This\nassociation is more pronounced among visitors arriving by metro and high-speed\nrail, while it has less effect on air travelers. The findings can facilitate\ncoordinated measures across government agencies and guide specialized transport\npolicies, such as shuttle transit services to event venues, and comprehensive\non-site traffic management strategies.",

    "abstract": "Galaxy clusters are powerful probes of cosmology, and the halo mass function\n(HMF) serves as a fundamental tool for extracting cosmological information.\nPrevious calibrations of the HMF in dynamical dark energy (DE) models either\nassumed a homogeneous DE component or a fixed sound speed of unity, which\nstrongly suppresses DE perturbations. We extend the HMF calibration to\nclustering dark energy (CDE) models by allowing for a sound speed $(c_{\\rm s})$\nvalue different than unity. This generalization enables a broader description\nof the impact of DE perturbations on structure formation. Our approach builds\nupon the DUCA simulation suite that accounts for DE at the background and\nperturbative levels. We present an HMF calibration based on introducing an\neffective peak height while maintaining the multiplicity function as previously\ncalibrated. The effective peak height is written as a function of the peak\nheight computed using the matter power spectrum of the homogeneous DE case, but\nit is modulated by the amplitude of DE and matter perturbations on the\nnon-homogeneous case at the turnaround. The model depends on one single\nparameter, which we calibrate using $N$-body simulations, following a Bayesian\napproach. The resulting HMF model achieves sub-percent accuracy over a wide\nrange of $c_{\\rm s}$ values. Our analysis reveals that, although the overall\nimpact of CDE on halo abundances remains modest (typically a few percent), the\neffects are more pronounced in non-phantom DE scenarios. Our model\nqualitatively agrees with predictions based on the spherical collapse model,\nbut predicts a significantly lower impact for low $c_{\\rm s}$. Our results\nunderscore the need for more precise modeling of CDE's nonlinear regime.\nNumerical simulations and theoretical approaches must be advanced to capture\nthe complex interplay between DE perturbations and matter fully.",

Existing protocols in this\nsetting incur an optimal 3 steps to reach a decision while tolerating up to $f\n< n/3$ Byzantine faults, where $n$ is the number of parties. In this work, we\npropose an optimistic RBC protocol that maintains the $f < n/3$ fault tolerance\nbut achieves termination in just 2 steps under certain optimistic\nconditions--when at least $\\lceil \\frac{n+2f-2}{2} \\rceil$ non-broadcaster\nparties behave honestly.

Under optimistic conditions, this\nprotocol achieves a commit latency of 3 steps--matching the performance of the\nbest signature-based protocols.

Positive reinforcement in the form of food and\npetting is commonly received from humans. In this study, we investigated which\ntype of reward, food or petting, is more influential in shaping positive social\nassociations with unfamiliar humans. Field trials were conducted on 61 adult\nfree-ranging dogs in Nadia district, West Bengal, India. During a\nfamiliarization phase, two unfamiliar individuals each provided either food or\npetting to the dogs.

Deep learning approaches, particularly convolutional neural\nnetworks (CNNs) using supervised learning strategies, have shown considerable\nsuccess for such tasks. However, CNN based architectures such as U-Net, often\nstruggles to accurately identify platelets due to their sizes and high\nvariability of features. To address these challenges, researchers have commonly\nemployed strategies such as class weighted loss functions, which have\ndemonstrated some success.

    "abstract": "The AI/HCI and legal communities have developed largely independent\nconceptualizations of fairness. This conceptual difference hinders the\npotential incorporation of technical fairness criteria (e.g., procedural,\ngroup, and individual fairness) into sustainable policies and designs,\nparticularly for high-stakes applications like recidivism risk assessment. To\nfoster common ground, we conduct legal research to identify if and how\ntechnical AI conceptualizations of fairness surface in primary legal sources.\nWe find that while major technical fairness criteria can be linked to\nconstitutional mandates such as ``Due Process'' and ``Equal Protection'' thanks\nto judicial interpretation, several challenges arise when operationalizing them\ninto concrete statutes/regulations. These policies often adopt procedural and\ngroup fairness but ignore the major technical criterion of individual fairness.\nRegarding procedural fairness, judicial ``scrutiny'' categories are relevant\nbut may not fully capture how courts scrutinize the use of demographic features\nin potentially discriminatory government tools like RRA. Furthermore, some\npolicies contradict each other on whether to apply procedural fairness to\ncertain demographic features. Thus, we propose a new framework, integrating\nU.S. demographics-related legal scrutiny concepts and technical fairness\ncriteria, and contextualize it in three other major AI-adopting jurisdictions\n(EU, China, and India).",

But despite this, there are very few\nmeasurements of the abundance and depletion of carbon in the diffuse ISM. As\nwith other elements, these measurements are traditionally performed in the\nultraviolet. But for carbon, such measurements are extremely difficult, and\nless than 20 have been reported in the literature to date. Here, we present a\nnovel method of measuring the abundance and depletion of carbon in the diffuse\nISM: by observing absorption of the 158 $\\mu$m [CII] line in the far-infrared.\nWe present a catalog of 432 candidate sightlines that use bright nearby\ngalaxies as background sources, and predict the [CII] absorption expected\ntowards each. We conducted a pilot study using SOFIA, targeting sightlines\ntowards the galaxies IC342 and Circinus. We report a potential detection of\nGalactic [CII] absorption along the IC342 sightline, although it requires\ndisentangling [CII] emission from IC342 itself. The Circinus sightline had an\ninsufficiently stable instrumental baseline to allow a detection. This SOFIA\nstudy informs the prospects for [CII] absorption measurements with future\nfacilities. To that end, we explore the potential for four proposed future FIR\ntelescopes -- PRIMA, FIRSST, SALTUS, and Origins -- to detect [CII] absorption.\nWe find that all four facilities would be able to detect [CII] absorption along\na significant number of sightlines.",

It focuses particularly on AI's role in early diagnosis,\nutilizing advanced machine learning techniques and data analysis. Recent\nstudies demonstrate that deep learning algorithms can identify behavioral\npatterns through biometric data analysis, video-based interaction assessments,\nand linguistic feature extraction, providing a more accurate and timely\ndiagnosis compared to traditional methods. Additionally, AI automates\ndiagnostic tools, reducing subjective biases and enabling the development of\npersonalized assessment protocols for ASD monitoring. At the same time, the\npaper examines AI-powered intervention technologies, emphasizing educational\nrobots and adaptive communication tools. Social robotic assistants, such as NAO\nand Kaspar, have been shown to enhance social skills in children by offering\nstructured, repetitive interactions that reinforce learning. Furthermore,\nAI-driven Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) systems allow\nchildren with ASD to express themselves more effectively, while\nmachine-learning chatbots provide language development support through\npersonalized responses. The study presents research findings supporting the\neffectiveness of these AI applications while addressing challenges such as\nlong-term evaluation and customization to individual needs.

    "abstract": "Physical computing has emerged as a powerful tool for performing intelligent\ntasks directly in the mechanical domain of functional materials and robots,\nreducing our reliance on the more traditional COMS computers. However, no\nsystematic study explains how mechanical design can influence physical\ncomputing performance. This study sheds insights into this question by\nrepurposing an origami-inspired modular robotic manipulator into an adaptive\nphysical reservoir and systematically evaluating its computing capacity with\ndifferent physical configurations, input setups, and computing tasks. By\nchallenging this adaptive reservoir computer to complete the classical NARMA\nbenchmark tasks, this study shows that its time series emulation performance\ndirectly correlates to the Peak Similarity Index (PSI), which quantifies the\nfrequency spectrum correlation between the target output and reservoir\ndynamics. The adaptive reservoir also demonstrates perception capabilities,\naccurately extracting its payload weight and orientation information from the\nintrinsic dynamics. Importantly, such information extraction capability can be\nmeasured by the spatial correlation between nodal dynamics within the reservoir\nbody. Finally, by integrating shape memory alloy (SMA) actuation, this study\ndemonstrates how to exploit such computing power embodied in the physical body\nfor practical, robotic operations. This study provides a strategic framework\nfor harvesting computing power from soft robots and functional materials,\ndemonstrating how design parameters and input selection can be configured based\non computing task requirements.

At its core, dyGRASS employs a random-walk-based\nmethod to efficiently estimate node-to-node distances in both the original\ngraph (for decremental update) and its sparsifier (for incremental update). For\nincremental updates, dyGRASS enables the identification of spectrally critical\nedges among the updates to capture the latest structural changes. For\ndecremental updates, dyGRASS facilitates the recovery of important edges from\nthe original graph back into the sparsifier. To further enhance computational\nefficiency, dyGRASS employs a GPU-based non-backtracking random walk scheme\nthat allows multiple walkers to operate simultaneously across various target\nupdates. This parallelization significantly improves both the performance and\nscalability of the proposed dyGRASS framework. Our comprehensive experimental\nevaluations reveal that dyGRASS achieves approximately a 10x speedup compared\nto the state-of-the-art incremental sparsification (inGRASS) algorithm while\neliminating the setup overhead and improving solution quality in incremental\nspectral sparsification tasks.

To mitigate these issues, Knowledge\nGraphs (KGs) have been proposed as a structured external source of information\nto enrich LLMs. With this idea, in this work we use KGs to enhance LLMs for\nzero-shot Entity Disambiguation (ED). For that purpose, we leverage the\nhierarchical representation of the entities' classes in a KG to gradually prune\nthe candidate space as well as the entities' descriptions to enrich the input\nprompt with additional factual knowledge. Our evaluation on popular ED datasets\nshows that the proposed method outperforms non-enhanced and description-only\nenhanced LLMs, and has a higher degree of adaptability than task-specific\nmodels. Furthermore, we conduct an error analysis and discuss the impact of the\nleveraged KG's semantic expressivity on the ED performance.",

To address this, we present FormalMATH, a large-scale Lean4 benchmark\ncomprising 5,560 formally verified problems spanning from high-school Olympiad\nchallenges to undergraduate-level theorems across diverse domains (e.g.,\nalgebra, applied mathematics, calculus, number theory, and discrete\nmathematics). To mitigate the inefficiency of manual formalization, we\nintroduce a novel human-in-the-loop autoformalization pipeline that integrates:\n(1) specialized large language models (LLMs) for statement autoformalization,\n(2) multi-LLM semantic verification, and (3) negation-based disproof filtering\nstrategies using off-the-shelf LLM-based provers. This approach reduces expert\nannotation costs by retaining 72.09% of statements before manual verification\nwhile ensuring fidelity to the original natural-language problems. Our\nevaluation of state-of-the-art LLM-based theorem provers reveals significant\nlimitations: even the strongest models achieve only 16.46% success rate under\npractical sampling budgets, exhibiting pronounced domain bias (e.g., excelling\nin algebra but failing in calculus) and over-reliance on simplified automation\ntactics. Notably, we identify a counterintuitive inverse relationship between\nnatural-language solution guidance and proof success in chain-of-thought\nreasoning scenarios, suggesting that human-written informal reasoning\nintroduces noise rather than clarity in the formal reasoning settings. We\nbelieve that FormalMATH provides a robust benchmark for benchmarking formal\nmathematical reasoning.",

This process plays a crucial role in the\nenergy release during solar transient events, which are often associated with\nelectric current sheets (CSs). The CSs can often disintegrate through the\ndevelopment of the tearing instability, which may lead to the formation of\nplasmoids in the non-linear phase of evolution. However, the complexity of the\ndynamics, and the magnetic and thermodynamic evolution due to the coalescence\nof the plasmoids are not fully understood. We used a resistive\nmagnetohydrodynamic simulation of a 2.5D current layer embedded in a stratified\nmedium in the solar corona, incorporating field-aligned thermal conduction.\nMultiple levels of adaptive mesh-refined grids are used to resolve the fine\nstructures that result during the evolution of the system. The instability in\nthe CS is triggered by imposing impulsive velocity perturbations concentrated\nat three different locations in the upper half along the CS plane; this leads\nto the formation of plasmoids and their later coalescence. We demonstrate that\na transition from purely 2D reconnection to 2D reconnection with guide field\ntakes place at the interface between the plasmoids as the latter evolve from\nthe pre-merger to the merged state. The small-scale, short-lived, and\ncollimated outflows during the merging process share various physical\nproperties with the recently discovered nanojets. The subsequent thermodynamic\nchange within and outside the merged plasmoid region is governed by the\ncombined effect of Ohmic heating, thermal conduction, and expansion/contraction\nof the plasma. Our results imply that impulsive perturbations in coronal CSs\ncan be the triggering agents for plasmoid coalescence, which leads to the\nsubsequent magnetic, and thermodynamic change in and around the CS.",

Because STs can sustain H-mode in first ballooning\nstability, first-stable pedestals with lower gradients may be further from the\npeeling-ballooning-mode boundary and therefore naturally free of Type 1 ELMs.\nWe show that while higher squareness destabilizes ballooning modes in first\nstability, the ELM stability boundary is essentially unchanged.

However, the relative importance of\nthese sources and the efficiency by which ionising photons escape into the IGM\nremain poorly understood. Most reionisation modelling frameworks assume\nidealised, isotropic emissions. We investigate this assumption by examining a\nsuite of simulations incorporating directed, anisotropic photon emissions. We\nfind that such anisotropic emissions of ionising photons yield a different\nreionisation geometry compared to the standard, isotropic, case. During the\nearly stages of reionisation (when less than 30 per cent of the Universe is\nionised), simulations with narrow photon leakage channels produce smaller\nionised bubbles on average. However, these bubbles grow to similar sizes during\nthe middle stages of reionisation. This anisotropy not only produces a\ndistinctive evolution of the size distribution of the ionised regions, but also\nimprints a feature onto the spherically averaged power spectra of the 21-cm\nsignal throughout reionisation. We observe a suppression in power by about\n10-40 per cent at scales corresponding to wavenumbers $k = 0.1-1 \\, h \\,\n\\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, corresponding to the range in which current radio\ninterferometers are most likely to measure the power spectrum. The simulation\nwith the narrowest channel of ionisation emission shows the strongest\nsuppression.

It is shown that high-Z doped targets exhibit more severe feedout\nseeds, because of their higher ionization compared to undoped targets.

But for long-wavelength perturbations, this suppression weakens,\nresulting in an increased instability in the high-Z doped targets.

When these agents operate independently for extended periods without\nhuman oversight, even initially well-specified goals may gradually shift.\nDetecting and measuring goal drift - an agent's tendency to deviate from its\noriginal objective over time - presents significant challenges, as goals can\nshift gradually, causing only subtle behavioral changes. This paper proposes a\nnovel approach to analyzing goal drift in LM agents. In our experiments, agents\nare first explicitly given a goal through their system prompt, then exposed to\ncompeting objectives through environmental pressures. We demonstrate that while\nthe best-performing agent (a scaffolded version of Claude 3.5 Sonnet) maintains\nnearly perfect goal adherence for more than 100,000 tokens in our most\ndifficult evaluation setting, all evaluated models exhibit some degree of goal\ndrift.

We triggered\nextensive Swift-XRT and NICER monitoring campaigns on the best SMBHB candidates\nto confirm or discard their tentative periodicities. Optical spectroscopic\nobservations confirmed the nuclear and extragalactic nature of 15/16 objects\nand enabled single-epoch SMBH mass measurements and BPT classifications. Our\nmost promising candidate, eRASSt J0530-4125, shows X-ray quasi-periodic\nvariability with a typical time scale of one year in the observed frame. By\nstacking the X-ray observations of each source in our sample, we find that\n14/15 sources can be modeled by a power law with a photon index ranging from\n$\\Gamma\\sim1.8-2.8$. Based on our selection, we estimate an optimistic upper\nlimit on the fraction of SMBHB candidates to be $\\sim 0.05$ per galaxy. We\nemphasize that further observational evidence is needed to confirm the SMBHB\nnature of our sources.",

    "abstract": "A voice AI agent that blends seamlessly into daily life would interact with\nhumans in an autonomous, real-time, and emotionally expressive manner. Rather\nthan merely reacting to commands, it would continuously listen, reason, and\nrespond proactively, fostering fluid, dynamic, and emotionally resonant\ninteractions. We introduce Voila, a family of large voice-language foundation\nmodels that make a step towards this vision. Voila moves beyond traditional\npipeline systems by adopting a new end-to-end architecture that enables\nfull-duplex, low-latency conversations while preserving rich vocal nuances such\nas tone, rhythm, and emotion. It achieves a response latency of just 195\nmilliseconds, surpassing the average human response time. Its hierarchical\nmulti-scale Transformer integrates the reasoning capabilities of large language\nmodels (LLMs) with powerful acoustic modeling, enabling natural, persona-aware\nvoice generation -- where users can simply write text instructions to define\nthe speaker's identity, tone, and other characteristics. Moreover, Voila\nsupports over one million pre-built voices and efficient customization of new\nones from brief audio samples as short as 10 seconds. Beyond spoken dialogue,\nVoila is designed as a unified model for a wide range of voice-based\napplications, including automatic speech recognition (ASR), Text-to-Speech\n(TTS), and, with minimal adaptation, multilingual speech translation. Voila is\nfully open-sourced to support open research and accelerate progress toward\nnext-generation human-machine interactions.",

    "abstract": "Monocular depth estimation can be broadly categorized into two directions:\nrelative depth estimation, which predicts normalized or inverse depth without\nabsolute scale, and metric depth estimation, which aims to recover depth with\nreal-world scale. While relative methods are flexible and data-efficient, their\nlack of metric scale limits their utility in downstream tasks. A promising\nsolution is to infer absolute scale from textual descriptions. However, such\nlanguage-based recovery is highly sensitive to natural language ambiguity, as\nthe same image may be described differently across perspectives and styles. To\naddress this, we introduce VGLD (Visually-Guided Linguistic Disambiguation), a\nframework that incorporates high-level visual semantics to resolve ambiguity in\ntextual inputs. By jointly encoding both image and text, VGLD predicts a set of\nglobal linear transformation parameters that align relative depth maps with\nmetric scale. This visually grounded disambiguation improves the stability and\naccuracy of scale estimation. We evaluate VGLD on representative models,\nincluding MiDaS and DepthAnything, using standard indoor (NYUv2) and outdoor\n(KITTI) benchmarks. Results show that VGLD significantly mitigates scale\nestimation bias caused by inconsistent or ambiguous language, achieving robust\nand accurate metric predictions. Moreover, when trained on multiple datasets,\nVGLD functions as a universal and lightweight alignment module, maintaining\nstrong performance even in zero-shot settings.

    "abstract": "The macroscopic phenomenon of filtration is the separation between suspended\nand liquid phases and it takes place in natural environments (e.g. groundwater,\nsoil, hyporheic zone) and industrial systems (e.g. filtration plants,\npharmaceutical industry, hospital care). Porous materials represent excellent\nfilters since they are characterized by a large solid surface to which flowing\nparticles can attach and be retained. Colloidal filtration by porous media is\ngoverned by a complex interplay between transport dynamics through intricate\npore structures and surface-mediated retention. Yet, classical approaches fail\nto capture key properties (such as filter spatial heterogeneity) and\nexperimental observations--e.g. non-exponential deposition profiles. A key\nlimitation of such approaches lies in the assumption that particle attachment\nto solid surfaces occurs at a constant rate over a given length scale,\nneglecting the intrinsic heterogeneity of the medium, i.e. pore size\nvariability. Here, we develop a multiscale microfluidic model system to\ndirectly observe colloidal transport and deposition over more than three orders\nof magnitude in length--from tens of microns to a meter--within a porous\narchitecture with controlled heterogeneity. By tracking individual colloidal\nparticles within the pores, we reveal intermittent dynamics along each\ntrajectory: particles alternate between long-range \"flights\" through pore\nchannels and short-range localized \"dives\" near grain surfaces. During the\ndives, attachment can occur at a constant rate, but the distributed flight\nsizes, during which attachment cannot occur, produce anomalous filtration. This\nis quantified by deposition profiles and breakthrough curves. A stochastic\nmodel based on a continuous time random walk (CTRW), constrained by\nexperimental data, captures this behavior and links pore structure with\nmacroscopic filtration.",

We adopt the sample-wise backpropagation scheme proposed in\n\\cite{Hui1} to solve the SOC problem under the strong convexity assumption.\nImportantly, in the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) procedure, we use batch\nsamples with higher order scheme in the forward SDE to improve the convergence\nrate in \\cite{Hui1} from $\\sim \\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{\\frac{N}{K} + \\frac{1}{N}})$\nto $\\sim \\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{K} + \\frac{1}{N^2}})$ and note that the\nmain source of uncertainty originates from the scheme for the simulation of $Z$\nterm in the BSDE. In the meantime, we note the SGD procedure uses only the\nnecessary condition of the SMP, while the batch simulation of the approximating\nsolution of BSDEs allows one to obtain a more accurate estimate of the control\n$u$ that minimizes the Hamiltonian. We then propose a damped contraction\nalgorithm to solve the SOC problem whose proof of convergence for a special\ncase is attained under some appropriate assumption. We then show numerical\nresults to check the first order convergence rate of the projection algorithm\nand analyze the convergence behavior of the damped contraction algorithm.\nLastly, we briefly discuss how to incorporate the proposed scheme in solving\npractical problems especially when the Randomized Neural Networks are used. We\nnote that in this special case, the error backward propagation can be avoided\nand parameter update can be achieved via purely algebraic computation (vector\nalgebra) which will potentially improve the efficiency of the whole training\nprocedure.

We perform three-dimensional\nsimulations and show that for large magnetic Reynolds numbers there can be\nexponential growth of the comoving magnetic field with conformal time before\nthe decay of turbulence impedes further amplification. The collapse dynamics\nonly affects the nonlinear feedback from the Lorentz force, which diminishes\nmore rapidly for shorter collapse times, allowing nearly kinematic continued\ngrowth. We confirm that helical turbulence is more efficient in driving dynamo\naction than nonhelical turbulence, but this difference decreases for larger\ncollapse times. We also show that for nearly irrotational flows, dynamo\namplification is still possible, but it is always associated with a growth of\nvorticity -- even if it still remains very small. In nonmagnetic runs, the\ngrowth of vorticity is associated with viscosity and grows with the Mach\nnumber. In the presence of magnetic fields, vorticity emerges from the curl of\nthe Lorentz force.

Climatological forecasts based\non MJO/SPV-NAO relationships provide a purely statistical approach to\nextended-range GL activity forecasting, independent of NWP models. Notably, MJO\nconditioned climatological forecasts show clear signals when evaluated against\nobserved GL activity. Statistical-dynamical models, using neural networks that\ncombine historical atmospheric state data with NWP-derived weather regime\nmetrics improve weather regime activity forecasts across all regimes\nconsidered, achieving an absolute accuracy increase of 2.9% in forecasting the\ndominant weather regime compared to ECMWF. This is particularly beneficial to\nBlocking in the European domain, where NWP models often underperform.\nAtmospheric conditioned and neural network forecasts serve as valuable\ndecision-support tools alongside NWP models, enhancing the reliability of S2S\npredictions.",

    "abstract": "This study investigates, analytically and numerically, the role of an\nequatorially anti-symmetric lateral variation in heat flux at the outer\nboundary in polarity transitions in rapidly rotating dynamos. In an unstably\nstratified fluid, the frequencies of vertical and horizontal (lateral) buoyancy\ncomplement each other such that a polarity transition is induced by the\nboundary anti-symmetry through the suppression of the slow\nmagnetic-Archimedean-Coriolis (MAC) waves at relatively small vertical buoyant\nforcing. A dipole-dominated dynamo in the low-inertia limit transitions to\npolarity reversing and multipolar states in succession as the relative\nintensity of horizontal buoyancy is progressively increased for a fixed\nvertical buoyancy. In the same parameter space, an equatorially symmetric heat\nflux variation does not induce a polarity transition. A composite boundary\nheterogeneity consisting of comparable magnitudes of symmetric and\nanti-symmetric variations induces the polarity transition at a horizontal\nbuoyancy of the same order as that for the transition induced by a purely\nanti-symmetric variation. This makes the analysis relevant to Earth's core,\nwhich convects in response to a composite heat flux variation in the lowermost\nmantle. A heterogeneity with a dominant symmetric part inhibits polarity\ntransitions, likely producing long periods in Earth's history without\nreversals. The fact that compositional buoyancy is much stronger than thermal\nbuoyancy, together with the known order of magnitude of the peak field\nintensity in the inertia-free limit, indicates that the core can operate under\na large lower-mantle heat flux heterogeneity, of O(10) times the mean heat flux\nat the core--mantle boundary.",

The review breaks down methods into three categories:\n(1) test-time scaling dynamically adjusts computation based on task complexity\nvia search and sampling, dynamic verification; (2) reinforced learning refines\ndecision-making through iterative improvement leveraging policy networks,\nreward models, and self-evolution strategies; and (3) slow-thinking frameworks\n(e.g., long CoT, hierarchical processes) that structure problem-solving with\nmanageable steps. The survey highlights the challenges and further directions\nof this domain. Understanding and advancing the reasoning abilities of LLMs is\ncrucial for unlocking their full potential in real-world applications, from\nscientific discovery to decision support systems.",

Building on the success of\nGtG 1.0, which demonstrated the potential of Graph Neural Networks for grasp\ndetection but was limited by assumptions of complete, noise-free point clouds\nand 4-Dof grasping, GtG 2.0 employs a conventional Grasp Pose Generator to\nefficiently produce 7-Dof grasp candidates. Candidates are assessed with an\nensemble Graph Neural Network model which includes points within the gripper\njaws (inside points) and surrounding contextual points (outside points). This\nimproved representation boosts grasp detection performance over previous\nmethods using the same generator. GtG 2.0 shows up to a 35% improvement in\nAverage Precision on the GraspNet-1Billion benchmark compared to\nhypothesis-and-test and Graph Neural Network-based methods, ranking it among\nthe top three frameworks.

In the thermodynamic limit, the system is adiabatically driven in the\npresence of noise, from a paramagnetic phase with all spins down to one with\nall spins up. Our study examines the role of long-range interactions on the\ndefect density, its distribution, and spin correlations, comparing noisy and\nnoiseless scenarios. In the noiseless case, within the long-range regime, the\nsteady-state properties are primarily influenced by modes near the k = {\\pi}\nregion. However, in the presence of noise, the dominant contributions shift to\nthe modes near k = 0. This differs from the SR model, where previous studies\nhave shown that modes around k = {\\pi}/2 play a significant role under noisy\nconditions. In the absence of noise, defect density scales as $n\\propto\n\\tau_Q^{-1/2}$, implying scaling exponent independent of decay exponent.\nHowever, we find that decreasing the value of {\\alpha} (i.e., increasing the\nrange) enhances the defect density, whereas in the presence of noise, it is\nsuppressed. In the LR regime, two-point fermionic correlators initially exhibit\nGaussian decay, followed by quadratic suppression instead of power-law decay\nfor both noisy and noiseless scenarios. Meanwhile, spin correlators, expressed\nas a string of fermionic operators, undergo purely exponential decay with no\ncrossover behavior.

First, we analyze the geodesic motion of\nthe massive particle around the black holes.

We find that, for the first black hole,\nincreasing the quantum parameter $\\zeta$ leads to larger orbital radii and\nreduced angular momenta for both orbits.

We further investigate periodic orbits with a fixed energy for both\nblack holes, revealing that the parameter $\\zeta$ similarly affects the orbits,\nalthough its effect is negligible in the second black hole. Finally, we\ncalculate the gravitational waves emitted by the periodic orbits. The results\ndemonstrate that increasing $\\zeta$ leads to a significant phase delay for the\nfirst black hole, while only inducing a subtle phase advance for the second\none.

The quantity in the orthogonal direction Dpar provides a measure of the\nphysical matter density omega_m in the LCDM cosmology. The DR2 measurements of\nDpar remain consistent with Planck LCDM despite the substantial improvement in\ntheir accuracy compared to the earlier DR1 results. From the comparison of\nPlanck and DESI BAO measurements, we find no significant evidence in support of\nevolving dark energy.

This technique consists in multiple data binarizations\nwhich can advantageously replace a conventional Analog to Digital Conversion\n(ADC) that uses natural binary coding. Additionally, we jointly propose a\ncompact topology with light-weight grouped convolutions being trained thanks to\nblock pruning and Knowledge Distillation (KD), aiming at reducing furthermore\nthe model size so as its computational complexity. We show that GLT brings\nversatility to the BNN by intrinsically performing global tone mapping,\nenabling significant accuracy gains in practice (demonstrated by simulations on\nthe STL-10 and VWW datasets).

When multiple candidate models are considered, MA\ntechniques can be used to weight and combine them, often resulting in improved\npredictive accuracy and better estimation stability compared to model selection\n(MS) methods. In this paper, we address two challenges in combining least\nsquares estimators from both theoretical and practical perspectives. We first\nestablish several oracle inequalities for least squares MA via minimizing a\nMallows' $C_p$ criterion under an arbitrary candidate model set. Compared to\nexisting studies, these oracle inequalities yield faster excess risk and\ndirectly imply the asymptotic optimality of the resulting MA estimators under\nmilder conditions.

Specifically,\nwe analyze the nonconvex landscape of a quartic Burer-Monteiro factored\nleast-squares optimization problem. We develop a new analysis framework, taking\nadvantage of the semidefinite problem structure, to understand the properties\nof second-order critical points -- specifically, whether they (approximately)\nrecover the ground truth matrix. We show that it can be helpful to (mildly)\noverparametrize the problem, that is, to optimize over matrices of higher rank\nthan the ground truth. We then apply this framework to several well-studied\nproblem instances: in addition to recovering existing state-of-the-art phase\nretrieval landscape guarantees (without overparametrization), we show that\noverparametrizing by a factor at most logarithmic in the dimension allows\nrecovery with optimal statistical sample complexity and error for the problems\nof (1) phase retrieval with sub-Gaussian measurements and (2) more general\nsemidefinite matrix sensing with rank-1 Gaussian measurements. Previously, such\nstatistical results had been shown only for estimators based on semidefinite\nprogramming. More generally, our analysis is partially based on the powerful\nmethod of convex dual certificates, suggesting that it could be applied to a\nmuch wider class of problems.",

While much progress has been made and techniques\noriginating from different disciplines have been proposed, APR techniques\ngenerally suffer from the patch overfitting issue, i.e., the generated patches\nare not genuinely correct despite they pass the employed tests. To alleviate\nthis issue, many research efforts have been devoted for automated patch\ncorrectness assessment (APCA). In particular, with the emergence of large\nlanguage model (LLM) technology, researchers have employed LLM to assess the\npatch correctness and have obtained the state-of-the-art performance. The\nliterature on APCA has demonstrated the importance of capturing patch semantic\nand explicitly considering certain code attributes in predicting patch\ncorrectness. However, existing LLM-based methods typically treat code as token\nsequences and ignore the inherent formal structure for code, making it\ndifficult to capture the deep patch semantics. Moreover, these LLM-based\nmethods also do not explicitly account for enough code attributes. To overcome\nthese drawbacks, we in this paper design a novel patch graph representation\nnamed attributed patch semantic graph (APSG), which adequately captures the\npatch semantic and explicitly reflects important patch attributes. To\neffectively use graph information in APSG, we accordingly propose a new\nparameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method of LLMs named Graph-LoRA.\nExtensive evaluations have been conducted to evaluate our method, and the\nresults show that compared to the state-of-the-art methods, our method improves\naccuracy and F1 score by 2.3% to 6.6% and 1.8% to 6.1% respectively.",

Here we introduce, theoretically analyze, and\nexperimentally demonstrate single- and two-way protocols for distributed\nsensing combining several unique and desirable features: (i) a safety-threshold\nmechanism that allows the protocol to proceed in low-noise cases and\nquantifying the potential tampering with respect to the ideal estimation\nprocedure, effectively paving the way for wide-spread practical realizations;\n(ii) equivalence of entanglement-based and mutually-unbiased-bases-based\nformulations; (iii) robustness against collective attacks via a LOCC-de-Finetti\ntheorem, for the first time to our knowledge. Finally, we demonstrate our\nprotocols in a photonic-based implementation, observing that the possibility of\nguaranteeing a safety threshold may come at a significant price in terms of the\nestimation bias, potentially overestimating the effect of tampering in\npractical settings.",

Furthermore, the spectrum manifests vast variation as a function of the\nunderlying local structure, in conjunction with previous observations for\nspectra of liquids in the X-ray regime. We disentangle the complex\nstructure-spectrum relationship using a machine learning-based method known as\nthe emulator-based component analysis.

Among other structural characteristics,\nblueshifting of the S2 line occurs with fewer hydrogen bonds with the ethanol\nsolvent, and a contracted N-N bond within the C-N=N-C bridge.

    "abstract": "Traditional rebalancing methods in ride-hailing systems direct idle drivers\nto fixed destinations, overlooking the fact that ride allocations frequently\noccur while cruising. This destination-centric view fails to exploit the\npath-dependent nature of modern platforms, where real-time matching depends on\nthe entire trajectory rather than a static endpoint. We propose the Wise Goose\nChase (WGC) algorithm, an event-triggered, driver-specific path planning\nframework that anticipates future matching opportunities by forecasting\nspatio-temporal supply and demand dynamics. WGC uses a system of Retarded\nFunctional Differential Equations (RFDEs) to model the evolution of idle driver\ndensity and passenger queues at the road-segment level, incorporating both\nen-route matching and competition among drivers. Upon request, WGC computes\npersonalized cruising paths that minimize each driver's expected time to\nallocation. Monte Carlo simulations on synthetic urban networks show that WGC\nconsistently outperforms baseline strategies, highlighting the advantage of\npredictive, context-aware rebalancing in dynamic mobility systems.",

Furthermore, we assess the photostability, pH sensitivity, and\nthermal stability of the dyes, providing key insights into their potential for\nstable and efficient biomedical applications.

Unlike cloud\ncomputing, mobile edge networks offer limited and distributed computing\nresources. As a result, collaborative edge computing emerges as a promising\ntechnology that enhances edge networks' service capabilities by integrating\ncomputational resources across edge nodes. This paper investigates the task\nscheduling problem in collaborative edge computing for IIoT, aiming to optimize\ntask processing performance under long-term cost constraints. We propose an\nonline task scheduling algorithm to cope with the spatiotemporal non-uniformity\nof user request distribution in distributed edge networks. For the spatial\nnon-uniformity of user requests across different factories, we introduce a\ngraph model to guide optimal task scheduling decisions. For the time-varying\nnature of user request distribution and long-term cost constraints, we apply\nLyapunov optimization to decompose the long-term optimization problem into a\nseries of real-time subproblems that do not require prior knowledge of future\nsystem states. Given the NP-hard nature of the subproblems, we design a\nheuristic-based hierarchical optimization approach incorporating enhanced\ndiscrete particle swarm and harmonic search algorithms. Finally, an imitation\nlearning-based approach is devised to further accelerate the algorithm's\noperation, building upon the initial two algorithms.

Using radiative transfer modelling, we\ntested several empirical and physically based models to constrain the cause of\nthe enhanced water emission found in the beacon. The observations show an\nincreased emission in the beacon that cannot be reproduced only accounting for\nthe warmer temperatures. An additional source of water vapour is thus needed.\nWe find a factor (7.5$\\pm$1.6) increase in the water column in the beacon\ncompared to pre-storm conditions using empirical models. Combining our results\nwith a cloud formation model for July 2011, we evaluate the sublimation\ncontribution to 45-85% of the extra column derived from the water emission\nincrease in the beacon.

We propose an adaptive\ndouble-proximal, full-splitting algorithm with a moving center approach in the\nfinal subproblem, which addresses the challenge of evaluating compositions by\ndecoupling the linear operator from the nonsmooth component. We establish the\nsubsequential convergence of the generated sequence of iterates to an\napproximate stationary point and prove its global convergence under the\nKurdyka-\\L ojasiewicz property. We also discuss the tightness of the\nconvergence results and provide insights into the rationale for seeking an\napproximate KKT point. This is illustrated by constructing a counterexample\nshowing that the algorithm can diverge when seeking exact solutions. Finally,\nwe present a practical version of the algorithm that incorporates a nonmonotone\nline search, which significantly improves the convergence performance.",

In particular, we work with data in which\nonly the total count of units in a system at a given time point is observed,\nbut the underlying process of inflows, length of stay and outflows is not. The\nparticular data example looked at in this paper is the occupancy of intensive\ncare units (ICU) during the COVID-19 pandemic, where the aggregated numbers of\noccupied beds in ICUs on the district level (`Landkreis') are recorded, but not\nthe number of incoming and outgoing patients. The Skellam distribution allows\nus to infer the number of incoming and outgoing patients from the occupancy in\nthe ICUs. This paper goes a step beyond and approaches the question of whether\nwe can also estimate the average length of stay of ICU patients. Hence, the\ntask is to derive not only the number of incoming and outgoing units from a\ntotal net count but also to gain information on the duration time of patients\non ICUs.

With the progression from narrow AI to\nArtificial General Intelligence (AGI) and Superintelligence, fears about\ncontrol and existential risk have escalated. Here, we investigate whether\nembracing inevitable AI misalignment can be a contingent strategy to foster a\ndynamic ecosystem of competing agents as a viable path to steer them in more\nhuman-aligned trends and mitigate risks. We explore how misalignment may serve\nand should be promoted as a counterbalancing mechanism to team up with\nwhichever agents are most aligned to human interests, ensuring that no single\nsystem dominates destructively. The main premise of our contribution is that\nmisalignment is inevitable because full AI-human alignment is a mathematical\nimpossibility from Turing-complete systems, which we also offer as a proof in\nthis contribution, a feature then inherited to AGI and ASI systems. We\nintroduce a change-of-opinion attack test based on perturbation and\nintervention analysis to study how humans and agents may change or neutralise\nfriendly and unfriendly AIs through cooperation and competition. We show that\nopen models are more diverse and that most likely guardrails implemented in\nproprietary models are successful at controlling some of the agents' range of\nbehaviour with positive and negative consequences while closed systems are more\nsteerable and can also be used against proprietary AI systems.

The measurement\nof this branching ratio could provide essential new information about the\nflavor structure of the quark sector from the $s\\to d$ transition. The decay is\nbeing searched for in the KOTO experiment at J-PARC, which has obtained the\ncurrent best upper limit on the branching ratio of $2.2\\times 10^{-9}$; a\nsensitivity to branching ratios below $10^{-10}$ is achievable by the end of\nthe decade. A next-generation experiment at J-PARC, KOTO II, was proposed in\n2024 with 82 members worldwide, including significant contributions from\nEuropean members. The goal of KOTO II is to measure the\n$K_L\\to\\pi^0\\nu\\bar{\\nu}$ branching ratio with sensitivity below $10^{-12}$ in\nthe 2030s. Discovery of the decay with $5\\sigma$ significance is achievable at\nthe SM value of the branching ratio. An indication of new physics with a\nsignificance of 90% is possible if the observed branching ratio differs by 40%\nfrom the SM value. Another important goal of KOTO II is to measure the\nbranching ratio of the unobserved $K_L\\to \\pi^0e^+e^-$ decay, which can give an\ninput to flavor structures of new physics. Other rare $K_L$ decays and\nhidden-sector particles are also in the scope of the study.

Despite their respective successes, these\ntwo domains have evolved independently, leading to distinct architectural\nparadigms: While autoregressive-based architectures have dominated multimodal\nunderstanding, diffusion-based models have become the cornerstone of image\ngeneration. Recently, there has been growing interest in developing unified\nframeworks that integrate these tasks. The emergence of GPT-4o's new\ncapabilities exemplifies this trend, highlighting the potential for\nunification. However, the architectural differences between the two domains\npose significant challenges. To provide a clear overview of current efforts\ntoward unification, we present a comprehensive survey aimed at guiding future\nresearch. First, we introduce the foundational concepts and recent advancements\nin multimodal understanding and text-to-image generation models. Next, we\nreview existing unified models, categorizing them into three main architectural\nparadigms: diffusion-based, autoregressive-based, and hybrid approaches that\nfuse autoregressive and diffusion mechanisms. For each category, we analyze the\nstructural designs and innovations introduced by related works. Additionally,\nwe compile datasets and benchmarks tailored for unified models, offering\nresources for future exploration. Finally, we discuss the key challenges facing\nthis nascent field, including tokenization strategy, cross-modal attention, and\ndata. As this area is still in its early stages, we anticipate rapid\nadvancements and will regularly update this survey.

    "abstract": "We propose a locally adaptive non-hydrostatic model and apply it to wave\npropagation generated by a moving bottom. This model is based on the\nnon-hydrostatic extension of the shallow water equations (SWE) with a quadratic\npressure relation, which is suitable for weakly dispersive waves. The\napproximation is mathematically equivalent to the Green-Naghdi equations.\nApplied globally, the extension requires solving an elliptic system of\nequations in the whole domain at each time step. Therefore, we develop an\nadaptive model that reduces the application area of the extension and by that\nthe computational time. The elliptic problem is only solved in the area where\nthe dispersive effect might play a crucial role. To define the non-hydrostatic\narea, we investigate several potential criteria based on the hydrostatic SWE\nsolution. We validate and illustrate how our adaptive model works by first\napplying it to simulate a simple propagating solitary wave, where exact\nsolutions are known. Following that, we demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency\nof our approach in more complicated cases involving moving bottom-generated\nwaves, where measured laboratory data serve as reference solutions. The\nadaptive model yields similar accuracy as the global application of the\nnon-hydrostatic extension while reducing the computational time by more than\n50%.",

This phenomenon is an enhanced version of\nthe optical process of frustrated total reflection between dielectrics\nanalogous to quantum tunnelling effect.

However, due to the frequency dependency of both the device\nlatencies and the acoustic hearing ear, current frequency-independent latency\nadjustments cannot fully compensate for the differences, leaving open which\nlatency adjustment is best. We therefore measured the localization performance\nof eleven bimodal cochlear implant users for multiple cochlear implant\nlatencies. We confirm previous studies that adjusting the interaural latency\nimproves localization in all eleven bimodal cochlear implant users. However,\nthe latency that leads to the best localization performance for most subjects\nwas not at the latency calculated to compensate for the interaural difference\nat intermediate frequencies (1 kHz).

By decomposing it into two subproblems, we\ndevelop an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)-based distributed\nalgorithm. It alternatively solves a sensing accuracy maximization subproblem\nat each device and employs a closed-form computation resource allocation\nstrategy at the edge server till convergence.

    "abstract": "Hamiltonian quantum simulation of bosons on digital quantum computers\nrequires truncating the Hilbert space to finite dimensions. The method of\ntruncation and the choice of basis states can significantly impact the\ncomplexity of the quantum circuit required to simulate the system. For example,\na truncation in the Fock basis where each boson is encoded with a register of\n$Q$ qubits, can result in an exponentially large number of Pauli strings\nrequired to decompose the truncated Hamiltonian. This, in turn, can lead to an\nexponential increase in $Q$ in the complexity of the quantum circuit. For\nlattice quantum field theories such as Yang-Mills theory and QCD, several\nHamiltonian formulations and corresponding truncations have been put forward in\nrecent years. There is no exponential increase in $Q$ when resorting to the\norbifold lattice Hamiltonian, while we do not know how to remove the\nexponential complexity in $Q$ in the commonly used Kogut-Susskind Hamiltonian.\nSpecifically, when using the orbifold lattice Hamiltonian, the continuum limit,\nor, in other words, the removal of the ultraviolet energy cutoff, is obtained\nwith circuits whose resources scale like $Q$, while they scale like\n$\\mathcal{O}(\\exp(Q))$ for the Kogut-Susskind Hamiltonian: this can be seen as\nan exponential speed up in approaching the physical continuum limit for the\norbifold lattice Hamiltonian formulation. We show that the universal framework,\nadvocated by three of the authors (M.~H., S.~M., and E.~R.) and collaborators\nprovides a natural avenue to solve the exponential scaling of circuit\ncomplexity with $Q$, and it is the reason why using the orbifold lattice\nHamiltonian is advantageous. We also point out that Hamiltonian formulations\nbased on a gauge-invariant Hilbert space require an exponential increase in the\nresource requirement with respect to using an extended Hilbert space.",

Existing methods often adopt self-training with\nclustering-generated pseudo-labels but implicitly assume these labels are\nalways correct. In practice, however, this assumption fails due to inevitable\npseudo-label noise, which hinders model learning. To address this, we introduce\na new learning paradigm that explicitly considers Pseudo-Label Noise (PLN),\ncharacterized by three key challenges: noise overfitting, error accumulation,\nand noisy cluster correspondence. To this end, we propose a novel Robust\nDuality Learning framework (RoDE) for UVI-ReID to mitigate the effects of noisy\npseudo-labels. First, to combat noise overfitting, a Robust Adaptive Learning\nmechanism (RAL) is proposed to dynamically emphasize clean samples while\ndown-weighting noisy ones. Second, to alleviate error accumulation-where the\nmodel reinforces its own mistakes-RoDE employs dual distinct models that are\nalternately trained using pseudo-labels from each other, encouraging diversity\nand preventing collapse. However, this dual-model strategy introduces\nmisalignment between clusters across models and modalities, creating noisy\ncluster correspondence. To resolve this, we introduce Cluster Consistency\nMatching (CCM), which aligns clusters across models and modalities by measuring\ncross-cluster similarity. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of RoDE.",

As each newly produced token is appended to the partial\noutput sequence, the length grows and so does the memory and compute load, due\nto the expanding key-value caches, which store intermediate representations of\nall previously generated tokens in the multi-head attention (MHA) layer. As\nthis iterative process steadily increases memory and compute demands,\nlayer-based partitioning in resource-constrained edge environments often\nresults in memory overload or high inference latency. To address this and\nreduce inference latency, we propose a resource-aware Transformer architecture\npartitioning algorithm, where the partitioning decision is updated at regular\nintervals during token generation. The approach is myopic in that it is based\non instantaneous information about device resource availability and network\nlink bandwidths. When first executed, the algorithm places blocks on devices,\nand in later executions, it migrates these blocks among devices so that the sum\nof migration delay and inference delay remains low. Our approach partitions the\ndecoder at the attention head level, co-locating each attention head with its\nkey-value cache and allowing dynamic migrations whenever resources become\ntight. By allocating different attention heads to different devices, we exploit\nparallel execution of attention heads and thus achieve substantial reductions\nin inference delays. Our experiments show that in small-scale settings (3-5\ndevices), the proposed method achieves within 15 to 20 percent of an exact\noptimal solver's latency, while in larger-scale tests it achieves notable\nimprovements in inference speed and memory usage compared to state-of-the-art\nlayer-based partitioning approaches.",

The unresolved scale (also known as the sub-grid\nscale) is modeled by choosing it proportional to the component of the residual\northogonal to the finite element space, leading to the orthogonal sub-grid\nscale (OSGS) method.

    "abstract": "Cancer survival prediction using multi-modal medical imaging presents a\ncritical challenge in oncology, mainly due to the vulnerability of deep\nlearning models to noise and protocol variations across imaging centers.\nCurrent approaches struggle to extract consistent features from heterogeneous\nCT and PET images, limiting their clinical applicability. We address these\nchallenges by introducing RobSurv, a robust deep-learning framework that\nleverages vector quantization for resilient multi-modal feature learning. The\nkey innovation of our approach lies in its dual-path architecture: one path\nmaps continuous imaging features to learned discrete codebooks for\nnoise-resistant representation, while the parallel path preserves fine-grained\ndetails through continuous feature processing. This dual representation is\nintegrated through a novel patch-wise fusion mechanism that maintains local\nspatial relationships while capturing global context via Transformer-based\nprocessing. In extensive evaluations across three diverse datasets (HECKTOR,\nH\\&N1, and NSCLC Radiogenomics), RobSurv demonstrates superior performance,\nachieving concordance index of 0.771, 0.742, and 0.734 respectively -\nsignificantly outperforming existing methods. Most notably, our model maintains\nrobust performance even under severe noise conditions, with performance\ndegradation of only 3.8-4.5\\% compared to 8-12\\% in baseline methods. These\nresults, combined with strong generalization across different cancer types and\nimaging protocols, establish RobSurv as a promising solution for reliable\nclinical prognosis that can enhance treatment planning and patient care.",

Secondly, we systematically compare the methods\nof these studies in two directions, T2I generation and T2I editing, including\nthe encoders and the key technologies they use. In addition, we also compare\nthe performance of these researches side by side in terms of datasets,\nevaluation metrics, training resources, and inference speed. In addition to the\nfour foundation models, we survey other works on T2I, such as energy-based\nmodels and recent Mamba and multimodality. We also investigate the potential\nsocial impact of T2I and provide some solutions. Finally, we propose unique\ninsights of improving the performance of T2I models and possible future\ndevelopment directions.

Theoretical predictions suggest that only a small\nsubclass of very young SNRs evolving in dense environments could potentially\nsatisfy the necessary conditions to accelerate particles to PeV energies. Most\nsuch theoretical investigations are carried out either in the standard\ninterstellar medium or in the wind of the progenitor. Since most core collapse\nsupernovae occur in star clusters, it is important to extend such investigation\nto SNRs taking place in a star cluster. In this work we focus on a SNR shock\npropagating in the collective wind of a compact star cluster, and we study the\nacceleration process as a function time, with special emphasis on the maximum\nenergy of accelerated particles. Using both analytic and numerical approaches\nwe investigate the spectrum of accelerated particles and maximum achievable\nenergy in the case of pre-existing turbulence in the collective wind and\nself-generated magnetic perturbations.

We tackle the challenge\nof opaque build pipelines that disconnect the trust between source code, which\ncan be understood and audited, and the final binary artifact, which is\ndifficult to inspect. Our system uses modern trusted execution environments\n(TEEs) and sandboxed build containers to provide strong guarantees that a given\nartifact was correctly built from a specific source code snapshot. As such it\ncomplements existing approaches like reproducible builds which typically\nrequire time-intensive modifications to existing build configurations and\ndependencies, and require independent parties to continuously build and verify\nartifacts. In comparison, an attestable build requires only minimal changes to\nan existing project, and offers nearly instantaneous verification of the\ncorrespondence between a given binary and the source code and build pipeline\nused to construct it. We evaluate it by building open-source software libraries\n- focusing on projects which are important to the trust chain and those which\nhave proven difficult to be built deterministically. Overall, the overhead (42\nseconds start-up latency and 14% increase in build duration) is small in\ncomparison to the overall build time.

Introducing a new type of linear shift in kinematic space\nwe demonstrate that the mysterious splitting formulae follow from a simple\ncontour integration argument in the style of on-shell recursion. The argument\nmakes use of only standard notions of tree-level factorization on propagators,\nbut assumes improved UV behavior in the form of the absence of a residue at\ninfinity. In the case of $\\text{Tr}\\phi^3$ and NLSM this is proven by\nidentifying our shift as a special case of a more general construction called a\n$g$-vector shift; in the case of YMS it remains an unproven conjecture. This\nrecursive perspective leads to numerous new results: we derive generalizations\nof the splitting formulae on more relaxed near-zero kinematics, including\ninteresting new kinematic limits in which the amplitude splits into a\ntriple-product; we also demonstrate that the uncolored special Galileon model\nhas improved UV scaling and hence also splits. We also investigate the possible\nrealization of hidden zeros in four dimensions. The conditions under which the\ndimensionality constraints are compatible with zero kinematics is investigated\nin detail for $\\text{Tr}\\phi^3$ and YMS; for the latter we find they can be\nrealized only with certain restrictions on external helicity states. The\nrealizable 4d zeros are proven by a similar recursive argument based on BCFW\nand is found to generalize to a new class of intrinsically 4d \"helicity zeros\"\npresent in all sectors of YM and also gravity.",

To\nfurther suppress the THz diffraction-field effects, a backpropagation SPI from\nnear field to far field is implemented by integrating with a THz physical\npropagation model into the output layer of the network.

In this\nwork, we review recent advancements in AI-driven decoding algorithms and\nenergy-efficient System-on-Chip (SoC) platforms for next-generation\nminiaturized neural devices. These innovations highlight the potential for\ndeveloping intelligent neural interfaces, addressing critical challenges in\nscalability, reliability, interpretability, and user adaptability.",

Through experimentation,\nwe discovered a counterintuitive phenomenon.: features learned from a complete\nsource domain have superior generalization capabilities compared to those\nlearned directly from the target domain. This insight leads us to propose the\nFederated Source Domain Awareness Framework (FedSDAF), the first systematic\napproach to enhance FedDG by leveraging source domain-aware features. FedSDAF\nemploys a dual-adapter architecture that decouples \"local expertise\" from\n\"global generalization consensus\". A Domain-Aware Adapter, retained locally,\nextracts and protects the unique discriminative knowledge of each source\ndomain, while a Domain-Invariant Adapter, shared across clients, builds a\nrobust global consensus. To enable knowledge exchange, we introduce a\nBidirectional Knowledge Distillation mechanism that facilitates efficient\ndialogue between the adapters. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets\n(OfficeHome, PACS, VLCS, DomainNet) show that FedSDAF significantly outperforms\nexisting FedDG methods.The source code is available at\nhttps://github.com/pizzareapers/FedSDAF.",

Different DFT functionals, including\nB3LYP, BHandHLYP, PBE0, B3PW91 and KT3 have been employed. Furthermore,\ndifferent active spaces were evaluated to optimize MCSCF. To establish the\naccuracy of the methods the computed rotational g-factors were compared to\nexperimental values. The benchmark study of CO and CS shows that the MCSCF\nmethod provides most reliable results and that the aug-cc-pCV5Z basis set is\nthe most sufficient. The aug-cc-pCVQZ basis set for Li and aug-cc-pV5Z basis\nset for H gave best results for LiH. The active spaces tested for CO and CS do\nnot yet converge towards the experimental values when more determinants were\nincluded.

In this paper, we investigate a $p$-adic analogue of this efficient\nFFT. A naive application of this idea--such as invoking well-known algorithms\nlike the Cantor-Zassenhaus algorithm or Hensel's lemma for polynomials to\ncompute roots of unity--would incur a cost quadratic in the degree of the input\npolynomial. This would eliminate the computational advantage of using FFT in\nthe first place. We present a method for computing roots of unity with lower\ncomplexity than the FFT computation itself.

However, when the data distribution consists of n points,\nempirical diffusion models tend to reproduce existing data points, a phenomenon\nknown as the memorization effect. Current literature often addresses this with\ncomplex machine learning techniques. This work shows that the memorization\nissue can be solved simply by applying an inertia update at the end of the\nempirical diffusion simulation. Our inertial diffusion model requires only the\nempirical score function and no additional training. We demonstrate that the\ndistribution of samples from this model approximates the true data distribution\non a $C^2$ manifold of dimension $d$, within a Wasserstein-1 distance of order\n$O(n^{-\\frac{2}{d+4}})$. This bound significantly shrinks the Wasserstein\ndistance between the population and empirical distributions, confirming that\nthe inertial diffusion model produces new and diverse samples. Remarkably, this\nestimate is independent of the ambient space dimension, as no further training\nis needed. Our analysis shows that the inertial diffusion samples resemble\nGaussian kernel density estimations on the manifold, revealing a novel\nconnection between diffusion models and manifold learning.",

While a few recent methods tackle this\nproblem, they do not rely on local correspondences which, according to the BOP\nChallenge, are currently the most effective way to estimate a single 6DoF pose\nsolution. Using correspondences to estimate a pose distribution is not\nstraightforward, since ambiguous correspondences induced by visual ambiguities\ndrastically decrease the performance of PnP. With Corr2Distrib, we turn these\nambiguities into an advantage to recover all valid poses. Corr2Distrib first\nlearns a symmetry-aware representation for each 3D point on the object's\nsurface, characterized by a descriptor and a local frame. This representation\nenables the generation of 3DoF rotation hypotheses from single 2D-3D\ncorrespondences. Next, we refine these hypotheses into a 6DoF pose distribution\nusing PnP and pose scoring. Our experimental evaluations on complex\nnon-synthetic scenes show that Corr2Distrib outperforms state-of-the-art\nsolutions for both pose distribution estimation and single pose estimation from\nan RGB image, demonstrating the potential of correspondences-based approaches.",

    "abstract": "As the automotive industry shifts its focus toward software-defined vehicles,\nthe need for faster and reliable software development continues to grow.\nHowever, traditional methods show their limitations. The rise of Generative\nArtificial Intelligence (GenAI), particularly Large Language Models (LLMs),\nintroduces new opportunities to automate automotive software development tasks\nsuch as requirement analysis and code generation. However, due to the\ncomplexity of automotive systems, where software components must interact with\neach other seamlessly, challenges remain in software integration and\nsystem-level validation. In this paper, we propose to combine GenAI with\nmodel-driven engineering to automate automotive software development. Our\napproach uses LLMs to convert free-text requirements into event chain\ndescriptions and to generate platform-independent software components that\nrealize the required functionality. At the same time, formal models are created\nbased on event chain descriptions to support system validation and the\ngeneration of integration code for integrating generated software components in\nthe whole vehicle system through middleware. This approach increases\ndevelopment automation while enabling formal analysis to improve system\nreliability. As a proof of concept, we used GPT-4o to implement our method and\ntested it in the CARLA simulation environment with ROS2 middleware.

Although existing methods for cryptomining detection report high\naccuracy and low overhead, they are often susceptible to various forms of\nobfuscation, and due to the limited variety of cryptomining scripts in the\nwild, standard code obfuscation methods present a natural and appealing\nsolution to avoid detection.

Data-flow\ngraphs offer detailed structural insights into a program's computations, making\nthem suitable for characterizing proof-of-work algorithms, but they can be\ndifficult to analyze due to their large size and susceptibility to noise and\nfragmentation under obfuscation.

Despite their widespread adoption, limited attention has\nbeen given to the uncertainty inherent in the feedback used to train these\nsystems. Both implicit and explicit feedback are prone to noise due to the\nvariability in human interactions, with implicit feedback being particularly\nchallenging. In collaborative filtering, the reliability of interaction signals\nis critical, as these signals determine user and item similarities. Thus,\nderiving accurate confidence measures from implicit feedback is essential for\nensuring the reliability of these signals.\n  A common assumption in academia and industry is that repeated interactions\nindicate stronger user interest, increasing confidence in preference estimates.\nHowever, in domains such as music streaming, repeated consumption can shift\nuser preferences over time due to factors like satiation and exposure. While\nliterature on repeated consumption acknowledges these dynamics, they are often\noverlooked when deriving confidence scores for implicit feedback.\n  This paper addresses this gap by focusing on music streaming, where repeated\ninteractions are frequent and quantifiable. We analyze how repetition patterns\nintersect with key factors influencing user interest and develop methods to\nquantify the associated uncertainty. These uncertainty measures are then\nintegrated as consistency metrics in a recommendation task. Our empirical\nresults show that incorporating uncertainty into user preference models yields\nmore accurate and relevant recommendations. Key contributions include a\ncomprehensive analysis of uncertainty in repeated consumption patterns, the\nrelease of a novel dataset, and a Bayesian model for implicit listening\nfeedback.",

    "abstract": "Multimodal Continual Instruction Tuning (MCIT) aims to enable Multimodal\nLarge Language Models (MLLMs) to incrementally learn new tasks without\ncatastrophic forgetting. In this paper, we explore forgetting in this context,\ncategorizing it into superficial forgetting and essential forgetting.\nSuperficial forgetting refers to cases where the model's knowledge may not be\ngenuinely lost, but its responses to previous tasks deviate from expected\nformats due to the influence of subsequent tasks' answer styles, making the\nresults unusable. By contrast, essential forgetting refers to situations where\nthe model provides correctly formatted but factually inaccurate answers,\nindicating a true loss of knowledge. Assessing essential forgetting\nnecessitates addressing superficial forgetting first, as severe superficial\nforgetting can obscure the model's knowledge state. Hence, we first introduce\nthe Answer Style Diversification (ASD) paradigm, which defines a standardized\nprocess for transforming data styles across different tasks, unifying their\ntraining sets into similarly diversified styles to prevent superficial\nforgetting caused by style shifts. Building on this, we propose RegLoRA to\nmitigate essential forgetting. RegLoRA stabilizes key parameters where prior\nknowledge is primarily stored by applying regularization, enabling the model to\nretain existing competencies. Experimental results demonstrate that our overall\nmethod, SEFE, achieves state-of-the-art performance.",

The objective of this article is to provide\nstate-of-the-art exact and hybrid solution methods that can provide\nhigh-quality solutions for instances of different sizes. This work presents a\ncomprehensive study of both an exact method, Branch and Price (B&P), as well as\na Large Neighborhood Search (LNS) framework which uses B&P or Column Generation\n(CG) for the repair phase to solve the BDSP. It further proposes and evaluates\na novel deeper integration of B&P and LNS, storing the generated columns from\nthe LNS subproblems and reusing them for other subproblems, or to find better\nglobal solutions. The article presents a detailed analysis of several\ncomponents of the solution methods and their impact, including general\nimprovements for the B&P subproblem, which is a high-dimensional Resource\nConstrained Shortest Path Problem (RCSPP), and the components of the LNS. The\nevaluation shows that our approach provides new state-of-the-art results for\ninstances of all sizes, including exact solutions for small instances, and low\ngaps to a known lower bound for mid-sized instances.

Reinforcement\nlearning (RL) has emerged as a promising solution; however, addressing such\nproblems requires the design of multiple reward functions to account for\nvarious constraints in robotic motion. Existing approaches typically sum all\nreward components indiscriminately to optimize the RL value function and\npolicy. We argue that this uniform inclusion of all reward components in policy\noptimization is inefficient and limits the robot's learning performance. To\naddress this, we propose an Automated Hybrid Reward Scheduling (AHRS) framework\nbased on Large Language Models (LLMs). This paradigm dynamically adjusts the\nlearning intensity of each reward component throughout the policy optimization\nprocess, enabling robots to acquire skills in a gradual and structured manner.\nSpecifically, we design a multi-branch value network, where each branch\ncorresponds to a distinct reward component. During policy optimization, each\nbranch is assigned a weight that reflects its importance, and these weights are\nautomatically computed based on rules designed by LLMs. The LLM generates a\nrule set in advance, derived from the task description, and during training, it\nselects a weight calculation rule from the library based on language prompts\nthat evaluate the performance of each branch. Experimental results demonstrate\nthat the AHRS method achieves an average 6.48% performance improvement across\nmultiple high-degree-of-freedom robotic tasks.",

In this paper, we present a novel dual-modal input based network\nfor under-screen fingerprint pose estimation. Our approach effectively\nintegrates two distinct yet complementary modalities: texture details extracted\nfrom ridge patches through the under-screen fingerprint sensor, and rough\ncontours derived from capacitive images obtained via the touch screen. This\ncollaborative integration endows our network with more comprehensive and\ndiscriminative information, substantially improving the accuracy and stability\nof pose estimation. A decoupled probability distribution prediction task is\ndesigned, instead of the traditional supervised forms of numerical regression\nor heatmap voting, to facilitate the training process. Additionally, we\nincorporate a Mixture of Experts (MoE) based feature fusion mechanism and a\nrelationship driven cross-domain knowledge transfer strategy to further\nstrengthen feature extraction and fusion capabilities. Extensive experiments\nare conducted on several public datasets and two private datasets.

Moreover, it was observed that the\norientation of LIPSS is either parallel or perpendicular to the laser\npolarization, depending on the excitation level. These features are similar to\nthe LIPSS formed on dielectrics, despite the considerably higher absorption and\nlarger extinction coefficient (~10-2) of polycarbonate at 258 nm. The\norientation and features of the patterns at different excitation levels are\nexplained using Sipe's theory, while the excitation and induced carrier\ndensities were quantified through the application of a theoretical physical\nmodel that describes ultrafast dynamics in polymers. Furthermore, observations\nrevealed that low excitation levels with linearly polarized enhance the\nuniformity of LIPSS, whereas irradiating PC targets with circularly polarized\nbeams leads to the formation of microscale topographies decorated with\nprotruding nanosphered-like structures, with their size varying based on the\nlaser conditions.

Moreover, there is an\ninteresting analogy to be drawn.

A key challenge\nis determining the optimal timing for integrating these\nmodalities-specifically, identifying the network layers where fusion modules\nshould be inserted. Current approaches often rely on manual tuning or\nexhaustive search, which are computationally expensive without any guarantee of\nconverging to optimal results. We propose a sequential forward search algorithm\nthat incrementally activates and evaluates candidate fusion modules at\ndifferent layers of a multimodal network. At each step, the algorithm retrains\nfrom previously learned weights and compares validation loss to identify the\nbest-performing configuration. This process systematically reduces the search\nspace, enabling efficient identification of the optimal fusion timing without\nexhaustively testing all possible module placements. The approach is validated\non two multimodal MRI datasets, each addressing different classification tasks.\nOur algorithm consistently identified configurations that outperformed unimodal\nbaselines, late fusion, and a brute-force ensemble of all potential fusion\nplacements. These architectures demonstrated superior accuracy, F-score, and\nspecificity while maintaining competitive or improved AUC values. Furthermore,\nthe sequential nature of the search significantly reduced computational\noverhead, making the optimization process more practical. By systematically\ndetermining the optimal timing to fuse imaging modalities, our method advances\nmultimodal deep learning for medical imaging. It provides an efficient and\nrobust framework for fusion optimization, paving the way for improved clinical\ndecision-making and more adaptable, scalable architectures in medical AI\napplications.",

Solvated ionic liquids of LiTFSI salt (lithium\nbis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)-amide) and glyme-based solvents are potential\nalternative candidates for commonly used electrolytes. We perform classical\nmolecular dynamics (MD) simulations study the effect of concentration and\ntemperature on the translational and rotational dynamics. The radial\ndistribution function shows stronger coordination of Li$^+$ ions with\ntetraglyme(G4), as shown in earlier studies, and forms a stable [Li(G4)]$^+$\ncation complex. The self-diffusion coefficients are lower than the values\nexperimentally observed but show better improvement over other classical force\nfields. An increase in the salt concentrations leads to a higher viscosity of\nthe system and reduces the overall ionic mobility of Li$^{+}$ ions. Diluting\nthe system with a larger number of glyme molecules leads to shorter rotational\nrelaxation times for both TFSI and tetraglyme. Ion-residence times show that\nLi$^+$ ions form stable and long-lasting complexes with G4 molecules than TFSI\nanions. The residence time of [Li(G4)]$^+$ complex increases at higher salt\nconcentrations due to the availability of fewer G4 molecules to coordinate with\na Li$^+$ ion. G4 is also seen to form polydentate complexes with Li$^+$ without\na shared coordination, allowing rotation without breaking coordination, unlike\nTFSI, which requires coordination disruption for rotation. This distinction\nexplains the poor correlation between rotation and residence time for G4 and\nthe strong correlation for TFSI.",

Through the classical Hirota's bilinear\nmethod, we obtain a fully non-degenerate $N$-soliton solution in Gram\ndeterminant form for this LSRI model. Depending on the choice of velocity\nconditions, the obtained non-degenerate fundamental soliton is classified into\ntwo types, namely ($1,1,1$)- and ($1,1,2$)-non-degenerate one solitons. We then\nshow that the basic ($1,1,1$)-non-degenerate soliton exhibits novel profile\nstructures, including a double-hump, a special flat-top, and a conventional\nsingle-hump profile, and ($1,1,2$)-non-degenerate soliton admits two-soliton\nlike oblique collision, a behavior akin to KP line soliton interaction with a\nshort stem structure. A detailed asymptotic analysis is carried out to study\nthe long time behavior of ($1,1,1$)-non-degenerate solitons and it reveals that\nthey undergo both shape-preserving and shape-changing collisions. However, our\nanalysis confirms that the shape changing collision between these solitons\nbecome elastic in nature after appropriate shift of time coordinates. Further,\nwe identified that the ($1,1,2$)-non-degenerate solitons also undergo elastic\ncollision. In addition, we have also investigated the formation or suppression\nof breathing phenomena during collision between a degenerate soliton and a\n($1,1,1$)-non-degenerate soliton. For completeness, we also point out the\ncollision scenario between the completely degenerate solitons.

Most of the known efficient codes are codes with\nsynchronization strings which allow one to reduce the problem of decoding\ninsertions and deletions to that of decoding substitution and erasures. Our new\napproach, presented in this paper, reduces the problem of decoding insertions\nand deletions to that of list recovery. Specifically, any \\((\\rho, 2\\rho n + 1,\nL)\\)-list-recoverable code is a \\((\\rho, L)\\)-list decodable insdel code. As an\nexample, we apply this technique to Reed-Solomon (RS) codes, which are known to\nhave efficient list-recovery algorithms up to the Johnson bound. In the\nadversarial insdel model, this provides efficient (list) decoding from \\(t\\)\ninsdel errors, assuming that \\(t\\cdot k = O(n)\\). This is the first efficient\ninsdel decoder for \\([n, k]\\) RS codes for \\(k>2\\). Additionally, we explore\nrandom insdel models, such as the Davey-MacKay channel, and show that for\ncertain choices of \\(\\rho\\), a \\((\\rho, n^{1/2+0.001}, L)\\)-list-recoverable\ncode of length \\(n\\) can, with high probability, efficiently list decode the\nchannel output, ensuring that the transmitted codeword is in the output list.\nIn the context of RS codes, this leads to a better rate-error tradeoff for\nthese channels compared to the adversarial case. We also adapt the\nKoetter-Vardy algorithm, a famous soft-decision list decoding technique for RS\ncodes, to correct insertions and deletions induced by the Davey-MacKay channel.",

Numerically, we conduct\nexperiments on graphs with 256 vertices, larger than the scales in former GBS\nexperiments as well as classical simulations. In particular, we show that both\nthe single-loop and double-loop Glauber dynamics improve the performance of\noriginal random search and simulated annealing algorithms for the max-Hafnian\nand densest $k$-subgraph problems up to 10x. Overall, our approach offers both\ntheoretical guarantees and practical advantages for classical simulations of\nGBS on graphs.",

This study focuses on the\nindoor localization of UE with a single access point (AP) aided by multiple\nRISs. First, we propose a two-stage channel estimation scheme where the phase\nshifts of RIS elements are tuned to obtain multiple channel soundings. In the\nfirst stage, the newtonized orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm extracts the\nparameters of multiple paths from the received signals. Then, the LOS path and\nRIS-reflected paths are identified. In the second stage, the estimated path\ngains of RIS-reflected paths with different phase shifts are utilized to\ndetermine the angle of arrival (AOA) at the RIS by obtaining the angular pseudo\nspectrum. Consequently, by taking the AP and RISs as reference points, the\nlinear least squares estimator can locate UE with the estimated AOAs.\nSimulation results show that the proposed algorithm can realize\ncentimeter-level localization accuracy in the discussed scenarios. Moreover,\nthe higher accuracy of pseudo spectrum, a larger number of channel soundings,\nand a larger number of reference points can realize higher localization\naccuracy of UE.",

The\nbubbles are detected and characterized using a method based on a grid\nsuperimposed on the liquid, efficient for bubbles larger than the grid mesh. We\nfirst investigate how the results are affected by the mesh choice, and show\nthat using several mesh values allows to detect bubbles in a wide range of\nsizes with minimal computing cost. The free-energy of formation of a bubble can\nthen be deduced for a large range of sizes, with particular emphasis in the\nregion of vanishing bubbles scarcely investigated in previous works. We first\nshow that the usual Boltzmann relation has to be modified when the bubble size\nis characterized by its volume. In particular, the bubble volume distribution\ndiverges for a vanishing bubble, which should be taken into account before\ncalculating its free-energy of formation from the above formula. An analytical\nexpansion, valid for any interacting spherical molecules, confirms this\nobservation. We then show that the capillarity approximation fails for small\nbubbles: an extra contribution, linear with the bubble radius, has to be added\nto the usual quadratic (surface) and cubic (volume) contributions to the\nfree-energy. This extra term most probably relates to the irregular shape of\nthe tiny bubbles.",

    "abstract": "A search for emerging jets is presented using 51.8 fb$^{-1}$ of proton-proton\ncollision data at $\\sqrt{s} = 13.6$ TeV, collected by the ATLAS experiment\nduring 2022 and 2023. The search explores a hypothetical dark sector featuring\n'dark quarks', which are charged under a confining gauge group and couple to\nthe Standard Model via a new mediator particle. These dark quarks undergo\nshowering and hadronization within the dark sector, forming long-lived dark\nmesons that decay back into Standard Model particles. This results in jets\nwhich contain multiple displaced vertices known as emerging jets. The analysis\ntargets events with pairs of emerging jets, produced either through a vector\nmediator, $Z'$, in the $s$-channel, or a scalar mediator, $\\Phi$, in the\n$t$-channel. No significant excess over the Standard Model background is\nobserved. Assuming a dark pion proper decay length between 5 and 50 mm, $Z'$\nmediator masses between 600 and 2550 GeV are excluded for quark and dark quark\ncoupling values of 0.01 and 0.1, respectively. For a quark-dark quark coupling\nof $0.1$, $\\Phi$ mediator masses between 600 and 1375 GeV are excluded. These\nresults provide the first direct constraints on emerging jet pair production\nvia a $Z'$ mediator, and represent the first search to investigate emerging jet\nproduction via $t$-channel exchange of a scalar mediator.",

Although glyceraldehyde\n(HOCH2CH(OH)C(O)H, GCA) has not yet been detected in the ISM, the presence of\nstructurally related compounds in various astronomical environments suggests\nthat it may form under interstellar conditions. In this study, we employed the\nautomated reaction discovery tool AutoMeKin to systematically explore the\ngas-phase chemical reaction networks (CRNs) of C3H6O3 (GCA), C3H7O3 (a\nhydrogenated analog), and C2H5O2.

Our analysis revealed several\nbarrierless pathways leading to GCA or to GCA and a leaving group. Notably, the\nreaction between glyoxal (HCOHCO) and the HOCHCH2OH radical, though neither has\nyet been detected in the ISM, was found to efficiently produce GCA and a formyl\nradical. However, aside from the aforementined exception, most GCA formation\nchannels result in highly vibrationally excited intermediates that are more\nlikely to undergo rapid unimolecular decomposition than to be stabilized by\nradiative emission under typical ISM conditions. These results suggest that\nwhile gas-phase GCA formation is chemically feasible, it is likely transient\nand difficult to detect directly.

However, the current performance falls short of these\nrequirements due to the inherent trade-off between memory efficiency\nenhancement and noise amplification, which not only imposes significant demands\non quantum purification but also fundamentally impedes continuous-variable\nquantum information processing. In this paper, we break through these\nconstraints, enabling high-performance quantum memory and unlocking new\npossibilities for quantum technologies.

SymbioticRAG introduces a\ntwo-tier solution where Level 1 enables direct human curation of retrieved\ncontent through interactive source document exploration, while Level 2 aims to\nbuild personalized retrieval models based on captured user interactions. We\nimplement Level 1 through three key components: (1)~a comprehensive document\nprocessing pipeline with specialized models for layout detection, OCR, and\nextraction of tables, formulas, and figures; (2)~an extensible retriever module\nsupporting multiple retrieval strategies; and (3)~an interactive interface that\nfacilitates both user engagement and interaction data logging. We experiment\nLevel 2 implementation via a retriever strategy incorporated LLM summarized\nuser intention from user interaction logs. To maintain high-quality data\npreparation, we develop a human-on-the-loop validation interface that improves\npipeline output while advancing research in specialized extraction tasks.\nEvaluation across three scenarios (literature review, geological exploration,\nand education) demonstrates significant improvements in retrieval relevance and\nuser satisfaction compared to traditional RAG approaches.

While diffusion models have\nachieved remarkable success in Text-to-X (e.g., vision and audio data)\ngeneration, their use in time series generation remains in its nascent stages.\nExisting approaches face two critical limitations: (1) the lack of systematic\nexploration of general-proposed time series captions, which are often\ndomain-specific and struggle with generalization; and (2) the inability to\ngenerate time series of arbitrary lengths, limiting their applicability to\nreal-world scenarios. In this work, we first categorize time series captions\ninto three levels: point-level, fragment-level, and instance-level.\nAdditionally, we introduce a new fragment-level dataset containing over 600,000\nhigh-resolution time series-text pairs. Second, we propose Text-to-Series\n(T2S), a diffusion-based framework that bridges the gap between natural\nlanguage and time series in a domain-agnostic manner. T2S employs a\nlength-adaptive variational autoencoder to encode time series of varying\nlengths into consistent latent embeddings. On top of that, T2S effectively\naligns textual representations with latent embeddings by utilizing Flow\nMatching and employing Diffusion Transformer as the denoiser. We train T2S in\nan interleaved paradigm across multiple lengths, allowing it to generate\nsequences of any desired length. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that T2S\nachieves state-of-the-art performance across 13 datasets spanning 12 domains.",

To address this issue, we propose a\nplug-and-play Token Coordinated Prompt Attention (TCPA) module, which assigns\nspecific coordinated prompts to different tokens for attention-based\ninteractions. Firstly, recognizing the distinct functions of CLS and image\ntokens-global information aggregation and local feature extraction, we\ndisentangle the prompts into CLS Prompts and Image Prompts, which interact\nexclusively with CLS tokens and image tokens through attention mechanisms. This\nenhances their respective discriminative abilities.

This enables more precise attention interactions,\nimproving the diversity and representational capacity of the extracted\nfeatures.

    "abstract": "Predicting financial time series presents significant challenges due to\ninherent low signal-to-noise ratios and intricate temporal patterns.\nTraditional machine learning models exhibit limitations in this forecasting\ntask constrained by their restricted model capacity. Recent advances in large\nlanguage models (LLMs), with their greatly expanded parameter spaces,\ndemonstrate promising potential for modeling complex dependencies in temporal\nsequences. However, existing LLM-based approaches typically focus on\nfixed-length patch analysis due to the Transformer architecture, ignoring\nmarket data's multi-scale pattern characteristics. In this study, we propose\n$LLM4FTS$, a novel framework that enhances LLM capabilities for temporal\nsequence modeling through learnable patch segmentation and dynamic wavelet\nconvolution modules. Specifically,we first employ K-means++ clustering based on\nDTW distance to identify scale-invariant patterns in market data. Building upon\npattern recognition results, we introduce adaptive patch segmentation that\npartitions temporal sequences while preserving maximal pattern integrity. To\naccommodate time-varying frequency characteristics, we devise a dynamic wavelet\nconvolution module that emulates discrete wavelet transformation with enhanced\nflexibility in capturing time-frequency features. These three modules work\ntogether to improve large language model's ability to handle scale-invariant\npatterns in financial time series. Extensive experiments on real-world\nfinancial datasets substantiate the framework's efficacy, demonstrating\nsuperior performance in capturing complex market patterns and achieving\nstate-of-the-art results in stock return prediction. The successful deployment\nin practical trading systems confirms its real-world applicability,\nrepresenting a significant advancement in LLM applications for financial\nforecasting.",

    "abstract": "Recently, there is a high demand for deploying DeepSeek-R1 and V3 locally,\npossibly because the official service often suffers from being busy and some\norganizations have data privacy concerns. While single-machine deployment\noffers infrastructure simplicity, the models' 671B FP8 parameter configuration\nexceeds the practical memory limits of a standard 8-GPU machine. Quantization\nis a widely used technique that helps reduce model memory consumption. However,\nit is unclear what the performance of DeepSeek-R1 and V3 will be after being\nquantized. This technical report presents the first quantitative evaluation of\nmulti-bitwidth quantization across the complete DeepSeek model spectrum. Key\nfindings reveal that 4-bit quantization maintains little performance\ndegradation versus FP8 while enabling single-machine deployment on standard\nNVIDIA GPU devices. We further propose DQ3_K_M, a dynamic 3-bit quantization\nmethod that significantly outperforms traditional Q3_K_M variant on various\nbenchmarks, which is also comparable with 4-bit quantization (Q4_K_M) approach\nin most tasks. Moreover, DQ3_K_M supports single-machine deployment\nconfigurations for both NVIDIA H100/A100 and Huawei 910B. Our implementation of\nDQ3\\_K\\_M is released at https://github.com/UnicomAI/DeepSeek-Eval, containing\noptimized 3-bit quantized variants of both DeepSeek-R1 and DeepSeek-V3.",

This concept has been extensively studied,\nparticularly in the context of simplicial maps between orientable triangulable\nspaces. In 1982, Gromov proved that if degree $d$ maps exist from a genus $g$\norientable surface to a genus $h$ orientable surface for every $d \\in\n\\mathbb{Z}$, then $h$ must be 0 or 1.\n  Recently, degree $d$ self-maps on spheres, particularly on genus 0 surfaces,\nhave been investigated. In this paper, we focus on the unique minimal 7-vertex\ntriangulation of the torus. We construct simplicial degree $d$ maps from a\ntriangulation of a genus $g$ surface to the 7-vertex triangulation of the torus\nfor $g \\geq 1$. Our construction of degree $d$ maps is minimal for every $d$\nwhen $g = 1,2$. If $g \\geq 3$, then our construction remains minimal for $|d|\n\\geq 2g - 1$.\n  We believe that this concept will be highly useful in combinatorial topology,\nas it leads to several intriguing open problems.

They are currently understood through various\nmechanisms related to the interconversion of charge current and spin current,\ngiant magnetoresistance, thermal magnonic effects, thermoelectric effects, and\ndiverse spindependent scattering processes. This raises a fundamental question:\ndo the universal behaviors observed in a wide range of systems stem from\nunderlying general principles? We demonstrate here that both UAMR and UMR arise\nfrom electron transport influenced by the magnetization vector present in the\nmagnetic material and the interfacial potential inherent in heterostructures.\nSpecifically, UAMR represents current-independent resistance (resistivity) of\nbilayers. UMR is the resistance proportional to the current although electron\ntransports of the bilayers are the linear response to high current densities\nand their induced thermal gradients. Our theory introduces a novel approach\nthat considers the interplay between the magnetization vector, thermal\ngradients, and the effective internal electric field at the interface. This\nframework provides a unified explanation for both UMR and UAMR, effectively\ncapturing key experimental features such as dependence on current direction,\nmagnetization orientation, film thickness, and magnetic field strength.\nFurthermore, it offers a universal perspective that bridges UMR and UAMR\neffects, enhancing our understanding of spin-dependent transport phenomena in\nbilayers.",

Additionally, we curate a hierarchical genre\nclassification dataset that structures genres into a well-defined taxonomy,\naccommodating the diverse nature of literary works.

Recent efforts attempt to improve editing\nmodels through generating higher-quality edited images, pre-training on\nrecognition tasks, or introducing vision-language models (VLMs) but fail to\nresolve this fundamental issue. In this paper, we offer a novel solution by\nconstructing more effective editing instructions for given image pairs. This\nincludes rectifying the editing instructions to better align with the\noriginal-edited image pairs and using contrastive editing instructions to\nfurther enhance their effectiveness. Specifically, we find that editing models\nexhibit specific generation attributes at different inference steps,\nindependent of the text. Based on these prior attributes, we define a unified\nguide for VLMs to rectify editing instructions. However, there are some\nchallenging editing scenarios that cannot be resolved solely with rectified\ninstructions. To this end, we further construct contrastive supervision signals\nwith positive and negative instructions and introduce them into the model\ntraining using triplet loss, thereby further facilitating supervision\neffectiveness. Our method does not require the VLM modules or pre-training\ntasks used in previous work, offering a more direct and efficient way to\nprovide better supervision signals, and providing a novel, simple, and\neffective solution for instruction-based image editing. Results on multiple\nbenchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing\napproaches.

We propose Z-Score Filtered Sharpness-Aware Minimization, which\napplies Z-score based filtering to gradients in each layer. Instead of using\nall gradient components, a mask is constructed to retain only the top\npercentile with the largest absolute Z-scores. The percentile threshold $Q_p$\ndetermines how many components are kept, so that the ascent step focuses on\ndirections that stand out most compared to the average of the layer.

Guided by these findings, we introduce SIMPLEMIX, an approach\nto combine the complementary strengths of on-policy and off-policy preference\nlearning by simply mixing these two data sources. Our empirical results across\ndiverse tasks and benchmarks demonstrate that SIMPLEMIX substantially improves\nlanguage model alignment.

In this paper, we go beyond the topology classification\nscenario by also studying the use of machine learning to develop simple\nheuristic rules for classifying whether a material is a metal based on chemical\ncomposition.

    "abstract": "Point cloud surface representation is a fundamental problem in computer\ngraphics and vision. This paper presents a machine learning approach for\napproximating the signed distance function (SDF) of a point cloud using a\nsparse ellipsoidal radial basis function network, enabling a compact and\naccurate surface representation. Given the SDF values defined on the grid\npoints constructed from the point cloud, our method approximates the SDF\naccurately with as few ellipsoidal radial basis functions (ERBFs) as possible,\ni.e., represents the SDF of a point cloud by sparse ERBFs. To balance sparsity\nand approximation precision, a dynamic multi-objective optimization strategy is\nintroduced, which adaptively adds the regularization terms and jointly\noptimizes the weights, centers, shapes, and orientations of ERBFs. To improve\ncomputational efficiency, a nearest-neighbor-based data structure is employed,\nrestricting function calculations to points near each Gaussian kernel center.\nThe computations for each kernel are further parallelized on CUDA, which\nsignificantly improves the optimization speed. Additionally, a hierarchical\noctree-based refinement strategy is designed for training. Specifically, the\ninitialization and optimization of network parameters are conducted using\ncoarse grid points in the octree lattice structure. Subsequently, fine lattice\npoints are progressively incorporated to accelerate model convergence and\nenhance training efficiency. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark\ndatasets demonstrate that our method outperforms previous sparse representation\napproaches in terms of accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency.

Our study investigates how compilation impacts the\nperformance and energy consumption of Python code, using seven benchmarks\ncompiled with eight different tools: PyPy, Numba, Nuitka, Mypyc, Codon, Cython,\nPyston-lite, and the experimental Python 3.13 version, compared to CPython. The\nbenchmarks are single-threaded and executed on an NUC and a server, measuring\nenergy usage, execution time, memory usage, and Last-Level Cache (LLC) miss\nrates at a fixed frequency and on a single core. The results show that\ncompilation can significantly enhance execution time, energy and memory usage,\nwith Codon, PyPy, and Numba achieving over 90\\% speed and energy improvements.\nNuitka optimizes memory usage consistently on both testbeds. The impact of\ncompilation on LLC miss rate is not clear since it varies considerably across\nbenchmarks for each compiler.

Existing LLM watermarking methods, though effective on\nunaltered content, suffer significant performance drops when the text is\nmodified and could introduce biases that degrade LLM performance in downstream\ntasks. These methods fail to achieve an optimal tradeoff between text quality\nand robustness, particularly due to the lack of end-to-end optimization of the\nencoder and decoder.

However, AVER remains challenging due to the\ninherent ambiguity of emotional expressions, cross-modal expressive\ndisparities, and the scarcity of reliably annotated data. Recent\nself-supervised AVER approaches have introduced strong multimodal\nrepresentations, yet they predominantly rely on modality-specific encoders and\ncoarse content-level alignment, limiting fine-grained emotional semantic\nmodeling. To address these issues, we propose VAEmo, an efficient two-stage\nframework for emotion-centric joint VA representation learning with external\nknowledge injection. In Stage~1, a unified and lightweight representation\nnetwork is pre-trained on large-scale speaker-centric VA corpora via masked\nreconstruction and contrastive objectives, mitigating the modality gap and\nlearning expressive, complementary representations without emotion labels. In\nStage~2, multimodal large language models automatically generate detailed\naffective descriptions according to our well-designed chain-of-thought\nprompting for only a small subset of VA samples; these rich textual semantics\nare then injected by aligning their corresponding embeddings with VA\nrepresentations through dual-path contrastive learning, further bridging the\nemotion gap. Extensive experiments on multiple downstream AVER benchmarks show\nthat VAEmo achieves state-of-the-art performance with a compact design,\nhighlighting the benefit of unified cross-modal encoding and emotion-aware\nsemantic guidance for efficient, generalizable VA emotion representations.",

We then derive the closed-form first- and\nsecond-order Riemannian derivatives of the dynamics. Finally, this work applies\na line-search Riemannian Interior Point Method (RIPM) to perform trajectory\noptimization with general nonlinear constraints. As the optimization is\nperformed on matrix Lie groups, it is correct-by-construction to respect the\ntopological structure of the rotation group and be free of singularities. The\npaper demonstrates that both the derivative evaluations and Newton steps\nrequired to solve the RIPM exhibit linear complexity with respect to the\nplanning horizon and system degrees of freedom. Simulation results illustrate\nthat the proposed method is faster than conventional methods by an order of\nmagnitude in challenging robotics tasks.",

    "abstract": "Recent advancements have significantly enhanced the performance of large\nlanguage models (LLMs) in tackling complex reasoning tasks, achieving notable\nsuccess in domains like mathematical and logical reasoning. However, these\nmethods encounter challenges with complex planning tasks, primarily due to\nextended reasoning steps, diverse constraints, and the challenge of handling\nmultiple distinct sub-tasks. To address these challenges, we propose HyperTree\nPlanning (HTP), a novel reasoning paradigm that constructs hypertree-structured\nplanning outlines for effective planning. The hypertree structure enables LLMs\nto engage in hierarchical thinking by flexibly employing the divide-and-conquer\nstrategy, effectively breaking down intricate reasoning steps, accommodating\ndiverse constraints, and managing multiple distinct sub-tasks in a\nwell-organized manner. We further introduce an autonomous planning framework\nthat completes the planning process by iteratively refining and expanding the\nhypertree-structured planning outlines. Experiments demonstrate the\neffectiveness of HTP, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy on the TravelPlanner\nbenchmark with Gemini-1.5-Pro, resulting in a 3.6 times performance improvement\nover o1-preview.",

Furthermore,\nthe original theory requires compensation for errors from each term due to\ntruncation at low orders during the error estimation, which has limited its\napplication to other types of physics described by partial differential\nequations.\n  Here, we present a new method that can automatically derive numerical\noperators for arbitrary partial differential equations. These operators, which\ninvolve a small number of nodes in time and space (compact operators), are more\naccurate than conventional ones and do not require meshing. Our method\nevaluates the weak formulation of the equations of motion, developed with the\naid of Taylor expansions.\n  We establish the link between our new method and the classic optimally\naccurate operators, showing that they produce identical coefficients in\nhomogeneous media. Finally, we perform a benchmark test for the 1D Poisson\nproblem across various heterogeneous media. The benchmarks demonstrate the\nsuperiority of our method compared to conventional operators, even when using a\nset of linear B-spline test functions (three-point hat functions). However, the\nconvergence rate can depend on the wavelength of the material property: when\nthe material property has the same wavelength as that of the field, the\nconvergence rate is O(4), whereas it can be less efficient O(2) for other\nmodels.",

    "abstract": "Anomaly detection with multivariate Gaussian distribution, termed Gassian\nanomaly detection (GAD), is a prominent problem in data mining and machine\nlearning, in which all training data points of a given dataset are assumed to\nbe drawn from an unknown multivariate Gassian distribution and those points\nwith low probability density function values are deemed anomalies. Hence, the\ncentral task of GAD is to calculate the probability density function of a new\ndata point by retrieving its mean values and covariance matrix, which could be\ntime-consuming when addressing a large dataset. Recently, several quantum\nalgorithms have been proposed to for GAD, which have been shown significantly\nfaster than the classical counterparts under certain conditions. However, they\nall require quantum phase estimation as a key subroutine that may have\nexponentially high quantum circuit depth and is not desirable in the noisy\nintermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era. In this paper, we propose a new quantum\nalgorithm for GAD without phase estimation, whose quantum circuit has depth\nonly linear in the number of qubits, which is relatively more friendly on NISQ\ndevices. Specifically, building on arithmetic-free black-box quantum state\npreparation (AFBBQSP), our quantum algorithm outputs the estimates of the mean\nvalues and the covariance matrix both in the classical form, so that anomaly\ndetection of any data point can be done immediately on a classical computer at\nlittle cost. It is shown that our quantum algorithm is highly efficient when\nhandling low-dimensional datasets with well-conditioned data matrices.\nMoreover, unlike prior quantum algorithms for GAD which require the input data\nto be quantum, mean centered, or feature correlated, our quantum algorithm\nrelease these constraints and thus is more data practical. Our work highlights\nthe role of AFBBQSP in bringing quantum machine learning closer to reality.",

It is often a time-consuming and resource-intensive process, largely\nattributed to the huge amount of \"what-if\" calls made to the query optimizer\nduring configuration enumeration. Therefore, in practice it is desirable to set\na budget constraint that limits the number of what-if calls allowed. This\nyields a new problem of budget allocation, namely, deciding on which\nquery-configuration pairs (QCPs) to issue what-if calls. Unfortunately, optimal\nbudget allocation is NP-hard, and budget allocation decisions made by existing\nsolutions can be inferior. In particular, many of the what-if calls allocated\nby using existing solutions are devoted to QCPs whose what-if costs can be\napproximated by using cost derivation, a well-known technique that is\ncomputationally much more efficient and has been adopted by commercial index\ntuning software. This results in considerable waste of the budget, as these\nwhat-if calls are unnecessary. In this paper, we propose \"Wii,\" a lightweight\nmechanism that aims to avoid such spurious what-if calls. It can be seamlessly\nintegrated with existing configuration enumeration algorithms. Experimental\nevaluation on top of both standard industrial benchmarks and real workloads\ndemonstrates that Wii can eliminate significant number of spurious what-if\ncalls.

Although existing methods have been developed to\naddress death truncation in CRTs, no existing methods can jointly accommodate\nparticipants who drop out for reasons unrelated to mortality or serious\nillnesses, or those with an unknown survival status. This paper proposes a\nBayesian framework for estimating survivor average causal effects in CRTs while\naccounting for different types of missingness. Our approach uses a multivariate\noutcome that jointly estimates the causal effects, and in the posterior\nestimates, we distinguish the individual-level and the cluster-level survivor\naverage causal effect. We perform simulation studies to evaluate the\nperformance of our model and found low bias and high coverage on key parameters\nacross several different scenarios. We use data from a geriatric CRT to\nillustrate the use of our model.

Although there has been\nnotable progress in algorithmic developments and some initial combinatorial\ninsights, the combinatorial aspects of net occurrences have yet to be\nthoroughly examined. In this work, we make two key contributions. First, we\nconfirm the conjecture that each Fibonacci word contains exactly three net\noccurrences. Second, we show that each Thue-Morse word contains exactly nine\nnet occurrences. To achieve these results, we introduce the notion of\noverlapping net occurrence cover, which narrows down the candidate net\noccurrences in any text. Furthermore, we provide a precise characterization of\noccurrences of Fibonacci and Thue-Morse words of smaller order, offering\nstructural insights that may have independent interest and potential\napplications in algorithm analysis and combinatorial properties of these words.",

This observation of \"diminishing\nreturn\" on index quality leads us to introduce early stopping for budget-aware\nindex tuning, where user specifies a threshold on the tolerable loss of index\nquality and we stop index tuning if the projected loss with the remaining\nbudget is below the threshold. We further propose Esc, a low-overhead\nearly-stopping checker that realizes this new functionality. Experimental\nevaluation on top of both industrial benchmarks and real customer workloads\ndemonstrate that Esc can significantly reduce the number of what-if calls made\nduring budget-aware index tuning while incur little or zero improvement loss\nand little extra computational overhead compared to the overall index tuning\ntime.",

    "abstract": "The Schmidt numbers quantify the entanglement degree of quantum states.\nQuantum states with high Schmidt numbers provide a larger advantage in various\nquantum information processing tasks compared to quantum states with low\nSchmidt numbers. We derive a Schmidt number criterion based on the trace norm\nof the correlation matrix obtained from symmetric measurements. We show that\nour result is more effective than and superior to existing Schmidt number\ncriteria by detailed examples.",

    "abstract": "Sampling from flat modes in discrete spaces is a crucial yet underexplored\nproblem. Flat modes represent robust solutions and have broad applications in\ncombinatorial optimization and discrete generative modeling. However, existing\nsampling algorithms often overlook the mode volume and struggle to capture flat\nmodes effectively. To address this limitation, we propose \\emph{Entropic\nDiscrete Langevin Proposal} (EDLP), which incorporates local entropy into the\nsampling process through a continuous auxiliary variable under a joint\ndistribution. The local entropy term guides the discrete sampler toward flat\nmodes with a small overhead. We provide non-asymptotic convergence guarantees\nfor EDLP in locally log-concave discrete distributions. Empirically, our method\nconsistently outperforms traditional approaches across tasks that require\nsampling from flat basins, including Bernoulli distribution, restricted\nBoltzmann machines, combinatorial optimization, and binary neural networks.",
