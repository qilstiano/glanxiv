    "abstract": "Almost four decades of intense research have been invested to study the\nphysics of high-T$_c$ cuprate superconductors. The recent discovery of\nhigh-T$_c$ superconductivity in pressurized bilayer nickelates and its\npotential similarities with cuprate superconductors may open a new window to\nunderstand this long-standing problem. We have studied the proposed bilayer\n$t$-$J_\\parallel$-$J_\\perp$ model [where $J_\\parallel$ ($J_\\perp$) is the\nin-plane (out-of-plane) magnetic exchange] in a large-$N$ approach on the basis\nof the path integral representation for Hubbard operators, which allows to\nobtain results at mean-field and beyond mean-field level. We find that\n$J_\\perp$ is a candidate for triggering high superconducting $T_c$ values at\nquarter filling (hole doping $\\delta=0.5$) of the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals.\nBeyond mean-field level, we find a new phase, an out-of-plane bond-order phase\n(z-BOP), triggered also by $J_\\perp$. z-BOP develops below a critical\ntemperature which decreases with increasing doping and vanishes at a quantum\ncritical point below quarter filling. The occurrence of this phase and its\ncompetition with superconductivity leads to a superconducting dome-shaped\nbehavior as a function of doping and as a function of $J_\\perp$. Qualitative\ncomparisons with the physics of cuprates and the recent literature on the new\npressurized nickelates are given along the paper.",

The rates of\nconvergence are closely tied to the jump activity, with continuity between the\nGaussian case and more general jump processes.

    "abstract": "Transformers and their derivatives have achieved state-of-the-art performance\nacross text, vision, and speech recognition tasks. However, minimal effort has\nbeen made to train transformers capable of evaluating the output quality of\nother models. This paper examines SwinV2-based reward models, called the\nInput-Output Transformer (IO Transformer) and the Output Transformer. These\nreward models can be leveraged for tasks such as inference quality evaluation,\ndata categorization, and policy optimization. Our experiments demonstrate\nhighly accurate model output quality assessment across domains where the output\nis entirely dependent on the input, with the IO Transformer achieving perfect\nevaluation accuracy on the Change Dataset 25 (CD25). We also explore modified\nSwin V2 architectures. Ultimately Swin V2 remains on top with a score of 95.41\n% on the IO Segmentation Dataset, outperforming the IO Transformer in scenarios\nwhere the output is not entirely dependent on the input. Our work expands the\napplication of transformer architectures to reward modeling in computer vision\nand provides critical insights into optimizing these models for various tasks.",

In this paper, we\nanalyze this phenomenon in vision transformers, focusing on the spectral\ngeometry of residuals, and explore its implications for modality alignment in\nvision-language models. First, we link it to the intrinsically low-dimensional\nstructure of visual head representations, zooming into their principal\ncomponents and showing that they encode specialized roles across a wide variety\nof input data distributions. Then, we analyze the effect of head specialization\nin multimodal models, focusing on how improved alignment between text and\nspecialized heads impacts zero-shot classification performance. This\nspecialization-performance link consistently holds across diverse pre-training\ndata, network sizes, and objectives, demonstrating a powerful new mechanism for\nboosting zero-shot classification through targeted alignment. Ultimately, we\ntranslate these insights into actionable terms by introducing ResiDual, a\ntechnique for spectral alignment of the residual stream. Much like panning for\ngold, it lets the noise from irrelevant unit principal components (i.e.,\nattributes) wash away to amplify task-relevant ones. Remarkably, this dual\nperspective on modality alignment yields fine-tuning level performance on\ndifferent data distributions while modelling an extremely interpretable and\nparameter-efficient transformation, as we extensively show on 70 pre-trained\nnetwork-dataset combinations (7 models, 10 datasets).",

This paper extends the theory\nof enhanced diffusion to anisotropic and non-uniform geometries, where scaling\nin the \\(x\\)- and \\(y\\)-directions follows distinct, power-law relationships,\nand the velocity field exhibits spatially varying regularity. We define a\ngeneralized framework for anisotropic diffusion enhancement and rigorously\nderive new scaling laws for diffusion rates in these settings. Specifically, we\nshow that in a domain with anisotropic scaling functions \\( f(x) \\sim |x|^p \\)\nand \\( g(y) \\sim |y|^q \\), the enhanced diffusion rate \\( r(\\kappa) \\) for a\npassive scalar satisfies \\( r(\\kappa) = C \\kappa^{\\frac{pq}{p+q+2}} \\), where\n\\( C \\) depends on the regularity and scaling properties of the domain but\nremains independent of the diffusivity \\( \\kappa \\).

Mathematically, ToF imaging\nrelies on algorithmic super-resolution, as the back-scattered sparse light\nechoes lie on a finer time resolution than what digital devices can capture.\nTraditional methods necessitate knowledge of the emitted light pulses or\nkernels and employ sparse deconvolution to recover scenes. Unlike previous\napproaches, this paper introduces a novel, blind ToF imaging technique that\ndoes not require kernel calibration and recovers sparse spikes on a continuum,\nrather than a discrete grid. By studying the shared characteristics of various\nToF modalities, we capitalize on the fact that most physical pulses\napproximately satisfy the Strang-Fix conditions from approximation theory. This\nleads to a new mathematical formulation for sparse super-resolution. Our\nrecovery approach uses an optimization method that is pivoted on an alternating\nminimization strategy.

Extensive hardware\nexperiments across different ToF modalities demonstrate the algorithmic\nadvantages, flexibility and empirical robustness of our approach.

    "abstract": "Representing underwater 3D scenes is a valuable yet complex task, as\nattenuation and scattering effects during underwater imaging significantly\ncouple the information of the objects and the water. This coupling presents a\nsignificant challenge for existing methods in effectively representing both the\nobjects and the water medium simultaneously. To address this challenge, we\npropose Aquatic-GS, a hybrid 3D representation approach for underwater scenes\nthat effectively represents both the objects and the water medium.\nSpecifically, we construct a Neural Water Field (NWF) to implicitly model the\nwater parameters, while extending the latest 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to\nmodel the objects explicitly. Both components are integrated through a\nphysics-based underwater image formation model to represent complex underwater\nscenes. Moreover, to construct more precise scene geometry and details, we\ndesign a Depth-Guided Optimization (DGO) mechanism that uses a pseudo-depth map\nas auxiliary guidance. After optimization, Aquatic-GS enables the rendering of\nnovel underwater viewpoints and supports restoring the true appearance of\nunderwater scenes, as if the water medium were absent. Extensive experiments on\nboth simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate that Aquatic-GS surpasses\nstate-of-the-art underwater 3D representation methods, achieving better\nrendering quality and real-time rendering performance with a 410x increase in\nspeed. Furthermore, regarding underwater image restoration, Aquatic-GS\noutperforms representative dewatering methods in color correction, detail\nrecovery, and stability.

    "abstract": "Recent work has documented striking heterogeneity in the performance of\nstate-of-the-art vision language models (VLMs), including both multimodal\nlanguage models and text-to-image models. These models are able to describe and\ngenerate a diverse array of complex, naturalistic images, yet they exhibit\nsurprising failures on basic multi-object reasoning tasks -- such as counting,\nlocalization, and simple forms of visual analogy -- that humans perform with\nnear perfect accuracy. To better understand this puzzling pattern of successes\nand failures, we turn to theoretical accounts of the binding problem in\ncognitive science and neuroscience, a fundamental problem that arises when a\nshared set of representational resources must be used to represent distinct\nentities (e.g., to represent multiple objects in an image), necessitating the\nuse of serial processing to avoid interference. We find that many of the\npuzzling failures of state-of-the-art VLMs can be explained as arising due to\nthe binding problem, and that these failure modes are strikingly similar to the\nlimitations exhibited by rapid, feedforward processing in the human brain.",

We also show that the class of\nvertical curves coincides with the class of intersections of intrinsic\nLipschitz graphs satisfying a transversality condition. Unlike intrinsic\nLipschitz graphs, the Hausdorff dimension of a vertical curve can vary; we\nconstruct vertical curves with Hausdorff dimension either strictly larger or\nstrictly smaller than 2.

    "abstract": "An adversarial example is a modified input image designed to cause a Machine\nLearning (ML) model to make a mistake; these perturbations are often invisible\nor subtle to human observers and highlight vulnerabilities in a model's ability\nto generalize from its training data. Several adversarial attacks can create\nsuch examples, each with a different perspective, effectiveness, and\nperceptibility of changes. Conversely, defending against such adversarial\nattacks improves the robustness of ML models in image processing and other\ndomains of deep learning. Most defence mechanisms require either a level of\nmodel awareness, changes to the model, or access to a comprehensive set of\nadversarial examples during training, which is impractical. Another option is\nto use an auxiliary model in a preprocessing manner without changing the\nprimary model. This study presents a practical and effective solution -- using\npredictive coding networks (PCnets) as an auxiliary step for adversarial\ndefence. By seamlessly integrating PCnets into feed-forward networks as a\npreprocessing step, we substantially bolster resilience to adversarial\nperturbations. Our experiments on MNIST and CIFAR10 demonstrate the remarkable\neffectiveness of PCnets in mitigating adversarial examples with about 82% and\n65% improvements in robustness, respectively. The PCnet, trained on a small\nsubset of the dataset, leverages its generative nature to effectively counter\nadversarial efforts, reverting perturbed images closer to their original forms.\nThis innovative approach holds promise for enhancing the security and\nreliability of neural network classifiers in the face of the escalating threat\nof adversarial attacks.",

Breast\nultrasound (BUS) is an alternative breast cancer screening modality,\nparticularly useful for early detection in low-resource, rural contexts. The\npurpose of this study was to explore an artificial intelligence (AI) model to\npredict BI-RADS mammographic breast density category from clinical, handheld\nBUS imaging. Methods: All data are sourced from the Hawaii and Pacific Islands\nMammography Registry. We compared deep learning methods from BUS imaging, as\nwell as machine learning models from image statistics alone. The use of\nAI-derived BUS density as a risk factor for breast cancer was then compared to\nclinical BI-RADS breast density while adjusting for age. The BUS data were\nsplit by individual into 70/20/10% groups for training, validation, and\ntesting. Results: 405,120 clinical BUS images from 14.066 women were selected\nfor inclusion in this study, resulting in 9.846 women for training (302,574\nimages), 2,813 for validation (11,223 images), and 1,406 for testing (4,042\nimages). On the held-out testing set, the strongest AI model achieves AUROC\n0.854 predicting BI-RADS mammographic breast density from BUS imaging and\noutperforms all shallow machine learning methods based on image statistics. In\ncancer risk prediction, age-adjusted AI BUS breast density predicted 5-year\nbreast cancer risk with 0.633 AUROC, as compared to 0.637 AUROC from\nage-adjusted clinical breast density. Conclusions: BI-RADS mammographic breast\ndensity can be estimated from BUS imaging with high accuracy using a deep\nlearning model. Furthermore, we demonstrate that AI-derived BUS breast density\nis predictive of 5-year breast cancer risk in our population.",

    "abstract": "This study presents an innovative dynamic weighting knowledge distillation\n(KD) framework tailored for efficient Earth observation (EO) image\nclassification (IC) in resource-constrained settings. Utilizing EfficientViT\nand MobileViT as teacher models, this framework enables lightweight student\nmodels, particularly ResNet8 and ResNet16, to surpass 90% in accuracy,\nprecision, and recall, adhering to the stringent confidence thresholds\nnecessary for reliable classification tasks. Unlike conventional KD methods\nthat rely on static weight distribution, our adaptive weighting mechanism\nresponds to each teacher model's confidence, allowing student models to\nprioritize more credible sources of knowledge dynamically. Remarkably, ResNet8\ndelivers substantial efficiency gains, achieving a 97.5% reduction in\nparameters, a 96.7% decrease in FLOPs, an 86.2% cut in power consumption, and a\n63.5% increase in inference speed over MobileViT. This significant optimization\nof complexity and resource demands establishes ResNet8 as an optimal candidate\nfor EO tasks, combining robust performance with feasibility in deployment. The\nconfidence-based, adaptable KD approach underscores the potential of dynamic\ndistillation strategies to yield high-performing, resource-efficient models\ntailored for satellite-based EO applications. The reproducible code is\naccessible on our GitHub repository.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a new approach to urban sustainability assessment through\nthe use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to streamline the use of the ISO 37101\nframework to automate and standardise the assessment of urban initiatives\nagainst the six \"sustainability purposes\" and twelve \"issues\" outlined in the\nstandard. The methodology includes the development of a custom prompt based on\nthe standard definitions and its application to two different datasets: 527\nprojects from the Paris Participatory Budget and 398 activities from the\nPROBONO Horizon 2020 project. The results show the effectiveness of LLMs in\nquickly and consistently categorising different urban initiatives according to\nsustainability criteria. The approach is particularly promising when it comes\nto breaking down silos in urban planning by providing a holistic view of the\nimpact of projects. The paper discusses the advantages of this method over\ntraditional human-led assessments, including significant time savings and\nimproved consistency. However, it also points out the importance of human\nexpertise in interpreting results and ethical considerations.

However, evaluating the effectiveness of unlearning algorithms\nremains an open challenge. Previous work has relied on heuristics -- such as\nverifying that the model can no longer reproduce the specific information\ntargeted for removal while maintaining accuracy on unrelated test data. These\napproaches inadequately capture the complete effect of reversing the influence\nof datapoints on a trained model. In this work, we propose the RESTOR framework\nfor machine unlearning evaluation, which assesses the ability of unlearning\nalgorithms for targeted data erasure, by evaluating the ability of models to\nforget the knowledge introduced in these datapoints, while simultaneously\nrecovering the model's knowledge state had it never encountered these\ndatapoints.

    "abstract": "Motivated by the surge of interest in Koopman operator theory, we propose a\nmachine-learning alternative based on a functional Bayesian perspective for\noperator-theoretic modeling of unknown, data-driven, nonlinear dynamical\nsystems. This formulation is directly done in an infinite-dimensional space of\nlinear operators or Hilbert space with universal approximation property. The\ntheory of reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) allows the lifting of\nnonlinear dynamics to a potentially infinite-dimensional space via linear\nembeddings, where a general nonlinear function is represented as a set of\nlinear functions or operators in the functional space. This allows us to apply\nclassical linear Bayesian methods such as the Kalman filter directly in the\nHilbert space, yielding nonlinear solutions in the original input space. This\nkernel perspective on the Koopman operator offers two compelling advantages.\nFirst, the Hilbert space can be constructed deterministically, agnostic to the\nnonlinear dynamics. The Gaussian kernel is universal, approximating uniformly\nan arbitrary continuous target function over any compact domain. Second,\nBayesian filter is an adaptive, linear minimum-variance algorithm, allowing the\nsystem to update the Koopman operator and continuously track the changes across\nan extended period of time, ideally suited for modern data-driven applications\nsuch as real-time machine learning using streaming data. In this paper, we\npresent several practical implementations to obtain a finite-dimensional\napproximation of the functional Bayesian filter (FBF). Due to the rapid decay\nof the Gaussian kernel, excellent approximation is obtained with a small\ndimension. We demonstrate that this practical approach can obtain accurate\nresults and outperform finite-dimensional Koopman decomposition.",

These\ninclude lack of transparency, potential exposure of sensitive data, challenges\nto replicability, and dependence on proprietary systems. Additionally, their\nhigh costs make them impractical for large-scale research projects.\n  In contrast, open-source models, although available in various sizes, may\nunderperform compared to commercial alternatives if used without further\nfine-tuning. However, open-source models offer distinct advantages: they can be\nrun locally (ensuring data privacy), fine-tuned for specific tasks, shared\nwithin the research community, and integrated into reproducible workflows.\n  This study demonstrates that small, fine-tuned open-source LLMs can achieve\nequal or superior performance to models such as ChatGPT-4. We further explore\nthe relationship between training set size and fine-tuning efficacy in\nopen-source models.

The X-point effects on the ideal MHD\nmodes in tokamaks are then analyzed using this coordinate system. Since the\nX-point effects mainly affect the edge region, the modes localized at the\ntokamak edge are particularly examined. Two types of modes are studied. The\nfirst is related to the conventional peeling or peeling-ballooning modes. The\nmode existence aligned with the local magnetic field in the poloidally core\nregion, as observed experimentally, is confirmed. The X points are shown to\ncontribute to a stabilizing effect for the conventionally treated modes with\nthe surface-averaged q and with the tokamak edge portion truncated. The other\nis the axisymmetric modes localized in the vicinity of X points, which can\naffect the cross-field-line transport near the X points. The existence of\naxisymmetric modes points to the possibility of applying a toroidally\naxisymmetric resonant magnetic perturbation (RMP) in the X-point area for\nmitigating the edge localized modes, which can be an alternative to the current\nRMP design. The dual q description also has important implications for the\nexisting non-axisymmetric RMP concept. It helps to understand why the RMP\nsuppression of edge localized modes is difficult to achieve in the double-null\ntokamak configurations and points to the possibility of further improving the\ncurrent RMP concept by considering the alignment to the local q.",

In this paper, we explore vulnerabilities of MDE\nalgorithms in AD systems, presenting LensAttack, a novel physical attack that\nstrategically places optical lenses on the camera of an autonomous vehicle to\nmanipulate the perceived object depths.

To\naddress these limitations, this work introduces a full spectrum numerical\nmodeling approach that features three key innovations: high-fidelity Monte\nCarlo simulations that combine an advanced scintillation physics model with\ndetailed geometric representations of the aircraft and detector system; a\nsurrogate model that replicates the Monte Carlo simulations with significantly\nreduced computation time; and a data evaluation methodology that leverages the\nsurrogate model within a Bayesian inversion framework, enabling the\nquantification of arbitrarily complex gamma-ray fields. The methodology\npresented here, rigorously validated through laboratory and field measurements,\nachieves not only a significant improvement in accuracy and sensitivity over\ntraditional methods but also substantially expands the operational capabilities\nof AGRS systems for both emergency response scenarios and geophysical surveys.\nThese innovations lay the groundwork for establishing a new global standard for\nAGRS, ultimately supporting better-informed protective actions and reducing\nhealth risks during radiological emergencies.",

If the principal cannot conduct\nthis search on their own, they may instead delegate this problem to an agent\nwith distinct and potentially misaligned utilities. This is called delegated\nsearch, and the principal in such problems faces a mechanism design problem in\nwhich they must incentivize the agent to find and propose a solution maximizing\nthe principal's expected utility. Following prior work in this area, we\nconsider mechanisms without payments and aim to achieve a multiplicative\napproximation of the principal's utility when they solve the problem without\ndelegation.\n  In this work, we investigate a natural and recently studied generalization of\nthis model to multiple agents and find nearly tight bounds on the principal's\napproximation as the number of agents increases. As one might expect, this\napproximation approaches 1 with increasing numbers of agents, but, somewhat\nsurprisingly, we show that this is largely not due to direct competition among\nagents.",

A cellular flow is a\ntwo-dimensional Hamiltonian flow of the Hamiltonian $H(x, y) = \\cos(x)\n\\cos(y)$. We study a simple model of the dynamics of an inertial particle\ncarried by such a flow, subject to viscous drag and to an additional constant\nexternal force $(b, a)$. In the limiting case of zero inertia particles the\ndynamics is Hamiltonian with $H(x, y) = \\cos(x) \\cos(y) - ax + by$. For small\nbut nonzero $a, \\ b $ there appear ``channels\" of trajectories that wind their\nway to infinity, of small relative measure, while most trajectories remain\nperiodic.\n  By contrast, for nonzero inertia, no matter how small, almost all particle\ntrajectories drift to infinity. Moreover, the asymptotic direction of this\ndrift no longer coincides with the direction of forcing, and rather becomes\nCantor-like function of the forcing direction $a/b$, and with an unexpected\nfeature: the plateaus of this function occupy a set of full measure. Moreover,\nthe complement to this set has zero Hausdorff dimension. In a two-parameter\nrepresentation (one parameter being the forcing direction $a/b$, the other the\ndrag coefficient), this gives rise to Arnold tongues, the tongues corresponding\nto rational slopes of drift.

To\nfacilitate accurate interpretability in medical language models, this paper\nleverages dictionary learning that can efficiently extract sparsely activated\nrepresentations from dense language model embeddings in superposition.

First, we numerically\ngenerate a spike-adding diagram for the FHN model by varying the frequency and\namplitude of the input, revealing that as the frequency decreases and the\namplitude increases, the number of spikes within each burst grows. We\ndemonstrate that a similar spike-adding structure occurs in the more realistic,\nperiodically forced Morris-Lecar neuronal model. Next, we apply methods from\ngeometric singular perturbation theory to compute critical and super-critical\nmanifolds of the fast-slow system. We use them to characterize the emergence of\nnew burst-spikes in the FHN model, when the periodic forcing resembles a low\nfrequency-band brain rhythm. We then describe how the uncovered spike-adding\nmechanism defines the boundaries that separate regions with different spike\ncounts in the parameter space.",

    "abstract": "Transformers have become dominant in large-scale deep learning tasks across\nvarious domains, including text, 2D and 3D vision. However, the quadratic\ncomplexity of their attention mechanism limits their efficiency as the sequence\nlength increases, particularly in high-resolution 3D data such as point clouds.\nRecently, state space models (SSMs) like Mamba have emerged as promising\nalternatives, offering linear complexity, scalability, and high performance in\nlong-sequence tasks. The key challenge in the application of SSMs in this\ndomain lies in reconciling the non-sequential structure of point clouds with\nthe inherently directional (or bi-directional) order-dependent processing of\nrecurrent models like Mamba. To achieve this, previous research proposed\nreorganizing point clouds along multiple directions or predetermined paths in\n3D space, concatenating the results to produce a single 1D sequence capturing\ndifferent views. In our work, we introduce a method to convert point clouds\ninto 1D sequences that maintain 3D spatial structure with no need for data\nreplication, allowing Mamba sequential processing to be applied effectively in\nan almost permutation-invariant manner. In contrast to other works, we found\nthat our method does not require positional embeddings and allows for shorter\nsequence lengths while still achieving state-of-the-art results in ModelNet40\nand ScanObjectNN datasets and surpassing Transformer-based models in both\naccuracy and efficiency.",

Since the proposal of the lottery\nticket hypothesis, researchers have focused either on pruning at initialization\nor after training.

In this paper, starting\nfrom these results, we introduce Mutual Information Preserving Pruning (MIPP),\na structured activation-based pruning technique applicable before or after\ntraining. The core principle of MIPP is to select nodes in a way that conserves\nMI shared between the activations of adjacent layers, and consequently between\nthe data and masks. Approaching the pruning problem in this manner means we can\nprove that there exists a function that can map the pruned upstream layer's\nactivations to the downstream layer's, implying re-trainability.

    "abstract": "Obtaining dynamic models of continuum soft robots is central to the analysis\nand control of soft robots, and researchers have devoted much attention to the\nchallenge of proposing both data-driven and first-principle solutions. Both\navenues have, however, shown their limitations; the former lacks structure and\nperforms poorly outside training data, while the latter requires significant\nsimplifications and extensive expert knowledge to be used in practice. This\npaper introduces a streamlined method for learning low-dimensional,\nphysics-based models that are both accurate and easy to interpret. We start\nwith an algorithm that uses image data (i.e., shape evolutions) to determine\nthe minimal necessary segments for describing a soft robot's movement.\nFollowing this, we apply a dynamic regression and strain sparsification\nalgorithm to identify relevant strains and define the model's dynamics. We\nvalidate our approach through simulations with various planar soft\nmanipulators, comparing its performance against other learning strategies,\nshowing that our models are both computationally efficient and 25x more\naccurate on out-of-training distribution inputs. Finally, we demonstrate that\nthanks to the capability of the method of generating physically compatible\nmodels, the learned models can be straightforwardly combined with model-based\ncontrol policies.",

However, accurately determining their\nstructure from solution scattering remains a challenge. Their chain\nconformation is largely governed by the intrinsic orientational properties of\nthe monomers and their relative orientations, leading to a bimodal distribution\nof bending angles, unlike conventional polymer chains whose bending angles\nfollow a unimodal Gaussian distribution. Meanwhile, traditional scattering\nmodels for polymer chains do not account for these unique structural features.\nThis work introduces a novel approach that integrates machine learning with\nMonte Carlo simulations to address this challenge. We first develop a Monte\nCarlo simulation for sampling the configuration space of ladder polymers, where\neach monomer is modeled as a biaxial segment. Then, we establish a machine\nlearning-assisted scattering analysis framework based on Gaussian Process\nRegression.

In the forward rapidity region, 2.5 $<$ y\n$<$ 4, ALICE is equipped with a muon spectrometer (MS), which allows to study\nquarkonia and open heavy-flavor particles, both key probes to investigate QGP\nproperties.\n  Although in LHC Run 1 and 2 many important results were achieved, the front\nabsorber of the MS represented a limit to the physics program, due to the\nmultiple scattering and energy loss in the material. To assess this limitation,\na new forward vertex tracker (Muon Forward Tracker, MFT) was installed between\nthe inner tracking system (ITS) and the front absorber. This has enhanced the\nMS physics performance, enabling the separation of prompt/non-prompt charmonium\nproduction at forward rapidity. It will also allow one to reduce the\ncombinatorial background from semi-leptonic decays of kaons and pions. Finally,\nit will greatly improve the invariant-mass resolution of the low-mass dimuon\npairs.\n  Moreover, during the ongoing LHC Run 3, the rate of Pb\\textendash{}Pb\ncollisions has been increased from 10~kHz (in Run 2) up to 50~kHz, allowing to\ncollect a data sample about 5 times larger than the one recorded in Run 2.\n  This contribution will provide a brief overview of the MS upgrades and it\nwill focus on the expected physics performance during the LHC Run 3.

    "abstract": "We study the existence of a global periodic attractor for the reduced\ndynamics of a discrete toy model for rectilinear crawling locomotion,\ncorresponding to a limit cycle in the shape and velocity variables. The body of\nthe crawler consists of a chain of point masses, joined by active elastic links\nand subject to smooth friction forces, so that the dynamics is described by a\nsystem of second order differential equations. Our main result is of\nMassera-type, namely we show that the existence of a bounded solution implies\nthe existence of the global periodic attractor for the reduced dynamics. In\nestablishing this result, a contractive property of the dynamics of our model\nplays a central role. We then prove sufficient conditions on the friction\nforces for the existence of a bounded solution, and therefore of the attractor.\nWe also provide an example showing that, if we consider more general friction\nforces, such as smooth approximations of dry friction, bounded solutions may\nnot exist.",

This optimal ranking is the maximum likelihood estimate\nwhen evaluation data (which we view as votes) are interpreted as noisy samples\nfrom a ground truth ranking, a solution to Condorcet's original voting system\ncriteria.

However, quantum computers\nface challenges due to the inherent noise in physical qubits, necessitating\nerror correction for reliable operation in solving industrial-scale problems,\nwhich will require more computation time, energy, and electronic components\nthan initial laboratory-scale experiments. Yet, while researchers have modeled\nand analyzed the environmental impacts of classical computers using Life Cycle\nAssessment (LCA), the environmental performance of quantum computing remains\nunknown to date. This study contributes to filling this critical gap in two\nways: (1) by establishing an environmental profile for quantum computers based\non superconducting qubits; and (2) by comparing it to a functionally equivalent\nprofile of a state-of-the-art supercomputer. With the comparison based on the\nproblem size, the paper shows how the usage time can drive an environmental\nadvantage for quantum computers under specific scaling conditions and quantum\nerror correcting codes.

The 0.9 mm continuum emission of the central\nsource represents a mixture of the dust thermal emission and free-free emission\nof the ionized gas. Properties of the free-free emission are typical for\nhypercompact H II regions. In the continuum emission of the knots in the jet\nthe free-free component apparently dominates. In the molecular lines a\nsub-Keplerian disk around NIRS3 about 400 au in diameter is observed.

    "abstract": "As cancer cases continue to rise, with a 2023 study from Zhejiang and Harvard\npredicting a 31 percent increase in cases and a 21 percent increase in deaths\nby 2030, the need to find more effective treatments for cancer is greater than\never before. Traditional approaches to treating cancer, such as chemotherapy,\noften kill healthy cells because of their lack of targetability. In contrast,\npersonalized cancer vaccines can utilize neoepitopes - distinctive peptides on\ncancer cells that are often missed by the body's immune system - that have\nstrong binding affinities to a patient's MHC to provide a more targeted\ntreatment approach. The selection of optimal neoepitopes that elicit an immune\nresponse is a time-consuming and costly process due to the required inputs of\nmodern predictive methods. This project aims to facilitate faster, cheaper, and\nmore accurate neoepitope binding predictions using Feed Forward Neural Networks\n(FFNN) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN).\n  To address this, NEO was created. NEO requires next-generation sequencing\ndata and uses a stacking ensemble method by calculating scores from\nstate-of-the-art models (MHCFlurry 1.6, NetMHCstabpan 1.0, and IEDB). The\nmodel's architecture includes an FFNN and an RNN with LSTM layers capable of\nanalyzing both sequential and non-sequential data.

Two classical approaches are the Kiefer-Wolfowitz (KW) and\nsimultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation (SPSA) algorithms, which\nestimate gradients using just two samples in each iteration to conserve\nsamples. However, this approach yields imprecise gradient estimators,\nnecessitating diminishing step sizes to ensure convergence, often resulting in\nslow optimization progress.

This paper conducts a comprehensive\nexperimental comparison among these approaches, examining the fundamental\ntrade-off between gradient estimation accuracy and iteration steps. Through\nextensive experiments in both low-dimensional and high-dimensional settings, we\ndemonstrate a surprising finding: when an efficient batch-based FD estimator is\napplied, its corresponding gradient descent algorithm generally shows better\nperformance compared to classical KW and SPSA algorithms in our tested\nscenarios.",

    "abstract": "In real-world applications, the distribution of the data, and our goals,\nevolve over time. The prevailing theoretical framework for studying machine\nlearning, namely probably approximately correct (PAC) learning, largely ignores\ntime. As a consequence, existing strategies to address the dynamic nature of\ndata and goals exhibit poor real-world performance. This paper develops a\ntheoretical framework called \"Prospective Learning\" that is tailored for\nsituations when the optimal hypothesis changes over time. In PAC learning,\nempirical risk minimization (ERM) is known to be consistent. We develop a\nlearner called Prospective ERM, which returns a sequence of predictors that\nmake predictions on future data. We prove that the risk of prospective ERM\nconverges to the Bayes risk under certain assumptions on the stochastic process\ngenerating the data. Prospective ERM, roughly speaking, incorporates time as an\ninput in addition to the data. We show that standard ERM as done in PAC\nlearning, without incorporating time, can result in failure to learn when\ndistributions are dynamic. Numerical experiments illustrate that prospective\nERM can learn synthetic and visual recognition problems constructed from MNIST\nand CIFAR-10. Code at https://github.com/neurodata/prolearn.",

Non-radiative cosmological simulations of galaxy\nclusters show a comparably slow magnetic field growth that only saturates at\nlate times. We include galaxy formation physics and find a significantly\naccelerated magnetic field growth. We identify three crucial stages in the\nmagnetic field evolution. 1) At high redshift, the central dominant galaxy\nserves as the prime agent that magnetizes not only its immediate vicinity but\nalso most of the forming protocluster through a combination of a small-scale\ndynamo induced by gravitationally driven, compressive turbulence and stellar\nand active galactic nuclei feedback that distribute the magnetic field via\noutflows. 2) This process continues as other galaxies merge into the forming\ncluster in subsequent epochs, thereby transporting their previously amplified\nmagnetic field to the intracluster medium (ICM) through ram pressure stripping\nand galactic winds. 3) At lower redshift, gas accretion and frequent cluster\nmergers trigger additional small-scale dynamo processes, thereby preventing the\ndecay of the magnetic field and fostering the increase of the magnetic\ncoherence scale. We show that the magnetic field observed today in the weakly\ncollisional ICM is consistently amplified on collisional scales. Initially,\nthis occurs in the collisional interstellar medium during protocluster\nassembly, and later in the ICM on the magnetic coherence scale, which always\nexceeds the particle mean free path, supporting the use of\nmagneto-hydrodynamics for studying the cluster dynamo. We generate synthetic\nFaraday rotation measure observations of protoclusters, highlighting the\npotential for studying magnetic field growth during the onset of cluster\nformation at cosmic dawn.",

State-of-the-art simulations do not agree\non whether or not such a disc can be a product of the multiple stellar wind\ninteractions of the mass-losing stars in the region. This study aims to\nconstrain the conditions for the formation of a cold disc as a natural outcome\nof the system of the mass-losing stars orbiting around Sgr A*, to investigate\nwhether the disc is a transient or long-lasting structure, and to assess the\nvalidity of the model through direct comparisons with observations. We\nperformed a set of hydrodynamic simulations of the observed Wolf-Rayet (WR)\nstars feeding Sgr A* using the finite-volume adaptive mesh refinement code\nRamses. We focus, for the first time, on the impact of the chemical composition\nof the plasma emanating from the WR stars. The simulations show that the\nchemical composition of the plasma affects the radiative cooling enough to\nimpact the properties of the medium, such as density and temperature, and, as a\nconsequence, the rate at which the material inflows onto Sgr A*. We demonstrate\nthat the formation of a cold disc from the stellar winds is possible for\ncertain chemical compositions that are consistent with the current\nobservational constraints. However, even in such cases, it is not possible to\nreproduce the reported properties of the observed disc-like structure, namely\nits inclination and the fluxes of its hydrogen recombination lines.

    "abstract": "Using early data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) survey,\nwe search for AGN signatures in 410,757 line-emitting galaxies.

Of these AGN candidates, 4,181 sources exhibit a broad\nH$\\alpha$ component, allowing us to estimate their BH masses via virial\ntechniques. This study more than triples the census of dwarf AGN and doubles\nthe number of intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH; $M_{BH} \\le 10^6~\\rm\nM_{\\odot}$) candidates, spanning a broad discovery space in stellar mass (7 $<\n\\log (M_{\\star}/M_{\\odot}) <$ 12) and redshift (0.001 $< \\rm z <$ 0.45). The\nobserved AGN fraction in dwarf galaxies ($\\approx$2.1%) is nearly four times\nhigher than prior estimates, primarily due to DESI's smaller fiber size, which\nenables the detection of lower luminosity dwarf AGN candidates. We also extend\nthe $M_{BH} - M_{\\star}$ scaling relation down to $\\log (M_{\\star}/M_{\\odot})\n\\approx$ 8.5 and $\\log (M_{BH}/\\rm M_{\\odot}) \\approx$ 4.4, with our results\naligning well with previous low-redshift studies.

    "abstract": "X-ray observations of galaxy clusters are routinely used to derive radial\ndistributions of ICM thermdynamical properties such as density and temperature.\nHowever, observations allow us to access quantities projected on the celestial\nsphere only, so that an assumption on the 3D distribution of the ICM is\nnecessary. Usually, spherical geometry is assumed. The aim of this paper is to\ndetermine the bias due to this approximation on the reconstruction of ICM\ndensity radial profile of a clusters sample and on the intrinsic scatter of the\ndensity profiles distribution, when clusters substructures are not masked. We\nused 98 simulated clusters for which we know the 3D ICM distribution drawn from\nThe Three Hundred project. For each cluster we simulated 40 different\nobservations by projecting the cluster along 40 different lines of sight. We\nextracted the ICM density profile from each observation assuming the ICM to be\nspherical distributed. For each line of sight we then considered the mean\ndensity profile over the sample and compared it with the 3D density profile\ngiven by the simulations. The spherical bias on the density profile is derived\nby considering the ratio between the observed and the input quantities. We also\nstudy the bias on the intrinsic scatter of the density profile distribution\nperforming the same procedure. We find a bias on the density profile, $b_n$,\nsmaller than $10\\%$ for $R\\lesssim R_{500}$ while it increases up to $\\sim\n50\\%$ for larger radii. The bias on the intrinsic scatter profile, $b_s$,\nreaches a value of $\\approx 100\\%$ for $R\\approx R_{500}$. The bias on both the\nanalysed quantities strongly depends on the morphology of the objects: for\nclusters that do not show large scale substructures, both $b_n$ and $b_s$ are\nreduced by a factor 2, conversely for systems that do show large scale\nsubstructures both $b_n$ and $b_s$ increase significantly.

In order to broadly map BSM\nscenarios, a powerful tool is to devise its effective field theory (EFT)\nversion for low-energies. In this work, we obtain a consistent EFT for a class\nof models based on the gauge group $SU(3)_c\\times SU(3)_L\\times U(1)_Y$. After\nproperly matching the UV-complete theory at one-loop, we show that the EFT is a\nTwo-Higgs-Doublet Model (2HDM), where some of the quartic couplings are\nnaturally small. By imposing bounds from electroweak precision observables,\ncollider, flavor, as well as theoretical considerations, we obtain that the\nmaximum value of the trilinear Higgs coupling is more than four times larger\nthan the SM prediction, potentially testable at the LHC Hi-Lumi upgrade and\nother future colliders.

Here, we derive global neutral hydrogen gas (HI)\nproperties of nearby Lya-emitting galaxies to assess the impact of HI on the\nLya output of galaxies. We observed 21cm line emission using the VLA in D-array\nconfiguration (~55\" resolution, ~38 kpc) for 37 star-forming galaxies with\navailable Lya imaging from the Lyman Alpha Reference Samples (LARS and eLARS).\nWe detect 21cm emission for 33/37 galaxies observed. We find no significant\ncorrelation of global HI properties with Lya luminosity, escape fraction or\nequivalent width derived with HST photometry. Additionally, both Lya-emitters\nand weak or non-emitters are distributed evenly along the HI parameter space of\noptically-selected z=0 galaxies. Around 74% of the sample is undergoing galaxy\ninteraction, this fraction is higher for Lya-emitters (83% for galaxies with\nEW$\\geq$20\\r{A}) than for non or weak emitters (70%). Nevertheless, galaxies\nidentified as interacting have Lya and HI properties statistically consistent\nwith those of non-interacting galaxies. Our results show that global HI\nproperties (on scales > 30kpc) have little direct impact on the Lya output from\ngalaxies. Instead, HI likely regulates Lya emission on small scales:\nstatistical comparisons of Lya and high angular resolution 21cm observations\nare required to fully assess the role of HI in Lya radiative transfer.

Our fitting also produces a\nsample of spurious astrometric orbits similar to those found in DR3; these are\nmainly the result of scan angle-dependent astrometric biases in marginally\nresolved wide binaries.

    "abstract": "Gaussian processes (GPs) are non-parametric probabilistic regression models\nthat are popular due to their flexibility, data efficiency, and well-calibrated\nuncertainty estimates. However, standard GP models assume homoskedastic\nGaussian noise, while many real-world applications are subject to non-Gaussian\ncorruptions. Variants of GPs that are more robust to alternative noise models\nhave been proposed, and entail significant trade-offs between accuracy and\nrobustness, and between computational requirements and theoretical guarantees.\nIn this work, we propose and study a GP model that achieves robustness against\nsparse outliers by inferring data-point-specific noise levels with a sequential\nselection procedure maximizing the log marginal likelihood that we refer to as\nrelevance pursuit. We show, surprisingly, that the model can be parameterized\nsuch that the associated log marginal likelihood is strongly concave in the\ndata-point-specific noise variances, a property rarely found in either robust\nregression objectives or GP marginal likelihoods. This in turn implies the weak\nsubmodularity of the corresponding subset selection problem, and thereby proves\napproximation guarantees for the proposed algorithm. We compare the model's\nperformance relative to other approaches on diverse regression and Bayesian\noptimization tasks, including the challenging but common setting of sparse\ncorruptions of the labels within or close to the function range.",

Current models often yield static or\nminimally dynamic outputs, failing to capture complex motions described by\ntext. This issue stems from the internal biases in text encoding, which\noverlooks motions, and inadequate conditioning mechanisms in T2V generation\nmodels. To address this, we propose a novel framework called DEcomposed MOtion\n(DEMO), which enhances motion synthesis in T2V generation by decomposing both\ntext encoding and conditioning into content and motion components. Our method\nincludes a content encoder for static elements and a motion encoder for\ntemporal dynamics, alongside separate content and motion conditioning\nmechanisms. Crucially, we introduce text-motion and video-motion supervision to\nimprove the model's understanding and generation of motion. Evaluations on\nbenchmarks such as MSR-VTT, UCF-101, WebVid-10M, EvalCrafter, and VBench\ndemonstrate DEMO's superior ability to produce videos with enhanced motion\ndynamics while maintaining high visual quality.

In this work, we introduce the Geometric Diffusion Bridge\n(GDB), a novel generative modeling framework that accurately bridges initial\nand target geometric states.

This tailored diffusion process is anchored by initial and target\ngeometric states as fixed endpoints and governed by equivariant transition\nkernels. Moreover, trajectory data can be seamlessly leveraged in our GDB\nframework by using a chain of equivariant diffusion bridges, providing a more\ndetailed and accurate characterization of evolution dynamics. Theoretically, we\nconduct a thorough examination to confirm our framework's ability to preserve\njoint distributions of geometric states and capability to completely model the\nunderlying dynamics inducing trajectory distributions with negligible error.\nExperimental evaluations across various real-world scenarios show that GDB\nsurpasses existing state-of-the-art approaches, opening up a new pathway for\naccurately bridging geometric states and tackling crucial scientific challenges\nwith improved accuracy and applicability.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning architectures for supervised learning on tabular data range\nfrom simple multilayer perceptrons (MLP) to sophisticated Transformers and\nretrieval-augmented methods. This study highlights a major, yet so far\noverlooked opportunity for designing substantially better MLP-based tabular\narchitectures. Namely, our new model TabM relies on efficient ensembling, where\none TabM efficiently imitates an ensemble of MLPs and produces multiple\npredictions per object. Compared to a traditional deep ensemble, in TabM, the\nunderlying implicit MLPs are trained simultaneously, and (by default) share\nmost of their parameters, which results in significantly better performance and\nefficiency. Using TabM as a new baseline, we perform a large-scale evaluation\nof tabular DL architectures on public benchmarks in terms of both task\nperformance and efficiency, which renders the landscape of tabular DL in a new\nlight. Generally, we show that MLPs, including TabM, form a line of stronger\nand more practical models compared to attention- and retrieval-based\narchitectures. In particular, we find that TabM demonstrates the best\nperformance among tabular DL models. Then, we conduct an empirical analysis on\nthe ensemble-like nature of TabM. We observe that the multiple predictions of\nTabM are weak individually, but powerful collectively. Overall, our work brings\nan impactful technique to tabular DL and advances the performance-efficiency\ntrade-off with TabM -- a simple and powerful baseline for researchers and\npractitioners.",

To eliminate the need\nfor accurate pose input during reconstruction, we anchor one input view's local\ncamera coordinates as the canonical space and train the network to predict\nGaussian primitives for all views within this space. This approach obviates the\nneed to transform Gaussian primitives from local coordinates into a global\ncoordinate system, thus avoiding errors associated with per-frame Gaussians and\npose estimation. To resolve scale ambiguity, we design and compare various\nintrinsic embedding methods, ultimately opting to convert camera intrinsics\ninto a token embedding and concatenate it with image tokens as input to the\nmodel, enabling accurate scene scale prediction. We utilize the reconstructed\n3D Gaussians for novel view synthesis and pose estimation tasks and propose a\ntwo-stage coarse-to-fine pipeline for accurate pose estimation.

While the general approach to the latter operation\nlies in integrating differentiable physically-based rendering (PBR) techniques\nto jointly recover BRDF materials and environment lighting, achieving a precise\ndisentanglement remains an inherently difficult task due to the challenge of\naccurately modeling light transport. Existing approaches typically approximate\nGaussian points' normals, which constitute an implicit geometric constraint.\nHowever, they usually suffer from inaccuracies in normal estimation that\nsubsequently degrade light transport, resulting in noisy material decomposition\nand flawed relighting results.

By differentiably constructing a surface-grounded\n3DGS from an optimizable mesh, our approach leverages well-defined mesh normals\nand the opaque mesh surface, and additionally facilitates the use of mesh-based\nray tracing techniques for efficient, occlusion-aware light transport\ncalculations. This enhancement ensures precise material decomposition while\npreserving the efficiency and high-quality rendering capabilities of 3DGS.\nComprehensive evaluations across diverse datasets demonstrate the effectiveness\nof GeoSplatting, highlighting its superior efficiency and state-of-the-art\ninverse rendering performance.

In this paper, we study the problem of testing how close or\nfar a quantum state is to a stabilizer state. We make two contributions: First,\nwe improve the state-of-the-art parameters for the tolerant testing of\nstabilizer states. In particular, we show that there is an efficient quantum\nprimitive to distinguish if the maximum fidelity of a quantum state with a\nstabilizer state is $\\geq \\epsilon_1$ or $\\leq \\epsilon_2$, given one of them\nis the case, provided that $\\epsilon_2 \\leq \\epsilon_1^{O(1)}$. This result\nimproves the parameters in the previous work [AD24] which assumed $\\epsilon_2\n\\leq e^{- 1/\\epsilon^{O(1)}_1}$ [AD24]. Our proof technique extends the\ntoolsets developed in [AD24] by applying a random Clifford map which balances\nthe characteristic function of a quantum state, enabling the use of standard\nproof techniques from higher-order Fourier analysis for Boolean functions\n[HHL19, Sam07], where improved testing bounds are available.\n  Second, we study the problem of testing low stabilizer rank states. We show\nthat if for an infinite family of quantum states stabilizer rank is lower than\na constant independent of system size, then stabilizer fidelity is lower\nbounded by an absolute constant. Using a result of [GIKL22], one of the\nimplications of this result is that low approximate stabilizer rank states are\nnot pseudo-random.\n  At the same time our work was completed and posted on arXiv, two other groups\n[BvDH24, ABD24] independently achieved similar exponential to polynomial\nimprovements for tolerant testing, each using a different approach.",

    "abstract": "Text embeddings from PLM-based models enable a wide range of applications,\nyet their performance often degrades on longer texts. In this paper, we\nintroduce a phenomenon we call Length Collapse, where embeddings of longer\ntexts tend to cluster together. This clustering results in a distributional\ninconsistency between the embeddings of short and long texts. We further\ninvestigate how these differences contribute to the performance decline\nobserved with longer texts across various downstream tasks. Through a rigorous\ntheoretical analysis of the self-attention mechanism, which acts as a low-pass\nfilter in PLM-based models, we demonstrate that as text length increases, the\nstrength of low-pass filtering intensifies, causing embeddings to retain more\nlow-frequency components. As a result, input token features become more\nsimilar, leading to clustering and ultimately the collapse of embeddings for\nlonger texts. To address this issue, we propose a simple method, TempScale,\nwhich mitigates the Length Collapse phenomenon. By narrowing the gap in\nlow-pass filtering rates between long and short texts, TempScale ensures more\nconsistent embeddings across different text lengths.

From these findings, the device was designed with a\nnon-biomimetic anterior-posterior translation degree of freedom with a 10 cm\nrange of motion which is primarily position-controlled to change the alignment\nof the prosthetic foot with the residual limb. The system is both mobile and\ntethered, with the batteries, actuators, and majority of electronics located in\na small backpack. Mechanical loads are transmitted through cables to the\nprosthesis, minimizing the distal mass carriage required. We measured torque\nand force sensing accuracy, open loop actuator performance, closed loop torque\nand position control bandwidth, and torque and position tracking error during\nwalking. The system is capable of producing up to 160 N-m of plantarflexion\ntorque and 394 N of AP translation force with a closed loop control bandwidth\nof about 7 Hz in both degrees of freedom. Torque tracking during walking was\naccurate within about 10 N-m but position tracking was substantially affected\nby phase lag, possibly due to cable slack in the bidirectional mechanism. The\nprototype was capable of replicating our simulated prosthesis dynamics during\ngait and offers useful insights into the advantages and the practical\nconsiderations of using predictive biomechanical simulation as a design tool\nfor wearable robots.",

Local Hamiltonians: We give a tolerant testing protocol to decide if $H$\nis $\\epsilon_1$-close to $k$-local or $\\epsilon_2$-far from $k$-local, with\n$O(1/(\\epsilon_2-\\epsilon_1)^{4})$ queries, solving open questions posed in a\nrecent work by Bluhm et al.

Sparse Hamiltonians: We give a protocol to test if $H$ is\n$\\epsilon_1$-close to being $s$-sparse (in the Pauli basis) or $\\epsilon_2$-far\nfrom being $s$-sparse, with $O(s^{6}/(\\epsilon_2^2-\\epsilon_1^2)^{6})$ queries.\nFor learning up to error $\\epsilon$, we show that $O(s^{4}/\\epsilon^{8})$\nqueries suffice.\n  3. Learning without memory: The learning results stated above have no\ndependence on $n$, but require $n$-qubit quantum memory. We give subroutines\nthat allow us to learn without memory; increasing the query complexity by a\n$(\\log n)$-factor in the local case and an $n$-factor in the sparse case.\n  4. Testing without memory: We give a new subroutine called Pauli hashing,\nwhich allows one to tolerantly test $s$-sparse Hamiltonians with\n$O(s^{14}/(\\epsilon_2^2-\\epsilon_1^2)^{18})$ queries. A key ingredient is\nshowing that $s$-sparse Pauli channels can be tolerantly tested under the\ndiamond norm with $O(s^2/(\\epsilon_2-\\epsilon_1)^6)$ queries.\n  Along the way, we prove new structural theorems for local and sparse\nHamiltonians.

Assuming a rank-one signal matrix, under mild technical conditions,\nthe entrywise estimation error of our method provably has no dependence on the\ncoherence under Gaussian noise (i.e., in the spiked Wigner model), and achieves\nthe optimal estimation rate up to logarithmic factors. Simulations demonstrate\nthat our method performs well under non-Gaussian noise and that an extension of\nour method to the case of a rank-$r$ signal matrix has little to no dependence\non the coherence. In addition, we derive new metric entropy bounds for rank-$r$\nsingular subspaces under $\\ell_{2,\\infty}$ distance, which may be of\nindependent interest.

Unlike state of the art models,\nlinear splines allow to represent extended objects whose contour is an\narbitrarily complex curve. An exact likelihood is derived for the case in which\nnoisy measurements can be scattered from any point on the contour of the\nextended object, while an approximate Monte Carlo likelihood is provided for\nthe case wherein scattering points can be anywhere, i.e. inside or on the\ncontour, on the object surface. Exploiting such likelihood to measure how well\nthe observed data fit a given shape, a suitable estimator is developed. The\nproposed estimator models the extended object in terms of a kinematic state,\nproviding object position and orientation, along with a shape vector,\ncharacterizing object contour and surface. The kinematic state is estimated via\na nonlinear Kalman filter, while the shape vector is estimated via a Bayesian\nclassifier so that classification is implicitly solved during shape estimation.\nNumerical experiments are provided to assess, compared to state of the art\nextended object estimators, the effectiveness of the proposed one.",

However, recent studies show that the\npromise of protecting the privacy of data is not upheld by existing methods and\nthat it is possible to recreate the training data from the different\ninstitutions. This is done by utilizing gradients transferred between the\nclients and the global server during training or by knowing the model\narchitecture at the client end.

Implemented with\nhighly-optimized attention GPU kernels, EScAIP achieves substantial gains in\nefficiency--at least 10x faster inference, 5x less memory usage--compared to\nexisting NNIPs. EScAIP also achieves state-of-the-art performance on a wide\nrange of datasets including catalysts (OC20 and OC22), molecules (SPICE), and\nmaterials (MPTrj). We emphasize that our approach should be thought of as a\nphilosophy rather than a specific model, representing a proof-of-concept for\ndeveloping general-purpose NNIPs that achieve better expressivity through\nscaling, and continue to scale efficiently with increased computational\nresources and training data.",

We begin by introducing the\nQuantile Attention-Fourier Deep Operator Network (QAF-DeepONet), designed to\ncapture the complex dynamics of voltage trajectories and reliably estimate\nquantiles of the target trajectory without any distributional assumptions. The\nproposed operator regression model maps the observed portion of the voltage\ntrajectory to its unobserved post-fault trajectory. Our methodology employs a\npre-training and fine-tuning process to address the challenge of limited data\navailability. To ensure data privacy in learning the pre-trained model, we use\nmerging via federated learning with data from neighboring buses, enabling the\nmodel to learn the underlying voltage dynamics from such buses without directly\nsharing their data. After pre-training, we fine-tune the model with data from\nthe target bus, allowing it to adapt to unique dynamics and operating\nconditions. Finally, we integrate conformal prediction into the fine-tuned\nmodel to ensure coverage guarantees for the predicted intervals. We evaluated\nthe performance of the proposed methodology using the New England 39-bus test\nsystem considering detailed models of voltage and frequency controllers. Two\nmetrics, Prediction Interval Coverage Probability (PICP) and Prediction\nInterval Normalized Average Width (PINAW), are used to numerically assess the\nmodel's performance in predicting intervals.

We recently identified radio\nemission from QS Vir in the Very Large Array Sky Survey, at a flux of ~1 mJy.\nThe origin of radio emission from CVs is not fully understood, with evidence\nfor synchrotron emission from jets and other coherent plasma emission\nprocesses, such as electron cyclotron maser emission (ECME) or plasma\nradiation. Our aim is to constrain the radio emission mechanism for QS Vir,\nthrough spectroscopic, polarisation, and time variability measurements, all\nwhile checking for correlated X-ray variations. We took 3 epochs of new\nobservations with the VLA in S, C, and X bands, with full Stokes polarisation\ninformation, complemented by near-simultaneous Swift/XRT X-ray data. Radio\nspectra are extracted to search for emission features characteristic of\ncoherent plasma emission processes (e.g. high circular polarisation and\nnarrow-band emission). We fit the X-ray spectra with absorbed power-laws,\nfinding no strong X-ray variability. QS Vir showed a nearly flat radio\nspectrum, with fluxes of 0.4-0.6 mJy in all bands. Swift/XRT showed L_X ~\n5x10^29 erg/s in all observations. We identified strong, variable circular\npolarisation, ranging from 33+/-3% in S band in the last observation, to <11%\nin the middle observation in all bands. Linear polarisation was not detected,\nwith upper limits of at most 15%. Intriguingly, the S-band spectra show\ncircularly polarised spectral bumps (width ~0.5 GHz) that rise and decay within\n<5 minutes. We suggest that the radio emission from QS Vir consists of two\ncomponents: a relatively constant, low-polarisation flat-spectrum component and\na band-limited, rapidly variable, and strongly circularly polarised component.\nThis latter coherent component may be associated with ECME or plasma radiation.",

By\ngenerating new reasoning steps and branches based on the original thought\nstructure with various designed strategies, TSE broadens the thought\nexploration view and alleviates the impact of blind spots for LLM reasoning.\nExperimental results on multiple levels of reasoning tasks demonstrate the\nefficacy of TSE by surpassing various baseline methods.

In recent years, Large Language Models\n(LLMs) have rapidly advanced and shown remarkable abilities in various\nsequential decision-making tasks. To enhance the learning capabilities of\ncooperative agents while ensuring decision-making efficiency and\ncost-effectiveness, we propose LDPD, a language-driven policy distillation\nmethod for guiding MARL exploration. In this framework, a teacher agent based\non LLM trains smaller student agents to achieve cooperative decision-making\nthrough its own decision-making demonstrations. The teacher agent enhances the\nobservation information of CAVs and utilizes LLMs to perform complex\ncooperative decision-making reasoning, which also leverages carefully designed\ndecision-making tools to achieve expert-level decisions, providing high-quality\nteaching experiences. The student agent then refines the teacher's prior\nknowledge into its own model through gradient policy updates.

Traditional approaches have employed CNNs and various other deep\nlearning techniques, trained on extensive collections of labeled images.

    "abstract": "We find statistical evidence for a mismatch between the (global) spatial\ncurvature parameter $K$ in the geodesic equation for incoming photons, and the\ncorresponding parameter in the Friedmann equation that determines the time\nevolution of the background spacetime and its perturbations. The mismatch\nhereafter referred to as `curvature-slip' is especially evident when the SH0ES\nprior on the current expansion rate is assumed. This result is based on joint\nanalyses of cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations with the PLANCK\nsatellite (P18), first year results of the Dark Energy Survey (DES), Baryonic\nOscillation (BAO) data, and - at a lower level of significance - also on\nPantheon SNIa (SN) catalog. For example, the betting odds against the Null\nHypothesis are greater than $10^7$:1, 1400:1 and 1000:1 when P18+SH0ES,\nP18+DES+SH0ES, and P18+BAO+SH0ES, respectively, are considered. Datasets\ninvolving SNIa weaken this curvature slip considerably. Notably, even when the\nSH0ES prior is not imposed the betting odds for the rejection of the Null\nHypothesis are 70:1 and 160:1 in cases where P18+DES and P18+BAO are\nconsidered. When the SH0ES prior is imposed, global fit of the modified model\n(that allows for a nonvanishing `curvature slip') strongly outperforms that of\n$\\Lambda$CDM as is manifested by significant Deviance Information Criterion\n(DIC) gains, ranging between 7 and 23, depending on the dataset combination\nconsidered.

We prove\nthat, for a fixed generalized Fisher information, this family of densities is\nof minimal R\\'enyi entropy. Moreover, we introduce generalized moments via the\nmean of the power of a deformed cumulative distribution. The latter is defined\nas a cumulative of the power of the probability density function, this second\nparameter tuning the tail weight of the deformed cumulative distribution. These\ngeneralized moments coincide with the usual moments of a deformed probability\ndistribution with a regularized tail. We show that, for any bounded probability\ndensity, there exists a critical value for this second parameter below which\nthe whole subfamily of generalized moments is finite for any positive value of\nthe first parameter (power of the moment). In addition, we show that such\ngeneralized moments satisfy remarkable properties like order relation w.r.t.\nthe first parameter, or adequate scaling behavior. Then we highlight that, if\nwe constrain such a generalized moment, both the R\\'enyi entropy and\ngeneralized Fisher information achieve respectively their maximum and minimum\nfor the generalized trigonometric densities.

While many of these models have been developed for tasks like\ndisease diagnosis and tissue quantification using extensive and diverse\ntraining datasets, their readiness for deployment on some arguably simplest\ntasks, such as nuclei segmentation within a single organ (e.g., the kidney),\nremains uncertain. This paper seeks to answer this key question, \"How good are\nwe?\", by thoroughly evaluating the performance of recent cell foundation models\non a curated multi-center, multi-disease, and multi-species external testing\ndataset. Additionally, we tackle a more challenging question, \"How can we\nimprove?\", by developing and assessing human-in-the-loop data enrichment\nstrategies aimed at enhancing model performance while minimizing the reliance\non pixel-level human annotation. To address the first question, we curated a\nmulticenter, multidisease, and multispecies dataset consisting of 2,542 kidney\nwhole slide images (WSIs). Three state-of-the-art (SOTA) cell foundation\nmodels-Cellpose, StarDist, and CellViT-were selected for evaluation. To tackle\nthe second question, we explored data enrichment algorithms by distilling\npredictions from the different foundation models with a human-in-the-loop\nframework, aiming to further enhance foundation model performance with minimal\nhuman efforts. Our experimental results showed that all three foundation models\nimproved over their baselines with model fine-tuning with enriched data.\nInterestingly, the baseline model with the highest F1 score does not yield the\nbest segmentation outcomes after fine-tuning. This study establishes a\nbenchmark for the development and deployment of cell vision foundation models\ntailored for real-world data applications.",

This paper describes the extent to which a\nphysical trajectory of a Brownian particle can be described by a random flight.\nAnalysis of simple timelapses of physical trajectories (calculated over\ncollisional timescales using a velocity autocorrelation function that captures\nthe hydrodynamic and acoustic effects induced by the solvent) gave us two\nobservations: (i) subsampled trajectories become genuinely memoryless only when\nthe time step is ~200 times larger than the relaxation time, and (ii) the\ndistribution of the step lengths has variances that remain significantly\nsmaller than 2Dt (usually by a factor of ~2). This last fact is due to the\ncombination of two effects: diffusional MSD is mathematically superballistic at\nshort timescales and subsampled trajectories are moving averages of the\nunderlying physical trajectory. In other words, the MSD of the physical\ntrajectory at long time intervals asymptotically approaches 2Dt, but the MSD of\nthe subsampled steps does not, even when the associated time interval is\nseveral hundred times larger than the relaxation time.

The\n$q\\bar q$ antenna is created in the presence of a medium and then emits a soft\ngluon outside. The gluon emission probability is modified with respect to the\nvacuum baseline due to interactions with the medium during the formation of the\nantenna and its propagation. Previous studies disregarded the former effect and\nfound that the medium modification to the interference pattern of the antenna\nwas controlled by the so-called critical angle $\\theta_c$, that exclusively\ndepends on medium properties. We find that accounting for medium interactions\nduring the antenna formation enhances the total rate of emissions off the\n$q\\bar q$ antenna. Interestingly, it also promotes the notion of a critical\nangle to a dynamic quantity, denoted $\\tilde\\theta_c$, that depends on both the\nmedium and the antenna properties and is thus different for every splitting.

One significant challenge is\ncorrecting the optics, which becomes increasingly difficult as we target lower\nemittances. In this paper, we investigate optics correction methods to address\nthese challenges. We examined the impact of arc region magnet alignment errors\nin the baseline optics for the FCC-ee lattice at Z energy. To establish\nrealistic alignment tolerances, we developed a sequence of correction steps\nusing the Python Accelerator Toolbox (PyAT) to correct the lattice optics,\nachieve the nominal emittance, Dynamic Aperture (DA), and in the end, the\ndesign luminosity. The correction scheme has been recently optimized and better\nmachine performance demonstrated. A comparison was conducted between two optics\ncorrection approaches: Linear Optics from Closed Orbits (LOCO) with phase\nadvance + $\\eta_x$ and coupling Resonance Driving Terms (RDTs) + $\\eta_y$. The\nlatter method demonstrated better performance in achieving the target emittance\nand enhancing the DA.",

In this work, we show how baryogenesis via Dirac leptogenesis can\nbe implemented in this framework. A pair of left-right symmetric scalar\ndoublets $\\phi_{L,R}$ carrying $(B-L)$ charge of $3$ is introduced for this\npurpose, which preserves the parity solution to the strong CP problem. Small\nneutrino masses are generated through one-loop diagrams mediated by these\nscalars. The decay of vector-like leptons ($E_i$) involved in the seesaw\nmechanism to generate charged lepton masses, $E_i \\rightarrow\n\\overline{\\nu}_{jR} \\,\\phi_R^-$, creates a right-handed neutrino ($\\nu_{R}$)\nasymmetry, while preserving total lepton number.

Patients\nwere grouped as no-RP2 (N = 377, grade <= 1 RP) and RP2 (N = 65, grade >= 2\nRP). Statistical analyses were performed to assess the effect on lung volume\ndefinition on RP2 prediction. Three supervised machine learning (ML) models:\nlogistic regression (LR), k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN), and eXtreme Gradient\nBoosting (XGB), were used to evaluate predictive performance. Model performance\nwas quantified using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve\n(AUC), and statistical significance was tested via a bootstrap analysis.\nShapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) were applied to interpret feature\ncontributions to model predictions. Statistical analyses showed that V20 and\nMLD were significantly associated with RP2, while differences among volume\ndefinitions were not statistically significant. Both kNN and XGB classifiers\nconsistently yielded higher AUC values for the TL-PTV definition compared to\nthe other definitions, a finding supported by bootstrap analysis. SHAP analysis\nfurther indicated that V20 and MLD were the most influential predictors of RP2.\nBoth statistical analysis and SHAP confirmed that V20 and MLD were associated\nwith RP2.

Our\nresearch characterizes the equivalence between equality-constrained nonconvex\noptimization problems and their Lagrangian relaxation, enabling the\naforementioned new technologies to solve these problems.

Further, our approach takes\na comprehensive approach to the question of equivalence between problem\nformulations.

    "abstract": "Decision Transformers have recently emerged as a new and compelling paradigm\nfor offline Reinforcement Learning (RL), completing a trajectory in an\nautoregressive way. While improvements have been made to overcome initial\nshortcomings, online finetuning of decision transformers has been surprisingly\nunder-explored. The widely adopted state-of-the-art Online Decision Transformer\n(ODT) still struggles when pretrained with low-reward offline data. In this\npaper, we theoretically analyze the online-finetuning of the decision\ntransformer, showing that the commonly used Return-To-Go (RTG) that's far from\nthe expected return hampers the online fine-tuning process. This problem,\nhowever, is well-addressed by the value function and advantage of standard RL\nalgorithms. As suggested by our analysis, in our experiments, we hence find\nthat simply adding TD3 gradients to the finetuning process of ODT effectively\nimproves the online finetuning performance of ODT, especially if ODT is\npretrained with low-reward offline data. These findings provide new directions\nto further improve decision transformers.",

We show how our recently published\nthermodynamic framework for ductile phase-field fracture of single crystals can\nbe extended to polycyrstalline structures. A key feature of this framework is\nthat is accounts for size effects by adopting gradient-enhanced (crystal)\nplasticity. Gradient-enhanced plasticity requires the definition of boundary\nconditions representing the plastic slip transmission resistance of the\nboundaries. In this work, we propose a novel type of micro-flexible boundary\ncondition for gradient-plasticity, which couples the slip transmission\nresistance with the phase-field damage such that the resistance locally changes\nduring the fracturing process. The formulation permits to maintain the effect\nof grain boundaries as obstacles for plastic slip during plastification, while\nalso accounting for weakening of their resistance during the softening phase.\nIn numerical experiments, the new damage-dependent boundary condition is\ncompared to classical micro-free and micro-hard boundary conditions in\npolycrystals and it is demonstrated that it indeed produces a response that\ntransitions from micro-hard to micro-free as the material fails. We show that\nthe formulation maintains resistance to slip transmission during hardening, but\ncan generate micro-cracks across grain boundaries during the fracture process.\nWe further show examples of how the model can be used to simulate void\ncoalescence and three-dimensional crack fronts in polycrystals.",

    "abstract": "Schema matching -- the task of finding matches between attributes across\ndisparate data sources with different tables and hierarchies -- is critical for\ncreating interoperable machine learning (ML)-ready data. Addressing this\nfundamental data-centric problem has wide implications, especially in domains\nlike healthcare, finance and e-commerce -- but also has the potential to\nbenefit ML models more generally, by increasing the data available for ML model\ntraining. However, schema matching is a challenging ML task due to\nstructural/hierarchical and semantic heterogeneity between different schemas.\nPrevious ML approaches to automate schema matching have either required\nsignificant labeled data for model training, which is often unrealistic or\nsuffer from poor zero-shot performance. To this end, we propose Matchmaker - a\ncompositional language model program for schema matching, comprised of\ncandidate generation, refinement and confidence scoring. Matchmaker also\nself-improves in a zero-shot manner without the need for labeled demonstrations\nvia a novel optimization approach, which constructs synthetic in-context\ndemonstrations to guide the language model's reasoning process. Empirically, we\ndemonstrate on real-world medical schema matching benchmarks that Matchmaker\noutperforms previous ML-based approaches, highlighting its potential to\naccelerate data integration and interoperability of ML-ready data.",

    "abstract": "We initiate the study of the following general clustering problem. We seek to\npartition a given set $P$ of data points into $k$ clusters by finding a set $X$\nof $k$ centers and assigning each data point to one of the centers. The cost of\na cluster, represented by a center $x\\in X$, is a monotone, symmetric norm $f$\n(inner norm) of the vector of distances of points assigned to $x$. The goal is\nto minimize a norm $g$ (outer norm) of the vector of cluster costs. This\nproblem, which we call $(f,g)$-Clustering, generalizes many fundamental\nclustering problems such as $k$-Center, $k$-Median , Min-Sum of Radii, and\nMin-Load $k$-Clustering . A recent line of research (Chakrabarty, Swamy\n[STOC'19]) studies norm objectives that are oblivious to the cluster structure\nsuch as $k$-Median and $k$-Center. In contrast, our problem models\ncluster-aware objectives including Min-Sum of Radii and Min-Load\n$k$-Clustering.\n  Our main results are as follows. First, we design a constant-factor\napproximation algorithm for $(\\textsf{top}_\\ell,\\mathcal{L}_1)$-Clustering\nwhere the inner norm ($\\textsf{top}_\\ell$) sums over the $\\ell$ largest\ndistances. Second, we design a constant-factor approximation\\ for\n$(\\mathcal{L}_\\infty,\\textsf{Ord})$-Clustering where the outer norm is a convex\ncombination of $\\textsf{top}_\\ell$ norms (ordered weighted norm).",

Our current\nknowledge of NEA sizes and regolith properties is heavily dependent on simple\nthermal models. These models are often used to analyze data from missions such\nas NEOWISE because they are well suited to deal with large volumes of data.\nHowever, simple model results based on NEOWISE data may be inconsistent with\nresults based on other types of observation in some cases. In this work, we\nseek to better understand these potential inconsistencies, as well as the\nsituations for which they are most prevalent. We do this by comparing simple\nmodel results based on Infrared Telescope Facility SpeX data to similar results\nbased on NEOWISE data. This is carried out for six NEAs that represent a range\nof spectral types, shapes, and rotation states. We find that models based on\nSpeX and NEOWISE data for these six objects are inconsistent in some cases,\neven though the SpeX results are consistent with other methods and\nobservations. We find that objects observed at fainter magnitudes and objects\nwith more primitive compositions are more likely to produce inconsistent fits.\nThese results highlight the importance of better understanding the limitations\nof simple models as applied to large survey data sets like NEOWISE.

We model this as a\nmeta-learning process where each task is synchronized with a safeguard that\nmonitors safety and provides a reward signal to the agent. The safeguard is\nimplemented as a finite-state machine based on a safety specification; the\nreward signal is formally shaped around this specification. The safety\nspecification and its corresponding safeguard can be arbitrarily complex and\nnon-Markovian, which adds flexibility to the training process and\nexplainability to the learned policy. The design of the safeguard is manual but\nit is high-level and model-agnostic, which gives rise to an end-to-end safe\nlearning approach with wide applicability, from pixel-level game control to\nlanguage model fine-tuning.

Collecting real data at scale with task centric\nground truth labels, like contact forces and slip, is a challenge further\ncompounded by sensors of various form factor differing in aspects like lighting\nand gel markings. To tackle this we turn to self-supervised learning (SSL) that\nhas demonstrated remarkable performance in computer vision.

We also\nbuild TacBench, to facilitate standardized benchmarking across sensors and\nmodels, comprising of six tasks ranging from comprehending tactile properties\nto enabling physical perception and manipulation planning. In evaluations, we\nfind that SSL pre-training for touch representation outperforms task and\nsensor-specific end-to-end training by 95.1% on average over TacBench, and\nSparsh (DINO) and Sparsh (IJEPA) are the most competitive, indicating the\nmerits of learning in latent space for tactile images.

Evolutionary\nalgorithms are commonly used to solve complex bilevel problems in practical\nscenarios, but they face significant resource consumption challenges due to the\nnested structure imposed by the implicit lower-level optimality condition. This\nchallenge becomes even more pronounced as problem dimensions increase. Although\nrecent methods have enhanced bilevel convergence through task-level knowledge\nsharing, further efficiency improvements are still hindered by redundant\nlower-level iterations that consume excessive resources while generating\nunpromising solutions.

Additionally, a\ncooperation mechanism is integrated within the competitive framework to further\nenhance efficiency and prevent premature convergence.

A simple approach for addressing this\nproblem is to augment the unknown static parameters as auxiliary states that\nare jointly estimated with the time-varying parameters of interest. This can be\nimpractical, especially when the system of interest is high-dimensional.\nMultiple particle filtering (MPF) methods were introduced to try to overcome\nthe curse of dimensionality by using a divide and conquer approach, where the\nvector of unknowns is partitioned into a set of subvectors, each estimated by a\nseparate particle filter. Each particle filter weighs its own particles by\nusing predictions and estimates communicated from the other filters. Currently,\nthere is no principled way to implement MPF methods where the particle filters\nshare unknown parameters or states. In this work, we propose a fusion strategy\nto allow for the sharing of unknown static parameters in the MPF setting.\nSpecifically, we study the systems which are separable in states and\nobservations. It is proved that optimal Bayesian fusion can be obtained for\nstate-space models with non-interacting states and observations.

Furthermore,\nmany structural assumptions are known to suffer from a provably unavoidable\nexponential dependence on the time horizon $H$ in the regret, which makes any\npossible solution unfeasible in practice. In this paper, we identify local\nlinearity as the feature that makes Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) both\nlearnable (sublinear regret) and feasible (regret that is polynomial in $H$).\nWe define a novel MDP representation class, namely Locally Linearizable MDPs,\ngeneralizing other representation classes like Linear MDPs and MDPS with low\ninherent Belmman error. Then, i) we introduce Cinderella, a no-regret algorithm\nfor this general representation class, and ii) we show that all known learnable\nand feasible MDP families are representable in this class. We first show that\nall known feasible MDPs belong to a family that we call Mildly Smooth MDPs.\nThen, we show how any mildly smooth MDP can be represented as a Locally\nLinearizable MDP by an appropriate choice of representation.

Having measures to\ncompare how similar activations of neurons are across conditions,\narchitectures, and species, gives us a scalable way of learning how information\nis transformed within different neural networks. In contrast to this trend,\nrecent investigations have revealed how some metrics can respond to spurious\nsignals and hence give misleading results. To identify the most reliable metric\nand understand how measures could be improved, it is going to be important to\nidentify specific test cases which can serve as benchmarks. Here we propose\nthat the phenomena of compositional learning in recurrent neural networks\n(RNNs) allows us to build a test case for dynamical representation alignment\nmetrics. By implementing this case, we show it enables us to test whether\nmetrics can identify representations which gradually develop throughout\nlearning and probe whether representations identified by metrics are relevant\nto computations executed by networks. By building both an attractor- and\nRNN-based test case, we show that the new Dynamical Similarity Analysis (DSA)\nis more noise robust and identifies behaviorally relevant representations more\nreliably than prior metrics (Procrustes, CKA). We also show how test cases can\nbe used beyond evaluating metrics to study new architectures. Specifically,\nresults from applying DSA to modern (Mamba) state space models, suggest that,\nin contrast to RNNs, these models may not exhibit changes to their recurrent\ndynamics due to their expressiveness.

Through mean field analysis and numerical simulations, we show\nthat emotional group interactions can induce discontinuous phase transitions,\nbistable behavior, and hysteresis loops. However, as the proportion of negative\nedges q increases, the influence of group interactions weakens under a given\ntransmission strength, driving a shift from discontinuous to continuous phase\ntransitions. Our findings reveal that pairwise and group interactions respond\ndifferently to changes in q: group interactions display nonlinear sensitivity,\nwhile pairwise interactions exhibit a more gradual, linear response. This\ndivergence shifts the dominant mechanisms of contagion, depending on the levels\nof trust and distrust in the network, providing deeper insights into how\nemotional relational shape the spread of contagion in social systems.",

We\nobserve that as diffusion models transition from memorization to\ngeneralization, their corresponding nonlinear diffusion denoisers exhibit\nincreasing linearity. This discovery leads us to investigate the linear\ncounterparts of the nonlinear diffusion models, which are a series of linear\nmodels trained to match the function mappings of the nonlinear diffusion\ndenoisers. Surprisingly, these linear denoisers are approximately the optimal\ndenoisers for a multivariate Gaussian distribution characterized by the\nempirical mean and covariance of the training dataset. This finding implies\nthat diffusion models have the inductive bias towards capturing and utilizing\nthe Gaussian structure (covariance information) of the training dataset for\ndata generation. We empirically demonstrate that this inductive bias is a\nunique property of diffusion models in the generalization regime, which becomes\nincreasingly evident when the model's capacity is relatively small compared to\nthe training dataset size. In the case that the model is highly\noverparameterized, this inductive bias emerges during the initial training\nphases before the model fully memorizes its training data.

Recent work has shown that it is possible to recover\nthe latent factors as well as the underlying structural causal model over them,\nup to permutation and scaling, provided that we have at least $d$ environments,\neach of which corresponds to perfect interventions on a single latent node\n(factor). After this powerful result, a key open problem faced by the community\nhas been to relax these conditions: allow for coarser than perfect single-node\ninterventions, and allow for fewer than $d$ of them, since the number of latent\nfactors $d$ could be very large. In this work, we consider precisely such a\nsetting, where we allow a smaller than $d$ number of environments, and also\nallow for very coarse interventions that can very coarsely \\textit{change the\nentire causal graph over the latent factors}.

This subject is currently a highly active. However, viral infections\ninvolving wt, DVGs and other subviral genetic elements, like viral RNA\nsatellites (satRNAs) have received scarce attention.

The resulting O&M problems are typically solved\nusing large-scale mixed integer programming (MIP) models, which yield\ncomputationally challenging problems that require either long-solution times,\nor heuristics to reach a solution. To address this problem, we introduce a\nnovel decision-making framework for wind farm O&M that builds on a multi-head\nattention (MHA) models, an emerging artificial intelligence methods that are\nspecifically designed to learn in rich and complex problem settings. The\ndevelopment of proposed MHA framework incorporates a number of modeling\ninnovations that allows explicit embedding of MIP models within an MHA\nstructure. The proposed MHA model (i) significantly reduces the solution time\nfrom hours to seconds, (ii) guarantees feasibility of the proposed solutions\nconsidering complex constraints that are omnipresent in wind farm O&M, (iii)\nresults in significant solution quality compared to the conventional MIP\nformulations, and (iv) exhibits significant transfer learning capability across\ndifferent problem settings.",

These two fields need to be carefully aligned to minimize\nso-called micromotion, caused by the time-dependent electric field. The purpose\nof this work is to systematically understand the qualitative impact of\nmicromotion on the Rydberg excitation spectrum, when the symmetry axes of the\ntwo electric fields do not coincide.

Previous measurements have inferred the\nprecession frequency by measuring the residual polarization of neutrons after a\nlong period of free precession. This difference provides independent\ninformation on potential unknown systematic uncertainties compared to previous\nand on-going measurements. It is precisely because nEDM@SNS is using a number\nof novel techniques, that it is essential to perform detailed studies of these\ntechniques in order to optimize the statistical sensitivity and minimize the\nsystematic uncertainty. The Systematic and Operational Studies Apparatus (SOSA)\nwas one of the main efforts of nEDM@SNS collaboration, concentrated on\ndevelopment of a cryogenic test-bed for learning precise manipulation of spins\nand studing systematic effects of the proposed new technique.

Current diffusion-based\nimage animation systems exhibit high precision in transferring human identity\ninto targeted motion, yet they still exhibit irregular quality in their\noutputs. Their optimal precision is achieved only when the physical\ncompositions (i.e., scale and rotation) of the human shapes in the reference\nimage and target pose frame are aligned. In the absence of such alignment,\nthere is a noticeable decline in fidelity and consistency. Especially, in\nreal-world environments, this compositional misalignment commonly occurs,\nposing significant challenges to the practical usage of current systems. To\nthis end, we propose Test-time Procrustes Calibration (TPC), which enhances the\nrobustness of diffusion-based image animation systems by maintaining optimal\nperformance even when faced with compositional misalignment, effectively\naddressing real-world scenarios. The TPC provides a calibrated reference image\nfor the diffusion model, enhancing its capability to understand the\ncorrespondence between human shapes in the reference and target images.

These spoofing attacks often\ninvolve unique 3D structures, such as printed papers or mobile device screens.\nAlthough stereo-depth cameras can detect such attacks effectively, their\nhigh-cost limits their widespread adoption. Conversely, two-sensor systems\nwithout extrinsic calibration offer a cost-effective alternative but are unable\nto calculate depth using stereo techniques. In this work, we propose a method\nto overcome this challenge by leveraging facial attributes to derive disparity\ninformation and estimate relative depth for anti-spoofing purposes, using\nnon-calibrated systems. We introduce a multi-modal anti-spoofing model, coined\nDisparity Model, that incorporates created disparity maps as a third modality\nalongside the two original sensor modalities. We demonstrate the effectiveness\nof the Disparity Model in countering various spoof attacks using a\ncomprehensive dataset collected from the Intel RealSense ID Solution F455. Our\nmethod outperformed existing methods in the literature, achieving an Equal\nError Rate (EER) of 1.71% and a False Negative Rate (FNR) of 2.77% at a False\nPositive Rate (FPR) of 1%.

It supports both large\nlanguage models (LLMs) and multimodal models (LMMs) in the same action space.\nAndroidLab benchmark includes predefined Android virtual devices and 138 tasks\nacross nine apps built on these devices. By using the AndroidLab environment,\nwe develop an Android Instruction dataset and train six open-source LLMs and\nLMMs, lifting the average success rates from 4.59% to 21.50% for LLMs and from\n1.93% to 13.28% for LMMs. AndroidLab is open-sourced and publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/THUDM/Android-Lab.",

Nevertheless, prosody is\nrarely studied within the context of speech-to-text translation (S2TT) systems.\nIn particular, end-to-end (E2E) systems have been proposed as well-suited for\nprosody-aware translation because they have direct access to the speech signal\nwhen making translation decisions, but the understanding of whether this is\nsuccessful in practice is still limited. A main challenge is the difficulty of\nevaluating prosody awareness in translation. To address this challenge, we\nintroduce an evaluation methodology and a focused benchmark (named ContraProST)\naimed at capturing a wide range of prosodic phenomena. Our methodology uses\nlarge language models and controllable text-to-speech (TTS) to generate\ncontrastive examples. Through experiments in translating English speech into\nGerman, Spanish, and Japanese, we find that (a) S2TT models possess some\ninternal representation of prosody, but the prosody signal is often not strong\nenough to affect the translations, (b) E2E systems outperform cascades of\nspeech recognition and text translation systems, confirming their theoretical\nadvantage in this regard, and (c) certain cascaded systems also capture\nprosodic information in the translation, but only to a lesser extent that\ndepends on the particulars of the transcript's surface form.",

Although\ndiffusion models have shown remarkable capacity in image synthesis and have\nbeen recently utilized to counter $\\ell_p$-norm bounded attacks, their\npotential in mitigating localized patch attacks remains largely underexplored.\nIn this work, we propose DiffPAD, a novel framework that harnesses the power of\ndiffusion models for adversarial patch decontamination.

Such a design is inspired by the\ntheoretically derived correlation between patch size and diffusion restoration\nerror that is generalized across diverse patch attack scenarios.

    "abstract": "Open-vocabulary 3D object detection (OV-3Det) aims to generalize beyond the\nlimited number of base categories labeled during the training phase. The\nbiggest bottleneck is the scarcity of annotated 3D data, whereas 2D image\ndatasets are abundant and richly annotated. Consequently, it is intuitive to\nleverage the wealth of annotations in 2D images to alleviate the inherent data\nscarcity in OV-3Det. In this paper, we push the task setup to its limits by\nexploring the potential of using solely 2D images to learn OV-3Det. The major\nchallenges for this setup is the modality gap between training images and\ntesting point clouds, which prevents effective integration of 2D knowledge into\nOV-3Det. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework ImOV3D to\nleverage pseudo multimodal representation containing both images and point\nclouds (PC) to close the modality gap. The key of ImOV3D lies in flexible\nmodality conversion where 2D images can be lifted into 3D using monocular depth\nestimation and can also be derived from 3D scenes through rendering. This\nallows unifying both training images and testing point clouds into a common\nimage-PC representation, encompassing a wealth of 2D semantic information and\nalso incorporating the depth and structural characteristics of 3D spatial data.\nWe carefully conduct such conversion to minimize the domain gap between\ntraining and test cases. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets,\nSUNRGBD and ScanNet, show that ImOV3D significantly outperforms existing\nmethods, even in the absence of ground truth 3D training data. With the\ninclusion of a minimal amount of real 3D data for fine-tuning, the performance\nalso significantly surpasses previous state-of-the-art.

    "abstract": "Sequential recommendation (SR) aims to predict items that users may be\ninterested in based on their historical behavior sequences. We revisit SR from\na novel information-theoretic perspective and find that conventional sequential\nmodeling methods fail to adequately capture the randomness and unpredictability\nof user behavior. Inspired by fuzzy information processing theory, this paper\nintroduces the DDSR model, which uses fuzzy sets of interaction sequences to\novercome the limitations and better capture the evolution of users' real\ninterests. Formally based on diffusion transition processes in discrete state\nspaces, which is unlike common diffusion models such as DDPM that operate in\ncontinuous domains. It is better suited for discrete data, using structured\ntransitions instead of arbitrary noise introduction to avoid information loss.\nAdditionally, to address the inefficiency of matrix transformations due to the\nvast discrete space, we use semantic labels derived from quantization or RQ-VAE\nto replace item IDs, enhancing efficiency and improving cold start issues.\nTesting on three public benchmark datasets shows that DDSR outperforms existing\nstate-of-the-art methods in various settings, demonstrating its potential and\neffectiveness in handling SR tasks.",

A hypernucleus, in addition to\nthe nucleons contains at least one hyperon which is a strange particle composed\nof quarks. A hypernucleus is produced mostly in heavy ion collisions and it\nundergoes weak decay. Experimental detection of hypernuclear events are rare\nand this makes the study of hypernuclear physics more challenging. Hypernuclear\nphysics has a close association with astrophysics as hyperon-nucleon and\nhyperon-hyperon interactions are found to play important role in the interiors\nof neutron stars. The core of neutron stars contains strange quark matter and\ntherefore, study of hyperon involved potentials are essential for the\ndetermination of the composition of neutron star matter. But, there is a\nscarcity of data from hyperon-nucleon scattering experiments. Also, since it is\nimpossibe to have hyperon-hyperon scattering experiments, the direct\ndetermination of the baryon-baryon interaction strength is extremely difficult.\nTherefore theoretical models play important role in unfolding the mysteries of\nhyperon-nucleon and hyperon-hyperon interaction. In this study, binding\nenergies of hypernuclear systems calculated using different two-body\nlambda-nucleon and three-body lambda-nucleon-nucleon interactions have been\nanalysed. Also effect of lambda-lambda potential on the binding energy of\nhypernuclear system have been analysed.

(2) Multiple inherent temporal variations (e.g.,\nrising, falling, and fluctuating) entangled in temporal patterns. To this end,\nwe propose Adaptive Multi-Scale Hypergraph Transformer (Ada-MSHyper) for time\nseries forecasting.

In addition, a node and hyperedge\nconstraint mechanism is introduced to cluster nodes with similar semantic\ninformation and differentiate the temporal variations within each scales.\nExtensive experiments on 11 real-world datasets demonstrate that Ada-MSHyper\nachieves state-of-the-art performance, reducing prediction errors by an average\nof 4.56%, 10.38%, and 4.97% in MSE for long-range, short-range, and\nultra-long-range time series forecasting, respectively.

    "abstract": "How to optimally persuade an agent who has a private type? When elicitation\nis feasible, this amounts to a fairly standard principal-agent-style mechanism\ndesign problem, where the persuader employs a mechanism to first elicit the\nagent's type and then plays the corresponding persuasion strategy based on the\nagent's report. The optimal mechanism design problem in this setting is\nrelatively well-understood in the literature, with incentive compatible (IC)\nmechanisms known to be optimal and computationally tractable. In this paper, we\nstudy this problem given a credible agent, i.e., if the agent claims they are\nof a certain type in response to the mechanism's elicitation, then they will\nact optimally with respect to the claimed type, even if they are actually not\nof that type.\n  We present several interesting findings in this new setting that differ\nsignificantly from results in the non-credible setting. In terms of the\nstructure of optimal mechanisms, we show that not only may IC mechanisms fail\nto be optimal, but all mechanisms following the standard\n`eliciting-then-persuading' mechanism design structure may be suboptimal. To\nachieve optimality requires two additional instruments -- pre-signaling and\nnon-binding elicitation -- which naturally result in multi-stage mechanisms. We\ncharacterize optimal mechanisms under these design choices. Based on our\ncharacterization, we provide a polynomial-time algorithm for computing optimal\nmulti-stage mechanisms. We also discover that in scenarios that allow for it,\npartial information elicitation can be employed to improve the principal's\npayoff even further. Though, surprisingly, an unbounded number of rounds of\ninformation exchange between the principal and the agent may be necessary to\nachieve optimality.",

As Industry 5.0 gains traction\nin industrial applications, efficient process monitoring becomes increasingly\ncrucial. However, limited data and the opaque nature of AI present challenges\nfor its application in an industrial setting. JEMA addresses this challenges by\nleveraging multimodal data, including multi-view images and metadata such as\nprocess parameters, to learn transferable semantic representations. By applying\na supervised contrastive loss function, JEMA enables robust learning and\nsubsequent process monitoring using only the primary modality, simplifying\nhardware requirements and computational overhead. We investigate the\neffectiveness of JEMA in LMD process monitoring, focusing specifically on its\ngeneralization to downstream tasks such as melt pool geometry prediction,\nachieved without extensive fine-tuning. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates\nthe high scalability and performance of JEMA, particularly when combined with\nVision Transformer models. We report an 8% increase in performance in\nmultimodal settings and a 1% improvement in unimodal settings compared to\nsupervised contrastive learning. Additionally, the learned embedding\nrepresentation enables the prediction of metadata, enhancing interpretability\nand making possible the assessment of the added metadata's contributions.

The model uses a variable\nnumber of learnable prompts to specify which source to separate, and changes\nits behavior depending on the given prompts, enabling it to handle all the\nmajor separation tasks including contradictory ones. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that the proposed TUSS model successfully handles the five major\nseparation tasks mentioned earlier.

Abt et al.

Here we make use of an 8.6-year photometric data set for Deneb\nfrom the Solar Mass Ejection Imager (SMEI) to better characterize this\nbehavior. We find that the interval between pulsation resumptions is not exact,\nwith the most common intervals between 100 and 120 days. Sometimes one or more\nintervals are skipped.

Except for 6 Cas, the time series are too short, or the observations\ntoo infrequent to draw any conclusions about similarities between the behavior\nof these stars and alpha Cyg. We also summarize results of evolution and\npulsation modeling for Deneb and alpha Cyg variables from the literature. The\nalpha Cyg variables may not be a homogenous group with a common mechanism for\ntheir variability.

In this work, we propose performing gradient\ndescent on the embeddings produced by the first layer of the model. However,\nswitching to discrete inputs with an embedding layer is not a reasonable option\nfor vision models. Thus, we propose the conceptual procedure of (i) a gradient\ndescent step on first layer activations to construct an activation proposal,\nand (ii) finding the optimal weights of the first layer, i.e., those weights\nwhich minimize the squared distance to the activation proposal. We provide a\nclosed form solution of the procedure and adjust it for robust stochastic\ntraining while computing everything efficiently.

To address these challenges, semantic image synthesis methods based on\ngenerative adversarial networks and diffusion models have been developed.\nHowever, these models often yield non-diverse images and fail to capture small,\ncritical tissue classes, limiting their effectiveness. In response, we propose\nthe Class-Aware Semantic Diffusion Model (CASDM), a novel approach which\nutilizes segmentation maps as conditions for image synthesis to tackle data\nscarcity and imbalance. Novel class-aware mean squared error and class-aware\nself-perceptual loss functions have been defined to prioritize critical, less\nvisible classes, thereby enhancing image quality and relevance. Furthermore, to\nour knowledge, we are the first to generate multi-class segmentation maps using\ntext prompts in a novel fashion to specify their contents. These maps are then\nused by CASDM to generate surgical scene images, enhancing datasets for\ntraining and validating segmentation models. Our evaluation, which assesses\nboth image quality and downstream segmentation performance, demonstrates the\nstrong effectiveness and generalisability of CASDM in producing realistic\nimage-map pairs, significantly advancing surgical scene segmentation across\ndiverse and challenging datasets.",

The ${\\sf QIP_{\\rm U}L}$ model, a\nspace-bounded variant of quantum interactive proofs (${\\sf QIP}$) introduced by\nWatrous (CC 2003) and Kitaev and Watrous (STOC 2000), restricts verifier\nactions to unitary circuits. In contrast, ${\\sf QIPL}$ allows logarithmically\nmany pinching intermediate measurements per verifier action, making it the\nweakest model that encompasses the classical model of Condon and Ladner (JCSS\n1995).\n  We characterize the computational power of ${\\sf QIPL}$ and ${\\sf QIP_{\\rm\nU}L}$. When the message number $m$ is polynomially bounded, ${\\sf QIP_{\\rm U}L}\n\\subsetneq {\\sf QIPL}$ unless ${\\sf P} = {\\sf NP}$:\n  - ${\\sf QIPL}^{\\rm HC}$, a subclass of ${\\sf QIPL}$ defined by a\nhigh-concentration condition on yes instances, exactly characterizes ${\\sf\nNP}$.\n  - ${\\sf QIP_{\\rm U}L}$ is contained in ${\\sf P}$ and contains ${\\sf SAC}^1\n\\cup {\\sf BQL}$, where ${\\sf SAC}^1$ denotes problems solvable by classical\nlogarithmic-depth, semi-unbounded fan-in circuits.\n  However, this distinction vanishes when $m$ is constant.

    "abstract": "In a previous paper we showed that any variety with log-terminal\nsingularities admits a crepant resolution by a smooth Artin stack. In this\npaper we prove the converse, thereby proving that a variety admits a crepant\nresolution by a smooth Artin stack if and only if it has log-terminal\nsingularities. Furthermore if $\\mathcal{X} \\to Y$ is such a resolution, we\nobtain a formula for the stringy Hodge numbers of $Y$ in terms of (motivically)\nintegrating an explicit weight function over twisted arcs of $\\mathcal{X}$.\nThat weight function takes only finitely many values, so we believe this result\nprovides a plausible avenue for finding a long-sought cohomological\ninterpretation for stringy Hodge numbers. Using that the resulting integral is\ndefined intrinsically in terms of $\\mathcal{X}$, we also obtain a notion of\nstringy Hodge numbers for smooth Artin stacks, that in particular, recovers\nChen and Ruan's notion of orbifold Hodge numbers.",

Within post-Newtonian theory, we extend previous results for\nnon-spinning binaries to 3.5PN order. Using the gravitational self-force\napproach, we compute the memory at first order in the mass ratio for inspirals\ninto a Kerr black hole. We do this both numerically and via a double\npost-Newtonian--self-force expansion which we carry out to 5PN order. At second\norder in the self-force approach, near-zone calculations encounter an infrared\ndivergence associated with memory, which is resolved through matching the\nnear-zone solution to a post-Minkowskian expansion in the far zone. We describe\nthat matching procedure for the first time and show how it introduces\nnonlocal-in-time memory effects into the two-body dynamics at second order in\nthe mass ratio, as was also predicted by recent 5PN calculations within the\neffective field theory approach. We then compute the gravitational-wave memory\nthrough second order in the mass ratio (excluding certain possible memory\ndistortion effects) and find that it agrees well with recent results from\nnumerical relativity simulations for near-comparable-mass binaries.",

To achieve an accurate and robust\nnumerical solution on a coarse mesh of size $H$, we introduce a\nderivative-orthogonal wavelet-based framework.

    "abstract": "We develop a technique to design efficiently computable estimators for sparse\nlinear regression in the simultaneous presence of two adversaries: oblivious\nand adaptive. We design several robust algorithms that outperform the state of\nthe art even in the special case when oblivious adversary simply adds Gaussian\nnoise. In particular, we provide a polynomial-time algorithm that with high\nprobability recovers the signal up to error $O(\\sqrt{\\varepsilon})$ as long as\nthe number of samples $n \\ge \\tilde{O}(k^2/\\varepsilon)$, only assuming some\nbounds on the third and the fourth moments of the distribution ${D}$ of the\ndesign.\n  In addition, prior to this work, even in the special case of Gaussian design\nand noise, no polynomial time algorithm was known to achieve error\n$o(\\sqrt{\\varepsilon})$ in the sparse setting $n < d^2$. We show that under\nsome assumptions on the fourth and the eighth moments of ${D}$, there is a\npolynomial-time algorithm that achieves error $o(\\sqrt{\\varepsilon})$ as long\nas $n \\ge \\tilde{O}(k^4 / \\varepsilon^3)$. For Gaussian distribution, this\nalgorithm achieves error $O(\\varepsilon^{3/4})$. Moreover, our algorithm\nachieves error $o(\\sqrt{\\varepsilon})$ for all log-concave distributions if\n$\\varepsilon \\le 1/\\text{polylog(d)}$.\n  Our algorithms are based on the filtering of the covariates that uses\nsum-of-squares relaxations, and weighted Huber loss minimization with $\\ell_1$\nregularizer. We provide a novel analysis of weighted penalized Huber loss that\nis suitable for heavy-tailed designs in the presence of two adversaries.\nFurthermore, we complement our algorithmic results with Statistical Query lower\nbounds, providing evidence that our estimators are likely to have nearly\noptimal sample complexity.",

To this end, a simple\nphenomenological model of pseudoelasticity is employed and finite-element\nsimulations are performed to address two key questions.

This limitation stems from a training gap\nwhere pre-training lacks effective instructions for long-text generation, and\npost-training data primarily consists of short query-response pairs. Current\napproaches, such as instruction backtranslation and behavior imitation, face\nchallenges including data quality, copyright issues, and constraints on\nproprietary model usage. In this paper, we introduce an innovative iterative\ntraining framework called Self-Lengthen that leverages only the intrinsic\nknowledge and skills of LLMs without the need for auxiliary data or proprietary\nmodels. The framework consists of two roles: the Generator and the Extender.\nThe Generator produces the initial response, which is then split and expanded\nby the Extender. This process results in a new, longer response, which is used\nto train both the Generator and the Extender iteratively. Through this process,\nthe models are progressively trained to handle increasingly longer responses.\nExperiments on benchmarks and human evaluations show that Self-Lengthen\noutperforms existing methods in long-text generation, when applied to top\nopen-source LLMs such as Qwen2 and LLaMA3.

Unlike metamaterials, which consist of atoms arranged in\nstructured patterns, metafields focus on the patterns of fields alone, allowing\nfor dynamic property adjustments through external electric currents. This study\nexplores a specific metafield where the repeating pattern is the magnetic disk\n(MD), defined by a uniform magnetic field perpendicular to its surface. By\narranging multiple MDs, we form a magnetic disk array (MDA) and theoretically\ninvestigate the charged particle dynamics within this array. Our analysis\nhighlights Hall transport phenomena, such as Hall diffusivity, conductivity,\nand thermal Hall effects. Using complex variables, we derive the collision\nintegral and Boltzmann equation for particle distribution, applying\nperturbation methods and Fourier analysis to calculate transport coefficients.\nSimulations reveal a one-way preferential diffusion at the interface between\nMDAs with opposing field directions, where diffusion intensity varies with the\nparticle movement direction.

This elastic tether is unusual as it creates a\ndisturbance proportional to the multicopter's translational movement. This\npaper takes an observer-based approach to estimate the stiffness coefficient of\nthe cable and uses the system model to update the estimates of the external\nforces, which are then compensated in the control action. Given that the\ntethered cable force affects both horizontal channels of the quadrotor and is\nalso coupled with the vertical channel, the proposed disturbance observer is\nconstructed to exploit the redundant measurements across all three channels to\njointly estimate the cable stiffness and the vertical disturbance. A\npseudo-inverse method is used to determine the observer gain functions, such\nthat the estimation of the two quantities is decoupled and stable. Compared to\nstandard disturbance observers which assume nearly constant disturbances, the\nproposed approach can quickly adjust its total force estimate as the tethered\nquadrotor changes its position or tautness of the tether. This is applied to\ntwo experiments - a tracking performance test where the multicopter moves under\na constant tether strain, and an object extraction test. In the second test,\nthe multicopter manipulates a nonlinear mechanism mimicking the extraction of a\nwedged object. In both cases, the proposed approach shows significant\nimprovement over standard Disturbance Observer and Extended State Observer\napproaches.

The\nmodulations in the azimuthal angles of the sum and difference of the transverse\nmomenta of the pair of particles in the final state, as well as of the\ntransverse impact parameter, arise from the collisions of unpolarized and\npolarized photons. A full description of the cross section in terms of\nGeneralized Transverse Momentum Dependent parton distributions (GTMDs) for\nphotons is given including a careful consideration of the Fourier transform to\nimpact parameter space. In particular, this leads to a feed-in mechanism among\nharmonics of different orders, which in principle generates harmonics of all\n(even) orders. Wherever comparable, our analytical results for the azimuthal\nmodulations agree with those presented in other papers on this topic. Compared\nto these other works, we separate effects that arise from the anisotropies of\nthe GTMDs from those that do not and retain terms proportional to the mass of\nthe produced particles, as they are relevant for muon, charm and bottom quark\nproduction. We show that the normalized differential cross section changes\nconsiderably with the produced particle mass, which should be discernible in\nUPCs at RHIC and LHC. For the numerical results we adopt several models for the\nphoton GTMD correlator, and find that all of them are in fairly good agreement\nwith each other and with UPC data from STAR. We also present results for\nvarious azimuthal modulations for RHIC kinematics, where we compare $e^+ e^-$\nproduction with the production of heavier particles, and for LHC kinematics,\nfocusing on $\\mu^+ \\mu^-$ production.

    "abstract": "Learning Rate Warmup is a popular heuristic for training neural networks,\nespecially at larger batch sizes, despite limited understanding of its\nbenefits. Warmup decreases the update size $\\Delta \\mathbf{w}_t = \\eta_t\n\\mathbf{u}_t$ early in training by using lower values for the learning rate\n$\\eta_t$. In this work we argue that warmup benefits training by keeping the\noverall size of $\\Delta \\mathbf{w}_t$ limited, counteracting large initial\nvalues of $\\mathbf{u}_t$. Focusing on small-scale GPT training with AdamW/Lion,\nwe explore the following question: Why and by which criteria are early updates\n$\\mathbf{u}_t$ too large? We analyze different metrics for the update size\nincluding the $\\ell_2$-norm, resulting directional change, and impact on the\nrepresentations of the network, providing a new perspective on warmup. In\nparticular, we find that warmup helps counteract large angular updates as well\nas a limited critical batch size early in training. Finally, we show that the\nneed for warmup can be significantly reduced or eliminated by modifying the\noptimizer to explicitly normalize $\\mathbf{u}_t$ based on the aforementioned\nmetrics.",

Traditional compression methods, such as\nquantization, often require predefined compression ratios and separate\ncompression processes for each setting, complicating deployment in variable\nmemory environments. In this paper, we introduce \\textbf{BitStack}, a novel,\ntraining-free weight compression approach that enables megabyte-level\ntrade-offs between memory usage and model performance. By leveraging weight\ndecomposition, BitStack can dynamically adjust the model size with minimal\ntransmission between running memory and storage devices. Our approach\niteratively decomposes weight matrices while considering the significance of\neach parameter, resulting in an approximately 1-bit per parameter residual\nblock in each decomposition iteration. These blocks are sorted and stacked in\nstorage as basic transmission units, with different quantities loaded based on\ncurrent memory availability. Extensive experiments across a wide range of tasks\ndemonstrate that, despite offering fine-grained size control, BitStack\nconsistently matches or surpasses strong quantization baselines, particularly\nat extreme compression ratios. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first\ndecomposition-based method that effectively bridges the gap to practical\ncompression techniques like quantization.

Additionally, these methods\noften overlook the specificity of foreground objects, weakening the salience of\nthe objects of interest within the fused images. To address these challenges,\nthis study proposes a novel interactive multi-modal image fusion framework\nbased on the text-modulated diffusion model, called Text-DiFuse. First, this\nframework integrates feature-level information integration into the diffusion\nprocess, allowing adaptive degradation removal and multi-modal information\nfusion. This is the first attempt to deeply and explicitly embed information\nfusion within the diffusion process, effectively addressing compound\ndegradation in image fusion. Second, by embedding the combination of the text\nand zero-shot location model into the diffusion fusion process, a\ntext-controlled fusion re-modulation strategy is developed. This enables\nuser-customized text control to improve fusion performance and highlight\nforeground objects in the fused images. Extensive experiments on diverse public\ndatasets show that our Text-DiFuse achieves state-of-the-art fusion performance\nacross various scenarios with complex degradation.

Existing methods that\nrely on aligning visual encoders with large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to\ntap into the extensive knowledge of VLMs, require large, computationally\nexpensive models and encounter training difficulties. Adapting VLMs with prompt\nlearning offers an alternative to direct alignment. However, fine-tuning on\ntask-specific datasets often leads to overfitting to seen classes and\nsuboptimal performance on unseen classes, due to the absence of unseen class\nlabels. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel prompt learning-based\nframework for Efficient Zero-Shot HOI detection (EZ-HOI). First, we introduce\nLarge Language Model (LLM) and VLM guidance for learnable prompts, integrating\ndetailed HOI descriptions and visual semantics to adapt VLMs to HOI tasks.\nHowever, because training datasets contain seen-class labels alone, fine-tuning\nVLMs on such datasets tends to optimize learnable prompts for seen classes\ninstead of unseen ones. Therefore, we design prompt learning for unseen classes\nusing information from related seen classes, with LLMs utilized to highlight\nthe differences between unseen and related seen classes. Quantitative\nevaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our EZ-HOI achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance across various zero-shot settings with only 10.35%\nto 33.95% of the trainable parameters compared to existing methods.

There are many potential causes of hallucination, of\nwhich, one hypothesis is that fine-tuning a model on data produced by a larger\nmodel leads to a knowledge mismatch which contributes to hallucination. In\nparticular, it is hypothesized that there is a mismatch between the knowledge\nthat is fed to the model to fine-tune it and the knowledge that is already\npresent in the graph. Fine-tuning the model on data that has such mismatch\ncould contribute to an increased propensity to hallucinate.

Our analysis shows that initially, blue galaxies are more common in\nclusters followed by filaments, sheets and voids. However, this trend reverses\nat lower redshifts, with red fractions rising earlier in denser environments.\nAt $z<1$, most massive galaxies ($\\log(\\frac{M_{*}}{M_{\\odot}})>10.5$) are\nquenched across all environments. In contrast, low-mass galaxies\n($\\log(\\frac{M_{*}}{M_{\\odot}})<10.5$) are more influenced by their\nenvironment, with clusters hosting the highest red galaxy fractions at low\nredshifts. We observe a slower mass growth for low-mass galaxies in clusters at\n$z<1$. Filaments show relative red fractions (RRF) comparable to clusters at\nlow masses, but host nearly $60\\%$ of low-mass blue galaxies, representing a\ndiverse galaxy population.

    "abstract": "Clouds in satellite imagery pose a significant challenge for downstream\napplications. A major challenge in current cloud removal research is the\nabsence of a comprehensive benchmark and a sufficiently large and diverse\ntraining dataset. To address this problem, we introduce the largest public\ndataset -- $\\textit{AllClear}$ for cloud removal, featuring 23,742 globally\ndistributed regions of interest (ROIs) with diverse land-use patterns,\ncomprising 4 million images in total. Each ROI includes complete temporal\ncaptures from the year 2022, with (1) multi-spectral optical imagery from\nSentinel-2 and Landsat 8/9, (2) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery from\nSentinel-1, and (3) auxiliary remote sensing products such as cloud masks and\nland cover maps. We validate the effectiveness of our dataset by benchmarking\nperformance, demonstrating the scaling law -- the PSNR rises from $28.47$ to\n$33.87$ with $30\\times$ more data, and conducting ablation studies on the\ntemporal length and the importance of individual modalities. This dataset aims\nto provide comprehensive coverage of the Earth's surface and promote better\ncloud removal results.",

    "abstract": "In an evolving landscape of crisis communication, the need for robust and\nadaptable Machine Translation (MT) systems is more pressing than ever,\nparticularly for low-resource languages. This study presents a comprehensive\nexploration of leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multilingual LLMs\n(MLLMs) to enhance MT capabilities in such scenarios. By focusing on the unique\nchallenges posed by crisis situations where speed, accuracy, and the ability to\nhandle a wide range of languages are paramount, this research outlines a novel\napproach that combines the cutting-edge capabilities of LLMs with fine-tuning\ntechniques and community-driven corpus development strategies. At the core of\nthis study is the development and empirical evaluation of MT systems tailored\nfor two low-resource language pairs, illustrating the process from initial\nmodel selection and fine-tuning through to deployment. Bespoke systems are\ndeveloped and modelled on the recent Covid-19 pandemic. The research highlights\nthe importance of community involvement in creating highly specialised,\ncrisis-specific datasets and compares custom GPTs with NLLB-adapted MLLM\nmodels. It identifies fine-tuned MLLM models as offering superior performance\ncompared with their LLM counterparts. A scalable and replicable model for rapid\nMT system development in crisis scenarios is outlined.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable reasoning capabilities on\ncomplex tasks, but they still suffer from out-of-date knowledge,\nhallucinations, and opaque decision-making. In contrast, Knowledge Graphs (KGs)\ncan provide explicit and editable knowledge for LLMs to alleviate these issues.\nExisting paradigm of KG-augmented LLM manually predefines the breadth of\nexploration space and requires flawless navigation in KGs. However, this\nparadigm cannot adaptively explore reasoning paths in KGs based on the question\nsemantics and self-correct erroneous reasoning paths, resulting in a bottleneck\nin efficiency and effect. To address these limitations, we propose a novel\nself-correcting adaptive planning paradigm for KG-augmented LLM named\nPlan-on-Graph (PoG), which first decomposes the question into several\nsub-objectives and then repeats the process of adaptively exploring reasoning\npaths, updating memory, and reflecting on the need to self-correct erroneous\nreasoning paths until arriving at the answer. Specifically, three important\nmechanisms of Guidance, Memory, and Reflection are designed to work together,\nto guarantee the adaptive breadth of self-correcting planning for graph\nreasoning. Finally, extensive experiments on three real-world datasets\ndemonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of PoG.",

While randomness is often employed as a defensive\nstrategy against adversarial examples, our research reveals that this approach\ncan sometimes backfire, particularly when facing adaptive attackers using\nreinforcement learning (RL). Our findings show that in specific cases,\nespecially with visually noisy classes, the introduction of noise in the\nclassifier's confidence values can be exploited by the RL attacker, leading to\na significant increase in evasion success rates. In some instances, the\nnoise-based defense scenario outperformed other strategies by up to 20\\% on a\nsubset of classes.

This--seemingly simple--task has led to\na rich literature and has become well known in the context of the US House of\nRepresentatives. In this paper, we connect the design of monotone apportionment\nmethods to classic problems from discrete geometry and combinatorial\noptimization and explore the extent to which randomization can enhance\nproportionality.\n  We first focus on the well-studied family of stationary divisor methods,\nwhich satisfy the strong population monotonicity property, and show that this\nfamily produces only a slightly superlinear number of different outputs as a\nfunction of the number of states. While our upper and lower bounds leave a\nsmall gap, we show that--surprisingly--closing this gap would solve a\nlong-standing open problem from discrete geometry, known as the complexity of\n$k$-levels in line arrangements. The main downside of divisor methods is their\nviolation of the quota axiom, i.e., every state should receive $\\lfloor\nq_i\\rfloor$ or $\\lceil q_i\\rceil$ seats, where $q_i$ is the proportional share\nof the state. As we show that randomizing over divisor methods can only\npartially overcome this issue, we propose a relaxed version of divisor methods\nin which the total number of seats may slightly deviate from the house size. By\nrandomizing over them, we can simultaneously satisfy population monotonicity,\nquota, and ex-ante proportionality.\n  Finally, we turn our attention to quota-compliant methods that are\nhouse-monotone, i.e., no state may lose a seat when the house size is\nincreased. We provide a polyhedral characterization based on network flows,\nwhich implies a simple description of all ex-ante proportional randomized\nmethods that are house-monotone and quota-compliant.",

In this work, we comprehensively\nred team the safety of five advanced audio LMMs under three settings: (i)\nharmful questions in both audio and text formats, (ii) harmful questions in\ntext format accompanied by distracting non-speech audio, and (iii)\nspeech-specific jailbreaks. Our results under these settings demonstrate that\nopen-source audio LMMs suffer an average attack success rate of 69.14% on\nharmful audio questions, and exhibit safety vulnerabilities when distracted\nwith non-speech audio noise. Our speech-specific jailbreaks on Gemini-1.5-Pro\nachieve an attack success rate of 70.67% on the harmful query benchmark. We\nprovide insights on what could cause these reported safety-misalignments.\nWarning: this paper contains offensive examples.",

We construct NoRa dataset that is tailored to evaluate the robustness\nof reasoning in the presence of noisy rationales. Our findings on NoRa dataset\nreveal a prevalent vulnerability to such noise among current LLMs, with\nexisting robust methods like self-correction and self-consistency showing\nlimited efficacy. Notably, compared to prompting with clean rationales, base\nLLM drops by 1.4%-19.8% in accuracy with irrelevant thoughts and more\ndrastically by 2.2%-40.4% with inaccurate thoughts.\n  Addressing this challenge necessitates external supervision that should be\naccessible in practice. Here, we propose the method of contrastive denoising\nwith noisy chain-of-thought (CD-CoT). It enhances LLMs' denoising-reasoning\ncapabilities by contrasting noisy rationales with only one clean rationale,\nwhich can be the minimal requirement for denoising-purpose prompting. This\nmethod follows a principle of exploration and exploitation: (1) rephrasing and\nselecting rationales in the input space to achieve explicit denoising and (2)\nexploring diverse reasoning paths and voting on answers in the output space.\nEmpirically, CD-CoT demonstrates an average improvement of 17.8% in accuracy\nover the base model and shows significantly stronger denoising capabilities\nthan baseline methods.

Automatic airway\nanatomical labeling is challenging due to significant individual variability\nand anatomical variations. Previous methods are prone to generate inconsistent\npredictions, which is harmful for preoperative planning and intraoperative\nnavigation. This paper aims to address these challenges by proposing a novel\nmethod that enhances topological consistency and improves the detection of\nabnormal airway branches. We propose a novel approach incorporating two\nmodules: the Soft Subtree Consistency (SSC) and the Abnormal Branch Saliency\n(ABS). The SSC module constructs a soft subtree to capture clinically relevant\ntopological relationships, allowing for flexible feature aggregation within and\nacross subtrees. The ABS module facilitates the interaction between node\nfeatures and prototypes to distinguish abnormal branches, preventing the\nerroneous aggregation of features between normal and abnormal nodes. Evaluated\non a challenging dataset characterized by severe airway distortion and atrophy,\nour method achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art\napproaches. Specifically, it attains a 91.4% accuracy at the segmental level\nand an 83.7% accuracy at the subsegmental level, representing a 1.4% increase\nin subsegmental accuracy and a 3.1% increase in topological consistency.\nNotably, the method demonstrates reliable performance in cases with\ndisease-induced airway deformities, ensuring consistent and accurate labeling.",

    "abstract": "The detection and clearance of explosive ordnance (EO) continues to be a\npredominantly manual and high-risk process that can benefit from advances in\ntechnology to improve its efficiency and effectiveness. Research on artificial\nintelligence (AI) for EO detection in clearance operations has grown\nsignificantly in recent years. However, this research spans a wide range of\nfields, making it difficult to gain a comprehensive understanding of current\ntrends and developments. Therefore, this article provides a literature review\nof academic research on AI for EO detection in clearance operations. It finds\nthat research can be grouped into two main streams: AI for EO object detection\nand AI for EO risk prediction, with the latter being much less studied than the\nformer. From the literature review, we develop three opportunities for future\nresearch. These include a call for renewed efforts in the use of AI for EO risk\nprediction, the combination of different AI systems and data sources, and novel\napproaches to improve EO risk prediction performance, such as pattern-based\npredictions. Finally, we provide a perspective on the future of AI for EO\ndetection in clearance operations. We emphasize the role of traditional machine\nlearning (ML) for this task, the need to dynamically incorporate expert\nknowledge into the models, and the importance of effectively integrating AI\nsystems with real-world operations.",

The editing objects of previous methods (e.g., MEMIT) were\nsingle token or entity, which were not suitable for commonsense knowledge in\nfree-text form. To address the aforementioned challenges, we conducted\nexperiments from two perspectives: knowledge localization and knowledge\nediting. Firstly, we introduced Knowledge Localization for Free-Text(KLFT)\nmethod, revealing the challenges associated with the distribution of\ncommonsense knowledge in MLP and Attention layers, as well as in decentralized\ndistribution. Next, we propose a Dynamics-aware Editing Method(DEM), which\nutilizes a Dynamics-aware Module to locate the parameter positions\ncorresponding to commonsense knowledge, and uses Knowledge Editing Module to\nupdate knowledge. The DEM method fully explores the potential of the MLP and\nAttention layers, and successfully edits commonsense knowledge based on\nfree-text.

    "abstract": "Knowledge editing technology has received widespread attention for low-cost\nupdates of incorrect or outdated knowledge in large-scale language models.\nHowever, recent research has found that edited models often exhibit varying\ndegrees of performance degradation. The reasons behind this phenomenon and\npotential solutions have not yet been provided. In order to investigate the\nreasons for the performance decline of the edited model and optimize the\nediting method, this work explores the underlying reasons from both data and\nmodel perspectives. Specifically, 1) from a data perspective, to clarify the\nimpact of data on the performance of editing models, this paper first\nconstructs a Multi-Question Dataset (MQD) to evaluate the impact of different\ntypes of editing data on model performance. The performance of the editing\nmodel is mainly affected by the diversity of editing targets and sequence\nlength, as determined through experiments. 2) From a model perspective, this\narticle explores the factors that affect the performance of editing models. The\nresults indicate a strong correlation between the L1-norm of the editing model\nlayer and the editing accuracy, and clarify that this is an important factor\nleading to the bottleneck of editing performance. Finally, in order to improve\nthe performance of the editing model, this paper further proposes a Dump for\nSequence (D4S) method, which successfully overcomes the previous editing\nbottleneck by reducing the L1-norm of the editing layer, allowing users to\nperform multiple effective edits and minimizing model damage.

Another previously seen idea is to use the Bellman error as a\nseparate optimization objective for exploration.

State-of-the-art models for such data are not designed to infer\nthese unique structures. In contrast to such solutions we develop a\ncomputationally-tractable Bayesian zero-inflated Poisson stochastic block model\n(ZIP-SBM), which identifies groups of redundant criminals with similar\nconnectivity patterns, and infers both overt and covert block interactions\nwithin and across such groups. This is accomplished by modeling weighted ties\n(corresponding to counts of interactions among pairs of criminals) via\nzero-inflated Poisson distributions with block-specific parameters that\nquantify complex patterns in the excess of zero ties in each block (security)\nrelative to the distribution of the observed weighted ties within that block\n(efficiency).

    "abstract": "The active flux (AF) method is a compact high-order finite volume method that\nsimultaneously evolves cell averages and point values at cell interfaces.\nWithin the method of lines framework, the existing Jacobian splitting-based\npoint value update incorporates the upwind idea but suffers from a stagnation\nissue for nonlinear problems due to inaccurate estimation of the upwind\ndirection, and also from a mesh alignment issue partially resulting from\ndecoupled point value updates. This paper proposes to use flux vector splitting\nfor the point value update, offering a natural and uniform remedy to those two\nissues. To improve robustness, this paper also develops bound-preserving (BP)\nAF methods for hyperbolic conservation laws. Two cases are considered:\npreservation of the maximum principle for the scalar case, and preservation of\npositive density and pressure for the compressible Euler equations. The update\nof the cell average is rewritten as a convex combination of the original\nhigh-order fluxes and robust low-order (local Lax-Friedrichs or Rusanov)\nfluxes, and the desired bounds are enforced by choosing the right amount of\nlow-order fluxes. A similar blending strategy is used for the point value\nupdate. In addition, a shock sensor-based limiting is proposed to enhance the\nconvex limiting for the cell average, which can suppress oscillations well.\nSeveral challenging tests are conducted to verify the robustness and\neffectiveness of the BP AF methods, including flow past a forward-facing step\nand high Mach number jets.",

This calculation can be\nexpressed as an integral over Euclidean time of a current-current correlator\n$G(t)$, where $G(t)$ can be calculated using lattice QCD or, with dispersion\nrelations, from experimental data for $e^+e^-\\to\\mbox{hadrons}$. The BMW/DMZ\ncollaboration recently presented a hybrid approach in which $G(t)$ is\ncalculated using lattice QCD for most of the contributing $t$ range, but using\nexperimental data for the largest $t$ (lowest energy) region. Here we study the\nadvantages of varying the position $t=t_1$ separating lattice QCD from\ndata-driven contributions. The total LOHVP contribution should be independent\nof $t_1$, providing both a test of the experimental input and the robustness of\nthe hybrid approach. We use this criterion and a correlated fit to show that\nFermilab/HPQCD/MILC lattice QCD results from 2019 strongly favour the CMD-3\ncross-section data for $e^+e^-\\to\\pi^+\\pi^-$ over a combination of earlier\nexperimental results for this channel. Further, the resulting total LOHVP\ncontribution obtained is consistent with the result obtained by BMW/DMZ, and\nsupports the scenario in which there is no significant discrepancy between the\nexperimental value for $a_\\mu$ and that expected in the Standard Model. We then\ndiscuss how improved lattice results in this hybrid approach could provide a\nmore accurate total LOHVP across a wider range of $t_1$ values with an\nuncertainty that is smaller than that from either lattice QCD or data-driven\napproaches on their own.",

In this work, we investigate\nfor the first time whether such models are suitable for the specific domain of\nface recognition (FR). We further propose and demonstrate the adaptation of\nthese models for FR across different levels of data availability, including\nsynthetic data. Extensive experiments are conducted on multiple foundation\nmodels and datasets of varying scales for training and fine-tuning, with\nevaluation on a wide range of benchmarks. Our results indicate that, despite\ntheir versatility, pre-trained foundation models tend to underperform in FR in\ncomparison with similar architectures trained specifically for this task.\nHowever, fine-tuning foundation models yields promising results, often\nsurpassing models trained from scratch, particularly when training data is\nlimited. For example, after fine-tuning only on 1K identities, DINOv2 ViT-S\nachieved average verification accuracy on LFW, CALFW, CPLFW, CFP-FP, and\nAgeDB30 benchmarks of 87.10%, compared to 64.70% achieved by the same model and\nwithout fine-tuning. While training the same model architecture, ViT-S, from\nscratch on 1k identities reached 69.96%. With access to larger-scale FR\ntraining datasets, these performances reach 96.03% and 95.59% for the DINOv2\nand CLIP ViT-L models, respectively. In comparison to the ViT-based\narchitectures trained from scratch for FR, fine-tuned same architectures of\nfoundation models achieve similar performance while requiring lower training\ncomputational costs and not relying on the assumption of extensive data\navailability. We further demonstrated the use of synthetic face data, showing\nimproved performances over both pre-trained foundation and ViT models.",

With the advent of ultra-short high-intensity lasers capable of\naccelerating electrons to GeV levels, it has become possible to generate muons\nin laser laboratories. In this work, we show the first proof of principle\nexperiment for novel muon production with an ultra-short, high-intensity laser\ndevice through GeV electron beam bombardment on a lead converter target. The\nmuon physical signal is confirmed by measuring its lifetime which is the first\nclear demonstration of laser-produced muons. Geant4 simulations were employed\nto investigate the photo-production, electro-production, and Bethe-Heitler\nprocesses response for muon generation and their subsequent detection. The\nresults show that the dominant contributions of muons are attributed to the\nphoto-production/electro-production and a significant yield of muons up to 0.01\n$\\mu$/$e^-$ out of the converter target could be achieved. This laser muon\nsource features compact, ultra-short pulse and high flux.

In this paper, we introduce a new task named\nChange Detection Question Answering and Grounding (CDQAG), which extends the\ntraditional change detection task by providing interpretable textual answers\nand intuitive visual evidence. To this end, we construct the first CDQAG\nbenchmark dataset, termed QAG-360K, comprising over 360K triplets of questions,\ntextual answers, and corresponding high-quality visual masks. It encompasses 10\nessential land-cover categories and 8 comprehensive question types, which\nprovides a valuable and diverse dataset for remote sensing applications.\nFurthermore, we present VisTA, a simple yet effective baseline method that\nunifies the tasks of question answering and grounding by delivering both visual\nand textual answers.

We show a quantum oracle\nseparation between UniqueQMA and QMA via an extension of the\nAaronson-Kuperberg's QCMA vs QMA oracle separation. In particular, we show that\nany UniqueQMA protocol must make $\\Omega(\\sqrt{D})$ queries to a subspace phase\noracle of unknown dimension $\\leq D$ to \"find\" the subspace. This presents an\nobstacle to relativizing techniques in resolving this question (unlike its\nclassical analogue - the Valiant-Vazirani theorem - which is essentially a\nblack-box reduction) and suggests the need to study the structure of the ground\nspace of local Hamiltonians in distilling a potential unique witness. Our\ntechniques also yield a quantum oracle separation between QXC, the class\ncharacterizing quantum approximate counting, and QMA.\n  Very few structural properties are known that place the complexity of local\nHamiltonians in UniqueQMA. We expand this set of properties by showing that the\nground energy of local Hamiltonians that satisfy the eigenstate thermalization\nhypothesis (ETH) can be estimated through a UniqueQMA protocol. Specifically,\nour protocol can be viewed as a quantum expander test in a low energy subspace\nof the Hamiltonian and verifies a unique entangled state in two copies of the\nsubspace. This allows us to conclude that if UniqueQMA $\\neq$ QMA, then\nQMA-hard Hamiltonians must violate ETH under adversarial perturbations (more\naccurately, under the quantum PCP conjecture if ETH only applies to extensive\nenergy subspaces). Our results serve as evidence that chaotic local\nHamiltonians, such as the SYK model, contain polynomial verifiable quantum\nstates in their low energy regime and may be simpler than general local\nHamiltonians if UniqueQMA $\\neq$ QMA.",

The diameter ${\\rm diam}(F(P))$ of this graph is subject of\nintensive study. For points in general position, it is between $3n/2-5$ and\n$2n-4$, with no improvement for 25 years. For points in convex position, it\nlies between $3n/2 - 5$ and $\\approx1.95n$, where the lower bound was\nconjectured to be tight up to an additive constant and the upper bound is a\nrecent breakthrough improvement over several bounds of the form $2n-o(n)$.\n  In this work, we provide new upper and lower bounds on ${\\rm diam}(F(P))$,\nmainly focusing on points in convex position. We show $14n/9 - O(1) \\le {\\rm\ndiam}(F(P)) \\le 5n/3 - 3$, by this disproving the conjectured upper bound of\n$3n/2$ for convex position, and relevantly improving both the long-standing\nlower bound for general position and the recent new upper bound for convex\nposition. We complement these by showing that if one of $T,T'$ has at most two\nboundary edges, then ${\\rm dist}(T,T') \\le 2d/2 < 3n/2$, where $d = |T-T'|$ is\nthe number of edges in one tree that are not in the other.\n  To prove both the upper and the lower bound, we introduce a new powerful\ntool. Specifically, we convert the flip distance problem for given $T,T'$ to\nthe problem of a largest acyclic subset in an associated conflict graph\n$H(T,T')$. In fact, this method is powerful enough to give an equivalent\nformulation of the diameter of $F(P)$ for points $P$ in convex position up to\nlower-order terms. As such, conflict graphs are likely the key to a complete\nresolution of this and possibly also other reconfiguration problems.",

    "abstract": "The concept of probabilistic values, such as Beta Shapley values and weighted\nBanzhaf values, has gained recent attention in applications like feature\nattribution and data valuation. However, exact computation of these values is\noften exponentially expensive, necessitating approximation techniques. Prior\nresearch has shown that the choice of probabilistic values significantly\nimpacts downstream performance, with no universally superior option.\nConsequently, one may have to approximate multiple candidates and select the\nbest-performing one. Although there have been many efforts to develop efficient\nestimators, none are intended to approximate all probabilistic values both\nsimultaneously and efficiently. In this work, we embark on the first\nexploration of achieving this goal. Adhering to the principle of maximum sample\nreuse, we propose a one-sample-fits-all framework parameterized by a sampling\nvector to approximate intermediate terms that can be converted to any\nprobabilistic value without amplifying scalars. Leveraging the concept of $\n(\\epsilon, \\delta) $-approximation, we theoretically identify a key formula\nthat effectively determines the convergence rate of our framework. By\noptimizing the sampling vector using this formula, we obtain i) a one-for-all\nestimator that achieves the currently best time complexity for all\nprobabilistic values on average, and ii) a faster generic estimator with the\nsampling vector optimally tuned for each probabilistic value. Particularly, our\none-for-all estimator achieves the fastest convergence rate on Beta Shapley\nvalues, including the well-known Shapley value, both theoretically and\nempirically. Finally, we establish a connection between probabilistic values\nand the least square regression used in (regularized) datamodels, showing that\nour one-for-all estimator can solve a family of datamodels simultaneously.",

In the recent era,\nskeleton-based HAR has received much attention because skeleton data has shown\nthat it can handle changes in striking, body size, camera views, and complex\nbackgrounds. One key characteristic of ST-GCN is automatically learning spatial\nand temporal patterns from skeleton sequences. It has some limitations, as this\nmethod only works for short-range correlation due to its limited receptive\nfield. Consequently, understanding human action requires long-range\ninterconnection. To address this issue, we developed a spatial-temporal\nrelative transformer ST-RTR model. The ST-RTR includes joint and relay nodes,\nwhich allow efficient communication and data transmission within the network.\nThese nodes help to break the inherent spatial and temporal skeleton\ntopologies, which enables the model to understand long-range human action\nbetter. Furthermore, we combine ST-RTR with a fusion model for further\nperformance improvements. To assess the performance of the ST-RTR method, we\nconducted experiments on three skeleton-based HAR benchmarks: NTU RGB+D 60, NTU\nRGB+D 120, and UAV-Human. It boosted CS and CV by 2.11 % and 1.45% on NTU RGB+D\n60, 1.25% and 1.05% on NTU RGB+D 120. On UAV-Human datasets, accuracy improved\nby 2.54%. The experimental outcomes explain that the proposed ST-RTR model\nsignificantly improves action recognition associated with the standard ST-GCN\nmethod.",

    "abstract": "Spin-polarized two-dimensional electron gases (2DEGs) are of particular\ninterest for functional oxide electronics applications. The redox-created 2DEG\nresiding on the strontium titanate, SrTiO$_3$ (STO), side of a europium\nmonoxide (EuO)/SrTiO$_3$ (001) interface is expected to be significantly\nspin-polarized due to the proximity to the strong ($7\\,\\mu_B/f.u.$) Heisenberg\nferromagnet EuO. We apply magnetic circular dichroism in the angular\ndistribution (MCDAD) of photoemitted electrons to investigate whether and how\nthe induced spin polarization of the 2DEG depends on the dimensionality of the\noverlaying EuO layer. The experimental data are complemented by density\nfunctional theory calculations with a Hubbard $U$ term (DFT+$U$). We show that\nthe EuO/STO interfacial 2DEG is spin-polarized even for ultrathin EuO\noverlayers, starting at an EuO threshold thickness of only two monolayers.\nAdditional EuO monolayers even increase the induced magnetic Ti moment and thus\nthe spin polarization of the 2DEG. Our results and the potential to enhance the\nmagnetic order of EuO by other proximity effects indicate that the EuO/STO\n(001) interface is an ideal template for creating (multi-)functional\nspin-polarized 2DEGs for application in oxide electronics.",

    "abstract": "A volumetric lattice Boltzmann (LB) method is developed for the\nparticle-resolved direct numerical simulation of thermal particulate flows with\nconjugate heat transfer. This method is devised as a single-domain approach by\napplying the volumetric interpretation of the LB equation and introducing a\nsolid fraction field to represent the particle. The volumetric LB scheme is\nemployed to enforce the nonslip velocity condition in the solid domain, and a\nspecialized momentum exchange scheme is proposed to calculate the hydrodynamic\nforce and torque acting on the particle. To uniformly solve the temperature\nfield over the entire domain with high numerical fidelity, an energy\nconservation equation is first derived by reformulating the convection term\ninto a source term. A corresponding LB equation is then devised to\nautomatically achieve the conjugate heat transfer condition and correctly\nhandle the differences in thermophysical properties. Theoretical analysis of\nthis LB equation is also performed to derive the constraints to preserve the\nnumerical fidelity even near the solid-fluid interface. Numerical tests are\nfirst performed to validate the present volumetric LB method in various\naspects. Then, the sedimentation of a cold particle with conjugate heat\ntransfer in a long channel is investigated. It is found that the sedimentation\nprocess can be divided into the accelerating, decelerating, and equilibrium\nstages. As a further application to dense particulate flows, the sedimentation\nof 2048 cold particles with conjugate heat transfer in a square cavity is\nsimulated. The particulate Rayleigh-B\\'{e}nard convection is successfully\ncaptured in this particle-resolved simulation.",

However, existing\nclustering coefficients for hypergraphs treat each hyperedge as a distinct unit\nrather than a collection of potentially related node pairs, failing to capture\nintra-hyperedge pairwise relationships and incorrectly assigning zero values to\nnodes with meaningful clustering patterns. We propose a novel clustering\ncoefficient that addresses this fundamental limitation by transforming\nhypergraphs into weighted graphs, where edge weights reflect relationship\nstrength between nodes based on hyperedge connections. Our definition satisfies\nthree key conditions: values in the range $[0,1]$, consistency with simple\ngraph clustering coefficients, and effective capture of intra-hyperedge\npairwise relationships -- a capability absent from existing approaches.\nTheoretical evaluation on higher-order motifs demonstrates that our definition\ncorrectly assigns values to motifs where existing definitions fail (motifs III,\nIV-a, IV-b of order 3), while empirical evaluation on three real-world datasets\nshows similar overall clustering tendencies with more detailed measurements,\nespecially for hypergraphs with larger hyperedges. The proposed clustering\ncoefficient enables accurate quantification of local density in complex\nnetworks, revealing structural characteristics missed by existing definitions\nin systems where group membership implies connections between members, such as\nsocial communities and co-authorship networks.",

The jamming scalings reflect a compressible effective force\nnetwork formed by contact and quasi-contact gaps, while non-contact gaps that\ndo not participate in the effective force network are incompressible.

Irrespective of\nsnoring types, most snoring instances exhibit identifiable harmonic patterns\nmanifested through distinctive energy distributions over time. In this work, we\npropose a novel method to differentiate monaural snoring from non-snoring\nsounds by analyzing the harmonic content of the input sound using\nharmonic/percussive sound source separation (HPSS). The resulting feature,\nbased on the harmonic spectrogram from HPSS, is employed as input data for\nconventional neural network architectures, aiming to enhance snoring detection\nperformance even under a limited data learning framework. To evaluate the\nperformance of our proposal, we studied two different scenarios: 1) using a\nlarge dataset of snoring and interfering sounds, and 2) using a reduced\ntraining set composed of around 1% of the data material. In the former\nscenario, the proposed HPSS-based feature provides competitive results compared\nto other input features from the literature. However, the key advantage of the\nproposed method lies in the superior performance of the harmonic spectrogram\nderived from HPSS in a limited data learning context. In this particular\nscenario, using the proposed harmonic feature significantly enhances the\nperformance of all the studied architectures in comparison to the classical\ninput features documented in the existing literature. This finding clearly\ndemonstrates that incorporating harmonic content enables more reliable learning\nof the essential time-frequency characteristics that are prevalent in most\nsnoring sounds, even in scenarios where the amount of training data is limited.",

Since discrete signals are inherently\nmore resilient to the effects of perturbations, this discrete class of\nentanglement observables may offer an advantage against noise. Establishing\nthis is the primary objective of this paper. We develop a noise model that\nexploits the specific form of such topological wave functions - an entangled\nstate of two photons with one in an orbital angular momentum state and the\nother in a polarization state. We show that noise affecting both photons can be\nrecast as a position-dependent perturbation affecting only the photon in the\npolarization state. This approach allows us to utilize both the language and\nconcepts used in studying noisy qubits, as well as recent advances in quantum\npolarimetry. By adding noise to a finite-dimensional Hilbert space of\npolarization states, we can describe the noise using quantum operations\nexpressed through appropriate Krauss operators, whose structure is determined\nby quantum polarimetry. For non-depolarizing noise, we provide an argument\nbased on homotopic maps that demonstrates the topology's resilience to noise.\nFor depolarizing noise, numerical studies using the quantum channel description\nshow that the discrete entanglement signal remains completely resilient.\nFinally, we identify sources of local noise that can destabilize the topology.\nThis foundational work establishes a framework for understanding how topology\nenhances the resilience of quantum information, directly impacting the\ndistribution of information through entanglement in noisy environments, such as\nquantum computers and quantum networks.",

    "abstract": "Transformer-based Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) have shown more\npotential than CNN-based DPMs, yet their extensive computational requirements\nhinder widespread practical applications. To reduce the computation budget of\ntransformer-based DPMs, this work proposes the Efficient Diffusion Transformer\n(EDT) framework. The framework includes a lightweight-design diffusion model\narchitecture, and a training-free Attention Modulation Matrix and its\nalternation arrangement in EDT inspired by human-like sketching. Additionally,\nwe propose a token relation-enhanced masking training strategy tailored\nexplicitly for EDT to augment its token relation learning capability. Our\nextensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of EDT. The EDT framework\nreduces training and inference costs and surpasses existing transformer-based\ndiffusion models in image synthesis performance, thereby achieving a\nsignificant overall enhancement. With lower FID, EDT-S, EDT-B, and EDT-XL\nattained speed-ups of 3.93x, 2.84x, and 1.92x respectively in the training\nphase, and 2.29x, 2.29x, and 2.22x respectively in inference, compared to the\ncorresponding sizes of MDTv2.

This paper addresses this gap\nby developing an approach that leverages the rich information encoded in the\ngraph structure of predicted classes to enhance the interpretability of\nconformal sets. Using a motivating example from genomics, specifically\nimaging-based spatial transcriptomics data and single-cell RNA sequencing data,\nwe demonstrate how incorporating graph-structured constraints can improve the\ninterpretation of cell type predictions.

    "abstract": "Models with Conditional Moment Restrictions (CMRs) are popular in economics.\nThese models involve finite and infinite dimensional parameters. The infinite\ndimensional components include conditional expectations, conditional choice\nprobabilities, or policy functions, which might be flexibly estimated using\nMachine Learning tools. This paper presents a characterization of locally\ndebiased moments for regular models defined by general semiparametric CMRs with\npossibly different conditioning variables. These moments are appealing as they\nare known to be less affected by first-step bias. Additionally, we study their\nexistence and relevance. Such results apply to a broad class of smooth\nfunctionals of finite and infinite dimensional parameters that do not\nnecessarily appear in the CMRs. As a leading application of our theory, we\ncharacterize debiased machine learning for settings of treatment effects with\nendogeneity, giving necessary and sufficient conditions. We present a large\nclass of relevant debiased moments in this context. We then propose the\nCompliance Machine Learning Estimator (CML), based on a practically convenient\northogonal relevant moment. We show that the resulting estimand can be written\nas a convex combination of conditional local average treatment effects (LATE).\nAltogether, CML enjoys three appealing properties in the LATE framework: (1)\nlocal robustness to first-stage estimation, (2) an estimand that can be\nidentified under a minimal relevance condition, and (3) a meaningful causal\ninterpretation. Our numerical experimentation shows satisfactory relative\nperformance of such an estimator. Finally, we revisit the Oregon Health\nInsurance Experiment, analyzed by Finkelstein et al. (2012).

Rather than resorting to input sampling or token dropping, which may\nresult in information loss, token merging shows promising results when used in\ncollaboration with transformers. However, the application of token merging for\nlong-form video processing is not trivial. We begin with the premise that token\nmerging should not rely solely on the similarity of video tokens; the saliency\nof tokens should also be considered. To address this, we explore various video\ntoken merging strategies for long-form video classification, starting with a\nsimple extension of image token merging, moving to region-concentrated merging,\nand finally proposing a learnable video token merging (VTM) algorithm that\ndynamically merges tokens based on their saliency.

A\ncomparison of these spectra with the theoretically predicted ones revealed that\nthe experimental spectra significantly exceed the theoretical ones. We show\nthat the excess of photons in the experimental spectra was caused by\ncontributions of new mechanisms for the photon production in $pd$ collisions,\nwhich are due to the existence of $d_{6q}$. The mechanisms comprise the process\n$p+d_{6q}\\to p^\\prime+d_{6q}^\\star$, where $p^\\prime$ is the scattered proton\nand $d_{6q}^\\star$ is the $d_{6q}$ excited state, which has the total energy\nbelow the threshold for its decay by pion emission and the quantum numbers\nforbidden for the $NN$ system, that experiences then either the radiative decay\n$d_{6q}^\\star\\to p+n+\\gamma$ or $d_{6q}^\\star\\to d+\\gamma$.

In this\nstudy, we reevaluate and streamline this framework by hypothesizing that\ntext-to-image DiTs inherently possess in-context generation capabilities,\nrequiring only minimal tuning to activate them. Through diverse task\nexperiments, we qualitatively demonstrate that existing text-to-image DiTs can\neffectively perform in-context generation without any tuning.

    "abstract": "Radio propagation modeling is essential in telecommunication research, as\nradio channels result from complex interactions with environmental objects.\nRecently, Machine Learning has been attracting attention as a potential\nalternative to computationally demanding tools, like Ray Tracing, which can\nmodel these interactions in detail. However, existing Machine Learning\napproaches often attempt to learn directly specific channel characteristics,\nsuch as the coverage map, making them highly specific to the frequency and\nmaterial properties and unable to fully capture the underlying propagation\nmechanisms. Hence, Ray Tracing, particularly the Point-to-Point variant,\nremains popular to accurately identify all possible paths between transmitter\nand receiver nodes. Still, path identification is computationally intensive\nbecause the number of paths to be tested grows exponentially while only a small\nfraction is valid. In this paper, we propose a Machine Learning-aided Ray\nTracing approach to efficiently sample potential ray paths, significantly\nreducing the computational load while maintaining high accuracy. Our model\ndynamically learns to prioritize potentially valid paths among all possible\npaths and scales linearly with scene complexity. Unlike recent alternatives,\nour approach is invariant with translation, scaling, or rotation of the\ngeometry, and avoids dependency on specific environment characteristics.",

But often,\npredicting the target variable requires interactions between several features\n(such as in the XOR function), and features might have complex statistical\ndependencies that allow to partially replace one feature with another one. In\ncommonly used feature importance scores these cooperative effects are conflated\nwith the features' individual contributions, making them prone to\nmisinterpretations.

While recent approaches have extended the context windows\nof LLMs and employed perplexity (PPL) as a standard evaluation metric, PPL has\nproven unreliable for assessing long-context capabilities. The underlying cause\nof this limitation has remained unclear. In this work, we provide a\ncomprehensive explanation for this issue. We find that PPL overlooks key\ntokens, which are essential for long-context understanding, by averaging across\nall tokens and thereby obscuring the true performance of models in long-context\nscenarios. To address this, we propose \\textbf{LongPPL}, a novel metric that\nfocuses on key tokens by employing a long-short context contrastive method to\nidentify them. Our experiments demonstrate that LongPPL strongly correlates\nwith performance on various long-context benchmarks (e.g., Pearson correlation\nof -0.96), significantly outperforming traditional PPL in predictive accuracy.\nAdditionally, we introduce \\textbf{LongCE} (Long-context Cross-Entropy) loss, a\nre-weighting strategy for fine-tuning that prioritizes key tokens, leading to\nconsistent improvements across diverse benchmarks. In summary, these\ncontributions offer deeper insights into the limitations of PPL and present\neffective solutions for accurately evaluating and enhancing the long-context\ncapabilities of LLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/PKU-ML/LongPPL.",

    "abstract": "The star tracker is generally affected by the atmospheric background light\nand the aerodynamic environment when working in near space, which results in\nmissing stars or false stars. Moreover, high-speed maneuvering may cause star\ntrailing, which reduces the accuracy of the star position. To address the\nchallenges for starmap identification, a reverse attitude statistics based\nmethod is proposed to handle position noise, false stars, and missing stars.\nConversely to existing methods which match before solving for attitude, this\nmethod introduces attitude solving into the matching process, and obtains the\nfinal match and the correct attitude simultaneously by frequency statistics.\nFirstly, based on stable angular distance features, the initial matching is\nobtained by utilizing spatial hash indexing. Then, the dual-vector attitude\ndetermination is introduced to calculate potential attitude. Finally, the star\npairs are accurately matched by applying a frequency statistics filtering\nmethod. In addition, Bayesian optimization is employed to find optimal\nparameters under the impact of noises, which is able to enhance the algorithm\nperformance further. In this work, the proposed method is validated in\nsimulation, field test and on-orbit experiment. Compared with the\nstate-of-the-art, the identification rate is improved by more than 14.3%, and\nthe solving time is reduced by over 28.5%.",

    "abstract": "Group Recommendation (GR), which aims to recommend items to groups of users,\nhas become a promising and practical direction for recommendation systems. This\npaper points out two issues of the state-of-the-art GR models. (1) The\npre-defined and fixed number of user groups is inadequate for real-time\nindustrial recommendation systems, where the group distribution can shift\ndynamically. (2) The training schema of existing GR methods is supervised,\nnecessitating expensive user-group and group-item labels, leading to\nsignificant annotation costs. To this end, we present a novel unsupervised\ngroup recommendation framework named \\underline{I}dentify \\underline{T}hen\n\\underline{R}ecommend (\\underline{ITR}), where it first identifies the user\ngroups in an unsupervised manner even without the pre-defined number of groups,\nand then two pre-text tasks are designed to conduct self-supervised group\nrecommendation. Concretely, at the group identification stage, we first\nestimate the adaptive density of each user point, where areas with higher\ndensities are more likely to be recognized as group centers. Then, a heuristic\nmerge-and-split strategy is designed to discover the user groups and decision\nboundaries. Subsequently, at the self-supervised learning stage, the\npull-and-repulsion pre-text task is proposed to optimize the user-group\ndistribution. Besides, the pseudo group recommendation pre-text task is\ndesigned to assist the recommendations. Extensive experiments demonstrate the\nsuperiority and effectiveness of ITR on both user recommendation (e.g., 22.22\\%\nNDCG@5 $\\uparrow$) and group recommendation (e.g., 22.95\\% NDCG@5 $\\uparrow$).\nFurthermore, we deploy ITR on the industrial recommender and achieve promising\nresults.",

If the violation of this\ndescription in nuclear collisions has been accepted for long -- with several\nhadronic observables finding a natural interpretation assuming some form of\nrecombination of partons from a deconfined medium -- this same occurrence came\nas a surprise in proton-proton collisions. Actually, strong indications that\nhadronization cannot be simply described by universal fragmentation\nfractions/functions were already found in fixed-target experiments, but limited\nto specific kinematic regions close to the beam rapidity, so that a complete\nchange of paradigm did not look necessary. Here we show that a wide set of\nobservables finds a natural interpretation assuming that in all high-energy\nhadronic collisions, from pp to AA, a deconfined medium is formed, acting as a\nreservoir in which a parton can undergo local color neutralization (LCN)\nthrough recombination with an opposite color charge.

    "abstract": "Ejection fraction (EF) of the left ventricle (LV) is considered as one of the\nmost important measurements for diagnosing acute heart failure and can be\nestimated during cardiac ultrasound acquisition. While recent successes in deep\nlearning research successfully estimate EF values, the proposed models often\nlack an explanation for the prediction. However, providing clear and intuitive\nexplanations for clinical measurement predictions would increase the trust of\ncardiologists in these models. In this paper, we explore predicting EF\nmeasurements with Natural Language Explanation (NLE). We propose a model that\nin a single forward pass combines estimation of the LV contour over multiple\nframes, together with a set of modules and routines for computing various\nmotion and shape attributes that are associated with ejection fraction. It then\nfeeds the attributes into a large language model to generate text that helps to\nexplain the network's outcome in a human-like manner. We provide experimental\nevaluation of our explanatory output, as well as EF prediction, and show that\nour model can provide EF comparable to state-of-the-art together with\nmeaningful and accurate natural language explanation to the prediction.

We are specifically interested in how fast vs. slow\nthinking affects the layer-wise gradients, given the recent popularity of\ntraining LLMs on reasoning paths such as chain-of-thoughts (CoT) and process\nrewards. In our study, fast thinking without CoT leads to larger gradients and\nlarger differences of gradients across layers than slow thinking (Detailed\nCoT), indicating the learning stability brought by the latter. Additionally, we\nstudy whether the gradient patterns can reflect the correctness of responses\nwhen training different LLMs using slow vs. fast thinking paths. The results\nshow that the gradients of slow thinking can distinguish correct and irrelevant\nreasoning paths. As a comparison, we conduct similar gradient analyses on\nnon-reasoning knowledge learning tasks, on which, however, trivially increasing\nthe response length does not lead to similar behaviors of slow thinking.

However, this advantage comes at the cost of resource\nefficiency, as Tri-Planes are not the most computationally efficient option. In\nthis paper, we introduce Fused-Planes, a new planar architecture that improves\nTri-Planes resource-efficiency in the framework of learning large sets of\nscenes, which we call \"multi-scene inverse graphics\". To learn a large set of\nscenes, our method divides it into two subsets and operates as follows: (i) we\ntrain the first subset of scenes jointly with a compression model, (ii) we use\nthat compression model to learn the remaining scenes. This compression model\nconsists of a 3D-aware latent space in which Fused-Planes are learned, enabling\na reduced rendering resolution, and shared structures across scenes that reduce\nscene representation complexity. Fused-Planes present competitive resource\ncosts in multi-scene inverse graphics, while preserving Tri-Planes rendering\nquality, and maintaining their widely favored planar structure.

Traditional segmentation\nmethods struggle to address these challenges, making deep learning approaches,\nparticularly U-shaped architectures, increasingly prominent. However, the\nquadratic complexity of standard self-attention makes Transformers\ncomputationally prohibitive for high-resolution images.

    "abstract": "As a challenging vision-language task, Zero-Shot Composed Image Retrieval\n(ZS-CIR) is designed to retrieve target images using bi-modal (image+text)\nqueries. Typical ZS-CIR methods employ an inversion network to generate\npseudo-word tokens that effectively represent the input semantics. However, the\ninversion-based methods suffer from two inherent issues: First, the task\ndiscrepancy exists because inversion training and CIR inference involve\ndifferent objectives. Second, the modality discrepancy arises from the input\nfeature distribution mismatch between training and inference. To this end, we\npropose a lightweight post-hoc framework, consisting of two components: (1) A\nnew text-anchored triplet construction pipeline leverages a large language\nmodel (LLM) to transform a standard image-text dataset into a triplet dataset,\nwhere a textual description serves as the target of each triplet. (2) The\nMoTa-Adapter, a novel parameter-efficient fine-tuning method, adapts the dual\nencoder to the CIR task using our constructed triplet data. Specifically, on\nthe text side, multiple sets of learnable task prompts are integrated via a\nMixture-of-Experts (MoE) layer to capture task-specific priors and handle\ndifferent types of modifications. On the image side, MoTa-Adapter modulates the\ninversion network's input to better match the downstream text encoder. In\naddition, an entropy-based optimization strategy is proposed to assign greater\nweight to challenging samples, thus ensuring efficient adaptation.

Second, we sketch several models\nall of which are biologically motivated extensions of the Asymmetric Simple\nExclusion Process (ASEP); some of these models represent the traffic of\nmolecular machines, like RNA polymerase (RNAP) and ribosome, that catalyze\ntemplate-directed polymerization of RNA and proteins, respectively, whereas few\nother models capture the key features of the traffic of ants on trails.

Our research explores two approaches: (i)\ndistinguishing human-written texts from LLM-generated ones, and (ii) detecting\nLLM-generated intervals in Human-Machine collaborative texts. For the first\ntask, our approach utilizes a general-purpose LLM, leveraging its extensive\nlanguage abilities to fine-tune efficiently for the downstream task of\nLLM-generated text detection, achieving high performance even with limited\ndata. For the second task, we propose a novel approach that combines computer\nvision and natural language processing techniques. Specifically, we use a\nfine-tuned general-purpose LLM in conjunction with a DETR-like detection model,\nadapted from computer vision, to localize AI-generated intervals within text.\n  We evaluate the GigaCheck on five classification datasets with English texts\nand three datasets designed for Human-Machine collaborative text analysis.

This empirical work\npresents a paradigm shift: Evolving Alignment via Asymmetric Self-Play (eva),\nthat casts post-training as an infinite game with regret-based signals for 2\nplayers: (i) a creator, who strategically samples and creates new informative\nprompts and (ii) a solver, who learns to produce preferred responses. eva is\nthe first method that allows language models to adaptively create training\nprompts in both offline and online RL post-training. The design is simple,\neasy-to-use yet remarkably effective: eva sets a new SOTA on challenging\nbenchmarks, without any extra human prompts, e.g. it boosts the win-rate of\ngemma-2-9b-it on Arena-Hard by 51.6% -> 60.1% for DPO and 52.6% -> 62.4% for\nRLOO, surpassing claude-3-opus and catching up to gemini-1.5-pro, both of which\nare orders of magnitude larger.

Simulations under open\ncircuit conditions revealed that controlling the standard states of carriers\ncan enhance the open circuit voltage without changing the carrier\nconcentration. Furthermore, distributing recombination rates conventionally\nconcentrated in the vicinity of the interface into the bulk region, such as\nwithin the absorbing layer, improves the open circuit voltage. Our results also\nshowed that changing the carrier distribution in the dark to that under\nillumination, in other words, transition from an equilibrium to a steady state,\nis governed by drift rather than diffusion. This means that the electric field,\nwhich induces drift, is a primary driving force for carrier separation.\nConsequently, by optimizing the electric field distribution depending on\nproperties of recombination-causing defects, a higher short circuit current\ndensity can be achieved, even without chemical passivation of defects. This\nwork offers fundamental insights into reduction of steady-state recombination\nrates through precise control of carrier concentration, chemical potential, and\nelectric field distributions.",

However, previous works have two main defects.\nFirst, they are inadequate in capturing modality-shared features considering\nthe significant gap between text sequences and molecule graphs. Second, they\nmainly rely on contrastive learning and adversarial training for cross-modality\nalignment, both of which mainly focus on the first-order similarity, ignoring\nthe second-order similarity that can capture more structural information in the\nembedding space. To address these issues, we propose a novel cross-modal\ntext-molecule retrieval model with two-fold improvements. Specifically, on the\ntop of two modality-specific encoders, we stack a memory bank based feature\nprojector that contain learnable memory vectors to extract modality-shared\nfeatures better. More importantly, during the model training, we calculate four\nkinds of similarity distributions (text-to-text, text-to-molecule,\nmolecule-to-molecule, and molecule-to-text similarity distributions) for each\ninstance, and then minimize the distance between these similarity distributions\n(namely second-order similarity losses) to enhance cross-modal alignment.\nExperimental results and analysis strongly demonstrate the effectiveness of our\nmodel.

For perturbative theories, estimates of the first\nneglected order offer valuable guidance, but one is often interested in sharp\nbounds beyond which perturbation theory necessarily fails. In particle physics,\nit is common to employ the bounds on partial waves imposed by unitarity as such\na diagnostic. Unfortunately, these bounds don't extend to curved spacetime,\nwhere scattering experiments are challenging to define. Here, we propose to use\nthe growth of entanglement in momentum space as a breakdown diagnostic for\nperturbation theory in general field theories. This diagnostic can be readily\nused in cosmological spacetimes and does not require any flat spacetime limit.\nMore in detail, we consider the so-called purity of the reduced density\noperator constructed by tracing out all but one of the Fourier modes in an\neffective theory and we present a diagrammatic technique to compute it\nperturbatively. Constraints on the regime of validity of perturbation theory\nare then derived when the perturbative purity violates its unitarity bounds.\n  In flat spacetime, we compare these purity bounds to those from partial\nwaves. We find general qualitative agreement but with remarkable differences:\npurity bounds can be sometimes weaker, but other times they exist when no\npartial wave bounds exist. We then derive purity bounds for scalar field\ntheories in de Sitter spacetime for a variety of interactions that appear in\ninflationary models.

To enable\noffline feedback with rich knowledge and reasoning paths, we use knowledge\ngraphs (e.g., Wikidata5m) to provide feedback on the generated chain of\nthoughts. Due to the heterogeneity between LLM reasoning and KG structures,\ndirect interaction and feedback from KGs on LLM behavior are challenging, as\nthey require accurate entity linking and grounding of LLM-generated chains of\nthought in the KG. To address the above challenge, we propose an offline\nchain-of-thought evaluation framework, OCEAN, which models chain-of-thought\nreasoning in LLMs as an MDP and evaluate the policy's alignment with KG\npreference modeling. To overcome the reasoning heterogeneity and grounding\nproblems, we leverage on-policy KG exploration and RL to model a KG policy that\ngenerates token-level likelihood distributions for LLM-generated\nchain-of-thought reasoning paths, simulating KG reasoning preference. Then we\nincorporate the knowledge-graph feedback on the validity and alignment of the\ngenerated reasoning paths into inverse propensity scores and propose KG-IPS\nestimator. Theoretically, we prove the unbiasedness of the proposed KG-IPS\nestimator and provide a lower bound on its variance.

    "abstract": "This work explores conditions under which multi-finger grasping algorithms\ncan attain robust sim-to-real transfer. While numerous large datasets\nfacilitate learning generative models for multi-finger grasping at scale,\nreliable real-world dexterous grasping remains challenging, with most methods\ndegrading when deployed on hardware. An alternate strategy is to use\ndiscriminative grasp evaluation models for grasp selection and refinement,\nconditioned on real-world sensor measurements. This paradigm has produced\nstate-of-the-art results for vision-based parallel-jaw grasping, but remains\nunproven in the multi-finger setting. In this work, we find that existing\ndatasets and methods have been insufficient for training discriminitive models\nfor multi-finger grasping. To train grasp evaluators at scale, datasets must\nprovide on the order of millions of grasps, including both positive and\nnegative examples, with corresponding visual data resembling measurements at\ninference time. To that end, we release a new, open-source dataset of 3.5M\ngrasps on 4.3K objects annotated with RGB images, point clouds, and trained\nNeRFs. Leveraging this dataset, we train vision-based grasp evaluators that\noutperform both analytic and generative modeling-based baselines on extensive\nsimulated and real-world trials across a diverse range of objects. We show via\nnumerous ablations that the key factor for performance is indeed the evaluator,\nand that its quality degrades as the dataset shrinks, demonstrating the\nimportance of our new dataset.

A systematic\nmethod is provided to construct parametric ancillary bases by the von Neumann\nequation with the time-dependent system Hamiltonian. The resulting universal\npassages set up connections between arbitrary initial and target states. In\napplications, a transitionless dynamics can be formulated to entangle distant\nqubits, as a crucial prerequisite for practical quantum networks. Using tunable\nlongitudinal interaction between distant qubits and driving frequency, the\nsuperconducting qubits can be prepared from the ground state to the\nsingle-excitation Bell state with a fidelity as high as $\\mathcal{F}=0.997$ and\nbe further converted to the double-excitation Bell state with\n$\\mathcal{F}=0.982$. Moreover, our protocol is extended to generate the\nGreenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state for an $N$-qubit system with $N$ steps.

Prompt\nlearning offers a parameter-efficient finetuning framework that can adapt CLIP\nto downstream tasks even when limited annotation data are available. In this\npaper, we improve prompt learning by distilling the textual knowledge from\nnatural language prompts (either human- or LLM-generated) to provide rich\npriors for those under-represented concepts. We first obtain a prompt\n``summary'' aligned to each input image via a learned prompt aggregator. Then\nwe jointly train a prompt generator, optimized to produce a prompt embedding\nthat stays close to the aggregated summary while minimizing task loss at the\nsame time. We dub such prompt embedding as Aggregate-and-Adapted Prompt\nEmbedding (AAPE). AAPE is shown to be able to generalize to different\ndownstream data distributions and tasks, including vision-language\nunderstanding tasks (e.g., few-shot classification, VQA) and generation tasks\n(image captioning) where AAPE achieves competitive performance. We also show\nAAPE is particularly helpful to handle non-canonical and OOD examples.\nFurthermore, AAPE learning eliminates LLM-based inference cost as required by\nbaselines, and scales better with data and LLM model size.",

    "abstract": "In a time-division broadcast positioning system (TDBPS), localizing mobile\ntargets using classical time difference of arrival (TDOA) methods poses\nsignificant challenges. Concurrent TDOA measurements are infeasible because\ntargets receive signals from different anchors and extract their transmission\ntimes at different reception times, as well as at varying positions.\nTraditional TDOA estimation schemes implicitly assume that the target remains\nstationary during the measurement period, which is impractical for mobile\ntargets exhibiting high dynamics. Existing methods for mobile target\nlocalization are mostly specialized and rely on motion modeling and do not rely\non the concurrent TDOA measurements. This issue limits their direct use of the\nwell-established classical TDOA-based localization methods and complicating the\nentire localization process. In this paper, to obtain concurrent TDOA estimates\nat any instant out of the sequential measurements for direct use of existing\nTDOA-based localization methods, we propose a novel TDOA estimation method,\ntermed parameterized TDOA (P-TDOA). By approximating the time-varying TDOA as a\npolynomial function over a short period, we transform the TDOA estimation\nproblem into a model parameter estimation problem and derive the desired TDOA\nestimates thereafter. Theoretical analysis shows that, under certain\nconditions, the proposed P-TDOA method closely approaches the Cramer-Rao Lower\nBound (CRLB) for TDOA estimation in concurrent measurement scenarios, despite\nmeasurements being obtained sequentially. Extensive numerical simulations\nvalidate our theoretical analysis and demonstrate the effectiveness of the\nproposed method, highlighting substantial improvements over existing approaches\nacross various scenarios.",

However, existing\napproaches to DTs often struggle to generalize to unseen conditions in\ndata-scarce settings, a crucial requirement for such models. To address these\nlimitations, our work begins by establishing the essential desiderata for\neffective DTs. Hybrid Digital Twins ($\\textbf{HDTwins}$) represent a promising\napproach to address these requirements, modeling systems using a composition of\nboth mechanistic and neural components. This hybrid architecture simultaneously\nleverages (partial) domain knowledge and neural network expressiveness to\nenhance generalization, with its modular design facilitating improved\nevolvability. While existing hybrid models rely on expert-specified\narchitectures with only parameters optimized on data, $\\textit{automatically}$\nspecifying and optimizing HDTwins remains intractable due to the complex search\nspace and the need for flexible integration of domain priors. To overcome this\ncomplexity, we propose an evolutionary algorithm ($\\textbf{HDTwinGen}$) that\nemploys Large Language Models (LLMs) to autonomously propose, evaluate, and\noptimize HDTwins. Specifically, LLMs iteratively generate novel model\nspecifications, while offline tools are employed to optimize emitted\nparameters.

While experiments on\nBell inequality violations have been theoretically well-established and\nextensively conducted to implement various quantum information technologies in\nlaboratory settings, mathematical modeling for accurately predicting the\ndistribution of high-intensity entangled photon pairs in high-loss environments\nremains an issue that requires further research. As the brightness of the\nentangled photon pairs increases, the influence of multi-photon effects becomes\nmore significant, leading to a decrease in the CHSH value $S$ and also a\nreduction in the standard deviation of the CHSH value $\\Delta S$. Therefore, a\nnew analysis of the $(S-2)/\\Delta S$ value is required to more precisely\nconfirm the degree of CHSH inequality violation including the reliability of\n$S$.

    "abstract": "Message passing plays a vital role in graph neural networks (GNNs) for\neffective feature learning. However, the over-reliance on input topology\ndiminishes the efficacy of message passing and restricts the ability of GNNs.\nDespite efforts to mitigate the reliance, existing study encounters\nmessage-passing bottlenecks or high computational expense problems, which\ninvokes the demands for flexible message passing with low complexity. In this\npaper, we propose a novel dynamic message-passing mechanism for GNNs. It\nprojects graph nodes and learnable pseudo nodes into a common space with\nmeasurable spatial relations between them. With nodes moving in the space,\ntheir evolving relations facilitate flexible pathway construction for a dynamic\nmessage-passing process. Associating pseudo nodes to input graphs with their\nmeasured relations, graph nodes can communicate with each other intermediately\nthrough pseudo nodes under linear complexity. We further develop a GNN model\nnamed $\\mathtt{\\mathbf{N^2}}$ based on our dynamic message-passing mechanism.\n$\\mathtt{\\mathbf{N^2}}$ employs a single recurrent layer to recursively\ngenerate the displacements of nodes and construct optimal dynamic pathways.\nEvaluation on eighteen benchmarks demonstrates the superior performance of\n$\\mathtt{\\mathbf{N^2}}$ over popular GNNs. $\\mathtt{\\mathbf{N^2}}$ successfully\nscales to large-scale benchmarks and requires significantly fewer parameters\nfor graph classification with the shared recurrent layer.",

In this paper, we introduce\na novel goal hijacking attack method called Pseudo-Conversation Injection,\nwhich leverages the weaknesses of LLMs in role identification within\nconversation contexts. Specifically, we construct the suffix by fabricating\nresponses from the LLM to the user's initial prompt, followed by a prompt for a\nmalicious new task.

    "abstract": "Mechanical action of various kinds of waves have been known for several\ncenturies. The first tide of scientific interest in wave-induced forces and\ntorques emerged at the end of the 19th / beginning of the 20th centuries, with\nthe development of wave theories and the concepts of wave momentum and angular\nmomentum. A second tide appeared in the past several decades, connected to\ntechnological breakthroughs: the creation of lasers and the controlled\ngeneration of structured wavefields. This resulted in several important\ndiscoveries: optical trapping and manipulation of small particles, from atomic\nto micro sizes, as well as acoustic and acoustofluidic manipulation and sorting\nof larger particles, including biological cells and samples. Here we provide a\nunifying review of optical and acoustic forces and torques on various\nparticles, addressing both their theoretical fundamentals and the main\napplications. Our approach employs the universal connection between the local\nenergy, momentum, and spin densities in the wave fields and the principal\nforces and torques on small Rayleigh particles. Moreover, we describe the most\nimportant cases of nontrivial forces and complex particles: lateral and pulling\nforces, chiral and anisotropic particles, etc. We also describe the main\nexperimental achievements and applications related to optical and acoustic\nforces and torques in structured wave fields. Our goal is to illuminate the\ncommon fundamental origin and close interconnections between the mechanical\nactions of optical and acoustic fields, in order to facilitate their profound\nunderstanding and the further development of optomechanical and\nacoustomechanical applications.",

    "abstract": "Recently, Nagib et al (2024} utilized indicator functions of profiles of the\nstreamwise normal stress to reveal the ranges of validity, in wall distance and\nReynolds number, for each of two proposed models in DNS of channel and pipe\nflows. A method more suited to experimental data is proposed here, as\nestablishing accurate indicator functions is a challenge. The new method is\noutlined and used with the two leading models that propose either a logarithmic\nor power trend, for the normal stresses of turbulence in a fitting region of\nwall-bounded flows. The method, which is simple and robust, is used to evaluate\neach model over a wide range of Reynolds numbers by applying it to two of the\nprominent experimental data sets in zero-pressure-gradient boundary layers\n(ZPG) and pipe flows. A somewhat larger exponent for the power trend equal to\n0.28, instead of 0.25, is found to slightly extend its range of validity.\nCorrecting for outer intermittency in ZPG data also extends validity of the\npower trend to around half the boundary layer thickness. Projecting near-wall\npeak normal-stress values using both models based on data from locations in the\nfitting region, yields nearly identical results up to the highest Re available\nfrom these two experiments.Neither model directly represents the inner peak\nvalues and differ by as much as 30%. However, the two relations provide\nprojected values at Re=10M with a relative difference of approximately 6.2%;\ndistinguishing between these values would require measurement accuracy well\nbeyond our capabilities. Current results and those of Monkewitz and Nagib\n(2023) on the mean flow, suggest that considerations of nonlinear growth of\neddies from the wall and accounting for some viscous effects, are important for\nmodeling wall-bounded flows. Such effects also apply to potential refinements\nof the logarithmic trend along ideas advanced by Deshpande et al. (2021).",

GPUs significantly underperform during token generation due to\nsynchronization overheads at kernel boundaries, utilizing only 21% of their\npeak memory bandwidth. While recent dataflow architectures mitigate these\noverheads by enabling aggressive fusion of decoder layers into a single kernel,\nthey too leave performance on the table due to synchronization penalties at\nlayer boundaries.\n  This paper presents kernel looping, a specialized global optimization\ntechnique which exploits an optimization opportunity brought by combining the\nunique layer-level fusion possible in modern dataflow architectures with the\nrepeated layer structure found in language models. Kernel looping eliminates\nsynchronization costs between consecutive calls to the same kernel by\ntransforming these calls into a single call to a modified kernel containing a\npipelined outer loop. We evaluate kernel looping on the SambaNova SN40L\nReconfigurable Dataflow Unit (RDU), a commercial dataflow accelerator for AI.\nExperiments demonstrate that kernel looping speeds up the decode phase of a\nwide array of powerful open-source models by up to 2.2$\\times$ on SN40L. Kernel\nlooping allows scaling of decode performance over multiple SN40L sockets,\nachieving speedups of up to 2.5$\\times$. Finally, kernel looping enables SN40L\nto achieve over 90% of peak performance on 8 and 16 sockets and achieve a\nspeedup of up to 3.7$\\times$ over DGX H100.

Recently, temporal inconsistency clues have been explored\nto improve the generalizability of deepfake video detection. According to our\nobservation, the temporal artifacts of forged videos in terms of motion\ninformation usually exhibits quite distinct inconsistency patterns along\nhorizontal and vertical directions, which could be leveraged to improve the\ngeneralizability of detectors. In this paper, a transformer-based framework for\nDiffusion Learning of Inconsistency Pattern (DIP) is proposed, which exploits\ndirectional inconsistencies for deepfake video detection. Specifically, DIP\nbegins with a spatiotemporal encoder to represent spatiotemporal information. A\ndirectional inconsistency decoder is adopted accordingly, where direction-aware\nattention and inconsistency diffusion are incorporated to explore potential\ninconsistency patterns and jointly learn the inherent relationships. In\naddition, the SpatioTemporal Invariant Loss (STI Loss) is introduced to\ncontrast spatiotemporally augmented sample pairs and prevent the model from\noverfitting nonessential forgery artifacts.

By employing relevant pre-processing techniques and\nleveraging the capabilities of advanced language models, we aim to mitigate\npotential breaches effectively. Drawing insights from existing research on\nsecret detection tools and methodologies, we propose an approach combining the\nstrengths of state-of-the-art regexes with the contextual understanding of\nlanguage models. Our method aims to reduce false positives and improve the\naccuracy of secret breach detection in software issue reports. We have curated\na benchmark dataset of 25000 instances with only 437 true positives. Although\nthe data is highly skewed, our model performs well with a 0.6347 F1-score,\nwhereas state-of-the-art regular expression hardly manages to get a 0.0341\nF1-Score with a poor precision score. We have also developed a secret breach\nmitigator tool for GitHub, which will warn the user if there is any secret in\nthe posted issue report. By addressing this critical gap in contemporary\nresearch, our work aims at enhancing the overall security posture of software\ndevelopment practices.",

    "abstract": "In this work, the spatiotemporal pressure field of MHz-focused ultrasound is\nmeasured using a background-oriented schlieren technique combined with fast\ncheckerboard demodulation and vector tomography (VT-BOS). Hydrophones have been\ncommonly employed to directly measure the local pressure in underwater\nultrasound. However, their limitations include that they disturb the acoustic\nfield and affect the measured pressure through the spatial averaging effect. To\novercome such limitations, we propose VT-BOS as a non-contact technique for\nacoustic field measurements using only a background image and a camera. In our\nexperiments, VT-BOS measures focused acoustic fields with a focal width of 1.0\nmm and a frequency of 4.55 MHz, capturing traveling, reflected, and standing\nwaves. We discuss three key features of this approach:(1) the temporal\nevolution of pressure measured by VT-BOS and hydrophones, (2) the differences\nin computational cost and spatial resolution between VT-BOS and other\ntechniques, and (3) the measurement range of VT-BOS. The results demonstrate\nthat VT-BOS successfully quantifies spatiotemporal acoustic fields and can\nestimate the hydrophones' spatial averaging effect over a finite area. VT-BOS\nmeasures pressure fields of several MPa with high spatiotemporal resolution,\nrequiring less computational and measurement time. It is used to measure\npressure amplitudes from 0.4 to 6.4 MPa, with the potential to extend the range\nto 0.3 ~ 201.6 MPa by adjusting the background-to-target distance. VT-BOS is a\npromising tool for measuring acoustic pressure in the MHz and MPa ranges,\ncritical for applications such as vessel flow measurement and hydrophone\ncalibration.",

To address this, we propose an SOC estimation\nmethod that accounts for error in OSC. First, we establish battery equivalent\ncircuit model (ECM) and introduce a parameters identification algorithm based\non adaptive recursive least squares. Next, we derive the relationship between\nthe innovation's cross-correlation matrix (CCM)/ auto-correlation matrix (ACM)\nof the Kalman filter and the OSC error. We then develop an adaptive multi-model\nKalman filter (AMMKF), which dynamically adjusts the measurement model\nparameters of each filter based on the sign of the OSC error. By assigning a\nprobability to each filter according to its predicted voltage distribution\nfunction, the optimal filter is selected. The proposed method is tested under\nvarious OSC error types and operating conditions.

We found high\nconcordance with pathologist ground-truth in detection (area under curve 98.5%,\nsensitivity 95.0%, and specificity 97.8%), ISUP grading (Cohen's kappa 0.869),\ngrade group 3 or higher classification (area under curve 97.5%, sensitivity\n94.9%, specificity 96.6%). Screening models could correctly classify 55% of\nbiopsy blocks where immunohistochemistry was ordered with a 1.4% error rate. No\nstatistically significant differences were observed between task-specific and\nfoundation models in cancer detection, although the task-specific model is\nsignificantly smaller and faster. Institutions like academic medical centers\nthat have high scanning volumes and report abstraction capabilities can develop\nhighly accurate computational pathology models for internal use.

    "abstract": "Despite huge progress in skeleton-based action recognition, its\ngeneralizability to different domains remains a challenging issue. In this\npaper, to solve the skeleton action generalization problem, we present a\nrecover-and-resample augmentation framework based on a novel complete action\nprior. We observe that human daily actions are confronted with temporal\nmismatch across different datasets, as they are usually partial observations of\ntheir complete action sequences. By recovering complete actions and resampling\nfrom these full sequences, we can generate strong augmentations for unseen\ndomains. At the same time, we discover the nature of general action\ncompleteness within large datasets, indicated by the per-frame diversity over\ntime. This allows us to exploit two assets of transferable knowledge that can\nbe shared across action samples and be helpful for action completion: boundary\nposes for determining the action start, and linear temporal transforms for\ncapturing global action patterns. Therefore, we formulate the recovering stage\nas a two-step stochastic action completion with boundary pose-conditioned\nextrapolation followed by smooth linear transforms. Both the boundary poses and\nlinear transforms can be efficiently learned from the whole dataset via\nclustering. We validate our approach on a cross-dataset setting with three\nskeleton action datasets, outperforming other domain generalization approaches\nby a considerable margin.",

To bridge\nthis gap, we investigate various PEFT methods under noisy labels.\nInterestingly, our findings reveal that PEFT has difficulty in memorizing noisy\nlabels due to its inherently limited capacity, resulting in robustness.\nHowever, we also find that such limited capacity simultaneously makes PEFT more\nvulnerable to interference of noisy labels, impeding the learning of clean\nsamples.

This model integrates a noise\npredictor, two discriminators, and a consistency network, and is optimized\nusing a combination of supervised loss, adversarial loss, cycle consistency\nloss, identity loss, and neighboring Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) loss.\nExperiments were conducted on a large dataset consisting of raw PET brain data\nfrom 1,224 patients, acquired using a Siemens Biograph Vision PET/CT scanner.\nEach patient underwent a 120-seconds brain scan. To simulate low-dose PET\nconditions, images were reconstructed from shortened scan durations of 30, 12,\nand 5 seconds, corresponding to 1/4, 1/10, and 1/24 of the full-dose\nacquisition, respectively, using a custom-developed GPU-based image\nreconstruction software.

This work\ninvestigates the quantum entanglement and criticality of the ground-state\nwave-functions of infinitely-many coupled quantum oscillators (iCQOs). The\nessential task involves solving a set of partial differential equations\n(Schr\\\"odinger equations in the canonical quantization picture) with\ninfinitely-many variables, which currently lacks valid methods. By extending\nthe imaginary-time evolution algorithm with translationally-invariant\nfunctional tensor network, we simulate the ground state of iCQOs with the\npresence of two- and three-body couplings. We determine the range of coupling\nstrengths where there exists a real ground-state energy (dubbed as physical\nregion). With two-body couplings, we reveal the logarithmic scaling law of\nentanglement entropy (EE) and the polynomial scaling law of correlation length\nagainst the virtual bond dimension $\\chi$ at the dividing point of physical and\nnon-physical regions. These two scaling behaviors are signatures of\ncriticality, according to the previous results in quantum lattice models, but\nwere not reported in continuous-space quantum systems. The scaling coefficients\nresult in a central charge $c=1$, indicating the presence of free boson\nconformal field theory (CFT). We further show that the presence of three-body\ncouplings, for which there are no analytical or numerical results, breaks down\nthe CFT description at the dividing point. Our work reveals the scaling\nbehaviors of EE in continuous-space quantum many-body systems.

Specifically, we investigate the CZ gates based\non magnetic dipolar interactions between Yb ions, photon scattering off a\ncavity, and a photon interference-based protocol, with and without an optical\ncavity. We introduce a theoretical framework for precise computations of state\nand gate infidelities, accounting for noise effects. We then compute the state\nfidelity for each scheme to evaluate the feasibility of their experimental\nimplementation. Based on these results, we compare the performance of the\ntwo-qubit gate schemes and discuss their respective advantages and\ndisadvantages. We conclude that the probabilistic photon interference-based\nscheme offers the best fidelity scaling with cooperativity and is superior with\nthe current technology of Yb values, while photon scattering is nearly\ndeterministic but slower with less favourable fidelity scaling as a function of\ncooperativity. The cavityless magnetic dipolar scheme provides a fast,\ndeterministic gate with decent fidelities if close ion localization can be\nrealized.

The timing behavior of pulsars can be influenced\nby the dipole field evolution, which instead of decaying, may increase with\ntime. An increase in the dipole field may result from the re-emergence of the\ninitial dipole field $B_{\\rm d,i}$ that was buried into the NS interior shortly\nafter the birth of the NS. In this work, the field re-emergence scenario $\\xi$\nand the internal field configuration of several young pulsars, as well as their\n$B_{\\rm d, i}$ are investigated by assuming typical accreted masses $\\Delta M$.\nMoreover, since the Crab pulsar has an exactly known age and its tilt angle\nchange rate can be inferred from observations, we can set stringent constraints\non its $\\xi$, $B_{\\rm d,i}$, and $\\Delta M$.

We\ninvestigate the presence of this bias in long-form summarization, its impact on\nfaithfulness, and various techniques to mitigate this bias. To consistently\nevaluate faithfulness, we first compile a benchmark of eight human-annotated\nlong-form summarization datasets and perform a meta-evaluation of faithfulness\nmetrics. We show that LLM-based faithfulness metrics, though effective with\nfull-context inputs, remain sensitive to document order, indicating positional\nbias. Analyzing LLM-generated summaries across six datasets, we find a\n\"U-shaped\" trend in faithfulness, where LLMs faithfully summarize the beginning\nand end of documents but neglect middle content. Perturbing document order\nsimilarly reveals models are less faithful when important documents are placed\nin the middle of the input. We find that this behavior is partly due to\nshifting focus with context length: as context increases, summaries become less\nfaithful, but beyond a certain length, faithfulness improves as the model\nfocuses on the end. Finally, we experiment with different generation techniques\nto reduce positional bias and find that prompting techniques effectively direct\nmodel attention to specific positions, whereas more sophisticated approaches\noffer limited improvements.

Despite these advances, we observe\nthat LLM predictions for long-tail questions remain uncertain to variations in\nretrieved samples. To take advantage of the uncertainty in ICL for guiding LLM\npredictions toward correct answers on long-tail samples, we propose a\nreinforcement learning-based dynamic uncertainty ranking method for ICL that\naccounts for the varying impact of each retrieved sample on LLM predictions.\nOur approach prioritizes more informative and stable samples while demoting\nmisleading ones, updating rankings based on the feedback from the LLM w.r.t.\neach retrieved sample. To enhance training efficiency and reduce query costs,\nwe introduce a learnable dynamic ranking threshold, adjusted when the model\nencounters negative prediction shifts.

Here, we circumnavigate this challenge by using linear\ndecoding over the learned representations of unimodal vision, unimodal\nlanguage, and multimodal (language-aligned) deep neural network (DNN) models to\npredict human beauty ratings of naturalistic images. We show that unimodal\nvision models (e.g. SimCLR) account for the vast majority of explainable\nvariance in these ratings. Language-aligned vision models (e.g. SLIP) yield\nsmall gains relative to unimodal vision. Unimodal language models (e.g. GPT2)\nconditioned on visual embeddings to generate captions (via CLIPCap) yield no\nfurther gains. Caption embeddings alone yield less accurate predictions than\nimage and caption embeddings combined (concatenated). Taken together, these\nresults suggest that whatever words we may eventually find to describe our\nexperience of beauty, the ineffable computations of feedforward perception may\nprovide sufficient foundation for that experience.",

When such outliers occur at the end of the data stream, this can\ncause the final solution to have unexpectedly low accuracy. We design a\nweighted reservoir sampling (WRS) approach to obtain a stable ensemble model\nfrom the sequence of solutions without requiring additional passes over the\ndata, hold-out sets, or a growing amount of memory. Our key insight is that\ngood solutions tend to be error-free for more iterations than bad solutions,\nand thus, the number of passive rounds provides an estimate of a solution's\nrelative quality. Our reservoir thus contains $K$ previous intermediate weight\nvectors with high survival times. We demonstrate our WRS approach on the\nPassive-Aggressive Classifier (PAC) and First-Order Sparse Online Learning\n(FSOL), where our method consistently and significantly outperforms the\nunmodified approach.

Such operation for defending robots is challenging due to the\nunknown avoidance strategy and higher speed of the attacker, coupled with the\nlimited communication capabilities of defenders. To solve this problem, we\npropose a parameterized formation controller that allows defending robots to\nadapt their formation shape using five adjustable parameters.

In this work, a power-law form is\nadopted to describe the decay of $B_{\\rm d}$. In such a scenario, the IMFC and\n$\\xi$ of young pulsars with an ordinary $B_{\\rm d}\\sim10^{12}-\\-10^{13}$ G and\na steady braking index $n$ are investigated. Since the tilt angle change rates\n$\\dot{\\chi}$ of pulsars with $n<3$ can be theoretically predicted, a test on\nthe power-law decay model can thus be made by comparing the theoretical values\nto that obtained from observations. However, such a comparison can only be made\non the Crab pulsar currently, and the results show that the power-law decay\nmodel is inconsistent with the Crab's observations. We suggest that rather than\ndecay, the Crab's $B_{\\rm d}$ should increase with time at a rate $\\sim12-14$\nG/s.

To automate part of this process, large language\nmodels (LLMs) have been applied to solve various subtasks of ontology learning.\nHowever, this partial ontology learning does not capture the interactions\nbetween subtasks. We address this gap by introducing OLLM, a general and\nscalable method for building the taxonomic backbone of an ontology from\nscratch. Rather than focusing on subtasks, like individual relations between\nentities, we model entire subcomponents of the target ontology by finetuning an\nLLM with a custom regulariser that reduces overfitting on high-frequency\nconcepts. We introduce a novel suite of metrics for evaluating the quality of\nthe generated ontology by measuring its semantic and structural similarity to\nthe ground truth. In contrast to standard metrics, our metrics use deep\nlearning techniques to define more robust distance measures between graphs.\nBoth our quantitative and qualitative results on Wikipedia show that OLLM\noutperforms subtask composition methods, producing more semantically accurate\nontologies while maintaining structural integrity.

This study proposes an\nAdvanced Surface Imaging (A-SI) framework to address this issue. In the\nproposed A-SI framework, a high-speed surface imaging camera consistently\ncaptures surface images during radiation delivery, and a CBCT imager captures\nsingle-angle X-ray projections at low frequency. The A-SI then utilizes a\ngenerative model to generate real-time volumetric images with full anatomy,\nreferred to as Optical Surface-Derived cone beam computed tomography\n(OSD-CBCT), based on the real-time high-frequent surface images and the\nlow-frequency collected single-angle X-ray projections. The generated OSD-CBCT\ncan provide accurate tumor motion for precise radiation delivery. The A-SI\nframework uses a patient-specific generative model: physics-integrated\nconsistency-refinement denoising diffusion probabilistic model (PC-DDPM). This\nmodel leverages patient-specific anatomical structures and respiratory motion\npatterns derived from four-dimensional CT (4DCT) during treatment planning. It\nthen employs a geometric transformation module (GTM) to extract volumetric\nanatomy information from the single-angle X-ray projection.

However, for\ndiseases like female breast cancer (FBC), reliable prevalence data at specific\ngeographical levels, such as the county-level, are limited because the gold\nstandard data typically come from long-term cancer registries, which do not\nnecessarily collect needed risk factors. In addition, it remains unclear\nwhether fitting each model separately or jointly results in better estimation.\nIn this paper, we identify two data sources to produce reliable county-level\nprevalence estimates in Missouri, USA: the population-based Missouri Cancer\nRegistry (MCR) and the survey-based Missouri County-Level Study (CLS). We\npropose a two-stage Bayesian model to synthesize these sources, accounting for\ntheir differences in the methodological design, case definitions, and collected\ninformation. The first stage involves estimating the county-level FBC\nprevalence using the raking method for CLS data and the counting method for MCR\ndata, calibrating the differences in the methodological design and case\ndefinition. The second stage includes synthesizing two sources with different\nsets of covariates using a Bayesian generalized linear mixed model with\nZeller-Siow prior for the coefficients. Our data analyses demonstrate that\nusing both data sources have better results than at least one data source, and\nincluding a data source membership matters when there exist systematic\ndifferences in these sources.

Our algorithm\ncontains two general subroutines that work for wider classes of problems. The\nfirst subroutine can solve general online convex optimization with memory and\nbandit feedback with $\\sqrt{T}$-dynamic regret with respect to $T$. The second\nsubroutine is a zeroth-order method that can be used to solve general convex\noptimization problems with a linear convergence rate that matches the best\nachievable rate of first-order methods for convex optimization. The key to our\nalgorithm design and analysis is the use of truncated Gaussian smoothing when\nquerying the decision points for obtaining the predictions. We complement our\ntheoretical results using numerical experiments.",

Raman\nspectroscopy revealed the PEDOT materials with significant compression in the\nC{\\alpha}-C{\\alpha} bond and extension in the C{\\alpha}=C\\b{eta} bond exhibit\nSeebeck coefficients two orders of magnitude larger than usual. Furthermore,\nstrain in the C\\b{eta}-C\\b{eta} bond strongly correlated with the Seebeck\ncoefficient that varied in a broad range from -2100 to 3100 {\\mu}V K-1. This\nvariation indicated that the molecular strain formed a sharp peak or valley\naround the Fermi level in the density of state (DOS) function, which gradually\nshifts along with the C\\b{eta}-C\\b{eta} strain.

The suspension balance\nmodel introduces non-Newtonian bulk stress with shear-induced normal stresses,\nthe gradients of which cause particle migration. Both models have appeared in\nthe literature of particle-laden flow with virtually no comparison between the\ntwo models.

    "abstract": "The communications and interrelations between different locations on the\nEarth's surface have far-reaching implications for both social and natural\nsystems. Effective spatial analytics ideally require a spatial representation,\nwhere geographic principles are succinctly expressed within a defined metric\nspace. However, common spatial representations, including map-based or\nnetwork-based approaches, fall short by incompletely or inaccurately defining\nthis metric space. Here we show, by introducing an inverse friction factor that\ncaptures the spatial constraints in spatial networks, that a homogeneous,\nlow-dimensional spatial representation - termed the Geographic Manifold - can\nbe achieved. We illustrate the effectiveness of the Geographic Manifold in two\nclassic scenarios of spatial analytics - location choice and propagation, where\nthe otherwise complicated analyses are reduced to straightforward regular\npartitioning and concentric diffusing, respectively on the manifold with a high\ndegree of accuracy. We further empirically explain and formally prove the\ngeneral existence of the Geographic Manifold, which is grounded in the\nintrinsic Euclidean low-dimensional statistical physics properties of\ngeographic phenomena. This work represents a step towards formalizing Tobler's\nfamous First Law of Geography from a geometric approach, where a regularized\ngeospace thereby yielded is expected to contribute in learning abstract spatial\nstructure representations for understanding and optimization purposes.",

To this end, we present\na hierarchical fine-grained formulation for IFDL representation learning.\nSpecifically, we first represent forgery attributes of a manipulated image with\nmultiple labels at different levels. Then, we perform fine-grained\nclassification at these levels using the hierarchical dependency between them.\nAs a result, the algorithm is encouraged to learn both comprehensive features\nand the inherent hierarchical nature of different forgery attributes. In this\nwork, we propose a Language-guided Hierarchical Fine-grained IFDL, denoted as\nHiFi-Net++. Specifically, HiFi-Net++ contains four components: a multi-branch\nfeature extractor, a language-guided forgery localization enhancer, as well as\nclassification and localization modules. Each branch of the multi-branch\nfeature extractor learns to classify forgery attributes at one level, while\nlocalization and classification modules segment pixel-level forgery regions and\ndetect image-level forgery, respectively. Also, the language-guided forgery\nlocalization enhancer (LFLE), containing image and text encoders learned by\ncontrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP), is used to further enrich the\nIFDL representation. LFLE takes specifically designed texts and the given image\nas multi-modal inputs and then generates the visual embedding and manipulation\nscore maps, which are used to further improve HiFi-Net++ manipulation\nlocalization performance. Lastly, we construct a hierarchical fine-grained\ndataset to facilitate our study.

Zwitterionic polymers, known for\ntheir exceptional antifouling properties, offer a promising solution for\nbiofouling deterrence. Despite the rapid development of zwitterionic polymers\nin recent years, the design rules, especially concerning the choice of cationic\nmoieties to optimize biofouling deterrence, remain elusive. In this study, we\nleveraged a versatile all-dry synthesis scheme to achieve a selection of 9\nzwitterionic polymers, 5 of which are unprecedented for this synthesis\nparadigm, thus systematically unraveling that molecular design rule. Notably,\nwe developed a synthesis strategy to enable nanoscale compositional gradient\nalong the coating cross-section, which ensures the robustness of the\nzwitterionic polymer coatings irrespective of the choice of cation-anion\ncombinations. That robustness is enabled by an organosilicon-based layer at the\ncoating-substrate interface, which simultaneously enhances coating adhesion and\nchemical stability while ensuring high concentration of zwitterionic moieties\nat the polymer-liquid interface to maximize biofouling deterrence. The\nantifouling efficacy was assessed using biofilms of Pseudomonas aeruginosa or\nBacillus subtilis. All coatings demonstrated antifouling efficacy, with a novel\nzwitterionic polymer comprising a combination of imidazolium and carboxyl\ngroups achieving the greatest antibiofilm effects, which we attributed to the\nstrong hydration. This study highlights the coating architecture, i.e., one\nwith nanoscale gradient and varying crosslinking densities, as a valid strategy\nto render zwitterionic polymers robust coatings and the imidazolium-based\ncarboxybetaine as a promising next-generation antibiofouling chemistry.",

In our approach, we free the\nfull nodes from the task of ADS maintenance by delegating it to a limited\nnumber of nodes, and full nodes verify the correctness of ADS by using\nchallenge-based authentication scheme instead of reconstructing them, which\nprevents the service providers from maintaining incorrect ADS with overwhelming\nprobability. By carefully designing the ADS verification scheme, EVeCA achieves\nhigher efficiency while remaining resilient against adaptive attacks. Our\nframework effectively eliminates the need for on-chain ADS maintenance, and\nallows full nodes to participate in ADS maintenance in a cost-effective way. We\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme through security analysis\nand experimental evaluation. Compared to existing schemes, our approach\nimproves ADS maintenance efficiency by about 20*.",

We fill the gap in the literature by performing the computation\nof tidal Love numbers for the four-dimensional Schwarzschild solution in global\nanti-de Sitter, which is dual to a conformal plasma on $S^2$. We conclude about\nthe effect of the bulk gravitational perturbations on the boundary metric and\nstress tensor, responsible for the geometric polarization. The computation of\nthe tidal Love numbers is performed in both Regge-Wheeler gauge and the\nKodama-Ishibashi gauge-invariant approach. We spell out how to convert the\ntidal Love numbers determined in these two formalisms and find perfect\nagreement. We also relate the Kodama- Ishibashi formalism with the\nKovtun-Starinets approach, which is particularly well suited for the\nholographic analysis of black branes.

    "abstract": "Passenger transportation is a core aspect of a railway company's business,\nwith ticket sales playing a central role in generating revenue. Profitable\noperations in this context rely heavily on the effectiveness of\nreject-or-assign policies for coach reservations. As in traditional revenue\nmanagement, uncertainty in demand presents a significant challenge,\nparticularly when seat availability is limited and passengers have varying\nitineraries. We extend traditional models from the literature by addressing\nboth offline and online versions of the coach reservation problem for group\nrequests, where two or more passengers must be seated in the same coach. For\nthe offline case, in which all requests are known in advance, we propose an\nexact mathematical programming formulation that incorporates a first-come,\nfirst-served fairness condition, ensuring compliance with transportation\nregulations. We also propose algorithms for online models of the problem, in\nwhich requests are only revealed upon arrival, and the reject-or-assign\ndecisions must be made in real-time. Our analysis for one of these models\novercomes known barriers in the packing literature, yielding strong competitive\nratio guarantees when group sizes are relatively small compared to coach\ncapacity - a common scenario in practice. Using data from Shinkansen\nTokyo-Shin-Osaka line, our numerical experiments demonstrate the practical\neffectiveness of the proposed policies. Our work provides compelling evidence\nsupporting the adoption of fairness constraints, as revenue losses are minimal,\nand simple algorithms are sufficient for real-time decision-making. Moreover,\nour findings provide a strong support for the adoption of fairness in the\nrailway industry and highlight the financial viability of a regulatory\nframework that allows railway companies to delay coach assignments if they\nadhere to stricter rules regarding request rejections.",

The droplet pinching is induced by a local variation\nof the channel topography and can lead to its break-up. The modification of the\nchannel topography is either induced by a reversible local dilation of the\nchannel bottom wall or by a confinement gradient that is irreversibly modelled\nin the channel. Interestingly, in both cases, a few micrometres contraction of\nthe channel height leads to the pinching of the droplet in the direction of the\nchannel width. If this pinching is such that the droplet is no longer confined\nat the level of its deformation, {\\it i.e.} the liquid thread becomes 3D, the\ndroplet splits in two. By minimizing the surface energy of the droplet under\nthe channel confinement gradient, we are able to predict its pinching or its\nbreak-up, if any. The dynamic of the droplet deformation is then captured by a\nsemi-analytical model, assuming that most of the viscous dissipation is located\nin the gutters at the four corners of the channel. Conversely, we show that\nthis kinetic model can be used to extract the average topographic variation of\nthe channel, down to few micrometers, by measuring the droplet pinching\ndynamics under a classical optical microscope.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the intricate cellular environment within biological tissues is\ncrucial for uncovering insights into complex biological functions. While\nsingle-cell RNA sequencing has significantly enhanced our understanding of\ncellular states, it lacks the spatial context necessary to fully comprehend the\ncellular environment. Spatial transcriptomics (ST) addresses this limitation by\nenabling transcriptome-wide gene expression profiling while preserving spatial\ncontext. One of the principal challenges in ST data analysis is spatial\nclustering, which reveals spatial domains based on the spots within a tissue.\nModern ST sequencing procedures typically include a high-resolution histology\nimage, which has been shown in previous studies to be closely connected to gene\nexpression profiles. However, current spatial clustering methods often fail to\nfully integrate high-resolution histology image features with gene expression\ndata, limiting their ability to capture critical spatial and cellular\ninteractions.\n  In this study, we propose the spatial transcriptomics multi-modal clustering\n(stMMC) model, a novel contrastive learning-based deep learning approach that\nintegrates gene expression data with histology image features through a\nmulti-modal parallel graph autoencoder. We tested stMMC against four\nstate-of-the-art baseline models: Leiden, GraphST, SpaGCN, and stLearn on two\npublic ST datasets with 13 sample slices in total. The experiments demonstrated\nthat stMMC outperforms all the baseline models in terms of ARI and NMI.

Inversion-based methods address this by reversing the\ndenoising trajectory, mapping each image back to its approximated starting\nnoise. In this work, we thoroughly analyze this procedure and focus on the\nrelation between the initial Gaussian noise, the generated samples, and their\ncorresponding latent encodings obtained through the DDIM inversion. First, we\nshow that latents exhibit structural patterns in the form of less diverse noise\npredicted for smooth image regions.

Next, we explain the origin of the phenomenon,\ndemonstrating that, during the first inversion steps, the noise prediction\nerror is much more significant for the plain areas than for the rest of the\nimage. As a surprisingly simple solution, we propose to replace the first DDIM\nInversion steps with a forward diffusion process, which successfully\ndecorrelates latent encodings, leading to higher quality editions and\ninterpolations.

This approach, denoted by\nCPD-SVR, is able to directly construct the PES in CPD with a more compressed\nform than previously developed Gaussian process regression (GPR) for CPD,\ndenoted by CPD-GRP ({\\it J. Phys. Chem. Lett.} {\\bf 13} (2022), 11128). Similar\nto CPD-GPR, the present CPD-SVR method requires the multi-dimension kernel\nfunction in a product of a series of one-dimensional functions. We shall show\nthat, only a small set of support vectors play a role in SVR prediction making\nCPD-SVR predict lower-rank CPD than CPD-GPR. To save computational cost in\ndetermining support vectors, we propose a warm-started (ws) algorithm where a\npre-existed crude PES is employed to classify the training data. With the\nwarm-started algorithm, the present CPD-SVR approach is extended to the\nCPD-ws-SVR approach. Then, we test CPD-ws-SVR and compare it with CPD-GPR\nthrough constructions and applications of the PESs of H + H$_2$, H$_2$ + H$_2$,\nand H$_2$/Cu(111).

For each cluster,\nthe single stars' main sequence was fitted with a moving straight line weighted\nfit to the Color-Magnitude Diagram, stars brighter than the residuals\ndispersion were taken as binaries. Single stars masses were obtained from a\ncubic spline fit to the mass_flame vs. G magnitude data. For binary stars, the\nindividual masses of each component were estimated using simulated-based\ninference. We used the minimum spanning tree concept to measure the mass\nsegregation of each cluster. From the stellar mass distribution, an estimate of\nthe power-law coefficient that best describes it was used to characterize the\nIMF. Results. Mass segregation is visible in all the clusters, the older ones\nhave about 50% of their most massive stars segregated, while younger ones\nextend from about 30% to 55%. The IMF of the studied clusters is well described\nby a power-law of index 2.09. Conclusions. Significant mass segregation, from\none-third to one-half of its most massive population is present in open\nclusters as young as > 10 Myr. Mass segregation may be strong for only a few of\nthe most massive stars or less intense but extended to a larger fraction of\nthose, it may start as early as 0.20 of the relaxation time of the cluster and\nprogress over time by increasing both the number of the most massive stars\naffected and their amount of segregation.

However, many of these efforts\nsuffer from similar limitations: they infer RIRs in the time domain, which\nprove challenging to optimize; they focus on scenes with simple, single-room\ngeometries; they infer only single-channel, directionally-independent acoustic\ncharacteristics; and they require inputs, such as 3D geometry meshes with\nmaterial properties, that may be impractical to obtain for on-device\napplications. On the other hand, research suggests that sample-wise accuracy of\nRIRs is not required for perceptual plausibility in AR and VR. Standard\nacoustic parameters like Clarity Index (C50) or Reverberation Time (T60) have\nbeen shown to capably describe pertinent characteristics of the RIRs,\nespecially late reverberation. To address these gaps, this paper introduces a\nnew task centered on estimating spatially distributed acoustic parameters that\ncan be then used to condition a simple reverberator for arbitrary source and\nreceiver positions. The approach is modelled as an image-to-image translation\ntask, which translates 2D floormaps of a scene into 2D heatmaps of acoustic\nparameters. We introduce a new, large-scale dataset of 1000 scenes consisting\nof complex, multi-room apartment conditions, and show that our method\noutperforms statistical baselines significantly. Moreover, we show that the\nmethod also works for directionally-dependent (i.e. beamformed) parameter\nprediction.

Recent work has shown that unifying K-means clustering\nand imputation into one single objective function and solving the resultant\noptimization yield superior results compared to handling imputation and\nclustering separately.\n  In this work, we extend this approach by developing a unified K-means\nalgorithm that incorporates Mahalanobis distances, instead of the traditional\nEuclidean distances, which previous research has shown to perform better for\nclusters with elliptical shapes.\n  We conducted extensive experiments on synthetic datasets containing up to ten\nelliptical clusters, as well as the IRIS dataset. Using the Adjusted Rand Index\n(ARI) and Normalized Mutual Information (NMI), we demonstrate that our\nalgorithm consistently outperforms both standalone imputation followed by\nK-means (using either Mahalanobis or Euclidean distance) and K-Means with\nIncomplete Data, the recent K-means algorithms that integrate imputation and\nclustering for handling incomplete data. These results hold across both the\nIRIS dataset and randomly generated data with elliptical clusters.",

    "abstract": "We have studied theoretically the specific heat of a large number of\nnon-frustrated magnetic structures described by the Heisenberg model for\nsystems with total angular momentum $J=7/2$, corresponding to the 4f$^7$\nconfiguration of Gd$^{+3}$ and Eu$^{+2}$. For a given critical temperature\n(determined by the magnitude of the exchange interactions), we find that, to a\nhigh degree of accuracy, the specific heat is governed by two primary\nparameters: the effective number of neighbors, which dictates the extent of\nquantum fluctuations, and the axial anisotropy. Using these two parameters we\nfit the specific heat of four Gd compounds and two Eu compounds, achieving a\nremarkable agreement. Our work opens the possibility of describing the specific\nheat of 4f$^7$ systems within a general framework.",
