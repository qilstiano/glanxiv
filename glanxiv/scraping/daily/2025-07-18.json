    "abstract": "We present VizGenie, a self-improving, agentic framework that advances\nscientific visualization through large language model (LLM) by orchestrating of\na collection of domain-specific and dynamically generated modules. Users\ninitially access core functionalities--such as threshold-based filtering, slice\nextraction, and statistical analysis--through pre-existing tools. For tasks\nbeyond this baseline, VizGenie autonomously employs LLMs to generate new\nvisualization scripts (e.g., VTK Python code), expanding its capabilities\non-demand. Each generated script undergoes automated backend validation and is\nseamlessly integrated upon successful testing, continuously enhancing the\nsystem's adaptability and robustness. A distinctive feature of VizGenie is its\nintuitive natural language interface, allowing users to issue high-level\nfeature-based queries (e.g., ``visualize the skull\"). The system leverages\nimage-based analysis and visual question answering (VQA) via fine-tuned vision\nmodels to interpret these queries precisely, bridging domain expertise and\ntechnical implementation. Additionally, users can interactively query generated\nvisualizations through VQA, facilitating deeper exploration. Reliability and\nreproducibility are further strengthened by Retrieval-Augmented Generation\n(RAG), providing context-driven responses while maintaining comprehensive\nprovenance records. Evaluations on complex volumetric datasets demonstrate\nsignificant reductions in cognitive overhead for iterative visualization tasks.\nBy integrating curated domain-specific tools with LLM-driven flexibility,\nVizGenie not only accelerates insight generation but also establishes a\nsustainable, continuously evolving visualization practice. The resulting\nplatform dynamically learns from user interactions, consistently enhancing\nsupport for feature-centric exploration and reproducible research in scientific\nvisualization.",

    "abstract": "Water exhibits rich polymorphism, where more than 20 crystalline phases have\nbeen experimentally reported. Five of them are metastable and form at low\ntemperatures by either heating amorphous ice or degassing clathrate hydrates.\nHowever, such metastable phases rarely crystallise directly from liquid water,\nmaking it challenging to study metastable phase relations at relatively high\ntemperatures. Here, we report that high-pressure metastable phases of ice,\nincluding two unknown phases named ices XXI and XXII, crystallise directly from\nliquid water in a deeply supercooled region around the homogeneous nucleation\ntemperature. The key is to use emulsified water to stabilise supercooled water\nin laboratory timescales. Ices XXI and XXII are obtained by isothermal\ncompression of emulsified water at 295 K and 250 K, respectively. Our powder\nx-ray and neutron diffraction analyses combined with molecular dynamics (MD)\nsimulations revealed the surprisingly complex structures of these new phases\nwith Z = 152 (ice XXI) and 304 (ice XXII). Ice XXI is topologically identical\nto 'ice T2' previously predicted by MD simulations, and our experimental\nstructural model can be used as a benchmark for its structures in simulations,\nwhich depend on the force fields. On cooling, ice XXI transforms into an\norientationally ordered counterpart named ice XXIII. Our results revealed the\n\"hidden\" structural complexity of water underlying the phase diagram, as\nimplied by previous computational works. Further efforts at unveiling such\nmetastable phase relations will bridge the large gaps between computational and\nexperimental phase diagrams of water.",

    "abstract": "Plastics are essential to modern life, yet poor disposal practices contribute\nto low recycling rates and environmental accumulation-biological degradation\nand by-product reuse offer a path to mitigate this global threat. This report\nhighlights key insights, future challenges, and research priorities identified\nduring the CECAM workshop \"Computations Meet Experiments to Advance the\nEnzymatic Depolymerization of Plastics One Atom at a Time\", held in Trieste\nfrom May 6-8, 2025. The workshop brought together an interdisciplinary\ncommunity of scientists focused on advancing the sustainable use of plastics\nthrough enzyme-based degradation. A key point from the discussions is that many\nbottlenecks in enzymatic recycling arise not only from process engineering\nchallenges, but also from a limited understanding of the underlying molecular\nmechanisms. We argue that constraints on economic viability and sustainability\n(e.g., harsh solvents, high temperatures, substrate crystallinity,\npretreatments) can-and should-be addressed directly through enzyme design,\nprovided these factors are understood at the molecular level, in synergy with\nprocess optimization. For this, it is essential to rely on the integration of\nexperimental and computational approaches to uncover the molecular and\nmechanistic basis of enzymatic plastic degradation. We highlight how the\nsmall-format structure of the workshop, in line with the usual CECAM format,\nfostered a collaborative, friendly, and relaxed atmosphere.

This work\n1) evaluated the usability of an SLM-enabled SAR dialogue system through a\nsmall user study, and 2) identified remaining limitations through study user\nfeedback to inform future improvements. We conducted a small within-participant\nuser study with university students (N = 11) whose results showed that\nparticipants perceived an SLM-enabled SAR system as capable of providing\nempathetic feedback, natural turn-taking, back-channeling, and adaptive\nresponses. We also found that participants reported the robot's nonverbal\nbehaviors as lacking variability and synchronization with conversation, and the\nSLM's verbal feedback as generic and repetitive. These findings highlighted the\nneed for real-time robot movement synchronized with conversation, improved\nprompting or fine-tuning to generate outputs better aligned with mental health\npractices, and more expressive, adaptive vocal generation.",

But the sequence $\\vartheta_n$, while being\nextremely closely correlated with the primes, (in fact, $\\vartheta_n \\sim\np_n$), is very much better behaved than the primes themselves. Using numerous\nsuitable extensions of various reasonably standard results, I shall demonstrate\nthat the sequence $\\vartheta_n$ satisfies suitably defined\n$\\vartheta$-analogues of the usual Cramer, Andrica, Legendre, Oppermann,\nBrocard, Firoozbakht, Fourges, Nicholson, and Farhadian conjectures. (So these\n$\\vartheta$-analogues are not conjectures, they are instead theorems.) The\ncrucial key to enabling this pleasant behaviour is the regularity (and relative\nsmallness) of the $\\theta$-gaps $\\mathfrak{g}_n = \\vartheta_{n+1}-\\vartheta_n=\n\\ln p_{n+1}$. While superficially these results bear close resemblance to some\nrecently derived results for the averaged primes, $\\bar p_n = {1\\over n}\n\\sum_{i=1}^n p_i$, both the broad outline and the technical details of the\narguments given and proofs presented are quite radically distinct.",

    "abstract": "State-of-the-art reasoning LLMs are powerful problem solvers, but they still\noccasionally make mistakes. However, adopting AI models in risk-sensitive\ndomains often requires error rates near 0%. To address this gap, we propose\ncollaboration between a reasoning model and a human expert who resolves queries\nthe model cannot confidently answer. We find that quantifying the uncertainty\nof a reasoning model through the length of its reasoning trace yields an\neffective basis for deferral to a human, e.g., cutting the error rate of Qwen3\n235B-A22B on difficult MATH problems from 3% to less than 1% when deferring\n7.5% of queries. However, the high latency of reasoning models still makes them\nchallenging to deploy on use cases with high query volume. To address this\nchallenge, we explore fronting a reasoning model with a large non-reasoning\nmodel. We call this modified human-in-the-loop system \"Fail Fast, or Ask\",\nsince the non-reasoning model may defer difficult queries to the human expert\ndirectly (\"failing fast\"), without incurring the reasoning model's higher\nlatency. We show that this approach yields around 40% latency reduction and\nabout 50% cost savings for DeepSeek R1 while maintaining 90+% area under the\naccuracy-rejection curve. However, we observe that latency savings are lower\nthan expected because of \"latency drag\", the phenomenon that processing easier\nqueries with a non-reasoning model pushes the reasoning model's latency\ndistribution towards longer latencies. Broadly, our results suggest that the\ndeficiencies of state-of-the-art reasoning models -- nontrivial error rates and\nhigh latency -- can be substantially mitigated through black-box systems\nengineering, without requiring access to LLM internals.",

Latest reasoning models like DeepSeek\nR1, show promising results achieving out-of-the-box 50%+ vectorization on\nselect kernels. However, the average score across the entire dataset remains\nroughly 10% even with compiler feedback and vectorized kernel examples --\nshowing that this is a challenging dataset even for frontier models. The\ndataset and evaluation code will be released with a permissive open source\nlicense, providing an essential benchmark for advancing research in code\ngeneration and NPU kernel optimization.",

    "abstract": "Background: Proton elastic scattering at intermediate energy is widely\nemployed as a tool for determining the matter radius of atomic nuclei. The\nsensitivity of the approach relies on high-resolution measurements at small\nscattering angles and low-momentum transfer. Under these conditions, the\nGlauber multiple scattering theory accurately describes the proton-nucleus\nelastic cross section.\n  Purpose: Investigate the sensitivity of the Glauber multiple scattering\ntheory to uncertainties associated with input parameters such as the\nnuclear-matter density distribution and nucleon-nucleon data.\n  Method: A joint Bayesian inference was performed using 12 angular\ndistributions of elastic scattering at different energies on ${}^{58}$Ni,\n${}^{90}$Zr, and ${}^{208}$Pb targets. A Metropolis-Hastings algorithm was\nimplemented to make an uncertainty quantification analysis for the input\nparameters used in the Glauber multiple scattering theory.\n  Results: The experimental cross sections were fitted simultaneously using a\njoint Bayesian inference approach. Posterior probability density distributions\nof 42 input parameters were obtained from the analysis. A moderate correlation\nbetween the nuclear density parameters and the nucleon-nucleon cross sections\nwas found. This correlation impacts the extraction of the nuclear-matter\nradius.\n  Conclusions: The present analysis provided a consistent method for extracting\nthe nuclear-matter density distribution of ${}^{58}$Ni, ${}^{90}$Zr, and\n${}^{208}$Pb from data across different incident energies. Due to the\ncorrelation of the nucleon-nucleon cross sections with the other input\nparameters, a constrained Bayesian inference using free nucleon-nucleon cross\nsection data was performed. The nuclear-matter radii obtained from the analysis\nare in good agreement with multiple results reported in the literature",

    "abstract": "The transverse momentum ($p_{\\mathrm{T}}$) differential radial flow\nfluctuation, $v_0(p_{\\mathrm{T}})$, has emerged as a new probe of the\nquark-gluon plasma in heavy-ion collisions. I present a framework that recasts\n$v_0(p_{\\mathrm{T}})$ as a $p_{\\mathrm{T}}$-dependent momentum rescaling\nfunction $g(p_{\\mathrm{T}})$. This transformation reveals that constant\nrescaling ($g(p_{\\mathrm{T}})=1$) alone captures the main features of\n$v_0(p_{\\mathrm{T}})$, including its characteristic rise-and-fall pattern that\nemerges naturally from the particle spectral shape. Analysis of ATLAS data at\n$\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=5.02$ TeV reveals small but significant deviations of\n$g(p_{\\mathrm{T}})$ from unity with clear centrality dependence. This\ntransformation converts $v_0(p_{\\mathrm{T}})$ into a transparent probe of\n$p_{\\mathrm{T}}$-dependent dynamics: $g(p_{\\mathrm{T}})<1$ signals suppressed\nfluctuations while $g(p_{\\mathrm{T}})>1$ indicates enhanced fluctuations\nrelative to global radial flow. Predictions for lower energies reveal spectral\nshape differences alone could generate substantial variations in\n$v_0(p_{\\mathrm{T}})$.

    "abstract": "Intent-Based Networking (IBN) often leverages the programmability of\nSoftware-Defined Networking (SDN) to simplify network management. However,\nsignificant challenges remain in automating the entire pipeline, from\nuser-specified high-level intents to device-specific low-level configurations.\nExisting solutions often rely on rigid, rule-based translators and fixed APIs,\nlimiting extensibility and adaptability. By contrast, recent advances in large\nlanguage models (LLMs) offer a promising pathway that leverages natural\nlanguage understanding and flexible reasoning. However, it is unclear to what\nextent LLMs can perform IBN tasks. To address this, we introduce IBNBench, a\nfirst-of-its-kind benchmarking suite comprising four novel datasets:\nIntent2Flow-ODL, Intent2Flow-ONOS, FlowConflict-ODL, and FlowConflict-ONOS.\nThese datasets are specifically designed for evaluating LLMs performance in\nintent translation and conflict detection tasks within the industry-grade SDN\ncontrollers ODL and ONOS. Our results provide the first comprehensive\ncomparison of 33 open-source LLMs on IBNBench and related datasets, revealing a\nwide range of performance outcomes. However, while these results demonstrate\nthe potential of LLMs for isolated IBN tasks, integrating LLMs into a fully\nautonomous IBN pipeline remains unexplored. Thus, our second contribution is\nNetIntent, a unified and adaptable framework that leverages LLMs to automate\nthe full IBN lifecycle, including translation, activation, and assurance within\nSDN systems. NetIntent orchestrates both LLM and non-LLM agents, supporting\ndynamic re-prompting and contextual feedback to robustly execute user-defined\nintents with minimal human intervention. Our implementation of NetIntent across\nboth ODL and ONOS SDN controllers achieves a consistent and adaptive end-to-end\nIBN realization.",

While their individual dynamics have been\nwidely studied, their coupled interactions, particularly in the context of ENSO\ncomplexity, including spatial diversity (Central Pacific vs. Eastern Pacific\nevents), temporal evolution (single-year and multi-year events), and intensity\nvariations (moderate to extreme events), have received limited attention in\nmodeling studies. In this paper, a simple intermediate coupled MJO-ENSO model\nis developed to address critical gaps in understanding their bidirectional\nfeedback and its role in modulating ENSO complexity. The model integrates\nmultiscale processes, bridging intraseasonal (MJO), interannual (ENSO), and\ndecadal (Walker circulation) variability. Key mechanisms include: (1)\ninterannual SST modulating MJO through latent heat and background states, (2)\nMJO-induced wind forcing triggering diverse ENSO events, and (3) decadal\nvariability modulating the strength and occurrence frequency of Eastern Pacific\nand Central Pacific events. Effective stochastic parameterizations are\nincorporated to improve the characterization of multiscale MJO-ENSO\ninteractions and the emergence of intermittency and extremes. The model\ncaptures several crucial observed MJO and ENSO features, including non-Gaussian\nstatistics, seasonal cycles, energy spectra, and spatial event patterns. It\nalso reproduces critical MJO-ENSO interactions: warm pool edge extension,\nconvective activity adjustments that modulate SST, and ENSO's dependence on\nMJO-driven easterly and westerly wind anomalies. The model provides a useful\ntool to analyze long-term variations.

Fano asymmetry, characterized by a\nnonzero asymmetry angle $\\phi$ in the diameter correction method (DCM), results\nfrom the coupling schemes used to measure these devices, including the commonly\nused hanger method. $\\phi$ is an additional fitting parameter which contains no\nphysically interesting information and can obscure device parameters of\ninterest. The tee-junction symmetry nominally present in these resonator\ndevices provides an avenue for the elimination of Fano asymmetry using\ncalibrated measurement. We show that the eigenvalue associated with the common\nmode excitation of the resonator is an effective reflection mode (ERM) which\nhas no Fano asymmetry. Our analysis reveals the cause of Fano asymmetry as\ninterference between common and differential modes. Practically, we obtain the\nERM from a linear combination of calibrated reflection and transmission\nmeasurements. We utilize a 3D aluminum cavity to experimentally demonstrate the\nvalidity and flexibility of this model. To extend the usefulness of this\nsymmetry analysis, we apply perturbation theory to recover the ERM in a\nmultiplexed coplanar waveguide resonator device and experimentally demonstrate\nquantitative agreement in the extracted $Q_i^{-1}$ between hanger mode and ERM\nmeasurements. We observe a five-fold reduction in uncertainty from the ERM\ncompared to the standard hanger mode at the lowest measured power, -160 dBm\ndelivered to the device.

    "abstract": "Compositional data, such as regional shares of economic sectors or property\ntransactions, are central to understanding structural change in economic\nsystems across space and time. This paper introduces a spatiotemporal\nmultivariate autoregressive model tailored for panel data with\ncomposition-valued responses at each areal unit and time point. The proposed\nframework enables the joint modelling of temporal dynamics and spatial\ndependence under compositional constraints and is estimated via a quasi maximum\nlikelihood approach. We build on recent theoretical advances to establish\nidentifiability and asymptotic properties of the estimator when both the number\nof regions and time points grow. The utility and flexibility of the model are\ndemonstrated through two applications: analysing property transaction\ncompositions in an intra-city housing market (Berlin), and regional sectoral\ncompositions in Spain's economy. These case studies highlight how the proposed\nframework captures key features of spatiotemporal economic processes that are\noften missed by conventional methods.",

    "abstract": "The quantum mechanical definition of probability, the uncertainty principle\nand Poincare invariance provide strong basic restrictions on the ability to\ndefine spatial densities associated with form factors describing the properties\nof confined systems of relativistically moving constituents. Despite this, many\npapers ignore one or more of these restrictions. Here I show how to obtain\ntime-independent, two-dimensional densities that are consistent with the stated\nrestrictions. This is done using the light-front, infinite momentum frame\nformalism. Two-dimensional density interpretations of the axial-vector form\nfactor and all three gravitational form factors are obtained. Additionally, an\nexpression of a two-dimensional mass density related to the trace of the energy\nmomentum tensor is obtained. I also show that all known methods for finding\nthree-dimensional densities: using the Breit frame, Abel transformations,\nWigner distributions and spherically-symmetric wave packets with vanishing\nspatial extent violate the basic restrictions in different manners.\nFurthermore, the use of the latter leads to densities that vanish almost\neverywhere in space as time increases from an initial value.",

There is no\nconcise, user-facing vocabulary that tells teams what an agent should\nfundamentally be able to do. We introduce ADEPTS, a capability framework\ndefining a set of core user-facing capabilities to provide unified guidance\naround the development of AI agents. ADEPTS is based on six principles for\nhuman-centered agent design, that express the minimal, user-facing capabilities\nan AI agent should demonstrate to be understandable, controllable and\ntrustworthy in everyday use. ADEPTS complements existing frameworks and\ntaxonomies; differently from them, it sits at the interface between technical\nand experience development. By presenting ADEPTS, we aim to condense complex\nAI-UX requirements into a compact framework that is actionable guidance for AI\nresearchers, designers, engineers, and policy reviewers alike. We believe\nADEPTS has the potential of accelerating the improvement of user-relevant agent\ncapabilities, of easing the design of experiences that take advantage of those\ncapabilities, and of providing a shared language to track and discuss progress\naround the development of AI agents.",

    "abstract": "The escalating threat of cyberattacks on real-time critical infrastructures\nposes serious risks to public safety, demanding detection methods that\neffectively capture complex system interdependencies and adapt to evolving\nattack patterns. Traditional real-time anomaly detection techniques often\nsuffer from excessive false positives due to their statistical sensitivity to\nhigh data variance and class imbalance. To address these limitations, recent\nresearch has explored modeling causal relationships among system components.\nHowever, prior work mainly focuses on offline causal graph-based approaches\nthat require static historical data and fail to generalize to real-time\nsettings. These methods are fundamentally constrained by: (1) their inability\nto adapt to dynamic shifts in data distribution without retraining, and (2) the\nrisk of catastrophic forgetting when lacking timely supervision in live\nsystems. To overcome these challenges, we propose INCADET, a novel framework\nfor incremental causal graph learning tailored to real-time cyberattack\ndetection. INCADET dynamically captures evolving system behavior by\nincrementally updating causal graphs across streaming time windows. The\nframework comprises three modules: 1) Early Symptom Detection: Detects\ntransitions in system status using divergence in edge-weight distributions\nacross sequential causal graphs. 2) Incremental Causal Graph Learning:\nLeverages experience replay and edge reinforcement to continually refine causal\nstructures while preserving prior knowledge. 3) Causal Graph Classification:\nEmploys Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) to classify system status using the\nlearned causal graphs. Extensive experiments on real-world critical\ninfrastructure datasets demonstrate that INCADET achieves superior accuracy,\nrobustness, and adaptability compared to both static causal and deep temporal\nbaselines in evolving attack scenarios.",

Using the Comparative Agendas\nProject (CAP) Master Codebook, we classified U.S. Supreme Court case summaries\ninto 21 major policy domains. We tested four intervention methods: zero-shot,\nfew-shot, definition-based, and a novel Step-by-Step Task Decomposition\nstrategy, across repeated samples. Performance was evaluated using standard\nclassification metrics (accuracy, F1-score, Cohen's kappa, Krippendorff's\nalpha), and construct validity was assessed using chi-squared tests and\nCramer's V. Chi-squared and effect size analyses confirmed that intervention\nstrategies significantly influenced classification behavior, with Cramer's V\nvalues ranging from 0.359 to 0.613, indicating moderate to strong shifts in\nclassification patterns. The Step-by-Step Task Decomposition strategy achieved\nthe strongest reliability (accuracy = 0.775, kappa = 0.744, alpha = 0.746),\nachieving thresholds for substantial agreement.

    "abstract": "This study employed hybrid Monte Carlo Molecular Dynamics simulations to\ninvestigate the short-range ordering behavior of Ni-based superalloys doped\nwith boron or carbon. The simulations revealed that both boron and carbon\ndissociated from their host Ti atoms to achieve energetically favored ordering\nwith Cr, Mo, and Nb. Boron clusters formed as B2, surrounded by Mo, Nb, and Cr,\nwhile carbon preferentially clustered with Cr to form a Cr23C6 local motif and\nwith Nb to form Nb2C. Distinct preferences for interstitial sites were\nobserved, with boron favoring tetrahedral sites and carbon occupying octahedral\nsites. In the presence of a vacancy, B2 shifted from the tetrahedral site to\nthe vacancy, where it remained coordinated with Mo, Nb, and Cr. Similarly,\ncarbon utilized vacancies to form Nb2C clusters. Excess energy calculations\nshowed that B and C exhibited strong thermodynamic stability within their\nshort-range ordered configurations. However, under Ti-rich conditions, C was\nmore likely to segregate into TiC, despite preexisting ordering with Cr. This\nshift in stability suggests that increased Ti availability would alter carbide\nformation pathways, drawing C away from Cr-rich networks and promoting the\ndevelopment of TiC. Such redistribution may disrupt the continuity of Cr-based\ncarbide networks, which play a critical role in stabilizing grain boundaries\nand impeding crack propagation. These effects further underscore the impact of\ninterstitial-induced ordering on phase stability and microstructural evolution.\nThis work provides an atomistic perspective on how boron- and carbon-induced\nordering influences microstructure and mechanical properties. These findings\nhighlight the critical role of interstitial-induced short-range ordering and\ndemonstrate that this mechanism can be leveraged as a design principle to\nfine-tune alloy microstructures for specific engineering applications.",

If languages are already\noptimally effective means of organization and communication of thought, why do\nthey change? And if they are driven to become optimally effective in the\nfuture, why do they change so slowly, and why do they diversify, rather than\nconverge towards an optimum? We look here at the hypothesis that disorder,\nrather than efficiency, may play a dominant role. Most traditional approaches\nto study diachronic language dynamics emphasize lexical data, but a crucial\ncontribution to the effectiveness of a thought-coding device is given by its\ncore structure, its syntax. Based on the reduction of syntax to a set of binary\nparameters, we introduce here a model of natural language change in which\ndiachronic dynamics are mediated by disordered interactions between parameters,\neven in the idealized limit of identical external inputs. We show in which\nregion of `phase space' such dynamics show the glassy features that are\nobserved in natural languages. In particular, syntactic vectors remain trapped\nin glassy metastable (tendentially stable) states when the degree of asymmetry\nin the disordered interactions is below a critical value, consistent with\nstudies of spin glasses with asymmetric interactions. We further show that an\nadded Hopfield-type memory term, would indeed, if strong enough, stabilize\nsyntactic configurations even above the critical value, but losing the\nmultiplicity of stable states.

We benchmark APE-OPRO alongside both gradient-free (APE, OPRO) and\ngradient-based (ProTeGi) methods on a dataset of ~2,500 labeled products.\n  Our results highlight key trade-offs: ProTeGi offers the strongest absolute\nperformance at lower API cost but higher computational time as noted\nin~\\cite{protegi}, while APE-OPRO strikes a compelling balance between\nperformance, API efficiency, and scalability. We further conduct ablation\nstudies on depth and breadth hyperparameters, and reveal notable sensitivity to\nlabel formatting, indicating implicit sensitivity in LLM behavior.

We generalize the concept of singularity\nspeckle patterns to arbitrary two dimensional parameter spaces and any complex\nscalar function that describes wave phenomena involving complicated scattering.\nIn scattering systems specifically, we are often concerned with singularities\nassociated with complex zeros of the scattering matrix S. Some examples are\nCoherent Perfect Absorption (CPA), Reflectionless Scattering Modes (RSMs),\nTransmissionless Scattering Modes (TSMs), and S-matrix Exceptional Points\n(EPs).

The heavy tail\nof the distribution provides an estimate for the likelihood of finding a given\nsingularity in a generic scattering system. We use these universal statistical\nresults to determine that homogeneous system loss is the most important\nparameter determining singularity density in a given parameter space. Finally,\nwe discuss events where distinct singularities coincide in parameter space,\nwhich result in higher order singularities that have new applications.

If the distance\nthat separates a pair of emitters meets specific resonance conditions, the\nphoton amplitudes produced from decay may destructively interfere. In an\ninfinite-waveguide setting, this effect gives rise to bound states in the\ncontinuum, where a photon remains confined between the emitters. In the case of\na finite-length waveguide with periodic boundary conditions, there exist two\nsuch relevant distances for a given arrangement of the quantum emitters,\nleading to states in which a photon is confined to either the shorter or the\nlonger path that connects the emitters. If the ratio of the shorter and the\nlonger path is a rational number, these two kinds of resonant eigenstates are\nallowed to co-exist for the same Hamiltonian. In this paper, we investigate the\nexistence of quasi-degenerate resonant doublets of a pair of identical emitters\ncoupled to a linear waveguide mode. The states that form the doublet are\nsearched among the ones in which a single excitation tends to remain bound to\nthe emitters. We investigate the spectrum in a finite range around degeneracy\npoints to check whether the doublet remains well separated from the closest\neigenvalues in the spectrum.

These challenges complicate the task of tracking anatomical landmarks\nover time, which is essential for quantifying tissue dynamics in many clinical\nand research applications. This manuscript introduces DUSTrack (Deep learning\nand optical flow-based toolkit for UltraSound Tracking), a semi-automated\nframework for tracking arbitrary points in B-mode ultrasound videos. We combine\ndeep learning with optical flow to deliver high-quality and robust tracking\nacross diverse anatomical structures and motion patterns. The toolkit includes\na graphical user interface that streamlines the generation of high-quality\ntraining data and supports iterative model refinement. It also implements a\nnovel optical-flow-based filtering technique that reduces high-frequency\nframe-to-frame noise while preserving rapid tissue motion. DUSTrack\ndemonstrates superior accuracy compared to contemporary zero-shot point\ntrackers and performs on par with specialized methods, establishing its\npotential as a general and foundational tool for clinical and biomechanical\nresearch. We demonstrate DUSTrack's versatility through three use cases:\ncardiac wall motion tracking in echocardiograms, muscle deformation analysis\nduring reaching tasks, and fascicle tracking during ankle plantarflexion. As an\nopen-source solution, DUSTrack offers a powerful, flexible framework for point\ntracking to quantify tissue motion from ultrasound videos.

It is assumed silently that agents can freely and costlessly\n``switch\" partners. A matching is called stable if no two unmatched agents\nprefer each other to their matches. Half a century ago, for equinumerous sides,\nKnuth demonstrated existence of preferences for which there are exponentially\nmany stable matchings, and he posed a problem of evaluating an expected number\nof stable matchings when the preferences are uniformly random and independent.\nIt was shown later by Pittel that this expectation is quite moderate,\nasymptotic to $e^{-1}n\\log n$, $n$ being the number of agents on each side. The\nproof used Knuth's integral formula for the expectation based on a classic\ninclusion-exclusion counting. In later papers by Pittel this and other integral\nformulas were obtained by generating preference lists via a pair of random\nmatrices, with independently random, $[0,1]$-uniform entries, rather than from\na progressively problematic counting approach. The novelty of this paper is\nthat we view the matrix entries as a basis for cardinal utilities that each\nagent ascribes to the agents on the other side. Relaxing the notion of\nstability, we declare matching stable if no unmatched pair of agents {\\it\nstrongly\\/} prefer each other to their partners, with ``strength'' measured by\na parameter $\\eps>0$, $\\eps=0$ corresponding to classic stability. We show that\nfor $\\eps$ of order $n^{-1}\\log n$ the expected number of $\\eps$-stable\nmatchings is polynomially large, but for $\\eps\\gg n^{-1}\\log n$ {\\it however\nslightly\\/} the expectation is suddenly super-polynomially large. This\n``explosion'' phenomenon for a very small strength parameter $\\eps$ continues\nto hold for imbalanced matchings, regardless of the imbalance size.",

    "abstract": "Existing studies on bundle construction have relied merely on user feedback\nvia bipartite graphs or enhanced item representations using semantic\ninformation. These approaches fail to capture elaborate relations hidden in\nreal-world bundle structures, resulting in suboptimal bundle representations.\nTo overcome this limitation, we propose RaMen, a novel method that provides a\nholistic multi-strategy approach for bundle construction. RaMen utilizes both\nintrinsic (characteristics) and extrinsic (collaborative signals) information\nto model bundle structures through Explicit Strategy-aware Learning (ESL) and\nImplicit Strategy-aware Learning (ISL). ESL employs task-specific attention\nmechanisms to encode multi-modal data and direct collaborative relations\nbetween items, thereby explicitly capturing essential bundle features.\nMoreover, ISL computes hyperedge dependencies and hypergraph message passing to\nuncover shared latent intents among groups of items. Integrating diverse\nstrategies enables RaMen to learn more comprehensive and robust bundle\nrepresentations. Meanwhile, Multi-strategy Alignment & Discrimination module is\nemployed to facilitate knowledge transfer between learning strategies and\nensure discrimination between items/bundles. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of RaMen over state-of-the-art models on various domains,\njustifying valuable insights into complex item set problems.",

    "abstract": "Parameter efficient fine tuning (PEFT) is a versatile and extensible approach\nfor adapting a Large Language Model (LLM) for newer tasks. One of the most\nprominent PEFT approaches, Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA), primarily focuses on\nadjusting the attention weight matrices within individual decoder blocks of a\nGenerative Pre trained Transformer (GPT2). In contrast, we introduce Solo\nConnection a novel method that adapts the representation at the decoder-block\nlevel rather than modifying individual weight matrices. Not only does Solo\nConnection outperform LoRA on E2E natural language generation benchmarks, but\nit also reduces the number of trainable parameters by 59% relative to LoRA and\nby more than 99% compared to full fine-tuning of GPT2, an early version of\nLarge Language Models (LLMs). Solo Connection is also motivated by homotopy\ntheory: we introduce a trainable linear transformation that gradually\ninterpolates between a zero vector and the task-specific representation,\nenabling smooth and stable adaptation over time. While skip connections in the\noriginal 12 layer GPT2 are typically confined to individual decoder blocks,\nsubsequent GPT2 variants scale up to 48 layers, and even larger language models\ncan include 128 or more decoder blocks. These expanded architectures underscore\nthe need to revisit how skip connections are employed during fine-tuning.

While this problem has been widely studied in\ntraditional recommendation settings, its implications for bundle recommendation\n(BR) remain largely unexplored. This emerging task introduces additional\ncomplexity: recommendations are generated at the bundle level, yet user\nsatisfaction and product (or supplier) exposure depend on both the bundle and\nthe individual items it contains. Existing fairness frameworks and metrics\ndesigned for traditional recommender systems may not directly translate to this\nmulti-layered setting. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive\nreproducibility study of product-side fairness in BR across three real-world\ndatasets using four state-of-the-art BR methods. We analyze exposure\ndisparities at both the bundle and item levels using multiple fairness metrics,\nuncovering important patterns. Our results show that exposure patterns differ\nnotably between bundles and items, revealing the need for fairness\ninterventions that go beyond bundle-level assumptions. We also find that\nfairness assessments vary considerably depending on the metric used,\nreinforcing the need for multi-faceted evaluation. Furthermore, user behavior\nplays a critical role: when users interact more frequently with bundles than\nwith individual items, BR systems tend to yield fairer exposure distributions\nacross both levels. Overall, our findings offer actionable insights for\nbuilding fairer bundle recommender systems and establish a vital foundation for\nfuture research in this emerging domain.",

We\nsequentially update curves site-by-site using the KM influence function, which\nis a measure of the direction in which an observation should shift our estimate\nand so can be used to incorporate new observations without access to previous\ndata.

However, the complexity increases for Level 4 systems,\nwhere, in most cases, no physical driver remains in the vehicle. The two common\nindustry solutions for this challenge are the integration of a remote support\nsystem, such as a Remote Driving System (RDS) or Remote Assistance System\n(RAS). While it is clear that ADS will require one of these systems, it is less\nclear how the suitability of either system for a particular ADS application\nshould be evaluated. Currently, the selection process often focuses on system\narchitecture as well as its design and integration challenges. Furthermore,\nsince many ADS developers choose to develop remote system solutions in-house,\nit is advantageous to select the simpler approach to streamline development and\nintegration efforts. While these decision points are certainly relevant, this\napproach overlooks the most critical factors: the use cases and the\ncomplementarity of the ADS and the remote support system within the context of\nthe Operational Design Design Domain (ODD). This paper proposes a structured\napproach for selecting between RDS and RAS as an ADS support system, based on\nthe defined ODD and use case analysis. To achieve this, the paper applies the\nPEGASUS framework to systematically describe and analyze the ODD. A structured\nframework is introduced to evaluate and select the most suitable remote support\nsystem for an ADS based on clearly defined criteria.",

In\nsuch systems, only a few variables contribute nonlinearly to the dynamics,\nwhile the majority influence the equations linearly. MENO exploits this\nproperty by decomposing the system into two components: the low-dimensional\nnonlinear part is modeled using conventional neural operators, while the linear\ntime-varying subsystem is integrated using a novel neural matrix exponential\nformulation. This approach combines the exact solution of linear time-invariant\nsystems with learnable, time-dependent graph-based corrections applied to the\nlinear operators. Unlike black-box or soft-constrained physics-informed (PI)\nmodels, MENO embeds the governing equations directly into its architecture,\nensuring physical consistency (e.g., steady states), improved robustness, and\nmore efficient training. We validate MENO on three complex thermochemical\nsystems: the POLLU atmospheric chemistry model, an oxygen mixture in\nthermochemical nonequilibrium, and a collisional-radiative argon plasma in one-\nand two-dimensional shock-tube simulations. MENO achieves relative errors below\n2% in trained zero-dimensional settings and maintains good accuracy in\nextrapolatory multidimensional regimes. It also delivers substantial\ncomputational speedups, achieving up to 4 800$\\times$ on GPU and 185$\\times$ on\nCPU compared to standard implicit ODE solvers.

For example, among drivers\non 65-mph roads for the SHRP 2 NDS, females aged 16-19 exceeded the speed limit\nby 7.5 to 15 mph slightly more often than their male counterparts, and younger\ndrivers maintained headways under 1.5 seconds more frequently than older\ndrivers.

This reverberation\nresponse provides insights into the structure and dynamics of the Broad Line\nRegion (BLR). In Rosborough et al., 2024, we introduced a new forward-modeling\ntool, the Broad Emission Line MApping Code (BELMAC), which simulates the\nvelocity-resolved reverberation response of the BLR to an input light curve. In\nthis work, we describe a new version of BELMAC, which uses photoionization\nmodels to calculate the cloud luminosities for selected BELs. We investigated\nthe reverberation responses of H$\\alpha$, H$\\beta$, MgII$\\lambda$2800 and\nCIV$\\lambda$1550 for models representing a disk-like BLR with Keplerian\nrotation, radiatively driven outflows, and inflows. The line responses\ngenerally provide a good indication of the respective luminosity-weighted\nradii. However, there are situations when the BLR exhibits a negative response\nto the driving continuum, causing overestimates of the luminosity-weighted\nradius. The virial mass derived from the models can differ dramatically from\nthe actual SMBH mass, depending mainly on the disk inclination and velocity\nfield. In single zone models, the BELs exhibit similar responses and profile\nshapes; two-zone models, such as a Keplerian disk and a biconical outflow, can\nreproduce observed differences between high- and low-ionization lines. Radial\nflows produce asymmetric line profile shapes due to both anisotropic cloud\nemission and electron scattering in an inter-cloud medium.

On the miniF2F benchmark, ProofCompass\ndemonstrates substantial resource efficiency: it outperforms DSP-v1.5 ($54.9\\%\n\\rightarrow 55.3\\%$) while using 25x fewer attempts ($3200 \\rightarrow 128$).\nOur synergistic approach paves the way for simultaneously improving\ncomputational efficiency and accuracy in formal theorem proving.",

    "abstract": "OWL (Web Ontology Language) ontologies which are able to formally represent\ncomplex knowledge and support semantic reasoning have been widely adopted\nacross various domains such as healthcare and bioinformatics. Recently,\nontology embeddings have gained wide attention due to its potential to infer\nplausible new knowledge and approximate complex reasoning. However, existing\nmethods face notable limitations: geometric model-based embeddings typically\noverlook valuable textual information, resulting in suboptimal performance,\nwhile the approaches that incorporate text, which are often based on language\nmodels, fail to preserve the logical structure. In this work, we propose a new\nontology embedding method OnT, which tunes a Pretrained Language Model (PLM)\nvia geometric modeling in a hyperbolic space for effectively incorporating\ntextual labels and simultaneously preserving class hierarchies and other\nlogical relationships of Description Logic EL. Extensive experiments on four\nreal-world ontologies show that OnT consistently outperforms the baselines\nincluding the state-of-the-art across both tasks of prediction and inference of\naxioms. OnT also demonstrates strong potential in real-world applications,\nindicated by its robust transfer learning abilities and effectiveness in real\ncases of constructing a new ontology from SNOMED CT.

    "abstract": "Accurate prediction of critical heat flux (CHF) is an essential component of\nsafety analysis in pressurized and boiling water reactors. To support reliable\nprediction of this quantity, several empirical correlations and lookup tables\nhave been constructed from physical experiments over the past several decades.\nWith the onset of accessible machine learning (ML) frameworks, multiple\ninitiatives have been established with the goal of predicting CHF more\naccurately than these traditional methods. While purely data-driven surrogate\nmodeling has been extensively investigated, these approaches lack\ninterpretability, lack resilience to data scarcity, and have been developed\nmostly using data from tube experiments. As a result, bias-correction hybrid\napproaches have become increasingly popular, which correct initial\n\"low-fidelity\" estimates provided by deterministic base models by using\nML-predicted residuals. This body of work has mostly considered round tube\ngeometries; annular geometry-specific ML models have not yet been deployed in\nthermal hydraulic codes. This study developed, deployed, and validated four ML\nmodels to predict CHF in annular geometries using the CTF subchannel code.\nThree empirical correlation models, Biasi, Bowring, and Katto, were used as\nbase models for comparison. The ML models were trained and tested using 577\nexperimental annulus data points from four datasets: Becker, Beus, Janssen, and\nMortimore. Baseline CHF predictions were obtained from the empirical\ncorrelations, with mean relative errors above 26%. The ML-driven models\nachieved mean relative errors below 3.5%, with no more than one point exceeding\nthe 10% error envelope. In all cases, the hybrid ML models significantly\noutperformed their empirical counterparts.",

    "abstract": "With the increasing frequency of major natural disasters, understanding their\npolitical consequences is of paramount importance for democratic\naccountability. The existing literature is deeply divided, with some studies\nfinding that voters punish incumbents for disaster-related damages, while\nothers find they reward them for relief efforts. This paper investigates the\nelectoral consequences of natural disasters for incumbent mayors, broader\nelectoral dynamics, and the long-term political ambition of officeholders. The\nstudy leverages a comprehensive panel dataset of over 10,000 candidate-election\nobservations in U.S. mayoral races from 1989 to 2021, combining detailed\nelection data with a global registry of disaster events. To identify causal\neffects, the analysis employs a robust dynamic two-way fixed-effects\nevent-study design, validated by extensive pre-trend and placebo tests. The\nfindings reveal that the electoral impact of disasters is highly conditional on\ntheir timing. A disaster that strikes in the same quarter as an election\nprovides a significant electoral boost to incumbents, increasing their vote\nshare by over 6 percentage points. However, disasters consistently suppress\nvoter turnout, reducing it by an average of 1.4 percentage points. In a novel\nfinding, the analysis demonstrates that the experience of managing a disaster\nsignificantly increases an incumbent's likelihood of seeking re-election in the\nsubsequent cycle by as much as 12 percentage points. These findings help\nreconcile conflicting theories of retrospective voting by highlighting the\ncritical role of voter myopia and salience. They also reveal a previously\nundocumented channel through which crises shape political careers, suggesting\nthat disaster management is not only a test of governance but also a catalyst\nfor political ambition.

At its core, this\nchallenge is pinpointed by the question of how quantum effects can persist at\nasymptotic scales, analogous to quantum critical points in equilibrium. In this\nwork, we construct such a scenario using fermions as building blocks. These\nfermions undergo an absorbing-to-absorbing state transition between two\ntopologically distinct and quantum-correlated dark states. Starting from a\nmicroscopic, interacting Lindbladian, we derive an effective Lindblad-Keldysh\nfield theory in which critical fermions couple to a bosonic bath with\nhydrodynamic fluctuations associated with particle number conservation. A key\nfeature of this field theory is an emergent symmetry that protects the purity\nof the fermions' state even in the presence of the thermal bath. We\nquantitatively characterise the critical point using a leading-order expansion\naround the upper critical dimension, thereby establishing the first\nnon-equilibrium universality class of fermions. The symmetry protection\nmechanism, which exhibits parallels to the problem of directed percolation,\nsuggests a pathway toward a broader class of robust, universal quantum\nphenomena in fermionic systems.",

Advances in indoor sensing and artificial intelligence (AI) can support\nthese decisions by visualizing real-time situational data and AI suggestions on\n2D maps. However, mentally mapping this information onto real-world spaces\nimposes significant cognitive load. This load can impair users' ability to\nappropriately judge AI suggestions, leading to inappropriate reliance (e.g.,\naccepting wrong AI suggestions or rejecting correct ones). Embedded\nvisualizations in Augmented Reality (AR), by directly overlaying information\nonto physical environments, may reduce this load and foster more deliberate,\nappropriate reliance on AI. But is this true? In this work, we conducted an\nempirical study (N = 32) comparing AR see-through (embedded visualization) and\n2D Minimap in time-critical, AI-assisted spatial target selection tasks.\nContrary to our expectations, users exhibited greater inappropriate reliance on\nAI in the AR condition. Our analysis further reveals that this is primarily due\nto over-reliance, with factors specific to embedded visualizations, such as\nperceptual challenges, visual proximity illusions, and highly realistic visual\nrepresentations. Nonetheless, embedded visualizations demonstrated notable\nbenefits in spatial reasoning, such as spatial mapping and egocentric spatial\nimagery.

We explore the challenges,\napplications, and advantages of ISAC systems in next-generation networks,\nhighlighting the significance of optimizing position and power control. Our\napproach integrates HAPS and UAVs to enhance wireless coverage, particularly in\nremote areas. UAVs function as dual-purpose access points (APs), using their\nmaneuverability and line-of-sight (LoS) aerial-to-ground (A2G) links to\ntransmit combined communication and sensing signals. The scheme operates in two\ntime slots: in the first slot, UAVs transmit dedicated signals to communication\nusers (CUs) and potential targets. UAVs detect targets in specific ground\nlocations and, after signal transmission, receive reflected signals from\ntargets. In the second slot, UAVs relay these signals to HAPS, which performs\nbeamforming to align signals for each CU from various UAVs. UAVs decode\ninformation from HAPS and adjust transmissions to maximize the beam pattern\nefficiency toward the desired targets. We formulate a multi-objective\noptimization problem to maximize both the minimum\nsignal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) for CUs and the echo signal\npower from the targets. This is achieved by finding the optimal power\nallocation for CUs in each UAV, subject to constraints on the maximum total\npower in each UAV and the transmitted beam pattern gain. Simulation results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in enhancing network\nperformance, resource allocation, fairness, and system optimization.

We determine the black hole's remnant radius and mass, which provide\nuseful residual information at the end of its evaporation. We then explore the\nluminosity of the accretion disk from the SBH-HDM model. In this way, we\ndetermine the key orbital parameters of the test particles within the accretion\ndisk, such as angular velocity, angular momentum, energy, and the radius of the\ninnermost stable circular orbit, based on the dark matter model parameters. We\nalso numerically estimate the accretion disk's efficiency in converting matter\ninto radiation. We also demonstrate that dark matter, which significantly\nalters the geometry surrounding a Schwarzschild black hole, influences the\naccretion disk's radiative flux, temperature, differential luminosity, and\nspectral luminosity. The stability of a black hole spacetime is determined in\nthe eikonal regime. The Lyapunov exponent is also analyzed to quantify the\nstability of the particle regime and to demonstrate the infall into or escape\nfrom the black hole to infinity, as well as the quasi-normal modes.

    "abstract": "Multilingual large language models (LLMs) often demonstrate a performance gap\nbetween English and non-English languages, particularly in low-resource\nsettings. Aligning these models to low-resource languages is essential yet\nchallenging due to limited high-quality data. While English alignment datasets\nare readily available, curating equivalent data in other languages is expensive\nand time-consuming. A common workaround is to translate existing English\nalignment data; however, standard translation techniques often fail to preserve\ncritical elements such as code, mathematical expressions, and structured\nformats like JSON. In this work, we investigate LLM-based selective\ntranslation, a technique that selectively translates only the translatable\nparts of a text while preserving non-translatable content and sentence\nstructure. We conduct a systematic study to explore key questions around this\napproach, including its effectiveness compared to vanilla translation, the\nimportance of filtering noisy outputs, and the benefits of mixing translated\nsamples with original English data during alignment. Our experiments focus on\nthe low-resource Indic language Hindi and compare translations generated by\nGoogle Cloud Translation (GCP) and Llama-3.1-405B.

However, querying specific objects from\nlarge-scale video datasets presents challenges, including (1) processing\nmassive and continuously growing data volumes, (2) supporting complex query\nrequirements, and (3) ensuring low-latency execution. Existing video analysis\nmethods struggle with either limited adaptability to unseen object classes or\nsuffer from high query latency. In this paper, we present LOVO, a novel system\ndesigned to efficiently handle comp$\\underline{L}$ex $\\underline{O}$bject\nqueries in large-scale $\\underline{V}$ide$\\underline{O}$ datasets. Agnostic to\nuser queries, LOVO performs one-time feature extraction using pre-trained\nvisual encoders, generating compact visual embeddings for key frames to build\nan efficient index. These visual embeddings, along with associated bounding\nboxes, are organized in an inverted multi-index structure within a vector\ndatabase, which supports queries for any objects. During the query phase, LOVO\ntransforms object queries to query embeddings and conducts fast approximate\nnearest-neighbor searches on the visual embeddings. Finally, a cross-modal\nrerank is performed to refine the results by fusing visual features with\ndetailed textual features. Evaluation on real-world video datasets demonstrates\nthat LOVO outperforms existing methods in handling complex queries, with\nnear-optimal query accuracy and up to 85x lower search latency, while\nsignificantly reducing index construction costs. This system redefines the\nstate-of-the-art object query approaches in video analysis, setting a new\nbenchmark for complex object queries with a novel, scalable, and efficient\napproach that excels in dynamic environments.",

Each agent is assumed to know its own position\nand simultaneously measure bearing vectors relative to the target. We start by\nintroducing a general continuous time observer design tailored to systems whose\nstate dynamics are modeled as chains of integrators and whose measurement model\nfollows a particular nonlinear but observer-suited form. This design leverages\na correction term that combines innovation and consensus components, allowing\neach agent to broadcast only a part of the state estimate to its neighbours,\nwhich effectively reduces the data flowing across the network. To provide\nuniform exponential stability guarantees, a novel result for a class of\nnonlinear closed-loop systems in a generalized observer form is introduced and\nsubsequently used as the main tool to derive stability conditions on the\nobserver gains. Then, by exploring the properties of orthogonal projection\nmatrices, the proposed design is used to solve the distributed target tracking\nproblem and provide explicit stability conditions that depend on the\ntarget-agents geometric formation. Practical examples are derived for a target\nmodeled as first-, second-, and third-order integrator dynamics, highlighting\nthe design procedure and the stability conditions imposed.

Based\non the Hamiltonian formulation, the Canonical Quantum Gravity approach\ninherently provides a natural framework for defining observables.

Existing\nReinforcement Learning (RL) methods train large reasoning models on a\nsingle-turn paradigm with verifiable rewards. However, we observe that models\ntrained with existing RL paradigms often lose their ability to solve problems\nacross multiple turns and struggle to revise answers based on contextual\nfeedback, leading to repetitive responses. We ask: can LRMs learn to reflect\ntheir answers in a multi-turn context? In this work, we find that training\nmodels with multi-turn RL using only unary feedback (e.g., \"Let's try again\")\nafter wrong answers can improve both single-turn performance and multi-turn\nreasoning. We introduce Unary Feedback as Observation (UFO) for reinforcement\nlearning, which uses minimal yet common unary user feedback during iterative\nproblem solving. It can be easily applied to existing single-turn RL training\nsetups. Experimental results show that RL training with UFO keeps single-turn\nperformance and improves multi-turn reasoning accuracy by up to 14%, enabling\nlanguage models to better react to feedback in multi-turn problem solving. To\nfurther minimize the number of turns needed for a correct answer while\nencouraging diverse reasoning when mistakes occur, we design reward structures\nthat guide models to produce careful and deliberate answers in each turn.

To\naddress this critical challenge, we introduce WebGuard, the first comprehensive\ndataset designed to support the assessment of web agent action risks and\nfacilitate the development of guardrails for real-world online environments. In\ndoing so, WebGuard specifically focuses on predicting the outcome of\nstate-changing actions and contains 4,939 human-annotated actions from 193\nwebsites across 22 diverse domains, including often-overlooked long-tail\nwebsites.

    "abstract": "A popular model for Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) is the detonation of a CO\nwhite dwarf (WD) that is triggered by the prior detonation of a thin surface\nlayer of helium, known as a double detonation (DD). We explore the unique early\nelectromagnetic signatures that are expected from collision of the CO\ndetonation with the He detonation. The three features are (1) a shock breakout\nflash, (2) a stage of planar shock breakout cooling, and finally (3) shock\ncooling emission from the thermal energy released by the collision. The planar\nphase is unique to the unusual density profile of the He-detonated layer in\ncomparison to the steep profile at a stellar edge as is usually considered for\nshock breakout. The shock cooling emission can be modified by recombination,\nand we explore these effects. All together, we expect an initial flash\ndominated by the planar phase of $\\sim6\\times10^{43}\\,{\\rm erg\\,s^{-1}}$, which\nlasts ~5 s in the soft X-rays. This is followed by ~12-24 hrs of shock cooling\nat a luminosity of $3-10\\times10^{40}\\,{\\rm erg\\,s^{-1}}$ in the optical/UV.

In this paper, we identify five benchmark cases, where at\nmost one mixing angle is nonzero and analyze the 95% C.L. allowed parameter\nspace by the oblique parameters. In the alignment limit of the 2HDM, we find\nthat other than the usual mass relations of $m_H\\sim m_{H^\\pm}$ or $m_A\\sim\nm_{H^\\pm}$, electroweak precision measurements also impose an upper limit on\nthe neutral Higgs masses.

They are attributed to the catastrophic outcomes of stellar-scale\nevents and, as such, are not expected to recur. Here, we present observations\nof an exceptional GRB\\,250702BDE which triggered the {\\em Fermi} gamma-ray\nburst monitor on three occasions over several hours, and which was detected in\nsoft X-rays by the \\textit{Einstein Probe} a day before the $\\gamma$-ray\ntriggers (EP250702a). We present the discovery of an extremely red infrared\ncounterpart of the event with the VLT, as well as radio observations from\nMeerKAT. Hubble Space Telescope observations pinpoint the source to a\nnon-nuclear location in a host galaxy with complex morphology, implying GRB\n250702BDE is an extragalactic event. The multi-wavelength counterpart is well\ndescribed with standard afterglow models at a relatively low redshift $z \\sim\n0.2$, but the prompt emission does not readily fit within the expectations for\neither collapsar or merger-driven GRBs. Indeed, a striking feature of the\nmultiple prompt outbursts is that the third occurs at an integer multiple of\nthe interval between the first two. Although not conclusive, this could be\nindicative of periodicity in the progenitor system. We discuss several possible\nscenarios to explain the exceptional properties of the burst, which suggest\nthat either a very unusual collapsar or the tidal disruption of a white dwarf\nby an intermediate-mass black hole are plausible explanations for this\nunprecedented GRB.",

The analysed sample comprises about 8000\nclusters, covering an effective area of 839 deg$^{2}$ and extending up to a\nredshift of $z = 0.8$. Stacked cluster weak-lensing and count measurements have\nbeen derived in bins of redshift and intrinsic richness, $\\lambda^*$. Based on\nself-organising maps, we reconstructed the true redshift distributions of the\nbackground galaxy samples. We accounted for the systematic uncertainties\narising from impurities in the background and cluster samples, biases in the\ncluster $z$ and $\\lambda^*$, projection effects, halo orientation and\nmiscentring, truncation of cluster halo mass distributions, matter correlated\nwith cluster haloes, multiplicative shear bias, baryonic matter, geometric\ndistortions in the lensing profiles, uncertainties in the theoretical halo mass\nfunction, and super-sample covariance. We also employed a blinding strategy\nbased on perturbing the cluster sample completeness. The improved statistics\nand photometry compared to the previous KiDS data release, KiDS-DR3, have led\nto a halving of the uncertainties on $\\Omega_{\\rm m}$ and $\\sigma_8$, as we\nobtained $\\Omega_{\\rm m}=0.22\\pm0.02$ and $\\sigma_8=0.86\\pm0.03$.

We focus on the cases with bound post-explosion orbits, where the\nneutron star may periodically gravitationally capture gas from the companion.\nWe find that neutron star accretion must occur if the pre-supernova binary\nseparation is less than about 20 Rsun. This is because the stellar radius\nexpands beyond this radius before the shock-inflated envelope undergoes\nKelvin-Helmholtz contraction back to the main sequence. We then consider the\ninternal shocks formed between adjacent episodes of disk wind. The shocks\nefficiently convert the wind kinetic energy into radiation (due to\ninverse-Compton cooling), which heats up the supernova ejecta located at much\nlarger radii. The extra heating powers bright optical emission that is\nperiodically modulated on the orbital timescale. The shocks also accelerate\nnon-thermal particles which produce gamma-ray and neutrino emission from 100\nMeV to 10 PeV via hardronic pp collisions. The high-energy photons leak out of\nthe supernova ejecta after a delay of several months to one year.\nPhoto-ionization of the slowest parts of the disk wind produces hydrogen\nrecombination lines. We then use the model to explain the puzzling Type Ic\nsupernova SN2022jli which shows a double-peaked optical lightcurve along with\nmany peculiar properties, including delayed onset and rapid shutoff of the\nsecond peak, periodic modulations, delayed GeV emission, and narrow Balmer\nlines. Under this model, SN2022jli had a close-by companion at a pre-supernova\nbinary separation of 10 to 20 Rsun, likely due to an earlier phase of\ncommon-envelope evolution.",

    "abstract": "The Milky Way is surrounded by large amounts of hot gas at temperatures\nT>10^6 K, which represents a major baryon reservoir. We here explore the\nprospects of studying the hot coronal gas in Milky Way halo by analyzing the\nhighly forbidden optical coronal lines of [FeX] and [FeXIV] in absorption\nagainst bright extragalactic background sources. We use a semi-analytic model\nof the Milky Way's coronal gas distribution together wih HESTIA simulations of\nthe Local Group and observational constraints to predict the expected FeX and\nFeXIV column densities as well as the line shapes and strengths. We predict\ncolumn densities of log N(FeX)=15.40 and log N(FeXIV)=15.23 in the Milky Way's\nhot halo and estimate that a minimum S/N of 50,000 (25,000) is required to\ndetect [FeX] l6374.5 ([FeXIV] l5302.9) absorption at a 3sigma level. Using\narchical optical data from an original sample of 739 high resolution AGN\nspectra from VLT/UVES and KECK/HIRES, we generate a stacked composite spectrum\nto measure an upper limit for the column densities of FeX and FeXIV in the\nMilky Way's coronal gas. No [FeX] and [FeXIV] is detected in our composite\nspectrum, which achieves a maximum S/N= 1,240 near 5300 A. We derive 3sigma\nupper column-density limits of log N(FeX)<16.27 and log N(FeXIV)<15.85, in line\nwith the above-mentioned predictions. While [FeX] and [FexIX] absorption is too\nweak to be detected with current optical data, we outline how up-coming\nextragalactic spectral surveys with millions of medium- to high-resolution\noptical spectra will provide the necessary sensitivity and spectral resolution\nto measure velocity-resolved [FeX] and [FeXIV] absorption in the Milky Way's\ncoronal gas (and beyond). This gives the prospect of opening a new window for\nstudying the dominant baryonic mass component of the Milky Way in the form of\nhot coronal gas via optical spectroscopy.",

Beyond model release, we tackle critical limitations in\nSSL clustering methods. While modern models rely on assigning image features to\nlarge codebooks via clustering algorithms like Sinkhorn-Knopp, they fail to\naccount for the inherent ambiguity in clustering semantics. To address this, we\nintroduce a parameter-efficient, multi-head clustering projector based on\nnested Matryoshka representations.

Additionally, we propose a\nnovel positional disentanglement strategy that explicitly removes positional\nbiases from dense representations, thereby improving the encoding of semantic\ncontent. This leads to consistent gains on several downstream benchmarks,\ndemonstrating the utility of cleaner feature spaces.

This provides an independent, lensing-based\ncalibration of halo masses, complementary to methods relying on clustering or\ndynamics.

This work addresses one of the\nkey uncertainties in interpreting kSZ signals -- the unknown host halo mass\ndistribution -- by providing an independent and consistent mass calibration.\nThe agreement between the gas and total mass profiles at large aperture\nsuggests that sufficiently far from the group center (2--3 virial radii), we\nrecover all the baryons, offering a resolution to the 'missing baryon' problem.\nWe further study the cumulative gas fractions for all galaxies as well as for\nthe most massive galaxy groups in the sample ($\\log(M_{\\rm halo}/(M_\\odot/h))\n\\approx 13.5$), finding values that are physically sensible and in agreement\nwith previous findings using kSZ and X-ray data: compared to the TNG300\nsimulation, the observed gas fractions are systematically lower at fixed radius\nby $\\gtrsim$4$\\sigma$, providing compelling, independent evidence for stronger\nbaryonic feedback in the real Universe. These findings highlight the power of\ncombining CMB lensing with galaxy surveys to probe the interplay between\nbaryons and dark matter in group-sized halos.",

We show that this framework fails dramatically for mixed\ninitial states, evolved unitarily, even with infinitesimal initial mixedness.\nTo address this, we introduce a new paradigm of deep thermalisation for mixed\nstates, fundamentally distinct from that for pure-state ensembles. In our\nformulation, the deep thermal ensemble arises by tracing out auxiliary degrees\nof freedom from a maximum-entropy ensemble defined on an augmented system, with\nthe ensemble structure depending explicitly on the entropy of the initial\nstate. We demonstrate that such ensembles emerge dynamically in generic,\nlocally interacting chaotic systems. For the self-dual kicked Ising chain,\nwhich we show to be exactly solvable for a class of mixed initial states, we\nfind exact emergence of the so-defined mixed-state deep thermal ensemble at\nfinite times. Our results therefore lead to fundamental insights into how\nmaximum entropy principles and deep thermalisation manifest themselves in\nunitary dynamics of states with finite entropy.",

Here, we\ninvestigate the relation between three approaches to QRFs for gauge symmetries,\nnamely the effective semiclassical, algebraic, and perspective-neutral (PN)\napproaches. Rather than constructing Hilbert spaces, as the PN approach, the\neffective approach is based on a quantum phase space parametrized by\nexpectation values and fluctuations, while the emphasis of the algebraic\napproach is on the state space of complex linear functionals on a kinematical\nalgebra. Nevertheless, external frame information is treated as gauge in all\nthree formalisms, manifested in constraints on states and algebra. We show that\nthese three approaches are, in fact, equivalent for ideal QRFs, distinguished\nby sharp orientations, which is the previous setting of the first two\napproaches. Our demonstration pertains to single constraints, including\nrelativistic ones, and encompasses QRF changes. In particular, the QRF\ntransformations of the PN framework agree semiclassically with those of the\nolder effective approach, by which it was inspired. As a physical application,\nwe explore the QRF covariance of uncertainties and fluctuations, which turn out\nto be frame-dependent. This is particularly well-suited for the effective and\nalgebraic approaches, for which these quantities form a natural basis. Finally,\nwe pave the way towards extending these two approaches to non-ideal QRFs by\nstudying the projection and gauge-fixing operations of the Page-Wootters\nformalism, built into the PN framework, on algebraic states.",

The estimation relies on\nan optimized filtration of the mutual information associated with the\nbitstrings obtained from public facilities of configurable Rydberg arrays named\nAquila.

    "abstract": "Temporal causal representation learning is a powerful tool for uncovering\ncomplex patterns in observational studies, which are often represented as\nlow-dimensional time series. However, in many real-world applications, data are\nhigh-dimensional with varying input lengths and naturally take the form of\nirregular tensors. To analyze such data, irregular tensor decomposition is\ncritical for extracting meaningful clusters that capture essential information.\nIn this paper, we focus on modeling causal representation learning based on the\ntransformed information. First, we present a novel causal formulation for a set\nof latent clusters. We then propose CaRTeD, a joint learning framework that\nintegrates temporal causal representation learning with irregular tensor\ndecomposition. Notably, our framework provides a blueprint for downstream tasks\nusing the learned tensor factors, such as modeling latent structures and\nextracting causal information, and offers a more flexible regularization design\nto enhance tensor decomposition. Theoretically, we show that our algorithm\nconverges to a stationary point. More importantly, our results fill the gap in\ntheoretical guarantees for the convergence of state-of-the-art irregular tensor\ndecomposition. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world electronic\nhealth record (EHR) datasets (MIMIC-III), with extensive benchmarks from both\nphenotyping and network recovery perspectives, demonstrate that our proposed\nmethod outperforms state-of-the-art techniques and enhances the explainability\nof causal representations.",

However,\nconventional imbalance strategies fundamentally conflict with KANs mathematical\nstructure as resampling and focal loss implementations significantly degrade\nKANs performance, while marginally benefiting MLPs. Crucially, KANs suffer from\nprohibitive computational costs without proportional performance gains.\nStatistical validation confirms that MLPs with imbalance techniques achieve\nequivalence with KANs (|d| < 0.08 across metrics) at minimal resource costs.\nThese findings reveal that KANs represent a specialized solution for raw\nimbalanced data where resources permit. But their severe performance-resource\ntradeoffs and incompatibility with standard resampling techniques currently\nlimits practical deployment.

We derive the cosmology-dependent mapping that relates the linear\n(Lagrangian) and fully non-linear (Eulerian) evolution of the matter density\ncontrast, a central component for accurate theoretical modeling of void\nstatistics. Furthermore, we present a new method for determining the\nshell-crossing epoch across arbitrary cosmological backgrounds, thereby\nextending previous treatments restricted to the Einstein-de Sitter universe.\n  Motivated by recent DESI results hinting at dynamical dark energy, we\ninvestigate void evolution in $ w_0w_a$CDM cosmologies by varying $ w_0$ and\n$w_a$. We also consider the impact of varying the matter density parameter, $\n\\Omega_{\\mathrm{m},0}$. We find that the evolution of isolated, spherically\nsymmetric cosmic voids is most sensitive to $ \\Omega_{\\mathrm{m},0} $ and $ w_0\n$, which can alter the non-linear density contrast by up to 20-30%.

We propose\nan interferometry geometry that parallels an optical Mach-Zehnder\ninterferometer and offers several advantages over existing interferometry\nschemes. In contrast to the currently studied electronic Mach-Zehnder\ninterferometer, our setup has no drain inside the device so that the trapped\ntopological charge is time-independent. In contrast to electronic Fabry-P\\'erot\ninterferometry, anyons cannot go around the device more than once. Thus, the\ninterference signal has a straightforward interpretation in terms of anyonic\nstatistical phases. The proposed geometry suppresses the undesirable effects of\nbulk-edge coupling. Moreover, the setup allows for simple exact solutions for\nthe electric current and noise for an arbitrary quasiparticle tunneling\nstrength in a broad range of conditions. The structure of the solutions is\nsimilar to that for non-interacting electrons but reflects fractional charge\nand statistics. We present results for electric current and noise in Jain\nstates and address thermal interferometry at zero voltage bias.",

Processors may communicate as needed.\nAlgorithms are assessed by the number of passes, per-item processing time,\ntotal runtime, space usage, communication cost, and solution quality.\n  We design a single-pass algorithm in this model for approximating the maximum\nweight matching (MWM) problem. Given $k$ edge streams and a parameter\n$\\varepsilon > 0$, the algorithm computes a\n$\\left(2+\\epsilon\\right)$-approximate MWM. We analyze its performance in a\nshared-memory parallel setting: for any constant $\\varepsilon > 0$, it runs in\ntime $\\widetilde{O}\\left(L_{\\max}+n\\right)$, where $n$ is the number of\nvertices and $L_{\\max}$ is the maximum stream length. It supports\n$O\\left(1\\right)$ per-edge processing time using $\\widetilde{O}\\left(k\\cdot\nn\\right)$ space. We further generalize the design to hierarchical\narchitectures, in which $k$ processors are partitioned into $r$ groups, each\nwith its own shared local memory.

While recent advances\nin LLMs show promise for code generation, current SOTA models achieve low\nsuccess rates in improving CUDA speed. In this paper, we introduce CUDA-L1, an\nautomated reinforcement learning framework for CUDA optimization that employs a\nnovel contrastive RL algorithm.\n  CUDA-L1 achieves significant performance improvements on the CUDA\noptimization task: trained on A100, it delivers an average speedup of x3.12\nwith a median speedup of x1.42 against default baselines over across all 250\nCUDA kernels of KernelBench, with peak speedups reaching x120. In addition to\nthe default baseline provided by KernelBench, CUDA-L1 demonstrates x2.77 over\nTorch Compile, x2.88 over Torch Compile with reduce overhead, x2.81 over CUDA\nGraph implementations, and remarkably x7.72 over cuDNN libraries. Furthermore,\nthe model also demonstrates portability across different GPU architectures.\n  Beyond these benchmark results, CUDA-L1 demonstrates several properties: it\n1) discovers a variety of CUDA optimization techniques and learns to combine\nthem strategically to achieve optimal performance; 2) uncovers fundamental\nprinciples of CUDA optimization, such as the multiplicative nature of\noptimizations; 3) identifies non-obvious performance bottlenecks and rejects\nseemingly beneficial optimizations that actually harm performance.

Current motion planning methods\noften fail to effectively utilize prior motion experiences and adapt to\nreal-time uncertainties inherent in underwater settings. In this paper, we\nintroduce an Adaptive Heuristic Motion Planner framework that integrates a\nHeuristic Motion Space (HMS) with Bayesian Networks to enhance motion planning\nfor autonomous underwater manipulation. Our approach employs the Probabilistic\nRoadmap (PRM) algorithm within HMS to optimize paths by minimizing a composite\ncost function that accounts for distance, uncertainty, energy consumption, and\nexecution time. By leveraging HMS, our framework significantly reduces the\nsearch space, thereby boosting computational performance and enabling real-time\nplanning capabilities. Bayesian Networks are utilized to dynamically update\nuncertainty estimates based on real-time sensor data and environmental\nconditions, thereby refining the joint probability of path success. Through\nextensive simulations and real-world test scenarios, we showcase the advantages\nof our method in terms of enhanced performance and robustness.

However, their unpredictability,\ncombined with the high potential for harm in this domain, means rigorous\nevaluation is necessary. Our goals with this track were to stimulate research\nand to provide high-quality evaluation of the most promising systems.\n  Methods: We hosted the Plain Language Adaptation of Biomedical Abstracts\n(PLABA) track at the 2023 and 2024 Text Retrieval Conferences. Tasks included\ncomplete, sentence-level, rewriting of abstracts (Task 1) as well as\nidentifying and replacing difficult terms (Task 2). For automatic evaluation of\nTask 1, we developed a four-fold set of professionally-written references.\nSubmissions for both Tasks 1 and 2 were provided extensive manual evaluation\nfrom biomedical experts.\n  Results: Twelve teams spanning twelve countries participated in the track,\nwith models from multilayer perceptrons to large pretrained transformers. In\nmanual judgments of Task 1, top-performing models rivaled human levels of\nfactual accuracy and completeness, but not simplicity or brevity. Automatic,\nreference-based metrics generally did not correlate well with manual judgments.\nIn Task 2, systems struggled with identifying difficult terms and classifying\nhow to replace them. When generating replacements, however, LLM-based systems\ndid well in manually judged accuracy, completeness, and simplicity, though not\nin brevity.\n  Conclusion: The PLABA track showed promise for using Large Language Models to\nadapt biomedical literature for the general public, while also highlighting\ntheir deficiencies and the need for improved automatic benchmarking tools.",

The presence of multiple identical objects\nwithin a scene often leads to ambiguities for appearance-based feature matching\nalgorithms. Our work circumvents this challenge by exclusively employing\ngeometrical constraints, specifically epipolar geometry, for feature\nassociation. We introduce C-DOG (Connected delta-Overlap Graph), an algorithm\ndesigned for robust geometrical feature association, even in the presence of\nnoisy feature detections. In a C-DOG graph, two nodes representing 2D feature\npoints from distinct views are connected by an edge if they correspond to the\nsame 3D point. Each edge is weighted by its epipolar distance. Ideally, true\nassociations yield a zero distance; however, noisy feature detections can\nresult in non-zero values. To robustly retain edges where the epipolar distance\nis less than a threshold delta, we employ a Szymkiewicz--Simpson coefficient.\nThis process leads to a delta-neighbor-overlap clustering of 2D nodes.\nFurthermore, unreliable nodes are pruned from these clusters using an\nInter-quartile Range (IQR)-based criterion. Our extensive experiments on\nsynthetic benchmarks demonstrate that C-DOG not only outperforms geometry-based\nbaseline algorithms but also remains remarkably robust under demanding\nconditions. This includes scenes with high object density, no visual features,\nand restricted camera overlap, positioning C-DOG as an excellent solution for\nscalable 3D reconstruction in practical applications.",

The study is\nmotivated by the anomalous behavior of the ${21/2}^+$ isomeric state in\n$^{93}$Mo, a prominent candidate for nuclear excitation by electron capture\n(NEEC), which misses an $E2$ decay branch due to a higher-lying ${17/2}^+$\nstate and instead proceeds via a long-lived $E4$ isomeric transition. Employing\na consistent configuration space and empirically derived effective interaction,\nwe extract and compare the proton-proton and neutron-proton matrix elements for\nthe four $N=51$ isotones. Our results show a distinct dominance of the\nneutron-proton interaction in $^{93}$Mo, in contrast to its\nneighbors--$^{95}$Ru, $^{97}$Pd, and $^{99}$Cd--where no analogous isomeric\nbehavior emerges due to structural evolution. These findings reveal that the\nfavorable structure for NEEC in $^{93}$Mo stems from subtle interaction\nsystematics that do not persist across the chain. We find that the $E2$\nstrength of the key NEEC transition is reduced by 40\\% compared to the\npreviously estimated value. The analysis provides microscopic insights into the\norigin of long-lived isomerism in medium-mass nuclei and outlines a framework\nfor identifying future candidates in other mass regions for exploiting the\npotential energy storage capacities of isomeric states.",

Possessing awareness of event memorability for a\nuser could help intelligent systems in more accurate user modelling, especially\nfor such applications as meeting support systems, memory augmentation, and\nmeeting summarisation. Emotion recognition has been widely studied, since\nemotions are thought to signal moments of high personal relevance to users. The\nemotional experience of situations and their memorability have traditionally\nbeen considered to be closely tied to one another: moments that are experienced\nas highly emotional are considered to also be highly memorable. This\nrelationship suggests that emotional annotations could serve as proxies for\nmemorability. However, existing emotion recognition systems rely heavily on\nthird-party annotations, which may not accurately represent the first-person\nexperience of emotional relevance and memorability. This is why, in this study,\nwe empirically examine the relationship between perceived group emotions\n(Pleasure-Arousal) and group memorability in the context of conversational\ninteractions. Our investigation involves continuous time-based annotations of\nboth emotions and memorability in dynamic, unstructured group settings,\napproximating conditions of real-world conversational AI applications such as\nonline meeting support systems. Our results show that the observed relationship\nbetween affect and memorability annotations cannot be reliably distinguished\nfrom what might be expected under random chance.

Our DFT+DMFT calculations successfully reproduce the correlated\nmetallic behavior of CaCrO$_3$ and quantitatively capture the incoherent state\nobserved experimentally. We also identify that the altermagnetic CaCrO$_3$ is a\nHund's metal. The incoherent state is attributed to Hund's coupling, which\ngives rise to a non-Fermi liquid behavior. Moreover, we find that\naltermagnetism can induce flat bands, and these incipient flat bands are\nfurther promoted by the strong renormalization from Hundness, which further\ndrives a heavy-fermion behavior. Hence, we establish CaCrO$_3$ as a strongly\ncorrelated altermagnet and propose that Hund's metals provide an ideal platform\nfor investigating the interplay between electronic correlation and\naltermagnetism.

For\ninstance, in the widely used Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III\n(MIMIC-III) dataset, only about $8.56\\%$ of hospital visits include progress\nnotes, leaving gaps in longitudinal patient narratives. In contrast, the\ndataset contains a diverse array of other note types, each capturing different\naspects of care.\n  We present DENSE (Documenting Evolving Progress Notes from Scattered\nEvidence), a system designed to align with clinical documentation workflows by\nsimulating how physicians reference past encounters while drafting progress\nnotes. The system introduces a fine-grained note categorization and a temporal\nalignment mechanism that organizes heterogeneous notes across visits into\nstructured, chronological inputs. At its core, DENSE leverages a clinically\ninformed retrieval strategy to identify temporally and semantically relevant\ncontent from both current and prior visits. This retrieved evidence is used to\nprompt a large language model (LLM) to generate clinically coherent and\ntemporally aware progress notes.\n  We evaluate DENSE on a curated cohort of patients with multiple visits and\ncomplete progress note documentation. The generated notes demonstrate strong\nlongitudinal fidelity, achieving a temporal alignment ratio of $1.089$,\nsurpassing the continuity observed in original notes.

We applied this to the CPz catalog, containing multi-survey\nphotometric and spectroscopic data, and compared performance with a fully\nsupervised random forest. Our SSL approach achieves F1 scores of 98.8%, 98.9%,\nand 92.0% for stars, galaxies, and quasars, respectively, closely matching the\nsupervised method with F1 scores of 99.1%, 99.1%, and 93.1%, while\noutperforming traditional color-cut techniques. The method demonstrates\nrobustness in high-dimensional feature spaces and superior label efficiency\ncompared to prior work. This work highlights SSL as a scalable solution for\nastronomical classification when labeled data is limited, though performance\nmay be degraded in lower dimensional settings.",

Brain-inspired computing,\nparticularly Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), offers a promising alternative by\nemulating biological neuronal dynamics to achieve low-power, event-driven\ncomputation.

We present a\nsystematic taxonomy of EdgeSNN foundations, encompassing neuron models,\nlearning algorithms, and supporting hardware platforms. Three representative\npractical considerations of EdgeSNN are discussed in depth: on-device inference\nusing lightweight SNN models, resource-aware training and updating under\nnon-stationary data conditions, and secure and privacy-preserving issues.\nFurthermore, we highlight the limitations of evaluating EdgeSNNs on\nconventional hardware and introduce a dual-track benchmarking strategy to\nsupport fair comparisons and hardware-aware optimization. Through this study,\nwe aim to bridge the gap between brain-inspired learning and practical edge\ndeployment, offering insights into current advancements, open challenges, and\nfuture research directions.

    "abstract": "Recent studies in continual learning have identified a transient drop in\nperformance on mastered tasks when assimilating new ones, known as the\nstability gap. Such dynamics contradict the objectives of continual learning,\nrevealing a lack of robustness in mitigating forgetting, and notably,\npersisting even under an ideal joint-loss regime. Examining this gap within\nthis idealized joint training context is critical to isolate it from other\nsources of forgetting. We argue that it reflects an imbalance between rapid\nadaptation and robust retention at task boundaries, underscoring the need to\ninvestigate mechanisms that reconcile plasticity and stability within continual\nlearning frameworks. Biological brains navigate a similar dilemma by operating\nconcurrently on multiple timescales, leveraging neuromodulatory signals to\nmodulate synaptic plasticity. However, artificial networks lack native\nmultitimescale dynamics, and although optimizers like momentum-SGD and Adam\nintroduce implicit timescale regularization, they still exhibit stability gaps.\nInspired by locus coeruleus mediated noradrenergic bursts, which transiently\nenhance neuronal gain under uncertainty to facilitate sensory assimilation, we\npropose uncertainty-modulated gain dynamics - an adaptive mechanism that\napproximates a two-timescale optimizer and dynamically balances integration of\nknowledge with minimal interference on previously consolidated information. We\nevaluate our mechanism on domain-incremental and class-incremental variants of\nthe MNIST and CIFAR benchmarks under joint training, demonstrating that\nuncertainty-modulated gain dynamics effectively attenuate the stability gap.\nFinally, our analysis elucidates how gain modulation replicates noradrenergic\nfunctions in cortical circuits, offering mechanistic insights into reducing\nstability gaps and enhance performance in continual learning tasks.",

    "abstract": "Metaheuristic algorithms have gained widespread application across various\nfields owing to their ability to generate diverse solutions. One such algorithm\nis the Snake Optimizer (SO), a progressive optimization approach. However, SO\nsuffers from the issues of slow convergence speed and susceptibility to local\noptima. In light of these shortcomings, we propose a novel Multi-strategy\nImproved Snake Optimizer (MISO). Firstly, we propose a new adaptive random\ndisturbance strategy based on sine function to alleviate the risk of getting\ntrapped in a local optimum. Secondly, we introduce adaptive Levy flight\nstrategy based on scale factor and leader and endow the male snake leader with\nflight capability, which makes it easier for the algorithm to leap out of the\nlocal optimum and find the global optimum. More importantly, we put forward a\nposition update strategy combining elite leadership and Brownian motion,\neffectively accelerating the convergence speed while ensuring precision.\nFinally, to demonstrate the performance of MISO, we utilize 30 CEC2017 test\nfunctions and the CEC2022 test suite, comparing it with 11 popular algorithms\nacross different dimensions to validate its effectiveness. Moreover, Unmanned\nAerial Vehicle (UAV) has been widely used in various fields due to its\nadvantages of low cost, high mobility and easy operation. However, the UAV path\nplanning problem is crucial for flight safety and efficiency, and there are\nstill challenges in establishing and optimizing the path model. Therefore, we\napply MISO to the UAV 3D path planning problem as well as 6 engineering design\nproblems to assess its feasibility in practical applications. The experimental\nresults demonstrate that MISO exceeds other competitive algorithms in terms of\nsolution quality and stability, establishing its strong potential for\napplication.",

    "abstract": "Vision Mamba has emerged as a strong competitor to Vision Transformers (ViTs)\ndue to its ability to efficiently capture long-range dependencies with linear\ncomputational complexity. While token reduction, an effective compression\ntechnique in ViTs, has rarely been explored in Vision Mamba. Exploring Vision\nMamba's efficiency is essential for enabling broader applications. However, we\nfind that directly applying existing token reduction techniques for ViTs to\nVision Mamba leads to significant performance degradation. This is primarily\nbecause Mamba is a sequence model without attention mechanisms, whereas most\ntoken reduction techniques for ViTs rely on attention mechanisms for importance\nmeasurement and overlook the order of compressed tokens. In this paper, we\ninvestigate a Mamba structure-aware importance score to evaluate token\nimportance in a simple and effective manner. Building on this score, we further\npropose MTR, a training-free \\textbf{M}amba \\textbf{T}oken \\textbf{R}eduction\nframework. Without the need for training or additional tuning parameters, our\nmethod can be seamlessly integrated as a plug-and-play component across various\nMamba models.

A\nfew (observationally) exceptional events have been observed, as GRB221009A that\nstands out for its fluence and peak flux, being orders of magnitude higher than\nwhat measured so far. Analyzing the observed fluence, peak flux or duration\ndistributions typically requires one to assume some scenarios, and the\nconsistency of the observed data with the predictions turns out to be an\nimportant model diagnostic. However, it is also of interest to model these\ndistributions using general statistical properties that do not rely on specific\nmodel assumptions, allowing one to derive inferences only based on the\nconsistency of the observed distributions with the hypothesis of one single\npopulation of events that generate them. We obtained fluences, peak fluxes and\ndurations from the catalogues of GRBs observed by the CGRO-BATSE and Fermi-GBM\ninstruments. We selected the extreme values in slots of equal duration and\nmodelled their distributions by the generalized extreme value (GEV) formalism.\nThe GEV distribution is a limit distribution naturally arising when the number\nof observations is large and is essentially independent of the phenomena\nproducing the observed data. The distributions of extreme values for fluences,\npeak fluxes and durations are consistent with being extracted from a single\npopulation of events but the fluence and peak flux recorded for GRB221009A\nconstitutes a striking exception.

Several recent works have investigated this model, but have only\nsucceeded in obtaining non-trivial algorithms under restrictive assumptions,\nsuch as the two-agent bi-valued special case (Wang and Wei, 2025), or by\nassuming knowledge of the total disutility of each agent (Zhou, Bai, and Wu,\n2023).

Notably, this lower bound holds precisely for every $n$, without\nhiding constants in big-$O$ notation, thereby exactly matching the trivial\nupper bound.\n  Despite this strong impossibility result, we also present positive results.\nWe provide an online algorithm that applies in the general case, guaranteeing a\n$\\min\\{n, O(k), O(\\log D)\\}$-MMS allocation, where $k$ is the maximum number of\ndistinct disutilities across all agents and $D$ is the maximum ratio between\nthe largest and smallest disutilities for any agent.

    "abstract": "The early stiffening of fresh cement paste plays a key role in shaping and\nstability during casting and 3D printing. In Portland cement systems, this\nphenomenon arises from the formation of calcium-silicate-hydrate (C-S-H), which\nstiffens grain-to-grain contacts. However, the role of powder characteristics\nsuch as particle size and morphology remains poorly understood. Here, we vary\nthe fineness and grain shape by blending Portland cement with either coarse or\nfine limestone, leveraging the affinity of C-S-H to nucleate on limestone\nsurfaces. By coupling calorimetry and rheometry, we relate the amount of formed\nhydration products to the increase in stiffness, and show that the mechanism of\ncontact stiffening through C-S-H formation remains unchanged with limestone\naddition. Nevertheless, the rate of stiffening varies across blends. We find\nthat these rates correlate with a characteristic length scale that captures\nparticle size and shape. These results demonstrate that early stiffening\ndepends not only on the amount of hydration products formed, but also on the\ngeometry of the contacts where these products form, offering a framework for\nunderstanding more complex systems such as limestone-calcined clay cements.",

Central to EEA is the accurate\nstatistical characterization of atmospheric extremes, which are inherently\nmultivariate or spatial due to their measurement over high-dimensional grids.\nWithin the counterfactual causal inference framework of Pearl, we evaluate how\ntail assumptions affect attribution conclusions by comparing three multivariate\nmodeling approaches for estimating causation metrics. These include: (i) the\nmultivariate generalized Pareto distribution, which imposes an invariant tail\ndependence structure; (ii) the factor copula model of Castro-Camilo and Huser\n(2020), which offers flexible subasymptotic behavior; and (iii) the model of\nHuser and Wadsworth (2019), which smoothly transitions between different forms\nof extremal dependence. We assess the implications of these modeling choices in\nboth simulated scenarios (under varying forms of model misspecification) and\nreal data applications, using weekly winter maxima over Europe from the\nM\\'et\\'eo-France CNRM model and daily precipitation from the ACCESS-CM2 model\nover the U.S. Our findings highlight that tail assumptions critically shape\ncausality metrics in EEA.

    "abstract": "In recent years, non-Hermitian quantum systems (NHQS) have been actively\nstudied. In conventional quantum mechanics, Hermitisity is a fundamental\nproperty of Hamiltonians. However, it is known that when a system interacts\nwith its environment, its time evolution can be effectively described by\nnon-Hermitian Hamiltonians. NHQS are attracting attention because novel\nphysical phenomena not observed in Hermitian systems are predicted due to its\nnon-Hermitisity. In this study, I investigated the definition of current in\nNHQS. In Hermitian systems, equation of continuity(EOC) holds between the\nparticle density and the current. However, in NHQS, there are cases where the\nconventional definition of current does not satisfy EOC. Therefore, I\nconsidered the definition of current that satisfies EOC in NHQS. As a result, I\nderived current that satisfies EOC and behaves similarly to the current in\nHermitian systems with respect to physical quantities (electromagnetic fields).",

We show that evaluating the\nstatic CVaR of a given policy can be framed as two distinct minimization\nproblems. For their solutions to match, a set of ``risk-assignment consistency\nconstraints'' must be satisfied, and we demonstrate that the intersection of\nthe constraints being empty is the source of previously observed evaluation\nerrors. Quantifying the evaluation error as the CVaR evaluation gap, we then\ndemonstrate that the issues observed when optimizing over the dual-based CVaR\nDP are explained by the returned policy having a non-zero CVaR evaluation gap.\nWe then leverage our proposed risk-assignment perspective to prove that the\nsearch for a single, uniformly optimal policy via on the dual CVaR\ndecomposition is fundamentally limited, identifying an MDP where no single\npolicy can be optimal across all initial risk levels.",

It has been\nrecently proposed that such layers, arising during flux eruption events, can\npower the rapid TeV flares observed from the core of M87. In this scenario,\ninverse Compton scattering of soft radiation from the accretion flow by\nenergetic electron-positron pairs produced near the reconnection layer was\nsuggested as the primary emission mechanism. However, detailed calculations\nshow that radiation from pairs alone cannot account for the GeV emission\ndetected by the Fermi observatory. In this work, we combine analytic estimates\nwith 3D radiative particle-in-cell simulations of pair-proton plasmas to show\nthat the GeV emission can be naturally explained by synchrotron radiation from\nprotons accelerated in the current sheet. Although the exact proton content of\nthe layer is uncertain, our model remains robust across a broad range of\nproton-to-pair number density ratios. While protons are subdominant in number\ncompared to pairs, our simulations demonstrate that they can be accelerated\nmore efficiently, leading to a self-regulated steady state in which protons\ndominate the energy budget. Ultimately, proton synchrotron emission accounts\nfor approximately 5% to 20% of the total dissipation power. The majority is\nradiated as MeV photons via pair synchrotron emission, with a smaller fraction\nemitted as TeV photons through inverse Compton scattering.",

By integrating high-bandwidth\nHBM3E memory, an on-module photonic switch, and external DDR5 in a 2.5D\nelectro-optical system-in-package, the PFA offers up to 32 TB of shared memory\nalongside 115 Tbps of all-to-all digital switching. The Photonic FabricTM\nenables distributed AI training and inference to execute parallelism strategies\nmore efficiently. The Photonic Fabric removes the silicon beachfront constraint\nthat limits the fixed memory-to-compute ratio observed in virtually all current\nXPU accelerator designs. Replacing a local HBM stack on an XPU with a chiplet\nthat connects to the Photonic Fabric increases its memory capacity and\ncorrespondingly its memory bandwidth by offering a flexible path to scaling\nwell beyond the limitations of on-package HBM alone. We introduce CelestiSim, a\nlightweight analytical simulator validated on NVIDIA H100 and H200 systems.

Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) protocols, like\nBBM92, generate secret keys from entangled photons. While secure communication\nand error correction are essential for any quantum communication channel,\nresource contention, optimization, and fairness issues are critical for\nnetworks. In this article, we analyze the performance of quantum networks,\nproposing simple distributed algorithms for QKD networks generating secret\nkeys.\n  There are significant advantages of pumping entangled photons in QKD\nnetworks, but challenges arise in practical implementations. The underlying\nchannels are inherently time-varying, and thus data rates fluctuate between\nnodes. Moreover, multiple edges (node pairs) can be pumped simultaneously,\nalbeit at the cost of a reduced secret key rate (SKR). These temporal and\nspatial constraints yield a complex decision-making problem whose solutions may\nfavor a small set of user pairs to the detriment of overall, long-run network\nperformance.\n  We design adaptive pumping strategies that address these challenges in QKD\nnetworks. In particular, we find that a proportional fairness pumping strategy\n(PF-PS) stands out by dynamically prioritizing users with lower average secret\nkey rates and optimally balancing fairness with throughput. The proposed\nalgorithm is a natural extension to quantum networks of the Proportional Fair\nScheduler deployed in 4G LTE and 5G mobile networks. Both theoretical analysis\nand numerical simulations confirm that PF-PS is optimal for entangled state\ndistribution, and thus, when adapted appropriately, proportional fair pumping\nis a strong candidate for efficient resource allocation in quantum networks.",

Large-scale multi-site studies have exist, but they have\nacquisition-related biases due to scanner heterogeneity, compromising imaging\nconsistency and downstream analyses. While existing SC harmonization methods -\nsuch as linear regression (LR), ComBat, and deep learning techniques - mitigate\nthese biases, they often rely on detailed metadata, traveling subjects (TS), or\noverlook the graph-topology of SCs. To address these limitations, we propose a\nsite-conditioned deep harmonization framework that harmonizes SCs across\ndiverse acquisition sites without requiring metadata or TS that we test in a\nsimulated scenario based on the Human Connectome Dataset. Within this\nframework, we benchmark three deep architectures - a fully connected\nautoencoder (AE), a convolutional AE, and a graph convolutional AE - against a\ntop-performing LR baseline. While non-graph models excel in edge-weight\nprediction and edge existence detection, the graph AE demonstrates superior\npreservation of topological structure and subject-level individuality, as\nreflected by graph metrics and fingerprinting accuracy, respectively. Although\nthe LR baseline achieves the highest numerical performance by explicitly\nmodeling acquisition parameters, it lacks applicability to real-world\nmulti-site use cases as detailed acquisition metadata is often unavailable.

In this study, we quantitatively investigate this\nphenomenon within the framework of Ohmic dissipation arising from magnetic\ninduction in the atmosphere, one of the most promising mechanisms for\nexplaining the radius anomaly. We simulate the evolution of irradiated giant\nplanets with MESA, spanning the observed range of masses and equilibrium\ntemperatures, incorporating an internal source of Ohmic dissipation that\nextends to deep layers of the envelope. We infer average atmospheric wind\nintensities, averaged in the region $p < 10$ bar, in the range 0.01-1 km/s in\norder to reproduce the range of observed radii, decreasing roughly linearly\nwith planetary mass, and much more steeply with equilibrium temperature. This\nis consistent with the expected effects of magnetic drag from the induced\nfield, which is higher for more intense irradiation, via conductivity, and for\nlarger masses, which have higher dynamo fields. Due to the evolution of the\ndynamo field and the proportionality of the induced currents on it, the Ohmic\nefficiency typically decreases by at least one order of magnitude from 0.1 to\n10 Gyr, at contrast with the common assumption of a constant-in-time value.\nNotably, the extent of the main convective region, and the associated heat flux\nsupporting the dynamo, is reduced in the presence of strong Ohmic dissipation,\nwhich in turn depends on the dynamo field strength, generating a non-trivial\ncoupling of the latter with the atmospheric induction, potentially leading to\nan oscillatory behaviour of the field strength. These findings remain generally\nvalid even when accounting for a long-term increase in the main-sequence host\nstar luminosity, although this case can more readily lead to HJ re-inflation,\nconsistent with previous studies.",

However, existing methods struggle\nwith automation, 3D consistency, and fine-grained control. We present\nDreamScene, an end-to-end framework for high-quality and editable 3D scene\ngeneration from text or dialogue. DreamScene begins with a scene planning\nmodule, where a GPT-4 agent infers object semantics and spatial constraints to\nconstruct a hybrid graph. A graph-based placement algorithm then produces a\nstructured, collision-free layout. Based on this layout, Formation Pattern\nSampling (FPS) generates object geometry using multi-timestep sampling and\nreconstructive optimization, enabling fast and realistic synthesis. To ensure\nglobal consistent, DreamScene employs a progressive camera sampling strategy\ntailored to both indoor and outdoor settings. Finally, the system supports\nfine-grained scene editing, including object movement, appearance changes, and\n4D dynamic motion. Experiments demonstrate that DreamScene surpasses prior\nmethods in quality, consistency, and flexibility, offering a practical solution\nfor open-domain 3D content creation.

Our\nresults reveal that fluid exchange between droplets occurs via a pumping flow\ndriven by differences in hydrostatic and Laplace pressure between the two\ndroplets. Evaporation causes the droplets to slowly lose volume and change\nshape, which subsequently affects the fluid transport between them. We observe\nthat, for equal contact areas, a larger droplet typically feeds a smaller\ndroplet during evaporation and the flow in the connecting channel is\nunidirectional. However, for unequal contact areas, the flow can reverse in the\nconnecting channel following a sudden switch in dropletshape that occurs during\nevaporation. A stability,analysis reveals that the dynamics of the exchange\nflow are underpinned by a supercritical pitchfork bifurcation. Evaporative\nvolume loss permits the droplet pair to step through a sequence of\nquasi-stationary states determined by the instantaneous volume of the system.\nEnforcing unequal contact area unfolds the bifurcation such that droplet-shape\nswitching and the associated flow reversal can be understood in terms of a jump\nfrom the disconnected to the connected branch of the bifurcation.

To perform this task, we consider the\ndynamics of the chameleon scalar field in the region of galactic halos in\nstatic spherically symmetric spacetimes that differ only slightly from\nclassical general relativity, but have similar symmetry behind this region.\nHence, we demonstrate its ability to act as dark matter. In fact, by obtaining\nthe expression for the tangential speed in this region, we apply this approach\nto explain the issue of flat galactic rotation curves. We obtain that the mass\nassociated with the chameleon scalar field varies linearly with the radius of\ngalaxy, and hence, the tangential speed in that region is constant, which is\nconsistent with observational data without any need to introduce a mysterious\ndark matter. Accordingly, we show that the presented chameleon gravity has a\nwell-defined Newtonian limit and can describe the geometry of spacetime in the\nregion of flat galactic rotation curves, and is consistent with the\ncorresponding results of the $ \\Lambda CDM $ model with the NFW profile. We\nalso consider a test particle moving in a timelike geodesic and obtain the\nfifth-force, which varies proportionally to the inverse of the radius of\ngalaxy.

However, differences\nbetween structures will mean the training and testing distributions will\ndiffer; thus, conventional machine learning methods cannot be expected to\ngeneralise between structures. To address this issue, transfer learning (TL),\ncan be used to leverage information across related domains. An important\nconsideration is that the lack of labels in the target domain limits data-based\nmetrics to quantifying the discrepancy between the marginal distributions.\nThus, a prerequisite for the application of typical unsupervised TL methods is\nto identify suitable source structures (domains), and a set of features, for\nwhich the conditional distributions are related to the target structure.\nGenerally, the selection of domains and features is reliant on domain\nexpertise; however, for complex mechanisms, such as the influence of damage on\nthe dynamic response of a structure, this task is not trivial. In this paper,\nknowledge of physics is leveraged to select more similar features, the modal\nassurance criterion (MAC) is used to quantify the correspondence between the\nmodes of healthy structures. The MAC is shown to have high correspondence with\na supervised metric that measures joint-distribution similarity, which is the\nprimary indicator of whether a classifier will generalise between domains. The\nMAC is proposed as a measure for selecting a set of features that behave\nconsistently across domains when subjected to damage, i.e. features with\ninvariance in the conditional distributions.

In\nthis work, we extend the AQS method to finite temperatures, based on a\nformulation that describes atoms as temperature-dependent Gaussian packets\n(GPPs) in phase space under quasistatic conditions, thus equivalent to minimum\nfree energy conditions. This framework is used to study the effect of\ntemperature on the onset of inelasticity and fracture in amorphous\ntwo-dimensional silica glass approaching quasistatic conditions under uniaxial\ntensile loading. An important characteristic of this formulation is the\ndirectional dependence of the variance of each Gaussian packet in configuration\nspace, making this formulation an inexpensive and accurate predictor of zones\nprone to atomic-scale rearrangements, both in the undeformed state and (with\nincreasing accuracy) as the deformation progresses. This method is also shown\nto accurately capture the thermal expansion of the disordered material.\nFurthermore, combining the GPP description with Metropolis sampling predicts\nthe effect of temperature on the onset of fracture of the material, which is\nvalidated through MD simulations at strain rates as low as $10^{4}$s$^{-1}$.\nThe presented framework therefore provides a valuable technique for studying\nthe nonlinear mechanics of disordered materials at finite temperature and for\npredicting local rearrangement zones in disordered solids efficiently without\nthe need for expensive MD simulations.",

The LSTM component will capture users\nevolving preference through their viewing history, while the fine-tuned LLM\nvariants will leverage these temporal user insights to generate next movies\nthat users might enjoy. Experimental results on MovieLens-1M dataset shows that\nthe DUALRec model outperforms a wide range of baseline models, with\ncomprehensive evaluation matrices of Hit Rate (HR@k), Normalized Discounted\nCumulative Gain (NDCG@k), and genre similarity metrics. This research proposes\na novel architecture that bridges the gap between temporal sequence modeling\nand semantic reasoning, and offers a promising direction for developing more\nintelligent and context-aware recommenders.",

    "abstract": "Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) serves as a prodromal stage of Alzheimer's\nDisease (AD), where early identification and intervention can effectively slow\nthe progression to dementia. However, diagnosing AD remains a significant\nchallenge in neurology due to the confounders caused mainly by the selection\nbias of multimodal data and the complex relationships between variables. To\naddress these issues, we propose a novel visual-language causal intervention\nframework named Alzheimer's Disease Prediction with Cross-modal Causal\nIntervention (ADPC) for diagnostic assistance. Our ADPC employs large language\nmodel (LLM) to summarize clinical data under strict templates, maintaining\nstructured text outputs even with incomplete or unevenly distributed datasets.\nThe ADPC model utilizes Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), functional MRI (fMRI)\nimages and textual data generated by LLM to classify participants into\nCognitively Normal (CN), MCI, and AD categories. Because of the presence of\nconfounders, such as neuroimaging artifacts and age-related biomarkers,\nnon-causal models are likely to capture spurious input-output correlations,\ngenerating less reliable results. Our framework implicitly eliminates\nconfounders through causal intervention. Experimental results demonstrate the\noutstanding performance of our method in distinguishing CN/MCI/AD cases,\nachieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) metrics across most evaluation metrics.

Remarkably, the all-plus current already encodes\nmuch of the Parke-Taylor formula structure. The all-but-one-plus current\nsatisfies a more intricate recursion relation than the all-plus case, but one\nthat can still be solved explicitly. This current turns out to be proportional\nto the all-plus current, which explains why the essential features of the MHV\nformula are already present at the all-plus level.\n  In this paper, we carry out an analogous program for gravity. The all-plus\ngraviton Berends-Giele current satisfies a recursion relation that is more\ninvolved than in the Yang-Mills case, but whose explicit solution is known: a\nsum over spanning trees of the complete graph on n vertices. We derive and\nsolve the recursion relation for the all-but-one-plus graviton current. The\nsolution is again given by a sum over spanning trees, where each tree\ncontributes a term proportional to the corresponding all-plus current,\nmultiplied by a factor given by a sum over subtrees. Only a small subset of\nthese terms contributes to the MHV amplitude, which we recover explicitly. This\nprovides a direct derivation of the gravity MHV formula from the gravitational\nFeynman rules - achieving what Berends, Giele, and Kuijf in their 1987 paper\nregarded as \"hard to obtain directly from quantum gravity\".",

    "abstract": "A fundamental question in cognitive neuroscience is what shapes visual\nperception: the external world's structure or the brain's internal\narchitecture. Although some perceptual variability can be traced to individual\ndifferences, brain responses to naturalistic stimuli evoke similar activity\npatterns across individuals, suggesting a convergent representational\nprinciple. Here, we test if this stimulus-driven convergence follows a common\ntrajectory across people and deep neural networks (DNNs) during its\ntransformation from sensory to high-level internal representations. We\nintroduce a unified framework that traces representational flow by combining\ninter-subject similarity with alignment to model hierarchies. Applying this\nframework to three independent fMRI datasets of visual scene perception, we\nreveal a cortex-wide network, conserved across individuals, organized into two\npathways: a medial-ventral stream for scene structure and a lateral-dorsal\nstream tuned for social and biological content. This functional organization is\ncaptured by the hierarchies of vision DNNs but not language models, reinforcing\nthe specificity of the visual-to-semantic transformation. These findings show a\nconvergent computational solution for visual encoding in both human and\nartificial vision, driven by the structure of the external world.",

Decentralized algorithms typically rely on predicting the behavior of\nother agents, sharing contracts, or maintaining communication for safety, while\ncentralized approaches struggle with scalability and real-time decision-making.\nTo address these challenges, we introduce Neural Hamilton-Jacobi Reachability\nLearning (HJR) for Decentralized Multi-Agent Motion Planning. Our method\nprovides scalable neural HJR modeling to tackle high-dimensional configuration\nspaces and capture worst-case collision and safety constraints between agents.\nWe further propose a decentralized trajectory optimization framework that\nincorporates the learned HJR solutions to solve MAMP tasks in real-time. We\ndemonstrate that our method is both scalable and data-efficient, enabling the\nsolution of MAMP problems in higher-dimensional scenarios with complex\ncollision constraints. Our approach generalizes across various dynamical\nsystems, including a 12-dimensional dual-arm setup, and outperforms a range of\nstate-of-the-art techniques in successfully addressing challenging MAMP tasks.\nVideo demonstrations are available at https://youtu.be/IZiePX0p1Mc.",

Conflation is an\nimportant process for transferring these metrics onto a single basemap.\nHowever, conflation is often an expensive and time-consuming process based on\nproprietary algorithms that require manual verification.\n  In this paper, an automated open-source process is used to conflate two\nbasemaps: the linear reference system (LRS) basemap produced by the Virginia\nDepartment of Transportation and the OpenStreetMap (OSM) basemap for Virginia.\nThis process loads one LRS route at a time, determines the correct direction of\ntravel, interpolates to fill gaps larger than 12 meters, and then uses\nValhalla's map-matching algorithm to find the corresponding points along OSM's\nsegments. Valhalla's map-matching process uses a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and\nViterbi search-based approach to find the most likely OSM segments matching the\nLRS route.\n  This work has three key contributions. First, it conflates the Virginia\nroadway network LRS map with OSM using an automated conflation method based on\nHMM and Viterbi search. Second, it demonstrates a novel open-source processing\npipeline that could be replicated without the need for proprietary licenses.\nFinally, the overall conflation process yields over 98% successful matches,\nwhich is an improvement over most automated processes currently available for\nthis type of conflation.",

    "abstract": "Recently, commercial ultra-wideband (UWB) transceivers have enabled not only\nmeasuring device-to-device distance but also tracking the position of a\npedestrian who does not carry a UWB device. UWB-based device-free localization\nthat does not require dedicated radar equipment is compatible with existing\nanchor infrastructure and can be reused to reduce hardware deployment costs.\nHowever, it is difficult to estimate the target's position accurately in\nreal-world scenarios due to the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the\ncluttered environment. In this paper, we propose a deep learning (DL)-assisted\nparticle filter to overcome these challenges. First, the channel impulse\nresponse (CIR) variance is analyzed to capture the variability induced by the\ntarget's movement. Then, a DL-based one-dimensional attention U-Net is used to\nextract only the reflection components caused by the target and suppress the\nnoise components within the CIR variance profile. Finally, multiple\npreprocessed CIR variance profiles are used as input to a particle filter to\nestimate the target's position. Experimental results demonstrate that the\nproposed system is a practical and cost-effective solution for IoT and\nautomotive applications with a root mean square error (RMSE) of about 15 cm and\nan average processing time of 4 ms.

DiViD's sequence encoder extracts a global static\ntoken from the first frame and per-frame dynamic tokens, explicitly removing\nstatic content from the motion code. Its conditional DDPM decoder incorporates\nthree key inductive biases: a shared-noise schedule for temporal consistency, a\ntime-varying KL-based bottleneck that tightens at early timesteps (compressing\nstatic information) and relaxes later (enriching dynamics), and cross-attention\nthat routes the global static token to all frames while keeping dynamic tokens\nframe-specific. An orthogonality regularizer further prevents residual\nstatic-dynamic leakage. We evaluate DiViD on real-world benchmarks using\nswap-based accuracy and cross-leakage metrics. DiViD outperforms\nstate-of-the-art sequential disentanglement methods: it achieves the highest\nswap-based joint accuracy, preserves static fidelity while improving dynamic\ntransfer, and reduces average cross-leakage.",

This behavior enables it to model a\nvariety of non-standard late-time cosmologies, offering alternatives to various\ndark energy (DE) models, especially when the DE sector violates the null energy\ncondition. In this work, by fitting to CMB, BAO, and Supernovae (SNe) data and\ncomparing models in a Bayesian approach, we show that simple models of exotic\ndark matter are statistically comparable to the $w_0w_a$CDM DE model in\nexplaining the recent anomaly in the late-time cosmological evolution suggested\nby DESI and supernova observations, although in both classes of models the\nevidence against the $\\Lambda$CDM model only appears when the DES-Y5 or Union3\nSNe dataset is included. The value of $H_0$ remains similar to that in the DE\nmodel, except in the no-SNe case, where the DE model predicts lower values than\n$\\Lambda$CDM, thereby worsening the Hubble tension, whereas the EDM models\nyield values closer to that of $\\Lambda$CDM, albeit with larger uncertainty. In\naddition, the EDM models predict a drastically different energy budget for the\npresent-day universe compared to the standard model, and provide an explanation\nfor a coincident problem in the DE-model explanation of the DESI anomaly.",

XUE 10 belongs to the\nmassive star cluster NGC 6357 (1.69 kpc), where it is exposed to an external\nfar-ultraviolet (FUV) radiation $\\approx$ 10$^3$ times stronger than in the\nSolar neighborhood. We modeled the molecular features in the mid-infrared\nspectrum with Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) 0D slab models. We derived\nbasic parameters of the stellar host from a VLT FORS2 optical spectrum using\nPHOENIX stellar templates. We detect bright CO2 gas with the first simultaneous\ndetection (> 5$\\sigma$) of four isotopologues (12CO2, 13CO2, 16O12C18O,\n16O12C17O) in a protoplanetary disk. We also detect faint CO emission\n(2$\\sigma$) and the HI Pf$\\alpha$ line (8$\\sigma$). We also place strict upper\nlimits on the water content, finding a total column density $\\lesssim$\n10$^{18}$ cm$^{-2}$. The CO2 species trace low gas temperatures (300-370 K)\nwith a range of column densities of 7.4 $\\times$ 10$^{17}$ cm$^{-2}$\n(16O12C17O)-1.3 $\\times$ 10$^{20}$ cm$^{-2}$ (12CO2) in an equivalent emitting\nradius of 1.15 au. The emission of 13CO2 is likely affected by line optical\ndepth effects. 16O12C18O and 16O12C17O abundances may be isotopically anomalous\ncompared to the 16O/18O and 16O/17O ratios measured in the interstellar medium\nand the Solar System. We propose that the mid-infrared spectrum of XUE 10 is\nexplained by H2O removal either via advection or strong photo-dissociation by\nstellar UV irradiation, and enhanced local CO2 gas-phase production. Outer disk\ntruncation supports the observed CO2-H2O dichotomy. A CO2 vapor enrichment in\n18O and 17O can be explained by means of external UV irradiation and early on\n(10$^{4-5}$ yr) delivery of isotopically anomalous water ice to the inner disk.",

Yet, most attempts at neural models of causality\nassume static causal graphs and ignore the dynamic nature of causal\ninteractions. In this work, we introduce Causal Process framework as a novel\ntheory for representing dynamic hypotheses about causal structure. Furthermore,\nwe present Causal Process Model as an implementation of this framework. This\nallows us to reformulate the attention mechanism popularized by Transformer\nnetworks within an RL setting with the goal to infer interpretable causal\nprocesses from visual observations. Here, causal inference corresponds to\nconstructing a causal graph hypothesis which itself becomes an RL task nested\nwithin the original RL problem. To create an instance of such hypothesis, we\nemploy RL agents. These agents establish links between units similar to the\noriginal Transformer attention mechanism. We demonstrate the effectiveness of\nour approach in an RL environment where we outperform current alternatives in\ncausal representation learning and agent performance, and uniquely recover\ngraphs of dynamic causal processes.",

Integrated\nseamlessly into the Unity engine, Neural-GASh facilitates accurate shading of\nanimated and deformed 3D meshes - capabilities essential for dynamic,\ninteractive environments. The shading of the scene is implemented within Unity,\nwhere rotation of scene lights in terms of Spherical Harmonics is also\nperformed optimally using CGA. This neural field approach is designed to\ndeliver fast and efficient light transport simulation across diverse platforms,\nincluding mobile and VR, while preserving high rendering quality. Additionally,\nwe evaluate our method on scenes generated via 3D Gaussian splats, further\ndemonstrating the flexibility and robustness of Neural-GASh in diverse\nscenarios.

    "abstract": "Branching fraction ratios between the decays $B^{0}_{(s)} \\rightarrow J/\\psi\n\\eta^{(\\prime)}$ are measured using proton-proton collision data collected by\nthe LHCb experiment at centre-of-mass energies of $7$, $8$ and\n$13~\\textrm{TeV}$, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of $9~\n\\textrm{fb}^{-1}$. The measured ratios of these branching fractions are\n$\\frac{BF(B^{0} \\rightarrow J/\\psi \\eta^{\\prime})}{BF(B^{0} \\rightarrow J/\\psi\n\\eta)} = 0.48 \\pm 0.06 \\pm 0.02 \\pm 0.01$ and $\\frac{BF(B^{0}_{s} \\rightarrow\nJ/\\psi \\eta^{\\prime})}{BF(B^{0}_{s} \\rightarrow J/\\psi \\eta)} = 0.80 \\pm 0.02\n\\pm 0.02 \\pm 0.01$, where the uncertainties are statistical, systematic and\nrelated to the precision of the $\\eta^{(\\prime)}$ branching fractions,\nrespectively. They are used to constrain the $\\eta/\\eta^{\\prime}$ mixing angle,\n$\\phi_{P}$, and to probe the presence of a possible glueball component in the\n$\\eta^{\\prime}$ meson, described by the gluonic mixing angle $\\phi_{G}$. The\nobtained results are $\\phi_{P} = (41.6^{+1.0}_{-1.2})^\\circ$ and $\\phi_{G} =\n(28.1^{+3.9}_{-4.0})^\\circ$, where the uncertainties are statistically\ndominated. While the value of $\\phi_{P}$ is compatible with existing\nexperimental determinations and theoretical calculations, the angle $\\phi_{G}$\ndiffers from zero by more than four standard deviations, which points to a\nsubstantial glueball component in the $\\eta^{\\prime}$ meson and/or unexpectedly\nlarge contributions from gluon-mediated processes in these decays. The absolute\nbranching fractions are also measured relative to that of the well-established\n$B^{0}_{s} \\rightarrow J/\\psi\\phi$ decay, which serves as the normalisation\nchannel. These results supersede the previous LHCb measurements and are the\nmost precise to date.",

We\ncompose a comprehensive overview of existing datasets and models for these\ntasks, finding that current approaches create siloed solutions that perform\npoorly on out-of-distribution texts. To address this limitation, we compile a\ndiverse dataset by combining 12 datasets for political leaning classification\nand creating a new dataset for politicalness by extending 18 existing datasets\nwith the appropriate label. Through extensive benchmarking with leave-one-in\nand leave-one-out methodologies, we evaluate the performance of existing models\nand train new ones with enhanced generalization capabilities.",

    "abstract": "Predicting phenotypes from gene expression data is a crucial task in\nbiomedical research, enabling insights into disease mechanisms, drug responses,\nand personalized medicine. Traditional machine learning and deep learning rely\non supervised learning, which requires large quantities of labeled data that\nare costly and time-consuming to obtain in the case of gene expression data.\nSelf-supervised learning has recently emerged as a promising approach to\novercome these limitations by extracting information directly from the\nstructure of unlabeled data. In this study, we investigate the application of\nstate-of-the-art self-supervised learning methods to bulk gene expression data\nfor phenotype prediction. We selected three self-supervised methods, based on\ndifferent approaches, to assess their ability to exploit the inherent structure\nof the data and to generate qualitative representations which can be used for\ndownstream predictive tasks. By using several publicly available gene\nexpression datasets, we demonstrate how the selected methods can effectively\ncapture complex information and improve phenotype prediction accuracy. The\nresults obtained show that self-supervised learning methods can outperform\ntraditional supervised models besides offering significant advantage by\nreducing the dependency on annotated data. We provide a comprehensive analysis\nof the performance of each method by highlighting their strengths and\nlimitations. We also provide recommendations for using these methods depending\non the case under study. Finally, we outline future research directions to\nenhance the application of self-supervised learning in the field of gene\nexpression data analysis. This study is the first work that deals with bulk\nRNA-Seq data and self-supervised learning.",

We then develop a general\nframework for closed Drinfel'd twisted spin chains and construct an explicit\nmap to undeformed models with twisted-boundary conditions. Applied to the non\ncompact $\\mathrm{XXX}_{-1/2}$ spin chain, the Jordanian twist breaks the Cartan\ngenerator labelling magnon excitations, obstructing the standard Bethe methods.\nInstead, using the twisted-boundary formulation, we initiate the spectral\nproblem based on a residual root generator both in the thermodynamic limit and\nfor short chains. We find that the ground state is non-trivially deformed, and\nis in agreement with the classical string result, while our analysis does not\ncapture higher-spin excited states. We also study the asymptotics of the\nassociated $Q$-system, which is well-behaved and compatible with the\nboundary-twist. While a full understanding of the spectrum remains open, our\nwork provides concrete steps toward a spectral description of non-abelian\ntwisted integrable models.",

Personalization in this\ncontext meets individual researchers' needs by leveraging, through user\nprofiles, the user related information (e.g. documents authored by a\nresearcher), to improve search effectiveness and to reduce the information\noverload. While citation graphs are a valuable means to support the outcome of\nrecommender systems, their use in personalized academic search (with, e.g.\nnodes as papers and edges as citations) is still under-explored.\n  Existing personalized models for academic search often struggle to fully\ncapture users' academic interests. To address this, we propose a two-step\napproach: first, training a neural language model for retrieval, then\nconverting the academic graph into a knowledge graph and embedding it into a\nshared semantic space with the language model using translational embedding\ntechniques. This allows user models to capture both explicit relationships and\nhidden structures in citation graphs and paper content. We evaluate our\napproach in four academic search domains, outperforming traditional graph-based\nand personalized models in three out of four, with up to a 10\\% improvement in\nMAP@100 over the second-best model.

Diamond, featuring\nits high bandgap and UV absorption, exceptional mechanical/chemical robustness,\nand excellent thermal stability, emerges as a highly promising material for\nnext-generation UV detection in various scenarios. However, conventional\ndiamond-based UV detectors are constrained by rigid bulk architectures and\nreliance on external power supplies, hindering their integration with curved\nand flexible platforms and complicating device scalability due to auxiliary\npower requirements. To tackle these challenges, herein, we firstly demonstrated\na large-scale, self-powered, and flexible diamond UV detector by\nheterogeneously integrating a MoS$_2$ monolayer with an ultrathin, freestanding\ndiamond membrane. The fabricated device operates at zero external bias, and\nsimultaneously exhibits a high responsivity of 94 mA W$^{-1}$ at 220 nm, and\ndetectivity of 5.88 x 109 Jones. Notably, mechanical bending enables\nstrain-induced bandgap modulation of the diamond membrane, allowing dynamically\ntunable photoresponse-a capability absent in rigid diamond counterparts.

However, most of their masses ($>10^6\\,\\mathrm{M_\\odot}$) and\nsizes (>30 pc) are about 10 times those of GCs in the local Universe. To assess\nwhether these clumps can evolve into GCs, we performed N-body simulations of\ntheir dynamical evolution from z=1.4 to z=0 (9.23 Gyr), under the effect of\ndynamical friction and tidal stripping. Dynamical friction is studied\nperforming multiple runs of a clump system in a Sparkler-like spherical halo of\nmass $M_{200}\\simeq 5\\times 10^{11}\\,\\mathrm{M_\\odot}$ (from the\nstellar-to-halo mass relation). For the tidal stripping, we simulated resolved\nclumps, orbiting in an external, static gravitational potential including the\nsame halo as in the dynamical friction simulations and also a Sparkler-like\nstellar disk. Dynamical friction causes the clumps with mass\n$>10^7\\,\\mathrm{M_\\odot}$ to sink into the galaxy central regions, possibly\ncontributing to the bulge growth. In absence of tidal stripping, the mass\ndistribution of the surviving clumps (40%) peaks at $5\\times\n10^6\\,\\mathrm{M_\\odot}$, implying the presence of uncommonly over-massive\nclumps at z=0. Tidal shocks by the stellar disk strip considerable mass from\nlow-mass clumps, even though their sizes remain larger than those of\npresent-day GCs. When the surviving clumps are corrected for tidal stripping,\ntheir mass distribution peak shifts to $2\\times 10^6\\,\\mathrm{M_\\odot}$,\ncompatible with massive GCs. Our simulations suggest that a fraction of the\nSparkler clumps is expected to fall into the central regions, where they might\nbecome bulge fossil fragments or contribute to form a nuclear star cluster. The\nremaining clumps are too large in size to be progenitors of GCs.",

The\nnetwork is designed to map from the local wall geometry to the Riesz\nrepresentors for the corresponding local flow averages. With such a\nparameterisation, the network only depends on the local wall geometry and as\nsuch can be trained independent of boundary conditions. We perform a detailed\ntheoretical analysis of the statistical error propagation, and prove that under\nsuitable regularity and scaling assumptions, a bounded training loss leads to a\nbounded error in the resulting macroscopic flow. We then demonstrate on a\nfamily of test problems that the learned precomputation performs stably with\nrespect to the scale of the roughness.

In particular, DepthAnything offers dense and reliable\ngeometric priors from monocular RGB images, which can complement sparse LiDAR\ndata in autonomous driving scenarios. However, such priors remain underutilized\nin LiDAR-based 3D object detection. In this paper, we address the limited\nexpressiveness of raw LiDAR point features, especially the weak discriminative\ncapability of the reflectance attribute, by introducing depth priors predicted\nby DepthAnything. These priors are fused with the original LiDAR attributes to\nenrich each point's representation. To leverage the enhanced point features, we\npropose a point-wise feature extraction module. Then, a Dual-Path RoI feature\nextraction framework is employed, comprising a voxel-based branch for global\nsemantic context and a point-based branch for fine-grained structural details.\nTo effectively integrate the complementary RoI features, we introduce a\nbidirectional gated RoI feature fusion module that balances global and local\ncues. Extensive experiments on the KITTI benchmark show that our method\nconsistently improves detection accuracy, demonstrating the value of\nincorporating visual foundation model priors into LiDAR-based 3D object\ndetection.",

While most theoretical efforts\nto date have focused on single-mode cavities, practical implementations in\npolaritonic chemistry typically involve planar optical cavities that support a\nseries of equally spaced photon modes, determined by the cavity geometry. In\nthis work, we present a numerically exact, fully quantum-mechanical study of\nchemical reactions in few-mode cavities, revealing two key scenarios by which\nmulti-mode effects can enhance cavity-modified reactivity. The first scenario\nemerges when the free spectral range is comparable to the single-mode Rabi\nsplitting. In such cases, hybridization between a rate-decisive molecular\nvibration and a central resonant cavity mode reshapes the resonance landscape,\nenabling additional reaction pathways mediated by adjacent cavity modes. The\nsecond scenario exploits the intrinsic anharmonicity of molecular vibrations,\nwhich gives rise to multiple dipole-allowed transitions with distinct energies.\nUnder multi-mode strong coupling, where different cavity modes individually\nresonate with these distinct transitions, multi-photon processes involving\nsequential absorption across multiple modes become accessible. This leads to a\nnontrivial and non-additive rate enhancement via cascade-like vibrational\nladder climbing. Together, these findings offer new strategies for tailoring\nchemical reactivity by harnessing the structural richness of multi-mode\nstructure, offering valuable insights for optimal experimental designs in\npolaritonic catalysis.",

In\nparticular, we identify previously undetected variability components, one of\nwhich manifests as a narrow dip in the coherence function and a broad drop in\nthe phase-lag spectrum at the same frequency. This dip in coherence, which we\ndetected for the first time in Cygnus X-1 at energies above 3 keV, appears in a\nstate in which the source shows high-amplitude radio variability and\nsignificant hard X-ray polarization.

    "abstract": "Stablecoins, with a capitalization exceeding 200 billion USD as of January\n2025, have shown significant growth, with annual transaction volumes exceeding\n10 trillion dollars in 2023 and nearly doubling that figure in 2024. This\nexceptional success has attracted the attention of traditional financial\ninstitutions, with an increasing number of governments exploring the potential\nof Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs). Although academia has recognized\nthe importance of stablecoins, research in this area remains fragmented,\nincomplete, and sometimes contradictory. In this paper, we aim to address the\ncited gap with a structured literature analysis, correlating recent\ncontributions to present a picture of the complex economic, technical, and\nregulatory aspects of stablecoins. To achieve this, we formulate the main\nresearch questions and categorize scientific contributions accordingly,\nidentifying main results, data sources, methodologies, and open research\nquestions. The research questions we address in this survey paper cover several\ntopics, such as the stability of various stablecoins, novel designs and\nimplementations, and relevant regulatory challenges. The studies employ a wide\nrange of methodologies and data sources, which we critically analyze and\nsynthesize. Our analysis also reveals significant research gaps, including\nlimited studies on security and privacy, underexplored stablecoins, unexamined\nfailure cases, unstudied governance mechanisms, and the treatment of\nstablecoins under financial accounting standards, among other areas.",

    "abstract": "The modelling of bubble-particle collisions is crucial to improving the\nefficiency of industrial processes such as froth flotation. Although such\nsystems usually have turbulent flows and the bubbles are typically much larger\nthan the particles, there currently exist no predictive models for this case\nwhich consistently include finite-size effects in the interaction with the\nbubbles as well as inertial effects for the particles simultaneously. As a\nfirst step, Jiang and Krug (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 1006, 2025, A19) proposed a\nfrozen turbulence approach which captures the collision rate between\nfinite-size bubbles and inertial particles in homogeneous isotropic turbulence\nusing the bubble slip velocity probability density function measured from\nsimulations as an input. In this study, we further develop this approach into a\nmodel where the bubble-particle collision rate can be predicted a priori based\non the bubble, particle, and turbulence properties. By comparing the predicted\ncollision rate with simulations of bubbles with Stokes numbers of 2.8 and 6.3,\nand particles with Stokes numbers ranging from 0.01 to 2 in turbulence with a\nTaylor Reynolds number of 64, good agreement is found between model and\nsimulations for Froude number $Fr \\leq 0.25$. Beyond this range of bubble\nStokes number, we propose a criterion for using our model and discuss the\nmodel's validity. Evaluating our model at typical flotation parameters\nindicates that particle inertia effects are usually important. Generally,\nsmaller bubbles, larger particles, and stronger turbulence increase the overall\ncollision rate.",

Additionally, for the $e\\mu$ flavor combination,\nwe investigate the muon four-body radiative decay ($\\mu\\to e +{\\tt\nDM+DM}+\\gamma$) to complement our probe of such interactions.

For a random $d$-regular graph with $N$ vertices, where the\ndegree $d$ grows slowly with $N$, we prove that these projections follow\napproximately normal distributions. Our main result establishes a Berry-Esseen\nbound showing convergence to the Gaussian with error $O(\\sqrt{d} \\cdot\nN^{-1/6+\\varepsilon})$ for degrees $d \\leq N^{1/4}$. This bound significantly\nimproves upon previous results that had error terms scaling as $d^3$, and we\nprove our $\\sqrt{d}$ scaling is optimal by establishing a matching lower bound.\nOur proof combines three techniques: (1) refined concentration inequalities\nthat exploit the specific variance structure of regular graphs, (2) a\nvector-based analysis of the resolvent that avoids iterative procedures, and\n(3) a framework combining Stein's method with graph-theoretic tools to control\nhigher-order fluctuations.

We compare this to a two-bath scenario in which collisional qubits\nare prepared in either their ground or excited states and the environment\ntemperature is encoded in system-environment couplings.

In particular, in Question Answering (QA) systems,\ngenerating a SPARQL query for a given natural-language question (often named\nQuery Building) from the information retrieved from the same question is the\ncentral task of QA systems working over Knowledge Graphs (KGQA). Due to the\nrise of Large Language Models (LLMs), they are considered a well-suited method\nto increase the quality of the question-answering functionality, as there is\nstill a lot of room for improvement, aiming for enhanced quality and\ntrustworthiness. However, LLMs are trained on web data, where researchers have\nno control over whether the benchmark or the knowledge graph was already\nincluded in the training data. In this paper, we introduce a novel method that\nevaluates the quality of LLMs by generating a SPARQL query from a\nnatural-language question under various conditions: (1) zero-shot SPARQL\ngeneration, (2) with knowledge injection, and (3) with \"anonymized\" knowledge\ninjection. This enables us, for the first time, to estimate the influence of\nthe training data on the QA quality improved by LLMs. Ultimately, this will\nhelp to identify how portable a method is or whether good results might mostly\nbe achieved because a benchmark was already included in the training data (cf.\nLLM memorization). The developed method is portable, robust, and supports any\nknowledge graph; therefore, it could be easily applied to any KGQA or LLM,\ns.t., generating consistent insights into the actual LLM capabilities is\npossible.",

Leveraging a self-supervised depth network to obtain a\npoint cloud representation of the scene, our bird's-eye view pathway extracts\nexplicit spatial information, while our front view pathway simultaneously\nextracts rich semantic information. Depth3DLane then uses 3D lane anchors to\nsample features from both pathways and infer accurate 3D lane geometry.\nFurthermore, we extend the framework to predict camera parameters on a\nper-frame basis and introduce a theoretically motivated fitting procedure to\nenhance stability on a per-segment basis. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat Depth3DLane achieves competitive performance on the OpenLane benchmark\ndataset. Furthermore, experimental results show that using learned parameters\ninstead of ground-truth parameters allows Depth3DLane to be applied in\nscenarios where camera calibration is infeasible, unlike previous methods.",

Understanding both its hierarchical structure and the\ninterplay between its constituents could shed light on the mechanical\ncompetence of the tissue. Therefore, rheologic approaches based on\nhigh-resolution non-destructive imaging techniques are desired. In this\ncontext, X-ray imaging could ideally accomplish this task. Nevertheless, the\nnature of articular cartilage translates into poor contrast using conventional\nabsorption modality. To overcome this limitation, several approaches can be\nembraced. X-ray visibility of articular cartilage can be increased with the use\nof radiopaque contrast agents. Therefore, further discrimination of structures\ncould be provided by spectral techniques, pivoting on either multi-energy\nacquisitions or photon-counting technology. Alternatively, phase-contrast\ntechniques unveil details typically undetected with conventional approaches.\nPhase-contrast imaging, based on the intrinsic decrement in the refractive\nindex of the tissue, can be achieved with different configurations and\nimplementations, including distinct X-ray sources and optical elements.\nAdditionally, some phase-contrast techniques retrieve the small-angle\nscattering-based dark-field signal, relatable to sub-pixel structures.

As the presence of a mass-transferring stellar or brown dwarf\ncompanion is excluded by infrared photometry, the detected spin down and X-ray\nemission could be tell-tale signs of a magnetically driven wind or of\ninteraction with circumstellar material, possibly originating from the fallback\nof gravitationally bound merger ejecta or from the tidal disruption of a\nplanetary object. We also detect Balmer emission, which requires the presence\nof ionized hydrogen in the vicinity of the white dwarf, showing Doppler shifts\nas high as $\\approx$ 2000 km s$^{-1}$. The unusual variability of the Balmer\nemission on the spin period of the white dwarf is consistent with the trapping\nof a half ring of ionised gas in the magnetosphere of the white dwarf.",

    "abstract": "We analyze the stellar light, 4000 Angstrom break and emission line profiles\nof 82 edge-on disk galaxies from the MaNGA survey. We characterize the stellar\nlight profiles perpendicular to the disk plane using two parameters: a) the\npower law slope of the thick disk component, 2) the transition radius where the\nprofile flattens. The 4000 Angstrom break profiles perpendicular to the plane\nare characterized by the number of significant changes in slope (breaks) and by\nthe change in D_n(4000) from inner to outer disk. The slope correlates tightly\nwith the stellar mass of the galaxy over the stellar mass range 10^9<log\nM*<10^10 M_sun. More massive galaxies have more extended thick disks. The slope\nand transition radius exhibit large scatter for galaxies more massive than\n10^{10} M_sun. Half the sample have older stellar populations in their thick\ndisks, a third have flat D$_n$(4000) profiles and 15% have younger thick disks.\nThe D$_n$(4000) profiles exhibit as many as 4 separate breaks. There are more\nbreaks in massive galaxies with bulges and more extended thick disks. This may\nindicate that the breaks are produced by more frequent accretion events in such\nsystems. The extra-planar Halpha EQW correlates most strongly with the specific\nstar formation rate of the galaxy, and the [OII]/Halpha ratio increases with\ndistance from the disk plane. This increase is most apparent for massive\ngalaxies with extended thick disk components and low SFR/M* These findings\nsupport the hypothesis that the larger [OII]/Halpha ratios may be caused by\nionization from evolved stars.",

Recent studies have presented encouraging evidence for\nintrinsic topological superconductivity in the Weyl semimetal trigonal\nPtBi$_2$, hinting at a robust surface phase potentially stable beyond the\nMcMillan limit. However, due to substantial spatial variations in the observed\nsuperconducting (SC) gap $\\Delta$ the nature of the underlying order parameter\n$\\Delta$($k$) remained under debate. Here we report the realization of sizable\nsurface SC gaps ($\\Delta > 10\\,\\mathrm{meV}$) in PtBi$_2$, exhibiting\nremarkable spatial uniformity from hundreds of nanometers down to the atomic\nlevel, as revealed by scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy. Building\non this spatial homogeneity -- indicative of long-range phase coherence -- we\nuncover previously unobserved low-energy Andreev bound states (ABSs) that\nubiquitously emerge within the SC gap across the surface. Theoretical\nsimulations that closely reproduce the experimental spectra, reveal an\nanisotropic chiral pairing symmetry of $\\Delta$($k$), and further suggest that\nthe observed ABSs are of topological origin.

A key challenge lies in the calculation of projection patterns under\nnon-standard conditions, such as the presence of occlusions and materials with\ndiverse optical properties, including varying refractive indices or scattering\nsurfaces. This work focuses on demonstrating a wide variety of overprinting\nscenarios. First, utilizing a telecentric laser-based TVAM (LaserTVAM), we\ndemonstrate the printing of a microfluidic perfusion system with biocompatible\nresins on existing nozzles for potential biomedical applications. In a\nsubsequent demonstration, embedded spheres within the bio-resins are localized\ninside this perfusion system, optimized into specific patterns, and\nsuccessfully connected to the nozzles via printed channels in less than three\nminutes. As a final LaserTVAM example, we print gears on a glossy metal rod,\ntaking into account the scattered rays from the rod's surface. Using a\nnon-telecentric LED-based TVAM (LEDTVAM), we then overprint engravings onto an\nexisting LED placed in the resin. With an additional printed lens on this LED,\nwe can project those engravings onto a screen. In a similar application with\nthe same setup, we print microlenses on a glass tube filled with water,\nallowing us to image samples embedded within the glass tubes. Based on a\ndifferentiable physically-based ray optical approach, we are able to optimize\nall these scenarios within our existing open-source framework called Dr.TVAM.\nThis framework enables the optimization of high-quality projections for both\nLaserTVAM and LEDTVAM setups within minutes, as well as lower-quality\nprojections within seconds, outperforming existing solutions in terms of speed,\nflexibility, and quality.",

In this work, we present a\nprobabilistic framework for detective fiction that allows us to define desired\nqualities. Using this framework, we formally define fair play and design\nappropriate metrics for it. Stemming from these definitions is an inherent\ntension between the coherence of the story, which measures how much it ``makes\nsense'', and the surprise it induces. We validate the framework by applying it\nto LLM-generated detective stories.

    "abstract": "Entanglement plays a crucial role in quantum information science and\nmany-body physics, yet quantifying it in mixed quantum many-body systems has\nremained a notoriously difficult problem. Here, we introduce families of\nquantitative entanglement witnesses, constructed from partial transpose and\nrealignment moments, which provide rigorous bounds on entanglement monotones.\nOur witnesses can be efficiently measured using SWAP tests or variants of Bell\nmeasurements, thus making them directly implementable on current hardware.\nLeveraging our witnesses, we present several novel results on entanglement\nproperties of mixed states, both in quantum information and many-body physics.\nWe develop efficient algorithms to test whether mixed states with bounded\nentropy have low or high entanglement, which previously was only possible for\npure states. We also provide an efficient algorithm to test the Schmidt rank\nusing only two-copy measurements, and to test the operator Schmidt rank using\nfour-copy measurements. Further, our witnesses enable robust certification of\nquantum circuit depth even in the presence of noise, a task which so far has\nbeen limited to noiseless circuits only. Finally, we show that the entanglement\nphase diagram of Haar random states, quantified by the partial transpose\nnegativity, can be fully established solely by computing our witness, a result\nthat also applies to any state 4-design. Our witnesses can also be efficiently\ncomputed for matrix product states, thus enabling the characterization of\nentanglement in extensive many-body systems.

    "abstract": "Automated vehicles (AVs) increasingly encounter ethically ambiguous\nsituations in everyday driving--scenarios involving conflicting human interests\nand lacking clearly optimal courses of action. While existing ethical models\noften focus on rare, high-stakes dilemmas (e.g., crash avoidance or trolley\nproblems), routine decisions such as overtaking cyclists or navigating social\ninteractions remain underexplored. This study addresses that gap by applying\nthe tracking condition of Meaningful Human Control (MHC), which holds that AV\nbehaviour should align with human reasons--defined as the values, intentions,\nand expectations that justify actions. We conducted qualitative interviews with\n18 AV experts to identify the types of reasons that should inform AV manoeuvre\nplanning. Thirteen categories of reasons emerged, organised across normative,\nstrategic, tactical, and operational levels, and linked to the roles of\nrelevant human agents. A case study on cyclist overtaking illustrates how these\nreasons interact in context, revealing a consistent prioritisation of safety,\ncontextual flexibility regarding regulatory compliance, and nuanced trade-offs\ninvolving efficiency, comfort, and public acceptance. Based on these insights,\nwe propose a principled conceptual framework for AV decision-making in routine,\nethically ambiguous scenarios. The framework supports dynamic, human-aligned\nbehaviour by prioritising safety, allowing pragmatic actions when strict legal\nadherence would undermine key values, and enabling constrained deviations when\nappropriately justified. This empirically grounded approach advances current\nguidance by offering actionable, context-sensitive design principles for\nethically aligned AV systems.",

In the present work, paying attention to the path integral measure\nand to the way $\\Lambda$ is introduced, we calculate the one-loop effective\naction $\\Gamma^{1l}$ for a scalar field on a non-trivial gravitational\nbackground. We find that $m^2$ presents only a (mild) logarithmic sensitivity\nto $\\Lambda$.

While sophisticated\nmethods have been proposed to detect signals as holes in the pattern of\nspectrogram zeros, few formal arguments have been made to support the\ndelineation and trapping effects. Through detailed computations for simple toy\nsignals, we show that two basic mathematical arguments, the intensity of zeros\nand Rouch\\'e's theorem, allow discussing delineation and trapping, and the\ninfluence of parameters like the signal-to-noise ratio.

In this\npaper, we aim to extract these key concepts and contributions from scientific\narticles in the form of Question and Answer (QA) pairs. We propose two distinct\napproaches for generating QAs. The first approach involves selecting salient\nparagraphs, using a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate questions, ranking\nthese questions by the likelihood of obtaining meaningful answers, and\nsubsequently generating answers. This method relies exclusively on the content\nof the articles. However, assessing an article's novelty typically requires\ncomparison with the existing literature. Therefore, our second approach\nleverages a Knowledge Graph (KG) for QA generation. We construct a KG by\nfine-tuning an Entity Relationship (ER) extraction model on scientific articles\nand using it to build the graph. We then employ a salient triplet extraction\nmethod to select the most pertinent ERs per article, utilizing metrics such as\nthe centrality of entities based on a triplet TF-IDF-like measure. This measure\nassesses the saliency of a triplet based on its importance within the article\ncompared to its prevalence in the literature. For evaluation, we generate QAs\nusing both approaches and have them assessed by Subject Matter Experts (SMEs)\nthrough a set of predefined metrics to evaluate the quality of both questions\nand answers. Our evaluations demonstrate that the KG-based approach effectively\ncaptures the main ideas discussed in the articles. Furthermore, our findings\nindicate that fine-tuning the ER extraction model on our scientific corpus is\ncrucial for extracting high-quality triplets from such documents.",

While existing Temporal Graph Neural\nNetworks (T-GNNs) have achieved notable success by leveraging complex\narchitectures to model temporal and structural dependencies, they often suffer\nfrom scalability and efficiency challenges due to high computational overhead.\nIn this paper, we propose EAGLE, a lightweight framework that integrates\nshort-term temporal recency and long-term global structural patterns. EAGLE\nconsists of a time-aware module that aggregates information from a node's most\nrecent neighbors to reflect its immediate preferences, and a structure-aware\nmodule that leverages temporal personalized PageRank to capture the influence\nof globally important nodes. To balance these attributes, EAGLE employs an\nadaptive weighting mechanism to dynamically adjust their contributions based on\ndata characteristics. Also, EAGLE eliminates the need for complex multi-hop\nmessage passing or memory-intensive mechanisms, enabling significant\nimprovements in efficiency. Extensive experiments on seven real-world temporal\ngraphs demonstrate that EAGLE consistently achieves superior performance\nagainst state-of-the-art T-GNNs in both effectiveness and efficiency,\ndelivering more than a 50x speedup over effective transformer-based T-GNNs.",

In contrast with other\nmethods, we show that SPDFT can be applied to a wide variety of materials\nincluding both metals and insulators. In particular, we illustrate its\ncapabilities by obtaining the spectra of SrTiO$_3$, diamond and metallic\nlithium. We find that, while SPDFT results in SrTiO$_3$ are quite similar to\nthose obtained from DFT using linear perturbation theory, we observe\nsignificant improvements over this method in both diamond and metallic lithium.\nThe inclusion of electron-electron interactions during the evolution of the\ndensity matrix in diamond allows the spectra to more closely resemble those\nobtained with the Bethe-Salpeter equation than from perturbation theory. In\nlithium time-dependent SPDFT not only predicts interband transitions but also\nthe Drude peak, opening the possibility of detailed ab initio studies of\ntransport properties beyond many of the usual approximations.",

This family of billiards classically has the property of mixed\nphase space with precisely one entirely regular and one fully chaotic (ergodic)\ncomponent, whose size depends on the width w of the stem, and has two limiting\ngeometries, namely the circle (as the integrable system) and stadium (as the\nfully chaotic system). Therefore, this one-parameter system is ideal to study\nthe semiclassical behavior of the quantum counterpart. Here, in paper I, we\nstudy the spectral statistics as a function of the geometry defined by w, and\nas a function of the semiclassical parameter k, which in this case is just the\nwavenumber k. We show that at sufficiently large k the level spacing\ndistribution is excellently described by the Berry-Robnik (BR) distribution\n(without fitting). At lower k the small deviations from it can be well\ndescribed by the Berry-Robnik-Brody (BRB) distribution, which captures the\neffects of weak dynamical localization of Poincar\\'e-Husimi functions. We also\nemploy the analytical theory of the level spacing ratios distribution P(r) for\nmixed-type systems, recently obtained by Yan (2025), which does not require a\nspectral unfolding procedure, and show excellent agreement with numerics in the\nsemiclassical limit of large k.

In\nthis work, we conduct a comprehensive test of the CDDR by combining baryon\nacoustic oscillation (BAO) data from the SDSS and DESI surveys with type Ia\nsupernova (SN) data from PantheonPlus and DESY5. We utilize an artificial\nneural network approach to match the SN and BAO data at the same redshift. To\nexplore potential violations of the CDDR, we consider three different\nparameterizations: (i) $\\eta(z)=1+\\eta_0z$; (ii) $\\eta(z)=1+\\eta_0z/(1+z)$;\n(iii) $\\eta(z)=1+\\eta_0\\ln(1+z)$. Our results indicate that the calibration of\nthe SN absolute magnitude $M_{\\rm B}$ plays a crucial role in testing potential\ndeviations from the CDDR, as there exists a significant negative correlation\nbetween $\\eta_0$ and $M_{\\rm B}$. For PantheonPlus analysis, when $M_{\\rm B}$\nis treated as a free parameter, no evidence of CDDR violation is found. In\ncontrast, fixing $M_{\\rm B}$ to the $M_{\\rm B}^{\\rm D20}$ prior with\n$-19.230\\pm0.040$ mag leads to a deviation at approximately the $2\\sigma$\nlevel, while fixing $M_{\\rm B}$ to the $M_{\\rm B}^{\\rm B23}$ prior with\n$-19.396\\pm0.016$ mag remains in agreement with the CDDR.

The objective\nis for each broker to share a unique piece of information with all others\nsimultaneously. Unlike previous approaches, this protocol enables a fully\nparallel, single-step communication exchange among all brokers, regardless of\ntheir physical locations. A key feature of this protocol is its ability to\nensure both the anonymity and privacy of all participants are preserved,\nmeaning no broker can discern the identity of the sender behind any received\ninformation. At its core, the Quantum Dining Information Brokers Problem serves\nas a conceptual framework for achieving anonymous, untraceable, and massively\nparallel information exchange in a distributed system. The proposed protocol\nintroduces three significant advancements. First, while quantum protocols for\none-to-many simultaneous information transmission have been developed, this is,\nto the best of our knowledge, one of the first quantum protocols to facilitate\nmany-to-many simultaneous information exchange. Second, it guarantees complete\nanonymity and untraceability for all senders, a critical improvement over\nsequential applications of one-to-many protocols, which fail to ensure such\nrobust anonymity. Third, leveraging quantum entanglement, the protocol operates\nin a fully distributed manner, accommodating brokers in diverse spatial\nlocations.

Therefore,\nstudying their emission processes is of general interest for constraining\ncosmological parameters or the behavior of ultra-dense matter. One common\nmethod to analyze electromagnetic data from BNS mergers is to sample a Bayesian\nposterior over the parameters of a physical model for the transient. However,\nsampling the posterior is computationally costly, and because of the many\nlikelihood evaluations needed in this process, detailed models are too\nexpensive to be used directly in inference. In the present article, we address\nthis problem by introducing fiesta, a python package to train machine learning\n(ML) surrogates for GRB afterglow and kilonova models that can accelerate\nlikelihood evaluations. Specifically, we introduce extensive ML surrogates for\nthe state-of-the-art GRB afterglow models afterglowpy and pyblastafterglow, as\nwell as a new surrogate for the KN emission as modeled by the possis code. Our\nsurrogates enable evaluation of the lightcurve posterior within minutes. We\nalso provide built-in posterior sampling capabilities in fiesta that rely on\nthe flowMC package which scale efficiently to higher dimensions when adding up\nto tens of nuisance sampling parameters. Because of its use of the JAX\nframework, fiesta also allows for GPU acceleration during both surrogate\ntraining and posterior sampling.

    "abstract": "Due to the computational complexity of evaluating interatomic forces from\nfirst principles, the creation of interatomic machine learning force fields has\nbecome a highly active field of research. However, the generation of training\ndatasets of sufficient size and sample diversity itself comes with a\ncomputational burden that can make this approach impractical for modeling rare\nevents or systems with a large configuration space. Fine-tuning foundation\nmodels that have been pre-trained on large-scale material or molecular\ndatabases offers a promising opportunity to reduce the amount of training data\nnecessary to reach a desired level of accuracy. However, even if this approach\nrequires less training data overall, creating a suitable training dataset can\nstill be a very challenging problem, especially for systems with rare events\nand for end-users who don't have an extensive background in machine learning.\nIn on-the-fly learning, the creation of a training dataset can be largely\nautomated by using model uncertainty during the simulation to decide if the\nmodel is accurate enough or if a structure should be recalculated with\nclassical methods and used to update the model. A key challenge for applying\nthis form of active learning to the fine-tuning of foundation models is how to\nassess the uncertainty of those models during the fine-tuning process, even\nthough most foundation models lack any form of uncertainty quantification. In\nthis paper, we overcome this challenge by introducing a fine-tuning approach\nbased on Bayesian neural network methods and a subsequent on-the-fly workflow\nthat automatically fine-tunes the model while maintaining a pre-specified\naccuracy and can detect rare events such as transition states and sample them\nat an increased rate relative to their occurrence.",

However, existing systems often face challenges: high model\ncomplexity hinders deployment in resource-constrained environments,\nunidirectional modal alignment neglects inter-modal relationships, and\nrobustness suffers when sensor data is missing. These issues impede efficient\nand robust multimodal perception in real-world IoT settings. To overcome these\nlimitations, we propose GRAM-MAMBA. This framework utilizes the\nlinear-complexity Mamba model for efficient sensor time-series processing,\ncombined with an optimized GRAM matrix strategy for pairwise alignment among\nmodalities, addressing the shortcomings of traditional single-modality\nalignment. Inspired by Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), we introduce an adaptive\nlow-rank layer compensation strategy to handle missing modalities\npost-training. This strategy freezes the pre-trained model core and irrelevant\nadaptive layers, fine-tuning only those related to available modalities and the\nfusion process. Extensive experiments validate GRAM-MAMBA's effectiveness. On\nthe SPAWC2021 indoor positioning dataset, the pre-trained model shows lower\nerror than baselines; adapting to missing modalities yields a 24.5% performance\nboost by training less than 0.2% of parameters. On the USC-HAD human activity\nrecognition dataset, it achieves 93.55% F1 and 93.81% Overall Accuracy (OA),\noutperforming prior work; the update strategy increases F1 by 23% while\ntraining less than 0.3% of parameters.

Furthermore, the computational intensity required by\nrepresentation learning significantly increases the running time. To address\nthese issues, we propose a collapsed Gibbs Sampling algorithm for the Dirichlet\nMultinomial Mixture model (GSDMM), which effectively handles the sparsity and\nhigh dimensionality of short texts while identifying representative words for\neach cluster. Based on several aspects of GSDMM that warrant further\nrefinement, we propose an improved approach, GSDMM+, designed to further\noptimize its performance. GSDMM+ reduces initialization noise and adaptively\nadjusts word weights based on entropy, achieving fine-grained clustering that\nreveals more topic-related information.

We present initial results from a\nspectroscopic survey with the Habitable-zone Planet Finder (HPF) and NEID\nspectrographs designed to characterize this sample and further investigate the\norigin of the radio emission. We provide four new insights into the sample.

Further, from a homogenous analysis of the HPF spectra, we infer\ntheir chromospheric activity and spectroscopic multiplicity states. From this,\nwe identify GJ 625, GJ 1151, and LHS 2395 as single, quiescent stars amenable\nto precise RV follow-up, making them strong MSPI candidates. II) We show that\nthe distribution of stellar inclinations are compatible with an isotropic\ndistribution, providing no evidence for a preference to pole-on configurations.\nIII) We refine the radial velocity solution for GJ 625 b, the only currently\nknown close-in planet in the sample, reducing the uncertainty in its orbital\nperiod by a factor of three, to facilitate future phase-dependent radio\nanalysis. IV) Finally, we identify GJ 3861 as a spectroscopic binary with an\norbital period of $P=14.841181_{-0.00010}^{+0.00011}$ d, making it the only\nconfirmed binary with a relatively short orbit in the sample, where we surmise\nthe radio emission is likely related to magnetospheric interactions between the\ntwo stars.

    "abstract": "Intelligence-biological, artificial, or collective-requires structural\ncoherence across recursive reasoning processes to scale effectively. As complex\nsystems grow, coherence becomes fragile unless a higher-order structure ensures\nsemantic consistency. This paper introduces the Recursive Coherence Principle\n(RCP): a foundational constraint stating that for any reasoning system of order\nN, composed of systems operating over conceptual spaces of order N-1, semantic\ncoherence is preserved only by a recursively evaluable generalization operator\nthat spans and aligns those lower-order conceptual spaces. Crucially, this\ncoherence enables structural alignment. Without recursive coherence, no system\ncan reliably preserve goals, meanings, or reasoning consistency at scale. We\nformally define the Functional Model of Intelligence (FMI) as the only known\noperator capable of satisfying the RCP at any scale. The FMI is a minimal,\ncomposable architecture with internal functions (evaluation, modeling,\nadaptation, stability, decomposition, bridging) and external functions\n(storage, recall, System 1 and System 2 reasoning) vital for preserving\nsemantic structure across inference and coordination layers. We prove that any\nsystem lacking the FMI will experience recursive coherence breakdown as it\nscales, arguing that common AI issues like misalignment, hallucination, and\ninstability are symptoms of this structural coherence loss. Unlike other\nfoundational principles, RCP uniquely captures the internal, recursive dynamics\nneeded for coherent, alignable intelligence, modeling semantic coherence under\nrecursion. This work significantly impacts AI alignment, advocating a shift\nfrom behavioral constraints to structural coherence, and offers a pathway for\nsafely generalizable, robustly coherent AI at scale.",

The clustering assumption has proven advantageous for learning\nwith limited supervision and states that data points belonging to the same\ncluster in a high-dimensional space should be assigned to the same category.\nRecent works have utilized different training mechanisms to implicitly enforce\nthis assumption for the SSL and UDA.

    "abstract": "Doubly nonnegative (DNN) relaxation usually provides a tight lower bound for\na mixed-binary quadratic program (MBQP). However, solving DNN problems is\nchallenging because: (1) the problem size is $\\Omega((n+l)^2)$ for an MBQP with\n$n$ variables and $l$ inequality constraints, and (2) the rank of optimal\nsolutions cannot be estimated a priori due to the absence of theoretical\nbounds. In this work, we propose RiNNAL+, a Riemannian augmented Lagrangian\nmethod (ALM) for solving DNN problems. We prove that the DNN relaxation of an\nMBQP, with matrix dimension $(n+l+1)$, is equivalent to the SDP-RLT relaxation\n(based on the reformulation-linearization technique) with a smaller matrix\ndimension $(n+1)$. In addition, we develop a hybrid method that alternates\nbetween two phases to solve the ALM subproblems. In phase one, we apply\nlow-rank matrix factorization and random perturbation to transform the feasible\nregion into a lower-dimensional manifold so that we can use the Riemannian\ngradient descent method. In phase two, we apply a single projected gradient\nstep to update the rank of the underlying variable and escape from spurious\nlocal minima arising in the first phase if necessary. To reduce the computation\ncost of the projected gradient step, we develop pre-processing and warm-start\ntechniques for acceleration. Unlike traditional rank-adaptive methods that\nrequire extensive parameter tuning, our hybrid method requires minimal tuning.\nExtensive experiments confirm the efficiency and robustness of RiNNAL+ in\nsolving various classes of large-scale DNN problems.",

Within an Intensity Modulation/Direct Detection\n(IMDD) system, the PNN is applied to 2-level Pulse Amplitude Modulated (PAM2)\noptical signals undergoing multi-span propagation.

    "abstract": "Feature engineering continues to play a critical role in image\nclassification, particularly when interpretability and computational efficiency\nare prioritized over deep learning models with millions of parameters. In this\nstudy, we revisit classical machine learning based image classification through\na novel approach centered on Permutation Entropy (PE), a robust and\ncomputationally lightweight measure traditionally used in time series analysis\nbut rarely applied to image data. We extend PE to two-dimensional images and\npropose a multiscale, multi-orientation entropy-based feature extraction\napproach that characterizes spatial order and complexity along rows, columns,\ndiagonals, anti-diagonals, and local patches of the image. To enhance the\ndiscriminatory power of the entropy features, we integrate two classic image\ndescriptors: the Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) to capture shape and\nedge structure, and Local Binary Patterns (LBP) to encode micro-texture of an\nimage. The resulting hand-crafted feature set, comprising of 780 dimensions, is\nused to train Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers optimized through grid\nsearch. The proposed approach is evaluated on multiple benchmark datasets,\nincluding Fashion-MNIST, KMNIST, EMNIST, and CIFAR-10, where it delivers\ncompetitive classification performance without relying on deep architectures.\nOur results demonstrate that the fusion of PE with HOG and LBP provides a\ncompact, interpretable, and effective alternative to computationally expensive\nand limited interpretable deep learning models. This shows a potential of\nentropy-based descriptors in image classification and contributes a lightweight\nand generalizable solution to interpretable machine learning in image\nclassification and computer vision.",

To address this issue, this paper\nproposes a Spectral Diffusion Prior (SDP) that is implicitly learned from\nhyperspectral images using a diffusion model. Leveraging the powerful ability\nof the diffusion model to reconstruct details, this learned prior can\nsignificantly improve the performance when injected into the HSI model.

Individuals update their opinions through a\nlearning process resembling Bayesian learning, but influenced by cognitive\nbiases such as under-reaction and confirmation bias. We study the model\nnumerically and demonstrate rich dynamics both with and without lobbyists. In\nthe presence of lobbying, we observe two regimes: one in which lobbyists can\nhave full influence on the agent network, and another where the peer-effect\ngenerates polarisation. When symmetric lobbyists are present, the lobbyist\ninfluence regime is characterised by long opinion oscillations, while in the\ntransition area between the two regimes we observe convergence to the\noptimistic model when the lobbying influence is long enough.

This paper provides the first\nunified review of ISAC-enabled sensing for both human activities and\nenvironment, focusing on signal-level mechanisms, sensing features, and\nreal-world feasibility. We begin by characterising how diverse physical\nphenomena, ranging from human vital sign and motion to precipitation and flood\ndynamics, impact wireless signal propagation, producing measurable signatures\nin channel state information (CSI), Doppler profiles, and signal statistics. A\ncomprehensive analysis is then presented across two domains: human sensing\napplications including localisation, activity recognition, and vital sign\nmonitoring; and environmental sensing for rainfall, soil moisture, and water\nlevel. Experimental results from Long-Term Evolution (LTE) sensing under\nnon-line-of-sight (NLOS) conditions are incorporated to highlight the\nfeasibility in infrastructure-limited scenarios.

    "abstract": "Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) like DeepSeek-R1 and o1 are increasingly used\nas automated evaluators, raising critical questions about their vulnerability\nto the aesthetics of reasoning in LLM-as-a-judge settings. We introduce\nTHEATER, a comprehensive benchmark to systematically evaluate this\nvulnerability-termed Reasoning Theater Bias (RTB)-by comparing LLMs and LRMs\nacross subjective preference and objective factual datasets. Through\ninvestigation of six bias types including Simple Cues and Fake\nChain-of-Thought, we uncover three key findings: (1) in a critical paradox,\nreasoning-specialized LRMs are consistently more susceptible to RTB than\ngeneral-purpose LLMs, particularly in subjective tasks; (2) this creates a\ntask-dependent trade-off, where LRMs show more robustness on factual tasks but\nless on subjective ones; and (3) we identify 'shallow reasoning'-plausible but\nflawed arguments-as the most potent form of RTB. To address this, we design and\nevaluate two prompting strategies: a targeted system prompt that improves\naccuracy by up to 12% on factual tasks but only 1-3% on subjective tasks, and a\nself-reflection mechanism that shows similarly limited effectiveness in the\nmore vulnerable subjective domains. Our work reveals that RTB is a deep-seated\nchallenge for LRM-based evaluation and provides a systematic framework for\ndeveloping more genuinely robust and trustworthy LRMs.",

The interpretation of the\nhelioseismic data is however complicated by the non-trivial relationship\nbetween helioseismic observables and the physical perturbations associated with\nacoustic modes, as well as by various instrumental effects. Aims: We aim to\nimprove our understanding of the signature of acoustic modes measured in the\nHelioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) continuum intensity and Doppler velocity\nobservables by accounting for radiative transfer, solar background rotation,\nand spacecraft velocity. Methods: We start with a background model atmosphere\nthat accurately reproduces solar limb darkening and the Fe I 6173{\\AA} spectral\nline profile. We employ first-order perturbation theory to model the effect of\nacoustic oscillations on inferred intensity and velocity. By solving the\nradiative transfer equation in the atmosphere, we synthesize the spectral line,\nconvolve it with the six HMI spectral windows, and deduce continuum intensity\n(hmi.Ic_45s) and Doppler velocity (hmi.V_45s) according to the HMI algorithm.\nResults: We analytically derive the relationship between mode displacement in\nthe atmosphere and the HMI observables, and show that both intensity and\nvelocity deviate significantly from simple approximations. Specifically, the\ncontinuum intensity does not simply reflect the true continuum value, while the\nline-of-sight velocity does not correspond to a straightforward projection of\nthe velocity at a fixed height in the atmosphere. Our results indicate that\nthese deviations are substantial, with amplitudes of approximately 10% and\nphase shifts of around 10 degrees across the detector for both observables.\nMoreover, these effects are highly dependent on the acoustic mode under\nconsideration and the position on the solar disk.",

Existing\napproaches often adapt pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) models to refine video\nframes, leading to issues such as flickering and artifacts due to\ninconsistencies across frames. In this paper, we introduce EVS, a training-free\nEncapsulated Video Synthesizer that composes T2I and T2V models to enhance both\nvisual fidelity and motion smoothness of generated videos. Our approach\nutilizes a well-trained diffusion-based T2I model to refine low-quality video\nframes by treating them as out-of-distribution samples, effectively optimizing\nthem with noising and denoising steps.

    "abstract": "Rapid and reliable solvers for parametric partial differential equations\n(PDEs) are needed in many scientific and engineering disciplines. For example,\nthere is a growing demand for composites and architected materials with\nheterogeneous microstructures. Designing such materials and predicting their\nbehavior in practical applications requires solving homogenization problems for\na wide range of material parameters and microstructures. While classical\nnumerical solvers offer reliable and accurate solutions supported by a solid\ntheoretical foundation, their high computational costs and slow convergence\nremain limiting factors. As a result, scientific machine learning is emerging\nas a promising alternative. However, such approaches often lack guaranteed\naccuracy and physical consistency. This raises the question of whether it is\npossible to develop hybrid approaches that combine the advantages of both\ndata-driven methods and classical solvers. To address this, we introduce\nUNO-CG, a hybrid solver that accelerates conjugate gradient (CG) solvers using\nspecially designed machine-learned preconditioners, while ensuring convergence\nby construction. As a preconditioner, we propose Unitary Neural Operators as a\nmodification of Fourier Neural Operators. Our method can be interpreted as a\ndata-driven discovery of Green's functions, which are then used to accelerate\niterative solvers. We evaluate UNO-CG on various homogenization problems\ninvolving heterogeneous microstructures and millions of degrees of freedom. Our\nresults demonstrate that UNO-CG enables a substantial reduction in the number\nof iterations and is competitive with handcrafted preconditioners for\nhomogenization problems that involve expert knowledge.

In this work, we demonstrate\nthat controlling the particle size of LaGaO3:Eu3+ phosphors enables significant\nenhancement of thermometric performance. Specifically, a reduction in grain\nsize dispersion leads to an increase in relative thermal sensitivity and\nsignificantly narrows the hysteresis loop. As a result of this approach, the\nrelative sensitivity was increased to 18.2% K-1 for LaGaO3:Eu3+ synthesized via\nthe solid-state method, compared to 3.0% K-1 for the counterpart prepared using\nthe Pechini method.

Using the WinoQueer benchmark, we quantify bias in three\nopen-source LLMs and observe baseline bias scores reaching up to 98 (out of\n100) across a range of queer identities defined by gender and/or sexual\norientation, where 50 would indicate neutrality.

    "abstract": "Rare, yet critical, scenarios pose a significant challenge in testing and\nevaluating autonomous driving planners. Relying solely on real-world driving\nscenes requires collecting massive datasets to capture these scenarios. While\nautomatic generation of traffic scenarios appears promising, data-driven models\nrequire extensive training data and often lack fine-grained control over the\noutput. Moreover, generating novel scenarios from scratch can introduce a\ndistributional shift from the original training scenes which undermines the\nvalidity of evaluations especially for learning-based planners. To sidestep\nthis, recent work proposes to generate challenging scenarios by augmenting\noriginal scenarios from the test set. However, this involves the manual\naugmentation of scenarios by domain experts. An approach that is unable to meet\nthe demands for scale in the evaluation of self-driving systems. Therefore,\nthis paper introduces a novel LLM-agent based framework for augmenting\nreal-world traffic scenarios using natural language descriptions, addressing\nthe limitations of existing methods. A key innovation is the use of an agentic\ndesign, enabling fine-grained control over the output and maintaining high\nperformance even with smaller, cost-effective LLMs. Extensive human expert\nevaluation demonstrates our framework's ability to accurately adhere to user\nintent, generating high quality augmented scenarios comparable to those created\nmanually.",

The four-body bound and resonance states are determined by solving\nthe Schr\\\"odinger equation employing the high-precision and efficient Gaussian\nExpansion Method (GEM) in conjunction with the powerful Complex Scaling Method\n(CSM). Besides, a comprehensive coupled-channel analysis of the $S$-wave\ntetraquark systems is performed, taking into account meson-meson,\ndiquark-antidiquark and K-type configurations, as well as all allowed color\nstructures. Several narrow resonant states are identified in each $I(J^P)$\nchannel. In particular, resonances for the $\\bar{b}c\\bar{q}c$ system are found\nin the mass range of $8.87-9.36$ GeV, while those for the $\\bar{c}b\\bar{q}b$\nsystem lie between $12.13-12.45$ GeV. Most of the predicted resonances are\ncompact tetraquark states with sizes smaller than $1.0$ fm, although four\nstates exhibit more extended structures with sizes around $1.3$ fm, suggesting\na more loosely bound nature. Magnetic moments and dominant wave function\ncomponents of these exotic states are also analyzed. The results indicate that\nK-type configurations play a major role in the structure of the observed\nresonances. Finally, possible strong decay channels (golden modes) for these\nstates are theoretically proposed.",

    "abstract": "Adversarial training is a promising strategy for enhancing model robustness\nagainst adversarial attacks. However, its impact on generalization under\nsubstantial data distribution shifts in audio classification remains largely\nunexplored. To address this gap, this work investigates how different\nadversarial training strategies improve generalization performance and\nadversarial robustness in audio classification. The study focuses on two model\narchitectures: a conventional convolutional neural network (ConvNeXt) and an\ninherently interpretable prototype-based model (AudioProtoPNet). The approach\nis evaluated using a challenging bird sound classification benchmark. This\nbenchmark is characterized by pronounced distribution shifts between training\nand test data due to varying environmental conditions and recording methods, a\ncommon real-world challenge. The investigation explores two adversarial\ntraining strategies: one based on output-space attacks that maximize the\nclassification loss function, and another based on embedding-space attacks\ndesigned to maximize embedding dissimilarity. These attack types are also used\nfor robustness evaluation. Additionally, for AudioProtoPNet, the study assesses\nthe stability of its learned prototypes under targeted embedding-space attacks.\nResults show that adversarial training, particularly using output-space\nattacks, improves clean test data performance by an average of 10.5% relative\nand simultaneously strengthens the adversarial robustness of the models. These\nfindings, although derived from the bird sound domain, suggest that adversarial\ntraining holds potential to enhance robustness against both strong distribution\nshifts and adversarial attacks in challenging audio classification settings.",

    "abstract": "In today's digital age, concerns about the dangers of AI-generated images are\nincreasingly common. One powerful tool in this domain is StyleGAN (style-based\ngenerative adversarial networks), a generative adversarial network capable of\nproducing highly realistic synthetic faces. To gain a deeper understanding of\nhow such a model operates, this work focuses on analyzing the inner workings of\nStyleGAN's generator component. Key architectural elements and techniques, such\nas the Equalized Learning Rate, are explored in detail to shed light on the\nmodel's behavior. A StyleGAN model is trained using the PyTorch framework,\nenabling direct inspection of its learned weights.

This ability to finetune visual traits is not only of\nacademic interest but also highlights a serious ethical concern: the potential\nmisuse of such technology.

    "abstract": "Molecular magnets are attractive as spin qubits due to their chemical\ntunability, addressability through electron-spin resonance techniques, and long\ncoherence times. Clock transitions (CTs), for which the system is immune to the\neffect of magnetic-field fluctuations to first order, provide a method to\nenhance the coherence time $T_2$, and to reveal mechanisms of decoherence that\nare not due to such fluctuations. Here we investigate two variants of Cr$_7$Mn,\na spin-1 molecular nanomagnet, at fields near a zero-field CT. We find that at\ntemperatures $\\le$2 K, $T_2\\sim1$ $\\mu$s at the CT using a Hahn-echo pulse\nsequence. Away from the CT, electron-spin-echo envelope modulation (ESEEM)\noscillations due to coupling to nuclear spins are observed and have a $T_2$ as\nhigh as $1.35$ $\\mu$s, indicating a distinct mechanism of coherence\npreservation. Dynamical decoupling with the CPMG pulse sequence yields\n$T_2\\sim\\!2.8$ $\\mu$s at the CT and up to $\\sim\\!3.6$ $\\mu$s in the ESEEM\nregime along with a demodulation of the oscillatory behavior. The experimental\nvalues of $T_2$ are largely independent of the degree of dilution of the\nmolecules in solvent or whether the solvent is deuterated, indicating that much\nof the decoherence and ESEEM arises from sources within the molecules\nthemselves. To account for decoherence, we develop a model that includes not\nonly field fluctuations but also fluctuations in the CT transition frequency\nitself. Our results can be well explained by treating the environment as a\ncombination of noise at the nuclear Larmor precession frequency and $1/f$ noise\nin the transverse anisotropy parameter $E$. Such information about the\nmicroscopic origins of decoherence can aid the rational design of\nmolecular-based spin qubits.",

While learning-based methods\nwith Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are effective at solving complex physical\nsystems, they encounter scalability issues when modeling deformable body\ninteractions. To model interactions between objects, pairwise global edges have\nto be created dynamically, which is computationally intensive and impractical\nfor large-scale meshes. To overcome these challenges, drawing on insights from\ngeometric representations, we propose an Adaptive Spatial Tokenization (AST)\nmethod for efficient representation of physical states. By dividing the\nsimulation space into a grid of cells and mapping unstructured meshes onto this\nstructured grid, our approach naturally groups adjacent mesh nodes. We then\napply a cross-attention module to map the sparse cells into a compact,\nfixed-length embedding, serving as tokens for the entire physical state.\nSelf-attention modules are employed to predict the next state over these tokens\nin latent space. This framework leverages the efficiency of tokenization and\nthe expressive power of attention mechanisms to achieve accurate and scalable\nsimulation results. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method\nsignificantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in modeling deformable\nbody interactions. Notably, it remains effective on large-scale simulations\nwith meshes exceeding 100,000 nodes, where existing methods are hindered by\ncomputational limitations.

When correlations are allowed, even the non-adaptive setting can\nbecome intractable, unless some structural constraints are imposed. To address\nthis, Bassily and Freund [2016] introduced the elegant framework of\nconcentrated queries, which requires the analyst to restrict itself to queries\nthat are concentrated around their expected value. While this assumption makes\nthe problem trivial in the non-adaptive setting, in the adaptive setting it\nremains quite challenging. In fact, all known algorithms in this framework\nsupport significantly fewer queries than in the independent case: At most\n$O(n)$ queries for a sample of size $n$, compared to $O(n^2)$ in the\nindependent setting.\n  In this work, we prove that this utility gap is inherent under the current\nformulation of the concentrated queries framework, assuming some natural\nconditions on the algorithm.

We discuss\ncommonalities between those Wisconsin-Carolina experiments and classic indices,\nespecially the plus minus 1 Pearson (1895) correlation (r) and 0~1 coefficient\nof determination, aka r squared (Wright, 1920). We pay tribute to the\ninfluential percent of maximum possible (POMP) coefficient by Cohen et al.\n(1999). The history of the 0~100 or 0~1 scales goes back far and wide. Roman\nfiscal records, early American grading experiments at Yale and Harvard, and\ncontemporary analysis of percent scales (0~100) and percentage scales (0~1, or\n-1~1) show the tendency to rediscover the scales and the indices based on the\nscales (Durm, 1993; Schneider & and Hutt, 2014). Data mining and machine\nlearning since the last century adopted the same logic: min-max normalization,\nwhich maps any feature to [0, 1] (i.e., 0-100%), equalizing the scale ranges.\nBecause 0~1 percentage scale assigns the entire scale to be the unit,\nequalizing the scales also equalizes the units of all percentized scales.\nEquitable units are necessary and sufficient for comparability of two indices,\naccording to the percentage theory of measurement indices (Cohen et al., 1999;\nZhao et al., 2024; Zhao & Zhang, 2014).

We\nsystematically investigate the band structures and electronic correlation\neffect to identify the key factors controlling superconductivity and pathways\nto enhance $T_c$.

We find the band energy at the $M$ point drops with the\ncompression, leading to increase of the density of states at the Fermi level,\nin stark contrast to the behavior of the bulk under pressure. We then apply\nfunctional renormalization group (FRG) method to study the electronic\ncorrelation effect on the superconductivity. We find the $s_\\pm$-wave pairing\nsymmetry remains robust in the films, the same as the bulk. But somewhat\nsurprisingly, for the films, we find $T_c$ can be enhanced by reducing the\nin-plane lattice constant, increasing the out-of-plane lattice constant, or\nfurther electron-doping. These findings are consistent with the itinerant\npicture of the superconductivity induced by spin-fluctuations and provide\ntheoretical support for further boosting $T_c$ in future experiments.",

TEM turbulence facilitates energy transfer from electrons to ions,\nwhich is opposite to the direction observed in ITG turbulence. In mixed ITG TEM\nturbulence, the relative magnitudes of parallel heating and perpendicular\ncooling for each species determine the overall direction and magnitude of\nenergy exchange.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we consider the Keller--Segel--Navier--Stokes system with\nnonlinear boundary conditions in a bounded smooth (and not necessarily convex)\ndomain $\\Omega \\subset \\mathbb{R}^N$, $N \\ge 2$, where the chemotactic\nsensitivity $S$ is assumed to have values in $\\mathbb{R}^{N \\times N}$ which\naccounts for rotational fluxes. In contrast to the case where $S$ is a\nscalar-valued function (or $S$ is the identity matrix), in our system, the\nnormal derivative for the density $n$ of the cell is given as the product of\nthe unknown functions, i.e., the function $n$ satisfies the nonlinear boundary\ncondition. We show the existence and uniqueness of global strong solutions to\nthe system under the smallness assumptions of given data, where the Lipschitz\ncontinuity of the solution mapping and the asymptotic stability of the solution\nare also shown. The proof is based on maximal regularity results for the linear\nheat equation and the Stokes system, where we establish a new maximal\nregularity theorem for some linear heat equation with an inhomogeneous Neumann\nboundary condition. Since we develop a direct approach to construct the\nsolutions (i.e., without considering limiting procedure in certain regularized\nproblem with homogeneous linear boundary conditions), our solutions indeed\nsatisfy the boundary conditions, which was not addressed clearly in the\nprevious contributions by Cao and Lankeit (2016) as well as Yu, Wang, and Zheng\n(2018). Under suitable regularity conditions on given data, the solution may be\nunderstood in a classical sense and, as a by-product, the non-negativity result\nis proved via the maximum principle of a new type.",

To this end, we first identify, by means of a\nvariational approximation and numerical solution, diverse stationary\ndomain-wall (DW) structures supported by the system in the absence of the\nmanagement. The approximate analytical solutions for the DWs are found to be in\nexcellent agreement with their numerical counterparts. An analytical estimate\nis also produced for the upshift of the MIM transition caused by the pressure\nof the trapping potential in the case of a confined system. An exact DW\nsolution is produced for the system including the P\\\"{o}schl-Teller potential,\nwhich is stable (unstable) if the potential is repulsive (attractive). Further,\nwe find the spectrum of linear excitations in the spatially uniform mixed\nstate, and thus establish parameter regions where the system is stable/unstable\nagainst demixing. In particular, RC upshifts the critical strength of the\ninter-component repulsion for the onset of the MIM transition. Eigenfrequencies\nof excitations on top of DW states are identified from numerical simulations\nthrough monitoring the evolution of perturbed states.

In this paper,\nwe present LoopServe, an adaptive dual-phase inference acceleration framework\nfor large language models in multi-turn dialogues. LoopServe introduces two\nmain innovations.

This precession arises from a\nmagnetic torque on the disk generated by the poloidal magnetic field aligned\nwith the BH's rotation, opposing the LT torque.

To\naddress these issues, we propose HeCoFuse, a unified framework designed for\ncooperative perception across mixed sensor setups where nodes may carry Cameras\n(C), LiDARs (L), or both. By introducing a hierarchical fusion mechanism that\nadaptively weights features through a combination of channel-wise and spatial\nattention, HeCoFuse can tackle critical challenges such as cross-modality\nfeature misalignment and imbalanced representation quality. In addition, an\nadaptive spatial resolution adjustment module is employed to balance\ncomputational cost and fusion effectiveness. To enhance robustness across\ndifferent configurations, we further implement a cooperative learning strategy\nthat dynamically adjusts fusion type based on available modalities. Experiments\non the real-world TUMTraf-V2X dataset demonstrate that HeCoFuse achieves 43.22%\n3D mAP under the full sensor configuration (LC+LC), outperforming the CoopDet3D\nbaseline by 1.17%, and reaches an even higher 43.38% 3D mAP in the L+LC\nscenario, while maintaining 3D mAP in the range of 21.74% to 43.38% across nine\nheterogeneous sensor configurations.

    "abstract": "This paper presents CARTS, an adaptive 5G uplink sensing scheme designed to\nprovide Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) services. The performance\nof both communication and sensing fundamentally depends on the availability of\naccurate and up-to-date channel state information (CSI). In modern 5G networks,\nuplink CSI is derived from two reference signals: the demodulation reference\nsignal (DMRS) and the sounding reference signal (SRS). However, current base\nstation implementations treat these CSI measurements as separate information\nstreams. The key innovation of CARTS is to fuse these two CSI streams, thereby\nincreasing the frequency of CSI updates and extending sensing opportunities to\nmore users. CARTS addresses two key challenges: (i) a novel channel stitching\nand compensation method that integrates asynchronous CSI estimates from DMRS\nand SRS, despite their different time and frequency allocations, and (ii) a\nreal-time SRS triggering algorithm that complements the inherently\nuncontrollable DMRS schedule, ensuring sufficient and non-redundant sensing\nopportunities for all users. Our trace-driven evaluation shows that CARTS\nsignificantly improves scalability, achieving a channel estimation error (NMSE)\nof 0.167 and UE tracking accuracy of 85 cm while supporting twice the number of\nusers as a periodic SRS-only baseline with similar performance. By\nopportunistically combining DMRS and SRS, CARTS therefore provides a practical,\nstandard-compliant solution to improve CSI availability for ISAC without\nrequiring additional radio resources.",

Our core idea is to leverage the masking-then-reconstruction\nstrategy of MAE to encourage the feature encoder to infer missing spatial and\nstructural information, thereby facilitating geometric-aware and\nocclusion-robust representation learning. Specifically, based on our\nobservation that human hands exhibit far greater geometric complexity than\nrigid objects, conventional uniform masking fails to effectively guide the\nreconstruction of fine-grained hand structures. To overcome this limitation, we\nintroduce a Region-specific Mask Ratio Allocation, primarily comprising the\nregion-specific masking assignment and the skeleton-driven hand masking\nguidance. The former adaptively assigns lower masking ratios to hand regions\nthan to rigid objects, balancing their feature learning difficulty, while the\nlatter prioritizes masking critical hand parts (e.g., fingertips or entire\nfingers) to realistically simulate occlusion patterns in real-world\ninteractions. Furthermore, to enhance the geometric awareness of the pretrained\nencoder, we introduce a novel Masked Signed Distance Field (SDF)-driven\nmultimodal learning mechanism. Through the self-masking 3D SDF prediction, the\nlearned encoder is able to perceive the global geometric structure of hands and\nobjects beyond the 2D image plane, overcoming the inherent limitations of\nmonocular input and alleviating self-occlusion issues.

    "abstract": "Deep thermalization refers to the emergence of Haar-like randomness from\nquantum systems upon partial measurements. As a generalization of quantum\nthermalization, it is often associated with high complexity and entanglement.\nHere, we introduce computational deep thermalization and construct the fastest\npossible dynamics exhibiting it at infinite effective temperature. Our circuit\ndynamics produce quantum states with low entanglement in polylogarithmic depth\nthat are indistinguishable from Haar random states to any computationally\nbounded observer. Importantly, the observer is allowed to request many copies\nof the same residual state obtained from partial projective measurements on the\nstate -- this condition is beyond the standard settings of quantum\npseudorandomness, but natural for deep thermalization. In cryptographic terms,\nthese states are pseudorandom, pseudoentangled, and crucially, retain these\nproperties under local measurements. Our results demonstrate a new form of\ncomputational thermalization, where thermal-like behavior arises from\nstructured quantum states endowed with cryptographic properties, instead of\nfrom highly unstructured ensembles. The low resource complexity of preparing\nthese states suggests scalable simulations of deep thermalization using quantum\ncomputers. Our work also motivates the study of computational quantum\npseudorandomness beyond BQP observers.",

Image restoration\nhas emerged as a core solution to this challenge and has been widely discussed\nin the literature. Although recent transformer-based approaches have made\nremarkable progress in image restoration, their increasing system complexity\nposes significant challenges for real-time processing, particularly in\nreal-world deployment scenarios. To this end, most existing methods attempt to\nsimplify the self-attention mechanism, such as by channel self-attention or\nstate space model. However, these methods primarily focus on network\narchitecture while neglecting the inherent characteristics of image restoration\nitself. In this context, we explore a pyramid Wavelet-Fourier iterative\npipeline to demonstrate the potential of Wavelet-Fourier processing for image\nrestoration. Inspired by the above findings, we propose a novel and efficient\nrestoration baseline, named Pyramid Wavelet-Fourier Network (PW-FNet).\nSpecifically, PW-FNet features two key design principles: 1) at the inter-block\nlevel, integrates a pyramid wavelet-based multi-input multi-output structure to\nachieve multi-scale and multi-frequency bands decomposition; and 2) at the\nintra-block level, incorporates Fourier transforms as an efficient alternative\nto self-attention mechanisms, effectively reducing computational complexity\nwhile preserving global modeling capability. Extensive experiments on tasks\nsuch as image deraining, raindrop removal, image super-resolution, motion\ndeblurring, image dehazing, image desnowing and underwater/low-light\nenhancement demonstrate that PW-FNet not only surpasses state-of-the-art\nmethods in restoration quality but also achieves superior efficiency, with\nsignificantly reduced parameter size, computational cost and inference time.",

The proposed method\naddresses key challenges in robotic locomotion, including accurate trajectory\ntracking under unmodeled dynamics and external disturbances. By leveraging the\nrepetitive nature of periodic gaits and extending ILC to nonperiodic tasks, the\nframework enhances accuracy and generalization across diverse locomotion\nscenarios. The control architecture is data-enabled, combining a physics-based\nmodel derived from hybrid-system trajectory optimization with real-time\nlearning to compensate for model uncertainties and external disturbances. A\ncentral contribution is the development of a generalized TL that stores learned\ncontrol profiles and enables rapid adaptation to changes in speed, terrain, and\ngravitational conditions-eliminating the need for repeated learning and\nsignificantly reducing online computation. The approach is validated on the\nbipedal robot Cassie and the quadrupedal robot A1 through extensive simulations\nand hardware experiments. Results demonstrate that the proposed framework\nreduces joint tracking errors by up to 85% within a few seconds and enables\nreliable execution of both periodic and nonperiodic gaits, including slope\ntraversal and terrain adaptation. Compared to state-of-the-art whole-body\ncontrollers, the learned skills eliminate the need for online computation\nduring execution and achieve control update rates exceeding 30x those of\nexisting methods.

Recent research on threats targeting ViT models primarily\nfocuses on generating the smallest adversarial perturbations that can deceive\nthe models with high confidence, without considering their impact on model\ninterpretations.

This paper attempts to address this problem by exploring two\ncomplementary aspects.\n  First, it proposes a framework for comparing existing test methods in terms\nof their intrinsic effectiveness and validity. It shows that many methods do\nnot meet both of these requirements. Either because they are based on criteria\nthat do not allow for rapid, inexpensive, and comprehensive detection of\nfailures, or because the degree of validity of the properties tested cannot be\naccurately estimated. In particular, it is shown that most critical test\nmethods do not take into account the nominal operational capabilities of\nautopilots and generate scenarios that are impossible for the tested vehicles\nto handle, resulting in unjustified rejections.\n  Secondly, the paper shows that test effectiveness and validity are highly\ndependent on how autopilots are designed: how they choose between different\ncontrol policies to perform maneuvers, as well as on the reproducibility of the\nresults. In fact, most test methods take for granted two principles underlying\ntraditional methods, but do not generally apply to ADS. We maintain that the\nabsence of rationality and determinacy significantly impairs the effectiveness\nand validity of test methods, and provide test results on eight open\nautopilots, in which most do not satisfy these properties, thereby illustrating\nthis fact.\n  We conclude that under the current state of the art, it is impossible to\nobtain strong enough guarantees for essential autopilot properties and\nrecommend that autopilots be developed with a view to both rationality and\ndeterminacy.",

    "abstract": "The rapid advancement of neural radiance fields (NeRF) has paved the way to\ngenerate animatable human avatars from a monocular video. However, the sole\nusage of NeRF suffers from a lack of details, which results in the emergence of\nhybrid representation that utilizes SMPL-based mesh together with NeRF\nrepresentation. While hybrid-based models show photo-realistic human avatar\ngeneration qualities, they suffer from extremely slow inference due to their\ndeformation scheme: to be aligned with the mesh, hybrid-based models use the\ndeformation based on SMPL skinning weights, which needs high computational\ncosts on each sampled point. We observe that since most of the sampled points\nare located in empty space, they do not affect the generation quality but\nresult in inference latency with deformation. In light of this observation, we\npropose EPSilon, a hybrid-based 3D avatar generation scheme with novel\nefficient point sampling strategies that boost both training and inference. In\nEPSilon, we propose two methods to omit empty points at rendering; empty ray\nomission (ERO) and empty interval omission (EIO). In ERO, we wipe out rays that\nprogress through the empty space. Then, EIO narrows down the sampling interval\non the ray, which wipes out the region not occupied by either clothes or mesh.\nThe delicate sampling scheme of EPSilon enables not only great computational\ncost reduction during deformation but also the designation of the important\nregions to be sampled, which enables a single-stage NeRF structure without\nhierarchical sampling. Compared to existing methods, EPSilon maintains the\ngeneration quality while using only 3.9% of sampled points and achieves around\n20 times faster inference, together with 4 times faster training convergence.\nWe provide video results on https://github.com/seungjun-moon/epsilon.",

This paper integrates CBFs and a sliding mode control\n(SMC) term into RL to simultaneously address safety, stability, and robustness\nto disturbances. However, this integration is significantly challenging due to\nthe strong coupling between the CBF and SMC terms. Inspired by Stackelberg\ngame, we handle the coupling issue by proposing a hierarchical design scheme\nwhere SMC and safe control terms interact with each other in a leader-follower\nmanner. Specifically, the CBF controller, acting as the leader, enforces safety\nindependently of the SMC design; while the SMC term, as the follower, is\ndesigned based on the CBF controller. We then formulate the PE problem as a\nzero-sum game and propose a safe robust RL framework to learn the min-max\nstrategy online. A sufficient condition is provided under which the proposed\nalgorithm remains effective even when constraints are conflicting. Simulation\nresults demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed safe robust RL framework.",

Within MDD,\nphoneme-level pronunciation assessment is key to helping L2 learners improve\ntheir pronunciation. However, most systems are based on a form of goodness of\npronunciation (GOP) which requires pre-segmentation of speech into phonetic\nunits. This limits the accuracy of these methods and the possibility to use\nmodern CTC-based acoustic models for their evaluation. In this study, we first\npropose self-alignment GOP (GOP-SA) that enables the use of CTC-trained ASR\nmodels for MDD. Next, we define a more general alignment-free method that takes\nall possible alignments of the target phoneme into account (GOP-AF). We give a\ntheoretical account of our definition of GOP-AF, an implementation that solves\npotential numerical issues as well as a proper normalization which makes the\nmethod applicable with acoustic models with different peakiness over time. We\nprovide extensive experimental results on the CMU Kids and Speechocean762\ndatasets comparing the different definitions of our methods, estimating the\ndependency of GOP-AF on the peakiness of the acoustic models and on the amount\nof context around the target phoneme.

While extensive knowledge exists about neuronal\nconnectivity and biophysics, a significant gap remains in how these elements\ncombine to produce flexible, learned behaviors. Here, we propose that a\nframework based on State-Space Models (SSMs), an emerging class of deep\nlearning architectures, can bridge this gap. We argue that the differential\nequations governing elements in an SSM are conceptually consistent with the\nbiophysical dynamics of neurons, while the combined dynamics in the model lead\nto emergent behaviors observed in experimental neuroscience. We test this\nframework by training an S5 model--a specific SSM variant employing a diagonal\nstate transition matrix--on temporal discrimination tasks with reinforcement\nlearning (RL). We demonstrate that the model spontaneously develops neural\nrepresentations that strikingly mimic biological 'time cells'. We reveal that\nthese cells emerge from a simple generative principle: learned rotational\ndynamics of hidden state vectors in the complex plane. This single mechanism\nunifies the emergence of time cells, ramping activity, and\noscillations/traveling waves observed in numerous experiments. Furthermore, we\nshow that this rotational dynamics generalizes beyond interval discriminative\ntasks to abstract event-counting tasks that were considered foundational for\nperforming complex cognitive tasks.

SAQR-QC has three characteristics: (i)\nsome (deliberate) loss of precision is built into it; (ii) it has a mechanism\nto help the accumulated loss of precision during a sequence of reasoning steps\nremain small; and (iii) most importantly, to make reasoning scalable, all\nreasoning steps are local--i.e., they each involve just a small number of\nqubits.

Currently, no\nstandardized method exists to determine the total amount of anatomical change\nthat necessitates replanning. This project aimed to create metrics to describe\nanatomical changes HNC patients may experience during RT and develop machine\nlearning (ML) models to predict RT replanning. We included a cohort of 150 HNC\npatients treated at the McGill University Health Centre. Based on the shape of\nthe RT structures, we created metrics and developed an extraction pipeline,\ncalled HNGeoNatomyX, to automatically calculate them. A univariate metric\nanalysis using linear regression was conducted to obtain the rate of change of\neach metric. We also obtained the relative variation of each metric between the\npre-treatment scan and the fraction at which replanning was requested.\nFraction-specific ML models (models that incorporated information available up\nto and including the specific fraction) for fractions 5, 10, and 15 were built\nusing the metrics, clinical data, and feature selection techniques. To estimate\nmodels' performance, we used a repeated stratified 5-fold cross-validation\nresampling technique and the Area Under the Curve (AUC) of the Receiver\nOperating Characteristic (ROC) curve. The best specific multivariate models for\nfractions 5, 10, and 15 yielded testing scores of 0.82, 0.70, and 0.79,\nrespectively. Our models early predicted replanning for 76% of the true\npositives.

    "abstract": "Separating moving and static objects from a moving camera viewpoint is\nessential for 3D reconstruction, autonomous navigation, and scene understanding\nin robotics. Existing approaches often rely primarily on optical flow, which\nstruggles to detect moving objects in complex, structured scenes involving\ncamera motion. To address this limitation, we propose Focus of Expansion\nLikelihood and Segmentation (FoELS), a method based on the core idea of\nintegrating both optical flow and texture information. FoELS computes the focus\nof expansion (FoE) from optical flow and derives an initial motion likelihood\nfrom the outliers of the FoE computation. This likelihood is then fused with a\nsegmentation-based prior to estimate the final moving probability. The method\neffectively handles challenges including complex structured scenes, rotational\ncamera motion, and parallel motion.

Behavioral science studies suggest\nthat screen-based news reading contains three successive steps: scanning, title\nreading, and then clicking. Adhering to these steps, we find that intra-news\nentity interest dominates the scanning stage, while the inter-news entity\ninterest guides title reading and influences click decisions. Unfortunately,\ncurrent methods overlook the unique utility of entities in news recommendation.\nTo this end, we propose a novel method called IP2 to probe entity-guided\nreading interest at both intra- and inter-news levels. At the intra-news level,\na Transformer-based entity encoder is devised to aggregate mentioned entities\nin the news title into one signature entity. Then, a signature entity-title\ncontrastive pre-training is adopted to initialize entities with proper meanings\nusing the news story context, which in the meantime facilitates us to probe for\nintra-news entity interest. As for the inter-news level, a dual tower user\nencoder is presented to capture inter-news reading interest from both the title\nmeaning and entity sides. In addition to highlighting the contribution of\ninter-news entity guidance, a cross-tower attention link is adopted to\ncalibrate title reading interest using inter-news entity interest, thus further\naligning with real-world behavior.

However, challenges\nsuch as over-smoothing and over-compression remain when handling large-scale\nand complex graph datasets, leading to a decline in clustering quality.\nAlthough the Graph Transformer architecture has mitigated some of these issues,\nits performance is still limited when processing heterogeneous graph data. To\naddress these challenges, this study proposes a novel deep clustering framework\nthat comprising GCN, Autoencoder (AE), and Graph Transformer, termed the\nTri-Learn Graph Fusion Network (Tri-GFN). This framework enhances the\ndifferentiation and consistency of global and local information through a\nunique tri-learning mechanism and feature fusion enhancement strategy. The\nframework integrates GCN, AE, and Graph Transformer modules. These components\nare meticulously fused by a triple-channel enhancement module, which maximizes\nthe use of both node attributes and topological structures, ensuring robust\nclustering representation. The tri-learning mechanism allows mutual learning\namong these modules, while the feature fusion strategy enables the model to\ncapture complex relationships, yielding highly discriminative representations\nfor graph clustering. It surpasses many state-of-the-art methods, achieving an\naccuracy improvement of approximately 0.87% on the ACM dataset, 14.14 % on the\nReuters dataset, and 7.58 % on the USPS dataset.

    "abstract": "The rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly\nimproved their ability to generate natural language, making texts generated by\nLLMs increasingly indistinguishable from human-written texts. While recent\nresearch has primarily focused on using LLMs to classify text as either\nhuman-written and machine-generated texts, our study focus on characterizing\nthese texts using a set of linguistic features across different linguistic\nlevels such as morphology, syntax, and semantics. We select a dataset of\nhuman-written and machine-generated texts spanning 8 domains and produced by 11\ndifferent LLMs. We calculate different linguistic features such as dependency\nlength and emotionality and we use them for characterizing human-written and\nmachine-generated texts along with different sampling strategies, repetition\ncontrols and model release date. Our statistical analysis reveals that\nhuman-written texts tend to exhibit simpler syntactic structures and more\ndiverse semantic content. Furthermore, we calculate the variability of our set\nof features across models and domains. Both human and machine texts show\nstylistic diversity across domains, with humans displaying greater variation in\nour features. Finally, we apply style embeddings to further test variability\namong human-written and machine-generated texts. Notably, newer models output\ntext that is similarly variable, pointing to an homogenization of\nmachine-generated texts.",

Off-Policy Evaluation (OPE) thus plays\na crucial role by enabling the evaluation of recommendation policies using only\noffline logged data naturally collected on the platform.

However, recent detections of\nkilonovae accompanying some lGRBs challenge this assumption, suggesting\npotential contamination from compact binary mergers. Here, we move beyond the\nconventional $T_{90}$-based classification and focus exclusively on GRBs\ndirectly associated with supernovae - the most direct signatures of massive\nstellar collapse - to reassess their connection to the SFR. Using a sample of\nSN/GRBs, we construct the luminosity - redshift ($L$-$z$) plane and uncover a\nsignificant correlation between these variables. To account for observational\nbiases, we apply the $\\tau$ statistic and Lynden-Bell's $C^{-}$ method to\nderive the intrinsic luminosity function and formation rate. Our analysis\nreveals that even among this well-defined subsample, the SN/GRB formation rate\nstill exceeds the SFR at low redshifts ($z < 1$).

Specifically,\nwe propose a makespan minimization problem for multi-task execution under MIG\nconstraints. Our profiling shows that assuming monotonicity in task work with\nrespect to resources is not viable, as is usual in multicore scheduling.\nRelying on a state-of-the-art proposal that does not require such an\nassumption, we present FAR, a 3-phase algorithm to solve the problem. Phase 1\nof FAR builds on a classical task moldability method, phase 2 combines Longest\nProcessing Time First and List Scheduling with a novel repartitioning tree\nheuristic tailored to MIG constraints, and phase 3 employs local search via\ntask moves and swaps. FAR schedules tasks in batches offline, concatenating\ntheir schedules on the fly in an improved way that favors resource reuse.\nExcluding reconfiguration costs, the List Scheduling proof shows an\napproximation factor of 7/4 on the NVIDIA A30 model. We adapt the technique to\nthe particular constraints of an NVIDIA A100/H100 to obtain an approximation\nfactor of 2.

In this paper, we propose a novel diffusion model (DM)-based\nframework, dubbed \\ours, for image deblurring by learning spatially varying\ntexture prior from unpaired data. In particular, \\ours performs DM to generate\nthe prior knowledge that aids in recovering the textures of blurry images. To\nimplement this, we propose a Texture Prior Encoder (TPE) that introduces a\nmemory mechanism to represent the image textures and provides supervision for\nDM training. To fully exploit the generated texture priors, we present the\nTexture Transfer Transformer layer (TTformer), in which a novel\nFilter-Modulated Multi-head Self-Attention (FM-MSA) efficiently removes\nspatially varying blurring through adaptive filtering.

To this end, we employ the relativistic\npoint-coupling model, with which the Fock terms are considerably simplified,\nreducing them to the same form as the Hartree terms. In analogy to the slope\nparameter $L$ of the isospin-symmetry energy for spin-unpolarized matter, we\nevaluate the spin slope parameter $L_s$ of the corresponding spin-symmetry\nenergy for spin-polarized matter. We find that the slope parameter $L$ and the\nspin slope parameter $L_s$ have a negative correlation in the case of isoscalar\npolarization, where neutrons and protons are spin-polarized in the same\ndirection. On the other hand, the spin slope parameter is nearly independent of\nthe slope parameter in the case of isovector polarization, where neutrons are\nspin-polarized along the opposite direction to protons.

It also includes a differentiable\nwavelet basis selection mechanism, enabling adaptive processing using families\nsuch as Haar, Daubechies, and Biorthogonal wavelets.\n  Implemented in PyTorch with full 3D support, the model maintains a spectral\npipeline without spatial convolutions or attention. On synthetic 3D denoising\nand natural language tasks from the GLUE benchmark, including SST-2 sentiment\nclassification, the model achieves 89.3 percent accuracy, close to a 4-layer\nTransformer baseline (90.1 percent), while using 72 percent fewer parameters\nand 58 percent less peak memory. Faster early convergence is observed due to\nspectral sparsity priors.\n  In contrast to the quadratic complexity of self-attention and large matrix\nmultiplications in Transformers, our approach uses linear-time wavelet\ntransforms and pointwise nonlinearities, significantly reducing inference cost.\nThis yields a compact, interpretable, and efficient alternative to neural\nmodels.

Using hybrid\nsimulations, we show that energy transfer from the pump to the seed reduces the\nlatter's spatial damping. By comparing seed wave amplitudes with and without\nthe pump wave, this damping reduction can be used as a direct and reliable\nproxy for PDI growth. The method is validated in our simulations across a range\nof plasma and wave parameters and agrees well with theoretical predictions.\nNotably, the scheme exhibits no threshold for PDI excitation and is, in\nprinciple, readily implementable under current laboratory conditions.

The mechanical\ninteractions between the contact lens and the eye are difficult to measure and\ncalculate in the clinical setting, and the research in this field is limited.\nThis paper presents the first mathematical model that couples the interaction\nbetween the contact lens and the open eye, where the contact lens\nconfiguration, the contact lens suction pressure, and the deformed ocular shape\nare all emergent properties of the model. The non-linear coupling between the\ncontact lens and the eye is achieved assuming the the suction pressure under\nthe lens is applied directly to the ocular surface, neglecting the post-lens\ntear film layer. The contact lens dynamics is modeled using a previous\npublished model. We consider a homogeneous and a heterogeneous linear elastic\neye model, different ocular shapes, different lens shapes and lens thickness\nprofiles, and extract lens deformation, lens suction pressure profiles, and\nocular deformations and stresses for all the scenarios considered.

Accounting for a heterogeneous material eye\nparameters increases such deformations and stresses. The ocular displacements\nand stresses increase non-linearly as we increase the stiffness of the contact\nlens.

By mapping images from distinct classes to\nnearly-orthogonal quantum states, the system maximizes separability in the\nHilbert space, enabling robust classification. We evaluate the performance of\nour model on several benchmark datasets with various number of features and\nclasses. Moreover, we demonstrate the key role of the quantum module in\nachieving high classification accuracy which cannot be accomplished by the\nclassical neural network alone. This showcases the potential of our hybrid\nprotocol for achieving practical quantum advantage and paves the way for future\nadvancements in quantum-enhanced computational techniques.",

    "abstract": "Advancements in volume visualization (VolVis) focus on extracting insights\nfrom 3D volumetric data by generating visually compelling renderings that\nreveal complex internal structures. Existing VolVis approaches have explored\nnon-photorealistic rendering techniques to enhance the clarity, expressiveness,\nand informativeness of visual communication. While effective, these methods\noften rely on complex predefined rules and are limited to transferring a single\nstyle, restricting their flexibility. To overcome these limitations, we\nadvocate the representation of VolVis scenes using differentiable Gaussian\nprimitives combined with pretrained large models to enable arbitrary style\ntransfer and real-time rendering. However, conventional 3D Gaussian primitives\ntightly couple geometry and appearance, leading to suboptimal stylization\nresults. To address this, we introduce TexGS-VolVis, a textured Gaussian\nsplatting framework for VolVis. TexGS-VolVis employs 2D Gaussian primitives,\nextending each Gaussian with additional texture and shading attributes,\nresulting in higher-quality, geometry-consistent stylization and enhanced\nlighting control during inference. Despite these improvements, achieving\nflexible and controllable scene editing remains challenging. To further enhance\nstylization, we develop image- and text-driven non-photorealistic scene editing\ntailored for TexGS-VolVis and 2D-lift-3D segmentation to enable partial editing\nwith fine-grained control. We evaluate TexGS-VolVis both qualitatively and\nquantitatively across various volume rendering scenes, demonstrating its\nsuperiority over existing methods in terms of efficiency, visual quality, and\nediting flexibility.",

    ],
    "abstract": "Halo effective field theory (Halo-EFT) has proved to be very efficient for\ndescribing halo nuclei within models of nuclear reactions. Its order-by-order\nexpansion scheme enables us to single out the structure observables that are\nprobed in reactions, and therefore improve the accuracy of their values\ninferred from experiment. This formalism is however limited by its breakdown\nscale. Structure effects beyond that scale cannot be considered explicitly in\nreaction models. To extend the usual Halo-EFT, we include core excitation\nconsidering a particle-rotor model. We apply it to the case of $^{11}$Be, the\narchetypical one-neutron halo nucleus. The corresponding set of coupled\nequations is solved using the R-matrix method on a Lagrange mesh. As a first\napplication, we analyze in detail the structure of both bound states of\n$^{11}$Be and the $^{10}$Be-n phaseshifts at low energy in the corresponding\npartial wave as a function of the core deformation. We also compute the\nelectric dipole transition between these bound states. The comparison of our\nresults with existing \\textit{ab initio} calculations, show that including core\nexcitation within Halo-EFT can significantly improve the description of the\n$\\frac{1}{2}^+$ ground state of $^{11}$Be over single-particle models. On the\ncontrary, core excitation has a negative effect on the description of the\n$\\frac{1}{2}^-$ bound excited state. This is probably related to the presence\nof Pauli-forbidden states in our two-body model of $^{11}$Be.",

    "authors": [
      "Yu Shi"
    ],
    "abstract": "In this paper, the historical origins of quantum entanglement in particle\nphysics are systematically and thoroughly investigated. 1957, Bohm and Aharonov\nnoted that the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen correlation had been experimentally\nrealised in the 1949 experiment of Chien-Shiung Wu and Shaknov. This was the\nfirst time in history that spatially separated quantum entanglement was\nexplicitly realised in a controlled experiment. Wheeler first proposed such an\nexperiment as a test of quantum electrodynamics, but his calculation was in\nerror; the correct theoretical calculations came from Ward and Price, as well\nas from Snyder, Pasternack and Hornbostel, and the result was in accordance\nwith Yang's 1949 selection rule. After the publication of Bell's inequality in\n1964, it was considered whether it could be tested by using the Wu-Shaknov\nexperiment. This gave an impetus to the field, and a new experiment was done by\nWu's group, though it was not successful as a test of Bell inequality\nviolation. In 1957, Tsung-Dao Lee, Reinhard Oehme and Chen Ning Yang\nestablished the quantum mechanical description of the kaons and found that the\nneutral kaon is a two-state system. In 1958, based on an approach similar to\nYang's 1949 selection rule, Goldhaber, Lee and Yang were the first to write\ndown the entangled states of kaon pairs, in which a single kaon can be charged\nor neutral. This gave, for the first time, quantum entanglement of internal\ndegrees of freedom of high-energy particles other than photons. In 1960, as\nunpublished work, Lee and Yang discussed the consequences of quantum\nentanglement of neutral kaon pairs. We also describe several physicists in the\npast, especially Ward. A Chinese version of this paper was published in early\n2023.",
