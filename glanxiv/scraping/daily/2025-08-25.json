    "abstract": "Predicting protein function from amino acid sequence remains a central\nchallenge in data-scarce (low-$N$) regimes, limiting machine learning-guided\nprotein design when only small amounts of assay-labeled sequence-function data\nare available. Protein language models (pLMs) have advanced the field by\nproviding evolutionary-informed embeddings and sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have\nenabled decomposition of these embeddings into interpretable latent variables\nthat capture structural and functional features. However, the effectiveness of\nSAEs for low-$N$ function prediction and protein design has not been\nsystematically studied. Herein, we evaluate SAEs trained on fine-tuned ESM2\nembeddings across diverse fitness extrapolation and protein engineering tasks.\nWe show that SAEs, with as few as 24 sequences, consistently outperform or\ncompete with their ESM2 baselines in fitness prediction, indicating that their\nsparse latent space encodes compact and biologically meaningful representations\nthat generalize more effectively from limited data. Moreover, steering\npredictive latents exploits biological motifs in pLM representations, yielding\ntop-fitness variants in 83% of cases compared to designing with ESM2 alone.",

    "abstract": "While single-purchase choice models have been widely studied in assortment\noptimization, customers in modern retail and e-commerce environments often\npurchase multiple items across distinct product categories, exhibiting both\nsubstitution and complementarity. We consider the cross-category assortment\noptimization problem where retailers jointly determine assortments across\ncategories to maximize expected revenue. Most prior work on the topic either\noverlooks complementarity or proposes models that lead to intractable\noptimization problems, despite being based on the multinomial logit (MNL)\nchoice model. We propose a sequential multi-purchase choice model for\ncross-category choice that incorporates complementarity through a Markovian\ntransition structure across categories, while allowing general Random Utility\nMaximization (RUM)-based choice models to capture the within-category\nsubstitution. We develop an Expectation-Maximization algorithm for estimation,\nand a polynomial-time algorithm for unconstrained assortment optimization that\nyields the optimal solution when the within-category substitution follows a\nMarkov chain choice model.\n  Furthermore, we introduce an empirical metric to quantify complementarity\nstrength across product categories and conduct extensive numerical experiments\non both synthetic data and a large-scale transaction-level dataset from a major\nUS grocery store. Our model yields improvements in predictive accuracy, model\nfit, and expected revenue in setting with complementarity, and it reveals\nintuitive market structures such as brand-loyal cross-category purchasing.\nOverall, we believe that our model provides a theoretically-grounded and\npractical framework for modeling complementarity and making better\ncross-category assortment decisions.",

We propose the Stochastic\nPushForward (SPF) framework, which retains one-step-ahead training while\nenabling multi-step learning. SPF builds a supplementary dataset from model\npredictions and combines it with ground truth via a stochastic acquisition\nstrategy, balancing short- and long-term performance while reducing\noverfitting. Multi-step predictions are precomputed between epochs, keeping\nmemory usage stable without storing full unrolled sequences.

While many of these breaches are attributable to vulnerabilities\nwithin website infrastructure, the strength and security of the passwords\nthemselves also play a crucial role. Consequently, the creation of secure\npasswords constitutes a fundamental aspect of enhancing overall system security\nand protecting personal data. In response to these challenges, this study\npresents a secure password generation approach utilizing a cryptographically\nsecure Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG). The generator is implemented\nusing a range of Message Authentication Code (MAC) algorithms, including the\nKeyed-Hash Message Authentication Code (HMAC), Cipher-based Message\nAuthentication Code (CMAC), and KECCAK Message Authentication Code (KMAC), to\nproduce robust random values suitable for password generation. To evaluate the\nproposed method, empirical assessments were conducted in accordance with the\nguidelines provided in the National Institute of Standards and Technology\n(NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-90B. The evaluation focused on two primary\naspects: entropy estimation and verification of independent and identically\ndistributed (IID) properties.

While explainable artificial\nintelligence methods aim to scrutinize model predictions by identifying\ninfluential molecular substructures, many existing approaches rely on masking\nstrategies that remove either atoms or atom-level features to assess importance\nvia fidelity metrics. These methods, however, often fail to adhere to the\nunderlying molecular distribution and thus yield unintuitive explanations. In\nthis work, we propose counterfactual masking, a novel framework that replaces\nmasked substructures with chemically reasonable fragments sampled from\ngenerative models trained to complete molecular graphs. Rather than evaluating\nmasked predictions against implausible zeroed-out baselines, we assess them\nrelative to counterfactual molecules drawn from the data distribution. Our\nmethod offers two key benefits: (1) molecular realism underpinning robust and\ndistribution-consistent explanations, and (2) meaningful counterfactuals that\ndirectly indicate how structural modifications may affect predicted properties.\nWe demonstrate that counterfactual masking is well-suited for benchmarking\nmodel explainers and yields more actionable insights across multiple datasets\nand property prediction tasks.

Existing approaches, such\nas the Partial Information Decomposition, struggle to scale beyond two\nmodalities and lack the resolution needed for instance-level control.

Our method does not require additional\nparameters and can be applied to an arbitrary number of modalities.\nSpecifically, BTW computes per-example KL weights by measuring the divergence\nbetween each unimodal and the current multimodal prediction, and modality-wide\nMI weights by estimating global alignment between unimodal and multimodal\noutputs.

Teachable agents, particularly those capable of posing persistent\nfollow-up questions, have been shown to encourage students (tutors) to shift\nfrom knowledge-telling to knowledge-building and enhance tutor learning. Tutor\nlearning encompasses two interrelated types of knowledge: conceptual and\nprocedural knowledge.

    "abstract": "In situ polymerization of conductive polymers (CPs) represents a\ntransformative approach in bioelectronics, by enabling the controlled growth of\nelectrically active materials right at the tissue or device surface to create\nseamless biotic-abiotic interfaces. Traditional CP deposition techniques often\nuse high anodic potentials, non-physiological electrolytes, or strong oxidants,\nmaking them harmful to adjacent tissues. A possible solution is enzymatic\npolymerization which operates under milder conditions, but it is limited by the\nstability and activity window of the enzyme catalysts, low throughput, and\nchallenges in spatially confining polymer growth. To resolve these issues, here\nwe developed one-dimensional porous Au-coated Ag nanowires with horseradish\nperoxidase (HRP)-like catalytic properties, thereby for the first time enabling\nmild in situ enzyme-free polymerization of conductive polymers near neutral pH.\nThe enzyme-free polymerization is demonstrated both in aqueous dispersions at\npH=6 and in situ onto porous Au coated Ag nanowire based stretchable\nelectrodes. Following enzyme-free catalytic polymerization, the electrically\nconducting polymer coating on the electrode greatly improves the impedance and\nachieves an impedance of 2.6 kOhm at 1 kHz for 50x50 um large electrodes.",

This paper introduces a novel\nframework for generating such levels, centered on the offline, LLM-assisted\nconstruction of reusable databases for architectural components (facilities and\nroom templates) and gameplay mechanic elements. Our multi-phase pipeline\nassembles levels by: (1) selecting and arranging instances from the Room\nDatabase to form a multi-floor global structure with an inherent topological\norder; (2) optimizing the internal layout of facilities for each room based on\npredefined constraints from the Facility Database; and (3) integrating\nprogression-based gameplay mechanics by placing components from a Mechanics\nDatabase according to their topological and spatial rules. A subsequent\ntwo-phase repair system ensures navigability. This approach combines modular,\ndatabase-driven design with constraint-based optimization, allowing for\nsystematic control over level structure and the adaptable pacing of gameplay\nelements. Initial experiments validate the framework's ability in generating\ndiverse, navigable 3D environments and its capability to simulate distinct\ngameplay pacing strategies through simple parameterization.

We show that, on any\ndigital computer, our construction emulates the circuit exactly--no\napproximation, no rounding, modular overflow included--demonstrating that no\nreasoning task lies beyond the reach of neural networks. The number of neurons\nin the resulting network (parametric complexity) scales with the circuit's\ncomplexity, and the network's computational graph (structure) mirrors that of\nthe emulated circuit. This formalizes the folklore that NNs networks trade\nalgorithmic run-time (circuit runtime) for space complexity (number of\nneurons).\n  We derive a range of applications of our main result, from emulating\nshortest-path algorithms on graphs with cubic--size NNs, to simulating stopped\nTuring machines with roughly quadratically--large NNs, and even the emulation\nof randomized Boolean circuits.

    "abstract": "Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) pose a significant clinical risk due to\ntheir potential for rupture, which is often asymptomatic but can be fatal.\nAlthough maximum diameter is commonly used for risk assessment, diameter alone\nis insufficient as it does not capture the properties of the underlying\nmaterial of the vessel wall, which play a critical role in determining the risk\nof rupture. To overcome this limitation, we propose a deep learning-based\nframework for elasticity imaging of AAAs with 2D ultrasound. Leveraging finite\nelement simulations, we generate a diverse dataset of displacement fields with\ntheir corresponding modulus distributions. We train a model with U-Net\narchitecture and normalized mean squared error (NMSE) to infer the spatial\nmodulus distribution from the axial and lateral components of the displacement\nfields. This model is evaluated across three experimental domains: digital\nphantom data from 3D COMSOL simulations, physical phantom experiments using\nbiomechanically distinct vessel models, and clinical ultrasound exams from AAA\npatients. Our simulated results demonstrate that the proposed deep learning\nmodel is able to reconstruct modulus distributions, achieving an NMSE score of\n0.73\\%. Similarly, in phantom data, the predicted modular ratio closely matches\nthe expected values, affirming the model's ability to generalize to phantom\ndata. We compare our approach with an iterative method which shows comparable\nperformance but higher computation time. In contrast, the deep learning method\ncan provide quick and effective estimates of tissue stiffness from ultrasound\nimages, which could help assess the risk of AAA rupture without invasive\nprocedures.",

However, the\neffectiveness of VQAs is often constrained by the so-called barren plateau\nproblem, wherein gradients diminish exponentially as system size or circuit\ndepth increases, thereby hindering training. In this work, we propose a\nreinforcement learning (RL)-based initialization strategy to alleviate the\nbarren plateau issue by reshaping the initial parameter landscape to avoid\nregions prone to vanishing gradients. In particular, we explore several RL\nalgorithms (Deterministic Policy Gradient, Soft Actor-Critic, and Proximal\nPolicy Optimization, etc.) to generate the circuit parameters (treated as\nactions) that minimize the VQAs cost function before standard gradient-based\noptimization. By pre-training with RL in this manner, subsequent optimization\nusing methods such as gradient descent or Adam proceeds from a more favorable\ninitial state. Extensive numerical experiments under various noise conditions\nand tasks consistently demonstrate that the RL-based initialization method\nsignificantly enhances both convergence speed and final solution quality.\nMoreover, comparisons among different RL algorithms highlight that multiple\napproaches can achieve comparable performance gains, underscoring the\nflexibility and robustness of our method. These findings shed light on a\npromising avenue for integrating machine learning techniques into quantum\nalgorithm design, offering insights into how RL-driven parameter initialization\ncan accelerate the scalability and practical deployment of VQAs.

Moreover, in de\nSitter space, the construction is even more problematic due to the absence of a\nglobal timelike Killing vector and the presence of multiple horizons. In this\nwork, we show that extended thermodynamics arises naturally in a\nDvali-Gabadadze-Porrati (DGP) braneworld once the brane tension $\\sigma$ is\nvaried in the Iyer--Wald formalism. A positive-tension brane is dynamically\nstable, ghost-free, and induces a localized vacuum energy density\n$T^{(\\sigma)}_{\\mu\\nu}=-\\sigma g_{\\mu\\nu}$, corresponding to a negative\npressure $P_\\sigma=-\\sigma$.

In this study, we propose Dual Local-Global\nEncoder (DLGE), enabling the classification across different BCI paradigms. To\naddress the heterogeneity in EEG channel configurations across paradigms, we\nemploy an anatomically inspired brain-region partitioning and padding strategy\nto standardize EEG channel configuration. In the proposed model, the local\nencoder is designed to learn shared features across BCI paradigms within each\nbrain region based on time-frequency information, which integrates temporal\nattention on individual channels with spatial attention among channels for each\nbrain region. These shared features are subsequently aggregated in the global\nencoder to form respective paradigm-specific feature representations.

    "abstract": "Accurate 3D scene flow estimation is critical for autonomous systems to\nnavigate dynamic environments safely, but creating the necessary large-scale,\nmanually annotated datasets remains a significant bottleneck for developing\nrobust perception models. Current self-supervised methods struggle to match the\nperformance of fully supervised approaches, especially in challenging\nlong-range and adverse weather scenarios, while supervised methods are not\nscalable due to their reliance on expensive human labeling. We introduce\nDoGFlow, a novel self-supervised framework that recovers full 3D object motions\nfor LiDAR scene flow estimation without requiring any manual ground truth\nannotations. This paper presents our cross-modal label transfer approach, where\nDoGFlow computes motion pseudo-labels in real-time directly from 4D radar\nDoppler measurements and transfers them to the LiDAR domain using dynamic-aware\nassociation and ambiguity-resolved propagation. On the challenging MAN\nTruckScenes dataset, DoGFlow substantially outperforms existing self-supervised\nmethods and improves label efficiency by enabling LiDAR backbones to achieve\nover 90% of fully supervised performance with only 10% of the ground truth\ndata.

Traditional fact-checking methods, while\nvaluable, are insufficient for detecting the subtle logical inconsistencies\nthat can mislead readers within seemingly factual content. To address this gap,\nwe introduce Skeptik, a hybrid framework that integrates Large Language Models\n(LLMs) with heuristic approaches to analyze and annotate potential logical\nfallacies and reasoning errors in online news articles. Operating as a web\nbrowser extension, Skeptik automatically highlights sentences that may contain\nlogical fallacies, provides detailed explanations, and offers multi-layered\ninterventions to help readers critically assess the information presented. The\nsystem is designed to be extensible, accommodating a wide range of fallacy\ntypes and adapting to evolving misinformation tactics. Through comprehensive\ncase studies, quantitative analyses, usability experiments, and expert\nevaluations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of Skeptik in enhancing readers'\ncritical examination of news content and promoting media literacy. Our\ncontributions include the development of an expandable classification system\nfor logical fallacies, the innovative integration of LLMs for real-time\nanalysis and annotation, and the creation of an interactive user interface that\nfosters user engagement and close reading. By emphasizing the logical integrity\nof textual content rather than relying solely on factual accuracy, Skeptik\noffers a comprehensive solution to combat potential misinformation in\njournalism. Ultimately, our framework aims to improve critical reading and\nprotect the public from deceptive information online and enhance the overall\ncredibility of news media.",

    "abstract": "Core-collapse supernovae provide a unique opportunity to probe axions because\nthey can be a copious source of the particles. It has recently been proposed\nthat axion helioscopes can be used for the direct search for supernova axions\nif a supernova event appears within a few hundred parsecs. However, the event\nnumber of supernova axions has been estimated only within the post-process\nframework. In this study, we perform long-term supernova simulations for a\n9.6M_sun star coupled with the axion emission to reevaluate the event number of\naxions detected by the helioscopes. We find that the additional cooling induced\nby the axion emission can significantly decrease the temperature in the\nproto-neutron star. As a result, the axion luminosity and hence the axion event\nnumber are reduced, compared with the result obtained through post-processing.\nOur result indicates that the nonlinear feedback of the axion emission is an\nessential factor to predict the axion detectability, and underscores the need\nfor systematic simulation studies across various progenitor models.",

    "abstract": "Monte Carlo integration becomes prohibitively expensive when each sample\nrequires a high-fidelity model evaluation. Multi-fidelity uncertainty\nquantification methods mitigate this by combining estimators from high- and\nlow-fidelity models, preserving unbiasedness while reducing variance under a\nfixed budget. Constructing such estimators optimally requires the model-output\ncovariance matrix, typically estimated from pilot samples. Too few pilot\nsamples lead to inaccurate covariance estimates and suboptimal estimators,\nwhile too many consume budget that could be used for final estimation. We\npropose a Bayesian framework to quantify covariance uncertainty from pilot\nsamples, incorporating prior knowledge and enabling probabilistic assessments\nof estimator performance. A central component is a flexible $\\gamma$-Gaussian\nprior that ensures computational tractability and supports efficient posterior\nprojection under additional pilot samples. These tools enable adaptive\npilot-sampling termination via an interpretable loss criterion that decomposes\nvariance inefficiency into accuracy and cost components. While demonstrated\nhere in the context of approximate control variates (ACV), the framework\ngeneralizes to other multi-fidelity estimators. We validate the approach on a\nmonomial benchmark and a PDE-based Darcy flow problem. Across these tests, our\nadaptive method demonstrates its value for multi-fidelity estimation under\nlimited pilot budgets and expensive models, achieving variance reduction\ncomparable to baseline estimators with oracle covariance.",

    "abstract": "Objective: This work describes the topic modelling of Security Operations\nCentre (SOC) use of a large language model (LLM), during live security\noperations. The goal is to better understand how these specialists voluntarily\nuse this tool.\n  Background: Human-automation teams have been extensively studied, but\ntransformer-based language models have sparked a new wave of collaboration. SOC\npersonnel at a major cybersecurity provider used an LLM to support live\nsecurity operations. This study examines how these specialists incorporated the\nLLM into their work.\n  Method: Our data set is the result of 10 months of SOC operators accessing\nGPT-4 over an internally deployed HTTP-based chat application. We performed two\ntopic modelling exercises, first using the established BERTopic model\n(Grootendorst, 2022), and second, using a novel topic modeling workflow.\n  Results: Both the BERTopic analysis and novel modelling approach revealed\nthat SOC operators primarily used the LLM to facilitate their understanding of\ncomplex text strings. Variations on this use-case accounted for ~40% of SOC LLM\nusage.\n  Conclusion: SOC operators are required to rapidly interpret complex commands\nand similar information. Their natural tendency to leverage LLMs to support\nthis activity indicates that their workflow can be supported and augmented by\ndesigning collaborative LLM tools for use in the SOC.\n  Application: This work can aid in creating next-generation tools for Security\nOperations Centres. By understanding common use-cases, we can develop workflows\nsupporting SOC task flow. One example is a right-click context menu for\nexecuting a command line analysis LLM call directly in the SOC environment.",

The article contributes three elements: (1) a triadic analytical\nframework that specifies the minimum variables and instrumentation needed for\nstudy; (2) two crosswalks that map common objectives (persuade, disrupt, shape)\nand target classes (leaders, elites, publics) to political, computational, and\npsychological tactics, yielding practical coding heuristics and testable\nhypotheses; and (3) a McCumber-style cube for information influence that\nintegrates targets, operations, as well as machines (automation and AI) into a\nsingle space.

Ten\nparticipants performed two experiments on HoloLens 2. In Experiment 1, we\ncompared high-transparency vs. low-transparency target rendering in a depth\nmatching task at arm's length.

We collected data on depth matching error, target localization\nerror, system usability, task workload, and qualitative feedback. Results show\nthat a more opaque target yields significantly lower depth estimation error\nthan a highly transparent target at arm's distance. Moreover, showing the real\ntool (occluding the virtual target) led to the highest accuracy and usability\nwith the lowest workload, while not tracking the tool yielded the worst\nperformance and user ratings. However, making the target highly transparent,\nwhile allowing the real tool to remain visible, slightly impaired depth cues\nand did not improve usability. Our findings underscore that correct occlusion\ncues, rendering virtual content opaque and occluding it with real tools in real\ntime, are critical for depth perception and precision in OST-AR.

We conclude by outlining open challenges such as: developing\ncoupled e--ph solvers, solving the full mode-to-mode Peierls--Boltzmann\nequation with 4-particle terms, embedding correlated electron methods in e--ph\nworkflows, and leveraging higher-order e--ph coupling and symmetry breaking to\nrealise phononic thermal diodes and rectifiers. Solving these challenges will\nelevate e--ph theory from a diagnostic tool to a predictive, parameter-free\nplatform that links symmetry, screening, and many-body effects to heat and\ncharge transport in next-generation electronic, photonic, and thermoelectric\ndevices.",

Here we address this\nproblem numerically for monitored non-interacting fermions with $U(1)$\nsymmetry. The use of Graphic-Processing-Unit (GPU) techniques, even with\noutdated hardware, makes possible to reach much larger lattice sizes ($L =\n16384$ and $160\\times160$ in one (1d) and two (2d) dimensions respectively)\nthan in previous studies which enables us to characterize quantitatively the\nentanglement dynamics. In 1d, we show that in order to confirm the absence of a\nMIPT, for both projective and homodyne measurements, predicted by the NLSM it\nis necessary to reach $L \\sim 10000$. In 2d, also as predicted by the NLSM, we\nobserve for both protocols a MIPT at finite monitoring rate characterized by a\nscale invariant mutual information. The critical monitoring strength depends on\nthe protocol while the critical exponent $\\nu \\approx 1.3$ governing the\napproach to the MIPT is similar in both cases.

    "abstract": "Quantum mechanics has remained conceptually puzzling since its inception.\nWhile its mathematical formalism provides predictions of unparalleled accuracy,\nthe interpretative framework underpinning measurement and collapse has never\nbeen fully clarified. The Tlalpan Interpretation (QTI) proposes that the\nwavefunction collapse is not a primitive, axiomatic rule but an emergent\nphenomenon, a spontaneous breaking of time symmetry triggered by amplification\nand record creation. The novelty of QTI lies in its embedding of collapse\nwithin the conceptual language of critical phenomena in statistical physics.\nThe theory introduces measurable parameters (the amplification fraction, the\nrecord asymmetry, and the retrocausal coherence time) that serve as order\nparameters describing the quantum-classical transition. Collapse is thus\ncharacterized not as a mysterious fiat but as a phase transition, with\nthresholds and scaling laws analogous to magnetization in ferromagnets. This\nperspective allows the interpretation to retain microscopic time symmetry and\nspatial locality, while attributing quantum correlations and Bell-type\nviolations to retrocausal boundary constraints rather than instantaneous action\nat a distance. Collapse corresponds to the granularization of trajectories: the\nconversion of smooth, time-symmetric quantum evolution into discrete,\nirreversible records. Most importantly, QTI is testable. It predicts: (1) sharp\nthreshold-like disappearance of interference when amplification exceeds a\ncritical value, (2) anomalously fast decay of reversibility in chaotic optical\ncavities compared with regular ones, and (3) qualitatively new interference\nfringes in a time-symmetric generalization of Moshinsky's diffraction in time.\nIf confirmed, these predictions would place collapse squarely in the realm of\nthermodynamic processes, removing the last \"mystical\" postulate from quantum\ntheory.",

We first construct Veribench-53K, a high-quality dataset curated\nfrom over 700K Verilog problems, enriched with structured prompts, complexity\nlabels, and diverse testbenches. To tackle the problem of sparse and noisy\nreward signals, we propose a Trace-back based Rescore mechanism that leverages\nreasoning paths and iterative refinement to enhance feedback reliability and\nsupport reward model training. Furthermore, to mitigate catastrophic forgetting\nand overfitting during RL fine-tuning, we introduce a sample-balanced weighting\nstrategy that adaptively balances learning dynamics based on reward-probability\ndistributions. These innovations are integrated into an iterative RL pipeline\nthat co-evolves the policy and reward models. In contrast to recent work such\nas CraftRTL, which relies on large-scale closed-source model distillation, and\nDeepSeek-style approaches that struggle with sparse feedback, our method\ndemonstrates superior performance using a smaller but high-quality dataset\ncombined with RL optimization. Experiments on Verilog generation tasks\ndemonstrate state-of-the-art performance, with substantial gains in test pass\nrate, functional correctness, and compilation robustness. Our findings\nhighlight the potential of RL-driven approaches for structured code generation\nin hardware-centric domains. VERIRL is publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/omniAI-Lab/VeriRL.",

GJ 4334 flared during the observation, starting with a rise in the flux\nof optical chromospheric emission lines, followed by the rapid rise and decay\nof multiple far-ultraviolet emission lines formed in the transition region,\nfollowed by the slow decay of the optical lines. We find significant broadening\nand asymmetries in the optical emission lines that are potentially from bulk\nplasma motion, a post-flare elevated flux in both the optical and\nfar-ultraviolet, and trends in the rise and decay timescales of the Balmer\nseries such that higher-order lines rise earlier and decay faster than\nlower-order lines. The equivalent durations of the flare in individual lines\nrange from 800 -- 3e4 seconds, mapping to flare energies of 1e28 -- 3e29 erg\nfor each line. To contextualize GJ 4334's flare behavior we measure and compare\nits optical flare frequency distribution with TESS to EV Lacertae, a similar\nmass but faster rotating M dwarf, and find that GJ 4334 has an excess of large\nflares relative to the power-law established by the majority of its smaller\nflares.

We consider two distinct\nsettings: the geometric setting, in which the vertices are points embedded in\nthe plane and all occurring odd matchings are crossing-free, and a\ncombinatorial setting, in which we consider odd matchings in general graphs.\n  For the latter setting, we provide a complete polynomial time checkable\ncharacterization of graphs in which any two odd matchings can be reconfigured\ninto each another. This complements the previously known result that the flip\ngraph is always connected in the geometric setting [Aichholzer, Br\\\"otzner,\nPerz, and Schnider. Flips in odd matchings]. In the combinatorial setting, we\nprove that the diameter of the flip graph, if connected, is linear in the\nnumber of vertices. Furthermore, we establish that deciding whether there\nexists a flip sequence of length $k$ transforming one given matching into\nanother is NP-complete in both the combinatorial and the geometric settings. To\nprove the latter, we introduce a framework that allows us to transform partial\norder types into general position with only polynomial overhead.

These two H-band observations in\ncombination with a follow-up Ks-band observation were used to determine the\ncolour-magnitude of the co-moving companions and to derive their masses by\ncomparing to AMES-COND and AMES-DUSTY evolutionary tracks.

The framework mitigates cold-start\nlimitations via clustering-based risk labeling, incorporates Differential\nPrivacy (DP) to safeguard sensitive information, and employs Message\nAuthentication Codes (MACs) to ensure model integrity and authenticity.\nFederated updates are securely aggregated into a global model, achieving strong\nbalance between user privacy, scalability, and adaptive authentication\nrobustness. Rigorous game-based security proofs in the Random Oracle Model\nformally establish privacy, correctness, and adaptive security guarantees.\nExtensive experiments on keystroke, mouse, and contextual datasets validate\nFL-RBA2's effectiveness in high-risk user detection and its resilience to model\ninversion and inference attacks, even under strong DP constraints.",

In this work, we identify the\naxion with the position mode of a charged 3-brane in (4+1)-dimensions. The\nshift symmetry of the axion is then a residual diffeomorphism in the fifth\ndimension orthogonal to the brane. Meanwhile, the brane is coupled to a flux in\nthe fifth dimension. From the (3+1)-dimensional perspective, this construction\ngenerates a mass for the axion and matches previously known proposals in the\nliterature based on the coupling between the axion and a three-form gauge\nfield.

Moreover, in newly developed systems with limited user\nengagement and insufficient ranking data, accurately re-ranking content remains\na significant challenge. While various training methods affect the training of\nLLMs and generate inference, our analysis has found that some training methods\nexhibit better explainability than others, implying that an accurate semantic\nunderstanding has not been learned through all training methods; instead,\nabstract knowledge has been gained to optimize evaluation, which raises\nquestions about the true reliability of LLMs. Therefore, in this work, we\nanalyze how different training methods affect the semantic understanding of the\nre-ranking task in LLMs and investigate whether these models can generate more\ninformed textual reasoning to overcome the challenges of transparency or LLMs\nand limited training data. To analyze the LLMs for re-ranking tasks, we utilize\na relatively small ranking dataset from the environment and the Earth science\ndomain to re-rank retrieved content.

A dataset of 213 antibody-antigen complexes\nwas curated to extract geometric and physicochemical features, and a LightGBM\nregressor was trained to predict binding affinity with high precision. The\nmodel reduced the antibody candidate search space by 89%, and fine-tuning on\n117 SARS-CoV-2 binding pairs further reduced Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) from\n1.70 to 0.92. In the absence of an experimental structure for the hMPV A2.2\nvariant, AlphaFold2 was used to predict its 3D structure. The fine-tuned model\nidentified two optimal antibodies with predicted picomolar affinities targeting\nkey mutation sites (G42V and E96K), making them excellent candidates for\nexperimental testing.

    "abstract": "Active galactic nuclei (AGNs) often exhibit broad-line regions (BLRs),\npopulated by high-velocity clouds in Keplerian orbits around the central\nsupermassive black hole (SMBH) at subparsec scales. During episodes of intense\nsuper-Eddington accretion, the disk can launch a powerful radiation-driven wind\nthat overtakes the BLR clouds, forming bowshocks. Two shocks arise: one into\nthe wind and another into the cloud. If adiabatic, electrons and protons are\nefficiently accelerated via Fermi processes to relativistic energies. In dense\nwinds, the resulting high-energy photons are absorbed and reprocessed within\nthe photosphere, while neutrinos from inelastic $pp$ collisions escape. We\nexplore the potential of super-accreting AGNs as neutrino sources and propose a\nnew class of emitter: an AGN without jets or gamma-ray counterparts, but with a\nstrong opaque disk wind. As a case study, we consider a SMBH with $M_{\\rm\nBH}=10^6,M_{\\odot}$ and accretion rates consistent with tidal disruption events\n(TDEs). We compute the main cooling processes for relativistic particles and\nshow that super-Eddington SMBHs can produce detectable neutrino fluxes with\nonly weak electromagnetic signatures. Such fluxes may be observable by\nIceCube-Gen2 in nearby galaxies with a high BLR cloud filling factor. For more\nmassive black holes, detection remains possible with moderate filling factors\nif the source is close, or at larger distances if the filling factor is high.\nOur model thus provides a plausible scenario for extragalactic neutrino\nsources, where both flux and timescale are determined by the number of orbiting\nclouds and the duration of the super-accreting phase.",

We first prompt an LLM with instructions based on MITRE's CVE\nMapping Methodology to predict an initial list of techniques.

We\nalso find that GPT-4o-mini performs better than Llama3.3-70B on this task.\nOverall, our results show that LLMs can be used to automatically predict the\nimpact of cybersecurity vulnerabilities and TRIAGE makes the process of mapping\nCVEs to ATT&CK more efficient.\n  Keywords: vulnerability impact, CVE, ATT&CK techniques, large language\nmodels, automated mapping.",

    "abstract": "If dark matter (DM) exists in halos around rotating neutron stars (NSs), it\nwill be essential to understand the effects of rotation on the distribution of\nDM and baryonic matter (BM) in the stars to interpret observations. In this\nwork, we construct rapidly rotating dark matter admixed neutron stars (DANS)\nwith DM halos using the two-fluid approximation, where the BM and DM interact\nonly through gravity. Our goal is to describe rapidly rotating\nmillisecond-period DANS spun up by the accretion of BM from a zero angular\nmomentum state. We extend the Rapidly Rotating Neutron Star (RNS) code to\ncompute axisymmetric configurations in which the BM rotates rigidly while the\nDM remains torque-free and differentially rotates through the frame-dragging of\nspacetime. For the first time, we examine in detail local and global\ndefinitions of mass in general relativity for two-fluid systems, showing how\ntheir differences affect the interpretation of baryonic and dark component\nmasses. We compute energy density and frame-dragging frequency profiles for\nDANS with three different characteristic DM halos. We demonstrate that rapid BM\nrotation reduces DM halo sizes if central energy densities are kept constant\nbetween non-rotating and rotating models. We also construct sequences of DANS\nto create mass and radius curves and compare rotating and non-rotating cases.\nFinally, we quantify deviations in the spacetime metric outside the baryonic\nsurfaces of these sequences of stars caused by the DM halos. We hypothesize\nthat the size of this quantity could indicate whether a DM halo will\nsignificantly impact X-ray pulse profile modeling. These results provide a\nframework for assessing the observational consequences of DM halos around\nrapidly rotating NSs.",

To address these challenges, we introduce CLARIFY, a\nSpecialist-Generalist framework for dermatological visual question answering\n(VQA). CLARIFY combines two components: (i) a lightweight, domain-trained image\nclassifier (the Specialist) that provides fast and highly accurate diagnostic\npredictions, and (ii) a powerful yet compressed conversational VLM (the\nGeneralist) that generates natural language explanations to user queries. In\nour framework, the Specialist's predictions directly guide the Generalist's\nreasoning, focusing it on the correct diagnostic path. This synergy is further\nenhanced by a knowledge graph-based retrieval module, which grounds the\nGeneralist's responses in factual dermatological knowledge, ensuring both\naccuracy and reliability. This hierarchical design not only reduces diagnostic\nerrors but also significantly improves computational efficiency. Experiments on\nour curated multimodal dermatology dataset demonstrate that CLARIFY achieves an\n18\\% improvement in diagnostic accuracy over the strongest baseline, a\nfine-tuned, uncompressed single-line VLM, while reducing the average VRAM\nrequirement and latency by at least 20\\% and 5\\%, respectively.

The sense of the community has\nbeen that, given a prospective metal hydride and pressure, the energy landscape\ncan be surveyed computationally for thermodynamic and dynamic stability, the\nEliashberg spectral function with its required input (energy bands, phonon\nmodes, coupling matrix elements) can be calculated, and the critical\ntemperature T$_c$ obtained.

This paper\nprovides a concise overview of related formal developments occurring\nsporadically over several decades that, when implemented, could resolve the\nquestion of {\\it why hydrogen, why so high T$_c$.} The dearth of success of\nnumerous high throughput searches proposing higher T$_c$ materials, especially\nhydrides, is touched on briefly.

    "abstract": "We investigate a theory of time-symmetric action-at-a-distance electrodynamic\nor gravitational interactions where the four-forces depend only on the electric\ncharges, the rest masses, the position four-vectors, and the four-velocities of\nthe two interacting particles, but not on their four-accelerations or higher\nderivatives. The goal is to prove that the principle of action and reaction is\nobeyed due to the fact that, for a given pair of corresponding infinitesimal\nsegments along the worldlines of the two particles, the impulse of the advanced\nfour-force and the impulse of the retarded four-force are equal in magnitude\nbut opposite in direction. For two particles at relative rest, we derive this\nresult as the outcome of a symmetry operation in flat conformal space. We start\nby assuming a positive spacetime interval between the two interacting\nparticles, and we perform a conformal inversion (an improper inversion in a\nhypersphere), after which the two particles exchange their position and time\ncoordinates and their rest masses. Then we perform an improper reflection\nacross the axis connecting the two particles, after which the two particles\nrecover their initial four-velocities, up to a minus sign. Two improper\ncoordinate transformations are needed together in order to obtain a resulting\npositive Jacobian determinant. In the final step we go to the limit of a null\nspacetime interval between the endpoints of the corresponding infinitesimal\nsegments. When the two interacting particles are at rest, or move with the same\nvelocity, the initial and the final physical parameters that determine the\nfour-forces are identical. Due to symmetry, the principle of action and\nreaction emerges. We make the conjecture that another, undetermined yet,\nsymmetry operation must also apply, in order for the principle of action and\nreaction to hold even for particles moving with different velocities.",

However, the\nunderlying mechanisms of pattern formation remain incompletely understood. In\nthis work, we present a detailed derivation and analysis of a quantitative\nphase-field model for simulating this nonequilibrium process. The phase-field\nmodel extends the thin-interface formulation of dilute binary alloy\nsolidification with anti-trapping to incorporate the highly anisotropic\nenergetic and kinetic properties of the partially faceted ice-water interface.\nThis interface is faceted in the basal plane normal to the <0001> directions\nand atomically rough in other directions within the basal plane. On the basal\nplane, the model reproduces a linear or nonlinear kinetic relationship that can\nbe linked to experimental measurements. In both cases, spontaneous parity\nbreaking of the solidification front is observed, leading to the formation of\npartially faceted ice lamellae that drift laterally in one of the <0001>\ndirections. We demonstrate that the drifting velocity is controlled by the\nkinetics on the basal plane and converges as the thickness of the diffuse\nsolid-liquid interface decreases. Furthermore, we examine the effect of the\nform of the kinetic anisotropy, which is chosen here such that the inverse of\nthe kinetic coefficient varies linearly from a finite value in the <0001>\ndirections to zero in all other directions within the basal plane. Our results\nindicate that the drifting velocity of ice lamellae is not affected by the\nslope of this linear relation, and the radius and undercooling at the tip of an\nice lamella converge at relatively small slope values. Consequently, the\nphase-field simulations remain quantitative with computationally tractable\nchoices of both the interface thickness and the slope assumed in the form of\nthe kinetic anisotropy.",

To do this, we build on recent methods for\nparallel evaluation of nonlinear recursions that formulate the state sequence\nas a solution to a fixed-point problem and solve for the fixed-point using a\nparallel form of Newton's method. We show how this approach can be used to\nparallelize Gibbs, Metropolis-adjusted Langevin, and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo\nsampling across the sequence length. In several examples, we demonstrate the\nsimulation of up to hundreds of thousands of MCMC samples with only tens of\nparallel Newton iterations.

Such studies are expected to reveal properties of\nthe quark-gluon plasma produced in these collisions. Global spin alignment of\nvector mesons, such as the $\\phi$-meson, can be measured by the $00^{\\rm th}$\ncoefficient of the spin density matrix, $\\rho_{00}$, via the polar angle of the\ndecay kaon momentum in the parent rest frame with respect to the OAM direction\nof the collision. A deviation of $\\rho_{00}$ from the isotropic value of $1/3$\nindicates a finite spin alignment. The reported signal of $\\rho_{00}-1/3$ is on\nthe order of $\\sim 1\\%$ and therefore corrections for finite detector\nperformance and acceptance, which are expected to be on the order of a few\ntenths of a percent, are important. Additional complications in the detector\ncorrections may arise from the $\\phi$-meson azimuthal anisotropy which could\nbecome intertwined with the detector efficiency. Typically, detector\ncorrections for global spin alignment of vector mesons are performed with\nMonte-Carlo (MC) methods using detector simulation packages such as GEANT,\nhowever it is unclear if such methods can be trusted at the needed level of\nprecision.

In response, educational efforts have\nincreasingly embraced artificial-intelligence (AI)-powered digital learning\nenvironments, ranging from educational apps and virtual labs to serious games.\nRecent advances in large language models (LLMs) and neuro-symbolic systems,\nmeanwhile, offer a transformative opportunity to reimagine how support is\ndelivered in digital learning environments. LLMs are enabling socially\ninteractive learning experiences and scalable, cross-domain learning support\nthat can adapt instructional strategies across varied subjects and contexts. In\nparallel, neuro-symbolic AI provides new avenues for designing these agents\nthat are not only adaptive but also scalable across domains. Based on these\nremarks, this paper presents a multi-agent, neuro-symbolic framework designed\nto resolve the aforementioned challenges. The framework assigns distinct\npedagogical roles to specialized agents: an RL-based 'tutor' agent provides\nauthoritative, non-verbal scaffolding, while a proactive, LLM-powered 'peer'\nagent facilitates the social dimensions of learning. While prior work has\nexplored such agents in isolation, our framework's novelty lies in unifying\nthem through a central educational ontology.

This\npaper uses SWMF and OpenGGCM simulations to estimate the magnitudes of the\n$\\boldsymbol{\\nabla} \\boldsymbol{\\cdot} \\mathbf{B}$ and outer boundary\nintegrals compared to Biot-Savart estimates of the magnetic field on Earth. In\nthe simulations considered, the $\\boldsymbol{\\nabla} \\boldsymbol{\\cdot}\n\\mathbf{B}$ and outer surface integrals are up to 30 percent of Biot-Savart\nestimates when the Biot-Savart estimates are large. These integrals are\nlargest, relative to Biot-Savart magnetospheric contributions, when the\nBiot-Savart estimates are small. The integrals are correlated; locations on the\nEarth's surface near one another have integrals of similar magnitudes. The\nconclusions are the same for a simulation involving a simple change in the\ninterplanetary magnetic field and a more complex superstorm simulation.",

Compared to the most recent fixations, the impact of the\nlonger path history is more difficult to quantify. Using the step-selection\nframework commonly used in movement ecology, and analyzing data from 45-second\nviewings of \"Where's Waldo\"?, we report a new memory-dependent effect that also\nvaries significantly between individuals, which we term self-crossing\navoidance. This is a tendency for saccades to avoid crossing those earlier in\nthe scan path, and is most evident when both have small amplitudes. We show\nthis by comparing real data to synthetic data generated from a memoryless\napproximation of the spatial statistics (i.e. a Markovian nonparametric model\nwith a matching distribution of saccade lengths over time). Maximum likelihood\nfitting indicates that this effect is strongest when including the last\n$\\approx 7$ seconds of a scan path. The effect size is comparable to well-known\nforms of history dependence such as inhibition of return. A parametric\nprobabilistic model including a self-crossing penalty term was able to\nreproduce joint statistics of saccade lengths and self-crossings. We also\nquantified individual strategic differences, and their consistency over the six\nimages viewed per participant, using mixed-effect regressions. Participants\nwith a higher tendency to avoid crossings displayed smaller saccade lengths and\nshorter fixation durations on average, but did not display more horizontal,\nvertical, forward or reverse saccades. Together, these results indicate that\nthe avoidance of crossings is a local orienting strategy that facilitates and\ncomplements inhibition of return, and hence exploration of visual scenes.",

    "abstract": "Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) presents a promising paradigm for\ntraining autonomous vehicle (AV) planning policies from large-scale, real-world\ndriving logs. However, the extreme data imbalance in these logs, where mundane\nscenarios vastly outnumber rare \"long-tail\" events, leads to brittle and unsafe\npolicies when using standard uniform data sampling. In this work, we address\nthis challenge through a systematic, large-scale comparative study of data\ncuration strategies designed to focus the learning process on information-rich\nsamples. We investigate six distinct criticality weighting schemes which are\ncategorized into three families: heuristic-based, uncertainty-based, and\nbehavior-based. These are evaluated at two temporal scales, the individual\ntimestep and the complete scenario. We train seven goal-conditioned\nConservative Q-Learning (CQL) agents with a state-of-the-art, attention-based\narchitecture and evaluate them in the high-fidelity Waymax simulator. Our\nresults demonstrate that all data curation methods significantly outperform the\nbaseline. Notably, data-driven curation using model uncertainty as a signal\nachieves the most significant safety improvements, reducing the collision rate\nby nearly three-fold (from 16.0% to 5.5%). Furthermore, we identify a clear\ntrade-off where timestep-level weighting excels at reactive safety while\nscenario-level weighting improves long-horizon planning. Our work provides a\ncomprehensive framework for data curation in Offline RL and underscores that\nintelligent, non-uniform sampling is a critical component for building safe and\nreliable autonomous agents.",

    "abstract": "We present FastAvatar, a pose-invariant, feed-forward framework that can\ngenerate a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) model from a single face image from an\narbitrary pose in near-instant time (<10ms). FastAvatar uses a novel\nencoder-decoder neural network design to achieve both fast fitting and identity\npreservation regardless of input pose. First, FastAvatar constructs a 3DGS face\n``template'' model from a training dataset of faces with multi-view captures.\nSecond, FastAvatar encodes the input face image into an identity-specific and\npose-invariant latent embedding, and decodes this embedding to predict\nresiduals to the structural and appearance parameters of each Gaussian in the\ntemplate 3DGS model. By only inferring residuals in a feed-forward fashion,\nmodel inference is fast and robust. FastAvatar significantly outperforms\nexisting feed-forward face 3DGS methods (e.g., GAGAvatar) in reconstruction\nquality, and runs 1000x faster than per-face optimization methods (e.g.,\nFlashAvatar, GaussianAvatars and GASP). In addition, FastAvatar's novel latent\nspace design supports real-time identity interpolation and attribute editing\nwhich is not possible with any existing feed-forward 3DGS face generation\nframework. FastAvatar's combination of excellent reconstruction quality and\nspeed expands the scope of 3DGS for photorealistic avatar applications in\nconsumer and interactive systems.",

    "abstract": "High-Level Synthesis (HLS) is increasingly popular for hardware design using\nC/C++ instead of Register-Transfer Level (RTL). To express concurrent hardware\nbehavior in a sequential language like C/C++, HLS tools introduce constructs\nsuch as infinite loops and dataflow modules connected by FIFOs. However,\nefficiently and accurately simulating these constructs at C level remains\nchallenging. First, without hardware timing information, functional\nverification typically requires slow RTL synthesis and simulation, as the\ncurrent approaches in commercial HLS tools. Second, cycle-accurate performance\nmetrics, such as end-to-end latency, also rely on RTL simulation. No existing\nHLS tool fully overcomes the first limitation. For the second, prior work such\nas LightningSim partially improves simulation speed but lacks support for\nadvanced dataflow features like cyclic dependencies and non-blocking FIFO\naccesses.\n  To overcome both limitations, we propose OmniSim, a framework that\nsignificantly extends the simulation capabilities of both academic and\ncommercial HLS tools. First, OmniSim enables fast and accurate simulation of\ncomplex dataflow designs, especially those explicitly declared unsupported by\ncommercial tools. It does so through sophisticated software multi-threading,\nwhere threads are orchestrated by querying and updating a set of FIFO tables\nthat explicitly record exact hardware timing of each FIFO access. Second,\nOmniSim achieves near-C simulation speed with near-RTL accuracy for both\nfunctionality and performance, via flexibly coupled and overlapped\nfunctionality and performance simulations.\n  We demonstrate that OmniSim successfully simulates eleven designs previously\nunsupported by any HLS tool, achieving up to 35.9x speedup over traditional\nC/RTL co-simulation, and up to 6.61x speedup over the state-of-the-art yet less\ncapable simulator, LightningSim, on its own benchmark suite.",

Starting from the\nBorn-Markov master equation, and combining the spin Hamiltonian eigenoperator\nformalism with a linear expansion in statistical coefficients, as the only\nassumption, we obtain a quantum dissipator that generalizes the\nAbragam-Redfield-Hubbard inhomogeneous master equation (ARH-IME). Our\nderivation naturally incorporates an additional term for non-thermal,\nhigh-order initial states, while reducing to ARH-IME for spin states evolving\nnear thermal equilibrium (weak-order). Through an alternative operator-based\nderivation of the HTME, we confirm these results and reveal a symmetrization\ncondition for the spectral densities in the linear thermal regime. We\nrigorously analyze the internal consistency of both approaches and compare them\nwith prior literature. To illustrate these findings, we study: (i) A canonical\nspin-1/2 system interacting with a bosonic bath, demonstrating first-principles\nsymmetrization of spectral densities at high temperatures. (ii) Singlet-triplet\nconversion in a correlated two-spin system, where the ARH-IME fails, exposing\nthe limitations of the weak-order hypothesis in strongly correlated regimes.\nOur results challenge the traditional boundaries of NMR spin-lattice relaxation\ntheory and provide a refined framework for modeling open quantum systems beyond\nweak order.",

    "abstract": "Online Set Cover and Load Balancing are central problems in online\noptimization, and there is a long line of work on developing algorithms for\nthese problems with convex objectives. Although we know optimal online\nalgorithms with $\\ell_p$-norm objectives, recent developments for general norms\nand convex objectives that rely on the online primal-dual framework apply only\nto fractional settings due to large integrality gaps.\n  Our work focuses on directly designing integral online algorithms for Set\nCover and Load Balancing with convex objectives, bypassing the\nconvex-relaxation and the primal-dual technique. Some of the main implications\nare:\n  1. For Online Set Cover, we can extend the results of Azar et. al. (2016) for\nconvex objectives and of Kesselheim, Molinaro, and Singla (2024) for symmetric\nnorms from fractional to integral settings.\n  2. Our results for convex objectives and symmetric norms even apply to the\nonline generalized scheduling problem, which generalizes both Set Cover and\nLoad Balancing. Previous works could only handle the offline version of this\nproblem with norm objectives (Deng, Li, and Rabani 2023).\n  3. Our methods easily extend to settings with disjoint-composition of norms.\nThis allows us to recover or improve the norm-composition results of Nagarajan\nand Shen (2020), and Kesselheim, Molinaro, and Singla (2024), and to extend our\nresults to a large class of norms beyond symmetric.\n  Our approach is to first reduce these problems to online packing problems,\nand then to design good approximation algorithms for the latter. To solve these\npacking problems, we use two key ideas. First, we decouple the global packing\nproblem into a series of local packing problems on different machines. Next, we\nchoose random activation thresholds for machines such that conditional on a\nmachine being activated, the expected number of jobs it covers is high compared\nto its cost.",

    "abstract": "Mixture of Experts (MoE) has become a mainstream architecture for building\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) by reducing per-token computation while enabling\nmodel scaling. It can be viewed as partitioning a large Feed-Forward Network\n(FFN) at the tensor level into fine-grained sub-FFNs, or experts, and\nactivating only a sparse subset for each input. While this sparsity improves\nefficiency, MoE still faces substantial challenges due to their massive\ncomputational scale and unpredictable activation patterns.\n  To enable efficient MoE deployment, we identify dual sparsity at the tensor\nand neuron levels in pre-trained MoE modules as a key factor for both accuracy\nand efficiency. Unlike prior work that increases tensor-level sparsity through\nfiner-grained expert design during pre-training, we introduce post-training\nexpert partitioning to induce such sparsity without retraining. This preserves\nthe mathematical consistency of model transformations and enhances both\nefficiency and accuracy in subsequent fine-tuning and inference. Building upon\nthis, we propose DualSparse-MoE, an inference system that integrates dynamic\ntensor-level computation dropping with static neuron-level reconstruction to\ndeliver significant efficiency gains with minimal accuracy loss.\n  Experimental results show that enforcing an approximate 25% drop rate with\nour approach reduces average accuracy by only 0.08%-0.28% across three\nprevailing MoE models, while nearly all degrees of computation dropping\nconsistently yield proportional computational speedups. Furthermore,\nincorporating load-imbalance awareness into expert parallelism achieves a 1.41x\nMoE module speedup with just 0.5% average accuracy degradation.",

We show\nthat these covering problems are NP-hard in most cases and give heuristic\nalgorithms for finding trail covers in graphs including a reduction to the\ntravelling salesman problem. We propose new rewrite strategies for graph states\nthat reduce the number of fusions required to build a given graph.

This central brightening is linked to a\nphenomenon we refer to as the DTM cavity, a localized depression in the DTM\nratio driven by intense bulge starbursts.

However, most reconstructions, both for the Milky Way and for\nexternal galaxies, implicitly assume that stars formed at their present-day\nradii. Using a range of zoom-in cosmological simulations, we show that stellar\nradial migration introduces strong and systematic biases in such SFH estimates.\nIn the inner disk (R < h_d), early star formation is typically underestimated\nby 25-50% and late star formation overestimated, giving the misleading\nimpression of prolonged, moderate activity. An exception occurs in the very\ncentral bin considered (~ 0.4h_d), which is consistently overestimated due to a\nnet inflow of inward migrators. At intermediate radii and in the outer disk,\nmigration drives the opposite trend: intermediate-age populations are\noverestimated by 100-200% as stars born in the inner disk migrate outward,\nwhereas genuinely in-situ populations are underestimated by ~ 50% as they\nthemselves continue to migrate. The net effect is that SFH peaks are suppressed\nand broadened, and the true rate of inside-out disk growth is systematically\nunderestimated. These distortions affect all galaxies in our sample and have\ndirect implications for interpreting spatially resolved SFHs from IFU surveys\nsuch as CALIFA and MaNGA, where present-day radii are often used as proxies for\nstellar birth sites. Correcting these biases will require accounting for disk\nmass, bar presence, disk kinematics and morphology, while recent birth-radius\nestimation techniques for Milky Way stars offer a promising path forward.",

We find that incorporating ionization from\nhigh-energy electrons produces an ``inverted\" and ``blended\" ionization\nstructure, where the most highly ionized species are located in the fastest\nmoving homologous ejecta and multiple ionization states coexist. In radiation\ntransport calculations, the higher degree of ionization reduces line blanketing\nin optical bands, leading to improved agreement with the light curve properties\nof AT\\,2017gfo such as the duration, decay rates, brightness, and colors. Our\nquasi-NLTE implementation helps to alleviate tensions in kilonova modeling: for\nhigh-velocity ($\\sim 0.3c$) ejecta components our models require less mass for\na given peak brightness in optical bands, by as much as a factor of 3; our\nmodels can explain the presence of observed features associated to Sr II, W\nIII, Se III, and Te III under conditions where LTE models would predict only\nneutral species; and we naturally predict the coexistence of species like Sr II\nand Ce III without the need for fine-tuning of the ejecta properties.",

    "abstract": "Van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures offer a tunable platform for the\nrealization of emergent phenomena in layered electron systems. While scanning\nprobe microscopy techniques have proven useful for the characterization of\nsurface states and 2D crystals, the subsurface imaging of quantum phenomena in\nmulti-layer systems presents a significant challenge. In 3D heterostructures,\nstates that occupy different planes can simultaneously contribute to the signal\ndetected by the microscope probe, which complicates image analysis and\ninterpretation. Here we present a quantum imaging technique that offers a\nglimpse into the third dimension by resolving states out of plane: it extracts\nthe charge density landscape of individual atomic planes inside a vdW\nheterostructure, layer by layer. As a proof-of-concept, we perform\nlayer-resolved imaging of quantum Hall states and charge disorder in\ndouble-layer graphene using milliKelvin microwave impedance microscopy. Here\nthe discrete energy spectrum of the top layer enables transmission of\nmicrowaves through gapped states, thus opening direct access to quantum phases\nin the subsurface layer. Resolving how charge is distributed out-of-plane\noffers a direct probe of interlayer screening, revealing signatures of negative\nquantum capacitance driven by many-body correlations. At the same time, we\nextract key features of the band structure and thermodynamics, including gap\nsizes. Notably, by imaging the charge distribution on different atomic planes\nbeneath the surface, we shed light on the roles of surface impurities and\nscreening on the stability of fractional quantum Hall states. We also show that\nthe uppermost graphene layer can serve as a top gate: This unlocks access to a\nwide range of phenomena that require displacement field control, from\nfractional Chern insulators in Moir\\'e superlattices to correlated states in\nmultilayer graphene.",

Our analysis first reveals a tension\nbetween the ionizing properties implied from H$\\alpha$ and HeII$\\,\\lambda$4686.\nThe high H$\\alpha$ EWs require copious H-ionizing photons, more than the bluest\nAGN ionizing spectra can provide.

We extend our analysis to dense\ngas environments (the ``black-hole star'' hypothesis), and find that hydrogen\nrecombination lines become optically thick and lose diagnostic power, but HeII\nremains optically thin and a robust tracer. Photoionization modeling with\nCloudy rules out standard AGN accretion disk spectra. Alternative explanations\ninclude: exotic AGN with red rest-optical emission; a very high {\\it average}\noptical depth ($>10$) from gas/dust; and/or soft ionizing spectra with abundant\nH-ionizing photons, consistent with e.g., a cold accretion disk or a composite\nof AGN and stars.

Generally, tidal dissipation is\nparameterized by the modified stellar tidal quality factor, or $Q_{*}^{'}$, but\nthe lack of observational evidence of orbital decay to confirm dissipation\ntheories has resulted in orders of magnitude of uncertainty in $Q_{*}^{'}$. We\npresent a new transit timing analysis of 54 systems with varying stellar\nevolutionary states in an attempt to search for orbital decay across multiple\nstages of stellar evolution. For each system, we obtained mid-transit times\nfrom new TESS data and evaluated potential departures from a linear ephemeris\nusing the Bayesian Information Criterion. We then determined tidal quality\nfactors using widely tested theoretical relations. Of the systems studied, 25\nshowed evidence of a decrease in orbital period over time and 8 showed evidence\nof a decrease that was inconsistent with 0 by three standard deviations:\nCoRoT-2, TrES-5, WASP-4, WASP-12, WASP-19, WASP-45, WASP-99, and XO-3.

Similarly, we see that the lower limit on\n$Q_{*}^{'}$ for evolved systems is marginally lower than it is for the sample\nof all systems, though both limits are orders of magnitude below the expected\ntheoretical values for both samples. These new constraints on transit times and\n$Q_{*}^{'}$ values will help to narrow the search for orbital decay in the\nfuture and place important constraints on current theories of star-planet\ninteractions.",

However,\nthese effects may be enhanced or suppressed by cuts in realistic experimental\nanalyses, and so we also consider two representative examples, including\ncurrent FASER analyses and possible future searches at SHiP. We find that the\neffects of spin correlations are negligible for existing FASER analyses, but\ncan significantly reduce event rates at upcoming SHiP searches.",

    "abstract": "The representation theory of de Sitter space admits partially massless (PM)\nparticles, but whether such particles can participate in consistent interacting\ntheories remains unclear. We investigate the consistency of theories containing\nPM fields, particularly when these fields are coupled to gravity. Our strategy\nexploits the fact that PM fields correspond to partially conserved currents on\nthe spacetime boundary, which generate symmetries. These symmetries place\nstringent constraints on correlation functions of charged operators, allowing\nus to test the consistency of a proposed bulk spectrum. When the assumed\noperator content violates these constraints, the corresponding bulk theory is\nruled out. Applying this framework, we show that, in four-dimensional de Sitter\nspace, PM fields of spin 2 or 3 (at depth 0) cannot couple consistently to\ngravity: such couplings necessitate additional massive fields, which are\ninevitably non-unitary. In higher dimensions, however, the constraints can be\nsatisfied without violating unitarity if further PM fields are included. The\nresulting structure leads to additional charge conservation laws, which\nsuggests that consistency may ultimately require an infinite tower of\nhigher-spin PM fields, akin to the situation for ordinary higher-spin\nsymmetries. The methods developed here provide powerful constraints on possible\nlong-range interactions in de Sitter space and delineate the landscape of\nconsistent quantum field theories in cosmological spacetimes.",

This was\ndone by combining three tools: (i) the identification of a radio excess, (ii)\nthe BPT diagram, and (iii) a modified Mass Excitation diagram, alongside Monte\nCarlo methods to estimate the probability that each source is either a\nstar-forming galaxy (SFG), a radio-quiet AGN (RQ AGN), or a\nhigh-\\low-excitation radio galaxy (HERG or LERG). This approach extends the\nprobabilistic classification framework of previous works by nearly doubling the\nredshift range, such that we can now probabilistically classify sources over\nthe latter half of cosmic history. Often regarded as the 'gold standard'\nmethod, spectroscopic classifications allow us to evaluate the performance of\nother methods. Using a 90 per cent reliability threshold, we find reasonable\noverall agreement (~77 per cent) with state-of-the-art photometric\nclassifications, but significant differences remain, including that we identify\n2-5 times more RQ AGN.

Yet,\nleptohadronic models face challenges in describing neutrino emission within a\nviable energy budget, and their predictive power is limited by the commonly\nused single-zone approximation and the reliance on phenomenological parameters.\nIn this work, we present a new leptohadronic model where a sub-Eddington jet\nevolves from magnetically- to kinetically dominated. A small fraction of the\nelectrons and protons picked up by the jet are continuously accelerated to a\npower-law spectrum, estimated based on the local magnetic field strength,\nturbulence, and ambient density, for which we assume power-law profiles. The\nmodel parameters are thus directly tied to the jet physics and are comparable\nin number to typical single-zone models. We then numerically calculate the\nemission along the jet. Applying the model to the IceCube candidate TXS\n0506+056, we find that protons are accelerated to EeV energies in the inner\njet, producing a neutrino flux up to order 100 PeV that is consistent with the\npublic 10 year IceCube point-source data. Proton emission at 0.1 pc describes\nthe X-ray and gamma-ray data, while electron emission at the parsec scale\ndescribes the optical data. Protons carry a power of about 1% of the Eddington\nluminosity, showing that the model is energetically viable. The particle\nspectra follow $E^{-1.8}$, with diffusion scaling as $E^{0.3}$, ruling out\nBohm-like diffusion. Additional particle injection near the broad line region\ncan reproduce the 2017 flare associated to a high-energy neutrino.

    "abstract": "Many Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are built upon an internal world\nmodel trained via direct next-frame prediction ($v_t \\rightarrow v_{t+1}$).\nThis paradigm, however, presents a fundamental challenge: it \\textbf{conflates}\nthe task of predicting physical motion with that of rendering static\nappearance, forcing a single mechanism to handle both. This inherent coupling\noften leads to physically implausible forecasts and inefficient policy\nlearning. To address this limitation, we introduce the \\textbf{Visual Chain of\nThought (Visual CoT)}, a framework that disentangles these processes by\ncompelling the model to first reason about \\textbf{motion dynamics} before\ngenerating the future frame's \\textbf{visual appearance}. We instantiate this\nprinciple by proposing \\textbf{FlowVLA}, an autoregressive Transformer that\nexplicitly materializes this reasoning process as ``$v_t \\rightarrow f_t\n\\rightarrow v_{t+1}$'', where $f_t$ is an intermediate optical flow prediction.\nBy forcing the model to first commit to a motion plan ($f_t$), FlowVLA learns\ndisentangled dynamics, resulting in more coherent visual predictions and\nsignificantly more efficient policy learning. Experiments on challenging\nrobotics manipulation benchmarks demonstrate that FlowVLA achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance with substantially improved sample efficiency,\npointing toward a more principled foundation for world modeling in VLAs.\nProject page: https://irpn-lab.github.io/FlowVLA/",

    "abstract": "Bimanual manipulation has been widely applied in household services and\nmanufacturing, which enables the complex task completion with coordination\nrequirements. Recent diffusion-based policy learning approaches have achieved\npromising performance in modeling action distributions for bimanual\nmanipulation. However, they ignored the physical safety constraints of bimanual\nmanipulation, which leads to the dangerous behaviors with damage to robots and\nobjects. To this end, we propose a test-time trajectory optimization framework\nnamed SafeBimanual for any pre-trained diffusion-based bimanual manipulation\npolicies, which imposes the safety constraints on bimanual actions to avoid\ndangerous robot behaviors with improved success rate. Specifically, we design\ndiverse cost functions for safety constraints in different dual-arm cooperation\npatterns including avoidance of tearing objects and collision between arms and\nobjects, which optimizes the manipulator trajectories with guided sampling of\ndiffusion denoising process. Moreover, we employ a vision-language model (VLM)\nto schedule the cost functions by specifying keypoints and corresponding\npairwise relationship, so that the optimal safety constraint is dynamically\ngenerated in the entire bimanual manipulation process. SafeBimanual\ndemonstrates superiority on 8 simulated tasks in RoboTwin with a 13.7% increase\nin success rate and a 18.8% reduction in unsafe interactions over\nstate-of-the-art diffusion-based methods.

    "abstract": "Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate impressive performance in\nunderstanding visual content with language instruction by converting visual\ninput to vision tokens. However, redundancy in vision tokens results in the\ndegenerated inference efficiency of VLMs. While many algorithms have been\nproposed to reduce the number of vision tokens, most of them apply only\nunimodal information (i.e., vision/text) for pruning and ignore the inherent\nmultimodal property of vision-language tasks. Moreover, it lacks a generic\ncriterion that can be applied to different modalities. To mitigate this\nlimitation, in this work, we propose to leverage both vision and text tokens to\nselect informative vision tokens by the criterion of coverage. We first\nformulate the subset selection problem as a maximum coverage problem.\nAfterward, a subset of vision tokens is optimized to cover the text tokens and\nthe original set of vision tokens, simultaneously. Finally, a VLM agent can be\nadopted to further improve the quality of text tokens for guiding vision\npruning. The proposed method MMTok is extensively evaluated on benchmark\ndatasets with different VLMs. The comparison illustrates that vision and text\ninformation are complementary, and combining multimodal information can surpass\nthe unimodal baseline with a clear margin. Moreover, under the maximum coverage\ncriterion on the POPE dataset, our method achieves a 1.87x speedup while\nmaintaining 98.7% of the original performance on LLaVA-NeXT-13B. Furthermore,\nwith only four vision tokens, it still preserves 87.7% of the original\nperformance on LLaVA-1.5-7B. These results highlight the effectiveness of\ncoverage in token selection.",

We\nextract the eclipse spectrum of WASP-121b with two independent data reduction\npipelines and analyse it using different atmospheric retrieval prescriptions to\nexplore the effects of thermal dissociation, reflected light, and titanium\ncondensation on the inferred atmospheric properties. We find that the observed\ndayside spectrum of WASP-121b is best fit by atmosphere models possessing a\nstratospheric inversion with temperatures reaching over 3000K, with spectral\ncontributions from H2O, CO, VO, H-, and either TiO or reflected light. We\nmeasure the atmosphere of WASP-121b to be metal enriched (~10x stellar) but\ncomparatively titanium poor (~1x stellar), potentially due to partial\ncold-trapping. The inferred C/O depends on model assumptions such as whether\nreflected light is included, ranging from being consistent with stellar if a\ngeometric albedo of zero is assumed to being super-stellar for a freely fitted\nAg = 0.16 +/- 0.02. The volatile-to-refractory ratio is measured to be\nconsistent with the stellar value. We infer that WASP-121b has an atmosphere\nenriched in both volatile and refractory metals, but not in ultra-refractory\ntitanium, suggesting the presence of a nightside cold-trap.

Current approaches like search-o1\nintegrate retrieval augmented generation (RAG) into multi-step reasoning\nprocesses but rely on a single, linear reasoning chain while incorporating\nunstructured textual information in a flat, context-agnostic manner. As a\nresult, these approaches can lead to error accumulation throughout the\nreasoning chain, which significantly limits its effectiveness in medical\nquestion-answering (QA) tasks where both accuracy and traceability are critical\nrequirements. To address these challenges, we propose MIRAGE (Multi-chain\nInference with Retrieval-Augmented Graph Exploration), a novel test-time\nscalable reasoning framework that performs dynamic multi-chain inference over\nstructured medical knowledge graphs. Specifically, MIRAGE 1) decomposes complex\nqueries into entity-grounded sub-questions, 2) executes parallel inference\nchains, 3) retrieves evidence adaptively via neighbor expansion and multi-hop\ntraversal, and 4) integrates answers using cross-chain verification to resolve\ncontradictions. Experiments on three medical QA benchmarks (GenMedGPT-5k,\nCMCQA, and ExplainCPE) show that MIRAGE consistently outperforms GPT-4o,\nTree-of-Thought variants, and other retrieval-augmented baselines in both\nautomatic and human evaluations. Additionally, MIRAGE improves interpretability\nby generating explicit reasoning chains that trace each factual claim to\nconcrete chains within the knowledge graph, making it well-suited for complex\nmedical reasoning scenarios.

With this changed understanding of gravity, it has been quite easy\nto produce a semi-quantitative understanding of the solar origin of cosmic rays\nup to energies at least as great as $10^6$\\,GeV/nucleon that have by now been\ndetected and measured so persuasively. A ``Double Slingshot'' mechanism is\nproposed according to which at least a substantial fraction of all cosmic rays\ncould have begun their life within the solar system. Accelerator-based nuclear\nastrophysics is promoted, beginning with the functioning of an ``{\\rm E}\\&{\\rm\nM}'' storage ring for laboratory-based study of processes such as ${\\rm 6LI} +\n{\\rm 7Li} \\rightarrow {\\rm 13C} + \\gamma$. Especially to be emphasized are\nexperiments made possible by ''rear-end collisions'' between nuclear isotopes\nof two different types traveling simultaneously at different velocities in the\nsame direction in the same storage ring. This amounts to ``studying nuclear\nphysics in a moving frame of reference''.",

    "abstract": "The dipole in the angular distribution of the cosmic microwave background\n(CMB) is typically attributed to the Doppler effect and our motion relative to\nthe CMB rest frame. It is expected that observations of large-scale structures\nwould also exhibit a related kinematic dipole, helping to confirm the kinematic\norigin of the CMB dipole. However, numerous studies of the large-scale\nstructure dipole have shown significant discrepancies with predictions based on\nthe CMB. In this work, we investigate how considering the clustering dipole\naffects the cosmic large-scale structure distribution dipole using the National\nRadio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) Very Large Array (VLA) Sky Survey (NVSS) and\nexamine the nonlinear regime to calculate the correlation between the\nclustering dipole and the kinematic dipole. We also determine whether these\noutcomes help reconcile previous measurements of the NVSS dipole with\npredictions based on the CMB. Additionally, we explore a model in which the\ndistribution of matter on large scales might be intrinsically anisotropic.\nUsing the remnant discrepancy between the observed and predicted dipole, we\nderive an upper limit for the amplitude of intrinsic anisotropy and calculate\nthe clustering for this model. Furthermore, we investigate these results within\nthe framework of modified gravity theories, specifically the $f(R)$ gravity\nmodel. By examining this model, it is possible to gain a better understanding\nof how the cosmic dark energy component affects the dipole. Finally, by\ncomparing these two models, we can see that the $f(R)$ model predicts a higher\nclustering dipole compared to the standard cosmological model, which explains\nthe discrepancy between the kinetic and clustering dipoles and leads to a\nhigher dipole amplitude.",

Fourth, the software architecture is\nproposed for ease of integration, with strategies presented for modularity and\ncomputational efficiency tailored to constrained flight systems. Fifth, a\ncomprehensive test campaign is conducted, mapped to a requirements verification\nmatrix, spanning unit, interface, software-in-the-loop, and real-time\nhardware-in-the-loop tests, emphasizing gradual test fidelity for efficient\nfault isolation. Finally, flight-like results are demonstrated using the VISORS\nmission, due to the generalizability of the VISORS navigation operations, and\nthe stringency which demands sub-centimeter relative position and\nsub-millimeter-per-second velocity accuracy. This architecture aims to serve as\na reference for next-generation DSS missions adopting CDGNSS.",

A leading formation\nmechanism is planet-planet scatterings in unstable multi-planetary systems,\nwhich can naturally lead to planetary ejections. If these planets originally\nhost moons, it remains an open question whether such satellites can remain\ngravitationally bound to FFPs after ejection. In this work, we investigate both\nthe ejection velocity of FFPs produced by planet-planet scatterings and the\nsurvival rate of their potential moons; we estimate the latter by determining\nthe statistics of the minimum planet-planet distance prior to planet ejection,\nand comparing it to the initial orbital radius of the moon relative to its host\nplanet. Using the circular restricted three-body framework, we derive an\nanalytical boundary for the ejection velocity based on Jacobi energy\nconservation, which agrees with the results of integrations. We also identify a\nminimum planetary mass required for successful ejection. For two-planet systems\nwith finite planetary masses, we use simulations and analytical arguments to\ndetermine how the ejection velocity scales with the planetary mass and initial\nsemi-major axis. Extending our analysis to three-planet systems yields similar\nresults, reinforcing the robustness of our conclusions.

    "abstract": "Loudspeakers inherit their directivity from their geometry and dimensions.\nEnclosed loudspeakers are omnidirectional in the low frequency range, but their\ndirectivity depends on frequency for wavelengths smaller than the radiator\nsize, precluding the directional control over the whole bandwidth. Loudspeakers\npairs allow achieving simultaneously monopolar (in-phase) and dipolar\n(out-of-phase) sources, thus allowing directivity control. However, they are\nlimited by their bulkiness, preventing extending controllable directivities\nover high frequencies.\n  The Corona Discharge transducer (CDT) concept relies on ionizing an\nultra-thin layer of air and oscillating it through an alternating electric\nfield, generating sound without resorting to a mechanical membrane. This\ntransducer combines a monopolar source linked to heat exchanges, and a dipolar\nlinked to electrostatic forces, although these two sources strengths are\ninterconnected, yielding a given unidirectional directivity.\n  In this paper, we propose to leverage the combination of monopole and dipole\nat the heart of the CDT concept to achieve controllable directivities by\nstacking two independent CDTs. The very thin dimensions of the CDT allows\nachieving coincident controllable monopolar and dipolar sound sources making\nthe control of directivity over the whole operating frequency range. An\nanalytical model of the dual CDTs concept is first compared to full-wave\nsimulations, and an experimental prototype is finally assessed in anechoic\nconditions.

We compare their\nrepresentations of images to those of the human brain recorded with both fMRI\nand MEG, providing high resolution in spatial and temporal analyses. We assess\nthe brain-model similarity with three complementary metrics focusing on overall\nrepresentational similarity, topographical organization, and temporal dynamics.\nWe show that all three factors - model size, training amount, and image type -\nindependently and interactively impact each of these brain similarity metrics.\nIn particular, the largest DINOv3 models trained with the most human-centric\nimages reach the highest brain-similarity. This emergence of brain-like\nrepresentations in AI models follows a specific chronology during training:\nmodels first align with the early representations of the sensory cortices, and\nonly align with the late and prefrontal representations of the brain with\nconsiderably more training. Finally, this developmental trajectory is indexed\nby both structural and functional properties of the human cortex: the\nrepresentations that are acquired last by the models specifically align with\nthe cortical areas with the largest developmental expansion, thickness, least\nmyelination, and slowest timescales.

    "abstract": "The fusion of language and vision in large vision-language models (LVLMs) has\nrevolutionized deep learning-based object detection by enhancing adaptability,\ncontextual reasoning, and generalization beyond traditional architectures. This\nin-depth review presents a structured exploration of the state-of-the-art in\nLVLMs, systematically organized through a three-step research review process.\nFirst, we discuss the functioning of vision language models (VLMs) for object\ndetection, describing how these models harness natural language processing\n(NLP) and computer vision (CV) techniques to revolutionize object detection and\nlocalization. We then explain the architectural innovations, training\nparadigms, and output flexibility of recent LVLMs for object detection,\nhighlighting how they achieve advanced contextual understanding for object\ndetection. The review thoroughly examines the approaches used in integration of\nvisual and textual information, demonstrating the progress made in object\ndetection using VLMs that facilitate more sophisticated object detection and\nlocalization strategies. This review presents comprehensive visualizations\ndemonstrating LVLMs' effectiveness in diverse scenarios including localization\nand segmentation, and then compares their real-time performance, adaptability,\nand complexity to traditional deep learning systems. Based on the review, its\nis expected that LVLMs will soon meet or surpass the performance of\nconventional methods in object detection. The review also identifies a few\nmajor limitations of the current LVLM modes, proposes solutions to address\nthose challenges, and presents a clear roadmap for the future advancement in\nthis field. We conclude, based on this study, that the recent advancement in\nLVLMs have made and will continue to make a transformative impact on object\ndetection and robotic applications in the future.",

    "abstract": "In multiphysics damage problems, material degradation is often modeled using\nlocal or global damage variables, whose evolution introduces strong\nnonlinearities and significant computational costs. Linear projection-based\nreduced-order models (ROMs) are widely used to accelerate these simulations but\noften fail to capture complex nonlinear damage evolution effectively. This\nlimitation arises from the slow decay of the Kolmogorov n-width, which leads to\na phenomenon known as the Kolmogorov barrier in linear approximation. To\novercome this challenge, this study proposes a novel unified multi-perspective\n(multi-field and multi-state) quadratic manifold-based ROM framework for\nthermo-mechanically coupled damage-plasticity problems. A key feature lies in a\nmulti-field and multi-state decomposition strategy that is grounded in the\nmaterial's physical response to guide the selection of mode numbers for each\ncoupled field. Moreover, the framework decouples both material states and\nphysical fields, providing clearer insights into the contributions and\ninteractions of each field within the overall multiphysics simulation.\nBenchmark tests demonstrate that the proposed approach mitigates the Kolmogorov\nbarrier of linear projection-based ROMs by ensuring a smooth and monotonic\ndecrease in error as the number of modes increases. The proposed\nmulti-perspective quadratic manifold framework offers a robust and flexible\napproach for efficiently reducing complex damage-involved multiphysics problems\nand shows strong potential for industrial applications.",

This leads to a change in emissivity of\nsuch grains. In this work, we consider the evolution of the infrared (IR)\nluminosity of the SN remnant expanding into an inhomogeneous interstellar\nmedium with lognormal distribution of the density fluctuations. The IR\nluminosity of the swept-up interstellar dust rapidly increases during the first\nseveral thousand years after the SN explosion, and reaches the maximum value.\nAfterwards, it decreases due to the destruction of the dust grains in hot gas\nand their declining emissivity in the cooling down gas of the shell. We show\nhow the IR luminosity of dust in the SN remnant depends on the dispersion of\nthe gas density in front of the SN shock front. We find that for the\nsignificant period of time (40 - 50 kyr) the maximum of the dust IR luminosity\npeaks at the range centered at 70$\\mu$m. Therefore, this band can be considered\nas the most optimal range for studying the late SN remnants. We illustrate that\nduring evolution, the dust temperature changes from 70 to 20 K, and only\nslightly depends on the inhomogeneity of the medium. In the radiative phase,\nthe strong emission lines of metal ions emerge above the dust continuum. Their\nluminosity rapidly increases and exceeds the dust continuum luminosity by $\\sim\n10-10^3$ times. The point in time when the high luminosity in the lines is\nreached strongly depends on the inhomogeneity of the medium. We discuss\npossibilities for detection of the IR emission both in dust continuum and in\nlines. We expect that their ratios will allow to estimate the inhomogeneity of\nthe medium, where the remnant is expanding.",

This study aims to describe the\nprofile of severe dengue patients admitted to Brazilian Intensive Care units\n(ICUs) (2012-2024), assess trends over time, describe new onset complications\nwhile in ICU and determine the risk factors at admission to develop\ncomplications during ICU stay. Methods. We performed a prospective study of\ndengue patients from 253 ICUs across 56 hospitals. We used descriptive\nstatistics to describe the dengue ICU population, logistic regression to\nidentify risk factors for complications during the ICU stay, and a machine\nlearning framework to predict the risk of evolving to complications.\nVisualisations were generated using ISARIC VERTEX. Results. Of 11,047\nadmissions, 1,117 admissions (10.1%) evolved to complications, including\nnon-invasive (437 admissions) and invasive ventilation (166), vasopressor\n(364), blood transfusion (353) and renal replacement therapy (103). Age>80 (OR:\n3.10, 95% CI: 2.02-4.92), chronic kidney disease (OR: 2.94, 2.22-3.89), liver\ncirrhosis (OR: 3.65, 1.82-7.04), low platelets (<50,000 cells/mm3; OR: OR:\n2.25, 1.89-2.68), and high leukocytes (>7,000 cells/mm3; OR: 2.47, 2.02-3.03)\nwere significant risk factors for complications.

    "abstract": "Replication is a standard way to maintain availability of shared data in\nfault-prone distributed systems. To make sure that the data replicas are\nup-to-date, they need to synchronize, which typically means engaging the\nreplicas in waiting for coherent responses from each other. The amount of\nwaiting depends on the consistency and availability guarantees we impose on the\nsystem. The folklore CAP theory states that strong consistency (the set of\nreplicas create an illusion of one correct server) and strong availability (the\nreplicas' states are reachable despite network partitions) cannot be\nimplemented in the same system. A popular way to deal with this impossibility\nis to relax consistency to be only eventual: the replicas eventually converge\nto the same state. In return, the replicas can be wait-free, i.e., the clients\ncan get the data from the closest replica without waiting for other ones.\n  Wait-free data replication faces two important challenges. First, the\noperations issued by the clients may be constantly revoked, i.e., their effects\ncan be repeatedly recomputed due to asynchrony and concurrency. Second, even if\nsome operations eventually stabilize in their effects, a particular client may\nstill experience starvation if, from some point onward, each of its operations\nis later revoked. In this paper, we address these challenges through a general\nDAG-based framework for replicated data types, where replicas exchange their\nlocal views and merge them using a reconciliation function. Within this\nframework, we design reconciliation functions that implement a wait-free\neventually consistent replicated state machine ensuring both stable convergence\nand fair progress. Specifically, every replica maintains a growing sequence of\nclient operations, and we guarantee that: (1) all replicas share a common,\nmonotonically growing stable prefix of operations, and (2) no client starves.",

    "abstract": "Semi-structured tables, widely used in real-world applications (e.g.,\nfinancial reports, medical records, transactional orders), often involve\nflexible and complex layouts (e.g., hierarchical headers and merged cells).\nThese tables generally rely on human analysts to interpret table layouts and\nanswer relevant natural language questions, which is costly and inefficient. To\nautomate the procedure, existing methods face significant challenges. First,\nmethods like NL2SQL require converting semi-structured tables into structured\nones, which often causes substantial information loss. Second, methods like\nNL2Code and multi-modal LLM QA struggle to understand the complex layouts of\nsemi-structured tables and cannot accurately answer corresponding questions. To\nthis end, we propose ST-Raptor, a tree-based framework for semi-structured\ntable question answering using large language models. First, we introduce the\nHierarchical Orthogonal Tree (HO-Tree), a structural model that captures\ncomplex semi-structured table layouts, along with an effective algorithm for\nconstructing the tree. Second, we define a set of basic tree operations to\nguide LLMs in executing common QA tasks. Given a user question, ST-Raptor\ndecomposes it into simpler sub-questions, generates corresponding tree\noperation pipelines, and conducts operation-table alignment for accurate\npipeline execution. Third, we incorporate a two-stage verification mechanism:\nforward validation checks the correctness of execution steps, while backward\nvalidation evaluates answer reliability by reconstructing queries from\npredicted answers. To benchmark the performance, we present SSTQA, a dataset of\n764 questions over 102 real-world semi-structured tables. Experiments show that\nST-Raptor outperforms nine baselines by up to 20% in answer accuracy. The code\nis available at https://github.com/weAIDB/ST-Raptor.",

Two important\nimprovements are introduced: i) charge radii used to constrain the length\nparameter are evaluated within a generalized formula, where proton occupation\nnumbers are substituted by sums of spectroscopic factors, while radial wave\nfunctions are required to match separation energies with respect to the\nintermediate $(A-1)$-nucleon states by adjusting parameters such as the\npotential depth; ii) configuration mixing wave functions and energies for\nmany-particle states are obtained through the diagonalization of\nwell-established effective interactions in large configuration spaces without\ntruncation. Furthermore, a variation of $\\pm0.1$\\,fm in the surface diffuseness\nparameter is now incorporated as a source of uncertainty. The present results\nare generally in fairly good agreement with those from previous studies. As an\nexception, the $\\delta_{C2}$ value obtained for $^{18}$Ne is smaller by\napproximately a factor of two, principally due to the updated charge-radius\ntreatment. A reduction is also observed in most cases with $A\\ge38$, through\nthe deviations generally remain within the newly assigned error bars. The\nsmaller isospin-mixing counterpart, $\\delta_{C1}$, is strongly\ninteraction-dependent, roughly following an inverse-square law with respect to\nthe energy separation between the lowest admixed levels. Therefore, an\nadditional procedure to ensure isobaric displacements within the isospin\nmultiplets appears to be indispensable.

Consequently, recorded brain signals become weaker,\nuncertain, and contain poor visual context over time. This paper presents one\nof the first vision-learning approaches to address this problem. First, we\nstatistically and experimentally demonstrate the existence of inconsistency in\nbrain signals and its impact on the Vision-Brain Understanding (VBU) model. Our\nfindings show that brain signal representations shift over recording sessions,\nleading to compounding bias, which poses challenges for model learning and\ndegrades performance. Then, we propose a new Bias-Mitigation Continual Learning\n(BRAIN) approach to address these limitations. In this approach, the model is\ntrained in a continual learning setup and mitigates the growing bias from each\nlearning step. A new loss function named De-bias Contrastive Learning is also\nintroduced to address the bias problem. In addition, to prevent catastrophic\nforgetting, where the model loses knowledge from previous sessions, the new\nAngular-based Forgetting Mitigation approach is introduced to preserve learned\nknowledge in the model.

For the case of $\\mathbb{F} = \\mathbb{F}_2$, this is the\nwell-studied problem of refuting semirandom instances of $k$-XOR, where the\nworks of [GKM22,HKM23] establish a tight trade-off between runtime and clause\ndensity for refutation: for any choice of a parameter $\\ell$, they give an\n$n^{O(\\ell)}$-time algorithm to certify that there is no assignment that can\nsatisfy more than $\\frac{1}{2} + \\varepsilon$-fraction of constraints in a\nsemirandom $k$-XOR instance, provided that the instance has $O(n) \\cdot\n\\left(\\frac{n}{\\ell}\\right)^{k/2 - 1} \\log n /\\varepsilon^4$ constraints, and\nthe work of [KMOW17] provides good evidence that this tight up to a\n$\\mathrm{polylog}(n)$ factor via lower bounds for the Sum-of-Squares hierarchy.\nHowever for larger fields, the only known results for this problem are\nestablished via black-box reductions to the case of $\\mathbb{F}_2$, resulting\nin an $|{\\mathbb{F}}|^{3k}$ gap between the current best upper and lower\nbounds.\n  In this paper, we give an algorithm for refuting semirandom\n$k$-LIN$(\\mathbb{F})$ instances with the \"correct\" dependence on the field size\n$|{\\mathbb{F}}|$.

An effective solution is\nto approximate the limit-state function with a surrogate model iteratively\nrefined through active learning, thereby reducing the number of expensive\nsimulations. At each iteration, an acquisition strategy selects the next sample\nby balancing two competing goals: exploration, to reduce global predictive\nuncertainty, and exploitation, to improve accuracy near the failure boundary.\nClassical strategies, such as the U-function and the Expected Feasibility\nFunction (EFF), implicitly condense exploration and exploitation into a scalar\nscore derived from the surrogate predictive mean and variance, concealing the\ntrade-off and biasing sampling. We introduce a multi-objective optimization\n(MOO) formulation for sample acquisition in reliability analysis, where\nexploration and exploitation are explicit, competing objectives. Within our\nframework, U and EFF correspond to specific Pareto-optimal solutions, providing\na unifying perspective that connects classical and Pareto-based approaches.\nSolving the MOO problem discards dominated candidates, yielding a compact\nPareto set, with samples representing a quantifiable exploration-exploitation\ntrade-off. To select samples from the Pareto set, we adopt the knee point and\nthe compromise solution, and further propose a strategy that adjusts the\ntrade-off according to reliability estimates. Across benchmark limit-state\nfunctions, we assess the sample efficiency and active learning performance of\nall strategies. Results show that U and EFF exhibit case-dependent performance,\nknee and compromise are generally effective, and the adaptive strategy is\nrobust, consistently reaching strict targets and maintaining relative errors\nbelow 0.1%.",

It explores how the\ndiscarded qubit states of Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) quantum\nconvolutional neural networks (QCNNs) can be leveraged alongside a classical\nclassifier to improve classification performance. Current QCNNs discard qubit\nstates after pooling; yet, unlike classical pooling, these qubits often remain\nentangled with the retained ones, meaning valuable correlated information is\nlost. We experiment with recycling this information and combining it with the\nconventional measurements from the retained qubits. Accordingly, we propose a\nhybrid quantum-classical architecture that couples a modified QCNN with fully\nconnected classical layers. Two shallow fully connected (FC) heads separately\nprocess measurements from retained and discarded qubits, whose outputs are\nensembled before a final classification layer. Joint optimisation with a\nclassical cross-entropy loss allows both quantum and classical parameters to\nadapt coherently. The method outperforms comparable lightweight models on\nMNIST, Fashion-MNIST and OrganAMNIST. These results indicate that reusing\ndiscarded qubit information is a promising approach for future hybrid\nquantum-classical models and may extend to tasks beyond image classification.",

In many applications, rather than considering the\nheterogeneity induced by all covariates, practitioners focus on a few key\ncovariates to develop tailored treatment decisions. Based on this, we aim to\nestimate the group average treatment effects (GATEs), which represent\nheterogeneous treatment effects across subpopulations defined by certain key\ncovariates. Previous strategies for estimating GATEs, such as weighting-based\nand regression-based methods, suffer from instability or extrapolation bias,\nespecially when several propensity scores are close to zero or one. To address\nthese limitations, we propose two novel nonparametric estimation methods: a\nmatching-based method and a bias-corrected matching method for estimating\nGATEs. The matching-based method imputes potential outcomes using a matching\ntechnique, followed by a nonparametric regression. This method avoids the\ninstability caused by extreme propensity scores but may introduce\nnon-negligible bias when the dimension of full covariates is high. To mitigate\nthis, the bias-corrected matching estimator incorporates additional outcome\nregression models, enhancing robustness and reducing bias. We show the\nconsistency, double robustness, and asymptotic normality of the bias-corrected\nmatching estimator. We empirically demonstrate the advantages of the proposed\nmethods with extensive simulation studies and a real-world application.

We show that the\ndegree of band flatness and its quantum geometry can be revealed through\noptical absorption and its resulting optical bounds, which are based on the\ntrace condition in quantum geometry. More specifically, the narrow and isolated\npeak of optical absorption in the low-energy region provides information about\nthe bandwidth of the two flat bands. When this value is smaller than the\nelectron interaction, it serves as a critical condition for the emergence of\nflat band superconductivity. Furthermore, optical absorption also provides the\ngap value between the flat band and the dispersive band, and when this gap is\nlarger than the electron interaction, it facilitates the realization of\nfractional Chern insulating phases. We show that the narrow and isolated peak\nof optical bound near zero energy decreases as lattice relaxation increases.\nMeanwhile, we demonstrate that the imaginary part of (generalized) optical Hall\nconductivity reveals the vanishing of the negative part of Berry curvature,\nwhich is enforced by the refined trace-determinant inequality. Accordingly, we\nshow that the total amount of the negative part and component of the Berry\ncurvature approaches zero in the single ideal flat-band case.

Mapping this challenge onto a graph-based problem,\nspecifically the Maximum Weighted Independent Set (MWIS) problem, allows it to\nbe addressed by specialized hardware such as neutral-atom quantum processors.\nHowever, a significant bottleneck has been the size mismatch between\nbiologically relevant molecular systems and the limited capacity of near-term\nquantum devices. In this work, we overcome this scaling limitation by the use\nof a novel divide-and-conquer heuristic introduced in Cazals et al. This\nalgorithm enables the solution of large-scale MWIS problems by decomposing a\nsingle, intractable graph instance into smaller sub-problems that can be solved\nsequentially on a neutral-atom quantum emulator, incurring only a linear\ncomputational overhead.

    "abstract": "In this work we consider a growing random graph sequence where a new vertex\nis less likely to join to an existing vertex with high degree and more likely\nto join to a vertex with low degree. In contrast to the well studied\n\\emph{preferential attachment random graphs} \\cite{BarAlb99}, we call such a\nsequence a \\emph{de-preferential attachment random graph model}. We consider\ntwo types of models, namely, \\emph{inverse de-preferential}, where the\nattachment probabilities are inversely proportional to the degree and\n\\emph{linear de-preferential}, where the attachment probabilities are\nproportional to $c-$degree, where $c > 0$ is a constant. For the case when each\nnew vertex comes with exactly one half-edge we show that the degree of a fixed\nvertex is asymptotically of the order $\\sqrt{\\log n}$ for the inverse\nde-preferential case and of the order $\\log n$ for the linear case. These show\nthat compared to preferential attachment, the degree of a fixed vertex grows to\ninfinity at a much slower rate for these models. We also show that in both\ncases limiting degree distributions have exponential tails. In fact we show\nthat for the inverse de-preferential model the tail of the limiting degree\ndistribution is faster than exponential while that for the linear\nde-preferential model is exactly the $\\mbox{Geometric}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)$\ndistribution. For the case when each new vertex comes with $m > 1$ half-edges,\nwe show that similar asymptotic results hold for fixed vertex degree in both\ninverse and linear de-preferential models.

While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promising avenues to\nsimulate user behavior, they often struggle with the absence of specific domain\nalignment required for RSs and the efficiency demands of large-scale\nsimulation. A vast yet underutilized resource for enhancing this alignment is\nthe extensive user feedback inherent in RSs. However, directly leveraging such\nfeedback presents two significant challenges. First, user feedback in RSs is\noften ambiguous and noisy, which negatively impacts effective preference\nalignment. Second, the massive volume of feedback largely hinders the\nefficiency of preference alignment, necessitating an efficient filtering\nmechanism to identify more informative samples. To overcome these hurdles, we\nintroduce a novel data construction framework that leverages user feedback in\nRSs with advanced LLM capabilities to generate high-quality simulation data.\nOur framework unfolds in two key phases: (1) employing LLMs to generate\ncognitive decision-making processes on constructed simulation samples, reducing\nambiguity in raw user feedback; (2) data distillation based on uncertainty\nestimation and behavior sampling to filter challenging yet denoised simulation\nsamples. Accordingly, we fine-tune lightweight LLMs, as user simulators, using\nsuch high-quality dataset with corresponding decision-making processes.\nExtensive experiments verify that our framework significantly boosts the\nalignment with human preferences and in-domain reasoning capabilities of\nfine-tuned LLMs, and provides more insightful and interpretable signals when\ninteracting with RSs.

A key outcome of\ninterest is thus parent receipt of the program at each visit. Clinicians\ndocumented program delivery in patients' electronic health records for all\nvisits, but their reporting is a proxy measure for the parent receipt outcome.\nParents were also surveyed to report directly on program receipt after their\nchild's visit; however, only a small subset of them completed the survey. Here,\nwe develop a causal inference framework for a binary outcome that is subject to\nmisclassification through silver-standard measures (clinician reports), but\ngold-standard measures (parent reports) are only available for a non-random\ninternal validation subset. We propose a method for identifying the average\ntreatment effect (ATE) that addresses the risk of bias due to misclassification\nand non-random validation selection, even when the outcome (parent receipt) may\ndirectly impact selection propensity (survey responsiveness). We show that ATE\nestimation relies on specifying the relationship between the gold- and\nsilver-standard outcome measures in the validation subset, which may depend on\ntreatment and covariates. Additionally, the clustered design is reflected in\nour causal assumptions and in our cluster-robust approach to estimation of the\nATE.

Yet, its effectiveness typically\nrelies on two conditions: (1) a well-defined problem space (e.g., mathematical\nreasoning), and (2) the model's ability to self-correct -- conditions that are\nrarely met in conversational product search. In this setting, user queries are\noften ambiguous and evolving, and MLLMs alone have difficulty grounding\nresponses in a fixed product corpus. Motivated by these challenges, we propose\na novel framework that introduces test-time scaling into conversational\nmultimodal product retrieval. Our approach builds on a generative retriever,\nfurther augmented with a test-time reranking (TTR) mechanism that improves\nretrieval accuracy and better aligns results with evolving user intent\nthroughout the dialogue. Experiments across multiple benchmarks show consistent\nimprovements, with average gains of 14.5 points in MRR and 10.6 points in\nnDCG@1.",

    "abstract": "(Abridged) Giant planets are observed orbiting the primary stars of close\nbinary systems. Such planets may have formed in compact circumprimary disks,\nunder conditions much different than those around single stars. To quantify the\neffects of the strong gravitational perturbations exerted on circumprimary disk\nmaterial, the 3D dynamics of gas and dust in orbit around the primary star of a\ncompact and eccentric binary was modeled by using gamma Cephei as a\nrepresentative of a class of close binary systems. Circumprimary gas was\napproximated as an Eulerian viscous and compressible fluid. Dust grains were\nmodeled as Lagrangean particles, subjected to gravity and drag forces. Some\nmodels also include a giant planet. Models show that spiral density waves\nexcited around pericenter passage propagate toward the inner disk boundary,\nthrough a few pressure scaleheights from the midplane, inducing radial and\nvertical mixing in the gas. However, perturbations imparted to gas, both in\nterms of eccentricity and precession, are far weaker than previously estimated\nby 2D simulations. Models predict small eccentricities, <~ 0.03, and slow\nretrograde precession. The addition of a giant planet does not change the low\neccentricity state of the disk. The parameters applied to the disk would lead\nto the formation of a planet many times the mass of Jupiter, in agreement with\nsome observations. Micron to mm-size dust grains are well coupled to the gas,\nresulting in similar dynamics and statistically similar distributions of\norbital elements. The planet only affects the dust distributions locally. In\nagreement with results of recent 2D models, the lifetime of an isolated\ncircumprimary disk would be brief, ~1e5 years, due to its compact nature,\nrequiring a long-term external supply of mass to allow for the in situ\nformation of a giant planet.",

Traditional toughening strategies have primarily\nfocused on modulating the internal microstructural units of diamonds, including\nadjustments to stacking sequences, faults, nanotwinning, and the incorporation\nof amorphous phases, collectively referred to as intrinsic toughening. Here, we\nintroduce an extrinsic toughening strategy to develop an unparalleled tough\ndiamond composite with complex and abundant sp2-sp3 bonding interfaces, by\nincorporating highly dispersed multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) into the\ngaps of diamond grains to create a three-dimensional (3D) continuous MWCTNs\nnetwork-toughen heterogeneous structure. The resultant composite exhibits a\nhardness of approximately 91.6 GPa and a fracture toughness of roughly 36.4\nMPa.m1/2, which is six times higher than that of synthetic diamond and even\nsurpasses that of tungsten alloys, surpassing the benefits achievable through\nintrinsic toughening alone. The remarkable toughening behavior can be\nattributed to the formation of numerous mixed sp2-sp3 bonding interactions at\nthe 3D continuous network MWCNTs/diamond interfaces, which facilitate efficient\nenergy dissipation. Our 3D continuous network heterogeneous structure design\nprovides an effective approach for enhancing the fracture toughness of\nsuperhard materials, offering a new paradigm for the advanced composite\nceramics.",

Unfortunately, this ability can be\nrestricted in certain situations, such as for individuals who have lost their\nvoice or in environments where speaking aloud is unsuitable.

For such cases,\nsilent speech interfaces have been proposed, which focus on processing\nbiosignals corresponding to silently produced speech. These interfaces enable\nsynthesis of audible speech from biosignals that are produced when speaking\nsilently and recognition aka decoding of biosignals into text that corresponds\nto the silently produced speech.

To reconstruct the coronal magnetic field, we\napplied a physics-informed neural network (PINN)-based nonlinear force-free\nfield (NLFFF) extrapolation method to a pre-eruption HMI vector magnetogram.\nThe NLFFF extrapolation reveals a large-scale magnetic flux rope (MFR) of about\n500 Mm in length, consistent with the filament.

Overlying strapping fields connect to the area\ninto which the dimming and flare ribbon later expand. This configuration\nexplains the formation of the dimming as a stationary flux rope and strapping\nflux dimming, with subsequent expansion driven by the growth of the MFR\nfootprint through strapping-strapping reconnection. Conversely, the western\nfilament leg shows multiple anchor points and strong overlying magnetic fields,\nwhich suppressed the dimming and partially confined the eruption on that side.\nThe reconstructed pre-eruptive NLFFF configuration offers a clear physical\nexplanation for the asymmetries seen in the eruption, flare geometry, and\ncoronal dimming.

    "abstract": "In this paper we study the first nonlinear stage of modulation instability\n(NLSMI) of $x$-periodic AWs in multidimensional generalizations of the focusing\nnonlinear Schr\\\"odinger (NLS) equation, like the non-integrable elliptic and\nhyperbolic NLS equations in $2+1$ and $3+1$ dimensions. In the quasi\none-dimensional (Q1D) regime, where the wavelength in the $x$ direction of\npropagation is significantly smaller than in the transversal directions, the\nbehavior is universal, independent of the particular model at leading order,\nand described by adiabatic deformations of the Akhmediev breather solution of\nNLS. Varying the initial data, the first NLSMI shows various combinations of\nbasic processes like AW growth from the unstable background, followed by\nfission in the slowly varying transversal directions, and the inverse process\nof fusion, followed by AW decay to the background. Fission and fusion are\ncritical processes showing similarities with multidimensional wave breaking,\nand with phase transitions of second kind and critical exponent $1/2$. In $3+1$\ndimensions with radial symmetry in the transversal slowly varying plane,\nfission consists in the formation of an opening smoke ring centered on the $x$\naxis. In the long wave limit, the Q1D Akhmediev breather reduces to the Q1D\nanalogue of the Peregrine instanton, rationally localized in space. Numerical\nexperiments on the hyperbolic NLS equation show that the process of \"AW growth\n+ fission\" is not restricted to the Q1D regime, extending to a finite area of\nthe modulation instability domain. The universality of these processes suggests\ntheir observability in natural phenomena related to AWs in contexts such as\nwater waves, nonlinear optics, and plasma physics.",

    "abstract": "AI-generated content technologies are widely used in content creation.\nHowever, current AIGC systems rely heavily on creators' inspiration, rarely\ngenerating truly user-personalized content. In real-world applications such as\nonline advertising, a single product may have multiple selling points, with\ndifferent users focusing on different features. This underscores the\nsignificant value of personalized, user-centric creative generation. Effective\npersonalized content generation faces two main challenges: (1) accurately\nmodeling user interests and integrating them into the content generation\nprocess while adhering to factual constraints, and (2) ensuring high efficiency\nand scalability to handle the massive user base in industrial scenarios.\nAdditionally, the scarcity of personalized creative data in practice\ncomplicates model training, making data construction another key hurdle. We\npropose HLLM-Creator, a hierarchical LLM framework for efficient user interest\nmodeling and personalized content generation. During inference, a combination\nof user clustering and a user-ad-matching-prediction based pruning strategy is\nemployed to significantly enhance generation efficiency and reduce\ncomputational overhead, making the approach suitable for large-scale\ndeployment. Moreover, we design a data construction pipeline based on\nchain-of-thought reasoning, which generates high-quality, user-specific\ncreative titles and ensures factual consistency despite limited personalized\ndata. This pipeline serves as a critical foundation for the effectiveness of\nour model. Extensive experiments on personalized title generation for Douyin\nSearch Ads show the effectiveness of HLLM-Creator.

    "abstract": "One of the central tenets of the theory of the fractional quantum Hall effect\nis that the bulk quantized Hall response requires the existence of a gapless\nchiral edge mode. The field theoretical arguments for this rely on locality.\nWhile locality is typically met in standard experimental settings, it need not\nalways apply. Motivated by experimental capabilities of photonic platforms, we\nstudy confining potentials that are step-like in angular momentum, and thus\nnon-local in position. We show that this non-local potential does not host\nconventional chiral edge modes. These are replaced by gapless spin-2 edge\nstates, which we show are connected to the collective 'graviton' excitations\nthat are gapped in the bulk. Furthermore, we show that FQH states host gapless\n(charged) quasiparticles on their edges, even in the absence of conventional\nedge modes. The edge state energies vanish as a power-law in system size, with\nan exponent that characterises the bulk topological order.",

    "abstract": "Concurrent separation logic with fractional permissions (CSLPerm) provides a\npromising reasoning system to verify most complex sequential and concurrent\nfine-grained programs. The logic with strong and weak separating conjunctions\noffers a solid foundation for producing concise and precise proofs. However, it\nlacks automation and compositionality support. This paper addresses this\nlimitation by introducing a compositional verification system for concurrent\nprograms that manipulate regions of shared memory. The centre of our system is\nnovel logical principles and an entailment procedure that can infer the\nresidual heaps in the frame rule for a fragment of CSL-Perm with explicit\narithmetical constraints for memory heaps' disjointness. This procedure enables\nthe compositional reasoning for concurrent threads and function calls.

    "abstract": "Quantum optimal control is essential for designing high-fidelity quantum\noperations, but computational demands often limit its application to realistic\nquantum devices. We apply a computational framework that dramatically reduces\nthe computational cost while maintaining predictive accuracy through the\nlow-rank approximation for simulating open quantum system dynamics. The key\ninsight is that most quantum operation protocols maintain the system in nearly\npure states throughout their execution. This enables an efficient\nrepresentation of the density matrix with rank-$M$ matrices where $M \\ll N$ ,\n$N$ being the Hilbert space dimension, achieving substantial speedups without\nsacrificing accuracy. We benchmark our approach on the optimization of the\ntransmon qubit dispersive readout in a realistic transmon-resonator-filter\nmodel with Hilbert space dimension $N = 2000$. Using only $M = 20$, we achieve\nan 81-fold speedup compared to full master equation integration while\naccurately reproducing all relevant observables. By combining the low-rank\napproximation with a compact pulse parametrization and gradient-free\noptimization, we obtain state-of-the-art readout assignment errors\n$\\varepsilon_a \\approx 1.2 \\times 10^{-3}$ for a 40 ns readout pulse schedule,\nwhile comfortably running on a laptop and not relying on the rotating-wave\napproximation. Our approach is broadly applicable to most quantum control\nprotocols, including quantum gates, state preparation, and fast reset\noperations. It represents a powerful resource and a step forward in quantum\noptimal control, making accurate large-scale device optimization more\naccessible with greatly reduced computational resources and accelerating\nprogress toward scalable quantum technologies.",

    "abstract": "Multi-stage stochastic optimization lies at the core of decision-making under\nuncertainty. As the analytical solution is available only in exceptional cases,\ndynamic optimization aims to efficiently find approximations but often neglects\nnon-Markovian time-interdependencies. Methods on scenario trees can represent\nsuch interdependencies but are subject to the curse of dimensionality. To ease\nthis problem, researchers typically approximate the uncertainty by smaller but\nmore accurate trees. In this article, we focus on multi-stage optimal tree\nquantization methods of time-interdependent stochastic processes, for which we\ndevelop novel bounds and demonstrate that the upper bound can be minimized via\nprojected gradient descent incorporating the tree structure as linear\nconstraints. Consequently, we propose an efficient quantization procedure,\nwhich improves forward-looking samples using a backward step on the tree. We\napply the results to the multi-stage inventory control with time-interdependent\ndemand. For the case with one product, we benchmark the approximation because\nthe problem allows a solution in closed-form. For the multi-dimensional\nproblem, our solution found by optimal discrete approximation demonstrates the\nimportance of holding mitigation inventory in different phases of the product\nlife cycle.",

The development is made through a\nmodified spectral analysis of the TGP numerical values tabulated over more than\n30,000 yr (13,200~BC--17,191~AD). The latest JPL NASA's long-term numerical\nephemeris DE441 (Park et al., Astron. J., 161:105, 2021) is used as the source\nof the Moon, the Sun and major planets coordinates. For comparison, the KSM03\nseries were done on the basis of an older DE406 ephemeris (Standish, JPL IOM\n312.F, 1998) and over a shorter time interval of 2000 yr (1000--3000).\n  As a result of using an extended time span several new long-periodic waves in\nthe Earth TGP are found and most of other terms are updated. In particular, a\nrelatively large term of amplitude of $3\\times 10^{-5}~{\\rm m}^2\\,{\\rm s}^{-2}$\nand period of $\\simeq$7.4~kyr is revealed.

PoC reports may include critical information\nsuch as specific usage, test platforms, and more, providing essential insights\nfor researchers. However, in reality, due to various PoC templates across PoC\nplatforms, PoC reports extensively suffer from information deficiency, leading\nthe suboptimal quality and limited usefulness. Fortunately, we found that\ninformation deficiency of PoC reports could be mitigated by the completion from\nmultiple sources given the same referred vulnerability. In this paper, we\nconduct the first study on the deficiency of information in PoC reports across\npublic platforms. We began by collecting 173,170 PoC reports from 4 different\nplatforms and defined 8 key aspects that PoCs should contain. By integrating\nrule-based matching and a fine-tuned BERT-NER model for extraction of key\naspects, we discovered that all PoC reports available on public platforms have\nat least one missing key aspect. Subsequently, we developed a multi-source\ninformation fusion method to complete the missing aspect information in PoC\nreports by leveraging CVE entries and related PoC reports from different\nsources. Finally, we successfully completed 69,583 PoC reports (40.18% of all\nreports).",

However, the thermodynamic metastability of\nRuddlesden-Popper nickelates Lnn+1NinO3n+1 (Ln = lanthanide) presents\nsignificant challenges in achieving precise control over their structure and\noxygen stoichiometry. This study establishes a systematic approach for growing\nphase-pure, high-quality Ln3Ni2O7 thin films on LaAlO3 and SrLaAlO4 substrates\nusing gigantic-oxidative atomic-layer-by-layer epitaxy. The films grown under\nan ultrastrong oxidizing ozone atmosphere are superconducting without further\npost annealing. Specifically, the optimal Ln3Ni2O7/SrLaAlO4 superconducting\nfilm exhibits an onset transition temperature (Tc,onset) of 50 K. Four critical\nfactors governing the crystalline quality and superconducting properties of\nLn3Ni2O7 films are identified: 1) precise cation stoichiometric control\nsuppresses secondary phase formation; 2) complete atomic layer-by-layer\ncoverage coupled with 3) optimized interface reconstruction minimizes stacking\nfaults; 4) accurate oxygen content regulation is essential for achieving a\nsingle superconducting transition and high Tc,onset.

    "abstract": "Arc-routing problems underpin numerous critical field operations, including\npower-line inspection, urban police patrolling, and traffic monitoring. In this\ndomain, the Rural Postman Problem (RPP) is a fundamental variant in which a\nprescribed subset of edges or arcs in a network must be traversed. This paper\ninvestigates a generalized form of the RPP, called RPP-mTD, which involves a\nfleet of multiple trucks, each carrying multiple drones. The trucks act as\nmobile depots traversing a road network, from which drones are launched to\nexecute simultaneous service, with the objective of minimizing the overall\nmakespan. Given the combinatorial complexity of RPP-mTD, we propose a Hybrid\nGenetic Algorithm (HGA) that combines population-based exploration with\ntargeted neighborhood searches. Solutions are encoded using a two-layer\nchromosome that represents: (i) an ordered, directed sequence of required\nedges, and (ii) their assignment to vehicles. A tailored segment-preserving\ncrossover operator is introduced, along with multiple local search techniques\nto intensify the optimization. We benchmark the proposed HGA against\nestablished single truck-and-drone instances, demonstrating competitive\nperformance. Additionally, we conduct extensive evaluations on new,\nlarger-scale instances to demonstrate scalability. Our findings highlight the\noperational benefits of closely integrated truck-drone fleets, affirming the\nHGA's practical effectiveness as a decision-support tool in advanced\nmixed-fleet logistics.",

    "abstract": "We consider two different problem families that deal with domination in\ngraphs. On the one hand, we focus on dominating sequences. In such a sequence,\nevery vertex dominates some vertex of the graph that was not dominated by any\nearlier vertex in the sequence. The problem of finding the longest dominating\nsequence is known as $\\mathsf{Grundy~Domination}$. Depending on whether the\nclosed or the open neighborhoods are used for domination, there are three other\nversions of this problem. We show that all four problem variants are\n$\\mathsf{W[1]}$-hard when parameterized by the solution size. On the other\nhand, we consider the family of Zero forcing problems which form the\nparameterized duals of the Grundy domination problems. In these problems, one\nlooks for the smallest set of vertices initially colored blue such that certain\ncolor change rules are able to color all other vertices blue. Bhyravarapu et\nal. [IWOCA 2025] showed that one of these problems, known as\n$\\mathsf{Zero~Forcing~Set}$, is in $\\mathsf{FPT}$ when parameterized by the\ntreewidth or the solution size. We extend their treewidth result to the other\nthree variants of zero forcing and their respective Grundy domination problems.\nOur algorithm also implies an $\\mathsf{FPT}$ algorithm for\n$\\mathsf{Grundy~Domination}$ when parameterized by the number of vertices that\nare not in the dominating sequence.",

The grown substrate crystals are nearly lattice-matched\nwith Y3Fe5O12 (YIG) to allow epitaxial growth of high-quality thin films.\nSingle crystalline YIG films with thicknesses between 100 nanometer and 2.9\nmicrometer were successfully grown on epi-polished YSGAG substrates using\nliquid phase epitaxy (LPE). Selected magnetic and microwave properties of the\nepitaxial films, which still exhibit small lattice misfits to the substrates,\nwere then studied at room temperature. In addition, initial low-temperature\ninvestigations confirm that the YIG/YSGAG system is superior to the\nconventional YIG/GGG (Gd3Ga5O12) system at temperatures below 10 K, as the\nferromagnetic resonance (FMR) linewidth does not increase with decreasing\ntemperature. Therefore, the novel diamagnetic substrates are better suited for\nmicrowave applications at low temperature, as excessive damping losses induced\nby paramagnetic substrates can be avoided. It therefore seems to be a suitable\npathway to achieve scalable microwave components for hybrid-integrated quantum\nsystems based on ultralow-damping YIG films that can operate efficiently at\nmillikelvin temperatures.",

    "abstract": "Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is a key feature of\nnext-generation 6G wireless systems, allowing them to achieve high data rates\nand sensing accuracy. While prior research has primarily focused on addressing\ncommunication safety in ISAC systems, the equally critical issue of sensing\nsafety remains largely under-explored. In this paper, the possibility of\nspoofing the sensing function of ISAC in vehicle networks is examined, whereby\na malicious reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is deployed to compromise\nthe sensing functionality of a roadside unit (RSU). For this scenario, the\nrequirements on the malicious RIS' phase shifts design and number of reflecting\nelements are analyzed. Under such spoofing, the practical estimation bias of\nthe vehicular user (VU)'s Doppler shift and angle-of-departure (AoD) for an\narbitrary time slot is analytically derived. Moreover, from the attacker's\nview, a Markov decision process (MDP) is formulated to optimize the RIS' phase\nshifts design. The goal of this MDP is to generate complete and plausible fake\ntrajectories by incorporating the concept of spatial-temporal consistency. To\ndefend against this sensing spoofing attack, a signal temporal logic\n(STL)-based neuro-symbolic attack detection framework is proposed and shown to\nlearn interoperable formulas for identifying spoofed trajectories.",

However, existing studies assume fixed\nplanning horizons and often focus on single prompts or narrow domains. To\ndistinguish planning from improvisation across models and tasks, we present\nformal and causally grounded criteria for detecting planning and operationalize\nthem as a semi-automated annotation pipeline. We apply this pipeline to both\nbase and instruction-tuned Gemma-2-2B models on the MBPP code generation\nbenchmark and a poem generation task where Claude 3.5 Haiku was previously\nshown to plan. Our findings show that planning is not universal: unlike Haiku,\nGemma-2-2B solves the same poem generation task through improvisation, and on\nMBPP it switches between planning and improvisation across similar tasks and\neven successive token predictions. We further show that instruction tuning\nrefines existing planning behaviors in the base model rather than creating them\nfrom scratch.

One such task is Named\nEntity Recognition (NER), which involves identifying and classifying proper\nnames in text, such as people, organizations, locations, dates, and other\nspecific entities. NER plays a crucial role in extracting information from\nunstructured textual data, enabling downstream applications such as information\nretrieval from unstructured text.\n  Traditionally, NER is addressed using supervised machine learning approaches,\nwhich require large amounts of annotated training data. However, historical\ntexts present a unique challenge, as the annotated datasets are often scarce or\nnonexistent, due to the high cost and expertise required for manual labeling.\nIn addition, the variability and noise inherent in historical language, such as\ninconsistent spelling and archaic vocabulary, further complicate the\ndevelopment of reliable NER systems for these sources.\n  In this study, we explore the feasibility of applying LLMs to NER in\nhistorical documents using zero-shot and few-shot prompting strategies, which\nrequire little to no task-specific training data. Our experiments, conducted on\nthe HIPE-2022 (Identifying Historical People, Places and other Entities)\ndataset, show that LLMs can achieve reasonably strong performance on NER tasks\nin this setting. While their performance falls short of fully supervised models\ntrained on domain-specific annotations, the results are nevertheless promising.\nThese findings suggest that LLMs offer a viable and efficient alternative for\ninformation extraction in low-resource or historically significant corpora,\nwhere traditional supervised methods are infeasible.",

Search-based GI excels at navigating large\nprogram spaces, but operates primarily at the syntactic level. In contrast,\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) offer semantic-aware edits, yet lack goal-directed\nfeedback and control (which is instead a strength of GI). As such, we propose\nthe investigation of a new research line on AI-powered GI aimed at\nincorporating semantic aware search. We take a first step at it by augmenting\nGI with the use of automated clustering of LLM edits. We provide initial\nempirical evidence that our proposal, dubbed PatchCat, allows us to\nautomatically and effectively categorize LLM-suggested patches. PatchCat\nidentified 18 different types of software patches and categorized newly\nsuggested patches with high accuracy. It also enabled detecting NoOp edits in\nadvance and, prospectively, to skip test suite execution to save resources in\nmany cases. These results, coupled with the fact that PatchCat works with\nsmall, local LLMs, are a promising step toward interpretable, efficient, and\ngreen GI. We outline a rich agenda of future work and call for the community to\njoin our vision of building a principled understanding of LLM-driven mutations,\nguiding the GI search process with semantic signals.",

We employ both probabilistic\nand generated text-based metrics across nine benchmarks and evaluate models\nvarying in architecture family and reasoning ability. Our findings show that\nquantization has a nuanced impact on bias: while it can reduce model toxicity\nand does not significantly impact sentiment, it tends to slightly increase\nstereotypes and unfairness in generative tasks, especially under aggressive\ncompression. These trends are generally consistent across demographic\ncategories and model types, although their magnitude depends on the specific\nsetting.

The structured reservoir interacts with a charger battery model\nthrough three distinct configurations: (I) direct coupling between the\nreservoir qubits and the battery, (II) common coupling between the reservoir\nqubits, the charger, and the battery, and (III) common coupling between the\nreservoir qubits and the charger, together with a local charger battery\ninteraction. For both incoherent and coherent initial states, we analyze the\nstored energy, ergotropy, and charging power of the battery, and establish\nupper and lower bounds on the maximum extractable work of the battery based on\nthe free energy of coherence, and exchanged correlations between the\nsubsystems. Our results show that the nature of the interaction scenario and\nthe presence of coherence crucially determine the efficiency of charging and\nthe maximum ergotropy. We demonstrate that correlation exchange between\nsubsystems, quantified by the difference between global and local coherence,\nacts as a resource for work extraction. These findings provide a deeper\nunderstanding of coherence and population and structured environments as\nresources for autonomous quantum batteries, and offer experimentally accessible\npredictions within the regime of superconducting qubits.",

    "abstract": "Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) are critical for Positioning,\nNavigation, and Timing (PNT) applications. However, GNSS are highly vulnerable\nto spoofing attacks, where adversaries transmit counterfeit signals to mislead\nreceivers. Such attacks can lead to severe consequences, including misdirected\nnavigation, compromised data integrity, and operational disruptions. Most\nexisting spoofing detection methods depend on supervised learning techniques\nand struggle to detect novel, evolved, and unseen attacks. To overcome this\nlimitation, we develop a zero-day spoofing detection method using a Hybrid\nQuantum-Classical Autoencoder (HQC-AE), trained solely on authentic GNSS\nsignals without exposure to spoofed data. By leveraging features extracted\nduring the tracking stage, our method enables proactive detection before PNT\nsolutions are computed. We focus on spoofing detection in static GNSS\nreceivers, which are particularly susceptible to time-push spoofing attacks,\nwhere attackers manipulate timing information to induce incorrect time\ncomputations at the receiver. We evaluate our model against different unseen\ntime-push spoofing attack scenarios: simplistic, intermediate, and\nsophisticated. Our analysis demonstrates that the HQC-AE consistently\noutperforms its classical counterpart, traditional supervised learning-based\nmodels, and existing unsupervised learning-based methods in detecting zero-day,\nunseen GNSS time-push spoofing attacks, achieving an average detection accuracy\nof 97.71% with an average false negative rate of 0.62% (when an attack occurs\nbut is not detected). For sophisticated spoofing attacks, the HQC-AE attains an\naccuracy of 98.23% with a false negative rate of 1.85%. These findings\nhighlight the effectiveness of our method in proactively detecting zero-day\nGNSS time-push spoofing attacks across various stationary GNSS receiver\nplatforms.",

These are departures from an otherwise\npower-law-like continuum that steepens above $35\\,M_\\odot$. Binary black holes\nwith primary masses near $10\\,M_\\odot$ are more likely to have less massive\nsecondaries, with a mass ratio distribution peaking at $q =\n0.74^{+0.13}_{-0.13}$, potentially a signature of stable mass transfer during\nbinary evolution. Black hole spins are inferred to be non-extremal, with 90\\%\nof black holes having $\\chi < 0.57$, and preferentially aligned with binary\norbits, implying many merging binaries form in isolation. However, we find a\nsignificant fraction, 0.24--0.42, of binaries have negative effective inspiral\nspins, suggesting many could be formed dynamically in gas-free environments. We\nfind evidence for correlation between effective inspiral spin and mass ratio,\nthough it is unclear if this is driven by variation in the mode of the\ndistribution or the width. (Abridged)",

    "abstract": "Version 4.0 of the Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog (GWTC-4.0) adds new\ncandidates detected by the LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA observatories through the\nfirst part of the fourth observing run (O4a: 2023 May 24 15:00:00 to 2024\nJanuary 16 16:00:00 UTC) and a preceding engineering run. In this new data, we\nfind 128 new compact binary coalescence candidates that are identified by at\nleast one of our search algorithms with a probability of astrophysical origin\n$p_{\\rm astro} \\geq 0.5$ and that are not vetoed during event validation. We\nalso provide detailed source property measurements for 86 of these that have a\nfalse alarm rate $< 1 \\rm{yr}^{-1}$. Based on the inferred component masses,\nthese new candidates are consistent with signals from binary black holes and\nneutron star-black hole binaries (GW230518_125908 and GW230529_181500). Median\ninferred component masses of binary black holes in the catalog now range from\n$5.79\\,M_\\odot$ (GW230627_015337) to $137\\,M_\\odot$ (GW231123_135430), while\nGW231123_135430 was probably produced by the most massive binary observed in\nthe catalog. For the first time we have discovered binary black hole signals\nwith network signal-to-noise ratio exceeding 30, GW230814_230901 and\nGW231226_01520, enabling high-fidelity studies of the waveforms and\nastrophysical properties of these systems. Combined with the 90 candidates\nincluded in GWTC-3.0, the catalog now contains 218 candidates with $p_{\\rm\nastro} \\geq 0.5$ and not otherwise vetoed, doubling the size of the catalog and\nfurther opening our view of the gravitational-wave Universe.",

    "abstract": "The Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog (GWTC) is a collection of candidate\ngravitational-wave transient signals identified and characterized by the\nLIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration. Producing the contents of the GWTC from\ndetector data requires complex analysis methods. These comprise techniques to\nmodel the signal; identify the transients in the data; evaluate the quality of\nthe data and mitigate possible instrumental issues; infer the parameters of\neach transient; compare the data with the waveform models for compact binary\ncoalescences; and handle the large amount of results associated with all these\ndifferent analyses. In this paper, we describe the methods employed to produce\nthe catalog's fourth release, GWTC-4.0, focusing on the analysis of the first\npart of the fourth observing run of Advanced LIGO, Advanced Virgo and KAGRA.",

    "abstract": "The Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog (GWTC) is a collection of\nshort-duration (transient) gravitational wave signals identified by the\nLIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration in gravitational-wave data produced by the\neponymous detectors. The catalog provides information about the identified\ncandidates, such as the arrival time and amplitude of the signal and properties\nof the signal's source as inferred from the observational data. GWTC is the\ndata release of this dataset and version 4.0 extends the catalog to include\nobservations made during the first part of the fourth LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA\nobserving run up until 2024 January 31. This paper marks an introduction to a\ncollection of articles related to this version of the catalog, GWTC-4.0. The\ncollection of articles accompanying the catalog provides documentation of the\nmethods used to analyze the data, summaries of the catalog of events,\nobservational measurements drawn from the population, and detailed discussions\nof selected candidates",

    "abstract": "A fluid described by an Abelian Chern-Simons action principle in 4+1\ndimensions is considered. Letting 3+1 dimensions correspond to the usual space\nand time, and assuming the fields to be independent of the fifth coordinate,\nthe free theory provides an interpretation as a system of advection equations,\nwhere the advecting velocity field is defined as the null vector of the field\nstrength tensor (curvature). The free theory possesses a number of conservation\nlaws which turn out to be prototypical forms of helicity and entropy\nconservation. Coupling the Chern-Simons field to an external source, a new\nconserved charge density is obtained which has the form of the Rossby-Ertel's\npotential vorticity (PV). Finally, by identifying the external current with the\nChern-Simons field in a gauge-invariant setting, based on non-relativistic\nideas, a self-interacting action principle is obtained whose Euler-Lagrange\nequations correspond precisely to a classical dissipationless compressible\n(3+1)-dimensional fluid endowed with thermodynamics, with only one extra\ncondition: a constraint on the initial profile of the PV. After analysing this\nconstraint of the \"Chern-Simons fluid formulation\", we investigate the helicity\nconservation of general fluids, going beyond classical analyses of barotropic\nfluids and no-cross boundary conditions for vorticity (Moffatt 1969). A new\nfluid helicity invariant for barotropic fluids under generic boundary\nconditions is obtained and the role of baroclinity in the helicity production\nis clarified. Inside a region bounded by an isentropic surface, the theory's\nconstraint on the PV gives an integral formula for the mass, and for the\nevolution of fluid helicity in the baroclinic case. Finally, for an ideal gas\nexact, steady solutions of the equations of motion are found in a rotating\nscenario, showing that Ferrel-cell like patterns are produced in a rotating\nplanet.",

However, its practical implementation and\nscalability remain challenging. In contrast, the spatial superposition of\nquantum channels is more accessible experimentally and has been shown to\nenhance channel capacity, although it does not match the performance of the\nquantum switch. In this work, we present preliminary theoretical results\ndemonstrating that, by applying tools of the quantum random walk framework to\nthe spatial superposition of channels, it is possible to replicate the output\nof a quantum switch. These findings suggest a promising and more feasible route\nto emulate the quantum switch, offering both practical advantages and\ninterpretative clarity.",

Recently, large\nlanguage models as judges (LLJs) have emerged as a promising alternative to\ntraditional metrics, but their validity remains underexplored. This position\npaper argues that the current enthusiasm around LLJs may be premature, as their\nadoption has outpaced rigorous scrutiny of their reliability and validity as\nevaluators. Drawing on measurement theory from the social sciences, we identify\nand critically assess four core assumptions underlying the use of LLJs: their\nability to act as proxies for human judgment, their capabilities as evaluators,\ntheir scalability, and their cost-effectiveness. We examine how each of these\nassumptions may be challenged by the inherent limitations of LLMs, LLJs, or\ncurrent practices in NLG evaluation. To ground our analysis, we explore three\napplications of LLJs: text summarization, data annotation, and safety\nalignment. Finally, we highlight the need for more responsible evaluation\npractices in LLJs evaluation, to ensure that their growing role in the field\nsupports, rather than undermines, progress in NLG.",

To address the\nopen-set HSI classification challenge, current methods focus mainly on\ndistinguishing the unknown class samples from the known class samples and\nrejecting them to increase the accuracy of identifying known class samples.\nThey fails to further identify or discovery the unknow classes among the\nsamples. This paper proposes a prototype learning and clustering method for\ndiscoverying unknown classes in HSIs under the few-shot environment. Using few\nlabeled samples, it strives to develop the ability of infering the prototypes\nof unknown classes while distinguishing unknown classes from known classes.\nOnce the unknown class samples are rejected by the learned known class\nclassifier, the proposed method can further cluster the unknown class samples\ninto different classes according to their distance to the inferred unknown\nclass prototypes. Compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, extensive\nexperiments on four benchmark HSI datasets demonstrate that our proposed method\nexhibits competitive performance in open-set few-shot HSI classification tasks.\nAll the codes are available at \\href{https://github.com/KOBEN-ff/OpenFUCD-main}\n{https://github.com/KOBEN-ff/OpenFUCD-main}",

Understanding delay effects on human operational\nperformance and neurocognition is essential for resolving this issue. However,\nno previous research has explored this. To fill this gap, we conduct a\nhuman-in-the-loop experiment involving 10 participants, integrating\nelectroencephalography (EEG) and robot behavior data under varying delays\n(0-500 ms in 100 ms increments) to systematically investigate these effects.\nBehavior analysis reveals significant performance degradation at 200-300 ms\ndelays, affecting both task efficiency and accuracy. EEG analysis discovers\nfeatures with significant delay dependence: frontal $\\theta/\\beta$-band and\nparietal $\\alpha$-band power. We also identify a threshold window (100-200 ms)\nfor early perception of delay in humans, during which these EEG features first\nexhibit significant differences. When delay exceeds 400 ms, all features\nplateau, indicating saturation of cognitive resource allocation at\nphysiological limits. These findings provide the first evidence of perceptual\nand cognitive delay thresholds during teleoperation tasks in humans, offering\ncritical neurocognitive insights for the design of delay compensation\nstrategies.",

In this paper, we propose a new\nclass of regular black hole models sourced by a de Sitter vacuum with a finite\nradius. We focus on studying its horizonless configuration, which is modified\ninto an anisotropic gravastar by proposing an ansatz of equation of states. We\nconfirm that an anisotropic gravastar approaching horizon formation must\nviolate the dominant energy condition. We also found that the proposed object\nhas an effectively similar structure as a frozen star on the time geometry at\nthe extremal configuration. From the proposed model, we investigate the photon\ngeodesics inside the object and predict the optical appearance of the object\nsurrounded by a thin accretion disk. Our imaging results indicate that,\nassuming light does not interact with the object's interior, its optical\nappearance differs from that of a thin-shell gravastar. ``Chaotic\" photon ring\nmerges for $x>x_{m}$, where $x_{m}$ represents the minimum value required for\nthe photon sphere to exist. In addition to its optical appearance, we\ninvestigate the axial gravitational perturbations emitted by this horizonless\nstar. Notably, echo trains are found to exist for $x>x_{m}$, as determined by\nnumerically solving the time-dependent Regge-Wheeler equation. By comparing the\necho time with the GW170817 observation, we find that a frequency of 72 Hz can\nbe achieved, albeit at the cost of requiring a relatively high value of $\\ell$.",

    "abstract": "Simulating event streams from 3D scenes has become a common practice in\nevent-based vision research, as it meets the demand for large-scale, high\ntemporal frequency data without setting up expensive hardware devices or\nundertaking extensive data collections. Yet existing methods in this direction\ntypically work with noiseless RGB frames that are costly to render, and\ntherefore they can only achieve a temporal resolution equivalent to 100-300\nFPS, far lower than that of real-world event data. In this work, we propose\nEventTracer, a path tracing-based rendering pipeline that simulates\nhigh-fidelity event sequences from complex 3D scenes in an efficient and\nphysics-aware manner. Specifically, we speed up the rendering process via low\nsample-per-pixel (SPP) path tracing, and train a lightweight event spiking\nnetwork to denoise the resulting RGB videos into realistic event sequences. To\ncapture the physical properties of event streams, the network is equipped with\na bipolar leaky integrate-and-fired (BiLIF) spiking unit and trained with a\nbidirectional earth mover distance (EMD) loss. Our EventTracer pipeline runs at\na speed of about 4 minutes per second of 720p video, and it inherits the merit\nof accurate spatiotemporal modeling from its path tracing backbone. We show in\ntwo downstream tasks that EventTracer captures better scene details and\ndemonstrates a greater similarity to real-world event data than other event\nsimulators, which establishes it as a promising tool for creating large-scale\nevent-RGB datasets at a low cost, narrowing the sim-to-real gap in event-based\nvision, and boosting various application scenarios such as robotics, autonomous\ndriving, and VRAR.",

Moreover, conventional expertise metrics performed\npoorly--achieving only around 55% precision and 50% recall in identifying\ndevelopers engaged with variable code.

    "abstract": "Semantic segmentation of remote sensing (RS) images is pivotal for\ncomprehensive Earth observation, but the demand for interpreting new object\ncategories, coupled with the high expense of manual annotation, poses\nsignificant challenges. Although open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS)\noffers a promising solution, existing frameworks designed for natural images\nare insufficient for the unique complexities of RS data. They struggle with\nvast scale variations and fine-grained details, and their adaptation often\nrelies on extensive, costly annotations. To address this critical gap, this\npaper introduces SegEarth-OV, the first framework for annotation-free\nopen-vocabulary segmentation of RS images. Specifically, we propose SimFeatUp,\na universal upsampler that robustly restores high-resolution spatial details\nfrom coarse features, correcting distorted target shapes without any\ntask-specific post-training. We also present a simple yet effective Global Bias\nAlleviation operation to subtract the inherent global context from patch\nfeatures, significantly enhancing local semantic fidelity. These components\nempower SegEarth-OV to effectively harness the rich semantics of pre-trained\nVLMs, making OVSS possible in optical RS contexts. Furthermore, to extend the\nframework's universality to other challenging RS modalities like SAR images,\nwhere large-scale VLMs are unavailable and expensive to create, we introduce\nAlignEarth, which is a distillation-based strategy and can efficiently transfer\nsemantic knowledge from an optical VLM encoder to an SAR encoder, bypassing the\nneed to build SAR foundation models from scratch and enabling universal OVSS\nacross diverse sensor types. Extensive experiments on both optical and SAR\ndatasets validate that SegEarth-OV can achieve dramatic improvements over the\nSOTA methods, establishing a robust foundation for annotation-free and\nopen-world Earth observation.",

The two phases occupy domains of the same\nspatial dimension, separated by a moving interface defined by the trace of the\nporoelastic displacement, which exhibits low regularity and strong geometric\nnonlinearities. Despite its importance in applications, no existence theory has\nbeen available for this nonlinear moving-domain setting, primarily because the\nlack of interface regularity precludes even the formulation of a weak solution\nframework.\n  To address this gap, we (1) introduce a regularization of the Biot\ndisplacement via spatial convolution at scale $\\delta > 0$, which defines\nregularized moving domains and interface, and (2) modify the weak formulation\nin a way that preserves energy consistency with the original problem. For each\nfixed $\\delta > 0$, we prove existence of a weak solution to the resulting\nregularized interface problem. The proof strategy involves inserting a thin\nplate of thickness $h > 0$ at the interface, applying a time-discretization via\na Lie operator splitting scheme, establishing uniform a priori bounds, and\nemploying Aubin-Lions compactness on moving domains. The analysis is\nparticularly involved, partly because the thin plate allows displacements in\nall spatial directions. Passing to the limit $h \\to 0$ with uniform-in-h\nestimates and compactness arguments yields a regularized interface weak\nsolution. The regularization introduced in this manuscript is essential to\nmaintain uniform geometric control of the moving interface and to accommodate\nvector-valued structural displacements.",

This study aimed to stratify MCI subjects into distinct\nsubgroups with substantial difference in the risk of transitioning to AD by\nfusing multimodal brain imaging genetic data. The integrated imaging genetics\nmethod comprised three modules, i.e., the whole-genome-oriented risk genetic\ninformation extraction module (RGE), the genetic-to-brain mapping module\n(RG2PG), and the genetic-guided pseudo-brain fusion module (CMPF). We used data\nfrom AD Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and identified two MCI subtypes, called\nlow-risk MCI (lsMCI) and high-risk MCI (hsMCI). We also validated that the two\nsubgroups showed distinct patterns of in terms of multiple biomarkers including\ngenetics, demographics, fluid biomarkers, brain imaging features, clinical\nsymptoms and cognitive functioning at baseline, as well as their longitudinal\ndevelopmental trajectories.

Motivated by this, and in the context of the 1st\nSpeechWellness detection challenge, we explore a lightweight multi-branch\nmultimodal system based on a dynamic fusion mechanism for speechwellness\ndetection. To address the limitation of prior approaches that rely on\ntime-domain waveforms for acoustic analysis, our system incorporates both\ntime-domain and time-frequency (TF) domain acoustic features, as well as\nsemantic representations. In addition, we introduce a dynamic fusion block to\nadaptively integrate information from different modalities.

Our proposal consists of comparing two centroid estimates: the classical\nKarcher mean (sensitive to change) versus one defined from Huber's function\n(robust to change). This comparison leads to the definition of a test statistic\nwhose performance is less sensitive to the underlying estimation method. We\npropose a stochastic Riemannian optimization algorithm to estimate both robust\ncentroids efficiently. Experiments conducted on both simulated and real-world\ndata across two representative manifolds demonstrate the superior performance\nof our proposed method.",

    "abstract": "gem5 is a popular modular-based computer system simulator, widely used in\ncomputer architecture research and known for its long simulation time and steep\nlearning curve. This report examines its three major CPU models: the\nAtomicSimpleCPU (AS CPU), the TimingSimpleCPU (TS CPU), the Out-of-order (O3)\nCPU, and their interactions with the memory subsystem. We provide a detailed\nanatomical overview of each CPU's function call-chains and present how gem5\npartitions its execution time for each simulated hardware layer.\n  We perform our analysis using a lightweight profiler built on Linux's\nperf_event interface, with user-configurable options to target specific\nfunctions and examine their interactions in detail. By profiling each CPU\nacross a wide selection of benchmarks, we identify their software bottlenecks.\nOur results show that the Ruby memory subsystem consistently accounts for the\nlargest share of execution time in the sequential AS and TS CPUs, primarily\nduring the instruction fetch stage. In contrast, the O3 CPU spends a relatively\nsmaller fraction of time in Ruby, with most of its time devoted to constructing\ninstruction instances and the various pipeline stages of the CPU.\n  We believe that the anatomical view of each CPU's execution flow is valuable\nfor educational purposes, as it clearly illustrates the interactions among\nsimulated components. These insights form a foundation for optimizing gem5's\nperformance, particularly for the AS, TS, and O3 CPUs. Moreover, our framework\ncan be readily applied to analyze other gem5 components or to develop and\nevaluate new models.",

These interventions entail, for example, adjusting design\nvariables such as resonator lengths or Josephson junction energies to meet\ntarget parameters such as mode frequencies, decay rates, and coupling\nstrengths. Here, we present a method to efficiently automate the optimization\nof superconducting circuits, which significantly reduces the need for manual\nintervention. The method's efficiency arises from user-defined,\nphysics-informed, nonlinear models that guide parameter updates toward the\ndesired targets. Additionally, we provide a full implementation of our\noptimization method as an open-source Python package, QDesignOptimizer. The\npackage automates the design workflow by combining high-accuracy\nelectromagnetic simulations in Ansys HFSS and Energy Participation Ratio\n(pyEPR) analysis integrated with the design tool Qiskit-Metal. Our\nimplementation supports modular and flexible subsystem-level analysis and is\neasily extensible to optimize for additional parameters.

We show that rumor spreading can be made\nfaster at the cost of an increased amount of communication between the nodes.\nAs a motivating example, consider the process on a complete graph of $n$ nodes:\nwhile the standard PUSH&PULL protocol takes $\\Theta(\\log n)$ rounds, we prove\nthat our $k$-PUSH&PULL variant completes in $\\Theta(\\log_{k} n)$ rounds, with\nhigh probability.\n  We generalize this result in an expansion-sensitive way, as has been done for\nthe classic PUSH&PULL protocol for different notions of expansion, e.g.,\nconductance and vertex expansion.

In particular, when the\nexpansion parameter satisfies $\\phi > 1$, these graphs have a diameter of\n$o(\\log n)$, as opposed to other standard notions of expansion. Since the\ngraph's diameter is a lower bound on the number of rounds required for rumor\nspreading, this makes small-set expanders particularly well-suited for fast\ninformation dissemination.

Aims. We aim at studying the impact of\nadditional mixing processes on the asteroseismic modelling of Kepler Legacy G\nand F-type stars. We also investigate whether a single process can be invoked\nto reproduce the lithium depletion and asteroseismic constraints at the same\ntime. Methods. We use detailed asteroseismic modelling techniques combining\nglobal and local minimization techniques. We start by using standard models and\nthen aim at improving this solution by the addition of extra-mixing at the\nborder of convective regions using either convective penetration or turbulence\nin radiative layers. Results. We find that lower mass models ($\\sim 1M_\\odot$)\nhave no problem in reproducing the observed lithium depletion using only\nturbulence in the radiative zone, similarly to solar models. F-type stars,\nhaving a shallower convective envelope, are unaffected by additional turbulence\nat the BCZ, but require significant convective penetration values to actually\nreproduce the observed lithium depletion. The extent of this penetration is\nhowever incompatible with the frequency separation ratios. Conclusions. We\nconclude that the impact of extra-mixing is moderate for solar-type stars of\nthe Kepler Legacy sample and well within the requirements of the PLATO mission.\nFor more massive stars ($\\sim 1.5M_\\odot$), we conclude that the behaviour of\nthe frequency separation ratios must be further investigated, as even models\nwith large convective penetration at the base of their convective envelope are\nunable to reproduce them.",

    "abstract": "At the conclusion of Run 3 of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, the\naccelerator complex will be upgraded to the High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC),\nallowing it to increase the dataset sizes of LHC experiments by about a factor\nof 20. This significant increase in dataset size will improve the sensitivity\nand precision of all physics analyses from LHC experiments, but will come with\na more challenging data-taking environment. In order to handle this, the ATLAS\ndetector will undergo a substantial upgrade, including an upgrade of its inner\ntracker to an all-silicon tracker called the Inner Tracker (ITk), made of pixel\nand strip sub-detectors. During the pre-production phase of the ITk strips, it\nwas discovered that thermally cycling modules loaded onto local support\nstructures led to physical fractures in silicon sensors due to the induced\nthermal stress. This is understood to be the result of several factors,\nincluding the difference in coefficients of thermal expansion between the\ndifferent module layers, and the close proximity of the module electrical\ncomponents. Several mitigation strategies were tested to reduce the rate of\nmodule fracturing. This paper describes the assembly setup, testing setups, and\nelectrical testing results of ITk strips barrel modules loaded onto local\nsupport structures. 69 of 70 modules with an in-built additional kapton layer\nwere found to survive testing down to -70{\\deg}C.",

Still, the\nthermal electron component is commonly neglected when modelling the\nobservations, although it holds key informations on the shock properties. We\nmodel the broadband emission of the HSP blazar Mrk421 employing particle\ndistributions that include a thermal relativistic Maxwellian component at low\nenergies followed by a nonthermal power-law, as motivated by PIC simulations.\nThe observations in the optical/UV and MeV-GeV bands efficiently restrict the\nnonthermal emission from the Maxwellian electrons, which we use to derive\nconstraints on the basic properties, such as the fraction $\\epsilon_e$ of the\ntotal shock energy stored in the nonthermal electrons. The best-fit model\nyields a nonthermal electron power-law with an index of ~2.4, close to\npredictions from shock acceleration. Successful fits are obtained when the\nratio between the Lorentz factor at which the nonthermal distribution begins\n($\\gamma_{\\rm nth}$) and the dimensionless electron temperature ($\\theta$)\nsatisfies $\\gamma_{\\rm nth}/\\theta \\lesssim 8$. Since $\\gamma_{\\rm nth}/\\theta$\ncontrols $\\epsilon_e$, the latter limit implies that at least $\\epsilon_e\n\\approx 10\\%$ of the shock energy is transferred to the nonthermal electrons.\nThese results are almost insensitive to the shock velocity $\\gamma_{\\rm sh}$,\nbut radio observations indicate $\\gamma_{\\rm sh} \\gtrsim 5$ since for lower\nshock velocities the radio fluxes are overproduced by the Maxwellian electrons.\nIf shocks drive the particle energisation, our findings indicate that they\noperate in the mildly to fully relativistic regime with efficient electron\nacceleration.",

    "abstract": "In this PhD thesis, we propose a novel framework for uncertainty\nquantification in machine learning, which is based on proper scores.\nUncertainty quantification is an important cornerstone for trustworthy and\nreliable machine learning applications in practice. Usually, approaches to\nuncertainty quantification are problem-specific, and solutions and insights\ncannot be readily transferred from one task to another. Proper scores are loss\nfunctions minimized by predicting the target distribution. Due to their very\ngeneral definition, proper scores apply to regression, classification, or even\ngenerative modeling tasks. We contribute several theoretical results, that\nconnect epistemic uncertainty, aleatoric uncertainty, and model calibration\nwith proper scores, resulting in a general and widely applicable framework. We\nachieve this by introducing a general bias-variance decomposition for strictly\nproper scores via functional Bregman divergences. Specifically, we use the\nkernel score, a kernel-based proper score, for evaluating sample-based\ngenerative models in various domains, like image, audio, and natural language\ngeneration. This includes a novel approach for uncertainty estimation of large\nlanguage models, which outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Further, we\ngeneralize the calibration-sharpness decomposition beyond classification, which\nmotivates the definition of proper calibration errors. We then introduce a\nnovel estimator for proper calibration errors in classification, and a novel\nrisk-based approach to compare different estimators for squared calibration\nerrors. Last, we offer a decomposition of the kernel spherical score, another\nkernel-based proper score, allowing a more fine-grained and interpretable\nevaluation of generative image models.",

These planets lie firmly in the\nsuper-Earth and sub-Neptune mass regime, with (minimum) masses of $3.7, 5.7,\n\\textrm{and }4.9$ M$_{\\oplus}$, respectively. A long-period ($\\sim1500$ d)\nsignal is also strongly detected. Assessment of activity indicator\nperiodicities and RV correlations suggests that the three short-period signals\nare genuine planets, but casts doubt upon the nature of the long-period signal.\nThe origin may be a short stellar magnetic cycle, though additional data are\nrequired to fully sample the periodicity without intervening offsets. HD 28471\nb exhibits a more eccentric orbit than the other planets, which may be due to\ndynamical interaction, or a result of RV variation from an as-yet-undetected\n4th planet interior to this compact system. The detected planets lie close to a\nresonant configuration, indicating that the system may retain features of its\nnatal configuration, with convergent migration potentially responsible for\nevolving the planets onto such short-period orbits.",

Furthermore, we introduce an interactive\ntalking tree structure to represent dialogue state transitions, where each tree\nnode contains information such as child/parent/sibling nodes and the current\ncharacter's emotional state.

For this, we rely on a neural architecture which\nlearns the relation from a time value to the corresponding scalar field, based\non the keyframe examples, and reliably extends this relation to the\nnon-keyframe time steps. We show how augmenting this architecture with specific\ntopological losses exploiting the input diagrams both improves the geometrical\nand topological reconstruction of the non-keyframe time steps.

Applying\nthis methodology to compare between Stiles and Burch 1955 (SB1955) mean\nobserver CMFs and our previously published \"ICVIO\" mean observer CMFs, we\nidentified a \"yellow\" (short-wavelength suppressing) filter that effectively\ntransforms between these datasets.

A\ncore requirement for an effective DT is to act as a fast, accurate, and\nmaintainable surrogate of its physical counterpart, the physical twin (PT). To\nthis end, machine learning (ML) is frequently employed to (i) construct\nreal-time DT prototypes using efficient reduced-order models (ROMs) derived\nfrom high-fidelity simulations of the PT's nominal behavior, and (ii)\nspecialize these prototypes into DT instances by leveraging historical sensor\ndata from the target PT. Despite the broad applicability of ML, its use in DT\nengineering remains largely ad hoc. Indeed, while conventional ML pipelines\noften train a single model for a specific task, DTs typically require multiple,\ntask- and domain-dependent models. Thus, a more structured approach is required\nto design DTs.\n  In this paper, we introduce DesCartes Builder, an open-source tool to enable\nthe systematic engineering of ML-based pipelines for real-time DT prototypes\nand DT instances.

    "abstract": "Locating and grasping of objects by robots is typically performed using\nvisual sensors. Haptic feedback from contacts with the environment is only\nsecondary if present at all. In this work, we explored an extreme case of\nsearching for and grasping objects in complete absence of visual input, relying\non haptic feedback only. The main novelty lies in the use of contacts over the\ncomplete surface of a robot manipulator covered with sensitive skin. The search\nis divided into two phases: (1) coarse workspace exploration with the complete\nrobot surface, followed by (2) precise localization using the end-effector\nequipped with a force/torque sensor. We systematically evaluated this method in\nsimulation and on the real robot, demonstrating that diverse objects can be\nlocated, grasped, and put in a basket. The overall success rate on the real\nrobot for one object was 85.7% with failures mainly while grasping specific\nobjects. The method using whole-body contacts is six times faster compared to a\nbaseline that uses haptic feedback only on the end-effector. We also show\nlocating and grasping multiple objects on the table. This method is not\nrestricted to our specific setup and can be deployed on any platform with the\nability of sensing contacts over the entire body surface.

However, their performance in multi-agent path finding (MAPF) tasks has\nbeen less than satisfactory, with only a few studies exploring this area. MAPF\nis a complex problem requiring both planning and multi-agent coordination. To\nimprove the performance of LLM in MAPF tasks, we propose a novel framework,\nLLM-NAR, which leverages neural algorithmic reasoners (NAR) to inform LLM for\nMAPF. LLM-NAR consists of three key components: an LLM for MAPF, a pre-trained\ngraph neural network-based NAR, and a cross-attention mechanism. This is the\nfirst work to propose using a neural algorithmic reasoner to integrate GNNs\nwith the map information for MAPF, thereby guiding LLM to achieve superior\nperformance. LLM-NAR can be easily adapted to various LLM models. Both\nsimulation and real-world experiments demonstrate that our method significantly\noutperforms existing LLM-based approaches in solving MAPF problems.",

    "abstract": "The Markovian dynamics of open quantum systems is typically described through\nLindblad equations, which are derived from the Redfield equation via the full\nsecular approximation. The latter neglects the rotating terms in the master\nequation corresponding to pairs of jump operators with different Bohr\nfrequencies. However, for many physical systems this approximation breaks down,\nand thus a more accurate treatment of the slowly rotating terms is required.\nIndeed, more precise physical results can be obtained by performing the partial\nsecular approximation, which takes into account the relevant time scale\nassociated with each pair of jump operators and compares it with the time scale\narising from the system-environment coupling. In this work, we introduce a\ngeneral code for performing the partial secular approximation in the Redfield\nequation for structured open quantum systems. The code can be applied to a\ngeneric Hamiltonian of any multipartite system coupled to bosonic baths.\nMoreover, it can also reproduce the unified master equation, which captures the\nsame physical behavior as the Redfield equation under the partial secular\napproximation, but is mathematically guaranteed to generate a completely\npositive dynamical map. Finally, the code can compute both the local and global\nversion of the master equation for the same physical problem. We illustrate the\ncode by studying the steady-state heat flow in a structured open quantum system\ncomposed of two superconducting qubits, each coupled to a bosonic mode, which\nin turn interacts with a thermal bath. The results in this work can be employed\nfor the numerical study of a wide range of complex open quantum systems.",

By\ntuning spin-orbit torque relative to local pinning potentials, we reveal two\nregimes: incoherent flow, where mobile skyrmions scatter from pinned ones,\ninducing recoil dynamics with 3-20 ns relaxation, and coherent flow, where the\nlattice translates uniformly. Quantification of the reproducible post-pulse\nrelaxation trajectories via an inverse analyis method based on the Thiele\nequation yields the nanoscale AFM skyrmion-skyrmion scattering potential, which\ndecays exponentially with a range of 30 nm, in full agreement with\nmicromagnetic simulations.

The oldest result of this type, beyond the obvious\n$(1-x)^{a}(1-x)^{b}=(1-x)^{a+b}$, is Euler's transformation for the Gauss\nhypergeometric function ${}_2F_1$. Another important one is the celebrated\nClausen's identity dated 1828 which expresses the square of a suitable\n${}_2F_1$ function as a single ${}_3F_2$. By equating coefficients each product\nidentity corresponds to a special type of summation theorem for terminating\nseries.

To bridge this gap, we\nfirst establish FGLive-10K, a comprehensive fine-grained BIQA database\ncontaining 10,185 high-resolution images captured under varying camera\nparameter configurations across diverse livestreaming scenarios.

Empirical results show that MoveScanner achieved 88.2%\ndetection accuracy in benchmark testing, filling the gap in security tools in\nthe Move ecosystem.

A new\nexpression for the ponderomotive force (PF) -- which acts as the main driver of\nTHz radiation at the vacuum-plasma boundary -- is derived to capture the\nhitherto unexplored effects of phase asymmetry intrinsic to the M-pulse, in\ncontrast to a single B-pulse where its phase is irrelevant.

In contrast, Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) are\nspecifically designed for complex, step-by-step reasoning, although they come\nwith significant computational costs and slower inference times. To address\nthese trade-offs, we employ and generalize the SOFAI (Slow and Fast AI)\ncognitive architecture into SOFAI-LM, which coordinates a fast LLM with a\nslower but more powerful LRM through metacognition. The metacognitive module\nactively monitors the LLM's performance and provides targeted, iterative\nfeedback with relevant examples. This enables the LLM to progressively refine\nits solutions without requiring the need for additional model fine-tuning.\nExtensive experiments on graph coloring and code debugging problems demonstrate\nthat our feedback-driven approach significantly enhances the problem-solving\ncapabilities of the LLM. In many instances, it achieves performance levels that\nmatch or even exceed those of standalone LRMs while requiring considerably less\ntime. Additionally, when the LLM and feedback mechanism alone are insufficient,\nwe engage the LRM by providing appropriate information collected during the\nLLM's feedback loop, tailored to the specific characteristics of the problem\ndomain and leads to improved overall performance. Evaluations on two\ncontrasting domains: graph coloring, requiring globally consistent solutions,\nand code debugging, demanding localized fixes, demonstrate that SOFAI-LM\nenables LLMs to match or outperform standalone LRMs in accuracy while\nmaintaining significantly lower inference time.",

    "abstract": "Semantic communication (SemCom) has emerged as a promising paradigm for\nachieving unprecedented communication efficiency in sixth-generation (6G)\nnetworks by leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) to extract and transmit the\nunderlying meanings of source data. However, deploying SemCom over digital\nsystems presents new challenges, particularly in ensuring robustness against\ntransmission errors that may distort semantically critical content. To address\nthis issue, this paper proposes a novel framework, termed generative feature\nimputing, which comprises three key techniques. First, we introduce a spatial\nerror concentration packetization strategy that spatially concentrates feature\ndistortions by encoding feature elements based on their channel mappings, a\nproperty crucial for both the effectiveness and reduced complexity of the\nsubsequent techniques. Second, building on this strategy, we propose a\ngenerative feature imputing method that utilizes a diffusion model to\nefficiently reconstruct missing features caused by packet losses. Finally, we\ndevelop a semantic-aware power allocation scheme that enables unequal error\nprotection by allocating transmission power according to the semantic\nimportance of each packet. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed\nframework outperforms conventional approaches, such as Deep Joint\nSource-Channel Coding (DJSCC) and JPEG2000, under block fading conditions,\nachieving higher semantic accuracy and lower Learned Perceptual Image Patch\nSimilarity (LPIPS) scores.",

We investigate a dark energy model with a\nphenomenological interaction in the dark sector, constructed to be exactly\ndegenerate at the background level with the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL)\nparameterization. This setup allows us to test whether models with identical\nexpansion histories but distinct physical mechanisms can be distinguished by\ncosmological data. We perform a Bayesian analysis using a combination of recent\ndatasets: DESI DR2 BAO measurements, DESY5 supernovae, and CMB data from Planck\nand ACT. We find that both the interacting model and the CPL model provide\nsignificantly better fits to the data than $\\Lambda$CDM. Although\nindistinguishable in background observables, the interacting model predicts a\ndistinct matter-sector evolution driven by a late-time sign change in the dark\nsector interaction at $z \\approx 0.8$, corresponding to the $w=-1$ crossing in\nthe CPL description. In this sense, the interacting picture may be considered\nmore physical, since it avoids the problematic crossing by construction. The\nresulting decay of dark energy into dark matter lowers $S_8$, potentially\nalleviating the weak-lensing $S_8$ tension. At the same time, it predicts a\nsharp suppression of the growth rate $f\\sigma_8(z)$ at $z \\lesssim 0.8$, which\nis in tension with current measurements of structure formation. This indicates\nthat the model may not simultaneously reconcile the expansion history and the\nobserved growth of cosmic structure, highlighting the need for a more\ncomprehensive analysis to fully assess its viability.",

To address this, the\nsynchrosqueezed chirplet transform (SCT) and multiple SCT methods were\nproposed, achieving moderate improvements in IF and chirprate estimation\naccuracy. Nevertheless, a novel approach is still needed to enhance the\ntransform's decay along the chirprate direction.\n  This paper introduces an X-ray transform-based wavelet-chirprate transform,\ntermed the X-ray wavelet-chirplet transform (XWCT), which exhibits superior\ndecay along the chirprate direction compared to the WCT. Furthermore,\nthird-order synchrosqueezed variants of the WCT and XWCT are developed to yield\nsharp time-frequency-chirprate representations of signals. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that the XWCT achieves significantly faster decay along the\nchirprate axis, while the third-order synchrosqueezed XWCT enables accurate IF\nand chirprate estimation, as well as mode retrieval, without requiring multiple\nsynchrosqueezing operations.",

Zero\nTouch Network (ZTN) management has emerged as a key approach to automating\nnetwork operations, minimizing manual intervention, and improving service\nreliability. Digital Twin (DT) creates a virtual representation of the physical\nnetwork in realtime, allowing continuous monitoring, predictive analytics, and\nintelligent decision-making by simulating what-if scenarios. This paper\nintegrates DT with ZTN proactive bandwidth management in end-to-end (E2E)\nnext-generation networks. The integrated architecture applies Few-Shot Learning\n(FSL) to a memoryaugmented Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory (BiLSTM) model\nto predict a new network state to augment the known and trained states. Using\nQ-learning, it determines the optimal action (e.g. traffic shaping) under\nvarying network conditions such that user Quality of Service (QoS) requirements\nare met. Three scenarios have been considered: 1) normal ZTN operation with\nclosed-loop control, 2) a what-if scenario of DT, and 3) network state unknown\nto DT. The simulation results show that the network can adapt to underlying\nchanging conditions. In addition, DT-assisted ZTN achieves better performance\nthan the other techniques.",

Although recent advances in financial sentiment\nanalysis have integrated multi-modal signals, such as textual content and vocal\ntone, most systems rely on flat document-level or sentence-level models,\nfailing to capture the layered discourse structure of these interactions. This\npaper introduces a novel multi-modal framework designed to generate\nsemantically rich and structurally aware embeddings of earnings calls, by\nencoding them as hierarchical discourse trees. Each node, comprising either a\nmonologue or a question-answer pair, is enriched with emotional signals derived\nfrom text, audio, and video, as well as structured metadata including coherence\nscores, topic labels, and answer coverage assessments. A two-stage transformer\narchitecture is proposed: the first encodes multi-modal content and discourse\nmetadata at the node level using contrastive learning, while the second\nsynthesizes a global embedding for the entire conference. Experimental results\nreveal that the resulting embeddings form stable, semantically meaningful\nrepresentations that reflect affective tone, structural logic, and thematic\nalignment. Beyond financial reporting, the proposed system generalizes to other\nhigh-stakes unscripted communicative domains such as tele-medicine, education,\nand political discourse, offering a robust and explainable approach to\nmulti-modal discourse representation.

However, as DTs take active roles in\ncontrol loops, securely binding them to their physical counterparts in dynamic\nand adversarial environments remains a significant challenge. Existing\nauthentication solutions either rely on static trust models, require\ncentralised authorities, or fail to provide live and verifiable\nphysical-digital binding, making them unsuitable for latency-sensitive and\ndistributed deployments. To address this gap, we introduce PRZK-Bind, a\nlightweight and decentralised authentication protocol that combines\nSchnorr-based zero-knowledge proofs with elliptic curve cryptography to\nestablish secure, real-time correspondence between physical entities and DTs\nwithout relying on pre-shared secrets. Simulation results show that PRZK-Bind\nsignificantly improves performance, offering up to 4.5 times lower latency and\n4 times reduced energy consumption compared to cryptography-heavy baselines,\nwhile maintaining false acceptance rates more than 10 times lower.

However, this standard design is neither\nincentive-compatible nor very statistically efficient. The main culprit is\nnoise in outcomes/labels that experts are scored against; it allows weaker\ncompetitors to often win by chance, and the winner-take-all nature incentivizes\nmisreporting that improves win probability even if it decreases expected score.\nAttempts to achieve incentive-compatibility rely on randomized mechanisms that\nadd even more noise in winner selection, but come at the cost of determinism\nand practical adoption. To tackle these issues, we introduce a novel\ndeterministic mechanism: WOMAC (Wisdom of the Most Accurate Crowd). Instead of\nscoring experts against noisy outcomes, as is standard, WOMAC scores experts\nagainst the best ex-post aggregate of peer experts' predictions given the noisy\noutcomes. WOMAC is also more efficient than the standard competition design in\ntypical settings. While the increased complexity of WOMAC makes it challenging\nto analyze incentives directly, we provide a clear theoretical foundation to\njustify the mechanism. We also provide an efficient vectorized implementation\nand demonstrate empirically on real-world forecasting datasets that WOMAC is a\nmore reliable predictor of experts' out-of-sample performance relative to the\nstandard mechanism.

With recent advancements in deep learning,\nNeural Weather Models (NeWMs) have emerged as competent medium-range NWP\nemulators, with performances that compare favorably to state-of-the-art NWP\nmodels. However, they are commonly trained on reanalyses with limited spatial\nresolution (e.g., 0.25{\\deg} horizontal grid spacing), which smooths out key\nfeatures of weather systems. For example, tropical cyclones (TCs)-among the\nmost impactful weather events due to their devastating effects on human\nactivities-are challenging to forecast, as extrema like wind gusts, used as\nproxies for TC intensity, are smoothed in deterministic forecasts at 0.25{\\deg}\nresolution. To address this, we use our best observational estimates of wind\ngusts and minimum sea level pressure to train a hierarchy of post-processing\nmodels on NeWM outputs. Applied to Pangu-Weather and FourCastNet v2, the\npost-processing models produce accurate and reliable forecasts of TC intensity\nup to five days ahead. Our post-processing algorithm is tracking-independent,\npreventing full misses, and we demonstrate that even linear models extract\npredictive information from NeWM outputs beyond what is encoded in their\ninitial conditions. While spatial masking improves probabilistic forecast\nconsistency, we do not find clear advantages of convolutional architectures\nover simple multilayer perceptrons for our NeWM post-processing purposes.\nOverall, by combining the efficiency of NeWMs with a lightweight,\ntracking-independent post-processing framework, our approach improves the\naccessibility of global TC intensity forecasts, marking a step toward their\ndemocratization.",

This paper proposes a framework inspired by\nthe Orthogonal Defect Classification (ODC) paradigm and enables defect analysis\nof Artificial Intelligence systems while recognizing its special attributes and\ncharacteristics. This study demonstrated the feasibility of modifying ODC for\nAI systems to classify its defects. The ODC was adjusted to accommodate the\nData, Learning, and Thinking aspects of AI systems which are newly introduced\nclassification dimensions. This adjustment involved the introduction of an\nadditional attribute to the ODC attributes, the incorporation of a new severity\nlevel, and the substitution of impact areas with characteristics pertinent to\nAI systems. The framework was showcased by applying it to a publicly available\nMachine Learning bug dataset, with results analyzed through one-way and two-way\nanalysis. The case study indicated that defects occurring during the Learning\nphase were the most prevalent and were significantly linked to high-severity\nclassifications.

    "abstract": "Current holographic research mostly focuses on a subset of quantum systems\nwith a classical gravity dual. Although the precise boundary of this subset\nremains unknown, certain constraints are recognized; for instance, holographic\nentropies obey inequalities that are violated by general quantum states such as\nthe GHZ states. This paper, however, presents a gravity dual for GHZ states --\na non-ordinary geometry termed the booklet wormhole. We demonstrate an exact\nmatch for all entropy properties with the GHZ state, as well as the identity of\nthe Euclidean partition functions for both systems. The booklet wormhole\ncircumvents the conventional holographic entropy inequalities because different\ntopologies are inevitably included in the gravitational path integral, even in\nthe large-$N$ limit. This provides the first explicit holographic duality with\na non-perturbative quantum effect. Remarkably, the construction is simple and\nmaximally entangled, making it ideal for gedanken experiments.",

Practical applications of such systems\ninclude medical assistance as well as human-machine interactions. A VSR system\nis typically employed in a complementary role in cases where the audio is\ncorrupt or not available. In order to accurately predict the spoken words,\nthese architectures often rely on deep neural networks in order to extract\nmeaningful representations from the input sequence. While deep architectures\nachieve impressive recognition performance, relying on such models incurs\nsignificant computation costs which translates into increased resource demands\nin terms of hardware requirements and results in limited applicability in\nreal-world scenarios where resources might be constrained.

Centrifugal effects induced by rotation\ndegrade phase coherence and impair AQUID performance, which we mitigate by\napplying a counteracting harmonic confinement. Phase slips are found to be\nmediated by a vortex propagating from the central depletion zone to the edge of\nthe condensate. To characterize the voltage response, we induce a bias current\nby translating the box along its long axis while keeping the central barrier\nfixed. This generates a density imbalance between the two reservoirs,\nexhibiting a periodic dependence on angular velocity -- analogous to the\nvoltage-flux relation in electronic SQUIDs.

To address issues such as low prediction accuracy and slow\nreal-time updates in existing models, which lead to lagging prediction results,\nwe propose a Transformer-based spatiotemporal data prediction method\n(Ada-TransGNN) that integrates global spatial semantics and temporal behavior.\nThe model constructs an efficient and collaborative spatiotemporal block set\ncomprising a multi-head attention mechanism and a graph convolutional network\nto extract dynamically changing spatiotemporal dependency features from complex\nair quality monitoring data. Considering the interaction relationships between\ndifferent monitoring points, we propose an adaptive graph structure learning\nmodule, which combines spatiotemporal dependency features in a data-driven\nmanner to learn the optimal graph structure, thereby more accurately capturing\nthe spatial relationships between monitoring points. Additionally, we design an\nauxiliary task learning module that enhances the decoding capability of\ntemporal relationships by integrating spatial context information into the\noptimal graph structure representation, effectively improving the accuracy of\nprediction results.

Compared with previous token pruning approaches,\nour method can preserve more visual information while compressing visual\ntokens. We first propose a graph-based visual token aggregation (VTA) module.\nVTA treats each visual token as a node, forming a graph based on semantic\nsimilarity among visual tokens. It then aggregates information from removed\ntokens into kept tokens based on this graph, producing a more compact visual\ntoken representation. Additionally, we introduce a group-wise token selection\nstrategy (GTS) to divide visual tokens into kept and removed ones, guided by\ntext tokens from the final layers of each group. This strategy progressively\naggregates visual information, enhancing the stability of the visual\ninformation extraction process. We conduct comprehensive experiments on\nLLaVA-1.5, LLaVA-NeXT, and Video-LLaVA across various benchmarks to validate\nthe efficacy of VISA. Our method consistently outperforms previous methods,\nachieving a superior trade-off between model performance and inference speed.\nThe code is available at https://github.com/mobiushy/VISA.",

Given limited energy resources, WSNs must operate efficiently to\nensure long-term performance. Their deployment, however, is challenged by\ndynamic environments where EH conditions, network scale, and traffic rates\nchange over time. In this work, we address system dynamics that yield different\nlearning tasks, where decision variables remain fixed but strategies vary, as\nwell as learning domains, where both decision space and strategies evolve. To\nhandle such scenarios, we propose a cross-domain lifelong reinforcement\nlearning (CD-L2RL) framework for energy-efficient WSN design. Our CD-L2RL\nalgorithm leverages prior experience to accelerate adaptation across tasks and\ndomains. Unlike conventional approaches based on Markov decision processes or\nLyapunov optimization, which assume relatively stable environments, our\nsolution achieves rapid policy adaptation by reusing knowledge from past tasks\nand domains to ensure continuous operations. We validate the approach through\nextensive simulations under diverse conditions. Results show that our method\nimproves adaptation speed by up to 35% over standard reinforcement learning and\nup to 70% over Lyapunov-based optimization, while also increasing total\nharvested energy.

The specific form of\nthis model is expressed as $H^{2}(z) = H^{2}_{\\rm \\Lambda CDM}(\\Omega_m,\nz)[1+\\delta(z)]$. We consider three forms of $\\delta(z)$: model I,\n$\\delta(z)=\\delta_c$; model II, $\\delta(z)=\\delta_{c}z/(1+z)$, and model III,\n$\\delta(z)=\\delta_{c}{\\rm ln}(1+z)$. Here, $\\delta_c$ represents a constant\nvalue. To constrain the models, we utilize a comprehensive set of observational\ndata, including DESI BAO, CMB, CC, SNIa data, and the $H_0$ measured by the\nSH0ES. Our results show that for most combined datasets, $\\delta_c$ tends to\ntake on negative values for models I and II, while consistently taking positive\nvalues in model III. Our analysis further discloses that for model I, in which\nthe deviation parameter is redshift-independent, there is a notable 2$\\sigma$\ndeviation from the $\\Lambda$CDM model when considering the combined datasets of\nDESI BAO+CMB+CC+SH0ES. However, this deviation decreases to less than $2\\sigma$\nonce SNIa datasets are included. In contrast, model II remains consistent with\nthe standard $\\Lambda$CDM model across all datasets examined. Model III\nexhibits a significant deviation from the $\\Lambda$CDM model, exceeding\n$2\\sigma$ and reaching $3\\sigma$ for the full combined datastes. The Akaike\nInformation Criterion indicates that models I and II are consistent with the\n$\\Lambda$CDM model, whereas model III is preferred over the standard\n$\\Lambda$CDM model, with the $\\Lambda$CDM model being substantially disfavored\nfor the combined datasets DESI BAO+CMB+CC+SH0ES+DESY5.

As PAHs are strong\nabsorbers of UV radiation, they contribute to the heating of the discs\nphotosphere, shielding of UV radiation that drives photo-chemistry in the disc,\nand their abundance is a key parameter to determine the strength of\nphoto-evaporative disc winds. We want to understand the photochemical evolution\nof PAHs in protoplanetary discs around T Tauri stars and thus explain the\nabsence of PAH features. We want to determine whether PAHs are destroyed\nbecause of the X-ray emission from their host stars or whether PAHs can\nwithstand these conditions. We developed a model for the absorption of X-rays\nby PAHs. X-rays with more energy than the K edge of carbon will double ionise\nPAHs and will vibrationally excite them by ~ 15-35 eV. With a Monte Carlo\nmodel, we modelled the dissociation of H, H2, and C2H2 from PAH monomers.\nFurthermore, we modelled the dissociation of PAH clusters and the desorption of\nPAH clusters from dust grains caused by X-ray excitation. We find that small\nPAH clusters will quickly desorb and dissociate into individual molecules. PAH\nmolecules experience rapid loss of H and acetylene C2H2 by the high excitation\nand will lose C2H2 on average after three X-ray excitations. However, large PAH\nclusters can stay intact and frozen out on dust grains. Based on our results,\nwe expect a gas-phase PAH abundance that is lower than 0.01 times the ISM\nabundance and will rapidly decrease over time due to the dissociation of small\nclusters that are subsequently destroyed. To maintain a higher abundance,\nreplenishment processes must exist such as vertical mixing. Large PAH clusters\nremain in the disc, frozen out on dust grains, but barely emit PAH features\nbecause of their strong thermal coupling to dust grains.",

In contrast, label smoothing\n(LS) has been widely recognized as an effective regularization technique that\nprevents models from becoming over-confident and improves their generalization.\nThis inspires us to explore the integration of LS with prompt tuning. However,\nwe have observed that the vanilla LS even weakens the generalization ability of\nprompt tuning. To address this issue, we propose the Alternating Training-based\nLabel Smoothing (ATLaS) method, which alternately trains with standard one-hot\nlabels and soft labels generated by LS to supervise the prompt tuning.\nMoreover, we introduce two types of efficient offline soft labels, including\nClass-wise Soft Labels (CSL) and Instance-wise Soft Labels (ISL), to provide\ninter-class or instance-class relationships for prompt tuning. The theoretical\nproperties of the proposed ATLaS method are analyzed.

Traditional input modalities, such as\nApex Frame, Optical Flow, and Dynamic Image, often fail to adequately capture\nthese brief facial movements, resulting in suboptimal performance. In this\nstudy, we introduce the Micro-expression Spatio-Temporal Image (MESTI), a novel\ndynamic input modality that transforms a video sequence into a single image\nwhile preserving the essential characteristics of micro-movements.\nAdditionally, we present the Micro-expression Gradient Attention Network\n(MEGANet), which incorporates a novel Gradient Attention block to enhance the\nextraction of fine-grained motion features from micro-expressions. By combining\nMESTI and MEGANet, we aim to establish a more effective approach to MER.\nExtensive experiments were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of MESTI,\ncomparing it with existing input modalities across three CNN architectures\n(VGG19, ResNet50, and EfficientNetB0). Moreover, we demonstrate that replacing\nthe input of previously published MER networks with MESTI leads to consistent\nperformance improvements. The performance of MEGANet, both with MESTI and\nDynamic Image, is also evaluated, showing that our proposed network achieves\nstate-of-the-art results on the CASMEII and SAMM datasets. The combination of\nMEGANet and MESTI achieves the highest accuracy reported to date, setting a new\nbenchmark for micro-expression recognition. These findings underscore the\npotential of MESTI as a superior input modality and MEGANet as an advanced\nrecognition network, paving the way for more effective MER systems in a variety\nof applications.",

To save on\nannotation costs, previous works leverage the semi-supervised COD framework\nthat relies on a small number of labeled data and a large volume of unlabeled\ndata. We argue that there is still significant room for improvement in the\neffective utilization of unlabeled data. To this end, we introduce a\nSemi-supervised Camouflaged Object Detection by Utilizing Text and Adaptive\nData Selection (SCOUT). It includes an Adaptive Data Augment and Selection\n(ADAS) module and a Text Fusion Module (TFM). The ADSA module selects valuable\ndata for annotation through an adversarial augment and sampling strategy. The\nTFM module further leverages the selected valuable data by combining\ncamouflage-related knowledge and text-visual interaction. To adapt to this\nwork, we build a new dataset, namely RefTextCOD. Extensive experiments show\nthat the proposed method surpasses previous semi-supervised methods in the COD\nfield and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

In a recent paper,\nBa\\v{s}i\\'c, Fowler and Pisanski proved that the automorphism group of a nut\ngraph has more orbits on the edge set than on the vertex set. They classified\nall orders for which a vertex-transitive nut graph with precisely two edge\norbits exists, and conjectured that a nut graph with two vertex and three edge\norbits exists for each non-prime order $n \\ge 9$. Motivated by this conjecture,\nwe introduce a very general construction that provides graphs with the desired\nsymmetry properties, and we determine some sufficient spectral and structural\nconditions under which they are nut graphs. The construction yields infinite\nfamilies of examples and confirms the above conjecture for all odd non-prime\norders up to $2\\,500$ and for at least $99.8$ percent of all odd non-prime\norders up to a million. Finally, we present some additional interesting\nexamples of nut graphs with two vertex and three edge orbits that do not arise\nfrom this construction.",

    "abstract": "Audio signal processing algorithms are frequently assessed through subjective\nlistening tests in which participants directly score degraded signals on a\nunidimensional numerical scale. However, this approach is susceptible to\ninconsistencies in scale calibration between assessors. Pairwise comparisons\nbetween degraded signals offer a more intuitive alternative, eliciting the\nrelative scores of candidate signals with lower measurement error and reduced\nparticipant fatigue. Yet, due to the quadratic growth of the number of\nnecessary comparisons, a complete set of pairwise comparisons becomes\nunfeasible for large datasets. This paper compares pairwise comparison\nprocedures to identify the most efficient methods for approximating true\nquality scores with minimal comparisons. A novel sampling procedure is proposed\nand benchmarked against state-of-the-art methods on simulated datasets.\nBayesian sampling produces the most robust score estimates among previously\nestablished methods, while the proposed procedure consistently converges\nfastest on the underlying ranking with comparable score accuracy.",

Coupling to electronic domains\nprovides an observable for pinpointing key interactions, e.g. affecting phase\ntransitions. While the equilibrium phase diagram of 1T-TaS2 - characterized by\nunique transport properties and varying degrees of CDW commensurability - has\nbeen studied extensively, an understanding of how the electronic domains in the\nbulk behave across phase boundaries is lacking. We reveal the three-dimensional\nevolution of electronic domains in 1T-TaS2 using temperature-dependent X-ray\ndiffraction and reciprocal space mapping, complemented by structure factor\nsimulations based on the Hendricks-Teller method. With this methodology, we\nidentify an increasing number of stacking faults near the phase transitions,\nand a growing fraction of dimerized layers in the commensurate phase upon\ncooling. We provide structural evidence that the CDW domains mediate the\ntransport properties at phase boundaries, and that they also account for an\nanomalous intermediate electronic phase within the triclinic regime upon\nheating. As a paradigmatic material with potential in phase-change memory\napplications, our study underscores the importance of domain sizes and layer\nstacking in defining electronic behaviors of van der Waals materials.",

In contrast, the energy\nconservation law requires energy to be summed in the quadratic form of the EM\nfields. The mathematical discrepancy of the two laws can lead to different\nphysical results. Specifically, when two co-phase radiation dipoles are placed\nin close proximity, their radiation waves undergo a co-phase interference\nthroughout space, therefore causing a net increase in wave's power globally. In\nthe exploration of this, we find that the SL applies not only to waves, but\nalso to the radiation dipoles.

We charactersize a phase transition in a\ncoupled oscillators model where interactions are not local in nature. At a\nfirst order transition i.e an abrupt jump in order parameter, we obtain the\norder parameter scaling exponent $1/2$ and show that the relaxation time\ndiverges near the transition point, both numerically and analytically. We also\nverify a finite time finite size scaling by considering a correlation measure\nin the discrete set of all interacting units. Due to divergence in correlation\nmeasure at the transition point, the order parameter becomes a homogeneous\nfunction of all the relevent parameters. The homogeneity assumption is\nnumerically verified using data collapse method. Various finite size scaling\nrelations and exponents are also obtained. This study suggests that presence of\nnon local interactions may allow for critical behaviour at a first order\ntransition.",

    "abstract": "Realistic 3D indoor scene generation is crucial for virtual reality, interior\ndesign, embodied intelligence, and scene understanding. While existing methods\nhave made progress in coarse-scale furniture arrangement, they struggle to\ncapture fine-grained object placements, limiting the realism and utility of\ngenerated environments. This gap hinders immersive virtual experiences and\ndetailed scene comprehension for embodied AI applications. To address these\nissues, we propose Hierarchical Layout Generation (HLG), a novel method for\nfine-grained 3D scene generation. HLG is the first to adopt a coarse-to-fine\nhierarchical approach, refining scene layouts from large-scale furniture\nplacement to intricate object arrangements. Specifically, our fine-grained\nlayout alignment module constructs a hierarchical layout through vertical and\nhorizontal decoupling, effectively decomposing complex 3D indoor scenes into\nmultiple levels of granularity. Additionally, our trainable layout optimization\nnetwork addresses placement issues, such as incorrect positioning, orientation\nerrors, and object intersections, ensuring structurally coherent and physically\nplausible scene generation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach\nthrough extensive experiments, showing superior performance in generating\nrealistic indoor scenes compared to existing methods. This work advances the\nfield of scene generation and opens new possibilities for applications\nrequiring detailed 3D environments. We will release our code upon publication\nto encourage future research.",

    "abstract": "As drone use has become more widespread, there is a critical need to ensure\nsafety and security. A key element of this is robust and accurate drone\ndetection and localization. While cameras and other optical sensors like LiDAR\nare commonly used for object detection, their performance degrades under\nadverse lighting and environmental conditions. Therefore, this has generated\ninterest in finding more reliable alternatives, such as millimeter-wave\n(mmWave) radar. Recent research on mmWave radar object detection has\npredominantly focused on 2D detection of road users. Although these systems\ndemonstrate excellent performance for 2D problems, they lack the sensing\ncapability to measure elevation, which is essential for 3D drone detection. To\naddress this gap, we propose CubeDN, a single-stage end-to-end radar object\ndetection network specifically designed for flying drones. CubeDN overcomes\nchallenges such as poor elevation resolution by utilizing a dual radar\nconfiguration and a novel deep learning pipeline. It simultaneously detects,\nlocalizes, and classifies drones of two sizes, achieving decimeter-level\ntracking accuracy at closer ranges with overall $95\\%$ average precision (AP)\nand $85\\%$ average recall (AR). Furthermore, CubeDN completes data processing\nand inference at 10Hz, making it highly suitable for practical applications.",

    "abstract": "Objective: Robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery (RMIS) has become the\ngold standard for a variety of surgical procedures, but the optimal method of\ntraining surgeons for RMIS is unknown. We hypothesized that real-time, rather\nthan post-task, error feedback would better increase learning speed and reduce\nerrors. Methods: Forty-two surgical novices learned a virtual version of the\nring-on-wire task, a canonical task in RMIS training. We investigated the\nimpact of feedback timing with multi-sensory (haptic and visual) cues in three\ngroups: (1) real-time error feedback, (2) trial replay with error feedback, and\n(3) no error feedback. Results: Participant performance was evaluated based on\nthe accuracy of ring position and orientation during the task. Participants who\nreceived real-time feedback outperformed other groups in ring orientation.\nAdditionally, participants who received feedback in replay outperformed\nparticipants who did not receive any error feedback on ring orientation during\nlong, straight path sections. There were no significant differences between\ngroups for ring position overall, but participants who received real-time\nfeedback outperformed the other groups in positional accuracy on tightly curved\npath sections. Conclusion: The addition of real-time haptic and visual error\nfeedback improves learning outcomes in a virtual surgical task over error\nfeedback in replay or no error feedback at all. Significance: This work\ndemonstrates that multi-sensory error feedback delivered in real time leads to\nbetter training outcomes as compared to the same feedback delivered after task\ncompletion. This novel method of training may enable surgical trainees to\ndevelop skills with greater speed and accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) support robust excitons in\nthe visible to near-infrared spectral range. Their reduced dielectric screening\nresults in large binding energies, and combined with a direct bandgap in\nmonolayer form, these excitons dominate the optical response of TMDs. In this\nwork, we present a comprehensive investigation of the temperature-dependent\noptical and polaritonic properties of high-quality, flux-grown $\\mathrm{WS_2}$,\n$\\mathrm{MoS_2}$, $\\mathrm{WSe_2}$, and $\\mathrm{MoSe_2}$ monolayers,\nencapsulated by hBN, in the full temperature range between $5-300 \\mathrm{K}$.\nUsing reflection spectroscopy measurements, we evaluate and compare the optical\nand polaritonic constituents of the TMD excitons in terms of oscillator\nstrength, linewidth and negative permittivity. We find that it is\n$\\mathrm{MoSe_2}$ that exhibits the most pronounced optical and polaritonic\nresponse, stemming from its rapid linewidth narrowing at low temperatures, as\ncompared to the temperature-dependent response of the other TMDs. In addition,\nwe find that all four TMDs exhibits a temperature-dependent negative real part\npermittivity, thus supporting surface-exciton-polaritons. We derive their\ndispersion relation, confinement factors and losses, similarly revealing that\n$\\mathrm{MoSe_2}$ exhibit enhanced polaritonic properties. These findings\nestablish a comparative framework for understanding the optical and polaritonic\nproperties of monolayer TMDs, with implications on their utilization in\noptoelectronic devices based on 2D semiconductors.",

    "abstract": "High-dimensional vector similarity search (HVSS) is critical for many data\nprocessing and AI applications. However, traditional HVSS methods often require\nextensive data access for distance calculations, leading to inefficiencies.\nTriangle-inequality-based lower bound pruning is a widely used technique to\nreduce the number of data access in low-dimensional spaces but becomes less\neffective in high-dimensional settings. This is attributed to the \"distance\nconcentration\" phenomenon, where the lower bounds derived from the triangle\ninequality become too small to be useful. To address this, we propose TRIM,\nwhich enhances the effectiveness of traditional triangle-inequality-based\npruning in high-dimensional vector similarity search using two key ways: (1)\noptimizing landmark vectors used to form the triangles, and (2) relaxing the\nlower bounds derived from the triangle inequality, with the relaxation degree\nadjustable according to user's needs. TRIM is a versatile operation that can be\nseamlessly integrated into both memory-based (e.g., HNSW, IVFPQ) and disk-based\n(e.g., DiskANN) HVSS methods, reducing distance calculations and disk access.\nExtensive experiments show that TRIM enhances memory-based methods, improving\ngraph-based search by up to 90% and quantization-based search by up to 200%,\nwhile achieving a pruning ratio of up to 99%. It also reduces I/O costs by up\nto 58% and improves efficiency by 102% for disk-based methods, while preserving\nhigh query accuracy.",

Initially, using the cut-and-paste technique, we perform a\nlinearized stability analysis in the presence of a general cosmological\nconstant. Our results show that for sufficiently large positive values of the\ncosmological constant, corresponding to the Schwarzschild-de Sitter geometry,\nthe stability regions of the wormhole solutions are significantly enhanced\ncompared to the Schwarzschild case. Subsequently, we construct static\nthin-shell solutions by matching an interior wormhole geometry to an exterior\nvacuum spacetime across a junction surface. In the spirit of minimizing the\npresence of exotic matter, we identify parameter domains in which the null and\nweak energy conditions are satisfied at the shell. We examine the surface\nstress-energy components in detail, determining regions where the tangential\nsurface pressure is either positive or negative, interpreted, respectively, as\nthe pressure or surface tension. Additionally, an expression describing the\nbehavior of the radial pressure across the junction is derived. Finally, we\ndetermine key geometrical characteristics of the wormhole, including the throat\nradius and the junction interface radius, by imposing traversability\nconditions. Estimates for the traversal time and required velocity are also\nprovided, further elucidating the physical viability of these configurations.",

    "abstract": "Message passing neural networks (MPNNs) are powerful models for node\nclassification but suffer from performance limitations under heterophily (low\nsame-class connectivity) and structural bottlenecks in the graph. We provide a\nunifying statistical framework exposing the relationship between heterophily\nand bottlenecks through the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of MPNN\nrepresentations. The SNR decomposes model performance into feature-dependent\nparameters and feature-independent sensitivities. We prove that the sensitivity\nto class-wise signals is bounded by higher-order homophily -- a generalisation\nof classical homophily to multi-hop neighbourhoods -- and show that low\nhigher-order homophily manifests locally as the interaction between structural\nbottlenecks and class labels (class-bottlenecks). Through analysis of graph\nensembles, we provide a further quantitative decomposition of bottlenecking\ninto underreaching (lack of depth implying signals cannot arrive) and\noversquashing (lack of breadth implying signals arriving on fewer paths) with\nclosed-form expressions. We prove that optimal graph structures for maximising\nhigher-order homophily are disjoint unions of single-class and\ntwo-class-bipartite clusters. This yields BRIDGE, a graph ensemble-based\nrewiring algorithm that achieves near-perfect classification accuracy across\nall homophily regimes on synthetic benchmarks and significant improvements on\nreal-world benchmarks, by eliminating the ``mid-homophily pitfall'' where MPNNs\ntypically struggle, surpassing current standard rewiring techniques from the\nliterature.

However, algorithmic innovation alone\nis insufficient; software-hardware co-design is essential to meet the extreme\nlatency requirements of 6G (i.e., 0.1 milliseconds). This motivates us to\npropose leveraging in-memory computing, which is an analog computing technology\nthat integrates memory and computation within memristor circuits, to perform\nthe intensive matrix-vector multiplication (MVM) operations inherent in deep\nMIMO detection at the nanosecond scale. Specifically, we introduce a novel\narchitecture, called the deep in-memory MIMO (IM-MIMO) detector, characterized\nby two key features. First, each of its cascaded computational blocks is\ndecomposed into channel-dependent and channel-independent neural network\nmodules. Such a design minimizes the latency of memristor reprogramming in\nresponse to channel variations, which significantly exceeds computation time.\nSecond, we develop a customized detector-training method that exploits prior\nknowledge of memristor-value statistics to enhance robustness against\nprogramming noise.

    "abstract": "Hexagonal boron nitride ($h$-BN), with its strong in-plane bonding and good\nlattice match to hcp and fcc metals, offers a promising alternative barrier\nmaterial for magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs). Here, we investigate\nspin-dependent transport in\nhcp-Co$_{1-x}$Ni$_{x}$$/$$h$-BN$/$hcp-Co$_{1-x}$Ni$_{x}$(0001) MTJs with\nphysisorption-type interfaces using first-principles calculations. We find that\na high TMR ratio arises from the resonant tunneling of the down-spin surface\nstates of the hcp-Co$_{1-x}$Ni$_{x}$, having a $\\Delta_1$-like symmetry around\nthe $\\Gamma$ point. Ni doping tunes the Fermi level and enhances this effect by\nreducing the overlap between up-spin and down-spin conductance channels in\nmomentum space under the parallel configuration, thereby suppressing\nantiparallel conductance and increasing the TMR ratio. This mechanism is\nanalogous to Brillouin zone spin filtering and is sensitive to the interfacial\ndistance but not specific to $h$-BN barriers; similar behavior may emerge in\nMTJs with other two-dimensional insulators or semiconductors. These findings\nprovide insight into surface-state-assisted tunneling mechanisms and offer\nguidance for the interface engineering of next-generation spintronic devices.",

Second, we pioneer integrate the video\ndegradation enhancement task into the video fusion pipeline by constructing a\ntemporal cooperative module, which leverages temporal dependencies to\nfacilitate weak information recovery. Third, to ensure temporal consistency, we\nembed a temporal-enhanced mechanism into the network and devise a temporal loss\nto guide the optimization process.

However, existing surface reconstruction works struggle to recover\naccurate scene geometry when the input views are extremely sparse. To address\nthis issue, we propose MeshSplat, a generalizable sparse-view surface\nreconstruction framework via Gaussian Splatting. Our key idea is to leverage\n2DGS as a bridge, which connects novel view synthesis to learned geometric\npriors and then transfers these priors to achieve surface reconstruction.\nSpecifically, we incorporate a feed-forward network to predict per-view\npixel-aligned 2DGS, which enables the network to synthesize novel view images\nand thus eliminates the need for direct 3D ground-truth supervision. To improve\nthe accuracy of 2DGS position and orientation prediction, we propose a Weighted\nChamfer Distance Loss to regularize the depth maps, especially in overlapping\nareas of input views, and also a normal prediction network to align the\norientation of 2DGS with normal vectors predicted by a monocular normal\nestimator. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our proposed\nimprovement, demonstrating that our method achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance in generalizable sparse-view mesh reconstruction tasks.

Visual token pruning is a promising direction to reduce the\ncomputational cost of VLMs by eliminating redundant visual tokens. The\ntext-visual attention score is a widely adopted criterion for visual token\npruning as it reflects the relevance of visual tokens to the text input.\nHowever, many sequence models exhibit a recency bias, where tokens appearing\nlater in the sequence exert a disproportionately large influence on the model's\noutput.

However, recent studies reveal that RLLMs often suffer\nfrom overthinking, i.e., producing unnecessarily lengthy reasoning chains even\nfor simple questions, leading to excessive token consumption and computational\ninefficiency. Interestingly, we observe that when processing multiple questions\nin batch mode, RLLMs exhibit more resource-efficient behavior by dynamically\ncompressing reasoning steps for easier problems, due to implicit resource\ncompetition. Inspired by this, we propose Dynamic Reasoning Quota Allocation\n(DRQA), a novel method that transfers the benefits of resource competition from\nbatch processing to single-question inference. Specifically, DRQA leverages\nbatch-generated preference data and reinforcement learning to train the model\nto allocate reasoning resources adaptively. By encouraging the model to\ninternalize a preference for responses that are both accurate and concise, DRQA\nenables it to generate concise answers for simple questions while retaining\nsufficient reasoning depth for more challenging ones. Extensive experiments on\na wide range of mathematical and scientific reasoning benchmarks demonstrate\nthat DRQA significantly reduces token usage while maintaining, and in many\ncases improving, answer accuracy. By effectively mitigating the overthinking\nproblem, DRQA offers a promising direction for more efficient and scalable\ndeployment of RLLMs, and we hope it inspires further exploration into\nfine-grained control of reasoning behaviors.",

The gradient-based optimization\ntechniques employed in this work can advance HEP workflows by enabling\nend-to-end tuning of analysis parameters, improving both computational\nscalability and overall sensitivity. The challenges of adopting such techniques\nin HEP workflows are highlighted, along with practical mitigation to those\nchallenges. This framework results in a significant improvement in expected\nstatistical significance compared to a baseline analysis by fine-tuning\n$\\mathcal{O}(10^3)$ parameters in the pipeline.

In\nthis paper, we perform quantitative studies on how properties of topological\ntheory and ergodic theory vary with the gap function in non-uniform\nspecification from different points of view. Firstly, we establish a lower\nestimation for Bowen topological entropy of irregular sets, determined by the\nlower asymptotic linear growth rate of the gap function. As a contrast, we\nprove that under the non-uniform specification property, every non-empty\nover-saturated set, and thus the completely-irregular set carries full packing\ntopological entropy. We also estimate the Bowen topological entropy of\ntransitive points and the exponential growth rate of periodic orbits. Besides,\nwe provide a constructive mechanism for generating dynamical systems with\nnon-uniform specification, containing an arbitrarily given subshift. This\nmechanism demonstrates the richness of dynamical systems with non-uniform\nspecification by constructing systems attaining arbitrarily large values of\ntopological entropy. Moreover, we use this mechanism to find examples\ndemonstrating that the lower estimation for Bowen topological entropy is\noptimal in some cases and that the optimal upper estimation is the full\ntopological entropy. These examples also demonstrate the optimality of the\nestimation of exponential growth rate and further indicate that, when the lower\nasymptotic linear growth rate of the gap function is larger than zero, (i)\ntransitive points may not carry full Bowen topological entropy; (ii) the\nconditional variational principle and the intermediate entropy property may be\ndestroyed.

Columnar structure formation is associated\nwith dominant inverse cascade of energy in addition to the typical forward\ncascade at large wavenumbers. The forcing is random and isotropic, applied in\ntwo distinct wavenumber bands (kf = [3, 4] and [6, 7]). Notably, bursting is\nobserved only for small forcing wavenumber, kf = [3, 4] and not at kf = [6, 7],\nfor the same rotation rate and initial conditions. These bursting events are\nassociated with forward cascade of energy in contrast to the inverse cascade of\nrotating turbulence, as confirmed from the ring spectrum and time-series of\nmodal kinetic energy of modes with kz = 2, 3. Identifying some of the triads\ninvolved in the energy transfer from modal analysis, we also calculate the\nmode-to-mode energy transfer. We find that, before the event, the circular\ncyclonic vortex becomes elliptical due to cyclone-anticyclone interactions\nleading to elliptical instability. We argue that energy transfer preceding the\nbursting events to modes with higher kz triggers the Crow instability. These\ninstabilities ultimately lead to bursting of the columnar vortex, which\nsubsequently forms again due to the external rotation.

The\nkey idea of this so-called Effective Metric Description (EMD) is to parametrise\ndeformations of the classical Schwarzschild geometry by two functions that\ndepend on a physical quantity and which are calculated in a self-consistent way\nas series expansions in the vicinity of the horizon. In this work we further\nstrengthen this framework by first demonstrating that the corresponding series\nexpansion coefficients can be completely and uniquely determined from\nmeasurements that are accessible for observers outside of the event horizon: we\npropose a Gedankenexperiment, consisting of probes following a free-falling\ntrajectory that send signals to a stationary observer and show how an EMD can\nbe constructed from suitable telemetric data. Furthermore, by linking the\nexpansion coefficients of the EMD to the invariant eigenvalues of the energy\nmomentum tensor, we determine a system of physical fields that provides an\neffective Einstein equation for the deformed black hole geometry. In the case\nof a simplified geometry and assuming that the metric deformations are small,\nwe can write the leading order of the physical fields in a closed form in the\nmetric functions.

Less massive stars in this range conclude their evolution\nas carbon-oxygen (CO) white dwarfs. However, those that achieve carbon ignition\nbefore the pressure by degenerate electron halts the core contraction may\neither form massive CONe/ONe white dwarfs, or undergo an electron-capture\nsupernova, or photo-disintegrate neon and proceed with further thermonuclear\nburning, ultimately leading to the formation of a gravitationally unstable iron\ncore. Aims. An evaluation of the impact of the energy loss caused by the\nproduction of axion-like-particles (ALPs) on evolution and final destiny of\nthese stars is the main objective of this paper. Methods. We compute various\nsets of stellar models, all with solar initial composition, varying the\nstrengths of the ALP coupling with photons and electrons. Results. As a\nconsequence of an ALP thermal production, the critical masses for off-center C\nand Ne ignitions are both shifted upward. When the current bounds for the ALP\ncoupling strengths are assumed, the maximum mass for CO WD progenitors is about\n1.1 M_\\odot heavier than that obtained without the ALP energy loss, while the\nminimum mass for a core collapse supernova (CCSN) progenitor is 0.7 M_\\odot\nhigher. Conclusions. Current constraints from observed Type II-P supernova\nlight curves and pre-explosive luminosity do not exclude an ALP production\nwithin the current bounds. However, the maximum age of CCSN progenitors, as\ndeduced from the star formation rate of the parent stellar population, would\nrequire a smaller minimum mass. This discrepancy can be explained by assuming a\nmoderate extra mixing (as due to core overshooting or rotational induced\nmixing) above the fully convective core that develops during the main sequence.",

To address these limitations, this\nstudy proposes a dual-model approach incorporating incremental learning with\nsix machine-learning models to predict EV charging session parameters. This\napproach includes dynamic training updates, optimal features, and\nhyperparameter set selection for each model to make it more robust and\ninclusive. Using a data set of 170,000 measurements from the real world\nelectric vehicle session, week-long charging parameters were predicted over a\none-year period. The findings reveal a significant difference between workplace\nand residential charging locations regarding connection duration\npredictability, with workplace sessions being more predictable. The proposed\nstacking ensemble learning method enhanced forecasting accuracy, improving R2\nby 2.83% to 43.44% across all parameters and location settings. A comparison of\nthe two models reveals that incorporating user IDs as a feature, along with the\nassociated historical data, is the most significant factor influencing the\naccuracy of the forecast.

By periodically\ntransmitting short fixed pulse patterns over the quantum channel, our approach\nachieves swift clock offset recovery, typically within a few hundred\nmilliseconds. We implemented this method in our time-bin-phase BB84 QKD system,\ndemonstrating successful resynchronization after multi-minute channel\ninterruptions and fiber length changes exceeding 100 km. The method can be\nretrofitted to existing systems via a software upgrade and without hardware\nchanges, allowing for broad applicability. In total, the resynchronization\nmethod significantly enhances QKD system resilience and allows for reliable\noperation in challenging environments such as dynamically routed optical\nnetworks, i.e., software-defined networks, and free-space optical links with\nmobile nodes.",

To address these challenges, we propose a\nnovel genetic algorithm-based methodology for scheduling multiple deep learning\nnetworks on heterogeneous processors by partitioning the networks into multiple\nsubgraphs.

To investigate the typical Sun-as-a-star Ha temporal\nspectral characteristics in solar eruption source regions, we analyzed five\ndifferent types of solar eruptions, using spectroscopic data from the Chinese\nHa Solar Explorer (CHASE). Because the spatially-integral Ha spectrum of source\nregion is mainly contributed by emission from heated plasma in flare ribbons\nand absorption from cold plasma in evolving filaments, we separately analyze\nthe sub-regions of the source region dominated by different dynamical\nprocesses. It is revealed that filament eruptions show emission near Ha line\ncenter, accompanied by blueshifted/redshifted absorption, while flare ribbons\nshow Ha line center emission with red asymmetry and line broadening. Moreover,\na special spectral signature likely associated with coronal mass ejections\n(CMEs) is identified: prominent blueshifted absorption without a clear\ndeceleration phase, along with redshifted absorption, which can be used as a\nprobe when searching stellar CMEs. Furthermore, in the X9.0 flare\n(SOL2024-10-03T12:18) accompanied by a violent CME, the expected blueshifted\nsignal is not visible in the spatially-integral Ha spectra. This suggests that\nfilament-lifting signals associated with CMEs in the source region can be\nobscured by the simultaneous dominant flare-ribbon emission within the\nintegration region, which may explain the relatively small number of confirmed\nstellar CMEs observed in Ha. We also find that comparison between the Ha and UV\nspectral observations can effectively reveal the velocity evolution of erupting\nfilaments and potential existence of associated CMEs.",

It has long\nbeen known that the Shortest Remaining Processing Time (SRPT) algorithm is\noptimal (i.e., $1$-competitive) when the job sizes are known up-front [Schrage,\n1968]. But in the non-clairvoyant setting where job sizes are revealed only\nwhen the job finishes, no algorithm can be constant-competitive [Motwani,\nPhillips, and Torng, 1994].\n  We consider the $\\varepsilon$-clairvoyant setting, where $\\varepsilon \\in\n[0,1]$, and each job's processing time becomes known once its remaining\nprocessing time equals an $\\varepsilon$ fraction of its processing time. This\ncaptures settings where the system user uses the initial $(1-\\varepsilon)$\nfraction of a job's processing time to learn its true length, which it can then\nreveal to the algorithm. The model was proposed by Yingchareonthawornchai and\nTorng (2017), and it smoothly interpolates between the clairvoyant setting\n(when $\\epsilon = 1$) and the non-clairvoyant setting (when $\\varepsilon = 0$).\nIn a concrete sense, we are asking: how much knowledge is required to\ncircumvent the hardness of this problem?\n  We show that a little knowledge is enough, and that a constant competitive\nalgorithm exists for every constant $\\varepsilon > 0$. More precisely, for all\n$\\varepsilon \\in (0,1)$, we present a deterministic $\\smash{\\lceil\n\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon}\\rceil}$-competitive algorithm, which is optimal for\ndeterministic algorithms. We also present a matching lower bound (up to a\nconstant factor) for randomized algorithms.

    "abstract": "Diffusion models have recently achieved remarkable success in generative\ntasks (e.g., image and video generation), and the demand for high-quality\ncontent (e.g., 2K/4K videos) is rapidly increasing across various domains.\nHowever, generating ultra-high-resolution videos on existing\nstandard-resolution (e.g., 720p) platforms remains challenging due to the\nexcessive re-training requirements and prohibitively high computational and\nmemory costs. To this end, we introduce SuperGen, an efficient tile-based\nframework for ultra-high-resolution video generation. SuperGen features a novel\ntraining-free algorithmic innovation with tiling to successfully support a wide\nrange of resolutions without additional training efforts while significantly\nreducing both memory footprint and computational complexity. Moreover, SuperGen\nincorporates a tile-tailored, adaptive, region-aware caching strategy that\naccelerates video generation by exploiting redundancy across denoising steps\nand spatial regions. SuperGen also integrates cache-guided,\ncommunication-minimized tile parallelism for enhanced throughput and minimized\nlatency. Evaluations demonstrate that SuperGen harvests the maximum performance\ngains while achieving high output quality across various benchmarks.",

While existing methods\nexcel at estimating users' broad interests based on the filtered historical\nbehaviors, they typically under-exploit explicit alignment between a user's\nreal-time intent (represented by the user query) and their past actions. In\nthis paper, we propose DiffusionGS, a novel and scalable approach powered by\ngenerative models. Our key insight is that user queries can serve as explicit\nintent anchors to facilitate the extraction of users' immediate interests from\nlong-term, noisy historical behaviors. Specifically, we formulate interest\nextraction as a conditional denoising task, where the user's query guides a\nconditional diffusion process to produce a robust, user intent-aware\nrepresentation from their behavioral sequence. We propose the User-aware\nDenoising Layer (UDL) to incorporate user-specific profiles into the\noptimization of attention distribution on the user's past actions. By reframing\nqueries as intent priors and leveraging diffusion-based denoising, our method\nprovides a powerful mechanism for capturing dynamic user interest shifts.\nExtensive offline and online experiments demonstrate the superiority of\nDiffusionGS over state-of-the-art methods.",

These options are nested across layers, allowing for\nefficient reuse of learned movements and improved sample efficiency.

By treating the deterministic structure of the PMCW waveform as an\nimplicit pilot, the proposed T3former eliminates the overhead associated with\ntraditional pilot-based methods. The proposed T3former processes the received\nPMCW-NOMA signals on two distinct timescales, where a fine-grained attention\nmechanism captures local features across the fast-time dimension, while a\ncoarse-grained mechanism aggregates global spatio-temporal dependencies of the\nslow-time dimension. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed T3former\nsignificantly outperforms traditional successive interference cancellation\n(SIC) receivers, which avoids inherent error propagation in SIC.

In this\nstudy, the equilibrium solutions to highly simplified chemical networks for CO\nand H2O have been re-assessed with particular attention to the formulation of\nthe ice desorption rates in the context of 'three-phase' gas-grain\nastrochemical models. The analytical solutions have also been updated to\naccount for the chemically inert reservoir of molecules below the surface ice\nlayers, and to include the effects of reactive desorption.

    "abstract": "Estimating the 3D pose of a drone is important for anti-drone systems, but\nexisting methods struggle with the unique challenges of drone keypoint\ndetection. Drone propellers serve as keypoints but are difficult to detect due\nto their high visual similarity and diversity of poses. To address these\nchallenges, we propose DroneKey, a framework that combines a 2D keypoint\ndetector and a 3D pose estimator specifically designed for drones. In the\nkeypoint detection stage, we extract two key-representations (intermediate and\ncompact) from each transformer encoder layer and optimally combine them using a\ngated sum. We also introduce a pose-adaptive Mahalanobis distance in the loss\nfunction to ensure stable keypoint predictions across extreme poses. We built\nnew datasets of drone 2D keypoints and 3D pose to train and evaluate our\nmethod, which have been publicly released. Experiments show that our method\nachieves an AP of 99.68% (OKS) in keypoint detection, outperforming existing\nmethods. Ablation studies confirm that the pose-adaptive Mahalanobis loss\nfunction improves keypoint prediction stability and accuracy. Additionally,\nimprovements in the encoder design enable real-time processing at 44 FPS. For\n3D pose estimation, our method achieved an MAE-angle of 10.62{\\deg}, an RMSE of\n0.221m, and an MAE-absolute of 0.076m, demonstrating high accuracy and\nreliability.

Our contributions\nare threefold: (1) we curate a diverse suite of downstream tasks and datasets\nfrom canonical EEG paradigms, implementing standardized processing and\nevaluation protocols within a unified open-source framework; (2) we benchmark\nprominent state-of-the-art foundation models to establish comprehensive\nbaseline results for a clear comparison of the current landscape; (3) we\nperform qualitative analyses of the learned representations to provide insights\ninto model behavior and inform future architectural design. Through extensive\nexperiments, we find that fine-grained spatio-temporal feature interaction,\nmultitask unified training and neuropsychological priors would contribute to\nenhancing model performance and generalization capabilities. By offering a\nunified platform for fair comparison and reproducible research, EEG-FM-Bench\nseeks to catalyze progress and guide the community toward the development of\nmore robust and generalizable EEG-FMs. Code is released at\nhttps://github.com/xw1216/EEG-FM-Bench.",

However, owing to inter-modal discrepancies, these SpeechLMs\nstill exhibit a significant performance gap compared to their text-based LLM\ncounterparts in instruction-following, particularly when confronted with the\ndynamic and variable nature of user speech. To address this challenge, this\npaper introduces a framework termed Reinforced Behavior Alignment (RBA),\ndesigned to bolster the language generation proficiency of SpeechLMs. Instead\nof relying on supervised fine-tuning from human annotations, RBA employs a\nself-synthesis methodology to generate extensive, high-fidelity alignment data\nby a powerful teacher LLM.

This enables SSD to\ndynamically switch between decoding schemes to prioritize utility or safety, to\nhandle the challenge of different model capacities. The output token is then\nsampled from a new distribution that combines the distributions of the original\nand the small models.

The average X-ray photon\nindex for the seven sources, derived from an absorbed power-law model with\nGalactic absorption fixed, is 1.49 (ranging from -0.68 to 2.51), corresponding\nto an average luminosity of $\\rm 6.85\\times 10^{44}~erg~s^{-1}$ in the\nrest-frame 2-33 keV band, with individual luminosities spanning $(3.57 -\n13.96)\\rm\\times 10^{44}~erg~s^{-1}$.

The framework generates perception-driven risk graphs\nfrom real-time scene imagery to enable early fire risk detection and provide\ninterpretable emergency responses for task module and robot component\nconfiguration based on the evolving risk situation. Extensive simulations and\nreal-world experiments show that IOG has good applicability and practical\napplication value in fire risk detection and rescue decision-making.",

    "abstract": "Hot accretion disks around massive protostars provide a unique opportunity to\nstudy ice-free silicate grains that cannot be investigated in protoplanetary\ndisks. We conduct a self-consistent investigation into grain-size evolution and\nits impact on (sub)millimeter-wave emission from massive protostellar disks.\nOur radiative transfer modeling accounts for dust self-scattering and includes\nvertical temperature gradients in the disk structure. The results show that\nonce silicate grains grow to sizes exceeding the observing wavelength, enhanced\nscattering dims the disk emission by 20\\%--30\\% relative to the blackbody\nemission expected at the disk surface temperature. By comparing our model with\nAtacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array 1.14 mm observations of the disk\naround the massive protostar GGD27-MM1, we constrain the threshold velocity for\ncollisional fragmentation of silicate grains to approximately 15 m s-1. This\nfragmentation velocity is lower than the typical maximum collisional velocities\nin protoplanetary disks around low-mass stars, suggesting that collisional\ncoagulation alone is insufficient for silicate dust to form rocky planetesimals\nin such environments. Furthermore, our analysis identifies two potential\nscenarios to better reproduce the bright inner-disk emission of GGD27-MM1. One\npossibility is that the grain growth is limited to 160 mum by another growth\nbarrier (e.g., collisional bouncing), reducing scattering dimming.\nAlternatively, the stellar luminosity may be as much as five times higher than\ncurrent estimates, compensating for the reduced brightness. Future\nmultiwavelength observations, particularly at shorter submillimeter\nwavelengths, will be crucial to distinguish between these scenarios and further\nconstrain silicate grain coagulation processes in massive protostellar disks.",

In this paper, we highlight the need for instant preference-aligned\nT2I generation and propose a training-free framework grounded in multimodal\nlarge language model (MLLM) priors.

While optimized for generating responses from visual-textual inputs,\nthese models lack explicit supervision to ensure semantic coherence within\nretrieved fragments. To this end, we propose F2RVLM, a generative retrieval\nmodel trained in a two-stage paradigm: (1) supervised fine-tuning to inject\nfragment-level retrieval knowledge, and (2) GRPO-based reinforcement learning\nwith multi-objective rewards promoting semantic precision, relevance, and\ncontextual coherence. To handle varying intra-fragment complexity, from locally\ndense to sparsely distributed, we introduce difficulty-aware curriculum\nsampling that ranks training instances by model-predicted difficulty and\ngradually exposes the model to harder samples. This boosts reasoning ability in\nlong, multi-turn contexts. F2RVLM outperforms popular VLMs in both in-domain\nand real-domain settings, demonstrating superior retrieval performance.",

A critical step in FPGA development is logic synthesis, which\nenables developers to translate their software designs into hardware net lists,\nwhich facilitates the physical implementation of the chip, detailed timing and\npower analysis, gate-level simulation, test vector generation, and optimization\nand consistency checking. However, bugs or incorrect implementations in FPGA\nlogic synthesis compilers may lead to unexpected behaviors in target\nwapplications, posing security risks. Therefore, it is crucial to eliminate\nsuch bugs in FPGA logic synthesis compilers. The effectiveness of existing\nworks is still limited by its simple, blind mutation strategy. To address this\nchallenge, we propose a guided mutation strategy based on Bayesian optimization\ncalled LSC-Fuzz to detect bugs in FPGA logic synthesis compilers. Specifically,\nLSC-Fuzz consists of three components: the test-program generation component,\nthe Bayesian diversity selection component, and the equivalent check component.\nBy performing test-program generation and Bayesian diversity selection,\nLSC-Fuzz generates diverse and complex HDL code, thoroughly testing the FPGA\nlogic synthesis compilers using equivalent check to detect bugs. Through three\nmonths, LSC-Fuzz has found 16 bugs, 12 of these has been confirmed by official\ntechnical support.",

Adaptive strategies, such as $h$- and\n$p$-refinement, improve efficiency by sequentially refining the mesh based on a\nposteriori error estimates. However, these methods are geometrically rigid --\nlimited to specific refinement rules -- and require solving the problem on a\nsequence of adaptive meshes, which can be computationally expensive. Moreover,\nthe design of effective a posteriori error estimates is problem-dependent and\nnon-trivial.

    "abstract": "Federated learning facilitates collaborative model training across multiple\nclients while preserving data privacy. However, its performance is often\nconstrained by limited communication resources, particularly in systems\nsupporting a large number of clients. To address this challenge, integrating\nover-the-air computations into the training process has emerged as a promising\nsolution to alleviate communication bottlenecks. The system significantly\nincreases the number of clients it can support in each communication round by\ntransmitting intermediate parameters via analog signals rather than digital\nones. This improvement, however, comes at the cost of channel-induced\ndistortions, such as fading and noise, which affect the aggregated global\nparameters. To elucidate these effects, this paper develops a theoretical\nframework to analyze the performance of over-the-air federated learning in\nlarge-scale client scenarios. Our analysis reveals three key advantages of\nscaling up the number of participating clients: (1) Enhanced Privacy: The\nmutual information between a client's local gradient and the server's\naggregated gradient diminishes, effectively reducing privacy leakage. (2)\nMitigation of Channel Fading: The channel hardening effect eliminates the\nimpact of small-scale fading in the noisy global gradient. (3) Improved\nConvergence: Reduced thermal noise and gradient estimation errors benefit the\nconvergence rate. These findings solidify over-the-air model training as a\nviable approach for federated learning in networks with a large number of\nclients. The theoretical insights are further substantiated through extensive\nexperimental evaluations.",

    "abstract": "Multi-agent reinforcement learning in mixed-motive settings presents a\nfundamental challenge: agents must balance individual interests with collective\ngoals, which are neither fully aligned nor strictly opposed. To address this,\nreward restructuring methods such as gifting and intrinsic motivation have been\nproposed. However, these approaches primarily focus on promoting cooperation by\nmanaging the trade-off between individual and collective returns, without\nexplicitly addressing fairness with respect to the agents' task-specific\nrewards. In this paper, we propose an adaptive conflict-aware gradient\nadjustment method that promotes cooperation while ensuring fairness in\nindividual rewards. The proposed method dynamically balances policy gradients\nderived from individual and collective objectives in situations where the two\nobjectives are in conflict. By explicitly resolving such conflicts, our method\nimproves collective performance while preserving fairness across agents. We\nprovide theoretical results that guarantee monotonic non-decreasing improvement\nin both the collective and individual objectives and ensure fairness. Empirical\nresults in sequential social dilemma environments demonstrate that our approach\noutperforms baselines in terms of social welfare while ensuring fairness among\nagents.",

This aligns topological and semantic\nfeatures of ID nodes, enhancing ID/OOD distinction across structural and\ntextual shifts.

We propose unlearning-as-ablation as a falsifiable\nprobe of constructive scientific discovery. The idea is to systematically\nremove a target result together with its forget-closure (supporting lemmas,\nparaphrases, and multi-hop entailments) and then evaluate whether the model can\nre-derive the result from only permitted axioms and tools. Success would\nindicate generative capability beyond recall; failure would expose current\nlimits.

Crucially, observing these evolving\npreferences in a computationally efficient manner remains a significant\nchallenge. To address this, we propose TiKMiX, a method that dynamically\nadjusts the data mixture according to the model's evolving preferences. TiKMiX\nintroduces Group Influence, an efficient metric for evaluating the impact of\ndata domains on the model. This metric enables the formulation of the data\nmixing problem as a search for an optimal, influence-maximizing distribution.\nWe solve this via two approaches: TiKMiX-D for direct optimization, and\nTiKMiX-M, which uses a regression model to predict a superior mixture. We\ntrained models with different numbers of parameters, on up to 1 trillion\ntokens. TiKMiX-D exceeds the performance of state-of-the-art methods like\nREGMIX while using just 20% of the computational resources. TiKMiX-M leads to\nan average performance gain of 2% across 9 downstream benchmarks. Our\nexperiments reveal that a model's data preferences evolve with training\nprogress and scale, and we demonstrate that dynamically adjusting the data\nmixture based on Group Influence, a direct measure of these preferences,\nsignificantly improves performance by mitigating the underdigestion of data\nseen with static ratios.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive assessments require normative data as essential benchmarks for\nevaluating individual performance. Hence, developing new cognitive tests based\non novel image stimuli is challenging due to the lack of readily available\nnormative data. Traditional data collection methods are costly, time-consuming,\nand infrequently updated, limiting their practical utility. Recent advancements\nin generative multimodal large language models (MLLMs) offer a new approach to\ngenerate synthetic normative data from existing cognitive test images. We\ninvestigated the feasibility of using MLLMs, specifically GPT-4o and\nGPT-4o-mini, to synthesize normative textual responses for established\nimage-based cognitive assessments, such as the \"Cookie Theft\" picture\ndescription task. Two distinct prompting strategies-naive prompts with basic\ninstructions and advanced prompts enriched with contextual guidance-were\nevaluated. Responses were analyzed using embeddings to assess their capacity to\ndistinguish diagnostic groups and demographic variations. Performance metrics\nincluded BLEU, ROUGE, BERTScore, and an LLM-as-a-judge evaluation. Advanced\nprompting strategies produced synthetic responses that more effectively\ndistinguished between diagnostic groups and captured demographic diversity\ncompared to naive prompts. Superior models generated responses exhibiting\nhigher realism and diversity. BERTScore emerged as the most reliable metric for\ncontextual similarity assessment, while BLEU was less effective for evaluating\ncreative outputs. The LLM-as-a-judge approach provided promising preliminary\nvalidation results. Our study demonstrates that generative multimodal LLMs,\nguided by refined prompting methods, can feasibly generate robust synthetic\nnormative data for existing cognitive tests, thereby laying the groundwork for\ndeveloping novel image-based cognitive assessments without the traditional\nlimitations.",

We then introduce a\nknowledge graph-based setting in which simulated experts generate data based on\ntheir individual expertise. We highlight several aspects of data diversity that\nhelp to enable the model's transcendent capabilities. Additionally, our data\ngeneration setting offers a controlled testbed that we hope is valuable for\nfuture research in the area.",

Non-Fermi-liquid transport behaviors, such as $T$-linear resistivity\nand positive Hall coefficient increasing at low temperatures, have been\nreported in this system. In this study, we analyze the non-Fermi-liquid\ntransport phenomena in the thin-film bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ using\na multiorbital tight-binding model. In La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, the orbital-selective\ncold spots composed of Ni $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital emerge since the spin\nfluctuations cause stronger quasi-particle damping $\\gamma$ in the Ni $d_{z^2}$\norbital. Notably, in the present study, we derive a rigorous formula for the\nHall coefficient $R_H$ incorporating the $\\gamma$ in the quasi-quantum metric\n(qQM) term. We discover that the $T$-dependence of $\\gamma$ in the qQM term is\nimportant in determining $R_H$, and that the qQM term is inevitably enhanced by\nthe nearly degenerate bands at the orbital-selective cold spots located around\n$(\\pi/4,\\pi/4)$.

Although\nrecent advances in computer vision have produced increasingly sophisticated\ndetection algorithms, the majority of research efforts have focused on normal\nglomeruli or instances of global sclerosis, leaving the wider spectrum of\ndiseased glomerular subtypes comparatively understudied. This disparity is not\nwithout consequence; the nuanced and highly variable morphological\ncharacteristics that define these disease variants frequently elude even the\nmost advanced computational models. Moreover, ongoing debate surrounds the\nchoice of optimal imaging magnifications and region-of-view dimensions for\nfine-grained glomerular analysis, adding further complexity to the pursuit of\naccurate classification and robust segmentation.\n  To bridge these gaps, we present M^3-GloDet, a systematic framework designed\nto enable thorough evaluation of detection models across a broad continuum of\nregions, scales, and classes. Within this framework, we evaluate both\nlong-standing benchmark architectures and recently introduced state-of-the-art\nmodels that have achieved notable performance, using an experimental design\nthat reflects the diversity of region-of-interest sizes and imaging resolutions\nencountered in routine digital renal pathology. As the results, we found that\nintermediate patch sizes offered the best balance between context and\nefficiency. Additionally, moderate magnifications enhanced generalization by\nreducing overfitting. Through systematic comparison of these approaches on a\nmulti-class diseased glomerular dataset, our aim is to advance the\nunderstanding of model strengths and limitations, and to offer actionable\ninsights for the refinement of automated detection strategies and clinical\nworkflows in the digital pathology domain.",

According to\nour experiments, the evaluation metric of Nuri accurately classifies\nhigh-impact publications with an AUROC score of 0.737. Our Manifesting Pipeline\nalso successfully reconstructs core concepts from the latest top-journal\narticles solely from their keyword sets.

    "abstract": "Voice deepfake attacks, which artificially impersonate human speech for\nmalicious purposes, have emerged as a severe threat. Existing defenses\ntypically inject noise into human speech to compromise voice encoders in speech\nsynthesis models. However, these methods degrade audio quality and require\nprior knowledge of the attack approaches, limiting their effectiveness in\ndiverse scenarios. Moreover, real-time audios, such as speech in virtual\nmeetings and voice messages, are still exposed to voice deepfake threats. To\novercome these limitations, we propose ClearMask, a noise-free defense\nmechanism against voice deepfake attacks. Unlike traditional approaches,\nClearMask modifies the audio mel-spectrogram by selectively filtering certain\nfrequencies, inducing a transferable voice feature loss without injecting\nnoise. We then apply audio style transfer to further deceive voice decoders\nwhile preserving perceived sound quality. Finally, optimized reverberation is\nintroduced to disrupt the output of voice generation models without affecting\nthe naturalness of the speech. Additionally, we develop LiveMask to protect\nstreaming speech in real-time through a universal frequency filter and\nreverberation generator. Our experimental results show that ClearMask and\nLiveMask effectively prevent voice deepfake attacks from deceiving speaker\nverification models and human listeners, even for unseen voice synthesis models\nand black-box API services. Furthermore, ClearMask demonstrates resilience\nagainst adaptive attackers who attempt to recover the original audio signal\nfrom the protected speech samples.",

    "abstract": "Nonlinear dynamical systems with continuous variables can be used for solving\ncombinatorial optimization problems with discrete variables. In particular,\nnumerical simulations of them can be used as heuristic algorithms with a\ndesirable property, namely, parallelizability, which allows us to execute them\nin a massively parallel manner using cutting-edge many-core processors, leading\nto ultrafast performance. However, the dynamical-system approaches with\ncontinuous variables are usually less accurate than conventional approaches\nwith discrete variables such as simulated annealing. To improve the solution\naccuracy of a representative dynamical system-based algorithm called simulated\nbifurcation (SB), which was found from classical simulation of a quantum\nnonlinear oscillator network exhibiting quantum bifurcation, here we generalize\nit by introducing nonlinear control of individual bifurcation parameters and\nshow that the generalized SB (GSB) can achieve almost 100% success\nprobabilities for some large-scale problems. As a result, the time to solution\nfor a 2,000-variable problem is shortened to 10 ms by a GSB-based machine,\nwhich is two orders of magnitude shorter than the best known value, 1.3 s,\npreviously obtained by an SB-based machine. To examine the reason for the\nultrahigh performance, we investigated chaos in the GSB changing the\nnonlinear-control strength and found that the dramatic increase of success\nprobabilities happens near the edge of chaos. That is, the GSB can find a\nsolution with high probability by harnessing the edge of chaos. This finding\nsuggests that dynamical-system approaches to combinatorial optimization will be\nenhanced by harnessing the edge of chaos, opening a broad possibility to tackle\nintractable combinatorial optimization problems by nature-inspired approaches.",

    "abstract": "The stochastic-$\\delta \\mathcal{N}$ formalism is widely used to study\ninflation models in which the quantum diffusion of inflatons dominates the\nbackground dynamics, leading to interesting phenomena such as the production of\nprimordial black holes. Among numerical approaches to calculate the curvature\nperturbation spectrum $\\mathcal{P}_\\zeta(k)$ in this formalism, the Monte Carlo\nsimulation-based approach has been proposed as a promising choice, especially\nin multifield cases. In this approach, we generate many paths of inflatons from\nthe initial points to the end of inflation, obtain statistics of $\\delta N$\nfrom the paths, and then estimate $\\mathcal{P}_\\zeta(k)$. However, this method\ninvolves a nested Monte Carlo simulation, which requires generating many branch\npaths from each trunk path at the point corresponding to the scale $k$ of\ninterest, resulting in a high computational cost. In this paper, we propose a\nnew Monte Carlo-based approach that utilizes least squares fitting, introducing\ntwo novel features for reducing computational cost. First, we devise a simple\nestimator of a key statistic $\\langle \\delta\\mathcal{N}_{\\mathbf{X}}^2\\rangle$,\nthe variance of $\\delta \\mathcal{N}$ conditioned on the branching point, to\navoid nesting path generation. Second, via least squares fitting of a\nparametric function to the sampled values of the estimator, we obtain not just\nan estimate of $\\mathcal{P}_\\zeta(k)$ for a single value of $k$ but an\napproximating function of $\\mathcal{P}_\\zeta(k)$ over a range of $k$ of\ninterest. We also conduct numerical demonstrations for concrete inflation\nmodels, which show the usefulness of our method.",

    "abstract": "Longitudinal Multiple Sclerosis Lesion Segmentation is a particularly\nchallenging problem that involves both input and output imbalance in the data\nand segmentation. Therefore in order to develop models that are practical, one\nof the solutions is to develop better loss functions. Most models naively use\neither Dice loss or Cross-Entropy loss or their combination without too much\nconsideration. However, one must select an appropriate loss function as the\nimbalance can be mitigated by selecting a proper loss function. In order to\nsolve the imbalance problem, multiple loss functions were proposed that claimed\nto solve it. They come with problems of their own which include being too\ncomputationally complex due to hyperparameters as exponents or having\ndetrimental performance in metrics other than region-based ones. We propose a\nnovel hybrid loss called HyTver that achieves good segmentation performance\nwhile maintaining performance in other metrics. We achieve a Dice score of\n0.659 while also ensuring that the distance-based metrics are comparable to\nother popular functions.

    "abstract": "Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) commonly follow a paradigm that projects\nvisual features and then concatenates them with text tokens to form a unified\nsequence input for Large Language Models (LLMs). However, this paradigm leads\nto a significant increase in the length of the input sequence, resulting in\nsubstantial computational overhead. Existing methods attempt to fuse visual\ninformation into the intermediate layers of LLMs, which alleviate the sequence\nlength issue but often neglect the hierarchical semantic representations within\nthe model and the fine-grained visual information available in the shallower\nvisual encoding layers. To address this limitation, we propose DEHVF, an\nefficient vision-language fine-tuning method based on dynamic embedding and\nfusion of hierarchical visual features. Its core lies in leveraging the\ninherent hierarchical representation characteristics of visual encoders and\nlanguage models. Through a lightweight hierarchical visual fuser, it\ndynamically selects and fuses hierarchical features corresponding to semantic\ngranularity based on the internal representations of each layer in LLMs. The\nfused layer-related visual features are then projected and aligned before being\ndirectly embedded into the Feed-Forward Network (FFN) of the corresponding\nlayer in LLMs. This approach not only avoids sequence expansion but also\ndynamically fuses multi-layer visual information. By fine-tuning only a small\nnumber of parameters, DEHVF achieves precise alignment and complementarity of\ncross-modal information at the same semantic granularity. We conducted\nexperiments across various VL benchmarks, including visual question answering\non ScienceQA and image captioning on COCO Captions.

This\nissue emerges when LLMs excessively reduce the probability of rejected\ncompletions to achieve high rewards, without genuinely meeting their intended\ngoals. As a result, this leads to overly lengthy generation lacking diversity,\nas well as catastrophic forgetting of knowledge. We investigate the underlying\nreason behind this issue, which is representation redundancy caused by neuron\ncollapse in the parameter space. Hence, we propose a novel Weights-Rotated\nPreference Optimization (RoPO) algorithm, which implicitly constrains the\noutput layer logits with the KL divergence inherited from DPO and explicitly\nconstrains the intermediate hidden states by fine-tuning on a multi-granularity\northogonal matrix. This design prevents the policy model from deviating too far\nfrom the reference model, thereby retaining the knowledge and expressive\ncapabilities acquired during pre-training and SFT stages.

During this process, as the stable height increases, the\ntranslational velocity parallel to the surface increases while the rotational\nvelocity perpendicular to the surface decreases, collectively increasing the\nradius of curvature. Ultimately, our findings demonstrate that near-field\nhydrodynamic interactions significantly prolong the surface residence time of\nbacteria. Additionally, smaller stable heights further amplify this effect,\nresulting in longer residence times and enhanced surface entrapment.",

Nevertheless, effectively aligning them with desired\nbehaviors remains a significant challenge. Activation steering is an effective\nand cost-efficient approach that directly modifies the activations of LLMs\nduring the inference stage, aligning their responses with the desired behaviors\nand avoiding the high cost of fine-tuning. Existing methods typically\nindiscriminately intervene to all generations or rely solely on the question to\ndetermine intervention, which limits the accurate assessment of the\nintervention strength. To this end, we propose the Flexible Activation Steering\nwith Backtracking (FASB) framework, which dynamically determines both the\nnecessity and strength of intervention by tracking the internal states of the\nLLMs during generation, considering both the question and the generated\ncontent. Since intervening after detecting a deviation from the desired\nbehavior is often too late, we further propose the backtracking mechanism to\ncorrect the deviated tokens and steer the LLMs toward the desired behavior.\nExtensive experiments on the TruthfulQA dataset and six multiple-choice\ndatasets demonstrate that our method outperforms baselines.

In this study, we propose a multi task learning (MTL) framework that\njointly predicts the global ADAS-Cog score and its sub-scores (13 items) at\nMonth 24 using baseline MRI and longitudinal clinical scores from baseline and\nMonth 6. The main goal is to examine how each sub scores particularly those\nassociated with MRI features contribute to the prediction of the global score,\nan aspect largely neglected in prior MTL studies. We employ Vision Transformer\n(ViT) and Swin Transformer architectures to extract imaging features, which are\nfused with longitudinal clinical inputs to model cognitive progression. Our\nresults show that incorporating sub-score learning improves global score\nprediction. Subscore level analysis reveals that a small subset especially Q1\n(Word Recall), Q4 (Delayed Recall), and Q8 (Word Recognition) consistently\ndominates the predicted global score. However, some of these influential\nsub-scores exhibit high prediction errors, pointing to model instability.\nFurther analysis suggests that this is caused by clinical feature dominance,\nwhere the model prioritizes easily predictable clinical scores over more\ncomplex MRI derived features.

    "abstract": "Ultimate is a sport where points are scored by passing a disc and catching it\nin the opposing team's end zone. In Ultimate, the player holding the disc\ncannot move, making field dynamics primarily driven by other players'\nmovements. However, current literature in team sports has ignored quantitative\nevaluations of when players initiate such unlabeled movements in game\nsituations. In this paper, we propose a quantitative evaluation method for\nmovement initiation timing in Ultimate Frisbee. First, game footage was\nrecorded using a drone camera, and players' positional data was obtained, which\nwill be published as UltimateTrack dataset. Next, players' movement initiations\nwere detected, and temporal counterfactual scenarios were generated by shifting\nthe timing of movements using rule-based approaches. These scenarios were\nanalyzed using a space evaluation metric based on soccer's pitch control\nreflecting the unique rules of Ultimate. By comparing the spatial evaluation\nvalues across scenarios, the difference between actual play and the most\nfavorable counterfactual scenario was used to quantitatively assess the impact\nof movement timing.\n  We validated our method and show that sequences in which the disc was\nactually thrown to the receiver received higher evaluation scores than the\nsequences without a throw.\n  In practical verifications, the higher-skill group displays a broader\ndistribution of time offsets from the model's optimal initiation point.\n  These findings demonstrate that the proposed metric provides an objective\nmeans of assessing movement initiation timing, which has been difficult to\nquantify in unlabeled team sport plays.",

    "abstract": "This project focuses on a method to extract a frequency comb in mechanical\nmeans, for general interest and numerous practical applications in MEMS. The\nmethod of execution is the implementation of a beam that is exhibiting\nnon-linear dynamics that is perturbed and analyzed for its transverse\nvibrations. The perturbation is an external harmonic driver with a chosen small\namplitude and frequency (which is slightly detuned from the beam\neigenfrequency), that when engaged with the unperturbed beam oscillations,\ncauses it reach a state of \"injection pulling\" - an effect that occurs when one\nharmonic oscillator is coupled with a second one and causes it to oscillate in\na frequency near its own. This causes the beam to reach SNIC bifurcation,\nrendering a frequency comb as desired. Theoretical analysis showed that the\nproblem can be modelled using a non-linear equation of the beam, that\ntranslates to a form of the non-linear Duffing equation. While a solution to\nthe dynamics function of the beam is hard to obtain in practice due to\nmathematical difficulties, a slow evolution model is suggested that is composed\nof functions of a amplitude and phase. Using several additional mathematical\nassumptions, the amplitude is seen to be related to the phase, while the phase\nequation solution is seen to be of the form of Adler's equation. These\nassumptions ultimately reduce the entire behaviour of the beam to a relatively\nsimple solution to the Adler equation, which has a known analytical solution.\nComputerized numerical simulations are run on it to check the results and\ncompare them to the theory and desired outcome. The results agreed with the\ntheory and produce the expected frequency comb, showing the assumptions to be\nvalid in extracting the comb.",

This task faces two major challenges: limited data diversity\nand insufficient maintenance of visual consistency between generated and\noriginal charts during training. Existing datasets mainly rely on seed data to\nprompt GPT models for code generation, resulting in homogeneous samples. To\naddress this, we propose ReChartPrompt, which leverages real-world,\nhuman-designed charts from arXiv papers as prompts instead of synthetic seeds.\nUsing the diverse styles and rich content of arXiv charts, we construct\nReChartPrompt-240K, a large-scale and highly diverse dataset. Another challenge\nis that although SFT effectively improve code understanding, it often fails to\nensure that generated charts are visually consistent with the originals. To\naddress this, we propose ChartSimRL, a GRPO-based reinforcement learning\nalgorithm guided by a novel chart similarity reward. This reward consists of\nattribute similarity, which measures the overlap of chart attributes such as\nlayout and color between the generated and original charts, and visual\nsimilarity, which assesses similarity in texture and other overall visual\nfeatures using convolutional neural networks. Unlike traditional text-based\nrewards such as accuracy or format rewards, our reward considers the multimodal\nnature of the chart-to-code task and effectively enhances the model's ability\nto accurately reproduce charts.

However, this approach relies on\nthe analytical expression of the ideal beam pattern and the proper selection of\ntruncation order, which is not always practical. This paper introduces a\nnull-constraint-based method for designing frequency- and steerable-invariant\ndifferential beamformers using a line array of omnidirectional and directional\nmicrophones. The approach employs a multi-constraint optimisation framework,\nwhere the reference filter and ideal beam pattern are first determined based on\nspecified nulls and desired direction. Subsequently, the white noise gain\nconstraint is derived from the reference filter, and the beampattern constraint\nis from the ideal beam pattern. The optimal filter is then obtained by\nconsidering constraints related to the beampattern, nulls, and white noise\ngain. This method achieves a balance between white noise gain and mean square\nerror, allowing robust, frequency- and steerableinvariant differential\nbeamforming performance. It addresses limitations in beam pattern flexibility\nand truncation errors, offering greater design freedom and improved practical\napplicability. Simulations and experiments demonstrate that this method\noutperforms the Jacobi-Anger expansion-based approach in three key aspects: an\nextended effective range, improved main lobe and null alignment, and greater\nflexibility in microphone array configuration and beam pattern design,\nrequiring only steering direction and nulls instead of an analytic beam pattern\nexpression.",

    "abstract": "Training robot policies within a learned world model is trending due to the\ninefficiency of real-world interactions. The established image-based world\nmodels and policies have shown prior success, but lack robust geometric\ninformation that requires consistent spatial and physical understanding of the\nthree-dimensional world, even pre-trained on internet-scale video sources. To\nthis end, we propose a novel branch of world model named Gaussian World Model\n(GWM) for robotic manipulation, which reconstructs the future state by\ninferring the propagation of Gaussian primitives under the effect of robot\nactions. At its core is a latent Diffusion Transformer (DiT) combined with a 3D\nvariational autoencoder, enabling fine-grained scene-level future state\nreconstruction with Gaussian Splatting. GWM can not only enhance the visual\nrepresentation for imitation learning agent by self-supervised future\nprediction training, but can serve as a neural simulator that supports\nmodel-based reinforcement learning. Both simulated and real-world experiments\ndepict that GWM can precisely predict future scenes conditioned on diverse\nrobot actions, and can be further utilized to train policies that outperform\nthe state-of-the-art by impressive margins, showcasing the initial data scaling\npotential of 3D world model.",

    "abstract": "A central goal in ecology is to understand how biodiversity is maintained.\nPrevious theoretical works have employed the rock-paper-scissors (RPS) game as\na toy model, demonstrating that population mobility is crucial in determining\nthe species' coexistence. One key prediction is that biodiversity is\njeopardized and eventually lost when mobility exceeds a certain value--a\nconclusion at odds with empirical observations of highly mobile species\ncoexisting in nature. To address this discrepancy, we introduce a reinforcement\nlearning framework and study a spatial RPS model, where individual mobility is\nadaptively regulated via a Q-learning algorithm rather than held fixed. Our\nresults show that all three species can coexist stably, with extinction\nprobabilities remaining low across a broad range of baseline migration rates.\nMechanistic analysis reveals that individuals develop two behavioral\ntendencies: survival priority (escaping from predators) and predation priority\n(remaining near prey). While species coexistence emerges from the balance of\nthe two tendencies, their imbalance jeopardizes biodiversity. Notably, there is\na symmetry-breaking of action preference in a particular state that is\nresponsible for the divergent species densities. Furthermore, when Q-learning\nspecies interact with fixed-mobility counterparts, those with adaptive mobility\nexhibit a significant evolutionary advantage. Our study suggests that\nreinforcement learning may offer a promising new perspective for uncovering the\nmechanisms of biodiversity and informing conservation strategies.",

Specifically, after running the DSMC for a\ncertain number of time steps, the high-order constitutive relations for stress\nand heat flux, as well as the momentum and energy exchange terms from\ninter-species collisions, are extracted from the DSMC and incorporated into the\nmacroscopic synthetic equations. These equations are solved to obtain the\nsteady state, and the solution is then used to update the particle distribution\nin DSMC, thereby skipping unnecessary intermediate evolutions. This two-way\ncoupling not only accelerates convergence to the steady state but also\nasymptotically preserves the Navier-Stokes limit in the continuum flow regime,\nallowing the spatial cell size to be much larger than the molecular mean free\npath. The accuracy of our method is validated for one-dimensional force-driven\nPoiseuille flow and two-dimensional hypersonic flow past cylinders, considering\nMaxwell and hard-sphere gases with mass ratios of 10 and 100. Although our\nin-house DSMC method is approximately an order of magnitude slower than the\nopen-source DSMC code SPARTA, intermittently augmenting it with the synthetic\nequation makes it roughly 30 times faster at a Knudsen number of 0.01, with\neven greater computational gains anticipated at smaller Knudsen numbers.

The study shows that the excitation with sufficiently low photon\nenergy results in the creation of trions directly in the K/K' valleys through\nphoton absorption followed by phonon scattering events. On the other hand,\nexcitation energy sufficiently larger than the band-gap can generate the\ncarriers away from the K/K' valleys. Dissimilarity in the rates of relaxation\nof the photo-excited electrons and the holes to the bottom of the K/K' valleys\nresults in the transformation of the excitons residing there into trions. Our\nTAS study clearly demonstrates a temporary increase of the trion population in\nthe K/K' valleys. Moreover, excitation intensity dependent PL spectroscopy\nperformed under above-band-gap excitation, also suggests the coexistence of\nboth the pathways of trion generation in this material.

A comparison of the NIR light curves and color evolution\nwith those of other Type Ibn SNe reveals prominent NIR excess persisting from\n15 to 100 days. The spectral energy distribution (SED) is well explained by a\ncombination of a hot blackbody component and a carbon dust model. The dust\ntemperature remained relatively constant at $T=1600\\pm100$ K up to $t=60$ d.\nThe estimated dust mass is $\\sim1.2 \\times10^{-4}~M_{\\odot}$.

The dust shell is located outside the shocked cool dense\nshell (CDS) at the position of $7.6\\times10^{14}$ cm.

In this work, we explore a radically\ndifferent paradigm: assessing models on unsolved questions. Rather than a\nstatic benchmark scored once, we curate unsolved questions and evaluate models\nasynchronously over time with validator-assisted screening and community\nverification. We introduce UQ, a testbed of 500 challenging, diverse questions\nsourced from Stack Exchange, spanning topics from CS theory and math to sci-fi\nand history, probing capabilities including reasoning, factuality, and\nbrowsing. UQ is difficult and realistic by construction: unsolved questions are\noften hard and naturally arise when humans seek answers, thus solving them\nyields direct real-world value. Our contributions are threefold: (1) UQ-Dataset\nand its collection pipeline combining rule-based filters, LLM judges, and human\nreview to ensure question quality (e.g., well-defined and difficult); (2)\nUQ-Validators, compound validation strategies that leverage the\ngenerator-validator gap to provide evaluation signals and pre-screen candidate\nsolutions for human review; and (3) UQ-Platform, an open platform where experts\ncollectively verify questions and solutions. The top model passes UQ-validation\non only 15% of questions, and preliminary human verification has already\nidentified correct answers among those that passed.

In this paper, we uncover the rich, intricate nature of complex\nsemi-classical paths and interference in the Feynman propagator of a\nnon-relativistic quantum particle in both a smooth Woods-Saxon and a\ndiscontinuous Heaviside step potential. We demonstrate that the complex\nsemi-classical paths are connected to caustics and may cease to exist as naive\nsolutions to the boundary value problem when the semi-classical path encounters\nsingularities of the potential. We generalise complex semi-classical paths to\nequivalence classes. Using this generalisation, we track the contribution of\ncomplex semi-classical paths beyond these singularity crossings and identify\nthe instanton responsible for the quantum reflection. Whereas most complex\ncontributions to the path integral are small, we demonstrate that in some cases\nthe contribution of the complex semi-classical path is unsuppressed and\npersists into the semi-classical limit. Finally, we develop methods to detect\nthe presence of complex semi-classical paths from propagation amplitudes.

Here, we\nunequivocally demonstrate the occurrence of QMPE in experimentally realizable\nparity-time-symmetric qubit systems immersed in a bosonic bath. Surprisingly,\nwe find that exceptional points are neither sufficient nor necessary for the\nQMPE in this context, contrasting previous findings. Specifically, we show that\nthe QMPE persists across parameter regimes both near and far from Hamiltonian\nand Liouvillian exceptional points, but disappears entirely when Hermitian\nHamiltonian is restored. Owing to the complete suppression of the slowest\nrelaxation mode facilitated by parity-time symmetry, we attribute the observed\nQMPE to a cooperative effect of remaining relaxation modes.

    "abstract": "Modern computer vision models have proven to be highly useful for medical\nimaging classification and segmentation tasks, but the scarcity of medical\nimaging data often limits the efficacy of models trained from scratch. Transfer\nlearning has emerged as a pivotal solution to this, enabling the fine-tuning of\nhigh-performance models on small data. Mei et al. (2022) found that\npre-training CNNs on a large dataset of radiologist-labeled images\n(RadImageNet) enhanced model performance on downstream tasks compared to\nImageNet pretraining. The present work extends Mei et al. (2022) by conducting\na comprehensive investigation to determine optimal CNN architectures for breast\nlesion malignancy detection and ACL tear detection, as well as performing\nstatistical analysis to compare the effect of RadImageNet and ImageNet\npre-training on downstream model performance. Our findings suggest that\n1-dimensional convolutional classifiers with skip connections, ResNet50\npre-trained backbones, and partial backbone unfreezing yields optimal\ndownstream medical classification performance. Our best models achieve AUCs of\n0.9969 for ACL tear detection and 0.9641 for breast nodule malignancy\ndetection, competitive with the results reported by Mei et al.

However, existing\nsystems often lack inter-agent coordination, structured self-reflection, and\naccess to high-quality, domain-specific post-training data such as data from\ntrading activities including both market conditions and agent decisions. These\ndata are crucial for agents to understand the market dynamics, improve the\nquality of decision-making and promote effective coordination. We introduce\nTradingGroup, a multi-agent trading system designed to address these\nlimitations through a self-reflective architecture and an end-to-end\ndata-synthesis pipeline. TradingGroup consists of specialized agents for news\nsentiment analysis, financial report interpretation, stock trend forecasting,\ntrading style adaptation, and a trading decision making agent that merges all\nsignals and style preferences to produce buy, sell or hold decisions.\nSpecifically, we design self-reflection mechanisms for the stock forecasting,\nstyle, and decision-making agents to distill past successes and failures for\nsimilar reasoning in analogous future scenarios and a dynamic risk-management\nmodel to offer configurable dynamic stop-loss and take-profit mechanisms. In\naddition, TradingGroup embeds an automated data-synthesis and annotation\npipeline that generates high-quality post-training data for further improving\nthe agent performance through post-training.

    "abstract": "Topology Optimization (TO) holds the promise of designing next-generation\ncompact and efficient fluidic devices. However, the inherent complexity of\nfluid-based TO systems, characterized by multiphysics nonlinear interactions,\nposes substantial barriers to entry for researchers.\n  Beyond the inherent intricacies of forward simulation models, design\noptimization is further complicated by the difficulty of computing\nsensitivities, i.e., gradients. Manual derivation and implementation of\nsensitivities are often laborious and prone to errors, particularly for\nnon-trivial objectives, constraints, and material models. An alternative\nsolution is automatic differentiation (AD). Although AD has been previously\ndemonstrated for simpler TO problems, extending its use to complex nonlinear\nmultiphysics systems, specifically in fluidic optimization, is key to reducing\nthe entry barrier.\n  To this end, we introduce TOFLUX, a TO framework for fluid devices leveraging\nthe JAX library for high-performance automatic differentiation. The flexibility\nafforded by AD enables the rapid exploration and evaluation of various\nobjectives and constraints. We illustrate this capability through challenging\nexamples encompassing thermo-fluidic coupling, fluid-structure interaction, and\nnon-Newtonian flows. Additionally, we demonstrate the seamless integration of\nour framework with neural networks and machine learning methodologies, enabling\nmodern approaches to scientific computing. Ultimately, the framework aims to\nprovide a foundational resource to accelerate research and innovation in\nfluid-based TO.

This study reviews the\nonboarding of users to this decentralised platform between 2016 and 2022 and\nanalyses the migration of 19,000 users who identified themselves as supporters\nof the platform switch. The results show that the migration campaign was a\nreactive response to Elon Musk's acquisition of Twitter and was led by a group\nof highly active academics, scientists, and journalists. However, a complete\ntransition was not realised, as users preferred to straddle their presence on\nboth platforms.

    "abstract": "The orientation of a polarization vector on the Poincare sphere is defined by\nits position angle (PA) and ellipticity angle (EA). The radio emission from\npulsars, magnetars, and fast radio bursts can be elliptically polarized, and\nmeasurements of the EA have become increasingly important in interpretations\nand models of their polarization. An in-depth understanding of the statistical\nproperties of the measured polarization angles is a prerequisite to their\ndetailed interpretation. While the statistics of the PA have been understood\nfor some time, the statistics of the EA do not appear to be as well developed\nas those of the PA. The statistical properties of the EA are derived when the\namplitude of the polarization vector is constant, to include its probability\ndensity, mean, standard deviation, and confidence limits. Similar to the PA,\nthe standard deviation and confidence limits of the EA vary inversely with the\npolarization signal-to-noise ratio. However, unlike the PA, the probability\ndensity of the EA is generally asymmetric, its standard deviation and\nconfidence limits are dependent upon the intrinsic value of the EA, and the\nmeasured EA is biased by the instrumental noise, particularly at low\nsignal-to-noise ratios and large values of the intrinsic EA. General\nexpressions for the joint probability density of the polarization angles and\nthe probability density of the EA are also derived when the amplitude of the\npolarization vector fluctuates due to the superposition of incoherent modes of\northogonal polarization.",

First, we flag\nirregularity in the convergence patterns of potentials with so-called \"soft\"\nregulator scales, namely that the sizes of the coefficients in the observables'\nexpansions are mismatched between the even and odd orders. Second, we test the\nBUQEYE model's assumption of Gaussian process (GP) stationarity against the\ndata and find that the GP's correlation structure as encoded in its length\nscale is nonstationary: The GP length scale in the angular dimension\n$\\ell_{\\theta}$ is approximately inversely proportional to the relative\nmomentum of the scattering process. After we remediate this issue by allowing\n$\\ell_{\\theta}$ to vary with momentum, diagnostics show significant\nimprovement, validating the application of the BUQEYE model after this\nmodification. Third, we find that good performance of the BUQEYE model relies\non properly choosing the $\\chi$EFT breakdown scale $\\Lambda_{b}$.
