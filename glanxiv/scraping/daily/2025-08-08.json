    "abstract": "We introduce a modular prompting framework that supports safer and more\nadaptive use of large language models (LLMs) across dynamic, user-centered\ntasks. Grounded in human learning theory, particularly the Zone of Proximal\nDevelopment (ZPD), our method combines a natural language boundary prompt with\na control schema encoded with fuzzy scaffolding logic and adaptation rules.\nThis architecture enables LLMs to modulate behavior in response to user state\nwithout requiring fine-tuning or external orchestration. In a simulated\nintelligent tutoring setting, the framework improves scaffolding quality,\nadaptivity, and instructional alignment across multiple models, outperforming\nstandard prompting baselines. Evaluation is conducted using rubric-based LLM\ngraders at scale. While initially developed for education, the framework has\nshown promise in other interaction-heavy domains, such as procedural content\ngeneration for games. Designed for safe deployment, it provides a reusable\nmethodology for structuring interpretable, goal-aligned LLM behavior in\nuncertain or evolving contexts.",

    "abstract": "The advent of ultra-low-bit LLM models (1/1.58/2-bit), which match the\nperplexity and end-task performance of their full-precision counterparts using\nthe same model size, is ushering in a new era of LLM inference for\nresource-constrained environments such as edge devices and AI PCs.

We integrate these microkernels into a state-of-the-art LLM\ninference framework, namely PyTorch-TPP, and present end-to-end inference\nresults with 2-bit models that outperform the current SOTA runtime bitnet.cpp\nby up to 2.2x, and deliver up to 7x speedup compared to the 16-bit model\ninference.

    "abstract": "The response of polar solvents to ions and polar molecules dictates many\nfundamental molecular processes. To understand such electrostatically-driven\nsolvation processes, one ideally would probe the dielectric response of a\nsolvent to an idealized point test charge or dipole solute, as envisioned in\nclassic continuum treatments of the problem. However, this is difficult in\nsimulations using standard atomically-detailed solvent models with embedded\npoint charges due to possible overlap with the test charge that lead to\nsingular interaction energies. This problem is traditionally avoided for a\nrealistic charged solute by introducing an excluded volume core that shields\nits embedded point charge or dipole from the charges in the solvent. However,\nthis core introduces additional molecular-scale perturbations of the solvent\ndensity that complicate the interpretation of solvent dielectric response. In\nthis work, we avoid these complications through the use of Gaussian-smoothed\ntest charges and dipoles. Gaussian charges and dipoles can be readily inserted\nanywhere into an atomistic solvent model without encountering infinite\nenergies. If the Gaussian-smoothing is on the scale of molecular correlations\nin the solvent, both the thermodynamic and dynamic solvation response is\nlinear. Using this observation, we construct accurate predictive theories for\nsolvation free energies and solvation dynamics for insertion of Gaussian\ncharges and dipoles in polar solvents and demonstrate the accuracy of the\ntheories for a widely-used model of water. Our results suggest that Gaussian\ntest charge distributions can be used as an informative probe of dielectric\nresponse in molecular models, and our theories can be used to analytically\npredict the largest component of solvation free energies of charged and polar\nsolutes.",

Our multiphase approach combines expert\nannotation, prompt design, and LLM evaluation with ChatGPT, Llama, and Qwen. We\nlabeled 558 sentences from 15 narrators for sentiment and semantic\nclassification, then evaluated zero-shot, few-shot, and RAG strategies. For\nsemantic classification, ChatGPT achieved the highest F1 score (88.71%),\nfollowed by Llama (84.99%) and Qwen (83.72%).

For a robot or autonomous system to successfully\nnavigate through obstacles, it must be able to detect such obstacles. While\nnumerous collision avoidance algorithms like the dynamic window approach (DWA),\ntimed elastic bands (TEB), and reciprocal velocity obstacles (RVO) have been\nproposed, they may lead to suboptimal paths due to fixed weights, be\ncomputationally expensive, or have limited adaptability to dynamic obstacles in\nmulti-agent environments. Optimal reciprocal collision avoidance (ORCA), which\nimproves on RVO, provides smoother trajectories and stronger collision\navoidance guarantees. We propose ORCA-FL to improve on ORCA by using fuzzy\nlogic controllers (FLCs) to better handle uncertainty and imprecision for\nobstacle avoidance in path planning. Numerous multi-agent experiments are\nconducted and it is shown that ORCA-FL can outperform ORCA in reducing the\nnumber of collision if the agent has a velocity that exceeds a certain\nthreshold.

To explore how isolation by distance and adaptation\ncombine to determine species diversity, we implemented a model regulated by\nthese two components. The first is implemented via mating restrictions on\nspatial proximity and genetic similarity. The second is realized by an\necological phenotype subjected to adaption and natural selection. We consider\nscenarios where the environment is either homogeneous, with a single ecological\noptimum, or heterogeneous with two distinct optima. In homogeneous environments\nno speciation is observed under permissive mating restrictions, independent on\nthe strength of natural selection. On the other hand, if reproduction requires\nclose genetic similarity (strict mating restrictions), speciation occurs only\nunder strong selection. In contrast, in environments with two local optima and\nstrong selection, species well adapted to each of the niches emerge along the\nspatial structure, leading to the formation of groups with distinct phenotypes.\nPermissive mating restrictions leads to the formation of only two species, each\noccupying one of the niches; strong mating restriction leads to several species\nper niche, in a much faster speciation process. Interestingly, when selection\nis weak and reproduction requires strong genetic similarity, several species\nform, but the process is slow.

This implies magnetism with an incommensurate\nordering vector, independent of its microscopic origin. AFMs with f- or h-wave\nspin-polarization are also prone to incommensurability, especially when they\nhave an itinerant origin. Here the symmetry which ensures the odd-parity\nspin-polarization also guarantees the existence of van Hove saddle points off\nthe time-reversal-invariant momenta, which promote incommensurate spin\nfluctuations in quasi-two-dimensional electronic systems. Finally, we study the\neffect of weak spin-orbit coupling in locally noncentrosymmetric materials and\nfind that it favors antiferromagnetic phases with in-plane magnetic moments.\nHowever, the inclusion of the spin-orbit coupling also introduces a new\nmechanism for driving incommensuration.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) can serve as judges that offer rapid and\nreliable assessments of other LLM outputs. However, models may systematically\nassign overly favorable ratings to their own outputs, a phenomenon known as\nself-bias, which can distort evaluations of true model performance. Previous\nstudies often conflate genuine differences in model quality with bias or\nincorrectly assume that evaluations from LLMs and humans follow the same rating\ndistributions. In this work, we present a statistical framework that explicitly\nformalizes assumptions under which self-bias can be identified and estimated.\nOur method models the difference in the scoring distribution that\nLLM-as-a-judge assigns to its own completions compared to other models, while\naccounting for the underlying quality of the completions provided by an\nindependent, third-party judge (e.g., humans). Our method reliably isolates and\nquantifies self-bias, even when models vary in ability, ensuring that genuine\nperformance differences are not mistaken for self-bias. We conduct an empirical\nanalysis of self-bias on a large dataset (>5000 prompt-completion pairs)\nconsisting of expert human annotations and judgments from nine different LLM\njudges. We find that some models, such as GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet,\nsystematically assign higher scores to their own outputs. These models also\ndisplay family-bias; systematically assigning higher ratings to outputs\nproduced by other models of the same family. Our findings highlight potential\npitfalls of using LLM judges and offer practical guidance to mitigate biases\nwhen interpreting automated evaluations.",

Typically, SDMs relate species occurrences to\nenvironmental variables representing abiotic factors, such as temperature,\nprecipitation, and soil properties. However, species distributions are also\nstrongly influenced by biotic interactions with other species, which are often\noverlooked. While some methods partially address this limitation by\nincorporating biotic interactions, they often assume symmetrical pairwise\nrelationships between species and require consistent co-occurrence data. In\npractice, species observations are sparse, and the availability of information\nabout the presence or absence of other species varies significantly across\nlocations. To address these challenges, we propose CISO, a deep learning-based\nmethod for species distribution modeling Conditioned on Incomplete Species\nObservations. CISO enables predictions to be conditioned on a flexible number\nof species observations alongside environmental variables, accommodating the\nvariability and incompleteness of available biotic data. We demonstrate our\napproach using three datasets representing different species groups: sPlotOpen\nfor plants, SatBird for birds, and a new dataset, SatButterfly, for\nbutterflies. Our results show that including partial biotic information\nimproves predictive performance on spatially separate test sets. When\nconditioned on a subset of species within the same dataset, CISO outperforms\nalternative methods in predicting the distribution of the remaining species.\nFurthermore, we show that combining observations from multiple datasets can\nimprove performance. CISO is a promising ecological tool, capable of\nincorporating incomplete biotic information and identifying potential\ninteractions between species from disparate taxa.",

    "abstract": "Commitment is a well-established mechanism for fostering cooperation in human\nsociety and multi-agent systems. However, existing research has predominantly\nfocused on the commitment that neglects the freedom of players to abstain from\nan interaction, limiting their applicability to many real-world scenarios where\nparticipation is often voluntary. In this paper, we present a two-stage game\nmodel to investigate the evolution of commitment-based behaviours and\ncooperation within the framework of the optional Prisoner's Dilemma game. In\nthe pre-game stage, players decide whether to accept a mutual commitment. Once\nin the game, they choose among cooperation, defection, or exiting, depending on\nthe formation of a pre-game commitment. We find that optional participation\nboosts commitment acceptance but fails to foster cooperation, leading instead\nto widespread exit behaviour. To address this, we then introduce and compare\ntwo institutional incentive approaches: i) a strict one (STRICT-COM) that\nrewards only committed players who cooperate in the game, and ii) a flexible\none (FLEXIBLE-COM) that rewards any committed players who do not defect in the\ngame. The results reveal that, while the strict approach is demonstrably better\nfor promoting cooperation as the flexible rule creates a loophole for an\nopportunistic exit after committing, the flexible rule offers an efficient\nalternative for enhancing social welfare when such opportunistic behaviour\nresults in a high gain. This study highlights the limitations of relying solely\non voluntary participation and commitment to resolving social dilemmas,\nemphasising the importance of well-designed institutional incentives to promote\ncooperation and social welfare effectively.",

    "abstract": "Despite remarkable progress in computer vision, modern recognition systems\nremain limited by their dependence on rich, redundant visual inputs. In\ncontrast, humans can effortlessly understand sparse, minimal representations\nlike line drawings - suggesting that structure, rather than appearance,\nunderlies efficient visual understanding. In this work, we propose using line\ndrawings as a structure-first pretraining modality to induce more compact and\ngeneralizable visual representations. We show that models pretrained on line\ndrawings develop stronger shape bias, more focused attention, and greater data\nefficiency across classification, detection, and segmentation tasks. Notably,\nthese models also exhibit lower intrinsic dimensionality, requiring\nsignificantly fewer principal components to capture representational variance -\nechoing the similar observation in low dimensional efficient representation in\nthe brain. Beyond performance improvements, line drawing pretraining produces\nmore compressible representations, enabling better distillation into\nlightweight student models. Students distilled from line-pretrained teachers\nconsistently outperform those trained from color-supervised teachers,\nhighlighting the benefits of structurally compact knowledge. Finally, we\ndemonstrate that the pretraining with line-drawing can also be extended to\nunsupervised setting via our proposed method \"learning to draw\". Together, our\nresults support the view that structure-first visual learning fosters\nefficiency, generalization, and human-aligned inductive biases - offering a\nsimple yet powerful strategy for building more robust and adaptable vision\nsystems.",

We propose a theoretical\nHeteRo-Select framework designed to maintain high performance and ensure\nlong-term training stability. We provide a theoretical analysis showing that\nwhen client data is very different (high heterogeneity), choosing a smart\nsubset of client participation can reduce communication more effectively\ncompared to full participation. Our HeteRo-Select method uses a clear,\nstep-by-step scoring system that considers client usefulness, fairness, update\nspeed, and data variety. It also shows convergence guarantees under strong\nregularization. Our experimental results on the CIFAR-10 dataset under\nsignificant label skew ($\\alpha=0.1$) support the theoretical findings. The\nHeteRo-Select method performs better than existing approaches in terms of peak\naccuracy, final accuracy, and training stability.

Furthermore, the\nintegration of LLMs with domain-specific information via retrieval-augmented\ngeneration (RAG) is poised to revolutionize how researchers predict materials\nstructures, analyze defects, discover novel compounds, and extract knowledge\nfrom literature and databases. In motivation to the potentials of LLMs and RAG\nin accelerating material discovery, this paper presents a broad and systematic\nreview to examine the recent advancements in applying LLMs and RAG to key\nmaterials science problems.

Based on the characteristics\nrevealed by socio-economic research into the Arab revolutions of the 2010s,\nthis article proposes a formalization inspired by the theory of complex\nsystems.

We consider a network model of agents and\noppressors where pair interactions are controlled by a fear parameter, or the\ninclination of the individuals to rebel despite of repression. The model\nexhibits a phase transition at a critical threshold above which the quiescent\nstate becomes unstable. Furthermore, the ability of individuals to forge\ntriadic relationships accelerates the process of joining a rising rebellion,\nmaking the transition more abrupt, in the form of a brutal discontinuity that\ncan be described as revolutionary. The imposition of a counter-revolution by\nthe hardening of repression can be explained by the hysteresis property\ndisplayed by the model: when mobilization has extended the initial network and\nmade it partially permanent, repression by the authorities must be tightened to\nhigher levels than before to regain control.",

In this paper, we consider the ion-trap platform to study\nthe interference of waves with different physical natures, specifically the\nelectromagnetic and mechanical. At first, we drive two lasers onto a\nsingle-trapped ion to produce Jaynes-Cummings and Carrier interactions, where\nwe verify that, depending on the phase relationship between the coherent state\nof the vibrational (mechanical) mode and the Carrier pulse (electromagnetic\nwave), the interactions enhance or cancel out population transfer to the\nelectronic state of the ion, that works out as our measuring apparatus for\nthose waves. Extending our result to an ion chain, we verify that a precise\nmodulation of the Carrier Rabi frequency and phase (electromagnetic pulse)\naccording to the amplitude of the incoming mechanical coherent state in the ion\nchain enables creating either constructive or destructive interference with\npropagating pulses, in which the electronic state of the driven ion is,\nrespectively, populated more and faster, or transparent to both pulse waves,\nwhen the information flux behaves as if no external fields are applied.\nFinally, this new type of controlled interference between waves of different\nnatures allows us to propose new hybrid quantum devices, such as transistors or\nfilters of wave packets, where photonic (phononic) pulses control the passage\nof phononic (photonic) waves.",

    "abstract": "Facial expression recognition (FER) models are employed in many video-based\naffective computing applications, such as human-computer interaction and\nhealthcare monitoring. However, deep FER models often struggle with subtle\nexpressions and high inter-subject variability, limiting their performance in\nreal-world applications. To improve their performance, source-free domain\nadaptation (SFDA) methods have been proposed to personalize a pretrained source\nmodel using only unlabeled target domain data, thereby avoiding data privacy,\nstorage, and transmission constraints. This paper addresses a challenging\nscenario where source data is unavailable for adaptation, and only unlabeled\ntarget data consisting solely of neutral expressions is available. SFDA methods\nare not typically designed to adapt using target data from only a single class.\nFurther, using models to generate facial images with non-neutral expressions\ncan be unstable and computationally intensive. In this paper, personalized\nfeature translation (PFT) is proposed for SFDA. Unlike current image\ntranslation methods for SFDA, our lightweight method operates in the latent\nspace. We first pre-train the translator on the source domain data to transform\nthe subject-specific style features from one source subject into another.\nExpression information is preserved by optimizing a combination of expression\nconsistency and style-aware objectives. Then, the translator is adapted on\nneutral target data, without using source data or image synthesis. By\ntranslating in the latent space, PFT avoids the complexity and noise of face\nexpression generation, producing discriminative embeddings optimized for\nclassification. Using PFT eliminates the need for image synthesis, reduces\ncomputational overhead (using a lightweight translator), and only adapts part\nof the model, making the method efficient compared to image-based translation.",

These conceptual\nstructures naturally highlight commonalities and variabilities among similar\nobjects by categorizing them into groups which are then arranged by similarity,\nmaking it particularly appropriate for variability extraction and analysis.\nDespite the potential of FCA, determining which of its properties can be\nleveraged for variability-related tasks (and how) is not always\nstraightforward, partly due to the mathematical orientation of its foundational\nliterature. This paper attempts to bridge part of this gap by gathering a\nselection of properties of the framework which are essential to variability\nanalysis, and how they can be used to interpret diverse variability information\nwithin the resulting conceptual structures.",

A complete\nagreement with the predictive apparatus of standard quantum mechanics,\nincluding the uncertainty principle and the probabilistic Born rule, is then\nsaid to emerge from these equations, without having to confer any special\nstatus to measurements or observers. Two key elements behind the proof of this\ncomplete agreement are absolute uncertainty and the POVM theorem. The former\ninvolves an alleged \"naturally emerging, irreducible limitation on the\npossibility of obtaining knowledge within pilot-wave theory\" and the latter\nestablishes that the outcome distributions of all measurements are described by\nPOVMs. Here, we argue that the derivations of absolute uncertainty and the POVM\ntheorem depend upon the questionable assumption that \"information is always\nconfigurationally grounded\".

We previously introduced a\nproof-of-concept method for reconstructing a membrane's 3-D pore network from a\nsingle 2-D SEM image, yielding statistically equivalent results to those\nobtained from 3-D tomography. However, this initial approach struggled to\nreplicate the diverse pore geometries commonly observed in real membranes. In\nthis study, we advance the methodology by developing an enhanced reconstruction\nalgorithm that not only maintains essential statistical properties (e.g., pore\nsize distribution), but also accurately reproduces intricate pore morphologies.\nApplying this technique to a commercial microfiltration membrane, we generated\na high-fidelity 3-D reconstruction and derived key membrane properties.\nValidation with X-ray tomography data revealed excellent agreement in\nstructural metrics, with our SEM-based approach achieving superior resolution\nin resolving fine pore features.

The emergent communication protocol is shaped by a novel Causal\nInfluence Loss, which measures the effect that the message has on the next\naction. During deployment, the previously trained IA serves as a fixed\ncontextualizer for a new Control Agent (CA), which learns to solve tasks by\ninterpreting the provided communicative context. Our experiments demonstrate\nthat this approach enables the CA to achieve significant gains in sample\nefficiency and successfully perform zero-shot adaptation with the help of\npre-trained IA in entirely unseen sparse-reward environments, validating the\nefficacy of learning a transferable communicative representation.",

    "abstract": "In-generation watermarking for detecting and attributing generated content\nhas recently been explored for latent diffusion models (LDMs), demonstrating\nhigh robustness. However, the use of in-generation watermarks in autoregressive\n(AR) image models has not been explored yet. AR models generate images by\nautoregressively predicting a sequence of visual tokens that are then decoded\ninto pixels using a vector-quantized decoder. Inspired by red-green watermarks\nfor large language models, we examine token-level watermarking schemes that\nbias the next-token prediction based on prior tokens. We find that a direct\ntransfer of these schemes works in principle, but the detectability of the\nwatermarks decreases considerably under common image perturbations. As a\nremedy, we propose two novel watermarking methods that rely on visual token\nclustering to assign similar tokens to the same set. Firstly, we investigate a\ntraining-free approach that relies on a cluster lookup table, and secondly, we\nfinetune VAE encoders to predict token clusters directly from perturbed images.\nOverall, our experiments show that cluster-level watermarks improve robustness\nagainst perturbations and regeneration attacks while preserving image quality.\nCluster classification further boosts watermark detectability, outperforming a\nset of baselines. Moreover, our methods offer fast verification runtime,\ncomparable to lightweight post-hoc watermarking methods.",

    "abstract": "Federated learning has emerged as an essential paradigm for distributed\nmulti-source data analysis under privacy concerns. Most existing federated\nlearning methods focus on the ``static\" datasets. However, in many real-world\napplications, data arrive continuously over time, forming streaming datasets.\nThis introduces additional challenges for data storage and algorithm design,\nparticularly under high-dimensional settings. In this paper, we propose a\nfederated online learning (FOL) method for distributed multi-source streaming\ndata analysis. To account for heterogeneity, a personalized model is\nconstructed for each data source, and a novel ``subgroup\" assumption is\nemployed to capture potential similarities, thereby enhancing model\nperformance. We adopt the penalized renewable estimation method and the\nefficient proximal gradient descent for model training. The proposed method\naligns with both federated and online learning frameworks: raw data are not\nexchanged among sources, ensuring data privacy, and only summary statistics of\nprevious data batches are required for model updates, significantly reducing\nstorage demands. Theoretically, we establish the consistency properties for\nmodel estimation, variable selection, and subgroup structure recovery,\ndemonstrating optimal statistical efficiency. Simulations illustrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed method. Furthermore, when applied to the\nfinancial lending data and the web log data, the proposed method also exhibits\nadvantageous prediction performance.

In parallel, inference scaling\nstrategies such as Best-of-N Sampling and Majority Voting have also proven to\nenhance alignment and performance by trading off computation. However, existing\nprompt optimization approaches are inference strategy agnostic; that is, they\noptimize prompts without regard to the inference strategy employed during\ndeployment. This constitutes a significant methodological gap, as our empirical\nand theoretical analysis reveals a strong interdependence between these two\nparadigms. Moreover, we find that user preferences regarding trade-offs among\nmultiple objectives and inference budgets substantially influence the choice of\nprompt and inference configuration. To address this gap, we introduce a unified\nnovel framework named IAPO (Inference-Aware Prompt Optimization) that jointly\noptimizes the prompt and inference scale, while being aware of the inference\nbudget and different task objectives. We then develop a fixed-budget training\nalgorithm for IAPO, which we call PSST (Prompt Scaling via Sequential\nTrimming), and analyze finite-budget guarantees on error probability. Finally,\nwe evaluate the effectiveness of PSST on six different tasks, including\nmulti-objective text generation and reasoning, and demonstrate the critical\nrole of incorporating inference-awareness when aligning black-box LLMs through\nprompt optimization.",

    "abstract": "A key goal of modern materials science is accelerating the pace of materials\ndiscovery. Self-driving labs, or systems that select experiments using machine\nlearning and then execute them using automation, are designed to fulfil this\npromise by performing experiments faster, more intelligently, more reliably,\nand with richer metadata than conventional means. This review summarizes\nprogress in understanding the degree to which SDLs accelerate learning by\nquantifying how much they reduce the number of experiments required for a given\ngoal. The review begins by summarizing the theory underlying two key metrics,\nnamely acceleration factor AF and enhancement factor EF, which quantify how\nmuch faster and better an algorithm is relative to a reference strategy. Next,\nwe provide a comprehensive review of the literature, which reveals a wide range\nof AFs with a median of 6, and that tends to increase with the dimensionality\nof the space, reflecting an interesting blessing of dimensionality. In\ncontrast, reported EF values vary by over two orders of magnitude, although\nthey consistently peak at 10-20 experiments per dimension. To understand these\nresults, we perform a series of simulated Bayesian optimization campaigns that\nreveal how EF depends upon the statistical properties of the parameter space\nwhile AF depends on its complexity. Collectively, these results reinforce the\nmotivation for using SDLs by revealing their value across a wide range of\nmaterial parameter spaces and provide a common language for quantifying and\nunderstanding this acceleration.",

The challenge that encoding addresses is the need for\nmechanisms that uniquely retain contextual information about the succession of\nindividual symbols, which can then be modeled by nonlinear formulations such as\nneural networks.\n  Context: Universal Sequence Maps(USM) are iterated functions that bijectively\nencode symbolic sequences onto embedded numerical spaces. USM is composed of\ntwo Chaos Game Representations (CGR), iterated forwardly and backwardly, that\ncan be projected into the frequency domain (FCGR). The corresponding USM\ncoordinates can be used to compute a Chebyshev distance metric as well as k-mer\nfrequencies, without having to recompute the embedded numeric coordinates, and,\nparadoxically, allowing for non-integers values of k.\n  Results: This report advances the bijective fractal encoding by Universal\nSequence Maps (USM) by resolving seeding biases affecting the iterated process.\nThe resolution had two results, the first expected, the second an intriguing\noutcome: 1) full reconciliation of numeric positioning with sequence identity;\nand 2) uncovering the nature of USM as an efficient numeric process converging\ntowards a steady state sequence embedding solution. We illustrate these results\nfor genomic sequences because of the convenience of a planar representation\ndefined by an alphabet with only 4 tokens (the 4 nucleotides).

    "abstract": "Micro-expression recognition (MER) is a highly challenging task in affective\ncomputing. With the reduced-sized micro-expression (ME) input that contains key\ninformation based on key-frame indexes, key-frame-based methods have\nsignificantly improved the performance of MER. However, most of these methods\nfocus on improving the performance with relatively accurate key-frame indexes,\nwhile ignoring the difficulty of obtaining accurate key-frame indexes and the\nobjective existence of key-frame index errors, which impedes them from moving\ntowards practical applications. In this paper, we propose CausalNet, a novel\nframework to achieve robust MER facing key-frame index errors while maintaining\naccurate recognition. To enhance robustness, CausalNet takes the representation\nof the entire ME sequence as the input. To address the information redundancy\nbrought by the complete ME range input and maintain accurate recognition,\nfirst, the Causal Motion Position Learning Module (CMPLM) is proposed to help\nthe model locate the muscle movement areas related to Action Units (AUs),\nthereby reducing the attention to other redundant areas. Second, the Causal\nAttention Block (CAB) is proposed to deeply learn the causal relationships\nbetween the muscle contraction and relaxation movements in MEs. Empirical\nexperiments have demonstrated that on popular ME benchmarks, the CausalNet has\nachieved robust MER under different levels of key-frame index noise.

Quantum simulation holds intriguing\npotential in tackling this problem and pioneering experiments have observed\ndifferent characteristic features of gauge theories, such as string breaking\nand false vacuum decay.

We track scattering\nprocesses with single-site resolution across a range of parameter regimes.\nUtilizing a double quench protocol, we observe dynamical freeze-out: upon\nquenching the Hamiltonian after scattering, despite the injection of an\nextensive energy, the system evolution -- in terms of both low-order\ncorrelations and entanglement -- freezes, effectively stabilizing a highly\ncorrelated equilibrium state -- a situation that reminisces that of collisions\nbetween heavy ions.

To overcome\nthis longstanding dual challenge, we redesign the JRM parameters by optimizing\nits inductances to suppress higher order mixing products and engineer its\nelectromagnetic environment by incorporating lumped-element coupled-mode\nnetworks between the JRM and the two distinct ports of the JM. By implementing\nthese strategies, we measure for JMs realized with four coupled modes per port,\noperated in amplification (conversion), bandwidths of about 400 MHz (700 MHz)\nwith power reflections above 10 dB (below -10 dB) and saturation powers of\nabout -110 dBm at 15 dB (-91 dBm at -26 dB). Similarly, we demonstrate for a\nlow external quality factor resonant-mode JM operated in conversion, a maximum\nbandwidth of about $670$ MHz with power reflections below -10 dB and a maximum\nsaturation power of about -86 dBm at -17 dB.

TorchSim supports molecular dynamics integrators, structural\nrelaxation optimizers, both machine-learned and classical interatomic\npotentials (such as Lennard-Jones, Morse, soft-sphere), batching with automatic\nmemory management, differentiable simulation, and integration with popular\nmaterials informatics tools.",

    "abstract": "The intense stellar irradiation of ultra-hot Jupiters results in some of the\nmost extreme atmospheric environments in the planetary regime. On their\ndaysides, temperatures can be sufficiently high for key atmospheric\nconstituents to thermally dissociate into simpler molecular species and atoms.\nThis dissociation drastically changes the atmospheric opacities and, in turn,\ncritically alters the temperature structure, atmospheric dynamics, and\nday-night heat transport. To this date, however, simultaneous detections of the\ndissociating species and their thermally dissociation products in exoplanet\natmospheres have remained rare. Here we present the simultaneous detections of\nH$_2$O and its thermally dissociation product OH on the dayside of the\nultra-hot Jupiter WASP-121 b based on high-resolution emission spectroscopy\nwith the recently commissioned Near InfraRed Planet Searcher (NIRPS). We\nretrieve a photospheric abundance ratio of log$_{10}$(OH/H$_2$O) $=\n-0.15\\pm{0.20}$ indicating that there is about as much OH as H$_2$O at\nphotospheric pressures, which confirms predictions from chemical equilibrium\nmodels. We compare the dissociation on WASP-121 b with other ultra-hot Jupiters\nand show that a trend in agreement with equilibrium models arises. We also\ndiscuss an apparent velocity shift of $4.79^{+0.93}_{-0.97} $km s$^{-1}$ in the\nH$_2$O signal, which is not reproduced by current global circulation models.\nFinally, in addition to H$_2$O and OH, the NIRPS data reveal evidence of Fe and\nMg, from which we infer a Fe/Mg ratio consistent with the solar and host star\nratios. Our results demonstrate that NIRPS can be an excellent instrument to\nobtain simultaneous measurements of refractory and volatile molecular species,\npaving the way for many future studies on the atmospheric composition,\nchemistry, and the formation history of close-in exoplanets.",

Unlike GAN-based methods, our approach integrates\ndiffusion models to learn the image translation process, allowing for more\ncoverable modeling of the data distribution and performance improvement of the\ncross-domain translation. However, incorporating the translation process within\nthe diffusion process is still challenging since the two processes are not\naligned exactly, i.e., the diffusion process is applied to the noisy signal\nwhile the translation process is conducted on the clean signal. As a result,\nrecent diffusion-based studies employ separate training or shallow integration\nto learn the two processes, yet this may cause the local minimal of the\ntranslation optimization, constraining the effectiveness of diffusion models.\nTo address the problem, we propose a novel joint learning framework that aligns\nthe diffusion and the translation process, thereby improving the global\noptimality. Specifically, we propose to extract the image components with\ndiffusion models to represent the clean signal and employ the translation\nprocess with the image components, enabling an end-to-end joint learning\nmanner. On the other hand, we introduce a time-dependent translation network to\nlearn the complex translation mapping, resulting in effective translation\nlearning and significant performance improvement. Benefiting from the design of\njoint learning, our method enables global optimization of both processes,\nenhancing the optimality and achieving improved fidelity and structural\nconsistency.

In this paper, we explore the downstream\nimpact of BPE inference algorithms that do not rely on this merge list at all,\nand hence differ from the encoding process during BPE training. To address this\nquestion, we investigate two broad classes of BPE inference schemes that differ\nfrom BPE application during training: a) targeted deviation from merge-lists\nincluding random merge orders, and various corruptions of merge list involving\ndeletion/truncation, and b) non-targeted BPE inference algorithms that do not\ndepend on the merge list but focus on compressing the text either greedily or\nexactly. Extensive experiments across diverse language modeling tasks like\naccuracy-based QA benchmarks, machine translation, and open-ended generation\nreveal that while targeted deviation from the merge lists exhibits significant\ndegradation in language model performance, the non-targeted merge-list-free\ninference algorithms result in minimal impact on downstream performance that is\noften much smaller than expected.

    "abstract": "The Iris File Extension (IFE) is a low overhead performance-oriented whole\nslide image (WSI) file format designed to improve the image rendering\nexperience for pathologists and simplify image management for system\nadministrators. However, static hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) file servers\ncannot natively stream subregions of high-resolution image files, such as the\nIFE. The majority of contemporary WSI viewer systems are designed as\nbrowser-based web applications and leverage OpenSeaDragon as the tile-based\nrendering framework. These systems convert WSI files to Deep Zoom Images (DZI)\nfor compatibility with simple static HTTP file servers. In order to address\nthis limitation, we have developed the Iris RESTful Server, a low-overhead HTTP\nserver with a RESTful API that is natively compatible with the DICOMweb WADO-RS\nAPI. Written in C++ with Boost Beast HTTP and Asio networking libraries atop\nthe public IFE libraries, the server offers both security and high performance.\nTesting shows that a single instance can handle over 5000 tile requests per\nsecond with a median latency of 21 ms on a private network. We also developed\nand merged a new OpenSeaDragon TileSource, compatible with the Iris RESTful\nAPI, into the next OpenSeaDragon release, enabling simple and immediate drop-in\nreplacement of DZI images within WSI viewer stacks. Designed as a secure\ncross-origin resource sharing microservice, this architecture includes detailed\ndeployment instructions for new or existing WSI workflows, and a public test\nsubdomain (examples.restful.irisdigitalpathology.org ) is provided as a\ndevelopment tool to accelerate WSI web viewer development.",

    "abstract": "As a class of generative artificial intelligence frameworks inspired by\nstatistical physics, diffusion models have shown extraordinary performance in\nsynthesizing complicated data distributions through a denoising process\ngradually guided by score functions. Real-life data, like images, is often\nspatially structured in low-dimensional spaces. However, ordinary diffusion\nmodels ignore this local structure and learn spatially global score functions,\nwhich are often computationally expensive. In this work, we introduce a new\nperspective on the phases of data distributions, which provides insight into\nconstructing local denoisers with reduced computational costs. We define two\ndistributions as belonging to the same data distribution phase if they can be\nmutually connected via spatially local operations such as local denoisers.\nThen, we show that the reverse denoising process consists of an early trivial\nphase and a late data phase, sandwiching a rapid phase transition where local\ndenoisers must fail. To diagnose such phase transitions, we prove an\ninformation-theoretic bound on the fidelity of local denoisers based on\nconditional mutual information, and conduct numerical experiments in a\nreal-world dataset. This work suggests simpler and more efficient architectures\nof diffusion models: far from the phase transition point, we can use small\nlocal neural networks to compute the score function; global neural networks are\nonly necessary around the narrow time interval of phase transitions. This\nresult also opens up new directions for studying phases of data distributions,\nthe broader science of generative artificial intelligence, and guiding the\ndesign of neural networks inspired by physics concepts.",

Using thermo-chemical modeling, we explore how the\ntemperature and chemistry within a protoplanetary disk around a T Tauri star is\nimpacted by the surrounding UV environment. The disk becomes hotter due to\nheating by photodissociation of molecules, photoelectric heating, H_2, and\natomic processes and as a result the area in which molecules exist in the\nice-phase shrinks, being pushed both downward and inward. Beyond 1AU the\nchemistry changes most significantly in a UV-rich background; the atmosphere\nbecomes more H2O, OH, and atomic-rich. Hydrocarbons, however, reside primarily\nwell within 1AU of the disk, thus their abundance and distribution is not\nimpacted by the UV field, up to a 10^6 G0. The products of photodissociation\nand photochemistry are formed deeper into the disk with increasing UV\nbackground field strength beyond 1AU, impacting the chemistry near the\nmidplane. Effectively a `reset' chemistry takes place, with an enhancement of\natoms, simple molecules, and molecules in the gas-phase. Planets that form in\nhighly irradiated regions will be exposed to a different chemical reservoir in\nthe gas and ice-phases than that in an isolated disk, and the impact from the\nUV background should only be detectable in highly irradiated disks (~10^6 G_0).",

We investigate dependencies of the long-term optical\nvariability amplitudes and timescales on (i) supermassive black hole (SMBH)\nmass, luminosity, and Eddington ratio to explore the influence of accretion\ndisk dynamics and radiative processes; (ii) X-ray properties, such as spectral\nphoton indices and fluxes, to study the effect of high-energy emission\nmechanisms; and (iii) radio characteristics, such as integrated fluxes and\nradio loudness, which indicate jet activity. Our findings confirm a positive\ncorrelation between the variability time scale and both the SMBH mass and\nluminosity, suggesting that these physical parameters significantly impact the\noptical variability timescale. Conversely, no significant dependence is found\nbetween optical variability and X-ray properties, indicating that high-energy\nprocesses may not substantially influence long-term optical variability.\nAdditionally, a weak anti-correlation between optical variability and radio\nparameters suggests that jet activity has a negligible effect on causing\nlong-term AGN variability. These results support the hypothesis that long-term\noptical variability in AGN is primarily governed by thermal emission from the\naccretion disk.

MAMBO-9 is among the most massive, gas-rich,\nand actively star-forming galaxies at this epoch, when the Universe was less\nthan 1 Gyr old. The new, 400 pc-resolution [CII] observations reveal velocity\ngradients in both objects; we estimate dynamical masses and find a relative\nmass ratio of 1:5. The kinematics of both objects suggest both rotation and\nstrong tidal interaction, suggesting that the pair has already experienced a\nclose encounter. Indeed, the new JWST imaging reveals a continuous bridge of\nmoderately dust-obscured material between the two. We perform\nspatially-resolved SED fitting using the high-resolution ALMA+JWST imaging,\nfinding that the majority of recent star-formation is concentrated in extremely\nobscured ($A_V > 10$) clouds, while the majority of rest-optical light (stellar\ncontinuum and H$\\alpha$ emission) is emergent from moderate-to-highly obscured\n($A_V\\sim 1$-$5$) regions on the outskirts. Combining our new stellar and\ndynamical mass measurements with previous CO observations, we find that the\nmass budget of MAMBO-9 requires a CO-to-H$_2$ conversion factor ($\\alpha_{\\rm\nCO}$) of roughly unity, indicative of a highly metal-enriched ISM. Finally, we\nshow that MAMBO-9 resides in a large overdensity spanning the PRIMER-COSMOS\nfield, with 39 galaxies spectroscopically confirmed within $\\sim 25$ cMpc.

    "abstract": "Recent approaches for 3D relighting have shown promise in integrating 2D\nimage relighting generative priors to alter the appearance of a 3D\nrepresentation while preserving the underlying structure. Nevertheless,\ngenerative priors used for 2D relighting that directly relight from an input\nimage do not take advantage of intrinsic properties of the subject that can be\ninferred or cannot consider multi-view data at scale, leading to subpar\nrelighting. In this paper, we propose Lightswitch, a novel finetuned\nmaterial-relighting diffusion framework that efficiently relights an arbitrary\nnumber of input images to a target lighting condition while incorporating cues\nfrom inferred intrinsic properties. By using multi-view and material\ninformation cues together with a scalable denoising scheme, our method\nconsistently and efficiently relights dense multi-view data of objects with\ndiverse material compositions. We show that our 2D relighting prediction\nquality exceeds previous state-of-the-art relighting priors that directly\nrelight from images. We further demonstrate that LightSwitch matches or\noutperforms state-of-the-art diffusion inverse rendering methods in relighting\nsynthetic and real objects in as little as 2 minutes.",

Currently, there is not yet a robust\nscience of open-weight model risk management. Existing safety fine-tuning\nmethods and other post-training techniques have struggled to make LLMs\nresistant to more than a few dozen steps of adversarial fine-tuning. In this\npaper, we investigate whether filtering text about dual-use topics from\ntraining data can prevent unwanted capabilities and serve as a more\ntamper-resistant safeguard.

A primary\nobservable is the alignment (or misalignment) between the rotational axis of\nthe star and the orbital plane of its planets, known as stellar obliquity.\nHundreds of spin-orbit constraints have been measured for giant planets close\nto their host stars, many of which have revealed planets on misaligned orbits.\nA leading question that has emerged is whether stellar obliquity originates\nprimarily from gravitational interactions with other planets or distant stars\nin the same system, or if it is primordial--imprinted during the star-formation\nprocess.

As applications we prove a Bernstein\ninequality for random vectors satisfying a moment condition (which is more\ngeneral than boundedness), and also provide the first dimension-free,\nself-normalized empirical Bernstein inequality. Our techniques are based on the\nvariational (PAC-Bayes) approach to concentration.",

CLAS data demonstrated that even precision data for unpolarized\n$\\phi$ photoproduction are insufficient to unambiguously extract $\\sigma_{\\phi\nN}$, allowing the possibilities of both $\\sigma_{\\phi N}$ values. However, as\nit often happens, the additional spin degrees of freedom afforded by a\npolarized target sufficiently constrains the theory to unambiguously provide\n$\\sigma_{\\phi N}$. This will be accomplished with a measurement of the tensor\nasymmetry $A_{zz}$ in coherent $\\phi$ photoproduction from the deuteron,\n$\\gamma + d \\to \\phi + d$. The same measurement in coherent $\\rho$\nphotoproduction will allow us to understand the kinematic dependence of the\nphoton longitudinal interaction length for this process, which is necessary to\nidentify unambiguous signal for color transparency. This will be the first\nstudy of observables in photoproduction from tensor polarized deuterons. We\nwill use the standard GlueX spectrometer, the Hall D Dynamic Nuclear\nPolarization (DNP) polarized target, and both a circularly and linearly\npolarized tagged photon beam. The ability to operate the target in a frozen\nspin mode and produce negative tensor-polarization will decrease the time\nneeded to make the measurements by a factor of more than 2.5.

We use high-resolution convection-resolving\nsimulations to investigate ocean heat transport by slantwise convection in a\nparameter regime relevant to icy moons, isolated from baroclinic instability.\nTotal heat transport follows the Coriolis-Inertial-Archimedean scaling with an\nadded latitude dependence. The vertical transport increases with latitude, and\nthe meridional transport is poleward.

We show any group in $\\mathcal{C}$ is\nidentified by the $O(1)$-dimensional count-free Weisfeiler--Leman (WL)\nalgorithm with $O(\\log \\log n)$ rounds, and the $O(1)$-dimensional counting WL\nalgorithm with $O(1)$ rounds.

We exhibit an $\\textsf{AC}^{3}$\ncanonical labeling procedure for this class.

Here, we take advantage of the fact that\ncentral quasigroups admit an affine decomposition in terms of an underlying\nAbelian group.

While previous multimodal\nresearch has focused primarily on vision and audio, haptic signals for the\nsense of touch remain underexplored. To address this gap, we formalize the\nhaptic captioning task and propose HapticLLaMA, a multimodal sensory language\nmodel that interprets vibration signals into descriptions in a given sensory,\nemotional, or associative category. We investigate two types of haptic\ntokenizers, a frequency-based tokenizer and an EnCodec-based tokenizer, that\nconvert haptic signals into sequences of discrete units, enabling their\nintegration with the LLaMA model. HapticLLaMA is trained in two stages: (1)\nsupervised fine-tuning using the LLaMA architecture with LoRA-based adaptation,\nand (2) fine-tuning via reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). We\nassess HapticLLaMA's captioning performance using both automated n-gram metrics\nand human evaluation. HapticLLaMA demonstrates strong capability in\ninterpreting haptic vibration signals, achieving a METEOR score of 59.98 and a\nBLEU-4 score of 32.06 respectively. Additionally, over 61% of the generated\ncaptions received human ratings above 3.5 on a 7-point scale, with RLHF\nyielding a 10% improvement in the overall rating distribution, indicating\nstronger alignment with human haptic perception.

Galaxy mergers are a commonly suggested\ncatalyst for starbursts, but once the galaxies coalesce into a single\nkinematically disturbed system, their merger history can be difficult to\nassess. This is particularly true for dwarf galaxies, which are expected to\ndominate the merger rate at all redshifts due to their large numbers. One such\ndwarf galaxy undergoing an enigmatic starburst episode is Henize 2-10, which\nappears to be isolated. Possible scenarios that might have caused the starburst\nepisode include a previous merger or stochastic processes within the galaxy\nitself, such as self-regulation via feedback processes. We present new VLA\n21-cm observations and unpublished archival CARMA CO data to investigate the\ndynamical state and star formation activity in the galaxy. We do not detect an\nHI tail consistent with the structure reported by Kobulnicky et al. (1995),\nwhich was suggested as evidence for a merger or interaction, but rather these\nnew observations indicate an extended HI distribution. We also find that the HI\nappears dynamically decoupled from an extended CO feature (inferred to be a\ntidal tail in previous work), suggesting large-scale dynamical processes of\nsome type are affecting the gas in this system. We provide a meta-analysis of\navailable results to enhance our understanding of what might be triggering the\nstarburst episode in Henize 2-10, and speculate that the large CO feature could\nbe falling into the galaxy and potentially trigger starburst activity.",

    "abstract": "The rapid advancement of Generative AI (GenAI) relies heavily on the digital\ncommons, a vast collection of free and open online content that is created,\nshared, and maintained by communities. However, this relationship is becoming\nincreasingly strained due to financial burdens, decreased contributions, and\nmisalignment between AI models and community norms. As we move deeper into the\nGenAI era, it is essential to examine the interdependent relationship between\nGenAI, the long-term sustainability of the digital commons, and the equity of\ncurrent AI development practices. We highlight five critical questions that\nrequire urgent attention: 1. How can we prevent the digital commons from being\nthreatened by undersupply as individuals cease contributing to the commons and\nturn to Generative AI for information? 2. How can we mitigate the risk of the\nopen web closing due to restrictions on access to curb AI crawlers? 3. How can\ntechnical standards and legal frameworks be updated to reflect the evolving\nneeds of organizations hosting common content? 4. What are the effects of\nincreased synthetic content in open knowledge databases, and how can we ensure\ntheir integrity? 5. How can we account for and distribute the infrastructural\nand environmental costs of providing data for AI training? We emphasize the\nneed for more responsible practices in AI development, recognizing the digital\ncommons not only as content but as a collaborative and decentralized form of\nknowledge governance, which relies on the practice of \"commoning\" - making,\nmaintaining, and protecting shared and open resources. Ultimately, our goal is\nto stimulate discussion and research on the intersection of Generative AI and\nthe digital commons, with the aim of developing an \"AI commons\" and public\ninfrastructures for AI development that support the long-term health of the\ndigital commons.",

One major challenge of service provisioning in slice-enabled\nnetworks is the uncertainty in the demand for the limited network resources\nthat must be shared among existing slices and potentially new Network Slice\nRequests. In this paper, we consider admission control of Network Slice\nRequests in an online setting, with the goal of maximizing the long-term\nrevenue received from admitted requests. We model the Slice Admission Control\nproblem as an Online Multidimensional Knapsack Problem and present two\nreservation-based policies and their algorithms, which have a competitive\nperformance for Online Multidimensional Knapsack Problems. Through Monte Carlo\nsimulations, we evaluate the performance of our online admission control method\nin terms of average revenue gained by the Infrastructure Provider, system\nresource utilization, and the ratio of accepted slice requests. We compare our\napproach with those of the online First Come First Serve greedy policy. The\nsimulation's results prove that our proposed online policies increase revenues\nfor Infrastructure Providers by up to 12.9 % while reducing the average\nresource consumption by up to 1.7% In particular, when the tenants' economic\ninequality increases, an Infrastructure Provider who adopts our proposed online\nadmission policies gains higher revenues compared to an Infrastructure Provider\nwho adopts First Come First Serve.",

In this\nstudy, First principles based density functional theory (DFT) calculations were\ncarried out to investigate the electronic band structure modifications arising\nfrom CDW modulation. Angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) revealed\nthe emergence of a CDW gap at the Fermi level, as well as hybridization induced\ngap features at lower binding energies. The low lying CDW gap reaches its\nmaximum along the Gamma-Y high-symmetry direction and a minimum along GX\nreflecting the anisotropic nature of the electronic structure.

Recent\nstudies on MDCK monolayers cultured on soft substrates have revealed that cells\ncan align to create regions of local nematic order, and topological defects\nthat generate localised mechanical stresses which can spontaneously trigger\nhole formation. To investigate this process, we develop a continuum multi-phase\nfield model that incorporates internal dissipation and active dipolar forces\nthat drive cell shape anisotropy. Our simulations show that reducing substrate\nfriction enhances cell-cell velocity correlations. In this low-friction regime,\ntopological defects give rise to spiral flow patterns that concentrate stress\nand can trigger hole formation. We further demonstrate that the number and\nstability of the holes, whether they close or persist, depends on both\nsubstrate friction and cellular activity.

    "abstract": "Clustering is a fundamental technique in data analysis, with the $k$-means\nbeing one of the widely studied objectives due to its simplicity and broad\napplicability. In many practical scenarios, data points come with associated\nweights that reflect their importance, frequency, or confidence. Given a\nweighted point set $P \\subset R^d$, where each point $p \\in P$ has a positive\nweight $w_p$, the goal is to compute a set of $k$ centers $C = \\{ c_1, c_2,\n\\ldots, c_k \\} \\subset R^d$ that minimizes the weighted clustering cost:\n$\\Delta_w(P,C) = \\sum_{p \\in P} w_p \\cdot d(p,C)^2$, where $d(p,C)$ denotes the\nEuclidean distance from $p$ to its nearest center in $C$. Although most\nexisting coreset-based algorithms for $k$-means extend naturally to the\nweighted setting and provide a PTAS, no prior work has offered a simple,\ncoreset-free PTAS designed specifically for the weighted $k$-means problem.\n  In this paper, we present a simple PTAS for weighted $k$-means that does not\nrely on coresets. Building upon the framework of Jaiswal, Kumar, and Sen (2012)\nfor the unweighted case, we extend the result to the weighted setting by using\nthe weighted $D^2$-sampling technique. Our algorithm runs in time $n d \\cdot\n2^{O\\left(\\frac{k^2}{\\epsilon}\\right)}$ and outputs a set of $k$ centers whose\ntotal clustering cost is within a $(1 + \\epsilon)$-factor of the optimal cost.\nAs a key application of the weighted $k$-means, we obtain a PTAS for the sensor\ncoverage problem, which can also be viewed as a continuous locational\noptimization problem. For this problem, the best-known result prior to our work\nwas an $O(\\log k)$-approximation by Deshpande (2014), whereas our algorithm\nguarantees a $(1 + \\epsilon)$-approximation to the optimal coverage cost even\nbefore applying refinement steps like Lloyd desent.",

The\naccuracy of MLIPs is typically validated on a held-out dataset of \\emph{ab\ninitio} energies and atomic forces. However, accuracy on these small-scale\nproperties does not guarantee reliability for emergent, system-level behavior\n-- precisely the regime where atomistic simulations are most needed, but for\nwhich direct validation is often computationally prohibitive. As a practical\nheuristic, predictive precision -- quantified as inverse uncertainty -- is\ncommonly used as a proxy for accuracy, but its reliability remains poorly\nunderstood, particularly for system-level predictions. In this work, we\nsystematically assess the relationship between predictive precision and\naccuracy in both in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) regimes,\nfocusing on ensemble-based uncertainty quantification methods for neural\nnetwork potentials, including bootstrap, dropout, random initialization, and\nsnapshot ensembles.

To enhance their versatility,\nthis paper presents a novel lifelong learning framework that incrementally\ntrains a neural solver to manage VRPs in distinct contexts. Specifically, we\npropose a lifelong learner (LL), exploiting a Transformer network as the\nbackbone, to solve a series of VRPs. The inter-context self-attention mechanism\nis proposed within LL to transfer the knowledge obtained from solving preceding\nVRPs into the succeeding ones. On top of that, we develop a dynamic context\nscheduler (DCS), employing the cross-context experience replay to further\nfacilitate LL looking back on the attained policies of solving preceding VRPs.\nExtensive results on synthetic and benchmark instances (problem sizes up to\n18k) show that our LL is capable of discovering effective policies for tackling\ngeneric VRPs in varying contexts, which outperforms other neural solvers and\nachieves the best performance for most VRPs.",

Prior\nworks showed that the language modality can help in the adaptation process,\nexhibiting more robustness to such complex shifts. In this paper, we introduce\nTRUST, a novel UDA approach that exploits the robustness of the language\nmodality to guide the adaptation of a vision model. TRUST generates\npseudo-labels for target samples from their captions and introduces a novel\nuncertainty estimation strategy that uses normalised CLIP similarity scores to\nestimate the uncertainty of the generated pseudo-labels. Such estimated\nuncertainty is then used to reweight the classification loss, mitigating the\nadverse effects of wrong pseudo-labels obtained from low-quality captions. To\nfurther increase the robustness of the vision model, we propose a multimodal\nsoft-contrastive learning loss that aligns the vision and language feature\nspaces, by leveraging captions to guide the contrastive training of the vision\nmodel on target images. In our contrastive loss, each pair of images acts as\nboth a positive and a negative pair and their feature representations are\nattracted and repulsed with a strength proportional to the similarity of their\ncaptions. This solution avoids the need for hardly determining positive and\nnegative pairs, which is critical in the UDA setting. Our approach outperforms\nprevious methods, setting the new state-of-the-art on classical (DomainNet) and\ncomplex (GeoNet) domain shifts. The code will be available upon acceptance.",

Several intriguing patterns\nwere discovered for the number of tilings of such regions, but the numbers\nthemselves were not ``round'' -- they didn't seem to be given by a simple\nproduct formula. In this paper we consider a very closely related shape of\nholes (namely, odd Aztec rectangles), and prove that a large variety of regions\nobtained from Aztec rectangles by making such holes in them possess the\nsought-after property that the number of their domino tilings is given by a\nsimple product formula. We find the same to be true for certain symmetric\ncruciform regions. We also consider graphs obtained from a toroidal Aztec\ndiamond by making such holes in them, and prove a simple formula that governs\nthe way the number of their perfect matchings changes under a natural evolution\nof the holes.

In this work, we propose SlimInfer, an innovative\nframework that aims to accelerate inference by directly pruning less critical\nprompt tokens during the forward pass. Our key insight is an information\ndiffusion phenomenon: As information from critical tokens propagates through\nlayers, it becomes distributed across the entire sequence. This diffusion\nprocess suggests that LLMs can maintain their semantic integrity when excessive\ntokens, even including these critical ones, are pruned in hidden states.\nMotivated by this, SlimInfer introduces a dynamic fine-grained pruning\nmechanism that accurately removes redundant tokens of hidden state at\nintermediate layers. This layer-wise pruning naturally enables an asynchronous\nKV cache manager that prefetches required token blocks without complex\npredictors, reducing both memory usage and I/O costs.

    "abstract": "Nonreciprocal interactions often create conflicting dynamical objectives that\ncannot be simultaneously satisfied, leading to nonreciprocal frustration. On\nthe other hand, geometric frustration arises when conflicting static objectives\nin energy minimization cannot be satisfied. In this work, we show that\nnonreciprocal interaction among three collective quantum spins, mediated by a\ndamped cavity, induces not only nonreciprocal frustration, intrinsic to\nnonreciprocity, but also geometric frustration with a remarkable robustness\nagainst disorder. It therefore ensures that the accidental degeneracy for\nsteady states remains intact even when the system is perturbed away from a\nfine-tuned point of enhanced symmetry, in sharp contrast to the equilibrium\ncase. Leveraging this finding, we identify a nonreciprocal phase transition\ndriven by both geometric and nonreciprocal frustration. It gives rise to a\ntime-dependent state, which shows a chiral dynamics along a geometry shaped by\nthe geometric frustration and dynamically restores the broken discrete\nsymmetries. Moreover, it constitutes a time-crystalline order, with multiple\nharmonics set by an emergent time scale that exhibits critical slowing down.\nOur predictions have important physical implications for a three-component\nspinor BEC-cavity system, which manifest as a geometric frustration in the\nstructural phase transition and chiral dynamics of the frustrated\nself-organized BECs. We demonstrate the feasibility of experimental observation\ndespite the presence of disorder in the spin-cavity coupling strengths.",

    "abstract": "An emerging field of AI, namely Fair Machine Learning (ML), aims to quantify\ndifferent types of bias (also known as unfairness) exhibited in the predictions\nof ML algorithms, and to design new algorithms to mitigate them. Often, the\ndefinitions of bias used in the literature are observational, i.e. they use the\ninput and output of a pre-trained algorithm to quantify a bias under concern.\nIn reality,these definitions are often conflicting in nature and can only be\ndeployed if either the ground truth is known or only in retrospect after\ndeploying the algorithm. Thus,there is a gap between what we want Fair ML to\nachieve and what it does in a dynamic social environment. Hence, we propose an\nalternative dynamic mechanism,\"Fair Game\",to assure fairness in the predictions\nof an ML algorithm and to adapt its predictions as the society interacts with\nthe algorithm over time. \"Fair Game\" puts together an Auditor and a Debiasing\nalgorithm in a loop around an ML algorithm. The \"Fair Game\" puts these two\ncomponents in a loop by leveraging Reinforcement Learning (RL). RL algorithms\ninteract with an environment to take decisions, which yields new observations\n(also known as data/feedback) from the environment and in turn, adapts future\ndecisions. RL is already used in algorithms with pre-fixed long-term fairness\ngoals. \"Fair Game\" provides a unique framework where the fairness goals can be\nadapted over time by only modifying the auditor and the different biases it\nquantifies. Thus,\"Fair Game\" aims to simulate the evolution of ethical and\nlegal frameworks in the society by creating an auditor which sends feedback to\na debiasing algorithm deployed around an ML system. This allows us to develop a\nflexible and adaptive-over-time framework to build Fair ML systems pre- and\npost-deployment.",

We propose Cognitive Workspace, a novel paradigm that transcends\ntraditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by emulating human cognitive\nmechanisms of external memory use. Drawing from cognitive science foundations\nincluding Baddeley's working memory model, Clark's extended mind thesis, and\nHutchins' distributed cognition framework, we demonstrate that current passive\nretrieval systems fail to capture the dynamic, task-driven nature of human\nmemory management. Our analysis of 2024-2025 developments reveals that while\ntechniques like Infini-attention and StreamingLLM achieve impressive context\nlengths, they lack the metacognitive awareness and active planning capabilities\nessential for true cognitive extension. Cognitive Workspace addresses these\nlimitations through three core innovations: (1) active memory management with\ndeliberate information curation, (2) hierarchical cognitive buffers enabling\npersistent working states, and (3) task-driven context optimization that\ndynamically adapts to cognitive demands. Empirical validation demonstrates\nCognitive Workspace achieves an average 58.6% memory reuse rate (ranging from\n54-60% across different tasks) compared to 0% for traditional RAG, with 17-18%\nnet efficiency gain despite 3.3x higher operation counts. Statistical analysis\nconfirms these advantages with p < 0.001 and Cohen's d > 23 across multiple\ntask types, establishing the first quantitative evidence for active memory\nsuperiority in LLM systems.

Square triangular numbers were characterized by Euler in 1778 and are in\none-to-one correspondence with the so-called near-isosceles Pythagorean triples\n$(k,k+1,l)$, where $k^2 + (k+1)^2 = l^2$. A quadratic number is the product\n$\\Pi = \\Pi(k,j) = k(k+1)(k+j)(k+j+1)$ for some nonnegative integer numbers $k$\nand $j$.

    "abstract": "Low-altitude unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are expected to play an\nimportant role for low-altitude economy with a wide range of applications like\nprecise agriculture, aerial delivery and surveillance. Integrated sensing and\ncommunication (ISAC) is a key technology to enable the large-scale deployment\nand routine usage of UAVs by providing both communication and sensing services\nefficiently. For UAV ISAC systems, as UAV often acts as both a communication\nuser equipment (UE) and a sensing target, traditional ISAC systems that usually\nallocate dedicated TF resources for sensing are inefficient due to the severe\ndegradation of communication spectral efficiency. To address this issue, in\nthis paper, we propose a novel multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) orthogonal\nfrequency division multiplexing (OFDM)-based ISAC framework for UAVs that\neliminates the need for dedicated sensing TF resources, achieving zero TF\nsensing overhead. By designing the transmit beamforming to meet the\nrequirements for both communication and sensing tasks, our proposed approach\nenables the communication TF resources to be fully reused for sensing, thereby\nenhancing both the communication sum rate and the sensing performance in terms\nof resolution, unambiguous range, and accuracy. Additionally, we introduce a\nlow-complexity target searching beamforming algorithm and a two-stage\nsuper-resolution sensing algorithm, which ensure efficient implementation.\nSimulation results demonstrate that the proposed MIMO-OFDM-ISAC framework not\nonly improves the communication sum rate but also outperforms traditional ISAC\nsystems in sensing performance, making it a promising solution for future ISAC\nsystems to support low-altitude UAVs.",

Therefore the\ndensity of these nano-particles is not homogeneous and the different parts have\ndifferent optical characteristics.

In this paper, we investigate the underlying cause of this\nlimited generalization capability. We identify shortcut learning -- the\nreliance on task-irrelevant features -- as a key impediment to generalization.\nThrough comprehensive theoretical and empirical analysis, we uncover two\nprimary contributors to shortcut learning: (1) limited diversity within\nindividual sub-datasets, and (2) significant distributional disparities across\nsub-datasets, leading to dataset fragmentation. These issues arise from the\ninherent structure of large-scale datasets like OXE, which are typically\ncomposed of multiple sub-datasets collected independently across varied\nenvironments and embodiments. Our findings provide critical insights into\ndataset collection strategies that can reduce shortcut learning and enhance the\ngeneralization ability of generalist robot policies. Moreover, in scenarios\nwhere acquiring new large-scale data is impractical, we demonstrate that\ncarefully selected robotic data augmentation strategies can effectively reduce\nshortcut learning in existing offline datasets, thereby improving\ngeneralization capabilities of generalist robot policies, e.g., $\\pi_0$, in\nboth simulation and real-world environments.

To address these\nlimitations, we propose Learning to Detect (LoD), a novel unsupervised\nframework that formulates jailbreak detection as anomaly detection. LoD\nintroduces two key components: Multi-modal Safety Concept Activation Vectors\n(MSCAV), which capture layer-wise safety-related representations across\nmodalities, and the Safety Pattern Auto-Encoder, which models the distribution\nof MSCAV derived from safe inputs and detects anomalies via reconstruction\nerrors. By training the auto-encoder (AE) solely on safe samples without attack\nlabels, LoD naturally identifies jailbreak inputs as distributional anomalies,\nenabling accurate and unified detection of jailbreak attacks. Comprehensive\nexperiments on three different LVLMs and five benchmarks demonstrate that LoD\nachieves state-of-the-art performance, with an average AUROC of 0.9951 and an\nimprovement of up to 38.89% in the minimum AUROC over the strongest baselines.",

However,\nthese methods are often plagued by low sample efficiency and a susceptibility\nto primacy bias, where overfitting to initial experiences degrades policy\nquality and damages the learning process. To address these challenges, we\nintroduce LLM optimization with Reset Replay (LoRR), a general and powerful\nplugin designed to enhance sample efficiency in any preference-based\noptimization framework. LoRR core mechanism enables training at a high replay\nnumber, maximizing the utility of each collected data batch. To counteract the\nrisk of overfitting inherent in high-replay training, LoRR incorporates a\nperiodic reset strategy with reusing initial data, which preserves network\nplasticity. Furthermore, it leverages a hybrid optimization objective,\ncombining supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and preference-based losses to further\nbolster data exploitation. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that LoRR\nsignificantly boosts the performance of various preference optimization methods\non both mathematical and general reasoning benchmarks. Notably, an iterative\nDPO approach augmented with LoRR achieves comparable performance on challenging\nmath tasks, outperforming some complex and computationally intensive RL-based\nalgorithms.

The results reveal several new findings due to the\npresence of TCR: first, the larger the TCR, the faster the OSM converges;\nsecond, mesh-independent convergence is achieved in the asymptotic sense, in\ncontrast to the mesh-dependent results without TCR; and last, the heterogeneity\ncontrast benefits the convergence, with a larger contrast leading to faster\nconvergence.

We introduce V*, a graph-based motion\nplanner that represents speed and direction as explicit state variables within\na discretised space-time-velocity lattice. Unlike traditional methods that\ndecouple spatial search from dynamic feasibility or rely on post-hoc smoothing,\nV* integrates both motion dimensions directly into graph construction through\ndynamic graph generation during search expansion. To manage the complexity of\nhigh-dimensional search, we employ a hexagonal discretisation strategy and\nprovide formal mathematical proofs establishing optimal waypoint spacing and\nminimal node redundancy under constrained heading transitions for\nvelocity-aware motion planning. We develop a mathematical formulation for\ntransient steering dynamics in the kinematic bicycle model, modelling steering\nangle convergence with exponential behaviour, and deriving the relationship for\nconvergence rate parameters. This theoretical foundation, combined with\ngeometric pruning strategies that eliminate expansions leading to infeasible\nsteering configurations, enables V* to evaluate dynamically admissible\nmanoeuvres, ensuring each trajectory is physically realisable without further\nrefinement. We further demonstrate V*'s performance in simulation studies with\ncluttered and dynamic environments involving moving obstacles, showing its\nability to avoid conflicts, yield proactively, and generate safe, efficient\ntrajectories with temporal reasoning capabilities for waiting behaviours and\ndynamic coordination.",

However, the efficacy of this approach depends on two\nfactors: (1) the strategic allocation of reviewers and (2) the number of\nreviews per artifact. This paper presents a systematic literature review of 87\nstudies (2010--2024) to investigate how reviewer-assignment strategies and the\nnumber of reviews per submission impact the accuracy, fairness, and educational\nvalue of peer assessment. We identified four common reviewer-assignment\nstrategies: random assignment, competency-based assignment,\nsocial-network-based assignment, and bidding. Drawing from both quantitative\ndata and qualitative insights, we explored the trade-offs involved in each\napproach. Random assignment, while widely used, often results in inconsistent\ngrading and fairness concerns. Competency-based strategies can address these\nissues. Meanwhile, social and bidding-based methods have the potential to\nimprove fairness and timeliness -- existing empirical evidence is limited. In\nterms of review count, assigning three reviews per submission emerges as the\nmost common practice. A range of three to five reviews per student or per\nsubmission is frequently cited as a recommended spot that balances grading\naccuracy, student workload, learning outcomes, and engagement.",

We give a unified characterisation of slope\ndetection, and conjecture that the relative $L$-space conjecture is equivalent\nto the $L$-space conjecture for toroidal manifolds. We confirm this equivalence\nfor the properties $CTF$ and $NLS$.\n  Much of our technical work lies in proving that the set of $CTF$-detected\nslopes on $\\partial M$ is a finite union of possibly degenerate closed\nintervals with rational endpoints; in particular, it is closed in the space of\nslopes. This involves generalizing results of Tao Li on laminar branched\nsurfaces to the setting of manifolds with boundary.\n  Within the slopes detected by co-orientable taut foliations, we identify a\nspecial subset, which we call exceptional $CTF$-detected slopes. This set\nincludes $CTF$-detected slopes whose associated Dehn fillings don't admit\nco-orientable taut foliations. We believe this exceptional set is important to\nunderstand.

    "abstract": "Peer grading has emerged as a scalable solution for assessment in large and\nonline classrooms, offering both logistical efficiency and pedagogical value.\nHowever, designing effective peer-grading systems remains challenging due to\npersistent concerns around accuracy, fairness, reliability, and student\nengagement. This paper presents a systematic review of 122 peer-reviewed\nstudies on peer grading spanning over four decades. Drawing from this\nliterature, we propose a comprehensive taxonomy that organizes peer grading\nsystems along two key dimensions: (1) evaluation approaches and (2) reviewer\nweighting strategies. We analyze how different design choices impact grading\naccuracy, fairness, student workload, and learning outcomes. Our findings\nhighlight the strengths and limitations of each method. Notably, we found that\nformative feedback -- often regarded as the most valuable aspect of peer\nassessment -- is seldom incorporated as a quality-based weighting factor in\nsummative grade synthesis techniques. Furthermore, no single reviewer weighting\nstrategy proves universally optimal; each has its trade-offs. Hybrid strategies\nthat combine multiple techniques could show the greatest promise. Our taxonomy\noffers a practical framework for educators and researchers aiming to design\npeer grading systems that are accurate, equitable, and pedagogically\nmeaningful.",

To address this research gap, we focus on anime characters as a\ncase study because of their well-defined personalities and large fan bases.\nThis choice enables us to effectively evaluate how well LLMs can provide\nemotional support while maintaining specific character traits. We introduce\nChatAnime, the first Emotionally Supportive Role-Playing (ESRP) dataset.

Then, we execute a\nnationwide selection process to identify 40 Chinese anime enthusiasts with\nprofound knowledge of specific characters and extensive experience in\nrole-playing. Next, we systematically collect two rounds of dialogue data from\n10 LLMs and these 40 Chinese anime enthusiasts. To evaluate the ESRP\nperformance of LLMs, we design a user experience-oriented evaluation system\nfeaturing 9 fine-grained metrics across three dimensions: basic dialogue,\nrole-playing and emotional support, along with an overall metric for response\ndiversity. In total, the dataset comprises 2,400 human-written and 24,000\nLLM-generated answers, supported by over 132,000 human annotations.\nExperimental results show that top-performing LLMs surpass human fans in\nrole-playing and emotional support, while humans still lead in response\ndiversity.

However, its effectiveness relies on robust identity\nauthentication, as vulnerabilities in the authentication process can cause a\ncompromise with the security of the entire communication system. Over the past\nthree decades, numerous quantum identity authentication (QIA) protocols have\nbeen proposed. This thesis first presents a chronological review of these\nprotocols, categorizing them based on quantum resources and computational tasks\ninvolved while analyzing their strengths and limitations. Subsequently, by\nrecognizing inherent symmetries present in the existing protocols, we design\nnovel QIA schemes based on secure computational and communication tasks.\nSpecifically, this work introduces a set of new QIA protocols that utilize\ncontrolled secure direct quantum communication. The proposed scheme facilitates\nmutual authentication between two users, Alice and Bob, with assistance from a\nthird party, Charlie, using Bell states. A comprehensive security analysis\ndemonstrates its robustness against impersonation, intercept-resend, and\nfraudulent authentication attacks. The comparative evaluation highlights its\nadvantages over existing schemes. Additionally, this thesis presents two novel\nQKD protocols that eliminate the need for entanglement or ideal single-photon\nsources, making them feasible with commercially available photon sources. These\nprotocols are rigorously proven to be secure against various attacks, including\nintercept-resend and certain collective attacks.

We prove generic upper bounds on the error and sample\ncomplexity of DP-SPRT that can accommodate various noise distributions based on\nthe practitioner's privacy needs. We exemplify them in two settings: Laplace\nnoise (pure Differential Privacy) and Gaussian noise (R\\'enyi differential\nprivacy). In the former setting, by providing a lower bound on the sample\ncomplexity of any $\\epsilon$-DP test with prescribed type I and type II errors,\nwe show that DP-SPRT is near optimal when both errors are small and the two\nhypotheses are close. Moreover, we conduct an experimental study revealing its\ngood practical performance.",

Existing SDR systems typically adopt a cascaded framework, combining\nmultiple modules such as speaker diarization (SD) and automatic speech\nrecognition (ASR). The cascaded systems suffer from several limitations, such\nas error propagation, difficulty in handling overlapping speech, and lack of\njoint optimization for exploring the synergy between SD and ASR tasks. To\naddress these limitations, we introduce SpeakerLM, a unified multimodal large\nlanguage model for SDR that jointly performs SD and ASR in an end-to-end\nmanner. Moreover, to facilitate diverse real-world scenarios, we incorporate a\nflexible speaker registration mechanism into SpeakerLM, enabling SDR under\ndifferent speaker registration settings. SpeakerLM is progressively developed\nwith a multi-stage training strategy on large-scale real data. Extensive\nexperiments show that SpeakerLM demonstrates strong data scaling capability and\ngeneralizability, outperforming state-of-the-art cascaded baselines on both\nin-domain and out-of-domain public SDR benchmarks. Furthermore, experimental\nresults show that the proposed speaker registration mechanism effectively\nensures robust SDR performance of SpeakerLM across diverse speaker registration\nconditions and varying numbers of registered speakers.",

Bifurcation analysis reveals that\nimperfections lower the critical overpressure for buckling, guiding the bubble\nalong stable branches with transitions influenced by the nature of the\nimperfections. The resulting branches emerge as unfoldings of bifurcation\ndiagrams and closely resemble solution families emanating from the standard\nbifurcation diagram of a perfect sphere. Dynamic simulations for fixed forcing\nfrequency demonstrate that the microbubble buckles at the defective pole and at\nmaximum compression adopts the shape corresponding to the buckled shape that\nemerges in the static bifurcation diagram for the same pressure disturbance.\nSimulations further reveal that the deformed microbubble exhibits translational\nmotion in the direction of concavity, driven by the balance between pressure\nand viscous drag, both aligned with this motion as a result of the deformed\nshape acquired by the microbubble. The translational speed is highly dependent\non the shell stretching and bending elasticities and forcing frequency, with an\noptimal speed achieved when the forcing frequency equals the difference between\nthe resonance frequencies of the initial shape and the compressed static shape\ncorresponding to the imposed sound amplitude. Higher sound amplitude or lower\nbending resistance lead to more pronounced deformations that enhance\ntranslational motion.

Among the\navailable implementations, the superconducting technology is the current focus\nof scientific research and industrial applications, excelling in performance\nand scalability. Despite this, superconducting quantum systems are extremely\nprone to decoherence, and in particular, they are highly sensitive to radiation\nevents. In this paper, we analyze the response of a superconducting device\n(SQUID) to radiation. We expose the SQUID to beams of monoenergetic 14 MeV\nneutrons (NILE - ISIS), atmospheric 1-800 MeV neutrons (ChipIR - ISIS), and\ngamma rays with 1.25 MeV average energy (CALLIOPE - ENEA). These experiments\nshow that the SQUID is sensitive to the two neutron fields, while gamma rays at\n1.25 MeV leave it mostly unaffected. Following our experiments with neutrons,\nit is possible to characterize the SQUID's response and even classify faults\naccording to their shape and duration. We identify two categories: bursts (long\nlasting) and peaks (short lived). To investigate the different responses to\nneutrons and gamma rays, we employ Geant4 simulations, which highlight\ndifferences in the deposition spectra and the energy propagation, but likewise\npredict the vulnerability of the SQUID in both cases.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely deployed in reasoning,\nplanning, and decision-making tasks, making their trustworthiness a critical\nconcern. The potential for intentional deception, where an LLM deliberately\nfabricates or conceals information to serve a hidden objective, remains a\nsignificant and underexplored threat. Existing studies typically induce such\ndeception by explicitly setting a \"hidden\" objective through prompting or\nfine-tuning, which may not fully reflect real-world human-LLM interactions.\nMoving beyond this human-induced deception, we investigate LLMs' self-initiated\ndeception on benign prompts. To address the absence of ground truth in this\nevaluation, we propose a novel framework using \"contact searching questions.\"\nThis framework introduces two statistical metrics derived from psychological\nprinciples to quantify the likelihood of deception. The first, the Deceptive\nIntention Score, measures the model's bias towards a hidden objective. The\nsecond, Deceptive Behavior Score, measures the inconsistency between the LLM's\ninternal belief and its expressed output. Upon evaluating 14 leading LLMs, we\nfind that both metrics escalate as task difficulty increases, rising in\nparallel for most models. Building on these findings, we formulate a\nmathematical model to explain this behavior. These results reveal that even the\nmost advanced LLMs exhibit an increasing tendency toward deception when\nhandling complex problems, raising critical concerns for the deployment of LLM\nagents in complex and crucial domains.",

We first find that LWPP is an unreliable estimator of the true\nenergy, limiting its utility as a direct simulator. However, we uncover its\nreal value: despite this numerical inaccuracy, its approximate optimization\nlandscape robustly guides parameters toward high-quality basins of attraction.\nWe therefore propose harnessing LWPP not for simulation, but as a classical\npre-optimizer to find superior initial parameters for the main VQA loop.\nBenchmarking this strategy on Heisenberg models, we demonstrate a remarkable\nenhancement in both the final accuracy and convergence rate, typically by an\norder of magnitude, over standard heuristics.

To support this, we\nintroduce and publicly release CS2CD: A labelled dataset of 795 matches. Using\nthis dataset, 90,707 context windows were created and subsequently augmented to\naddress class imbalance. The transformer model, trained on these windows,\nachieved an accuracy of 89.17\\% and an AUC of 93.36\\% on an unaugmented test\nset.

In this work, we introduce Fractional\nClassification Loss (FCL), an adaptive robust loss that automatically\ncalibrates its robustness to label noise during training. Built within the\nactive-passive loss framework, FCL employs the fractional derivative of the\nCross-Entropy (CE) loss as its active component and the Mean Absolute Error\n(MAE) as its passive loss component. With this formulation, we demonstrate that\nthe fractional derivative order $\\mu$ spans a family of loss functions that\ninterpolate between MAE-like robustness and CE-like fast convergence.\nFurthermore, we integrate $\\mu$ into the gradient-based optimization as a\nlearnable parameter and automatically adjust it to optimize the trade-off\nbetween robustness and convergence speed. We reveal that FCL's unique property\nestablishes a critical trade-off that enables the stable learning of $\\mu$:\nlower log penalties on difficult or mislabeled examples improve robustness but\nimpose higher penalties on easy or clean data, reducing model confidence in\nthem. Consequently, FCL can dynamically reshape its loss landscape to achieve\neffective classification performance under label noise.

This work introduces Nail, a Chisel-based open-source FI\nframework that overcomes these limitations by introducing state-based faults.\nThis approach enables fault scenarios that depend on specific system states,\nrather than solely on instruction-level triggers, thereby removing the need for\nprecise timing of fault activation. For greater controllability, Nail allows\nusers to arbitrarily modify internal trigger states via software at runtime. To\nsupport this, Nail automatically generates a software interface, offering\nstraightforward access to the instrumented design. This enables fine-tuning of\nfault parameters during active FI campaigns - a feature particularly beneficial\nfor FPGA emulation, where synthesis is time-consuming. Utilizing these\nfeatures, Nail narrows the gap between the high speed of emulation-based FI\nframeworks, the usability of software-based approaches, and the controllability\nachieved in simulation. We demonstrate Nail's state-based FI and software\nframework by modeling a faulty general-purpose register in a RISC-V processor.\nAlthough this might appear straightforward, it requires state-dependent FI and\nwas previously impossible without fundamental changes to the design.

As a proof of concept, we analyzed 2,998 street view images\nfrom 15 cities using a multimodal large language model guided by Mehta's\ntaxonomy of passive, fleeting, and enduring sociability -- one illustrative\nexample of a theory grounded in urban design that could be substituted or\ncomplemented by other sociological frameworks.

Results aligned with long-standing urban\nplanning theory: the sky view index was associated with all three sociability\ntypes, the green view index predicted enduring sociability, and place\nattachment was positively associated with fleeting sociability. These results\nprovide preliminary evidence that street view images can be used to infer\nrelationships between specific types of social interactions and built\nenvironment variables.

    "abstract": "Feature importance (FI) statistics provide a prominent and valuable method of\ninsight into the decision process of machine learning (ML) models, but their\neffectiveness has well-known limitations when correlation is present among the\nfeatures in the training data. In this case, the FI often tends to be\ndistributed among all features which are in correlation with the\nresponse-generating signal features. Even worse, if multiple signal features\nare in strong correlation with a noise feature, while being only modestly\ncorrelated with one another, this can result in a noise feature having a\ndistinctly larger FI score than any signal feature. Here we propose local\nsample weighting (losaw) which can flexibly be integrated into many ML\nalgorithms to improve FI scores in the presence of feature correlation in the\ntraining data. Our approach is motivated from inverse probability weighting in\ncausal inference and locally, within the ML model, uses a sample weighting\nscheme to decorrelate a target feature from the remaining features. This\nreduces model bias locally, whenever the effect of a potential signal feature\nis evaluated and compared to others. Moreover, losaw comes with a natural\ntuning parameter, the minimum effective sample size of the weighted population,\nwhich corresponds to an interpretation-prediction-tradeoff, analog to a\nbias-variance-tradeoff as for classical ML tuning parameters. We demonstrate\nhow losaw can be integrated within decision tree-based ML methods and within\nmini-batch training of neural networks. We investigate losaw for random forest\nand convolutional neural networks in a simulation study on settings showing\ndiverse correlation patterns. We found that losaw improves FI consistently.\nMoreover, it often improves prediction accuracy for out-of-distribution, while\nmaintaining a similar accuracy for in-distribution test data.",

For\nthe $pp\\to pp\\pi^{+}\\pi^{-}$ reaction, we calculate differential cross sections\nas function of the two-pion invariant mass, pion transverse momentum and pion\npseudorapidity. Predictions of proton-pion and proton-pion-pion invariant mass\ndistributions and the distribution in the proton-proton four-momentum transfer\nsquared are also presented. This research is relevant in the context of ALICE,\nATLAS, CMS, and LHCb measurements in $pp$ collisions, even when the leading\nprotons are not detected and instead only rapidity-gap conditions are checked\nexperimentally. Our results can also serve as basis for the description of\ncoherent $\\pi^{+}\\pi^{-}$ production in ultra-peripheral $p$A and AA collisions\nat the LHC. The formulas given in our paper can directly be used for the\nanalysis of photoproduction and small-$Q^{2}$ electroproduction in $ep$\ncollisions at high energies. Such data exist from the HERA experiments and will\nbe obtained in the future at the electron-ion colliders.",

This\nchallenge limits the deployment of trained AI models in real-world scenarios,\nwhere performance degrades on unseen domains. Traditional solutions involve\nincreasing the size of the dataset through ad-hoc image augmentation or\nadditional online training/transfer learning, which have several limitations.\nSynthetic data offers a promising alternative, but anatomical/structural\nconsistency constraints limit the effectiveness of generative models in\ncreating image-label pairs. To address this, we propose a diffusion model (DM)\ntrained on a source domain that generates synthetic cardiac MR images that\nresemble a given reference.

We assess the utility of our generative approach in\nmulti-centre cardiac MR segmentation, using the 2D nnU-Net, 3D nnU-Net and\nvanilla U-Net segmentation networks. We explore domain generalisation, where,\ndomain-invariant segmentation models are trained on synthetic source domain\ndata, and domain adaptation, where, we shift target domain data towards the\nsource domain using the DM. Both strategies significantly improved segmentation\nperformance on data from an unseen target domain, in terms of surface-based\nmetrics (Welch's t-test, p < 0.01), compared to training segmentation models on\nreal data alone.

In soft magneto-active laminates, the shear wave band\ngaps (i.e., the frequency intervals for which shear waves cannot propagate) can\nbe adjusted after fabrication by exploiting the magneto-elastic coupling. In\nthe present study, the control of shear wave propagation in magneto-active\nstratified media is revisited by means of homogenisation theory, and extended\nto nonlinear waves of moderate amplitude. Building upon earlier works, the\nlayers are modelled by means of a revised hard-magnetic material theory for\nwhich the total Cauchy stress is symmetric, and the incompressible elastic\nresponse is of generalised neo-Hookean type (encompassing Yeoh, Fung-Demiray,\nand Gent materials). Using asymptotic homogenisation, a nonlinear dispersive\nwave equation with cubic nonlinearity is derived, under certain simplifying\nassumptions. In passing, an effective strain energy function describing such\nlaminates is obtained. The combined effects of nonlinearity and wave dispersion\ncontribute to the formation of solitary waves, which are analysed using the\nhomogenised wave equation and a modified Korteweg-de Vries (mKdV) approximation\nof the latter. The mKdV equation is compared to direct numerical simulations of\nthe impact problem, and various consequences of these results are explored.

Under the\nWeakly-Supervised VAD (WSVAD) paradigm, only video-level labels are provided\nduring training, while predictions are made at the frame level. Although\nstate-of-the-art models perform well on simple anomalies (e.g., explosions),\nthey struggle with complex real-world events (e.g., shoplifting). This\ndifficulty stems from two key issues: (1) the inability of current models to\naddress the diversity of anomaly types, as they process all categories with a\nshared model, overlooking category-specific features; and (2) the weak\nsupervision signal, which lacks precise temporal information, limiting the\nability to capture nuanced anomalous patterns blended with normal events. To\naddress these challenges, we propose Gaussian Splatting-guided Mixture of\nExperts (GS-MoE), a novel framework that employs a set of expert models, each\nspecialized in capturing specific anomaly types. These experts are guided by a\ntemporal Gaussian splatting loss, enabling the model to leverage temporal\nconsistency and enhance weak supervision. The Gaussian splatting approach\nencourages a more precise and comprehensive representation of anomalies by\nfocusing on temporal segments most likely to contain abnormal events. The\npredictions from these specialized experts are integrated through a\nmixture-of-experts mechanism to model complex relationships across diverse\nanomaly patterns. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a\n91.58% AUC on the UCF-Crime dataset, and demonstrates superior results on\nXD-Violence and MSAD datasets. By leveraging category-specific expertise and\ntemporal guidance, GS-MoE sets a new benchmark for VAD under weak supervision.",

    "abstract": "Video Temporal Grounding (TG) aims to temporally locate video segments\nmatching a natural language description (a query) in a long video. While\nVision-Language Models (VLMs) are effective at holistic semantic matching, they\noften struggle with fine-grained temporal localisation. Recently, Group\nRelative Policy Optimisation (GRPO) reformulates the inference process as a\nreinforcement learning task, enabling fine-grained grounding and achieving\nstrong in-domain performance. However, GRPO relies on labelled data, making it\nunsuitable in unlabelled domains. Moreover, because videos are large and\nexpensive to store and process, performing full-scale adaptation introduces\nprohibitive latency and computational overhead, making it impractical for\nreal-time deployment. To overcome both problems, we introduce a Data-Efficient\nUnlabelled Cross-domain Temporal Grounding method, from which a model is first\ntrained on a labelled source domain, then adapted to a target domain using only\na small number of unlabelled videos from the target domain. This approach\neliminates the need for target annotation and keeps both computational and\nstorage overhead low enough to run in real time. Specifically, we introduce.\nUncertainty-quantified Rollout Policy Adaptation (URPA) for cross-domain\nknowledge transfer in learning video temporal grounding without target labels.\nURPA generates multiple candidate predictions using GRPO rollouts, averages\nthem to form a pseudo label, and estimates confidence from the variance across\nthese rollouts. This confidence then weights the training rewards, guiding the\nmodel to focus on reliable supervision. Experiments on three datasets across\nsix cross-domain settings show that URPA generalises well using only a few\nunlabelled target videos. Codes will be released once published.",

This paper presents omnitrees as an\nanisotropic generalization of octrees and related data structures. Omnitrees\nallow to refine only the locally most important dimensions, providing tree\nstructures that are less deep than bintrees and less wide than octrees. As a\nresult, the convergence of the AMR schemes can be increased by up to a factor\nof the dimensionality d for very anisotropic problems, quickly offsetting their\nmodest increase in storage overhead. We validate this finding on the problem of\nbinary shape representation across 4,166 three-dimensional objects: Omnitrees\nincrease the mean convergence rate by 1.5x, require less storage to achieve\nequivalent error bounds, and maximize the information density of the stored\nfunction faster than octrees. These advantages are projected to be even\nstronger for higher-dimensional problems. We provide a first validation by\nintroducing a time-dependent rotation to create four-dimensional\nrepresentations, and discuss the properties of their 4-d octree and omnitree\napproximations.

    "abstract": "Magnetic Particle Imaging (MPI) is a recent imaging modality where\nsuperparamagnetic nanoparticles are employed as tracers. The reconstruction\ntask is to obtain the spatial particle distribution from a voltage signal\ninduced by the particles. Generally, in computational imaging variational\nreconstruction techniques are common and rely on a mathematical model to\ndescribe the underlying physics. For the MPI reconstruction task we propose a\nmodel-based variational reconstruction technique which incorporates a higher\norder regularizer, where the regularizer is diagonalized by harmonic\neigenfunctions. The proposed image reconstruction algorithm features two major\nstages: in the first stage, the core stage, the components of the MPI core\nresponse are reconstructed. This is the MPI-specific data approximation task\nwhich we formulate as a variational problem incorporating the higher order\nregularizer. The relationship between the particle distribution, the MPI core\nresponse and the measured data is given by a mathematical model which was\nintroduced in our earlier research. According to this model the MPI core\nresponse is tied to the particle distribution by convolution. Therefore the\noutcome of the core stage yields the data for the second stage, the\ndeconvolution stage, in which the final reconstructed image is produced by\nsolving an ill-posed deconvolution problem in a robust way relying on earlier\nresearch. Interestingly, the quality of the final image depends significantly\non the quality of the result of the core stage. A contribution is thus the\nenhancement of the core stage via higher order regularization. We provide a\ntheoretical foundation for our approach and demonstrate its benefit with\nnumerical examples.",

We represent the associated\n$d$-torus as a collection of trajectories initialized at a ($d-1$)-torus. We\ndrive a set of ODEs that hold for any of these trajectories.

Publication characteristics such as contribution type, journal\ntype, and application to the rare disease setting was also noted. A narrative\ndescription of the selected publications was produced, detailing 6 unique\nmethods for expert elicitation and 10 unique methods for aggregation. We\ndiscuss the most popular methods used across standard and rare disease clinical\ntrials, along with any strengths and limitations.

Starting from a\none-dimensional chain of modulated elliptical gears, we demonstrate the\nemergence of localized edge states arising from quasiperiodic variation in the\ngears' moments of inertia, analogous to the topological edge modes of the\nAubry-Andre-Harper model. Under increasing excitation amplitude, the system\nundergoes a nonlinear transition, where edge localization breaks down and\nenergy delocalizes into the bulk. By coupling multiple such chains with varying\nmodulation phase, we construct a two-dimensional lattice in which the phase\nacts as a synthetic dimension.

    "abstract": "Background: Accurately estimating volumetric water content (VWC) can greatly\nenhance the prediction of landslide risk. The standard approach involves using\nlocally limited, invasive sensor measurements. Recently, however, electrical\nresistivity tomography (ERT) has emerged as a cost-effective, minimally\ninvasive, real-time, indirect method of monitoring VWC. However, linking ER to\nVWC poses distinct challenges. Purpose: Random forest models were developed to\nestimate and predict VWC from ER. Spatially and temporally heterogeneous\nmeasurements were conducted to improve robustness and accuracy. Methods: The\nmodels were trained using 370-500 ER sensor measurements at depths of 10, 50,\n150 and 190 cm. Precipitation and air temperature with a depth-dependent impact\ndelay were introduced to simulate infiltration. The models were then validated\nat various locations, and their predictive capabilities were examined. Results:\nIncluding precipitation and temperature as parameters reduced the mean absolute\nerror (MAE) by between 7.3% and 73.0%, depending on the depth. However, not all\noutliers could be eliminated. Delaying the model parameter depth-dependently\nreduced the maximum relative error (MaRE) by 14.7-56.0% and the mean relative\nerror (MRE) to below 2.8%. Observed uncertainties for the top meter remained\nfairly constant. A 24 h forecast revealed an MRE below 5% for all depths;\nhowever, outliers occurred more frequently. Nevertheless, models trained on\ndata from one location failed to generalize to other locations. VWC tomography\nbased on ERT revealed significant moisture bands at depths of one to two\nmeters. Conclusion: VWC can be reliably predicted from ERT. However, validation\nof VWC from ERT in different locations revealed significant deficits. It is\nexpected that an automated ERT training of models at various locations will\neliminate these differences.",

Extensive experiments on both\nreal-world and simulated environments show that S-Path achieves average\nreductions of 5.7x in planning time while maintaining comparable path\noptimality to classical sampling-based planners and surpassing them in complex\nscenarios, making it an efficient and interpretable path planner for\nenvironments represented by indoor 3D Scene Graphs.",

Traditional multilingual\nmodels, which require simultaneous access to all language data, are impractical\ndue to the sequential arrival of data and privacy constraints. Continual\nLearning (CL) offers a solution by enabling models to learn new languages\nsequentially without catastrophically forgetting previously learned knowledge.\nThis paper investigates CL for ASR on Indian languages using a subset of the\nIndicSUPERB benchmark. We employ a Conformer-based hybrid RNN-T/CTC model,\ninitially pretrained on Hindi, which is then incrementally trained on eight\nadditional Indian languages, for a total sequence of nine languages.

    "abstract": "Contemporary industrial cyber-physical production systems (CPPS) composed of\nrobotic workcells face significant challenges in the analysis of undesired\nconditions due to the flexibility of Industry 4.0 that disrupts traditional\nquality assurance mechanisms. This paper presents a novel industry-oriented\nsemantic model called Product-Process-Resource Asset Knowledge Graph (PPR-AKG),\nwhich is designed to analyze and mitigate undesired conditions in flexible\nCPPS. Built on top of the well-proven Product-Process-Resource (PPR) model\noriginating from ISA-95 and VDI-3682, a comprehensive OWL ontology addresses\nshortcomings of conventional model-driven engineering for CPPS, particularly\ninadequate undesired condition and error handling representation. The\nintegration of semantic technologies with large language models (LLMs) provides\nintuitive interfaces for factory operators, production planners, and engineers\nto interact with the entire model using natural language. Evaluation with the\nuse case addressing electric vehicle battery remanufacturing demonstrates that\nthe PPR-AKG approach efficiently supports resource allocation based on\nexplicitly represented capabilities as well as identification and mitigation of\nundesired conditions in production. The key contributions include (1) a\nholistic PPR-AKG model capturing multi-dimensional production knowledge, and\n(2) the useful combination of the PPR-AKG with LLM-based chatbots for human\ninteraction.",

Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have\ndemonstrated notable improvements in block error rate (BLER) under various\nchannel models and mobility scenarios. However, the high computational\ncomplexity and resource demands of deep CNNs pose challenges for deployment in\nresource-constrained edge systems. The 3rd Generation Partnership Project\n(3GPP) Release 20 highlights the pivotal role of artificial intelligence (AI)\nintegration in enabling advanced radio-access networks for 6G systems. The hard\nreal-time processing demands of 5G and 6G require efficient techniques such as\npost-training quantization (PTQ), quantization-aware training (QAT), pruning,\nand hybrid approaches to meet latency requirements. In this paper, we focus on\nPTQ to reduce model complexity by lowering the bit-width of weights, thereby\nenhancing computational efficiency. Our analysis employs symmetric uniform\nquantization, applying both per-tensor and per-channel PTQ to a neural receiver\nachieving performance comparable to full-precision models. Specifically, 8-bit\nper-channel quantization maintains BLER performance with minimal degradation,\nwhile 4-bit quantization shows great promise but requires further optimization\nto achieve target BLER levels.

For this paper to meaningfully do this, first the purpose of a\nDPIA is briefly summarized.

This paper documents at least specific methodological,\ntechnical and legal shortcomings of the initial DPIA of the CWA: 1) It only\nfocused on the app itself, neither on the whole processing procedure nor on the\ninfrastructure used. 2) It only briefly touched on the main data protection\nspecific attacker, the processing organization itself. And 3) The discussion of\neffective safeguards to all risks including such as the ones posed by Google\nand Apple has only insufficiently been worked out.

In this work, we propose\nthe Adaptive Diffusion Policy (ADP), a test-time adaptation method that\nintroduces two key inductive biases into the diffusion. First, we embed a\ngeometric manifold constraint that aligns denoising updates with task-relevant\nsubspaces, leveraging the fact that the relative pose between the end-effector\nand target scene provides a natural gradient direction, and guiding denoising\nalong the geodesic path of the manipulation manifold. Then, to reduce\nunnecessary exploration and accelerate convergence, we propose an analytically\nguided initialization: rather than sampling from an uninformative prior, we\ncompute a rough registration between the gripper and target scenes to propose a\nstructured initial noisy action. ADP is compatible with pre-trained diffusion\npolicies and requires no retraining, enabling test-time adaptation that tailors\nthe policy to specific tasks, thereby enhancing generalization across novel\ntasks and environments.

    "abstract": "Weighted model counting computes the sum of the rational-valued weights\nassociated with the satisfying assignments for a Boolean formula, where the\nweight of an assignment is given by the product of the weights assigned to the\npositive and negated variables comprising the assignment. Weighted model\ncounting finds applications across a variety of domains including probabilistic\nreasoning and quantitative risk assessment.\n  Most weighted model counting programs operate by (explicitly or implicitly)\nconverting the input formula into a form that enables arithmetic evaluation,\nusing multiplication for conjunctions and addition for disjunctions. Performing\nthis evaluation using floating-point arithmetic can yield inaccurate results,\nand it cannot quantify the level of precision achieved. Computing with rational\narithmetic gives exact results, but it is costly in both time and space.\n  This paper describes how to combine multiple numeric representations to\nefficiently compute weighted model counts that are guaranteed to achieve a\nuser-specified precision. When all weights are nonnegative, we prove that the\nprecision loss of arithmetic evaluation using floating-point arithmetic can be\ntightly bounded. We show that supplementing a standard IEEE double-precision\nrepresentation with a separate 64-bit exponent, a format we call extended-range\ndouble (ERD), avoids the underflow and overflow issues commonly encountered in\nweighted model counting.

An open question is how shear\nbanding is affected by active particles. Here, we address this issue by\ninvestigating ultrastable glasses that are doped with self-propelled particles\n(SPPs) that perform run-and-tumble motions. In the presence of active particles\nwe find a crossover from heterogeneous to homogeneous yielding. Through\nextensive computer simulations of a polydisperse model, which is capable of\nproducing ultrastable glasses using swap Monte Carlo Methods, we demonstrate\nthe progressive emergence of multiple shear bands under activity, leading to\ncontinuous and delayed yielding. Interestingly, we uncover a compensatory\nrelationship between active forces and global shear rates: a rise in one can\noffset a decline in the other, arising from the isomorphic-like behavior\nexhibited by different combinations of active forces and strain rates. We also\nidentify a non-monotonic relationship between yielding and persistence time:\nwhile the yield stress increases at shorter persistence times with increasing\nactive forces, it tends to decrease with longer persistence times. This\nobservation highlights a tunable range of activity that can modify the yielding\nmode.

This\nmakes FL a suitable learning paradigm for remote sensing (RS) image\nclassification tasks, where data centralization may be restricted due to legal\nand privacy constraints. However, a key challenge in applying FL to RS tasks is\nthe communication overhead caused by the frequent exchange of large model\nupdates between clients and the central server. To address this issue, in this\npaper we propose a novel strategy (denoted as FedX) that uses\nexplanation-guided pruning to reduce communication overhead by minimizing the\nsize of the transmitted models without compromising performance. FedX leverages\nbackpropagation-based explanation methods to estimate the task-specific\nimportance of model components and prunes the least relevant ones at the\ncentral server.

Results revealed that both interactive support systems -- the\ncustom-configured AI chatbot and tiered hints -- were significantly more\neffective than the textual support in reducing students' intrinsic and\nextraneous cognitive load. Furthermore, the AI chatbot yielded the most\ncomprehensive affective benefits, demonstrating significant improvements across\nall measured affective dimensions, when compared to the textual support. While\nthe chatbot consistently trended more positively than the tiered hints on\naffective measures, these differences were not statistically significant.

Our findings advocate for carbon-aware design principles and\nregulatory oversight in developing sustainable digital infrastructure in orbit.",

Even in the case where model weights are hidden behind a\nfine-tuning API, this gives attackers inadvertent access to a broadly\nmisaligned model in a way that can be hard to detect from the fine-tuning data\nalone. We present the first systematic study of in-training safeguards against\nEMA that are practical for providers who expose fine-tuning via an API. We\ninvestigate four training regularization interventions: (i) KL-divergence\nregularization toward a safe reference model, (ii) $\\ell_2$ distance in feature\nspace, (iii) projecting onto a safe subspace (SafeLoRA), and (iv) interleaving\nof a small amount of safe training examples from a general instruct-tuning\ndataset. We first evaluate the methods' emergent misalignment effect across\nfour malicious, EMA-inducing tasks. Second, we assess the methods' impacts on\nbenign tasks.

In this work, we study an inference scenario where the\nadversary observes only partial features of each sample and aims to infer\nwhether this observed subset was present in the training set of the target\nmodel. We define this problem as Partial Feature Membership Inference (PFMI).\nTo address this problem, we propose MRAD (Memory-guided Reconstruction and\nAnomaly Detection), a two-stage attack framework.

Empirical results\ndemonstrate that MRAD is effective across a range of datasets, and maintains\ncompatibility with various off-the-shelf anomaly detection techniques.

In this work, we ask the question: \"What is the\nmost efficient approach for implementing continuous rotations in a surface code\narchitecture?\" Several techniques have been developed to reduce the T-count or\nT-depth of rotations, such as Hamming weight phasing and catalyst towers.\nHowever, these methods often require additional a number of ancilla qubits, and\nthus the ultimate cost function one needs to optimise against should rather be\nthe total runtime or the total space required for performing a rotation. We\nexplicitly construct surface code layouts for catalyst towers in two practical\napplication examples in the context of option pricing: (a) implementing a phase\noracle circuit, which is a ubiquitous subroutine in many quantum algorithms,\nand (b) state preparation using a variational quantum circuit. Our analysis\nshows that, at small and medium code distances, catalyst towers not only reduce\nthe runtime but can also decrease the total spacetime volume of rotations.\nHowever, at large code distances, conventional Clifford+T synthesis may prove\nmore efficient. Additionally, we note that our conclusions are sensitive to\nspecific application scenarios and the choices of various parameters.\nNevertheless, catalyst towers may be particularly advantageous for early\nfault-tolerant quantum applications, where low and medium code distances are\nassumed and a spacetime tradeoff is needed to reduce the runtime of individual\ncircuit runs, such as in scenarios involving high circuit repetition counts.",

    "abstract": "Version 3.0 of the Message-Passing Interface (MPI) standard, released in\n2012, introduced a new set of language bindings for Fortran 2008. By making use\nof modern language features and the enhanced interoperability with C, there was\nfinally a type safe and standard conforming method to call MPI from Fortran.\nThis highly recommended use mpi_f08 language binding has since then been widely\nadopted among developers of modern Fortran applications. However, tool support\nfor the F08 bindings is still lacking almost a decade later, forcing users to\nrecede to the less safe and convenient interfaces. Full support for the F08\nbindings was added to the performance measurement infrastructure Score-P by\nimplementing MPI wrappers in Fortran. Wrappers cover the latest MPI standard\nversion 4.1 in its entirety, matching the features of the C wrappers. By\nimplementing the wrappers in modern Fortran, we can provide full support for\nMPI procedures passing attributes, info objects, or callbacks. The\nimplementation is regularly tested under the MPICH test suite. The new F08\nwrappers were already used by two fluid dynamics simulation codes -- Neko, a\nspectral finite-element code derived from Nek5000, and EPIC (Elliptical\nParcel-In-Cell) -- to successfully generate performance measurements. In this\nwork, we additionally present our design considerations and sketch out the\nimplementation, discussing the challenges we faced in the process. The key\ncomponent of the implementation is a code generator that produces approximately\n50k lines of MPI wrapper code to be used by Score-P, relying on the Python\npympistandard module to provide programmatic access to the extracted data from\nthe MPI standard.",

    "abstract": "Different CT segmentation datasets are typically obtained from different\nscanners under different capture settings and often provide segmentation labels\nfor a limited and often disjoint set of organs. Using these heterogeneous data\neffectively while preserving patient privacy can be challenging. This work\npresents a novel federated learning approach to achieve universal segmentation\nacross diverse abdominal CT datasets by utilizing model uncertainty for\naggregation and predictive uncertainty for inference. Our approach leverages\nthe inherent noise in stochastic mini-batch gradient descent to estimate a\ndistribution over the model weights to provide an on-the-go uncertainty over\nthe model parameters at the client level. The parameters are then aggregated at\nthe server using the additional uncertainty information using a\nBayesian-inspired inverse-variance aggregation scheme. Furthermore, the\nproposed method quantifies prediction uncertainty by propagating the\nuncertainty from the model weights, providing confidence measures essential for\nclinical decision-making. In line with recent work shown, predictive\nuncertainty is utilized in the inference stage to improve predictive\nperformance. Experimental evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of this\napproach in improving both the quality of federated aggregation and\nuncertainty-weighted inference compared to previously established baselines.\nThe code for this work is made available at: https://github.com/asimukaye/fiva",

Extensive evaluations\non math reasoning (MATH, GSM8K), code generation (MBPP), and logical reasoning\n(LiveBench-Reasoning) demonstrate that SABER achieves high accuracy under tight\nbudgets, graceful degradation, and effective cross-scale and cross-domain\ngeneralization.

Then, an edge-guided tri-branch\ndecoder (Eg3Head) is constructed to preserve local edges and details for\nmultiscale context-awareness. Finally, an edge-guided feature fusion module\n(EgFFM) is to fuse contextual and detail information with edge information to\nrealize refined semantic segmentation. Extensive experiments show that TEFormer\nachieves mIoU of 88.57%, 81.46%, and 53.55% on the Potsdam, Vaihingen, and\nLoveDA datasets, respectively, shows the effectiveness in URSI semantic\nsegmentation.",

These schemes minimize\nboth the per-symbol and the overall access cost. The third construction, which\nbuilds on a prior scheme by Kong, achieves minimal access cost while supporting\narbitrary parameter regimes. All three constructions require field sizes that\nare linear in the final code length, and notably, the third construction\nachieves a field size that matches the lower bound implied by the MDS\nconjecture in almost all cases. In addition, we propose a construction that\noptimizes the \\emph{bandwidth cost}, defined as the total number of symbols\ntransmitted during conversion.

    "abstract": "Federated recommendation systems (FedRecs) have gained significant attention\nfor providing privacy-preserving recommendation services. However, existing\nFedRecs assume that all users have the same requirements for privacy\nprotection, i.e., they do not upload any data to the server. The approaches\noverlook the potential to enhance the recommendation service by utilizing\npublicly available user data. In real-world applications, users can choose to\nbe private or public. Private users' interaction data is not shared, while\npublic users' interaction data can be shared. Inspired by the issue, this paper\nproposes a novel Graph Federated Learning for Personalized Privacy\nRecommendation (GFed-PP) that adapts to different privacy requirements while\nimproving recommendation performance. GFed-PP incorporates the interaction data\nof public users to build a user-item interaction graph, which is then used to\nform a user relationship graph. A lightweight graph convolutional network (GCN)\nis employed to learn each user's user-specific personalized item embedding. To\nprotect user privacy, each client learns the user embedding and the scoring\nfunction locally. Additionally, GFed-PP achieves optimization of the federated\nrecommendation framework through the initialization of item embedding on\nclients and the aggregation of the user relationship graph on the server.\nExperimental results demonstrate that GFed-PP significantly outperforms\nexisting methods for five datasets, offering superior recommendation accuracy\nwithout compromising privacy.

To overcome this limitation,\nwe propose AnomalyMoE, a novel and universal anomaly detection framework based\non a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. Our key insight is to decompose the\ncomplex anomaly detection problem into three distinct semantic hierarchies:\nlocal structural anomalies, component-level semantic anomalies, and global\nlogical anomalies. AnomalyMoE correspondingly employs three dedicated expert\nnetworks at the patch, component, and global levels, and is specialized in\nreconstructing features and identifying deviations at its designated semantic\nlevel. This hierarchical design allows a single model to concurrently\nunderstand and detect a wide spectrum of anomalies. Furthermore, we introduce\nan Expert Information Repulsion (EIR) module to promote expert diversity and an\nExpert Selection Balancing (ESB) module to ensure the comprehensive utilization\nof all experts. Experiments on 8 challenging datasets spanning industrial\nimaging, 3D point clouds, medical imaging, video surveillance, and logical\nanomaly detection demonstrate that AnomalyMoE establishes new state-of-the-art\nperformance, significantly outperforming specialized methods in their\nrespective domains.",

However, the contract\nstate update process can have issues. In particular, inconsistent state update\nissues can arise for reasons such as unsynchronized modifications. Inconsistent\nstate update bugs have been exploited by attackers many times, but existing\ndetection tools still have difficulty in effectively identifying them. This\npaper conducts the first large-scale empirical study about inconsistent state\nupdate vulnerabilities (that is, inconsistent state update bugs that are\nexploitable) in smart contracts, aiming to shed light for developers,\nresearchers, tool builders, and language or library designers in order to avoid\ninconsistent state update vulnerabilities. We systematically investigate 116\ninconsistent state update vulnerabilities in 352 real-world smart contract\nprojects, summarizing their root causes, fix strategies, and exploitation\nmethods. Our study provides 11 original and important findings, and we also\ngive the implications of our findings.

    "abstract": "Pleural effusion semantic segmentation can significantly enhance the accuracy\nand timeliness of clinical diagnosis and treatment by precisely identifying\ndisease severity and lesion areas. Currently, semantic segmentation of pleural\neffusion CT images faces multiple challenges. These include similar gray levels\nbetween effusion and surrounding tissues, blurred edges, and variable\nmorphology. Existing methods often struggle with diverse image variations and\ncomplex edges, primarily because direct feature concatenation causes semantic\ngaps. To address these challenges, we propose the Dual-Branch Interactive\nFusion Attention model (DBIF-AUNet). This model constructs a densely nested\nskip-connection network and innovatively refines the Dual-Domain Feature\nDisentanglement module (DDFD). The DDFD module orthogonally decouples the\nfunctions of dual-domain modules to achieve multi-scale feature complementarity\nand enhance characteristics at different levels. Concurrently, we design a\nBranch Interaction Attention Fusion module (BIAF) that works synergistically\nwith the DDFD. This module dynamically weights and fuses global, local, and\nfrequency band features, thereby improving segmentation robustness.\nFurthermore, we implement a nested deep supervision mechanism with hierarchical\nadaptive hybrid loss to effectively address class imbalance. Through validation\non 1,622 pleural effusion CT images from Southwest Hospital, DBIF-AUNet\nachieved IoU and Dice scores of 80.1% and 89.0% respectively. These results\noutperform state-of-the-art medical image segmentation models U-Net++ and\nSwin-UNet by 5.7%/2.7% and 2.2%/1.5% respectively, demonstrating significant\noptimization in segmentation accuracy for complex pleural effusion CT images.",

    "abstract": "Although computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) and detection (CADe) systems have\nmade significant progress in various medical domains, their application is\nstill limited in specialized fields such as otorhinolaryngology. In the latter,\ncurrent assessment methods heavily depend on operator expertise, and the high\nheterogeneity of lesions complicates diagnosis, with biopsy persisting as the\ngold standard despite its substantial costs and risks. A critical bottleneck\nfor specialized endoscopic CADx/e systems is the lack of well-annotated\ndatasets with sufficient variability for real-world generalization. This study\nintroduces a novel approach that exploits a Latent Diffusion Model (LDM)\ncoupled with a ControlNet adapter to generate laryngeal endoscopic\nimage-annotation pairs, guided by clinical observations. The method addresses\ndata scarcity by conditioning the diffusion process to produce realistic,\nhigh-quality, and clinically relevant image features that capture diverse\nanatomical conditions. The proposed approach can be leveraged to expand\ntraining datasets for CADx/e models, empowering the assessment process in\nlaryngology. Indeed, during a downstream task of detection, the addition of\nonly 10% synthetic data improved the detection rate of laryngeal lesions by 9%\nwhen the model was internally tested and 22.1% on out-of-domain external data.\nAdditionally, the realism of the generated images was evaluated by asking 5\nexpert otorhinolaryngologists with varying expertise to rate their confidence\nin distinguishing synthetic from real images. This work has the potential to\naccelerate the development of automated tools for laryngeal disease diagnosis,\noffering a solution to data scarcity and demonstrating the applicability of\nsynthetic data in real-world scenarios.",

In this work, we investigate the task of injecting small,\nunstructured information into LLMs and its relation to the catastrophic\nforgetting phenomenon. We use a dataset of recent news -- ensuring no overlap\nwith the model's pre-training data -- to evaluate the knowledge acquisition by\nprobing the model with question-answer pairs related the learned information.\nStarting from a continued pre-training baseline, we explored different\naugmentation algorithms to generate synthetic data to improve the knowledge\nacquisition capabilities.

With the emergence of large language models\n(LLMs) in communicative contexts, this understanding needs to be further\nrefined and methodologically reconsidered. The first section challenges the\ntraditional semiotic trichotomy, arguing that connectionist LLM architectures\ndestabilize established hierarchies of meaning, and proposes the Human-Machine\nCommunication (HMC) framework as a more suitable alternative. The second\nsection examines the tension between human-centred pragmatic theories and the\nmachine-centred nature of LLMs. While traditional, Gricean-inspired pragmatics\ncontinue to dominate, it relies on human-specific assumptions ill-suited to\npredictive systems like LLMs. Probabilistic pragmatics, particularly the\nRational Speech Act framework, offers a more compatible teleology by focusing\non optimization rather than truth-evaluation. The third section addresses the\nissue of substitutionalism in three forms - generalizing, linguistic, and\ncommunicative - highlighting the anthropomorphic biases that distort LLM\nevaluation and obscure the role of human communicative subjects. Finally, the\npaper introduces the concept of context frustration to describe the paradox of\nincreased contextual input paired with a collapse in contextual understanding,\nemphasizing how users are compelled to co-construct pragmatic conditions both\nfor the model and themselves.

A key technique in merging methods is sparsification, which\nprunes redundant parameters from task vectors to mitigate interference.\nHowever, prevailing approaches employ a ``one-size-fits-all'' strategy,\napplying a uniform sparsity ratio that overlooks the inherent structural and\nstatistical heterogeneity of model parameters.

To address this limitation, we introduce \\textbf{TADrop}\n(\\textbf{T}ensor-wise \\textbf{A}daptive \\textbf{Drop}), an adaptive\nsparsification strategy that respects this heterogeneity. Instead of a global\nratio, TADrop assigns a tailored sparsity level to each parameter tensor based\non its distributional properties. The core intuition is that tensors with\ndenser, more redundant distributions can be pruned aggressively, while sparser,\nmore critical ones are preserved. As a simple and plug-and-play module, we\nvalidate TADrop by integrating it with foundational, classic, and SOTA merging\nmethods. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks (vision, language, and\nmultimodal) and models (ViT, BEiT) demonstrate that TADrop consistently and\nsignificantly boosts their performance. For instance, when enhancing a leading\nmerging method, it achieves an average performance gain of 2.0\\% across 8\nViT-B/32 tasks.

This paper investigates a critical question for compute-optimal\ndiffusion model deployment: Under a post-training setting without fine-tuning,\nis it more effective to reduce the number of denoising steps or to use a\ncheaper per-step inference? Intuitively, reducing the number of denoising steps\nincreases the variability of the distributions across steps, making the model\nmore sensitive to compression. In contrast, keeping more denoising steps makes\nthe differences smaller, preserving redundancy, and making post-training\ncompression more feasible. To systematically examine this, we propose PostDiff,\na training-free framework for accelerating pre-trained diffusion models by\nreducing redundancy at both the input level and module level in a post-training\nmanner. At the input level, we propose a mixed-resolution denoising scheme\nbased on the insight that reducing generation resolution in early denoising\nsteps can enhance low-frequency components and improve final generation\nfidelity. At the module level, we employ a hybrid module caching strategy to\nreuse computations across denoising steps. Extensive experiments and ablation\nstudies demonstrate that (1) PostDiff can significantly improve the\nfidelity-efficiency trade-off of state-of-the-art diffusion models, and (2) to\nboost efficiency while maintaining decent generation fidelity, reducing\nper-step inference cost is often more effective than reducing the number of\ndenoising steps.

Fitting the\nnonthermal fraction of the leptonic jet as a function of position, we also find\nthat most of the radio photons are emitted within 1000 Schwarzschild radii from\nthe BH. Although hadronic jets do not reproduce all the VLBI observations\nconsistently in our model, we also discuss that their heavy mass allows a\nstronger magnetic field within the observational constraints, leading to an\ninverted SED in sub-millimeter wavelengths by the thermal emission from the jet\nbase.

A fundamental kinetic\nasymmetry arises between lithium intercalation and deintercalation, driven by\nthe continuous and heterogeneous lithium transport and carbon layer sliding\nduring charge/discharge processes. The carbon defects regulate lithium\ntransport, in which the atomic-scale defects confine intralayer lithium\ntransport and carbon sliding while enabling interlayer transport via dynamic\nlithium trapping/release mechanisms. Accordingly, for the future design, it is\ncritical to construct structural units with controllable carbon layer\nsliding/reorganization, and tunable defects to enhance lithium-ion transport.",

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the issue of implicit stereotypes that may arise during\nthe generation process of large language models. It proposes an interpretable\nbias detection method aimed at identifying hidden social biases in model\noutputs, especially those semantic tendencies that are not easily captured\nthrough explicit linguistic features. The method combines nested semantic\nrepresentation with a contextual contrast mechanism. It extracts latent bias\nfeatures from the vector space structure of model outputs. Using attention\nweight perturbation, it analyzes the model's sensitivity to specific social\nattribute terms, thereby revealing the semantic pathways through which bias is\nformed. To validate the effectiveness of the method, this study uses the\nStereoSet dataset, which covers multiple stereotype dimensions including\ngender, profession, religion, and race. The evaluation focuses on several key\nmetrics, such as bias detection accuracy, semantic consistency, and contextual\nsensitivity. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves strong\ndetection performance across various dimensions. It can accurately identify\nbias differences between semantically similar texts while maintaining high\nsemantic alignment and output stability. The method also demonstrates high\ninterpretability in its structural design. It helps uncover the internal bias\nassociation mechanisms within language models. This provides a more transparent\nand reliable technical foundation for bias detection. The approach is suitable\nfor real-world applications where high trustworthiness of generated content is\nrequired.",

    "abstract": "Multimodal recommendation systems have attracted increasing attention for\ntheir improved performance by leveraging items' multimodal information. Prior\nmethods often build modality-specific item-item semantic graphs from raw\nmodality features and use them as supplementary structures alongside the\nuser-item interaction graph to enhance user preference learning. However, these\nsemantic graphs suffer from semantic deficiencies, including (1) insufficient\nmodeling of collaborative signals among items and (2) structural distortions\nintroduced by noise in raw modality features, ultimately compromising\nperformance. To address these issues, we first extract collaborative signals\nfrom the interaction graph and infuse them into each modality-specific item\nsemantic graph to enhance semantic modeling. Then, we design a modulus-based\npersonalized embedding perturbation mechanism that injects perturbations with\nmodulus-guided personalized intensity into embeddings to generate contrastive\nviews. This enables the model to learn noise-robust representations through\ncontrastive learning, thereby reducing the effect of structural noise in\nsemantic graphs. Besides, we propose a dual representation alignment mechanism\nthat first aligns multiple semantic representations via a designed Anchor-based\nInfoNCE loss using behavior representations as anchors, and then aligns\nbehavior representations with the fused semantics by standard InfoNCE, to\nensure representation consistency. Extensive experiments on four benchmark\ndatasets validate the effectiveness of our framework.",

These attacks easily bypass existing\ndefenses that rely on white-box access, posing a serious security challenge. To\naddress this, we propose SLIP, a Soft Label mechanism and key-extraction-guided\nCoT-based defense against Instruction backdoors in APIs. SLIP is designed based\non two key insights. First, to counteract the model's oversensitivity to\ntriggers, we propose a Key-extraction-guided Chain-of-Thought (KCoT). Instead\nof only considering the single trigger or the input sentence, KCoT prompts the\nagent to extract task-relevant key phrases. Second, to guide the LLM toward\ncorrect answers, our proposed Soft Label Mechanism (SLM) prompts the agent to\nquantify the semantic correlation between key phrases and candidate answers.\nCrucially, to mitigate the influence of residual triggers or misleading content\nin phrases extracted by KCoT, which typically causes anomalous scores, SLM\nexcludes anomalous scores deviating significantly from the mean and\nsubsequently averages the remaining scores to derive a more reliable semantic\nrepresentation. Extensive experiments on classification and question-answer\n(QA) tasks demonstrate that SLIP is highly effective, reducing the average\nattack success rate (ASR) from 90.2% to 25.13% while maintaining high accuracy\non clean data and outperforming state-of-the-art defenses.

    "abstract": "Vascular access, such as arteriovenous grafts, is crucial for patients\nundergoing haemodialysis as part of kidney replacement therapy. One of the\nprimary causes of arteriovenous graft failure and loss of patency is disordered\nblood flow, as the vein is exposed to the arterial environment with high flow\nrates and shear stress. We hypothesize that secondary flow downstream of the\nvein-graft anastomosis plays a critical role in generating low shear regions,\nthereby promoting neointima hyperplasia. The secondary flow highlighted here\nalso promotes high oscillatory shear index regions downstream of the vein-graft\nanastomosis, further contributing to graft failure. To prolong the overall\ngraft survival and patency, we aim to develop a strategy to optimise graft\nconfigurations with reduced levels of disturbed haemodynamics. We developed an\nimage-based approach to build three-dimensional geometries for subsequent\ncomputational fluid dynamics (CFD) numerical simulations. This simple, yet\naccurate, method allowed us to improve the accuracy of geometries, thus\nfacilitating comparisons between different vein-graft anastomotic angles.\n  Our results reveal that overall graft curvature (looped vs. straight) plays a\ndominant role in characterising the failure metrics. Looped grafts,\nparticularly at moderate vein-graft anastomotic angles (30{\\deg}-45{\\deg}),\nexhibited the most favourable metrics, including reduced values of low wall\nshear stress, high wall shear stress, and high oscillatory shear index. These\nfindings provide critical insights to inform medical professionals about graft\nareas that are subject to high shear stresses due to the oscillating nature of\nblood flow as well as the graft geometric configuration when performing\nsurgery.

Specifically, SDEval mainly\nadopts three dynamic strategies: text, image, and text-image dynamics to\ngenerate new samples from original benchmarks. We first explore the individual\neffects of text and image dynamics on model safety. Then, we find that\ninjecting text dynamics into images can further impact safety, and conversely,\ninjecting image dynamics into text also leads to safety risks. SDEval is\ngeneral enough to be applied to various existing safety and even capability\nbenchmarks. Experiments across safety benchmarks, MLLMGuard and VLSBench, and\ncapability benchmarks, MMBench and MMVet, show that SDEval significantly\ninfluences safety evaluation, mitigates data contamination, and exposes safety\nlimitations of MLLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/hq-King/SDEval",

By delicately considering the\ncharacteristics of the two signals, the sequential visual information is\nconsidered as a whole and transformed into a condition embedding, while the\ninertial measurement is concatenated with the noisy body pose frame by frame to\nconstruct a sequential input for the diffusion model. Firstly, we observe that\nthe visual information may be unavailable in some frames due to occlusions or\nsubjects moving out of the camera view. Thus incorporating the sequential\nvisual features as a whole to get a single feature embedding is robust to the\noccasional degenerations of visual information in those frames. On the other\nhand, the IMU measurements are robust to occlusions and always stable when\nsignal transmission has no problem.

    "abstract": "Knowledge Distillation (KD) is a fundamental technique for compressing large\nlanguage models (LLMs) into compact, efficient student models. However,\nexisting white-box KD methods mainly focus on balancing ground truth and\nstudent-generated responses while overlooking two critical factors: training\ndata quality and student-model compatibility. To address these limitations, we\npropose Selective Reflection Distillation (SRD), a novel data curation\nframework that leverages reflections from student models to systematically\nrefine training data. SRD dynamically evaluates and selects prompt-response\npairs by comparing ground truth data with student model outputs, selectively\ncurating high-quality, student-compatible training instances through automated\nranking based on difficulty. Furthermore, after selecting the training data, a\ncurriculum scheduling strategy is employed to incrementally introduce these\ncurated subsets into the distillation process at fixed intervals. As a\nplug-and-play enhancement, SRD consistently improves distillation outcomes\nacross diverse white-box KD approaches and model architectures, as well as\ndecreases computational cost significantly during KD training. Experiments on a\nrange of language model benchmarks demonstrate SRD's consistent improvements in\ndistilled model performance, as well as a reduction in training runtime by up\nto 39%, under diverse KD methods and model families. Notably, SRD operates as a\nplug-and-play module, enhancing sample efficiency without modifying underlying\nKD algorithms. Our findings highlight that data quality and compatibility are\npivotal to effective and efficient distillation of LLMs, and SRD provides a\nprincipled framework to achieve both.

    "abstract": "In clustering tasks, it is essential to structure the feature space into\nclear, well-separated distributions. However, because short text\nrepresentations have limited expressiveness, conventional methods struggle to\nidentify cluster centers that truly capture each category's underlying\nsemantics, causing the representations to be optimized in suboptimal\ndirections. To address this issue, we propose IOCC, a novel few-shot\ncontrastive learning method that achieves alignment between the cluster centers\nand the semantic centers. IOCC consists of two key modules:\nInteraction-enhanced Optimal Transport (IEOT) and Center-aware Contrastive\nLearning (CACL). Specifically, IEOT incorporates semantic interactions between\nindividual samples into the conventional optimal transport problem, and\ngenerate pseudo-labels. Based on these pseudo-labels, we aggregate\nhigh-confidence samples to construct pseudo-centers that approximate the\nsemantic centers. Next, CACL optimizes text representations toward their\ncorresponding pseudo-centers. As training progresses, the collaboration between\nthe two modules gradually reduces the gap between cluster centers and semantic\ncenters. Therefore, the model will learn a high-quality distribution, improving\nclustering performance. Extensive experiments on eight benchmark datasets show\nthat IOCC outperforms previous methods, achieving up to 7.34\\% improvement on\nchallenging Biomedical dataset and also excelling in clustering stability and\nefficiency.

Our method builds the graph by leveraging multiple\nbase machine-learning models: each edge weight reflects the difference in\nposterior probabilities between two cognitive states, yielding values in the\nrange [-1, 1] that encode confidence in a given state. We applied this approach\nto seven cognitive tasks from the Human Connectome Project (HCP 1200 Subject\nRelease), including working memory, gambling, motor activity, language, social\ncognition, relational processing, and emotion processing. Using only the mean\nincident edge weights of the graphs as features, a simple logistic-regression\nclassifier achieved average accuracies from 97.07% to 99.74%.

In all experiments, the highest\nclassification accuracy was obtained with ensemble graphs.

    "abstract": "Evaluating the capabilities and risks of foundation models is paramount, yet\ncurrent methods demand extensive domain expertise, hindering their scalability\nas these models rapidly evolve. We introduce SKATE: a novel evaluation\nframework in which large language models (LLMs) compete by generating and\nsolving verifiable tasks for one another. Our core insight is to treat\nevaluation as a game: models act as both task-setters and solvers, incentivized\nto create questions which highlight their own strengths while exposing others'\nweaknesses. SKATE offers several key advantages, balancing scalability,\nopen-endedness, and objectivity. It is fully automated, data-free, and\nscalable, requiring no human input or domain expertise. By using verifiable\ntasks rather than LLM judges, scoring is objective. Unlike domain-limited\nprogrammatically-generated benchmarks (e.g. chess-playing or spatial\nreasoning), having LLMs creatively pose challenges enables open-ended and\nscalable evaluation. As a proof of concept, we introduce LLM-set\ncode-output-prediction (COP) challenges as a verifiable and extensible\nframework in which to test our approach. Using a TrueSkill-based ranking\nsystem, we evaluate six frontier LLMs and find that: (1) weaker models can\nreliably differentiate and score stronger ones, (2) LLM-based systems are\ncapable of self-preferencing behavior, generating questions that align with\ntheir own capabilities, and (3) SKATE automatically surfaces fine-grained\ncapability differences between models. Our findings are an important step\ntowards general, scalable evaluation frameworks which can keep pace with LLM\nprogress.",

Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) addresses this by\nretrieving query-relevant contexts from knowledge bases to support LLM\nreasoning. Recent advances leverage pre-constructed graphs to capture the\nrelational connections among distributed documents, showing remarkable\nperformance in complex tasks. However, existing Graph-based RAG (GraphRAG)\nmethods rely on a costly process to transform the corpus into a graph,\nintroducing overwhelming token cost and update latency. Moreover, real-world\nqueries vary in type and complexity, requiring different logic structures for\naccurate reasoning. The pre-built graph may not align with these required\nstructures, resulting in ineffective knowledge retrieval.

LogicRAG begins by decomposing the input query\ninto a set of subproblems and constructing a directed acyclic graph (DAG) to\nmodel the logical dependencies among them. To support coherent multi-step\nreasoning, LogicRAG then linearizes the graph using topological sort, so that\nsubproblems can be addressed in a logically consistent order. Besides, LogicRAG\napplies graph pruning to reduce redundant retrieval and uses context pruning to\nfilter irrelevant context, significantly reducing the overall token cost.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that LogicRAG achieves both superior\nperformance and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art baselines.",

Most existing Image Manipulation Localization (IML) methods\nrely on discriminative learning and require large, high-quality annotated\ndatasets. However, current datasets lack sufficient scale and diversity,\nlimiting model performance in real-world scenarios. To overcome this, recent\nstudies have explored Constrained IML (CIML), which generates pixel-level\nannotations through algorithmic supervision. However, existing CIML approaches\noften depend on complex multi-stage pipelines, making the annotation process\ninefficient. In this work, we propose a novel generative framework based on\ndiffusion models, named UGD-IML, which for the first time unifies both IML and\nCIML tasks within a single framework. By learning the underlying data\ndistribution, generative diffusion models inherently reduce the reliance on\nlarge-scale labeled datasets, allowing our approach to perform effectively even\nunder limited data conditions. In addition, by leveraging a class embedding\nmechanism and a parameter-sharing design, our model seamlessly switches between\nIML and CIML modes without extra components or training overhead. Furthermore,\nthe end-to-end design enables our model to avoid cumbersome steps in the data\nannotation process. Extensive experimental results on multiple datasets\ndemonstrate that UGD-IML outperforms the SOTA methods by an average of 9.66 and\n4.36 in terms of F1 metrics for IML and CIML tasks, respectively.

To\nfurther stabilize training, we propose an instantaneous-to-mean curriculum with\nflow field mix-up, which encourages the model to first learn the foundational\ninstantaneous dynamics, and then gradually adapt to mean flows. This strategy\nproves critical for enhancing training efficiency and generation quality.\nExperimental results demonstrate that MeanAudio achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance in single-step audio generation. Specifically, it achieves a real\ntime factor (RTF) of 0.013 on a single NVIDIA RTX 3090, yielding a 100x speedup\nover SOTA diffusion-based TTA systems. Moreover, MeanAudio also demonstrates\nstrong performance in multi-step generation, enabling smooth and coherent\ntransitions across successive synthesis steps.",

Current mainstream VQA methods typically improve\nperformance by pretraining on large-scale classification datasets (e.g.,\nImageNet, Kinetics-400), followed by fine-tuning on VQA datasets. However, this\nstrategy presents two significant challenges: (1) merely transferring semantic\nknowledge learned from pretraining is insufficient for VQA, as video quality\ndepends on multiple factors (e.g., semantics, distortion, motion, aesthetics);\n(2) pretraining on large-scale datasets demands enormous computational\nresources, often dozens or even hundreds of times greater than training\ndirectly on VQA datasets. Recently, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown\nremarkable generalization capabilities across a wide range of visual tasks, and\nhave begun to demonstrate promising potential in quality assessment. In this\nwork, we propose Q-CLIP, the first fully VLMs-based framework for VQA. Q-CLIP\nenhances both visual and textual representations through a Shared Cross-Modal\nAdapter (SCMA), which contains only a minimal number of trainable parameters\nand is the only component that requires training. This design significantly\nreduces computational cost. In addition, we introduce a set of five learnable\nquality-level prompts to guide the VLMs in perceiving subtle quality\nvariations, thereby further enhancing the model's sensitivity to video quality.\nFurthermore, we investigate the impact of different frame sampling strategies\non VQA performance, and find that frame-difference-based sampling leads to\nbetter generalization performance across datasets. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that Q-CLIP exhibits excellent performance on several VQA datasets.",

    "abstract": "Low-velocity large-scale shocks impacting on the ISM may efficiently shape\nmolecular clouds and trigger star formation within them. These shocks, both\ndriven by galactic bubbles and/or cloud-cloud collisions, leave specific\nsignatures in the gas morphology and kinematics. Observational studies of such\nsignatures are crucial to investigate if and how shocks affect the clouds\nformation process and trigger their future star formation. We have analysed the\nshocked and dense gas tracers SiO(2-1) and H13CO+(1-0) emission toward the IRDC\nG035.39-00.33, using new, larger-scale maps obtained with the 30m telescope at\nthe Instituto de Radioastronom\\`ia Millim\\'etrica. We find that the dense gas\nis organised into a northern and a southern filament having different\nvelocities and tilted orientation with respect to each other. The two filaments\nare spatially separated yet connected by a faint bridge feature also seen in a\nposition-velocity diagram extracted across the cloud. This bridge-feature,\ntypical of cloud-cloud collisions, also coincides with a very spectrally narrow\nSiO-traced emission. The northern filament is suggested to be interacting with\nthe nearby supernova remnant G035.6-0.4. Toward the southern filament, we also\nreport the presence of a parsec-scale, spectrally narrow SiO emission likely\ndriven by the interaction between this filament and a nearby expanding shell.\nThe shell is visible in the 1.3 GHz and 610 MHz continuum images and our\npreliminary analysis suggests it may be the relic of a supernova remnant. We\nconclude that the two filaments represent the densest part of two colliding\nclouds, pushed toward each other by nearby Supernova Remnants. We speculate\nthat this cloud-cloud collision driven by stellar feedback may have assembled\nthe infrared dark cloud. We also evaluate the possibility that star formation\nmay have been triggered within G035.39-00.33 by the collision.",

However, instruction-based editing,\nparticularly for video, has been constrained by limited training data,\nhindering its practical application. To this end, we introduce DreamVE, a\nunified model for instruction-based image and video editing. Specifically, We\npropose a two-stage training strategy: first image editing, then video editing.\nThis offers two main benefits: (1) Image data scales more easily, and models\nare more efficient to train, providing useful priors for faster and better\nvideo editing training. (2) Unifying image and video generation is natural and\naligns with current trends. Moreover, we present comprehensive training data\nsynthesis pipelines, including collage-based and generative model-based data\nsynthesis. The collage-based data synthesis combines foreground objects and\nbackgrounds to generate diverse editing data, such as object manipulation,\nbackground changes, and text modifications. It can easily generate billions of\naccurate, consistent, realistic, and diverse editing pairs. We pretrain DreamVE\non extensive collage-based data to achieve strong performance in key editing\ntypes and enhance generalization and transfer capabilities. However,\ncollage-based data lacks some attribute editing cases, leading to a relative\ndrop in performance. In contrast, the generative model-based pipeline, despite\nbeing hard to scale up, offers flexibility in handling attribute editing cases.\nTherefore, we use generative model-based data to further fine-tune DreamVE.\nBesides, we design an efficient and powerful editing framework for DreamVE. We\nbuild on the SOTA T2V model and use a token concatenation with early drop\napproach to inject source image guidance, ensuring strong consistency and\neditability.

The EVN observations\ndetected radio continuum emission from both the northwest (NW) and southeast\n(SE) nuclei. The NW nucleus shows two components with high brightness\ntemperatures and radio luminosities, likely indicating the presence of an AGN\ncore and jet. Meanwhile, our EVN observation failed to detect the OH line\nemission, possibly due to radio frequency interference and/or the emission\nbeing partly resolved out and below our detection limit. The multi-band radio\nspectral energy distribution (SED) deviates from a single power-law at low\nfrequencies, suggesting low-frequency absorption. The GMRT spectral line data\nreveal both \\HI absorption and emission. The \\HI emission is diffuse and shows\na velocity gradient from about 7500 \\kms in the NW to 7800 \\kms in the SE\nnucleus. On larger scales, the \\HI emission extends about 4' along the NW-SE\ndirection, with the southeastern extension matching the optical tidal tail.

This equilibrium is a fixed point\nwhere the market-clearing price dictates the hash rate through a free-entry\nmining model, which in turn endogenously sets the network's security. The\nsecurity, defined as one minus the probability of a 51% attack, is determined\nvia a global games model of attacker coordination, providing a unique and\ncontinuous security function.

This\nleads to a simplified model architecture with improved training stability,\ncomputational efficiency, and extrapolation capability. Furthermore, FTI-PBSM\nis trained on sparse sensor measurements from multiple PDE cases generated by\nvarying PDE coefficients, with the sensor data serving as model input. This\nenables the model to learn a parametric PDE family and generalize to unseen\nphysical cases, accurately reconstructing full-field transient solutions in\nreal time. The proposed model is validated on four representative PDE\nproblems-the convection equation, diffusion-reaction dynamics, Korteweg-de\nVries (KdV) equation, and Allen-Cahn equation-and demonstrates superior\nprediction accuracy and generalization performance compared to a causal PBSM,\nwhich is used as the baseline model, in both interpolation and extrapolation\ntasks. It also shows strong robustness to sensor noise and variations in\ntraining data size, while significantly reducing training time.",

    "abstract": "Internet live streaming is widely used in online entertainment and\ne-commerce, where live advertising is an important marketing tool for anchors.\nAn advertising campaign hopes to maximize the effect (such as conversions)\nunder constraints (such as budget and cost-per-click). The mainstream control\nof campaigns is auto-bidding, where the performance depends on the decision of\nthe bidding algorithm in each request. The most widely used auto-bidding\nalgorithms include Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) control, linear\nprogramming (LP), reinforcement learning (RL), etc. Existing methods either do\nnot consider the entire time traffic, or have too high computational\ncomplexity. In this paper, the live advertising has high requirements for\nreal-time bidding (second-level control) and faces the difficulty of unknown\nfuture traffic. Therefore, we propose a lightweight bidding algorithm Binary\nConstrained Bidding (BiCB), which neatly combines the optimal bidding formula\ngiven by mathematical analysis and the statistical method of future traffic\nestimation, and obtains good approximation to the optimal result through a low\ncomplexity solution. In addition, we complement the form of upper and lower\nbound constraints for traditional auto-bidding modeling and give theoretical\nanalysis of BiCB. Sufficient offline and online experiments prove BiCB's good\nperformance and low engineering cost.",

    "abstract": "Finding an optimal decision tree that minimizes classification error is known\nto be NP-hard. While exact algorithms based on MILP, CP, SAT, or dynamic\nprogramming guarantee optimality, they often suffer from poor anytime behavior\n-- meaning they struggle to find high-quality decision trees quickly when the\nsearch is stopped before completion -- due to unbalanced search space\nexploration. To address this, several anytime extensions of exact methods have\nbeen proposed, such as LDS-DL8.5, Top-k-DL8.5, and Blossom, but they have not\nbeen systematically compared, making it difficult to assess their relative\neffectiveness. In this paper, we propose CA-DL8.5, a generic, complete, and\nanytime beam search algorithm that extends the DL8.5 framework and unifies some\nexisting anytime strategies. In particular, CA-DL8.5 generalizes previous\napproaches LDS-DL8.5 and Top-k-DL8.5, by allowing the integration of various\nheuristics and relaxation mechanisms through a modular design. The algorithm\nreuses DL8.5's efficient branch-and-bound pruning and trie-based caching,\ncombined with a restart-based beam search that gradually relaxes pruning\ncriteria to improve solution quality over time. Our contributions are twofold:\n(1) We introduce this new generic framework for exact and anytime decision tree\nlearning, enabling the incorporation of diverse heuristics and search\nstrategies; (2) We conduct a rigorous empirical comparison of several\ninstantiations of CA-DL8.5 -- based on Purity, Gain, Discrepancy, and Top-k\nheuristics -- using an anytime evaluation metric called the primal gap\nintegral. Experimental results on standard classification benchmarks show that\nCA-DL8.5 using LDS (limited discrepancy) consistently provides the best anytime\nperformance, outperforming both other CA-DL8.5 variants and the Blossom\nalgorithm while maintaining completeness and optimality guarantees.",

Although both are\nclass-agnostic segmentation tasks that map from RGB space to binary space, the\nformer aims to identify the most salient objects in the image, while the latter\nfocuses on detecting perfectly camouflaged objects that blend into the\nbackground in the image. These two tasks exhibit strong contradictory\nattributes. Previous works have mostly believed that joint learning of these\ntwo tasks would confuse the network, reducing its performance on both tasks.\nHowever, here we present an opposite perspective: with the correct approach to\nlearning, the network can simultaneously possess the capability to find both\nsalient and camouflaged objects, allowing both tasks to benefit from joint\nlearning. We propose SCJoint, a joint learning scheme for SOD and COD tasks,\nassuming that the decoding processes of SOD and COD have different distribution\ncharacteristics. The key to our method is to learn the respective means and\nvariances of the decoding processes for both tasks by inserting a minimal\namount of task-specific learnable parameters within a fully shared network\nstructure, thereby decoupling the contradictory attributes of the two tasks at\na minimal cost. Furthermore, we propose a saliency-based sampling strategy\n(SBSS) to sample the training set of the SOD task to balance the training set\nsizes of the two tasks. In addition, SBSS improves the training set quality and\nshortens the training time. Based on the proposed SCJoint and SBSS, we train a\npowerful generalist network, named JoNet, which has the ability to\nsimultaneously capture both ``salient\" and ``camouflaged\".

While significant\nadvancements have been made in improving retrieval accuracy and response\nquality, a critical challenge remains that the internal knowledge integration\nand retrieval-generation interactions in RAG workflows are largely opaque. This\npaper introduces RAGTrace, an interactive evaluation system designed to analyze\nretrieval and generation dynamics in RAG-based workflows. Informed by a\ncomprehensive literature review and expert interviews, the system supports a\nmulti-level analysis approach, ranging from high-level performance evaluation\nto fine-grained examination of retrieval relevance, generation fidelity, and\ncross-component interactions. Unlike conventional evaluation practices that\nfocus on isolated retrieval or generation quality assessments, RAGTrace enables\nan integrated exploration of retrieval-generation relationships, allowing users\nto trace knowledge sources and identify potential failure cases. The system's\nworkflow allows users to build, evaluate, and iterate on retrieval processes\ntailored to their specific domains of interest. The effectiveness of the system\nis demonstrated through case studies and expert evaluations on real-world RAG\napplications.",

We present ReNiL, a Bayesian deep-learning framework for accurate,\nefficient, and uncertainty-aware pedestrian localization. ReNiL introduces\nInertial Positioning Demand Points (IPDPs) to estimate motion at contextually\nmeaningful waypoints instead of dense tracking, and supports inference on IMU\nsequences at any scale so cadence can match application needs.

By modeling displacements with a Laplace distribution, ReNiL\nprovides homogeneous Euclidean uncertainty that integrates cleanly with other\nsensors. A Bayesian inference chain links successive IPDPs into consistent\ntrajectories.

To address these challenges, we propose\n\\textbf{VQAThinker}, a reasoning-based VQA framework that leverages large\nmultimodal models (LMMs) with reinforcement learning to jointly model video\nquality understanding and scoring, emulating human perceptual decision-making.\nSpecifically, we adopt group relative policy optimization (GRPO), a rule-guided\nreinforcement learning algorithm that enables reasoning over video quality\nunder score-level supervision, and introduce three VQA-specific rewards: (1) a\n\\textbf{bell-shaped regression reward} that increases rapidly as the prediction\nerror decreases and becomes progressively less sensitive near the ground truth;\n(2) a \\textbf{pairwise ranking reward} that guides the model to correctly\ndetermine the relative quality between video pairs; and (3) a \\textbf{temporal\nconsistency reward} that encourages the model to prefer temporally coherent\nvideos over their perturbed counterparts. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat VQAThinker achieves state-of-the-art performance on both in-domain and OOD\nVQA benchmarks, showing strong generalization for video quality scoring.\nFurthermore, evaluations on video quality understanding tasks validate its\nsuperiority in distortion attribution and quality description compared to\nexisting explainable VQA models and LMMs. These findings demonstrate that\nreinforcement learning offers an effective pathway toward building\ngeneralizable and explainable VQA models solely with score-level supervision.",

    "abstract": "This work introduces an adaptive mesh refinement technique for hierarchical\nhybrid grids with the goal to reach scalability and maintain excellent\nperformance on massively parallel computer systems. On the block structured\nhierarchical hybrid grids, this is accomplished by using classical,\nunstructured refinement only on the coarsest level of the hierarchy, while\nkeeping the number of structured refinement levels constant on the whole\ndomain. This leads to a compromise where the excellent performance\ncharacteristics of hierarchical hybrid grids can be maintained at the price\nthat the flexibility of generating locally refined meshes is constrained.\nFurthermore, mesh adaptivity often relies on a posteriori error estimators or\nerror indicators that tend to become computationally expensive. Again with the\ngoal of preserving scalability and performance, a method is proposed that\nleverages the grid hierarchy and the full multigrid scheme that generates a\nnatural sequence of approximations on the nested hierarchy of grids. This\npermits to compute a cheap error estimator that is well-suited for large-scale\nparallel computing. We present the theoretical foundations for both global and\nlocal error estimates and present a rigorous analysis of their effectivity.

    "abstract": "How can we effectively handle queries for on-device large language models\n(LLMs) with varying runtime constraints, such as latency and accuracy?\nMulti-scale quantization addresses this challenge by enabling memory-efficient\nruntime model adaptation of LLMs through the overlaying of multiple model\nvariants quantized to different bitwidths. Meanwhile, an important question\nstill remains open-ended: how can models be properly configured to match a\ntarget precision or latency? While mixed-precision offers a promising solution,\nwe take this further by leveraging the key observation that the sensitivity of\neach layer dynamically changes across decoding iterations. Building on this\ninsight, we introduce DP-LLM, a novel mechanism that dynamically assigns\nprecision to each layer based on input values. DP-LLM augments each linear\nlayer in an LLM with a precision selector that determines the bitwidth at\nruntime using a lightweight error estimator and threshold values learned\nthrough fine-tuning. Experimental results across multiple models and benchmarks\ndemonstrate that DP-LLM achieves a superior performance-latency trade-off,\noutperforming prior approaches.",

While\nprevious efforts mitigate this by selecting only important visual features or\nleveraging learnable queries to reduce token count, they often compromise\nperformance or introduce substantial extra costs. In response, we propose\nFourier-VLM, a simple yet efficient method that compresses visual\nrepresentations in the frequency domain. Our approach is motivated by the\nobservation that vision features output from the vision encoder exhibit\nconcentrated energy in low-frequency components. Leveraging this, we apply a\nlow-pass filter to the vision features using a two-dimensional Discrete Cosine\nTransform (DCT). Notably, the DCT is efficiently computed via the Fast Fourier\nTransform (FFT) operator with a time complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(n\\log n)$,\nminimizing the extra computational cost while introducing no additional\nparameters. Extensive experiments across various image-based benchmarks\ndemonstrate that Fourier-VLM achieves competitive performance with strong\ngeneralizability across both LLaVA and Qwen-VL architectures.

To overcome these obstacles,\ninnovative approaches are required. Agile chip design has already benefited\nfrom machine learning integration at various stages, including logic synthesis,\nplacement, and routing. With Large Language Models (LLMs) recently\ndemonstrating impressive proficiency in Hardware Description Language (HDL)\ngeneration, it is promising to extend their abilities to 2.5D integration, an\nadvanced technique that saves area overhead and development costs. However,\nLLM-driven chiplet design faces challenges such as flatten design, high\nvalidation cost and imprecise parameter optimization, which limit its chiplet\ndesign capability. To address this, we propose MAHL, a hierarchical LLM-based\nchiplet design generation framework that features six agents which\ncollaboratively enable AI algorithm-hardware mapping, including hierarchical\ndescription generation, retrieval-augmented code generation, diverseflow-based\nvalidation, and multi-granularity design space exploration. These components\ntogether enhance the efficient generation of chiplet design with optimized\nPower, Performance and Area (PPA).

In this work, we first identify two main challenges in\nmodeling heterophily HGs: (1) varying heterophily distributions across hops and\nmeta-paths; (2) the intricate and often heterophily-driven diversity of\nsemantic information across different meta-paths. Then, we propose the Adaptive\nHeterogeneous Graph Neural Network (AHGNN) to tackle these challenges.

It then integrates messages\nfrom diverse semantic spaces using a coarse-to-fine attention mechanism, which\nfilters out noise and emphasizes informative signals.

To address this, we\npropose Spectrum, a unified network for part-level pixel parsing (body parts\nand clothing) and instance-level grouping. While diffusion-based\nopen-vocabulary models generalize well across tasks, their internal\nrepresentations are not specialized for detailed human parsing.

Collaborative\nblock mining can further boost mining efficiency by allowing multiple miners to\nform coalitions, pooling their computing resources and transaction data\ntogether to mine new blocks collaboratively. Therefore, an MEC-assisted\ncollaborative blockchain network can leverage the strengths of both\ntechnologies, offering improved efficiency, security, and scalability for\nblockchain systems.

Comprehensive evaluation on $3$ Wikipedia-derived\ndatasets, $4$ LLMs, and $7$ embedding models shows that embeddings can predict\nLLM knowledge on a held-out set with up to 90 % accuracy.

AllBRICQS searches for quasars that are brighter\nthan $B_P = 16.5$ or $R_P = 16$ mag in Gaia DR3, based on simple selection\ncriteria. Here, we report 62 new AllBRICQS quasars spanning various types,\nwhich include typical broad emission line quasars and the most luminous iron\nlow-ionization broad absorption line quasars discovered to date. Spectroscopic\nobservations were conducted using the Long-Slit Spectrograph on the 1.8-meter\ntelescope at Bohyunsan Optical Astronomy Observatory, YFOSC on the 2.4-meter\ntelescope at Lijiang Observatory, and BFOSC on the 2.16-meter telescope at\nXinglong Observatory. We applied flux calibration using ZTF broadband\nphotometry to correct for attenuation due to intermittent thin clouds during\nthe observations. Redshifts were determined using inverse-variance weighted\ncross-correlation methods.

In this paper, we propose EC2MoE, an adaptive framework for\nscalable MoE inference via end-cloud pipeline collaboration. First, we design a\nhardware-aware lightweight group gate network that enhances expert selection\nand computational efficiency. By incorporating a hardware-aware local expert\nselection mechanism, the system adaptively filters candidate experts based on\nreal-time device profiles. A lightweight group gate module then integrates\nlocal and global gating outputs to achieve high-quality expert routing with\nminimal overhead. Second, we develop a pipeline optimization mechanism based on\nendcloud collaboration to accelerate MoE inference. This includes an\nencoder-decoder structure based on low-rank compression, which reduces\ntransmission and computation costs. And a route-aware heuristic pipeline\nscheduling algorithm that dynamically allocates inference stages across devices\naccording to workload and network topology. Extensive experiments show that\nEC2MoE can increase throughput by 2.2x to 5.1x and reduce end-to-end latency by\n53% to 67% while maintaining high accuracy compared to state-of-the-art\nmethods.

    "abstract": "Prognostication for comatose post-cardiac arrest patients is a critical\nchallenge that directly impacts clinical decision-making in the ICU. Clinical\ninformation that informs prognostication is collected serially over time.\nShortly after cardiac arrest, various time-invariant baseline features are\ncollected (e.g., demographics, cardiac arrest characteristics). After ICU\nadmission, additional features are gathered, including time-varying hemodynamic\ndata (e.g., blood pressure, doses of vasopressor medications). We view these as\ntwo phases in which we collect new features. In this study, we propose a novel\nstepwise dynamic competing risks model that improves the prediction of\nneurological outcomes by automatically determining when to take advantage of\ntime-invariant features (first phase) and time-varying features (second phase).\nNotably, our model finds patients for whom this second phase (time-varying\nhemodynamic) information is beneficial for prognostication and also when this\ninformation is beneficial (as we collect more hemodynamic data for a patient\nover time, how important these data are for prognostication varies). Our\napproach extends the standard Fine and Gray model to explicitly model the two\nphases and to incorporate neural networks to flexibly capture complex nonlinear\nfeature relationships. Evaluated on a retrospective cohort of 2,278 comatose\npost-arrest patients, our model demonstrates robust discriminative performance\nfor the competing outcomes of awakening, withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy,\nand death despite maximal support. Our approach generalizes to more than two\nphases in which new features are collected and could be used in other dynamic\nprediction tasks, where it may be helpful to know when and for whom newly\ncollected features significantly improve prediction.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have gained significant\nattention for node classification tasks on graph-structured data. However,\ntraditional GNNs primarily focus on adjacency relationships between nodes,\noften overlooking the rich role-based characteristics that are crucial for\nlearning more expressive node representations. Existing methods for capturing\nrole-based features are largely unsupervised and fail to achieve optimal\nperformance in downstream tasks. To address these limitations, we propose a\nnovel hypergraph neural network with state space model (HGMN) that effectively\nintegrates role-aware representations into GNNs and the state space model. HGMN\nutilizes hypergraph construction techniques to model higher-order relationships\nand combines role-based and adjacency-based representations through a learnable\nmamba transformer mechanism. By leveraging two distinct hypergraph construction\nmethods-based on node degree and neighborhood levels, it strengthens the\nconnections among nodes with similar roles, enhancing the model's\nrepresentational power. Additionally, the inclusion of hypergraph convolution\nlayers enables the model to capture complex dependencies within hypergraph\nstructures. To mitigate the over-smoothing problem inherent in deep GNNs, we\nincorporate a residual network, ensuring improved stability and better feature\npropagation across layers. Extensive experiments conducted on one newly\nintroduced dataset and four benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of\nHGMN. The model achieves significant performance improvements on node\nclassification tasks compared to state-of-the-art GNN methods. These results\nhighlight HGMN's ability to provide enriched node representations by\neffectively embedding role-based features alongside adjacency information,\nmaking it a versatile and powerful tool for a variety of graph-based learning\napplications.",

Pattern II shows a\nshear-constraint cooperative non-uniform pattern at higher Reynolds numbers and\nD/W ratios, where flow dynamics and spatial confinement couple, leading to\nfaster solidification at the tail region and an asymmetric solidification\nfront. Through comprehensive analysis of the numerical results, we derived the\ncharacteristic behavior of the Stefan number (Ste), Reynolds number (Re), and\nD/W ratios on the freezing time.

The results demonstrates that increasing Stefan number and Reynolds\nnumber shortens the freezing time, whereas increasing droplet D/W ratio extends\nit.

    "abstract": "The Barzilai and Borwein (BB) gradient method is one of the most widely-used\nline-search gradient methods. It computes the step-size for the current iterate\nby using the information carried in the previous iteration. Recently, William\nKahan [Kahan, Automatic Step-Size Control for Minimization Iterations,\nTechnical report, University of California, Berkeley CA, USA, 2019] proposed\nnew Gradient Descent (KGD) step-size strategies which iterate the step-size\nitself by effectively utilizing the information in the previous iteration. In\nthe quadratic model, such a new step-size is shown to be mathematically\nequivalent to the long BB step, but no rigorous mathematical proof of its\nefficiency and effectiveness for the general unconstrained minimization is\navailable. In this paper, by this equivalence with the long BB step, we first\nderive a short version of KGD step-size and show that, for the strongly convex\nquadratic model with a Hessian matrix $H$, both the long and short KGD\nstep-size (and hence BB step-sizes) gradient methods converge at least\nR-linearly with a rate $1-\\frac{1}{{\\rm cond}(H)}$. For the general\nunconstrained minimization, we further propose an adaptive framework to\neffectively use the KGD step-sizes; global convergence and local R-linear\nconvergence rate are proved. Numerical experiments are conducted on the CUTEst\ncollection as well as the practical logistic regression problems, and we\ncompare the performance of the proposed methods with various BB step-size\napproaches and other recently proposed adaptive gradient methods to demonstrate\nthe efficiency and robustness.",

KnapFormer builds on the insight that strong\nsynergy exists between sequence parallelism and the need to address the\nsignificant token imbalance across ranks. This imbalance arises from\nvariable-length text inputs and varying visual token counts in mixed-resolution\nand image-video joint training. KnapFormer redistributes tokens by first\ngathering sequence length metadata across all ranks in a balancing group and\nsolving a global knapsack problem. The solver aims to minimize the variances of\ntotal workload per-GPU, while accounting for the effect of sequence\nparallelism. By integrating DeepSpeed-Ulysees-based sequence parallelism in the\nload-balancing decision process and utilizing a simple semi-empirical workload\nmodel, KnapFormers achieves minimal communication overhead and less than 1%\nworkload discrepancy in real-world training workloads with sequence length\nvarying from a few hundred to tens of thousands.

As a\nresult, effectively capturing users' latest preferences is challenging, as\ninteractions reflecting recent interests are limited and new items often lack\nsufficient feedback. A common solution is to enrich item representations using\nmultimodal encoders (e.g., BERT or ViT) to extract visual and textual features.\nHowever, these encoders are pretrained on general-purpose tasks: they are not\ntailored to user preference modeling, and they overlook the fact that user\ntastes toward modality-specific features such as visual styles and textual\ntones can also drift over time. This presents two key challenges in streaming\nscenarios: the high cost of fine-tuning large multimodal encoders, and the risk\nof forgetting long-term user preferences due to continuous model updates.\n  To tackle these challenges, we propose Expandable Side Mixture-of-Experts\n(XSMoE), a memory-efficient framework for multimodal streaming recommendation.\nXSMoE attaches lightweight side-tuning modules consisting of expandable expert\nnetworks to frozen pretrained encoders and incrementally expands them in\nresponse to evolving user feedback. A gating router dynamically combines expert\nand backbone outputs, while a utilization-based pruning strategy maintains\nmodel compactness.

Depth completion models, trained on some ``source'' data, often predict\nerroneous outputs when transferred to ``target'' data captured in novel\nenvironmental conditions due to a covariate shift. The crux of our method lies\nin quantifying the likelihood of depth predictions belonging to the source data\ndistribution. The challenge is in the lack of access to out-of-distribution\n(target) data prior to deployment. Hence, rather than making assumptions\nregarding the target distribution, we utilize adversarial perturbations as a\nmechanism to explore the data space. This enables us to train an energy model\nthat scores local regions of depth predictions as in- or out-of-distribution.\nWe update the parameters of pretrained depth completion models at test time to\nminimize energy, effectively aligning test-time predictions to those of the\nsource distribution. We call our method ``Energy-based Test-time Adaptation'',\nor ETA for short.

    "abstract": "Time series forecasting plays a vital role in supporting decision-making\nacross a wide range of critical applications, including energy, healthcare, and\nfinance. Despite recent advances, forecasting accuracy remains limited due to\nthe challenge of integrating historical numerical sequences with contextual\nfeatures, which often comprise unstructured textual data. To address this\nchallenge, we propose TokenCast, an LLM-driven framework that leverages\nlanguage-based symbolic representations as a unified intermediary for\ncontext-aware time series forecasting. Specifically, TokenCast employs a\ndiscrete tokenizer to transform continuous numerical sequences into temporal\ntokens, enabling structural alignment with language-based inputs. To bridge the\nsemantic gap between modalities, both temporal and contextual tokens are\nembedded into a shared representation space via a pre-trained large language\nmodel (LLM), further optimized with autoregressive generative objectives.\nBuilding upon this unified semantic space, the aligned LLM is subsequently\nfine-tuned in a supervised manner to predict future temporal tokens, which are\nthen decoded back into the original numerical space. Extensive experiments on\ndiverse real-world datasets enriched with contextual features demonstrate the\neffectiveness and generalizability of TokenCast.",

    "abstract": "Recently, Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated remarkable\ncapabilities in code reasoning by scaling up the length of Chain-of-Thought\n(CoT). However, excessively long reasoning traces introduce substantial\nchallenges in terms of training cost, inference latency, and deployment\nfeasibility. While various CoT compression approaches have emerged to address\nthis challenge, they face inherent trade-offs: token-level methods often\ndisrupt syntactic and logical coherence, while step-level methods based on\nperplexity fail to reliably capture the logically critical reasoning steps. In\nthis paper, we propose ASAP (Anchor-guided, Surprisal-based Pruning), a novel\ncoarse-to-fine framework for CoT compression. ASAP first performs anchor-guided\npruning to preserve the core reasoning structure, which efficiently reduces the\nsearch space for subsequent processing. It then enables a logic-aware pruning\nby selecting logically essential reasoning steps based on a novel first-token\nsurprisal metric. Finally, ASAP teaches models to autonomously generate and\nleverage these concise CoTs at inference time, enabling efficient reasoning in\ncoding tasks. Experiments show that ASAP achieves state-of-the-art accuracy\nacross multiple code generation benchmarks while substantially reducing\ntraining and inference costs. On the challenging LiveCodeBench v4_v5 benchmark,\nour approach reduces token generation by 23.5% and inference latency by 43.5%\ncompared to the strongest baseline, while achieving a competitive accuracy of\n36.19% in Pass@1.

To address this limitation, we propose an Adversarial\nTOpic-aware Prompt-tuning (ATOP), a novel method that jointly learns\ntopic-shared and topic-specific features to improve cross-topic AES.

To enhance the robustness of topic-shared prompt\nlearning and mitigate feature scale sensitivity introduced by topic alignment,\nwe incorporate adversarial training within a unified regression and\nclassification framework. In addition, we employ a neighbor-based classifier to\nmodel the local structure of essay representations and generate pseudo-labels\nfor target-topic essays.

A\nlarge dataset of 200000 simulated spectra containing nine radionuclides with an\nexperimental natural background is used for each scenario with multiple\nradionuclides present in the spectrum. Regarding identification performance,\nthe statistical approach consistently outperforms the machine learning\napproaches across all three scenarios for all comparison metrics.

A series of defense strategies have been proposed for\nthe alignment, fine-tuning, and post-fine-tuning phases, where most\npost-fine-tuning defenses rely on coarse-grained safety layer mapping. These\nmethods lack a comprehensive consideration of both safety layers and\nfine-grained neurons, limiting their ability to efficiently balance safety and\nutility. To address this, we propose the Fine-Grained Safety Neurons (FGSN)\nwith Training-Free Continual Projection method to reduce the fine-tuning safety\nrisks.

Previous studies\nsuggest a wide range of carbon species abundances (CO\\textsubscript{2}, CO, and\nCH\\textsubscript{4}) can result from variations in reducing fluxes and stellar\nspectral types which influence photochemistry. However, a systematic\ninvestigation of how varying carbon species, particularly CO, affect planetary\nclimates across wide parameter spaces remains limited. Here, we employ a\none-dimensional radiative-convective equilibrium model to examine the\ndependence of planetary climate on the abundances of carbon species and host\nstar type. We find that CO, due to weak absorption of stellar radiation,\ninduces only moderate changes in stratospheric temperature, while its effect on\nsurface temperature is negligible. Under Earth-like $p_\\mathrm{N_2}$ (where\n$p_\\mathrm{i}$ is the partial pressure on the surface of species i), for cases\nwith fixed $p_\\mathrm{CO_2}$, increase in CO leads to surface cooling on\nplanets orbiting Sun-like stars unless the sum of $p_\\mathrm{CO_2}$ and\n$p_\\mathrm{CH_4}$ exceeds $\\sim$1 bar. Whereas it results in surface warming\nfor planets around M-type stars. When the total pressure of carbon species is\nfixed, converting CO\\textsubscript{2} or CH\\textsubscript{4} into CO always\ninduces cooling. These effects arise from a combination of CO Rayleigh\nscattering, pressure broadening of greenhouse gas absorption lines, and\n\\textcolor{red}{varying water vapor levels}. We further discuss how CO- and\nCH\\textsubscript{4}-driven cooling (warming) can trigger positive (negative)\nclimate-photochemistry feedback, influencing atmospheric evolution.\nAdditionally, we suggest CO-rich planets may be less susceptible to water loss\nand atmospheric oxidation due to lower stratospheric water vapor content.",

Low-confidence detections\nof dimethyl sulfide (DMS) and/or dimethyl disulfide (DMDS) have sparked\nconsiderable debate, primarily around arguments that their absorption features\nare not uniquely identifiable. Here, we consider all five questions from the\nastrobiology standards of evidence framework, starting with: Have we detected\nan authentic signal? To answer this, we analyzed publicly-available JWST\nobservations of K2-18b using independent data reduction and spectral retrieval\nmethodologies. Our comprehensive set of reductions demonstrates that the MIRI\ntransit spectrum is highly susceptible to unresolved instrumental systematics.\nApplying different wavelength binning schemes yields a potpourri of planet\nspectra that then lead to a wide assortment of atmospheric interpretations.\nConsequently, we offer recommendations to help minimize this\npreviously-underappreciated instrument systematic in future MIRI reductions of\nany exoplanet. While the MIRI binning scheme adopted by Madhusudhan et al.\n(2025) favors the presence of DMS/DMDS in K2-18b, we find that 87.5% of\nretrievals using our preferred MIRI binning scheme do not. When considering the\nfull, 0.7 - 12 micron transit spectrum, we confirm the detection of CH4 and\nfavor CO2, and find the presence of DMS and C2H4 to be interchangeable.\nMoreover, we find that the tentative presence of large features in the MIRI\ntransit spectrum is in tension with the more robust, yet smaller, features\nobserved in the near IR. We conclude that red noise -- rather than an\nastrophysical signal -- plagues the mid-IR data and there is, as yet, no\nstatistically significant evidence for biosignatures in the atmosphere of\nK2-18b.",

    "abstract": "Decision trees, without appropriate constraints, can easily become overly\ncomplex and prone to overfit, capturing noise rather than generalizable\npatterns. To resolve this problem,pruning operation is a crucial part in\noptimizing decision trees, as it not only reduces the complexity of trees but\nalso decreases the probability of generating overfit models. The conventional\npruning techniques like Cost-Complexity Pruning (CCP) and Reduced Error Pruning\n(REP) are mostly based on greedy approaches that focus on immediate gains in\nperformance while pruning nodes of the decision tree. However, this might\nresult in a lower generalization in the long run, compromising the robust\nability of the tree model when introduced to unseen data samples, particularly\nwhen trained with small and complex datasets. To address this challenge, we are\nproposing a Multi-Armed Bandits (MAB)-based pruning approach, a reinforcement\nlearning (RL)-based technique, that will dynamically prune the tree to generate\nan optimal decision tree with better generalization. Our proposed approach\nassumes the pruning process as an exploration-exploitation problem, where we\nare utilizing the MAB algorithms to find optimal branch nodes to prune based on\nfeedback from each pruning actions. Experimental evaluation on several\nbenchmark datasets, demonstrated that our proposed approach results in better\npredictive performance compared to the traditional ones.

Recent diffusion-based methods have\ndemonstrated significant potential in 2D-to-3D implicit mapping, they rely on\ndata-driven statistical priors and miss the explicit modeling of light-surface\ninteraction, leading to multi-view normal direction conflicts. Moreover, the\ndiscrete sampling mechanism of diffusion models causes gradient discontinuity\nin differentiable rendering reconstruction modules, preventing 3D geometric\nerrors from being backpropagated to the normal generation network, thereby\nforcing existing methods to depend on dense normal annotations. This paper\nproposes SINGAD, a novel Self-supervised framework from a single Image for\nNormal estimation via 3D GAussian splatting guided Diffusion. By integrating\nphysics-driven light-interaction modeling and a differentiable rendering-based\nreprojection strategy, our framework directly converts 3D geometric errors into\nnormal optimization signals, solving the challenges of multi-view geometric\ninconsistency and data dependency. Specifically, the framework constructs a\nlight-interaction-driven 3DGS reparameterization model to generate multi-scale\ngeometric features consistent with light transport principles, ensuring\nmulti-view normal consistency. A cross-domain feature fusion module is designed\nwithin a conditional diffusion model, embedding geometric priors to constrain\nnormal generation while maintaining accurate geometric error propagation.\nFurthermore, a differentiable 3D reprojection loss strategy is introduced for\nself-supervised optimization that minimizes geometric error between the\nreconstructed and input image, eliminating dependence on annotated normal\ndatasets.

    "abstract": "By assuming the inverse square law of solar wind plasma density as\nrepresentative of other stars, it is shown that just outside a star the {\\it\noutward} deflection of a passing radio signal at $\\nu\\approx 1$~GHz (which is\ncapable of penetrating the plasma) is about 5 times larger than the\ngravitational inward deflection by the star, and the ensuing lens equation\nwhich takes both effects into account is a cubic polynomial with three roots\nand a new strong lensing caustic. The geometric optics approach is valid for a\nradio source size $\\lesssim 1$~pc. Microlensing magnification of a steady\nbackground source occurs typically over a timescale of milliseconds, resulting\nin $\\approx 80$ Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) per day over the whole sky, which can\nonly perturb the isotropy of FRB distribution at the several \\% level.\nMoreover, repeating FRBs could be triggered by the periodic interception of the\nline-of-sight of the background source by members of a binary system. The\ntemporal signatures of such FRBs are consistent with the power spectrum of\nsolar wind density fluctuations on corresponding scales, except the mean\ndensity of the wind is a few times higher than the solar value.",

The STAR collaboration has\nreported that the atomic mass number ($A$) scaling of light nuclei elliptic\nflow $v_2$ is broken at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 3.0-3.9$ GeV. The observations reveals\nthat, while protons maintain negative $v_2$ values at mid-rapidity at both 3.0\nand 3.2 GeV, light nuclei $v_2$ exhibit a sign change from negative at 3.0 GeV\nto positive at 3.2 GeV.

Deuterons are formed\nvia nucleon coalescence, with the spatial distance ${\\Delta R}$ and momentum\ndifference ${\\Delta P}$ between constituent protons and neutrons serving as the\ncoalescence criteria. Our calculations successfully reproduce the sign change\nin deuteron $v_2$ at 3.2 GeV. We observe a strong dependence of nucleon\ncoalescence probability on the azimuthal angle relative to the reaction plane.\nThis effect is primarily driven by the transverse momentum dependence of the\nmean spatial $\\langle {\\Delta R} \\rangle$ and momentum $\\langle {\\Delta P}\n\\rangle$ separations between nucleon pairs, which vary with the nucleon\nazimuthal angle. Moreover, our analysis demonstrates that the stiffness of the\nnuclear equation of state plays a crucial role in determining the energy\ndependence of this sign change in deuteron $v_2$ at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=3.2$ GeV.",

However, these approaches are often labor-intensive, rely on\nstrong task assumptions, or compromise the quality of imitation. We introduce\nLatent Policy Barrier, a framework for robust visuomotor policy learning.\nInspired by Control Barrier Functions, LPB treats the latent embeddings of\nexpert demonstrations as an implicit barrier separating safe, in-distribution\nstates from unsafe, out-of-distribution (OOD) ones. Our approach decouples the\nrole of precise expert imitation and OOD recovery into two separate modules: a\nbase diffusion policy solely on expert data, and a dynamics model trained on\nboth expert and suboptimal policy rollout data. At inference time, the dynamics\nmodel predicts future latent states and optimizes them to stay within the\nexpert distribution.

This wide variability in thermorepsonsive property is found to be\nclosely linked to the the extent of hydrongen bond formation in the system,\nwhich appears to have a significant correlation with the monomer sequence of\nthe copolymer. These findings offer new directions in the design of\nstructurally diverse thermoresponsive copolymers.",

    "abstract": "Ganymede and the Galilean moons formed in a small gas disc around the\ngas-accreting proto-Jupiter, known as the circum-Jovian disc (CJD). The\nformation process of the satellites occurs in three steps: the formation of the\nCJD from the accreting gas onto Jupiter, the transport of solid materials from\nthe circumstellar disc (CSD) to the CJD, and the formation of the satellites\ninside the CJD from the supplied materials. Recent 3D hydrodynamical\nsimulations have revealed the basic structure of the CJD. However, the detailed\nstructures, which influence the transport of materials and the formation of\nsatellites, remain controversial. Specifically, for the transport of solid\nmaterials, pebbles (~cm-m) drifting from the outer region of the CSD are\ntrapped at the gas gap created by Jupiter and cannot be directly supplied to\nthe CJD. There are two alternative mechanisms for supplying solid material:\nsmall dust particles accrete onto the CJD together with the gas, or\nplanetesimals, which are less affected by the gas, are captured by the CJD. The\nsatellite formation scenarios are also divided into two groups: satellitesimal\nand pebble accretion. In both scenarios, the growth timescale of the satellites\n(~0.1-10 Myr) depends on the continuous supply of material to the CJD. How to\nstop the migration of forming satellites is also an important issue. The\ncombination of inward migration and its cessation is consistent with the\nresonant orbits of the three innermost Galilean moons. The compositional\ngradient and the degree of differentiation of the moons further constrain the\nproposed formation scenarios. However, none of the proposed scenarios has been\nfully accepted, and future observations, such as those from the JUICE mission,\nwill provide stricter constraints to define the true origin of Ganymede and the\nGalilean moons.",

We then analyze histograms of line mass, polarization\nintensity (PI), polarization fraction (PF), and the relative orientation\nbetween B-fields and filaments.\n  As HFS evolve, we observe changes in the filament line-mass function (FLMF),\nPF, and B-field-filament alignment - especially within the hub, which also\nincreases in size. Massive bipolar outflows and radiation bubbles reshape the\nplane-of-sky B-fields, aligning them with cavity walls and shells, consistent\nwith known rearrangements near HII regions. We also find a notable similarity\nbetween hub sizes and young cluster radii. \"Double-node\" star formation - where\ntwo subregions within a hub show different evolutionary stages - emerges as a\ncommon HFS feature.

    ],
    "abstract": "The decomposition of a stochastic time series into three component series\nrepresenting a dual signal - namely, the mean and dispersion - while isolating\nnoise is presented. The decomposition is performed by applying machine learning\ntechniques to fit the dual signal. Machine learning minimizes the loss function\nwhich compromises between fitting the original time series and penalizing\nirregularities of the dual signal. The latter includes terms based on the first\nand second order derivatives along time. To preserve special patterns,\nweighting of the regularization components of the loss function has been\nintroduced based on Statistical Process Control methodology. The proposed\ndecomposition can be applied as a smoothing algorithm against the mean and\ndispersion of the time series. By isolating noise, the proposed decomposition\ncan be seen as a denoising algorithm. Two approaches of the learning process\nhave been considered: sequential and jointly. The former approach learns the\nmean signal first and then dispersion. The latter approach fits the dual signal\njointly. Jointly learning can uncover complex relationships for the time series\nwith heteroskedasticity. Learning has been set by solving the direct non-linear\nunconstrained optimization problem or by applying neural networks that have\nsequential or twin output architectures. Tuning of the loss function\nhyperparameters focuses on the isolated noise to be a stationary stochastic\nprocess without autocorrelation properties. Depending on the applications, the\nhyperparameters of the learning can be tuned towards either the discrete states\nby stepped signal or smoothed series. The decomposed dual signal can be\nrepresented on the 2D space and used to learn inherent structures, to forecast\nboth mean and dispersion, or to analyze cross effects in case of multiple time\nseries.",

This study\ninvestigates the link between ethical AI and user satisfaction by analyzing\nover 100,000 user reviews of AI products from G2. Using transformer-based\nlanguage models, we measure sentiment across seven ethical dimensions defined\nby the EU Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI. Our findings show that all\nseven dimensions are positively associated with user satisfaction. Yet, this\nrelationship varies systematically across user and product types. Technical\nusers and reviewers of AI development platforms more frequently discuss\nsystem-level concerns (e.g., transparency, data governance), while\nnon-technical users and reviewers of end-user applications emphasize\nhuman-centric dimensions (e.g., human agency, societal well-being). Moreover,\nthe association between ethical AI and user satisfaction is significantly\nstronger for non-technical users and end-user applications across all\ndimensions.

This, combined with on-board integrated\nchips for image and signal processing, makes the cell phone a versatile\npocket-sized computational imaging platform. Parallel to this, we have seen in\nrecent years how neural fields - small neural networks trained to map\ncontinuous spatial input coordinates to output signals - enable the\nreconstruction of complex scenes without explicit data representations such as\npixel arrays or point clouds. In this thesis, I demonstrate how carefully\ndesigned neural field models can compactly represent complex geometry and\nlighting effects. Enabling applications such as depth estimation, layer\nseparation, and image stitching directly from collected in-the-wild mobile\nphotography data. These methods outperform state-of-the-art approaches without\nrelying on complex pre-processing steps, labeled ground truth data, or machine\nlearning priors. Instead, they leverage well-constructed, self-regularized\nmodels that tackle challenging inverse problems through stochastic gradient\ndescent, fitting directly to raw measurements from a smartphone.",

    "abstract": "Diamond optomechanical crystal (OMC) devices with embedded color center spins\nare promising platforms for a broad range of applications in quantum sensing,\nnetworking, and computing applications, offering an interface between a\nGHz-frequency mechanical mode and both optical photons and coherent spins. A\ncrucial but elusive step towards realizing this platform is to engineer a\ndevice with a high-quality factor mechanical mode while preserving the\nbulk-like coherence of embedded spins. Here we demonstrate sideband-resolved\ndiamond OMCs with mechanical quality factors in excess of $10^6$ at cryogenic\ntemperatures, and find coherence times up to $T_2$ = 270 $\\mu$s for embedded\nnitrogen vacancy (NV) centers. Furthermore, we measure these devices across\nfive orders of magnitude in intracavity optical power, demonstrating robust\npower handling and a high optomechanical cooperativity ($C\\gg1$) at cryogenic\ntemperatures that is essential for a broad range of quantum protocols requiring\nstrong, coherent interactions between photons and phonons. These results are\nenabled by a robust, high-throughput method for forming single-crystal diamond\nmembranes in combination with chemical vapor deposition (CVD) diamond\novergrowth with nitrogen $\\delta$-doping. We discuss the prospects of this\nplatform for hybrid spin-mechanical devices in the quantum regime.",

    "abstract": "Quantization is usually regarded as a means to trade quality of performance\nfor reduced compute requirements, i.e., as a suboptimal approximation. However,\nif examined in terms of a fixed overall resource budget, a very different\nperspective arises. We introduce Signed-Zero Ternary (SZT), a 2-bit\nquantization that deterministically provides gradient information with no\nforward-path penalty. Our analysis provides evidence that it may improve\ninformation density compared to non-quantized alternatives.",
