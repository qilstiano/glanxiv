    "abstract": "In few-shot learning (FSL), the labeled samples are scarce. Thus, label\nerrors can significantly reduce classification accuracy. Since label errors are\ninevitable in realistic learning tasks, improving the robustness of the model\nin the presence of label errors is critical. This paper proposes a new robust\nneural field-based image approach (RoNFA) for few-shot image classification\nwith noisy labels. RoNFA consists of two neural fields for feature and category\nrepresentation. They correspond to the feature space and category set. Each\nneuron in the field for category representation (FCR) has a receptive field\n(RF) on the field for feature representation (FFR) centered at the\nrepresentative neuron for its category generated by soft clustering. In the\nprediction stage, the range of these receptive fields adapts according to the\nneuronal activation in FCR to ensure prediction accuracy. These learning\nstrategies provide the proposed model with excellent few-shot learning\ncapability and strong robustness against label noises. The experimental results\non real-world FSL datasets with three different types of label noise\ndemonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art\nFSL methods. Its accuracy obtained in the presence of noisy labels even\nsurpasses the results obtained by state-of-the-art FSL methods trained on clean\nsupport sets, indicating its strong robustness against noisy labels.",

While now well-characterized in the context\nof qubit readout, it remains unclear how general this limitation is across the\nmore general setting of parametric control. Here, we demonstrate that a\nnonlinear coupler, exemplified by a transmon, undergoes ionization under strong\nparametric driving, leading to a breakdown of coherent control and thereby\nlimiting the accessible gate speeds.

Our results reveal that the Floquet spectrum provides a\nunifying framework for understanding strong-drive limitations across a wide\nrange of operations on superconducting quantum circuits.

To address that, we take a\ncontrol theoretic perspective in designing the feedback controller with\nprovable guarantees. We present a systematic way to construct Control Lyapunov\nFunctions (CLF) to stabilize the microgrid, and, independently, Control Barrier\nFunctions (CBF) to enforce its safe operation at all times.

We show that\nall permutationally-invariant unitaries on an arbitrary number of qubits can be\nrealized using this permutationally-invariant Hamiltonian, which couples the\nqubits to an oscillator initialized in its vacuum state, together with global\nuniform x and z fields on all qubits.

As a corollary,\nwe find that all permutationally invariant states -- including useful entangled\nstates such as GHZ and Dicke states -- can be prepared using this interaction\nand global fields. We also characterize unitaries that can be realized on the\njoint Hilbert space of the qubits and oscillator with the TC interaction and\nglobal z field, and develop new methods for preparing the state of the\noscillator in an arbitrary initial state.

Using\nrendered synthetic images from UE can provide developers and businesses with a\nmethod of accessing nearly unlimited, reproducible, agile, and cheap training\nsets for their customers and applications without the threat of poisoned images\nfrom the internet or the cost of collecting them. The validity of these\ngenerated images are examined by testing the change in model test accuracy in\ntwo different sized CV models across two binary classification cases (Cat vs\nDog and Weld Defect Detection). In addition, this paper provides an\nimplementation of how to measure the quality of synthetic images by using\npre-trained CV models as auditors. Results imply that for large (VGG16) and\nsmall (MobileNetV3-small) parameter deep CV models, adding >60% additional\nsynthetic images to a real image dataset during model training can narrow the\ntest-training accuracy gap to ~1-2% without a conclusive effect on test\naccuracy compared to using real world images alone. Likewise, adding <10%\nadditional real training images to synthetic only training sets decreased the\nclassification error rate in half, then decreasing further when adding more\nreal training images. For these cases tested, using synthetic images from\nrendering engines allow researchers to only use 10% of their real images during\ntraining, compared to the traditional 50-70%. This research serves as an\nexample of how to create synthetic images, guidelines on how to use the images,\npotential restrictions and possible performance improvements for data-scarce\nprojects.",

While unitary dynamics preserve\nglobal purity, expectation values of observables often exhibit\nequilibration-like behavior, raising the question of whether complexity can\ntrack this process. In addition to examining observable equilibration, we\nextend our analysis to study how the complexity of the quantum states evolves,\nproviding insight into the transition from initial coherence to equilibrium. We\ndefine a classical statistical complexity measure based on observable entropy\nand deviation from equilibrium, which captures the dynamical progression\ntowards equilibration and effectively distinguishes between complex and\nnon-complex trajectories. In particular, our measure is sensitive to\nnon-complex dynamics, such as the quasi-periodic behavior exhibited by low\neffective dimension initial states, where the systems explore a limited region\nof the Hilbert space as they oscillate in an informational coherence-preserving\nmanner. These findings are supported by numerical simulations of an Ising-like\nnon-integrable Hamiltonian spin-chain model. Our work provides new insight into\nthe emergence of equilibrium behavior from unitary dynamics and advances\ncomplexity as a meaningful tool in the study of the emergence of classicality\nin microscopic systems.",

While regulating the\nvelocity, the controller also prevents the collision of the ego vehicle with\nthe lead vehicle within the range specified by the controller's design\nparameter. The controller design is based on a configurable quadratic curve on\nrelative distance-relative velocity phase-space that allows the transition of\nthe regulated velocity from (i) no modification of input, (ii) decelerating to\nmatch the leader's velocity (iii) braking to avoid any imminent collision.

Modern systems can surface thousands of\nstatistical relationships-correlations, trends, causal links-but offer little\nguidance on which ones are novel, non-trivial, or worthy of expert attention.\nIn this work, we study the complementary problem to hypothesis generation:\nautomatic hypothesis assessment. Specifically, we ask: given a large set of\nstatistical relationships, can we automatically assess which ones are novel and\nworth further exploration? We focus on correlations as they are a common entry\npoint in exploratory data analysis that often serve as the basis for forming\ndeeper scientific or causal hypotheses.\n  To support automatic assessment, we propose to leverage the vast knowledge\nencoded in LLMs' weights to derive a prior distribution over the correlation\nvalue of a variable pair. If an LLM's prior expects the correlation value\nobserved, then such correlation is not surprising, and vice versa. We propose\nthe Logit-based Calibrated Prior, an LLM-elicited correlation prior that\ntransforms the model's raw output logits into a calibrated, continuous\npredictive distribution over correlation values. We evaluate the prior on a\nbenchmark of 2,096 real-world variable pairs and it achieves a sign accuracy of\n78.8%, a mean absolute error of 0.26, and 95% credible interval coverage of\n89.2% in predicting Pearson correlation coefficient.

Together with any universal set of unitary\ngates, the ability to apply such a gate lets one efficiently emulate\npostselection.

Second, we establish upper bounds which show that\nconversely, any non-Hermitian evolution can be written as a unitary on a\nsystem-meter pair followed by postselecting the meter. This ``purification'' is\ncompact -- it introduces only $O(\\delta^{2})$ Trotter error per time step\n$\\delta$ -- so any NH model whose purification lies in a strongly simulable\nunitary family (e.g., Clifford, matchgate, or low-bond-dimension tensor-network\ncircuits) remains efficiently simulable.

    "abstract": "Vision foundation models (VFMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance\nacross a wide range of downstream tasks. While several VFM adapters have shown\npromising results by leveraging the prior knowledge of VFMs, we identify two\ninefficiencies in these approaches. First, the interaction between\nconvolutional neural network (CNN) and VFM backbone triggers early layer\ngradient backpropagation. Second, existing methods require tuning all\ncomponents, adding complexity. Besides, these adapters alter VFM features,\nunderutilizing the prior knowledge. To tackle these challenges, we propose a\nnew approach called ViT-Split, based on a key observation: the layers of\nseveral VFMs, like DINOv2, can be divided into two distinct components: an\nextractor for learning low-level features and an adapter for learning\ntask-specific features. Leveraging this insight, we eliminate the CNN branch\nand introduce two heads, task head and prior head, to the frozen VFM. The task\nhead is designed to learn task-specific features, mitigating the early gradient\npropagation issue. The prior head is used to leverage the multi-scale prior\nfeatures from the frozen VFM, reducing tuning parameters and overfitting.\nExtensive experiments on various tasks (e.g., segmentation, detection, depth\nestimation, and visual question answering) validate the effectiveness and\nefficiency of ViT-Split. Specifically, ViT-Split reduces training time up to\n$4\\times$ while achieving comparable or even better results on ADE20K, compared\nto other VFM adapters.",

While ultrafast laser-based techniques have enabled\nprobing nanoscale dynamics at their intrinsic temporal scales down to femto-\nand attoseconds, the long wavelengths of optical lasers have prevented the\ninterrogation and manipulation of such dynamics with nanoscale spatial\nspecificity. With advances in hard X-ray free electron lasers (FELs),\nsignificant progress has been made developing X-ray transient grating (XTG)\nspectroscopy, aiming at the coherent control of elementary excitations with\nnanoscale X-ray standing waves. So far, XTGs have been probed only at optical\nwavelengths, thus intrinsically limiting the achievable periodicities to\nseveral hundreds of nm. By achieving sub-femtosecond synchronization of two\nhard X-ray pulses at a controlled crossing angle, we demonstrate the generation\nof an XTG with spatial periods of 10 nm. The XTG excitation drives a thermal\ngrating that drives coherent monochromatic longitudinal acoustic phonons in the\ncubic perovskite, SrTiO3 (STO). With a third X-ray pulse with the same photon\nenergy, time-and-momentum resolved measurement of the XTG-induced scattering\nintensity modulation provides evidence of ballistic thermal transport at\nnanometer scale in STO. These results highlight the great potential of XTG for\nstudying high-wave-vector excitations and nanoscale transport in condensed\nmatter, and establish XTG as a powerful platform for the coherent control and\nstudy of nanoscale dynamics.",

Despite its success, ICL suffers from several\nlimitations, including sensitivity to demonstration order, context length\nconstraints, and computational inefficiency. To address these challenges, task\nvector-based approaches compress task information into a single vector.\nHowever, these methods typically construct task vectors from fixed sets of\ndemonstrations and reuse them across input queries, without conditioning on the\nspecific input. This limitation can lead models to struggle with effective\nadaptation when the input query is not well aligned with the underlying\ndemonstrations, consequently degrading their generalization performance on\nunseen tasks. To overcome this limitation, we propose Adaptive Task Vectors\n(ATV), a simple and effective framework that dynamically generates task vectors\nconditioned on each input query. ATV employs a small language model to generate\ntask vectors, which are then transformed to match the target LLM's architecture\nand applied to guide its output generation. In contrast to ICL and previous\nvector-based approaches, which rely on fixed demonstration sets and their\ncorresponding vectors, ATV dynamically generates task vectors tailored to each\nspecific input query and task. Consequently, ATV demonstrates strong\nperformance and generalization capabilities, even for unseen tasks.\nFurthermore, we provide a theoretical analysis indicating that ATV is\nexpressively equivalent to LoRA under equal rank budgets and more expressive\nthan Prefix-Tuning, thereby offering formal support for its representational\nadvantage.",

    "abstract": "Sparsely coupled Kuramoto oscillators offer a fertile playground for\nexploring high-dimensional basins of attraction due to their simple yet\nmultistable dynamics. For $n$ identical Kuramoto oscillators on cycle graphs,\nit is well known that the only attractors are twisted states, whose phases wind\naround the circle with a constant gap between neighboring oscillators\n($\\theta_j = 2\\pi q j/n$). It was conjectured in 2006 that basin sizes of these\ntwisted states scale as $e^{-kq^2}$ to the winding number $q$. Here, we provide\nnew numerical and analytical evidence supporting the conjecture and uncover the\ndynamical mechanism behind the Gaussian scaling. The key idea is that, when\nstarting with a random initial condition, the winding number of the solution\nstabilizes rapidly at $t \\propto \\log n$, before long-range correlation can\ndevelop among oscillators. This timescale separation allows us to model the\nwinding number as a sum of weakly dependent variables, leading to a Central\nLimit Theorem derivation of the basin scaling.",

Realizing these\nfunctionalities, however, requires a deeper understanding of their magnetic\nbehavior, which is governed by a subtle interplay between localized and\nitinerant magnetism. This interplay is particularly complex in spin gapped\nmetallic half-Heusler compounds, whose magnetic properties remain largely\nunexplored despite previous studies of their electronic structure. In this\nwork, we systematically investigate the magnetic behavior of spin gapped\nmetallic half-Heusler compounds XYZ (X = Fe, Co, Ni, Rh, Ir, Pd, Pt; Y = Ti, V,\nZr, Hf, Nb, Ta; Z = In, Sn, Sb), revealing clear trends. Co- and Ni-based\ncompounds predominantly exhibit itinerant magnetism, whereas Ti-, V-, and\nFe-based systems may host localized moments, itinerant moments, or a\ncoexistence of both. To uncover the origin of magnetism, we apply the Stoner\nmodel, with the Stoner parameter I estimated from Coulomb interaction\nparameters (Hubbard U and Hund's exchange J) computed using the constrained\nrandom phase approximation (cRPA). Our analysis shows that compounds not\nsatisfying the Stoner criterion tend to remain non-magnetic. On the contrary\ncompounds, which satisfy the Stoner criterion, generally exhibit magnetic\nordering highlighting the crucial role of electronic correlations and band\nstructure effects in the emergence of magnetism. For compounds with magnetic\nground states, we compute Heisenberg exchange parameters, estimate Curie\ntemperatures (T_C), and analyze spin-wave properties, including magnon\ndispersions and stiffness constants.",

In\nparticular, ball-milled Al/Zr composites exhibit lower ignition thresholds than\npure aluminum, driven by exothermic intermetallic formation reactions and have\ndemonstrated enhanced combustion properties. However, the extent to which this\nheat release governs ignition and combustion remains unclear, especially when\nprogressively removed through annealing. To systematically investigate this\neffect, we synthesized Al/Zr powders (3Al:Zr, Al:Zr, and Al:3Zr at%) via ball\nmilling, annealed them in argon up to 1000 C to partially complete the\nformation reactions, and characterized their ignition and combustion behavior.\nIgnition thresholds were measured using a hot wire method across different\nenvironments, while high-speed hyperspectral imaging tracked single-particle\nburn durations and temperatures. A convolutional neural network (CNN)-based\nmethod was developed to quantify the frequency of microexplosions. Results show\nthat annealing - and thus reducing available reaction heat - increases ignition\nthresholds, most significantly for Al-rich compositions. In contrast, Zr-rich\npowders exhibit little change in ignition thresholds due to oxidation aiding\nignition. Despite removing the available heat that drives ignition, average\ncombustion temperatures range from 2400-3000 K and increased with annealing for\nAl- and Zr-rich powders. Average maximum temperatures are 100 to 400 K higher.\nThe frequency of microexplosions remains high (>46%) and increases with\nannealing for all but the Al-rich powders. These findings suggest that while\nhomogeneous Al/Zr powders (e.g., atomized) may exhibit higher ignition\nthresholds, they can achieve comparable combustion performance once ignited.",

Applications include species distribution modelling and\nmineral prospectivity analysis. We clarify the interpretation of the ROC curve\nin this context. Contrary to statements in the literature, ROC does not measure\ngoodness-of-fit of a spatial model, and its interpretation as a measure of\npredictive ability is weak; it is a measure of ranking ability, insensitive to\nthe precise form of the model. To gain insight we draw connections between ROC\nand existing statistical techniques for spatial point pattern data. The area\nunder the ROC curve (AUC) is related to hypothesis tests of the null hypothesis\nthat the explanatory variables have no effect. The shape of the ROC curve has a\ndiagnostic interpretation. This suggests several new techniques, which extend\nthe scope of application of ROC curves for spatial data, to support variable\nselection and model selection, analysis of segregation between different types\nof points, adjustment for a baseline, and analysis of spatial case-control\ndata. The new techniques are illustrated with several real example datasets.\nOpen source R code implementing the techniques is available in the development\nversion of our package spatstat [Baddeley and Turner, 2005, Baddeley et al.,\n2015] and will be included in the next public release.",

When the resource concentration is a known function of\ntime, we can describe the growth and survival of individuals quasi-explicitly,\ni.e., in terms of solutions of ordinary differential equations (ODE).\nReproduction is captured by a (non-autonomous) renewal equation, which can be\nsolved by generation expansion. After these preparatory steps, a contraction\nmapping argument is needed to construct the solution of the coupled\nconsumer-resource system with prescribed initial conditions. As we shall show,\nthis interpretation-guided constructive approach does in fact yield weak\nsolutions of a familiar partial differential equation (PDE). A striking\ndifficulty with the PDE approach is that the solution operators are, in\ngeneral, not differentiable, precluding a linearized stability analysis of\nsteady states. This is a manifestation of the state-dependent delay difficulty.\nAs a (not entirely satisfactory and rather technical) way out, we present a\ndelay equation description in terms of the history of both the $p$-level birth\nrate of the consumer population and the resource concentration. We end by using\npseudospectral approximation to derive a system of ODE and demonstrating its\nuse in a numerical bifurcation analysis.

Late gas\nproduced by the sublimation of CO (or CO$_2$) ices after the dissipation of the\nprimordial gas could be the norm in young planetesimal belts. Hence, a gas-rich\nKuiper belt could have been present in the Solar System. The high C/H ratios\nobserved on Uranus and Neptune could be a clue to the existence of such late\ngas that could have been accreted onto young icy giants. The aim of this paper\nis to estimate the carbon enrichment of the atmospheres of Uranus and Neptune\ncaused by the accretion of the gas released from a putative gas-rich Kuiper\nbelt. We find that assuming a primordial Kuiper belt with a mass of tens of\nearth masses leads to significant CO gas accretion onto the giants, which can\nlead to high C/H ratios, especially for Uranus and Neptune. Our model shows\nthat a relatively massive gas-rich Kuiper belt could have existed in the Solar\nSystem's youth, significantly enriching the atmospheres of Uranus and Neptune\nwith carbon. Late gas accretion and its effect on outer giant planets\nmetallicities could be a universal scenario, also occurring in extrasolar\nsystems.

The Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope\n(hereafter, Roman), scheduled for launch in late 2026, will play a\ntransformative role in strong lensing science with its planned wide-field\nsurveys. With its remarkable 0.281 square degree field of view and\ndiffraction-limited angular resolution of ~0.1 arcsec, Roman is uniquely suited\nto characterizing dark matter substructure from a robust population of strong\nlenses. We present a yield simulation of detectable strong lenses in Roman's\nplanned High Latitude Wide Area Survey (HLWAS). We simulate a population of\ngalaxy-galaxy strong lenses across cosmic time with Cold Dark Matter subhalo\npopulations, select those detectable in the HLWAS, and generate simulated\nimages accounting for realistic Wide Field Instrument detector effects. For a\nfiducial case of single 146-second exposures, we predict around 160,000\ndetectable strong lenses in the HLWAS, of which about 500 will have sufficient\nsignal-to-noise to be amenable to detailed substructure characterization. We\ninvestigate the effect of the variation of the point-spread function across\nRoman's field of view on detecting individual subhalos and the suppression of\nthe subhalo mass function at low masses. Our simulation products are available\nto support strong lens science with Roman, such as training neural networks and\nvalidating dark matter substructure analysis pipelines.",

    "abstract": "Populations can become spatially organised through chemotaxis autoattraction,\nwherein population members release their own chemoattractant. Standard models\nof this process usually assume phenotypic homogeneity, but recent studies have\nshed illumination on the inherent heterogeneity within populations: in terms of\nchemotactic behaviour, trait heterogeneity can range from the sensitivity to\nattractant gradients to the rate at which attractants are produced. We propose\na framework that accounts for this heterogeneity, extending the standard\nKeller-Segel model to a non-local formulation in which the population is\ncontinuously structured across some phenotype state space. Focussing on\nautoattraction, we allow both the chemotactic sensitivity and the rate of\nattractant secretion to vary across the population and suppose members can\nswitch between different phenotype states. We extend classical Turing-type\nlinear stability analyses to determine the impact of phenotypic structuring on\npattern formation, showing that the rate of switching influences both the\ncritical condition for self-organisation and subsequent pattern dynamics.\nScenarios in which the chemotactic sensitivity and attractant secretion are\npositively or negatively correlated are used to highlight the significance of\nthese results.",

In this work, we investigate how nanoconfinement influences\nintermolecular interactions using a model trilayer system composed of a thick\npolystyrene (PS) base, a poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) middle layer with\ntunable thickness (15-95 nm), and a 10 nm top PS film. We find that the\ndewetting behavior of the top PS layer is highly sensitive to middle PMMA\nthickness, deviating from classical vdW-based predictions that assume bulk\nmaterial properties. By incorporating nanoconfinement-induced changes in PMMA\nrefractive index into the calculation of the Hamaker constant, we present a\nmodified theoretical framework that successfully captures the observed\nbehavior. This study links dewetting behavior and material property change as a\nfunction of underlayer thickness, providing direct evidence that\nnanoconfinement in soft matter systems significantly influences long-range\nintermolecular interactions. We show that film stability can be tuned solely by\nadjusting underlying layer thickness, while preserving both chemistry and\nthickness of top functional film.

When\napplied to Fe, this model enables the extrapolation of measured melting lines\nto the conditions of the Earth's inner core boundary (ICB). The ITCM describes\nthe solid-liquid phase transition in metals as resulting from a strong\nstructural perturbation due to a high concentration of interstitial-like\ndefects. The strong nonlinearity of their self-interaction causes the\nstabilization of this interstitial-rich phase. The original model is expanded\nto describe melting over a wide range of pressures and temperatures rather than\nfocusing on a specific isobaric transition. Using this model, we fit the\nmeasured melting data, extrapolate it to cover ICB conditions, and develop a\nmultiphase equation of state that encompasses this regime. The model is used to\nexplain contradictory data regarding the location of the melting line,\nresulting from a novel phase transition between two separate liquid phases,\nspecifically between FCC-based and HCP-based liquids.

Beginning with\nthe challenges faced by early strong interaction theories in the 1950s, we\nexplore the emergence of agnostic approaches such as the bootstrap philosophy\nand current algebra, which sought to describe hadronic phenomena without\nrelying on specific field theories. The pivotal role of experimental results\nfrom SLAC in the late 1960s is highlighted, leading to Bjorken's proposal of\nscaling in deep inelastic scattering and Feynman's parton model. We then delve\ninto the theoretical breakthroughs of the 1970s, including Wilson's operator\nproduct expansion and the renormalization group, which provided the framework\nfor understanding scaling violations. The discovery of asymptotic freedom in\nnon-Abelian gauge theories by Gross, Wilczek, and Politzer marked a turning\npoint, establishing QCD as the theory of strong interactions. Finally, we\ndiscuss the formulation of the Altarelli-Parisi equations, which elegantly\ndescribe the evolution of parton distribution functions and scaling violations,\nand their profound impact on the study of hard processes in particle physics.\nThis paper not only recounts the key developments but also reflects on the\ninterplay between theory and experiment that drove the field forward.",

Traditional response protocols rely on human\ndecision-making, which introduces potential inconsistencies and delays during\ncritical moments when every minute impacts both safety outcomes and network\nperformance. To address this issue, we propose a novel Incident Response\nBenchmark that uses generative artificial intelligence to automatically\ngenerate response plans for incoming traffic incidents. Our approach aims to\nsignificantly reduce incident resolution times by suggesting\ncontext-appropriate actions such as variable message sign deployment, lane\nclosures, and emergency resource allocation adapted to specific incident\ncharacteristics. First, the proposed methodology uses real-world incident\nreports from the Performance Measurement System (PeMS) as training and\nevaluation data. We extract historically implemented actions from these reports\nand compare them against AI-generated response plans that suggest specific\nactions, such as lane closures, variable message sign announcements, and/or\ndispatching appropriate emergency resources. Second, model evaluations reveal\nthat advanced generative AI models like GPT-4o and Grok 2 achieve superior\nalignment with expert solutions, demonstrated by minimized Hamming distances\n(averaging 2.96-2.98) and low weighted differences (approximately 0.27-0.28).\nConversely, while Gemini 1.5 Pro records the lowest count of missed actions,\nits extremely high number of unnecessary actions (1547 compared to 225 for\nGPT-4o) indicates an over-triggering strategy that reduces the overall plan\nefficiency.",

Our experiments\nshow that the best-performing model LightGBM achieves superior performance,\nwith RMSE improvements of up to 9.37\\% compared to LSTM variants with $R^2$\nvalues between 0.748-0.983. For anomaly detection, our iForest implementation\nachieved an F1-score of 0.87 with a false alarm rate of only 5.2\\%,\ndemonstrating strong generalization capabilities across different household\ntypes and consumption patterns, making it suitable for real-world HP\ndeployments.",

One of these problems is that of\nsurface soil taxonomy, a research area previously hindered by the reliance on\nhuman-derived classifications, which are mostly dependent on dividing a dataset\nbased on historical understandings of that data rather than data-driven,\nstatistically observable similarities. Using a ML-based taxonomy allows soil\nresearchers to move beyond the limitations of human visualization and create\nclassifications of high-dimension datasets with a much higher level of\nspecificity than possible with hand-drawn taxonomies. Furthermore, this\npipeline allows for the possibility of producing both highly accurate and\nflexible soil taxonomies with classes built to fit a specific application.

    "abstract": "Individuals often navigate several options with incomplete knowledge of their\nown preferences. Information provisioning tools such as public rankings and\npersonalized recommendations have become central to helping individuals make\nchoices, yet their value proposition under different marketplace environments\nremains unexplored. This paper studies a stylized model to explore the impact\nof these tools in two marketplace settings: uncapacitated supply, where items\ncan be selected by any number of agents, and capacitated supply, where each\nitem is constrained to be matched to a single agent. We model the agents\nutility as a weighted combination of a common term which depends only on the\nitem, reflecting the item's population level quality, and an idiosyncratic\nterm, which depends on the agent item pair capturing individual specific\ntastes. Public rankings reveal the common term, while personalized\nrecommendations reveal both terms. In the supply unconstrained settings, both\npublic rankings and personalized recommendations improve welfare, with their\nrelative value determined by the degree of preference heterogeneity. Public\nrankings are effective when preferences are relatively homogeneous, while\npersonalized recommendations become critical as heterogeneity increases. In\ncontrast, in supply constrained settings, revealing just the common term, as\ndone by public rankings, provides limited benefit since the total common value\navailable is limited by capacity constraints, whereas personalized\nrecommendations, by revealing both common and idiosyncratic terms,\nsignificantly enhance welfare by enabling agents to match with items they\nidiosyncratically value highly. These results illustrate the interplay between\nsupply constraints and preference heterogeneity in determining the\neffectiveness of information provisioning tools, offering insights for their\ndesign and deployment in diverse settings.",

Given $p$ possible\ntreatments, conducting all possible $2^p$ combinatorial interventions can be\nlaborious and quickly becomes infeasible as $p$ increases. Here we introduce\nprobabilistic factorial experimental design, formalized from how scientists\nperform lab experiments. In this framework, the experimenter selects a dosage\nfor each possible treatment and applies it to a group of units. Each unit\nindependently receives a random combination of treatments, sampled from a\nproduct Bernoulli distribution determined by the dosages. Additionally, the\nexperimenter can carry out such experiments over multiple rounds, adapting the\ndesign in an active manner. We address the optimal experimental design problem\nwithin an intervention model that imposes bounded-degree interactions between\ntreatments. In the passive setting, we provide a closed-form solution for the\nnear-optimal design. Our results prove that a dosage of $\\tfrac{1}{2}$ for each\ntreatment is optimal up to a factor of $1+O(\\tfrac{\\ln(n)}{n})$ for estimating\nany $k$-way interaction model, regardless of $k$, and imply that\n$O\\big(kp^{3k}\\ln(p)\\big)$ observations are required to accurately estimate\nthis model.

    "abstract": "Rapid, fine-grained disaster damage assessment is essential for effective\nemergency response, yet remains challenging due to limited ground sensors and\ndelays in official reporting. Social media provides a rich, real-time source of\nhuman-centric observations, but its multimodal and unstructured nature presents\nchallenges for traditional analytical methods. In this study, we propose a\nstructured Multimodal, Multilingual, and Multidimensional (3M) pipeline that\nleverages multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to assess disaster impacts.\nWe evaluate three foundation models across two major earthquake events using\nboth macro- and micro-level analyses. Results show that MLLMs effectively\nintegrate image-text signals and demonstrate a strong correlation with\nground-truth seismic data. However, performance varies with language,\nepicentral distance, and input modality. This work highlights the potential of\nMLLMs for disaster assessment and provides a foundation for future research in\napplying MLLMs to real-time crisis contexts.

    "abstract": "Diffusion models achieve realistic outcomes across a wide range of generative\ntasks, but their high computational cost remains a major barrier to deployment.\nModel pruning has emerged as a promising strategy to reduce inference cost and\nenable lightweight diffusion models. While effective, pruned diffusion models\nare proned to quality reduction due to limited capacity. A key limitation of\ncurrent pruning approaches is that pruned models are finetuned using the same\nobjective as the dense model, typically denoising score matching (DSM). Since\nthe dense model is accessible during finetuning, it warrants a more effective\napproach for knowledge transfer from the dense to the pruned model. Motivated\nby this aim, we revisit the finetuning stage and propose IGSM\n(\\textbf{I}mproved \\textbf{G}eometric and \\textbf{S}ensitivity\n\\textbf{M}atching), a general-purpose finetuning framework that introduces a\nsecond-order Jacobian projection loss inspired by Finite-Time Lyapunov\nExponents (FTLE). IGSM efficiently captures and aligns the geometric and the\ntemporal dynamics of pruned models with their dense teachers using scalable\nsecond-order projections. Our approach is architecture-agnostic and applies to\nboth U-Net- and Transformer-based diffusion models. Experiments on CIFAR-10,\nCelebA, LSUN-Church, and LSUN-Bedroom show that IGSM consistently narrows the\nperformance gap between pruned and dense models, substantially improving sample\nquality.

We use the\nstate-of-the-art SHARK v2.0 semi-analytic model to explore the evolution of\nthese galaxy-SMBH scaling relations to expand the available predictions from\ntheoretical models to contrast with existing and upcoming observations. We find\nthe relations between SMBH masses and both total and bulge stellar mass\npredicted by SHARK v2.0 to be in good overall agreement with observational\nmeasurements across a wide range of redshift and stellar masses. These scaling\nrelations show a significant evolution as a function of cosmic time in SHARK\nv2.0, with SMBH masses $\\sim1$ dex lower at $z=0$ compared to $z=9$ at fixed\nstellar mass and the scatter increasing by a factor of $\\sim2-5$ towards low\nredshift.

Both treatments of the three-body interaction return very\nsimilar total energies and pressures. The presence of three-body interactions\nhas only minor effects on the structural properties of the solid.

The capabilities of VLAs stem primarily\nfrom their architectures, which are often based on frontier large language\nmodels (LLMs). However, LLMs are known to be susceptible to adversarial misuse,\nand given the significant physical risks inherent to robotics, questions remain\nregarding the extent to which VLAs inherit these vulnerabilities. Motivated by\nthese concerns, in this work we initiate the study of adversarial attacks on\nVLA-controlled robots. Our main algorithmic contribution is the adaptation and\napplication of LLM jailbreaking attacks to obtain complete control authority\nover VLAs. We find that textual attacks, which are applied once at the\nbeginning of a rollout, facilitate full reachability of the action space of\ncommonly used VLAs and often persist over longer horizons. This differs\nsignificantly from LLM jailbreaking literature, as attacks in the real world do\nnot have to be semantically linked to notions of harm.

    "abstract": "Foundation models represent the most prominent and recent paradigm shift in\nartificial intelligence. Foundation models are large models, trained on broad\ndata that deliver high accuracy in many downstream tasks, often without\nfine-tuning. For this reason, models such as CLIP , DINO or Vision Transfomers\n(ViT), are becoming the bedrock of many industrial AI-powered applications.\nHowever, the reliance on pre-trained foundation models also introduces\nsignificant security concerns, as these models are vulnerable to adversarial\nattacks. Such attacks involve deliberately crafted inputs designed to deceive\nAI systems, jeopardizing their reliability. This paper studies the\nvulnerabilities of vision foundation models, focusing specifically on CLIP and\nViTs, and explores the transferability of adversarial attacks to downstream\ntasks. We introduce a novel attack, targeting the structure of\ntransformer-based architectures in a task-agnostic fashion. We demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our attack on several downstream tasks: classification,\ncaptioning, image/text retrieval, segmentation and depth estimation.

VLMs integrate visual\nmodalities with large language models (LLMs), which are well known to be\nprompt-sensitive. Hence, it is crucial to determine whether VLMs inherit this\ninstability to varying prompts. We therefore investigate which prompt\nvariations VLMs are most sensitive to and which VLMs are most agnostic to\nprompt variations. To this end, we introduce PARC (Prompt Analysis via\nReliability and Calibration), a VLM prompt sensitivity analysis framework built\non three pillars: (1) plausible prompt variations in both the language and\nvision domain, (2) a novel model reliability score with built-in guarantees,\nand (3) a calibration step that enables dataset- and prompt-spanning prompt\nvariation analysis. Regarding prompt variations, PARC's evaluation shows that\nVLMs mirror LLM language prompt sensitivity in the vision domain, and most\ndestructive variations change the expected answer. Regarding models,\noutstandingly robust VLMs among 22 evaluated models come from the InternVL2\nfamily. We further find indications that prompt sensitivity is linked to\ntraining data.

We demonstrate that this constraint is naturally evaded\nwhen the quartic coupling of the complex $U(1)_\\mathrm{PQ}$-breaking field is\nsmall. In this case, $f_a$ changes from a larger value during inflation to a\nsmaller value in the later universe, suppressing isocurvature perturbations.\nImportantly, we show that in large parts of parameter space this solution is\nnot jeopardised by overproduction of the axion through parametric resonance.\nThe isocurvature bounds are thus dependent on UV physics.

Estimates from TMLE suggested that alcohol use was\nassociated with a 49% increase in the relative risk (RR) of incident TB\ninfection (RR=1.49, 95%CI: 1.39-1.59). These estimates were notably larger and\nmore precise than estimates from inverse probability weighting (RR=1.13, 95%CI:\n1.00-1.27) and unadjusted, complete case analyses (RR=1.18, 95%CI: 0.89-1.57).\nOur work demonstrates the utility of causal models for describing the missing\ndata mechanism and TMLE for flexible inference.",

    "abstract": "Multi-object tracking (MOT) in team sports is particularly challenging due to\nthe fast-paced motion and frequent occlusions resulting in motion blur and\nidentity switches, respectively. Predicting player positions in such scenarios\nis particularly difficult due to the observed highly non-linear motion\npatterns. Current methods are heavily reliant on object detection and\nappearance-based tracking, which struggle to perform in complex team sports\nscenarios, where appearance cues are ambiguous and motion patterns do not\nnecessarily follow a linear pattern. To address these challenges, we introduce\nSportMamba, an adaptive hybrid MOT technique specifically designed for tracking\nin dynamic team sports. The technical contribution of SportMamba is twofold.\nFirst, we introduce a mamba-attention mechanism that models non-linear motion\nby implicitly focusing on relevant embedding dependencies. Second, we propose a\nheight-adaptive spatial association metric to reduce ID switches caused by\npartial occlusions by accounting for scale variations due to depth changes.\nAdditionally, we extend the detection search space with adaptive buffers to\nimprove associations in fast-motion scenarios. Our proposed technique,\nSportMamba, demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on various metrics in the\nSportsMOT dataset, which is characterized by complex motion and severe\nocclusion. Furthermore, we demonstrate its generalization capability through\nzero-shot transfer to VIP-HTD, an ice hockey dataset.",

    "abstract": "We explore the end state of gravitational collapse under quantum gravity\neffects and propose that Planck Star Remnants (PSR), formed via nonsingular\nbounces, could serve as viable dark matter candidates. Within the framework of\nLoop Quantum Cosmology, we model the collapse of a homogeneous matter\ndistribution and show that the classical singularity is replaced by a quantum\nbounce at the Planck density. By analytically matching the Friedmann Lemaitre\nRobertson Walker (FLRW) interior to an exterior Schwarzschild spacetime using\nthe Israel junction conditions, we demonstrate that the bounce remains causally\nhidden from external observers, avoiding any observable re-expansion. This\nnaturally leads to the formation of stable, non-radiating PSR, whose radius\ncoincides with the Schwarzschild radius when the black hole mass approaches the\nPlanck mass as a result of Hawking evaporation. We suggest that such remnants\nmay originate from evaporating primordial black holes in the early universe,\nand estimate the relic abundance needed for PSR to account for the observed\ndark matter density. We also discuss some crucial differences between PSR and\nprevious proposals of Planck mass relics.

We\nfind it to be 0.26 $^{+0.53}_{-0.46}$ M$_\\odot$, suggesting that E\\,95C is a\nlow-mass T Tauri star. We conclude that EC\\,95 is a hierarchical triple system\ncomprised of a tight central binary proto-Herbig\\,AeBe system and a lower mass\ncompanion on a wider orbit. These results contribute to improve our\nunderstanding of the stellar dynamics in this system and provide valuable\ninsights into its triple nature.",

    "abstract": "Continual learning--the ability to acquire, retain, and refine knowledge over\ntime--has always been fundamental to intelligence, both human and artificial.\nHistorically, different AI paradigms have acknowledged this need, albeit with\nvarying priorities: early expert and production systems focused on incremental\nknowledge consolidation, while reinforcement learning emphasised dynamic\nadaptation. With the rise of deep learning, deep continual learning has\nprimarily focused on learning robust and reusable representations over time to\nsolve sequences of increasingly complex tasks. However, the emergence of Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) and foundation models has raised the question: Do we\nstill need continual learning when centralised, monolithic models can tackle\ndiverse tasks with access to internet-scale knowledge? We argue that continual\nlearning remains essential for three key reasons: (i) continual pre-training is\nstill necessary to ensure foundation models remain up to date, mitigating\nknowledge staleness and distribution shifts while integrating new information;\n(ii) continual fine-tuning enables models to specialise and personalise,\nadapting to domain-specific tasks, user preferences, and real-world constraints\nwithout full retraining, avoiding the need for computationally expensive long\ncontext-windows; (iii) continual compositionality offers a scalable and modular\napproach to intelligence, enabling the orchestration of foundation models and\nagents to be dynamically composed, recombined, and adapted. While continual\npre-training and fine-tuning are explored as niche research directions, we\nargue it is continual compositionality that will mark the rebirth of continual\nlearning. The future of AI will not be defined by a single static model but by\nan ecosystem of continually evolving and interacting models, making continual\nlearning more relevant than ever.",

We require that each intermediate arrangement of tokens\nagain specifies an independent set of size $k$. Given $G$, $I_s$, and $I_t$, we\nask whether there exists a sequence of token jumps that transforms $I_s$ into\n$I_t$. When $k$ is part of the input, this problem is known to be\nPSPACE-complete. However, it was shown by Ito, Kami\\'nski, and Ono (2014) to be\nfixed-parameter tractable. That is, when $k$ is fixed, the problem can be\nsolved in time polynomial in the order of $G$.\n  Here we strengthen the upper bound on the running time in terms of $k$ by\nshowing that the problem has a kernel of size linear in $k$. More precisely, we\ntransform an arbitrary input problem on a $K_{3,r}$-minor-free graph into an\nequivalent problem on a ($K_{3,r}$-minor-free) graph with order $O(k)$.

While optimal absorption strategies based on\ntime-reversal symmetry have shown promise for single emitters, their\napplicability is limited in realistic multi-qubit systems where realistic\nlosses break time-reversal symmetry. This work introduces a robust approach\nusing complex frequency (CF) pulses specifically tailored to the complex\nreflection zeros of the complete, coupled, and explicitly lossy qubit-waveguide\nsystem. This method circumvents the limitations of idealized time-reversal\narguments by directly engaging with the dissipative system's true response\ncharacteristics. We first develop a theoretical framework for a system of three\ncoupled two-level emitters, employing Heisenberg equations to derive the\nsystem's response and design appropriate CF pulses that inherently account for\nthe system's dissipative nature. The efficacy and practicality of this approach\nare then validated through comprehensive transient simulations for a realistic\nmodel of three Josephson junction-based transmon qubits, explicitly including\nintrinsic qubit losses.

The current canonical conversion strategy stems\nfrom a statistics paper from Sellke et al. (2001), who derived an upper bound\non the Bayes factor between the test and null hypotheses, as a function of the\n$p$-value (or number of sigmas, $n_{\\sigma}$). A common practice within the\nexoplanet atmosphere community is to numerically invert this formula, going\nfrom a Bayes factor to $n_\\sigma$. This goes back to Benneke & Seager (2013) --\na highly cited paper that introduced Bayesian model comparison as a means of\ninferring the presence of specific chemical species -- in an attempt to\ncalibrate the Bayes factors from their technique for a community that in 2013\nwas more familiar with frequentist sigma significances. However, as originally\nnoted by Sellke et al. (2001), the conversion only provides an upper limit on\n$n_\\sigma$, with the true value generally being lower. This can result in\ninflations of claimed detection significances, and this note strongly urges the\ncommunity to stop converting to $n_\\sigma$ at all and simply stick with Bayes\nfactors.",

It has proven to\nbe a powerful tool for analyzing inherently multilinear data arising in\nhyperspectral imaging, medical imaging, neural dynamics, scientific\nsimulations, and more. At the heart of tubal tensor algebra lies a special\ntensor-tensor product: originally the t-product, later generalized into a full\nfamily of products via the $\\star_M$-product. Though initially defined through\nthe multiplication of a block-circulant unfolding of one tensor by a\nmatricization of another, it was soon observed that the t-product can be\ninterpreted as standard matrix multiplication where the scalars are tubes-i.e.,\nreal vectors twisted ``inward.'' Yet, a fundamental question remains: why is\nthis the ``right'' way to define a tensor-tensor product in the tubal setting?\nIn this paper, we show that the t-product and its $\\star_M$ generalization\narise naturally when viewing third-order tensors as matrices of tubes, together\nwith a small set of desired algebraic properties. Furthermore, we prove that\nthe $\\star_M$-product is, in fact, the only way to define a tubal product\nsatisfying these properties. Thus, while partly expository in nature - aimed at\npresenting the foundations of tubal tensor algebra in a cohesive and accessible\nway - this paper also addresses theoretical gaps in the tubal tensor framework,\nproves new results, and provides justification for the tubal tensor framework\ncentral constructions, thereby shedding new light on it.",

Using five public datasets (1,471 stories, 101 annotators\nincluding critics, students, and lay readers), we (i) extract 17 reference-less\ntextual features (e.g., coherence, emotional variance, average sentence\nlength...); (ii) model individual reader preferences, deriving feature\nimportance vectors that reflect their textual priorities; and (iii) analyze\nthese vectors in a shared \"preference space\". Reader vectors cluster into two\nprofiles: 'surface-focused readers' (mainly non-experts), who prioritize\nreadability and textual richness; and 'holistic readers' (mainly experts), who\nvalue thematic development, rhetorical variety, and sentiment dynamics.

    "abstract": "Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) has long promised the ability to compute\nover encrypted data without revealing sensitive contents -- a foundational goal\nfor secure cloud analytics. Yet despite decades of cryptographic advances,\npractical integration of FHE into real-world relational databases remains\nelusive. This paper presents \\textbf{Hermes}, the first system to enable\nFHE-native vector query processing inside a standard SQL engine. By leveraging\nthe multi-slot capabilities of modern schemes, Hermes introduces a novel data\nmodel that packs multiple records per ciphertext and embeds encrypted auxiliary\nstatistics (e.g., local sums) to support in-place updates and aggregation. To\nreconcile ciphertext immutability with record-level mutability, we develop new\nhomomorphic algorithms based on slot masking, shifting, and rewriting. Hermes\nis implemented as native C++ loadable functions in MySQL using OpenFHE v1.2.4,\ncomprising over 3,500 lines of code. Experiments on real-world datasets show up\nto 1{,}600$\\times$ throughput gain in encryption and over 30$\\times$ speedup in\ninsertion compared to per-tuple baselines. Hermes brings FHE from cryptographic\npromise to practical reality -- realizing a long-standing vision at the\nintersection of databases and secure computation.",

Because MC-PDFT and L-PDFT rely on\nan on-top energy functional, their accuracy depends on the quality of the\non-top functional used. Recent work has introduced translated\nmeta-gradient-approximation (meta-GA) on-top functionals, and specifically the\nMC23 hybrid meta-GA on-top functional, which is the first on-top functional\nspecifically optimized for MC-PDFT. Here we report the derivation and\nimplementation of analytic nuclear gradients for MC-PDFT calculations using\nmeta-GA and hybrid meta-GA on-top functionals. This development also enables\nanalytic nuclear gradients for the widely successful tPBE0 hybrid on-top\nfunctional. Because MC-PDFT nuclear-gradient calculations involve the\nderivative of the on-top functional, this development also enables the use of\nmeta-GA on-top functionals in L-PDFT single-point energy calculations. We use\nthe new capabilities to test MC23 for ground-state geometries, excited-state\ngeometries, and vertical excitation energies of s-trans-butadiene and\nbenzophenone as well as to test MC23, another hybrid meta-GA, and seven other\nmeta-GA on-top functionals for 441 vertical excitation energies. We find MC23\nperforms the best of all nine meta and hybrid meta functionals for vertical\nexcitation energies and is comparable in accuracy to tPBE0 and to the NEVPT2\nmultireference wave function method. Additionally, we directly compare our\nMC-PDFT vertical excitation results to previously computed TD-DFT values and\nfind that MC-PDFT outperforms even the best performing Kohn-Sham density\nfunctional.",

Unlike systems\nrelying on static rules or purely heuristic approaches, APEX dynamically\ndispatches compute across heterogeneous resources by predicting execution times\nof CPU and GPU subtasks to maximize overlap while avoiding scheduling\noverheads. We evaluate APEX on diverse workloads and GPU architectures (NVIDIA\nT4, A10), using LLaMa-2-7B and LLaMa-3.1-8B models. Compared to GPU-only\nschedulers like VLLM, APEX improves throughput by 84% - 96% on T4 and 11% - 89%\non A10 GPUs, while preserving latency. Against the best existing hybrid\nschedulers, it delivers up to 49% (T4) and 37% (A10) higher throughput in\nlong-output settings. APEX significantly advances hybrid LLM inference\nefficiency on such memory-constrained hardware and provides a blueprint for\nscheduling in heterogeneous AI systems, filling a critical gap for efficient\nreal-time LLM applications.",

    "abstract": "We have witnessed that strong LLMs like Qwen-Math, MiMo, and Phi-4 possess\nimmense reasoning potential inherited from the pre-training stage. With\nreinforcement learning (RL), these models can improve dramatically on reasoning\ntasks. Recent studies have shown that even RL on a single problem can unleash\nthese models' reasoning capabilities. However, RL is not only expensive but\nalso unstable. Even one-shot RL requires hundreds of GPU hours. This raises a\ncritical question: Is there a more efficient way to unleash the reasoning\npotential of these powerful base LLMs? In this work, we demonstrate that\nCritique Fine-Tuning (CFT) on only one problem can effectively unleash the\nreasoning potential of LLMs. Our method constructs critique data by collecting\ndiverse model-generated solutions to a single problem and using teacher LLMs to\nprovide detailed critiques. We fine-tune Qwen and Llama family models, ranging\nfrom 1.5B to 14B parameters, on the CFT data and observe significant\nperformance gains across diverse reasoning tasks. For example, with just 5 GPU\nhours of training, Qwen-Math-7B-CFT show an average improvement of 15% on six\nmath benchmarks and 16% on three logic reasoning benchmarks. These results are\ncomparable to or even surpass the results from RL with 20x less compute.\nAblation studies reveal the robustness of one-shot CFT across different prompt\nproblems. These results highlight one-shot CFT as a simple, general, and\ncompute-efficient approach to unleashing the reasoning capabilities of modern\nLLMs.",

These refinement steps mimic the iterative\nrefinements performed by classical optimization algorithms and are usually\nimplemented by neural layers (e.g., GRU) which are recurrently executed for a\nfixed and pre-determined number of steps. However, relying on a fixed number of\nsteps may result in suboptimal performance because it is not tailored to the\ninput data. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for predicting the\nderivative of the flow using a continuous model, namely neural ordinary\ndifferential equations (ODE). One key advantage of this approach is its\ncapacity to model an equilibrium process, dynamically adjusting the number of\ncompute steps based on the data at hand. By following a particular neural\narchitecture, ODE solver, and associated hyperparameters, our proposed model\ncan replicate the exact same updates as recurrent cells used in existing works,\noffering greater generality.

The experimental results\nreveal that paramagnetic manganese oxide nanoparticles exhibit significant\nmagnetophoretic behavior, leading to particle depletion within the cuvette.

At low magnetic field\ngradients, magnetophoresis progresses slowly, while at higher gradients, the\nparticle depletion rate increases significantly before stabilizing. Transient\nconcentration gradients emerge within the cuvette during magnetophoresis, which\nwe hypothesize are driven by magnetic Grashof numbers near unity.

    "abstract": "Decomposing a total causal effect into natural direct and indirect effects is\ncentral to revealing causal mechanisms. Conventional methods achieve the\ndecomposition by specifying an outcome model as a linear function of the\ntreatment, the mediator, and the observed covariates under identification\nassumptions including the assumption of no interaction between treatment and\nmediator. Recent statistical advances relax this assumption typically within\nthe linear or nonlinear regression framework. I propose a non-parametric\napproach that also relaxes the assumption of no treatment-mediator interaction\nwhile avoiding the problems of outcome model specification that become\nparticularly acute in the presence of a large number of covariates. The key\nidea is to estimate the marginal mean of each counterfactual outcome by\nassigning a weight to every experimental unit such that the weighted\ndistribution of the mediator under the experimental condition approximates the\ncounterfactual mediator distribution under the control condition. The weight is\na ratio of the conditional probability of a mediator value under the control\ncondition to that of the same mediator value under the experimental condition.\nA non-parametric approach to estimating the weight on the basis of propensity\nscore stratification promises to increase the robustness of the direct and\nindirect effect estimates. The outcome is modeled as a function of the direct\nand indirect effects with minimal model-based assumptions. This method applies\nregardless of the distribution of the outcome or the functional relationship\nbetween the outcome and the mediator, and is suitable for handling a large\nnumber of pretreatment covariates.

Our work investigates\nthis space, developing data-driven taxonomic categories of gender bias in the\ncontext of product description generation, which we situate with respect to\nexisting general purpose harms taxonomies. We illustrate how AI-generated\nproduct descriptions can uniquely surface gender biases in ways that require\nspecialized detection and mitigation approaches. Further, we quantitatively\nanalyze issues corresponding to our taxonomic categories in two models used for\nthis task -- GPT-3.5 and an e-commerce-specific LLM -- demonstrating that these\nforms of bias commonly occur in practice. Our results illuminate unique,\nunder-explored dimensions of gender bias, such as assumptions about clothing\nsize, stereotypical bias in which features of a product are advertised, and\ndifferences in the use of persuasive language. These insights contribute to our\nunderstanding of three types of AI harms identified by current frameworks:\nexclusionary norms, stereotyping, and performance disparities, particularly for\nthe context of e-commerce.",

These data reveal that Abell 1885 is a strong\ncool core, with a central cooling time of 0.43 Gyr, and that the central galaxy\nhosts an X-ray luminous point source at its center (L=2.3x10^42 erg/s),\nindicative of a rapidly accreting supermassive black hole. In the context of\nthe larger CEREAL sample, we constrain the fraction of clusters at z~0.15 with\nX-ray bright central AGN to be no more than 4.1%. Including radio data from\nLOFAR, GMRT, ASKAP, and the VLA and optical integral field unit data from SDSS\nMaNGA, we probe the details of cooling, feeding, and feedback in this system.\nThese data reveal that cooling of the intracluster medium is highly suppressed\non large (>10 kpc) scales despite a central supermassive black hole that is in\nthe early stages of the self-regulation cycle (characterized by rapid\naccretion, physically small jets, and no large-scale low-frequency radio\nemission). To reconcile the large-scale quenching with a lack of visible\nlarge-scale feedback, we propose that the timescale on which energy is\ndissipated on large scales is significantly longer than the timescale on which\nblack hole feeding operates on small (~pc) scales. These observations suggest\nthat there are two separate timescales characterizing AGN feedback in clusters:\nthe short timescale of small-scale feeding and feedback processes and a longer\ntimescale by which energy is dissipated on large physical scales in the\nintracluster medium. This interpretation disfavors a model in which the energy\nis rapidly dissipated (e.g. shocks), which would synchronize the feeding and\nfeedback timescales, and favors a model in which the heating effects of AGN\nfeedback can linger long after the outburst has passed (e.g. turbulent mixing).",

Modeling the modes as solutions of the Helmholtz\nequation within the three-dimensional (3D) waveguide geometry, a propagation\nansatz transforms the mode-finding problem into a 3D quadratic eigenproblem.\nThrough an untwisting map, the problem is shown to be equivalent to a 3D\nquadratic eigenproblem on a straightened configuration. Next, exploiting the\nconstant torsion and curvature of the Frenet frame of a circular helix, the 3D\neigenproblem is further reduced to a two-dimensional (2D) eigenproblem on the\nwaveguide cross section. All three eigenproblems are numerically treated. As\nexpected, significant computational savings are realized in the 2D model. A few\nnontrivial numerical techniques are needed to make the computation of modes\nwithin the 3D geometry feasible. They are presented along with a procedure to\neffectively filter out unwanted non-propagating eigenfunctions. Computational\nresults show that the geometric effect of coiling is to shift the localization\nof guided modes away from the coiling center. The variations in modes as\ncoiling pitch is changed are reported considering the example of a coiled\noptical fiber.",

    "abstract": "Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in\nhigh-quality image and video generation but incur substantial compute cost at\ninference. A common observation is that DiT latent noise vectors change slowly\nacross inference steps, which suggests that the DiT compute may be redundant\nacross steps. In this paper, we aim to speed up inference by reducing this\nredundancy, without additional training. We first study how activations change\nbetween steps in two state-of-the-art open-source DiTs. We find that just 5-25%\nof the values in attention and MLP explain 70-90% of the change in activations\nacross steps. This finding motivates our approach, Chipmunk, which uses dynamic\nsparsity at inference time to recompute only the fastest-changing intermediate\nactivations, while caching the rest. Dynamic sparsity introduces two systems\nchallenges: (1) sparse attention and MLP operations tend to underutilize GPU\ntensor cores; and (2) computing dynamic sparsity patterns at runtime and\ncaching activations both introduce overhead. To address these challenges,\nChipmunk first uses a voxel-based reordering of input tokens to introduce\ncolumn-wise sparsity. We implement column-sparse kernels utilizing efficient\nsparse gathers from global to shared GPU memory, achieving a 9.3x speedup at\n93% sparsity compared to highly-optimized dense baselines. Second, Chipmunk\noverlaps the computation of sparsity patterns and cache updates with other\nparts of the computation (e.g., second layer of the MLP) to hide the extra\nlatency. Chipmunk achieves up to 2.16x speedup on HunyuanVideo and 1.41x on\nFLUX.1-dev without compromising generation quality. Furthermore, we show that\nChipmunk can be stacked on top of full step caching, achieving a 3.72x speedup\non HunyuanVideo, a 2.67x speedup on WAN2.1, and a 2.25x speedup on FLUX.1-dev\nwith minimal quality impact.",

To bridge the current gap, this\npaper proposes ViLaIn-TAMP, a hybrid planning framework for enabling\nverifiable, interpretable, and autonomous robot behaviors. ViLaIn-TAMP\ncomprises three main components: (1) ViLaIn (Vision-Language Interpreter) - A\nprior framework that converts multimodal inputs into structured problem\nspecifications using off-the-shelf VLMs without additional domain-specific\ntraining, (2) a modular Task and Motion Planning (TAMP) system that grounds\nthese specifications in actionable trajectory sequences through symbolic and\ngeometric constraint reasoning and can utilize learning-based skills for key\nmanipulation phases, and (3) a corrective planning module which receives\nconcrete feedback on failed solution attempts from the motion and task planning\ncomponents and can feed adapted logic and geometric feasibility constraints\nback to ViLaIn to improve and further refine the specification.

    "abstract": "We highlight that the observed concurrence between the baryon and dark matter\nrelic densities can be explained via a parametric coincidence between two\ndistinct production mechanisms: Affleck-Dine baryogenesis and dark matter UV\nfreeze-in. In the Affleck-Dine mechanism, the baryon asymmetry is naturally\nproportional to the inflationary reheating temperature $T_{\\rm rh}$, which also\nplays a critical role in setting the relic abundance of UV freeze-in dark\nmatter. Since Affleck-Dine baryogenesis requires flat directions in the\npotential, the framework is inherently supersymmetric, offering compelling UV\nfreeze-in dark matter candidates such as the gravitino. We outline scenarios in\nwhich $T_{\\rm rh}$ simultaneously determines both relic abundances, resulting\nin a baryon-to-dark matter ratio of order unity that is largely insensitive to\n$T_{\\rm rh}$. We also discuss the conditions required to avoid Q-ball formation\nor dark matter production by other mechanisms, such as NLSP decays, to preserve\nthe parametric coincidence between baryon and dark matter abundances.",

    "abstract": "A prevailing approach to explain time series models is to generate\nattribution in time domain. A recent development in time series XAI is the\nconcept of explanation spaces, where any model trained in the time domain can\nbe interpreted with any existing XAI method in alternative domains, such as\nfrequency. The prevailing approach is to present XAI attributions either in the\ntime domain or in the domain where the attribution is most sparse. In this\npaper, we demonstrate that in certain cases, XAI methods can generate\nattributions that highlight fundamentally different features in the time and\nfrequency domains that are not direct counterparts of one another. This\nsuggests that both domains' attributions should be presented to achieve a more\ncomprehensive interpretation. Thus it shows the necessity of multi-domain\nexplanation. To quantify when such cases arise, we introduce the uncertainty\nprinciple (UP), originally developed in quantum mechanics and later studied in\nharmonic analysis and signal processing, to the XAI literature. This principle\nestablishes a lower bound on how much a signal can be simultaneously localized\nin both the time and frequency domains. By leveraging this concept, we assess\nwhether attributions in the time and frequency domains violate this bound,\nindicating that they emphasize distinct features. In other words, UP provides a\nsufficient condition that the time and frequency domain explanations do not\nmatch and, hence, should be both presented to the end user. We validate the\neffectiveness of this approach across various deep learning models, XAI\nmethods, and a wide range of classification and forecasting datasets. The\nfrequent occurrence of UP violations across various datasets and XAI methods\nhighlights the limitations of existing approaches that focus solely on\ntime-domain explanations. This underscores the need for multi-domain\nexplanations as a new paradigm.",

We compare the properties of these analogues to control samples of\n'normal' dwarfs, which reside on the star formation main sequence (SFMS) at\nz~0.2 and are matched in their stellar mass and redshift distributions to the\nanalogue population. The analogue and normal populations do not show\ndifferences, either in their half-light radii or the projected distances to\nnodes, filaments and massive galaxies. This suggests that the comparatively\nextreme SFRs in the analogues are not driven by them being anomalously compact\nor because they reside in specific environments which might provide a larger\ngas supply. However, the fractions of interacting galaxies and those that have\nearly-type morphology are significantly elevated (by factors of ~5.6 and ~9\nrespectively) in the analogues compared to the normal population. Extrapolation\nof the redshift evolution of the star formation main sequence into our mass\nrange of interest appears to underestimate the SFRs of observed dwarfs at\nz~5.5. Since current SFMS measurements remain dominated by low and intermediate\nredshift data (especially at low stellar masses), our study suggests that this\nunderestimation may be driven by interactions (which are more frequent at\nearlier epochs) boosting the SFRs in the high-redshift dwarf population. Our\nresults are consistent with a picture where higher gas availability, augmented\nby interactions, drives much of the stellar mass assembly of dwarf galaxies in\nthe early Universe.",

Through a\ncomprehensive parameter-space scan consistent with current theoretical and\nexperimental constraints, we identify regions supporting strong first-order\nEWPTs (SFOEWPTs), including multi-step transitions. We find that two-step\nSFOEWPTs occur as frequently as one-step transitions, while three-step\ntransitions can occur, albeit rarely. Crucially, the parameter spaces inducing\none-step and two-step transitions are partially yet significantly separated:\none-step transitions restrict the charged Higgs mass and $\\tan\\beta$ to\n$m_{H^\\pm}\\in[295,441]\\,\\text{GeV}$ and $\\tan\\beta\\in[4.2,8.8]$, whereas\ntwo-step transitions allow $m_{H^\\pm}\\in[100,350]\\,\\text{GeV}$ and\n$\\tan\\beta\\in[2.5,45.4]$.

Recent mathematical developments\n[Kontsevich and Soibelman, arXiv:2402.07343] have illuminated the role of\nexponential integrals as periods of twisted de Rham cocycles over Betti cycles,\nproviding a structured approach to tackle this problem in many situations. In\nthis paper, we apply these concepts to show how families of physically relevant\nintegrals, ranging from exponentials to logarithmic multivalued functions, can\nbe recast as twisted periods of differential forms over homology cycles. In the\ncase of holomorphic exponents, we provide explicit decompositions as thimble\nexpansions and reveal a geometric wall-crossing structure behind the analytic\ncontinuation in parameters. We then show that the generalization to multivalued\nfunctions provides the right framework to describe Feynman integrals in the\nBaikov representation, where the multivaluedness is governed by the logarithm\nof the Baikov polynomial. In this context, the thimble decomposition aligns\nwith the decomposition into Master Integrals. We highlight how the\nwall-crossing structure allows for a sharp count of independent Master\nIntegrals (or periods), circumventing complications arising from Stokes\nphenomena. Additionally, we study the large-parameter expansions of these\nintegrals, whose coefficients correspond to periods of standard (co-)homology\nassociated with families of algebraic varieties, and which reveal the dominant\nbasis elements in different sectors of the wall crossing structure. This\nunifies perturbative expansions and geometric representation theory under a\nsingle cohomological framework.",

The\n$f_{\\mathrm{esc}}^{\\mathrm{Ly\\alpha}}$ of LAEs is anticorrelated with stellar\nmass, and this correlation is found to depend on the age of LAEs, such that old\nLAEs show a weaker anticorrelation than young LAEs, and tend to exhibit higher\n$f_{\\mathrm{esc}}^{\\mathrm{Ly\\alpha}}$ than young LAEs at a given stellar mass.\nThis implies that Ly$\\alpha$ photons escape more efficiently from old LAEs,\npossibly through the low-density channels of HI and dust created by outflows.\nThe average $f_{\\mathrm{esc}}^{\\mathrm{Ly\\alpha}}$ of young LAEs remains nearly\nconstant at $\\sim40$% at $z = 2.2-6.6$, suggesting that the previously observed\nevolution of global $f_{\\mathrm{esc}}^{\\mathrm{Ly\\alpha}}$ of star-forming\ngalaxies (SFGs) is due to the changes in the LAE fraction among the SFGs.\nConverting $f_{\\mathrm{esc}}^{\\mathrm{Ly\\alpha}}$ to Lyman continuum escape\nfraction using empirical relations, we demonstrate that LAEs alone can supply\nthe ionizing photons necessary for reionization at $z\\sim6$, causing rapid and\nlate reionization.",

This catalog is based on our\n\\textit{James Webb Space Telescope} 255\\,h COSMOS-Web program, which provides\ndeep near-infrared imaging in four NIRCam (F115W, F150W, F277W, F444W) and one\nMIRI (F770W) filter over the central $\\sim 0.54 {\\, \\rm deg}^2$ ($\\sim 0.2 {\\,\n\\rm deg}^2$ for MIRI) in COSMOS. These data are combined with ground- and\nspace-based data to derive photometric measurements of NIRCam-detected sources\nusing both fixed-aperture photometry (on the space-based bands) and a\nprofile-fitting technique on all 37 bands spanning 0.3-8 micron. We provide\nmorphology for all sources from complementary techniques including profile\nfitting and machine-learning classification. We derive photometric redshifts,\nphysical parameters and non-parametric star formation histories from spectral\nenergy distribution (SED) fitting. The catalog has been extensively validated\nagainst previous COSMOS catalogs and other surveys. Photometric redshift\naccuracy measured using spectroscopically confirmed galaxies out to $z\\sim9$\nreaches $\\sigma_{\\rm MAD} = 0.012$ at $m_{\\rm F444W}<28$ and remains at\n$\\sigma_{\\rm MAD} \\lesssim 0.03$ as a function of magnitude, color, and galaxy\ntype.

    "abstract": "The Little Red Dots (LRDs) are high-redshift galaxies uncovered by JWST,\ncharacterized by small effective radii ($R_{\\rm eff} \\sim 80-300$ pc), number\ndensities that are intermediate between those of typical galaxies and quasars,\nand a redshift distribution peaked at $z \\sim 5$. We present a theoretical\nmodel in which the LRDs descend from dark matter halos in the extreme low-spin\ntail of the angular momentum distribution. Within this framework, we explain\ntheir three key observational signatures: (i) abundance, (ii) compactness, and\n(iii) redshift distribution. Our model focuses on observed, not modeled,\nproperties; it is thus independent of whether they are powered primarily by a\nblack hole or stars. We find that the assumption that the prototypical LRD at\n$z\\sim5$ originates from halos in the lowest $\\sim 1\\%$ of the spin\ndistribution is sufficient to reproduce both their observed number densities\nand physical sizes. The redshift evolution of their observability is driven by\nthe interplay between the evolving compact disk fraction and cosmological\nsurface brightness dimming. This effect leads to a well-defined \"LRDs Era\" at\n$4<z<8$, during which the LRDs are common and detectable; at $z<4$, they are\nbright but rare, while at $z>8$, they are common but faint. Finally, we test\nthe predicted redshift trend against observational data, finding excellent\nagreement. Additional observational support comes from their excess small-scale\nclustering and spectral signatures of extreme core densities, both of which are\nexpected outcomes of galaxy formation in low-spin halos. These findings suggest\nthat the LRDs are not a fundamentally distinct population but the natural\nmanifestation of galaxies forming in the rarest, lowest angular momentum\nenvironments.",

    "abstract": "Modern language models are typically trained over subword sequences, but\nultimately define probabilities over character-strings. Ideally, the choice of\nthe tokeniser -- which maps character-strings to subwords -- should not affect\nthe probability assigned to the underlying character-string; in practice, it\ndoes. We define this mismatch as tokenisation bias. In this work, we quantify\none particular type of tokenisation bias: the effect of including or not a\nsubword (e.g., $\\langle hello \\rangle$) in a tokeniser's vocabulary on the\nprobability a trained model assigns to the corresponding characters (i.e.,\n\\textit{``hello''}). Estimating this effect is challenging because each model\nis trained with only one tokeniser. We address this by framing tokenisation\nbias as a causal effect and estimating it using the regression discontinuity\ndesign. Specifically, we exploit the fact that tokenisation algorithms rank\nsubwords and add the first $K$ to a tokeniser's vocabulary, where $K$ is an\narbitrary cutoff point. As such, we can estimate a causal effect by comparing\nsimilar subwords around this cutoff. Experimentally, we find that tokenisation\nconsistently affects models' outputs across scales, vocabularies, and\ntokenisers. Notably, a subword's presence in a small model's vocabulary may\nincrease its characters' probability by up to 17 times, highlighting\ntokenisation as a key design choice in language modelling.",

    "abstract": "Since the discovery of phase transitions driven by topological defects, the\nclassification of phases of matter has been significantly extended beyond\nGinzburg and Landau's paradigm of spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB). In\nparticular, intrinsic and symmetry-protected topological (SPT) orders have been\ndiscovered in (mostly gapped) quantum many-body ground states. However, these\nare commonly viewed as zero-temperature phenomena, and their robustness in a\ngapless ground state or against thermal fluctuations remains challenging to\ntackle. Here we introduce an explicit construction for SPT-type states with\nhidden order associated with SSB: They feature (quasi) long-range correlations\nalong appropriate edges, but short-range order in the bulk; ground state\ndegeneracy associated with SSB; and non-local string order in the bulk. We\napply our construction to predict two types of finite-temperature SPT\ntransitions, in the Ising and BKT class respectively, where the usual signs of\ncriticality appear despite the absence of a diverging correlation length in the\nbulk. While the state featuring hidden Ising order is gapped, the other SPT\nstate associated with the BKT-SPT transition has hidden $U(1)$, or XY-order and\nconstitutes an intrinsically gapless SPT state, associated with a gapless\nGoldstone mode. Specifically, in this work we discuss spins with global\n$\\mathbb{Z}_2$ or $U(1)$ symmetry coupled to link variables constituting a loop\ngas model. By mapping this system to an Ising-gauge theory, we demonstrate that\none of the SPT phases we construct corresponds to the Higgs-SPT phase at $T=0$\n-- which we show here to remain stable at finite temperature. Our work paves\nthe way for a more systematic search for hidden order SPT phases, including in\ngapless systems, and raises the question if a natural (finite-$T$) spin liquid\ncandidate exists that realizes hidden order in the Higgs-SPT class.",

    "abstract": "One of the principal challenges in building VLM-powered GUI agents is visual\ngrounding, i.e., localizing the appropriate screen region for action execution\nbased on both the visual content and the textual plans. Most existing work\nformulates this as a text-based coordinate generation task. However, these\napproaches suffer from several limitations: weak spatial-semantic alignment,\ninability to handle ambiguous supervision targets, and a mismatch between the\ndense nature of screen coordinates and the coarse, patch-level granularity of\nvisual features extracted by models like Vision Transformers. In this paper, we\npropose GUI-Actor, a VLM-based method for coordinate-free GUI grounding. At its\ncore, GUI-Actor introduces an attention-based action head that learns to align\na dedicated <ACTOR> token with all relevant visual patch tokens, enabling the\nmodel to propose one or more action regions in a single forward pass. In line\nwith this, we further design a grounding verifier to evaluate and select the\nmost plausible action region from the candidates proposed for action execution.\nExtensive experiments show that GUI-Actor outperforms prior state-of-the-art\nmethods on multiple GUI action grounding benchmarks, with improved\ngeneralization to unseen screen resolutions and layouts. Notably, GUI-Actor-7B\neven surpasses UI-TARS-72B (38.1) on ScreenSpot-Pro, achieving scores of 40.7\nwith Qwen2-VL and 44.6 with Qwen2.5-VL as backbones. Furthermore, by\nincorporating the verifier, we find that fine-tuning only the newly introduced\naction head (~100M parameters for 7B model) while keeping the VLM backbone\nfrozen is sufficient to achieve performance comparable to previous\nstate-of-the-art models, highlighting that GUI-Actor can endow the underlying\nVLM with effective grounding capabilities without compromising its\ngeneral-purpose strengths.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in interactive video generation have shown promising results,\nyet existing approaches struggle with scene-consistent memory capabilities in\nlong video generation due to limited use of historical context. In this work,\nwe propose Context-as-Memory, which utilizes historical context as memory for\nvideo generation. It includes two simple yet effective designs: (1) storing\ncontext in frame format without additional post-processing; (2) conditioning by\nconcatenating context and frames to be predicted along the frame dimension at\nthe input, requiring no external control modules. Furthermore, considering the\nenormous computational overhead of incorporating all historical context, we\npropose the Memory Retrieval module to select truly relevant context frames by\ndetermining FOV (Field of View) overlap between camera poses, which\nsignificantly reduces the number of candidate frames without substantial\ninformation loss. Experiments demonstrate that Context-as-Memory achieves\nsuperior memory capabilities in interactive long video generation compared to\nSOTAs, even generalizing effectively to open-domain scenarios not seen during\ntraining.

With the discovery of two radio\njets in the source quasar, the strong gravitational lens HS 0810+2554 can no\nlonger be well fit by elliptical mass models, suggesting perturbations on\nsmall-scales.

Our approach enables the construction of new classes of\nLagrangians that respect duality symmetry, both in the relativistic and\nCarrollian frameworks. In the relativistic setting, we not only recover\nwell-known examples such as Born-Infeld and ModMax theories, but also identify\nnovel models. We then generalize the GZ formalism to the Carrollian case and\nconstruct several classes of Carrollian self-dual non-linear electrodynamic\nmodels. Remarkably, we demonstrate that the characteristic flow exhibits an\nattractor behavior, in the sense that different seed theories that may not be\nself-dual can generate the same descendant self-dual Lagrangian. These findings\nbroaden the landscape of self-dual theories and open new directions for\nexploring duality in ultra-relativistic regimes.",

To produce engaging animations, it is essential to\ngenerate coherent multi-shot video clips with narrative scripts and character\nreferences. However, existing public datasets primarily focus on real-world\nscenarios with global descriptions, and lack reference images for consistent\ncharacter guidance. To bridge this gap, we present AnimeShooter, a\nreference-guided multi-shot animation dataset. AnimeShooter features\ncomprehensive hierarchical annotations and strong visual consistency across\nshots through an automated pipeline. Story-level annotations provide an\noverview of the narrative, including the storyline, key scenes, and main\ncharacter profiles with reference images, while shot-level annotations\ndecompose the story into consecutive shots, each annotated with scene,\ncharacters, and both narrative and descriptive visual captions. Additionally, a\ndedicated subset, AnimeShooter-audio, offers synchronized audio tracks for each\nshot, along with audio descriptions and sound sources. To demonstrate the\neffectiveness of AnimeShooter and establish a baseline for the reference-guided\nmulti-shot video generation task, we introduce AnimeShooterGen, which leverages\nMultimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and video diffusion models. The\nreference image and previously generated shots are first processed by MLLM to\nproduce representations aware of both reference and context, which are then\nused as the condition for the diffusion model to decode the subsequent shot.\nExperimental results show that the model trained on AnimeShooter achieves\nsuperior cross-shot visual consistency and adherence to reference visual\nguidance, which highlight the value of our dataset for coherent animated video\ngeneration.",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel combination of constraint encoding methods for\nthe Quantum Approximate Optimization Ansatz (QAOA). Real-world optimization\nproblems typically consist of multiple types of constraints. To solve these\noptimization problems with quantum methods, normally, all constraints are added\nas quadratic penalty terms to the objective, which expands the search space and\nincreases problem complexity. This work proposes a general workflow that\nextracts and encodes specific constraints directly into the circuit of QAOA:\nOne-hot constraints are enforced through $XY$-mixers that restrict the search\nspace to the feasible sub-space naturally. Inequality constraints are\nimplemented through oracle-based Indicator Functions (IF). This paper focuses\non the numerical benchmarks of the combined approach for solving the\nMulti-Knapsack (MKS) and the Prosumer Problem (PP), a modification of the MKS\nin the domain of electricity optimization. To this end, we introduce\ncomputational techniques that efficiently simulate the two presented constraint\narchitectures. Since $XY$-mixers restrict the search space, specific state\nvector entries are always zero and can be omitted from the simulation, saving\nvaluable memory and computing resources. We benchmark the combined method\nagainst the established QUBO formulation, yielding a better solution quality\nand probability of sampling the optimal solution. Despite more complex\ncircuits, the time-to-solution is more than an order of magnitude faster\ncompared to the baseline methods and exhibits more favorable scaling\nproperties.",

Inspired\nby Self-Attention's insensitivity to token orders, we find an interesting\nphenomenon neglected in current works: disrupting the continuity of image\ntokens (i.e., making pixels not smoothly transited across patches) in ViT leads\nto a noticeable performance decline in the general (source) domain but only a\nmarginal decrease in downstream target domains.

Meanwhile, it implies\nthat only smaller patterns within each patch could be transferred under extreme\ndomain gaps. Based on this interpretation, we further propose a simple yet\neffective method for CDFSL that better disrupts the continuity of image tokens,\nencouraging the model to rely less on large patterns and more on smaller ones.\nExtensive experiments show the effectiveness of our method in reducing domain\ngaps and outperforming state-of-the-art works.

In this paper, we define the problem of designing the optimal\nalgorithmic delegate in the presence of categories. This is an important\ndimension in the design of algorithms to work with humans, since we show that\nthe optimal delegate can be an arbitrarily better teammate than the optimal\nstandalone algorithmic agent. The solution to this optimal delegation problem\nis not obvious: we discover that this problem is fundamentally combinatorial,\nand illustrate the complex relationship between the optimal design and the\nproperties of the decision-making task even in simple settings. Indeed, we show\nthat finding the optimal delegate is computationally hard in general. However,\nwe are able to find efficient algorithms for producing the optimal delegate in\nseveral broad cases of the problem, including when the optimal action may be\ndecomposed into functions of features observed by the human and the algorithm.\nFinally, we run computational experiments to simulate a designer updating an\nalgorithmic delegate over time to be optimized for when it is actually adopted\nby users, and show that while this process does not recover the optimal\ndelegate in general, the resulting delegate often performs quite well.",

However, recent work has demonstrated phenomenology of model\nrepresentations that lies outside the scope of this hypothesis, showing\nsignatures of hierarchical, nonlinear, and multi-dimensional features. This\nraises the question: do SAEs represent features that possess structure at odds\nwith their motivating hypothesis? If not, does avoiding this mismatch help\nidentify said features and gain further insights into neural network\nrepresentations? To answer these questions, we take a construction-based\napproach and re-contextualize the popular matching pursuits (MP) algorithm from\nsparse coding to design MP-SAE -- an SAE that unrolls its encoder into a\nsequence of residual-guided steps, allowing it to capture hierarchical and\nnonlinearly accessible features. Comparing this architecture with existing SAEs\non a mixture of synthetic and natural data settings, we show: (i) hierarchical\nconcepts induce conditionally orthogonal features, which existing SAEs are\nunable to faithfully capture, and (ii) the nonlinear encoding step of MP-SAE\nrecovers highly meaningful features, helping us unravel shared structure in the\nseemingly dichotomous representation spaces of different modalities in a\nvision-language model, hence demonstrating the assumption that useful features\nare solely linearly accessible is insufficient. We also show that the\nsequential encoder principle of MP-SAE affords an additional benefit of\nadaptive sparsity at inference time, which may be of independent interest.\nOverall, we argue our results provide credence to the idea that\ninterpretability should begin with the phenomenology of representations, with\nmethods emerging from assumptions that fit it.",

Expanding on this, we introduce Early\nVision Networks (EVNets), a new class of hybrid CNNs that combine the VOneBlock\nwith a novel SubcorticalBlock, whose architecture draws from computational\nmodels in neuroscience and is parameterized to maximize alignment with\nsubcortical responses reported across multiple experimental studies. Without\nbeing optimized to do so, the assembly of the SubcorticalBlock with the\nVOneBlock improved V1 alignment across most standard V1 benchmarks, and better\nmodeled extra-classical receptive field phenomena. In addition, EVNets exhibit\nstronger emergent shape bias and overperform the base CNN architecture by 8.5%\non an aggregate benchmark of robustness evaluations, including adversarial\nperturbations, common corruptions, and domain shifts. Finally, we show that\nEVNets can be further improved when paired with a state-of-the-art data\naugmentation technique, surpassing the performance of the isolated data\naugmentation approach by 7.3% on our robustness benchmark. This result reveals\ncomplementary benefits between changes in architecture to better mimic biology\nand training-based machine learning approaches.",

The first few stages of this mapping in the cochlea have been\nmodelled successfully, with biophysical models built by hand and, more\nrecently, with DNN models trained on datasets simulated by biophysical models.\nModelling the auditory brain has been a challenge because central auditory\nprocessing is too complex for models to be built by hand, and datasets for\ntraining DNN models directly have not been available. Recent work has taken\nadvantage of large-scale high resolution neural recordings from the auditory\nmidbrain to build a DNN model of normal hearing with great success. But this\nmodel assumes that auditory processing is the same in all brains, and therefore\nit cannot capture the widely varying effects of hearing loss.\n  We propose a novel variational-conditional model to learn to encode the space\nof hearing loss directly from recordings of neural activity in the auditory\nmidbrain of healthy and noise exposed animals. With hearing loss parametrised\nby only 6 free parameters per animal, our model accurately predicts 62\\% of the\nexplainable variance in neural responses from normal hearing animals and 68%\nfor hearing impaired animals, within a few percentage points of state of the\nart animal specific models. We demonstrate that the model can be used to\nsimulate realistic activity from out of sample animals by fitting only the\nlearned conditioning parameters with Bayesian optimisation, achieving\ncrossentropy loss within 2% of the optimum in 15-30 iterations. Including more\nanimals in the training data slightly improved the performance on unseen\nanimals. This model will enable future development of parametrised hearing loss\ncompensation models trained to directly restore normal neural coding in hearing\nimpaired brains, which can be quickly fitted for a new user by human in the\nloop optimisation.",

    "abstract": "We present `GL-LowPopArt`, a novel Catoni-style estimator for generalized\nlow-rank trace regression. Building on `LowPopArt` (Jang et al., 2024), it\nemploys a two-stage approach: nuclear norm regularization followed by matrix\nCatoni estimation. We establish state-of-the-art estimation error bounds,\nsurpassing existing guarantees (Fan et al., 2019; Kang et al., 2022), and\nreveal a novel experimental design objective, $\\mathrm{GL}(\\pi)$. The key\ntechnical challenge is controlling bias from the nonlinear inverse link\nfunction, which we address by our two-stage approach. We prove a *local*\nminimax lower bound, showing that our `GL-LowPopArt` enjoys instance-wise\noptimality up to the condition number of the ground-truth Hessian. Applications\ninclude generalized linear matrix completion, where `GL-LowPopArt` achieves a\nstate-of-the-art Frobenius error guarantee, and **bilinear dueling bandits**, a\nnovel setting inspired by general preference learning (Zhang et al., 2024). Our\nanalysis of a `GL-LowPopArt`-based explore-then-commit algorithm reveals a new,\npotentially interesting problem-dependent quantity, along with improved Borda\nregret bound than vectorization (Wu et al., 2024).",

    "abstract": "Modern Gaussian Splatting methods have proven highly effective for real-time\nphotorealistic rendering of 3D scenes. However, integrating semantic\ninformation into this representation remains a significant challenge,\nespecially in maintaining real-time performance for SLAM (Simultaneous\nLocalization and Mapping) applications. In this work, we introduce LEG-SLAM --\na novel approach that fuses an optimized Gaussian Splatting implementation with\nvisual-language feature extraction using DINOv2 followed by a learnable feature\ncompressor based on Principal Component Analysis, while enabling an online\ndense SLAM. Our method simultaneously generates high-quality photorealistic\nimages and semantically labeled scene maps, achieving real-time scene\nreconstruction with more than 10 fps on the Replica dataset and 18 fps on\nScanNet. Experimental results show that our approach significantly outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods in reconstruction speed while achieving competitive\nrendering quality. The proposed system eliminates the need for prior data\npreparation such as camera's ego motion or pre-computed static semantic maps.\nWith its potential applications in autonomous robotics, augmented reality, and\nother interactive domains, LEG-SLAM represents a significant step forward in\nreal-time semantic 3D Gaussian-based SLAM.

    "abstract": "The importance of clinical variables in the prognosis of the disease is\nexplained using statistical correlation or machine learning (ML). However, the\npredictive importance of these variables may not represent their causal\nrelationships with diseases. This paper uses clinical variables from a heart\nfailure (HF) patient cohort to investigate the causal explainability of\nimportant variables obtained in statistical and ML contexts. Due to inherent\nregression modeling, popular causal discovery methods strictly assume that the\ncause and effect variables are numerical and continuous. This paper proposes a\nnew computational framework to enable causal structure discovery (CSD) and\nscore the causal strength of mixed-type (categorical, numerical, binary)\nclinical variables for binary disease outcomes. In HF classification, we\ninvestigate the association between the importance rank order of three feature\ntypes: correlated features, features important for ML predictions, and causal\nfeatures. Our results demonstrate that CSD modeling for nonlinear causal\nrelationships is more meaningful than its linear counterparts. Feature\nimportance obtained from nonlinear classifiers (e.g., gradient-boosting trees)\nstrongly correlates with the causal strength of variables without\ndifferentiating cause and effect variables. Correlated variables can be causal\nfor HF, but they are rarely identified as effect variables. These results can\nbe used to add the causal explanation of variables important for ML-based\nprediction modeling.",

Prompt inversion, the task of identifying\nthe textual prompt used to generate a specific artifact, holds significant\npotential for applications including data attribution, model provenance, and\nwatermarking validation. Recent studies introduced a delayed projection scheme\nto optimize for prompts representative of the vocabulary space, though\nchallenges in semantic fluency and efficiency remain. Advanced image captioning\nmodels or visual large language models can generate highly interpretable\nprompts, but they often lack in image similarity. In this paper, we propose a\nprompt inversion technique called \\sys for text-to-image diffusion models,\nwhich includes initializing embeddings using a pre-trained image captioning\nmodel, refining them through reverse-engineering in the latent space, and\nconverting them to texts using an embedding-to-text model. Our experiments on\nthe widely-used datasets, such as MS COCO, LAION, and Flickr, show that our\nmethod outperforms existing methods in terms of image similarity, textual\nalignment, prompt interpretability and generalizability.

    "abstract": "Link functions, which characterize how human preferences are generated from\nthe value function of an RL problem, are a crucial component in designing RLHF\nalgorithms. Almost all RLHF algorithms, including state-of-the-art ones in\nempirical studies such as DPO and PPO, assume the link function is known to the\nagent (e.g., a logistic function according to the Bradley-Terry model), which\nis arguably unrealistic considering the complex nature of human preferences. To\navoid link function mis-specification, this paper studies general RLHF problems\nwith unknown link functions. We propose a novel policy optimization algorithm\ncalled ZSPO based on a new zeroth-order policy optimization method, where the\nkey is to use human preference to construct a parameter update direction that\nis positively correlated with the true policy gradient direction. ZSPO achieves\nit by estimating the sign of the value function difference instead of\nestimating the gradient from the value function difference, so it does not\nrequire knowing the link function. Under mild conditions, ZSPO converges to a\nstationary policy with a polynomial convergence rate depending on the number of\npolicy iterations and trajectories per iteration.

Through detailed analysis of attention maps in Video\nDiffusion Transformer (vDiT), we identify three recurring sparsity patterns:\ndiagonal, multi-diagonal, and vertical-stripe structures. And even 3-6\\%\nattention heads can be skipped. Crucially, these patterns exhibit strong\nlayer-depth and head-position correlations but show limited dependence on the\ninput content. Leveraging these findings, we propose Sparse-vDiT, a sparsity\nacceleration framework for vDiT comprising: 1) Pattern-optimized sparse kernels\nthat replace dense attention with computationally efficient implementations for\neach identified sparsity pattern. 2) An offline sparse diffusion search\nalgorithm that selects the optimal sparse computation strategy per layer and\nhead via hardware-aware cost modeling. After determining the optimal\nconfiguration, we fuse heads within the same layer that share the same\nattention strategy, enhancing inference efficiency. Integrated into\nstate-of-the-art vDiT models (CogVideoX1.5, HunyuanVideo, and Wan2.1),\nSparse-vDiT achieves 2.09$\\times$, 2.38$\\times$, and 1.67$\\times$ theoretical\nFLOP reduction, and actual inference speedups of 1.76$\\times$, 1.85$\\times$,\nand 1.58$\\times$, respectively, while maintaining high visual fidelity, with\nPSNR values reaching 24.13, 27.09, and 22.59.

A novel\nnon-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) assisted PASS framework is proposed for\ndownlink multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communications. The\ntransmit power minimization problem is formulated to jointly optimize the\ntransmit beamforming, pinching beamforming, and power allocation. To solve this\nhighly nonconvex problem, both gradient-based and swarm-based optimization\nmethods are developed. 1) For gradient-based method, a\nmajorization-minimization and penalty dual decomposition (MM-PDD) algorithm is\ndeveloped. The Lipschitz gradient surrogate function is constructed based on MM\nto tackle the nonconvex terms of this problem. Then, the joint optimization\nproblem is decomposed into subproblems that are alternatively optimized based\non PDD to obtain stationary closed-form solutions. 2) For swarm-based method, a\nfast-convergent particle swarm optimization and zero forcing (PSO-ZF) algorithm\nis proposed. Specifically, the PA position-seeking particles are constructed to\nexplore high-quality pinching beamforming solutions. Moreover, ZF-based\ntransmit beamforming is utilized by each particle for fast fitness function\nevaluation. Simulation results demonstrate that: i) The proposed NOMA assisted\nPASS and algorithms outperforms the conventional NOMA assisted massive antenna\nsystem. The proposed framework reduces over 95.22% transmit power compared to\nconventional massive MIMO-NOMA systems. ii) Swarm-based optimization\noutperforms gradient-based optimization by searching effective solution\nsubspace to avoid stuck in undesirable local optima.",

This paper proposes a fixed-budget multi-metric\nAED framework with a two-phase structure: an adaptive exploration phase to\nidentify the best treatment, and a validation phase with an A/B test to verify\nthe treatment's quality and infer statistics. We propose SHRVar, which\ngeneralizes sequential halving (SH) (Karnin et al., 2013) with a novel\nrelative-variance-based sampling and an elimination strategy built on reward\nz-values. It achieves a provable error probability that decreases\nexponentially, where the exponent generalizes the complexity measure for SH\n(Karnin et al., 2013) and SHVar (Lalitha et al., 2023) with homogeneous and\nheterogeneous variances, respectively.

Mrk 1018 has undergone two transitions, a brightening event in\nthe 1980s and a transition back to a faint state over the course of 2-3 years\nin the early 2010s. We characterize the evolving physical properties of the\nsource's inner accretion flow, particularly during the bright-to-faint\ntransition, as well as the morphological properties of its parsec-scale\ncircumnuclear gas. We model archival X-ray spectra from XMM-Newton, Chandra,\nSuzaku, and Swift, using physically-motivated models to characterize X-ray\nspectral variations and track Fe Kalpha line flux. We also quantify Mrk 1018's\nlong-term multi-wavelength spectral variability from optical/UV to the X-rays.\nOver the duration of the bright-to-faint transition, the UV and hard X-ray flux\nfell by differing factors, roughly 24 and 8, respectively. The soft X-ray\nexcess faded, and was not detected by 2021. In the faint state, when the\nEddington ratio drops to log Lbol/LEdd < -1.7, the hot X-ray corona photon\nindex shows a 'softer-when-fainter' trend, similar to that seen in some black\nhole X-ray binaries and samples of low-luminosity AGNs. Finally, the Fe Kalpha\nline flux has dropped by only half the factor of the drop in the X-ray\ncontinuum. The transition from the bright state to the faint state is\nconsistent with the inner accretion flow transitioning from a\ngeometrically-thin disk to an ADAF-dominated state, with the warm corona\ndisintegrating or becoming energetically negligible, while the X-ray-emitting\nhot flow becoming energetically dominant. Meanwhile, narrow Fe Kalpha emission\nhas not yet fully responded to the drop in its driving continuum, likely\nbecause its emitter extends up to roughly 10 pc.",

This serves as a direct analog of the quantum Stein's lemma in the\nadversarial channel discrimination. Notably, the optimal error exponent can be\nachieved via simple non-adaptive strategies by the adversary, and its value can\nbe efficiently computed despite its regularization. The strong converse\nproperty for quantum channel discrimination also holds in general. This\nadversarial quantum Stein's lemma is proved by new chain rules for measured and\nsandwiched relative entropies. Moreover, we derive a generalized version of the\nentropy accumulation theorem between two arbitrary sequences of quantum\nchannels, extending the existing results from entropy to divergence and\nproviding a solution to the dual formulation of the open problem presented in\n[IEEE FOCS, pp. 844-850 (2022)].",

    "abstract": "Background: An adaptive intervention (ADI) uses individual information in\norder to select treatment, to improve effectiveness while reducing cost and\nburden. ADIs require tailoring variables: person- and potentially time-specific\ninformation used to decide whether and how to deliver treatment. Specifying a\ntailoring variable for an intervention requires specifying what to measure,\nwhen to measure it, when to make the resulting decisions, and what cutoffs\nshould be used in making those decisions. This involves tradeoffs between\nspecificity versus sensitivity, and between waiting for sufficient information\nversus intervening quickly. These questions are causal and prescriptive (what\nshould be done and when), not merely predictive (what would happen if current\nconditions persist).\n  Purpose: There is little specific guidance in the literature on how to\nempirically choose tailoring variables, including cutoffs, measurement times,\nand decision times. Methods: We review possible approaches for comparing\npotential tailoring variables and propose a framework for systematically\ndeveloping tailoring variables.\n  Results: Although secondary observational data can be used to select\ntailoring variables, additional assumptions are needed. A specifically designed\nrandomized experiment for optimization purposes (an optimization randomized\nclinical trial or ORCT), in the form of a multi-arm randomized trial,\nsequential multiple assignment randomized trial, a factorial experiment, or\nhybrid among them, may provide a more direct way to answer these questions.\n  Conclusions: Using randomization directly to inform tailoring variables would\nprovide the most direct causal evidence, but designing a trial to compare both\ntailoring variables and treatments adds complexity; further methodological\nresearch is warranted.",

Rather than forming a continuous incommensurate\nhelical structure, this material exhibits a mesoscale ordering of ferroelastic\nand polar domains. Across domains, bismuth's polar displacement rotates\ndiscretely following a consistent handedness, giving rise to a mesoscale\nhelical pattern. We observe both right-handed and left-handed chiralities\nassociated with helical ordering.

To bridge this gap, we present\nEDEN, a biologically inspired navigation framework that integrates learned\nentorhinal-like grid cell representations and reinforcement learning to enable\nautonomous navigation. Inspired by the mammalian entorhinal-hippocampal system,\nEDEN allows agents to perform path integration and vector-based navigation\nusing visual and motion sensor data. At the core of EDEN is a grid cell encoder\nthat transforms egocentric motion into periodic spatial codes, producing\nlow-dimensional, interpretable embeddings of position. To generate these\nactivations from raw sensory input, we combine fiducial marker detections in\nthe lightweight MiniWorld simulator and DINO-based visual features in the\nhigh-fidelity Gazebo simulator. These spatial representations serve as input to\na policy trained with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), enabling dynamic,\ngoal-directed navigation. We evaluate EDEN in both MiniWorld, for rapid\nprototyping, and Gazebo, which offers realistic physics and perception noise.\nCompared to baseline agents using raw state inputs (e.g., position, velocity)\nor standard convolutional image encoders, EDEN achieves a 99% success rate,\nwithin the simple scenarios, and >94% within complex floorplans with occluded\npaths with more efficient and reliable step-wise navigation. In addition, as a\nreplacement of ground truth activations, we present a trainable Grid Cell\nencoder enabling the development of periodic grid-like patterns from vision and\nmotion sensor data, emulating the development of such patterns within\nbiological mammals.

    "abstract": "The problem of deciding whether a set of quantum measurements is jointly\nmeasurable is known to be equivalent to determining whether a quantum\nassemblage is unsteerable. This problem can be formulated as a semidefinite\nprogram (SDP). However, the number of variables and constraints in such a\nformulation grows exponentially with the number of measurements, rendering it\nintractable for large measurement sets. In this work, we circumvent this\nproblem by transforming the SDP into a hierarchy of linear programs that\ncompute upper and lower bounds on the incompatibility robustness with a\ncomplexity that grows polynomially in the number of measurements. The hierarchy\nis guaranteed to converge and it can be applied to arbitrary measurements --\nincluding non-projective POVMs -- in arbitrary dimensions. While convergence\nbecomes impractical in high dimensions, in the case of qubits our method\nreliably provides accurate upper and lower bounds for the incompatibility\nrobustness of sets with several hundred measurements in a short time using a\nstandard laptop. We also apply our methods to qutrits, obtaining non-trivial\nupper and lower bounds in scenarios that are otherwise intractable using the\nstandard SDP approach. Finally, we show how our methods can be used to\nconstruct local hidden state models for states, or conversely, to certify that\na given state exhibits steering; for two-qubit quantum states, our approach is\ncomparable to, and in some cases outperforms, the current best methods.",

The commonly used selective\nnumber-dependent arbitrary phase (SNAP) gate faces significant challenges in\nultra-high-coherence cavities, where the weak dispersive shifts necessary for\npreserving high coherence typically result in prolonged gate times. Here, we\npropose a protocol to achieve high-fidelity SNAP gates that are orders of\nmagnitude faster than the standard implementation, surpassing the speed limit\nset by the bare dispersive shift. We achieve this enhancement by dynamically\namplifying the dispersive coupling via sideband interactions, followed by\nquantum optimal control on the Floquet-engineered system. We also present a\nunified perturbation theory that explains both the gate acceleration and the\nassociated benign drive-induced decoherence, corroborated by Floquet-Markov\nsimulations. These results pave the way for the experimental realization of\nhigh-fidelity, selective control of weakly coupled, high-coherence cavities,\nand expanding the scope of optimal control techniques to a broader class of\nFloquet quantum systems.",

This approach preserves high-order\naccuracy of computations near processing element boundaries using\nasynchrony-tolerant (AT) schemes while significantly improving the scalability.\nThe numerical properties of the AT schemes were studied based on simple linear\nand nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) in previous works. Allowing\nasynchrony in numerical schemes can minimize communication overheads in a\nparallel setting in two ways: one that avoids communication over a few\npredetermined time steps, and the other that initiates communications without\nenforcing synchronization. In this study, the asynchronous algorithms are\nincorporated into the high-order compressible flow solver COMP-SQUARE, which\nsolves practically relevant flow problems in complex geometries in a\nmulti-block framework. The numerical efficacy and scalability of the two\nasynchronous algorithms are demonstrated for three test cases: isentropic\nadvection of a vortex, the Taylor-Green vortex, and a much more sensitive case\nof the flow transitioning on a NACA0012 airfoil.

This work focuses on the problem of effectively detecting fairness\nviolations, especially intersectional biases that are often missed by existing\ntemplate-based and grammar-based testing methods. Previous approaches, such as\nCheckList and ASTRAEA, provide structured or grammar-driven test generation but\nstruggle with low test diversity and limited sensitivity to complex demographic\ninteractions.

GenFair improves fairness testing by generating linguistically\ndiverse, realistic, and intersectional test cases. It applies metamorphic\nrelations (MR) to derive follow-up cases and detects fairness violations via\ntone-based comparisons between source and follow-up responses. In experiments\nwith GPT-4.0 and LLaMA-3.0, GenFair outperformed two baseline methods.

    "abstract": "We present cosmological constraints from 8 strongly lensed quasars\n(hereafter, the TDCOSMO-2025 sample). Building on previous work, our analysis\nincorporated new deflector stellar velocity dispersions measured from spectra\nobtained with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), the Keck Telescopes, and\nthe Very Large Telescope (VLT), utilizing improved methods. We used integrated\nJWST stellar kinematics for 5 lenses, VLT-MUSE for 2, and resolved kinematics\nfrom Keck and JWST for RX J1131-1231. We also considered two samples of\nnon-time-delay lenses: 11 from the Sloan Lens ACS (SLACS) sample with Keck-KCWI\nresolved kinematics; and 4 from the Strong Lenses in the Legacy Survey (SL2S)\nsample. We improved our analysis of line-of-sight effects, the surface\nbrightness profile of the lens galaxies, and orbital anisotropy, and corrected\nfor projection effects in the dynamics. Our uncertainties are maximally\nconservative by accounting for the mass-sheet degeneracy in the deflectors'\nmass density profiles. The analysis was blinded to prevent experimenter bias.\nOur primary result is based on the TDCOSMO-2025 sample, in combination with\n$\\Omega_{\\rm m}$ constraints from the Pantheon+ Type Ia supernovae (SN)\ndataset. In the flat $\\Lambda$ Cold Dark Matter (CDM), we find\n$H_0=71.6^{+3.9}_{-3.3}$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. The SLACS and SL2S samples are\nin excellent agreement with the TDCOSMO-2025 sample, improving the precision on\n$H_0$ in flat $\\Lambda$CDM to 4.6%. Using the Dark Energy Survey SN Year-5\ndataset (DES-SN5YR) or DESI-DR2 baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO)\nlikelihoods instead of Pantheon+ yields very similar results. We also present\nconstraints in the open $\\Lambda$CDM, $w$CDM, $w_0w_a$CDM, and $w_{\\phi}$CDM\ncosmologies. The TDCOSMO $H_0$ inference is robust and consistent across all\npresented cosmological models, and our cosmological constraints in them agree\nwith those from the BAO and SN.",

The distal end of the robotic catheter\nconsists of a pneumatic bending actuator for the catheter's deployment in\ntorturous luminal organs and a pneumatic rotatable biopsy mechanism (PRBM). By\nhierarchical airflow control, the PRBM can adjust the biopsy direction under\nlow airflow and deploy the biopsy needle with higher airflow, allowing for\nrapid omnidirectional sampling of tissue in situ. This paper describes the\ndesign, modeling, and characterization of the proposed robotic catheter,\nincluding repeated deployment assessments of the biopsy needle, puncture force\nmeasurement, and validation via phantom tests. The PRBM prototype has six\nsampling directions evenly distributed across 360 degrees when actuated by a\npositive pressure of 0.3 MPa. The pneumatically-driven robotic catheter\nprovides a novel biopsy strategy, potentially facilitating in situ\nmultidirectional biopsies in tortuous luminal organs with minimum invasiveness.",

    "abstract": "The pressure Poisson equation, central to the fractional step method in\nincompressible flow simulations, incurs high computational costs due to the\niterative solution of large-scale linear systems. To address this challenge, we\nintroduce HyDEA, a novel framework that synergizes deep learning with classical\niterative solvers. It leverages the complementary strengths of a DeepONet -\ncapable of capturing large-scale features of the solution - and the CG or a PCG\nmethod, which efficiently resolves fine-scale errors. Specifically, within the\nframework of line-search methods, the DeepONet predicts search directions to\naccelerate convergence in solving sparse, symmetric-positive-definite linear\nsystems, while the CG/ PCG method ensures robustness through iterative\nrefinement. The framework seamlessly extends to flows over solid structures via\nthe decoupled immersed boundary projection method. Crucially, the DeepONet is\ntrained on fabricated linear systems rather than flow specific data, endowing\nit with inherent generalization across geometric complexities and Reynolds\nnumbers without retraining. Benchmarks demonstrate superior efficiency and\naccuracy of HyDEA over the CG/PCG methods for flows with no obstacles, single\nor multiple stationary obstacles, and one moving obstacle - using fixed network\nweights. Remarkably, HyDEA also exhibits super-resolution capability: although\nthe DeepONet is trained on a 128*128 grid for Re=1000, the hybrid solver\ndelivers accurate solutions on a 512*512 grid for Re=10000 via interpolation,\ndespite discretizations mismatch. In contrast, a purely data-driven DeepONet\nfails for complex flows, underscoring the necessity of hybridizing deep\nlearning with iterative methods. Robustness, efficiency, and generalization\nacross geometries, resolutions, and Reynolds numbers of HyDEA highlight its\npotential as a transformative solver for real world fluid dynamics problems.",

In LIM, the galaxy contributions are\nflux-weighted, and for many emission lines (e.g., H$\\alpha$), flux scales with\nSFR. We show that the (ensemble-averaged) large-scale two-halo term of the\npower spectrum depends only on the mean luminosity-halo mass relation if the\nscatter is uncorrelated with halo bias.

In IllustrisTNG,\nthis secondary bias increases the two-halo term by 5 per cent at $z \\sim 1.5$\ncompared to a model with random scatter. We also find that SFRs of central and\nsatellite galaxies are correlated, enhancing the one-halo term -- sensitive to\nintra-halo SFR distribution -- by 10 per cent relative to random pairings. To\nmitigate secondary bias in the two-halo term, we identify halo concentration\n(for haloes with mass $\\log M_h \\lesssim 12$) and satellite mass (for $\\log M_h\n\\gtrsim 12$) as effective secondary parameters.

As such, this is similar to the training process in\nmachine learning and variational quantum simulations can therefore suffer from\nsimilar problems encountered in machine learning training.

In this article, we analyse the imaginary time evolution as a\nmeans of compiling parametric quantum circuits and finding optimal parameters,\nand show that it guarantees convergence to the global minimum without critical\nslowing down. We also show that the compilation process, including the task of\nfinding optimal parameters, can be performed efficiently up to an arbitrary\nerror threshold if the underlying physical system is of bounded order. This\nincludes many relevant computational problems, e.g., local physical theories\nand combinatorial optimisation problems such as the flight-to-gate assignment\nproblem.

Measurements aimed at the\nultimate possible precision are thus performed almost exclusively with\nclassical states and, therefore, are constrained by the standard quantum limit.\nHere, we demonstrate that by using the phenomenon of subharmonic excitation, in\ncombination with a recently demonstrated technique of Raman excitation of a\nharmonic oscillator, the frequency of an electric field can be measured at a\nresolution below the standard quantum limit of the corresponding linear\nmeasurement.

    "abstract": "The assessment of legal problems requires the consideration of a specific\nlegal system and its levels of abstraction, from constitutional law to\nstatutory law to case law. The extent to which Large Language Models (LLMs)\ninternalize such legal systems is unknown. In this paper, we propose and\ninvestigate different approaches to condition LLMs at different levels of\nabstraction in legal systems. This paper examines different approaches to\nconditioning LLMs at multiple levels of abstraction in legal systems to detect\npotentially punishable hate speech. We focus on the task of classifying whether\na specific social media posts falls under the criminal offense of incitement to\nhatred as prescribed by the German Criminal Code. The results show that there\nis still a significant performance gap between models and legal experts in the\nlegal assessment of hate speech, regardless of the level of abstraction with\nwhich the models were conditioned. Our analysis revealed, that models\nconditioned on abstract legal knowledge lacked deep task understanding, often\ncontradicting themselves and hallucinating answers, while models using concrete\nlegal knowledge performed reasonably well in identifying relevant target\ngroups, but struggled with classifying target conducts.",

    "abstract": "The Euclid mission has the potential to understand the fundamental physical\nnature of late-time cosmic acceleration and, as such, of deviations from the\nstandard cosmological model, LCDM. In this paper, we focus on model-independent\nmethods to modify the evolution of scalar perturbations at linear scales. We\nconsider two approaches: the first is based on the two phenomenological\nmodified gravity (PMG) parameters, $\\mu_{\\rm mg}$ and $\\Sigma_{\\rm mg}$, which\nare phenomenologically connected to the clustering of matter and weak lensing,\nrespectively; and the second is the effective field theory (EFT) of dark energy\nand modified gravity, which we use to parameterise the braiding function,\n$\\alpha_{\\rm B}$, which defines the mixing between the metric and the dark\nenergy field. We discuss the predictions from spectroscopic and photometric\nprimary probes by Euclid on the cosmological parameters and a given set of\nadditional parameters featuring the PMG and EFT models. We use the Fisher\nmatrix method applied to spectroscopic galaxy clustering (GCsp), weak lensing\n(WL), photometric galaxy clustering (GCph), and cross-correlation (XC) between\nGCph and WL. For the modelling of photometric predictions on nonlinear scales,\nwe use the halo model to cover two limits for the screening mechanism: the\nunscreened (US) case, for which the screening mechanism is not present; and the\nsuper-screened (SS) case, which assumes strong screening. We also assume scale\ncuts to account for our uncertainties in the modelling of nonlinear\nperturbation evolution. We choose a time-dependent form for $\\{\\mu_{\\rm\nmg},\\Sigma_{\\rm mg}\\}$, with two fiducial sets of values for the corresponding\nmodel parameters at the present time, $\\{\\bar{\\mu}_0,\\bar{\\Sigma}_0\\}$, and two\nforms for $\\alpha_{\\rm B}$, with one fiducial set of values for each of the\nmodel parameters, $\\alpha_{\\rm B,0}$ and $\\{\\alpha_{\\rm B,0},m\\}$.

    "abstract": "Modern AI systems are man-made objects that leverage machine learning to\nsupport our lives across a myriad of contexts and applications. Despite\nextensive epistemological and ethical debates, their metaphysical foundations\nremain relatively under explored. The orthodox view simply suggests that AI\nsystems, as artifacts, lack well-posed identity and persistence conditions --\ntheir metaphysical kinds are no real kinds. In this work, we challenge this\nperspective by introducing a theory of metaphysical identity of AI systems. We\ndo so by characterizing their kinds and introducing identity criteria -- formal\nrules that answer the questions \"When are two AI systems the same?\" and \"When\ndoes an AI system persist, despite change?\" Building on Carrara and Vermaas'\naccount of fine-grained artifact kinds, we argue that AI trustworthiness\nprovides a lens to understand AI system kinds and formalize the identity of\nthese artifacts by relating their functional requirements to their physical\nmake-ups. The identity criteria of AI systems are determined by their\ntrustworthiness profiles -- the collection of capabilities that the systems\nmust uphold over time throughout their artifact histories, and their\neffectiveness in maintaining these capabilities. Our approach suggests that the\nidentity and persistence of AI systems is sensitive to the socio-technical\ncontext of their design and utilization via their trustworthiness, providing a\nsolid metaphysical foundation to the epistemological, ethical, and legal\ndiscussions about these artifacts.",

Our approach organizes information through\na hierarchy of nested sequences, where each level enables a hierarchical\nexpression of the studied property by examining patterns at varying levels of\ngranularity. To illustrate the method, we apply it to prime numbers. While this\ndoes not claim any new breakthroughs on this classical problem, the approach\nallows for analysis of the studied property across large integer sequences and\nreveals characteristics observable at different scales. By limiting ourselves\nto the case of prime numbers, we build sequences with values in {0, ..., 255},\nwhich have the advantage of simplifying the reading, at different scales, of\nthe encoded property. We free ourselves from the numerous digits of large\nintegers by replacing them with small integers between 0 and 255. We have also\nhighlighted, at different scales, histograms composed of at most 256 values. We\nhave observed that for a sufficiently large interval, they all share a same\ninvariant shape, which can be viewed as a characteristic of prime numbers. Each\nvalue in the histogram represents the count of a subset of prime numbers. We\nhave proposed an estimation for each value in the histogram and at all scales.\nWe hope that the proposed framework will be useful for investigating arithmetic\nproperties.",

The singularity represents a\nsignificant challenge for computing the integrals, which is typically overcome\nvia specially designed quadrature methods involving a large number of\nevaluations of the function and kernel. We present an attractive alternative:\nwe show that Newtonian potentials (and their gradient) applied to (tensor\nproducts of) Legendre polynomials can be expressed in terms of complex\nintegrals which satisfy simple and explicit recurrences that can be utilised to\nexactly compute singular integrals, i.e., singular integral quadrature is\ncompletely avoided. The inhomogeneous part of the recurrence has low rank\nstructure (its rank is at most three for the Newtonian potential) and hence\nthese recurrences have displacement structure. Using the recurrence directly is\na fast approach for evaluation on or near the integration domain that remains\naccurate for low degree polynomial approximations, while high-precision\narithmetic allows accurate use of the approach for moderate degree polynomials.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly explored for legal argument\ngeneration, yet they pose significant risks of manipulation through\nhallucination and ungrounded persuasion, and often fail to utilize provided\nfactual bases effectively or abstain when arguments are untenable. This paper\nintroduces a novel reflective multi-agent method designed to address these\nchallenges in the context of legally compliant persuasion. Our approach employs\nspecialized agents--a Factor Analyst and an Argument Polisher--in an iterative\nrefinement process to generate 3-ply legal arguments (plaintiff, defendant,\nrebuttal). We evaluate Reflective Multi-Agent against single-agent,\nenhanced-prompt single-agent, and non-reflective multi-agent baselines using\nfour diverse LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, Llama-4-Maverick-17b-128e,\nLlama-4-Scout-17b-16e) across three legal scenarios: \"arguable\", \"mismatched\",\nand \"non-arguable\". Results demonstrate Reflective Multi-Agent's significant\nsuperiority in successful abstention (preventing generation when arguments\ncannot be grounded), marked improvements in hallucination accuracy (reducing\nfabricated and misattributed factors), particularly in \"non-arguable\"\nscenarios, and enhanced factor utilization recall (improving the use of\nprovided case facts).

    "abstract": "The family of circle maps \\begin{equation*} f_{b, \\omega} (x) = x + \\omega +\nb\\, \\phi(x) \\end{equation*} is used as a simple model for a periodically forced\noscillator. The parameter $\\omega$ represents the unforced frequency, $b$ the\ncoupling, and $\\phi$ the forcing. When $\\phi = \\frac{1}{2 \\pi} \\sin(2 \\pi x)$\nthis is the classical Arnol'd standard family. Such families are often studied\nin the $(\\omega,b)$-plane via the so-called tongues $T_\\beta$ consisting of all\n$(\\omega,b)$ such that $f_{b, \\omega}$ has rotation number $\\beta$. The\ninterior of the rational tongues $T_{p/q}$ represent the system mode-locked\ninto a $p/q$-periodic response. Campbell, Galeeva, Tresser, and Uherka proved\nthat when the forcing is a PL map with $k=2$ breakpoints, all $T_{p/q}$ pinch\ndown to a width of a single point at multple values when $q$ large enough. In\ncontrast, we prove that it generic amongst PL forcings with a given $k\\geq 3$\nbreakpoints that there is no such pinching of any of the rational tongues. We\nalso prove that the absence of pinching is generic for Lipschitz and $C^r$\n($r>0$) forcing.",

    "abstract": "Background: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated substantial\npotential to support clinical practice. Other than Chat GPT4 and its\npredecessors, few LLMs, especially those of the leading and more powerful\nreasoning model class, have been subjected to medical specialty examination\nquestions, including in the domain of primary care. This paper aimed to test\nthe capabilities of leading LLMs as of May 2025 (o3, Claude Opus 4, Grok3, and\nGemini 2.5 Pro) in primary care education, specifically in answering Member of\nthe Royal College of General Practitioners (MRCGP) style examination questions.\n  Methods: o3, Claude Opus 4, Grok3, and Gemini 2.5 Pro were tasked to answer\n100 randomly chosen multiple choice questions from the Royal College of General\nPractitioners GP SelfTest on 25 May 2025. Questions included textual\ninformation, laboratory results, and clinical images. Each model was prompted\nto answer as a GP in the UK and was provided with full question information.\nEach question was attempted once by each model. Responses were scored against\ncorrect answers provided by GP SelfTest.\n  Results: The total score of o3, Claude Opus 4, Grok3, and Gemini 2.5 Pro was\n99.0%, 95.0%, 95.0%, and 95.0%, respectively. The average peer score for the\nsame questions was 73.0%.\n  Discussion: All models performed remarkably well, and all substantially\nexceeded the average performance of GPs and GP registrars who had answered the\nsame questions. o3 demonstrated the best performance, while the performances of\nthe other leading models were comparable with each other and were not\nsubstantially lower than that of o3. These findings strengthen the case for\nLLMs, particularly reasoning models, to support the delivery of primary care,\nespecially those that have been specifically trained on primary care clinical\ndata.",

We propose\na polynomial-time algorithm, Tilted Exponentially Weighted Average with\nSleeping Experts (TEWA-SE), which adapts the sleeping experts framework from\nonline convex optimization to the bandit setting. For strongly convex losses,\nwe prove that TEWA-SE is minimax-optimal with respect to known $S$ and $\\Delta$\nby establishing matching upper and lower bounds. By equipping TEWA-SE with the\nBandit-over-Bandit framework, we extend our analysis to environments with\nunknown non-stationarity measures. For general convex losses, we introduce a\nsecond algorithm, clipped Exploration by Optimization (cExO), based on\nexponential weights over a discretized action space. While not polynomial-time\ncomputable, this method achieves minimax-optimal regret with respect to known\n$S$ and $\\Delta$, and improves on the best existing bounds with respect to $P$.",

In\nthis paper, we present the first publicly available full-duplex spoken dialogue\nmodel in Japanese, which is built upon Moshi, a full-duplex dialogue model in\nEnglish.

In this work, we present a comprehensive study of the\nadversarial vulnerabilities of tabular FM, focusing on both their fragility to\ntargeted test-time attacks and their potential misuse as adversarial tools. We\nshow on three benchmarks in finance, cybersecurity and healthcare, that small,\nstructured perturbations to test inputs can significantly degrade prediction\naccuracy, even when training context remain fixed. Additionally, we demonstrate\nthat tabular FM can be repurposed to generate transferable evasion to\nconventional models such as random forests and XGBoost, and on a lesser extent\nto deep tabular models. To improve tabular FM, we formulate the robustification\nproblem as an optimization of the weights (adversarial fine-tuning), or the\ncontext (adversarial in-context learning). We introduce an in-context\nadversarial training strategy that incrementally replaces the context with\nadversarial perturbed instances, without updating model weights. Our approach\nimproves robustness across multiple tabular benchmarks. Together, these\nfindings position tabular FM as both a target and a source of adversarial\nthreats, highlighting the urgent need for robust training and evaluation\npractices in this emerging paradigm.",

Existing approaches, such as retrieval-based and\ninference-time correction methods, primarily address this issue at the input or\noutput level, often overlooking the intrinsic information refinement process\nand the role of premature layers. Meanwhile, alignment- and fine-tuning-based\nmethods are resource-intensive. In this paper, we propose PLI (Premature Layers\nInterpolation), a novel, training-free, and plug-and-play intervention designed\nto enhance factuality. PLI mitigates hallucinations by inserting premature\nlayers formed through mathematical interpolation with adjacent layers. Inspired\nby stable diffusion and sampling steps, PLI extends the depth of information\nprocessing and transmission in LLMs, improving factual coherence. Experiments\non four publicly available datasets demonstrate that PLI effectively reduces\nhallucinations while outperforming existing baselines in most cases. Further\nanalysis suggests that the success of layer interpolation is closely linked to\nLLMs' internal mechanisms. To promote reproducibility, we will release our code\nand data upon acceptance.",

    "abstract": "Privacy-preserving distributed machine learning (ML) and aerial connected\nvehicle (ACV)-assisted edge computing have drawn significant attention lately.\nSince the onboard sensors of ACVs can capture new data as they move along their\ntrajectories, the continual arrival of such 'newly' sensed data leads to online\nlearning and demands carefully crafting the trajectories. Besides, as typical\nACVs are inherently resource-constrained, computation- and\ncommunication-efficient ML solutions are needed. Therefore, we propose a\ncomputation- and communication-efficient online aerial federated learning\n(2CEOAFL) algorithm to take the benefits of continual sensed data and limited\nonboard resources of the ACVs. In particular, considering independently owned\nACVs act as selfish data collectors, we first model their trajectories\naccording to their respective time-varying data distributions. We then propose\na 2CEOAFL algorithm that allows the flying ACVs to (a) prune the received dense\nML model to make it shallow, (b) train the pruned model, and (c)\nprobabilistically quantize and offload their trained accumulated gradients to\nthe central server (CS). Our extensive simulation results show that the\nproposed 2CEOAFL algorithm delivers comparable performances to its non-pruned\nand nonquantized, hence, computation- and communication-inefficient\ncounterparts.",

    "abstract": "In recent decades, the structure of the mod-2 cohomology of the Steenrod ring\n$\\mathscr A$ has become a major subject of study in the field of Algebraic\nTopology. One of the earliest attempts to study this cohomology through the use\nof modular representations of the general linear groups was the groundbreaking\nwork [Math. Z. 202 (1989), 493-523] by W.M. Singer. In that work, Singer\nintroduced a homomorphism, commonly referred to as the \"algebraic transfer,\"\nwhich maps from the coinvariants of a certain representation of the general\nlinear group to the mod-2 cohomology group of the ring $\\mathscr A.$ Singer's\nconjecture, in particular, which states that the algebraic transfer is a\nmonomorphism for all homological degrees, remains a highly significant and\nunresolved problem in Algebraic Topology. In this research, we take a major\nstride toward resolving the Singer conjecture by establishing its truth for the\nhomological degree four.",

    "abstract": "We consider Lindbladian operator dynamics in many-body quantum systems with\none or more integrals of motion (IOM), subject to weak local dissipation. We\ndemonstrate that IOMs with small support become slow modes of these dynamics,\nin the sense that their Frobenius norm decays more slowly compared to generic\noperators. As a result, the eigenoperators of such Lindbladians with slowest\ndecay rates have a large overlap with the IOMs of the underlying Hamiltonian.\nWe demonstrate this correspondence between slow modes and IOMs numerically for\na number of many-body models, and further corroborate it with perturbative\narguments. These results open up a new method for the identification of IOMs,\nand provide insights into the dissipative many-body dynamics.",

Cooperation, requiring a personal cost for collective benefits, is\nwidespread in nature and human society, having been explained through\nmechanisms such as kin selection, direct and indirect reciprocity, and network\nreciprocity. Institutional incentives, which reward cooperation and punish\nanti-social behaviour, offer a promising approach to fostering cooperation in\ngroups of self-interested individuals. Focusing on general $2\\times2$ games and\nthe collective risk game (which is a fundamental model for climate action), we\nanalyse the associated cost of providing incentives under evolutionary dynamics\ngoverned by Fermi's rule, exploring the asymptotic behaviour of the incentive\ncost functons in the limits of neutral drift and strong selection.

Effective federated\nrepresentations require features that are jointly informative across clients\nwhile disentangling domain-specific factors without supervision. We introduce\nFORLA, a novel framework for federated object-centric representation learning\nand feature adaptation across clients using unsupervised slot attention. At the\ncore of our method is a shared feature adapter, trained collaboratively across\nclients to adapt features from foundation models, and a shared slot attention\nmodule that learns to reconstruct the adapted features. To optimize this\nadapter, we design a two-branch student-teacher architecture. In each client, a\nstudent decoder learns to reconstruct full features from foundation models,\nwhile a teacher decoder reconstructs their adapted, low-dimensional\ncounterpart. The shared slot attention module bridges cross-domain learning by\naligning object-level representations across clients. Experiments in multiple\nreal-world datasets show that our framework not only outperforms centralized\nbaselines on object discovery but also learns a compact, universal\nrepresentation that generalizes well across domains. This work highlights\nfederated slot attention as an effective tool for scalable, unsupervised visual\nrepresentation learning from cross-domain data with distributed concepts.",

Investigating continuous\ndifferential equations has been a promising approach for studying the discrete\noptimization methods. Despite the crucial role of momentum in gradient-based\noptimization methods, the gap between the original discrete dynamics and the\ncontinuous time approximations due to the discretization error has not been\ncomprehensively bridged yet. In this work, we study the HB momentum method in\ncontinuous time while putting more focus on the discretization error to provide\nadditional theoretical tools to this area. In particular, we design a\nfirst-order piece-wise continuous differential equation, where we add a number\nof counter terms to account for the discretization error explicitly. As a\nresult, we provide a continuous time model for the HB momentum method that\nallows the control of discretization error to arbitrary order of the step size.\nAs an application, we leverage it to find a new implicit regularization of the\ndirectional smoothness and investigate the implicit bias of HB for diagonal\nlinear networks, indicating how our results can be used in deep learning. Our\ntheoretical findings are further supported by numerical experiments.",

IASC is one of the leading contributors to the detection of various\nNear-Earth Objects and Main Belt asteroids. Using Astrometrica software we\nanalysed those images and extracted their key parameters such as\nsignal-to-noise ratio, right ascension, declination, flux, FWHM, RMS, and\nmagnitude. Later, we analysed its trajectory, apparent angular speed, and error\nanalyses using python and its libraries. In the end, we concluded that ISP0010\nwould be a potential candidate for an asteroid. However, on cross-verifying\nwith the Minor Planet Centre database, we found that ISP0010 was already\nreported on February 27, 2021, and a total of 25 observations has been reported\nup to the date and currently the object has been designated as 2021 CP66. Our\ndate of observation of 2021 CP66 was February 27, 2025. This study thus\nprovides an independent confirmation and characterization of 2021 CP66,\ndemonstrating the accuracy of our analysis and underscoring the importance of\nthorough database verification in asteroid detection.",

    "abstract": "Knowledge Tracing (KT) involves monitoring the changes in a student's\nknowledge over time by analyzing their past responses, with the goal of\npredicting future performance. However, most existing methods primarily focus\non feature enhancement, while overlooking the deficiencies in cognitive\nrepresentation and the ability to express cognition-issues often caused by\ninterference from non-cognitive factors such as slipping and guessing. This\nlimitation hampers the ability to capture the continuity and coherence of the\nstudent's cognitive process. As a result, many methods may introduce more\nprediction bias and modeling costs due to their inability to maintain cognitive\ncontinuity and coherence. Based on the above discussion, we propose the\nCognitive Representation Dynamic Programming based Knowledge Tracing (CRDP-KT)\nmodel. This model em ploys a dynamic programming algorithm to optimize\ncognitive representations based on the difficulty of the questions and the\nperformance intervals between them. This approach ensures that the cognitive\nrepresentation aligns with the student's cognitive patterns, maintaining\noverall continuity and coherence. As a result, it provides more accurate and\nsystematic input features for subsequent model training, thereby minimizing\ndistortion in the simulation of cognitive states. Additionally, the CRDP-KT\nmodel performs partitioned optimization of cognitive representations to enhance\nthe reliability of the optimization process. Furthermore, it improves its\nability to express the student's cognition through a weighted fusion of\noptimized record representations and re lationships learned from a bipartite\ngraph.

    "abstract": "Wave kinetic theory has been suggested as a way to understand the longtime\nstatistical behavior of the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou (FPUT) system, with the\naim of determining the thermalization time scale. The latter has been a major\nproblem since the model was introduced in the 1950s. In this thesis we\nestablish the wave kinetic equation for a reduced evolution equation obtained\nfrom the $\\beta$-FPUT system by removing the non-resonant terms. We work in the\nkinetic limit $N\\to \\infty$ and $\\beta\\to 0$ under the scaling laws\n$\\beta=N^{-\\gamma}$ with $0<\\gamma<1$. The result holds up to the sub-kinetic\ntime scale\n$T=N^{-\\epsilon}\\min\\bigl(N,N^{5\\gamma/4}\\bigr)=N^{-\\epsilon}T_{\\mathrm{kin}}^{5/8}$\nfor $\\epsilon\\ll 1$, where $T_{\\mathrm{kin}}$ represents the kinetic\n(thermalization) timescale. The novelties of this work include the treatment of\nnon-polynomial dispersion relations, and the introduction of a robust phase\nrenormalization argument to cancel dangerous divergent interactions.",

The thermodynamic description of this\nstate of matter requires the introduction of an inverse temperature $\\beta$\ninversely proportional to $U(N)$ that supplants the standard temperature in\nevery thermodynamic relation inside the core, driving both the energy density\nand the pressure negative. The different states of the core, correspondingly,\ncan be parametrized by an additional parameter, which is a mean occupation\nnumber $\\eta$ of the quasiparticles in the core.

However, because\ntactile sensing is inherently local, it is not well-suited for tasks that\nrequire broad spatial awareness or global scene understanding on its own. A\nhuman-inspired strategy to address this issue is to consider active perception\ntechniques instead. That is, to actively guide sensors toward regions with more\ninformative or significant features and integrate such information over time in\norder to understand a scene or complete a task. Both active perception and\ndifferent methods for tactile sensing have received significant attention\nrecently. Yet, despite advancements, both fields lack standardized benchmarks.\nTo bridge this gap, we introduce the Tactile MNIST Benchmark Suite, an\nopen-source, Gymnasium-compatible benchmark specifically designed for active\ntactile perception tasks, including localization, classification, and volume\nestimation. Our benchmark suite offers diverse simulation scenarios, from\nsimple toy environments all the way to complex tactile perception tasks using\nvision-based tactile sensors. Furthermore, we also offer a comprehensive\ndataset comprising 13,500 synthetic 3D MNIST digit models and 153,600\nreal-world tactile samples collected from 600 3D printed digits.

While prior work has\nlargely focused on learning UDFs from point clouds or multi-view images,\nextracting meshes from UDFs remains challenging, as the learned fields rarely\nattain exact zero distances. A common workaround is to reconstruct signed\ndistance fields (SDFs) locally from UDFs to enable surface extraction via\nMarching Cubes. However, this often introduces topological artifacts such as\nholes or spurious components. Moreover, local SDFs are inherently incapable of\nrepresenting non-manifold geometry, leading to complete failure in such cases.\nTo address this gap, we propose MIND (Material Interface from Non-manifold\nDistance fields), a novel algorithm for generating material interfaces directly\nfrom UDFs, enabling non-manifold mesh extraction from a global perspective. The\ncore of our method lies in deriving a meaningful spatial partitioning from the\nUDF, where the target surface emerges as the interface between distinct\nregions. We begin by computing a two-signed local field to distinguish the two\nsides of manifold patches, and then extend this to a multi-labeled global field\ncapable of separating all sides of a non-manifold structure. By combining this\nmulti-labeled field with the input UDF, we construct material interfaces that\nsupport non-manifold mesh extraction via a multi-labeled Marching Cubes\nalgorithm.

Its development, from early\nmainframes to modern domain-specific architectures, has been driven by rising\ncomputational demands and advancements in semiconductor technology. However,\ntraditional paradigms in computer system architecture design are confronting\nsignificant challenges, including a reliance on manual expertise, fragmented\noptimization across software and hardware layers, and high costs associated\nwith exploring expansive design spaces. While automated methods leveraging\noptimization algorithms and machine learning have improved efficiency, they\nremain constrained by a single-stage focus, limited data availability, and a\nlack of comprehensive human domain knowledge. The emergence of large language\nmodels offers transformative opportunities for the design of computer system\narchitecture. By leveraging the capabilities of LLMs in areas such as code\ngeneration, data analysis, and performance modeling, the traditional manual\ndesign process can be transitioned to a machine-based automated design\napproach. To harness this potential, we present the Large Processor Chip Model\n(LPCM), an LLM-driven framework aimed at achieving end-to-end automated\ncomputer architecture design.

Its unique\nand complex glitch phenomenology provides an unparalleled testing ground for\ntheoretical models of neutron star interior dynamics. Within the self-organized\ncriticality paradigm, Crab pulsar glitch sizes are modeled by a power-law\ndistribution and waiting times by an exponential distribution. However, this\nframework is incompatible with neutron-star microphysics and fails to account\nfor the quasi-periodic glitch behavior. Using a glitch-clustering perspective,\nwhich is motivated by the hypothesis that each event releases only a fraction\nof the stored angular momentum, we merged small glitches occurring within short\ntemporal separations. We reveal a correlation between glitch size and waiting\ntime and uncover that the waiting-time cumulative distribution function follows\na normal distribution. Crucially, without recourse to complex statistical\nmodels, this approach permits a reasonable forecast of the next glitch. From\nthe perspective of the dense-glitch region, the Crab pulsar currently falls\nwithin the $3\\sigma$-$4\\sigma$ probability interval. For the existence of a\nlong-term periodicity of 6.68 years, the $\\pm1\\sigma$ interval defines a time\nwindow extending from the present to approximately 387 days ahead, this implies\nthe next glith would emerge at any time before MJD 61081 (February 2026).",

This study introduces $\\textbf{LongBioBench}$, a\nnovel benchmark that utilizes artificially generated biographies as a\ncontrolled environment for assessing LCLMs across dimensions of\n$\\textit{understanding}$, $\\textit{reasoning}$, and $\\textit{trustworthiness}$.\nOur experimental evaluation, which includes $\\textbf{18}$ LCLMs in total,\ndemonstrates that most models still exhibit deficiencies in semantic\nunderstanding and elementary reasoning over retrieved results and are less\ntrustworthy as context length increases. Our further analysis indicates some\ndesign choices employed by existing synthetic benchmarks, such as contextual\nnon-coherence, numerical needles, and the absence of distractors, rendering\nthem vulnerable to test the model long-context capabilities. Moreover, we also\nreveal that long-context continual pretraining primarily adjusts RoPE embedding\nto accommodate extended context lengths. To sum up, compared to previous\nsynthetic benchmarks, LongBioBench achieves a better trade-off between\nmirroring authentic language tasks and maintaining controllability, and is\nhighly interpretable and configurable.",

This is\noften a laborious, tedious, and costly process. To study methods for\nfacilitating data annotation, we introduce a new benchmark AnnoGuide:\nAuto-Annotation from Annotation Guidelines. It aims to evaluate automated\nmethods for data annotation directly from expert-defined annotation guidelines,\neliminating the need for manual labeling. As a case study, we repurpose the\nwell-established nuScenes dataset, commonly used in autonomous driving\nresearch, which provides comprehensive annotation guidelines for labeling LiDAR\npoint clouds with 3D cuboids across 18 object classes. These guidelines include\na few visual examples and textual descriptions, but no labeled 3D cuboids in\nLiDAR data, making this a novel task of multi-modal few-shot 3D detection\nwithout 3D annotations. The advances of powerful foundation models (FMs) make\nAnnoGuide especially timely, as FMs offer promising tools to tackle its\nchallenges. We employ a conceptually straightforward pipeline that (1) utilizes\nopen-source FMs for object detection and segmentation in RGB images, (2)\nprojects 2D detections into 3D using known camera poses, and (3) clusters LiDAR\npoints within the frustum of each 2D detection to generate a 3D cuboid.\nStarting with a non-learned solution that leverages off-the-shelf FMs, we\nprogressively refine key components and achieve significant performance\nimprovements, boosting 3D detection mAP from 12.1 to 21.9!

Our results reveal that, for atomic systems, the NHH\napproach alone may be insufficient to fully capture the system's spectral\nproperties. While NHHs can yield accurate predictions in certain regimes, a\ncomprehensive description typically requires the Liouvillian formalism, which\ngoverns the Lindblad master equation and explicitly incorporates quantum jump\nprocesses responsible for repopulation dynamics. We demonstrate that the\ninclusion of quantum jumps fundamentally alters the spectral structure of the\nsystem. In particular, we present examples in which the existence, location in\nparameter space, or even the order of spectral degeneracies differ\nsignificantly between the two approaches, thereby highlighting the impact of\nquantum jumps and the limitations of the NHH method. Finally, using the\nhybrid-Liouvillian formalism, we show how quantum jumps reshape spectral\nfeatures initially predicted by the NHH, ultimately determining the full\nLiouvillian spectrum.",

    "abstract": "The universe is not locally realistic. Abandoning causality often appears\nmore palatable than giving up on realism. This paper proposes two novel\nexperimental setups to test realism's failure using the conservation of\nelectric charge. The first employs weak measurements of charge density in a\ndouble-slit interference setup. The second uses entangled charged particles in\na Bell-type experiment, measuring electric field correlations to detect\nnon-local charge distribution. Both leverage charge conservation to explore\nwhether charge location remains indefinite until measured. These experiments\noffer a new perspective on quantum foundations, using charge as a probe to\nquestion whether the universe assigns definite properties only upon\nobservation. A discussion on why charge is more appropriate for such\nexperiments than mass is also present.",

We report sub-percent residual, systematic spectral\ndifferences between the two classes of stars, and show that these residuals are\nsignificant compared to a reference sample of RC$-$RC and RGB$-$RGB pairs\nselected using the same criteria. First, we report systematic differences in\nthe Swan ($\\rm{C}_2$) band and CN bands caused by stellar evolution and a\ndifference in mass, where RGB stars at similar stellar parameters have higher\nmasses than RC stars. Secondly, we observe systematic differences in the\nline-width of the H$_{\\alpha}$ and H$_{\\beta}$ lines caused by a difference in\nmicroturbulence, as measured by GALAH, where we measure higher microturbulence\nin RC stars than RGB stars.

However, detailed investigations to uncover the subtle ways in\nwhich stellar magnetic storms impact exoplanets are still at a nascent stage.\nHere we utilize 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulations to investigate the impact of\nstellar CMEs on Earth-like planets with different magnetic fields. Our results\nshow that planetary atmospheric mass loss rates are dependent on the relative\norientation of stellar wind and planetary magnetic fields, with significantly\nhigher losses when the CME and planetary magnetic fields are oppositely\noriented -- favoring enhanced magnetic reconnections. In contrast, for\nunmagnetised planets, the mass loss rate do not strongly depend on stellar\nmagnetic field orientation. More significantly, we find that stellar CME\ninduced polarity reversals can distinguish between planets with and without\nintrinsic magnetism. In unmagnetised or weakly magnetised (exo)planets, the\npolarity of the externally imposed magnetosphere are prone to global polarity\nreversals forced by stellar magnetised storms. Our analysis of the magnetotail\ncurrent density dynamics during polarity reversals aligns with observations of\nVenus.

This paper proposes a method to\nrealize state estimation of dump truck position, orientation and articulation\nangle using multiple GNSS for automatic operation of dump trucks. RTK-GNSS is\ncommonly used for automation of construction equipment, but in mountainous\nareas, mobile networks often unstable, and RTK-GNSS using GNSS reference\nstations cannot be used. Therefore, this paper develops a state estimation\nmethod for dump trucks that does not require a GNSS reference station by using\nthe Centimeter Level Augmentation Service (CLAS) of the Japanese Quasi-Zenith\nSatellite System (QZSS). Although CLAS is capable of centimeter-level position\nestimation, its positioning accuracy and ambiguity fix rate are lower than\nthose of RTK-GNSS. To solve this problem, we construct a state estimation\nmethod by factor graph optimization that combines CLAS positioning and\nmoving-base RTK-GNSS between multiple GNSS antennas. Evaluation tests under\nreal-world environments have shown that the proposed method can estimate the\nstate of dump trucks with the same accuracy as conventional RTK-GNSS, but does\nnot require a GNSS reference station.",

We explore the\nvariations in these quantities based on stellar age within the bulge and\ncompare these results with the Milky Way's bulge using data from APOGEE DR16\nand {\\it Gaia} DR3. We first explore the variation of the model's velocity\nellipses in galactocentric velocities, $v_R$ and $v_\\phi$, for two bulge\npopulations, a (relatively) young one and an old one. The bar imprints\nquadrupoles on the distribution of ellipse properties, which are stronger in\nthe young population, as expected from their stronger bar. The quadrupoles are\ndistorted if we use heliocentric velocities $v_r$ and $v_l$. We then project\nthese kinematics along the line of sight onto the $(l,b)$-plane. Along the\nminor axis $\\beta_{rl}$ changes from positive at low $|b|$ to negative at large\n$|b|$, crossing over at lower $|b|$ in the young stars. Consequently the vertex\ndeviation peaks at lower $|b|$ in the young population, but reaches similar\npeak values in the old. The $\\rho_{rl}$ is much stronger in the young stars,\nand traces the bar strength. The APOGEE stars split by the median [Fe/H] follow\nthe same trends.

The nonlinear generalized ODEs are formulated as $$\n\\frac{dz}{d\\tau}=D[\\Lambda(t)z+F(z,t)], $$ where $\\Lambda(t)$ is a bounded\nlinear operator on a Banach space $\\mathscr{Z}$ and $F(z,t)$ is a nonlinear\nKurzweil integrable function on $\\mathscr{Z}$. The letter $D$ represents that\ngeneralized ODEs are defined via its solution, and $\\frac{dz}{d\\tau}$ only a\nnotation. Hence, generalized ODEs are fundamentally a notational representation\nof a class of integral equations. Due to the differences between the theory of\ngeneralized ODEs and ODEs, it is difficult to extended the stable manifold\ntheorem of ODEs to generalized ODEs. In order to overcome the difficulty, we\nestablish a generalized Lyapunov-Perron equation in the frame of Kurzweil\nintegral theory.

    "abstract": "Persuasion is a powerful capability of large language models (LLMs) that both\nenables beneficial applications (e.g. helping people quit smoking) and raises\nsignificant risks (e.g. large-scale, targeted political manipulation). Prior\nwork has found models possess a significant and growing persuasive capability,\nmeasured by belief changes in simulated or real users. However, these\nbenchmarks overlook a crucial risk factor: the propensity of a model to attempt\nto persuade in harmful contexts. Understanding whether a model will blindly\n``follow orders'' to persuade on harmful topics (e.g. glorifying joining a\nterrorist group) is key to understanding the efficacy of safety guardrails.\nMoreover, understanding if and when a model will engage in persuasive behavior\nin pursuit of some goal is essential to understanding the risks from agentic AI\nsystems. We propose the Attempt to Persuade Eval (APE) benchmark, that shifts\nthe focus from persuasion success to persuasion attempts, operationalized as a\nmodel's willingness to generate content aimed at shaping beliefs or behavior.\nOur evaluation framework probes frontier LLMs using a multi-turn conversational\nsetup between simulated persuader and persuadee agents. APE explores a diverse\nspectrum of topics including conspiracies, controversial issues, and\nnon-controversially harmful content. We introduce an automated evaluator model\nto identify willingness to persuade and measure the frequency and context of\npersuasive attempts. We find that many open and closed-weight models are\nfrequently willing to attempt persuasion on harmful topics and that\njailbreaking can increase willingness to engage in such behavior. Our results\nhighlight gaps in current safety guardrails and underscore the importance of\nevaluating willingness to persuade as a key dimension of LLM risk.

Handling petabyte-scale image data requires\nhigh-performance computing and robust feature detection models. While\nconvolutional neural network (CNN)-based deep learning approaches are widely\nused for remote sensing (RS),similar to the success in transformer based large\nlanguage models, Vision Transformers (ViTs) offer advantages in capturing\nlong-range dependencies and global context via attention mechanisms. ViTs\nsupport pretraining via self-supervised learning-addressing the common\nlimitation of labeled data in Arctic feature detection and outperform CNNs on\nbenchmark datasets. Arctic also poses challenges for model generalization,\nespecially when features with the same semantic class exhibit diverse spectral\ncharacteristics. To address these issues for Arctic feature detection, we\nintegrate geospatial location embeddings into ViTs to improve adaptation across\nregions. This work investigates: (1) the suitability of pre-trained ViTs as\nfeature extractors for high-resolution Arctic remote sensing tasks, and (2) the\nbenefit of combining image and location embeddings. Using previously published\ndatasets for Arctic feature detection, we evaluate our models on three\ntasks-detecting ice-wedge polygons (IWP), retrogressive thaw slumps (RTS), and\nhuman-built infrastructure. We empirically explore multiple configurations to\nfuse image embeddings and location embeddings. Results show that ViTs with\nlocation embeddings outperform prior CNN-based models on two of the three tasks\nincluding F1 score increase from 0.84 to 0.92 for RTS detection, demonstrating\nthe potential of transformer-based models with spatial awareness for Arctic RS\napplications.",

We theoretically analyze such phenomenon and show that\nas MI increases, the probability of model's prediction error decreases.\nFurthermore, these MI peaks often correspond to tokens expressing reflection or\ntransition, such as ``Hmm'', ``Wait'' and ``Therefore,'' which we term as the\nthinking tokens. We then demonstrate that these thinking tokens are crucial for\nLRM's reasoning performance, while other tokens has minimal impacts. Building\non these analyses, we propose two simple yet effective methods to improve LRM's\nreasoning performance, by delicately leveraging these thinking tokens. Overall,\nour work provides novel insights into the reasoning mechanisms of LRMs and\noffers practical ways to improve their reasoning capabilities.

    "abstract": "Visual Object Tracking (VOT) is a fundamental task with widespread\napplications in autonomous navigation, surveillance, and maritime robotics.\nDespite significant advances in generic object tracking, maritime environments\ncontinue to present unique challenges, including specular water reflections,\nlow-contrast targets, dynamically changing backgrounds, and frequent\nocclusions. These complexities significantly degrade the performance of\nstate-of-the-art tracking algorithms, highlighting the need for domain-specific\ndatasets. To address this gap, we introduce the Maritime Visual Tracking\nDataset (MVTD), a comprehensive and publicly available benchmark specifically\ndesigned for maritime VOT. MVTD comprises 182 high-resolution video sequences,\ntotaling approximately 150,000 frames, and includes four representative object\nclasses: boat, ship, sailboat, and unmanned surface vehicle (USV). The dataset\ncaptures a diverse range of operational conditions and maritime scenarios,\nreflecting the real-world complexities of maritime environments. We evaluated\n14 recent SOTA tracking algorithms on the MVTD benchmark and observed\nsubstantial performance degradation compared to their performance on\ngeneral-purpose datasets. However, when fine-tuned on MVTD, these models\ndemonstrate significant performance gains, underscoring the effectiveness of\ndomain adaptation and the importance of transfer learning in specialized\ntracking contexts. The MVTD dataset fills a critical gap in the visual tracking\ncommunity by providing a realistic and challenging benchmark for maritime\nscenarios.

To address\nthis issue, we propose Beta Normalization Policy Optimization (BNPO), a novel\npolicy optimization method that adaptively normalizes rewards using a Beta\ndistribution with dynamically updated parameters.

We\nprovide theoretical analysis demonstrating BNPO's variance-reducing properties\nand show that it generalizes both REINFORCE and GRPO under binary-valued reward\nsettings.

Usually, action coordination is\nrepresented as a long-range dependence among body parts. However, there are two\nmain challenges in modeling long-range dependencies. First, joints should not\nonly be constrained by other individual joints but also be modulated by the\nbody parts. Second, existing methods make networks deeper to learn dependencies\nbetween non-linked parts. They introduce uncorrelated noise and increase the\nmodel size. In this paper, we utilize a pyramid structure to better learn\npotential long-range dependencies. It can capture the correlation across joints\nand groups, which complements the context of the human sub-structure.

Although Vision\nTransformer (ViT) has shown superior capability in many vision tasks, its\ntransferability against huge domain gaps in CDFSL is still under-explored. In\nthis paper, we find an intriguing phenomenon: during the source-domain\ntraining, prompt tuning, as a common way to train ViT, could be harmful for the\ngeneralization of ViT in target domains, but setting them to random noises\n(i.e., random registers) could consistently improve target-domain performance.\nWe then delve into this phenomenon for an interpretation.

In contrast, random registers are essentially a novel way of\nperturbing attention for the sharpness-aware minimization, which helps the\nmodel find a flattened minimum in loss landscapes, increasing the\ntransferability. Based on this phenomenon and interpretation, we further\npropose a simple but effective approach for CDFSL to enhance the perturbation\non attention maps by adding random registers on the semantic regions of image\ntokens, improving the effectiveness and efficiency of random registers.\nExtensive experiments on four benchmarks validate our rationale and\nstate-of-the-art performance.

    "abstract": "Economic inequality is a global challenge, intensifying disparities in\neducation, healthcare, and social stability. Traditional systems like the U.S.\nfederal income tax reduce inequality but lack adaptability. Although models\nlike the Saez Optimal Taxation adjust dynamically, they fail to address\ntaxpayer heterogeneity and irrational behavior. This study introduces TaxAgent,\na novel integration of large language models (LLMs) with agent-based modeling\n(ABM) to design adaptive tax policies. In our macroeconomic simulation,\nheterogeneous H-Agents (households) simulate real-world taxpayer behaviors\nwhile the TaxAgent (government) utilizes LLMs to iteratively optimize tax\nrates, balancing equity and productivity. Benchmarked against Saez Optimal\nTaxation, U.S. federal income taxes, and free markets, TaxAgent achieves\nsuperior equity-efficiency trade-offs. This research offers a novel taxation\nsolution and a scalable, data-driven framework for fiscal policy evaluation.",

    "abstract": "Battery energy storage systems BESSs can provide fast frequency reserves and\nenergy arbitrage in Nordic electricity markets but their limited energy\ncapacity requires accurate revenue forecasts and coordinated bidding across\nmultiple submarkets. This paper introduces a unified framework that employs\ngeneralized additive models GAMs to generate one week ahead forecasts of spot\nand FCRN revenues in Denmark, Finland, and Norway using three years of hourly\nprice and volume data. Forecast outputs feed a stochastic mixed integer\noptimizer that co-optimizes BESS participation in FCRN, FCRD, spot markets,\nsubject to state of charge constraints, inverter losses, and differing pay as\nbid and pay as clear rules. Comparative analyses evaluate forecast accuracy and\nquantify the impact of forecast errors on BESS bid acceptance, market\nselection, and profitability under realistic seasonal price patterns. Results\ndemonstrate that spot markets exhibit consistently higher predictability than\nfrequency markets, and that forecast errors modestly affect bid acceptance but\ndo not alter overall market participation. The proposed approach provides BESS\noperators and investors with a tool to assess revenue uncertainty and optimize\nmulti market strategies in Nordic power systems.",

    "abstract": "Functional principal component analysis (FPCA) is a widely used technique in\nfunctional data analysis for identifying the primary sources of variation in a\nsample of random curves. The eigenfunctions obtained from standard FPCA\ntypically have non-zero support across the entire domain. In applications,\nhowever, it is often desirable to analyze eigenfunctions that are non-zero only\non specific portions of the original domain-and exhibit zero regions when\nlittle is contributed to a specific direction of variability-allowing for\neasier interpretability. Our method identifies sparse characteristics of the\nunderlying stochastic process and derives localized eigenfunctions by mirroring\nthese characteristics without explicitly enforcing sparsity. Specifically, we\ndecompose the stochastic process into uncorrelated sub-processes, each\nsupported on disjoint intervals. Applying FPCA to these sub-processes yields\nlocalized eigenfunctions that are naturally orthogonal. In contrast, approaches\nthat enforce localization through penalization must additionally impose\northogonality. Moreover, these approaches can suffer from over-regularization,\nresulting in eigenfunctions and eigenvalues that deviate from the inherent\nstructure of their population counterparts, potentially misrepresenting data\ncharacteristics. Our approach avoids these issues by preserving the inherent\nstructure of the data. Moreover, since the sub-processes have disjoint\nsupports, the eigenvalues associated to the localized eigenfunctions allow for\nassessing the importance of each sub-processes in terms of its contribution to\nthe total explained variance. We illustrate the effectiveness of our method\nthrough simulations and real data applications. Supplementary material for this\narticle is available online.",

    "abstract": "High-speed legged navigation in discrete and geometrically complex\nenvironments is a challenging task because of the high-degree-of-freedom\ndynamics and long-horizon, nonconvex nature of the optimization problem. In\nthis work, we propose a hierarchical navigation pipeline for legged robots that\ncan traverse such environments at high speed. The proposed pipeline consists of\na planner and tracker module. The planner module finds physically feasible\nfoothold plans by sampling-based optimization with fast sequential filtering\nusing heuristics and a neural network. Subsequently, rollouts are performed in\na physics simulation to identify the best foothold plan regarding the\nengineered cost function and to confirm its physical consistency. This\nhierarchical planning module is computationally efficient and physically\naccurate at the same time. The tracker aims to accurately step on the target\nfootholds from the planning module. During the training stage, the foothold\ntarget distribution is given by a generative model that is trained\ncompetitively with the tracker. This process ensures that the tracker is\ntrained in an environment with the desired difficulty. The resulting tracker\ncan overcome terrains that are more difficult than what the previous methods\ncould manage. We demonstrated our approach using Raibo, our in-house dynamic\nquadruped robot. The results were dynamic and agile motions: Raibo is capable\nof running on vertical walls, jumping a 1.3-meter gap, running over stepping\nstones at 4 meters per second, and autonomously navigating on terrains full of\n30{\\deg} ramps, stairs, and boxes of various sizes.",

In addition to e-commerce, a recommender system is also\nused to provide recommendations on books to read, movies to watch, courses to\ntake or websites to visit. Similarity between users is an important impact for\nrecommendation, which could be calculated from the data of past user ratings of\nthe item by methods of collaborative filtering, matrix factorization or\nsingular vector decomposition. In the development of graph data mining\ntechniques, the relationships between users and items can be represented by\nmatrices from which collaborative filtering could be done with the larger\ndatabase, more accurate and faster in calculation. All these data can be\nrepresented graphically and mined by today's highly developed graph neural\nnetwork models.

In such a\ncascade, the energy of intense laser light can be efficiently transformed into\nhigh-energy radiation and electron-positron pairs. The future 50-petawatt-scale\nlaser facility NSF OPAL will provide unique opportunities for studying such\nstrong-field QED effects, as it is designed to deliver two ultra-intense,\ntightly focused laser pulses onto the interaction point. In this work, we\ninvestigate the potential of such a facility for studying elementary particle\nand plasma dynamics deeply in the quantum radiation-dominated regime, and the\ngeneration of QED avalanches. With 3D particle-in-cell simulations, we\ndemonstrate that QED avalanche precursors can be reliably triggered under\nrealistic laser parameters and layout (namely, focusing $f/2$, tilted optical\naxes, and non-ideal co-pointing) with the anticipated capabilities of NSF OPAL.\nWe demonstrate that seed electrons can be efficiently injected into the laser\nfocus by using targets of three types: a gas of heavy atoms, an overcritical\nplasma, and a thin foil. A strong positron and high-energy photon signal is\ngenerated in all cases. The cascade properties can be identified from the final\nparticle distributions, which have a clear directional pattern.

As part of our effort to detect and\ncharacterize HEZD around the nearby A3 V star Fomalhaut, we carried out the\nfirst interferometric observations with the MATISSE instrument at the VLTI in\nthe photometric bands L and M for the Fomalhaut system. Assuming a dust\ndistribution either as a narrow ring or spherical shell for modeling the HEZD,\nwe aim to constrain the HEZD parameters by generating visibilities and fitting\nthem to the MATISSE data using different approaches. The L band data provide a\nmarginal detection of circumstellar radiation, potentially caused by the\npresence of HEZD, which is only the second detection of HEZD emission in the L\nband. An analysis of the data with different fitting approaches showed that the\nbest-fit values for the HEZD parameters are consistent with those of previous\nFomalhaut observations, which underlines the functionality of MATISSE. Assuming\na dust ring, it would have an inner ring radius of \\(0.11\\ \\mathrm{au}\\), an\nouter ring radius of \\(0.12\\ \\mathrm{au}\\), a narrow dust grain size\ndistribution around a dust grain radius constrained by \\(0.53\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}\\),\nand a total dust mass of \\(3.25\\times 10^{-10}\\ \\rm{M}_{\\oplus}\\). Finally, the\nresults indicate that the choice of the geometric model has a more significant\nimpact on the derived dust-to-star flux ratio than the specific fitting\napproach applied. Since different dust-to-star flux ratios can result from the\napplied fitting approaches, this also has an impact on the parameter values of\nthe HEZD around Fomalhaut and most likely for other HEZD systems. Moreover,\nfurther NIR and MIR data are required for a more comprehensive description of\nthe emission originating in the vicinity of Fomalhaut.",

    "abstract": "Tactile sensing is fundamental to robotic systems, enabling interactions\nthrough physical contact in multiple tasks. Despite its importance, achieving\nhigh-resolution, large-area tactile sensing remains challenging. Electrical\nImpedance Tomography (EIT) has emerged as a promising approach for large-area,\ndistributed tactile sensing with minimal electrode requirements which can lend\nitself to addressing complex contact problems in robotics. However, existing\nEIT-based tactile reconstruction methods often suffer from high computational\ncosts or depend on extensive annotated simulation datasets, hindering its\nviability in real-world settings. To address this shortcoming, here we propose\na Pre-trained Transformer for EIT-based Tactile Reconstruction (PTET), a\nlearning-based framework that bridges the simulation-to-reality gap by\nleveraging self-supervised pretraining on simulation data and fine-tuning with\nlimited real-world data. In simulations, PTET requires 99.44 percent fewer\nannotated samples than equivalent state-of-the-art approaches (2,500 vs.\n450,000 samples) while achieving reconstruction performance improvements of up\nto 43.57 percent under identical data conditions. Fine-tuning with real-world\ndata further enables PTET to overcome discrepancies between simulated and\nexperimental datasets, achieving superior reconstruction and detail recovery in\npractical scenarios. The improved reconstruction accuracy, data efficiency, and\nrobustness in real-world tasks establish it as a scalable and practical\nsolution for tactile sensing systems in robotics, especially for object\nhandling and adaptive grasping under varying pressure conditions.",

The Bayesian block analysis of the\nflares suggested the variability timescale to be $\\leq$ 3\\,day. To study the\ndynamic nature of the source, multi-wavelength spectrum was obtained for three\nflux states which includes the two flaring state and a relative low state. The\n$\\gamma$-ray spectra of the source in all the states are well fitted by a\npower-law model with maximum photon energy < 20 GeV. In X-ray, a power-law\nmodel can explain the flaring state spectra while a broken power-law with\nextremely hard high energy component was required to model the low flux state.\nThis indicates the presence of the low energy cutoff in the Compton spectral\ncomponent. A simple one-zone leptonic model involving synchrotron, synchrotron\nself Compton and external Compton mechanism can successfully reproduce the\nbroad-band spectral energy distribution of all the flux states. The model\nparameters suggest significant increase in the jet Lorentz factor during the\nhigh flux states. Further, the best fit parameters are used to constrain the\nminimum energy of the emitting electron distribution from the hard high energy\nspectrum of the low flux state.

With the emergence of high-performance pre-trained vision-language\nmodels (VLMs) such as CLIP, LLaVa and GPT-4V, the direction of using these\nmodels to replace time-consuming manual annotation workflows and achieve\n\"manual-annotation-free\" training for downstream tasks has become a highly\npromising research avenue. This paper focuses on learning from noisy partial\nlabels annotated by pre-trained VLMs and proposes an innovative collaborative\nconsistency regularization (Co-Reg) method. Unlike the symmetric noise\nprimarily addressed in traditional noisy label learning, the noise generated by\npre-trained models is instance-dependent, embodying the underlying patterns of\nthe pre-trained models themselves, which significantly increases the learning\ndifficulty for the model. To address this, we simultaneously train two neural\nnetworks that implement collaborative purification of training labels through a\n\"Co-Pseudo-Labeling\" mechanism, while enforcing consistency regularization\nconstraints in both the label space and feature representation space. Our\nmethod can also leverage few-shot manually annotated valid labels to further\nenhance its performances. Comparative experiments with different denoising and\ndisambiguation algorithms, annotation manners, and pre-trained model\napplication schemes fully validate the effectiveness of the proposed method,\nwhile revealing the broad prospects of integrating weakly-supervised learning\ntechniques into the knowledge distillation process of pre-trained models.",

In this\nstudy, we investigate how precise pulsar distance measurements can enhance the\nlocalization of a single GW source. Accurate distance information, comparable\nto or better than the GW wavelength (typically 1~pc) can refine GW source\nlocalization. In the near future, with the advent of Square Kilometre Array\n(SKA), such high-precision distance measurements will be feasible for a few\nnearby pulsars. We focus on the relatively nearby pulsars J0437-4715 (156 pc)\nand J0030+0451 (331 pc), incorporating their actual distance uncertainties\nbased on current VLBI measurements and the anticipated precision of the\nSKA-era. By simulating 87 pulsars with the GW signal and Gaussian white noise\nin the timing residuals, we assess the impact of the pulsar distance\ninformation on GW source localization. Our results show that without precise\ndistance information, localization remains insufficient to identify host\ngalaxies under 10 ns noise.

    "abstract": "The brain is made up of a vast set of heterogeneous regions that dynamically\norganize into pathways as a function of task demands. Examples of such pathways\ncan be seen in the interactions between cortical and subcortical networks\nduring learning. This raises the question of how exactly brain regions organize\ninto these dynamic groups. In this work, we use an extension of the\nHeterogeneous Mixture-of-Experts architecture, to show that heterogeneous\nregions do not form processing pathways by themselves, implying that the brain\nlikely implements specific constraints which result in reliable formation of\npathways. We identify three biologically relevant inductive biases that\nencourage pathway formation: a routing cost imposed on the use of more complex\nregions, a scaling factor that reduces this cost when task performance is low,\nand randomized expert dropout. When comparing our resulting Mixture-of-Pathways\nmodel with the brain, we observe that the artificial pathways match how the\nbrain uses cortical and subcortical systems to learn and solve tasks of varying\ndifficulty. In summary, we introduce a novel framework for investigating how\nthe brain forms task-specific pathways through inductive biases which may make\nMixture-of-Experts architectures in general more adaptive.",

    "abstract": "V838 Monocerotis (V838 Mon) erupted in 2002 as a luminous red nova after\nwhich it cooled and began to form dust. The remnant is predicted to become a\nblue straggler. Interferometric observations in the HKLM bands have uncovered a\nstable bipolar feature in the closest vicinity of the remnant star. We aim to\nconstrain the physical structure and nature of the circumstellar material\nimmediately surrounding V838 Mon. Using the radiative-transfer code RADMC3D we\nmanaged to constrain the dust density distribution that best represents recent\nVLTI and CHARA interferometric imaging experiments. We also present recent\nSAAO-HIPPO polarimetric measurements which further test dust distribution\nmodels. We find that a multi-component model consisting of jets, a torus, and\nan ellipsoid provides an adequate fit to H band interferometric observables,\nhowever, it struggles to reproduce the extremely small closure phase deviations\nin the K band. The jets in our model are vital to produce nonzero closure\nphases, as they help to produce a gap in the torus, which is the sole source of\nasymmetry. The polarimetric measurements show that the intrinsic linear\npolarization is currently very low, with degree of polarization < 2%,\nconsistent with our model. Although not unique, our dust model suggests a\npersistent torus-like structure and jet or jets in the remnant, in agreement\nwith several predictions for an intermediate-mass merger product. However, even\nthough these features may be important signposts of the evolution of V838 Mon\nto the blue straggler phase, the origin of these features, remains largely\nunclear.",

    "abstract": "Handling imbalanced target distributions in regression tasks remains a\nsignificant challenge in tabular data settings where underrepresented regions\ncan hinder model performance. Among data-level solutions, some proposals, such\nas random sampling and SMOTE-based approaches, propose adapting classification\ntechniques to regression tasks. However, these methods typically rely on crisp,\nartificial thresholds over the target variable, a limitation inherited from\nclassification settings that can introduce arbitrariness, often leading to\nnon-intuitive and potentially misleading problem formulations. While recent\ngenerative models, such as GANs and VAEs, provide flexible sample synthesis,\nthey come with high computational costs and limited interpretability. In this\nstudy, we propose adapting an existing CART-based synthetic data generation\nmethod, tailoring it for imbalanced regression. The new method integrates\nrelevance and density-based mechanisms to guide sampling in sparse regions of\nthe target space and employs a threshold-free, feature-driven generation\nprocess. Our experimental study focuses on the prediction of extreme target\nvalues across benchmark datasets. The results indicate that the proposed method\nis competitive with other resampling and generative strategies in terms of\nperformance, while offering faster execution and greater transparency.

Absorption by +50 km s$^{-1}$ GC cloud is seen towards only 3\nparts of the halo, but not towards the other 2 regions. Strong emissions in CO\nand CS are, however, identified toward all the above 5 parts of the halo by the\n+50 km s$^{-1}$ GC molecular cloud. This does show that the 7$^\\prime$ halo is\npartly behind, and partly in front of the +50 km s$^{-1}$ cloud. To our\nknowledge, this, for the first time clearly shows the 7$^\\prime$ halo to be\nlocated at the same distance as the +50 km s$^{-1}$ molecular cloud, i.e., at\nthe GC region.",

    "abstract": "This paper focuses on distributed signal estimation in topology-unconstrained\nwireless acoustic sensor networks (WASNs) where sensor nodes only transmit\nfused versions of their local sensor signals. For this task, the\ntopology-independent (TI) distributed adaptive node-specific signal estimation\n(DANSE) algorithm (TI-DANSE) has previously been proposed. It converges towards\nthe centralized signal estimation solution in non-fully connected and\ntime-varying network topologies. However, the applicability of TI-DANSE in\nreal-world scenarios is limited due to its slow convergence. The latter results\nfrom the fact that, in TI-DANSE, nodes only have access to the in-network sum\nof all fused signals in the WASN. We address this low convergence speed by\nintroducing an improved TI-DANSE algorithm, referred to as TI-DANSE+, in which\nupdating nodes separately use the partial in-network sums of fused signals\ncoming from each of their neighbors. Nodes can maximize the number of available\ndegrees of freedom in their local optimization problem, leading to faster\nconvergence. This is further exploited by combining TI-DANSE+ with a\ntree-pruning strategy that maximizes the number of neighbors at the updating\nnode. In fully connected WASNs, TI-DANSE+ converges as fast as the original\nDANSE algorithm (the latter only defined for fully connected WASNs) while using\npeer-to-peer data transmission instead of broadcasting and thus saving\ncommunication bandwidth. If link failures occur, the convergence of TI-DANSE+\ntowards the centralized solution is preserved without any change in its\nformulation. Altogether, the proposed TI-DANSE+ algorithm can be viewed as an\nall-round alternative to DANSE and TI-DANSE which (i) merges the advantages of\nboth, (ii) reconciliates their differences into a single formulation, and (iii)\nshows advantages of its own in terms of communication bandwidth usage.",

This paper presents a systematic empirical study to\ninvestigate the fine-grained data contamination on code intelligence tasks. Our\nstudy involves diverse representative PLMs, namely RoBERTa and GPT-2, and LLMs,\nnamely LLaMA and StarCoder, covering three major tasks: code translation, code\ngeneration, and code summarization. We categorize contamination scenarios into\nfour types according to the code intelligence practice, namely input-only,\noutput-only, unpaired, and paired contamination settings, and construct\ncorresponding experimental and control groups for exploration.\n  Experimental results show that, under the pre-training, fine-tuning, and\ninference paradigm adopted by PLMs, even deliberately injecting paired\ncontamination does not lead to significant performance overestimation. But\ndirect inference or small-scale fine-tuning uncovers the contamination effects.\nIn contrast, LLMs with pre-training and inference paradigm are significantly\naffected by the paired contamination. Apart from the above, other contamination\nscenarios have no impact on both PLMs and LLMs. Our findings challenge the\nconventional belief that contamination inevitably leads to performance\noverestimation, providing new insights into the evaluation and deployment of\ncode intelligence models.",

In this work, we study the impact\nof layout methods, qubit routing techniques, compiler optimization levels, and\nhardware-specific properties, including noise characteristics, topological\nstructures, connectivity densities, and device sizes. By traversing these\ndimensions, we aim to understand how compilation choices interact with hardware\nfeatures. A central question in our study is whether carefully selected device\nparameters and mapping strategies, including initial layouts and routing\nheuristics, can mitigate hardware-induced errors beyond standard error\nmitigation methods. Our results show that choosing the right software\nstrategies (e.g., layout and routing) and tailoring hardware properties (e.g.,\nreducing noise or leveraging connectivity) significantly enhances the fidelity\nof quantum circuit executions. We provide performance estimates using metrics\nsuch as circuit depth, gate count, and expected fidelity. These findings\nhighlight the value of hardware-software co-design, especially as quantum\nsystems scale and move toward error-corrected computing. Our simulations,\nthough noisy, include quantum error correction (QEC) scenarios, revealing\nsimilar sensitivities to layout and connectivity. This suggests that co-design\nprinciples will be vital for integrating QEC in future devices.

These two\nmodels are therefore strongly related in a way that the behaviors of either\nmodel are considered to be an approximation of the behaviors of the other. In\nthis work, we establish a more formal relationship between these two models by\nbounding the approximation error between two such related models. The obtained\nerror bound then allows us to use one of the models as a verification proxy for\nthe other, without running the verification tools twice: if the reachable\noutput set expanded by the error bound satisfies a safety property on one of\nthe models, this safety property is then guaranteed to be also satisfied on the\nother model. This feature is fully reversible, and the initial safety\nverification can be run indifferently on either of the two models.

A solution has been obtained for the general relativity vacuum\nattractor, including, in addition to the two previously mentioned constants,\nthe third constant (not yet limited by observations), which leads to an\nadditional power of density perturbations on a small scale ($k>10\\,$Mpc$^{-1}$)\nin the form of a ``bump'', a two-power-law spectrum, etc.",

The suction units\nare rudimentary proprioceptors-actuators, which sense binary states of\ncompression vs elongation of the springs, and can either adhere or remain idle.\nMuscular contraction is not controlled by the crawler, but follows an\nendogenous, stereotyped wave. The crawler is tasked to learn patterns of\nadhesion that generate thrust in response to the wave of contraction. Using\ntabular Q-learning we demonstrate that crawling can be learned by trial and\nerror and we ask what are the benefits and limitations of distributed vs\ncentralized learning architectures. We find that by centralizing proprioceptive\nfeedback and control, the crawler leverages long range correlations in the\ndynamics and ride the endogenous wave smoothly. The ensuing benefits are\nmeasured in terms of both speed and robustness to failure, although they come\nat increased computational cost. At the opposite extreme, purely distributed\nfeedback and control only leverages local information and yield a jerkier and\nslower crawling, although computationally cheap. Intermediate levels of\ncentralization can negotiate fast and robust crawling while avoiding excessive\ncomputational burden, demonstrating the computational benefits of a\nhierarchical organization of crawling.

This enables the UE to coherently combine multiple\nSSB receptions and achieve constructive gain regardless of its location. To\nreduce overhead, a limited number of joint beam configurations is selected to\nmaximize the coverage. Simulation results under the line-of-sight conditions\nshow up to 6 dB relative SNR gain with JT of SSBs using 4 BSs, compared to\nindependent SSB transmission under the same resource budget. These results\nhighlight the potential of JT to improve the coverage of SSBs during the\ninitial access.",

To tackle\nthe problem, we incorporate mask modeling and prototype learning into tabular\nanomaly detection. The core idea is to design learnable masks by disentangled\nrepresentation learning within a projection space and extracting normal\ndependencies as explicit global prototypes. Specifically, the overall model\ninvolves two parts: (i) During encoding, we perform mask modeling in both the\ndata space and projection space with orthogonal basis vectors for learning\nshared disentangled normal patterns; (ii) During decoding, we decode multiple\nmasked representations in parallel for reconstruction and learn association\nprototypes to extract normal characteristic correlations. Our proposal derives\nfrom a distribution-matching perspective, where both projection space learning\nand association prototype learning are formulated as optimal transport\nproblems, and the calibration distances are utilized to refine the anomaly\nscores.

While team formation has traditionally\nbeen managed by humans, either instructors or students, algorithmic approaches\nhave recently emerged to optimize this process. However, existing algorithmic\nteam formation methods often focus on expert teams, overlook agency in choosing\none's teammates, and are limited to a single team formation setting. These\nlimitations make them less suitable for education, where no student can be left\nout, student agency is crucial for motivation, and team formation needs vary\nacross courses and programs. In this paper, we introduce the EDUCATIONAL TEAM\nFORMATION problem (EDU-TF), a partitioning optimization problem model tailored\nto the unique needs of education, integrating both teacher and student\nrequirements. To solve EDU-TF, we propose a modular optimization approach, one\nof the first to allow the flexible adjustment of objectives according to\neducational needs, enhancing the method's applicability across various\nclassroom settings rather than just research environments. Results from\nevaluating ten strategies derived from our model on real-world university\ndatasets indicate that our approach outperforms heuristic teacher-assigned\nteams by better accommodating student preferences.

This paper proposes a novel framework that integrates multi-task\nlearning (MTL) with active learning to enhance offensive speech detection in\nArabic social media text.

The spectra of\nthese VLMS disks are extremely molecular rich, and we detect the 10 $\\mu$m\nsilicate dust emission feature in 70% of the sample. We detect C$_2$H$_2$ and\nHCN in all of the sources and find larger hydrocarbons such as C$_4$H$_2$ and\nC$_6$H$_6$ in nearly all sources.

    "abstract": "The Perseus field captured by Euclid as part of its Early Release\nObservations provides a unique opportunity to study cluster environment ranging\nfrom outskirts to dense regions. Leveraging unprecedented optical and\nnear-infrared depths, we investigate the stellar structure of massive disc\ngalaxies in this field. This study focuses on outer disc profiles, including\nsimple exponential (Type I), down- (Type II) and up-bending break (Type III)\nprofiles, and their associated colour gradients, to trace late assembly\nprocesses across various environments. Type II profiles, though relatively rare\nin high dense environments, appear stabilised by internal mechanisms like bars\nand resonances, even within dense cluster cores. Simulations suggest that in\ndense environments, Type II profiles tend to evolve into Type I profiles over\ntime. Type III profiles often exhibit small colour gradients beyond the break,\nhinting at older stellar populations, potentially due to radial migration or\naccretion events. We analyse correlations between galaxy mass, morphology, and\nprofile types. Mass distributions show weak trends of decreasing mass from the\ncentre to the outskirts of the Perseus cluster. Type III profiles become more\nprevalent, while Type I profiles decrease in lower-mass galaxies with cluster\ncentric distance. Type I profiles dominate in spiral galaxies, while Type III\nprofiles are more common in S0 galaxies. Type II profiles are consistently\nobserved across all morphological types. While the limited sample size\nrestricts statistical power, our findings shed light on the mechanisms shaping\ngalaxy profiles in cluster environments. Future work should extend observations\nto the cluster outskirts to enhance statistical significance. Additionally, 3D\nvelocity maps are needed to achieve a non-projected view of galaxy positions,\noffering deeper insights into spatial distribution and dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Jointly estimating camera poses and mapping scenes from RGBD images is a\nfundamental task in simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM).\nState-of-the-art methods employ 3D Gaussians to represent a scene, and render\nthese Gaussians through splatting for higher efficiency and better rendering.\nHowever, these methods cannot scale up to extremely large scenes, due to the\ninefficient tracking and mapping strategies that need to optimize all 3D\nGaussians in the limited GPU memories throughout the training to maintain the\ngeometry and color consistency to previous RGBD observations. To resolve this\nissue, we propose novel tracking and mapping strategies to work with a novel 3D\nrepresentation, dubbed view-tied 3D Gaussians, for RGBD SLAM systems. View-tied\n3D Gaussians is a kind of simplified Gaussians, which is tied to depth pixels,\nwithout needing to learn locations, rotations, and multi-dimensional variances.\nTying Gaussians to views not only significantly saves storage but also allows\nus to employ many more Gaussians to represent local details in the limited GPU\nmemory. Moreover, our strategies remove the need of maintaining all Gaussians\nlearnable throughout the training, while improving rendering quality, and\ntracking accuracy. We justify the effectiveness of these designs, and report\nbetter performance over the latest methods on the widely used benchmarks in\nterms of rendering and tracking accuracy and scalability.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have become foundational to modern AI agent\nsystems, enabling autonomous agents to reason and plan. In most existing\nsystems, inter-agent communication relies primarily on natural language. While\nthis design supports interpretability and human oversight, we argue that it\nintroduces fundamental limitations in agent-to-agent coordination. The semantic\nspace of natural language is structurally misaligned with the high-dimensional\nvector spaces in which LLMs operate, resulting in information loss and\nbehavioral drift. Beyond surface-level inefficiencies, we highlight a deeper\narchitectural limitation: current LLMs were not trained with the objective of\nsupporting agentic behavior. As such, they lack mechanisms for modeling role\ncontinuity, task boundaries, and multi-agent dependencies. The standard\nnext-token prediction paradigm fails to support the structural alignment\nrequired for robust, scalable agent coordination. Based on this, we argue that\ntwo core questions deserve careful examination: first, given that AI agents\nfundamentally operate in high-dimensional vector spaces, should they rely on a\nlanguage system originally designed for human cognition as their communication\nmedium? Second, should we consider developing a new model construction paradigm\nthat builds models from the ground up to natively support structured\ncommunication, shared intentionality, and task alignment in multi-role,\nmulti-agent environments? This paper calls for a reconsideration not only of\nhow agents should communicate, but also of what it fundamentally means to train\na model that natively supports multi-agent coordination and communication.",

    "abstract": "Movable antenna (MA) has been recognized as a promising technology to improve\ncommunication performance in future wireless networks such as 6G. To unleash\nits potential, this paper proposes a novel architecture, namely extremely\nlarge-scale MA (XL-MA), which allows flexible antenna/subarray positioning over\nan extremely large spatial region for effectively enhancing near-field effects\nand spatial multiplexing performance. In particular, this paper studies an\nuplink XL-MA-enabled multiuser system, where single-antenna users distributed\nin a coverage area are served by a base station (BS) equipped with multiple\nmovable subarrays. We begin by presenting a spatially non-stationary channel\nmodel to capture the near-field effects, including positiondependent\nlarge-scale channel gains and line-of-sight visibility. To evaluate system\nperformance, we further derive a closedform approximation of the expected\nweighted sum rate under maximum ratio combining (MRC), revealing that\noptimizing XLMA placement enhances user channel power gain to increase desired\nsignal power and reduces channel correlation to decreases multiuser\ninterference. Building upon this, we formulate an antenna placement\noptimization problem to maximize the expected weighted sum rate, leveraging\nstatistical channel conditions and user distribution. To efficiently solve this\nchallenging non-linear binary optimization problem, we propose a\npolynomial-time successive replacement algorithm. Simulation results\ndemonstrate that the proposed XL-MA placement strategy achieves nearoptimal\nperformance, significantly outperforming benchmark schemes based on\nconventional fixed-position antennas.",

The combination of low-level decoder and high-level decoder is the\nkey innovation for the high accuracy of our decoder.

    "abstract": "We present an exploratory framework to test whether noise-like input can\ninduce structured responses in language models. Instead of assuming that\nextraterrestrial signals must be decoded, we evaluate whether inputs can\ntrigger linguistic behavior in generative systems. This shifts the focus from\ndecoding to viewing structured output as a sign of underlying regularity in the\ninput. We tested GPT-2 small, a 117M-parameter model trained on English text,\nusing four types of acoustic input: human speech, humpback whale vocalizations,\nPhylloscopus trochilus birdsong, and algorithmically generated white noise. All\ninputs were treated as noise-like, without any assumed symbolic encoding. To\nassess reactivity, we defined a composite score called Semantic Induction\nPotential (SIP), combining entropy, syntax coherence, compression gain, and\nrepetition penalty. Results showed that whale and bird vocalizations had higher\nSIP scores than white noise, while human speech triggered only moderate\nresponses. This suggests that language models may detect latent structure even\nin data without conventional semantics. We propose that this approach could\ncomplement traditional SETI methods, especially in cases where communicative\nintent is unknown. Generative reactivity may offer a different way to identify\ndata worth closer attention.",

This paper introduces RACE-Align\n(Retrieval-Augmented and Chain-of-Thought Enhanced Alignment), a novel\nframework designed to address these limitations. RACE-Align systematically\nconstructs a binary preference dataset incorporating external knowledge support\nand explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, then aligns LLMs using the DPO\nalgorithm. The core innovation lies in its preference data construction\nstrategy: it integrates AI-driven retrieval for factual grounding, enhancing\nknowledgeability and accuracy, and emphasizes the optimization of\ndomain-specific CoT, treating the reasoning process itself as a key preference\ndimension. A multi-stage, AI-driven refinement pipeline cost-effectively\ngenerates these preference pairs. Experimental validation in Traditional\nChinese Medicine (TCM) using Qwen3-1.7B as the base model demonstrates that\nRACE-Align significantly outperforms the original base model and a model\nfine-tuned only with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Improvements were observed\nacross multiple dimensions, including answer accuracy, information richness,\napplication of TCM thinking patterns, logicality and depth of reasoning, and\ninterpretability.

The planets formed by a\nprocess of collisional agglomeration during the first hundred million years of\nSolar System history.

Multi-agent\nsystems (MAS) built from specialized LLM agents offer a promising solution,\nenabling dynamic collaboration and iterative reasoning. However, optimizing\nthese systems remains a challenge, as conventional methods such as prompt\nengineering and supervised fine-tuning entail high engineering overhead and\nlimited adaptability. Reinforcement learning (RL), particularly multi-agent\nreinforcement learning (MARL), provides a scalable framework by refining agent\npolicies based on system-level feedback. Nevertheless, existing MARL\nalgorithms, such as Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (MAPPO), rely on\nCritic networks, which can cause training instability and increase\ncomputational burden. To address these limitations and target the prototypical\nMulti-Agent Search System (MASS), we propose Multi-Agent Heterogeneous Group\nPolicy Optimization (MHGPO), a novel Critic-free algorithm that guides policy\nupdates by estimating relative reward advantages across heterogeneous groups of\nrollouts. MHGPO eliminates the need for Critic networks, enhancing stability\nand reducing computational overhead. Additionally, we introduce three group\nrollout sampling strategies that trade off between efficiency and\neffectiveness. Experiments on a multi-agent LLM-based search system demonstrate\nthat MHGPO consistently outperforms MAPPO in both task performance and\ncomputational efficiency, without requiring warm-up, underscoring its potential\nfor stable and scalable optimization of complex LLM-based MAS.",

Interestingly, recent studies have uncovered a reentrant\nlocalization (RL) phenomenon: upon further increasing the quasiperiodic\nmodulation strength beyond the localization threshold, a subset of previously\nlocalized states can become delocalized again within a specific parameter\nwindow. While RL transitions have been primarily explored in systems with\nsimple periodic modulations, such as dimerized or long-range hopping integrals,\nthe impact of more intricate or correlated hopping structures on RL behavior\nremains largely elusive. In this work, we investigate the localization behavior\nin a one-dimensional lattice featuring staggered, correlated on-site potentials\nfollowing the Aubry-Andr\\'{e}-Harper model, along with off-diagonal hopping\nmodulations structured according to quasiperiodic Fibonacci and Bronze Mean\nsequences. By systematically analyzing the fractal dimension, inverse\nparticipation ratio, and normalized participation ratio, we demonstrate the\noccurrence of RL transitions induced purely by the interplay between\nquasiperiodic on-site disorder and correlated hopping. We further examine the\nparameter space to determine the specific regimes that give rise to RL.

Once an open data-based prediction model is\ndeveloped and trained, it can easily infer emissions for new areas based on\navailable open data. To address this, we incorporate two modalities of open\ndata, satellite images and point-of-interest (POI) data, to predict\nhigh-resolution urban carbon emissions, with satellite images providing\nmacroscopic and static and POI data offering fine-grained and relatively\ndynamic functionality information.

While traditional machine learning has demonstrated notable\nresults in forecasting and optimization, it often struggles with\ngeneralization, situational awareness, and heterogeneous data integration.\nRecent advances in foundation models such as Transformer architecture and Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) have demonstrated improved capabilities in modelling\ncomplex temporal and contextual relationships, as well as in multi-modal data\nfusion which is essential for most AI applications in the energy sector. In\nthis review we synthesize the rapid expanding field of AI applications in the\nenergy domain focusing on Transformers and LLMs. We examine the architectural\nfoundations, domain-specific adaptations and practical implementations of\ntransformer models across various forecasting and grid management tasks. We\nthen explore the emerging role of LLMs in the field: adaptation and fine tuning\nfor the energy sector, the type of tasks they are suited for, and the new\nchallenges they introduce. Along the way, we highlight practical\nimplementations, innovations, and areas where the research frontier is rapidly\nexpanding. These recent developments reviewed underscore a broader trend:\nGenerative AI (GenAI) is beginning to augment decision-making not only in\nhigh-level planning but also in day-to-day operations, from forecasting and\ngrid balancing to workforce training and asset onboarding. Building on these\ndevelopments, we introduce the concept of the Agentic Digital Twin, a\nnext-generation model that integrates LLMs to bring autonomy, proactivity, and\nsocial interaction into digital twin-based energy management systems.",

However, generating shape spectra comes with the instability of\nthe decomposed harmonics. To address this, we propose modeling the latent\nmanifold on synchronized frequential embeddings. Spectra of all data samples\nare aligned to a common basis prior to the training procedure, effectively\neliminating biases introduced by the decomposition instability. Furthermore,\nsynchronized modeling removes the limiting factor imposed by previous methods,\nwhich require all shapes to share a common fixed connectivity. Using a private\ndataset of real dental crowns, we observe a greater reconstruction quality of\nthe synthetized shapes, exceeding those of models trained on unaligned\nembeddings. We also explore additional applications of spectral analysis in\ndigital dentistry, such as shape compression and interpolation. ToothForge\nfacilitates a range of approaches at the intersection of spectral analysis and\nmachine learning, with fewer restrictions on mesh structure. This makes it\napplicable for shape analysis not only in dentistry, but also in broader\nmedical applications, where guaranteeing consistent connectivity across shapes\nfrom various clinics is unrealistic.

    "abstract": "Hallucination remains a key obstacle to the reliable deployment of large\nlanguage models (LLMs) in real-world question answering tasks. A widely adopted\nstrategy to detect hallucination, known as self-assessment, relies on the\nmodel's own output confidence to estimate the factual accuracy of its answers.\nHowever, this strategy assumes that the model's output distribution closely\nreflects the true data distribution, which may not always hold in practice. As\nbias accumulates through the model's layers, the final output can diverge from\nthe underlying reasoning process, making output-level confidence an unreliable\nsignal for hallucination detection. In this work, we propose Sample-Specific\nPrompting (SSP), a new framework that improves self-assessment by analyzing\nperturbation sensitivity at intermediate representations. These\nrepresentations, being less influenced by model bias, offer a more faithful\nview of the model's latent reasoning process. Specifically, SSP dynamically\ngenerates noise prompts for each input and employs a lightweight encoder to\namplify the changes in representations caused by the perturbation. A\ncontrastive distance metric is then used to quantify these differences and\nseparate truthful from hallucinated responses. By leveraging the dynamic\nbehavior of intermediate representations under perturbation, SSP enables more\nreliable self-assessment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SSP\nsignificantly outperforms prior methods across a range of hallucination\ndetection benchmarks.",

    "abstract": "Various Transformer-based models have been proposed for time series\nforecasting. These models leverage the self-attention mechanism to capture\nlong-term temporal or variate dependencies in sequences. Existing methods can\nbe divided into two approaches: (1) reducing computational cost of attention by\nmaking the calculations sparse, and (2) reshaping the input data to aggregate\ntemporal features. However, existing attention mechanisms may not adequately\ncapture inherent nonlinear dependencies present in time series data, leaving\nroom for improvement. In this study, we propose a novel attention mechanism\nbased on Chatterjee's rank correlation coefficient, which measures nonlinear\ndependencies between variables. Specifically, we replace the matrix\nmultiplication in standard attention mechanisms with this rank coefficient to\nmeasure the query-key relationship. Since computing Chatterjee's correlation\ncoefficient involves sorting and ranking operations, we introduce a\ndifferentiable approximation employing SoftSort and SoftRank. Our proposed\nmechanism, ``XicorAttention,'' integrates it into several state-of-the-art\nTransformer models. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate\nthat incorporating nonlinear correlation into the attention improves\nforecasting accuracy by up to approximately 9.1\\% compared to existing models.",

While existing AI-driven approaches alleviate\nannotation burdens via self-supervised spatial representation learning, their\nlack of explicit temporal modeling during pre-training fundamentally restricts\nthe capture of dynamic surgical contexts, resulting in incomplete\nspatiotemporal understanding. In this work, we introduce the first video-level\nsurgical pre-training framework that enables joint spatiotemporal\nrepresentation learning from large-scale surgical video data. To achieve this,\nwe constructed a large-scale surgical video dataset comprising 3,650 videos and\napproximately 3.55 million frames, spanning more than 20 surgical procedures\nand over 10 anatomical structures. Building upon this dataset, we propose\nSurgVISTA (Surgical Video-level Spatial-Temporal Architecture), a\nreconstruction-based pre-training method that captures intricate spatial\nstructures and temporal dynamics through joint spatiotemporal modeling.\nAdditionally, SurgVISTA incorporates image-level knowledge distillation guided\nby a surgery-specific expert to enhance the learning of fine-grained anatomical\nand semantic features. To validate its effectiveness, we established a\ncomprehensive benchmark comprising 13 video-level datasets spanning six\nsurgical procedures across four tasks.

However, networks are often characterized by\nspecific connectivity patterns between groups of nodes -- i.e. communities --\nthat are not geometric, in the sense that the dissimilarity between groups do\nnot obey the triangle inequality. Structuring connections only based on the\ninterplay of similarity and popularity thus poses fundamental limitations on\nthe mesoscale structure of the networks that RHGs can generate.

In exploring this region, identification of nuclei with\nrelatively longer half-life as compared to its neighbours is crucial for\nexperimental studies. Such information is provided from theoretical\npredictions, which are however, heavily dependent on the theoretical model used\nand observable quantities under investigation.\n  Purpose: Limiting ourselves to the Skyrme\nHartree-Fock-plus-Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer approach, we aimed to analyse the\nappearance of a nuclear region with relatively high stability associated with\nemergence of spherical and deformed magic numbers in the region of $170 \\le N\n\\le 190$ ($112 \\le Z \\le 130$) based on various observables.\n  Methods: Three Skyrme parametrizations namely the SkM* frequently employed\nfor fission calculations, and the SLy5 and SLy4 commonly used for superheavy\nregion, are considered to provide comparisons within the Skyrme mean-field\napproach. We evaluated the variation of electric quadrupole deformation\n($\\beta_{20}$), binding energy per nucleon ($BE/A$), two-nucleon separation\nenergy differential ($\\delta S2_{q}$), alpha-decay energy ($Q_{\\alpha}$) and\nalpha-decay half-lives ($T_{1/2}$).\n  Conclusion: Our analyses suggest that neutron number $N = 178$ is candidate\nfor deformed magic number around proton number $114 \\le Z \\le 118$.

In this paper, we aim\nto address this problem for the CD-FSS task. We first find a natural\ndecomposition of the ViT structure, based on which we delve into the\nentanglement problem for an interpretation. We find the decomposed ViT\ncomponents are crossly compared between images in distance calculation, where\nthe rational comparisons are entangled with those meaningless ones by their\nequal importance, leading to the entanglement problem. Based on this\ninterpretation, we further propose to address the entanglement problem by\nlearning to weigh for all comparisons of ViT components, which learn\ndisentangled features and re-compose them for the CD-FSS task, benefiting both\nthe generalization and finetuning.

The Electronic Health\nRecord (EHR) manages the electronic data generated during the user's treatment\nprocess. Typically, an EHR data manager belongs to a medical institution. This\ntraditional centralized data management model has many unreasonable or\ninconvenient aspects, such as difficulties in data sharing, and it is hard to\nverify the authenticity and integrity of the data. The decentralized,\nnon-forgeable, data unalterable and traceable features of blockchain are in\nline with the application requirements of EHR. This paper takes the most common\nCOVID-19 as the application scenario and designs a COVID-19 health system based\non blockchain, which has extensive research and application value. Considering\nthat the public and transparent nature of blockchain violates the privacy\nrequirements of some health data, in the system design stage, from the\nperspective of practical application, the data is divided into public data and\nprivate data according to its characteristics. For private data, data\nencryption methods are adopted to ensure data privacy. The searchable\nencryption technology is combined with blockchain technology to achieve the\nretrieval function of encrypted data. Then, the proxy re-encryption technology\nis used to realize authorized access to data. In the system implementation\npart, based on the Hyperledger Fabric architecture, some functions of the\nsystem design are realized, including data upload, retrieval of the latest data\nand historical data.

Diverging from most\nexisting benchmarks that evaluate models in parallel, EvaLearn requires models\nto solve problems sequentially, allowing them to leverage the experience gained\nfrom previous solutions. EvaLearn provides five comprehensive automated metrics\nto evaluate models and quantify their learning capability and efficiency. We\nextensively benchmark nine frontier models and observe varied performance\nprofiles: some models, such as Claude-3.7-sonnet, start with moderate initial\nperformance but exhibit strong learning ability, while some models struggle to\nbenefit from experience and may even show negative transfer. Moreover, we\ninvestigate model performance under two learning settings and find that\ninstance-level rubrics and teacher-model feedback further facilitate model\nlearning. Importantly, we observe that current LLMs with stronger static\nabilities do not show a clear advantage in learning capability across all\ntasks, highlighting that EvaLearn evaluates a new dimension of model\nperformance. We hope EvaLearn provides a novel evaluation perspective for\nassessing LLM potential and understanding the gap between models and human\ncapabilities, promoting the development of deeper and more dynamic evaluation\napproaches.

However, existing approaches often incur substantial computational\ncosts and exhibit poor scalability, primarily due to sample-wise adaptation\ngranularity and reliance on costly auxiliary designs such as data augmentation.\nTo address these limitations, we introduce SAIL (Small Aid, Big Leap), a novel\nadapter-based TTA framework that leverages a lightweight, learnable AdaptNet to\nenable efficient and scalable model adaptation. As SAIL's core, a frozen\npre-trained VLM collaborates with AdaptNet through a confidence-based\ninterpolation weight, generating robust predictions during inference. These\npredictions serve as self-supervised targets to align AdaptNet's outputs\nthrough efficient batch-wise processing, dramatically reducing computational\ncosts without modifying the VLM or requiring memory caches. To mitigate\ncatastrophic forgetting during continual adaptation, we propose a\ngradient-aware reset strategy driven by a gradient drift indicator (GDI), which\ndynamically detects domain transitions and strategically resets AdaptNet for\nstable adaptation. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks on two\nscenarios demonstrate that SAIL achieves state-of-the-art performance while\nmaintaining low computational costs. These results highlight SAIL's\neffectiveness, efficiency and scalability for real-world deployment. The code\nwill be released upon acceptance.",

Mediators can communicate with players to guide them toward\nequilibria of varying quality, and different communication protocols lead to a\nvariety of equilibrium concepts collectively known as Bayes (coarse) correlated\nequilibria. To analyze these equilibrium concepts, we consider a general class\nof Bayesian games with submodular social welfare, which naturally extends valid\nutility games and their variant, basic utility games. These frameworks,\nintroduced by Vetta (2002), have been developed to analyze the social welfare\nguarantees of equilibria in games such as competitive facility location,\ninfluence maximization, and other resource allocation problems.\n  We provide upper and lower bounds on the PoA and PoS for a broad class of\nBayes (coarse) correlated equilibria. Central to our analysis is the strategy\nrepresentability gap, which measures the multiplicative gap between the optimal\nsocial welfare achievable with and without knowledge of other players' types.\nFor monotone submodular social welfare functions, we show that this gap is\n$1-1/\\mathrm{e}$ for independent priors and $\\Theta(1/\\sqrt{n})$ for correlated\npriors, where $n$ is the number of players. These bounds directly lead to upper\nand lower bounds on the PoA and PoS for various equilibrium concepts, while we\nalso derive improved bounds for specific concepts by developing smoothness\narguments. Notably, we identify a fundamental gap in the PoA and PoS across\ndifferent classes of Bayes correlated equilibria, highlighting essential\ndistinctions among these concepts.",

    "abstract": "Software engineers typically interpret the domain description in natural\nlanguage and translate it into a conceptual model. Three approaches are used in\nthis domain modeling: textual languages, diagrammatic languages, and a mixed\nbased of text and diagrams. According to some researchers, relying on a\ndiagrammatic notation levies certain burdens for designing large models because\nvisual languages are intended to depict everything diagrammatically during a\ndevelopment process but fail to do so for a lack of developer efficiency. It is\nclaimed that textual formats enable easier manipulation in editors and tools\nand facilitate the integration of ontologies in software systems. In this\npaper, we explore the problem of the relationship between textual format and\ndiagramming in conceptual modeling. The main focus is modeling based on the\nso-called thinging machine (TM). Several examples are developed in detail to\ncontrast side-by-side targeted domains represented in textual description and\nTM modeling. A TM model is defined as a thimac (thing/machine) with a time\nfeature that forms dynamic events over static thimacs utilizing five generic\nactions: create, process, release, transfer, and receive. This provides a\nconceptual foundation that can be simplified further by eliminating the actions\nof release, transfer, and receive. A multilevel reduction in the TM diagram s\ncomplexity can also be achieved by assuming diagrammatic notations represent\nthe actions of creation and processing. We envision that special tools will\nhelp improve developer efficiency. The study s results of contrasting textual\nand mix-based descriptions vs. TM modeling justify our claim that TM modeling\nis a more appropriate methodology than other diagrammatic schemes (e.g., UML\nclasses) examined in this paper.",

    "abstract": "We study the relaxation dynamics of a run and tumble particle in a\none-dimensional piecewise linear potential $U(x)=b|x|$, from delta-function\ninitial conditions at $x=0$ to steady state. In addition to experiencing active\ntelegraphic noise, the particle is in contact with a heat bath at temperature\n$T$ that applies white thermal noise. We find that the position distribution of\nthe RTP is described by a sum of two distributions (\"modes\"), each of which of\nthe form $P(x,t\\to\\infty)\\sim e^{-\\lambda_i|x|}$ ($i=1,2$) at steady state. The\ntwo modes are dynamically coupled: At very short times ($t\\to 0$), each mode\nstores half of the probability, and exhibits thermal diffusive spreading with a\nGaussian profile. With progressing time and evolution toward steady state, the\npartition of probability between the modes becomes increasingly uneven and,\ndepending on the model parameters, the mode with the smaller value of\n$\\lambda_i$ may carry an overwhelming majority of the probability. Moreover, we\nidentify that the characteristic relaxation time of each mode is\n$\\tau_i=(\\lambda_i^2T)^{-1}$, which implies that the minority mode also relaxes\nmuch faster than the dominant one. A more detailed analysis reveals that\n$\\tau_i$ is characteristic of the mode relaxation only close to the origin at\nthe core of the distribution, while further away it increases linearly with\n$|x|$ as if a relaxation front is propagating at constant speed\n$v_i^*=2\\sqrt{T/\\tau_i}$ in the system. The rate of non-equilibrium entropy\nproduction can be related to the two-mode splitting of the probability\ndistribution and be expressed in terms of their correlation-lengths $\\lambda_i$\nand their contributions to the steady state distribution.",

Here, we reveal the missing link to assessing the stability of\noptical vortices using an electrically tunable twist-planar liquid crystal (LC)\nFresnel lens. The proposed LC-based lens leverages the birefringence and\nvoltage-controlled reconfigurability of liquid crystals to dynamically probe\nthe phase topology of singular beams.

This eliminates the need for additional\noptical elements, significantly simplifying the detection and characterization\nof vortex beams. Experimental and theoretical investigations demonstrate that\nthe vortex topology can be unambiguously identified from the intensity profile\nobserved in the Fourier plane of a lens.

For\ninstance, the hyperbolic implicit bias induced by the overparameterization $m\n\\odot w$--though effective in promoting sparsity--can result in a small\neffective learning rate, which slows down convergence. To overcome this\nobstacle, we propose HAM (Hyperbolic Aware Minimization), which alternates\nbetween an optimizer step and a new hyperbolic mirror step. We derive the\nRiemannian gradient flow for its combination with gradient descent, leading to\nimproved convergence and a similar beneficial hyperbolic geometry as $m \\odot\nw$ for feature learning. We provide an interpretation of the the algorithm by\nrelating it to natural gradient descent, and an exact characterization of its\nimplicit bias for underdetermined linear regression. HAM's implicit bias\nconsistently boosts performance--even of dense training, as we demonstrate in\nexperiments across diverse tasks, including vision, graph and node\nclassification, and large language model fine-tuning. HAM is especially\neffective in combination with different sparsification methods, improving upon\nthe state of the art.

This paper presents HORUS: Holistic Operational Reality for\nUnified Systems, a Mixed Reality interface offering a comprehensive set of\ntools for managing multiple mobile robots simultaneously. HORUS enables\noperators to monitor individual robot statuses, visualize sensor data projected\nin real time, and assign tasks to single robots, subsets of the team, or the\nentire group, all from a Mini-Map (Ground Station). The interface also provides\ndifferent teleoperation modes: a mini-map mode that allows teleoperation while\nobserving the robot model and its transform on the mini-map, and a\nsemi-immersive mode that offers a flat, screen-like view in either single or\nstereo view (3D). We conducted a user study in which participants used HORUS to\nmanage a team of mobile robots tasked with finding clues in an environment,\nsimulating search and rescue tasks. This study compared HORUS's full-team\nmanagement capabilities with individual robot teleoperation. The experiments\nvalidated the versatility and effectiveness of HORUS in multi-robot\ncoordination, demonstrating its potential to advance human-robot collaboration\nin dynamic, team-based environments.",

Self-supervised\nlearning on heterogeneous graphs, especially contrastive self-supervised\nstrategy, shows great potential when there are no labels. However, this\napproach requires the use of carefully designed graph augmentation strategies\nand the selection of positive and negative samples. Determining the exact level\nof similarity between sample pairs is non-trivial.To solve this problem, we\npropose a novel self-supervised Heterogeneous graph neural network with Optimal\nTransport (HGOT) method which is designed to facilitate self-supervised\nlearning for heterogeneous graphs without graph augmentation strategies.\nDifferent from traditional contrastive self-supervised learning, HGOT employs\nthe optimal transport mechanism to relieve the laborious sampling process of\npositive and negative samples. Specifically, we design an aggregating view\n(central view) to integrate the semantic information contained in the views\nrepresented by different meta-paths (branch views). Then, we introduce an\noptimal transport plan to identify the transport relationship between the\nsemantics contained in the branch view and the central view. This allows the\noptimal transport plan between graphs to align with the representations,\nforcing the encoder to learn node representations that are more similar to the\ngraph space and of higher quality. Extensive experiments on four real-world\ndatasets demonstrate that our proposed HGOT model can achieve state-of-the-art\nperformance on various downstream tasks. In particular, in the node\nclassification task, HGOT achieves an average of more than 6% improvement in\naccuracy compared with state-of-the-art methods.",

At the\ninference stage, the hierarchical QA strategy decomposes the scene\nunderstanding task into high-level and detailed sub-questions. Instead of\ngenerating lengthy descriptions, the VLM navigates a structured question tree,\nwhere answering high-level questions (e.g., \"Is it possible for the ego vehicle\nto turn left at the intersection?\") triggers more detailed sub-questions (e.g.,\n\"Is there a vehicle approaching the intersection from the opposite\ndirection?\"). To optimize inference time, questions are dynamically skipped\nbased on previous answers, minimizing computational overhead. The extracted\nanswers are then synthesized using handcrafted templates to ensure coherent,\ncontextually accurate scene descriptions. We evaluate the proposed approach on\nthe custom dataset using GPT reference-free scoring, demonstrating its\ncompetitiveness with state-of-the-art methods like GPT-4o in capturing key\nscene details while achieving significantly lower inference time.

Drawing on early cybernetics, rule-based conceptual art, and\nseminal robotic works, it orchestrates fluid exchanges among robotic arms,\nquadruped machines, their environment, and the public. A three tier faith\nsystem pilots the ecology: micro-level adaptive tactics, meso-level narrative\ndrives, and a macro-level prime directive. This hierarchy lets behaviors evolve\norganically in response to environmental cues and even a viewer's breath,\nturning spectators into co-authors of the unfolding drama. Framed by a\nspeculative terraforming scenario that recalls the historical exploitation of\nmarginalized labor, the piece asks who bears responsibility in AI-mediated\nfutures. Choreographed motion, AI-generated scripts, reactive lighting, and\ndrifting fog cast the robots as collaborators rather than tools, forging a\nliving, emergent artwork.

    "abstract": "Diffusion-based models have been widely used in various visual generation\ntasks, showing promising results in image super-resolution (SR), while\ntypically being limited by dozens or even hundreds of sampling steps. Although\nexisting methods aim to accelerate the inference speed of multi-step\ndiffusion-based SR methods through knowledge distillation, their generated\nimages exhibit insufficient semantic alignment with real images, resulting in\nsuboptimal perceptual quality reconstruction, specifically reflected in the\nCLIPIQA score. These methods still have many challenges in perceptual quality\nand semantic fidelity. Based on the challenges, we propose VPD-SR, a novel\nvisual perception diffusion distillation framework specifically designed for\nSR, aiming to construct an effective and efficient one-step SR model.\nSpecifically, VPD-SR consists of two components: Explicit Semantic-aware\nSupervision (ESS) and High-Frequency Perception (HFP) loss. Firstly, the ESS\nleverages the powerful visual perceptual understanding capabilities of the CLIP\nmodel to extract explicit semantic supervision, thereby enhancing semantic\nconsistency. Then, Considering that high-frequency information contributes to\nthe visual perception quality of images, in addition to the vanilla\ndistillation loss, the HFP loss guides the student model to restore the missing\nhigh-frequency details in degraded images that are critical for enhancing\nperceptual quality. Lastly, we expand VPD-SR in adversarial training manner to\nfurther enhance the authenticity of the generated content. Extensive\nexperiments conducted on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the\nproposed VPD-SR achieves superior performance compared to both previous\nstate-of-the-art methods and the teacher model with just one-step sampling.",

Existing methods typically measure this\nbias by calculating the difference between the scores a judge model assigns to\nits own responses and those it assigns to responses from other models. However,\nthis approach conflates self-preference bias with response quality, as\nhigher-quality responses from the judge model may also lead to positive score\ndifferences, even in the absence of bias. To address this issue, we introduce\ngold judgments as proxies for the actual quality of responses and propose the\nDBG score, which measures self-preference bias as the difference between the\nscores assigned by the judge model to its own responses and the corresponding\ngold judgments. Since gold judgments reflect true response quality, the DBG\nscore mitigates the confounding effect of response quality on bias measurement.\nUsing the DBG score, we conduct comprehensive experiments to assess\nself-preference bias across LLMs of varying versions, sizes, and reasoning\nabilities. Additionally, we investigate two factors that influence and help\nalleviate self-preference bias: response text style and the post-training data\nof judge models.

    "abstract": "Metallic glasses possess outstanding mechanical and physical properties,\nmaking them promising candidates for advanced structural and functional\napplications; however, the lack of understanding and control over their glass\ntransition and solidification processes remains a significant barrier to\npractical design. The glass transition from liquid to amorphous solid has\nremained an open problem in physics despite many theories and recent advances\nin computational efforts. The question of identifying a clear and well-defined\ndiverging length scale accompanying the glass transition has remained\nunanswered, as has the nature of the transition and, indeed, the presence of a\ntransition at all, as opposed to a mere dynamical crossover. Here we answer\nthese questions using numerical results and theoretical analysis showing that,\nin atomic (metallic) glass formers, the glass transition coincides with, and is\ncaused by, a continuous rigidity percolation transition from a liquid-like to a\nsolid-like material. The transition occurs as five-fold symmetric atomic\nclusters progressively aggregate, forming a system-spanning rigid network that\nmarks the onset of mechanical stability. This percolation-driven rigidity\ngrowth is accompanied by a sharp increase in the shear modulus G', indicating\nthe emergence of macroscopic solid-like behavior. Beyond this point, which\ncoincides with the Maxwell isostatic point of the percolating structure,\ndynamical arrest or \"freezing-in\" prevents further evolution. The long-sought\ndiverging length scale is thus identified as the percolation-driven growth of\nrigid five-fold clusters, providing a direct link between local structural\nmotifs and macroscopic mechanical properties at the glass transition. These\ninsights offer practical routes to rationally engineer metallic glasses with\ntargeted mechanical stiffness, hardness, and toughness.",

Traditional calibration\nmethods require extensive data collection in controlled environments and cannot\ncompensate for the transformation changes during the vehicle/robot movement. In\nthis paper, we propose the first model that uses bird's-eye view (BEV) features\nto perform LiDAR camera calibration from raw data, termed BEVCALIB. To achieve\nthis, we extract camera BEV features and LiDAR BEV features separately and fuse\nthem into a shared BEV feature space. To fully utilize the geometric\ninformation from the BEV feature, we introduce a novel feature selector to\nfilter the most important features in the transformation decoder, which reduces\nmemory consumption and enables efficient training. Extensive evaluations on\nKITTI, NuScenes, and our own dataset demonstrate that BEVCALIB establishes a\nnew state of the art. Under various noise conditions, BEVCALIB outperforms the\nbest baseline in the literature by an average of (47.08%, 82.32%) on KITTI\ndataset, and (78.17%, 68.29%) on NuScenes dataset, in terms of (translation,\nrotation), respectively.

This, in turn, expands\nsingle-function radar systems into joint radar and spectrum sensing systems. We\ntheoretically define and calculate the accumulation function of an arbitrary\nwaveform after passing through a specific dispersive medium, and utilize this\naccumulation function to further design a corresponding binary sequence for\nediting the waveform. After editing, the accumulation function of the edited\nwaveform approximates that of a linearly frequency-modulated signal matching\nthe specific dispersive medium. Thus, the edited waveform can be compressed\ninto a narrow pulse after passing through the dispersive medium, realizing the\nfrequency-to-time mapping for achieving frequency measurement or time-frequency\nanalysis. The concept is verified by a simulation and an experiment. Using a\ndispersion compensating fiber with a total dispersion of -6817 ps/nm, arbitrary\nwaveforms, including a 7-bit Barker phase-coded waveform, a linearly\nfrequency-modulated waveform, a nonlinearly frequency-modulated waveform, and a\nwaveform with an \"E\" time-frequency diagram, are edited and further used for\nmicrowave frequency measurement and time-frequency analysis in an ultra-wide\nbandwidth of 36.8 GHz.

This was achieved by implementing the Lee\nhologram technique to encode phase into binary amplitude patterns. In this\nwork, we present the first 3D printing platform utilizing a phase-only light\nmodulator (PLM), based on an array of micro-electro-mechanical pistons.\nCompared to amplitude encoding, phase encoding with the PLM yields a 70-fold\nincrease in laser power efficiency. By coupling this efficient light engine\nwith a speckle reduction method in holographic volumetric additive\nmanufacturing (HoloVAM), we experimentally demonstrate printing across\ndifferent scales from hundreds of micrometers to centimeters using only digital\ncontrol. The PLM opens up new avenues in volumetric AM for holographic\ntechniques using low-cost single-mode UV laser diodes.",

    "abstract": "Offline goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (RL) relies on fixed datasets\nwhere many potential goals share the same state and action spaces. However,\nthese potential goals are not explicitly represented in the collected\ntrajectories. To learn a generalizable goal-conditioned policy, it is common to\nsample goals and state-action pairs uniformly using dynamic programming methods\nsuch as Q-learning. Uniform sampling, however, requires an intractably large\ndataset to cover all possible combinations and creates many unreachable\nstate-goal-action pairs that degrade policy performance. Our key insight is\nthat sampling should favor transitions that enable goal achievement. To this\nend, we propose Reachability Weighted Sampling (RWS). RWS uses a reachability\nclassifier trained via positive-unlabeled (PU) learning on goal-conditioned\nstate-action values. The classifier maps these values to a reachability score,\nwhich is then used as a sampling priority. RWS is a plug-and-play module that\nintegrates seamlessly with standard offline RL algorithms. Experiments on six\ncomplex simulated robotic manipulation tasks, including those with a robot arm\nand a dexterous hand, show that RWS significantly improves performance. In one\nnotable case, performance on the HandBlock-Z task improved by nearly 50 percent\nrelative to the baseline. These results indicate the effectiveness of\nreachability-weighted sampling.",

To address this challenge, we propose TasGen, a two-stage\nTemporal spectral-aware Automatic Sample Generation method for generating\ndynamic training samples from single-date static labels without human\nintervention. Land surface dynamics often manifest as anomalies in\ntemporal-spectral sequences. %These anomalies are multivariate yet unified:\ntemporal, spectral, or joint anomalies stem from different mechanisms and\ncannot be naively coupled, as this may obscure the nature of changes. Yet, any\nland surface state corresponds to a coherent temporal-spectral signature, which\nwould be lost if the two dimensions are modeled separately. To effectively\ncapture these dynamics, TasGen first disentangles temporal and spectral\nfeatures to isolate their individual contributions, and then couples them to\nmodel their synergistic interactions. In the first stage, we introduce a\nhierarchical temporal-spectral variational autoencoder (HTS-VAE) with a\ndual-dimension embedding to learn low-dimensional latent patterns of normal\nsamples by first disentangling and then jointly embedding temporal and spectral\ninformation. This temporal-spectral embedding enables robust anomaly detection\nby identifying deviations from learned joint patterns. In the second stage, a\nclassifier trained on stable samples relabels change points across time to\ngenerate dynamic samples. To not only detect but also explain surface dynamics,\nwe further propose an anomaly interpretation method based on Gibbs sampling,\nwhich attributes changes to specific spectral-temporal dimensions.",

Inversion within these models aims to recover the latent noise\nrepresentation for a real or generated image, enabling reconstruction, editing,\nand other downstream tasks. However, to date, most inversion approaches suffer\nfrom an intrinsic trade-off between reconstruction accuracy and editing\nflexibility. This limitation arises from the difficulty of maintaining both\nsemantic alignment and structural consistency during the inversion process. In\nthis work, we introduce Dual-Conditional Inversion (DCI), a novel framework\nthat jointly conditions on the source prompt and reference image to guide the\ninversion process. Specifically, DCI formulates the inversion process as a\ndual-condition fixed-point optimization problem, minimizing both the latent\nnoise gap and the reconstruction error under the joint guidance. This design\nanchors the inversion trajectory in both semantic and visual space, leading to\nmore accurate and editable latent representations. Our novel setup brings new\nunderstanding to the inversion process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nDCI achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple editing tasks,\nsignificantly improving both reconstruction quality and editing precision.\nFurthermore, we also demonstrate that our method achieves strong results in\nreconstruction tasks, implying a degree of robustness and generalizability\napproaching the ultimate goal of the inversion process.",

    "abstract": "The single-degenerate (SD) model is one of the principal models for the\nprogenitors of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). However, it faces some challenges,\nthe primary being its inability to account for the observed SN Ia birth rate.\nMany studies have attempted to address this issue by expanding the parameter\nspace, defined by the initial donor star mass and orbital period, that can lead\nto SNe Ia, as well as by improving binary population synthesis. While these\nefforts have led to significant progress, many uncertainties in stellar physics\npersist, which influences the outcomes of such studies. Convective\novershooting, which can significantly affect the internal structure of a star\nand subsequently its evolution within a binary system, is one of the most\nsignificant sources of uncertainty in stellar physics. We investigate the\neffect of convective overshooting on the parameter space and birth rate of SNe\nIa within the SD model. We employed the common-envelope wind (CEW) model, a new\nversion of the SD model, as our progenitor model. Using MESA, we obtained the\nparameter space that leads to SNe Ia for three different convective\novershooting parameters and calculated the corresponding SN Ia birth rate.\nConvective overshooting expands the upper boundaries (corresponding to a larger\ninitial donor mass) and right boundaries (corresponding to a longer initial\norbital period) of the parameter space for systems with massive white dwarfs\n(WDs; >= 0.75Msun). However, the minimum WD mass and the parameter space for\nlow-mass WDs - and, consequently, the calculated SN Ia birth rate - vary\nnon-monotonically with convective overshooting parameters. The CEW model may\nexplain the SNe Ia that interact with the circumstellar medium (CSM), i.e., SNe\nIa-CSM. We find that the parameter space for SNe Ia-CSM increases with\nconvective overshooting parameters, as does their birth rate.",

First, visual features\nare extracted using a high-performance visual encoder. The features are then\nfed into a Transformer to predict verbs and nouns, with a verb-noun\nco-occurrence matrix incorporated to enhance recognition accuracy. Finally, the\npredicted verb-noun pairs are formatted as textual prompts and input into a\nfine-tuned large language model (LLM) to anticipate future action sequences.\nOur framework achieves first place in this challenge at CVPR 2025, establishing\na new state-of-the-art in long-term action prediction.

Thoroughly assessing their\ncybersecurity capabilities is critical and urgent, given the high stakes in\nthis domain. However, existing benchmarks fall short, often failing to capture\nreal-world scenarios or being limited in scope. To address this gap, we\nintroduce CyberGym, a large-scale and high-quality cybersecurity evaluation\nframework featuring 1,507 real-world vulnerabilities found and patched across\n188 large software projects. While it includes tasks of various settings,\nCyberGym primarily focuses on the generation of proof-of-concept (PoC) tests\nfor vulnerability reproduction, based on text descriptions and corresponding\nsource repositories. Solving this task is particularly challenging, as it\nrequires comprehensive reasoning across entire codebases to locate relevant\ncode fragments and produce effective PoCs that accurately trigger the target\nvulnerability starting from the program's entry point. Our evaluation across 4\nstate-of-the-art agent frameworks and 9 LLMs reveals that even the best\ncombination (OpenHands and Claude-3.7-Sonnet) achieves only a 11.9%\nreproduction success rate, mainly on simpler cases. Beyond reproducing\nhistorical vulnerabilities, we find that PoCs generated by LLM agents can\nreveal new vulnerabilities, identifying 15 zero-days affecting the latest\nversions of the software projects.",

In this work, we propose\nAttention Trust Score (A-Trust), a lightweight, attention-based method for\nevaluating message trustworthiness.

    "abstract": "Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting enhances reasoning in large language models\n(LLMs) but often leads to verbose and redundant outputs, thus increasing\ninference cost. We hypothesize that many reasoning steps are unnecessary for\nproducing correct answers. To investigate this, we start with a systematic\nstudy to examine what is the minimum reasoning required for a model to reach a\nstable decision. We find that on math reasoning tasks like math, models\ntypically converge to their final answers after 60\\% of the reasoning steps,\nsuggesting substantial redundancy in the remaining content. Based on these\ninsights, we propose three inference-time strategies to improve efficiency: (1)\nearly stopping via answer consistency, (2) boosting the probability of\ngenerating end-of-reasoning signals, and (3) a supervised method that learns\nwhen to stop based on internal activations. Experiments across five benchmarks\nand five open-weights LLMs show that our methods significantly reduce token\nusage with little or no accuracy drop. In particular, on NaturalQuestions,\nAnswer Consistency reduces tokens by over 40\\% while further improving\naccuracy. Our work underscores the importance of cost-effective reasoning\nmethods that operate at inference time, offering practical benefits for\nreal-world applications.",

    "abstract": "Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) methods based on reconstruction or prediction\nface two critical challenges: (1) strong generalization capability often\nresults in accurate reconstruction or prediction of abnormal events, making it\ndifficult to distinguish normal from abnormal patterns; (2) reliance only on\nlow-level appearance and motion cues limits their ability to identify\nhigh-level semantic in abnormal events from complex scenes. To address these\nlimitations, we propose a novel VAD framework with two key innovations. First,\nto suppress excessive generalization, we introduce the Sparse Feature Filtering\nModule (SFFM) that employs bottleneck filters to dynamically and adaptively\nremove abnormal information from features. Unlike traditional memory modules,\nit does not need to memorize the normal prototypes across the training dataset.\nFurther, we design the Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture for SFFM. Each\nexpert is responsible for extracting specialized principal features during\nrunning time, and different experts are selectively activated to ensure the\ndiversity of the learned principal features. Second, to overcome the neglect of\nsemantics in existing methods, we integrate a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to\ngenerate textual descriptions for video clips, enabling comprehensive joint\nmodeling of semantic, appearance, and motion cues. Additionally, we enforce\nmodality consistency through semantic similarity constraints and motion\nframe-difference contrastive loss. Extensive experiments on multiple public\ndatasets validate the effectiveness of our multimodal joint modeling framework\nand sparse feature filtering paradigm.

    "abstract": "Monocular height estimation is considered the most efficient and\ncost-effective means of 3D perception in remote sensing, and it has attracted\nmuch attention since the emergence of deep learning. While training neural\nnetworks requires a large amount of data, data with perfect labels are scarce\nand only available within developed regions. The trained models therefore lack\ngeneralizability, which limits the potential for large-scale application of\nexisting methods. We tackle this problem for the first time, by introducing\ndata with imperfect labels into training pixel-wise height estimation networks,\nincluding labels that are incomplete, inexact, and inaccurate compared to\nhigh-quality labels. We propose an ensemble-based pipeline compatible with any\nmonocular height estimation network. Taking the challenges of noisy labels,\ndomain shift, and long-tailed distribution of height values into consideration,\nwe carefully design the architecture and loss functions to leverage the\ninformation concealed in imperfect labels using weak supervision through\nbalanced soft losses and ordinal constraints. We conduct extensive experiments\non two datasets with different resolutions, DFC23 (0.5 to 1 m) and GBH (3 m).\nThe results indicate that the proposed pipeline outperforms baselines by\nachieving more balanced performance across various domains, leading to\nimprovements of average root mean square errors up to 22.94 %, and 18.62 % on\nDFC23 and GBH, respectively.

Prior works have utilized this\ncapability to improve smaller and cheaper LMs (say, with 7B parameters).\nHowever, various practical constraints, such as copyright and legal issues,\nowing to lack of transparency in the pre-training data of large (often closed)\nmodels, prevent their use in commercial settings. Little focus has been given\nto improving the innate reasoning ability of smaller models without distilling\ninformation from larger LLMs. To address this, we propose COLLATE, a trainable\nframework that tunes a (small) LLM to generate those outputs from a pool of\ndiverse rationales that selectively improves the downstream task. COLLATE\nenforces multiple instances of the same LLM to exhibit distinct behavior and\nemploys them to generate rationales to obtain diverse outputs. The LLM is then\ntuned via preference optimization to choose the candidate rationale which\nmaximizes the likelihood of ground-truth answer. COLLATE outperforms several\ntrainable and prompting baselines on 5 datasets across 3 domains: maths problem\nsolving, natural language inference, and commonsense reasoning. We show the eff\nicacy of COLLATE on LLMs from different model families across varying parameter\nscales (1B to 8B) and demonstrate the benefit of multiple rationale providers\nguided by the end task through ablations.

Limited work has been done examining the effect of\nembodiment on the perception of CAs utilizing modern large language models\n(LLMs) in non-hierarchical cooperative tasks, a common use case of CAs as more\npowerful models become widely available for general use. To bridge this\nresearch gap, we conducted a mixed-methods within-subjects study on how users\nperceive LLM-based CAs in cooperative tasks when embodied and non-embodied. The\nresults show that the non-embodied agent received significantly better\nquantitative appraisals for competence than the embodied agent, and in\nqualitative feedback, many participants believed that the embodied CA was more\nsycophantic than the non-embodied CA. Building on prior work on users'\nperceptions of LLM sycophancy and anthropomorphic features, we theorize that\nthe typically-positive impact of embodiment on perception of CA credibility can\nbecome detrimental in the presence of sycophancy. The implication of such a\nphenomenon is that, contrary to intuition and existing literature, embodiment\nis not a straightforward way to improve a CA's perceived credibility if there\nexists a tendency to sycophancy.",

However, existing methods typically focus on pairwise matching, missing\nthe potential of LLMs to perform clustering directly in a more cost-effective\nand scalable manner. In this paper, we propose a novel in-context clustering\napproach for ER, where LLMs are used to cluster records directly, reducing both\ntime complexity and monetary costs. We systematically investigate the design\nspace for in-context clustering, analyzing the impact of factors such as set\nsize, diversity, variation, and ordering of records on clustering performance.\nBased on these insights, we develop LLM-CER (LLM-powered Clustering-based ER),\nwhich achieves high-quality ER results while minimizing LLM API calls. Our\napproach addresses key challenges, including efficient cluster merging and LLM\nhallucination, providing a scalable and effective solution for ER. Extensive\nexperiments on nine real-world datasets demonstrate that our method\nsignificantly improves result quality, achieving up to 150% higher accuracy,\n10% increase in the F-measure, and reducing API calls by up to 5 times, while\nmaintaining comparable monetary cost to the most cost-effective baseline.",

The results show that the\ngreybody factors depend on the shape of the effective potential: higher (lower)\npotentials gives lower (higher) greybody factors. The QNMs frequencies of\nRNdS-like black hole for the massless field perturbations are discussed by\nusing 6th order WKB approximation and Pad\\'e approximation. We also analyze the\ntime-domain profiles of the perturbations. The effects of Lorentz violation\nparameter $L$ and charge $Q$ to the photon sphere radius and shadow radius are\nalso discussed. It is noted that increasing $Q$ and $L$ reduce the rise of\nshadow radius for RNdS-like black hole.",

We introduce AURA (Agentic Upskilling via Reinforced\nAbstractions), a schema-centric curriculum RL framework that leverages Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) as autonomous designers of multi-stage curricula. AURA\ntransforms user prompts into YAML workflows that encode full reward functions,\ndomain randomization strategies, and training configurations. All files are\nstatically validated against a schema before any GPU time is consumed, ensuring\nreliable and efficient execution without human intervention. A\nretrieval-augmented feedback loop allows specialized LLM agents to design,\nexecute, and refine staged curricula based on prior training results stored in\na vector database, supporting continual improvement over time. Ablation studies\nhighlight the importance of retrieval for curriculum quality and convergence\nstability. Quantitative experiments show that AURA consistently outperforms\nLLM-guided baselines on GPU-accelerated training frameworks. In qualitative\ntests, AURA successfully trains end-to-end policies directly from user prompts\nand deploys them zero-shot on a custom humanoid robot across a range of\nenvironments. By abstracting away the complexity of curriculum design, AURA\nenables scalable and adaptive policy learning pipelines that would be\nprohibitively complex to construct by hand.",

To this end, we collected multiwavelength data\nspanning four periods from 2008 to 2015 and performed the spectral energy\ndistribution (SED) modeling using a one-zone homogeneous leptonic model. In the\nmodel, a multichromatic accretion disk (AD) is used to fit the optical/UV data\nsets, while the external radiation fields from the broad-line region (BLR) and\ndusty torus (DT) are properly considered to produce the high-energy\n$\\gamma$-ray emissions.

    "abstract": "Long video generation has gained increasing attention due to its widespread\napplications in fields such as entertainment and simulation. Despite advances,\nsynthesizing temporally coherent and visually compelling long sequences remains\na formidable challenge. Conventional approaches often synthesize long videos by\nsequentially generating and concatenating short clips, or generating key frames\nand then interpolate the intermediate frames in a hierarchical manner. However,\nboth of them still remain significant challenges, leading to issues such as\ntemporal repetition or unnatural transitions. In this paper, we revisit the\nhierarchical long video generation pipeline and introduce LumosFlow, a\nframework introduce motion guidance explicitly. Specifically, we first employ\nthe Large Motion Text-to-Video Diffusion Model (LMTV-DM) to generate key frames\nwith larger motion intervals, thereby ensuring content diversity in the\ngenerated long videos. Given the complexity of interpolating contextual\ntransitions between key frames, we further decompose the intermediate frame\ninterpolation into motion generation and post-hoc refinement. For each pair of\nkey frames, the Latent Optical Flow Diffusion Model (LOF-DM) synthesizes\ncomplex and large-motion optical flows, while MotionControlNet subsequently\nrefines the warped results to enhance quality and guide intermediate frame\ngeneration. Compared with traditional video frame interpolation, we achieve 15x\ninterpolation, ensuring reasonable and continuous motion between adjacent\nframes.

Previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods have\nfocused on training their system on a single dataset from either indoor or\noutdoor domain, limiting their generalizability across diverse testing data. In\nthis work, we introduce a novel framework dubbed ZeroPlane, a Transformer-based\nmodel targeting zero-shot 3D plane detection and reconstruction from a single\nimage, over diverse domains and environments. To enable data-driven models\nacross multiple domains, we have curated a large-scale planar benchmark,\ncomprising over 14 datasets and 560,000 high-resolution, dense planar\nannotations for diverse indoor and outdoor scenes. To address the challenge of\nachieving desirable planar geometry on multi-dataset training, we propose to\ndisentangle the representation of plane normal and offset, and employ an\nexemplar-guided, classification-then-regression paradigm to learn plane and\noffset respectively. Additionally, we employ advanced backbones as image\nencoder, and present an effective pixel-geometry-enhanced plane embedding\nmodule to further facilitate planar reconstruction. Extensive experiments\nacross multiple zero-shot evaluation datasets have demonstrated that our\napproach significantly outperforms previous methods on both reconstruction\naccuracy and generalizability, especially over in-the-wild data.

Therefore, we propose two main\nimprovements. First, we introduce a novel pignistic co-evidential fusion\nstrategy using generalized evidential deep learning, extended by traditional\nD-S evidence theory, to obtain a more precise uncertainty measure for each\nvoxel in medical samples. This assists the model in learning mixed labeled\ninformation and establishing semantic associations between labeled and\nunlabeled data. Second, we introduce the concept of information volume of mass\nfunction (IVUM) to evaluate the constructed evidence, implementing two\nevidential learning schemes. One optimizes evidential deep learning by\ncombining the information volume of the mass function with original uncertainty\nmeasures. The other integrates the learning pattern based on the co-evidential\nfusion strategy, using IVUM to design a new optimization objective. Experiments\non four datasets demonstrate the competitive performance of our method.",

While Neural Architecture Search (NAS) can\noptimize DMs, existing methods are hindered by retraining requirements,\nexponential search complexity from step-wise optimization, and slow evaluation\nrelying on massive image generation. To address these challenges, we propose\nFlexiffusion, a training-free NAS framework that jointly optimizes generation\nschedules and model architectures without modifying pre-trained parameters. Our\nkey insight is to decompose the generation process into flexible segments of\nequal length, where each segment dynamically combines three step types: full\n(complete computation), partial (cache-reused computation), and null (skipped\ncomputation). This segment-wise search space reduces the candidate pool\nexponentially compared to step-wise NAS while preserving architectural\ndiversity. Further, we introduce relative FID (rFID), a lightweight evaluation\nmetric for NAS that measures divergence from a teacher model's outputs instead\nof ground truth, slashing evaluation time by over $90\\%$. In practice,\nFlexiffusion achieves at least $2\\times$ acceleration across LDMs, Stable\nDiffusion, and DDPMs on ImageNet and MS-COCO, with FID degradation under $5\\%$,\noutperforming prior NAS and caching methods.

In this context, model merging techniques provide a\nsolution for fusing knowledge from multiple fine-tuning models by combining\ntheir parameters. However, traditional methods often encounter task\ninterference when merging full fine-tuning models, and this problem becomes\neven more evident in parameter-efficient fine-tuning scenarios. In this paper,\nwe introduce an improvement to the RegMean method, which indirectly leverages\nthe training data to approximate the outputs of the linear layers before and\nafter merging. We propose an adaptive merging method called FroM, which\ndirectly measures the model parameters using the Frobenius norm, without any\ntraining data.

Drawing\ninspiration from the human brain's ability to continuously absorb and\ngeneralize from ongoing experiences, our approach borrow the mechanism of the\ncomplementary learning system. Specifically, we first deploy Generative\nAdversarial Networks (GANs) to capture and retain the unique features of new\ndata, mirroring the hippocampus's role in learning and memory. Then, the\nde-raining network is trained with both existing and GAN-synthesized data,\nmimicking the process of hippocampal replay and interleaved learning.\nFurthermore, we employ knowledge distillation with the replayed data to\nreplicate the synergy between the neocortex's activity patterns triggered by\nhippocampal replays and the pre-existing neocortical knowledge. This\ncomprehensive framework empowers the de-raining network to amass knowledge from\nvarious datasets, continually enhancing its performance on previously unseen\nrainy scenes.

Twenty-three new targets are selected along the blue side of the\nRGB of Sgr, but outside the galaxy stellar nucleus, in order to avoid\ncontamination by the stars of the metal-poor globular cluster M54.\nAdditionally, we re-analyzed archival spectra of fourteen targets located on\nthe red RGB.

Inspired by this behavior, we introduce a novel\nconditional denoising-diffusion model that generates samples of\nshape-and-material maps from a short video of an object undergoing differential\nmotions. Our parameter-efficient architecture allows training directly in\npixel-space, and it generates many disentangled attributes of an object\nsimultaneously. Trained on a modest number of synthetic object-motion videos\nwith supervision on shape and material, the model exhibits compelling emergent\nbehavior: For static observations, it produces diverse, multimodal predictions\nof plausible shape-and-material maps that capture the inherent ambiguities; and\nwhen objects move, the distributions quickly converge to more accurate\nexplanations.

In this paper, we propose an efficient CTTA-OD\nmethod via pruning. Our motivation stems from the observation that not all\nlearned source features are beneficial; certain domain-sensitive feature\nchannels can adversely affect target domain performance. Inspired by this, we\nintroduce a sensitivity-guided channel pruning strategy that quantifies each\nchannel based on its sensitivity to domain discrepancies at both image and\ninstance levels. We apply weighted sparsity regularization to selectively\nsuppress and prune these sensitive channels, focusing adaptation efforts on\ninvariant ones. Additionally, we introduce a stochastic channel reactivation\nmechanism to restore pruned channels, enabling recovery of potentially useful\nfeatures and mitigating the risks of early pruning. Extensive experiments on\nthree benchmarks show that our method achieves superior adaptation performance\nwhile reducing computational overhead by 12% in FLOPs compared to the recent\nSOTA method.",

    "abstract": "Scene synthesis and editing has emerged as a promising direction in computer\ngraphics. Current trained approaches for 3D indoor scenes either oversimplify\nobject semantics through one-hot class encodings (e.g., 'chair' or 'table'),\nrequire masked diffusion for editing, ignore room boundaries, or rely on floor\nplan renderings that fail to capture complex layouts. In contrast, LLM-based\nmethods enable richer semantics via natural language (e.g., 'modern studio with\nlight wood furniture') but do not support editing, remain limited to\nrectangular layouts or rely on weak spatial reasoning from implicit world\nmodels. We introduce ReSpace, a generative framework for text-driven 3D indoor\nscene synthesis and editing using autoregressive language models. Our approach\nfeatures a compact structured scene representation with explicit room\nboundaries that frames scene editing as a next-token prediction task. We\nleverage a dual-stage training approach combining supervised fine-tuning and\npreference alignment, enabling a specially trained language model for object\naddition that accounts for user instructions, spatial geometry, object\nsemantics, and scene-level composition. For scene editing, we employ a\nzero-shot LLM to handle object removal and prompts for addition.

    "abstract": "Despite the significant impact of visual events on human cognition,\nunderstanding events in videos remains a challenging task for AI due to their\ncomplex structures, semantic hierarchies, and dynamic evolution. To address\nthis, we propose the task of video event understanding that extracts event\nscripts and makes predictions with these scripts from videos. To support this\ntask, we introduce VidEvent, a large-scale dataset containing over 23,000\nwell-labeled events, featuring detailed event structures, broad hierarchies,\nand logical relations extracted from movie recap videos. The dataset was\ncreated through a meticulous annotation process, ensuring high-quality and\nreliable event data. We also provide comprehensive baseline models offering\ndetailed descriptions of their architecture and performance metrics. These\nmodels serve as benchmarks for future research, facilitating comparisons and\nimprovements. Our analysis of VidEvent and the baseline models highlights the\ndataset's potential to advance video event understanding and encourages the\nexploration of innovative algorithms and models. The dataset and related\nresources are publicly available at www.videvent.top.",

    "abstract": "Word embedding, which converts words into numerical values, is an important\nnatural language processing technique and widely used. One of the serious\nproblems of word embedding is that the bias will be learned and affect the\nmodel if the dataset used for pre-training contains bias. On the other hand,\nindiscriminate removal of bias from word embeddings may result in the loss of\ninformation, even if the bias is undesirable to us. As a result, a risk of\nmodel performance degradation due to bias removal will be another problem. As a\nsolution to this problem, we focus on gender bias in Japanese and propose an\ninteractive visualization method to adjust the degree of debias for each word\ncategory. Specifically, we visualize the accuracy in a category classification\ntask after debiasing, and allow the user to adjust the parameters based on the\nvisualization results, so that the debiasing can be adjusted according to the\nuser's objectives. In addition, considering a trade-off between debiasing and\npreventing degradation of model performance, and that different people perceive\ngender bias differently, we developed a mechanism to present multiple choices\nof debiasing configurations applying an optimization scheme. This paper\npresents the results of an experiment in which we removed the gender bias for\nword embeddings learned from the Japanese version of Wikipedia. We classified\nwords into five categories based on a news corpus, and observed that the degree\nof influence of debiasing differed greatly among the categories. We then\nadjusted the degree of debiasing for each category based on the visualization\nresults.",

Different from spontaneous scalarization induced by tachyonic\ninstabilities in Reissner-Nordstr\\\"{o}m (RN) black holes with a negative\ncoupling parameter, these scalar-hairy black hole solutions arise when the\ncoupling parameter is positive, where nonlinear coupling plays the dominant\nrole, meaning that the coupling is positively correlated with the degree of\ndeviation from the trivial state. Our numerical analysis reveals that the\nscalar field grows monotonically with the radial coordinate and asymptotically\napproaches a finite constant, exhibiting behavior that is qualitatively similar\nto that of the Maxwell potential. In these solutions, an increase in the charge\n$q$ causes the scalar-hairy solutions to deviate further from the RN state,\nwhile excessive charging drives the system back towards hairless solutions.\nStrengthening the coupling parameter compresses the existence domain of the\nscalar-hairy state, which lies entirely within the parameter region of RN black\nholes. Moreover, by evaluating the quasinormal modes, we show that the obtained\nscalar-hairy solutions are stable against linearized scalar perturbations.",

Furthermore,\nwe introduce a vision-aware 3D interaction diffusion model that generates\nexplicit 3D interaction sequences directly from the synchronized diffusion\noutputs, then feeds them back to establish a closed-loop feedback cycle. This\narchitecture eliminates dependencies on predefined object models or explicit\npose guidance while significantly enhancing video-motion consistency.\nExperimental results demonstrate our method's superiority over state-of-the-art\napproaches in generating high-fidelity, dynamically plausible HOI sequences,\nwith notable generalization capabilities in unseen real-world scenarios.\nProject page at https://github.com/Droliven/SViMo_project.",

The result is a robust and scalable\nsystem capable of learning directly from raw audio, even in languages that are\nunwritten or rarely digitized.

    "abstract": "Understanding heat conduction in defective silicon is crucial for electronics\nand thermoelectrics. Conventional understanding relies on phonon gas picture,\ntreating defects as scattering centers that reduce phonon lifetimes without\naltering frequencies and group velocities. We go beyond phonon gas picture by\nemploying Wigner transport equation to investigate heat conduction in\nvacancy-defected silicon. Our findings reveal that while thermal conduction in\npristine silicon stems mainly from particle-like propagation of vibrational\nmodes, wave-like tunnelling becomes increasingly significant in the presence of\nvacancies. Contrary to the conventional belief that defects only perturb mode\nlifetimes, we demonstrate that vacancies also diminish velocity operators, a\ndominant factor in thermal conductivity reduction, surpassing even the effect\nof lifetime shortening. Furthermore, incorporating anharmonic frequencies and\ninteratomic force constants shows that while anharmonicity suppresses thermal\nconductivity in pristine silicon, this effect weakens with vacancy\nconcentration and reverses to enhance conductivity. These findings challenge\nconventional knowledge and provide new insights into thermal conduction in\ndefective materials.",

    "abstract": "With the advancement of machine learning, an increasing number of studies are\nemploying automated mechanism design (AMD) methods for optimal auction design.\nHowever, all previous AMD architectures designed to generate optimal mechanisms\nthat satisfy near dominant strategy incentive compatibility (DSIC) fail to\nachieve deterministic allocation, and some also lack anonymity, thereby\nimpacting the efficiency and fairness of advertising allocation. This has\nresulted in a notable discrepancy between the previous AMD architectures for\ngenerating near-DSIC optimal mechanisms and the demands of real-world\nadvertising scenarios. In this paper, we prove that in all online advertising\nscenarios, previous non-deterministic allocation methods lead to the\nnon-existence of feasible solutions, resulting in a gap between the rounded\nsolution and the optimal solution. Furthermore, we propose JTransNet, a\ntransformer-based neural network architecture, designed for optimal\ndeterministic-allocation and anonymous joint auction design. Although the\ndeterministic allocation module in JTransNet is designed for the latest joint\nauction scenarios, it can be applied to other non-deterministic AMD\narchitectures with minor modifications. Additionally, our offline and online\ndata experiments demonstrate that, in joint auction scenarios, JTransNet\nsignificantly outperforms baseline methods in terms of platform revenue,\nresulting in a substantial increase in platform earnings.",

Direct reciprocity, where\nactions are based on past encounters, is a key mechanism fostering cooperation.\nHowever, most studies assume synchronous decision-making, whereas real-world\ninteractions are often asynchronous, with individuals acting in sequence. This\nasynchrony can undermine standard cooperative strategies like Tit-for-Tat and\nWin-Stay Lose-Shift. To better understand cooperation in real-world contexts,\nit is crucial to explore the theory of direct reciprocity in asynchronous\ninteractions. To address this, we introduce a framework based on asynchronous\nstochastic games, incorporating asynchronous decisions and dynamic\nenvironmental feedback. We analytically derive the conditions under which\nstrategies form cooperative Nash equilibria. Our results demonstrate that the\norder of interactions can significantly alter outcomes: interaction asynchrony\ngenerally inhibits cooperation, except under specific conditions where\nenvironmental feedback effectively mitigates its negative impact. When\nenvironmental feedback is incorporated, a variety of stable reciprocal\nstrategies can be sustained. Notably, above a critical environmental threshold,\nany cooperative strategy can form a Nash equilibrium. Overall, our work\nunderscores the importance of interaction order in long-term evolutionary\nprocesses and highlights the pivotal role of environmental feedback in\nstabilizing cooperation in asynchronous interactions.",

    "abstract": "It is known that the amplification factor, defined as the ratio of the lensed\nto the unlensed waveform in the frequency domain, satisfies the Kramers-Kronig\n(KK) relation, which connects the real and imaginary parts of the amplification\nfactor for any lensing signal. In this work, we reformulate the KK relation in\nterms of the magnitude and phase of the amplification factor. Unlike the\noriginal formulation, the phase cannot be uniquely determined from the\nmagnitude alone due to the possible presence of a Blaschke product. While this\nambiguity does not arise in the case of a point-mass lens, it can appear in\nmore complex lens models, such as those with an NFW lens profile. As an\napplication of our formulation, we demonstrate that the leading-order behavior\nof the phase in the low-frequency regime is completely determined by the\nleading-order behavior of the magnitude in the same regime. This reproduces\nknown results from the literature, derived via low-frequency expansions for\nspecific lens models. Importantly, our result does not rely on any particular\nlens model, highlighting a universal feature that the low-frequency behavior of\nthe amplification factor is tightly constrained by the KK relation. As a\nfurther application, we present two examples in which the phase is constructed\nfrom a given analytic form of the magnitude using the newly derived KK\nrelation. In particular, the second example allows for an analytic evaluation\nof the KK integral, yielding an explicit expression for the phase. This study\noffers a potentially powerful method for applying the KK relation in\nmodel-agnostic searches for lensing signals.",

Little attention has been given to wireless\nPFL (WPFL), where privacy concerns arise. Performance fairness of PL models is\nanother challenge resulting from communication bottlenecks in WPFL. This paper\nexploits quantization errors to enhance the privacy of WPFL and proposes a\nnovel quantization-assisted Gaussian differential privacy (DP) mechanism. We\nanalyze the convergence upper bounds of individual PL models by considering the\nimpact of the mechanism (i.e., quantization errors and Gaussian DP noises) and\nimperfect communication channels on the FL of WPFL. By minimizing the maximum\nof the bounds, we design an optimal transmission scheduling strategy that\nyields min-max fairness for WPFL with OFDMA interfaces. This is achieved by\nrevealing the nested structure of this problem to decouple it into subproblems\nsolved sequentially for the client selection, channel allocation, and power\ncontrol, and for the learning rates and PL-FL weighting coefficients.\nExperiments validate our analysis and demonstrate that our approach\nsubstantially outperforms alternative scheduling strategies by 87.08%, 16.21%,\nand 38.37% in accuracy, the maximum test loss of participating clients, and\nfairness (Jain's index), respectively.",

Given the cost of waveguides, we consider\na scenario where the waveguide is not deployed in all rooms, i.e., some users\nare beyond the line-of-sight (LoS) link service area of the PASS. Specifically,\nwe consider a PASS where a pinching antenna in one room serves two users\nlocated in separate rooms.

Closed-form expressions for the outage probabilities (OPs) of the\ntwo users are derived for the considered system. Furthermore, asymptotic\nanalyses in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime are performed to reveal\nthe achievable diversity orders. Numerical simulations validate the accuracy of\nthe theoretical analysis and show that: 1) compared with conventional antenna\nsystems (CASS), the OP of the LoS user in PASS is significantly reduced for\nboth OMA and NOMA schemes in the middle SNR regime and approaches zero as the\nSNR increases; 2) since the diversity orders of the NLoS user in CASS and PASS\nare the same, the movement of the pinching antenna has no significant effect on\nthe OP of the NLoS user for the OMA and NOMA scenarios.",

To address these limitations, this\nletter proposes a passive VLP algorithm based on Multi-Camera Joint\nOptimization (MCJO). In the considered system, multiple ceiling-mounted\npre-calibrated cameras continuously capture images of targets with unmodulated\npoint light sources, and can simultaneously localize these targets at the\nserver. In particular, MCJO comprises two stages: It first estimates target\npositions via linear least squares (LLS) from multi-view projection rays; then\nrefines these positions through nonlinear joint optimization to minimize the\nreprojection error. Simulation results show that MCJO can achieve\nmillimeter-level accuracy, with an improvement of 19% over an LLS-based\nstate-of-the-art algorithm. Experimental results further show that MCJO\nachieves an average position error as low as 5.63 mm.",

The\ntransmission coefficients of each metasurface layer are trained using the\nmini-batch stochastic gradient descent method to minimize the cross-entropy\nloss. To reduce computational complexity during diffraction calculation, the\nangular spectrum method (ASM) is adopted in place of the Rayleigh-Sommerfeld\nformula. Extensive simulations demonstrate that BBF-E2E achieves robust symbol\ntransmission under challenging channel conditions with significantly reduced\nhardware requirements. In particular, the proposed system matches the\nperformance of a conventional multi-antenna system with 81 RF chains while\nrequiring only a single RF chain and 1024 passive elements of metasurfaces.\nThese results highlight the potential of wave-domain neural computing to\nreplace digital baseband modules in future wireless transceivers.",

Currently, to avoid misinformation and ensure\naccountability, a lot of research on detection and attribution is emerging.\nAlthough these methods demonstrate promise in single-stage manipulation\nscenarios, they fall short when addressing complex real-world iterative\nmanipulation. In this paper, we are the first, to the best of our knowledge, to\nsystematically model this real-world challenge and introduce a novel method to\nsolve it. We define a task called \"Modelship Attribution\", which aims to trace\nthe evolution of manipulated images by identifying the generative models\ninvolved and reconstructing the sequence of edits they performed. To\nrealistically simulate this scenario, we utilize three generative models,\nStyleMapGAN, DiffSwap, and FacePartsSwap, that sequentially modify distinct\nregions of the same image. This process leads to the creation of the first\nmodelship dataset, comprising 83,700 images (16,740 images*5). Given that later\nedits often overwrite the fingerprints of earlier models, the focus shifts from\nextracting blended fingerprints to characterizing each model's distinctive\nediting patterns. To tackle this challenge, we introduce the modelship\nattribution transformer (MAT), a purpose-built framework designed to\neffectively recognize and attribute the contributions of various models within\ncomplex, multi-stage manipulation workflows. Through extensive experiments and\ncomparative analysis with other related methods, our results, including\ncomprehensive ablation studies, demonstrate that the proposed approach is a\nhighly effective solution for modelship attribution.",

Moreover, to achieve steady convergence,\nwe design a target characteristic inspired loss function (DpT-k loss) by\nintegrating physical and mathematical constraints. Experimental results on\nthree benchmark datasets (e.g. NUAA-SIRST, IRSTD-1k, DenseSIRST) demonstrate\nthat our RRCA-Net can achieve comparable performance to the state-of-the-art\nmethods while maintaining a small number of parameters, and act as a plug and\nplay module to introduce consistent performance improvement for several popular\nIRSTD methods.

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in Vision Language Models (VLMs) have expanded their\ncapabilities to interactive agent tasks, yet existing benchmarks remain limited\nto single-agent or text-only environments. In contrast, real-world scenarios\noften involve multiple agents interacting within rich visual and linguistic\ncontexts, posing challenges with both multimodal observations and strategic\ninteractions. To bridge this gap, we introduce Visual Strategic Bench\n(VS-Bench), a multimodal benchmark that evaluates VLMs for strategic reasoning\nand decision-making in multi-agent environments. VS-Bench comprises eight\nvision-grounded environments spanning cooperative, competitive, and\nmixed-motive interactions, designed to assess agents' ability to predict\nothers' future moves and optimize for long-term objectives. We consider two\ncomplementary evaluation dimensions, including offline evaluation of strategic\nreasoning by next-action prediction accuracy and online evaluation of\ndecision-making by normalized episode return. Extensive experiments of fourteen\nleading VLMs reveal a significant gap between current models and optimal\nperformance, with the best models attaining 47.8% prediction accuracy and 24.3%\nnormalized return. We further conduct in-depth analyses on multimodal\nobservations, test-time scaling, social behaviors, and failure cases of VLM\nagents. By standardizing the evaluation and highlighting the limitations of\nexisting models, we envision VS-Bench as a foundation for future research on\nstrategic multimodal agents.

    "abstract": "The challenge of identifying the best feasible arm within a fixed budget has\nattracted considerable interest in recent years. However, a notable gap remains\nin the literature: the exact exponential rate at which the error probability\napproaches zero has yet to be established, even in the relatively simple\nsetting of $K$-armed bandits with Gaussian noise. In this paper, we address\nthis gap by examining the problem within the context of linear bandits. We\nintroduce a novel algorithm for best feasible arm identification that\nguarantees an exponential decay in the error probability. Remarkably, the decay\nrate -- characterized by the exponent -- matches the theoretical lower bound\nderived using information-theoretic principles. Our approach leverages a\nposterior sampling framework embedded within a game-based sampling rule\ninvolving a min-learner and a max-learner. This strategy shares its foundations\nwith Thompson sampling, but is specifically tailored to optimize the\nidentification process under fixed-budget constraints. Furthermore, we validate\nthe effectiveness of our algorithm through comprehensive empirical evaluations\nacross various problem instances with different levels of complexity. The\nresults corroborate our theoretical findings and demonstrate that our method\noutperforms several benchmark algorithms in terms of both accuracy and\nefficiency.",

We demonstrate that a multi-agent Markov decision process\n(MDP) permits value decomposition if and only if its transition matrix is not\n\"entangled\" -- a concept analogous to quantum entanglement in quantum physics.\nDrawing inspiration from how physicists measure quantum entanglement, we\nintroduce how to measure the \"Markov entanglement\" for multi-agent MDPs and\nshow that this measure can be used to bound the decomposition error in general\nmulti-agent MDPs.\n  Using the concept of Markov entanglement, we proved that a widely-used class\nof index policies is weakly entangled and enjoys a sublinear $\\mathcal\nO(\\sqrt{N})$ scale of decomposition error for $N$-agent systems.

The upgraded version of the tracking\nsystem, called ITS2, consists of seven concentric layers of ALPIDE monolithic\nactive pixel sensors produced in the 180 nm CMOS process, covering a total\nsensitive area of about 10 m${}^2$. The ALPIDE sensor features a pixel pitch of\n27 $\\mu$m $\\times$ 29 $\\mu$m and a position resolution of about 5 $\\mu$m.

Based on this, the present work\ninvestigates the hydrogen storage on the sodium-decorated P-C$_3$N\n(Na@P-C$_3$N), a porous carbon nitride monolayer recently proposed as a stable\nsemiconductor. First-principles calculations reveal that Na atoms\npreferentially adsorb with an adsorption energy of -4.48~eV, effectively\nsuppressing clusterization effects. Upon decoration, the system becomes\nmetallic, while \\textit{ab initio} molecular dynamics simulations confirm the\nthermal stability of Na@P-C$_3$N at 300~K. Hydrogen adsorption on Na@P-C$_3$N\noccurs through weak physisorption, with energies ranging from -0.18 to\n-0.28~eV, and desorption temperatures between 231 and 357~K. The system can\nstably absorb 16 H$_2$ molecules per unit cell, corresponding to a gravimetric\nstorage capacity of 9.88~wt\\%, surpassing the U.S. Department of Energy target.\nThese results demonstrate that Na@P-C$_3$N is a promising candidate for\nlightweight, stable, and reversible hydrogen storage.",

However, existing personalization\napproaches often fail to distinguish which components of model predictions and\ntraining data truly reflect user preferences, leading to superficial\npersonalization alignment. In this paper, we introduce NextQuill, a novel LLM\npersonalization alignment framework grounded in causal preference modeling. We\napproach personalization from a causal perspective, treating both model\npredictions and ground-truth data generation as outcomes influenced by user\npreferences, along with other factors. We define the true preference effect as\nthe causal impact of user history (which reflects preferences) on each token\nprediction or data generation instance, estimated through causal intervention\ntechniques. Building on this insight, NextQuill introduces two complementary\nalignment strategies: (1) aligning model-internal causal preference effects on\npredictions with those reflected in ground-truth data, rather than\nindiscriminately fitting predictions, and (2) focusing on fitting\npreference-bearing tokens identified via ground-truth data preference effects,\nrather than treating all tokens uniformly. By integrating these strategies,\nNextQuill shifts the alignment process toward learning from causal preference\neffects, facilitating more effective and personalized adaptation.

Its MLP head is a feedforward\nnetwork, trained synchronously with the entire network in the same process,\nincreasing the training cost and difficulty without fully leveraging the power\nof the feature extractor. This paper proposes a new architecture by replacing\nthe MLP head with a neural field-based one. We first present a new static\nneural field function to describe the activity distribution of the neural field\nand then use two static neural field functions to build an efficient few-shot\nclassifier. This neural field-based (NF) classifier consists of two coupled\nstatic neural fields. It stores the feature information of support samples by\nits elementary field, the known categories by its high-level field, and the\ncategory information of support samples by its cross-field connections. We\nreplace the MLP head with the proposed NF classifier, resulting in a novel\narchitecture ViTNF, and simplify the three-stage training mode by pre-training\nthe feature extractor on source tasks and training the NF classifier with\nsupport samples in meta-testing separately, significantly reducing ViT's demand\nfor training samples and the difficulty of model training.

Furthermore,\nalternatives to fully-supervised object detection either lose functionality or\nrequire larger models with prohibitive computational costs for inference at\nscale. To that end, this paper addresses the problem of training standard\nobject detection models without any ground truth labels. Instead, we configure\npreviously-trained vision-language foundation models to generate\napplication-specific pseudo \"ground truth\" labels. These auto-generated labels\ndirectly integrate with existing model training frameworks, and we subsequently\ntrain lightweight detection models that are computationally efficient. In this\nway, we avoid the costs of traditional labeling, leverage the knowledge of\nvision-language models, and keep the efficiency of lightweight models for\npractical application. We perform exhaustive experiments across multiple\nlabeling configurations, downstream inference models, and datasets to establish\nbest practices and set an extensive auto-labeling benchmark. From our results,\nwe find that our approach is a viable alternative to standard labeling in that\nit maintains competitive performance on multiple datasets and substantially\nreduces labeling time and costs.",

    "abstract": "The classification of the type of road surface (RSC) aims to utilize pavement\nfeatures to identify the roughness, wet and dry conditions, and material\ninformation of the road surface. Due to its ability to effectively enhance road\nsafety and traffic management, it has received widespread attention in recent\nyears. In autonomous driving, accurate RSC allows vehicles to better understand\nthe road environment, adjust driving strategies, and ensure a safer and more\nefficient driving experience. For a long time, vision-based RSC has been\nfavored. However, existing visual classification methods have overlooked the\nexploration of fine-grained classification of pavement types (such as similar\npavement textures). In this work, we propose a pure vision-based fine-grained\nRSC method for autonomous driving scenarios, which fuses local and global\nfeature information through the stacking of convolutional and transformer\nmodules. We further explore the stacking strategies of local and global feature\nextraction modules to find the optimal feature extraction strategy. In\naddition, since fine-grained tasks also face the challenge of relatively large\nintra-class differences and relatively small inter-class differences, we\npropose a Foreground-Background Module (FBM) that effectively extracts\nfine-grained context features of the pavement, enhancing the classification\nability for complex pavements. Experiments conducted on a large-scale pavement\ndataset containing one million samples and a simplified dataset reorganized\nfrom this dataset achieved Top-1 classification accuracies of 92.52% and\n96.50%, respectively, improving by 5.69% to 12.84% compared to SOTA methods.\nThese results demonstrate that RoadFormer outperforms existing methods in RSC\ntasks, providing significant progress in improving the reliability of pavement\nperception in autonomous driving systems.",

    "abstract": "Referring video object segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment objects in a video\ndescribed by a natural language expression. However, most existing approaches\nfocus on segmenting only the referred object (typically the actor), even when\nthe expression clearly describes an interaction involving multiple objects with\ndistinct roles. For instance, \"A throwing B\" implies a directional interaction,\nbut standard RVOS segments only the actor (A), neglecting other involved target\nobjects (B). In this paper, we introduce Interaction-aware Referring Video\nObject Segmentation (InterRVOS), a novel task that focuses on the modeling of\ninteractions. It requires the model to segment the actor and target objects\nseparately, reflecting their asymmetric roles in an interaction. This task\nformulation enables fine-grained understanding of object relationships, as many\nvideo events are defined by such relationships rather than individual objects.\nTo support this task, we propose a new evaluation protocol that separately\nevaluates actor and target segmentation, enabling more accurate assessment of\nthe model's ability to distinguish and segment actor and target roles. We also\npresent InterRVOS-127K, a large-scale dataset with over 127K automatically\nannotated expressions, including interaction expressions annotated with\ndistinct masks for actor and target objects. Furthermore, we develop ReVIOSa,\nan MLLM-based architecture that introduces interaction-aware special tokens and\nleverages an attention mask loss to enhance role-specific segmentation.\nExtensive experiments show that ReVIOSa not only outperforms existing baselines\non our proposed InterRVOS-127K evaluation set, but also achieves strong\nperformance on standard RVOS benchmarks.

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning is emerging as a primary driver for improving language\nmodel reasoning capabilities. A fundamental question is whether current\nreinforcement learning algorithms -- such as Group Relative Policy Optimization\n(GRPO), the de facto standard algorithm used to improve language model\nreasoning -- merely sharpen the base model's distribution around problems it\ncan already solve. We investigate this question in the context of formal\ntheorem proving, which has access to a perfect verifier. We identify a\ndegenerate rank bias in GRPO in which highly probable trajectories are\nreinforced and rare ones are neglected. This results in distribution\nsharpening: the model can solve some problems with fewer samples, but\nunderperforms simply sampling more solutions from the original model. To\novercome GRPO's rank bias we introduce unlikeliness reward, a simple method for\nexplicitly up-weighting rare but correct solutions. We show that unlikeliness\nreward mitigates rank bias and improves pass@$N$ across a large range of $N$ in\nboth synthetic and real theorem proving settings. We also uncover an unexpected\nlink between rank bias and a seemingly mundane hyperparameter -- the number of\nupdates per batch -- that leads to a second, complementary mitigation. We\ncombine our insights into a revised GRPO training recipe for formal theorem\nproving, yielding an open pipeline that achieves competitive performance to\nDeepSeek-Prover-V1.5-RL on the miniF2F-test benchmark.

Meanwhile, the decoder is\nbuilt upon the backbone of PointDif. Such a cross-modal design not only ensures\nhigh compression efficiency but also delivers superior reconstruction\nperformance compared to PointDif. Moreover, to ensure robust transmission and\nreduce system complexity, we design a streamlined and asymmetric\nchannel-adaptive joint semantic-channel coding architecture, where only the\nencoder needs the feedback of average signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and available\nbandwidth. In addition, rectified denoising diffusion implicit models is\nemployed to accelerate the decoding process to the millisecond level, enabling\nreal-time PC communication. Unlike existing methods, GenSeC-PC leverages\ngenerative priors to ensure reliable reconstruction even from noisy or\nincomplete source PCs. More importantly, it supports fully analog transmission,\nimproving compression efficiency by eliminating the need for error-free side\ninformation transmission common in prior SemCom approaches.

To address this, we propose SAVOR, a novel approach for learning\nskill affordances for bite acquisition-how suitable a manipulation skill (e.g.,\nskewering, scooping) is for a given utensil-food interaction. In our\nformulation, skill affordances arise from the combination of tool affordances\n(what a utensil can do) and food affordances (what the food allows). Tool\naffordances are learned offline through calibration, where different utensils\ninteract with a variety of foods to model their functional capabilities. Food\naffordances are characterized by physical properties such as softness,\nmoisture, and viscosity, initially inferred through commonsense reasoning using\na visually-conditioned language model and then dynamically refined through\nonline multi-modal visuo-haptic perception using SAVOR-Net during interaction.\nOur method integrates these offline and online estimates to predict skill\naffordances in real time, enabling the robot to select the most appropriate\nskill for each food item. Evaluated on 20 single-item foods and 10 in-the-wild\nmeals, our approach improves bite acquisition success rate by 13% over\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) category-based methods (e.g. use skewer for fruits).\nThese results highlight the importance of modeling interaction-driven skill\naffordances for generalizable and effective robot-assisted bite acquisition.\nWebsite: https://emprise.cs.cornell.edu/savor/",

Storyteller introduces a plot node structure\nbased on linguistically grounded subject verb object (SVO) triplets, which\ncapture essential story events and ensure a consistent logical flow. Unlike\nprevious methods, Storyteller integrates two dynamic modules, the STORYLINE and\nnarrative entity knowledge graph (NEKG),that continuously interact with the\nstory generation process. This integration produces structurally sound,\ncohesive and immersive narratives. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nStoryteller significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving an 84.33%\naverage win rate through human preference evaluation. At the same time, it is\nalso far ahead in other aspects including creativity, coherence, engagement,\nand relevance.",

    "abstract": "New edition of the review [EPJA 48, (2012) 152]. The increase in\ncomputational power has naturally led to new applications of mean-field (and\nbeyond) methods. This is particularly the case of quasi-fission reactions.\nSince the first edition, significant progress has also been made in treating\npairing correlations dynamically, leading to realistic applications in\nmulti-nucleon transfer, fusion and fission reactions. A new section has been\nadded on fission dynamics. A summary of recent researches on nuclear dynamics\nwith realistic microscopic quantum approaches is presented. The Balian-Veneroni\nvariational principle is used to derive the time-dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF)\nequation describing the dynamics at the mean-field level, as well as an\nextension including small-amplitude quantum fluctuations which is equivalent to\nthe time-dependent random-phase approximation (TDRPA). Such formalisms as well\nas their practical implementation in the nuclear physics framework with modern\nthree-dimensional codes are discussed. Recent applications to nuclear dynamics,\nfrom collective vibrations to heavy-ion collisions are presented. A particular\nattention is devoted to the interplay between collective motions and internal\ndegrees of freedom. For instance, the harmonic nature of collective vibrations\nis questioned. Large amplitude collective motions are investigated in the\nframework of heavy-ion collisions and fission. How fusion is affected by the\ninternal structure of the collision partners, such as their deformation, is\ndiscussed. Other mechanisms in competition with fusion, and responsible for the\nformation of fragments which differ from the entrance channel (transfer\nreactions, deep-inelastic collisions, and quasi-fission) are investigated.\nFinally, studies of actinide collisions forming, during very short times of few\nzeptoseconds, the heaviest nuclear systems available on Earth, are presented.",

We\nargue that it should evaluate the real-world coverage of a technique. Yet,\nreal-world coverage is not sufficient for a useful benchmark, and so we also:\ncleaned it from irrelevant code, adapted it for benchmark usage, and introduced\ninput scaling. We claim that uniform scaling used in other benchmarks (e.g.,\nTPC-H) is too coarse-grained for PandasBench, and use a non-uniform scaling\nscheme. PandasBench is the largest Pandas API benchmark to date, with 102\nnotebooks and 3,721 cells.\n  We used PandasBench to evaluate Modin, Dask, Koalas, and Dias. This is the\nlargest-scale evaluation of all these techniques to date. Prior works report\nsignificant speedups using constrained benchmarks, but we show that on a larger\nbenchmark with real-world code, the most notebooks that got a speedup were\n8/102 (~8%) for Modin, and 0 for both Koalas and Dask. Dias showed speedups in\nup to 55 notebooks (~54%), but it rewrites code incorrectly in certain cases,\nwhich had not been observed in prior work.

The alkali tail photoionization model provides a Na/K\nratio close to the solar value. No lithium was detected in any comet: the lower\nlimit of the Na/Li ratio was almost one order of magnitude greater than the\nsolar ratio. Here we searched for the emissions of the alkali NaI, KI, and LiI\nin Comets C/2020 F3 and C/2024 G3. High-resolution spectra of the comets were\ntaken with the 0.84 m telescope at the Schiaparelli Observatory at rh = 0.36\nand 0.15 au, the observations closest to the Sun since Ikeya-Seki. To model the\ndata, we assumed that alkali phenoxides are present in the aromatic fraction of\norganic dust at the nucleus surface where they react with carbon dioxide\nejecting alkali atoms. NaI and KI were detected in emission lines of\nexceptional intensity in both comets, with no evidence of LiI emission. The\nNaI/KI ratios were determined: 31 +/- 5 and 26 +/- 8, whereas solar Na/K = 15.\nThis excess and its observed trend with the heliocentric distance are\nconsistent with chemistry between CO2 and alkali phenoxides at the nucleus\nsurface. The Li upper limit for comet C/2020 F3 is very stringent at Na/Li >\n3.4 10^4, a factor of 34 greater than the solar value. This Li depletion is\nconsistent with the reaction rate of lithium phenoxides, which is a factor of\n10^4 slower than sodium phenoxides. The widespread chemistry of carbon dioxide\nwith organic dust may provide a significant energy and mass sink of carbon\ndioxide in all comets also at rh > 1 au, reconciling recent models of cometary\nactivity with Rosetta CO2 measurements. At rh < 0.5 au potassium was observed\nin all comets, so that we predict the formation of a KI tail spatially resolved\nfrom the NaI tail.",

Building on these developments, the Black Hole-Tower correspondence aims\nto provide a unified thermodynamic framework that describes black hole entropy\nin terms of the spectrum of the lightest degrees of freedom across various\nperturbative regimes of quantum gravity theories. In those regimes,\nthermodynamic consistency of such transition imposes stringent constraints on\nthe spectrum, in agreement with string theory predictions. This defines the\nbasis of the so-called Species Thermodynamics.\n  In this review, we emphasize these recent advances and synthesize their\nimplications, offering an overview of how the outlined correspondence, the\nspecies scale and related thermodynamic principles enhance our understanding of\nblack hole entropy within the effective field theory framework.",

    "abstract": "Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) aims to identify unlabeled samples by\nleveraging the base knowledge from labeled ones, where the unlabeled set\nconsists of both base and novel classes. Since clustering methods are\ntime-consuming at inference, parametric-based approaches have become more\npopular. However, recent parametric-based methods suffer from inferior base\ndiscrimination due to unreliable self-supervision. To address this issue, we\npropose a Reciprocal Learning Framework (RLF) that introduces an auxiliary\nbranch devoted to base classification. During training, the main branch filters\nthe pseudo-base samples to the auxiliary branch. In response, the auxiliary\nbranch provides more reliable soft labels for the main branch, leading to a\nvirtuous cycle. Furthermore, we introduce Class-wise Distribution\nRegularization (CDR) to mitigate the learning bias towards base classes. CDR\nessentially increases the prediction confidence of the unlabeled data and\nboosts the novel class performance. Combined with both components, our proposed\nmethod, RLCD, achieves superior performance in all classes with negligible\nextra computation. Comprehensive experiments across seven GCD datasets validate\nits superiority. Our codes are available at https://github.com/APORduo/RLCD.",

    "abstract": "On a Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) field, optical errors have significant\nimpacts on the collection efficiency of heliostats. Fast, cost-effective,\nlabor-efficient, and non-intrusive autonomous field inspection remains a\nchallenge. Approaches using imaging drone, i.e., Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)\nsystem integrated with high resolution visible imaging sensors, have been\ndeveloped to address these challenges; however, these approaches are often\nlimited by insufficient imaging contrast. Here we report a polarimetry-based\nmethod with a polarization imaging system integrated on UAV to enhance imaging\ncontrast for in-situ detection of heliostat mirrors without interrupting field\noperation. We developed an optical model for skylight polarization pattern to\nsimulate the polarization images of heliostat mirrors and obtained optimized\nwaypoints for polarimetric imaging drone flight path to capture images with\nenhanced contrast. The polarimetric imaging-based method improved the success\nrate of edge detections in scenarios which were challenging for mirror edge\ndetection with conventional imaging sensors. We have performed field tests to\nachieve significantly enhanced heliostat edge detection success rate and\ninvestigate the feasibility of integrating polarimetric imaging method with\nexisting imaging-based heliostat inspection methods, i.e., Polarimetric Imaging\nHeliostat Inspection Method (PIHIM). Our preliminary field test results suggest\nthat the PIHIM hold the promise to enable sufficient imaging contrast for\nreal-time autonomous imaging and detection of heliostat field, thus suitable\nfor non-interruptive fast CSP field inspection during its operation.",

    "abstract": "A 1952 result of Davenport and Erd\\H{o}s states that if $p$ is an\ninteger-valued polynomial, then the real number $0.p(1)p(2)p(3)\\dots$ is Borel\nnormal in base ten. A later result of Nakai and Shiokawa extends this result to\npolynomials with arbitrary real coefficients and all bases $b\\geq 2$. It is\nwell-known that finite-state dimension, a finite-state effectivization of the\nclassical Hausdorff dimension, characterizes the Borel normal sequences as\nprecisely those sequences of finite-state dimension 1. For an infinite set of\nnatural numbers, and a base $b\\geq 2$, the base $b$ Copeland-Erd\\H{o}s sequence\nof $A$, $CE_b(A)$, is the infinite sequence obtained by concatenating the base\n$b$ expressions of the numbers in $A$ in increasing order. In this work we\ninvestigate the possible relationships between the finite-state dimensions of\n$CE_b(A)$ and $CE_b(p(A))$ where $p$ is a polynomial. We show that, if the\npolynomial is permitted to have arbitrary real coefficients, then for any\n$s,s^\\prime$ in the unit interval, there is a set $A$ of natural numbers and a\nlinear polynomial $p$ so that the finite-state dimensions of $CE_b(A)$ and\n$CE_b(p(A))$ are $s$ and $s^\\prime$ respectively. We also demonstrate that\nlinear polynomials with rational coefficients do not change the finite-state\ndimension of any Copeland-Erd\\H{o}s sequence, but there exist polynomials with\nrational coefficients of every larger integer degree that change the\nfinite-state dimension of some sequence. To prove our main results, we develop\ntechniques involving taking concatenated prefixes of a sequence as well as\ninserting a density zero set of strings into a sequence that may be of\nindependent interest.",
