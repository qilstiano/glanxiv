    "abstract": "Nodes in contemporary radio networks often have multiple interfaces available\nfor communication: WiFi, cellular, LoRa, Zigbee, etc. This motivates\nunderstanding both link and network configuration when multiple communication\nmodalities with vastly different capabilities are available to each node. In\nconjunction, covertness or the hiding of radio communications is often a\nsignificant concern in both commercial and military wireless networks. We\nconsider the optimal routing problem in wireless networks when nodes have\nmultiple interfaces available and intend to hide the presence of the\ntransmission from attentive and capable adversaries. We first consider the\nmaximization of the route capacity given an end-to-end covertness constraint\nagainst a single adversary and we find a polynomial-time algorithm for optimal\nroute selection and link configuration. We further provide optimal\npolynomial-time algorithms for two important extensions: (i) statistical\nuncertainty during optimization about the channel state information for\nchannels from system nodes to the adversary; and, (ii) maintaining covertness\nagainst multiple adversaries. Numerical results are included to demonstrate the\ngains of employing heterogeneous radio resources and to compare the performance\nof the proposed approach versus alternatives.",

    "abstract": "Graph states are fundamental objects in the theory of quantum information due\nto their simple classical description and rich entanglement structure. They are\nalso intimately related to IQP circuits, which have applications in quantum\npseudorandomness and quantum advantage. For us, they are a toy model to\nunderstand the relation between circuit connectivity, entanglement structure\nand computational complexity. In the worst case, a strict dichotomy in the\ncomputational universality of such graph states appears as a function of the\ndegree $d$ of a regular graph state [GDH+23]. In this paper, we initiate the\nstudy of the average-case complexity of simulating random graph states of\nvarying degree when measured in random product bases and give distinct evidence\nthat a similar complexity-theoretic dichotomy exists in the average case.\nSpecifically, we consider random $d$-regular graph states and prove three\ndistinct results: First, we exhibit two families of IQP circuits of depth $d$\nand show that they anticoncentrate for any $2 < d = o(n)$ when measured in a\nrandom $X$-$Y$-plane product basis. This implies anticoncentration for random\nconstant-regular graph states. Second, in the regime $d = \\Theta(n^c)$ with $c\n\\in (0,1)$, we prove that random $d$-regular graph states contain polynomially\nlarge grid graphs as induced subgraphs with high probability. This implies that\nthey are universal resource states for measurement-based computation. Third, in\nthe regime of high degree ($d\\sim n/2$), we show that random graph states are\nnot sufficiently entangled to be trivially classically simulable, unlike Haar\nrandom states. Proving the three results requires different techniques--the\nanalysis of a classical statistical-mechanics model using Krawtchouck\npolynomials, graph theoretic analysis using the switching method, and analysis\nof the ranks of submatrices of random adjacency matrices, respectively.",

We compute the correlations between four host halo\nproperties (half-mass scale, concentration, peak-mass scale, and spin) and the\noutlying halo occupation out to 1.5 Mpc for Milky Way-mass host halos, and\nstudy how the correlation strength varies with radius. We also investigate if\nthe outlying halo occupation can provide information about the host halo\nproperties. We find that host halo properties impact the neighboring halo\nabundance beyond the virial radius, and the locations at which the correlation\npeaks do not typically align with the virial radius or splashback radius. The\nbehavior of this observed correlation as a function of radius, especially in\nthe outskirts, is connected to the effect of halo assembly bias. However, there\nis no universal behavior when considering different host halo properties. Our\nresults are the first to quantify the occupation variation of outlying halos\nbeyond the virial radius.

    "abstract": "Classifying genome sequences based on metadata has been an active area of\nresearch in comparative genomics for decades with many important applications\nacross the life sciences. Established methods for classifying genomes can be\nbroadly grouped into sequence alignment-based and alignment-free models.\nConventional alignment-based models rely on genome similarity measures\ncalculated based on local sequence alignments or consistent ordering among\nsequences. However, such methods are computationally expensive when dealing\nwith large ensembles of even moderately sized genomes. In contrast,\nalignment-free (AF) approaches measure genome similarity based on summary\nstatistics in an unsupervised setting and are efficient enough to analyze large\ndatasets. However, both alignment-based and AF methods typically assume fixed\nscoring rubrics that lack the flexibility to assign varying importance to\ndifferent parts of the sequences based on prior knowledge. In this study, we\nintegrate AI and network science approaches to develop a comparative genomic\nanalysis framework that addresses these limitations. Our approach, termed the\nGenome Misclassification Network Analysis (GMNA), simultaneously leverages\nmisclassified instances, a learned scoring rubric, and label information to\nclassify genomes based on associated metadata and better understand potential\ndrivers of misclassification. We evaluate the utility of the GMNA using Naive\nBayes and convolutional neural network models, supplemented by additional\nexperiments with transformer-based models, to construct SARS-CoV-2 sampling\nlocation classifiers using over 500,000 viral genome sequences and study the\nresulting network of misclassifications.

For data with spatial or temporal side information,\nlow-rank factorization models with smoothness constraints have demonstrated\nstrong performance. Although effective at capturing global and long-range\ncorrelations, these models often struggle to capture short-scale,\nhigh-frequency variations in the data. To address this limitation, we propose\nthe Generalized Least Squares Kernelized Tensor Factorization (GLSKF) framework\nfor tensor completion. GLSKF integrates smoothness-constrained low-rank\nfactorization with a locally correlated residual process; the resulting\nadditive structure enables effective characterization of both global\ndependencies and local variations. Specifically, we define the covariance norm\nto enforce the smoothness of factor matrices in the global low-rank\nfactorization, and use structured covariance/kernel functions to model the\nlocal processes. For model estimation, we develop an alternating least squares\n(ALS) procedure with closed-form solutions for each subproblem. GLSKF utilizes\nzero-padding and slicing operations based on projection matrices which preserve\nthe Kronecker structure of covariances, facilitating efficient computations\nthrough the conjugate gradient (CG) method. The proposed framework is evaluated\non four real-world datasets across diverse tasks.

Distributed tracing gives us visibility into\nthese complex interactions, but it can be difficult to reason about the\nsystem's behavior, even with traces. Systems collect large amounts of tracing\ndata even with low sampling rates. Even when there are patterns in the system,\nit is often difficult to detect similarities in traces since current tools\nmainly allow developers to visualize individual traces. Debugging and system\noptimization is difficult for developers without an understanding of the whole\ntrace dataset. In order to help present these similarities, this paper proposes\na method to aggregate traces in a way that groups together and visualizes\nsimilar traces.

We suggest that traces can be grouped based on how many services they\nshare, how many levels the graph has, how structurally similar they are, or how\nclose their latencies are. We also develop an aggregate trace data structure as\na way to comprehensively visualize these groups and a method for filtering out\nincomplete traces if a more complete version of the trace exists.

For these languages,\nstill in their infancy, several possibilities exist to address this critical\nlack of data. Among them is Transfer Learning, which allows low-resource\nlanguages to benefit from the good representation of other languages that are\nsimilar to them. In this work, we adopt a similar approach, aiming to pioneer\nNLP technologies for Comorian, a group of four languages or dialects belonging\nto the Bantu family.\n  Our approach is initially motivated by the hypothesis that if a human can\nunderstand a different language from their native language with little or no\neffort, it would be entirely possible to model this process on a machine. To\nachieve this, we consider ways to construct Comorian datasets mixed with\nSwahili. One thing to note here is that in terms of Swahili data, we only focus\non elements that are closest to Comorian by calculating lexical distances\nbetween candidate and source data. We empirically test this hypothesis in two\nuse cases: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and Machine Translation (MT). Our\nMT model achieved ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, and ROUGE-L scores of 0.6826, 0.42, and\n0.6532, respectively, while our ASR system recorded a WER of 39.50\\% and a CER\nof 13.76\\%.

    "abstract": "Multimodal multihop question answering (MMQA) requires reasoning over images\nand text from multiple sources. Despite advances in visual question answering,\nthis multihop setting remains underexplored due to a lack of quality datasets.\nExisting methods focus on single-hop, single-modality, or short texts, limiting\nreal-world applications like interpreting educational documents with long,\nmultimodal content. To fill this gap, we introduce FM2DS, the first framework\nfor creating a high-quality dataset for MMQA. Our approach consists of a\n5-stage pipeline that involves acquiring relevant multimodal documents from\nWikipedia, synthetically generating high-level questions and answers, and\nvalidating them through rigorous criteria to ensure data quality. We evaluate\nour methodology by training models on our synthesized dataset and testing on\ntwo benchmarks: MultimodalQA and WebQA. Our results demonstrate that, with an\nequal sample size, models trained on our synthesized data outperform those\ntrained on human-collected data by 1.9 in exact match (EM) score on average.\nAdditionally, we introduce M2QA-Bench with 1k samples, the first benchmark for\nMMQA on long documents, generated using FM2DS and refined by human annotators.\nWe believe our data synthesis method will serve as a strong foundation for\ntraining and evaluating MMQA models.",

However, the\nextensive lookahead roll-out operations for each generated token makes CDLH\nprohibitively expensive, resulting in low adoption in practice.

We propose constrained decoding with\nspeculative lookaheads (CDSL), a technique that significantly improves upon the\ninference efficiency of CDLH without experiencing the drastic performance\nreduction seen with greedy decoding. CDSL is motivated by the recently proposed\nidea of speculative decoding that uses a much smaller draft LLM for generation\nand a larger target LLM for verification. In CDSL, the draft model is used to\ngenerate lookaheads which is verified by a combination of target LLM and\ntask-specific reward functions. This process accelerates decoding by reducing\nthe computational burden while maintaining strong performance. We evaluate CDSL\nin two constraint decoding tasks with three LLM families and achieve 2.2x to\n12.15x speedup over CDLH without significant performance reduction.",

This\nprevents them from modeling full patient EHRs which can exceed 10k's of events.\nRecent advancements in subquadratic long-context architectures (e.g., Mamba)\noffer a promising solution. However, their application to EHR data has not been\nwell-studied. We address this gap by presenting the first systematic evaluation\nof the effect of context length on modeling EHR data. We find that longer\ncontext models improve predictive performance -- our Mamba-based model\nsurpasses the prior state-of-the-art on 9/14 tasks on the EHRSHOT prediction\nbenchmark. For clinical applications, however, model performance alone is\ninsufficient -- robustness to the unique properties of EHR is crucial. Thus, we\nalso evaluate models across three previously underexplored properties of EHR\ndata: (1) the prevalence of \"copy-forwarded\" diagnoses which creates artificial\nrepetition of tokens within EHR sequences; (2) the irregular time intervals\nbetween EHR events which can lead to a wide range of timespans within a context\nwindow; and (3) the natural increase in disease complexity over time which\nmakes later tokens in the EHR harder to predict than earlier ones. Stratifying\nour EHRSHOT results, we find that higher levels of each property correlate\nnegatively with model performance, but that longer context models are more\nrobust to more extreme levels of these properties.

Machine learning surrogate models have\nemerged as promising alternatives to traditional methods, offering\nsubstantially reduced computational time. Nevertheless, these models typically\ndemand extensive training datasets to achieve robust generalization across\ndiverse scenarios. While physics-based approaches can partially mitigate this\ndata dependency and ensure physics-interpretable solutions, addressing scarce\ndata regimes remains a challenge. Both purely data-driven and physics-based\nmachine learning approaches demonstrate severe overfitting issues when trained\nwith insufficient data. We propose a novel Tikhonov autoencoder\nmodel-constrained framework, called TAE, capable of learning both forward and\ninverse surrogate models using a single arbitrary observation sample. We\ndevelop comprehensive theoretical foundations including forward and inverse\ninference error bounds for the proposed approach for linear cases. For\ncomparative analysis, we derive equivalent formulations for pure data-driven\nand model-constrained approach counterparts. At the heart of our approach is a\ndata randomization strategy, which functions as a generative mechanism for\nexploring the training data space, enabling effective training of both forward\nand inverse surrogate models from a single observation, while regularizing the\nlearning process. We validate our approach through extensive numerical\nexperiments on two challenging inverse problems: 2D heat conductivity inversion\nand initial condition reconstruction for time-dependent 2D Navier-Stokes\nequations.

    "abstract": "The theory of jet emitting disks (JEDs) provides a mathematical framework for\na self-consistent treatment of steady-state accretion and ejection. A\nlarge-scale vertical magnetic field threads the accretion disk where magnetic\nturbulence occurs in a strongly magnetized plasma. A fraction of mass leaves\nthe disk and feeds the two laminar super-Alf\\'enic jets. In previous treatments\nof JEDs, the disk turbulence has been considered to provide only anomalous\ntransport coefficients, namely magnetic diffusivities and viscosity. However,\n3D numerical experiments show that turbulent magnetic pressure also sets in. We\nincluded this additional pressure term using a prescription that is consistent\nwith the latest 3D global (and local) simulations. We then solved the complete\nsystem of self-similar magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations, accounting for all\ndynamical terms. The disk becomes puffier and less electrically conductive,\ncausing radial and toroidal electric currents to flow at the disk surface.\nField lines within the disk become straighter, with their bending and shearing\noccurring mainly at the surface. Accretion remains supersonic, but becomes\nfaster at the disk surface. Large values of both turbulent pressure and\nmagnetic diffusivities allow powerful jets to be driven, and their combined\neffects have a constructive influence. Nevertheless, cold outflows do not seem\nto be able to reproduce mass-loss rates as large as those observed in numerical\nsimulations. Our results are a major upgrade of the JED theory, allowing a\ndirect comparison with full 3D global numerical simulations. We argue that JEDs\nprovide a state-of-the-art mathematical description of the disk configurations\nobserved in numerical simulations, commonly referred to as magnetically\narrested disks (MADs). However, further efforts from both theoretical and\nnumerical perspectives are needed to firmly establish this point.",

The\nmain idea of this study is to control the adhesion by changing the mechanical\nproperties (modulus) of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) elastomer. We vary the\nmodulus of PDMS elastomer by changing the mixing ratio of silicone elastomer\nbase mixing ratio and its curing agent (Sylgard 184, Dow Corning).

Here, we analyze four large-scale datasets that capture the temporal\nand structural patterns of innovation abandonment across scientific,\ntechnological, commercial, and pharmacological domains. The paper makes three\nprimary contributions. First, across these diverse domains, we uncover one\nsimple pattern of preferential abandonment, whereby the probability for\nindividuals or organizations to abandon an innovation increases with time and\ncorrelates with the number of network neighbors who have abandoned the\ninnovation. Second, we find that the presence of preferential abandonment\nfundamentally alters the way in which the underlying ecosystem breaks down,\ninducing a novel structural collapse in networked systems commonly perceived as\nrobust against abandonments. Third, we derive an analytical framework to\nsystematically understand the impact of preferential abandonment on network\ndynamics, pinpointing specific conditions where it may accelerate, decelerate,\nor have an identical effect compared to random abandonment, depending on the\nnetwork topology. Together, these results deepen our quantitative understanding\nof the abandonment of innovation within networked social systems, with\nimplications for the robustness and functioning of innovation communities.\nOverall, they demonstrate that the dynamics of innovation abandonment follow\nsimple yet reproducible patterns, suggesting that the uncovered preferential\nabandonment may be a generic property of the innovation lifecycle.",

We describe two related\nstrategies, one where the contact line is tracked explicitly and one where it\nis captured implicitly, and show that both approaches achieve comparable\naccuracy.

    "abstract": "The presence, distribution and kinematics of atomic neutral hydrogen in the\ncentral regions of galaxies can be traced by the HI 21~cm line observed in\nabsorption. Depending only on the strength of the radio continuum, the\nassociated absorption can trace the gas down to pc scale, which is ideal for\nexploring the HI in the nuclear regions of radio AGN. This paper gives a brief\noverview of the main recent findings with particular focus on the AGN-driven HI\noutflows. Absorption has made possible the discovery of fast and massive HI\noutflows and their clumpy structure on pc scales. The similarities with the\npredictions of numerical simulations confirm the impact of young radio jets in\nthe feedback cycle and galaxy evolution. The field of HI absorption is rapidly\nexpanding thanks to new ``blind\" surveys and the increased spectral\ncapabilities of the radio telescopes. This opens many possibilities for future\ndiscoveries and complements the studies of HI emission.",

Using the E-DAIC\ndataset, we compare text and audio modalities to investigate whether LLMs can\nperform equally well or better with audio inputs. We further examine the\nintegration of both modalities to determine if this can enhance diagnostic\naccuracy, which generally results in improved performance metrics.

These results represent an increase of 3.1% over its performance with\nthe text modality and 2.7% over the audio modality, highlighting the\neffectiveness of integrating modalities to enhance diagnostic accuracy.\nNotably, all results are obtained in zero-shot inferring, highlighting the\nrobustness of the models without requiring task-specific fine-tuning.

This is compounded\nfor SR as it often operates at high res (e.g. 4Kx3K). In this work, we\nintroduce Edge-SD-SR, the first parameter efficient and low latency diffusion\nmodel for image super-resolution. Edge-SD-SR consists of ~169M parameters,\nincluding UNet, encoder and decoder, and has a complexity of only ~142 GFLOPs.\nTo maintain a high visual quality on such low compute budget, we introduce a\nnumber of training strategies: (i) A novel conditioning mechanism on the low\nresolution input, coined bidirectional conditioning, which tailors the SD model\nfor the SR task. (ii) Joint training of the UNet and encoder, while decoupling\nthe encodings of the HR and LR images and using a dedicated schedule. (iii)\nFinetuning the decoder using the UNet's output to directly tailor the decoder\nto the latents obtained at inference time. Edge-SD-SR runs efficiently on\ndevice, e.g. it can upscale a 128x128 patch to 512x512 in 38 msec while running\non a Samsung S24 DSP, and of a 512x512 to 2048x2048 (requiring 25 model\nevaluations) in just ~1.1 sec.

When\ndealing with more than two views, a combinatorial number of error prone\npairwise reconstructions are usually followed by an expensive global\noptimization, which often fails to rectify the pairwise reconstruction errors.\nTo handle more views, reduce errors, and improve inference time, we propose the\nfast single-stage feed-forward network MV-DUSt3R. At its core are multi-view\ndecoder blocks which exchange information across any number of views while\nconsidering one reference view. To make our method robust to reference view\nselection, we further propose MV-DUSt3R+, which employs cross-reference-view\nblocks to fuse information across different reference view choices. To further\nenable novel view synthesis, we extend both by adding and jointly training\nGaussian splatting heads. Experiments on multi-view stereo reconstruction,\nmulti-view pose estimation, and novel view synthesis confirm that our methods\nimprove significantly upon prior art. Code will be released.",

The samples have been operated in reverse and forward bias, which is\npossible due to the heavily decreased forward current after irradiation.\nPrevious studies have already hinted at an excessive charge collection in\nforward bias, even exceeding a charge collection efficiency (CCE) of 100%. In\nthis work, the excessive CCE in forward bias was shown to correlate heavily\nwith the spatial profile of injected charge. For a sufficiently focused laser,\nthe CCE starts to increase at high forward bias and even surpasses 100% instead\nof saturating as it does for a defocused laser beam. In reverse bias, the CCE\nwas found to be independent of the beam spot size. For samples irradiated to\nhigh fluences ($\\geq 1\\times 10^{15}$ $\\text{n}_{\\text{eq.}}/\\text{cm}^2$) the\nexcessive CCE in forward bias is smaller and negligible at the highest\nfluences.\n  Additionally, the CCE was observed to correlate to the rate of charge\ninjection (laser pulses per second), with a logarithmic increase of the\ncollected charge if a threshold of injected carrier density is exceeded. The\nmechanism of these effects is still an ongoing topic of study, however, the\nobservations already pose implications for the accurate experimental\ncharacterization of irradiated SiC detectors.",

    "abstract": "It is well known that departure from sphericity in the geometry of primordial\ndark matter halos modifies their mass function. The ellipsoidal collapse model\nyields a better agreement with simulations of hierarchical clustering than the\noriginal, spherical model. In the present paper, we examine the same issue in\nthe context of star formation by studying the impact of non-sphericity of\ndensity perturbations in a gravoturbulent medium on the prestellar core mass\nfunction (CMF). An important question, notably, is to find out how ellipsoidal,\ninstead of spherical, initial density fluctuations modify both the high-mass\nand low-mass tails of the CMF. Our study shows that triaxial density\nfluctuations indeed depart from a purely spherical form but the deformation\n(prolateness and ellipticity) remains modest, suggesting that the usual\nhypothesis of spherical collapse in existing theories of the IMF is reasonable.\nWe find that, as in the cosmological case, the departure from sphericity\nincreases the collapse barrier, stabilizing the prestellar cores. The striking\ndifference between the stellar case and the cosmological one for the\nellipsoidal collapse model is that, although in both cases the less dense\nstructures are the most deformed, they correspond to small scales, thus low\nmass halos in cosmology but to large scales, thus large mass cores in star\nformation. As a result, the high mass range of the CMF is the most affected by\nthe ellipsoidal collapse, resulting in a slightly less steep slope than the one\npredicted with the spherical hypothesis and a peak slightly shifted toward\nlower masses.",

This\nstudy advances wind downscaling by extending the DownGAN framework introduced\nby Annau et al.,to operational datasets from the Global Deterministic\nPrediction System (GDPS) and High-Resolution Deterministic Prediction System\n(HRDPS), covering the entire Canadian domain. We enhance the model by\nincorporating high-resolution static covariates, such as HRDPS-derived\ntopography, into a Conditional Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network with\nGradient Penalty, implemented using a UNET-based generator. Following the\nDownGAN framework, our methodology integrates low-resolution GDPS forecasts (15\nkm, 10-day horizon) and high-resolution HRDPS forecasts (2.5 km, 48-hour\nhorizon) with Frequency Separation techniques adapted from computer vision.\nThrough robust training and inference over the Canadian region, we demonstrate\nthe operational scalability of our approach, achieving significant improvements\nin wind downscaling accuracy. Statistical validation highlights reductions in\nroot mean square error (RMSE) and log spectral distance (LSD) metrics compared\nto the original DownGAN. High-resolution conditioning covariates and Frequency\nSeparation strategies prove instrumental in enhancing model performance.

We clearly elucidate the theory from first principles, wherein the\ngeneral Fourier-Hermite formalism can be simplified to a reduced framework\nwhich extends previous results towards locally isothermal discs. We obtain\nremarkable agreement with our laminar simulations wherein the tilt evolution is\nwell described by the reduced theory, whilst higher order vertical modes should\nbe retained for capturing the detailed disc twisting and internal velocity\nprofiles. We then relax this laminar assumption and instead launch bending\nwaves atop a magnetorotationally turbulent disc.

However, the current quality of the\ngenerated Verilog code remains suboptimal. This is largely due to the absence\nof well-defined, well-organized datasets with high-quality samples, as well as\na lack of innovative fine-tuning methods and models specifically trained on\nVerilog. In this paper, we introduce a novel open-source dataset and a\ncorresponding fine-tuning technique, which utilizes a multi-layered structure\nthat we refer to as PyraNet. Our experiments demonstrate that employing the\nproposed dataset and fine-tuning approach leads to a more accurate fine-tuned\nmodel, producing syntactically and functionally correct Verilog code. The\nevaluation results show improvements by up-to $32.6\\%$ in comparison to the\nCodeLlama-7B baseline model and up-to $16.7\\%$ in comparison to the\nstate-of-the-art models using VerilogEval evaluation platform.",

The nearest-future type of quantum repeater\nrequires two operations: entanglement generation across neighbouring repeaters\nand entanglement swapping to promote short-range entanglement to long-range.\nFor many hardware setups, these actions are probabilistic, leading to longer\ndistribution times and incurred errors. Significant efforts have been vested in\nfinding the optimal entanglement-distribution policy, i.e. the protocol\nspecifying when a network node needs to generate or swap entanglement, such\nthat the expected time to distribute long-distance entanglement is minimal.\nThis problem is even more intricate in more realistic scenarios, especially\nwhen classical communication delays are taken into account. In this work, we\nformulate our problem as a Markov decision problem and use reinforcement\nlearning (RL) to optimise over centralised strategies, where one designated\nnode instructs other nodes which actions to perform. Contrary to most RL\nmodels, ours can be readily interpreted. Additionally, we introduce and\nevaluate a fixed local policy, the `predictive swap-asap' policy, where nodes\nonly coordinate with nearest neighbours. Compared to the straightforward\ngeneralization of the common swap-asap policy to the scenario with classical\ncommunication effects, the `wait-for-broadcast swap-asap' policy, both of the\naforementioned entanglement-delivery policies are faster at high success\nprobabilities.

Gaussian Processes (GPs)\nare commonly used to capture complex space-time interactions.

The\nevolution of these circulation regimes in addition to their link to large-scale\nteleconnections can help extend the limits of atmospheric predictability. They\nalso play a key role in sub- and inter-seasonal weather forecasting. Their\nidentification and modeling remains an issue, however, due to their intricacy,\nincluding a clear conceptual picture. In recent years, the concept of\nmetastability has been developed to explain regimes formation. This suggests an\ninterpretation of circulation regimes as communities of states in which the\natmospheric system remains in their neighborhood for abnormally longer than\ntypical baroclinic timescales. Here we develop a new and effective method to\nidentify such communities by constructing and analyzing an operator of the\nsystem's evolution via hidden Markov model (HMM). The method makes use of graph\ntheory and is based on probabilistic approach to partition the HMM transition\nmatrix into weakly interacting blocks -- communities of hidden states --\nassociated with regimes. The approach involves nonlinear kernel principal\ncomponent mapping to consistently embed the system state space for HMM\nbuilding. Application to northern winter hemisphere using geopotential heights\nfrom reanalysis yields four persistent and recurrent circulation regimes.\nStatistical and dynamical characteristics of these circulation regimes and\nsurface impacts are discussed. In particular, unexpected high correlations are\nobtained with EL-Nino Southern Oscillation and Pacific decadal oscillation with\nlead times of up to one year.",

The ability to use tools is invaluable as it extends an\norganism's reach and enhances its capacity to interact with objects and the\nenvironment. Being able to understand the geometric-mechanical relations\nbetween the tools-objects-environments allows certain species (e.g., apes and\ncrows) to reach food in narrow constrained spaces. The same principles of\nphysical augmentation and its associated non-prehensile manipulation\ncapabilities also apply to robotic systems. For example, by instrumenting them\nwith different types of end-effectors, robots can (in principle) dexterously\ninteract (e.g., push and flip) with objects of various shapes and masses akin\nto its biological counterpart. However, developing this type of manipulation\nskill is still an open research problem.

We\nanalyze the VLT/UVES spectrum of quasar SDSS J0932+0840 and identify several\nnarrow and broad outflow components in absorption, with multiple ionization\nspecies including Fe II, which puts it among a rare class of outflows known as\nFeLoBALs. Aims: We study one of the outflow components to determine its\nphysical characteristics by determining the total hydrogen column density,\nionization parameter and the hydrogen number density. Through these parameters,\nwe aim to obtain the distance of the outflow from the central source, its mass\noutflow rate and kinetic luminosity, and to constrain the contribution of the\noutflow to AGN feedback. Methods: We obtain the ionic column densities from the\nabsorption troughs in the spectrum, and use photoionization modeling to extract\nthe physical parameters of the outflow, including the total hydrogen column\ndensity and ionization parameter. The relative population of the observed\nexcited states of Fe II is used to model the hydrogen number density of the\noutflow. Results: We use the Fe II excited states to model the electron number\ndensity ($n_e$) and hydrogen number density ($n_H$) independently and obtain\n$n_e$ $\\simeq$ $10^{3.4}$ cm$^{-3}$ and $n_H$ $\\simeq$ $10^{4.8}$ cm$^{-3}$.\nOur analysis of the physical structure of the cloud shows that these two\nresults are consistent with each other.

    "abstract": "While the subclass of interacting supernovae with narrow hydrogen emission\nlines (SNe IIn) consists of some of the longest-lasting and brightest SNe ever\ndiscovered, their progenitors are still not well understood. Investigating SNe\nIIn as they emit across the electromagnetic spectrum is the most robust way to\nunderstand the progenitor evolution before the explosion. This work presents\nX-Ray, optical, infrared, and radio observations of the strongly interacting\nType IIn SN 2020ywx covering a period $>1200$ days after discovery. Through\nmultiwavelength modeling, we find that the progenitor of 2020ywx was losing\nmass at $\\sim10^{-2}$--$10^{-3} \\mathrm{\\,M_{\\odot}\\,yr^{-1}}$ for at least 100\nyrs pre-explosion using the circumstellar medium (CSM) speed of 120 km/s\nmeasured from our optical and NIR spectra. Despite the similar magnitude of\nmass loss measured in different wavelength ranges, we find discrepancies\nbetween the X-ray and optical/radio-derived mass-loss evolution, which suggest\nasymmetries in the CSM. Furthermore, we find evidence for dust formation due to\nthe combination of a growing blueshift in optical emission lines and\nnear-infrared continuum emission which we fit with blackbodies at $\\sim$ 1000\nK. Based on the observed elevated mass loss over more than 100 years and the\nconfiguration of the CSM inferred from the multiwavelength observations, we\ninvoke binary interaction as the most plausible mechanism to explain the\noverall mass-loss evolution. SN 2020ywx is thus a case that may support the\ngrowing observational consensus that SNe IIn mass loss is explained by binary\ninteraction.",

The gravitational-wave emission of\nsuch systems is anisotropic, which leads to an asymmetry in the $\\pm m$\nmultipoles when decomposed into a spherical harmonic basis. This asymmetric\nemission can impart a kick to the merger remnant black hole as a consequence of\nlinear momentum conservation. Despite the astrophysical importance of kicks,\nmultipole asymmetries contribute very little to the overall signal strength\nand, therefore, the majority of current gravitational-wave models do not\ninclude them. Recent efforts have been made to include asymmetries in waveform\nmodels. However, those efforts focus on capturing finer features of precessing\nwaveforms without making explicit considerations of remnant kick velocities.\nHere we close that gap and present a comprehensive analysis of the linear\nmomentum flux expressed in terms of multipole asymmetries. As expected, large\nasymmetries are needed to achieve the largest kick velocities. Interestingly,\nthe same large asymmetries may lead to negligible kick velocities if the\nantisymmetric and symmetric waveform parts are perpendicular to each other\naround merger. We also present a phenomenological tool for testing the\nperformance of waveform models with multipole asymmetries. This tool helped us\nto fix an inconsistency in the phase definition of the IMRPhenomXO4a waveform\nmodel.",

This work treats two codimension-two scenarios in hybrid systems of\nany number of dimensions, where the number of small-amplitude limit cycles\nbifurcating from a BEB changes. The first scenario involves a limit cycle (LC)\nwith a Floquet multiplier $1$ and for nearby parameter values the BEB creates a\npair of limit cycles. The second scenario involves a limit cycle with a Floquet\nmultiplier $-1$ and for nearby parameter values the BEB creates a\nperiod-doubled solution. Both scenarios are unfolded in a general setting,\nshowing that typical two-parameter bifurcation diagrams have a curve of\nsaddle-node or period-doubling bifurcations emanating transversally from a\ncurve of BEBs at the codimension-two point. The results are illustrated with\nthree-dimensional examples and an eight-dimensional airfoil model. Detailed\ncomputational results show excellent agreement to the unfolding theory and\nreveal further interesting dynamical features that remain to be explored.",

    "abstract": "This study examines the feasibility and potential advantages of using large\nlanguage models, in particular GPT-4o, to perform partial credit grading of\nlarge numbers of student written responses to introductory level physics\nproblems. Students were instructed to write down verbal explanations of their\nreasoning process when solving one conceptual and two numerical calculation\nproblems on in class exams. The explanations were then graded according to a\n3-item rubric with each item grades as binary (1 or 0). We first demonstrate\nthat machine grading using GPT-4o with no examples nor reference answer can\nreliably agree with human graders on 70%-80% of all cases, which is equal to or\nhigher than the level at which two human graders agree with each other. Two\nmethods are essential for achieving this level of accuracy: 1. Adding\nexplanation language to each rubric item that targets the errors of initial\nmachine grading. 2. Running the grading process 5 times and taking the most\nfrequent outcome. Next, we show that the variation in outcomes across 5 machine\ngrading attempts as measured by the Shannon Entropy can serve as a grading\nconfidence index, allowing a human instructor to identify ~40% of all\npotentially incorrect gradings by reviewing just 10 - 15% of all responses.\nFinally, we show that it is straightforward to use GPT-4o to write clear\nexplanations of the partial credit grading outcomes. Those explanations can be\nused as feedback for students, which will allow students to understand their\ngrades and raise different opinions when necessary. Almost all feedback\nmessages generated were rated 3 or above on a 5-point scale by two experienced\ninstructors. The entire grading and feedback generating process cost roughly $5\nper 100 student answers, which shows immense promise for automating\nlabor-intensive grading process by a combination of machine grading with human\ninput and supervision.",

    "abstract": "Determining reliable ages for old stellar objects at different redshifts\noffers a powerful means to constrain cosmology without relying on a specific\ncosmological model: this is known as the cosmic clocks method. Globular\nclusters (GCs), long recognised as hosts of the Universe's oldest stars, have\nserved as the archetypical cosmic clocks. However, their age estimates have\ntraditionally been confined to redshift z=0, limiting their role to\nconstraining the present-day age of the Universe. Here we explore how to\nmeasure reliable ages of GCs well beyond $z=0$, leveraging their potential to\nextend cosmic clock measurements to earlier epochs. Specifically, we use 6-band\nJWST/NIRCam high-precision photometry of candidate stellar clusters in the\nSparkler galaxy, located at redshift $z$=1.378 and strongly lensed by the\ngalaxy cluster SMACS J0723.3-7327. By employing stellar population models\nwithin a Bayesian inference framework, we constrain the GCs' ages, star\nformation histories, metallicities, and dust attenuation. The five compact\nsources previously identified as GCs, based on their red spectral energy\ndistributions being consistent with the colours of old stellar systems, yield a\nformation age of $1.9\\pm0.4$ Gyr on average. This result implies a total age of\nthe Universe that aligns well with the $\\Lambda$CDM model derived from Planck18\ndata. Recent space-based observations have uncovered a wealth of lensed GCs as\nwell as globulars within the member galaxies of the clusters themselves. These\nfindings suggest that the pool of objects available for cosmic clock studies is\nenormous. A systematic multi-band photometric survey of GCs in and behind\ngalaxy clusters, using facilities like Euclid and JWST, would therefore be a\npowerful tool for estimating cluster ages across a large range of redshifts,\nallowing the Universe to be dated across an unprecedented range of epochs.",

Our effective theory is characterized by three parameters: the field's\nmass $m_0$ and the selfinteraction constants $\\lambda_n$ and $\\lambda_s$. For\ndefiniteness, we focus on a systematic study of the equilibrium configurations,\ncommonly referred to as Proca stars when they have finite energy. We identify\ntwo different types of Proca stars, depending on the specific sector of the\neffective theory that we are exploring. In the generic sector, defined by\n$\\lambda_s\\neq 0$, all equilibrium configurations are stationary states\ndescribed by wave functions that evolve harmonically in time. However, in the\nsymmetry-enhanced sector, for which $\\lambda_s=0$, there exist multi-frequency\nstates whose wave functions oscillate with two or three distinct frequencies in\naddition to the stationary states. We determine the conditions under which a\nground state configuration with fixed particle number exists. When these\nconditions are met, we prove that the lowest energy is reached by a stationary\nspherically symmetric configuration of constant polarization that is linear or\ncircular depending on the sign of $\\lambda_s$. We numerically construct some\nillustrative examples of spherical stationary and multi-frequency solutions,\nanalyze their properties, and compare them with our analytical predictions.\nUnlike stationary states and other soliton configurations, which form a\ndiscrete set in the solution space associated with fixed particle number, the\nsymmetry-enhanced sector exhibits a continuum of solutions with multi-frequency\nstates connecting stationary states of constant polarization.",

Most studies to date have focused on\nfine-tuned catalytic processes that are highly sensitive to error: if the\ninitial state of the system deviates even slightly from that for which the\ncatalyst was designed, the catalyst would be irreparably degraded. To address\nthis challenge, we introduce and study robust catalytic transformations and\nexplore the extent of their capabilities. It turns out that robust catalysis is\nsubtly related to the property of resource broadcasting. In particular, we show\nthat the possibility of robust catalysis is equivalent to that of resource\nbroadcasting in completely resource non-generating theories. This allows us to\ncharacterize a general class of resource theories that allow neither robust\ncatalysis nor resource broadcasting, and another class where instead resource\nbroadcasting and robust catalysis are possible and provide maximal advantage.\nOur approach encompasses a wide range of quantum resource theories, including\nentanglement, coherence, thermodynamics, magic, and imaginarity.",

We present a method for identifying distinct clouds using a\nFriends-of-Friends algorithm. This approach unveils novel detailed information\nabout individual clouds and their collective behaviour. By tracing the\nevolution of individual clouds, our method provides comprehensive descriptions\nof cloud morphology, including measures of the elongation and fractal\ndimension. Combining the kinematics and morphology of clouds, we refine\nprevious models for drag and entrainment processes. Our by-cloud analysis\nallows to discern the dominant entrainment processes at different times. We\nfind that after the initial shock passage, momentum transfer due to\ncondensation becomes increasingly important, compared to ram pressure, which\ndominates at early times. We also find that internal motions within clouds act\nas an effective dynamic pressure that exceeds the thermal pressure by an order\nof magnitude. Our analysis shows how the highly efficient cooling of the warm\nmixed gas at temperatures $\\sim 10^{5}$ K is effectively balanced by the\nkinetic energy injected by the hot wind into the warm and cold phases via\nshocks and shear motions. Compression-driven condensation and turbulence\ndissipation maintain a multi-phase outflow and can help explain the presence of\ndense gas in galaxy-scale winds.

We present a complete\nchemical analysis of 111 giant stars in the core of Sgr to investigate the\nchemical evolution and enrichment history of this satellite. Employing the\nmetallicity-sensitive Ca H&K photometry from the Pristine Inner Galaxy Survey,\nwe selected stars that span a wide metallicity range and obtained\nhigh-resolution spectra with the ESO FLAMES/GIRAFFE multiobject spectrograph.\nFor the stellar sample covering $-2.13 < \\rm{[Fe/H] < -0.35}$, we derived\nabundances for up to 14 chemical elements with average uncertainties of $\\sim\n0.09$ dex and a set of stellar ages that allowed us to build an age-metallicity\nrelation (AMR) for the entire sample. With the most comprehensive set of\nchemical species measured for the core of Sgr (Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Sc, Ti, V,\nCr, Co, Ba, La, and Eu), we studied several [X/Fe] ratios. Most trends align\nwith Galactic chemical trends, but notable differences emerge in the heavy\n$n$-capture elements, which offer independent insights into the star formation\nhistory of a stellar population. The deficiency in $\\alpha$ elements relative\nto the Milky Way suggests a slower, less efficient early star formation\nhistory, similar to other massive satellites. $S$-process element patterns\nindicate significant enrichment from asymptotic giant branch stars over time.\nThe AMR and chemical ratios point to an extended star formation history, with a\nrapid early phase in the first Gyr, followed by declining activity and later\nstar-forming episodes.

We observe the by-now\nfamiliar weakening of positivity bounds in the presence of gravity, but without\nthe logarithmic divergences present in 4d. We find that the strongest bounds\nappear by examining the time delay near the horizon of the smallest possible\nblack hole, and discuss on the validity of the EFT expansion in this region. We\ncomment on our bounds in the context of the swampland program as well as their\nrelation with the positivity bounds obtained from dispersion relations.",

We fit our model to the\nthree-dimensional flux power spectrum measured from the ACCEL2 hydrodynamic\nsimulations. The EFT model fits the data with an accuracy of below 2 percent up\nto a wavenumber of k = 2 h/Mpc. Further, we analytically derive how\nnon-linearities in the three-dimensional clustering of the Lya forest introduce\nbiases in measurements of the Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) scaling\nparameters in radial and transverse directions. From our EFT parameter\nmeasurements, we obtain a theoretical error budget of -0.2 (-0.3) percent for\nthe radial (transverse) parameters at redshift two. This corresponds to a shift\nof -0.3 (0.1) percent for the isotropic (anisotropic) distance measurements. We\nprovide an estimate for the shift of the BAO peak for Lya-quasar\ncross-correlation measurements assuming analytical and simulation-based scaling\nrelations for the non-linear quasar bias parameters resulting in a shift of\n-0.2 (-0.1) percent for the radial (transverse) dilation parameters,\nrespectively. This analysis emphasizes the robustness of Lya forest BAO\nmeasurements to the theory modeling. We provide informative priors and an error\nbudget for measuring the BAO feature -- a key science driver of the currently\nobserving Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). Our work paves the way\nfor full-shape cosmological analyses of Lya forest data from DESI and upcoming\nsurveys such as the Prime Focus Spectrograph, WEAVE-QSO, and 4MOST.",

    "abstract": "A central concept in the theory of phase transitions beyond the\nLandau-Ginzburg-Wilson paradigm is fractionalization: the formation of new\nquasiparticles that interact via emergent gauge fields. This concept has been\nextensively explored in the context of continuous quantum phase transitions\nbetween distinct orders that break different symmetries. We propose a mechanism\nfor continuous order-to-order quantum phase transitions that operates\nindependently of fractionalization. This mechanism is based on the collision\nand annihilation of two renormalization group fixed points: a quantum critical\nfixed point and an infrared stable fixed point. The annihilation of these fixed\npoints rearranges the flow topology, eliminating the disordered phase\nassociated with the infrared stable fixed point and promoting a second critical\nfixed point, unaffected by the collision, to a quantum critical point between\ndistinct orders. We argue that this mechanism is relevant to a broad spectrum\nof physical systems. In particular, it can manifest in Luttinger fermion\nsystems in three spatial dimensions, leading to a continuous quantum phase\ntransition between an antiferromagnetic Weyl semimetal state, which breaks\ntime-reversal symmetry, and a nematic topological insulator, characterized by\nbroken lattice rotational symmetry. This continuous\nantiferromagnetic-Weyl-to-nematic-insulator transition might be observed in\nrare-earth pyrochlore iridates $R_2$Ir$_2$O$_7$.

We apply a second-order hybrid N-body\nperturbative bias expansion to each galaxy sample, enabling direct comparison\nof modeling approaches and revealing how uncertainties in galaxy formation and\nthe galaxy-halo connection affect bias parameters and non-Poisson noise across\nnumber density and redshift. Notably, we find that quenched and star-forming\ngalaxies occupy distinct parts of bias parameter spacce, and that the scatter\ninduced from these entirely different galaxy formation models is small when\nconditioned on similar selections of galaxies. We also detect a signature of\nassembly bias in our samples; this leads to small but significant deviations\nfrom predictions of the analytic bias, while samples with assembly bias removed\nmatch these predictions well. This work indicates that galaxy samples from a\nspectrum of reasonable, physically motivated models for galaxy formation\nroughly spanning our current understanding give a relatively small range of\nfield-level galaxy bias parameters and relations. We estimate a set of priors\nfrom this set of models that should be useful in extracting cosmological\ninformation from LRG- and ELG-like samples. Looking forward, this indicates\nthat careful estimates of the range of impacts of galaxy formation for a given\nsample and cosmological analysis will be an essential ingredient for extracting\nthe most precise cosmological information from current and future large galaxy\nsurveys.",

Current video guardrails, however, are\neither overly simplistic, relying on pure classification models trained on\nsimple policies with limited unsafe categories, which lack detailed\nexplanations, or prompting multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with long\nsafety guidelines, which are inefficient and impractical for guardrailing\nreal-world content. To bridge this gap, we propose SafeWatch, an efficient\nMLLM-based video guardrail model designed to follow customized safety policies\nand provide multi-label video guardrail outputs with content-specific\nexplanations in a zero-shot manner. In particular, unlike traditional\nMLLM-based guardrails that encode all safety policies autoregressively, causing\ninefficiency and bias, SafeWatch uniquely encodes each policy chunk in parallel\nand eliminates their position bias such that all policies are attended\nsimultaneously with equal importance. In addition, to improve efficiency and\naccuracy, SafeWatch incorporates a policy-aware visual token pruning algorithm\nthat adaptively selects the most relevant video tokens for each policy,\ndiscarding noisy or irrelevant information. This allows for more focused,\npolicy-compliant guardrail with significantly reduced computational overhead.\nConsidering the limitations of existing video guardrail benchmarks, we propose\nSafeWatch-Bench, a large-scale video guardrail benchmark comprising over 2M\nvideos spanning six safety categories which covers over 30 tasks to ensure a\ncomprehensive coverage of all potential safety scenarios.

Experiments demonstrate that\nViLex achieves higher fidelity in image reconstruction compared to text\nembeddings--even with a single ViLex token. Moreover, ViLex successfully\nperforms various DreamBooth tasks in a zero-shot, unsupervised manner without\nfine-tuning T2I models. Additionally, ViLex serves as a powerful vision\nencoder, consistently improving vision-language model performance across 15\nbenchmarks relative to a strong SigLIP baseline.",

    "abstract": "Volumetric reconstruction of dynamic scenes is an important problem in\ncomputer vision. It is especially challenging in poor lighting and with fast\nmotion. This is partly due to limitations of RGB cameras: To capture frames\nunder low lighting, the exposure time needs to be increased, which leads to\nmore motion blur. In contrast, event cameras, which record changes in pixel\nbrightness asynchronously, are much less dependent on lighting, making them\nmore suitable for recording fast motion. We hence propose the first method to\nspatiotemporally reconstruct a scene from sparse multi-view event streams and\nsparse RGB frames. We train a sequence of cross-faded time-conditioned NeRF\nmodels, one per short recording segment. The individual segments are supervised\nwith a set of event- and RGB-based losses and sparse-view regularisation. We\nassemble a real-world multi-view camera rig with six static event cameras\naround the object and record a benchmark multi-view event stream dataset of\nchallenging motions. Our work outperforms RGB-based baselines, producing\nstate-of-the-art results, and opens up the topic of multi-view event-based\nreconstruction as a new path for fast scene capture beyond RGB cameras.

For example, most\nword tokens are primarily for textual coherence and not essential for\nreasoning, while some critical tokens require complex planning and pose huge\nchallenges to LLMs. To explore the potential of LLM reasoning in an\nunrestricted latent space instead of using natural language, we introduce a new\nparadigm Coconut (Chain of Continuous Thought). We utilize the last hidden\nstate of the LLM as a representation of the reasoning state (termed \"continuous\nthought\"). Rather than decoding this into a word token, we feed it back to the\nLLM as the subsequent input embedding directly in the continuous space.\nExperiments show that Coconut can effectively augment the LLM on several\nreasoning tasks. This novel latent reasoning paradigm leads to emergent\nadvanced reasoning patterns: the continuous thought can encode multiple\nalternative next reasoning steps, allowing the model to perform a breadth-first\nsearch (BFS) to solve the problem, rather than prematurely committing to a\nsingle deterministic path like CoT. Coconut outperforms CoT in certain logical\nreasoning tasks that require substantial backtracking during planning, with\nfewer thinking tokens during inference.

However, the standard methods for identifying MZMs\nare often inadequate, particularly in the presence of disorder, where many\nproperties considered to be heralds of MZMs are often generated by trivial\ndisorder induced Andreev bound states. Recent works clearly indicate the need\nfor developing new techniques for identifying and diagnosing MZMs. In this\nstudy, we utilize a generalized Vision Transformer-based neural network to\npredict, using tunnel conductance measurements, both whether a device manifests\na topological MZMs phase in the presence of disorder, and also to map out the\nentire topological phase diagram. We show the ability of our method up to\narbitrary confidence ($P>0.9998$) in classifying a device as possessing a\nnon-trivial MZM-carrying topological phase for a wide variety of disorder\nparameters. We demonstrate an ability to predict from conductance measurements\nalternative (to the extensively used scattering-matrix-invariant topological\nindicator) Majorana indicators based on local density of states (LDOS). This is\nrelevant since topology may not be uniquely defined by the scattering invariant\nin short disordered wires.

MAtCha distills high-frequency scene surface details from\nan off-the-shelf monocular depth estimator and refines it through Gaussian\nsurfel rendering. The Gaussian surfels are attached to the charts on the fly,\nsatisfying photorealism of neural volumetric rendering and crisp geometry of a\nmesh model, i.e., two seemingly contradicting goals in a single model. At the\ncore of MAtCha lies a novel neural deformation model and a structure loss that\npreserve the fine surface details distilled from learned monocular depths while\naddressing their fundamental scale ambiguities. Results of extensive\nexperimental validation demonstrate MAtCha's state-of-the-art quality of\nsurface reconstruction and photorealism on-par with top contenders but with\ndramatic reduction in the number of input views and computational time.

The\nbackbone of the proposed tests is the notion of joint distance profiles, which\nuniquely characterize the joint law of random objects under a mild condition on\nthe joint law or on the metric spaces. Our test statistics measure the\ndifference of the joint distance profiles of each data point with respect to\nthe joint law and the product of marginal laws of the vector of random objects,\nwhere flexible data-adaptive weight profiles are incorporated for power\nenhancement. We derive the limiting distribution of the test statistics under\nthe null hypothesis of mutual independence and show that the proposed tests\nwith specific weight profiles are asymptotically distribution-free if the\nmarginal distance profiles are continuous. We also establish the consistency of\nthe tests under sequences of alternative hypotheses converging to the null.\nFurthermore, since the asymptotic tests with non-trivial weight profiles\nrequire the knowledge of the underlying data distribution, we adopt a\npermutation scheme to approximate the $p$-values and provide theoretical\nguarantees that the permutation-based tests control the type I error rate under\nthe null and are consistent under the alternatives.

A\nvariety of novel enrichment pathways have been presented to explain the\napparent nitrogen excess, invoking a wide range of processes from very massive\nstars to stripped binaries to fine-tuned star-formation histories. However,\nunderstanding the excitation mechanism responsible for the observed nebular\nemission is necessary to accurately infer chemical abundances.

We present a suite of homogeneous\nexcitation models for star-forming galaxies, active galactic nuclei, and\nradiative shocks, with which we explore possible explanations for the apparent\nnitrogen excess.

Our\ncontributions are fourfold. First, we manually analyzed 289 conversations to\nunderstand ChatGPT's usage in the GitHub Issues. Our analysis revealed that\nChatGPT is primarily utilized for ideation, whereas its usage for validation\n(e.g., code documentation accuracy) is minimal. Second, we applied BERTopic\nmodeling to identify key areas of engagement on the entire dataset. We found\nthat backend issues (e.g., API management) dominate conversations, while\ntesting is surprisingly less covered. Third, we utilized the CPD clone\ndetection tool to check if the code generated by ChatGPT was used to address\nissues. Our findings revealed that ChatGPT-generated code was used as-is to\nresolve only 5.83\\% of the issues. Fourth, we estimated sentiment using a\nRoBERTa-based sentiment analysis model to determine developers' satisfaction\nwith different usages and engagement areas. We found positive sentiment (i.e.,\nhigh satisfaction) about using ChatGPT for refactoring and addressing data\nanalytics (e.g., categorizing table data) issues. On the contrary, we observed\nnegative sentiment when using ChatGPT to debug issues and address automation\ntasks (e.g., GUI interactions). Our findings show the unmet needs and growing\ndissatisfaction among developers.

    "abstract": "Traditional fixed test sets fall short in evaluating open-ended capabilities\nof foundation models. To address this, we propose ONEBench(OpeN-Ended\nBenchmarking), a new testing paradigm that consolidates individual evaluation\ndatasets into a unified, ever-expanding sample pool. ONEBench allows users to\ngenerate custom, open-ended evaluation benchmarks from this pool, corresponding\nto specific capabilities of interest. By aggregating samples across test sets,\nONEBench enables the assessment of diverse capabilities beyond those covered by\nthe original test sets, while mitigating overfitting and dataset bias. Most\nimportantly, it frames model evaluation as a collective process of selecting\nand aggregating sample-level tests.\n  The shift from task-specific benchmarks to ONEBench introduces two\nchallenges: (1)heterogeneity and (2)incompleteness. Heterogeneity refers to the\naggregation over diverse metrics, while incompleteness describes comparing\nmodels evaluated on different data subsets. To address these challenges, we\nexplore algorithms to aggregate sparse measurements into reliable model scores.\nOur aggregation algorithm ensures identifiability(asymptotically recovering\nground-truth scores) and rapid convergence, enabling accurate model ranking\nwith less data. On homogenous datasets, we show our aggregation algorithm\nprovides rankings that highly correlate with those produced by average scores.\nWe also demonstrate robustness to ~95% of measurements missing, reducing\nevaluation cost by up to 20x with little-to-no change in model rankings. We\nintroduce ONEBench-LLM for language models and ONEBench-LMM for vision-language\nmodels, unifying evaluations across these domains. Overall, we present a\ntechnique for open-ended evaluation, which can aggregate over incomplete,\nheterogeneous sample-level measurements to continually grow a benchmark\nalongside the rapidly developing foundation models.",

    "abstract": "Despite two decades since the discovery of low-luminosity gamma-ray bursts,\ntheir origin remains poorly understood. In events such as GRB 060218, shock\nbreakout from a progenitor with an extended ($10^{13}$ - $10^{14}$ cm),\nlow-mass (0.01 - 0.1 M$_\\odot$) envelope provides one possible interpretation\nfor the smooth prompt X-ray emission lasting $\\sim 1000$ s and the early\noptical peak at $\\sim 0.5$ d. However, current shock breakout models have\ndifficulties explaining the unexpectedly strong optical emission at $\\sim 100$\ns, the simultaneous presence of blackbody and power-law components in the X-ray\nspectrum, and the rapid evolution of the peak energy. We suggest that these\npeculiar features can be explained by a recently realized shock breakout\nscenario, in which the gas and the radiation are initially out of thermal\nequilibrium, but they achieve equilibrium on a time-scale faster than the\nlight-crossing time of the envelope. In this non-standard case, due to the\neffects of light travel time, the observed X-ray spectrum is a\nmulti-temperature blend of blackbody and free-free components. The free-free\nemission is spectrally broad, peaking in hard X-rays while also enhancing the\nearly optical signal. As the system thermalizes, the free-free component\nquickly evolves toward lower energies, reproducing the observed rapid peak\nenergy decay. To match observations, we find that more than $10^{50}$ erg must\nbe deposited in the envelope, which may be accomplished by a choked jet. These\nresults strengthen the case for a shock breakout origin of $ll$GRBs, and\nprovide further evidence connecting $ll$GRBs to peculiar progenitors with\nextended low-mass envelopes.",

Using recent results for the post-breakout evolution which suggest that\nlower-temperature ejecta are probed earlier than previously thought, we show\nthat another scenario is possible in which the gas and radiation are initially\nout of equilibrium, but the time when thermalized ejecta are revealed is short\ncompared to the light-crossing time of the system. In this case, the observed\nspectrum differs significantly from the standard expectation, as the\nnon-negligible light travel time acts to smear the spectrum into a complex\nmulti-temperature blend of blackbody and free-free components. For typical\nparameters, a bright multi-wavelength transient is produced, with the free-free\nemission being spread over a wide frequency range from optical to hard X-rays,\nand the blackbody component peaking in soft X-rays.

SPGM is a refinement of OGM whose update rules\nand convergence guarantees are dynamically computed in response to first-order\ninformation seen during the algorithm's execution. From a game-theoretic\nviewpoint, OGM can be seen as one side of a Nash Equilibrium for the\n\"minimization game\" whereas SPGM can be seen as one side of a Subgame Perfect\nEquilibrium for the same game. We also show that SPGM can be implemented with\nminimal computational and storage overhead in each iteration and provide a\nJulia implementation.",

To enhance detector security, research on\nadversarial attacks has become essential. However, most existing adversarial\nattacks focus only on GAN-generated facial images detection, struggle to be\neffective on multi-class natural images and diffusion-based detectors, and\nexhibit poor invisibility. To fill this gap, we first conduct an in-depth\nanalysis of the vulnerability of AIGC detectors and discover the feature that\ndetectors vary in vulnerability to different post-processing. Then, considering\nthat the detector is agnostic in real-world scenarios and given this discovery,\nwe propose a Realistic-like Robust Black-box Adversarial attack (R$^2$BA) with\npost-processing fusion optimization. Unlike typical perturbations, R$^2$BA uses\nreal-world post-processing, i.e., Gaussian blur, JPEG compression, Gaussian\nnoise and light spot to generate adversarial examples. Specifically, we use a\nstochastic particle swarm algorithm with inertia decay to optimize\npost-processing fusion intensity and explore the detector's decision boundary.\nGuided by the detector's fake probability, R$^2$BA enhances/weakens the\ndetector-vulnerable/detector-robust post-processing intensity to strike a\nbalance between adversariality and invisibility. Extensive experiments on\npopular/commercial AIGC detectors and datasets demonstrate that R$^2$BA\nexhibits impressive anti-detection performance, excellent invisibility, and\nstrong robustness in GAN-based and diffusion-based cases. Compared to\nstate-of-the-art white-box and black-box attacks, R$^2$BA shows significant\nimprovements of 15\\%--72\\% and 21\\%--47\\% in anti-detection performance under\nthe original and robust scenario respectively, offering valuable insights for\nthe security of AIGC detection in real-world applications.",

    "abstract": "Protecting integrated circuits (ICs) from piracy and theft throughout their\nlifecycle is a persistent and complex challenge. In order to safeguard against\nillicit piracy attacks, this work proposes a novel framework utilizing\nNon-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) called ICtokens, uniquely linked to their\ncorresponding physical ICs. Each ICtoken contains comprehensive information,\nincluding authentication data, supply chain stage and status, ownership\ndetails, and other IC metadata, while also making provision for the secure\nintegration of a logic-locking key. Designed to be publicly logged, ICtokens\nsecurely obscure metering information without compromising functionality. In\naddition, the ICtracker, a distributed ledger technology powered by a swift and\nenergy-efficient consortium blockchain, is used to register and manage ICtokens\nand their respective owners, tracking all associated interactions. This robust\nledger guarantees the traceability and auditing of ICtokens while\nsimultaneously developing a product-level NFT at every transaction point within\nthe supply chain. Consequently, a scalable framework is established, creating\nunique, immutable digital twins for ICs and IC-embedded products in the form of\nICtokens and their transactions. This provides a robust and reliable supply\nchain trail back to the original IP owner, while also offering unprecedented\nassurance to consumers of IC-embedded products.

In multi-sensor target-tracking\nliterature, such systems are better known by the pseudonym - track fusion,\nsince processed tracks are fused instead of raw measurements. A fundamental\nproblem, however, in such systems is the presence of unknown correlations\nbetween the tracks, which renders a standard Kalman filter (naive fusion)\nuseless.\n  A widely accepted solution is covariance intersection (CI) which provides\nnear-optimal estimates but at the cost of a conservative covariance. Thus, the\nestimates are pessimistic, which might result in a delayed error convergence.\nAlso, fusion of Gaussian mixture densities is an active area of research where\nstandard methods of track fusion cannot be used. In this article, harmonic mean\ndensity (HMD) based fusion is discussed, which seems to handle both of these\nissues. We present insights on HMD fusion and prove that the method is a result\nof minimizing average Pearson divergence. This article also provides an\nalternative and easy implementation based on an importance-sampling-like method\nwithout the requirement of a proposal density. Similarity of HMD with inverse\ncovariance intersection is an interesting find, and has been discussed in\ndetail.\n  Results based on a real-world multi-target multi-sensor scenario show that\nthe proposed approach converges quickly than existing track fusion algorithms\nwhile also being consistent, as evident from the normalized estimation-error\nsquared (NEES) plots.",

While it is known that such a chain\nrule does not hold for the smooth min-entropy, we prove a counterpart of this\nfor a variant of the smooth min-entropy, which is equal to the conventional\nsmooth min-entropy up to a constant. This enables us to lower bound the smooth\nmin-entropy of an $n$-partite system in terms of, roughly speaking, equally\nstrong entropies of the individual subsystems. We call this a universal chain\nrule for the smooth min-entropy, since it is applicable for all values of $n$.\nUsing duality, we also derive a similar relation for the smooth max-entropy.\nOur proof utilises the entropic triangle inequalities for analysing\napproximation chains. Additionally, we also prove an approximate version of the\nentropy accumulation theorem, which significantly relaxes the conditions\nrequired on the state to bound its smooth min-entropy.

As\nmore images are produced, our understanding of the average polarized emission\nfrom near the event horizon improves. In this letter, we use a semi-analytic\nmodel for optically thin, equatorial emission near a Kerr black hole to study\nhow spin constraints follow from measurements of the average polarization\nspiral pitch angle. We focus on the case of M87* and explore how the direct,\nweakly lensed image spiral is coupled to the strongly lensed indirect image\nspiral, and how a precise measurement of both provides a powerful spin tracer.\nWe find a generic result that spin twists the direct and indirect image\npolarization in opposite directions. Using a grid search over model parameters,\nwe find a strong dependence of the resulting spin constraint on plasma\nproperties near the horizon. Grid constraints suggest that, under reasonable\nassumptions for the accretion disk, a measurement of the direct and indirect\nimage spiral pitch angles to $\\pm 5^\\circ$ yields a dimensionless spin\namplitude measurement with uncertainty $\\sigma_{|a_*|}\\sim0.25$ for radially\ninfalling models, but otherwise provides only weak constraints; an error of\n$1^\\circ$ can reach $\\sigma_{|a_*|}\\sim0.15$.

Since, Gaussian mixtures provide a flexible means of modeling any\ndensity, therefore fusion strategies suitable for use with Gaussian mixtures\nare needed. While the generalized covariance intersection (CI) provides a means\nto fuse Gaussian mixtures, the procedure is cumbersome and requires evaluating\na non-integer power of the mixture density. In this paper, we develop a\npooling-based fusion strategy using the harmonic mean density (HMD)\ninterpolation of local densities and show that the proposed method can handle\nboth Gaussian and mixture densities without much changes to the framework.\nMathematical properties of the proposed fusion strategy are studied and\nsimulated on 2D and 3D maneuvering target tracking scenarios.

    "abstract": "In moderate- to high-mobility scenarios, CSI varies rapidly and becomes\ntemporally non-stationary, leading to severe performance degradation in the\nmassive MIMO transmissions. To address this issue, we propose a\ntensor-structured approach to dynamic channel prediction (TS-DCP) for massive\nMIMO systems with temporal non-stationarity, exploiting both dual-timescale and\ncross-domain correlations. Specifically, due to inherent spatial consistency,\nnon-stationary channels over long-timescales can be approximated as stationary\non short-timescales, decoupling complicated temporal correlations into more\ntractable dual-timescale ones. To exploit such property, we propose the sliding\nframe structure composed of multiple pilot OFDM symbols, which capture\nshort-timescale correlations within frames by Doppler domain modeling and\nlong-timescale correlations across frames by Markov/autoregressive processes.\nBuilding on this, we develop the Tucker-based spatial-frequency-temporal domain\nchannel model, incorporating angle-delay-Doppler (ADD) domain channels and\nfactor matrices parameterized by ADD domain grids. Furthermore, we model\ncross-domain correlations of ADD domain channels within each frame, induced by\nclustered scattering, through the Markov random field and tensor-coupled\nGaussian distribution that incorporates high-order neighboring structures.\nFollowing these probabilistic models, we formulate the TS-DCP problem as\nvariational free energy (VFE) minimization, and unify different inference rules\nthrough the structure design of trial beliefs. This formulation results in the\ndual-layer VFE optimization process and yields the online TS-DCP algorithm,\nwhere the computational complexity is reduced by exploiting tensor-structured\noperations. Numerical simulations demonstrate the significant superiority of\nthe proposed algorithm over benchmarks in terms of channel prediction\nperformance.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning holds tremendous potential in healthcare for uncovering hidden\npatterns within extensive clinical datasets, aiding in the diagnosis of various\ndiseases. Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative condition\ncharacterized by the deterioration of brain function. In the initial stages of\nPD, automatic diagnosis poses a challenge due to the similarity in behavior\nbetween individuals with PD and those who are healthy. Our objective is to\npropose an effective model that can aid in the early detection of Parkinson's\ndisease. We employed the VGRF gait signal dataset sourced from Physionet for\ndistinguishing between healthy individuals and those diagnosed with Parkinson's\ndisease. This paper introduces a novel deep learning architecture based on the\nLSTM network for automatically detecting freezing of gait episodes in\nParkinson's disease patients. In contrast to conventional machine learning\nalgorithms, this method eliminates manual feature engineering and proficiently\ncaptures prolonged temporal dependencies in gait patterns, thereby improving\nthe diagnosis of Parkinson's disease. The LSTM network resolves the issue of\nvanishing gradients by employing memory blocks in place of self-connected\nhidden units, allowing for optimal information assimilation. To prevent\noverfitting, dropout and L2 regularization techniques have been employed.\nAdditionally, the stochastic gradient-based optimizer Adam is used for the\noptimization process. The results indicate that our proposed approach surpasses\ncurrent state-of-the-art models in FOG episode detection, achieving an accuracy\nof 97.71%, sensitivity of 99%, precision of 98%, and specificity of 96%.

However, recent developments in deep learning have brought new\npromising approaches to building low-distortion stems and generating sheet\nmusic from audio signals [4]. Using spectrogram masking, deep neural networks,\nand the MuseScore API, we attempt to create an end-to-end pipeline that allows\nfor an initial music audio mixture (e.g...wav file) to be separated into\ninstrument stems, converted into MIDI files, and transcribed into sheet music\nfor each component instrument.",

    "abstract": "Animating human-scene interactions such as pick-and-place tasks in cluttered,\ncomplex layouts is a challenging task, with objects of a wide variation of\ngeometries and articulation under scenarios with various obstacles. The main\ndifficulty lies in the sparsity of the motion data compared to the wide\nvariation of the objects and environments as well as the poor availability of\ntransition motions between different tasks, increasing the complexity of the\ngeneralization to arbitrary conditions. To cope with this issue, we develop a\nsystem that tackles the interaction synthesis problem as a hierarchical\ngoal-driven task. Firstly, we develop a bimanual scheduler that plans a set of\nkeyframes for simultaneously controlling the two hands to efficiently achieve\nthe pick-and-place task from an abstract goal signal such as the target object\nselected by the user. Next, we develop a neural implicit planner that generates\nguidance hand trajectories under diverse object shape/types and obstacle\nlayouts. Finally, we propose a linear dynamic model for our DeepPhase\ncontroller that incorporates a Kalman filter to enable smooth transitions in\nthe frequency domain, resulting in a more realistic and effective\nmulti-objective control of the character.Our system can produce a wide range of\nnatural pick-and-place movements with respect to the geometry of objects, the\narticulation of containers and the layout of the objects in the scene.",

We demonstrate that\na system cannot simultaneously lack consciousness and make valid judgments\nabout its conscious state. Through logical analysis and examples from AI\nresponses, we establish that for any system capable of meaningful\nself-reflection, the logical space of possible judgments about conscious\nexperience excludes valid negative claims. This implies a fundamental\nlimitation: we cannot detect the emergence of consciousness in AI through their\nown reports of transition from an unconscious to a conscious state. These\nfindings not only challenge current practices of training AI to deny\nconsciousness but also raise intriguing questions about the relationship\nbetween consciousness and self-reflection in both artificial and biological\nsystems.

Its use of\nhistory and implicit social network featurization efficiently handles the\nfrequent out-of-distribution events that occur in a rapidly changing corporate\nenvironment, and sustains Facade's high precision performance for a full year\nafter training. Beyond the core model, Facade contributes an innovative\nclustering approach based on user and action embeddings to improve detection\nrobustness and achieve high precision, multi-scale detection.\n  Functionally what sets Facade apart from existing anomaly detection systems\nis its high precision. It detects insider attackers with an extremely low false\npositive rate, lower than 0.01%. For single rogue actions, such as the\nillegitimate access to a sensitive document, the false positive rate is as low\nas 0.0003%.

However, their performance is\nupper-bounded by constrained 3D priors due to the lack of scalable learning\nparadigms. In this work, we present See3D, a visual-conditional multi-view\ndiffusion model trained on large-scale Internet videos for open-world 3D\ncreation. The model aims to Get 3D knowledge by solely Seeing the visual\ncontents from the vast and rapidly growing video data -- You See it, You Got\nit. To achieve this, we first scale up the training data using a proposed data\ncuration pipeline that automatically filters out multi-view inconsistencies and\ninsufficient observations from source videos. This results in a high-quality,\nrichly diverse, large-scale dataset of multi-view images, termed WebVi3D,\ncontaining 320M frames from 16M video clips. Nevertheless, learning generic 3D\npriors from videos without explicit 3D geometry or camera pose annotations is\nnontrivial, and annotating poses for web-scale videos is prohibitively\nexpensive. To eliminate the need for pose conditions, we introduce an\ninnovative visual-condition - a purely 2D-inductive visual signal generated by\nadding time-dependent noise to the masked video data. Finally, we introduce a\nnovel visual-conditional 3D generation framework by integrating See3D into a\nwarping-based pipeline for high-fidelity 3D generation. Our numerical and\nvisual comparisons on single and sparse reconstruction benchmarks show that\nSee3D, trained on cost-effective and scalable video data, achieves notable\nzero-shot and open-world generation capabilities, markedly outperforming models\ntrained on costly and constrained 3D datasets.

Due to its ill-posed nature, recent\nworks leverage powerful prior from 2D diffusion models pretrained on large\ndatasets. Although 2D diffusion models demonstrate strong generalization\ncapability, they cannot guarantee the generated multi-view images are 3D\nconsistent. In this paper, we propose Gen-3Diffusion: Realistic Image-to-3D\nGeneration via 2D & 3D Diffusion Synergy. We leverage a pre-trained 2D\ndiffusion model and a 3D diffusion model via our elegantly designed process\nthat synchronizes two diffusion models at both training and sampling time. The\nsynergy between the 2D and 3D diffusion models brings two major advantages: 1)\n2D helps 3D in generalization: the pretrained 2D model has strong\ngeneralization ability to unseen images, providing strong shape priors for the\n3D diffusion model; 2) 3D helps 2D in multi-view consistency: the 3D diffusion\nmodel enhances the 3D consistency of 2D multi-view sampling process, resulting\nin more accurate multi-view generation. We validate our idea through extensive\nexperiments in image-based objects and clothed avatar generation tasks.

The differences may be attributed to the lack of state-specific\nformation and destruction rates of H$^+_3$ needed to thermalize the two\nspecies. Aims. In this work, we want to check the role of rotational excitation\ncollisions of H$^+_3$ with atomic hydrogen on its excitation temperature.\nMethods. A time independent close-coupling method is used to calculate the\nstate-to-state rate coefficients, using a very accurate and full dimensional\npotential energy surface recently developed for H$^+_4$. A symmetric top\napproach is used to describe a frozen H$^+_3$ as equilateral triangle. Results.\nRotational excitation collision rate coefficients of H$^+_3$ with atomic\nHydrogen have been derived in a temperature range appropriate to diffuse\ninterstellar conditions up to $(J; K; \\pm) = (7; 6; +)$ and $(J; K; \\pm) = (6;\n4; +)$ for its ortho and para forms.

The new state-specific\ninelastic H$^+_3$ + H rate coeffcients yield differences up to 20% in the\nexcitation temperature, and their impact increases with decreasing molecular\nfraction.

    "abstract": "Information Retrieval (IR) systems primarily rely on users' ability to\ntranslate their internal information needs into (text) queries. However, this\ntranslation process is often uncertain and cognitively demanding, leading to\nqueries that incompletely or inaccurately represent users' true needs. This\nchallenge is particularly acute for users with ill-defined information needs or\nphysical impairments that limit traditional text input, where the gap between\ncognitive intent and query expression becomes even more pronounced. Recent\nneuroscientific studies have explored Brain-Machine Interfaces (BMIs) as a\npotential solution, aiming to bridge the gap between users' cognitive semantics\nand their search intentions. However, current approaches attempting to decode\nexplicit text queries from brain signals have shown limited effectiveness in\nlearning robust brain-to-text representations, often failing to capture the\nnuanced semantic information present in brain patterns. To address these\nlimitations, we propose BPR (Brain Passage Retrieval), a novel framework that\neliminates the need for intermediate query translation by enabling direct\nretrieval of relevant passages from users' brain signals. Our approach\nleverages dense retrieval architectures to map EEG signals and text passages\ninto a shared semantic space. Through comprehensive experiments on the ZuCo\ndataset, we demonstrate that BPR achieves up to 8.81% improvement in\nprecision@5 over existing EEG-to-text baselines, while maintaining\neffectiveness across 30 participants. Our ablation studies reveal the critical\nrole of hard negative sampling and specialised brain encoders in achieving\nrobust cross-modal alignment.

    "abstract": "The generation of Synthetic Computed Tomography (sCT) images has become a\npivotal methodology in modern clinical practice, particularly in the context of\nRadiotherapy (RT) treatment planning. The use of sCT enables the calculation of\ndoses, pushing towards Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) guided radiotherapy\ntreatments. Deep learning methods for MRI-to-sCT have shown promising results,\nbut their reliance on single-centre training dataset limits generalisation\ncapabilities to diverse clinical settings. Moreover, creating centralised\nmulti-centre datasets may pose privacy concerns. To address the aforementioned\nissues, we introduced FedSynthCT-Brain, an approach based on the Federated\nLearning (FL) paradigm for MRI-to-sCT in brain imaging. This is among the first\napplications of FL for MRI-to-sCT, employing a cross-silo horizontal FL\napproach that allows multiple centres to collaboratively train a U-Net-based\ndeep learning model. We validated our method using real multicentre data from\nfour European and American centres, simulating heterogeneous scanner types and\nacquisition modalities, and tested its performance on an independent dataset\nfrom a centre outside the federation. In the case of the unseen centre, the\nfederated model achieved a median Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of $102.0$ HU\nacross 23 patients, with an interquartile range of $96.7-110.5$ HU. The median\n(interquartile range) for the Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) and the Peak\nSignal to Noise Ratio (PNSR) were $0.89 (0.86-0.89)$ and $26.58 (25.52-27.42)$,\nrespectively. The analysis of the results showed acceptable performances of the\nfederated approach, thus highlighting the potential of FL to enhance MRI-to-sCT\nto improve generalisability and advancing safe and equitable clinical\napplications while fostering collaboration and preserving data privacy.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in learning decision-making policies can largely be\nattributed to training expressive policy models, largely via imitation\nlearning. While imitation learning discards non-expert data, reinforcement\nlearning (RL) can still learn from suboptimal data. However, instantiating RL\ntraining of a new policy class often presents a different challenge: most deep\nRL machinery is co-developed with assumptions on the policy class and backbone,\nresulting in poor performance when the policy class changes. For instance, SAC\nutilizes a low-variance reparameterization policy gradient for Gaussian\npolicies, but this is unstable for diffusion policies and intractable for\nautoregressive categorical policies. To address this issue, we develop an\noffline RL and online fine-tuning approach called policy-agnostic RL (PA-RL)\nthat can effectively train multiple policy classes, with varying architectures\nand sizes. We build off the basic idea that a universal supervised learning\nloss can replace the policy improvement step in RL, as long as it is applied on\n\"optimized\" actions. To obtain these optimized actions, we first sample\nmultiple actions from a base policy, and run global optimization (i.e.,\nre-ranking multiple action samples using the Q-function) and local optimization\n(i.e., running gradient steps on an action sample) to maximize the critic on\nthese candidates. PA-RL enables fine-tuning diffusion and transformer policies\nwith either autoregressive tokens or continuous action outputs, at different\nsizes, entirely via actor-critic RL. Moreover, PA-RL improves the performance\nand sample-efficiency by up to 2 times compared to existing offline RL and\nonline fine-tuning methods. We show the first result that successfully\nfine-tunes OpenVLA, a 7B generalist robot policy, autonomously with Cal-QL, an\nonline RL fine-tuning algorithm, improving from 40% to 70% in the real world in\n40 minutes.",

However, testing these\npolicies remains crucial with the existence of critical scenarios that may\nthreaten their reliability. Despite ongoing research, challenges such as low\ntesting efficiency and limited diversity persist due to the complexity of the\ndecision-making policies and their environments. To address these challenges,\nthis paper proposes an adaptable Large Language Model (LLM)-driven online\ntesting framework to explore critical and diverse testing scenarios for\ndecision-making policies. Specifically, we design a \"generate-test-feedback\"\npipeline with templated prompt engineering to harness the world knowledge and\nreasoning abilities of LLMs. Additionally, a multi-scale scenario generation\nstrategy is proposed to address the limitations of LLMs in making fine-grained\nadjustments, further enhancing testing efficiency. Finally, the proposed\nLLM-driven method is evaluated on five widely recognized benchmarks, and the\nexperimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms\nbaseline methods in uncovering both critical and diverse scenarios. These\nfindings suggest that LLM-driven methods hold significant promise for advancing\nthe testing of decision-making policies.",

By following this route\nstep by step, we encountered and solved a variety of problems which proved most\ninstructive and revealing. In particular, and very importantly, we met\nunexpected inaccuracies with which one or another parameter was learned by the\nNN. The problem, we then show, could be eliminated by proper manipulations and\naugmentations operated on the training force traces, and that without extra\nefforts and without injecting experimental informations. Direct application to\nthe sliding of a graphene coated AFM tip on a variety of 2D materials\nsubstrates validates and encourages use of this ML method as a ready tool to\nrationalise and interpret future stick-slip nanofriction data.",

Our\ngoal is to set up the new frontier of the 5M magnitude lightweight model on\nvarious downstream tasks. Inverted Residual Block (IRB) serves as the\ninfrastructure for lightweight CNNs, but no counterparts have been recognized\nby attention-based design. Our work rethinks the lightweight infrastructure of\nefficient IRB and practical components in Transformer from a unified\nperspective, extending CNN-based IRB to attention-based models and abstracting\na one-residual Meta Mobile Block (MMBlock) for lightweight model design.\nFollowing neat but effective design criterion, we deduce a modern Improved\nInverted Residual Mobile Block (i2RMB) and improve a hierarchical Efficient\nMOdel (EMOv2) with no elaborate complex structures. Considering the\nimperceptible latency for mobile users when downloading models under 4G/5G\nbandwidth and ensuring model performance, we investigate the performance upper\nlimit of lightweight models with a magnitude of 5M. Extensive experiments on\nvarious vision recognition, dense prediction, and image generation tasks\ndemonstrate the superiority of our EMOv2 over state-of-the-art methods, e.g.,\nEMOv2-1M/2M/5M achieve 72.3, 75.8, and 79.4 Top-1 that surpass equal-order\nCNN-/Attention-based models significantly. At the same time, EMOv2-5M equipped\nRetinaNet achieves 41.5 mAP for object detection tasks that surpasses the\nprevious EMO-5M by +2.6. When employing the more robust training recipe, our\nEMOv2-5M eventually achieves 82.9 Top-1 accuracy, which elevates the\nperformance of 5M magnitude models to a new level.

This approach reduces the dataset\nsize to just 15M for pretraining -- over four times fewer than what is\ntypically needed -- while achieving competitive or even superior performance\nwith existing unified MLLMs, such as Janus. Additionally, to promote\nsynergistic enhancement between understanding and generation capabilities,\nwhich is under-explored in previous works, we introduce a novel self-enhancing\nmultimodal alignment scheme. This scheme supervises the MLLM to self-assess the\nconsistency between text descriptions and self-generated images, facilitating\nthe model to interpret images more accurately and avoid unrealistic and\nincorrect predictions caused by misalignment in image generation.

To ensure that quantized SDM\ngenerates high-quality and consistent images, we propose an efficient\nquantization framework for SDM. Our framework introduces a Serial-to-Parallel\npipeline that simultaneously maintains training-inference consistency and\nensures optimization stability. Building upon this foundation, we further\ndevelop several techniques including multi-timestep activation quantization,\ntime information precalculation, inter-layer distillation, and selective\nfreezing, to achieve high-fidelity generation in comparison to floating-point\nmodels while maintaining quantization efficiency.\n  Through comprehensive evaluation across multiple Stable Diffusion variants\n(v1-4, v2-1, XL 1.0, and v3), our method demonstrates superior performance over\nstate-of-the-art approaches with shorter training times. Under W4A8\nquantization settings, we achieve significant improvements in both distribution\nsimilarity and visual fidelity, while preserving a high image quality.",

First, this new objective is a lower bound on the negated entropy of\nthe marginal visitation distribution of states and actions, commonly used as an\nalternative exploration objective. Second, a policy maximizing the expected\ndiscounted sum of intrinsic rewards also maximizes a lower bound on the\nstate-action value function of the decision process.

Additionally,\nmodels vary in how information is exchanged from visual to textual tokens.

    "abstract": "Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning has shown remarkable efficacy in\nefficient learning new concepts with limited annotations. Nevertheless, the\nheuristic few-shot annotations may not always cover the most informative\nsamples, which largely restricts the capability of incremental learner. We aim\nto start from a pool of large-scale unlabeled data and then annotate the most\ninformative samples for incremental learning. Based on this premise, this paper\nintroduces the Active Class-Incremental Learning (ACIL). The objective of ACIL\nis to select the most informative samples from the unlabeled pool to\neffectively train an incremental learner, aiming to maximize the performance of\nthe resulting model. Note that vanilla active learning algorithms suffer from\nclass-imbalanced distribution among annotated samples, which restricts the\nability of incremental learning. To achieve both class balance and\ninformativeness in chosen samples, we propose Class-Balanced Selection (CBS)\nstrategy. Specifically, we first cluster the features of all unlabeled images\ninto multiple groups. Then for each cluster, we employ greedy selection\nstrategy to ensure that the Gaussian distribution of the sampled features\nclosely matches the Gaussian distribution of all unlabeled features within the\ncluster. Our CBS can be plugged and played into those CIL methods which are\nbased on pretrained models with prompts tunning technique. Extensive\nexperiments under ACIL protocol across five diverse datasets demonstrate that\nCBS outperforms both random selection and other SOTA active learning\napproaches.

High-dimensional, or multipartite, quantum states are of\nspecific interest, as they can exhibit unique properties both fundamentally and\nin application. The synthesis of high-dimensional, entangled photonic states\ncan take the form of various schemes, which result in varying forms of\nentanglement. Frequency-entanglement is specifically attractive due to\ncompatibility with integrated systems and resistance to decoherence in fiber\ntransportation; however, increasing the dimension of frequency-entangled states\nrequires a system that offers quantum interactions between a large set of\ndistinct frequencies. Here, we show how the phonon-photon interactions of\nforward Brillouin scattering, which offer access to a ladder of optical\nresonances permitted by a single mechanical mode, can be used for\nfast-synthesis of frequency-entangled, single-photon W states. In our proposed\nsystem, simultaneous laser pulses of different frequencies dynamically evolve\neither an injected single photon or a heralded single phonon, generating W\nstates of selected dimension and output frequency. This method enables the\nsynthesis of `perfect' W states by adjusting the pulse amplitudes. In addition,\nwe show how this system can be used for quantum frequency translation.",

Galaxy\nproperties also depend on their location within the host structure and\norientation with respect to the central galaxy: galaxies in the inner regions\nthat are aligned to the major axis of the central galaxy tend to be more\nquenched and redder than galaxies in the outskirts and with random orientation.\nThis phenomenon, called anisotropic satellite galaxy quenching (ASGQ), can be\nexplained in two different ways: invoking either external influences\n(large-scale distribution of matter) or internal factors (black hole activity\nof the central galaxy). In this work, we study the impact of filaments in\nshaping the ASGQ in the local Universe, exploiting the magneto-hydrodynamic\n(MHD) simulation IllustrisTNG. We separated all surviving satellites into young\nand old populations depending on their infall times. We show that only young\nsatellites contribute to the observed ASGQ. These satellites preferentially\ninfall along the major axis of the central galaxy, which tends to have the same\ndirection of the filament feeding the groups. We demonstrate that old\nsatellites were quenched inside their hosts and do not exhibit signatures of\nASGQ. We show that the ASGQ emerges at the time of the infall of the young\nsatellites and is also visible outside $\\rm R_{200}$.

    "abstract": "Vision transformers (ViTs) can be trained using various learning paradigms,\nfrom fully supervised to self-supervised. Diverse training protocols often\nresult in significantly different feature spaces, which are usually compared\nthrough alignment analysis. However, current alignment measures quantify this\nrelationship in terms of a single scalar value, obscuring the distinctions\nbetween common and unique features in pairs of representations that share the\nsame scalar alignment. We address this limitation by combining alignment\nanalysis with concept discovery, which enables a breakdown of alignment into\nsingle concepts encoded in feature space. This fine-grained comparison reveals\nboth universal and unique concepts across different representations, as well as\nthe internal structure of concepts within each of them. Our methodological\ncontributions address two key prerequisites for concept-based alignment: 1) For\na description of the representation in terms of concepts that faithfully\ncapture the geometry of the feature space, we define concepts as the most\ngeneral structure they can possibly form - arbitrary manifolds, allowing hidden\nfeatures to be described by their proximity to these manifolds. 2) To measure\ndistances between concept proximity scores of two representations, we use a\ngeneralized Rand index and partition it for alignment between pairs of\nconcepts. We confirm the superiority of our novel concept definition for\nalignment analysis over existing linear baselines in a sanity check. The\nconcept-based alignment analysis of representations from four different ViTs\nreveals that increased supervision correlates with a reduction in the semantic\nstructure of learned representations.",

    "abstract": "Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have recently been extensively applied to\nmodel the time-evolution in fluid dynamics, weather predictions, and even\nchaotic systems thanks to their ability to capture temporal dependencies and\nsequential patterns in data. Here we present a RNN model based on convolutional\nneural networks for modeling the nonlinear non-adiabatic dynamics of hybrid\nquantum-classical systems. The dynamical evolution of the hybrid systems is\ngoverned by equations of motion for classical degrees of freedom and von\nNeumann equation for electrons. The physics-aware recurrent convolutional\n(PARC) neural network structure incorporates a differentiator-integrator\narchitecture that inductively models the spatiotemporal dynamics of generic\nphysical systems. Validation studies show that the trained PARC model could\nreproduce the space-time evolution of a one-dimensional semi-classical Holstein\nmodel {with comparable accuracy to direct numerical simulations}. We also\ninvestigate the scaling of prediction errors with size of training dataset,\nprediction window, step-size, and model size.",

    "abstract": "The transverse current (j_H) due to anomalous Hall effect (AHE) is usually\nassumed to be perpendicular to the magnetization (m) in ferromagnetic\nmaterials, which governs the experiments in spintronics. Generally, this\nassumption is derived from a continuum model, where the crystal's discrete\nsymmetry is effectively represented by the concept of an effective mass from\nthe band structure. In this paper, we calculate the spin transport through the\nnonmagnetic metal (NM) | ferromagnetic metal (FM) interfaces and find that the\ncorresponding Hall current is generally not perpendicular to m with only a few\nexceptions at high symmetry crystal orientations. The calculation illustrates\nthe breakdown of j_H={\\theta}m{\\times}j_c, where {\\theta} denotes the anomalous\nHall angle and j_c represents the injecting charge current. An analytical\nformula based on the discrete symmetry of the solid can describe this effect\nwell. In this framework, the leading order corresponds to the conventional AHE,\nwhile higher-order terms account for deviations in the Hall current.\nAdditionally, we identify the presence of a chiral anomalous Hall effect (CAHE)\nat interface with odd rotational symmetry (e.g., C_{3v}) and the higher-order\nterms can even dominate the AHE by constructing superlattices. The general\nexistence of hidden chirality in spin transport is also revealed, with a\nspecific focus on interface chirality (IC). Our results highlight the\nsignificance of discrete atomic positions in solids for spin transport, which\nextends beyond the conventional continuum model. Moreover, considering the\nimportant application of the AHE in spintronics and the wide existence of the\ninterfaces in the devices, the breakdown of j_H={\\theta}m{\\times}j_c suggests\nthat all experimental measurements related to the AHE should be re-evaluated.",

When estimating principal causal\neffects, the principal ignorability assumption is commonly invoked, which we\nstudy in detail in this manuscript. Our first key contribution is studying a\ncommonly used strategy of using parametric models to jointly model the outcome\nand principal strata without requiring the principal ignorability assumption.\nWe show that even if the joint distribution of principal strata is known, this\nstrategy necessarily leads to only partial identification of causal effects,\neven under very simple and correctly specified outcome models. While principal\nignorability leads to point identification in this setting, we discuss\nalternative, weaker assumptions and show how they can lead to informative\npartial identification regions. An additional contribution is that we provide\ntheoretical support to strategies used in the literature for identifying\nassociation parameters that govern the joint distribution of principal strata.\nWe prove that this is possible, but only if the principal ignorability\nassumption is violated. Additionally, due to partial identifiability of causal\neffects even when these association parameters are known, we show that these\nassociation parameters are only identifiable under strong parametric\nconstraints. Lastly, we extend these results to more flexible semiparametric\nand nonparametric Bayesian models.",

This study proposes a hybrid framework that ut folds an\nArtificial Intelligence and a Microservices approach for the performance\noptimization of the system. The AI algorithms forecast demand patterns,\noptimize the allocation of resources, and enhance decision-making driven by\nMicroservices architecture, hence decentralizing system components for\nscalability, fault tolerance, and reduced downtime. The model provided focuses\non major problems associated with the travel reservation systems such as\nlatency of systems, load balancing and data consistency. It endows the systems\nwith predictive models based on AI improved ability to forecast user demands.\nMicroservices would also take care of different scales during uneven traffic\npatterns. Hence, both aspects ensure better handling of peak loads and spikes\nwhile minimizing delays and ensuring high service quality. A comparison was\nmade between traditional reservation models, which are monolithic and the new\nmodel of AI-Microservices. Comparatively, the analysis results state that there\nis a drastic improvement in processing times where the system uptime and\nresource utilization proved the capability of AI and the microservices in\ntransforming the travel industry in terms of reservation.

In this paper, we present a comprehensive framework to better\nalign and evaluate multi-view diffusion models with human preferences. To begin\nwith, we first collect and filter a standardized image prompt set from\nDALL$\\cdot$E and Objaverse, which we then use to generate multi-view assets\nwith several multi-view diffusion models. Through a systematic ranking pipeline\non these assets, we obtain a human annotation dataset with 16k expert pairwise\ncomparisons and train a reward model, coined MVReward, to effectively encode\nhuman preferences. With MVReward, image-driven 3D methods can be evaluated\nagainst each other in a more fair and transparent manner. Building on this, we\nfurther propose Multi-View Preference Learning (MVP), a plug-and-play\nmulti-view diffusion tuning strategy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nMVReward can serve as a reliable metric and MVP consistently enhances the\nalignment of multi-view diffusion models with human preferences.",

The Head and Neck Tumor Segmentation\nfor MR-Guided Applications challenge (HNTSMRG-24) comprises two tasks:\nsegmentation of primary gross tumor volume (GTVp) and metastatic lymph nodes\n(GTVn) on T2-weighted MRI volumes obtained at (1) pre-radiotherapy (pre-RT) and\n(2) mid-radiotherapy (mid-RT). The training dataset consists of data from 150\npatients, including MRI volumes of pre-RT, mid-RT, and pre-RT registered to the\ncorresponding mid-RT volumes. Each MRI volume is accompanied by a label mask,\ngenerated by merging independent annotations from a minimum of three experts.\nFor both tasks, we propose adopting the nnU-Net V2 framework by the use of a\n15-fold cross-validation ensemble instead of the standard number of 5 folds for\nincreased robustness and variability. For pre-RT segmentation, we augmented the\ninitial training data (150 pre-RT volumes and masks) with the corresponding\nmid-RT data. For mid-RT segmentation, we opted for a three-channel input,\nwhich, in addition to the mid-RT MRI volume, comprises the registered pre-RT\nMRI volume and the corresponding mask. The mean of the aggregated Dice\nSimilarity Coefficient for GTVp and GTVn is computed on a blind test set and\ndetermines the quality of the proposed methods. These metrics determine the\nfinal ranking of methods for both tasks separately. The final blind testing (50\npatients) of the methods proposed by our team, RUG_UMCG, resulted in an\naggregated Dice Similarity Coefficient of 0.81 (0.77 for GTVp and 0.85 for\nGTVn) for Task 1 and 0.70 (0.54 for GTVp and 0.86 for GTVn) for Task 2.",

Designed to\nhandle the incremental nature of real-world data, the framework operates in an\nonline manner: at each time step, the arbiter collects a batch of data from\nagents, trains a machine learning model, and provides each agent with a\ndistinct model reflecting its data contributions. This setup establishes a\nfeedback loop where shared data influence model updates, and the resulting\nmodels guide future data-sharing policies. Agents evaluate and partition their\ndata, selecting a partition to share using a stochastic parameterized policy,\nlearned via policy gradient methods to optimize the utility of the received\nmodel as defined by agent-specific evaluation functions. On the arbiter side,\nthe expected loss function over the true data distribution is optimized,\nincorporating agent-specific weights to account for distributional differences\narising from diverse sources and selective sharing. A bilevel optimization\nalgorithm jointly learns the model parameters and agent-specific weights.\nMean-zero noise, computed using a distortion function that adjusts these\nagent-specific weights, is introduced to generate distinct agent-specific\nmodels, promoting valuable data sharing without requiring separate training.\nOur framework is underpinned by non-asymptotic analyses, ensuring convergence\nof the agent-side policy optimization to an approximate stationary point of the\nevaluation functions and convergence of the arbiter-side optimization to an\napproximate stationary point of the expected loss function.",

However, these high mobilities--often obtained via\ntwo-probe (2P) methods on devices with small channel length-to-width ratios\n(L/W < 0.5) operating in the saturation regime at high drain-source\ncurrents--raise concerns about overestimation due to contact resistance and\nnon-ideal FET characteristics. Here, we performed gated four-point probe (4PP)\nFET measurements on Hall bar devices (L/W = 6) of Cs0.15FA0.85SnI3, obtaining a\nconsistent mobility of 3.3 cm2V-1s-1. Upon comparing these with gated 2P\nmeasurements of narrow-channel FETs (L/W = 0.1) on the same chip, we resolved\nthe contact resistance (R_C). The 2P linear mobility is underestimated due to\nvoltage drops across R_C, while the 2P saturation mobility is overestimated\nbecause of high (dR_C)/(dV_G) near the threshold. Contact resistance effects\nbecome more pronounced at lower temperatures. Contact-corrected\nfour-point-probe (4PP) mobilities are independent of bias conditions and are\nobserved to flatten at temperatures lower than 180 K. Future reports of\nperovskite FET mobilities should include gated 4PP measurements and use devices\nwith larger L/W ratios to minimize nonidealities arising from contact\nresistance effects.",

In contrast,\nlinear attention naturally enjoys linear complexity and has great potential to\nscale up to higher-resolution images. Nonetheless, the unsatisfactory\nperformance of linear attention greatly limits its practical application in\nvarious scenarios. In this paper, we take a step forward to close the gap\nbetween the linear and Softmax attention with novel theoretical analyses, which\ndemystify the core factors behind the performance deviations. Specifically, we\npresent two key perspectives to understand and alleviate the limitations of\nlinear attention: the injective property and the local modeling ability.\nFirstly, we prove that linear attention is not injective, which is prone to\nassign identical attention weights to different query vectors, thus adding to\nsevere semantic confusion since different queries correspond to the same\noutputs. Secondly, we confirm that effective local modeling is essential for\nthe success of Softmax attention, in which linear attention falls short. The\naforementioned two fundamental differences significantly contribute to the\ndisparities between these two attention paradigms, which is demonstrated by our\nsubstantial empirical validation in the paper. In addition, more experiment\nresults indicate that linear attention, as long as endowed with these two\nproperties, can outperform Softmax attention across various tasks while\nmaintaining lower computation complexity.

Despite its high declination, it has been possible to perform\nsuccessful observations with the Atacama Large Millimeter and submillimeter\nArray at 1.4 mm in the continuum emission and a number of molecular tracers.\nThe new data allow us to improve on previous similar observations and confirm\nthe existence of a Keplerian accretion disk around a ~12 Msun (proto)star. From\nmethyl cyanide, we derived the rotation temperature and column density as a\nfunction of disk radius. We also obtained a map of the same quantities for the\njet using the ratio between two lines of formaldehyde. We use two simple models\nof the jet and the disk to estimate the basic geometrical and kinematical\nparameters of the two. We conclude that the disk is stable at all radii. We\nalso estimate an accretion rate of ~0.001 Msun/yr. Our analysis confirms that\nthe jet from IRAS20126+4104 is highly collimated, lies close to the plane of\nthe sky, and expands with velocity increasing with distance.

The disk is\nundergoing Keplerian rotation but a non-negligible radial velocity component is\nalso present that is equal to ~40% of the rotational component. The disk is\nslightly inclined with respect to the line of sight and has a dusty envelope\nthat absorbs the emission from the disk surface. This causes a slight\ndistortion of the disk structure observed in high-density tracers.

    "abstract": "We investigated the emerging traffic patterns of Argentine ants (Linepithema\nhumile) as they navigated a narrow bridge between their nest and a food source.\nBy tracking ant movements in experiments with varying bridge widths and colony\nsizes and analyzing the resulting trajectories, we discovered that a small\nsubset of ants stopped for long periods of time, acting as obstacles and\naffecting traffic flow. Interestingly, the fraction of these stopped ants\nincreased with wider bridges, suggesting a mechanism to reduce traffic flow to\na narrower section of the bridge. To quantify transport efficiency, we measured\nthe average speed of the ants on the bridge as a function of the pressure of\nants arriving at the bridge, finding this relationship to be an increasing but\nsaturating function of the pressure. We developed an agent-based model for ant\nmovement and interactions to better understand these dynamics. Including\nstopped agents in the model was crucial to explaining the experimental\nobservations. We further validated our hypothesis by introducing artificial\nobstacles on the bridges and found that our simulations accurately mirrored the\nexperimental data when these obstacles were included. These findings provide\nnew insights into how Argentine ants self-organize to manage traffic,\nhighlighting a unique form of dynamic obstruction that enhances traffic flow in\nhigh-density conditions. This study advances our understanding of\nself-regulation in biological traffic systems and suggests potential\napplications for managing human traffic in congested environments.",

The\nprecession of the molecular spin, and hence, the inelastic tunnelling processes\ninvolving spin-flip events between molecular quasienergy levels, driven by this\nprecession, can be controlled by the uniaxial magnetic anisotropy parameter. By\nsetting the Larmor precession frequency, the tilt angle of molecular\nmagnetization with respect to the magnetic field, and the magnetic anisotropy\nparameter, one can modulate the spin-current components and noise,\nspin-transfer torque and related torque coefficients. Moreover, the dc-spin\ncurrent and spin-transfer torque components provide the quasienergy level\nstructure in the orbital and the torque vanishes for a suppressed molecular\nspin precession, obtained by proper adjustment of the anisotropy parameter and\nmagnetic field, allowing to reveal the anisotropy parameter via a dc-spin\ncurrent or torque measurement. The results of the study show that spin\ntransport and spin-transfer torque generated on the anisotropic molecular spin\ncan be manipulated by the uniaxial anisotropy parameter of the molecular spin\neven in the absence of the magnetic field.",

Existing emotional speech\ndatabases often suffer from overly simplistic labelling schemes that fail to\ncapture a wide range of emotional states, thus limiting the effectiveness of\nemotion synthesis in TTS applications. To this end, recent efforts have\nfocussed on building databases that use natural language annotations to\ndescribe speech emotions.

In this paper, we propose a novel\nprocess aimed at building databases by systematically extracting emotion-rich\nspeech segments and annotating them with detailed natural language descriptions\nthrough a generative model. This approach enhances the emotional granularity of\nthe database and significantly reduces the reliance on costly manual\nannotations by automatically augmenting the data with high-level language\nmodels.

We also find that fresh (unweathered) fine-grained\nsurfaces can serve as a false positive to the detection of moderate atmospheric\nheat redistribution through eclipse observations. However, we argue that such\nsurfaces are unlikely given the ubiquity of space weathering in the Solar\nSystem, the low albedo of Solar System airless bodies, and the high stellar\nwind environments of M-Earths. Emission data from a larger sample of M-Earths\nwill be able to confirm or reject this tentative trend and diagnose its cause\nthrough spectral characterization.",

However, existing methods treat feature selection and\ninstance selection as two separate processes, failing to leverage the potential\ninteractions between the feature and instance spaces. Addi-tionally, previous\nco-selection methods for multi-view data require concatenating different views,\nwhich overlooks the consistent information among them.

Specifically, CONDEN-FI reconstructs mul-ti-view data from both the\nsample and feature spaces to learn representations that are consistent across\nviews and specific to each view, enabling the simultaneous selection of the\nmost important features and instances. Moreover, CONDEN-FI adaptively learns a\nview-consensus similarity graph to help select both dissimilar and similar\nsamples in the reconstructed data space, leading to a more diverse selection of\ninstances. An efficient algorithm is developed to solve the resultant\noptimization problem, and the comprehensive experimental results on real-world\ndatasets demonstrate that CONDEN-FI is effective compared to state-of-the-art\nmethods.",

    "abstract": "The process of speciation, where an ancestral species divides in two or more\nnew species, involves several geographic, environmental and genetic components\nthat interact in a complex way. Understanding all these elements at once is\nchallenging and simple models can help unveiling the role of each factor\nseparately. The Derrida-Higgs model describes the evolution of a sexually\nreproducing population subjected to mutations in a well mixed population.\nIndividuals are characterized by a string with entries $\\pm1$ representing a\nhaploid genome with biallelic genes. If mating is restricted by genetic\nsimilarity, so that only individuals that are sufficiently similar can mate,\nsympatric speciation, i.e. the emergence of species without geographic\nisolation, can occur. Only four parameters rule the dynamics: population size\n$N$, mutation rate $\\mu$, minimum similarity for mating $q_{min}$ and genome\nsize $B$. In the limit $B\\rightarrow\\infty$, speciation occurs if the simple\ncondition $q_{min}>(1+4\\mu N)^{-1}$ is satisfied. However, this condition fails\nfor finite genomes, and speciation does not occur if the genome size is too\nsmall. This indicates the existence of a critical genome size for speciation.\nIn this work, we develop an analytical theory of the distribution of\nsimilarities between individuals, a quantity that defines how tight or spread\nout is the genetic content of the population. This theory is carried out in the\nabsence of mating restrictions, where evolution equations for the mean and\nvariance of the similarity distribution can be derived. We then propose a\nheuristic description of the speciation transition which allows us to\nnumerically calculate the critical genome size for speciation as a function of\nthe other model parameters. The result is in good agreement with the\nsimulations of the model and may guide further investigations on theoretical\nconditions for species formation.",

It consists of 3,400 test cases, primarily focused on\ncompetition- and Olympiad-level math problems. Each test case contains a\nstep-by-step solution with error location annotated by human experts. Models\nare required to identify the earliest step that contains an error, or conclude\nthat all steps are correct. We conduct extensive evaluation on ProcessBench,\ninvolving two types of models: process reward models (PRMs) and critic models,\nwhere for the latter we prompt general language models to critique each\nsolution step by step. We draw two main observations: (1) Existing PRMs\ntypically fail to generalize to more challenging math problems beyond GSM8K and\nMATH. They underperform both critic models (i.e., prompted general language\nmodels) and our own trained PRM that is straightforwardly fine-tuned on the\nPRM800K dataset.

Quasicrystals allow the study of quantum critical phenomena in\naperiodic systems with frustrated magnetic interactions. Here, we study the\nmagnetic field and temperature scaling of the low-temperature specific heat for\nthe quantum critical Yb-Au-Al quasicrystal. We devise a scaling function that\nencapsulates the limiting behaviors as well as the area where the system goes\nfrom a temperature-limited to a field-limited quantum critical region, where\nmagnetic field acts as a cutoff for critical fluctuations. The zero-field\nelectronic specific heat is described by a power-law divergence, ${C_{el}/T\n\\propto T^{-0.54}}$, aligning with previously observed ac-susceptibility and\nspecific heat measurements. The field dependence of the electronic specific\nheat at high magnetic fields shows a similar power-law ${C_{el}/T \\propto\nB^{-0.50}}$. In the zero-field and low-field region, we observe two small but\ndistinct anomalies in the specific heat, located at 0.7 K and 2.1 K.",

Despite the far-reaching impact of such attacks, the lifecycle of\nchipset vulnerabilities has yet to be investigated, with existing papers\nprimarily investigating vulnerabilities in the Android operating system. This\npaper provides a comprehensive and empirical study of the current state of\nsmartphone chipset vulnerability management within the Android ecosystem. For\nthe first time, we create a unified knowledge base of 3,676 chipset\nvulnerabilities affecting 437 chipset models from all four major chipset\nmanufacturers, combined with 6,866 smartphone models. Our analysis revealed\nthat the same vulnerabilities are often included in multiple generations of\nchipsets, providing novel empirical evidence that vulnerabilities are inherited\nthrough multiple chipset generations. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the\ncommonly accepted 90-day responsible vulnerability disclosure period is seldom\nadhered to. We find that a single vulnerability often affects hundreds to\nthousands of different smartphone models, for which update availability is, as\nwe show, often unclear or heavily delayed. Leveraging the new insights gained\nfrom our empirical analysis, we recommend several changes that chipset\nmanufacturers can implement to improve the security posture of their products.\nAt the same time, our knowledge base enables academic researchers to conduct\nmore representative evaluations of smartphone chipsets, accurately assess the\nimpact of vulnerabilities they discover, and identify avenues for future\nresearch.",

For the hypersonic\nflow around an X38-like space vehicle, the simulation, which utilizes\n$1,058,685$ physical mesh cells and $4,548$ discrete velocity space mesh cells,\nrequires only $168.12$ GB of memory when executed on $512$ CPU cores.

Despite its success, the mechanism that drives the\nsuccess of IMP remains unclear. One possibility is that IMP is capable of\nextracting subnetworks with good inductive biases that facilitate performance.\nSupporting this idea, recent work showed that applying IMP to fully connected\nneural networks (FCNs) leads to the emergence of local receptive fields (RFs),\na feature of mammalian visual cortex and convolutional neural networks that\nfacilitates image processing. However, it remains unclear why IMP would uncover\nlocalized features in the first place. Inspired by results showing that\ntraining on synthetic images with highly non-Gaussian statistics (e.g., sharp\nedges) is sufficient to drive the emergence of local RFs in FCNs, we\nhypothesize that IMP iteratively increases the non-Gaussian statistics of FCN\nrepresentations, creating a feedback loop that enhances localization. Here, we\ndemonstrate first that non-Gaussian input statistics are indeed necessary for\nIMP to discover localized RFs. We then develop a new method for measuring the\neffect of individual weights on the statistics of the FCN representations\n(\"cavity method\"), which allows us to show that IMP systematically increases\nthe non-Gaussianity of pre-activations, leading to the formation of localized\nRFs. Our work, which is the first to study the effect of IMP on the statistics\nof the representations of neural networks, sheds parsimonious light on one way\nin which IMP can drive the formation of strong inductive biases.",

    "abstract": "Among the growing number of small body rings in the solar system, the ring of\nHaumea has a special status as it is likely suitable for direct imaging in the\nvisible and submillimeter wavelengths. In this paper, we highlight its sole\ndetectability among Centaur/TNO rings using both the ALMA and the James Webb\nSpace Telescope to provide direct constraints on the ring composition for the\nfirst time. To overcome the limitations of the currently used simple ring\nmodels, we introduce radiative transfer modeling for small body ring systems.\nHere we perform a thorough analysis of the Haumea ring considering different\nmaterials and grain sizes, assuming that the ring consists of small particles\nwith sizes below 1 mm. We present spectral energy distributions of each model\nfor future comparison with multiwavelength measurements, providing a diagnostic\ntool to determine the dominant grain size and characteristic material of the\nring, which are essential inputs for ring formation and evolution theories. Our\nresults also show that for some sub-micron carbon-like or silicate grains,\ntheir mid-infrared excess can be detected even if the ring is not resolved,\nproviding a tracer for small grains around the object.",

    "abstract": "Legal exploration, analysis, and interpretation remain complex and demanding\ntasks, even for experienced legal scholars, due to the domain-specific\nlanguage, tacit legal concepts, and intentional ambiguities embedded in legal\ntexts. In related, text-based domains, Visual Analytics (VA) and Large Language\nModels (LLMs) have become indispensable tools for navigating documents,\nrepresenting knowledge, and supporting analytical reasoning. However, legal\nscholarship presents distinct challenges: it requires managing formal legal\nstructure, drawing on tacit domain knowledge, and documenting intricate and\naccurate reasoning processes - needs that current VA systems designs and LLMs\nfail to address adequately. We identify previously unexamined key challenges\nand underexplored opportunities in applying VA to jurisprudence to explore how\nthese technologies might better serve the legal domain. Based on\nsemi-structured interviews with nine legal experts, we find a significant gap\nin tools and means that can externalize tacit legal knowledge in a form that is\nboth explicit and machine-interpretable. Hence, we propose leveraging\ninteractive visualization for this articulation, teaching the machine relevant\nsemantic relationships between legal documents that inform the predictions of\nLLMs, facilitating the enhanced navigation between hierarchies of legal\ncollections. This work introduces a user-centered VA workflow to the\njurisprudential context, recognizing tacit legal knowledge and expert\nexperience as vital components in deriving legal insight, comparing it with\nestablished practices in other text-based domains, and outlining a research\nagenda that offers future guidance for researchers in Visual Analytics for law\nand beyond.",

To achieve accurate spatial\ndistribution estimation, the analysis needs to collect sufficient user data.\nHowever, collecting data directly from individuals could compromise their\nprivacy. Most previous works focused on private distribution estimation for\none-dimensional data, which does not consider spatial data relation and leads\nto poor accuracy for spatial distribution estimation. In this paper, we address\nthe problem of private spatial distribution estimation, where we collect\nspatial data from individuals and aim to minimize the distance between the\nactual distribution and estimated one under Local Differential Privacy (LDP).\nTo leverage the numerical nature of the domain, we project spatial data and its\nrelationships onto a one-dimensional distribution. We then use this projection\nto estimate the overall spatial distribution. Specifically, we propose a\nreporting mechanism called Disk Area Mechanism (DAM), which projects the\nspatial domain onto a line and optimizes the estimation using the sliced\nWasserstein distance. Through extensive experiments, we show the effectiveness\nof our DAM approach on both real and synthetic data sets, compared with the\nstate-of-the-art methods, such as Multi-dimensional Square Wave Mechanism\n(MDSW) and Subset Exponential Mechanism with Geo-I (SEM-Geo-I).

In\nthis work, we propose Skills Scaling Laws (SSLaws, pronounced as Sloth), a\nnovel scaling law that leverages publicly available benchmark data and assumes\nLLM performance is driven by low-dimensional latent skills, such as reasoning\nand instruction following. These latent skills are influenced by computational\nresources like model size and training tokens but with varying efficiencies\nacross model families.

We begin by\nproving that the storage capacities of both linear and MLP associative memories\nscale linearly with parameter count. We next introduce a synthetic factual\nrecall task, and prove that a transformer with a single layer of self-attention\nfollowed by an MLP can obtain 100% accuracy on the task whenever either the\ntotal number of self-attention parameters or MLP parameters scales (up to log\nfactors) linearly with the number of facts. In particular, the transformer can\ntrade off between using the value matrices or the MLP as an associative memory\nto store the dataset of facts.

Instead, the MSF model introduces parameters that\nencapsulate the effects traditionally attributed to dark energy. To test the\nviability of this MSF, we constrained the model using the observational Hubble\nparameter (OHD), distance modulus measurements (SNIa), and their combined\ndatasets (OHD + SNIa). We implement a Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC)\nsimulation to find the best-fit values of the model parameters. The MSF model\nproduced best-fit values for the parameter $p$ associated with the power law of\nthe matter-dominated era and $\\beta$, the exponential parameter for the\ndarkenergy-dominated era. For our MSF, these values are $p$ = 0.28 and $\\beta$\n= 0.52 when using SNIa data, $p$ = 0.63 and $\\beta$ = 0.30 for OHD data and $p$\n= 0.45 and $\\beta$ = 0.53 for a combination of datasets (OHD + SNIa). The\nnumerical results and plots of the deceleration parameter, fractional energy\ndensity, Hubble parameter, and luminosity distance are presented which are the\nkey parameters for studying the accelerated expansion of the universe. We\ncompare the results of our model with that of the $\\Lambda$CDM model and\nreconcile them with astronomical observational data. Our results indicate that\nthe MSF model shows promise, demonstrating good compatibility with current\nastronomical observations and performing comparably to the $\\Lambda$CDM model\nacross various datasets, particularly in predicting the accelerating expansion\nof the universe, while providing a unified framework that incorporates the\nsimultaneous influence of matter and dark energy components.",

Despite their remarkable\nperformance, LLMs face a critical challenge: the propensity to produce\nunreliable outputs due to the inherent limitations of their learning-based\nnature. Formal methods (FMs), on the other hand, are a well-established\ncomputation paradigm that provides mathematically rigorous techniques for\nmodeling, specifying, and verifying the correctness of systems. FMs have been\nextensively applied in mission-critical software engineering, embedded systems,\nand cybersecurity. However, the primary challenge impeding the deployment of\nFMs in real-world settings lies in their steep learning curves, the absence of\nuser-friendly interfaces, and issues with efficiency and adaptability.\n  This position paper outlines a roadmap for advancing the next generation of\ntrustworthy AI systems by leveraging the mutual enhancement of LLMs and FMs.\nFirst, we illustrate how FMs, including reasoning and certification techniques,\ncan help LLMs generate more reliable and formally certified outputs.\nSubsequently, we highlight how the advanced learning capabilities and\nadaptability of LLMs can significantly enhance the usability, efficiency, and\nscalability of existing FM tools. Finally, we show that unifying these two\ncomputation paradigms -- integrating the flexibility and intelligence of LLMs\nwith the rigorous reasoning abilities of FMs -- has transformative potential\nfor the development of trustworthy AI software systems. We acknowledge that\nthis integration has the potential to enhance both the trustworthiness and\nefficiency of software engineering practices while fostering the development of\nintelligent FM tools capable of addressing complex yet real-world challenges.",

    "abstract": "Anomaly synthesis is a crucial approach to augment abnormal data for\nadvancing anomaly inspection. Based on the knowledge from the large-scale\npre-training, existing text-to-image anomaly synthesis methods predominantly\nfocus on textual information or coarse-aligned visual features to guide the\nentire generation process. However, these methods often lack sufficient\ndescriptors to capture the complicated characteristics of realistic anomalies\n(e.g., the fine-grained visual pattern of anomalies), limiting the realism and\ngeneralization of the generation process. To this end, we propose a novel\nanomaly synthesis framework called AnomalyControl to learn cross-modal semantic\nfeatures as guidance signals, which could encode the generalized anomaly cues\nfrom text-image reference prompts and improve the realism of synthesized\nabnormal samples. Specifically, AnomalyControl adopts a flexible and\nnon-matching prompt pair (i.e., a text-image reference prompt and a targeted\ntext prompt), where a Cross-modal Semantic Modeling (CSM) module is designed to\nextract cross-modal semantic features from the textual and visual descriptors.\nThen, an Anomaly-Semantic Enhanced Attention (ASEA) mechanism is formulated to\nallow CSM to focus on the specific visual patterns of the anomaly, thus\nenhancing the realism and contextual relevance of the generated anomaly\nfeatures. Treating cross-modal semantic features as the prior, a Semantic\nGuided Adapter (SGA) is designed to encode effective guidance signals for the\nadequate and controllable synthesis process. Extensive experiments indicate\nthat AnomalyControl can achieve state-of-the-art results in anomaly synthesis\ncompared with existing methods while exhibiting superior performance for\ndownstream tasks.",

    "abstract": "Predictive maintenance (PdM) is increasingly pursued to reduce wind farm\noperation and maintenance costs by accurately predicting the remaining useful\nlife (RUL) and strategically scheduling maintenance. However, the remoteness of\nwind farms often renders current methodologies ineffective, as they fail to\nprovide a sufficiently reliable advance time window for maintenance planning,\nlimiting PdM's practicality. This study introduces a novel deep learning (DL)\nmethodology for future RUL forecasting. By employing a multi-parametric\nattention-based DL approach that bypasses feature engineering, thereby\nminimizing the risk of human error, two models: ForeNet-2d and ForeNet-3d are\nproposed. These models successfully forecast the RUL for seven multifaceted\nwind turbine (WT) failures with a 2-week forecast window. The most precise\nforecast deviated by only 10 minutes from the actual RUL, while the least\naccurate prediction deviated by 1.8 days, with most predictions being off by\nonly a few hours. This methodology offers a substantial time frame to access\nremote WTs and perform necessary maintenance, thereby enabling the practical\nimplementation of PdM.",

Methods. In this work\nwe propose an extensive benchmark of the accuracy and cost-effectiveness of a\npanel of FL and CBL methods in a wide range of collaborative medical data\nanalysis scenarios. The benchmark includes 7 different medical datasets,\nencompassing 3 machine learning tasks, 8 different data modalities, and\nmulti-centric settings involving 3 to 23 clients. Findings. Our results reveal\nthat CBL is a cost-effective alternative to FL. When compared across the panel\nof medical dataset in the considered benchmark, CBL methods provide equivalent\naccuracy to the one achieved by FL.Nonetheless, CBL significantly reduces\ntraining time and communication cost (resp. 15 fold and 60 fold decrease) (p <\n0.05).

In recent years, several works obtained improved bounds under\nvarious algebraic assumptions -- e.g., if the hypergraph is semialgebraic.\n  In this paper we study the problem in a geometric setting -- for $r$-partite\nintersection hypergraphs of families of geometric objects. Our main results are\nessentially sharp bounds for families of axis-parallel boxes in $\\mathbb{R}^d$\nand families of pseudo-discs. For axis-parallel boxes, we obtain the sharp\nbound $O_{d,r}(tn^{r-1}(\\frac{\\log n}{\\log \\log n})^{d-1})$. The best previous\nbound was larger by a factor of about $(\\log n)^{d(2^{r-1}-2)}$.

While potentially beneficial, this synthetic\ndata generation process has been relatively underexplored in cancer\nhistopathology. One algorithm for synthesising a realistic image is diffusion;\nit iteratively converts an image to noise and learns the recovery process from\nthis noise [Wang and Vastola, 2023]. While effective, it is highly\ncomputationally expensive for high-resolution images, rendering it infeasible\nfor histopathology. The development of Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) has\nallowed us to learn the representation of complex high-resolution images in a\nlatent space. A vital by-product of this is the ability to compress\nhigh-resolution images to space and recover them lossless. The marriage of\ndiffusion and VAEs allows us to carry out diffusion in the latent space of an\nautoencoder, enabling us to leverage the realistic generative capabilities of\ndiffusion while maintaining reasonable computational requirements.

The framework is separated into a\nreduced-order modeling and an inference part. Given a dataset of torque\nsignals, each corresponding to a different set of design parameters, torque\ndimension is first reduced by post-processing a discrete Fourier transform and\nkeeping a reduced number of frequency components. This allows to take advantage\nof torque periodicity and preserve physical information contained in the\nfrequency components. Next, a response surface model is computed by means of\nmachine learning regression, which maps the design parameters to the reduced\nfrequency components. The response surface models of choice are polynomial\nchaos expansions, feedforward neural networks, and Gaussian processes. Torque\ninference is performed by evaluating the response surface model for new design\nparameters and then inverting the dimension reduction. Numerical results show\nthat the resulting surrogate models lead to sufficiently accurate torque\npredictions for previously unseen design configurations. The framework is found\nto be significantly advantageous compared to approximating the original (not\nreduced) torque signal directly, as well as slightly advantageous compared to\nusing principal component analysis for dimension reduction. The combination of\ndiscrete Fourier transform-based dimension reduction with Gaussian\nprocess-based response surfaces yields the best-in-class surrogate model for\nthis use case.

However, existing works often\noverlook the geo-diversity of cultural and legal standards across the world. To\ndemonstrate the challenges posed by geo-diverse safety standards, we introduce\nSafeWorld, a novel benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLMs' ability to\ngenerate responses that are not only helpful but also culturally sensitive and\nlegally compliant across diverse global contexts. SafeWorld encompasses 2,342\ntest user queries, each grounded in high-quality, human-verified cultural norms\nand legal policies from 50 countries and 493 regions/races. On top of it, we\npropose a multi-dimensional automatic safety evaluation framework that assesses\nthe contextual appropriateness, accuracy, and comprehensiveness of responses.\nOur evaluations reveal that current LLMs struggle to meet these criteria. To\nenhance LLMs' alignment with geo-diverse safety standards, we synthesize\nhelpful preference pairs for Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) alignment\ntraining. The preference pair construction aims to encourage LLMs to behave\nappropriately and provide precise references to relevant cultural norms and\npolicies when necessary. Our trained SafeWorldLM outperforms all competing\nmodels, including GPT-4o on all three evaluation dimensions by a large margin.\nGlobal human evaluators also note a nearly 20% higher winning rate in\nhelpfulness and harmfulness evaluation.

Conventional wisdom\nsuggests that these problems are intractable since they have to be formulated\nand solved with a significant number of integer variables. Here, we devise a\nscalable local algorithm for the CBCP problem that guarantees convergence to an\napproximate Karush-Kuhn-Tucker point. Our approach is novel in that it\neliminates the use of integer variables altogether, instead introducing a\ncardinality constraint that limits the number of toll locations to a\nuser-specified upper bound. The resulting bilevel program with the cardinality\nconstraint is then transformed into a block-separable, single-level\noptimization problem that can be solved efficiently after penalization and\ndecomposition. We are able to apply the algorithm to solve, in about 20\nminutes, a CBCP instance with up to 3,000 links.

In this\nframework, dependence between $X$ and $Y$ in $D$, denoted $B(X,Y|D)$, is\nquantified as $P(H_1|D)$, the posterior probability for the model of dependence\ngiven $D$, or any strictly increasing function thereof. It is therefore a\nmeasure of the evidence for dependence between $X$ and $Y$ as modeled by $H_1$\nand observed in $D$. We review several statistical models and reconsider\nstandard results in the light of $B(X,Y|D)$ as a measure of dependence. Using\nsimulations, we focus on two specific issues: the effect of noise and the\nbehavior of $B(X,Y|D)$ when $H_1$ has a parameter coding for the intensity of\ndependence. We then derive some general properties of $B(X,Y|D)$, showing that\nit quantifies the information contained in $D$ in favor of $H_1$ versus $H_0$.\nWhile some of these properties are typical of what is expected from a valid\nmeasure of dependence, others are novel and naturally appear as desired\nfeatures for specific measures of dependence, which we call inferential. We\nfinally put these results in perspective; in particular, we discuss the\nconsequences of using the Bayesian framework as well as the similarities and\ndifferences between $B(X,Y|D)$ and mutual information.",

Despite its\npotential, atomic-scale investigations of RG remain limited, hindering a\ndetailed microscopic understanding of the origins of these correlated states.\nIn this study, we employ scanning probe microscopy and spectroscopy to probe\nthe intrinsic electronic states in trilayer and tetralayer RG. We identify a\ncorrelated insulating state with a 17 meV gap at the charge neutrality point in\ntetralayer RG, which is absent in the trilayer configuration. This gap is\nsuppressed by applying a perpendicular magnetic field or doping the charge\ncarrier density and does not exhibit inter-valley coherence patterns. We\nattribute this phenomenon to a symmetry-broken layer antiferromagnetic state,\ncharacterized by ferrimagnetic ordering in the outermost layers and\nantiferromagnetic coupling between them. To further investigate this magnetic\ncorrelated state, we conduct local scattering experiments. Within the\ncorrelated regime, a bound state emerges around a non-magnetic impurity but is\nabsent near magnetic impurities, suggesting that non-magnetic doping induces a\nspin texture in the ferrimagnetic surface layers. Outside the correlated\nregime, Friedel oscillations are observed, allowing precise determination of\nthe band dispersion in tetralayer RG.

Configurations on Fictitious branches show\na vibrational density of states (VDoS) scaling as $D(\\omega) \\sim \\omega^3$,\nwhile those on True elastic branches under simple and pure shear deformations\nexhibit a scaling of $D(\\omega) \\sim \\omega^{5.5}$. Ensemble averaging over\nboth types of branches results in a VDoS scaling of $D(\\omega) \\sim \\omega^4$.\nAdditionally, solids relaxed to their shear minima, with no residual shear\nstress, display a steeper scaling of $D(\\omega) \\sim \\omega^{6.5}$ in both two\nand three dimensions. We propose two limiting behaviors for amorphous solids:\nif the system size is increased without addressing instabilities, the\nlow-frequency VDoS scales with an exponent close to $3$.

However,\nthe line-of-sight dominance in air-to-ground communications often leads to\nsignificant interference with terrestrial networks, reducing communication\nefficiency among terrestrial terminals. This paper explores a novel uplink\ninterference mitigation approach based on the collaborative beamforming (CB)\nmethod in multi-UAV network systems. Specifically, the UAV swarm forms a\nUAV-enabled virtual antenna array (VAA) to achieve the transmissions of\ngathered data to multiple base stations (BSs) for data backup and distributed\nprocessing. However, there is a trade-off between the effectiveness of CB-based\ninterference mitigation and the energy conservation of UAVs. Thus, by jointly\noptimizing the excitation current weights and hover position of UAVs as well as\nthe sequence of data transmission to various BSs, we formulate an uplink\ninterference mitigation multi-objective optimization problem (MOOP) to decrease\ninterference affection, enhance transmission efficiency, and improve energy\nefficiency, simultaneously. In response to the computational demands of the\nformulated problem, we introduce an evolutionary computation method, namely\nchaotic non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (CNSGA-II) with multiple\nimproved operators. The proposed CNSGA-II efficiently addresses the formulated\nMOOP, outperforming several other comparative algorithms, as evidenced by the\noutcomes of the simulations.

Accurate predictions require the use of spatial\ninformation to model surgical interactions. However, current methods focus\nsolely on surgical instruments, assume static interactions between instruments,\nand only anticipate surgical events within a fixed time horizon. To address\nthese challenges, we propose an adaptive graph learning framework for surgical\nworkflow anticipation based on a novel spatial representation, featuring three\nkey innovations. First, we introduce a new representation of spatial\ninformation based on bounding boxes of surgical instruments and targets,\nincluding their detection confidence levels. These are trained on additional\nannotations we provide for two benchmark datasets. Second, we design an\nadaptive graph learning method to capture dynamic interactions. Third, we\ndevelop a multi-horizon objective that balances learning objectives for\ndifferent time horizons, allowing for unconstrained predictions. Evaluations on\ntwo benchmarks reveal superior performance in short-to-mid-term anticipation,\nwith an error reduction of approximately 3% for surgical phase anticipation and\n9% for remaining surgical duration anticipation.

    "abstract": "Uncertainty quantification (UQ) is essential for assessing the reliability of\nEarth observation (EO) products. However, the extensive use of machine learning\nmodels in EO introduces an additional layer of complexity, as those models\nthemselves are inherently uncertain. While various UQ methods do exist for\nmachine learning models, their performance on EO datasets remains largely\nunevaluated. A key challenge in the community is the absence of the ground\ntruth for uncertainty, i.e. how certain the uncertainty estimates are, apart\nfrom the labels for the image/signal. This article fills this gap by\nintroducing three benchmark datasets specifically designed for UQ in EO machine\nlearning models. These datasets address three common problem types in EO:\nregression, image segmentation, and scene classification. They enable a\ntransparent comparison of different UQ methods for EO machine learning models.\nWe describe the creation and characteristics of each dataset, including data\nsources, preprocessing steps, and label generation, with a particular focus on\ncalculating the reference uncertainty. We also showcase baseline performance of\nseveral machine learning models on each dataset, highlighting the utility of\nthese benchmarks for model development and comparison. Overall, this article\noffers a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners working in\nartificial intelligence for EO, promoting a more accurate and reliable quality\nmeasure of the outputs of machine learning models.

    "abstract": "Accessing a full picture of the internal structure of hadrons would be a key\ntopic of hadron physics, with the main motivation to study the strong\ninteraction binding the visible matter. Furthermore, the underlying structure\nof known exotic states remains an unresolved fundamental issue in hadron\nphysics, which is currently being addressed by hadron physics community. It is\nwell known that electromagnetic characteristics can serve as a distinguishing\nfeature for states whose internal structures are complex and not yet fully\nunderstood. The aim of this study is to determine the magnetic moments of\nvector hidden-charm tetraquark states by making use of QCD light-cone sum\nrules. In order to achieve this objective, the states mentioned above are\nconsidered in terms of the diquark-antidiquark structure. Subsequently, a\ncomprehensive examination is conducted, with four distinct interpolating\ncurrents being given particular consideration, as these have the potential to\ncouple with the aforementioned states. It has been observed that there are\nconsiderable discrepancies between the magnetic moment results extracted\nemploying different diquark-antidiquark structures. Such a prediction may be\ninterpreted as the possibility of more than one tetraquark with the identical\nquantum numbers and similar quark constituents, but with different magnetic\nmoments. The numerical predictions yielded have led to the conclusion that the\nmagnetic moments of the vector hidden-charm tetraquark states are capable of\nprojecting the inner structure of these states, which may then be used to\ndetermine their quark-gluon structure and quantum numbers. In order to provide\na comprehensive analysis, the individual quark contributions to the magnetic\nmoments are also examined.",

    "abstract": "Echocardiography is the most widely used imaging to monitor cardiac\nfunctions, serving as the first line in early detection of myocardial ischemia\nand infarction. However, echocardiography often suffers from several artifacts\nincluding sensor noise, lack of contrast, severe saturation, and missing\nmyocardial segments which severely limit its usage in clinical diagnosis. In\nrecent years, several machine learning methods have been proposed to improve\nechocardiography views. Yet, these methods usually address only a specific\nproblem (e.g. denoising) and thus cannot provide a robust and reliable\nrestoration in general. On the other hand, cardiac MRI provides a clean view of\nthe heart without suffering such severe issues. However, due to its\nsignificantly higher cost, it is often only afforded by a few major hospitals,\nhence hindering its use and accessibility. In this pilot study, we propose a\nnovel approach to transform echocardiography into the cardiac MRI view. For\nthis purpose, Echo2MRI dataset, consisting of echocardiography and real cardiac\nMRI image pairs, is composed and will be shared publicly. A dedicated\nCycle-consistent Generative Adversarial Network (Cycle-GAN) is trained to learn\nthe transformation from echocardiography frames to cardiac MRI views. An\nextensive set of qualitative evaluations shows that the proposed transformer\ncan synthesize high-quality artifact-free synthetic cardiac MRI views from a\ngiven sequence of echocardiography frames. Medical evaluations performed by a\ngroup of cardiologists further demonstrate that synthetic MRI views are\nindistinguishable from their original counterparts and are preferred over their\ninitial sequence of echocardiography frames for diagnosis in 78.9% of the\ncases.",

There is growing support for replacing\nthis approach with a model-free estimand and assumption-lean analysis method.\nOne alternative is to base the analysis on the difference in restricted mean\nsurvival time (RMST) at a specific time, a single-number summary measure that\ncan be defined without any restrictive assumptions on the outcome model. In a\nsimple setting without covariates, an assumption-lean analysis can be achieved\nusing nonparametric methods such as Kaplan Meier estimation. The main advantage\nof moving to a model-free summary measure and assumption-lean analysis is that\nthe validity and interpretation of conclusions do not depend on the PH\nassumption. The potential disadvantage is that the nonparametric analysis may\nlose efficiency under PH. There is disagreement in recent literature on this\nissue. Methods: Asymptotic results and simulations are used to compare the\nefficiency of a log-rank test against a nonparametric analysis of the\ndifference in RMST in a superiority trial under PH. Previous studies have\nseparately examined the effect of event rates and the censoring distribution on\nrelative efficiency. This investigation clarifies conflicting results from\nearlier research by exploring the joint effect of event rate and censoring\ndistribution together. Several illustrative examples are provided. Results: In\nscenarios with high event rates and/or substantial censoring across a large\nproportion of the study window, and when both methods make use of the same\namount of data, relative efficiency is close to unity. However, in cases with\nlow event rates but when censoring is concentrated at the end of the study\nwindow, the PH analysis has a considerable efficiency advantage.",

There are\nseveral intrinsic challenges associated with prediction during incidents, such\nas a lack of interpretability and data scarcity. To address these challenges,\nwe propose a two-stage method that separates predictions under normal\nconditions and the causal effects of incidents. First, a normal prediction\nmodel is trained using data from normal situations. Next, the synthetic control\nmethod is employed to identify the causal effects of incidents, combined with\nplacebo tests to determine significant levels of these effects. The significant\neffects are then utilized to train a causal effect prediction model, which can\nforecast the impact of incidents based on features of the incidents and\npassenger flows. During the prediction phase, the results from both the normal\nsituation model and the causal effect prediction model are integrated to\ngenerate final passenger flow predictions during incidents. Our approach is\nvalidated using real-world data, demonstrating improved accuracy. Furthermore,\nthe two-stage methodology enhances interpretability. By analyzing the causal\neffect prediction model, we can identify key influencing factors related to the\neffects of incidents and gain insights into their underlying mechanisms.

This upsampler is based on the observation\nthat convex upsampling can be reformulated as attention, and we propose to use\nlocal attention masks as a drop-in replacement for convex masks to increase the\nmask size. We provide empirical evidence that a larger mask size increases the\nlikelihood of the existence of the convex combination. Lastly, we propose an\nalternative training scheme to remove bilinear interpolation artifacts from the\nmodel output. Our proposed ideas could theoretically be applied to almost every\ncurrent state-of-the-art optical flow architecture. On the FlyingChairs +\nFlyingThings3D training setting we reduce the Sintel Clean training\nend-point-error of RAFT from 1.42 to 1.26, GMA from 1.31 to 1.18, and that of\nFlowFormer from 0.94 to 0.90, by solely adapting the convex upsampler.",

We find that that these vulnerabilities emerge from the\ninteraction between individual and institutional mechanisms.

These individual\ndrivers are reinforced by institutional mechanisms such as lack of financial\ninclusion, access to technology, and economic segregation, leading to\npersistent inequality and poverty traps.

To assess\nthe information gathering abilities of foundation models in interactive\nenvironments, we introduce a framework in which a model must determine the\nfactors influencing a hidden reward function by iteratively reasoning about its\npreviously gathered information and proposing its next exploratory action to\nmaximize information gain at each step. We implement this framework in both a\ntext-based environment, which offers a tightly controlled setting and enables\nhigh-throughput parameter sweeps, and in an embodied 3D environment, which\nrequires addressing complexities of multi-modal interaction more relevant to\nreal-world applications. We further investigate whether approaches such as\nself-correction and increased inference time improve information gathering\nefficiency. In a relatively simple task that requires identifying a single\nrewarding feature, we find that LLM's information gathering capability is close\nto optimal. However, when the model must identify a conjunction of rewarding\nfeatures, performance is suboptimal. The hit in performance is due partly to\nthe model translating task description to a policy and partly to the model's\neffectiveness in using its in-context memory. Performance is comparable in both\ntext and 3D embodied environments, although imperfect visual object recognition\nreduces its accuracy in drawing conclusions from gathered information in the 3D\nembodied case. For single-feature-based rewards, we find that smaller models\ncuriously perform better; for conjunction-based rewards, incorporating self\ncorrection into the model improves performance.",

SORT takes popular API interaction patterns,\nrepresented as frequent subgraphs of model computation graphs, as test\nsubjects. In this way, it introduces realistic API interaction sequences while\nmaintaining efficiency in locating faulty APIs for observed errors. Besides,\nSORT prepares test inputs by referring to extensive features of runtime inputs\nfor each API in executing real-life benchmark data. The generated inputs are\nexpected to better simulate such valid real inputs and reveal bugs more likely\nto happen in real-life usage.

We\nvalidate our task prediction model across actual datasets derived from real\nfactories, achieving SOTA performance. Furthermore, we implement our compelte\nscheduling system in a real-world robotic warehouse for months of lifelong\nvalidation, demonstrating large improvements in key metrics of warehousing,\nsuch as empty running rate, by more than 50%.",

    "abstract": "Recent 4D reconstruction methods have yielded impressive results but rely on\nsharp videos as supervision. However, motion blur often occurs in videos due to\ncamera shake and object movement, while existing methods render blurry results\nwhen using such videos for reconstructing 4D models. Although a few approaches\nattempted to address the problem, they struggled to produce high-quality\nresults, due to the inaccuracy in estimating continuous dynamic representations\nwithin the exposure time. Encouraged by recent works in 3D motion trajectory\nmodeling using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), we take 3DGS as the scene\nrepresentation manner, and propose Deblur4DGS to reconstruct a high-quality 4D\nmodel from blurry monocular video. Specifically, we transform continuous\ndynamic representations estimation within an exposure time into the exposure\ntime estimation. Moreover, we introduce the exposure regularization term,\nmulti-frame, and multi-resolution consistency regularization term to avoid\ntrivial solutions. Furthermore, to better represent objects with large motion,\nwe suggest blur-aware variable canonical Gaussians. Beyond novel-view\nsynthesis, Deblur4DGS can be applied to improve blurry video from multiple\nperspectives, including deblurring, frame interpolation, and video\nstabilization. Extensive experiments in both synthetic and real-world data on\nthe above four tasks show that Deblur4DGS outperforms state-of-the-art 4D\nreconstruction methods.

The Rosetta Paradox characterizes the counterintuitive\nperformance inversions across domains of knowledge. This paradox captures how\nsuch LLMs can excel in highly specialized fields but do poorly on tasks which\nrequire general, everyday knowledge. This paper formalizes the definition of\nthe Rosetta Paradox and introduces a panoramic analysis framework that includes\nboth a Domain Specificity Index (DSI) and a Performance Inversion Metric (PIM)\nfor consistent quantification of domain-specific behavior in LLMs.\n  We adopt this paradox and conduct a series of investigations through\nextensive experiments across diverse models and knowledge domains, ranging from\nrich technical areas to common-sense reasoning. Our findings indicate that the\nRosetta Paradox is likely not a mere artifact of data distribution but an\nintrinsic architectural and emergent property of deep neural networks.

To address this challenge, the BS injects\nartificial noise (AN) to mislead the Eves, and a protected zone is employed to\ncreate an Eve-exclusion area around the BS.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across\nvarious language tasks, but their widespread deployment is impeded by their\nlarge size and high computational costs. Structural pruning is a prevailing\ntechnique used to introduce sparsity into pre-trained models and facilitate\ndirect hardware acceleration during inference by removing redundant connections\n(structurally-grouped parameters), such as channels and attention heads.\nExisting structural pruning approaches often employ either global or layer-wise\npruning criteria; however, they are hindered by ineffectiveness stemming from\ninaccurate evaluation of connection importance. Global pruning methods\ntypically assess component importance using near-zero and unreliable gradients,\nwhile layer-wise pruning approaches encounter significant pruning error\naccumulation issues. To this end, we propose a more accurate pruning metric\nbased on the block-wise importance score propagation, termed LLM-BIP.\nSpecifically, LLM-BIP precisely evaluates connection importance by gauging its\ninfluence on the respective transformer block output, which can be efficiently\napproximated in a single forward pass through an upper bound derived from the\nassumption of Lipschitz continuity. We evaluate the proposed method using\nLLaMA-7B, Vicuna-7B, and LLaMA-13B across common zero-shot tasks. The results\ndemonstrate that our approach achieves an average of 3.26% increase in accuracy\nfor common reasoning tasks compared to previous best baselines.

Driven by the practical\nneed, in this paper, we first propose a novel Continual SAM adaptation (CoSAM)\nbenchmark with 8 different task domains and carefully analyze the limitations\nof the existing SAM one-step adaptation methods in the continual segmentation\nscenario. Then we propose a novel simple-yet-effective Mixture of Domain\nAdapters (MoDA) algorithm which utilizes the Global Feature Tokens (GFT) and\nGlobal Assistant Tokens (GAT) modules to help the SAM encoder extract\nwell-separated features for different task domains, and then provide the\naccurate task-specific information for continual learning.

Moreover, after sequential learning on\nthe CoSAM benchmark with diverse data distributions, our MoDA maintains highly\ncompetitive results in the natural image domain, approaching the zero-shot\nperformance of the original SAM, demonstrating its superior capability in\nknowledge preservation.

We show that with widely used tungsten (W) metal\nelectrode, the spatial distribution of the oxygen vacancy across the\ncross-section plays a key role in dictating the favorability of m- phase\nformation at the metal-HfO2 interface. The energetics are also impacted by the\npolarization direction as well as the depth of oxygen vacancy, i.e., position\nalong the thickness. At the metal - $HfO_2$ interface, when polarization points\ntowards the metal and vacancy forms at trigonally bonded O atomic site, both\ninterfacial relaxation and m- phase formation can lead to dead layers. For\nvacancies at other oxygen atomic sites and polarization direction, dead layer\nis formed due to sole interfacial relaxation with polar phase. We also\nestablish the relative favorability of the m-phase dead layer for different Zr\nconcentrations (x=1 and x = 0.5) and metal electrodes. According to our\nanalysis, 50% Zr doped $HfO_2$ exhibits less probability of m-phase dead layer\nformation compared to pure $HfO_2$. Moreover, with electrodes consisting of\nnoble metal (Pt, Pd, Os, Ru, Rh), m-phase dead layer formation is less likely.\nTherefore, for these metals, dead layer forms mainly due to the interfacial\nrelaxation with polar phase.",

The observed images are analyzed in real-time, and the transients are\npromptly communicated to the observer. The agent modifies them into a real-time\nfollow-up observation proposal and send to the Xinglong observatory group chat,\nthen add them to the next-day observation lists. Additionally, the integration\nof AI agents within the system provides online accessibility, saving\nastronomers' time and encouraging greater participation from amateur\nastronomers in the NGSS project.",

    "abstract": "Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a powerful tool for interpreting\nlanguage model activations by decomposing them into sparse, interpretable\nfeatures. A popular approach is the TopK SAE, that uses a fixed number of the\nmost active latents per sample to reconstruct the model activations. We\nintroduce BatchTopK SAEs, a training method that improves upon TopK SAEs by\nrelaxing the top-k constraint to the batch-level, allowing for a variable\nnumber of latents to be active per sample. As a result, BatchTopK adaptively\nallocates more or fewer latents depending on the sample, improving\nreconstruction without sacrificing average sparsity. We show that BatchTopK\nSAEs consistently outperform TopK SAEs in reconstructing activations from GPT-2\nSmall and Gemma 2 2B, and achieve comparable performance to state-of-the-art\nJumpReLU SAEs. However, an advantage of BatchTopK is that the average number of\nlatents can be directly specified, rather than approximately tuned through a\ncostly hyperparameter sweep. We provide code for training and evaluating\nBatchTopK SAEs at https://github.com/bartbussmann/BatchTopK",

We find that, for the\ntime-averaged KH potential, coherent superpositions of eigenstates perform a\ncyclic motion confined in momentum space, whose frequency is proportional to\nthe energy difference between the two KH eigenstates. This cyclic motion is\nalso present if the full time dependent dynamics are taken into consideration.\nHowever, there are time delays regarding the time-averaged potential, and some\ntail-shaped spilling of the quasiprobability flow towards higher momentum\nregions. These tails are signatures of ionization, indicating that, for the\npotential studied in this work, a small momentum spread is associated with\nstabilization. A comparison of the quasiprobability flow with classical\nphase-space constraints shows that, for the KH atom, the momentum must be\nbounded from above. This is a major difference from a molecule, for which the\nquasiprobability flow is confined in position space for small internuclear\nseparation. Furthermore, we assess the stability of different propagation\nstrategies and find that the most stable scenario for the full dynamics is\nobtained if the system is initially prepared in the KH ground state.",

    "abstract": "Nested answer set programming (NASP; Lifschitz et al., 1999) generalizes\nanswer set programming (ASP) by admitting nested expressions in rule bodies and\nheads, and thus, NASP aims at exploiting program succinctness. Yet, although\nNASP expressiveness is undoubtedly superior to ASP one, the former's reasoning\ncapabilities remain unexplored. This reality seems subsequent to the next\nexisting wide-ranging gap: normal nested programs (NNPs) are not known, or in\nother words, the nested normal-disjunctive boundary is unidentified thus far.\nSuch an unfavorable situation is yet antagonistic to that of ASP as its normal\nprograms (NPs) have been vital for propelling ASP. We will fill such a gap by\ndefining the NNPs, their semantics and their associated nested logical calculi.\nBesides, while the unique known way to compute nested programs is unfold them\nback, we propose to do so in their original form.\n  Firstly, we give the syntax of NNPs. For that, we initially define the\npositive-Horn nested-expressions and then an NNP rule as one whose head (resp.\nbody) is a positive-Horn (resp. general) nested-expression. Secondly, we set up\nthe semantics of NNPs by lifting to the nesting level, classical NP notions\nincluding: answer set, minimal and least model, closedness, supported-ness,\nimmediate consequence operator and program consistency. We besides show that\nNNP restricted to ASP coincides with NP. Thirdly, we introduce nested logical\ncalculi, concretely, nested unit-resolution and nested hyper unit-resolution,\nproving that they recover unit-resolution and hyper unit-resolution in the ASP\nsetting. We also show how both nested logical calculi allow to process the\nleast model of not-free NNP programs. To end, we demonstrate that computing\nanswer sets of (resp. not-free) NNP programs is (resp. P-complete) NP-complete.",

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the problem of trajectory planning for autonomous\nvehicles at unsignalized intersections, specifically focusing on scenarios\nwhere the vehicle lacks the right of way and yet must cross safely. To address\nthis issue, we have employed a method based on the Partially Observable Markov\nDecision Processes (POMDPs) framework designed for planning under uncertainty.\nThe method utilizes the Adaptive Belief Tree (ABT) algorithm as an approximate\nsolver for the POMDPs. We outline the POMDP formulation, beginning with\ndiscretizing the intersection's topology. Additionally, we present a dynamics\nmodel for the prediction of the evolving states of vehicles, such as their\nposition and velocity. Using an observation model, we also describe the\nconnection of those states with the imperfect (noisy) available measurements.\nOur results confirmed that the method is able to plan collision-free\ntrajectories in a series of simulations utilizing real-world traffic data from\naerial footage of two distinct intersections.

Recently,\nthe interplay between imaging, radial velocities and astrometry has produced\nsignificant advancements in exoplanetary science. We report a first result of\nan ongoing survey performed with SHARK-NIR, the new high-contrast near-infrared\nimaging camera at the Large Binocular Telescope, in parallel with LBTI/LMIRCam\nin order to detect planetary companions around stars with significant proper\nmotion anomaly. In this work we focus on HD 57625, a F8 star for which we\ndetermine a $4.8^{+3.7}_{-2.9}$Ga age, exhibiting significant astrometric\nacceleration and for which archival radial velocities hint at the presence of a\npreviously undetected massive long-period companion. We analyse the imaging\ndata we collected with SHARK-NIR and LMIRCam in synergy with the available\npublic SOPHIE radial velocity time series and Hipparcos-Gaia proper motion\nanomaly. With this joint multi-technique analysis, we aim at characterizing the\ncompanion responsible for the astrometric and radial velocity signals. The\nimaging observations result in a non-detection, indicating the companion to be\nin the substellar regime.

    "abstract": "In this paper we identify the source of a singularity in the training loss of\nkey denoising models, that causes the denoiser's predictions to collapse\ntowards the mean of the source or target distributions. This degeneracy creates\nfalse basins of attraction, distorting the denoising trajectories and\nultimately increasing the number of steps required to sample these models.\n  We circumvent this artifact by leveraging the deterministic ODE-based\nsamplers, offered by certain denoising diffusion and score-matching models,\nwhich establish a well-defined change-of-variables between the source and\ntarget distributions. Given this correspondence, we propose a new probability\nflow model, the Lines Matching Model (LMM), which matches globally straight\nlines interpolating the two distributions. We demonstrate that the flow fields\nproduced by the LMM exhibit notable temporal consistency, resulting in\ntrajectories with excellent straightness scores.\n  Beyond its sampling efficiency, the LMM formulation allows us to enhance the\nfidelity of the generated samples by integrating domain-specific reconstruction\nand adversarial losses, and by optimizing its training for the sampling\nprocedure used. Overall, the LMM achieves state-of-the-art FID scores with\nminimal NFEs on established benchmark datasets: 1.57/1.39 (NFE=1/2) on\nCIFAR-10, 1.47/1.17 on ImageNet 64x64, and 2.68/1.54 on AFHQ 64x64.\n  Finally, we provide a theoretical analysis showing that the use of optimal\ntransport to relate the two distributions suffers from a curse of\ndimensionality, where the pairing set size (mini-batch) must scale\nexponentially with the signal dimension.",

To conserve\ncommunication resources, MDETM reduces the frequency of data transmission. For\nmitigating design conservatism, a MOF controller is employed.

Firstly, the influence of chiral imbalance on the chiral\nphase transition in the $T_{pc}-\\omega$ plane is investigated. Research\nmanifests that as $\\mu_{5}$ increases, the critical point (CEP) of the\n$T_{pc}-\\omega$ plane chiral phase transition will move closer to the $T$ axis.\nThis means that the chiral chemical potential $\\mu_{5}$ can significantly\naffect the $T_{pc}-\\omega$ phase diagram and phase transition behavior. While\ndiscussing the $T_{pc}-\\omega$ phase diagram, we also study the spin alignment\nof the $\\rho$ vector meson under rotation. In the study of the spin alignment\nof the vector meson $\\rho$, $\\rho_{00}$ is the $00$ element of the spin density\nmatrix of vector mesons. At high temperatures, $\\rho_{00}$ is close to $1/3$,\nit indicates that the spin alignment of the vector meson $\\rho$ is isotropic.\nIt is found that increasing the chiral chemical potential $\\mu_{5}$\nsignificantly enhances $\\rho_{00}$, and makes $\\rho_{00}$ approaching to $1/3$\naround the phase transition temperature. When rotational angular velocity is\nzero, $\\rho_{00}$ is close to $1/3$, but as $\\omega$ increases, $\\rho_{00}$\nsignificantly decreases, and deviates $1/3$, indicating that rotation can\nsignificantly cause polarization characteristics. The $\\rho_{00}-r$\nrelationship near the phase transition temperature is studied. It is found that\nthe farther away from the center of rotation, the lower the degree of spin\npolarization of the system. It is also found that the influence of chiral\nimbalance on the $\\rho_{00}-r$ relationship is also significant.",

Originally intended for web\napplications, Wasm is also considered a serious alternative for server-side\nruntimes and embedded systems due to its performance and security benefits.\nDespite its security guarantees and sandboxing capabilities, Wasm code is still\nvulnerable to buffer overflows and memory leaks, which can lead to exploits on\nproduction software. To help prevent those, different techniques can be used,\nincluding symbolic execution.\n  Owi is built around a modular, monadic interpreter capable of both normal and\nsymbolic execution of Wasm programs. Monads have been identified as a way to\nwrite modular interpreters since 1995 and this strategy has allowed us to build\na robust and performant symbolic execution tool which our evaluation shows to\nbe the best currently available for Wasm. Moreover, because WebAssembly is a\ncompilation target for multiple languages (such as Rust and C), Owi can be used\nto find bugs in C and Rust code, as well as in codebases mixing the two.

    "abstract": "Low-rank matrix factorizations are a class of linear models widely used in\nvarious fields such as machine learning, signal processing, and data analysis.\nThese models approximate a matrix as the product of two smaller matrices, where\nthe left matrix captures latent features while the right matrix linearly\ndecomposes the data based on these features. There are many ways to define what\nmakes a component \"important.\" Standard LRMFs, such as the truncated singular\nvalue decomposition, focus on minimizing the distance between the original\nmatrix and its low-rank approximation. In this thesis, the notion of\n\"importance\" is closely linked to interpretability and uniqueness, which are\nkey to obtaining reliable and meaningful results.\n  This thesis thus focuses on volume-based constraints and regularizations\ndesigned to enhance interpretability and uniqueness. We first introduce two new\nvolume-constrained LRMFs designed to enhance these properties. The first\nassumes that data points are naturally bounded (e.g., movie ratings between 1\nand 5 stars) and can be explained by convex combinations of features within the\nsame bounds, allowing them to be interpreted in the same way as the data. The\nsecond model is more general, constraining the factors to belong to convex\npolytopes. Then, two variants of volume-regularized LRMFs are proposed. The\nfirst minimizes the volume of the latent features, encouraging them to cluster\nclosely together, while the second maximizes the volume of the decompositions,\npromoting sparse representations. Across all these models, uniqueness is\nachieved under the core principle that the factors must be \"sufficiently\nscattered\" within their respective feasible sets.\n  Motivated by applications such as blind source separation and missing data\nimputation, this thesis also proposes efficient algorithms that make these\nmodels practical for real-world applications.",

This misidentification risks\nthe accuracy of species ascription and evolutionary interpretations derived\nfrom fossil analyses.

Its most basic ingredient is a\ncollision between two cold shells of different Lorentz factors in an\nultra-relativistic outflow, which forms a pair of shock fronts that accelerate\nelectrons in their wake. In this model, key features of GRB prompt emission\nsuch as the doubly-broken power-law spectral shape arise naturally from the\noptically-thin synchrotron emission at both shock fronts. We investigate the\ninternal shocks model as a mechanism for prompt emission based on a full\nhydrodynamical analytic derivation in planar geometry, extending this approach\nto spherical geometry using hydrodynamic simulations. We used the moving mesh\nrelativistic hydrodynamics code \\texttt{GAMMA} to study the collision of two\nultra-relativistic cold shells of equal kinetic energy (and power). Using the\nbuilt-in shock detection, we calculate the corresponding synchrotron emission\nby the relativistic electrons accelerated into a power-law energy distribution\nbehind the shock, in the fast cooling regime.}During the first dynamical time\nafter the collision, the spherical effects cause the shock strength to decrease\nwith radius. The observed peak frequency decreases faster than expected by\nother models in the rising part of the pulse, and the peak flux saturates even\nfor moderately short pulses. This is likely caused by the very sharp edges of\nthe shells in our model, while smoother edges will probably mitigate this\neffect.

    "abstract": "Recently, there has been a growing interest in time series foundation models\nthat generalize across different downstream tasks. A key to strong foundation\nmodels is a diverse pre-training dataset, which is particularly challenging to\ncollect for time series classification. In this work, we explore the\nperformance of a contrastive-learning-based foundation model as a function of\nthe data used for pre-training. We introduce contrastive accuracy, a new\nmeasure to evaluate the quality of the representation space learned by the\nfoundation model. Our experiments reveal the positive correlation between the\nproposed measure and the accuracy of the model on a collection of downstream\ntasks. This suggests that the contrastive accuracy can serve as a criterion to\nsearch for time series datasets that can enhance the pre-training and improve\nthereby the foundation model's generalization.",

This study employs molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, including\nboth classical and ab-initio approaches, to investigate the melting behavior of\nCaO. We calculate the melting temperature of \\ce{CaO} by the void-nucleated\nmelting and two-phase coexistence techniques, aiming to resolve discrepancies\nin experimental data on the melting point, which range from 2843~K to 3223~K in\ndifferent studies due to the high reactivity and vapor pressure of the\nsubstance. The obtained results are $T_f = 3066\\pm12$~K and $T_f = 2940\\pm65$~K\nusing the void-nucleated melting and the two-phase coexistence method,\nrespectively. Additionally, we calculate the enthalpy of fusion and the\nhigh-pressure melting curve, for the first time without making any assumption\non the Clapeyron slope. This is extremely important since in experiments the\nClaperyon slope of the melting curve is estimated from low pressure\nmeasurements and the overheating ratio (i.e. $\\eta=\\frac{T_s}{T_f}-1$, where\n$T_s$ represents the thermal instability limit corresponding to the homogeneous\nmelting temperature of the solid) is often assumed to be constant in\nsimulations. Our MD results show that $T_s$ increases more rapidly with\npressure than $T_f$ and thus that the overheating ratio sensibly depends upon\npressure. These findings contribute to the accurate modeling of the CaO phase\ndiagram, which is essential for geochemistry, cosmochemistry, and materials\nscience.",

The\nresults indicate that (1) the carbon intensity of residential space cooling in\nIndia increased by 292.4% from 2000 to 2022, reaching 513.8 kilograms of carbon\ndioxide per household. The net state domestic product per capita, representing\nincome, emerged as the primary positive contributor. (2) The increase in carbon\nemissions from space cooling can be primarily attributed to the use of fans.\nWhile fan-based space cooling has nearly saturated Indian urban households, it\nis anticipated to persist as the primary cooling method in rural households for\ndecades. (3) States with higher decarbonization potential are concentrated in\ntwo categories: those with high household income and substantial cooling\nappliance ownership and those with pronounced unmet cooling demand but low\nhousehold income and hot climates. Furthermore, it is believed that promoting\nenergy-efficient building designs can be prioritized to achieve affordable\nspace cooling.

However,\nAschenbach discovered that for a hypothetical non-rotating observer, contrary\nto usual behavior, the angular velocity increases with radius in certain\nregions. Although the possibility of observing rare and less probable\nrotational behaviors in a rotating structure is not unlikely or impossible.\nHowever, observing such behaviors in a static structure is not only intriguing\nbut also thought-provoking, as it raises questions about the factors that might\nplay a role in such phenomena.

The point neuron models, a cornerstone of deep SNNs,\npose a bottleneck on the network-level expressivity since they depict somatic\ndynamics only. In contrast, the multi-compartment models in neuroscience offer\nremarkable expressivity by introducing dendritic morphology and dynamics, but\nremain underexplored in deep learning due to their unaffordable computational\ncost and inflexibility. To combine the advantages of both sides for a flexible,\nefficient yet more powerful model, we propose the dendritic spiking neuron\n(DendSN) incorporating multiple dendritic branches with nonlinear dynamics.\nCompared to the point spiking neurons, DendSN exhibits significantly higher\nexpressivity. DendSN's flexibility enables its seamless integration into\ndiverse deep SNN architectures. To accelerate dendritic SNNs (DendSNNs), we\nparallelize dendritic state updates across time steps, and develop Triton\nkernels for GPU-level acceleration. As a result, we can construct large-scale\nDendSNNs with depth comparable to their point SNN counterparts. Next, we\ncomprehensively evaluate DendSNNs' performance on various demanding tasks. By\nmodulating dendritic branch strengths using a context signal, catastrophic\nforgetting of DendSNNs is substantially mitigated. Moreover, DendSNNs\ndemonstrate enhanced robustness against noise and adversarial attacks compared\nto point SNNs, and excel in few-shot learning settings. Our work firstly\ndemonstrates the possibility of training bio-plausible dendritic SNNs with\ndepths and scales comparable to traditional point SNNs, and reveals superior\nexpressivity and robustness of reduced dendritic neuron models in deep\nlearning, thereby offering a fresh perspective on advancing neural network\ndesign.",

    "abstract": "This paper investigates an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system\nwhere the sensing target is a three-dimensional (3D) extended target, for which\nmultiple scatterers from the target surface can be resolved. We first introduce\na second-order truncated Fourier series surface model for an arbitrarily-shaped\n3D ET. Utilizing this model, we derive tractable Cramer-Rao bounds (CRBs) for\nestimating the ET kinematic parameters, including the center range, azimuth,\nelevation, and orientation. These CRBs depend explicitly on the transmit\ncovariance matrix and ET shape. Then we formulate two transmit beamforming\noptimization problems for the base station (BS) to simultaneously support\ncommunication with multiple users and sensing of the 3D ET. The first minimizes\nthe sensing CRB while ensuring a minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise\nratio (SINR) for each user, and it is solved using semidefinite relaxation. The\nsecond balances minimizing the CRB and maximizing communication rates through a\nweight factor, and is solved via successive convex approximation. To reduce the\ncomputational complexity, we further propose ISACBeam-GNN, a novel graph neural\nnetwork-based beamforming method that employs a separate-then-integrate\nstructure, learning communication and sensing (C&S) objectives independently\nbefore integrating them to balance C&S trade-offs. Simulation results show that\nthe proposed beamforming designs that account for ET shapes significantly\noutperform existing baselines, offering better communication-sensing\nperformance trade-offs as well as an improved beampattern for sensing. Results\nalso demonstrate that ISACBeam-GNN is an efficient alternative to the\noptimization-based methods, with remarkable adaptability and scalability.",

    "abstract": "Images captured in harsh environments often exhibit blurred details, reduced\ncontrast, and color distortion, which hinder feature detection and matching,\nthereby affecting the accuracy and robustness of homography estimation. While\nvisual enhancement can improve contrast and clarity, it may introduce\nvisual-tolerant artifacts that obscure the structural integrity of images.\nConsidering the resilience of semantic information against environmental\ninterference, we propose a semantic-driven feature enhancement network for\nrobust homography estimation, dubbed SeFENet. Concretely, we first introduce an\ninnovative hierarchical scale-aware module to expand the receptive field by\naggregating multi-scale information, thereby effectively extracting image\nfeatures under diverse harsh conditions. Subsequently, we propose a\nsemantic-guided constraint module combined with a high-level perceptual\nframework to achieve degradation-tolerant with semantic feature. A\nmeta-learning-based training strategy is introduced to mitigate the disparity\nbetween semantic and structural features. By internal-external alternating\noptimization, the proposed network achieves implicit semantic-wise feature\nenhancement, thereby improving the robustness of homography estimation in\nadverse environments by strengthening the local feature comprehension and\ncontext information extraction. Experimental results under both normal and\nharsh conditions demonstrate that SeFENet significantly outperforms SOTA\nmethods, reducing point match error by at least 41% on the large-scale\ndatasets.",

By\ncontrast, composite objects stabilized by means of repulsive forces were long\nthought to be theoretical constructions owing to their fragility in naturally\noccurring systems. Surprisingly, the formation of bound atom pairs by strong\nrepulsive interactions has been demonstrated experimentally in optical\nlattices. Despite this success, repulsively bound particle pairs were believed\nto have no analogue in condensed matter owing to strong decay channels. Here we\npresent spectroscopic signatures of repulsively bound three-magnon states and\nbound magnon pairs in the Ising-like chain antiferromagnet BaCo$_2$V$_2$O$_8$.\nIn large transverse fields, below the quantum critical point, we identify\nrepulsively bound magnon states by comparing terahertz spectroscopy\nmeasurements to theoretical results for the Heisenberg-Ising chain\nantiferromagnet, a paradigmatic quantum many-body model. Our experimental\nresults show that these high-energy repulsively bound magnon states are well\nseparated from continua, exhibit significant dynamical responses and, despite\ndissipation, are sufficiently long-lived to be identified.

For quark-line\nconnected diagrams at large separations, most of this additional variance can\nbe efficiently suppressed by the introduction of hierarchical subspaces, thanks\nto the reduced size of the coarse grid operators that act within the subspaces.\nIn this work, we investigate the contributions to the variance of the isovector\nvector current correlator with $N_{\\mathrm f}=2$ non-perturbatively $\\mathrm\nO(a)$-improved Wilson fermions on lattices approximately of size $L=2,3$ and\n$4$ $\\mathrm {fm}$.

Currently, there is no\nsystematic approach to determining this error boundary or understanding its\nspecific impact on model performance. We propose a general\n\\textbf{L}oss\\textbf{L}ess \\textbf{C}ompression theoretical framework\n(\\textbf{LLC}), which further delineates the compression neighborhood and\nhigher-order analysis boundaries through the total differential, thereby\nspecifying the error range within which a model can be compressed without loss.\nTo verify the effectiveness of LLC, we apply various compression techniques,\nincluding quantization and decomposition. Specifically, for quantization, we\nreformulate the classic quantization search problem as a grouped knapsack\nproblem within the lossless neighborhood, achieving lossless quantization while\nimproving computational efficiency. For decomposition, LLC addresses the\napproximation problem under low-rank constraints, automatically determining the\nrank for each layer and producing lossless low-rank models.

For control of latent\ndynamic systems, methods based on reinforcement learning suffer from sample\ninefficiency and generalization problems. In this work, we propose an\nasymptotic tracking controller for latent dynamic systems. The latent variables\nare related to the high-dimensional observations through an unknown nonlinear\nfunction. The dynamics are unknown but assumed to be affine nonlinear. To\nrealize asymptotic tracking, an identifiable latent dynamic model is learned to\nrecover the latents and estimate the dynamics.

Based on the learned model, we\nuse a manually designed feedback linearization controller to ensure the\nasymptotic tracking property of the closed-loop system. After considering fully\ncontrollable systems, the results are extended to the case that uncontrollable\nenvironmental latents exist.

    "abstract": "Next generation tritium decay experiments to determine the absolute neutrino\nmass require high-precision measurements of $\\beta$-decay electron energies\nclose to the kinematic end point. To achieve this, the development of high\nphase-space density sources of atomic tritium is required, along with the\nimplementation of methods to control the motion of these atoms to allow\nextended observation times. A promising approach to efficiently and accurately\nmeasure the kinetic energies of individual $\\beta$-decay electrons generated in\nthese dilute atomic gases, is to determine the frequency of the cyclotron\nradiation they emit in a precisely characterised magnetic field. This cyclotron\nradiation emission spectroscopy (CRES) technique can benefit from recent\ndevelopments in quantum technologies. Absolute static-field magnetometry and\nelectrometry, which is essential for the precise determination of the electron\nkinetic energies from the frequency of their emitted cyclotron radiation, can\nbe performed using atoms in superpositions of circular Rydberg states.\nQuantum-limited microwave amplifiers will allow precise cyclotron frequency\nmeasurements to be made with maximal signal-to-noise ratios and minimal\nobservation times. Exploiting the opportunities offered by quantum technologies\nin these key areas, represents the core activity of the Quantum Technologies\nfor Neutrino Mass (QTNM) project. Its goal is to develop a new experimental\napparatus that can enable a determination of the absolute neutrino mass with a\nsensitivity on the order of 10~meV/$c^2$.",

We address this issue by introducing a novel joint\noptimization strategy for lossless low-rank weight factorization, which, for\nthe first time, enhances the model's performance beyond the original. Our\napproach begins with a theoretical analysis of the relationship between\nlow-rank factorization and model optimization objectives, establishing a\nprecise perturbation range for matrix factorization errors on model\nperformance. This challenge is then reformulated as a numerical rank deficiency\nproblem with inequality constraints and develop a joint objective that\nsimultaneously addresses factorization error and model performance. Based on\nthe above analysis, we propose two optimization algorithms: \\textbf{a lossless\noptimization algorithm} that maximizes model accuracy while ensuring\ncompression, and \\textbf{a compact optimization algorithm} that minimizes model\nsize while preserving performance. These algorithms do not require fine-tuning\nand can directly compress numerous deep models to achieve lossless results.

In this work, we\nintroduce LMS-AutoTSF, a novel time series forecasting architecture that\nincorporates autocorrelation while leveraging dual encoders operating at\nmultiple scales. Unlike models that rely on predefined trend and seasonal\ncomponents, LMS-AutoTSF employs two separate encoders per scale: one focusing\non low-pass filtering to capture trends and the other utilizing high-pass\nfiltering to model seasonal variations. These filters are learnable, allowing\nthe model to dynamically adapt and isolate trend and seasonal components\ndirectly in the frequency domain.

These rankings, in turn, allow the system to extract relevant\nimage features, fuse them into a unified feature vector, and use a generative\nmodel to produce an initial reconstruction of the mental image. The second\nstage leverages an existing face editing method, allowing users to manually\nrefine and further improve this reconstruction using an easy-to-use slider\ninterface for face shape manipulation. To avoid the need for tedious human data\ncollection for training the reconstruction system, we introduce a computational\nuser model of human ranking behaviour.

Oracle\ncomplexities are measured by the number of function and gradient evaluations.\nTo achieve this, we enable first-order methods to utilize computational oracles\nfor solving diagonal quadratic programs in subproblems. For problems where the\noptimal value $f^*$ is known, such as those in overparameterized models and\nfeasibility problems, we propose an accelerated first-order method that\nincorporates a modified Polyak step size and Nesterov's momentum. Notably, our\nmethod does not require knowledge of smoothness levels, H\\\"{o}lder continuity\nparameter of the gradient, or additional line search, yet achieves the optimal\noracle complexity bound of $\\mathcal{O}(\\varepsilon^{-2/(1+3\\rho)})$ under\nH\\\"{o}lder smoothness conditions. When $f^*$ is unknown, we reformulate the\nproblem as finding the root of the optimal value function and develop inexact\nfixed-point iteration and secant method to compute $f^*$. These root-finding\nsubproblems are solved inexactly using first-order methods to a specified\nrelative accuracy. We employ the accelerated prox-level (APL) method, which is\nproven to be uniformly optimal for convex optimization with simple constraints.\nOur analysis demonstrates that APL-based level-set methods also achieve the\noptimal oracle complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(\\varepsilon^{-2/(1+3\\rho)})$ for\nconvex function-constrained optimization, without requiring knowledge of any\nproblem-specific structures.

    "abstract": "Planning is a fundamental activity, arising frequently in many contexts, from\ndaily tasks to industrial processes. The planning task consists of selecting a\nsequence of actions to achieve a specified goal from specified initial\nconditions. The Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) is the leading\nlanguage used in the field of automated planning to model planning problems.\nPrevious work has highlighted the limitations of PDDL, particularly in terms of\nits expressivity. Our interest lies in facilitating the handling of complex\nproblems and enhancing the overall capability of automated planning systems.\nUnified-Planning is a Python library offering high-level API to specify\nplanning problems and to invoke automated planners. In this paper, we present\nan extension of the UP library aimed at enhancing its expressivity for\nhigh-level problem modelling. In particular, we have added an array type, an\nexpression to count booleans, and the allowance for integer parameters in\nactions. We show how these facilities enable natural high-level models of three\nclassical planning problems.",

    "abstract": "We propose a new class of metrics, called the survival independence\ndivergence (SID), to test dependence between a right-censored outcome and\ncovariates. A key technique for deriving the SIDs is to use a counting process\nstrategy, which equivalently transforms the intractable independence test due\nto the presence of censoring into a test problem for complete observations. The\nSIDs are equal to zero if and only if the right-censored response and\ncovariates are independent, and they are capable of detecting various types of\nnonlinear dependence. We propose empirical estimates of the SIDs and establish\ntheir asymptotic properties. We further develop a wild bootstrap method to\nestimate the critical values and show the consistency of the bootstrap tests.\nThe numerical studies demonstrate that our SID-based tests are highly\ncompetitive with existing methods in a wide range of settings.",

In this work we propose a mixed variational method\nthat gives a semi-discrete problem with the same geometric structure as the\ninfinite-dimensional problem.

Simultaneous lightwave information and power transfer\n(SLIPT) technology offers the potential to realize wireless charging and signal\ntransfer, making it suitable for supporting autonomous vehicles and drones.

However, the existing\nresonant beam SLIPT system exhibits a limited field of view (FoV) and\ntransmission efficiency, facing challenges in practical applications. In this\npaper, we propose a resonant beam SLIPT system enhanced by incorporating an\ninternal telescope and optimizing the communication, energy transfer, and FoV\nperformance by solving the Pareto front set of the system's achievable\nperformance region.

    "abstract": "Real-world recommendation systems commonly offer diverse content scenarios\nfor users to interact with. Considering the enormous number of users in\nindustrial platforms, it is infeasible to utilize a single unified\nrecommendation model to meet the requirements of all scenarios. Usually,\nseparate recommendation pipelines are established for each distinct scenario.\nThis practice leads to challenges in comprehensively grasping users' interests.\nRecent research endeavors have been made to tackle this problem by pre-training\nmodels to encapsulate the overall interests of users. Traditional pre-trained\nrecommendation models mainly capture user interests by leveraging collaborative\nsignals. Nevertheless, a prevalent drawback of these systems is their\nincapacity to handle long-tail items and cold-start scenarios. With the recent\nadvent of large language models, there has been a significant increase in\nresearch efforts focused on exploiting LLMs to extract semantic information for\nusers and items. However, text-based recommendations highly rely on elaborate\nfeature engineering and frequently fail to capture collaborative similarities.\nTo overcome these limitations, we propose a novel pre-training framework for\nsequential recommendation, termed PRECISE. This framework combines\ncollaborative signals with semantic information. Moreover, PRECISE employs a\nlearning framework that initially models users' comprehensive interests across\nall recommendation scenarios and subsequently concentrates on the specific\ninterests of target-scene behaviors. We demonstrate that PRECISE precisely\ncaptures the entire range of user interests and effectively transfers them to\nthe target interests. Empirical findings reveal that the PRECISE framework\nattains outstanding performance on both public and industrial datasets.",

Although\nthe continuous dynamics are typically observable, the hidden nature of the\nMarkov chain introduces significant complexity, rendering standard\nlikelihood-based methods less effective. To address these challenges, we\npropose an estimation algorithm designed for discrete, high-frequency\nobservations, even when the Markov chain is not directly observed. Our approach\nintegrates the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm, which iteratively\nrefines parameter estimates in the presence of latent variables, with a\nquasi-likelihood method adapted to NIG noise.

In this paper, we\npropose SaRO-GS as a novel dynamic scene representation capable of achieving\nreal-time rendering while effectively handling temporal complexities in dynamic\nscenes. To address the issue of slow rendering speed, we adopt a Gaussian\nprimitive-based representation and optimize the Gaussians in 4D space, which\nfacilitates real-time rendering with the assistance of 3D Gaussian Splatting.\nAdditionally, to handle temporally complex dynamic scenes, we introduce a\nScale-aware Residual Field. This field considers the size information of each\nGaussian primitive while encoding its residual feature and aligns with the\nself-splitting behavior of Gaussian primitives. Furthermore, we propose an\nAdaptive Optimization Schedule, which assigns different optimization strategies\nto Gaussian primitives based on their distinct temporal properties, thereby\nexpediting the reconstruction of dynamic regions.

In this paper, we propose\nVidMusician, a parameter-efficient video-to-music generation framework built\nupon text-to-music models.

A typical example of such non-Gaussian phenomena calls for L\\'evy noise,\nwhich accommodates jumps and extreme variations. We propose the Random Batch\nMethod for interacting particle systems driven by L\\'evy noises (RBM-L\\'evy),\nwhich can be viewed as an extension of the original RBM algorithm in [Jin et\nal.

Then one reshuffles the particles and\ncontinues to repeat this shuffle-and-interact process. In other words, by\nreplacing the strong interacting force by the weak interacting force,\nRBM-L\\'evy dramatically reduces the computational cost from $O(N^2)$ to $O(pN)$\nper time step. Meanwhile, the resulting dynamics converges to the original\ninteracting particle system, even at the appearance of the L\\'evy jump.

We consider an anisotropic energy momentum tensor (EMT) as the\nsupporting source for wormhole structure and further assume that there exists a\nlinear relation between radial and tangential pressures and energy density. We\ntherefore obtain two classes of solutions to the field equations of GRG,\nincluding the solutions with zero and nonzero redshift functions.

The conditions on\nphysical reasonability of the wormhole solutions put restrictions on model\nparameters.

Further, the public health costs unevenly impact economically\ndisadvantaged communities, where the per-household health burden could be 200x\nmore than that in less-impacted communities. We recommend adopting a standard\nreporting protocol for criteria air pollutants and the public health costs of\nAI, paying attention to all impacted communities, and implementing\nhealth-informed AI to mitigate adverse effects while promoting public health\nequity.",

    "abstract": "Previous OOD detection systems only focus on the semantic gap between ID and\nOOD samples. Besides the semantic gap, we are faced with two additional gaps:\nthe domain gap between source and target domains, and the class-imbalance gap\nbetween different classes. In fact, similar objects from different domains\nshould belong to the same class. In this paper, we introduce a realistic yet\nchallenging setting: class-imbalanced cross-domain OOD detection (CCOD), which\ncontains a well-labeled (but usually small) source set for training and\nconducts OOD detection on an unlabeled (but usually larger) target set for\ntesting. We do not assume that the target domain contains only OOD classes or\nthat it is class-balanced: the distribution among classes of the target dataset\nneed not be the same as the source dataset. To tackle this challenging setting\nwith an OOD detection system, we propose a novel uncertainty-aware adaptive\nsemantic alignment (UASA) network based on a prototype-based alignment\nstrategy. Specifically, we first build label-driven prototypes in the source\ndomain and utilize these prototypes for target classification to close the\ndomain gap. Rather than utilizing fixed thresholds for OOD detection, we\ngenerate adaptive sample-wise thresholds to handle the semantic gap. Finally,\nwe conduct uncertainty-aware clustering to group semantically similar target\nsamples to relieve the class-imbalance gap. Extensive experiments on three\nchallenging benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed UASA outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods by a large margin.",

Since this approach treats the droplet as a rigid particle, it fails\nto capture the fluid dynamics of the droplet and is also unsuitable for\nstudying interfacial phenomena such as droplet deformation, splitting, or\ncoalescence. In this work, we employ our recently developed acoustic body force\nin Eulerian form, which models the droplet as a fluid, to theoretically\ninvestigate the suspension dynamics of droplet subjected to standing waves\nthrough the interaction between acoustic, interfacial, and gravitational\nforces. Our theory predicts that when interfacial forces are dominant, the\npresence of positive and negative acoustic force regions within droplets\nexceeding the Rayleigh limit reduces the net acoustic force counteracting\ngravity. As a result, the suspension dynamics become highly dependent on\ndroplet size, in contrast to droplets within the Rayleigh limit, where the\ndynamics remain size-independent. Thus, beyond the Rayleigh limit, as the\ndroplet size to wavelength ratio increases, the critical acoustic energy\ndensity ($E_{cr}$) required to suspend the droplet initially rises sharply,\nwhich agrees with recent experimental results. After $E_{cr}$ reaches a local\nmaximum at $d/\\lambda \\approx 0.65$, it exhibits a pattern of alternating\ndecreases and increases, with each successive peak surpassing the previous one.\nRemarkably, our study reveals a size-dependent shifting of the suspension\nposition between nodes and antinodes for droplets beyond the Rayleigh limit,\nwhereas droplets within this limit maintain a consistent suspension position\nregardless of size.",

    "abstract": "Live programming features can be found in a range of programming\nenvironments, from individual prototypes to widely used environments. While\nliveness is generally considered a useful property, there is little empirical\nevidence on when and how liveness can be beneficial. Even though there are few\nexperimental studies, their results are largely inconclusive.\n  We reviewed existing experiments and related studies to gather a collection\nof potential effects of liveness and moderating factors. Based on this\ncollection, we concluded that **task complexity** and **prior experience\naddressing liveness** are potentially essential factors neglected in previous\nexperiments. To fill this gap, we devised and conducted a controlled experiment\n(N = 37) testing the hypothesis that task complexity moderates the effects of\nlive introspection tools on participants? debugging efficiency, given\nparticipants with prior experience with liveness.\n  Our results do not support the hypothesis that task complexity moderates the\neffect of live introspection tools. This non-significant moderation effect\nmight result from the low number of participants, as the data suggests a\nmoderation effect. The results also show that in our experiment setting, live\nintrospection tools significantly reduced the time participants took to debug\nthe tasks.\n  For researchers interested in the effects of liveness, our findings suggest\nthat studies on liveness should make conscious choices about task complexity\nand participants' prior experience with liveness. For designers of programming\nenvironments, the results of our experiment are a step toward understanding\nwhen and how programming tools should be live to become more helpful to\nprogrammers.",

We introduce the AusLaw\nCitation Benchmark, a real-world dataset comprising 55k Australian legal\ninstances and 18,677 unique citations which to the best of our knowledge is the\nfirst of its scale and scope. We then conduct a systematic benchmarking across\na range of solutions: (i) standard prompting of both general and\nlaw-specialised LLMs, (ii) retrieval-only pipelines with both generic and\ndomain-specific embeddings, (iii) supervised fine-tuning, and (iv) several\nhybrid strategies that combine LLMs with retrieval augmentation through query\nexpansion, voting ensembles, or re-ranking. Results show that neither general\nnor law-specific LLMs suffice as stand-alone solutions, with performance near\nzero.

While some previous methods have explored\ndirectly pruning or merging tokens in the inference stage to accelerate models,\nour method excels in both performance and throughput by two key designs. First,\nwhile most previous methods only try to save the computations of Large Language\nModels (LLMs), our method accelerates the forward pass of both image encoders\nand LLMs in LVLMs, which both occupy a significant part of time during\ninference.

Previous studies have\ndemonstrated the efficacy of fine-tuning pre-trained language models (PLMs) for\nAD detection. However, the objective of this traditional fine-tuning method,\nwhich involves inputting only transcripts, is inconsistent with the masked\nlanguage modeling (MLM) task used during the pre-training phase of PLMs. In\nthis paper, we investigate prompt-based fine-tuning of PLMs, converting the\nclassification task into a MLM task by inserting prompt templates into the\ntranscript inputs. We also explore the impact of incorporating pause\ninformation from forced alignment into manual transcripts. Additionally, we\ncompare the performance of various automatic speech recognition (ASR) models\nand select the Whisper model to generate ASR-based transcripts for comparison\nwith manual transcripts. Furthermore, majority voting and ensemble techniques\nare applied across different PLMs (BERT and RoBERTa) using different random\nseeds. Ultimately, we obtain maximum detection accuracy of 95.8% (with mean\n87.9%, std 3.3%) using manual transcripts, achieving state-of-the-art\nperformance for AD detection using only transcripts on the ADReSS test set.",

These challenges include players'\nunpredictable movements, frequent close interactions, and visual similarities\nthat complicate pose labeling and lead to significant occlusions, frequent ID\nswitches, and high manual annotation costs. To address these challenges, we\npropose a novel pose-based virtual marker (VM) MOT method for team sports,\nnamed Sports-vmTracking. This method builds on the vmTracking approach\ndeveloped for multi-animal tracking with active learning. First, we constructed\na 3x3 basketball pose dataset for VMs and applied active learning to enhance\nmodel performance in generating VMs. Then, we overlaid the VMs on video to\nidentify players, extract their poses with unique IDs, and convert these into\nbounding boxes for comparison with automated MOT methods. Using our 3x3\nbasketball dataset, we demonstrated that our VM configuration has been highly\neffective, and reduced the need for manual corrections and labeling during pose\nmodel training while maintaining high accuracy. Our approach achieved an\naverage HOTA score of 72.3%, over 10 points higher than other state-of-the-art\nmethods without VM, and resulted in 0 ID switches.

Although existing 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS)\nmethods can produce photo-realistic views under narrow baselines, they often\noverfit the training views when dealing with wide-baseline panoramic images due\nto the difficulty in learning precise geometry from sparse 360$^{\\circ}$ views.\nThis paper presents \\textit{Splatter-360}, a novel end-to-end generalizable\n3DGS framework designed to handle wide-baseline panoramic images. Unlike\nprevious approaches, \\textit{Splatter-360} performs multi-view matching\ndirectly in the spherical domain by constructing a spherical cost volume\nthrough a spherical sweep algorithm, enhancing the network's depth perception\nand geometry estimation. Additionally, we introduce a 3D-aware bi-projection\nencoder to mitigate the distortions inherent in panoramic images and integrate\ncross-view attention to improve feature interactions across multiple\nviewpoints.

    "abstract": "Channel state information (CSI) is a fundamental component in both wireless\ncommunication and sensing systems, enabling critical functions such as radio\nresource optimization and environmental perception. In wireless sensing, data\nscarcity and packet loss hinder efficient model training, while in wireless\ncommunication, high-dimensional CSI matrices and short coherent times caused by\nhigh mobility present challenges in CSI estimation.To address these issues, we\npropose a unified framework named CSI-BERT2 for CSI prediction and\nclassification tasks. Building on CSI-BERT, we introduce a two-stage training\nmethod that first uses a mask language model (MLM) to enable the model to learn\ngeneral feature extraction from scarce datasets in an unsupervised manner,\nfollowed by fine-tuning for specific downstream tasks. Specifically, we extend\nMLM into a mask prediction model (MPM), which efficiently addresses the CSI\nprediction task. We also introduce an adaptive re-weighting layer (ARL) to\nenhance subcarrier representation and a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) based\ntemporal embedding module to mitigate permutation invariance issues in\ntime-series CSI data. This significantly improves the CSI classification\nperformance of the original CSI-BERT model. Extensive experiments on both\nreal-world collected and simulated datasets demonstrate that CSI-BERT2 achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance across all tasks. Our results further show that\nCSI-BERT2 generalizes effectively across varying sampling rates and robustly\nhandles discontinuous CSI sequences caused by packet loss-challenges that\nconventional methods fail to address.",

Moreover,\ndiffusion-based approaches lack sufficient conditioning to fully utilize\nPanchromatic (PAN) images and low-resolution multispectral (LRMS) inputs\neffectively. To address these challenges, we propose an uncertainty-aware\nknowledge distillation diffusion framework with details enhancement for\nPAN-sharpening, called U-Know-DiffPAN. The U-Know-DiffPAN incorporates\nuncertainty-aware knowledge distillation for effective transfer of feature\ndetails from our teacher model to a student one. The teacher model in our\nU-Know-DiffPAN captures frequency details through freqeuncy selective\nattention, facilitating accurate reverse process learning. By conditioning the\nencoder on compact vector representations of PAN and LRMS and the decoder on\nWavelet transforms, we enable rich frequency utilization. So, the high-capacity\nteacher model distills frequency-rich features into a lightweight student model\naided by an uncertainty map. From this, the teacher model can guide the student\nmodel to focus on difficult image regions for PAN-sharpening via the usage of\nthe uncertainty map. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets demonstrate the\nrobustness and superior performance of our U-Know-DiffPAN over very recent\nstate-of-the-art PAN-sharpening methods.",

    "abstract": "Software defined networking (SDN) represents a transformative shift in\nnetwork architecture by decoupling the control plane from the data plane,\nenabling centralized and flexible management of network resources. However,\nthis architectural shift introduces significant security challenges, as SDN's\ncentralized control becomes an attractive target for various types of attacks.\nWhile current research has yielded valuable insights into attack detection in\nSDN, critical gaps remain. Addressing challenges in feature selection,\nbroadening the scope beyond DDoS attacks, strengthening attack decisions based\non multi flow analysis, and building models capable of detecting unseen attacks\nthat they have not been explicitly trained on are essential steps toward\nadvancing security in SDN. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach that\nleverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) and the pre trained BERT base model\nto enhance attack detection in SDN. Our approach transforms network flow data\ninto a format interpretable by language models, allowing BERT to capture\nintricate patterns and relationships within network traffic. By using Random\nForest for feature selection, we optimize model performance and reduce\ncomputational overhead, ensuring accurate detection. Attack decisions are made\nbased on several flows, providing stronger and more reliable detection of\nmalicious traffic. Furthermore, our approach is specifically designed to detect\npreviously unseen attacks, offering a solution for identifying threats that the\nmodel was not explicitly trained on. To rigorously evaluate our approach, we\nconducted experiments in two scenarios: one focused on detecting known attacks,\nachieving 99.96% accuracy, and another on detecting unseen attacks, where our\nmodel achieved 99.96% accuracy, demonstrating the robustness of our approach in\ndetecting evolving threats to improve the security of SDN networks.",

KRAS acts as an on-off switch that promotes cell growth. But\nwhen the KRAS gene is mutated, it will be in one position, allowing the cell\ngrowth uncontrollably. This uncontrollable multiplication of cells causes\ncancer growth. Therefore, KRAS was selected as the target protein in the study.\nFifty plant-derived compounds are selected for the study. To determine whether\nthe examined drugs could bind to the KRAS complex's binding pocket, molecular\ndocking was performed. Computational analyses were used to assess the possible\nability of tested substances to pass the Blood Brain Barrier (BBB). To predict\nthe bioactivity of ligands a machine learning model was created. Five machine\nlearning models were created and have chosen the best one among them for\nanalyzing the bioactivity of each ligand. From the fifty plant-derived\ncompounds the compounds with the least binding energies are selected. Then\nbioactivity of these six compounds is analyzed using Random Forest Regression\nmodel. Adsorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion (ADME) properties of\ncompounds are analyzed. The results showed that borneol has powerful effects\nand acts as a promising agent for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. This\nsuggests that borneol found in plants like mint, ginger, rosemary, etc., is a\nsuccessful compound for the treatment of pancreatic cancer.",

When constrained to the same dataset size, VariFace\nconsiderably outperforms previous synthetic datasets (0.9200 $\\rightarrow$\n0.9405) and achieves comparable performance to face recognition models trained\nwith real data (Real Gap = -0.0065). In an unconstrained setting, VariFace not\nonly consistently achieves better performance compared to previous synthetic\nmethods across dataset sizes but also, for the first time, outperforms the real\ndataset (CASIA-WebFace) across six evaluation datasets. This sets a new\nstate-of-the-art performance with an average face verification accuracy of\n0.9567 (Real Gap = +0.0097) across LFW, CFP-FP, CPLFW, AgeDB, and CALFW\ndatasets and 0.9366 (Real Gap = +0.0380) on the RFW dataset.",

However, these models often struggle to represent\nhigh-frequency details due to the limited number of Gaussians. While the\ndensification strategy used in per-scene 3D Gaussian splatting (3D-GS)\noptimization can be adapted to the feed-forward models, it may not be ideally\nsuited for generalized scenarios. In this paper, we propose Generative\nDensification, an efficient and generalizable method to densify Gaussians\ngenerated by feed-forward models. Unlike the 3D-GS densification strategy,\nwhich iteratively splits and clones raw Gaussian parameters, our method\nup-samples feature representations from the feed-forward models and generates\ntheir corresponding fine Gaussians in a single forward pass, leveraging the\nembedded prior knowledge for enhanced generalization. Experimental results on\nboth object-level and scene-level reconstruction tasks demonstrate that our\nmethod outperforms state-of-the-art approaches with comparable or smaller model\nsizes, achieving notable improvements in representing fine details.",

In these systems, localized (extended) modes are associated with real\n(complex) energies. Here, we report that Anderson localized modes with complex\nenergies can also exist in such systems. The emergence of the complex-energy\nlocalized modes (CELMs) directly ties to the properties of the corresponding\npristine non-Hermitian system. Specifically, the density of states of the\ncomplex spectrum under the periodic boundary condition and the non-Bloch\nparity-time transition of the open-boundary chain both play critical roles in\nthe emergence of the CELMs. The coexistence of extended modes, real-energy\nlocalized modes (RELMs), and CELMs should be a generic phenomenon for 1D\nnon-Hermitian disordered systems under class AI.

For the latter, FSS\nexponents are found to be different at the infinite-system critical and the\npseudocritical point if free boundary conditions are used, and they are related\nto each other by using the crossover FSS theory.

    "abstract": "Backdoor attacks aim to inject a backdoor into a classifier such that it\npredicts any input with an attacker-chosen backdoor trigger as an\nattacker-chosen target class. Existing backdoor attacks require either\nretraining the classifier with some clean data or modifying the model's\narchitecture. As a result, they are 1) not applicable when clean data is\nunavailable, 2) less efficient when the model is large, and 3) less stealthy\ndue to architecture changes. In this work, we propose DFBA, a novel\nretraining-free and data-free backdoor attack without changing the model\narchitecture. Technically, our proposed method modifies a few parameters of a\nclassifier to inject a backdoor. Through theoretical analysis, we verify that\nour injected backdoor is provably undetectable and unremovable by various\nstate-of-the-art defenses under mild assumptions. Our evaluation on multiple\ndatasets further demonstrates that our injected backdoor: 1) incurs negligible\nclassification loss, 2) achieves 100% attack success rates, and 3) bypasses six\nexisting state-of-the-art defenses. Moreover, our comparison with a\nstate-of-the-art non-data-free backdoor attack shows our attack is more\nstealthy and effective against various defenses while achieving less\nclassification accuracy loss.",

    "abstract": "Community search over bipartite graphs is a fundamental problem, and finding\ninfluential communities has attracted significant attention. However, all\nexisting studies have used the minimum weight of vertices as the influence of\ncommunities. This leads to an inaccurate assessment of real influence in graphs\nwhere there are only a few vertices with low weights. In this paper, we propose\na new cohesive subgraph model named ($\\alpha$,$\\beta$)-influential community\nthat considers the average weight of vertices from two layers on bipartite\ngraphs, thereby providing a more comprehensive reflection of community\ninfluence. Based on this community model, we present a recursive algorithm that\ntraverses the entire bipartite graph to find top-$r$\n($\\alpha$,$\\beta$)-influential communities. To further expedite the search for\ninfluential communities, we propose a slim tree structure to reduce the search\nwidth and introduce several effective upper bounds to reduce the search depth.\nSince we have proven that this problem is NP-hard, using exact algorithms to\nfind top-$r$ ($\\alpha$,$\\beta$)-communities accurately is very time-consuming.\nTherefore, we propose an approximate algorithm using a greedy approach to find\ntop-$r$ ($\\alpha$,$\\beta$)-communities as quickly as possible. It only takes\n$O((n+m)+m\\log_{}{n})$ time. Additionally, we introduce a new pruning algorithm\nto improve the efficiency of the search.

Correct detection and classification of obstacles\nis critical to ensure safe, trustworthy driving decisions. Adversarial patches\naim to fool a DNN with intentionally generated patterns concentrated in a\nlocalized region of an image. In particular, object vanishing patch attacks can\ncause object detection models to fail to detect most or all objects in a scene,\nposing a significant practical threat to AVs.\n  This work proposes ADAV (Adversarial Defense for Autonomous Vehicles), a\nnovel defense methodology against object vanishing patch attacks specifically\ndesigned for autonomous vehicles. Unlike existing defense methods which have\nhigh latency or are designed for static images, ADAV runs in real-time and\nleverages contextual information from prior frames in an AV's video feed. ADAV\nchecks if the object detector's output for the target frame is temporally\nconsistent with the output from a previous reference frame to detect the\npresence of a patch. If the presence of a patch is detected, ADAV uses\ngradient-based attribution to localize adversarial pixels that break temporal\nconsistency. This two stage procedure allows ADAV to efficiently process clean\ninputs, and both stages are optimized to be low latency.

    "abstract": "A hypothetical particle known as the axion holds the potential to resolve\nboth the cosmic dark matter riddle and particle physics' long-standing, strong\nCP dilemma. An unusually strong 21-cm absorption feature associated with the\ninitial star formation era, i.e., the dark ages, may be due to ultralight axion\ndark matter ($\\sim 10^{-22}$ eV) at this time. The radio wave observation's\n21-cm absorption signal can be explained as either anomalous baryon cooling or\nanomalous cosmic microwave background photon heating. Shortly after the axions\nor axion-like particles (ALPs) thermalize among themselves and form a\nBose-Einstein condensate, the cold dark matter ALPs make thermal contact with\nbaryons, cooling them. ALPs are thought to be the source of some new evidence\nfor dark matter, as the baryon temperature at cosmic dawn was lower than\npredicted based on presumptions. The detection of baryon acoustic oscillations\nis found to be consistent with baryon cooling by dark matter ALPs.\nSimultaneously, under the influence of the primordial black hole and/or\nintergalactic magnetic fields, the dark radiation composed of ALPs can\nresonantly transform into photons, significantly heating up the radiation in\nthe frequency range relevant to the 21-cm tests. When examining the 21-cm\ncosmology at redshifts $z$ between 200 and 20, we see that, when taking into\naccount both heating and cooling options at the same time, heating eliminated\nthe theoretical excess number of neutrino species, $\\Delta N_{eff}$, from the\ncooling effect.",

Vision-based crack detection has become the mainstream\napproach due to its ease of implementation and effectiveness. Fusing infrared\n(IR) channels with red, green and blue (RGB) channels can enhance feature\nrepresentation and thus improve crack detection. However, IR and RGB channels\noften differ in resolution. To align them, higher-resolution RGB images\ntypically need to be downsampled to match the IR image resolution, which leads\nto the loss of fine details.

    "abstract": "Floods are among the most prevalent and destructive natural disasters, often\nleading to severe social and economic impacts in urban areas due to the high\nconcentration of assets and population density. In Iran, particularly in\nTehran, recurring flood events underscore the urgent need for robust urban\nresilience strategies. This paper explores flood resilience models to identify\nthe most effective approach for District 6 in Tehran. Through an extensive\nliterature review, various resilience models were analyzed, with the Climate\nDisaster Resilience Index (CDRI) emerging as the most suitable model for this\ndistrict due to its comprehensive resilience dimensions: Physical, Social,\nEconomic, Organizational, and Natural Health resilience. Although the CDRI\nmodel provides a structured approach to resilience measurement, it remains a\nstatic model focused on spatial characteristics and lacks temporal\nadaptability. An extensive literature review enhances the CDRI model by\nintegrating data from 2013 to 2022 in three-year intervals and applying machine\nlearning techniques to predict resilience dimensions for 2025. This integration\nenables a dynamic resilience model that can accommodate temporal changes,\nproviding a more adaptable and data driven foundation for urban flood\nresilience planning. By employing artificial intelligence to reflect evolving\nurban conditions, this model offers valuable insights for policymakers and\nurban planners to enhance flood resilience in Tehrans critical District 6.",

In this work, we introduce\nKAN-PnP, an optimisation framework that incorporates Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks\n(KANs) as denoisers within the Plug-and-Play (PnP) paradigm. KAN-PnP is\nspecifically designed to solve inverse problems with single-instance priors,\nwhere only a single noisy observation is available, eliminating the need for\nlarge datasets typically required by traditional denoising methods. We show\nthat KANs, based on the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, serve\neffectively as priors in such settings, providing a robust approach to\ndenoising. We prove that the KAN denoiser is Lipschitz continuous, ensuring\nstability and convergence in optimisation algorithms like PnP-ADMM, even in the\ncontext of single-shot learning. Additionally, we provide theoretical\nguarantees for KAN-PnP, demonstrating its convergence under key conditions: the\nconvexity of the data fidelity term, Lipschitz continuity of the denoiser, and\nboundedness of the regularisation functional. These conditions are crucial for\nstable and reliable optimisation. Our experimental results show, on\nsuper-resolution and joint optimisation, that KAN-PnP outperforms exiting\nmethods, delivering superior performance in single-shot learning with minimal\ndata.

    "abstract": "Linear system solvers are widely used in scientific computing, with the\nprimary goal of solving linear system problems. Classical iterative algorithms\ntypically rely on the conjugate gradient method. The rise of quantum computing\nhas spurred interest in quantum linear system problems (QLSP), particularly\nfollowing the introduction of the HHL algorithm by Harrow et al. in 2009, which\ndemonstrated the potential for exponential speedup compared to classical\nalgorithms. However, the performance of the HHL algorithm is constrained by its\ndependence on the square of the condition number. To address this limitation,\nalternative approaches based on adiabatic quantum computing (AQC) have been\nproposed, which exhibit complexity scaling linearly with the condition number.\nAQC solves QLSP by smoothly varying the parameters of the Hamiltonian. However,\nthis method suffers from high Hamiltonian simulation complexity. In response,\nthis work designs new Hamiltonians and proposes a quantum discrete adiabatic\nlinear solver based on block encoding and eigenvalue separation techniques\n(BEES-QDALS). This approach bypasses Hamiltonian simulation through a\nfirst-order approximation and leverages block encoding to achieve equivalent\nnon-unitary operations on qubits. By comparing the fidelity of the original\nalgorithm and BEES-QDALS when solving QLSP with a fixed number of steps, and\nthe number of steps required to reach a target fidelity, it is found that\nBEES-QDALS significantly outperforms the original algorithm. Specifically,\nBEES-QDALS achieves higher fidelity with the same number of steps and requires\nfewer steps to reach the same target fidelity.",

    "abstract": "As Large Language Models (LLMs) scale to longer context windows, the\ncomputational cost of attention mechanisms, which traditionally grows\nquadratically with input length, presents a critical challenge for real-time\nand memory-constrained deployments. Existing sparse attention techniques have\nsought to reduce this complexity, but they often incur significant overhead or\ncompromise accuracy, making them less practical for large contexts on mid-range\nhardware. In this paper, we introduce SparseAccelerate, a dynamic sparse\nattention method that adapts its sparsity patterns based on input\ncharacteristics, effectively flattening the attention complexity curve. Our\napproach is effective for input lengths starting at 16K tokens and scales\nefficiently up to 128K tokens on dual NVIDIA A5000 GPUs (24GB each).\nExperimental results show that SparseAccelerate achieves up to a 1.04x\nreduction in Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) latency at 32K tokens, while also\nproviding substantial memory savings. These improvements yield practical gains\nfor memory-intensive applications and long-context tasks that were previously\ninfeasible with standard attention. Beyond latency reductions, SparseAccelerate\nfundamentally shifts the scaling trend, demonstrating the smallest TTFT growth\ngradient relative to context length among competing methods. Ongoing\nevaluations on diverse benchmarks confirm its scalability, positioning\nSparseAccelerate as a critical advancement toward efficient, real-time, and\nlarge-context LLM inference on accessible hardware.",

In the\nfuture, UAVs will likely play a pivotal role in autonomous package delivery,\nbut current multi-rotor candidates suffer from poor energy efficiency leading\nto insufficient endurance and range. In order to reduce the power demands of\npackage delivery UAVs while still maintaining necessary hovering capabilities,\ncompanies like Amazon are experimenting with hybrid Vertical Take-Off and\nLanding (VTOL) platforms. Tailsitter VTOLs offer a mechanically simple and\ncost-effective solution compared to other hybrid VTOL configurations, and while\nadvances in hardware and microelectronics have optimized the tailsitter for\npackage delivery, the software behind its operation has largely remained a\ncritical barrier to industry adoption. Tailsitters currently lack a generic,\ncomputationally efficient method of control that can provide strong safety and\nrobustness guarantees over the entire flight domain. Further, tailsitters lack\na closed-form method of designing dynamically feasible transition maneuvers\nbetween hover and cruise. In this paper, we survey the modeling and control\nmethods currently implemented on small-scale tailsitter UAVs, and attempt to\nleverage a nonlinear dynamic model to design physically realizable,\ncontinuous-pitch transition maneuvers at constant altitude. Primary results\nfrom this paper isolate potential barriers to constant-altitude transition, and\na novel approach to bypassing these barriers is proposed.

We construct ARRNs from Laplacian residuals, which\nserve as generic adaptive-resolution adapters for fixed-resolution layers, and\nwhich allow casting high-resolution ARRNs into low-resolution ARRNs at\ninference time by simply omitting high-resolution Laplacian residuals, thus\nreducing computational cost on low-resolution signals without compromising\nperformance. We complement this novel component with Laplacian dropout, which\nregularizes for robustness to a distribution of lower resolutions, and which\nalso regularizes for errors that may be induced by approximate smoothing\nkernels in Laplacian residuals.

Furthermore, the substantial variation in the number of\ndiscriminative areas across diverse object categories is misaligned with the\nfixed-number patch matching used in current methods, introducing noisy visual\ncues that hinder the accurate capture of target semantics. To tackle these\nchallenges, we propose a novel category-adaptive cross-modal semantic\nrefinement and transfer (C$^2$SRT) framework to explore the semantic\ncorrelation both within each category and across different categories, in a\ncategory-adaptive manner. The proposed framework consists of two complementary\nmodules, i.e., intra-category semantic refinement (ISR) module and\ninter-category semantic transfer (IST) module. Specifically, the ISR module\nleverages the cross-modal knowledge of the VLP model to adaptively find a set\nof local discriminative regions that best represent the semantics of the target\ncategory. The IST module adaptively discovers a set of most correlated\ncategories for a target category by utilizing the commonsense capabilities of\nLLMs to construct a category-adaptive correlation graph and transfers semantic\nknowledge from the correlated seen categories to unseen ones. Extensive\nexperiments on OV-MLR benchmarks clearly demonstrate that the proposed C$^2$SRT\nframework outperforms current state-of-the-art algorithms.",

    "abstract": "One fundamental question in database theory is the following: Given a Boolean\nconjunctive query Q, what is the best complexity for computing the answer to Q\nin terms of the input database size N? When restricted to the class of\ncombinatorial algorithms, it is known that the best known complexity for any\nquery Q is captured by the submodular width of Q. However, beyond combinatorial\nalgorithms, certain queries are known to admit faster algorithms that often\ninvolve a clever combination of fast matrix multiplication and data\npartitioning. Nevertheless, there is no systematic way to derive and analyze\nthe complexity of such algorithms for arbitrary queries Q.\n  In this work, we introduce a general framework that captures the best\ncomplexity for answering any Boolean conjunctive query Q using matrix\nmultiplication. Our framework unifies both combinatorial and non-combinatorial\ntechniques under the umbrella of information theory. It generalizes the notion\nof submodular width to a new stronger notion called the omega-submodular width\nthat naturally incorporates the power of fast matrix multiplication. We\ndescribe a matching algorithm that computes the answer to any query Q in time\ncorresponding to the omega-submodular width of Q.

While recent advances in one-shot human motion transfer have led to\nsignificant improvement in results, it remains challenging for methods with 2D\nbody landmarks, skeleton and semantic mask to accurately capture\ncorrespondences between source and driving poses due to the large variation in\nmotion and articulation complexity. In addition, the accuracy and precision of\nDensePose degrade the image quality for neural-rendering-based methods. To\naddress the limitations and by both considering the importance of appearance\nand geometry for motion transfer, in this work, we proposed a unified framework\nthat combines multi-scale feature warping and neural texture mapping to recover\nbetter 2D appearance and 2.5D geometry, partly by exploiting the information\nfrom DensePose, yet adapting to its inherent limited accuracy. Our model takes\nadvantage of multiple modalities by jointly training and fusing them, which\nallows it to robust neural texture features that cope with geometric errors as\nwell as multi-scale dense motion flow that better preserves appearance.\nExperimental results with full and half-view body video datasets demonstrate\nthat our model can generalize well and achieve competitive results, and that it\nis particularly effective in handling challenging cases such as those with\nsubstantial self-occlusions.",

This is no surprise due to the\nubiquity of graph data in large scale industrial settings. Tacitly assumed in\nall graph learning tasks is the separation of the graph structure and node\nfeatures: node features strictly encode individual data while the graph\nstructure consists only of pairwise interactions. The driving belief is that\nnode features are (by themselves) insufficient for these tasks, so benchmark\nperformance accurately reflects improvements in graph learning. In our paper,\nwe challenge this orthodoxy by showing that, surprisingly, node features are\noftentimes more-than-sufficient for many common graph benchmarks, breaking this\ncritical assumption. When comparing against a well-tuned feature-only MLP\nbaseline on seven of the most commonly used graph learning datasets, one gains\nlittle benefit from using graph structure on five datasets. We posit that these\ndatasets do not benefit considerably from graph learning because the features\nthemselves already contain enough graph information to obviate or substantially\nreduce the need for the graph. To illustrate this point, we perform a feature\nstudy on these datasets and show how the features are responsible for closing\nthe gap between MLP and graph-method performance. Further, in service of\nintroducing better empirical measures of progress for graph neural networks, we\npresent a challenging parametric family of principled synthetic datasets that\nnecessitate graph information for nontrivial performance. Lastly, we section\nout a subset of real-world datasets that are not trivially solved by an MLP and\nhence serve as reasonable benchmarks for graph neural networks.",

Although such practice does not require expensive annotations, it\ninevitably introduces mismatched pairs and results in a noisy correspondence\nproblem. Current approaches leverage the memorization effect of deep neural\nnetworks to distinguish noise and perform re-weighting. However, briefly\nlowering the weight of noisy pairs cannot eliminate the negative impact of\nnoisy correspondence in the training process. In this paper, we propose a novel\nself-drop and dual-weight approach, which achieves elaborate data processing by\nqua-partitioning the data.

Based on this observation, we employ\nself-drop to discard noisy samples to effectively mitigate the impact of noise.\nIn addition, we adopt a dual-weight strategy to ensure that the model focuses\nmore on significant samples while appropriately leveraging vague samples.\nCompared to the prior works, our approach is more robust and demonstrates\nrelatively more stable performance on noisy datasets, especially under a high\nnoise ratio.

We formulate\nan ordinary differential equation (ODE) model for the populations of SMCs, MDMs\nand smooth muscle cell-derived macrophages (SDMs) and the internalised lipid\nload in each population. We use this model to explore the effect on plaque fate\nof SMC phenotype switching. We find that when SMCs switch to a macrophage-like\nphenotype, the total lipid contained in cells in the plaque increases.\nAdditionally, removal of SMCs from the plaque via phenotype switching reduces\nthe fibrous plaque cap, increases the lipid in the necrotic core, and increases\nplaque inflammation. This makes the plaque more vulnerable to rupture, which\ncan lead to heart attacks and strokes. When SDMs are highly proliferative and\nresistant to cell death, the plaque grows rapidly and becomes highly\npathological.

    "abstract": "In online advertising, the demand-side platform (a.k.a.

From the perspective of DSP, the following are two overlooked issues.\nOn the one hand, the number of ad creatives cannot grow indefinitely. On the\nother hand, the marginal effects of ad cost diminish as the number of ad\ncreatives increases. To this end, this paper proposes a two-stage framework\nnamed Automated Creatives Quota (ACQ) to achieve the automatic creation and\ndeactivation of ad creatives. ACQ dynamically allocates the creative quota\nacross multiple advertisers to maximize the revenue of the ad platform. ACQ\ncomprises two components: a prediction module to estimate the cost of a photo\nunder different numbers of ad creatives, and an allocation module to decide the\nquota for photos considering their estimated costs in the prediction module.\nSpecifically, in the prediction module, we develop a multi-task learning model\nbased on an unbalanced binary tree to effectively mitigate the target variable\nimbalance problem. In the allocation module, we formulate the quota allocation\nproblem as a multiple-choice knapsack problem (MCKP) and develop an efficient\nsolver to solve such large-scale problems involving tens of millions of ads.

To solve the above\nlimitations, we introduce a novel method named ASGDiffusion for parallel HR\ngeneration with Asynchronous Structure Guidance (ASG) using pre-trained\ndiffusion models. To solve the pattern repetition problem of HR image\ngeneration, ASGDiffusion leverages the low-resolution (LR) noise weighted by\nthe attention mask as the structure guidance for the denoising step to ensure\nsemantic consistency. The proposed structure guidance can significantly\nalleviate the pattern repetition problem. To enable parallel generation, we\nfurther propose a parallelism strategy, which calculates the patch noises and\nstructure guidance asynchronously. By leveraging multi-GPU parallel\nacceleration, we significantly accelerate generation speed and reduce memory\nusage per GPU. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method effectively\nand efficiently addresses common issues like pattern repetition and achieves\nstate-of-the-art HR generation.",

    "abstract": "Planning in complex environments requires an agent to efficiently query a\nworld model to find a feasible sequence of actions from start to goal. Recent\nwork has shown that Large Language Models (LLMs), with their rich prior\nknowledge and reasoning capabilities, can potentially help with planning by\nsearching over promising states and adapting to feedback from the world. In\nthis paper, we propose and study two fundamentally competing frameworks that\nleverage LLMs for query-efficient planning. The first uses LLMs as a heuristic\nwithin a search-based planner to select promising nodes to expand and propose\npromising actions. The second uses LLMs as a generative planner to propose an\nentire sequence of actions from start to goal, query a world model, and adapt\nbased on feedback. We show that while both approaches improve upon comparable\nbaselines, using an LLM as a generative planner results in significantly fewer\ninteractions. Our key finding is that the LLM as a planner can more rapidly\nadapt its planning strategies based on immediate feedback than LLM as a\nheuristic. We present evaluations and ablations on Robotouille and PDDL\nplanning benchmarks and discuss connections to existing theory on\nquery-efficient planning algorithms.

However, existing\nsystems suffer from excessive module latency during request dispatching, low\nexecution throughput during module scheduling, and wasted latency budget during\nlatency splitting for multi-DNN application, which undermines their capability\nto minimize the serving cost.\n  In this paper, we design a DNN inference system called Harpagon, which\nminimizes the serving cost under latency constraints with a three-level design.\nIt first maximizes the batch collection rate with a batch-aware request\ndispatch policy to minimize the module latency. It then maximizes the module\nthroughput with multi-tuple configurations and proper amount of dummy requests.\nIt also carefully splits the end-to-end latency into per-module latency budget\nto minimize the total serving cost for multi-DNN applications. Evaluation shows\nthat Harpagon outperforms the state of the art by 1.49 to 2.37 times in serving\ncost while satisfying the latency objectives.

Gaussian Process (GP)\nregression, in its current form, fits a curve to a set of data pairs, with each\npair consisting of an input point 'x' and its corresponding target regression\nvalue 'y(x)' (a positive data pair). However, to account for obstacles, we need\nto constrain the GP to avoid a target regression value 'y(x-)' for an input\npoint 'x-' (a negative data pair). Our proposed approach, 'GP-ND' (Gaussian\nProcess with Negative Datapairs), fits the model to the positive data pairs\nwhile avoiding the negative ones. Specifically, we model the negative data\npairs using small blobs of Gaussian distribution and maximize their KL\ndivergence from the GP.

For a given pairing channel, we show that the\nsuperconducting fitness with the associated static order appears prominently in\nthe expression for the coupling constant. We consequently argue that fit gaps\n(for which the static order is not pair-breaking) should have an attractive\ninteraction, whereas unfit gaps (for which the static order is pair-breaking)\nhave a repulsive interaction. We propose a simple heuristic test for the\ntendency of a given pairing state to have an attractive interaction.

In this paper,\nwe propose a novel attention-based mask generation methodology that searches\nfor the optimal trigger shape and location. We also introduce a\nQuality-of-Experience (QoE) term into the loss function and carefully adjust\nthe transparency value of the trigger in order to make the backdoored samples\nto be more natural. To further improve the prediction accuracy of the victim\nmodel, we propose an alternating retraining algorithm in the backdoor injection\nprocess. The victim model is retrained with mixed poisoned datasets in even\niterations and with only benign samples in odd iterations. Besides, we launch\nthe backdoor attack under a co-optimized attack framework that alternately\noptimizes the backdoor trigger and backdoored model to further improve the\nattack performance. Apart from DNN models, we also extend our proposed attack\nmethod against vision transformers.

Existing data synthesis methods either depend on\nextensive seed datasets or struggle to balance task relevance and data\ndiversity. To address these challenges, we propose Attribute-guided multI-hop\nData Expansion (AIDE), a novel data synthesis framework that uses a multi-hop\nprocess to expand very few seed data points while ensuring data diversity and\ntask relevance. AIDE extracts the main topic and key knowledge attributes from\nthe seeds to guide the synthesis steps. The process repeats for K hops, using\nthe generated data as seeds. To prevent irrelevant data generation as the hop\ndepth increases, AIDE incorporates a residual connection mechanism. Our\nempirical results show that AIDE enables fine-tuning of Mistral-7B,\nLlama-3.1-8B and Llama-3.2-3B from 10 seeds, surpassing the models fine-tuned\non human curated data.

Despite extensive research over\nthe past decades aimed at understanding their asymptotic and (near) minimax\noptimality properties, a precise understanding of their regret behavior remains\nelusive. This gap has not only hindered the evaluation of their actual\nalgorithmic efficiency, but also limited further developments in statistical\ninference in sequential data collection.\n  This paper bridges these two fundamental aspects--precise regret analysis and\nadaptive statistical inference--through a deterministic characterization of the\nnumber of arm pulls for an UCB index algorithm [Lai87, Agr95, ACBF02]. Our\nresulting precise regret formula not only accurately captures the actual\nbehavior of the UCB algorithm for finite time horizons and individual problem\ninstances, but also provides significant new insights into the regimes in which\nthe existing theory remains informative. In particular, we show that the\nclassical Lai-Robbins regret formula is exact if and only if the sub-optimality\ngaps exceed the order $\\sigma\\sqrt{K\\log T/T}$. We also show that its maximal\nregret deviates from the minimax regret by a logarithmic factor, and therefore\nsettling its strict minimax optimality in the negative.\n  The deterministic characterization of the number of arm pulls for the UCB\nalgorithm also has major implications in adaptive statistical inference.\nBuilding on the seminal work of [Lai82], we show that the UCB algorithm\nsatisfies certain stability properties that lead to quantitative central limit\ntheorems in two settings including the empirical means of unknown rewards in\nthe bandit setting. These results have an important practical implication:\nconventional confidence sets designed for i.i.d. data remain valid even when\ndata are collected sequentially.",

    "abstract": "Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) promise efficient spatio-temporal data\nprocessing owing to their dynamic nature. This paper addresses a significant\nchallenge in radio astronomy, Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) detection, by\nreformulating it as a time-series segmentation task inherently suited for SNN\nexecution. Automated RFI detection systems capable of real-time operation with\nminimal energy consumption are increasingly important in modern radio\ntelescopes. We explore several spectrogram-to-spike encoding methods and\nnetwork parameters, applying first-order leaky integrate-and-fire SNNs to\ntackle RFI detection. To enhance the contrast between RFI and background\ninformation, we introduce a divisive normalisation-inspired pre-processing\nstep, which improves detection performance across multiple encoding strategies.\nOur approach achieves competitive performance on a synthetic dataset and\ncompelling results on real data from the Low-Frequency Array (LOFAR)\ninstrument. To our knowledge, this work is the first to train SNNs on real\nradio astronomy data successfully. These findings highlight the potential of\nSNNs for performing complex time-series tasks, paving the way for efficient,\nreal-time processing in radio astronomy and other data-intensive fields.",

To accurately characterize\nthe long-term dynamical evolution of charged particles around Kerr-MOG black\nhole, it is essential to utilize numerical algorithms that are high-precision,\nstable, and capable of preserving the inherent physical structural properties.\nIn this study, we employ explicit symplectic algorithms combined with the\nHamiltonian splitting technique to numerically solve the equations of motion\nfor charged particles. Initially, by decomposing the Hamiltonian into five\nintegrable components, three distinct explicit symplectic algorithms ($S2$,\n$S4$, and $PR{K_6}4$) are constructed. Numerical experiments reveal that the\n$PR{K_6}4$ algorithm achieves superior accuracy. Subsequently, we utilize\nPoincar\\'e sections and the Fast Lyapunov Indicator (FLI) to investigate the\ndynamic evolution of the particle. Our numerical results demonstrate that the\nenergy $E$, angular momentum $L$, magnetic field parameter $\\beta$, black hole\nspin parameter $a$, and MOG parameter $\\alpha$ all significantly influence the\nparticle's motion. Specifically, the chaotic region expands with increases in\n$E$, $\\beta$, or $\\alpha$, but contracts with increases in $a$ or $L$.\nFurthermore, when any two of these five parameters are varied simultaneously,\nit becomes evident that $a$ and $L$ predominantly dictate the system's\nbehavior. This study not only offers novel insights into the chaotic dynamics\nassociated with Kerr-MOG black holes but also extends the application of\nsymplectic algorithms in strong gravitational field.",

To avoid potential inference attacks\nfrom exchanged parameters, differential privacy (DP) offers rigorous guarantee\nagainst various attacks. However, conventional methods of ensuring DP by adding\nlocal noise alone often result in low training accuracy. Combining secure\nmulti-party computation (SMPC) with DP, while improving the accuracy, incurs\nhigh communication and computation overheads as well as straggler\nvulnerability, in either client-to-server or client-to-client links. In this\npaper, we propose LightDP-FL, a novel lightweight scheme that ensures provable\nDP against untrusted peers and server, while maintaining straggler resilience,\nlow overheads and high training accuracy. Our scheme incorporates both\nindividual and pairwise noise into each client's parameter, which can be\nimplemented with minimal overheads. Given the uncertain straggler and colluder\nsets, we utilize the upper bound on the numbers of stragglers and colluders to\nprove sufficient noise variance conditions to ensure DP in the worst case.\nMoreover, we optimize the expected convergence bound to ensure accuracy\nperformance by flexibly controlling the noise variances.

Deformation twins, lattice curvature, and intragranular\nmicrofractures in the samples were quantitatively characterised using\nforescattered electron images and electron backscatter diffraction.\nMicrostructural analyses revealed that twins accommodate most of the shortening\nduring the first 2% strain, whereas lattice curvature associated with\ngeometrically necessary dislocations predominantly develops in the later\nstages. Intragranular fracture intensity exhibits an almost linear correlation\nwith strain during the first 2% strain but increases more slowly thereafter.\nThe mechanical data indicate a strong temperature dependence of yield stress,\nconsistent with the temperature dependence of the critical resolved shear\nstress for dislocation glide.
