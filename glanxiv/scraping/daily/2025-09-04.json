However, RL agents often face training challenges in\nsample efficiency and effective exploration, making it difficult to discover an\noptimal driving strategy. To address these issues, we propose guiding the RL\ndriving agent with a demonstration policy that need not be a highly optimized\nor expert-level controller. Specifically, we integrate a rule-based lane change\ncontroller with the Soft Actor Critic (SAC) algorithm to enhance exploration\nand learning efficiency. Our approach demonstrates improved driving performance\nand can be extended to other driving scenarios that can similarly benefit from\ndemonstration-based guidance.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in autonomous driving have underscored the importance of\naccurate 3D object detection, with LiDAR playing a central role due to its\nrobustness under diverse visibility conditions. However, different vehicle\nplatforms often deploy distinct sensor configurations, causing performance\ndegradation when models trained on one configuration are applied to another\nbecause of shifts in the point cloud distribution. Prior work on multi-dataset\ntraining and domain adaptation for 3D object detection has largely addressed\nenvironmental domain gaps and density variation within a single LiDAR; in\ncontrast, the domain gap for different sensor configurations remains largely\nunexplored. In this work, we address domain adaptation across different sensor\nconfigurations in 3D object detection. We propose two techniques: Downstream\nFine-tuning (dataset-specific fine-tuning after multi-dataset training) and\nPartial Layer Fine-tuning (updating only a subset of layers to improve\ncross-configuration generalization). Using paired datasets collected in the\nsame geographic region with multiple sensor configurations, we show that joint\ntraining with Downstream Fine-tuning and Partial Layer Fine-tuning consistently\noutperforms naive joint training for each configuration. Our findings provide a\npractical and scalable solution for adapting 3D object detection models to the\ndiverse vehicle platforms.",

We use this extensive multiwavelength dataset for both\ndirect and indirect constraints on the progenitor system.

We further model\nnebular-phase spectra using radiative transfer models and nucleosynthesis\nyields for core-collapse supernovae, which suggest a progenitor initial mass in\nthe range of 10-15 solar masses. Meanwhile, blackbody fitting of the detected\npre-explosion counterpart in the F814W and F160W bands indicates a red\nsupergiant with a lower initial mass of approximately 7.5 solar masses.

According to the\nconventional picture, the cores of most black hole progenitors lose almost all\nof their angular momentum when their outer layers are ejected before core\ncollapse. Accordingly, most black holes are expected to be born with\ndimensionless spin magnitudes of $\\chi \\lesssim 0.01$, even if some black holes\nare born with non-negligible spin due to tidal interactions in a progenitor\nbinary. One might therefore expect to find a large fraction of $\\chi \\lesssim\n0.01$ black holes in merging binary black hole (BBH) systems. We find that the\nconventional picture of angular momentum transport is in tension with data from\nLIGO--Virgo--KAGRA's fourth gravitational-wave transient catalog. We find no\nsupport for a sub-population of BBH systems with $\\chi \\lesssim 0.01$. Neither\ndo we find support for a sub-population with only one spinning black hole as\nexpected for tidal spin-up scenarios.

We compared the models in terms of different body types and\nfunctional purposes (e.g., fashionwear, sportswear) so that designers could\nevaluate effectiveness before developing actual patterns, make necessary\nmodifications, and conduct fashion forecasting beforehand. To facilitate deeper\nanalysis, we created a custom dataset specifically for fabric image generation\nand classification. Our analysis revealed that, in terms of fabric\nconstruction, the OpenAI DALL-E model integrated with ChatGPT outperformed\nother models, achieving a lower LPIPS (Learned Perceptual Image Patch\nSimilarity) score of approximately $0.2$. In fabric classification from images,\nwe found OpenAI offered the best results by breaking down certain factors\n(e.g., breathability, moisture-wicking, and tactile comfort), achieving\napproximately $80\\%$ accuracy for base construction and $55\\%$ for detailed\nconstruction.

ODKE+ dynamically generates\nontology snippets tailored to each entity type to align extractions with schema\nconstraints, enabling scalable, type-consistent fact extraction across 195\npredicates. The system supports batch and streaming modes, processing over 9\nmillion Wikipedia pages and ingesting 19 million high-confidence facts with\n98.8% precision.

A unified representation\nlearning framework is proposed. The framework builds a multi-intent\nrepresentation module and an uncertainty modeling mechanism. It extracts\nmulti-granularity interest structures from user behavior sequences. Behavioral\nambiguity and preference fluctuation are captured using Bayesian distribution\nmodeling. In the multi-intent modeling part, the model introduces multiple\nlatent intent vectors. These vectors are weighted and fused using an attention\nmechanism to generate semantically rich representations of long-term user\npreferences. In the uncertainty modeling part, the model learns the mean and\ncovariance of behavior representations through Gaussian distributions. This\nreflects the user's confidence in different behavioral contexts. Next, a\nlearnable fusion strategy is used to combine long-term intent and short-term\nbehavior signals. This produces the final user representation, improving both\nrecommendation accuracy and robustness. The method is evaluated on standard\npublic datasets. Experimental results show that it outperforms existing\nrepresentative models across multiple metrics. It also demonstrates greater\nstability and adaptability under cold-start and behavioral disturbance\nscenarios. The approach alleviates modeling bottlenecks faced by traditional\nmethods when dealing with complex user behavior.

Conventional automotive radars are usually based on\nfar-field models and estimate the target's range, radial velocity, and\ndirection-of-arrival (DOA) but are not able to estimate the tangential\ncomponent of the target 2-D velocity, which is a critical parameter for\nreliable perception of dynamic environments. To address this challenge, we\nintroduce the near-field radar model, which considers various migration\nelements in range, radial velocity, and Doppler along time and space.\nConventionally, these migration effects result in smearing of the likelihood\nfunction for estimating the target parameters. However, if the model is\ncorrectly specified, these migration effects are informative for tangential\nvelocity estimation. We conduct an identifiability analysis for tangential\nvelocity estimation using the Cram\\'er-Rao bound and ambiguity function. The\ninsights from this study motivate the use of a separated array configuration\nand the development of a computationally efficient maximum likelihood based\nalgorithm designed to utilize target migrations for tangential velocity\nestimation, while maintaining practical computational complexity. In addition\nto tangential velocity estimation, the proposed algorithm mitigates likelihood\nsmearing in range, radial velocity, and Doppler. Simulations validate the\ntheoretical feasibility study, and evaluate the algorithms' performance in both\nsingle- and multi-target scenarios.

While the majority of geospatial databases (GDBs)\nprovide high-quality information, their data is (i) limited to specific regions\nand/or (ii) missing some entities, even in their covered areas. Map conflation\nis the process of augmentation of a GDB using another GDB to conflate missing\nspatial features. Existing map conflation methods suffer from two main\nlimitations: (1) They are designed for the conflation of linear objects (e.g.,\nroad networks) and cannot simply be extended to non-linear objects, thus\nmissing information about most entities in the map. (2) They are heuristic\nalgorithmic approaches that are based on pre-defined rules, unable to learn\nentities matching in a data-driven manner. To address these limitations, we\ndesign KRAFT, a learning based approach consisting of three parts: (1)\nKnowledge Graph Construction - where each GDB is represented by a knowledge\ngraph, (2) Map Matching - where we use a knowledge graph alignment method as\nwell as a geospatial feature encoder to match entities in obtained knowledge\ngraphs, and (3) Map Merging - where we merge matched entities in the previous\nmodules in a consistent manner, using a mixed integer linear programming\nformulation that fully merges the GDBs without adding any inconsistencies.

We introduce\nGetNetUPAM, a hierarchical nested cross-validation framework designed to\nquantify model stability under ecologically realistic variability. Data are\npartitioned into distinct site-year segments, preserving recording\nheterogeneity and ensuring each validation fold reflects a unique environmental\nsubset, reducing overfitting to localized noise and sensor artifacts. Site-year\nblocking enforces evaluation against genuine environmental diversity, while\nstandard cross-validation on random subsets measures generalization across\nUPAM's full signal distribution, a dimension absent from current benchmarks.\nUsing GetNetUPAM as the evaluation backbone, we propose the Adaptive Resolution\nPooling and Attention Network (ARPA-N), a neural architecture for irregular\nspectrogram dimensions. Adaptive pooling with spatial attention extends the\nreceptive field, capturing global context without excessive parameters. Under\nGetNetUPAM, ARPA-N achieves a 14.4% gain in average precision over DenseNet\nbaselines and a log2-scale order-of-magnitude drop in variability across all\nmetrics, enabling consistent detection across site-year folds and advancing\nscalable, accurate bioacoustic monitoring.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the phases of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) at finite\ntemperature and baryon density is crucial for describing matter in heavy-ion\ncollisions and the interior of neutron stars. While the transition from the\nconfined phase to the deconfined phase has been extensively studied at\nvanishing chemical potential, recent theoretical work suggests the existence of\nintermediate phases with partial deconfinement, where only a subset of the\ncolor degrees of freedom is deconfined. In this paper, we study the\ngeneralization of partial deconfinement in QCD in the Veneziano large-$N_{\\rm\nc}$ limit ($N_{\\rm f}/N_{\\rm c}$ fixed) to finite baryon chemical potential. We\nfind that the partially deconfined phase has finer structure, and hence that\nthere are four phases in QCD at finite temperature and moderately large\nchemical potential: complete confinement, complete deconfinement, and two kinds\nof partial deconfinement. A key ingredient is the refined understanding of the\nmeaning of the 'Gross-Witten-Wadia point', i.e., the opening of a gap in the\ndistribution of Polyakov line phases: either string condensation or baryon\ncondensation causes the GWW transition. As a by-product, we observe the\nemergence of the QCD critical point from the interplay between baryon\ncondensation and partial deconfinement. While our approach is necessarily\nqualitative due to the fermion sign problem, it provides a unified theoretical\nframework for understanding the rich phase structure of dense QCD matter and\noffers new perspectives on the location and nature of the QCD critical point.",

The rigid-body-dynamics model generates swimming\nmotion by imposing a nonholonomic (NH) constraint on the tail of a two-body\nsystem, requiring that tail-fin velocity aligns with the tail angle under rigid\nfluid idealization, while the head moves in a straight line. The system has one\ndegree of freedom, with equations of motion derived using Lagrange multipliers.\nTwo-dimensional CFD simulations validate the model in an incompressible\nNewtonian fluid, where the resolved tail fin interacts with fluid through the\nimmersed boundary method until steady-state swimming is achieved. The\nvalidation demonstrates excellent quantitative agreement between CFD and model\npredictions for body orientation angle and normal fluid force across variations\nin fin motion amplitude, period, and Reynolds number. While an exact NH\nconstraint point does not exist, an effective period-averaged NH location can\nbe identified for successful model predictions. At higher Reynolds numbers, the\ntwo-body kinematics displays independence from the Reynolds number variation.\nThe CFD data reveal that the two-body model captures the type of power-law\nrelationship between Reynolds and Strouhal numbers governing undulatory\nswimming from tadpoles to whales, indicating that the simplified two-link model\nis representative of swimming dynamics in continuous geometries at various\nscales.

The strength of the Pf delta\nemission relative to the 3.3 PAH feature is significantly stronger than typical\nhigher metallicity star-forming galaxies.

Our analysis shows that while the\noverall PAH fraction is lower in II Zw 40 than in higher metallicity galaxies,\nthe contribution of the 3.3 um PAH feature to the total PAH emission is higher.\nWe propose that the PAH size distribution is fundamentally shaped by two\ncompeting mechanisms in low-metallicity environments: photo-destruction and\ninhibited growth.

However, most existing approaches assume specific parametric\nforms for the learning rule (e.g., Q-learning, policy gradient) or are limited\nto simplified settings like bandit tasks, which do not involve learning a new\ninput-output mapping from scratch. In contrast, animals must often learn new\nbehaviors de novo, which poses a rich challenge for learning-rule inference. We\ntarget this problem by inferring learning rules directly from animal\ndecision-making data during de novo task learning, a setting that requires\nmodels flexible enough to capture suboptimality, history dependence, and rich\nexternal stimulus integration without strong structural priors. We first\npropose a nonparametric framework that parameterizes the per-trial update of\npolicy weights with a deep neural network (DNN), and validate it by recovering\nground-truth rules in simulation. We then extend to a recurrent variant (RNN)\nthat captures non-Markovian dynamics by allowing updates to depend on trial\nhistory. Applied to a large behavioral dataset of mice learning a sensory\ndecision-making task over multiple weeks, our models improved predictions on\nheld-out data. The inferred rules revealed asymmetric updates after correct\nversus error trials and history dependence, consistent with non-Markovian\nlearning. Overall, these results introduce a flexible framework for inferring\nbiological learning rules from behavioral data in de novo learning tasks,\nproviding insights to inform experimental training protocols and the\ndevelopment of behavioral digital twins.",

In\nessence, if multiple observers perform nearly interaction-free measurements\naround a closed loop (or any network containing cycles), their locally certain\nconclusions cannot all be mutually consistent in a single classical narrative.\nWe formalize this as a circular consistency theorem and a family of exclusivity\ninequalities that any non-contextual, single-world hidden-variable model must\nsatisfy. These constraints extend the CIFP beyond an n-lab ring to arbitrary\nnetwork topologies, enforcing an NGCC bound on joint outcome probabilities.\nQuantum mechanics violates these bounds for sufficiently small epsilon,\nimplying that no single-world, non-contextual model (even one allowing slight\nmeasurement disturbance) can reproduce the quantum predictions in such\nscenarios.

This paper presents the first\ncomprehensive hallucination evaluation of Arabic and multilingual LLMs on two\ncritical Arabic natural language generation tasks: generative question\nanswering (GQA) and summarization. This study evaluates a total of 12 LLMs,\nincluding 4 Arabic pre-trained models, 4 multilingual models, and 4\nreasoning-based models. To assess the factual consistency and faithfulness of\nLLMs' outputs, we developed a fine-grained hallucination evaluation framework\nconsisting of 12 fine-grained hallucination indicators that represent the\nvarying characteristics of each task. The results reveal that factual\nhallucinations are more prevalent than faithfulness errors across all models\nand tasks.

    "abstract": "In the Strip Packing problem, we are given a vertical strip of fixed width\nand unbounded height, along with a set of axis-parallel rectangles. The task is\nto place all rectangles within the strip, without overlaps, while minimizing\nthe height of the packing. This problem is known to be NP-hard. The Bottom-Left\nAlgorithm is a simple and widely used heuristic for Strip Packing. Given a\nfixed order of the rectangles, it places them one by one, always choosing the\nlowest feasible position in the strip and, in case of ties, the leftmost one.\nBaker, Coffman, and Rivest proved in 1980 that the Bottom-Left Algorithm has\napproximation ratio 3 if the rectangles are sorted by decreasing width. For the\npast 45 years, no alternative ordering has been found that improves this bound.\nWe introduce a new rectangle ordering and show that with this ordering the\nBottom-Left Algorithm achieves a 13/6 approximation for the Strip Packing\nproblem.",

    "abstract": "As our cities and communities become smarter, the systems that keep us safe,\nsuch as traffic control centers, emergency response networks, and public\ntransportation, also become more complex. With this complexity comes a greater\nrisk of security threats that can affect not just machines but real people's\nlives. To address this challenge, we present ThreatGPT, an agentic Artificial\nIntelligence (AI) assistant built to help people whether they are engineers,\nsafety officers, or policy makers to understand and analyze threats in public\nsafety systems. Instead of requiring deep cybersecurity expertise, it allows\nusers to simply describe the components of a system they are concerned about,\nsuch as login systems, data storage, or communication networks. Then, with the\nclick of a button, users can choose how they want the system to be analyzed by\nusing popular frameworks such as STRIDE, MITRE ATT&CK, CVE reports, NIST, or\nCISA. ThreatGPT is unique because it does not just provide threat information,\nbut rather it acts like a knowledgeable partner. Using few-shot learning, the\nAI learns from examples and generates relevant smart threat models. It can\nhighlight what might go wrong, how attackers could take advantage, and what can\nbe done to prevent harm. Whether securing a city's infrastructure or a local\nhealth service, this tool adapts to users' needs. In simple terms, ThreatGPT\nbrings together AI and human judgment to make our public systems safer.

In this work, we report the layer-dependent\nchemical reactivity of MoS2 during a nitridation atomic substitution reaction\nand attribute it to the rearrangement of Mo atoms. Our results show that the\nchemical reactivity of MoS2 decreases as the number of layers is reduced in the\nfew-layer regime.

The layer-dependent reactivity is\nattributed to the relative stability of the hypothetically formed MoN phase\nwhich retain the number of Mo atomic layers present in the precursor.\nSpecifically, the low chemical reactivity of monolayer MoS2 is attributed to\nthe high energy cost associated with Mo atom diffusion and migration necessary\nto form multi-layer Mo lattices in the thermodynamically stable MoN phase.

During this study, participants completed a human-AI\ncooperation task using the Pig Chase game. Participants of different\nself-identified demographics interacted with AI agents whose perceived racial\nidentities were manipulated, allowing us to assess how sociocultural\nperspectives influence the decision-making of participants in the game. After\nthe game, participants completed a survey questionnaire to explain the\nstrategies they used while playing the game and to understand the perceived\nintelligence of their AI teammates. Statistical analysis of task behavior data\nrevealed a statistically significant effect of the participant's demographic,\nas well as the interaction between this self-identified demographic and the\ntreatment condition (i.e., the perceived demographic of the agent). The results\nindicated that Non-White participants viewed AI agents racialized as White in a\npositive way compared to AI agents racialized as Black.

A\nbaseline cognitive model of the task using ACT-R cognitive architecture was\nused to understand a cognitive-level, process-based explanation of the\nparticipants' perspectives based on results found from the study.

We detail the design of three distinct task\nenvironments with increasing complexity: (1) a conditional avoidance task, (2)\na one-dimensional predator-prey scenario, and (3) a replication of the classic\nPong game. For each environment, we formalize the state and action spaces, the\nsensory encoding and motor decoding mechanisms, and the feedback protocols\nbased on predictable (reward) and unpredictable (punishment) stimulation.\nFurthermore, we propose a novel meta-learning approach where a Large Language\nModel (LLM) is used to automate the generation and optimization of experimental\nprotocols, scaling the process of environment and curriculum design. Finally,\nwe outline a multi-modal approach for evaluating learning by measuring synaptic\nplasticity at electrophysiological, cellular, and molecular levels.

Traditional\nTDE algorithms generally yield time delays that are integer multiples of the\noperating sampling period, potentially lacking sufficient time resolution. To\nachieve subsample TDE accuracy, various interpolation methods, including\nparabolic, Gaussian, frequency, and sinc interpolation, have been proposed.\nThis paper presents a comprehensive study on time delay interpolation to\nachieve subsample accuracy for acoustic reflector localization in reverberant\nconditions.

Simulations show that sinc and\nWhittaker-Shannon interpolation outperform existing methods in terms of time\ndelay error and positional error for critically sampled and band-limited\nreflections. Performance is evaluated on real-world measurements from the\nMYRiAD dataset, showing that sinc and Whittaker-Shannon interpolation\nconsistently provide reliable performance across different sensor-source pairs\nand loudspeaker positions.

Atmospheric muons are particles produced when energetic atomic nuclei\n(cosmic rays) collide with nuclei in the upper atmosphere, producing a shower\nof secondary particles (muons) that propagates to the Earth's surface. The\nsurface atmospheric muon flux is known to be proportional to the local\natmospheric density field, implying that this technique can be used as a\nmeasurement of atmospheric density. This study examines the potential for using\natmospheric muon flux measurements to improve atmospheric state estimation via\na case study of simulated atmospheric muon observations in the path of tropical\ncyclone Freddy. We show that improvement in data assimilation performance can\nbe achieved using data from a relatively small astroparticle detector, well\nwithin the capabilities of existing astroparticle technology. We additionally\nshow that the improvements to atmospheric state estimates associated with muon\nflux assimilation are at least partially unique to muon flux measurements, as\ncomparable surface pressure point measurements do not reproduce a similar\neffect.",

While virtualized Radio Access Networks\n(vRANs) enable dynamic spectrum sharing across cells, compute resource\nallocation for baseband processing, especially in multi-cell deployments with\nheterogeneous workloads, remains underexplored. In this paper, we present\nNEXUS, the first system to realize real-time, virtualized multi-cell mmWave\nbaseband processing on a single server with heterogeneous compute resources.\nNEXUS integrates software-based digital signal processing pipelines with\nhardware-accelerated LDPC decoding, and introduces a novel framework for\nsharing Intel's ACC100 eASIC across multiple CPU cores via virtual functions\n(VFs). For single-cell operation, NEXUS employs a random forest (RAF)-based\nmodel that predicts the most energy-efficient resource allocation for the given\ncell configuration with microsecond-level inference latency and high accuracy.\nFor multi-cell scenarios, NEXUS introduces a power-aware scheduler that\nincorporates a lightweight contention model to adjust resource allocation\nstrategies under concurrent execution. Through extensive evaluation across\nvarious Frequency Range 2 (FR2) cell configurations, we show that NEXUS\nsupports up to 16 concurrent cells under full load, achieving 5.37Gbps\naggregate throughput, while reducing the multi-cell scheduling search space by\norders of magnitude.

The\nintegrated analytics module supports origin-destination tracking, vehicle count\nvisualization, inter-class correlation analysis, and heatmap-based congestion\nmodeling.

While conformal prediction offers\nfinite-sample guarantees in finite-dimensional spaces, it does not directly\nextend to function-valued outputs. Existing approaches (Gaussian processes,\nBayesian neural networks, and quantile-based operators) require strong\ndistributional assumptions or yield conservative coverage. This work extends\nsplit conformal prediction to function spaces following a two step method. We\nfirst establish finite-sample coverage guarantees in a finite-dimensional space\nusing a discretization map in the output function space.

While classical tools like robust\nadaptive control can ensure predictable performance, their consolidation with\ndata-driven methods remains a challenge and, when attempted, leads to\nconservative results. The difficulty of consolidation stems from the inherently\ndifferent `spaces' that robust control and data-driven methods occupy.\nData-driven methods suffer from the distribution-shift problem, which current\nrobust adaptive controllers can only tackle if using over-simplified learning\nmodels and unverifiable assumptions.

By duality, we simultaneously obtain integral representation\nformulas (i.e., left-inverses up to a finite rank operator) for overdetermined\nPDEs $P^{\\ast} v = g$ with analogous properties, which lead to Poincar\\'e- or\nKorn-type inequalities. Our method applies to operators such as the divergence,\nlinearized scalar curvature, and linearized Einstein constraint operators\n(which are underdetermined), as well as the gradient, Hessian, trace-free part\nof the Hessian, Killing, and conformal Killing operators (which are\noverdetermined).\n  The starting point for our construction is a condition - dubbed the recovery\non curves condition (RC) - that leads to Green's functions for $P$ supported on\nprescribed curves. Then the desired integral solution operators (and, by\nduality, integral representation formulas) are obtained by taking smooth\naverages over a suitable family of curves. This procedure generalizes the\nprevious constructions of Bogovskii, Oh-Tataru, and Reshetnyak. We furthermore\nidentify a simple algebraic sufficient condition for (RC), namely, that the\nprincipal symbol $p(x, \\xi)$ of $P$ is full-rank for all non-zero complex\nvectors $\\xi$ (as opposed to real, as in ellipticity). When the principal\nsymbol has constant coefficients, this is equivalent to (RC) and also to the\ncondition that the formal cokernel of $P$ (without any boundary conditions) is\nfinite-dimensional; for this reason, we call it the finite-dimensional cokernel\ncondition (FC).

    "abstract": "Inorganic antiperovskite nitrides have recently emerged as promising\nmaterials for photovoltaic applications, yet their nonradiative recombination\ndynamics remain largely unexplored. Here, we examine the influence of X-site\ncation substitution on the nonradiative electron-hole recombination in\n$\\mathrm{X_{3}NSb}$ ($X = \\mathrm{Ca}, \\mathrm{Sr}, \\mathrm{Ba}$). Ca- and\nSr-based compounds adopt a cubic phase, whereas Ba stabilizes in a hexagonal\nstructure, introducing pronounced symmetry-driven effects. Substituting Ca with\nSr narrows the band gap, suppresses octahedral and band-edge fluctuations,\nreduces nonadiabatic (NA) coupling by $\\sim 54\\%$, and extends carrier\nlifetimes by a factor of $2.5$. In contrast, Ba substitution increases lattice\ndistortion, widens the band gap, and enhances NA coupling beyond that of\n$\\mathrm{Sr_{3}NSb}$, thereby accelerating recombination through stronger\nlattice fluctuations. The resulting band gap fluctuations in\n$\\mathrm{Ba_{3}NSb}$ also shorten decoherence times, following the trend\n$\\mathrm{Ba_{3}NSb} < \\mathrm{Ca_{3}NSb} < \\mathrm{Sr_{3}NSb}$. Our results\ndemonstrate how the interplay between band gap, NA coupling, and decoherence\ntime governs recombination lifetimes, with $\\mathrm{Sr_{3}NSb}$ exhibiting the\nlongest lifetime. These findings highlight the coupled influence of cation\nchemistry and crystal symmetry in tailoring carrier dynamics for\nhigh-performance antiperovskite-based optoelectronics materials.",

    "abstract": "Multimodal foundation models can process several modalities. However, since\nthe space of possible modalities is large and evolving over time, training a\nmodel from scratch to encompass all modalities is unfeasible. Moreover,\nintegrating a modality into a pre-existing foundation model currently requires\na significant amount of paired data, which is often not available for\nlow-resource modalities. In this paper, we introduce a method for\nsample-efficient modality integration (SEMI) into Large Language Models (LLMs).\nTo this end, we devise a hypernetwork that can adapt a shared projector --\nplaced between modality-specific encoders and an LLM -- to any modality. The\nhypernetwork, trained on high-resource modalities (i.e., text, speech, audio,\nvideo), is conditioned on a few samples from any arbitrary modality at\ninference time to generate a suitable adapter. To increase the diversity of\ntraining modalities, we artificially multiply the number of encoders through\nisometric transformations. We find that SEMI achieves a significant boost in\nsample efficiency during few-shot integration of new modalities (i.e.,\nsatellite images, astronomical images, inertial measurements, and molecules)\nwith encoders of arbitrary embedding dimensionality. For instance, to reach the\nsame accuracy as 32-shot SEMI, training the projector from scratch needs\n64$\\times$ more data. As a result, SEMI holds promise to extend the modality\ncoverage of foundation models.",

Our analysis reveals no\nstrong evidence of effect heterogeneity across trials, with the exception of\npotential age-related variability.

In subsequent\nsections, progressively complex drawing procedures are presented, starting from\nsite-independent drawing in the $k$-space. In the next, each site in the\nreal-space is again drawn independently, which is followed by an adjustable\nlinear transformation $T$. Both approaches are presented on the discrete\nGinzburg-Landau model. Subsequently, a percolation-based procedure for the\nIsing model is developed.

Finally, it is\nshown that results in the style of the real-space renormalization group can be\nachieved by suitable fractal-like drawing. This facilitates a new\nstraight-forward approach to establishing the renormalization transformation,\nbut primarily provides a new view on the method.

DISPATCH is attack-agnostic\nand requires no prior knowledge of the existing patches. Extensive experiments\nacross multiple detectors and attacks demonstrate that DISPATCH consistently\noutperforms state-of-the-art defenses on both hiding attacks and creating\nattacks, achieving the best overall mAP.5 score of 89.3% on hiding attacks, and\nlowering the attack success rate to 24.8% on untargeted creating attacks.\nMoreover, it maintains strong robustness against adaptive attacks, making it a\npractical and reliable defense for object detection systems.",

It is known that a massless, minimally\ncoupled scalar field removes the chaos. However, in more general Horndeski\ntheories, the situation is more complex. We find that in shift-symmetric\n$K$-essence theories, chaos persists if the scalar field contribution to the\ninitial-value constraint is {\\it subleading} compared to that of the\nanisotropies. In this case, solutions oscillate as they approach the\nsingularity, just as in the vacuum case, and a similar behaviour is found when\na non-minimal coupling is included. If the scalar field contribution is not\nsubleading, then chaos is removed and the singularity is approached smoothly.\n  An unusual and entirely new result appears when changing the sign in front of\nthe scalar kinetic term, yielding the theory of a phantom scalar. If the scalar\nfield is subleading, then solutions remain chaotic and oscillate when\napproaching the singularity, as before. However, if the scalar field is not\nsubleading, solutions are also chaotic, but the spacetime singularity\ndisappears, and the universe behaves as an apparently infinite sequence of\nanisotropic bounces. The spatial volume then oscillates within finite bounds,\nnever reaching zero, while the amplitudes and positions of these oscillations\nappear completely random.

    "abstract": "The Nature of Dark Matter (DM), that constitutes approximately 25\\% of the\nenergy density in the Universe, is still eluding us. An intriguing possibility\nis that DM does indeed interacts with SM particles only gravitationally (the\nonly mean by which we have detected it so far), albeit in an extra-dimensional\nscenario yet it has not been possible to detect it by some non-gravitational\nmeans. In a three-brane Randall-Sundrum setup, with DM located on a Deep\nInfra-Red GeV-TeV brane, and the SM on an Infra-Red TeV-PeV one, it was shown\nto be possible to recover the observed DM relic abundance and somewhat relax\nthe hierarchy problem, whilst avoiding LHC stringent bounds on DM and KK\ngraviton masses that constrain severely similar two-brane setups. The\nphenomenological results, however, has been obtained under the assumption that\nthe bulk curvatures on the left ($k_1$) and the right ($k_2$) of the\nintermediate IR-brane are identical, $k_2 \\to k_1$. Since the brane tension\n$\\sigma_{\\rm IR}$ of the intermediate brane is proportional to $k_2 - k_1$ and,\ntherefore, vanishes, it is clear that this limit (for which the IR-brane\nbecomes {\\em evanescent}) is unphysical. We could say that this is {\\em no\nbrane}: if the brane tension of a brane vanishes, there is no brane in the bulk\n(pun intended). In this paper, therefore, we study in detail the theoretical\nframework needed to explore this interesting phenomenological possibility, {\\em\nout of the evanescent brane limit}. We show that most of the formul\\ae $\\,$used\nin the {\\em evanescent limit} are still valid for ${\\cal O}(1)$ differences\nbetween $k_1$ and $k_2$ (thus, introducing no new unjustified hierarchy in the\nbulk). Once the relevant couplings of radions and KK gravitons are computed, we\nstudy the (enlarged) parameter space of the model looking for the region in\nwhich the relic DM abundance is recovered.",

Direct searches\nsimultaneously target leptoquarks and right-handed neutrinos across four\nproduction modes--Pair/Single Symmetric and Pair/Single Asymmetric--enabled by\nYukawa coupling-driven decays.

    "abstract": "Speculative decoding is an emerging technique that accelerates large language\nmodel (LLM) inference by allowing a smaller draft model to predict multiple\ntokens in advance, which are then verified or corrected by a larger target\nmodel. In AI-native radio access networks (AI-RAN), this paradigm is\nwell-suited for collaborative inference between resource-constrained end\ndevices and more capable edge servers or base stations (BSs). However, existing\ndistributed speculative decoding requires transmitting the full vocabulary\nprobability distribution from the draft model on the device to the target model\nat the BS, which leads to prohibitive uplink communication overhead. To address\nthis issue, we propose a ``Top-K Sparse Logits Transmission (TK-SLT)`` scheme,\nwhere the draft model transmits only the top-K token raw probabilities and the\ncorresponding token indices instead of the entire distribution. This approach\nsignificantly reduces bandwidth consumption while maintaining inference\nperformance. We further derive an analytical expression for the optimal draft\nlength that maximizes inference throughput, and provide a theoretical analysis\nof the achievable speedup ratio under TK-SLT. Experimental results validate\nboth the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed method.",

Training agents that can reliably self-improve over such\nsequences at inference-time is a natural target for reinforcement learning\n(RL), yet the naive approach assumes a fixed maximum iteration depth, which can\nbe both costly and arbitrary. We present Exploratory Iteration (ExIt), a family\nof autocurriculum RL methods that directly exploits the recurrent structure of\nself-improvement tasks to train LLMs to perform multi-step self-improvement at\ninference-time while only training on the most informative single-step\niterations. ExIt grows a task space by selectively sampling the most\ninformative intermediate, partial histories encountered during an episode for\ncontinued iteration, treating these starting points as new self-iteration task\ninstances to train a self-improvement policy. ExIt can further pair with\nexplicit exploration mechanisms to sustain greater task diversity. Across\nseveral domains, encompassing competition math, multi-turn tool-use, and\nmachine learning engineering, we demonstrate that ExIt strategies, starting\nfrom either a single or many task instances, can produce policies exhibiting\nstrong inference-time self-improvement on held-out task instances, and the\nability to iterate towards higher performance over a step budget extending\nbeyond the average iteration depth encountered during training.",

    "abstract": "Observations of gravitational waves from binary black hole mergers, including\nthe recent signals GW231123 and GW230529, have revealed multiple progenitor\nblack holes in the so-called upper and lower mass gaps, respectively. It is\ngenerally assumed that massive stars cannot form black holes in the upper mass\ngap because pair instabilities in the late stage of stellar evolution disrupt\nthe stars, whereas the lower mass gap refers to the gap between the maximum\nallowed neutron star mass and the smallest black hole mass expected to form in\nsupernova explosions. Here we explore a \"premature collapse\" scenario in which\nupper mass gap stars collapse and form black holes before they reach the late\nstage of stellar evolution. The mechanism for triggering a premature collapse\nis the capture of a smaller black hole, possibly primordial in nature. A\nsimilar capture scenario can occur to produce black holes in the lower mass\ngap. At least for massive stars, typical stellar rotation rates would likely\nresult in rapidly rotating black holes in such a scenario, naturally explaining\nthe rapid spins inferred from GW231123. Even though our estimates hinge on\nseveral parameters with rather large uncertainties, they suggest that, at least\nin galactic disks, the likelihood of such a capture is small for stars in the\nupper mass gap, but may lead to a significant population of black holes in the\nlower mass gap and, in fact, even below the lower mass gap.",

    "abstract": "The Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) is the nearest low-metallicity dwarf galaxy.\nIts proximity and low reddening has enabled us to detect its Wolf-Rayet (WR)\nstar population with 12 known objects. Quantitative spectroscopy of the stars\nrevealed half of these WR stars to be strong sources of He ii ionizing flux,\nbut the average metallicity of the SMC is below where WR bumps are usually\ndetected in integrated galaxy spectra showing nebular He ii emission. Utilizing\nthe Local Volume Mapper (LVM), we investigate regions around the six SMC WN3h\nstars, whose winds are thin enough to avoid He recombination and allow photons\nwith > 54 eV to escape. Focusing on He ii 4686 {\\AA}, we show that the broad\nstellar wind component, the strongest optical diagnostic of the WN3h stars, is\ndiluted within 24 pc in the integrated light from LVM, making the WR stars hard\nto detect in low-metallicity integrated regions. In addition, we compare the He\nii ionizing flux from LVM with the values inferred from the stellar atmosphere\ncode PoWR and find that the nebular emission around them only in some cases\nreflects the high amounts emitted by the stars. We conclude that early-type WN\nstars with comparably weak winds are viable sources to produce the observed He\nii ionizing flux in low-metallicity galaxies. The easy dilution of the stellar\nsignatures can explain the rareness of WR bump detections at 12 + log O/H <\n8.0, while at the same time providing major candidates for the observed excess\nof nebular He ii emission. This constitutes a challenge for population\nsynthesis models across all redshifts as the evolutionary path towards this\nobserved WR population at low metallicity remains enigmatic.",

However, formation\nmodels indicate that composition gradients can exist. Such composition\ngradients can significantly affect the planetary thermal evolution. In\nnon-convective layers, the heat transport is governed by multiple processes. We\ninvestigate how the evolution and internal structure of Neptunes and\nsub-Neptunes is affected when considering non-convective layers and the\nsensitivity of the results on the assumed thermal conductivity. Methods. We\nsimulate the planetary evolution by considering thermal transport via\nradiation, electrons, and vibrational conductivity. We consider planetary\nmasses of 5, 10 and 15 ME, three different initial energy budgets, and two\ndifferent primordial composition profiles. We find that the assumed\nconductivity significantly affects the planetary thermal evolution. We show\nthat the commonly used conductivity assumption is inappropriate for modeling\nthis planetary type. Furthermore, we find that the inferred radii deviate by\n~20% depending on the assumed conductivity. The uncertainty on the primordial\nentropy in planets with non-convective layers leads to a difference of ~25% in\nthe radii. This shows that the theoretical uncertainties are significantly\nlarger than the observed ones, and emphasizes the importance of these\nparameters. We conclude that the characterization and modeling of\nintermediate-mass gaseous planets strongly depend on the modeling approach and\nthe model assumptions. We demonstrate that the existence of composition\ngradients significantly affects the inferred radius.

In particular, structured jet\nand cocoon scenarios are inconsistent with the observed sharp rebrightening and\nmulti-day optical emission, while the refreshed shock model is ruled out due to\nits inconsistency with collapsar hydrodynamics. Drawing on 3D\ngeneral-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations, we present the\nmulti-scale angular and radial structure characterizing collapsar outflows. The\nresulting morphology features episodic, wobbling jets with a \"top-hat\"\ngeometry, embedded within a smoother global cocoon and disk ejecta angular\nstructure. The wobbling jets give rise to variations in radiative efficiency\nthat can account for the observed alternation between X-ray-dominated and\n$\\gamma$-ray-dominated jet emission. The top-hat structure of individual\nwobbling jet episodes naturally explains the sudden rebrightening observed when\nthe emission from the top-hat jet cores enters the observer's line of sight.\nThe radial structure is consistent with that inferred from observations of\nstripped-envelope supernovae.

Here, we\npresent an improved version of the \"resummation\" model, which maps observed\nhalo baryon fractions of massive haloes ($M_{\\mathrm{500c}}\\gtrsim 10^{12.5}\\,\n\\mathrm{M_\\odot}$) to a flexible suppression signal - i.e. the ratio of\nbaryonic to dark-matter-only (DMO) matter power spectra - using zero free\nparameters. We apply this model to the FLAMINGO hydrodynamical simulations,\nobtaining a typical precision of $\\lesssim 1\\%$ for\n$k\\,\\leq\\,10\\,h\\mathrm{\\,Mpc^{-1}}$ given mean halo baryon fractions within the\nspherical overdensity radii $R_{\\mathrm{500c}}$ and $R_{\\mathrm{200m}}$. When\nonly those within $R_{\\mathrm{500c}}$ are available, we still obtain $\\lesssim\n2\\%$ precision. We show that given small-scale stellar mass fractions, the\nmodel can be extended to yield $\\lesssim 3\\%$ precise suppression signals for\nall scales measured ($k\\,\\leq\\,25\\,h\\mathrm{\\,Mpc^{-1}}$). We also extend the\nmodel to redshifts $z>0$. Central to the model is a seemingly mass-independent\nand feedback-independent relation that allows observed halo masses to be mapped\nto equivalent DMO halo masses using only observed mean halo baryon fractions,\nto $\\lesssim 1\\%$ precision. We demonstrate that this relation can also be used\nto retrieve the DMO halo mass function from observed halo masses and baryon\nfractions with percent-level precision, without any assumptions on the strength\nof feedback. A Python package implementing the resummation model is made\npublicly available.",

    "abstract": "The origin of obscuration in Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) is still a matter\nof contention. It is unclear whether obscured AGN are primarily due to\nline-of-sight effects, a transitory, dust-enshrouded phase in galaxy evolution,\nor a combination of both. The role of an inner torus around the central SMBH\nalso remains unclear in pure Evolution models. We use cosmological\nsemi-analytic models and semi-empirical prescriptions to explore obscuration\neffects in AGN at 1<z<3. We consider a realistic object-by-object modelling of\nAGN evolution including different light curves (LCs) composed of phases of\nvarying levels of obscuration, mimicking the possible clearing effects of\nstrong AGN feedback. Evolution models characterized by AGN LCs with relatively\nshort pre-peak obscured phases followed by more extended optical/UV visible\npost-peak phases, struggle to reproduce the high fraction of obscured AGN at\nz~2-3 inferred from X-ray surveys. Evolution models characterised by LCs with\nsharp post-peak declines or persistent or multiple obscuration phases are more\nsuccessful, although they still face challenges in reproducing the steady drop\nin the fractions of obscured AGN with increasing luminosity measured by some\ngroups. Invoking a fine-tuning in the input LCs, with more luminous AGN defined\nby longer optical/UV visible windows, can improve the match to the decreasing\nfractions of obscured AGN with luminosity. Alternatively, a long-lived central\ntorus-like component, with thickness decreasing with increasing AGN power,\nnaturally boosts the luminosity-dependent fractions of obscured AGN, suggesting\nthat small-scale orientation effects may still represent a key component even\nin Evolution models. We also find that in our models major mergers and\nstarbursts, when considered in isolation, fall short in accounting for the\nlarge fractions of highly obscured faint AGN detected at cosmic noon.",

Our\nsample consists of 52 candidate binaries with projected separations of 7,000 -\n16,000 au and stellar masses from near the hydrogen-burning limit to the\nmain-sequence turnoff ($\\sim0.1$ - $0.8~{\\rm M_\\odot}$). By forward-modeling\nselection biases and chance alignments, we find that $1.25\\pm0.25\\%$ of\nBo\\\"{o}tes I stars are members of wide binaries with separations beyond 5,000\nau. This fraction, along with the distributions of separations and mass ratios,\nmatches that in the Solar neighborhood, suggesting that wide binary formation\nis largely insensitive to metallicity, even down to [Fe/H] $\\approx -2.5$. The\nobserved truncation in the separation distribution near 16,000 au is well\nexplained by stellar flyby disruptions. We also discuss how the binaries can be\nused to constrain the galaxy's dark matter properties. We show that our\ndetection places new limits on primordial black hole dark matter, finding that\ncompact objects with $M \\gtrsim 5~{\\rm M_\\odot}$ cannot constitute more than\n$\\sim1\\%$ of the dark matter content. In contrast to previous work, we find\nthat wide binaries are unlikely to provide robust constraints on the dark\nmatter profile of ultrafaint galaxies given the uncertainties in the initial\nbinary population, flyby disruptions, and contamination from chance alignments.\nThese findings represent the most robust detection of wide binaries in an\nexternal galaxy to date, opening a new avenue for studying binary star\nformation and survival in extreme environments.",

Recent simulation-based\nwork has suggested that the anisotropy profiles of remnants like GS/E decline\ntowards the center and may be well-fit by an Osipkov-Merritt-type distribution\nfunction (DF). We study the anisotropy profile of GS/E using a\nchemically-selected sample of stars from APOGEE DR17 and Gaia. We find that the\nanisotropy profile of GS/E is high and constant with $\\beta \\sim 0.9$ beyond 8\nkpc, dropping to $\\beta \\sim 0.4$ at 2 kpc. We fit a two-component\nOsipkov-Merritt anisotropy profile to the GS/E data, finding that a combination\nof profiles with scale radii $r_{\\mathrm{a}}=2$ kpc and 547 kpc, with a mixture\nfraction $k_\\mathrm{om} = 0.88$ provide a better fit to the data than a\nconstant anisotropy profile. Using this new DF, we re-assess the density\nprofile and mass of the GS/E remnant from a previous work that assumed a\ncontant-anisotropy DF, finding an increase in the derived mass from $1.5\\times\n10^{8}~\\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$ to $2.29 ^{+0.95}_{-0.63}\\times\n10^{8}~\\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$. In general, the combination Osipkov-Merritt DF more\nsatisfactorily matches the kinematics of the GS/E remnant than the constant\nanisotropy DF, and in the future will form a more reliable basis for modelling\nthe remnant. Additionally, these new constraints on the kinematics of GS/E near\nthe Galactic center are an important measurement for any future theoretical or\nsimulation-based investigation into its nature and origin.",

    "abstract": "Recent AI work trends towards incorporating human-centric objectives, with\nthe explicit goal of aligning AI models to personal preferences and societal\nvalues. Using standard preference elicitation methods, researchers and\npractitioners build models of human decisions and judgments, which are then\nused to align AI behavior with that of humans. However, models commonly used in\nsuch elicitation processes often do not capture the true cognitive processes of\nhuman decision making, such as when people use heuristics to simplify\ninformation associated with a decision problem. As a result, models learned\nfrom people's decisions often do not align with their cognitive processes, and\ncan not be used to validate the learning framework for generalization to other\ndecision-making tasks. To address this limitation, we take an axiomatic\napproach to learning cognitively faithful decision processes from pairwise\ncomparisons. Building on the vast literature characterizing the cognitive\nprocesses that contribute to human decision-making, and recent work\ncharacterizing such processes in pairwise comparison tasks, we define a class\nof models in which individual features are first processed and compared across\nalternatives, and then the processed features are then aggregated via a fixed\nrule, such as the Bradley-Terry rule. This structured processing of information\nensures such models are realistic and feasible candidates to represent\nunderlying human decision-making processes. We demonstrate the efficacy of this\nmodeling approach in learning interpretable models of human decision making in\na kidney allocation task, and show that our proposed models match or surpass\nthe accuracy of prior models of human pairwise decision-making.",

Despite their\nunique characteristics, ODIs exhibit remarkable differences from perspective\nimages in geometric projection, spatial distribution, and boundary continuity,\nmaking it challenging for direct domain adaption from perspective methods. This\nsurvey reviews recent panoramic vision techniques with a particular emphasis on\nthe perspective-to-panorama adaptation. We first revisit the panoramic imaging\npipeline and projection methods to build the prior knowledge required for\nanalyzing the structural disparities. Then, we summarize three challenges of\ndomain adaptation: severe geometric distortions near the poles, non-uniform\nsampling in Equirectangular Projection (ERP), and periodic boundary continuity.\nBuilding on this, we cover 20+ representative tasks drawn from more than 300\nresearch papers in two dimensions. On one hand, we present a cross-method\nanalysis of representative strategies for addressing panoramic specific\nchallenges across different tasks. On the other hand, we conduct a cross-task\ncomparison and classify panoramic vision into four major categories: visual\nquality enhancement and assessment, visual understanding, multimodal\nunderstanding, and visual generation. In addition, we discuss open challenges\nand future directions in data, models, and applications that will drive the\nadvancement of panoramic vision research.

While UMs can also\nsupport broader unimodal tasks (e.g., text-to-text, image-to-image), we focus\non the core cross-modal pair T2I and I2T, as consistency between understanding\nand generation is critical for downstream use. Existing evaluations consider\nthese capabilities in isolation: FID and GenEval for T2I, and benchmarks such\nas MME, MMBench for I2T. These single-pass metrics do not reveal whether a\nmodel that understands a concept can also render it, nor whether meaning is\npreserved when cycling between image and text modalities. To address this, we\nintroduce the Unified Consistency Framework for Unified Models (UCF-UM), a\ncyclic evaluation protocol that alternates I2T and T2I over multiple\ngenerations to quantify semantic drift. UCF formulates 3 metrics: (i) Mean\nCumulative Drift (MCD), an embedding-based measure of overall semantic loss;\n(ii) Semantic Drift Rate (SDR), that summarizes semantic decay rate; and (iii)\nMulti-Generation GenEval (MGG), an object-level compliance score extending\nGenEval. To assess generalization beyond COCO, which is widely used in\ntraining; we create a new benchmark ND400, sampled from NoCaps and DOCCI and\nevaluate on seven recent models. UCF-UM reveals substantial variation in\ncross-modal stability: some models like BAGEL maintain semantics over many\nalternations, whereas others like Vila-u drift quickly despite strong\nsingle-pass scores. Our results highlight cyclic consistency as a necessary\ncomplement to standard I2T and T2I evaluations, and provide practical metrics\nto consistently assess unified model's cross-modal stability and strength of\ntheir shared representations.

While much prior work has analyzed and improved temporal\nreasoning in LMs, most studies have focused solely on the Gregorian calendar.\nHowever, many non-Gregorian systems, such as the Japanese, Hijri, and Hebrew\ncalendars, are in active use and reflect culturally grounded conceptions of\ntime. If and how well current LMs can accurately handle such non-Gregorian\ncalendars has not been evaluated so far. Here, we present a systematic\nevaluation of how well open-source LMs handle one such non-Gregorian system:\nthe Japanese calendar. For our evaluation, we create datasets for four tasks\nthat require both temporal knowledge and temporal reasoning. Evaluating a range\nof English-centric and Japanese-centric LMs, we find that some models can\nperform calendar conversions, but even Japanese-centric models struggle with\nJapanese-calendar arithmetic and with maintaining consistency across calendars.\nOur results highlight the importance of developing LMs that are better equipped\nfor culture-specific calendar understanding.",

Second, we develop two complementary mappings: (i) small-signal\nlinearizations that yield locally valid LTI SSMs with interpretable poles and\nmemory horizons; and (ii) lifted/Koopman random-feature expansions that render\nthe ESN a linear SSM in an augmented state, enabling transfer-function and\nconvolutional-kernel analyses. This perspective yields frequency-domain\ncharacterizations of memory spectra and clarifies when ESNs emulate structured\nSSM kernels.

Their evolution is shaped by\nenergetic processes such as feedback from supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and\nmergers with other cosmic structures. The imprints of these processes on gas\nkinematic properties remain largely unknown, restricting our understanding of\ngas thermodynamics and energy conversion within clusters. High-resolution\nspectral mapping across a broad spatial-scale range provides a promising\nsolution to this challenge, enabled by the recent launch of the XRISM X-ray\nObservatory. Here, we present the kinematic measurements of the X-ray-brightest\nPerseus cluster with XRISM, radially covering the extent of its cool core. We\nfind direct evidence for the presence of at least two dominant drivers of gas\nmotions operating on distinct physical scales: a small-scale driver in the\ninner ~60 kpc, likely associated with the SMBH feedback; and a large-scale\ndriver in the outer core, powered by mergers. The inner driver sustains a\nheating rate at least an order of magnitude higher than the outer one. This\nfinding suggests that, during the active phase, the SMBH feedback generates\nturbulence, which, if fully dissipated into heat, could play a significant role\nin offsetting radiative cooling losses in the Perseus core. Our study\nunderscores the necessity of kinematic mapping observations of extended sources\nfor robust conclusions on the properties of the velocity field and their role\nin the assembly and evolution of massive halos.

This extended version is obtained by hybridizing a modified\nSu-Schrieffer-Heeger model featuring trimerized unit cells with the standard\nKitaev chain, resulting in a hexamer structure on the Majorana basis. Due to\nthe interplay between the sublattice configuration and the $p$-wave\nsuperconducting pairing, a rich structure of edge modes beyond the expected\nMajorana zero modes is obtained. The various Majorana edge modes are further\nfound to demonstrate considerable robustness against some generic perturbations\nand disorder.

These two types of data are typically used by\napproaches like Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT),\nrespectively. In this paper, we show that these approaches are not in\ncontradiction, but are instances of a single optimization process. We derive a\nUnified Policy Gradient Estimator, and present the calculations of a wide\nspectrum of post-training approaches as the gradient of a common objective\nunder different data distribution assumptions and various bias-variance\ntradeoffs. The gradient estimator is constructed with four interchangeable\nparts: stabilization mask, reference policy denominator, advantage estimate,\nand likelihood gradient. Motivated by our theoretical findings, we propose\nHybrid Post-Training (HPT), an algorithm that dynamically selects different\ntraining signals. HPT is designed to yield both effective exploitation of\ndemonstration and stable exploration without sacrificing learned reasoning\npatterns. We provide extensive experiments and ablation studies to verify the\neffectiveness of our unified theoretical framework and HPT.

Together, these components enable\nconvergence toward interpretable, heterogeneous causal patterns. Theoretically,\nwe show identifiability of heterogeneous causal structures under mild\nconditions.

Each agent independently\nlearns its closed-loop behavior from experimental data by solving convex\nsemidefinite programs that generate locally invariant ellipsoids and\ncorresponding state-feedback gains. These ellipsoids, centered along grid-based\nwaypoints, certify the dynamic feasibility of short-range transitions and\ndefine safe regions of operation. A sampling-based planner constructs a tree of\nsuch waypoints, where transitions are allowed only when adjacent ellipsoids\noverlap, ensuring invariant-to-invariant transitions and continuous safety. All\nagents expand their trees simultaneously and are coordinated through a\nspace-time reservation table that guarantees inter-agent safety by preventing\nsimultaneous occupancy and head-on collisions. Each successful edge in the tree\nis equipped with its own local controller, enabling execution without\nre-solving optimization problems at runtime. The resulting trajectories are not\nonly dynamically feasible but also provably safe with respect to both\nenvironmental constraints and inter-agent collisions. Simulation results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the approach in synthesizing synchronized,\nsafe trajectories for multiple agents under shared dynamics and constraints,\nusing only data and convex optimization tools.",

    "abstract": "Flow-based 3D generation models typically require dozens of sampling steps\nduring inference. Though few-step distillation methods, particularly\nConsistency Models (CMs), have achieved substantial advancements in\naccelerating 2D diffusion models, they remain under-explored for more complex\n3D generation tasks. In this study, we propose a novel framework, MDT-dist, for\nfew-step 3D flow distillation. Our approach is built upon a primary objective:\ndistilling the pretrained model to learn the Marginal-Data Transport. Directly\nlearning this objective needs to integrate the velocity fields, while this\nintegral is intractable to be implemented. Therefore, we propose two\noptimizable objectives, Velocity Matching (VM) and Velocity Distillation (VD),\nto equivalently convert the optimization target from the transport level to the\nvelocity and the distribution level respectively. Velocity Matching (VM) learns\nto stably match the velocity fields between the student and the teacher, but\ninevitably provides biased gradient estimates. Velocity Distillation (VD)\nfurther enhances the optimization process by leveraging the learned velocity\nfields to perform probability density distillation. When evaluated on the\npioneer 3D generation framework TRELLIS, our method reduces sampling steps of\neach flow transformer from 25 to 1 or 2, achieving 0.68s (1 step x 2) and 0.94s\n(2 steps x 2) latency with 9.0x and 6.5x speedup on A800, while preserving high\nvisual and geometric fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our\nmethod significantly outperforms existing CM distillation methods, and enables\nTRELLIS to achieve superior performance in few-step 3D generation.",

We construct a\nminimal description of UCEP with the density of the free energy $f =\nc_{1}(\\tilde{\\alpha}^{2}+c_{2})+(\\tilde{\\alpha}^{2}+c_{2})^{2}\\ln{\\vert\\tilde{\\alpha}^{2}+c_{2}\\vert}$,\nwith the UCEP at $(c_{1},c_{2})=(1/e,0)$ and $\\tilde{\\alpha}$ being the order\nparameter. We further map the finite-temperature phase diagram and perform a\nsymmetry analysis. By unifying first- and second-order signatures in a single,\ndirection-dependent endpoint, the UCEP introduces a qualitatively new class of\nphase transition and may have applications in fields such as quantum\nmeasurement and quantum sensing. This work also provides an intriguing platform\nfor exploring novel critical phenomena in cavity-coupled many-body systems with\nor without dissipation.",

    "abstract": "Interactive acoustic auralization allows users to explore virtual acoustic\nenvironments in real-time, enabling the acoustic recreation of concert hall or\nHistorical Worship Spaces (HWS) that are either no longer accessible,\nacoustically altered, or impractical to visit. Interactive acoustic synthesis\nrequires real-time convolution of input signals with a set of synthesis filters\nthat model the space-time acoustic response of the space. The acoustics in\nconcert halls and HWS are both characterized by a long reverberation time,\nresulting in synthesis filters containing many filter taps. As a result, the\nconvolution process can be computationally demanding, introducing significant\nlatency that limits the real-time interactivity of the auralization system. In\nthis paper, the implementation of a real-time multichannel loudspeaker-based\nauralization system is presented. This system is capable of synthesizing the\nacoustics of highly reverberant spaces in real-time using GPU-acceleration. A\ncomparison between traditional CPU-based convolution and GPU-accelerated\nconvolution is presented, showing that the latter can achieve real-time\nperformance with significantly lower latency. Additionally, the system\nintegrates acoustic synthesis with acoustic feedback cancellation on the GPU,\ncreating a unified loudspeaker-based auralization framework that minimizes\nprocessing latency.",

However, many prominent\nopen-source models prioritize scaling model parameters over optimizing training\nstrategies, limiting their efficiency and performance. In this work, we present\nUniPic2-SD3.5M-Kontext, a 2B-parameter DiT model based on SD3.5-Medium, which\nachieves state-of-the-art image generation and editing while extending\nseamlessly into a unified multimodal framework. Our approach begins with\narchitectural modifications to SD3.5-Medium and large-scale pre-training on\nhigh-quality data, enabling joint text-to-image generation and editing\ncapabilities. To enhance instruction following and editing consistency, we\npropose a novel Progressive Dual-Task Reinforcement strategy (PDTR), which\neffectively strengthens both tasks in a staged manner. We empirically validate\nthat the reinforcement phases for different tasks are mutually beneficial and\ndo not induce negative interference. After pre-training and reinforcement\nstrategies, UniPic2-SD3.5M-Kontext demonstrates stronger image generation and\nediting capabilities than models with significantly larger generation\nparameters-including BAGEL (7B) and Flux-Kontext (12B). Furthermore, following\nthe MetaQuery, we connect the UniPic2-SD3.5M-Kontext and Qwen2.5-VL-7B via a\nconnector and perform joint training to launch a unified multimodal model\nUniPic2-Metaquery. UniPic2-Metaquery integrates understanding, generation, and\nediting, achieving top-tier performance across diverse tasks with a simple and\nscalable training paradigm.

Recent advances in two-moment CR hydrodynamics have\nalleviated some of these challenges, improving understanding of CR feedback.\nYet, current two-moment methods may not be able to directly incorporate all\nrelevant CR transport processes, while the outcome of CR feedback sensitively\ndepends on these underlying microphysics. Furthermore, numerical challenges\npersist, including instabilities from streaming terms and ambiguities in solver\ndesign for coupled CR-MHD systems. In this work, we develop a two-moment\ndescription for CR hydrodynamics from first principles. Beyond canonical CR\nstreaming, our formulation accounts for CR pressure anisotropy and Alfv\\'en\nwaves propagating in both directions along the magnetic field, providing a\ngeneral framework to incorporate more CR transport physics.

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in neural representations, such as Neural Radiance Fields\nand 3D Gaussian Splatting, have increased interest in applying style transfer\nto 3D scenes. While existing methods can transfer style patterns onto\n3D-consistent neural representations, they struggle to effectively extract and\ntransfer high-level style semantics from the reference style image.\nAdditionally, the stylized results often lack structural clarity and\nseparation, making it difficult to distinguish between different instances or\nobjects within the 3D scene. To address these limitations, we propose a novel\n3D style transfer pipeline that effectively integrates prior knowledge from\npretrained 2D diffusion models. Our pipeline consists of two key stages: First,\nwe leverage diffusion priors to generate stylized renderings of key viewpoints.\nThen, we transfer the stylized key views onto the 3D representation. This\nprocess incorporates two innovative designs. The first is cross-view style\nalignment, which inserts cross-view attention into the last upsampling block of\nthe UNet, allowing feature interactions across multiple key views. This ensures\nthat the diffusion model generates stylized key views that maintain both style\nfidelity and instance-level consistency. The second is instance-level style\ntransfer, which effectively leverages instance-level consistency across\nstylized key views and transfers it onto the 3D representation. This results in\na more structured, visually coherent, and artistically enriched stylization.\nExtensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our 3D\nstyle transfer pipeline significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods\nacross a wide range of scenes, from forward-facing to challenging 360-degree\nenvironments.

In recent years, pretrained Multimodal Large Language\nModels (MLLMs) have advanced rapidly, leading to a significant increase in\nimage aesthetics research that integrates both visual and textual modalities.\nHowever, most existing studies on image aesthetics primarily focus on\npredicting aesthetic ratings and have shown limited application in AIC.\nExisting AIC works leveraging MLLMs predominantly rely on fine-tuning methods\nwithout specifically adapting MLLMs to focus on target aesthetic content. To\naddress this limitation, we propose the Aesthetic Saliency Enhanced Multimodal\nLarge Language Model (ASE-MLLM), an end-to-end framework that explicitly\nincorporates aesthetic saliency into MLLMs. Within this framework, we introduce\nthe Image Aesthetic Saliency Module (IASM), which efficiently and effectively\nextracts aesthetic saliency features from images. Additionally, we design\nIAS-ViT as the image encoder for MLLMs, this module fuses aesthetic saliency\nfeatures with original image features via a cross-attention mechanism. To the\nbest of our knowledge, ASE-MLLM is the first framework to integrate image\naesthetic saliency into MLLMs specifically for AIC tasks.

    "abstract": "With growing public safety demands, text-based person anomaly search has\nemerged as a critical task, aiming to retrieve individuals with abnormal\nbehaviors via natural language descriptions. Unlike conventional person search,\nthis task presents two unique challenges: (1) fine-grained cross-modal\nalignment between textual anomalies and visual behaviors, and (2) anomaly\nrecognition under sparse real-world samples. While Large Multi-modal Models\n(LMMs) excel in multi-modal understanding, their potential for fine-grained\nanomaly retrieval remains underexplored, hindered by: (1) a domain gap between\ngenerative knowledge and discriminative retrieval, and (2) the absence of\nefficient adaptation strategies for deployment. In this work, we propose\nAnomalyLMM, the first framework that harnesses LMMs for text-based person\nanomaly search. Our key contributions are: (1) A novel coarse-to-fine pipeline\nintegrating LMMs to bridge generative world knowledge with retrieval-centric\nanomaly detection; (2) A training-free adaptation cookbook featuring masked\ncross-modal prompting, behavioral saliency prediction, and knowledge-aware\nre-ranking, enabling zero-shot focus on subtle anomaly cues. As the first study\nto explore LMMs for this task, we conduct a rigorous evaluation on the PAB\ndataset, the only publicly available benchmark for text-based person anomaly\nsearch, with its curated real-world anomalies covering diverse scenarios (e.g.,\nfalling, collision, and being hit). Experiments show the effectiveness of the\nproposed method, surpassing the competitive baseline by +0.96% Recall@1\naccuracy. Notably, our method reveals interpretable alignment between textual\nanomalies and visual behaviors, validated via qualitative analysis. Our code\nand models will be released for future research.",

    "abstract": "As LLMs are increasingly applied in socially impactful settings, concerns\nabout gender bias have prompted growing efforts both to measure and mitigate\nsuch bias. These efforts often rely on evaluation tasks that differ from\nnatural language distributions, as they typically involve carefully constructed\ntask prompts that overtly or covertly signal the presence of gender\nbias-related content. In this paper, we examine how signaling the evaluative\npurpose of a task impacts measured gender bias in LLMs. Concretely, we test\nmodels under prompt conditions that (1) make the testing context salient, and\n(2) make gender-focused content salient. We then assess prompt sensitivity\nacross four task formats with both token-probability and discrete-choice\nmetrics. We find that prompts that more clearly align with (gender bias)\nevaluation framing elicit distinct gender output distributions compared to less\nevaluation-framed prompts. Discrete-choice metrics further tend to amplify bias\nrelative to probabilistic measures. These findings do not only highlight the\nbrittleness of LLM gender bias evaluations but open a new puzzle for the NLP\nbenchmarking and development community: To what extent can well-controlled\ntesting designs trigger LLM \"testing mode\" performance, and what does this mean\nfor the ecological validity of future benchmarks.",

    "abstract": "We study the mass spectrum of nonrelativistic mesons composed of charm and\nbottom quarks within the framework of the Curci-Ferrari model in the Landau\ngauge, focusing on the influence of the gluon mass on our results. We derive\nthe Hamiltonian from the scattering amplitude of a single massive gluon\nexchange. By incorporating a confining Cornell potential we solve the\nSchr\\\"odinger equation for the dominant terms of the Hamiltonian, which include\nthe kinetic energy and a Yukawa-type potential. Corrections to the energy are\nthen introduced perturbatively. By studying the parameter space of the model we\nfit the experimental mass spectrum of charmonium, bottomonium and charm-bottom\nmesons. From the five parameters of our approach, we allow the gluon mass and\nthe gauge coupling to run with the energy scale according to the ultraviolet\none-loop renormalization flows, computed in [1]. Our results show very good\nagreement with the data, suggesting that a nonvanishing gluon mass provides a\nbetter description of the spectrum of heavy mesons than the massless case.",

In the aughts,\nKnutson showed that Frobenius splittings of a certain type descend through\nGr\\\"obner degeneration of a certain type, called geometric vertex\ndecomposition. In the present paper, we give a partial converse to Knutson's\nresult. We show that a Frobenius splitting that compatibly splits both link and\ndeletion of a geometric vertex decomposition can, under an additional\nhypothesis on the form of the splitting, be lifted to a splitting that\ncompatibly splits the original ideal. We discuss an example showing that the\nadditional hypothesis cannot be removed. Our argument uses the relationship\nbetween geometric vertex decomposition and Gorenstein liaison developed by\nKlein and Rajchgot. Additionally, we show that Li's double determinantal\nvarieties defined by maximal minors are Frobenius split.",

    "abstract": "The rapid growth of private car ownership has worsened the urban parking\npredicament, underscoring the need for accurate and effective parking\navailability prediction to support urban planning and management. To address\nkey limitations in modeling spatio-temporal dependencies and exploiting\nmulti-source data for parking availability prediction, this study proposes a\nnovel approach with SST-iTransformer. The methodology leverages K-means\nclustering to establish parking cluster zones (PCZs), extracting and\nintegrating traffic demand characteristics from various transportation modes\n(i.e., metro, bus, online ride-hailing, and taxi) associated with the targeted\nparking lots. Upgraded on vanilla iTransformer, SST-iTransformer integrates\nmasking-reconstruction-based pretext tasks for self-supervised spatio-temporal\nrepresentation learning, and features an innovative dual-branch attention\nmechanism: Series Attention captures long-term temporal dependencies via\npatching operations, while Channel Attention models cross-variate interactions\nthrough inverted dimensions. Extensive experiments using real-world data from\nChengdu, China, demonstrate that SST-iTransformer outperforms baseline deep\nlearning models (including Informer, Autoformer, Crossformer, and\niTransformer), achieving state-of-the-art performance with the lowest mean\nsquared error (MSE) and competitive mean absolute error (MAE). Comprehensive\nablation studies quantitatively reveal the relative importance of different\ndata sources: incorporating ride-hailing data provides the largest performance\ngains, followed by taxi, whereas fixed-route transit features (bus/metro)\ncontribute marginally. Spatial correlation analysis further confirms that\nexcluding historical data from correlated parking lots within PCZs leads to\nsubstantial performance degradation, underscoring the importance of modeling\nspatial dependencies.",

The simulations\nwith MMM have electron energy transport dominated by electron temperature\ngradient modes for relatively low plasma $\\beta$ and high collisionality,\ntransitioning to a mixture of different modes for higher $\\beta$ and lower\ncollisionality. The thermal ion diffusivity predicted by MMM is much smaller\nthan the neoclassical contribution, in line with previous experimental analysis\nof NSTX. Nonetheless, the $T_e$ and $T_i$ profiles are coupled via collisional\nenergy exchange and thus sensitive to which transport channels are predicted.\nThe simulations with MMM are robust to the simulation start time, converging to\nremarkably similar temperatures later during the discharge. MMM typically\noverpredicts confinement relative to NSTX observations, leading to the\nprediction of overly steep profiles. Plasmas with spatially broader $T_e$\nprofiles, higher $\\beta$, and longer energy confinement times tend to be\npredicted by MMM with better agreement with the experiment.

Overall, it\nis found that simulations using the Multi-Mode Model (MMM) more consistently\nagree with the NSTX observations than those using the Trapped Gyro-Landau Fluid\n(TGLF) model, despite TGLF requiring orders of magnitude greater computational\ncost. When considering all examined discharges, MMM has median overpredictions\nof electron temperature ($T_e$) and ion temperature ($T_i$) profiles of 28% and\n27%, respectively, relative to the experiment. TGLF overpredicts $T_e$ by 46%,\nwith much larger variance than MMM, and underpredicts $T_i$ by 25%. As $\\beta$\nis increased across NSTX discharges, TGLF predicts lower $T_e$ and significant\nflattening of the $T_i$ profile, conflicting with NSTX observations. When using\nan electrostatic version of TGLF, both $T_e$ and $T_i$ are substantially\noverpredicted, underscoring the importance of electromagnetic turbulence in the\nhigh $\\beta$ spherical tokamak regime. Additionally, calculations with neural\nnet surrogate models for TGLF were performed outside of TRANSP with a time\nslice flux matching transport solver, finding better agreement with experiment\nthan the TRANSP simulations, highlighting the impact of different transport\nsolvers and simulation techniques. Altogether, the reasonable agreement with\nexperiment of temperature profiles predicted by MMM motivates a more detailed\nexamination of the sensitivities of the TRANSP simulations with MMM to\ndifferent NSTX plasma regimes in a companion paper, in preparation for\nself-consistent, time-dependent predictive modeling of NSTX-U scenarios.",

In coaching\ninteractions, these robots often handle sensitive information shared by users,\nmaking privacy a relevant issue. Despite this, little is known about the\nfactors that shape users' privacy perceptions. This research aims to examine\nthree key factors systematically: (1) the transparency about information usage,\n(2) the level of specific user control over how the robot uses their\ninformation, and (3) the robot's behavioral approach - whether it acts\nproactively or only responds on demand. Our results from an online study (N =\n200) show that even when users grant the robot general access to personal data,\nthey additionally expect the ability to explicitly control how that information\nis interpreted and shared during sessions. Experimental conditions that\nprovided such control received significantly higher ratings for perceived\nprivacy appropriateness and trust. Compared to user control, the effects of\ntransparency and proactivity on privacy appropriateness perception were low,\nand we found no significant impact. The results suggest that merely informing\nusers or proactive sharing is insufficient without accompanying user control.\nThese insights underscore the need for further research on mechanisms that\nallow users to manage robots' information processing and sharing, especially\nwhen social robots take on more proactive roles alongside humans.",

To address these issues, we propose\nPhoneme-Augmented Robust Contextual ASR via COntrastive entity disambiguation\n(PARCO), which integrates phoneme-aware encoding, contrastive entity\ndisambiguation, entity-level supervision, and hierarchical entity filtering.\nThese components enhance phonetic discrimination, ensure complete entity\nretrieval, and reduce false positives under uncertainty. Experiments show that\nPARCO achieves CER of 4.22% on Chinese AISHELL-1 and WER of 11.14% on English\nDATA2 under 1,000 distractors, significantly outperforming baselines. PARCO\nalso demonstrates robust gains on out-of-domain datasets like THCHS-30 and\nLibriSpeech.",

    "abstract": "The notion of $1$-affineness was originally formulated by Gaitsgory in the\ncontext of derived algebraic geometry. Motivated by applications to rigid and\nanalytic geometry, we introduce two very general and abstract frameworks where\nit makes sense to ask for objects to be $1$-affine with respect to some sheaf\nof categories. The first framework is suited for studying the problem of\n$1$-affineness when the sheaf of categories arises from an operation in a\nsix-functor formalism over $\\mathscr{C}$; we apply it to the setting of\nanalytic stacks and condensed mathematics. The second one concerns\n$1$-affineness in the context of quasi-coherent sheaves of categorical modules\nover stable module categories: it simultaneously generalizes the\nalgebro-geometric setting of Gaitsgory and makes it possible to formulate the\nproblem also when dealing with rigid analytic varieties and categories of\nnuclear modules.",

    "abstract": "Spatially-periodic channels are increasingly attracting attention as an\nefficient alternative to packed columns for a number of analytical and\nengineering processes. In incompressible flows, the periodic geometry allows to\ncompute the flow structure by solving the Navier-Stokes (NS) equations in the\nminimal periodic cell of the structure, however large the pressure gradient.\nBesides, when gas flow under large pressure drops are dealt with, the velocity\nfield is not periodic because of the density dependence on pressure. In this\ncase, the momentum balance equations must be solved numerically on the entire\nchannel, thereby requiring massive computational effort. Based on the marked\nseparation of scales between the length of the periodic cell and the overall\nchannel length characterizing many applications we develop a general method for\npredicting both the large-scale pressure and velocity profiles, and the\nsmall-scale flow structure. The approach proposed is based on the assumption\nthat the local dimensionless pressure drop as a function of the Reynolds\nnumber, say $g({\\rm Re})$, can be estimated from the solution of the\nincompressible NS equations within the minimal periodic cell of the channel.\nFrom the knowledge of $g({\\rm Re})$, the pressure profile $P(Z)$ vs the large\nscale axial coordinate $Z$ is derived analytically by quadratures. We show how\nqualitatively different profiles $P(Z)$ can be obtained depending on the\nequation of state the gas. The approach is validated by comparing the predicted\nprofiles with the full-scale numerical solution of the compressible NS\nequations in different axially-symmetric periodic channel geometries.",

However, dense prediction is\ninherently an image-to-image task, suggesting that image editing models, rather\nthan T2I generative models, may be a more suitable foundation for fine-tuning.\n  Motivated by this, we conduct a systematic analysis of the fine-tuning\nbehaviors of both editors and generators for dense geometry estimation. Our\nfindings show that editing models possess inherent structural priors, which\nenable them to converge more stably by ``refining\" their innate features, and\nultimately achieve higher performance than their generative counterparts.\n  Based on these findings, we introduce \\textbf{FE2E}, a framework that\npioneeringly adapts an advanced editing model based on Diffusion Transformer\n(DiT) architecture for dense geometry prediction. Specifically, to tailor the\neditor for this deterministic task, we reformulate the editor's original flow\nmatching loss into the ``consistent velocity\" training objective.

To address these issues, we propose GeoArena, a\nfirst open platform for evaluating LVLMs on worldwide image geolocalization\ntasks, offering true in-the-wild and human-centered benchmarking. GeoArena\nenables users to upload in-the-wild images for a more diverse evaluation\ncorpus, and it leverages pairwise human judgments to determine which model\noutput better aligns with human expectations.

    "abstract": "Consider the $(2+1)$D Discrete Gaussian (ZGFF, integer-valued Gaussian free\nfield) model in an $L\\times L$ box above a hard floor. Bricmont, El-Mellouki\nand Fr\\\"ohlich (1986) established that, at low enough temperature, this random\nsurface exhibits entropic repulsion: the floor propels the average height to be\npoly-logarithmic in $L$. The second author, Martinelli and Sly (2016) showed\nthat, for all but exceptional values of $L$, the surface has a plateau whose\nheight concentrates on an explicit integer $H(L)$, and fills nearly the full\nsquare. It was conjectured there that the boundary of this plateau -- the top\nlevel-line of the surface -- should have random fluctuations of $L^{1/3+o(1)}$.\n  We confirm this conjecture of [LMS16] and further recover the limiting law of\nthe top level-line: there exists an explicit sequence $N=L^{1-o(1)}$ such that\nthe distance of the top level-line from $I$, the interval of length $N^{2/3}$\ncentered along the side boundary, converges, after rescaling it by $N^{1/3}$\nand the width of the interval by $N^{2/3}$, to a Ferrari--Spohn diffusion. In\nparticular, the level-line fluctuations at, say, the center of $I$, have a\nlimit law involving the Airy function rescaled by $N^{1/3}$. This gives the\nfirst example of one of the $(2+1)$D $|\\nabla \\phi|^p$ models (approximating 3D\nIsing and crystal formation) where a Ferrari--Spohn limit law of its\nlevel-lines is confirmed (ZGFF is the case $p=2$).\n  More generally, we find the joint limit law of any finite number of top\nlevel-lines: rescaling their distances from the side boundary, each by its\n$(N_n^{2/3},N_n^{1/3})$, yields a product of Ferrari--Spohn laws. These new\nresults extend to the full universality class of $|\\nabla\\phi|^p$ models for\nany fixed $p>1$.",

By combining Shannon\nEntropy (SE) and Normalized Mutual Information (NMI), we track how vortices\nrestructure plasma-magnetic interactions and channel energy into heat. The\nvortex flow originates in the upper photosphere and extends into the\nchromosphere and upper atmosphere. Relative to a control region dominated by\nshear flows and transient swirls, the coherent vortex shows stronger\nstatistical interdependence between vorticity and other MHD variables. SE shows\nthat vertical magnetic field entropy increases at the vortex onset as magnetic\nflux is redistributed, then decreases as the field becomes ordered. Magnetic\nshear and magnetic energy entropy peak during vortex development, reflecting\ncurrent and energy build-up. In the upper atmosphere, low entropy in\ntemperature and pressure alongside high entropy in density indicates ordered\nthermal and pressure fields but irregular mass distribution, a departure from\nideal-gas behavior confirmed by weakened temperature-density coupling. NMI\nshows that temperature couples to different heating drivers with height:\ncompression and vorticity (viscous heating, since vorticity traces velocity\ngradients) in the lower atmosphere, and vorticity plus magnetic shear in the\nupper atmosphere (viscous and current-driven heating). Although the simulation\ndoes not include explicit physical dissipation, hyperdiffusivity acts on sharp\ngradients and mimics these processes.

FaaSGuard\nsystematically embeds lightweight, fail-closed security checks into every stage\nof the development lifecycle-planning, coding, building, deployment, and\nmonitoring-effectively addressing threats such as injection attacks, hard-coded\nsecrets, and resource exhaustion. We validate our approach empirically through\na case study involving 20 real-world serverless functions from public GitHub\nrepositories. Results indicate that FaaSGuard effectively detects and prevents\ncritical vulnerabilities, demonstrating high precision (95%) and recall (91%)\nwithout significant disruption to established CI/CD practices.",

Firstly,\nexploration is hindered over sharp minima, decreasing learning performance.\nSecondly, the steady gradient descent results in more stable and predictable\nmodel transmissions over wireless channels, making the model more susceptible\nto attacks from adversarial entities. Additionally, the local QFL model is\nvulnerable to noise produced by the quantum device's intermediate noise states,\nsince it requires the use of quantum gates and circuits for training. This\nlocal noise becomes intertwined with learning parameters during training,\nimpairing model precision and convergence rate. To address these issues, we\npropose a new QFL technique that incorporates differential privacy and\nintroduces a dedicated noise estimation strategy to quantify and mitigate the\nimpact of intermediate quantum noise. Furthermore, we design an adaptive noise\ngeneration scheme to alleviate privacy threats associated with the vanishing\ngradient variance phenomenon of QNN and enhance robustness against device\nnoise. Experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm effectively balances\nconvergence, reduces communication costs, and mitigates the adverse effects of\nintermediate quantum noise while maintaining strong privacy protection.

    "abstract": "Recent research on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in Large Language Models\n(LLMs) has demonstrated that agents can engage in \\textit{complex},\n\\textit{multi-turn} negotiations, opening new avenues for agentic AI. However,\nexisting LLM agents largely overlook the functional role of emotions in such\nnegotiations, instead generating passive, preference-driven emotional responses\nthat make them vulnerable to manipulation and strategic exploitation by\nadversarial counterparts. To address this gap, we present EvoEmo, an\nevolutionary reinforcement learning framework that optimizes dynamic emotional\nexpression in negotiations. EvoEmo models emotional state transitions as a\nMarkov Decision Process and employs population-based genetic optimization to\nevolve high-reward emotion policies across diverse negotiation scenarios. We\nfurther propose an evaluation framework with two baselines -- vanilla\nstrategies and fixed-emotion strategies -- for benchmarking emotion-aware\nnegotiation. Extensive experiments and ablation studies show that EvoEmo\nconsistently outperforms both baselines, achieving higher success rates, higher\nefficiency, and increased buyer savings. This findings highlight the importance\nof adaptive emotional expression in enabling more effective LLM agents for\nmulti-turn negotiation.",

Selecting the optimal balance is a critical challenge that can be\nframed as a multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem where one first\ndiscovers the set of optimal trade-offs (the Pareto front) and then learns a\ndecision-maker's preference over them. While a rich body of work on interactive\nMOO exists, the standard approach -- modeling the objective functions with\ngeneric surrogates and learning preferences from simple pairwise feedback -- is\ninefficient for DP because it fails to leverage the problem's unique structure:\na point on the Pareto front can be generated directly by maximizing accuracy\nfor a fixed privacy level. Motivated by this property, we first derive the\nshape of the trade-off theoretically, which allows us to model the Pareto front\ndirectly and efficiently.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in text-driven 3D scene editing and stylization, which\nleverage the powerful capabilities of 2D generative models, have demonstrated\npromising outcomes. However, challenges remain in ensuring high-quality\nstylization and view consistency simultaneously. Moreover, applying style\nconsistently to different regions or objects in the scene with semantic\ncorrespondence is a challenging task. To address these limitations, we\nintroduce techniques that enhance the quality of 3D stylization while\nmaintaining view consistency and providing optional region-controlled style\ntransfer. Our method achieves stylization by re-training an initial 3D\nrepresentation using stylized multi-view 2D images of the source views.\nTherefore, ensuring both style consistency and view consistency of stylized\nmulti-view images is crucial. We achieve this by extending the style-aligned\ndepth-conditioned view generation framework, replacing the fully shared\nattention mechanism with a single reference-based attention-sharing mechanism,\nwhich effectively aligns style across different viewpoints. Additionally,\ninspired by recent 3D inpainting methods, we utilize a grid of multiple depth\nmaps as a single-image reference to further strengthen view consistency among\nstylized images. Finally, we propose Multi-Region Importance-Weighted Sliced\nWasserstein Distance Loss, allowing styles to be applied to distinct image\nregions using segmentation masks from off-the-shelf models. We demonstrate that\nthis optional feature enhances the faithfulness of style transfer and enables\nthe mixing of different styles across distinct regions of the scene.\nExperimental evaluations, both qualitative and quantitative, demonstrate that\nour pipeline effectively improves the results of text-driven 3D stylization.",

The overall\nmorphology of planet--disc interactions has ben shown to be similar in both 2D\nand 3D simulations, however, the ability of a 2D simulation to quantitatively\nmatch 3D results depends strongly on how the potential of the planet is\nhandled. Typically, the 2D planetary potential is smoothed out using some\n`smoothing length', a free parameter, for which different values have been\nproposed, depending on the particular aspect of the interaction focused on. In\nthis paper, we re-derive 2D Navier--Stokes in detail for planet--disc\ninteractions to find better ways to represent the 2D gravitational force. We\nperform a large suite of 2D and 3D simulations to test these force\nprescriptions. We identify the parts of the interaction that are fundamentally\n3D, and test how well our new force prescriptions, as well as traditional\nsmoothed potentials, are able to match 3D simulations. Overall, we find that\nthe optimal way to represent the planetary potential is the `Bessel-type\npotential', but that even in this case 2D simulations are unable to reproduce\nthe correct scaling of the total torque with background gradients, and are at\nbest able match the one-sided Lindblad torque and gap widths to level of 10 per\ncent.

This is often due to\npoorly defined pulse shapes, broadened thermal responses, and the absence of\nclear boundary conditions, especially under significant interfacial temperature\ngradients where natural convection dominates. The classic Parker solution,\nwhile widely used, is physically unrealistic as it assumes adiabatic heat flux\nand shallow-region heat absorption. In this study, we prove that Parker's\nassumption is equivalent to the Dirac pulse boundary condition in mathematics.\nThen, we present comprehensive analytical solutions for thermal/cooling\nresponses under Dirac and rectangular pulse excitations. By comparing with\neigenfunction-based solutions for well-posed boundary conditions, we show that\nParker's solution is only valid before the thermal peak. Through dimensionless\nprocessing, we further demonstrate that Parker's solution can be regarded as a\nlimiting case of the rectangular pulse solution as the heating duration\napproaches zero. Furthermore, we propose a novel excitation approach,\nevaporative cryocooling, for thermal diffusivity measurement. This method\noffers a compact, low-cost, and easy-to-implement alternative to conventional\nexcitation schemes. The theoretical model was further validated through\ncomparison with experimental results.",

    "abstract": "In recent years periodic amplitude modulation has emerged as a unique\nemission feature in the single pulse sequence of pulsars alongside periodic\nnulling and subpulse drifting. Despite ample evidence for the uniqueness of\nthis phenomenon, the periodic modulation in several pulsars are often confused\nwith subpulse drifting, primarily due to lack of clear characterisation of the\nemission features from a representative sample of pulsars. In this work we\npresent a detailed analysis of the single pulse behaviour from seventeen\npulsars exhibiting periodic amplitude modulation, six of them being new\ndetections. The pulsar switches between different intensity states as a result\nof periodic amplitude modulation and we propose a novel statistical scheme to\nidentify these emission states. The periodic modulation can be divided into\nthree broad categories, phase stationary modulation, modulations with phase\nshift and intermittent periodic modulations. The phase stationary behaviour is\nseen when the emission intensity across a major part of the pulse window\nchanges periodically. The phase shifts are associated with intensity changes at\nspecific locations within the emission window in a periodic manner; while in\nsome pulsars the periodic modulations become more prominent only at specific\nintervals resulting in intermittent behaviour.",

This paper addresses these gaps by introducing PyVul,\nthe first comprehensive benchmark suite of Python-package vulnerabilities.\nPyVul includes 1,157 publicly reported, developer-verified vulnerabilities,\neach linked to its affected packages. To accommodate diverse detection\ntechniques, it provides annotations at both commit and function levels. An\nLLM-assisted data cleansing method is incorporated to improve label accuracy,\nachieving 100% commit-level and 94% function-level accuracy, establishing PyVul\nas the most precise large-scale Python vulnerability benchmark. We further\ncarry out a distribution analysis of PyVul, which demonstrates that\nvulnerabilities in Python packages involve multiple programming languages and\nexhibit a wide variety of types. Moreover, our analysis reveals that\nmulti-lingual Python packages are potentially more susceptible to\nvulnerabilities.

However, their deployment on resource-constrained\ndevices remains a challenge due to the large number of layers and parameters,\nwhich result in considerable computational and memory demands. To address this\nissue, pruning and quantization are two widely used compression techniques,\ncommonly applied individually in most studies to reduce model size and enhance\nprocessing speed. Nevertheless, combining these two techniques can yield even\ngreater compression benefits. Effectively integrating pruning and quantization\nto harness their complementary advantages poses a challenging task, primarily\ndue to their potential impact on model accuracy and the complexity of jointly\noptimizing both processes. In this paper, we propose two approaches that\nintegrate similarity-based filter pruning with Adaptive Power-of-Two (APoT)\nquantization to achieve higher compression efficiency while preserving model\naccuracy. In the first approach, pruning and quantization are applied\nsimultaneously during training. In the second approach, pruning is performed\nfirst to remove less important parameters, followed by quantization of the\npruned model using low-bit representations. Experimental results demonstrate\nthat our proposed approaches achieve effective model compression with minimal\naccuracy degradation, making them well-suited for deployment on devices with\nlimited computational resources.",

    "abstract": "This article addresses a fundamental concern, first raised by Efron (2004),\nregarding the selection of null distributions in large-scale multiple testing.\nIn modern data-intensive applications involving thousands or even millions of\nhypotheses, the theoretical null distribution of the test statistics often\ndeviates from the true underlying null distribution, severely compromising the\nfalse discovery rate (FDR) analysis. We propose a conformalized empirical Bayes\nmethod using self-calibrated empirical null samples (SENS) for both one-sample\nand two-sample multiple testing problems. The new framework not only sidesteps\nthe use of potentially erroneous theoretical null distributions, which is\ncommon in conventional practice, but also mitigates the impact of estimation\nerrors in the unknown null distribution on the validity of FDR control, a\nchallenge frequently encountered in the empirical Bayes FDR literature. In\ncontrast to the empirical Bayes approaches (cf. Efron, 2004; Jin and Cai, 2007;\nSun and Cai, 2007) that rely on Gaussian assumptions for the null models, SENS\nimposes only a weak condition on the symmetry of the error distribution, and\nleverages conformal tools to achieve FDR control in finite samples. Moreover,\nSENS incorporates structural insights from empirical Bayes into inference,\nexhibiting higher power compared to frequentist model-free methods. We conduct\nan in-depth analysis to establish a novel optimality theory for SENS under\nEfron's two-group model and demonstrate its superiority over existing empirical\nBayes FDR methods and recent model-free FDR methods through numerical\nexperiments on both simulated and real data.",

We showed that the long-range dependency of SSM\ndecays exponentially with the sequence length, which aligns with the\nexponential decay of memory function in RNN.

This\nenables testing the validity of cosmological models without concrete\nassumptions of their energy content. The main goal of this work is to derive\nmodel-independent constraints on the Hubble parameter up to $z \\sim 0.4$ using\nstellar ages from the fitting of Lick index absorption lines in passively\nevolving galaxies. Contrary to recent related works that rely on finite\ndifferences to obtain a discrete measurement of the expansion of the Universe\nat an average redshift, our goal is to perform a cosmographic fit of $H(z)$ in\nterms of the Hubble constant ($H_0$) and the deceleration ($q_0$) and jerk\n($j_0$) parameters. We carefully select spectra of massive and passively\nevolving galaxies from the SDSS Legacy Survey. After applying a stacking\nprocedure to ensure a high signal-to-noise ratio, the strength of Lick indices\nis fit using two stellar population models (TMJ and Knowles) to derive stellar\npopulation parameters. A cosmographic fit to the stellar ages is performed,\nwhich in turn enables the sampling of the Hubble parameter within the\nconsidered redshift range. The baseline result comes from using the\nTMJ-modelled ages, and it yields a value of $H_0 = 70.0^{+4.1}_{-7.6} \\text{ km\ns}^{-1} \\text{ Mpc}^{-1}$ for the Hubble constant, where uncertainties refer\nonly to the statistical treatment of the data. The sampling of the Hubble\nparameter at $0.05 < z < 0.35$ is competitive with discreet model-independent\nmeasurements from the literature. We finally draw attention to an unexpected\noscillating pattern in a number of critical indices with respect to redshift,\nwhich translates into a similar behaviour in the $t-z$ relations. These\nfeatures have never been discussed before, although they are present in\nprevious measurements.",

Conventional experimental\ntechniques infer thermal responses based on surface emissions, limiting their\nability to fully resolve subsurface structures and internal heat distribution.\nAdditionally, existing thermal tomographic techniques can only shoot one frame\nfrom each layer. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have recently emerged\nas powerful tools for solving inverse problems in heat transfer by integrating\nobservational data with physical constraints.

The\ntime-domain heat diffusion equation was converted to the frequency-domain and\nbecomes the pseudo-Helmholtz equation. HINN embeds this pseudo-Helmholtz\nequation into the learning framework, leveraging both real and imaginary\ncomponents of the thermal field. Finally, an inverse Fourier transform brings\nreal-part and imagery-part back to the time-domain and can be used to map 3D\nthermal fields with interior defects. Furthermore, a truncated operation was\nconducted to improve computational efficiency, and the principle of conjugate\nsymmetry was employed for repairing the discarded data.

    "abstract": "Solo piano music, despite being a single-instrument medium, possesses\nsignificant expressive capabilities, conveying rich semantic information across\ngenres, moods, and styles. However, current general-purpose music\nrepresentation models, predominantly trained on large-scale datasets, often\nstruggle to captures subtle semantic distinctions within homogeneous solo piano\nmusic. Furthermore, existing piano-specific representation models are typically\nunimodal, failing to capture the inherently multimodal nature of piano music,\nexpressed through audio, symbolic, and textual modalities. To address these\nlimitations, we propose PianoBind, a piano-specific multimodal joint embedding\nmodel. We systematically investigate strategies for multi-source training and\nmodality utilization within a joint embedding framework optimized for capturing\nfine-grained semantic distinctions in (1) small-scale and (2) homogeneous piano\ndatasets. Our experimental results demonstrate that PianoBind learns multimodal\nrepresentations that effectively capture subtle nuances of piano music,\nachieving superior text-to-music retrieval performance on in-domain and\nout-of-domain piano datasets compared to general-purpose music joint embedding\nmodels. Moreover, our design choices offer reusable insights for multimodal\nrepresentation learning with homogeneous datasets beyond piano music.",

However, it is well-established that these ML models\nare vulnerable to a number of adversarial attacks throughout the model\ndeployment pipeline that threaten to negate battlefield advantage. One broad\ncategory is privacy attacks (such as model inversion) where an adversary can\nreverse engineer information from the model, such as the sensitive data used in\nits training. The ability to quantify the risk of model inversion attacks\n(MIAs) is not well studied, and there is a lack of automated developmental test\nand evaluation (DT&E) tools and metrics to quantify the effectiveness of\nprivacy loss of the MIA. The current DT&E process is difficult because ML model\ninversions can be hard for a human to interpret, subjective when they are\ninterpretable, and difficult to quantify in terms of inversion quality.\nAdditionally, scaling the DT&E process is challenging due to many ML model\narchitectures and data modalities that need to be assessed. In this work, we\npresent a novel DT&E tool that quantifies the risk of data privacy loss from\nMIAs and introduces four adversarial risk dimensions to quantify privacy loss.\nOur DT&E pipeline combines inversion with vision language models (VLMs) to\nimprove effectiveness while enabling scalable analysis. We demonstrate\neffectiveness using multiple MIA techniques and VLMs configured for zero-shot\nclassification and image captioning. We benchmark the pipeline using several\nstate-of-the-art MIAs in the computer vision domain with an image\nclassification task that is typical in military applications.

Antidots, potential hills in the quantum\nHall regime, are particularly valuable in this context, as they overcome the\ngeometric limitations of conventional designs and act as controlled impurities\nwithin a quantum point contact. Furthermore, antidots allow for quasiparticle\ncharge detection through straightforward conductance measurements, replacing\nthe need for more demanding techniques.

The weighting scheme of a linear pool should be\ntailored to the specific research question, and weight selection is often\nperformed via optimizing a proper scoring rule. This is known as optimal linear\npooling. Besides optimal linear pooling, Bayesian predictive synthesis has\nemerged as a model probability updating scheme which is more flexible than\nstandard Bayesian model averaging and which provides a Bayesian solution to\nselecting model weights for a linear pool. In many problems, equally weighted\nlinear pool forecasts often outperform forecasts constructed using\nsophisticated weight selection methods. Thus regularization to an equal\nweighting of forecasts may be a valuable addition to any weight selection\nmethod. In this manuscript, we introduce an optimal linear pool based on a\nGibbs posterior over stacked model weights optimized over a proper scoring\nrule. The Gibbs posterior extends stacking into a Bayesian framework by\nallowing for optimal weight solutions to be influenced by a prior distribution,\nand it also provides uncertainty quantification of weights in the form of a\nprobability distribution. We compare ensemble forecast performance with model\naveraging methods and equal weighted models in simulation studies and in a real\ndata example from the 2023-24 US Centers for Disease Control FluSight\ncompetition.

    "abstract": "In this thesis we study the subsemigroup structure of the symmetric inverse\nmonoid $I_X$, the inverse semigroup of bijections between subsets of the set\n$X$, when $X$ is an infinite set. We explore three different approaches to this\ntask. First, we classify the maximal subsemigroups of $I_X$ containing certain\nsubgroups of the symmetric group on $X$. The subgroups in question are the\nsymmetric group itself, the pointwise stabiliser of a finite non-empty subset\nof $X$, the stabiliser of an ultrafilter on $X$, and the stabiliser of a finite\npartition of $X$. Next, we study subsemigroups of $I_X$ which are closed in\nsemigroup topologies on $I_X$ introduced by Elliot et al. in 2023. We discover\nthat the closed subsemigroups in these topologies that contain all the\nidempotents of $I_X$ coincide exactly with semigroups of partial endomorphisms\nand partial automorphisms of relational structures defined on $X$. Furthermore,\nwe show that if a relational structure $R$ on a countable set $X$ only contains\na finite number of relations, then there exists a finite subset $U$ of $I_X$\nsuch that the union of the partial automorphisms of $R$ together with $U$\ngenerates all of $I_X$. Finally, we study the subsemigroup structure of $I_X$\nunder a preorder introduced by George Bergman and Saharon Shelah in 2006 for\nthe symmetric group. Extending the preorder to $I_X$, if $S_1$ and $S_2$ are\nsubsemigroups of $I_X$, we say that $S_1 \\preccurlyeq S_2$ if there exists a\nfinite subset $U$ of $I_X$ such that $S_1$ is contained in the semigroup\ngenerated by the union of $S_2$ and $U$. We classify certain types of\nsubsemigroups of $I_X$ according the Bergman-Shelah preorder, and we formulate\na conjecture analogous to the main result by Bergman and Shelah.",

A TPU-SC basically consists of a wide-gap and a\nnarrow-gap semiconductor layer, where intraband absorption of infrared (IR)\nphotons by electrons accumulated at the conduction-band-edge discontinuity\nleads to an increase in the output current and voltage. This IR-induced\nupconversion process enables a better utilization of the broad solar spectrum,\nand quantum dots (QDs) can be added to improve the intraband transition rates\nin actual devices.

    "abstract": "A Markov logic network (MLN) determines a probability distribution on the set\nof structures, or ``possible worlds'', with an arbitrary finite domain. We\nstudy the properties of such distributions as the domain size tends to\ninfinity. Three types of concrete examples of MLNs will be considered, and the\nproperties of random structures with domain sizes tending to infinity will be\nstudied: (1) Arbitrary quantifier-free MLNs over a language with only one\nrelation symbol which has arity 1. In this case we give a pretty complete\ncharacterization of the possible limit behaviours of random structures. (2) An\nMLN that favours graphs with fewer triangles (or more generally, fewer\nk-cliques). As a corollary of the analysis a ``$\\delta$-approximate 0-1 law''\nfor first-order logic is obtained. (3) An MLN that favours graphs with fewer\nvertices with degree higher than a fixed (but arbitrary) number. The analysis\nshows that depending on which ``soft constraints'' an MLN uses the limit\nbehaviour of random structures can be quite different, and the weights of the\nsoft constraints may, or may not, have influence on the limit behaviour. It\nwill also be demonstrated, using (1), that quantifier-free MLNs and lifted\nBayesian networks (in a broad sense) are asymptotically incomparable, roughly\nmeaning that there is a sequence of distributions on possible worlds with\nincreasing domain sizes that can be defined by one of the formalisms but not\neven approximated by the other.

In contrast, $W$ is not very sensitive to $\\delta$\ninitially but becomes very significant in the long run.

To address this, we introduce VisioFirm, an open-source web\napplication designed to streamline image labeling through AI-assisted\nautomation. VisioFirm integrates state-of-the-art foundation models into an\ninterface with a filtering pipeline to reduce human-in-the-loop efforts. This\nhybrid approach employs CLIP combined with pre-trained detectors like\nUltralytics models for common classes and zero-shot models such as Grounding\nDINO for custom labels, generating initial annotations with low-confidence\nthresholding to maximize recall. Through this framework, when tested on\nCOCO-type of classes, initial prediction have been proven to be mostly correct\nthough the users can refine these via interactive tools supporting bounding\nboxes, oriented bounding boxes, and polygons. Additionally, VisioFirm has\non-the-fly segmentation powered by Segment Anything accelerated through WebGPU\nfor browser-side efficiency. The tool supports multiple export formats (YOLO,\nCOCO, Pascal VOC, CSV) and operates offline after model caching, enhancing\naccessibility. VisioFirm demonstrates up to 90\\% reduction in manual effort\nthrough benchmarks on diverse datasets, while maintaining high annotation\naccuracy via clustering of connected CLIP-based disambiguate components and\nIoU-graph for redundant detection suppression.

A simulation tool based on JPL's\nMONTE library was developed to identify valid occultation events, applying\ngeometric and illumination constraints to exclude non-observable cases.

The covariance analysis shows that\noccultation observables reduce the transverse and normal position uncertainties\nof LUMIO by up to a factor of two, especially during tracking gaps or\noccultation-rich arcs. This uncertainty reduction is expected to facilitate\nstation-keeping operations and constrain the surface localization of Lunar\nImpact Flashes (LIFs), enhancing the mission's scientific return. Sensitivity\nanalyses confirm that the orbit determination performance is primarily driven\nby the timing accuracy of occultation events, with limited dependence on lunar\nshape uncertainty below 100 m.

Viewed mainly as a source of performance degradation, recent\ntheoretical insights reveal that local disorder profoundly influences the\nelectronic structure and phonon dynamics, without inducing deep electronic\ntraps or non-radiative recombination pathways. In this work, we highlight\nadvances in modeling local disorder using polymorphous and anharmonic\nframeworks, showing how these methods explain experimental observations and\npredict new trends. We emphasize the role of disorder in the breakdown of the\nphonon quasiparticle picture and in modulating electron-phonon and\nphonon-phonon interactions, particularly in soft, anharmonic phases of matter,\nwith significant effects on electrical and thermal transport. We outline\nopportunities for integrating these insights into predictive modeling for\nenergy materials and propose combining advanced first-principles methods with\nmachine learning.",

    "abstract": "Reliable transmission of quantum optical states through real-world\nenvironments is key for quantum communication and imaging. Yet, aberrations and\nscattering in the propagation path can scramble the transmitted signal and\nhinder its use. A typical strategy is to employ a classical beacon beam to\nlearn and then correct for the wavefront distortions. However, relying on a\nseparate light source increases the overhead in the experimental apparatus.\nMoreover, the beacon light must closely match the non-classical state in\npolarization, wavelength, and even temporal bandwidth, which is highly\nchallenging in practice. Here, we introduce a fast and efficient wavefront\ncorrection approach where we use the quantum state itself to correct for\noptical distortion. Via pump shaping, we control the degree of entanglement in\nthe spatially-entangled two-photon state so that it behaves either as a\nhigh-dimensional entangled state or as a classical coherent state. The latter\ncase is used to efficiently measure the transmission matrix of the propagation\nchannel and correct its distortions with a spatial light modulator, thereby\nenabling the transmission of the high-dimensional entangled state with minimal\nerrors. Our approach paves the way for the practical implementation of quantum\nimaging and communication protocols based on high-dimensional spatially\nentangled states.",

Using mean-field and\neffective-field theory, in combination with kinetic Monte Carlo simulations (3D\nGlauber dynamics), we identify a nonequilibrium tricritical (Bautin) point\nseparating Hopf-type transitions (continuous) from saddle-node-of-limit-cycle\n(SNLC) transitions (discontinuous). For a weak random field which is less than\na critical value, the onset of collective oscillations (the \"swap\" phase)\noccurs via a supercritical Hopf bifurcation, whereas for fields greater than\nthe critical value, the transition is first-order (SNLC), exhibiting hysteresis\nand Binder-cumulant signatures. The finite-size scaling of the susceptibility\nis consistent with the distinct critical and discontinuous behaviour shown in\nthe Hopf and SNLC regimes, respectively (effective exponents $\\approx1.96$ in\nthe Hopf regime and $\\approx3.0$ in the SNLC regime). Additionally, in the\nfirst-order regime, the swap phase is sustained only above a threshold\nnonreciprocity, and this threshold increases monotonically with the disorder\nstrength. We further identify a new droplet-induced swap phase in the larger\nfield-strength region, which cycles eight different metastable states. A\ndynamical free-energy picture rationalises droplet nucleation as the mechanism\nfor these cyclic jumps.

To prepare a concentration\nseries, I diluted tomato juice with tap water to yield seven samples (0, 2.5,\n5, 10, 25, 50, and 100%). Transmission spectra for each sample were recorded by\npassing light from a halogen lamp through a 1 cm cuvette and measuring the\ntransmitted intensity with a spectrometer covering the visible region. The raw\nspectra revealed clear attenuation in the 480-520 nm region, consistent with\nthe absorption band of lycopene. By converting the data to absorbance and\nplotting against concentration, I observed a linear relationship in the dilute\nregion, confirming the Beer-Lambert law.

Rather than comparing queries and keys directly, we model\nthe input sequence as discrete observations of a linear stochastic differential\nequation (SDE). By imposing a linear dynamics model with simultaneously\ndiagonalizable state matrices and noise covariances, we can make use of a\nclosed-form solution to the differential Lyapunov equation to efficiently\npropagate pairwise uncertainties through the dynamics. Attention naturally\narises as the maximum likelihood solution for this linear SDE, with attention\nweights corresponding to robust residual-based reweightings of the propagated\npairwise precisions. Imposing an additional constraint on the state matrix's\neigenvalues leads to a simplified variant with the same computational and\nmemory complexity as standard attention. In the limit of vanishing dynamics and\nprocess noise, and using a small-angle approximation, we recover ordinary\ndot-product attention.",

With circulation, the Bragg scattered\nmechanical side modes split, yielding a double transparency dispersion with\nsteep dispersive flanks that strongly amplify the phase derivative and bias its\nsign. In this regime, the peak shift grows monotonically with control field\nstrength, reflecting enhanced linearized coupling and increased transmission\nacross the angular scan. At fixed power, the detuning dependence is decisive:\nthe shift is maximized at the red sideband condition and diminishes away from\nresonance, tracking how effectively the scan samples the rotation split\ndispersive flanks. Increasing the winding number broadens the central\nabsorption and steepens accessible phase gradients, further boosting the\nattainable shift. The protocol remains minimally invasive under experimentally\nrealistic conditions, and interatomic interactions have a negligible influence\non the transmission features that set the phase slope.

Therefore, the avatars generated by these\nmethods suffer from lower rendering quality compared to person-specific\nrendering methods and fail to capture pose-dependent deformations such as cloth\nwrinkles. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that unites the strengths\nof person-specific rendering and diffusion-based generative modeling to enable\ndynamic human avatar generation with both high photorealism and realistic\npose-dependent deformations.

This functions by avoiding checking a partner's\nactions once a threshold level of cooperativeness has been observed. We\nconsider trust-based strategies that implement this heuristic, and\nsystematically analyse their evolution across the space of two-player symmetric\nsocial dilemma games. We find that where it is costly to check whether another\nagent's actions were cooperative, as is the case in many real-world settings,\nthen trust-based strategies can outcompete standard reciprocal strategies such\nas Tit-for-Tat in many social dilemmas. Moreover, the presence of trust\nincreases the overall level of cooperation in the population, especially in\ncases where agents can make unintentional errors in their actions. This occurs\neven in the presence of strategies designed to build and then exploit trust.\nOverall, our results demonstrate the individual adaptive benefit to an agent of\nusing a trust heuristic, and provide a formal theory for how trust can promote\ncooperation in different types of social interaction.

In this approach, the biased\ndensity fluctuation is built solely from Galileon-type operators associated\nwith the intrinsic nonlinear growth of dark matter. This ensures the bias\nexpansion is well defined at the field level, automatically satisfies\nstatistical conditions of vanishing ensemble and volume averages, and removes\nthe need for ad hoc renormalization. We derive analytic one-loop expressions\nfor the galaxy-galaxy and galaxy-matter power spectra and implement an\nefficient numerical algorithm using \\texttt{FFTLog} and \\texttt{FAST-PT},\nenabling rapid and accurate evaluation. The model requires only a minimal set\nof bias parameters: three parameters are sufficient to describe correlation\nfunctions in configuration space, while four parameters are needed for power\nspectra in Fourier space. To test accuracy, we jointly fit halo auto- and\ncross-spectra from the \\textit{Dark Emulator}, covering nine redshift-mass\ncombinations with 100 cosmologies each. A single set of bias parameters\nreproduces both spectra within $\\sim1\\%$ up to $k \\simeq\n0.3\\,h\\,\\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ for typical linear bias $b_1 \\sim 0.8$-2, and to $k\n\\simeq 0.2\\,h\\,\\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ for $b_1 \\sim 3$.

    "abstract": "Kitaev magnets have emerged as pivotal systems for investigating frustrated\nmagnetism, providing a unique platform to explore quantum phases governed by\nthe interplay between bond-dependent anisotropy and external magnetic fields.\nHowever, the quantum phase diagrams, particularly near the dominant\nantiferromagnetic Kitaev regime, remain puzzling despite extensive studies. In\nthis work, we perform unbiased exact diagonalization calculations of the\nKitaev-$\\Gamma$ model in a [111] magnetic field on a $C_{6}$-symmetric 24-site\ncluster. By calculating the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ flux density and the topological\nentanglement entropy, we reveal multiple phase transitions and identify\nsignatures of both scalar and vector chiral orders in the intermediate-field\nregime between the Kitaev spin liquid and the polarized phase. As the negative\n$\\Gamma$ interaction increases, we discover a proximate quantum spin liquid\nfeatured by a three-peak specific heat and a spin-flop phase at a moderate\nmagnetic field. Our findings provide insight into the field-induced\nintermediate phases in the antiferromagnetic Kitaev model and pave the way for\nthe hunt for emergent phases in real materials.",

In practical implementations, QKD systems\noften rely on a layered architecture where a key manager stores secret key\nmaterial in a buffer and delivers it to higher communication layers as needed.\nHowever, this buffer can be depleted under high demand, requiring efficient\nreplenishment strategies that minimize resource waste. Given the importance of\noptimizing time and resources in quantum cryptography protocols, we introduce a\nvariable-length adaptation of the BB84 protocol designed to meet user-defined\noutput key length constraints in non-ideal scenarios.

    "abstract": "The shape of biological shells, such as cell nuclei, membranes, and vesicles,\noften deviates from a perfect sphere due to an interplay of complex\ninteractions with a myriad of molecular structures. In particular, semiflexible\nbiopolymers adsorbed to the surfaces of such shells seem to affect their\nmorphological properties. While the effect of a single, long, semiflexible\nchain is relatively well characterized, the mechanisms by which a high density\nof such surface-adsorbed polymers can alter the morphology of a spherical, soft\nconfinement, akin to biological shells, remain relatively poorly understood.\nHere, we use coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations to investigate how\nsurface adsorption of many semiflexible polymers affects the morphology of a\npressurized bead-spring shell, which is spherical in the absence of these\nchains. By varying the attraction strength between the chains and the shell\nsurface, chain concentration, and the polymerization degree of chains, we\ndemonstrate that strong surface localization of the chains can induce severe\nshape distortions and shrinkage, depending on the chain length and\nconcentration. Conversely, weak localization does not induce significant shape\nfluctuations, yet nematically ordered phases appear on the surface. Notably,\nthese ordered phases lead to elliptic shell shapes for chains with sizes\ncomparable to or longer than the radius of the confinement when the elastic\nshell is composed of extensible, harmonic bonds. Overall, our findings offer a\nstrategy to control the shape of synthetic shells by manipulating peripheral\nlocalization and length of semiflexible polymers while suggesting a mechanism\nfor non-spherical shapes appearing in some biological systems.",

    "abstract": "Text-to-image diffusion models have achieved remarkable image quality, but\nthey still struggle with complex, multiele ment prompts, and limited stylistic\ndiversity. To address these limitations, we propose a Multi-Expert Planning and\nGen eration Framework (MEPG) that synergistically integrates position- and\nstyle-aware large language models (LLMs) with spatial-semantic expert modules.\nThe framework comprises two core components: (1) a Position-Style-Aware (PSA)\nmodule that utilizes a supervised fine-tuned LLM to decom pose input prompts\ninto precise spatial coordinates and style encoded semantic instructions; and\n(2) a Multi-Expert Dif fusion (MED) module that implements cross-region genera\ntion through dynamic expert routing across both local regions and global areas.\nDuring the generation process for each lo cal region, specialized models (e.g.,\nrealism experts, styliza tion specialists) are selectively activated for each\nspatial par tition via attention-based gating mechanisms. The architec ture\nsupports lightweight integration and replacement of ex pert models, providing\nstrong extensibility. Additionally, an interactive interface enables real-time\nspatial layout editing and per-region style selection from a portfolio of\nexperts. Ex periments show that MEPG significantly outperforms base line models\nwith the same backbone in both image quality\n  and style diversity.",

To ensure the stability,\nparticularly in the presence of convection-dominated regimes and the\nutilization of equal-order element pairs, we introduce local projections based\nstabilization techniques. We demonstrate the discrete inf-sup condition in the\nenergy norm. Moreover, the stability of the proposed method also guarantees the\nstability properties for the Brinkman equation and the Stokes equation without\nintroducing any additional conditions. Furthermore, we derive an optimal error\nestimates in the energy norm that underline the uniform convergence in the\nenergy norm for the generalized Oseen problem with small diffusion. In\naddition, the error estimates remain valid and uniform for the Brinkman\nequation and the Stokes equation. Additionally, the convergence study shows\nthat the proposed method is quasi-robust with respect to parameters. The\nproposed method offers several advantages, including simplicity in\nconstruction, easier implementation compared to residual-based stabilization\ntechniques, and avoiding coupling between element pairs. We validate our\ntheoretical findings through a series of numerical experiments, including\ndiffusion-dominated and convection-dominated regimes.",

Around the critical point of a stochastic\nrecurrent excitable network, we uncover a synergistic dual-coding scheme,\nenabled by single-cell threshold adaptation. This scheme optimizes variance\ncoding for weak signals without compromising rate coding for stronger inputs,\nthus maximizing input/output mutual information.

This paper presents a\nlow-cost and low-power impact detection system based on multiple wireless\nsensor nodes measuring 3D accelerations. These were deployed in a measurement\ncampaign covering realworld operational scenarios. An algorithm was developed,\nbased on this collected data, to differentiate high-impact events from normal\nusage and to localize detected collisions on the forklift.

    "abstract": "Cloud robotics has emerged as a promising technology for robotics\napplications due to its advantages of offloading computationally intensive\ntasks, facilitating data sharing, and enhancing robot coordination. However,\nintegrating cloud computing with robotics remains a complex challenge due to\nnetwork latency, security concerns, and the need for efficient resource\nmanagement. In this work, we present a scalable and intuitive framework for\ntesting cloud and edge robotic systems. The framework consists of two main\ncomponents enabled by containerized technology: (a) a containerized cloud\ncluster and (b) the containerized robot simulation environment. The system\nincorporates two endpoints of a User Datagram Protocol (UDP) tunnel, enabling\nbidirectional communication between the cloud cluster container and the robot\nsimulation environment, while simulating realistic network conditions. To\nachieve this, we consider the use case of cloud-assisted remote control for\naerial robots, while utilizing Linux-based traffic control to introduce\nartificial delay and jitter, replicating variable network conditions\nencountered in practical cloud-robot deployments.",

Identifying paths that reveal the most unknown areas of\nthe object becomes paramount in this context, as it directly affects\nefficiency, and this problem is known as the view path planning problem.\nCurrent methods often use sampling-based path planning techniques, evaluating\npotential views along the path to enhance reconstruction performance. However,\nthese methods are computationally expensive as they require evaluating several\ncandidate views on the path. To this end, we propose a computationally\nefficient solution that relies on calculating a focus point in the most\ninformative (unknown) region and having the robot maintain this point in the\ncamera field of view along the path. We incorporated this strategy into the\nwhole-body control of a mobile manipulator employing a visibility constraint\nwithout the need for an additional path planner. We conducted comprehensive and\nrealistic simulations using a large dataset of 114 diverse objects of varying\nsizes from 57 categories to compare our method with a sampling-based planning\nstrategy using Bayesian data analysis. Furthermore, we performed real-world\nexperiments with an 8-DoF mobile manipulator to demonstrate the proposed\nmethod's performance in practice. Our results suggest that there is no\nsignificant difference in object coverage and entropy.

Here, we employ megahertz X-ray\nphoton correlation spectroscopy (MHz-XPCS) at the European XFEL to probe the\ndynamics of the protein ferritin in solutions containing sucrose, dextran, and\nFicoll.

    "abstract": "Suppression effects of giant radio lobes from supermassive black holes on gas\naccretion onto galaxies in the surrounding regions are quantified using\ncosmological magneto-hydrodynamic simulations. With an appropriate amount of\nradio jet energy injected into the intergalactic medium following the formation\npeak of supermassive black holes at redshift two, we find that galaxies in the\ngreater neighborhood of the jet-launching massive galaxies subsequently\nexperience a significant reduction in the amount of accreted gas. The\ndistribution of the resulting magnetic field in the intergalactic medium is\nhighly inhomogeneous, due to the highly biased nature of the most massive\nsupermassive black holes. In regions with magnetic field strength\n$B>10^{-2}\\mu$G, the baryon fraction is on average reduced by 17%, 14%, and\n12%, respectively, for halos of mass in the range of $[10^{11}-10^{12})\\msun$,\n$[10^{12}-10^{13})\\msun$, and $[10^{13}-10^{14})\\msun$.

The rapid adoption of Industrial\nInternet of Things (IIoT) technologies has expanded system functionality but\nalso increased the attack surface, exposing ICSs to a growing range of cyber\nthreats. Honeypots provide a means to detect and analyze such threats by\nemulating target systems and capturing attacker behavior.

Our approach integrates physical PLCs interacting with live\ndata sources via industrial protocols such as Modbus and Profinet RTU, along\nwith virtualized network components including routers, switches, and Remote\nTerminal Units (RTUs). The system incorporates comprehensive monitoring\ncapabilities to collect detailed logs of attacker interactions.

The surface dilation\nrequires zero overburden pressure (exposure to vacuum) and is precipitated by\nthe passing of waves traveling barely above the sound speed (> Mach 1.05). We\nsimulate this phenomenon using open source Soft Sphere Discrete Element Method\n(SSDEM) software. We prepare channels of monodisperse, cohesive spherical\nparticles exposed to vacuum and modeled as Hertzian springs. We validate our\nmodel by recreating acoustic wave, strong shock, and shear dilation behavior.\nWe then create shocks within the channel to determine the sensitivity of\nsurface dilation to wave speed, wave type, initial packing fraction, and\nboundary effects. The shocks we create undergo a rapid decay in strength and\nappear to propagate as solitary waves that can be sustained across the channel.\nWe find that an inertial surface dilation is induced by compressive solitary\nwaves, is insensitive to channel length, increases with bed height, and\nincreases substantially with initial packing fraction. A hard subsurface floor\nis required to maintain this wave over the entire channel.

This \"ZTF SN Ia DR2\" sample\nis the largest SN Ia dataset to date.\n  Fully exploiting this dataset to improve understanding of the properties of\ndark energy requires a photometric accuracy of O(0.1%). This can be achieved\nusing Scene Modeling Photometry (SMP), which is optimal to extract a transient\nsignal (SN) from a complex background (its host), while ensuring a common flux\nestimator with nearby stars used as calibration reference. In this paper, we\npresent the status of the SMP development and use it to assess the precision\nand accuracy of the ZTF SN Ia DR2 force photometry light curves.\n  We reach a repeatability of the star observations better than 1%. However, we\nhave identified a new sensor effect, dubbed \"pocket-effect\", which distorts the\nPoint Spread Function (PSF) in a flux-dependent manner leading to\nnon-linearities in the photometry of a few percent. Correcting for this effect\nrequires time- and sensor-dependent corrections to be applied at the pixel\nlevel, which is currently under development. This effects affects all light\ncurve releases to date -- both from forced photometry and scene modelling\npreventing ZTF SN Ia DR2 to be used for accurate cosmological inference.\n  Comparing the SMP and forced photometry measurements, we find that stretch\nand color estimated from both processings are consistent, aside from a 10 mmag\nshift in color.

    "abstract": "This paper proposes an exploration-efficient Deep Reinforcement Learning with\nReference policy (DRLR) framework for learning robotics tasks that incorporates\ndemonstrations. The DRLR framework is developed based on an algorithm called\nImitation Bootstrapped Reinforcement Learning (IBRL). We propose to improve\nIBRL by modifying the action selection module. The proposed action selection\nmodule provides a calibrated Q-value, which mitigates the bootstrapping error\nthat otherwise leads to inefficient exploration. Furthermore, to prevent the RL\npolicy from converging to a sub-optimal policy, SAC is used as the RL policy\ninstead of TD3. The effectiveness of our method in mitigating bootstrapping\nerror and preventing overfitting is empirically validated by learning two\nrobotics tasks: bucket loading and open drawer, which require extensive\ninteractions with the environment. Simulation results also demonstrate the\nrobustness of the DRLR framework across tasks with both low and high\nstate-action dimensions, and varying demonstration qualities. To evaluate the\ndeveloped framework on a real-world industrial robotics task, the bucket\nloading task is deployed on a real wheel loader.

Yet,\nwhile many implementations of physical neural networks exploiting attractor\ndynamics have been studied, implementations of oscillatory models in\nanalog-electronic hardware that utilize the networks' transient dynamics so far\nare lacking. This study explores the feasibility of implementing HORNs in\nanalog-electronic hardware while maintaining the computational performance of\nthe digital counterpart. Using a digital twin approach, we trained a four-node\nHORN in silico for sequential MNIST classification and transferred the trained\nparameters to an analog electronic implementation. A set of custom error\nmetrics indicated that the analog system is able to successfully replicate the\ndynamics of the digital model in most test cases. However, despite the overall\nwell-matching dynamics, when using the readout layer of the digital model on\nthe data generated by the analog system, we only observed $28.39\\%$ agreement\nwith the predictions of the digital model. An analysis shows that this mismatch\nis due to a precision difference between the analog hardware and the\nfloating-point representation exploited by the digital model to perform\nclassification tasks. When the analog system was utilized as a reservoir with a\nre-trained linear readout, its classification performance could be recovered to\nthat of the digital twin, indicating preserved information content within the\nanalog dynamics.

The goal of\nthis task is to produce a novel motion respecting both the motion content and\nthe desired motion style, e.g., ``walking in a loop like a Monkey''. Existing\nresearch attempts to address this problem via motion style transfer or\nconditional motion generation. They typically embed the motion style into a\nlatent space and guide the motion implicitly in a latent space as well. Despite\nthe progress, their methods suffer from low interpretability and control,\nlimited generalization to new styles, and fail to produce motions other than\n``walking'' due to the strong bias in the public stylization dataset. In this\npaper, we propose to solve the stylized motion generation problem from a new\nperspective of reasoning-composition-generation, based on our observations: i)\nhuman motion can often be effectively described using natural language in a\nbody-part centric manner, ii) LLMs exhibit a strong ability to understand and\nreason about human motion, and iii) human motion has an inherently\ncompositional nature, facilitating the new motion content or style generation\nvia effective recomposing. We thus propose utilizing body-part text space as an\nintermediate representation, and present SMooGPT, a fine-tuned LLM, acting as a\nreasoner, composer, and generator when generating the desired stylized motion.\nOur method executes in the body-part text space with much higher\ninterpretability, enabling fine-grained motion control, effectively resolving\npotential conflicts between motion content and style, and generalizes well to\nnew styles thanks to the open-vocabulary ability of LLMs. Comprehensive\nexperiments and evaluations, and a user perceptual study, demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our approach, especially under the pure text-driven stylized\nmotion generation.",

In recent years, the advent of\nmetamaterials-rationally designed composites with properties beyond their\nconstituents, often not found in conventional materials-has provided exciting\nopportunities for rethinking and redesigning fluid-structure interaction. The\npremise of engineering the internal structure of materials interfacing with\nfluid flows is opening a new horizon for precise and effective manipulation and\ncontrol of coupled fluidic, acoustic, and elastodynamics responses. This review\nfocuses on this relatively unexplored interdisciplinary theme with broad\nreal-world technological significance. Key performance metrics, such as fuel\nconsumption of transport systems, efficiency of renewable energy extraction,\nmitigation of noise emissions, and resilience to structural fatigue, depend on\nthe control of interactions between flow, acoustic, and vibration mechanisms.\nFlow control, for example, which spans a wealth of regimes such as laminar,\ntransitional, turbulent, and unsteady separated flows, is highly influenced by\nthe ability to tailor fluid-structure interaction behavior. We survey and\ndiscuss theoretical frameworks that describe the interplay between fluids and\nelastic solids, with a focus on contemporary work and emerging concepts. The\npaper is organised into three main sections-flow-structure interactions,\nacoustic-structure interactions, and exotic metamaterial concepts with\npotential impact on fluid-structure interaction-and concludes with perspectives\non current challenges and future directions in this rapidly expanding area of\nresearch.",

However, sensing and communications (S&C) impose conflicting\nrequirements on the modulation format, resulting in a tradeoff between their\ncorresponding performance. This paper investigates constellation shaping as a\nmeans to simultaneously improve S&C performance in orthogonal frequency\ndivision multiplexing (OFDM)-based ISAC systems. We begin by deriving how the\ntransmit symbols affect detection performance and derive theoretical lower and\nupper bounds on the maximum achievable information rate under a given sensing\nconstraint. Using an autoencoder-based optimization, we investigate geometric,\nprobabilistic, and joint constellation shaping, where joint shaping combines\nboth approaches, employing both optimal maximum a-posteriori decoding and\npractical bit-metric decoding. Our results show that constellation shaping\nenables a flexible trade-off between S&C, can approach the derived upper bound,\nand significantly outperforms conventional modulation formats. Motivated by its\npractical implementation feasibility, we review probabilistic amplitude shaping\n(PAS) and propose a generalization tailored to ISAC. For this generalization,\nwe propose a low-complexity log-likelihood ratio computation with negligible\nrate loss. We demonstrate that combining conventional and generalized PAS\nenables a flexible and low-complexity tradeoff between S&C, closely approaching\nthe performance of joint constellation shaping.",

Previous\nstudies have mainly focused on features from single-view images, which can\ncause view bias and issues like pose variation, viewpoint changes, and\nocclusions. Using multi-view features to present a person can help reduce view\nbias. In this work, we present an efficient re-ranking method that generates\nmulti-view features by aggregating neighbors' features using K-nearest Weighted\nFusion (KWF) method. Specifically, we hypothesize that features extracted from\nre-identification models are highly similar when representing the same\nidentity. Thus, we select K neighboring features in an unsupervised manner to\ngenerate multi-view features. Additionally, this study explores the weight\nselection strategies during feature aggregation, allowing us to identify an\neffective strategy.

Most of the existing\napproaches model BSSRDF either through an analysis-by-synthesis approach,\napproximating complex path integrals, or using differentiable volume rendering\ntechniques to account for heterogeneity. However, only a few studies have\napplied learning-based methods to estimate subsurface scattering parameters,\nbut they assume homogeneous media. Interestingly, no specific distribution is\nknown to us that can explicitly model the heterogeneous scattering parameters\nin the real world. Notably, procedural noise models such as Perlin and Fractal\nPerlin noise have been effective in representing intricate heterogeneities of\nnatural, organic, and inorganic surfaces. Leveraging this, we first create\nHeteroSynth, a synthetic dataset comprising photorealistic images of\nheterogeneous media whose scattering parameters are modeled using Fractal\nPerlin noise. Furthermore, we propose Tensorial Inverse Scattering (TensoIS), a\nlearning-based feed-forward framework to estimate these Perlin-distributed\nheterogeneous scattering parameters from sparse multi-view image observations.\nInstead of directly predicting the 3D scattering parameter volume, TensoIS uses\nlearnable low-rank tensor components to represent the scattering volume. We\nevaluate TensoIS on unseen heterogeneous variations over shapes from the\nHeteroSynth test set, smoke and cloud geometries obtained from open-source\nrealistic volumetric simulations, and some real-world samples to establish its\neffectiveness for inverse scattering.

To address this issue, this study proposes a\nheterogeneous computing architecture based on Phytium processors and Cambricon\naccelerator cards, constructing a UAV tracking and gazing system with\nmillisecond-level response capability. At the hardware level, the system adopts\na collaborative computing architecture of Phytium FT-2000/4 processors and\nMLU220 accelerator cards, enhancing computing power through multi-card\nparallelism. At the software level, it innovatively integrates a lightweight\nYOLOv5s detection network with a DeepSORT cascaded tracking algorithm, forming\na closed-loop control chain of \"detection-tracking-feedback\". Experimental\nresults demonstrate that the system achieves a stable single-frame\ncomprehensive processing delay of 50-100 ms in 1920*1080 resolution video\nstream processing, with a multi-scale target recognition accuracy of over\n98.5%, featuring both low latency and high precision.

Herein, for the first time, we present physically interpretable\nmodels for predicting two key performance metrics, gravimetric hydrogen density\n$w$ and equilibrium pressure $P_{\\rm eq,RT}$ at room temperature, based on a\nminimal set of chemically meaningful descriptors. Using a rigorously curated\ndataset of $5,089$ metal hydride compositions from our recently developed\nDigital Hydrogen Platform (\\it{DigHyd}) based on large-scale data mining from\navailable experimental literature of solid-state hydrogen storage materials, we\nsystematically constructed over $1.6$ million candidate models using\ncombinations of scalar transformations and nonlinear link functions. The final\nclosed-form models, derived from $2$-$3$ descriptors each, achieve predictive\naccuracies on par with state-of-the-art machine learning methods, while\nmaintaining full physical transparency. Strikingly, descriptor-based design\nmaps generated from these models reveal a fundamental trade-off between $w$ and\n$P_{\\rm eq,RT}$: saline-type hydrides, composed of light electropositive\nelements, offer high $w$ but low $P_{\\rm eq,RT}$, whereas interstitial-type\nhydrides based on heavier electronegative transition metals show the opposite\ntrend. Notably, Be-based systems, such as Be-Na alloys, emerge as rare\ncandidates that simultaneously satisfy both performance metrics, attributed to\nthe unique combination of light mass and high molar density for Be. Our models\nindicate that Be-based systems may offer renewed prospects for approaching\nthese benchmarks.

Validation against current\nmodels of Jupiter's atmosphere as well as recent observational data shows that\nour model successfully describes Jupiter's main observed chemical features.\nSince one of the focuses of the model is the chemistry on nitrogen, it\ncorrectly predicts the formation of a mixed NH3-NH4SH cloud layer between 0.1\nand 1 bar.

    "abstract": "As quantum computing hardware advances, the limitations of single-chip\narchitectures, particularly in terms of small qubit count, have sparked growing\ninterest in modular quantum computing systems and Quantum Data Centers (QDCs).\nThese architectures interconnect multiple quantum processor units (QPUs) to\novercome physical constraints and support complex quantum algorithms. However,\nthe implementation of distributed quantum computing (DQC) faces significant\ntechnical challenges, especially in the execution of remote gates. Moreover, no\npractical emulation tool currently exists to evaluate theoretical proposals of\nvarious DQC systems. In this work, we propose a framework that emulates a DQC\nsystem using a single quantum processor. We partition the physical qubit\ncoupling map of an existing QPU into multiple logical QPUs, and introduce an\nexperimentally grounded noise model based on quantum collision dynamics to\nquantify the interconnect-induced noise, representing fiber-connected QPUs. The\nframework is validated using IBM's quantum hardware, demonstrating the\nsuccessful execution of remote gates under noisy conditions. Furthermore, we\nimplement distributed versions of Grover's search and the Quantum Fourier\nTransform (QFT), showing that complex circuits can be executed within the\nproposed framework with reasonable fidelity across interconnected QPUs. The\nemulation result of Grover's algorithm aligns with the real-world experimental\nimplementations between two Ion-trapped QPUs interconnected by optical fiber,\nwhich demonstrate the feasibility and accuracy of our framework. Overall, this\nwork provides a versatile emulation tool for investigating QDC behavior while\naccounting for interconnect-induced communication noise and offers a practical\nmethod for validating distributed quantum protocols without requiring\nspecialized interconnect hardware.",

Gravitational wave\nobservations have recently emerged as a powerful tool to test the existence and\nproperties of PBHs, as these objects leave distinctive imprints on the\ngravitational waveform. Notably, there are no known astrophysical processes\nthat can form sub-solar mass black holes, making their discovery a compelling\nsignal of new physics. In addition to PBHs, we consider other exotic compact\nobject (ECO) candidates-such as strange quark stars and boson stars-which can\nproduce similar gravitational signatures and potentially mimic PBHs. In this\nwork, we employ the Fisher matrix formalism to explore a broad parameter space,\nincluding binary masses, spins, and a variety of nuclear and quark matter\nequations of state. Our goal is to assess the ability of next-generation\ngravitational wave detectors-specifically Cosmic Explorer and the Einstein\nTelescope-to distinguish PBHs from ECOs, stellar BHs and neutron stars. We\ncompute the maximum luminosity distances at which confident ($\\geq 3\\sigma$)\ndetections of sub-solar masses or tidal effects are possible, providing\nquantitative benchmarks for PBH identification or exclusion under various\nobservational scenarios. Our results indicate that next-generation detectors\nwill be capable of probing sub-solar mass PBHs out to cosmological distances of\n$z \\sim 3$.

This problem is valuable in a variety of applications,\nincluding pathology image segmentation, political voting prediction, customer\nsentiment analysis, and environmental monitoring.

The pose\nestimator is a critical component of wall climbing mobile robots, as their\noperational environment involves carrying precise measurement equipment and\nmaintenance tools in construction, requiring information about pose on the\nbuilding at the time of measurement. Due to the complex geometry and material\nproperties of building facades, the use of traditional localization sensors\nsuch as laser, ultrasonic, or radar is often infeasible for wall-climbing\nrobots. Moreover, GPS-based localization is generally unreliable in these\nenvironments because of signal degradation caused by reinforced concrete and\nelectromagnetic interference.

Since the tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) effect is an important\nresearch aspect in spintronics, we theoretically propose a universal\naltermagnetic sandwich device to achieve the TMR effect and investigate its\ntransport properties. Using the nonequilibrium Green's function method and the\nLandauer-B\\\"uttiker formula, we obtain the conductance and the TMR ratio. By\nsystematically rotating the orientations of the altermagnet and spin, we\ninvestigate how the altermagnetic orientations affect the conductance and the\nTMR ratio, and comprehensively demonstrate the dependence of the conductance\nand the TMR ratio on a range of parameters in the system. By tuning the\naltermagnetism strength and the Fermi energy, as well as rotating the\norientations in the altermagnet, the TMR ratio can reach a value of over 1000%.\nIn addition, we analyze the detailed symmetry relations of the conductance and\nthe TMR ratio in our system.

While the existing stochastic control theory is well\nequipped to handle dynamical systems with stochastic uncertainties, a paradigm\nshift using distance measure based decision making is required for the\neffective further exploration of the field. As a first step, a distance measure\nbetween two linear time invariant stochastic dynamical systems is proposed\nhere, extending the existing distance metrics between deterministic linear\ndynamical systems. Distance measure for stochastic systems is proposed for the\nfrequency domain setting as the worst-case point-wise in frequency Wasserstein\ndistance between distributions characterising the uncertainties using inverse\nstereographic projection on the Riemann sphere. For the time domain setting,\nthe proposed distance corresponds to the gap metric induced type-$q$\nWasserstein distance between the push-forward measures under both systems'\ncorresponding measurable maps from the parameter space to their respective\nspace of system plants. It is proved and demonstrated using numerical\nsimulation that the proposed frequency domain distance measure shall never\nexceed the proposed time domain distance measure counterpart. Lower and upper\nbounds are provided for the proposed distance measures in both frequency and\ntime domain settings. The proposed distance measures induce a topology in the\ncorresponding (frequency/time) domain space of stochastic dynamical systems and\nwill facilitate the provision of probabilistic guarantees on system robustness\nand controller performances.",

We systematically\ngenerate various paraphrases of all the questions across six different common\nbenchmarks, and measure the resulting variations in effectiveness of 34\nstate-of-the-art LLMs, of different size and effectiveness. Our findings reveal\nthat while LLM rankings remain relatively stable across paraphrased inputs,\nabsolute effectiveness scores change, and decline significantly.

Such analysis also helps identify scheme proposals that\nare inherently difficult to implement in constant time. Because constant-time\nproperties can be broken during compilation, it is often necessary to analyze\nthe compiled binary directly.

    "abstract": "Stein variational gradient descent (SVGD) is a kernel-based and\nnon-parametric particle method for sampling from a target distribution, such as\nin Bayesian inference and other machine learning tasks.

However, in practice, SVGD can be slow compared to\nscore-estimation-based sampling algorithms. To design a fast and efficient\nhigh-dimensional sampling algorithm with the advantages of SVGD, we introduce\naccelerated SVGD (ASVGD), based on an accelerated gradient flow in a metric\nspace of probability densities following Nesterov's method. We then derive a\nmomentum-based discrete-time sampling algorithm, which evolves a set of\nparticles deterministically.

This is achieved by\nanalyzing the linearized accelerated gradient flows at the equilibrium.\nInterestingly, the optimal parameter is a constant, which does not depend on\nthe covariance of the target distribution. For the generalized kernel\nfunctions, such as the Gaussian kernel, numerical examples with varied target\ndistributions demonstrate the effectiveness of ASVGD compared to SVGD and other\npopular sampling methods.

Unlike\nbird's-eye-view (BEV) methods, which restrict scene representation to a 2D\nplane, occupancy prediction leverages a complete 3D voxel grid to model spatial\nstructures in all dimensions, thereby capturing semantic variations along the\nvertical axis. However, most existing approaches overlook height-axis\ninformation when processing voxel features. And conventional SENet-style\nchannel attention assigns uniform weight across all height layers, limiting\ntheir ability to emphasize features at different heights. To address these\nlimitations, we propose SliceSemOcc, a novel vertical slice based multimodal\nframework for 3D semantic occupancy representation. Specifically, we extract\nvoxel features along the height-axis using both global and local vertical\nslices. Then, a global local fusion module adaptively reconciles fine-grained\nspatial details with holistic contextual information. Furthermore, we propose\nthe SEAttention3D module, which preserves height-wise resolution through\naverage pooling and assigns dynamic channel attention weights to each height\nlayer. Extensive experiments on nuScenes-SurroundOcc and nuScenes-OpenOccupancy\ndatasets verify that our method significantly enhances mean IoU, achieving\nespecially pronounced gains on most small-object categories. Detailed ablation\nstudies further validate the effectiveness of the proposed SliceSemOcc\nframework.",

With the narrowing of edge potentials, the bending increases\ngradually. When the edge fields become symmetric, an asymmetric band gap at the\nDirac points can be obtained due to the intrinsic spin-orbit interaction,\nsuggesting a valley polarized quantum spin Hall state.

Reinforcement-learning\nbased alternatives can produce transferable policies but require substantial\nparameter updates and compute. In this work we introduce Meta-Policy Reflexion\n(MPR): a hybrid framework that consolidates LLM-generated reflections into a\nstructured, predicate-like Meta-Policy Memory (MPM) and applies that memory at\ninference time through two complementary mechanisms soft memory-guided decoding\nand hard rule admissibility checks(HAC). MPR (i) externalizes reusable\ncorrective knowledge without model weight updates, (ii) enforces domain\nconstraints to reduce unsafe or invalid actions, and (iii) retains the\nadaptability of language-based reflection. We formalize the MPM representation,\npresent algorithms for update and decoding, and validate the approach in a\ntext-based agent environment following the experimental protocol described in\nthe provided implementation (AlfWorld-based). Empirical results reported in the\nsupplied material indicate consistent gains in execution accuracy and\nrobustness when compared to Reflexion baselines; rule admissibility further\nimproves stability.

    "abstract": "Despite the success of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) in recent years, prompt\ndesign for LMMs in Multiple-Choice Question Answering (MCQA) remains poorly\nunderstood. We show that even minor variations in prompt phrasing and structure\ncan lead to accuracy deviations of up to 15% for certain prompts and models.\nThis variability poses a challenge for transparent and fair LMM evaluation, as\nmodels often report their best-case performance using carefully selected\nprompts. To address this, we introduce Promptception, a systematic framework\nfor evaluating prompt sensitivity in LMMs. It consists of 61 prompt types,\nspanning 15 categories and 6 supercategories, each targeting specific aspects\nof prompt formulation, and is used to evaluate 10 LMMs ranging from lightweight\nopen-source models to GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro, across 3 MCQA benchmarks:\nMMStar, MMMU-Pro, MVBench. Our findings reveal that proprietary models exhibit\ngreater sensitivity to prompt phrasing, reflecting tighter alignment with\ninstruction semantics, while open-source models are steadier but struggle with\nnuanced and complex phrasing. Based on this analysis, we propose Prompting\nPrinciples tailored to proprietary and open-source LMMs, enabling more robust\nand fair model evaluation.",

However, the\ncontinuous advancement of jailbreak attack techniques, designed to bypass\nsafety mechanisms with adversarial prompts, has placed increasing pressure on\nthe security defenses of LLMs. Strengthening resistance to jailbreak attacks\nrequires an in-depth understanding of the security mechanisms and\nvulnerabilities of LLMs. However, the vast number of parameters and complex\nstructure of LLMs make analyzing security weaknesses from an internal\nperspective a challenging task. This paper presents NeuroBreak, a top-down\njailbreak analysis system designed to analyze neuron-level safety mechanisms\nand mitigate vulnerabilities. We carefully design system requirements through\ncollaboration with three experts in the field of AI security. The system\nprovides a comprehensive analysis of various jailbreak attack methods. By\nincorporating layer-wise representation probing analysis, NeuroBreak offers a\nnovel perspective on the model's decision-making process throughout its\ngeneration steps. Furthermore, the system supports the analysis of critical\nneurons from both semantic and functional perspectives, facilitating a deeper\nexploration of security mechanisms.

This paper identifies critical\ngaps in Australias current capability, showing how they undermine climate\nimpact and risk assessments in cities and may lead to poorly designed\nadaptation and mitigation strategies. These gaps, and the recommendations to\naddress them, were identified through consultation with experts across research\ninstitutes, universities, two ARC Centres of Excellence, federal and state\ngovernments, and private agencies.\n  Our recommendations span four key areas: city descriptive datasets,\nintegrated observations, fit for purpose models, and a coordinated community of\nresearch and practice. Urgent action is needed to tailor models to Australia's\nunique urban landscapes and climates. This requires comprehensive, nationally\nconsistent, high resolution datasets that capture the form, fabric, and\nfunction of contemporary and future cities. It also requires filling systematic\ngaps in integrated networks of urban climate observations for evaluation and\nbenchmarking. At the same time, scientific understanding of key urban processes\nthat influence weather and climate must advance, alongside improvements in\ntheir representation in physical models.

A variant of this game, called the $q$-analogue of zero\nforcing, was later introduced.

Our analysis shows\nthat current LLMs exhibit limitations in generating accurate fact-checking\nconclusions, even when enhanced with chain-of-thought reasoning and few-shot\nprompting. To understand these limitations, we develop a taxonomy to categorize\nflawed LLM-generated explanations for their conclusions and identify factual\nfabrication as the most common failure mode. Although LLMs alone are unreliable\nfor fact-checking, our findings indicate their considerable potential to\naugment human performance when deployed as assistive tools in scenarios.

To\naddress this, we present a world model implanting framework (WorMI) that\ncombines the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) with\nindependently learned, domain-specific world models through test-time\ncomposition. By allowing seamless implantation and removal of the world models,\nthe embodied agent's policy achieves and maintains cross-domain adaptability.\nIn the WorMI framework, we employ a prototype-based world model retrieval\napproach, utilizing efficient trajectory-based abstract representation\nmatching, to incorporate relevant models into test-time composition. We also\ndevelop a world-wise compound attention method that not only integrates the\nknowledge from the retrieved world models but also aligns their intermediate\nrepresentations with the reasoning model's representation within the agent's\npolicy. This framework design effectively fuses domain-specific knowledge from\nmultiple world models, ensuring robust adaptation to unseen domains. We\nevaluate our WorMI on the VirtualHome and ALFWorld benchmarks, demonstrating\nsuperior zero-shot and few-shot performance compared to several LLM-based\napproaches across a range of unseen domains. These results highlight the\nframeworks potential for scalable, real-world deployment in embodied agent\nscenarios where adaptability and data efficiency are essential.",

LATTE delivers\naccuracy on par with the base decoder while achieving real-time decoding\nthroughput and significantly reducing both bandwidth requirements and\ncomputational resources, enabling a level of scalability far beyond previous\napproaches. Under circuit-level noise $p=0.001$, LATTE achieves over\n$\\mathbf{90\\%}$ reduction in transmission bandwidth and a $\\mathbf{6.4\\times}$\nspeedup on average in single-block decoding.

However, existing methods often lack an\nunderstanding of OOD images, making it difficult to construct an accurate\nnegative space. In addition, the presence of false negative labels\nsignificantly degrades their near-OOD performance. To address these issues, we\npropose shaping an Adaptive Negative Textual Space (ANTS) by leveraging the\nunderstanding and reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models\n(MLLMs). Specifically, we identify images likely to be OOD samples as negative\nimages and prompt the MLLM to describe these images, generating expressive\nnegative sentences that precisely characterize the OOD distribution and enhance\nfar-OOD detection. For the near-OOD setting, where OOD samples resemble the\nin-distribution (ID) subset, we first identify the subset of ID classes that\nare visually similar to negative images and then leverage the reasoning\ncapability of MLLMs to generate visually similar negative labels tailored to\nthis subset, effectively reducing false negatives and improving near-OOD\ndetection. To balance these two types of negative textual spaces, we design an\nadaptive weighted score that enables the method to handle different OOD task\nsettings (near-OOD and far-OOD) without relying on task-specific prior\nknowledge, making it highly adaptable in open environments. On the ImageNet\nbenchmark, our ANTS significantly reduces the FPR95 by 4.2\\%, establishing a\nnew state-of-the-art.

    "abstract": "Motivated by the recent observation of giant room-temperature magnon spin\nconductivity in an ultrathin ferromagnetic insulator [X.-Y. Wei et al., Nat.\nMater. 21, 1352 (2022)], we investigate thickness-dependent magnon spin\ntransport in thin antiferromagnetic insulators (AFIs). We study the\nprototypical AFI hematite, known for its exceptionally low magnetic damping and\ntwo distinct magnetic phases: a low-temperature uniaxial easy-axis phase and a\nhigh-temperature biaxial easy-plane phase. Using stochastic micromagnetic\nsimulations, we investigate thickness-dependent magnon spin transport across\nboth magnetic phases. Our results uncover a crossover from\nquasi-three-dimensional to quasi-two-dimensional magnon spin transport at a\ncritical thickness, determined by the frequency or energy of the excited\nmagnons. Below this critical thickness, we observe a pronounced enhancement in\nthe magnon diffusion length in both magnetic phases. This rise is attributed to\na change in the effective magnon density of states, reflecting the reduced\nphase space available for scattering in the thinner, quasi-two-dimensional\nregime. Understanding and controlling long-distance magnon spin transport in\nAFIs is crucial for developing next-generation spintronic nanodevices,\nespecially as materials approach the two-dimensional limit.",

    "abstract": "Current Ethereum fraud detection methods rely on context-independent,\nnumerical transaction sequences, failing to capture semantic of account\ntransactions. Furthermore, the pervasive homogeneity in Ethereum transaction\nrecords renders it challenging to learn discriminative account embeddings.\nMoreover, current self-supervised graph learning methods primarily learn node\nrepresentations through graph reconstruction, resulting in suboptimal\nperformance for node-level tasks like fraud account detection, while these\nmethods also encounter scalability challenges. To tackle these challenges, we\npropose LMAE4Eth, a multi-view learning framework that fuses transaction\nsemantics, masked graph embedding, and expert knowledge. We first propose a\ntransaction-token contrastive language model (TxCLM) that transforms\ncontext-independent numerical transaction records into logically cohesive\nlinguistic representations. To clearly characterize the semantic differences\nbetween accounts, we also use a token-aware contrastive learning pre-training\nobjective together with the masked transaction model pre-training objective,\nlearns high-expressive account representations. We then propose a masked\naccount graph autoencoder (MAGAE) using generative self-supervised learning,\nwhich achieves superior node-level account detection by focusing on\nreconstructing account node features. To enable MAGAE to scale for large-scale\ntraining, we propose to integrate layer-neighbor sampling into the graph, which\nreduces the number of sampled vertices by several times without compromising\ntraining quality. Finally, using a cross-attention fusion network, we unify the\nembeddings of TxCLM and MAGAE to leverage the benefits of both.

    "abstract": "This study experimentally examines the entry and penetration of a\nsuperhydrophobic sphere into a quiescent deep pool, with special emphasis\nplaced on the primary and secondary pinch-off of the air cavity existing in its\nwake. Two aspects are novel in this study. For one, the experiments are\nperformed for a large range of dimensionless sphere densities, where lighter\nspheres, with their air cavity, exhibit a terminally ascending trajectory and\nheavier spheres a terminally descending trajectory. The second novel result is\na strong correlation of primary and secondary pinch-off times with the Froude\nnumber at impact and the dimensionless density. A semi-empirical correlation\nfor the air cavity volume following the primary pinch-off shows excellent\nagreement with measurements over all dimensionless densities. A scalar force\nbalance predicts a drastic decrease of buoyancy upon pinch-off, reflected also\nin the abrupt change of deceleration, measured using two orthogonally placed\nhigh-speed cameras to capture the time resolved trajectory of the sphere in the\npool. Comparisons are drawn between the trajectories of superhydrophobic\nspheres and those of hydrophilic spheres, measured in a previous study.",

    "abstract": "Groups of finite type (also called finitely constrained groups), introduced\nby Grigorchuk, are known to be the closure of regular branch groups. This\narticle explores many of their properties.\n  Firstly, we prove that being finitely generated, just-infinite and strongly\ncomplete are equivalent in a vast family of groups of finite type. As a\nconsequence, we prove that the closure of the Hanoi towers group on 3 pegs is\njust-infinite although the group itself is not.\n  Secondly, we improve the algorithm given by Bondarenko and Samoilovych in\n[9], to compute all the groups of finite type of a given depth and acting on a\ngiven tree. We use this to find the groups of finite type acting on the ternary\ntree with depth 2 and 3.\n  Thirdly, we give a sufficient condition for a group generated by a finite\nautomaton of Mealy type to have as closure a group of finite type. This allows\nus to identify groups of finite type as the closure of explicit groups\ngenerated by a finite automaton.\n  Lastly, we give an algorithm to prove whether two groups of finite type are\nisomorphic. With this result, we classify groups of finite type up to\nisomorphism in the binary tree for depths 2, 3 and 4 and in the ternary tree\nfor depths 2 and 3.",

Our results\ndemonstrate that both the NSCC and the global sum estimates are highly\nsensitive to damage specifications and preference parameters, including the\npure rate of time preference and relative risk aversion. Compared to aggregated\nsingle-sector approaches, the disaggregated model with uncertainty yields\nhigher values of the NSCC for low- and middle-income countries. The paper\ncontributes to the literature by quantifying how sector-specific\nvulnerabilities and stochastic variability amplify climate damages and reshape\nglobal equity in the distribution of the NSCC. The NSCCs derived from our model\noffer policy-relevant metrics for adaptation planning, mitigation target\nsetting, and equitable burden-sharing in international climate negotiations.\nThis approach bridges the gap between globally harmonized carbon pricing and\nnationally differentiated climate impacts, providing a theoretically grounded\nand empirically rich framework for future climate policy design.",

    "abstract": "Antiferromagnetic superlattices (AFSL) are proposed based on the buckled\nhexagonal two-dimensional materials, which can be realized by the proximity\neffect of the periodically deposited antiferromagnets. It is found that the AF\nproximity effect can give rise to valley-polarized minibands and conductance,\nwhich are not held under ferromagnetic proximity. The spin degeneracy and\nvalley degeneracy are lifted simultaneously in the presence of AF proximity and\nelectric field. In consequence, both minibands and conductance could be\nspin-valley polarized completely in AFSL. The symmetry of spin-valley\npolarization is analysed by considering the pseudospin rotation operations and\nspatial inversion operations. Furthermore, AFSL also induce a highly\nanisotropic band structure due to the spin-orbit coupling (SOC). In particular,\nthe group velocity parallel to the periodic direction of AFSL is greatly\nrenormalized, while the velocity perpendicular to the periodic direction\nremains unaffected, contrary to that observed in graphene superlattices. With\nthe increase of SOC, the anisotropy becomes more prominent, leading to\nflattened band and electron supercollimation. The direction of anisotropy can\nbe regulated by adjusting the potential and SOC. These findings offer an\nalternative approach to engineering anisotropic two-dimensional materials. As\nan application, the AFSL may well work as a symmetry-protected spin-valley\nvalve easily controlled by the gate voltages.",

This coherence function is then\nrigorously projected onto OAM modes, yielding an exactly normalized series\nrepresentation whose absolute convergence is formally proven. The analysis\nmeticulously resolves limiting disorder regimes: for coarse disorder, an ideal\nOAM spectrum, sharply peaked at its nominal OAM mode, is demonstrated.\nConversely, for fine disorder, a specific fraction of total power exponentially\ndecays with disorder variance into the nominal OAM mode, with remaining power\ndistributed among nearby OAM modes, exhibiting an effective width inversely\nproportional to the dimensionless correlation length. Crucially, a new\nuniversal scaling framework, defined by a master control parameter and a\nuniversal coordinate, is introduced. This framework, rigorously derived from\nthe exact solution, unifies the spectrum's description across all relevant\ndisorder regimes and enables robust data collapse.

While previous studies have validated this\nconcept, no realistic feasibility studies have been conducted for the solar\nflare X-ray polarization observation. In this work, we performed polarization\nsensitivity measurements at synchrotron facilities.

The measurements also\ndetermined the thickness of the sensitive layer to be approximately 5 $\\mu$m,\nand the thicknesses of the insensitive layers to be 0.8 $\\mu$m (Si), 2.1 $\\mu$m\n(SiO2), and 0.24 $\\mu$m (Cu).

Cosmological simulations predict that the mass and temperature of the\nICM rapidly decrease with increasing cosmological redshift, as intracluster gas\nin younger clusters is still accumulating and being heated. The thermal\nSunyaev-Zeldovich (tSZ) effect arises when cosmic microwave background (CMB)\nphotons are scattered to higher energies through interactions with energetic\nelectrons in hot ICM, leaving a localized decrement in the CMB at a long\nwavelength. The depth of this decrement is a measure of the thermal energy and\npressure of the gas. To date, the effect has been detected in only three\nsystems at or above $z\\sim2$, when the Universe was 4 billion years old, making\nthe time and mechanism of ICM assembly uncertain. Here, we report observations\nof this effect in the protocluster SPT2349$-$56 with Atacama Large\nMillimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). SPT2349$-$56 contains a large molecular\ngas reservoir, with at least 30 dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) and three\nradio-loud active galactic nuclei (AGN) in a 100-kpc region at $z=4.3$,\ncorresponding to 1.4 billion years after the Big Bang. The observed tSZ signal\nimplies a thermal energy of $\\mathbf{\\sim 10^{61}\\,\\mathrm{erg}}$, exceeding\nthe possible energy of a virialized ICM by an order of magnitude. Contrary to\ncurrent theoretical expectations, the strong tSZ decrement in SPT2349$-$56\ndemonstrates that substantial heating can occur and deposit a large amount of\nthermal energy within growing galaxy clusters, overheating the nascent ICM in\nunrelaxed structures, two billion years before the first mature clusters\nemerged at $\\mathbf{z \\sim 2}$.",

This paper proposes a two-stage SR framework with\nresidue refinement that integrates observations from a central SMA and four\nsurrounding linear microphone arrays (LMAs). The core idea is to exploit\ncomplementary spatial characteristics by treating the SMA as a primary\nestimator and the LMAs as a spatially complementary refiner.

    "abstract": "Indoor positioning is an enabling technology for home, office, and industrial\nnetwork users because it provides numerous information and communication\ntechnology (ICT) and Internet of things (IoT) functionalities such as indoor\nnavigation, smart meter localization, asset tracking, support for emergency\nservices, and detection of hazardous situations. The IEEE 802.11mc fine timing\nmeasurement (FTM) protocol (commercially known as Wi-Fi Location) has great\npotential to enable indoor positioning in future generation devices, primarily\nbecause of the high availability of Wi-Fi networks, FTM's high accuracy and\ndevice support. Furthermore, new FTM enhancements are available in the released\n(802.11az) and recently completed (802.11bk) amendments. Despite the multitude\nof literature reviews on indoor positioning, a survey dedicated to FTM and its\nrecent enhancements has so far been lacking. We fill this gap by classifying\nand reviewing over 180 research papers related to the practical accuracy\nachieved with FTM, methods for improving its accuracy (also with machine\nlearning), combining FTM with other indoor positioning systems, FTM-based\napplications, and security issues. Based on the conducted survey, we summarize\nthe most important research achievements and formulate open areas for further\nresearch.",

    "abstract": "Open-source software OSS is widely adopted in enterprise settings, but\nstandalone tools often lack native support for protocols like SAML or OIDC,\ncreating a critical security integration gap. This paper introduces and\nformalizes the Auth Shim, a lightweight architectural pattern designed to solve\nthis problem. The Auth Shim is a minimal, external proxy service that acts as a\ncompatibility layer, translating requests from an enterprise Identity Provider\nIdP into the native session management mechanism of a target application. A key\nprerequisite for this pattern is that the target application must expose a\nprogrammatic, secure administrative API. We present a case study of the\npattern's implementation at Adobe to integrate a popular OSS BI tool with Okta\nSAML, which enabled automated Role-Based Access Control RBAC via IAM group\nmapping and eliminated manual user provisioning. By defining its components,\ninteractions, and production deployment considerations, this paper provides a\nreusable, secure, and cost-effective blueprint for integrating any standalone\nOSS tool into an enterprise SSO ecosystem, thereby enabling organizations to\nembrace open-source innovation without compromising on security governance.",

It is\ntherefore important to understand the circumstances that can lead to increased\ndependencies. Recent studies suggest that code smells, which are\ncharacteristics of code that indicate potential design issues, may interact in\nways that increase dependencies between modules. In this study, we aim to\nconfirm previous observations and investigate whether and how the distribution\nof static dependencies changes in the presence of code smell interactions. We\nconducted a dependency analysis on 116 open-source Java systems to quantify the\ninteractions, comparing interactions among code smells and interactions between\ncode smells and non-code smells. Our results suggest that while interactions\nbetween code smell pairs are associated with increases in certain dependencies\nand decreases in others, overall, they are associated with an increase in total\ndependencies. For example, the median number of dependencies between Feature\nEnvy methods and Data Classes is seven times as many as when the methods are\nnon-Feature Envy methods, increasing from 1 to 7.

Their structural, kinematic, and chemical similarities to\nplanet-forming discs have motivated the idea that these systems may act as\nsites of \"second-generation\" planet formation. In this study, we assess whether\nthe gravitational instability mechanism - a proposed pathway for giant planet\nformation in some protoplanetary discs-can operate in post-AGB discs. Using the\nToomre criterion under well-motivated assumptions for disc structure and size,\nmass, and thermal properties, we assess the conditions for gravitational\ninstability. We first benchmark our analytical framework using several\nwell-studied protoplanetary disc systems before applying the same analysis to\nobserved post-AGB discs. We find that post-AGB discs are generally\ngravitationally stable at present, due primarily to their low masses. The disks\nwere stable against collapse, even when accounting for potentially higher disk\nmass in the past. In contrast, several protoplanetary discs analysed in the\nsame way show that they likely experienced gravitationally unstable phases\nearly on. Finally, we revisit the planet formation scenario proposed for the\npost-common envelope system NN Serpentis first carried out by Schleicher and\nDreizler and we show that gravitational instability could be feasible under\nspecific, high disc mass assumptions, however we note that their proposed disc\nmass is unlikely. Overall, our results provide the first systematic theoretical\nassessment of gravitational instability in post-AGB discs, demonstrating that\nthis mechanism is unlikely to dominate second-generation planet formation in\nthese systems, and underscoring the need to explore alternative pathways-such\nas core accretion-in future studies",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose OccTENS, a generative occupancy world model that\nenables controllable, high-fidelity long-term occupancy generation while\nmaintaining computational efficiency. Different from visual generation, the\noccupancy world model must capture the fine-grained 3D geometry and dynamic\nevolution of the 3D scenes, posing great challenges for the generative models.\nRecent approaches based on autoregression (AR) have demonstrated the potential\nto predict vehicle movement and future occupancy scenes simultaneously from\nhistorical observations, but they typically suffer from \\textbf{inefficiency},\n\\textbf{temporal degradation} in long-term generation and \\textbf{lack of\ncontrollability}. To holistically address these issues, we reformulate the\noccupancy world model as a temporal next-scale prediction (TENS) task, which\ndecomposes the temporal sequence modeling problem into the modeling of spatial\nscale-by-scale generation and temporal scene-by-scene prediction. With a\n\\textbf{TensFormer}, OccTENS can effectively manage the temporal causality and\nspatial relationships of occupancy sequences in a flexible and scalable way. To\nenhance the pose controllability, we further propose a holistic pose\naggregation strategy, which features a unified sequence modeling for occupancy\nand ego-motion. Experiments show that OccTENS outperforms the state-of-the-art\nmethod with both higher occupancy quality and faster inference time.",

Security practitioners need to spend a lot of time\nmanually identifying vulnerability-related IRs from the community, and the time\ngap may be exploited by attackers to harm the system. Previously, researchers\nhave proposed automatic approaches to facilitate identifying these\nvulnerability-related IRs, but these works focus on textual descriptions but\nlack the comprehensive analysis of IR's rich-text information. In this paper,\nwe propose VulRTex, a reasoning-guided approach to identify\nvulnerability-related IRs with their rich-text information. In particular,\nVulRTex first utilizes the reasoning ability of the Large Language Model (LLM)\nto prepare the Vulnerability Reasoning Database with historical IRs. Then, it\nretrieves the relevant cases from the prepared reasoning database to generate\nreasoning guidance, which guides LLM to identify vulnerabilities by reasoning\nanalysis on target IRs' rich-text information. To evaluate the performance of\nVulRTex, we conduct experiments on 973,572 IRs, and the results show that\nVulRTex achieves the highest performance in identifying the\nvulnerability-related IRs and predicting CWE-IDs when the dataset is\nimbalanced, outperforming the best baseline with +11.0% F1, +20.2% AUPRC, and\n+10.5% Macro-F1, and 2x lower time cost than baseline reasoning approaches.\nFurthermore, VulRTex has been applied to identify 30 emerging vulnerabilities\nacross 10 representative OSS projects in 2024's GitHub IRs, and 11 of them are\nsuccessfully assigned CVE-IDs, which illustrates VulRTex's practicality.",

Conventional electronic RT-SS\nsolutions face critical challenges in operating across the millimeter-wave and\nsub-terahertz bands, which are essential spectra for 6G wireless.

    "abstract": "Existing RGB-Event detection methods process the low-information regions of\nboth modalities (background in images and non-event regions in event data)\nuniformly during feature extraction and fusion, resulting in high computational\ncosts and suboptimal performance. To mitigate the computational redundancy\nduring feature extraction, researchers have respectively proposed token\nsparsification methods for the image and event modalities. However, these\nmethods employ a fixed number or threshold for token selection, hindering the\nretention of informative tokens for samples with varying complexity. To achieve\na better balance between accuracy and efficiency, we propose FocusMamba, which\nperforms adaptive collaborative sparsification of multimodal features and\nefficiently integrates complementary information. Specifically, an Event-Guided\nMultimodal Sparsification (EGMS) strategy is designed to identify and\nadaptively discard low-information regions within each modality by leveraging\nscene content changes perceived by the event camera. Based on the\nsparsification results, a Cross-Modality Focus Fusion (CMFF) module is proposed\nto effectively capture and integrate complementary features from both\nmodalities. Experiments on the DSEC-Det and PKU-DAVIS-SOD datasets demonstrate\nthat the proposed method achieves superior performance in both accuracy and\nefficiency compared to existing methods.

In this\nstudy, we systematically evaluated the impact of quantization on 12\nstate-of-the-art large language models, including both general-purpose and\nbiomedical-specific models, across eight benchmark datasets covering four key\ntasks: named entity recognition, relation extraction, multi-label\nclassification, and question answering. We show that quantization substantially\nreduces GPU memory requirements-by up to 75%-while preserving model performance\nacross diverse tasks, enabling the deployment of 70B-parameter models on 40GB\nconsumer-grade GPUs. In addition, domain-specific knowledge and responsiveness\nto advanced prompting methods are largely maintained.

This paradigm enables models to generate intermediate\nreasoning steps, thereby improving both accuracy and interpretability. However,\ndespite these advancements, a comprehensive understanding of how CoT-based\nreasoning affects the trustworthiness of language models remains\nunderdeveloped. In this paper, we survey recent work on reasoning models and\nCoT techniques, focusing on five core dimensions of trustworthy reasoning:\ntruthfulness, safety, robustness, fairness, and privacy. For each aspect, we\nprovide a clear and structured overview of recent studies in chronological\norder, along with detailed analyses of their methodologies, findings, and\nlimitations. Future research directions are also appended at the end for\nreference and discussion. Overall, while reasoning techniques hold promise for\nenhancing model trustworthiness through hallucination mitigation, harmful\ncontent detection, and robustness improvement, cutting-edge reasoning models\nthemselves often suffer from comparable or even greater vulnerabilities in\nsafety, robustness, and privacy.

    "abstract": "The Habitable Worlds Observatory requires active speckle suppression to\ndirectly image Earth-like exoplanets. Focal plane wavefront sensing and control\nallows us to detect, and subsequently remove, time-varying speckles through\nmeasurements of the electric field. Two measurement-based wavefront sensing\napproaches are pairwise probing (PWP) and the self-coherent camera (SCC).\nHowever, the PWP technique is time-consuming, requiring at least 4 images and\nreducing the speed at which aberrations can be eliminated. In the SCC, a\ncoronagraph mask diffracts light outside of the Lyot stop, where it is filtered\nwith a pinhole. The filtered light creates a reference beam, interfering with\nspeckles that leak through the coronagraph. The classic implementation of the\nSCC only works over small spectral bandwidths and needs significantly oversized\noptics which limits its implementation. We propose a new variant, the\nSpatially-Clipped Self-Coherent Camera (SCSCC). The SCSCC utilizes a pinhole\nplaced closer to the Lyot Stop, reducing the overall beam footprint and\nboosting the sensor resolution. A knife-edge beam splitter downstream of the\nLyot Stop splits the light into two channels: fringed and unfringed. This\nallows us to sense the wavefront with a single exposure. Time-varying\naberrations are effectively frozen in place, making them easy to remove. We\npresent monochromatic simulation results of the SCSCC in a sensing and control\nloop, demonstrating a normalized intensity of ~ 4 * 10^-10 in a 5-20 lambda/D\ndark hole. We find that wavefront control paired with the SCSCC achieves ~ 50x\ndeeper contrast than that achieved with PWP in a temporally evolving speckle\nfield. Our results make the SCSCC a valuable wavefront sensor concept for the\nupcoming Habitable World Observatory mission.",

We find that current large language models (LLMs), despite\nexcelling at many natural language processing (NLP) tasks, consistently fail to\ngrasp the layered semantics of Drivelological text. To investigate this, we\nconstruct a benchmark dataset of over 1,200+ meticulously curated and diverse\nexamples across English, Mandarin, Spanish, French, Japanese, and Korean.

A range of\nexperimental dark-field techniques and retrieval algorithms have been recently\ndeveloped to extract this signal by directly resolving dark-field-associated\nlocal image blurring with a high-resolution camera. While the underlying\nphysical mechanism that generates dark-field contrast is generally defined\nsimilarly across the methods, no comparison of these dark-field techniques\nusing identical samples has been conducted. In this paper, dark-field imaging\ndata from two samples were acquired using three emerging dark-field setups at a\nsynchrotron: propagation-based, single-grid, and speckle-based X-ray imaging.\nDark-field images were then reconstructed using a variety of retrieval\nalgorithms--some requiring only a single sample exposure, others multiple; some\nperforming local, pixel-wise analysis, and others operating globally on entire\nimages. We find that the dominant contribution to dark-field contrast--arising\nfrom diffuse scattering from unresolved microstructures or multiple refractions\nthrough larger, potentially resolved structures--is consistently recovered\nacross all approaches, demonstrating mutual agreement. However, some\ndifferences emerge for structures that are spatially varying. We attribute\nthese differences to the idea that each technique has a different internal\nruler, a sensitivity scale for dark-field retrieval influenced by both the\nexperimental design and algorithmic assumptions of the technique. This study is\nintended to guide dark-field imaging users in selecting the most appropriate\ntechnique for their imaging goals and to motivate future research into\ndark-field sensitivity and sources of dark-field contrast across different\nmethods.",

    "abstract": "Quadruped-based mobile manipulation presents significant challenges in\nrobotics due to the diversity of required skills, the extended task horizon,\nand partial observability. After presenting a multi-stage pick-and-place task\nas a succinct yet sufficiently rich setup that captures key desiderata for\nquadruped-based mobile manipulation, we propose an approach that can train a\nvisuo-motor policy entirely in simulation, and achieve nearly 80\\% success in\nthe real world. The policy efficiently performs search, approach, grasp,\ntransport, and drop into actions, with emerged behaviors such as re-grasping\nand task chaining.

Combining DESI spectroscopy with observations\nfrom the Palomar 200-inch Double Spectrograph (P200/DBSP), we confirm three\nlensed quasars with source redshifts of 1.71, 1.93, and 3.23 and Einstein radii\nof 0.96, 0.39, and 1.07 arcsec, respectively. We further identify 11\nhigh-confidence candidates that are well reproduced by a simple singular\nisothermal ellipsoid (SIE) model, exhibit lens galaxies in the image modeling,\nand have at least one available spectrum; across these, the Einstein radius\nspans 0.39 to 2.34 arcsec and the source redshift spans 1.13 to 2.88. In 8 of\nthe 11 cases, the systems already satisfy our lensing criteria except that only\none quasar image currently has a spectrum; obtaining a second spectrum for the\nother image would enable immediate confirmation. As by-products, we report\neight new lensed galaxies spanning galaxy- to group-scale lenses.

These models typically\noperate as black-boxes, complicating transparent and objective evaluation.\nCurrent evaluation methods primarily depend on subjective human assessment,\nlimiting scalability, transparency, and effectiveness. This research proposes a\nsystematic methodology using deterministic and Large Language Model\n(LLM)-generated Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to continuously monitor and evaluate GEN\nAI reliability. We construct two parallel KGs: (i) a deterministic KG built\nusing explicit rule-based methods, predefined ontologies, domain-specific\ndictionaries, and structured entity-relation extraction rules, and (ii) an\nLLM-generated KG dynamically derived from real-time textual data streams such\nas live news articles. Utilizing real-time news streams ensures authenticity,\nmitigates biases from repetitive training, and prevents adaptive LLMs from\nbypassing predefined benchmarks through feedback memorization. To quantify\nstructural deviations and semantic discrepancies, we employ several established\nKG metrics, including Instantiated Class Ratio (ICR), Instantiated Property\nRatio (IPR), and Class Instantiation (CI). An automated real-time monitoring\nframework continuously computes deviations between deterministic and\nLLM-generated KGs. By establishing dynamic anomaly thresholds based on\nhistorical structural metric distributions, our method proactively identifies\nand flags significant deviations, thus promptly detecting semantic anomalies or\nhallucinations. This structured, metric-driven comparison between deterministic\nand dynamically generated KGs delivers a robust and scalable evaluation\nframework.",

    "abstract": "Geometric phases depend only on the evolution path determined by the closed\ncircuit in the projective Hilbert space but not on evolution details of the\nquantum system, leading to geometric quantum computation possessing some\nintrinsic robustness against control errors. Coordinated with dynamical\ndecoupling, geometric quantum computation admits additional resilience to the\nenvironment-induced decoherence. However, the previous schemes of geometric\nquantum computation protected by dynamical decoupling require multiple physical\nqubits to encode a logical qubit, which undoubtedly increases the consumption\nof physical-qubit resources and the difficulty in the implementation of the\nlogical-qubit manipulation based on physical-qubit driving. In this work, we\nput forward a scheme of decoherence-mitigated geometric quantum computation\nbased only on physical qubits rather than logical qubits, hence avoiding the\nadditional overhead of physical-qubit resources for logical-qubit encoding as\nwell as the difficulty in the manipulation of logical qubits. Moreover, our\nscheme focuses on the most general interaction between an individual qubit and\nits environment so that it mitigates not just dephasing noise but rather\nregular decoherence. Our proposal thus represents a more realistic and\neffective approach towards the realization of geometric control with\ndecoherence mitigation.",

However, MLLMs inherently lack\nthree-dimensional spatial understanding. To overcome this limitation, a\nlightweight, plug-and-play bird's-eye view (BEV) injection connector is\nproposed. In this framework, a BEV of the environment is constructed by\ncollecting sensing data from neighboring vehicles. This BEV representation is\nthen fused with the ego vehicle's input to provide spatial context for the\nlarge language model. To support realistic multimodal learning, a co-simulation\nenvironment combining CARLA simulator and MATLAB-based ray tracing is developed\nto generate RGB, LiDAR, GPS, and wireless signal data across varied scenarios.\nInstructions and ground-truth responses are programmatically extracted from the\nray-tracing outputs.

Simulation results\nshow that the proposed BEV injection framework consistently improved\nperformance across all tasks.

    "abstract": "We present the discovery of the eclipsing binary MML 48, which is a member of\nUpper Centaurus Lupus, has an associated age of 16 Myr, and is composed of two\nyoung, low-mass stars. We used space- and ground-based observations to\ncharacterize the system with both time-series photometry and spectroscopy.\nGiven the extreme mass ratio between the stars, q_EB = 0.209 +- 0.014, we\nmodeled a single-lined spectroscopic and eclipsing binary system. The orbital\nperiod, 2.0171068 +- 0.0000004 d, is measured from the highest precision light\ncurves. We derive a primary mass of 1.2 +- 0.07 Msun using stellar models, and\nwith radial velocities we measured a secondary mass of 0.2509 +- 0.0078 Msun.\nThe radii are large, as expected for pre-main-sequence stars, and are measured\nas 1.574 +- 0.026 +- 0.050 Rsun and 0.587 +- 0.0095 +- 0.050 Rsun, for the\nprimary and secondary stars, respectively. MML 48 joins the short list of known\nlow-mass, pre-main-sequence eclipsing binaries (EBs), being one of only five\nsystems with intermediate ages (15-25 Myr), and the system with the most\nextreme mass ratio. The primary star is currently at the \"fusion bump\",\nundergoing an over-production of energy in the core due to the build-up of 3He\nbefore reaching its equilibrium abundance set by the proton-proton (p-p) I\nchain. MML 48 A is the first young star in an eclipsing system that has been\nfound during its fusion bump. MML 48 is thus an important benchmark for\nlow-mass stellar evolution at a time when the stars are rapidly changing, which\nallows for a tight constraint on the corresponding isochrone given the uneven\nmass ratio.",

We find that HN is strongly associated with higher income levels,\nwhile HL, on average globally, is not significant for income level once HN is\ncontrolled for, nor does it consistently predict short term growth.

    "abstract": "Historic urban quarters play a vital role in preserving cultural heritage\nwhile serving as vibrant spaces for tourism and everyday life. Understanding\nhow tourists perceive these environments is essential for sustainable,\nhuman-centered urban planning. This study proposes a multidimensional\nAI-powered framework for analyzing tourist perception in historic urban\nquarters using multimodal data from social media. Applied to twelve historic\nquarters in central Shanghai, the framework integrates focal point extraction,\ncolor theme analysis, and sentiment mining. Visual focus areas are identified\nfrom tourist-shared photos using a fine-tuned semantic segmentation model. To\nassess aesthetic preferences, dominant colors are extracted using a clustering\nmethod, and their spatial distribution across quarters is analyzed. Color\nthemes are further compared between social media photos and real-world street\nviews, revealing notable shifts. This divergence highlights potential gaps\nbetween visual expectations and the built environment, reflecting both\nstylistic preferences and perceptual bias. Tourist reviews are evaluated\nthrough a hybrid sentiment analysis approach combining a rule-based method and\na multi-task BERT model. Satisfaction is assessed across four dimensions:\ntourist activities, built environment, service facilities, and business\nformats. The results reveal spatial variations in aesthetic appeal and\nemotional response. Rather than focusing on a single technical innovation, this\nframework offers an integrated, data-driven approach to decoding tourist\nperception and contributes to informed decision-making in tourism, heritage\nconservation, and the design of aesthetically engaging public spaces.",

A modal decomposition of\nthe Gram matrix reveals that its structure is dominated by a few modes near the\ntarget frequency, and that each modal contribution reflects the spatial\ncorrelation of the corresponding mode shape. This suggests that placing sensors\nnear nodal regions where spatial correlation is low can reduce coherence in the\nfrequency response function (FRF) matrix and improve force reconstruction\naccuracy.

    "abstract": "Multi-agent systems of large language models (LLMs) show promise for complex\nreasoning, but their effectiveness is often limited by fixed collaboration\nprotocols. These frameworks typically focus on macro-level orchestration while\noverlooking agents' internal deliberative capabilities. This critical\nmeta-cognitive blindspot treats agents as passive executors unable to adapt\ntheir strategy based on internal cognitive states like uncertainty or\nconfidence. We introduce the Meta-Policy Deliberation Framework (MPDF), where\nagents learn a decentralized policy over a set of high-level meta-cognitive\nactions: Persist, Refine, and Concede. To overcome the instability of\ntraditional policy gradients in this setting, we develop SoftRankPO, a novel\nreinforcement learning algorithm. SoftRankPO stabilizes training by shaping\nadvantages based on the rank of rewards mapped through smooth normal quantiles,\nmaking the learning process robust to reward variance. Experiments show that\nMPDF with SoftRankPO achieves a a 4-5% absolute gain in average accuracy across\nfive mathematical and general reasoning benchmarks compared to six\nstate-of-the-art heuristic and learning-based multi-agent reasoning algorithms.\nOur work presents a paradigm for learning adaptive, meta-cognitive policies for\nmulti-agent LLM systems, shifting the focus from designing fixed protocols to\nlearning dynamic, deliberative strategies.",

Traditionally, crowd-sourcing\nmethods are used to collect cellular network performance metrics. However,\nthese approaches are inadequate in rural areas due to low-density population,\nand difficult terrain. The platform described here is a UAV-based and is\ndesigned to investigate the mobile network performance through aerial\noperations and gather Radio Access Network (RAN) signal alongside end-to-end\nnetwork performance metrics. Our platform gathers metrics through the\nintegration of an onboard computation unit and commercial off-the-shelf\ncellular modem. The gathered data are subsequently analyzed and displayed using\ngeospatial mapping utilities and statistical techniques to deliver key\nobservations on cellular network performance. Experimental results showed that\nthe received signal power improves at higher altitudes due to enhanced\nline-of-sight (LoS) conditions as expected. However, the signal quality\ndegrades as a result of increased interference from neighboring cells. The\nanalysis reveals that for most of the geographic area covered in the initial\nexperiments the system maintained acceptable signal quality, with adequate\nthroughput performance for both uplink and downlink communications, while\nmaintaining satisfactory round-trip time characteristics. Notably, the\nexperiment showed that a strong radio signal metric for a given cell does not\nnecessarily translate to consistent spatial coverage across the tested region.",

These subgrid-scale closures for unresolved processes\nare a leading source of model uncertainty. Here, we present a new approach to\ndeveloping machine learning parameterizations of small-scale climate processes\nby fine-tuning a pre-trained AI foundation model (FM). FMs are largely\nunexplored in climate research. A pre-trained encoder-decoder from a 2.3\nbillion parameter FM (NASA and IBM Research's Prithvi WxC) -- which contains a\nlatent probabilistic representation of atmospheric evolution -- is fine-tuned\n(or reused) to create a deep learning parameterization for atmospheric gravity\nwaves (GWs). The parameterization captures GW effects for a coarse-resolution\nclimate model by learning the fluxes from an atmospheric reanalysis with 10\ntimes finer resolution. A comparison of monthly averages and instantaneous\nevolution with a machine learning model baseline (an Attention U-Net) reveals\nsuperior predictive performance of the FM parameterization throughout the\natmosphere, even in regions excluded from pre-training. This performance boost\nis quantified using the Hellinger distance, which is 0.11 for the baseline and\n0.06 for the fine-tuned model. Our findings emphasize the versatility and\nreusability of FMs, which could be used to accomplish a range of atmosphere-\nand climate-related applications, leading the way for the creation of\nobservations-driven and physically accurate parameterizations for more\nearth-system processes.",

Moreover,\nintegrating AlphaQubit with sliding window-based parallel decoding schemes\npresents non-trivial challenges: AlphaQubit is trained solely to output a\nsingle bit corresponding to the global logical correction for an entire memory\nexperiment, rather than local physical corrections that can be easily\nintegrated.\n  We address this issue by training a recurrent, transformer-based neural\nnetwork specifically tailored for sliding-window decoding. While our network\nstill outputs a single bit per window, we derive training labels from a\nconsistent set of local corrections and train on various types of decoding\nwindows simultaneously. This approach enables the network to self-coordinate\nacross neighboring windows, facilitating high-accuracy parallel decoding of\narbitrarily long memory experiments.

Current time series online learning methods focus on two main\naspects: selecting suitable parameters to update (e.g., final layer weights or\nadapter modules) and devising suitable update strategies (e.g., using recent\nbatches, replay buffers, or averaged gradients). We challenge the conventional\nparameter selection approach, proposing that distribution shifts stem from\nchanges in underlying latent factors influencing the data.

    "abstract": "Prompt learning has recently attracted much attention for adapting\npre-trained vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) to downstream recognition\ntasks. However, most of the existing CLIP-based prompt learning methods only\nshow a limited ability for handling fine-grained datasets. To address this\nissue, we propose a causality-guided text prompt learning method via visual\ngranulation for CLIP, called CaPL, where the explored visual granulation\ntechnique could construct sets of visual granules for the text prompt to\ncapture subtle discrepancies among different fine-grained classes through\ncasual inference. The CaPL method contains the following two modules: (1) An\nattribute disentanglement module is proposed to decompose visual features into\nnon-individualized attributes (shared by some classes) and individualized\nattributes (specific to single classes) using a Brownian Bridge Diffusion\nModel; (2) A granule learning module is proposed to construct visual granules\nby integrating the aforementioned attributes for recognition under two causal\ninference strategies. Thanks to the learned visual granules, more\ndiscriminative text prompt is expected to be learned. Extensive experimental\nresults on 15 datasets demonstrate that our CaPL method significantly\noutperforms the state-of-the-art prompt learning methods, especially on\nfine-grained datasets.",

Drawing an analogy with Reynolds' decomposition, we perform a\nquasi-steady-state analysis of TRMLs, separating fields into mean and turbulent\ncomponents. In the quasi-isobaric TRML, upstream gas cools and compresses\nbefore streamwise momentum is fully mixed across the shear layer, which\nexhibits the expected negative turbulent shear stress $R_{xz}$ that steadily\nspreads into the cold phase. The thermal pressure reaches a minimum within the\nTRML, compensated by a positive vertical compressive stress $R_{zz}$. The sum\nof upstream ram and thermal pressures balances the downstream thermal pressure.\nRadiative losses are offset by enthalpy dissipation, with a negative turbulent\nheat flux $Q_{z}$ indicating thermal transport within the TRML. The\nvolume-averaged temperature profile is well fit by a tanh function -- an\nemergent property that, for the first time, enables a predictive theory for\nTRMLs consistent with numerical experiments, including the universality of\ntheir temperature-dependent emissivity distributions.",

    "abstract": "We develop a frequentist decision-theoretic framework for selecting the best\narm in one-shot, multi-arm randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Our approach\ncharacterizes the minimax-regret (MMR) optimal decision rule for any\nlocation-family reward distribution with full support. We show that the MMR\nrule is deterministic, unique, and computationally tractable, as it can be\nderived by solving the dual problem with nature's least-favorable prior. We\nthen specialize to the case of multivariate normal (MVN) rewards with an\narbitrary covariance matrix, and establish the local asymptotic minimaxity of a\nplug-in version of the rule when only estimated means and covariances are\navailable. This asymptotic MMR (AMMR) procedure maps a covariance-matrix\nestimate directly into decision boundaries, allowing straightforward\nimplementation in practice. Our analysis highlights a sharp contrast between\ntwo-arm and multi-arm designs. With two arms, the empirical success rule\n(\"pick-the-winner\") remains MMR-optimal, regardless of the arm-specific\nvariances. By contrast, with three or more arms and heterogeneous variances,\nthe empirical success rule is no longer optimal: the MMR decision boundaries\nbecome nonlinear and systematically penalize high-variance arms, requiring\nstronger evidence to select them. This result underscores that variance plays\nno role in optimal two-arm comparisons, but it matters critically when more\nthan two options are on the table. Our multi-arm AMMR framework extends\nclassical decision theory to multi-arm RCTs, offering a rigorous foundation and\na practical tool for comparing multiple policies simultaneously.",

Our contributions\ninclude: (1) identifying limitations of existing metrics, (2) introducing\nSiLVERScore for semantically-aware evaluation, (3) demonstrating its robustness\nto semantic and prosodic variations, and (4) exploring generalization\nchallenges across datasets. On PHOENIX-14T and CSL-Daily datasets, SiLVERScore\nachieves near-perfect discrimination between correct and random pairs (ROC AUC\n= 0.99, overlap < 7%), substantially outperforming traditional metrics.",

Our key idea is to\nexploit approximate low-rank + sparse structure in the reward matrix, under\npolicy-biased (MNAR) sampling. We prove recovery guarantees with\ninverse-propensity weighting, and establish a visitation-weighted\nerror-to-regret bound linking completion error to control performance.\nImportantly, when assumptions weaken, PAMC degrades gracefully: confidence\nintervals widen and the algorithm abstains, ensuring safe fallback to\nexploration. Empirically, PAMC improves sample efficiency across Atari-26 (10M\nsteps), DM Control, MetaWorld MT50, D4RL offline RL, and preference-based RL\nbenchmarks, outperforming DrQ-v2, DreamerV3, Agent57, T-REX/D-REX, and PrefPPO\nunder compute-normalized comparisons.

    "abstract": "Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) systems provide a method for factually\ngrounding the responses of a Large Language Model (LLM) by providing retrieved\nevidence, or context, as support. Guided by this context, RAG systems can\nreduce hallucinations and expand the ability of LLMs to accurately answer\nquestions outside the scope of their training data. Unfortunately, this design\nintroduces a critical vulnerability: LLMs may absorb and reproduce\nmisinformation present in retrieved evidence. This problem is magnified if\nretrieved evidence contains adversarial material explicitly intended to\npromulgate misinformation. This paper presents a systematic evaluation of RAG\nrobustness in the health domain and examines alignment between model outputs\nand ground-truth answers. We focus on the health domain due to the potential\nfor harm caused by incorrect responses, as well as the availability of\nevidence-based ground truth for many common health-related questions. We\nconduct controlled experiments using common health questions, varying both the\ntype and composition of the retrieved documents (helpful, harmful, and\nadversarial) as well as the framing of the question by the user (consistent,\nneutral, and inconsistent). Our findings reveal that adversarial documents\nsubstantially degrade alignment, but robustness can be preserved when helpful\nevidence is also present in the retrieval pool. These findings offer actionable\ninsights for designing safer RAG systems in high-stakes domains by highlighting\nthe need for retrieval safeguards.

Experimental evaluations show that the system\nproduces fluent and engaging responses (perplexity as low as 22.3, engagement\n$\\approx$0.80), while human studies confirm significant gains in realism,\nsafety, and effectiveness over strong baselines. In federated settings, models\ntrained with FedAvg sustain up to 30 rounds while preserving high engagement\n($\\approx$0.80), strong relevance ($\\approx$0.74), and low PII leakage\n($\\leq$0.0085).

The evaluation of guard models (LlamaGuard, LlamaGuard2/3,\nMD-Judge) shows a straightforward pattern: stricter moderation settings reduce\nthe chance of exposing personal information, but they also limit how much the\nmodel engages in conversation.
