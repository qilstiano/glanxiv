    "abstract": "For anticipating critical transitions in complex dynamical systems, the\nrecent approach of parameter-driven reservoir computing requires explicit\nknowledge of the bifurcation parameter. We articulate a framework combining a\nvariational autoencoder (VAE) and reservoir computing to address this\nchallenge. In particular, the driving factor is detected from time series using\nthe VAE in an unsupervised-learning fashion and the extracted information is\nthen used as the parameter input to the reservoir computer for anticipating the\ncritical transition. We demonstrate the power of the unsupervised learning\nscheme using prototypical dynamical systems including the spatiotemporal\nKuramoto-Sivashinsky system. The scheme can also be extended to scenarios where\nthe target system is driven by several independent parameters or with partial\nstate observations.",

A potential explanation for the\nanomalous flux ratios is microlensing: additional (de)magnification caused by\nstars and other compact objects in the lens galaxy. In this work, we combine\nobservations of iPTF16geu and SN Zwicky with simulated microlensing\nmagnification maps, leveraging their standardizable candle properties to\nconstrain the lens galaxy mass slope, $\\eta$, and the fraction of dark compact\nobjects, $f_{\\rm dc}$. The resulting mass slopes are $\\eta = 1.70 \\pm 0.07$ for\niPTF16geu and $\\eta = 1.81 \\pm 0.10$ for SN Zwicky. Our results indicate no\nevidence for a population of dark compact objects, placing upper limits at the\n$95\\%$ confidence level of $f_{\\rm dc} < 0.25$ for iPTF16geu and $f_{\\rm dc} <\n0.47$ for SN Zwicky. Assuming a constant fraction of dark compact objects for\nboth lensed SNe, we obtain $f_{\\rm dc} < 0.19$. These results highlight the\npotential of strongly lensed SNIa to probe the innermost parts of lens galaxies\nand learn about compact matter.",

The study employs a sharp-interface immersed boundary solver for the\nflow simulations and the aeroacoustic sound is predicted by the Ffowcs\nWilliams-Hawkings equation.

The DRL agent uses near-wall streamwise\nvelocity fluctuations as input to modulate wall blowing and suction velocities.\nThese DRL-based strategies achieve significant drag reduction, with maximum\nrates of 35.6% at Re_{\\tau}=180, 30.4% at Re_{\\tau}=550, and 27.7% at\nRe_{\\tau}=1000, outperforming traditional opposition control methods. Expanded\nrange of wall actions further enhances drag reduction, although effectiveness\ndecreases at higher Reynolds numbers. The DRL models elevate the virtual wall\nthrough blowing and suction, aiding in drag reduction. However, at higher\nReynolds numbers, the amplitude modulation of large-scale structures\nsignificantly increases the residual Reynolds stress on the virtual wall,\ndiminishing the drag reduction. Analysis of budget equations provides a\nsystematic understanding of the drag reduction dynamics behind. DRL models\nreduce skin friction by inhibiting the redistribution of wall-normal turbulent\nkinetic energy. This further suppresses the wall-normal velocity fluctuations,\nreducing the production of Reynolds stress, thereby decreasing skin friction.\nThis study showcases the successful application of DRL in turbulence control at\nhigh Reynolds numbers and elucidates the nonlinear control mechanisms\nunderlying the observed drag reduction.",

However, the requirement to apodise the pupil into a non-redundant\narray dramatically limits the throughput, typically to $\\sim$10\\% or less. This\nin turn has a dramatic impact on sensitivity, limiting observational reach to\nonly bright science targets. This paper presents \"Jewel Optics\", a technology\nthat leverages the gains in signal fidelity conferred by non-redundant Fizeau\nbeam combination without the sensitivity penalty incurred by traditional\naperture masks. Our approach fragments the pupil into several sets of\nsparse-array non-redundant patterns, each of which is encoded onto a unique\nphase wedge. After extensive searching, solutions could be found where all\nindividual sets are fully non-redundant while fully tiling the available area\nof the input pupil. Each pattern is assigned a common phase wedge which diverts\nlight from those sub-apertures onto a unique, defined region of the detector.\nWe demonstrate a prototype designed for use in the VAMPIRES instrument at the\nSubaru telescope and find excellent agreement between the design and lab\nresults.

We are interested in the robustness of this\npattern formation survival mechanism to changes in rainfall variability. For\nthis, we use a flow-kick modeling framework that treats storms as instantaneous\nkicks to the soil water. The positive feedbacks in the storm-level hydrology,\nthat act to concentrate water within the vegetation bands, are captured through\nthe spatial profiles of the soil water kicks. Between storms, the soil water\nand vegetation, modeled by a two-component reaction-diffusion system, evolve\ntogether. We use a combination of linear stability analysis and numerical\nsimulation to compare predictions of idealized periodic rainfall, with no\nvariability, to predictions when there is randomness in the timing and\nmagnitude of water input from storms. We show that including these random\nelements leads to a decrease in the parameter range over which patterns appear.\nThis suggests that an increase in storm variability, even with the same mean\nannual rainfall, may negatively impact the resilience of these pattern-forming\ndryland ecosystems.",

    "abstract": "A bilayer formed by stacking two distinct materials creates a moir\\'e\nlattice, which can serve as a platform for novel electronic phases. In this\nwork we study a unique example of such a system: the graphene-black phosphorus\nheterostructure (G/BP), which has been suggested to have an intricate band\nstructure. Most notably, the valence band hosts a quasi-one-dimensional region\nin the Brillouin zone of high density of states, suggesting that various\nmany-body electronic phases are likely to emerge. We derive an effective\ntight-binding model that reproduces this band structure, and explore the\nemergent broken-symmetry phases when interactions are introduced. Employing a\nmean-field analysis, we find that the favored ground-state exhibits a striped\nspin density wave (SDW) order, characterized by either one of two-fold\ndegenerate wave-vectors that are tunable by gating. Further exploring the\nphase-diagram controlled by gate voltage and the interaction strength, we find\nthat the SDW-ordered state undergoes a metal to insulator transition via an\nintermediate metallic phase which supports striped SDW correlations. Possible\nexperimental signatures are discussed, in particular a highly anisotropic\ndispersion of the collective excitations which should be manifested in electric\nand thermal transport.",

Long short-term\nmemory (LSTM) models were also used as a baseline. Two different datasets were\nused: a data from the Open-Source Imaging Consortium (OSIC) containing\nstructured time series data of demographics and lung function with a baseline\nCT scan of the lungs and the second from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging\nInitiative (ADNI) containing a series of MRI scans along with demographics,\nphysical examinations, and cognitive assessment data. An ablation study was\nperformed to understand the role of CDEs, multimodal data, attention fusion,\nand interpolation strategies on model performance. When the baseline models\nwere evaluated, the use of multimodal data resulted in an improvement in Neural\nCDE performance, with a lower test RMSE. Additionally, the performance of\nmultimodal Neural CDE was also superior to multimodal LSTM. In the\nattention-based architectures, fusion through concatenation and rectilinear\ninterpolation were found to improve model performance. The performance of the\nproposed RealDiffFusionNet was found to be superior (0.2570) to all models. For\nthe ADNI dataset, between the Neural-CDE and LSTM models trained only on the\nstructured data, the test RMSE were comparable (0.471 for LSTM vs. 0.4581\nNeural-CDE). Furthermore, the addition of image features from patients' MRI\nseries resulted in an improvement in performance, with a lower test RMSE\n(0.4372 with multimodal vs 0.4581 with structured data).

Our experimental results show\nthe capability of K-ARC to plan for up to 32 planar mobile robots, while\nachieving up to an order of magnitude of speed-up compared to previous methods\nin various scenarios. K-ARC is able to achieve this due to its two main\nproperties. First, K-ARC constructs its solution iteratively by planning in\nsegments, where initial kinodynamic paths are found through optimization-based\napproaches and the inter-robot conflicts are resolved through sampling-based\napproaches. The interleaving use of sampling-based and optimization-based\napproaches allows K-ARC to leverage the strengths of both approaches in\ndifferent sections of the planning process where one is more suited than the\nother, while previous methods tend to emphasize on one over the other. Second,\nK-ARC builds on a previously proposed multi-robot motion planning framework,\nAdaptive Robot Coordination (ARC), and inherits its strength of focusing on\ncoordination between robots only when needed, saving computation efforts. We\nshow how the combination of these two properties allows K-ARC to achieve\noverall better performance in our simulated experiments with increasing numbers\nof robots, increasing degrees of problem difficulties, and increasing\ncomplexities of robot dynamics.",

While a great deal of work in\nthe field uses internal representations to interpret model behavior, these\nrepresentations are inaccessible when given solely black-box access through an\nAPI. In this paper, we extract features of LLMs in a black-box manner by using\nfollow-up prompts and taking the probabilities of different responses as\nrepresentations to train reliable predictors of model behavior. We demonstrate\nthat training a linear model on these low-dimensional representations produces\nreliable and generalizable predictors of model performance at the instance\nlevel (e.g., if a particular generation correctly answers a question).\nRemarkably, these can often outperform white-box linear predictors that operate\nover a model's hidden state or the full distribution over its vocabulary. In\naddition, we demonstrate that these extracted features can be used to evaluate\nmore nuanced aspects of a language model's state. For instance, they can be\nused to distinguish between a clean version of GPT-4o-mini and a version that\nhas been influenced via an adversarial system prompt that answers\nquestion-answering tasks incorrectly or introduces bugs into generated code.\nFurthermore, they can reliably distinguish between different model\narchitectures and sizes, enabling the detection of misrepresented models\nprovided through an API (e.g., identifying if GPT-3.5 is supplied instead of\nGPT-4o-mini).",

    "abstract": "The dimensionality of vortical structures has recently been extended beyond\ntwo dimensions, providing higher-order topological characteristics and\nrobustness for high-capacity information processing and turbulence control. The\ngeneration of high-dimensional vortical structures has mostly been demonstrated\nin classical systems through the complex interference of fluidic, acoustic, or\nelectromagnetic waves. However, natural materials rarely support three- or\nhigher-dimensional vortical structures and their physical interactions. Here,\nwe present a high-dimensional gradient thickness optical cavity (GTOC) in which\nthe optical coupling of planar metal-dielectric multilayers implements\ntopological interactions across multiple dimensions. Topological interactions\nin high-dimensional GTOC construct non-trivial topological phases, which induce\nhigh-dimensional vortical structures in generalized parameter space in three,\nfour dimensions, and beyond. These emergent high-dimensional vortical\nstructures are observed under electro-optic tomography as optical vortex\ndynamics in two-dimensional real-space, employing the optical thicknesses of\nthe dielectric layers as synthetic dimensions. We experimentally demonstrate\nemergent vortical structures, optical vortex lines and vortex rings, in a\nthree-dimensional generalized parameter space and their topological\ntransitions. Furthermore, we explore four-dimensional vortical structures,\ntermed optical vortex sheets, which provide the programmability of real-space\noptical vortex dynamics. Our findings hold significant promise for emulating\nhigh-dimensional physics and developing active topological photonic devices.",

Iron-based materials\nare suitable for gap magnets applications since iron is the most abundant\nferromagnetic element on Earth.

Generating new hyperlinks\nfrom an observed, usually high-dimensional hypergraph is an important yet\nchallenging task with diverse applications, such as electronic health record\nanalysis and biological research. This task is fraught with several challenges.\nThe discrete nature of hyperlinks renders many existing generative models\ninapplicable. Additionally, powerful machine learning-based generative models\noften operate as black boxes, providing limited interpretability. Key\nstructural characteristics of hypergraphs, including node degree heterogeneity\nand hyperlink sparsity, further complicate the modeling process and must be\ncarefully addressed. To tackle these challenges, we propose Denoising Diffused\nEmbeddings (DDE), a general generative model architecture for hypergraphs. DDE\nexploits potential low-rank structures in high-dimensional hypergraphs and\nadopts the state-of-the-art diffusion model framework. Theoretically, we show\nthat when true embeddings are accessible, DDE exactly reduces the task of\ngenerating new high-dimensional hyperlinks to generating new low-dimensional\nembeddings. Moreover, we analyze the implications of using estimated embeddings\nin DDE, revealing how hypergraph properties--such as dimensionality, node\ndegree heterogeneity, and hyperlink sparsity--impact its generative\nperformance. Simulation studies demonstrate the superiority of DDE over\nexisting methods, in terms of both computational efficiency and generative\naccuracy.

    "abstract": "Drawing on contemporary pragmatist philosophy and linguistic theories on\ncognition, meaning, and communication, this paper presents a dynamic,\nmetasemantic-metapragmatic taxonomy for grounding and conceptualizing\nhuman-like multimodal communicative alignment. The framework is rooted in\ncontemporary developments of the three basic communicative capacities initially\nidentified by American logician and pragmatist philosopher Charles Sanders\nPeirce: iconic (sensory and perceptual qualities), indexical (contextual and\nsociocultural associations), and rule-like (symbolic and intuitive reasoning).\nExpanding on these developments, I introduce the concept of indexical\ncontextualization and propose the principle of \"contextualization\ndirectionality\" for characterizing the crucial metapragmatic capacity for\nmaintaining, navigating, or transitioning between semantic and pragmatic modes\nof multimodal communication. I contend that current cognitive-social\ncomputational and engineering methodologies disproportionately emphasize the\nsemantic/metasemantic domain, overlooking the pivotal role of metapragmatic\nindexicality in traversing the semantic-pragmatic spectrum of communication.\nThe framework's broader implications for intentionality, identity, affect, and\nethics in within-modal and cross-modal human-machine alignment are also\ndiscussed.",

To do this, we swap\nthe well-known module-hierarchy based concept with a transaction-level (TL)\nbased alternative, which still allows us to describe the design as precisely as\non RTL. We enhance the aspect-oriented and TL oriented language PDVL to support\nthe definition of functional coverage (FC) and assertions at all levels of a\nTL-hierarchy. We then show how to use a deductive formal verification (DFV)\nflow which compiles PDVL code into Gallina code to be used by the Coq theorem\nprover. It can be argued that FC can be converted into proof obligations and\nthat proving them is equivalent to 100\\% coverage. We also demonstrate how\nlower-level proofs can be reused when verifying aspects at higher-levels of a\nTL-hierarchy. We argue that the traditional assertion-based verification (ABV)\nmethodology is still supported and SVA can be proven using DFV.",

This paper asks how advising affects graduate students'\npost-PhD research productivity. Advising is highly concentrated: at the eight\nhighly-selective schools in our study, a minority of advisors do most of the\nadvising work. We quantify advisor attributes such as an advisor's own research\noutput and aspects of the advising relationship like coauthoring and research\nfield affinity that might contribute to student research success. Students\nadvised by research-active, prolific advisors tend to publish more, while\ncoauthoring has no effect. Student-advisor research affinity also predicts\nstudent success. But a school-level aggregate production function provides much\nweaker evidence of causal effects, suggesting that successful advisors attract\nstudents likely to succeed-without necessarily boosting their students' chances\nof success. Evidence for causal effects is strongest for a measure of advisors'\nown research output. Aggregate student research output appears to scale\nlinearly with graduate student enrollment, with no evidence of negative\nclass-size effects. An analysis of gender differences in research output shows\nmale and female graduate students to be equally productive in the first few\nyears post-PhD, but female productivity peaks sooner than male productivity.",

    "abstract": "Galactic black hole (BH) X-ray binaries are known to exhibit episodic\noutbursts, during which accretion and spectral mode distinctively transition\nbetween low/hard and high/soft state. X-ray observations during high/soft state\noccasionally reveal a pronounced presence of a powerful disk wind in these\nsystems. However, it is unexplored to date how such winds may influence disk\nemission in that regime. In this work, we consider an observational implication\nby Compton scattering of thermal disk radiation due to accretion disk winds by\nperforming multi-dimensional Monte Carlo simulations in the context of a\nstratified wind of large solid angle launched over a large radial extent of the\ndisk. Compton-scattered thermal disk spectrum is computed for a different wind\nproperty; i.e. wind density and its radial gradient. We find that the intrinsic\ndisk radiation can be significantly down-scattered by winds of moderate-to-high\ndensity to the extent that the transmitted spectrum can substantially deviate\nfrom the conventional multi-color-disk emission in a tangible way. % by factor\nof up to 70\\%. We thus claim that the conventional treatment of spectral\nhardening in the disk atmosphere may be insufficient to fully account for the\nobserved disk continuum in the presence of strong wind scattering. It is\nsuggested that the effect of scattering process (by $f_w$) should be\nincorporated to accurately evaluate an intrinsic disk spectrum besides the\nconventional hardening (color correction) factor (by $f_c$). We argue that BH\nspin measurements using thermal continuum-fitting in transient XRBs may well be\nmildly (if not significantly) altered by such spectral \"contamination\".",

We\npropose a theoretical explanation for this scaling, based on a non-perturbative\nanalysis of the system's phase-space structure. Gravitational collapse is shown\nto drive a turbulent phase-space flow of the quadratic Casimir invariant, where\nthe linear and non-linear time scales are balanced, and this balance dictates\nthe $k$ dependence of the power spectrum. A parallel is drawn to Batchelor\nturbulence in hydrodynamics, where large scales mix smaller ones via tidal\ninteractions. The $k^{-d}$ scaling is also derived by expressing $P(k)$ as a\nphase-space integral in the framework of kinetic field theory, which is\nanalysed by the saddle-point method; the dominant critical points of this\nintegral are precisely those where the time scales are balanced. The coldness\nof the dark-matter distribution function - its non-vanishing only on a\n$d$-dimensional sub-manifold of phase-space - underpins both approaches.

    "abstract": "Natural systems, such as tendons and spider silk, demonstrate how the\ncombination of strength and stretchability can be effectively achieved by\nintegrating stiff and flexible network structures. Inspired by these systems,\nwe developed a novel, solvent-free dual-network adhesive based on a\nself-assembling ABA triblock copolymer, poly(methyl methacrylate)-poly(n-butyl\nacrylate)-poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA-b-PnBA-b-PMMA), designed for\napplications requiring both high strength and stretchability. The triblock\ncopolymer forms a physically crosslinked network through microdomains of PMMA\nend-blocks that provide structural integrity, while the PnBA mid-block forms a\nsoft, stretchable matrix. To further enhance mechanical performance, a second\npoly(n-butyl acrylate) (PnBA) network is polymerized in situ, locking the PMMA\nmicrodomains in place and creating a load-bearing system. By varying the\ncrosslinking density of the secondary network, we tailor the adhesive's\nmechanical properties (Young's modulus: 0.17 - 1.18 MPa) to suit different\nsubstrates, creating a mechanically transparent seam. The resulting\ndual-network system combines different strategies to achieve high strength and\nstretchability, with adhesive performance comparable to industrial methods such\nas sewing, particularly in bonding neoprene fabric composites and sealing the\njoints. Our solvent-free approach also eliminates the need for lengthy solvent\nevaporation steps, offering an eco-friendly and more efficient alternative for\nflexible adhesive applications in fields such as soft robotics, flexible\nelectronics, and sports apparel.",

This approach slices a MAC-layer signature and embeds\nthe slices within CE frame preambles without extending frame size, allowing one\nor multiple stations to concurrently verify their respective APs'\ntransmissions.

In other cases, duality is used explicitly, but in a\nspecially tailored way that does not generalize to other problems.\n  In this paper we propose a unified primal-dual framework for designing\nverification algorithms that leverage duality. To that end, we generalize the\nconcept of a Lagrangian that is commonly used in linear programming and\noptimization to capture the domains considered in verification problems, which\nare usually discrete, e.g., powersets of states, predicates, ranking functions,\netc. A Lagrangian then induces a primal problem and a dual problem. We devise\nan abstract primal-dual procedure that simultaneously searches for a primal\nsolution and a dual solution, where the two searches guide each other. We\nprovide sufficient conditions that ensure that the procedure makes progress\nunder certain monotonicity assumptions on the Lagrangian.\n  We show that many existing algorithms in program analysis, verification, and\nautomated reasoning can be derived from our algorithmic framework with a\nsuitable choice of Lagrangian. The Lagrangian-based formulation sheds new light\non various characteristics of these algorithms, such as the ingredients they\nuse to ensure monotonicity and guarantee progress.

In this context, field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) have\ndemonstrated compelling performance by providing massive parallelism in deep\nneural networks (DNNs). Neural networks (NNs) are computationally intensive\nduring inference, as they require massive amounts of multiplication and\naddition, which makes their implementations costly. Numerous studies have\nrecently addressed this challenge to some extent using a combination of\nsparsity induction, quantization, and transformation of neurons or sub-networks\ninto lookup tables (LUTs) on FPGAs. Gradient boosted decision trees (GBDTs) are\na high-accuracy alternative to DNNs in a wide range of regression and\nclassification tasks, particularly for tabular datasets. The basic building\nblock of GBDTs is a decision tree, which resembles the structure of binary\ndecision diagrams. FPGA design flows are heavily optimized to implement such a\nstructure efficiently. In addition to decision trees, GBDTs perform simple\noperations during inference, including comparison and addition. We present\nTreeLUT as an open-source tool for implementing GBDTs using an efficient\nquantization scheme, hardware architecture, and pipelining strategy. It\nprimarily utilizes LUTs with no BRAMs or DSPs on FPGAs, resulting in high\nefficiency.

    "abstract": "Criminal networks such as human trafficking rings are threats to the rule of\nlaw, democracy and public safety in our global society. Network science\nprovides invaluable tools to identify key players and design interventions for\nLaw Enforcement Agencies (LEAs), e.g., to dismantle their organisation.\nHowever, poor data quality and the adaptiveness of criminal networks through\nself-organization make effective disruption extremely challenging. Although\nthere exists a large body of work building and applying network scientific\ntools to attack criminal networks, these work often implicitly assume that the\nnetwork measurements are accurate and complete. Moreover, there is thus far no\ncomprehensive understanding of the impacts of data quality on the downstream\neffectiveness of interventions. This work investigates the relationship between\ndata quality and intervention effectiveness based on classical graph theoretic\nand machine learning-based approaches. Decentralization emerges as a major\nfactor in network robustness, particularly under conditions of incomplete data,\nwhich renders attack strategies largely ineffective. Moreover, the robustness\nof centralized networks can be boosted using simple heuristics, making targeted\nattack more infeasible. Consequently, we advocate for a more cautious\napplication of network science in disrupting criminal networks, the continuous\ndevelopment of an interoperable intelligence ecosystem, and the creation of\nnovel network inference techniques to address data quality challenges.",

We formulate reconstruction\nas a mapping from incomplete observed data to full reconstructed fields. The\nmethod is validated on three fluid mechanics examples using diverse types of\ndata: (1) unsteady 2D vortex street in flow past a cylinder using simulation\ndata; (2) high-speed under-expanded impinging supersonic jets impingement using\nSchlieren imaging; and (3) 3D turbulent jet flow using particle tracking. The\nresults demonstrate the ability of ET to accurately reconstruct complex flow\nfields from highly incomplete data (90\\% missing), even for noisy experimental\nmeasurements, with fast training and inference on a single GPU.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate the relationship between the dynamic range and\nquantization noise power in modulo analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). Two\nmodulo ADC systems are considered: (1) a modulo ADC which outputs the folded\nsamples and an additional 1-bit folding information signal, and (2) a modulo\nADC without the 1-bit information. A recovery algorithm that unfolds the\nquantized modulo samples using the extra 1-bit folding information is analyzed.\nUsing the dithered quantization framework, we show that an oversampling factor\nof $\\mathrm{OF} > 3$ and a quantizer resolution of $b > 3$ are sufficient\nconditions to unfold the modulo samples. When these conditions are met, we\ndemonstrate that the mean squared error (MSE) performance of modulo ADC with an\nextra 1-bit folding information signal is better than that of a conventional\nADC with the same number of bits used for amplitude quantization. Since folding\ninformation is typically not available in modulo ADCs, we also propose and\nanalyze a recovery algorithm based on orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) that\ndoes not require the 1-bit folding information. In this case, we prove that\n$\\mathrm{OF} > 3$ and $b > 3 + \\log_2(\\delta)$ for some $\\delta > 1$ are\nsufficient conditions to unfold the modulo samples.

The success and efficiency of RDS can depend critically on\nthe nature of the incentives, including their number, value, call to action,\netc. Standard RDS uses an incentive structure that is set a priori and held\nfixed throughout the study. Thus, it does not make use of accumulating\ninformation on which incentives are effective and for whom. We propose a\nreinforcement learning (RL) based adaptive RDS study design in which the\nincentives are tailored over time to maximize cumulative utility during the\nstudy. We show that these designs are more efficient, cost-effective, and can\ngenerate new insights into the social structure of hidden populations. In\naddition, we develop methods for valid post-study inference which are\nnon-trivial due to the adaptive sampling induced by RL as well as the complex\ndependencies among subjects due to latent (unobserved) social network\nstructure. We provide asymptotic regret bounds and illustrate its finite sample\nbehavior through a suite of simulation experiments.",

    "abstract": "The isotropic stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) generated by a\npopulation of supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) provides a unique\nwindow into their cosmic evolution. In addition to the isotropic power\nspectrum, the anisotropic component of the signal carries additional\ninformation about the supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and host galaxy\nconnection. The measurement of this signal is usually carried out by angular\npower spectra, which is only a sufficient measure for a Gaussian and\nstatistically isotropic distribution of SMBHBs, where the statistical\nproperties of a field remain unchanged across the sky. In contrast, the\ncontribution from SMBHBs in nano-hertz SGWB will be hosted by fewer massive\ngalaxies, making the nano-hertz background anisotropic and non-Gaussian. As a\nresult, the performance of angular power spectra in extracting the underlying\nphysics is limited. In this work, we propose a novel technique called the\n\\texttt{Multi-Tracer Correlated Stacking}, which enables the detection of\nanisotropies in the SGWB by stacking the signal from regions of the sky with\ntracers of BHs such as active galactic nucleus (AGNs), quasars, bright\ngalaxies, etc., that can be mapped up to high redshift. We demonstrate this\ntechnique on a simulated supermassive BHBs distribution using an AGN catalog,\nwhich maps the underlying matter distribution approximately up to redshift\n$z=5$. This stacking technique uniquely distinguishes between isotropic and\nanisotropic distributions of SGWB source, surpassing the capabilities of\nangular power spectrum-based methods in detecting anisotropic signals. This\nhighlights the effectiveness of this technique in detecting anisotropic SGWB\nsignals and in the future, this technique can play a crucial role in its\ndiscovery.",

Our results\nsupport a picture in which sub-Neptunes hotter than ~850 K do not form\nhydrocarbon hazes due to a lack of methane to photolyze.

    "abstract": "Continuous gravitational waves (CWs) emission from neutron stars carries\ninformation about their internal structure and equation of state, and it can\nprovide tests of General Relativity. We present a search for CWs from a set of\n45 known pulsars in the first part of the fourth LIGO--Virgo--KAGRA observing\nrun, known as O4a. We conducted a targeted search for each pulsar using three\nindependent analysis methods considering the single-harmonic and the\ndual-harmonic emission models. We find no evidence of a CW signal in O4a data\nfor both models and set upper limits on the signal amplitude and on the\nellipticity, which quantifies the asymmetry in the neutron star mass\ndistribution. For the single-harmonic emission model, 29 targets have the upper\nlimit on the amplitude below the theoretical spin-down limit. The lowest upper\nlimit on the amplitude is $6.4\\!\\times\\!10^{-27}$ for the young energetic\npulsar J0537-6910, while the lowest constraint on the ellipticity is\n$8.8\\!\\times\\!10^{-9}$ for the bright nearby millisecond pulsar J0437-4715.\nAdditionally, for a subset of 16 targets we performed a narrowband search that\nis more robust regarding the emission model, with no evidence of a signal. We\nalso found no evidence of non-standard polarizations as predicted by the\nBrans-Dicke theory.",

    "abstract": "We present ORACLE, the first hierarchical deep-learning model for real-time,\ncontext-aware classification of transient and variable astrophysical phenomena.\nORACLE is a recurrent neural network with Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs), and has\nbeen trained using a custom hierarchical cross-entropy loss function to provide\nhigh-confidence classifications along an observationally-driven taxonomy with\nas little as a single photometric observation. Contextual information for each\nobject, including host galaxy photometric redshift, offset, ellipticity and\nbrightness, is concatenated to the light curve embedding and used to make a\nfinal prediction. Training on $\\sim$0.5M events from the Extended LSST\nAstronomical Time-Series Classification Challenge, we achieve a top-level\n(Transient vs Variable) macro-averaged precision of 0.96 using only 1 day of\nphotometric observations after the first detection in addition to contextual\ninformation, for each event; this increases to $>$0.99 once 64 days of the\nlight curve has been obtained, and 0.83 at 1024 days after first detection for\n19-way classification (including supernova sub-types, active galactic nuclei,\nvariable stars, microlensing events, and kilonovae). We also compare ORACLE\nwith other state-of-the-art classifiers and report comparable performance for\nthe 19-way classification task, in addition to delivering accurate top-level\nclassifications much earlier.

Aided by the superb sensitivity and efficiency of\nKCWI at the Keck II Telescope, we have obtained spatially resolved stellar\nkinematics over a ${\\sim}100''\\times 100''$ contiguous field of H15A for this\npurpose. The velocity field exhibits a low amplitude\n(${\\sim}20\\mathrm{~km~s}^{-1}$) rotation along a kinematic axis that is\nprominently misaligned from the photometric major axis, a strong indicator that\nH15A is triaxially shaped with unequal lengths for the three principal axes.\nUsing 2500 observed kinematic constraints, we perform extensive calculations of\nstellar orbits with the triaxial Schwarzschild code, TriOS, and search over\n${\\sim}$40,000 galaxy models to simultaneously determine the mass and intrinsic\n3D shape parameters of H15A. We determine a ratio of $p=0.89$ for the\nmiddle-to-long principal axes and $q=0.65$ for the short-to-long principal\naxes.

Both SMBHs lie significantly above the mean\n$M_\\mathrm{BH}-\\sigma$ scaling relation. Repeating the orbit modeling with the\naxisymmetrized version of TriOS produces worse fits to the KCWI kinematics and\nincreases $M_\\mathrm{BH}$ to $(2.55\\pm 0.20) \\times 10^{10}M_{\\odot}$, which is\nstill significantly below $M_\\mathrm{BH}=(4.0\\pm 0.8) \\times 10^{10}M_{\\odot}$\nreported in a prior axisymmetric study of H15A.",

We review the formalism of inflated GWs and\nderive the general deformation function between inflated and uninflated GW\nspectra in the instant-source or transitory-source application. It is valid for\nany e-folding number of instant or transitory source. Applying the formalism to\nGUT phase transition, we find that the e-folding number at 15 or 25 can shift\nthe GWs to 10 Hz or mHz hands, respectively, which might be tested in the\nfuture ground-based or space-based interferometers. We further generalise the\ndiscussion to inflated GWs via phase transition below the GUT scale.

However, the origin and evolution of WD\nmagnetism remain under debate. Two WD pulsars, AR Sco and J191213.72-441045.1\n(J1912), have been found, which are non-accreting binaries hosting rapidly\nspinning (1.97-min and 5.30-min, respectively) magnetic WDs. The WD in AR Sco\nis slowing down on a $P/\\dot{P}\\approx 5.6\\times 10^6$ yr timescale. It is\nbelieved they will eventually become polars, accreting systems in which a\nmagnetic WD (B $\\approx 10-240$ MG) accretes from a Roche lobe-filling donor\nspinning in sync with the orbit ($\\gtrsim 78$ min). Here, we present\nmultiwavelength data and analysis of Gaia22ayj, which outbursted in March 2022.\nWe find that Gaia22ayj is a magnetic accreting WD that is rapidly spinning down\n($P/\\dot{P} = 6.1^{+0.3}_{-0.2}\\times 10^6$ yr) like WD pulsars, but shows\nclear evidence of accretion, like polars. Strong linear polarization (40%) is\ndetected in Gaia22ayj; such high levels have only been seen in the WD pulsar AR\nSco and demonstrate the WD is magnetic. High speed photometry reveals a\n9.36-min period accompanying a high amplitude ($\\sim 2$ mag) modulation. We\nassociate this with a WD spin or spin-orbit beat period, not an orbital period\nas was previously suggested. Fast (60-s) optical spectroscopy reveals a broad\n``hump'', reminiscent of cyclotron emission in polars, between 4000-8000\nAngstrom. We find an X-ray luminosity of $L_X = 2.7_{-0.8}^{+6.2}\\times10^{32}\n\\textrm{ erg s}^{-1}$ in the 0.3-8 keV energy range, while two VLA radio\ncampaigns resulted in a non-detection with a $F_r < 15.8\\mu\\textrm{Jy}$ 3$\n\\sigma$ upper limit.

Aims: This study\ninvestigates whether the energies of absorption lines detected in photospheric\nradius expansion (PRE) bursts correlate with the inferred blackbody radius.\nPrevious reports suggested such a correlation, attributed to a combination of\nweaker gravitational redshift and higher blueshifts in bursts with larger\nradii. Methods: The analysis reexamines four previously studied PRE bursts and\nexamines eight additional bursts from 4U 1820-303, evidencing PRE. Spectral\nevolution is tracked on the shortest possible timescales (tenth of a second)\nadopting two parallel continuum descriptions to characterise the photospheric\nexpansion and line evolution. Applying the accretion-enhanced model, maximum\nblackbody radii of up to $\\sim$ 900 km are inferred, with peak bolometric\nluminosities exceeding the Eddington limit of an Helium accretor. Absorption\nlines are assessed for significance using Monte Carlo simulations, and spectral\nlines are characterised using the state-of-art plasma codes available within\n{\\sc{spex}} with a phenomenological continuum. A thorough parameter search\nexplores Doppler shifts to avoid local minima. Results: Several significant (>\n99.9%) absorption lines, including the previously reported 2.97 keV line, are\ndetected. While no consistent correlation between line energies and blackbody\nradii is confirmed, bursts with larger radii exhibit up to four lines and the\nline strength is higher. The modelling suggests that the observed lines mostly\noriginate from slightly redshifted (almost rest-frame) photo-/collisionally\nionised gas in emission. For the burst with the largest PRE, a combination of\nphoto-ionised plasma in both emission and absorption is preferred.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, 2D Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have made significant\nstrides in image-text understanding tasks. However, their performance in 3D\nspatial comprehension, which is critical for embodied intelligence, remains\nlimited. Recent advances have leveraged 3D point clouds and multi-view images\nas inputs, yielding promising results. However, we propose exploring a purely\nvision-based solution inspired by human perception, which merely relies on\nvisual cues for 3D spatial understanding. This paper empirically investigates\nthe limitations of VLMs in 3D spatial knowledge, revealing that their primary\nshortcoming lies in the lack of global-local correspondence between the scene\nand individual frames. To address this, we introduce GPT4Scene, a novel visual\nprompting paradigm in VLM training and inference that helps build the\nglobal-local relationship, significantly improving the 3D spatial understanding\nof indoor scenes. Specifically, GPT4Scene constructs a Bird's Eye View (BEV)\nimage from the video and marks consistent object IDs across both frames and the\nBEV image. The model then inputs the concatenated BEV image and video frames\nwith markers. In zero-shot evaluations, GPT4Scene improves performance over\nclosed-source VLMs like GPT-4o. Additionally, we prepare a processed video\ndataset consisting of 165K text annotation to fine-tune open-source VLMs,\nachieving state-of-the-art performance on all 3D understanding tasks.\nSurprisingly, after training with the GPT4Scene paradigm, VLMs consistently\nimprove during inference, even without object marker prompting and BEV image as\nexplicit correspondence. It demonstrates that the proposed paradigm helps VLMs\ndevelop an intrinsic ability to understand 3D scenes, which paves the way for a\nseamless approach to extending pre-trained VLMs for 3D scene understanding.",

The difficulty lies in\npreserving the appearance details of the reference object and accurately\nmodeling coherent motions at the same time. In this paper, we propose\nVideoAnydoor, a zero-shot video object insertion framework with high-fidelity\ndetail preservation and precise motion control. Starting from a text-to-video\nmodel, we utilize an ID extractor to inject the global identity and leverage a\nbox sequence to control the overall motion. To preserve the detailed appearance\nand meanwhile support fine-grained motion control, we design a pixel warper. It\ntakes the reference image with arbitrary key-points and the corresponding\nkey-point trajectories as inputs. It warps the pixel details according to the\ntrajectories and fuses the warped features with the diffusion U-Net, thus\nimproving detail preservation and supporting users in manipulating the motion\ntrajectories. In addition, we propose a training strategy involving both videos\nand static images with a weighted loss to enhance insertion quality.\nVideoAnydoor demonstrates significant superiority over existing methods and\nnaturally supports various downstream applications (e.g., talking head\ngeneration, video virtual try-on, multi-region editing) without task-specific\nfine-tuning.",

    "abstract": "Latent diffusion models with Transformer architectures excel at generating\nhigh-fidelity images. However, recent studies reveal an optimization dilemma in\nthis two-stage design: while increasing the per-token feature dimension in\nvisual tokenizers improves reconstruction quality, it requires substantially\nlarger diffusion models and more training iterations to achieve comparable\ngeneration performance. Consequently, existing systems often settle for\nsub-optimal solutions, either producing visual artifacts due to information\nloss within tokenizers or failing to converge fully due to expensive\ncomputation costs. We argue that this dilemma stems from the inherent\ndifficulty in learning unconstrained high-dimensional latent spaces. To address\nthis, we propose aligning the latent space with pre-trained vision foundation\nmodels when training the visual tokenizers. Our proposed VA-VAE (Vision\nfoundation model Aligned Variational AutoEncoder) significantly expands the\nreconstruction-generation frontier of latent diffusion models, enabling faster\nconvergence of Diffusion Transformers (DiT) in high-dimensional latent spaces.\nTo exploit the full potential of VA-VAE, we build an enhanced DiT baseline with\nimproved training strategies and architecture designs, termed LightningDiT.

    "abstract": "Recent years have seen rapid progress in calculations of gravitational\nwaveforms from asymmetric compact binaries containing spinning secondaries.\nHere we outline a complete waveform-generation scheme, through first\npost-adiabatic order (1PA) in gravitational self-force theory, for generic\nsecondary spin and generic (eccentric, precessing) orbital configurations\naround a generic Kerr primary. We emphasize the utility of a Fermi-Walker frame\nin parametrizing the secondary spin, and we analyse precession and nutation\neffects in the spin-orbit dynamics. We also explain convenient gauge choices\nwithin the waveform-generation scheme, and the gauge invariance of the\nresulting waveform. Finally, we highlight that, thanks to recent results due to\nGrant and Witzany et al., all relevant spin effects at 1PA order can now be\ncomputed without evaluating local self-forces or torques.",

    "abstract": "Recently, there have been several advancements in quantum algorithms for\nGibbs sampling. These algorithms simulate the dynamics generated by an\nartificial Lindbladian, which is meticulously constructed to obey a\ndetailed-balance condition with the Gibbs state of interest, ensuring it is a\nstationary point of the evolution, while simultaneously having efficiently\nimplementable time steps. The overall complexity then depends primarily on the\nmixing time of the Lindbladian, which can vary drastically, but which has been\npreviously bounded in the regime of high enough temperatures [Rouz\\'e et al.\narXiv:2403.12691 and arXiv:2411.04885]. In this work, we calculate the spectral\ngap of the Lindbladian for free fermions using third quantisation, and also\nprove a logarithmic bound on its mixing time by analysing corresponding\ncovariance matrices. Then we prove a constant gap of the perturbed Lindbladian\ncorresponding to interacting fermions up to some maximal coupling strength.\nThis is achieved by using theorems about stability of the gap for lattice\nfermions. Our methods apply at any constant temperature and independently of\nthe system size. The gap then provides an upper bound on the mixing time, and\nhence on the overall complexity of the quantum algorithm, proving that the\npurified Gibbs state of weakly interacting (quasi-)local fermionic systems of\nany dimension can be prepared in $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}} (n^3\n\\operatorname{polylog}(1/\\epsilon))$ time on $\\mathcal{O}(n)$ qubits, where $n$\ndenotes the size of the system and $\\epsilon$ the desired accuracy. As an\napplication, we explain how to calculate partition functions for the considered\nsystems. We provide exact numerical simulations for small system sizes\nsupporting the theory and also identify different suitable jump operators and\nfilter functions for the sought-after regime of intermediate coupling in the\nFermi-Hubbard model.",

Despite\nthis inefficiency, we revisit excitons in MoS$_2$ using rigorous\nfinite-momentum Bethe-Salpeter equation calculations to identify ways to\nenhance phonon-assisted recombination channels.

In frequency space, where $S_s(t)$ Fourier\ntransforms into the power spectrum $S_s(\\omega)$, the above two factors combine\nto suppress the zero frequency amplitude of $S_s(\\omega)$ by $(1+N\\chi_i)^2$,\nwhile at high frequency, sample shape dependence becomes negligible. These\nresults suggest simple and robust experimental tests of the\nfluctuation--dissipation theorem in magnetic systems that may be useful in\ndistinguishing bulk from surface effects.",

In this work, we extend this novel phase to three dimensions\nand thus propose a three-dimensional QAHE exhibiting richer and more versatile\ntransport behaviors. We first confirm this three-dimensional QAHE through the\nquantized Chern number, then establish its bulk-boundary correspondence, and\nfinally reaffirm it via the distinctive transport properties. Remarkably, we\nfind that the three-dimensional QAHE hosts two chiral surface states along one\nspatial direction while a pair of chiral hinge states along another direction,\nand the location of the hinge states depends sensitively on the Fermi energy.\nThese two types of boundary states are further connected through a\nperpendicular chiral surface states, whose chirality is also Fermi energy\ndependent. Consequently, depending on the transport direction, its Hall\nresistance can quantize to $0$, $h/e^2$, or $\\pm h/e^2$ when the Fermi energy\nis tuned across the charge neutral point. This three-dimensional QAHE not only\nfill the gap in the Hall effect family but also holds significant potentials in\ndevice applications such as in-memory computing.",

Here, we use the commuting network as a proxy for inter-city\ninteractions, integrating it with a general scaling framework to describe the\nincidence of seven infectious diseases across Brazilian cities as a function of\npopulation size and the number of commuters. Our models significantly\noutperform traditional urban scaling approaches, revealing that the\nrelationship between disease cases and a combination of population and\ncommuters varies across diseases and is influenced by both factors. Although\nmost cities exhibit a less-than-proportional increase in disease cases with\nchanges in population and commuters, more-than-proportional responses are also\nobserved across all diseases. Notably, in some small and isolated cities,\nproportional rises in population and commuters correlate with a reduction in\ndisease cases. These findings suggest that such towns may experience improved\nhealth outcomes and socioeconomic conditions as they grow and become more\nconnected. However, as growth and connectivity continue, these gains diminish,\neventually giving way to challenges typical of larger urban areas - such as\nsocioeconomic inequality and overcrowding - that facilitate the spread of\ninfectious diseases.

Recently, learning-based approaches obtain\ncompelling performance in animating diverse garments under versatile scenarios.\nNevertheless, to mimic the deformations of the observed garments, data-driven\nmethods require large scale of garment data, which are both resource-wise\nexpensive and time-consuming. In addition, forcing models to match the dynamics\nof observed garment animation may hinder the potentials to generalize to unseen\ncases. In this paper, instead of using garment-wise supervised-learning we\nadopt a disentangled scheme to learn how to animate observed garments: 1).\nlearning constitutive behaviors from the observed cloth; 2). dynamically\nanimate various garments constrained by the learned constitutive laws.\nSpecifically, we propose Energy Unit network (EUNet) to model the constitutive\nrelations in the format of energy. Without the priors from analytical physics\nmodels and differentiable simulation engines, EUNet is able to directly capture\nthe constitutive behaviors from the observed piece of cloth and uniformly\ndescribes the change of energy caused by deformations, such as stretching and\nbending. We further apply the pre-trained EUNet to animate various garments\nbased on energy optimizations. The disentangled scheme alleviates the need of\ngarment data and enables us to utilize the dynamics of a piece of cloth for\nanimating garments. Experiments show that while EUNet effectively delivers the\nenergy gradients due to the deformations, models constrained by EUNet achieve\nmore stable and physically plausible performance comparing with those trained\nin garment-wise supervised manner.

In this paper, we study\nthe electromagnetically induced atomic grating due to the vacuum state of the\nradiation field. Using an ensemble of cold atoms, strongly coupled to an\noptical cavity, we show that a probe field, propagating through the atomic\nmedium, diffracts to zeroth and first-order diffraction peaks with few photons\nand even by the electromagnetic vacuum field of the cavity mode. As the number\nof photons in the cavity increases, the intensity of the first-order\ndiffraction peak initially rises and then exhibits a decreasing trend.\nFurthermore, we observe that the first-order peak intensity reaches its maximum\nat resonance for both the vacuum and single-photon cavity state. However, as\nthe number of photons increases further, this peak at resonance transforms into\na dip, accompanied by two side peaks at off-resonance positions. This\ntransition from a peak to a dip may potentially be used to distinguish the\nquantum state of the cavity.",

    "abstract": "Random walks and Lorentz processes serve as fundamental models for Brownian\nmotion. The study of random walks is a favorite object of probability theory,\nwhereas that of Lorentz processes belongs to the theory of hyperbolic dynamical\nsystems. Here, we first present examples where the method based on the\nprobabilistic approach led to new insights into the study of the Lorentz\nprocess. Motivated by a 1981 question of Sinai about limiting laws for planar\nlocally perturbed Lorentz processes, we first derived that, in the plane, local\nperturbations of homogeneous random walks leave the limit laws and the limiting\nprocesses unchanged - independently whether the walk had bounded or unbounded\njumps. Afterward, we obtained probabilistic statements for local perturbations\nof planar Lorentz processes with finite horizon. (Similar statements for local\nperturbations of Lorentz processes with infinite horizon is a most interesting\nopen problem!) Often an interesting consequence of a local limit theorem for a\nprocess is the recurrence of the same process. In this way, our approach also\nprovides an alternative proof for a 2003 result of Lenci about the recurrence\nof the locally perturbed Lorentz processes with finite horizon. Afterward an\nunsolved problem, related to Sinai 1981 question, is formulated as an analogous\nproblem in the language of random walks.",

However, the majority of the prior\nart requires form-specific annotations to fine-tune the original model, leading\nto poor test-time generalizability. Meanwhile, existing training-free methods\nwork well only with simplified prompts and spatial conditions. In this work, we\npropose a novel yet generic test-time controllable generation method that aims\nat natural text prompts and complex conditions. Specifically, we decouple\nspatial conditions into semantic and geometric conditions and then enforce\ntheir consistency during the image-generation process individually. As for the\nformer, we target bridging the gap between the semantic condition and text\nprompts, as well as the gap between such condition and the attention map from\ndiffusion models. To achieve this, we propose to first complete the prompt\nw.r.t. semantic condition, and then remove the negative impact of distracting\nprompt words by measuring their statistics in attention maps as well as\ndistances in word space w.r.t. this condition. To further cope with the complex\ngeometric conditions, we introduce a geometric transform module, in which\nRegion-of-Interests will be identified in attention maps and further used to\ntranslate category-wise latents w.r.t. geometric condition. More importantly,\nwe propose a diffusion-based latents-refill method to explicitly remove the\nimpact of latents at the RoI, reducing the artifacts on generated images.\nExperiments on Coco-stuff dataset showcase 30$\\%$ relative boost compared to\nSOTA training-free methods on layout consistency evaluation metrics.",

The Floer chain complex is\ngenerated by Nahm pole solutions of the Kapustin-Witten equations on\n$\\mathbb{R}^3 \\times \\mathbb{R}^+_y$ with an additional monopole-like singular\nbehaviour along the knot $K$ inside the three-dimensional boundary at $y=0$.\nThe Floer differential is given by counting solutions of the Haydys-Witten\nequations that interpolate between Kapustin-Witten solutions along an\nadditional flow direction $\\mathbb{R}_s$. This article investigates solutions\nof a decoupled version of the Kapustin-Witten and Haydys-Witten equations on\n$\\mathbb{R}_s \\times \\mathbb{R}^3 \\times \\mathbb{R}^+_y$, which in contrast to\nthe full equations exhibit a Hermitian Yang-Mills structure and can be viewed\nas a lift of the extended Bogomolny equations (EBE) from three to five\ndimensions.

In this study, we develop an approach to synthesize a class of\nadditive feedback controllers for automated vehicles (AVs) to smooth nonlinear\nmixed traffic flow, including both AVs and human-driven vehicles (HVs). Unlike\nrecent explicit AV controllers that rely on strict assumptions such as\ntime-varying equilibrium traffic speed, our proposed AV controller requires\nonly local traffic information, such as inter-vehicle spacing and relative\nspeed, which are readily available through AV onboard sensors. Essentially, it\nallows a controlled AV to track a subtler version of the perturbed speed\nprofile resulting from its preceding vehicle, thereby enabling smoother traffic\nflow. Additionally, we provide a method for selecting the optimal control\nparameters to achieve traffic-smoothing effects efficiently. These unique\nfeatures of the developed AV controller ensure much higher implementability. We\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach through simulations of\ntwo distinct traffic scenarios with varying levels of oscillation. The results\nshow that AVs using the proposed controller are capable of effectively reducing\ntraffic oscillations and lowering vehicle fuel consumption by up to 46.78\\% and\n2.74\\%, respectively, for a platoon of 10 vehicles.

The detector includes a magnet based on a\n6 m diameter superconducting coil operating at a current of 18.164 kA. This\ncurrent creates a central magnetic flux density of 3.8 T that allows for the\nhigh-precision measurement of the momenta of the produced charged particles\nusing tracking and muon subdetectors. The CMS magnet contains a 10,000 ton\nflux-return yoke made from the construction steel blocks. These blocks are\nmagnetized, with the coil returned magnetic flux and wrap the muons escaping\nthe hadronic calorimeters. To describe the distribution of the magnetic flux in\nthe magnet yoke layers, a three-dimensional computer model of the CMS magnet is\nused. To validate the calculations, special measurements are performed, with\nthe flux loops wound in 22 cross-sections of the flux-return yoke blocks. The\nmeasured voltages induced in the flux loops during the CMS magnet current\nvariations, are integrated over time to obtain the initial magnetic flux\ndensities in the flux loop cross-sections. In the last time, three fast\ndischarges occurred during the standard ramp-downs of the magnet. This allows\nus to single out the contributions of the eddy currents, induced in steel, to\nthe flux loop voltages. Accounting for these contributions to the flux loop\nmeasurements during intentionally triggered fast discharges in 2006 allows us\nto perform the validation of the CMS magnet computer model with better\nprecision.

To this end, we investigate the problem of maintaining faithful\nintegrity in LLMs. This involves ensuring that LLMs adhere to their faithful\nstatements in the face of opposing arguments and are able to correct their\nincorrect statements when presented with faithful arguments. In this work, we\npropose a novel framework, named Alignment for Faithful Integrity with\nConfidence Estimation (AFICE), which aims to align the LLM responses with\nfaithful integrity. Specifically, AFICE first designs a Bilateral Confidence\nEstimation (BCE) approach for estimating the uncertainty of each response\ngenerated by the LLM given a specific context, which simultaneously estimate\nthe model's confidence to the question based on the internal states during\ndecoding as well as to the answer based on cumulative probability ratios.

A\nhypervisor, a layer of software running on top of the host operating system,\ntypically runs and manages these different guest operating systems. Rather than\nto run different services on different servers for reliability and security\nreasons, companies started to employ virtualization over their servers to run\nthese services within a single server. This approach proves beneficial to the\ncompanies as it provides much better reliability, stronger isolation, improved\nsecurity and resource utilization compared to running services on multiple\nservers. Although hypervisor based virtualization offers better resource\nutilization and stronger isolation, it also suffers from high overhead as the\nhost operating system has to maintain different guest operating systems.\n  To tackle this issue, another form of virtualization known as Operating\nSystem-level virtualization has emerged. This virtualization provides\nlight-weight, minimal and efficient virtualization, as the different instances\nare run on top of the same host operating system, sharing the resources of the\nhost operating system. But due to instances sharing the same host operating\nsystem affects the isolation of the instances. In this paper, we will first\nestablish the basic concepts of virtualization and point out the differences\nbetween the hyper-visor based virtualization and operating system-level\nvirtualization. Next, we will discuss the container creation life-cycle which\nhelps in forming a container threat model for the container systems, which\nallows to map different potential attack vectors within these systems.

Recent Parker Solar Probe (PSP) and Solar Orbiter (SO)\nobservations have added one more ingredient to the known non-thermal features,\nthe deficit-a depletion in the sunward region of the VDF, already predicted by\nexospheric models but never so extensively observed. By employing\nParticle-in-Cell simulations, we study electron VDFs that reproduce those\ntypically observed in the inner heliosphere and investigate whether the\nelectron deficit may contribute to the onset of kinetic instabilities. Previous\nstudies and in-situ observations show that strahl electrons drive oblique\nwhistler waves unstable, which in turn scatter them. As a result, suprathermal\nelectrons can occupy regions of phase space where they fulfil resonance\nconditions with the parallel-propagating whistler wave. The suprathermal\nelectrons lose kinetic energy, resulting in the generation of unstable waves.\nThe sunward side of the VDF, initially depleted of electrons, is gradually\nfilled, as this wave-particle interaction process, triggered by the depletion\nitself, takes place. Our findings are compared and validated against current\nPSP and SO observations: among others, our study provides a mechanism\nexplaining the presence in the heliosphere of regularly observed parallel\nanti-sunward whistler waves; suggests why these waves are frequently observed\nin concomitant with distributions presenting an electron deficit; describes a\nnon-collisional heat flux regulating process.",

We utilize an orthogonal factor\nloading matrix that avoids computing the inversion of the posterior covariance\nmatrix at each time of the Kalman filter, and derive closed-form expressions in\nan expectation-maximization algorithm for parameter estimation, which\nsubstantially reduces the computational complexity without approximation. Our\nstudy is motivated by inversely estimating slow slip events from geodetic data,\nsuch as continuous GPS measurements. Extensive simulated studies illustrate\nhigher accuracy and scalability of our approach compared to alternatives. By\napplying our method to geodetic measurements in the Cascadia region, our\nestimated slip better agrees with independently measured seismic data of tremor\nevents. The substantial acceleration from our method enables the use of massive\nnoisy data for geological hazard quantification and other applications.",

    "abstract": "For millions of adults with mobility limitations, eating meals is a daily\nchallenge. A variety of robotic systems have been developed to address this\nsocietal need. Unfortunately, end-user adoption of robot-assisted feeding is\nlimited, in part because existing devices are unable to seamlessly grasp,\nmanipulate, and feed diverse foods. Recent works seek to address this issue by\ncreating new algorithms for food acquisition and bite transfer. In parallel to\nthese algorithmic developments, however, we hypothesize that mechanical\nintelligence will make it fundamentally easier for robot arms to feed humans.\nWe therefore propose Kiri-Spoon, a soft utensil specifically designed for\nrobot-assisted feeding. Kiri-Spoon consists of a spoon-shaped kirigami\nstructure: when actuated, the kirigami sheet deforms into a bowl of increasing\ncurvature. Robot arms equipped with Kiri-Spoon can leverage the kirigami\nstructure to wrap-around morsels during acquisition, contain those items as the\nrobot moves, and then compliantly release the food into the user's mouth.\nOverall, Kiri-Spoon combines the familiar and comfortable shape of a standard\nspoon with the increased capabilities of soft robotic grippers. In what\nfollows, we first apply a stakeholder-driven design process to ensure that\nKiri-Spoon meets the needs of caregivers and users with physical disabilities.\nWe next characterize the dynamics of Kiri-Spoon, and derive a mechanics model\nto relate actuation force to the spoon's shape. The paper concludes with three\nseparate experiments that evaluate (a) the mechanical advantage provided by\nKiri-Spoon, (b) the ways users with disabilities perceive our system, and (c)\nhow the mechanical intelligence of Kiri-Spoon complements state-of-the-art\nalgorithms. Our results suggest that Kiri-Spoon advances robot-assisted feeding\nacross diverse foods, multiple robotic platforms, and different manipulation\nalgorithms.",

Previous models of large PMS X-ray flares,\nlacking direct magnetic field measurements, showed discrepancies from this\nbaseline law, which MHD simulations attribute to unusually strong magnetic\nfields during flares. To test this, we used nearly simultaneous Chandra X-ray\nand HET-HPF near-infrared observations of four young Orion stars, measuring\nsurface magnetic fields during or just after powerful PMS X-ray flares. We also\nmodeled these PMS X-ray flares, incorporating their measured magnetic field\nstrengths. Our findings reveal magnetic field strengths at the stellar surface\ntypical of non-flaring PMS stars, ruling out the need for abnormally strong\nfields during flares. Both PMS and solar flares deviate from the Lx-Phi law,\nwith PMS flares exhibiting a more pronounced deviation, primarily due to their\nmuch larger active regions on the surface and larger flaring loop volumes above\nthe surface compared to their solar counterparts. These deviations likely stem\nfrom the fact that powerful flares are driven by magnetic reconnection, while\nbaseline X-ray emission may involve less efficient mechanisms like Alfven wave\nheating. Our results also indicate a preference for dipolar magnetic loops in\nPMS flares, consistent with Zeeman-Doppler imaging of fully convective stars.\nThis requirement for giant dipolar loops aligns with MHD predictions of strong\ndipoles supported by polar magnetic surface active regions in fast-rotating,\nfully convective stars.",

Previous works have shown that\ndifficult-to-learn examples (well-recognized in supervised learning as examples\naround the decision boundary), which are essential in supervised learning,\ncontribute minimally in unsupervised settings. In this paper, perhaps\nsurprisingly, we find that the direct removal of difficult-to-learn examples,\nalthough reduces the sample size, can boost the downstream classification\nperformance of contrastive learning. To uncover the reasons behind this, we\ndevelop a theoretical framework modeling the similarity between different pairs\nof samples. Guided by this theoretical framework, we conduct a thorough\ntheoretical analysis revealing that the presence of difficult-to-learn examples\nnegatively affects the generalization of contrastive learning. Furthermore, we\ndemonstrate that the removal of these examples, and techniques such as margin\ntuning and temperature scaling can enhance its generalization bounds, thereby\nimproving performance.

This thesis manuscript is an attempt at applying Mazur's\nstrategy to determine the rational points of $Y_E(p)$. One of the results that\nwe prove, as a consequence of the approach, is the following: if\n$E,F/\\mathbb{Q}$ are elliptic curves with isomorphic $23$-torsion Galois\nmodules and $E$ has Weierstrass equation $y^2=x^3-23$, then $E$ and $F$ are\nisogenous.\n  In Chapter 1, we prove the existence of the curve $Y_E(p)$ and its\ncompactification $X_E(p)$ over more general bases as moduli schemes in the\nsense of Katz-Mazur, describe their Hecke correspondences, and construct\n$X_E(p)$ as a Galois twist of $X(p)$. In Chapters 2 and 3, we determine the\nTate module of the Jacobians $J_E^{\\alpha}(p)$ of the connected components of\n$X_E(p)$, thereby refining a result by Virdol.\n  In Chapter 4, we study the factors of the $L$-function of $J_E^{\\alpha}(p)$\npreviously determined. In general, little can be said, because proving the\nautomorphy of the Galois representations involved seems currently out of reach.\nHowever, under suitable automorphy assumptions, we determine the signs of the\nfunctional equations satisfied by these $L$-functions.\n  In Chapter 5, we discuss the special case where the image of the Galois\naction on $E[p]$ is contained in the normalizer of a nonsplit Cartan subgroup.\nThe factors of $L(J_E^{\\alpha}(p),s)$ then satisfy functional equations whose\nsigns we determine. Using the Beilinson-Flach Euler system and results about\nlarge Galois image (from Chapter 6), we show that most factors of\n$J_E^{\\alpha}(p)$ satisfy the Bloch-Kato in rank zero, and prove a formal\nimmersion theorem for certain factors at all but an easily computable set of\nprimes.",

These long-term trends\nmay originate from the dynamics of a supermassive black hole binary system, or\nthey could be the result of intrinsic phenomena within the jet itself. Our\nfindings can help in addressing questions pertaining to the astrophysical\norigins of variability and periodicity within jetted AGN.",

    "abstract": "Using the ground states of the Bose- and Fermi-Hubbard model as the battery's\ninitial state, we demonstrate that using the Wannier-Stark (WS) field for\ncharging in addition to onsite interactions can increase the maximum power of\nthe battery. Although the benefit is not ubiquitous, bosonic batteries are more\naffected by the WS field than fermionic ones. In particular, there exists a\ncritical WS field strength above which the power gets increased in the battery.\nFurther, we determine a closed form expression of the stored work when the\nbattery is in the ground state of the Bose- and Fermi-Hubbard model with only\nhopping term and the charging is carried out with onsite interactions and WS\nfield irrespective of lattice-size of the battery. Moreover, we exhibit that it\nis possible to extract work in the fermionic batteries even without charging\nwhen the edge sites are attached to two local thermal baths having high\ntemperatures -- this process we refer to as {\\it environment-assisted\nergotropy}. Note, however, that the bosonic batteries are able to exhibit such\nan environmental benefit in the transient regime when the lattice-size is\nincreased and when Wannier-Stark field is present. Nonetheless, if the onsite\ninteraction or WS potential with a critical strength is utilized as a charger,\nenergy can be stored and extracted from both bosonic and fermionic batteries in\nthe presence of the thermal baths.",

We proposed and proved a theorem\ndescribing the location of unstable circular null orbits for all such Kerr-like\nmetrics. The deviation between the shadows of the Kerr and quantum corrected\nKerr black holes has also been studied, and parameters are constrained by\ncomparison with the EHT results for M87* and Sgr A* to precisely probe the\nquantity of deviation due to quantum correction. Lastly, we immersed the\nquantum corrected Kerr black hole in an inhomogeneous plasma and studied its\nimpact on the shadow size. We found that the unstable null orbits for the\nquantum corrected Kerr black hole are always smaller than the unstable null\norbits for Kerr black hole. The effect of Barbero-Immirzi parameter allows the\nquantum corrected Kerr black hole to mimic Sgr A* with a higher probability\nthan the Kerr black hole. However, the quantum corrected Kerr black hole does\nnot mimic M87*. The plasma reduces the size of the shadow of quantum corrected\nblack hole, and the plasma parameter in the case II is more sensitive than that\nin case I.",

    "abstract": "Recently, the increasing deployment of LEO satellite systems has enabled\nvarious space analytics (e.g., crop and climate monitoring), which heavily\nrelies on the advancements in deep learning (DL). However, the intermittent\nconnectivity between LEO satellites and ground station (GS) significantly\nhinders the timely transmission of raw data to GS for centralized learning,\nwhile the scaled-up DL models hamper distributed learning on\nresource-constrained LEO satellites. Though split learning (SL) can be a\npotential solution to these problems by partitioning a model and offloading\nprimary training workload to GS, the labor-intensive labeling process remains\nan obstacle, with intermittent connectivity and data heterogeneity being other\nchallenges. In this paper, we propose LEO-Split, a semi-supervised (SS) SL\ndesign tailored for satellite networks to combat these challenges. Leveraging\nSS learning to handle (labeled) data scarcity, we construct an auxiliary model\nto tackle the training failure of the satellite-GS non-contact time. Moreover,\nwe propose a pseudo-labeling algorithm to rectify data imbalances across\nsatellites. Lastly, an adaptive activation interpolation scheme is devised to\nprevent the overfitting of server-side sub-model training at GS. Extensive\nexperiments with real-world LEO satellite traces (e.g., Starlink) demonstrate\nthat our LEO-Split framework achieves superior performance compared to\nstate-ofthe-art benchmarks.",

Under\ncontinuous excitation, QDs emit photons with intricate intensity fluctuation:\nthe intensity of photon emission fluctuates during the excitation, and such a\nfluctuation pattern can vary across different QDs even under the same\nexperimental conditions. What adding to the complication is that the processed\nintensity series are non-Gaussian and truncated due to necessary thresholding\nand normalization. Conventional normality-based single-dot analysis fall short\nof addressing these complexities. In collaboration with chemists, we develop an\nintegrative learning approach to simultaneously analyzing intensity series from\nmultiple QDs. Motivated by the unique data structure and the hypothesized\nbehaviors of the QDs, our approach leverages the celebrated hidden Markov model\nas its structural backbone to characterize individual dot intensity\nfluctuations, while assuming that, in each state the normalized intensity\nfollows a 0/1 inflated Beta distribution, the state/emission distributions are\nshared across the QDs, and the state transition dynamics can vary among a few\nQD clusters. This framework allows for a precise, collective characterization\nof intensity fluctuation patterns and have the potential to transform current\npractice in chemistry. Applying our method to experimental data from 128 QDs,\nwe reveal three shared intensity states and capture several distinct intensity\ntransition patterns, underscoring the effectiveness of our approach in\nproviding deeper insights into QD behaviors and their design and application\npotential.",

To this end, we identify the\nrequirements for stationary bandit algorithms and change detectors in a CDB\nprocedure that are needed for the modularization.

    "abstract": "Augmented Reality (AR) functionalities may be effectively leveraged in\ncollaborative service scenarios (e.g., remote maintenance, on-site building,\nstreet gaming, etc.). Standard development cycles for collaborative AR require\nto code for each specific visualization platform and implement the necessary\ncontrol mechanisms over the shared assets. This paper describes SARA, an\narchitecture to support cross-platform collaborative Augmented Reality\napplications based on microservices. The architecture is designed to work over\nthe concept of collaboration models (turn, layer, ownership,hierarchy-based and\nunconstrained examples) which regulate the interaction and permissions of each\nuser over the AR assets. Thanks to the reusability of its components, during\nthe development of an application, SARA enables focusing on the application\nlogic while avoiding the implementation of the communication protocol, data\nmodel handling and orchestration between the different, possibly\nheterogeneous,devices involved in the collaboration (i.e., mobile or wearable\nAR devices using different operating systems). To describe how to build an\napplication based on SARA, a prototype for HoloLens and iOS devices has been\nimplemented. the prototype is a collaborative voxel-based game in which several\nplayers work real time together on a piece of land, adding or eliminating cubes\nin a collaborative manner to create buildings and landscapes. Turn-based and\nunconstrained collaboration models are applied to regulate the interaction, the\ndevelopment workflow for this case study shows how the architecture serves as a\nframework to support the deployment of collaborative AR services, enabling the\nreuse of collaboration model components, agnostically handling client\ntechnologies.",

Although previous\nstudies have attempted to generate bias-free summaries from multiperspective\nnews articles, they have not effectively addressed the challenge of mitigating\ninherent media bias. To address this gap, we propose \\textbf{NeutraSum}, a\nnovel framework that integrates two neutrality losses to adjust the semantic\nspace of generated summaries, thus minimising media bias. These losses,\ndesigned to balance the semantic distances across polarised inputs and ensure\nalignment with expert-written summaries, guide the generation of neutral and\nfactually rich summaries.

The results showed that the predicted contribution of each marketing\nchannel is aligned with A/B test performance and is actionable. Furthermore, we\nconducted several scenario analyses using convex optimization to test the\nsensitivity of the model to different assumptions and to evaluate the impact of\nchanges in the marketing mix on sales. The insights gained from the model\nallowed Lemonade to adjust their marketing strategy and allocate their budget\nmore effectively. Our case study demonstrates the benefits of using Bayesian\nMMM for marketing attribution and optimization in a data-driven company like\nLemonade. The approach is flexible, interpretable, and can provide valuable\ninsights for decision-making.",

Although\ncomputationally efficient, they often lack adaptability to varying traffic\nscenarios and require extensive manual design and parameter tuning. To address\nthese issues, we propose a novel 3D multi-object tracking approach for\nvehicles, HybridTrack, which integrates a data-driven Kalman Filter (KF) within\na tracking-by-detection paradigm. In particular, it learns the transition\nresidual and Kalman gain directly from data, which eliminates the need for\nmanual motion and stochastic parameter modeling. Validated on the real-world\nKITTI dataset, HybridTrack achieves 82.72% HOTA accuracy, significantly\noutperforming state-of-the-art methods. We also evaluate our method under\ndifferent configurations, achieving the fastest processing speed of 112 FPS.\nConsequently, HybridTrack eliminates the dependency on scene-specific designs\nwhile improving performance and maintaining real-time efficiency.

Specifically, we\nanalyze three text sets: original human-written texts ($\\mathcal{O}$), their\nLLM-paraphrased versions ($\\mathcal{G}$), and a twice-paraphrased set\n($\\mathcal{S}$) derived from $\\mathcal{G}$. Our analysis addresses two key\nquestions: (1) Is the difference in latent community structures between\n$\\mathcal{O}$ and $\\mathcal{G}$ the same as that between $\\mathcal{G}$ and\n$\\mathcal{S}$? (2) Does $\\mathcal{G}$ become more similar to $\\mathcal{O}$ as\nthe LLM parameter controlling text variability is adjusted? The first question\nis based on the assumption that if LLM-generated text truly resembles human\nlanguage, then the gap between the pair ($\\mathcal{O}$, $\\mathcal{G}$) should\nbe similar to that between the pair ($\\mathcal{G}$, $\\mathcal{S}$), as both\npairs consist of an original text and its paraphrase. The second question\nexamines whether the degree of similarity between LLM-generated and human text\nvaries with changes in the breadth of text generation. To address these\nquestions, we propose a statistical hypothesis testing framework that leverages\nthe fact that each text has corresponding parts across all datasets due to\ntheir paraphrasing relationship. This relationship enables the mapping of one\ndataset's relative position to another, allowing two datasets to be mapped to a\nthird dataset. As a result, both mapped datasets can be quantified with respect\nto the space characterized by the third dataset, facilitating a direct\ncomparison between them.

One of the main objectives of such research is the\nneed to evaluate the behavior of climate effects in certain regions across a\nperiod of time. When certain climate patterns appear for several days or even\nweeks, causing the areas affected by them to have the same kind of weather for\nan extended period of time, the use of blocks for these phenomena may be a good\nstrategy. Additionally, having repeated measures for observations within blocks\nhelps to control for differences between observations, thus gaining more\nstatistical power. In view of these perspectives, this study presents a\nspatio-temporal regression model with block structure with repeated measures\nincorporating as predictors functional variables of fixed and random nature. To\naccommodate complex spatial, temporal and block structures, functional\ncomponents based on random effects were considered in addition to the class\nMat\\'ern covariance structure, which was responsible to account for spatial\ncovariance. This work is motivated by a precipitation dataset collected monthly\nfrom various meteorological stations in Goi\\'as State, Brazil, covering the\nyears 1980 to 2001 (21 years). In this framework, spatial effects are\nrepresented by individual meteorological stations, temporal effects by months,\nblock effects by climate patterns, and repeated measures by the years within\nthose patterns.

Many deep learning (DL) models\nare now embedded in mobile apps, making them more accessible to end users\nthrough on-device DL. However, deploying on-device DL to users' smartphones\nsimultaneously introduces several security threats. One primary threat is\nbackdoor attacks. Extensive research has explored backdoor attacks for several\nyears and has proposed numerous attack approaches. However, few studies have\ninvestigated backdoor attacks on DL models deployed in the real world, or they\nhave shown obvious deficiencies in effectiveness and stealthiness. In this\nwork, we explore more effective and stealthy backdoor attacks on real-world DL\nmodels extracted from mobile apps. Our main justification is that imperceptible\nand sample-specific backdoor triggers generated by DNN-based steganography can\nenhance the efficacy of backdoor attacks on real-world models. We first confirm\nthe effectiveness of steganography-based backdoor attacks on four\nstate-of-the-art DNN models. Subsequently, we systematically evaluate and\nanalyze the stealthiness of the attacks to ensure they are difficult to\nperceive. Finally, we implement the backdoor attacks on real-world models and\ncompare our approach with three baseline methods. We collect 38,387 mobile\napps, extract 89 DL models from them, and analyze these models to obtain the\nprerequisite model information for the attacks. After identifying the target\nmodels, our approach achieves an average of 12.50% higher attack success rate\nthan DeepPayload while better maintaining the normal performance of the models.\nExtensive experimental results demonstrate that our method enables more\neffective, robust, and stealthy backdoor attacks on real-world models.",

However, the inherent nonlinear and\nill-posed characteristics of HSI reconstruction still pose challenges to\nexisting methods in terms of accuracy and stability. To address this issue, we\npropose a Mamba-inspired Joint Unfolding Network (MiJUN), which integrates\nphysics-embedded DUNs with learning-based HSI imaging. Firstly, leveraging the\nconcept of trapezoid discretization to expand the representation space of\nunfolding networks, we introduce an accelerated unfolding network scheme. This\napproach can be interpreted as a generalized accelerated half-quadratic\nsplitting with a second-order differential equation, which reduces the reliance\non initial optimization stages and addresses challenges related to long-range\ninteractions. Crucially, within the Mamba framework, we restructure the\nMamba-inspired global-to-local attention mechanism by incorporating a selective\nstate space model and an attention mechanism.

Therefore, we propose an adaptive hybrid FFT, which leverages the\nstrengths of both pipelined and memory-based architectures. In this paper, we\npropose an adaptive hybrid FFT processor that combines the advantages of both\narchitectures, and it has the following features. First, a set of radix-$2^k$\nmulti-path delay commutators (MDC) units are developed to support\nhigh-performance large-size processing. Second, a conflict-free memory access\nscheme is formulated to ensure a continuous data flow without data contention.\nThird, We demonstrate the existence of a series of bit-dimension permutations\nfor reordering input data, satisfying the generalized constraints of\nvariable-length, high-radix, and any level of parallelism for wide adaptivity.\nFurthermore, the proposed FFT processor has been implemented on a\nfield-programmable gate array (FPGA). As a result, the proposed work\noutperforms conventional memory-based FFT processors by requiring fewer\ncomputation cycles.

Verbal and mathematical models of\nthe task of constructing a hierarchy of tasks and other tasks that take place\nat the stage of project planning were constructed. Such indicators of the\nproject implementation process efficiency were introduced as the time, cost,\nand cost-time efficiency. In order to be able to apply these criteria, the\ntasks of estimating the minimum value of the duration of the project and its\nminimum required cost were considered. Appropriate methods have been developed\nto solve them. The developed iterative method for assessing the minimum\nduration of project implementation is based on taking into account the\npossibility of simultaneous execution of various tasks. The method of\nestimating the minimum cost of the project is to build and solve the problem of\nBoolean programming. The values obtained as a result of solving these problems\nform an {\\guillemotleft}ideal point{\\guillemotright}, approaching which is\nenabled by the developed iterative method of constructing a hierarchy of tasks\nbased on the method of sequential concessions.

This avenue prompts\nus to reconsider nanoscale hydrodynamic flows under the perspective of\ninteracting excitations, akin to condensed matter frameworks. Here we show,\nusing a combination of many-body theory and molecular simulations, that the\nflow of a liquid can induce the flow of another liquid behind a separating\nwall, at odds with the prediction of continuum hydrodynamics. We further show\nthat the range of this 'flow tunnelling' can be tuned through the solid's\nelectronic excitations, with a maximum occurring when these are at resonance\nwith the liquid's charge density fluctuations. Flow tunnelling is expected to\nplay a role in global transport across nanoscale fluidic networks, such as\nlamellar graphene oxide or MXene membranes.

ABPs move persistently at a constant speed $V$ along\na direction that changes slowly by rotational diffusion, characterized by a\ncoefficient $\\Dr$. Persistent motion plus random reorientations generate a\nrandom walk at long times with a diffusion coefficient that, for isolated ABPs\nin two dimensions, is given by $D_0=V^2/(2\\Dr)$. Here we study the density\neffects on the self-diffusive dynamics using a recently proposed kinetic theory\nfor ABPs, in which persistent collisions are described as producing a net\ndisplacement on the particles. On intermediate timescales, where many\ncollisions have taken place but the director of the tracer particle has not yet\nchanged, it is possible to solve the Lorentz kinetic equation for a tracer\nparticle. It turns out that, as a result of collisions, the tracer follows an\neffective stochastic dynamics, characterized by an effective reduced streaming\nvelocity $V_\\text{eff}$ and anisotropic diffusion, with coefficients explicitly\ndepending on the density. Based on this result, an effective theoretical and\nnumerical approach is proposed in which the particles in a bath follow\nstochastic dynamics with mean-field interactions based on the local density.\nFinally, on time scales larger than $\\Dr^{-1}$, studying the van Hove function\nat small wavevectors, it is shown that the tracer particle presents an\neffective diffusive motion with a coefficient $D=V_\\text{eff}^2/(2\\Dr)$. The\ndependence of $V_\\text{eff}$ on the density indicates that the kinetic theory\nis limited to area fractions smaller than 0.42, and beyond this limit\nunphysical results appear.",

While recent developments, driven by powerful large language models\n(LLMs), aim to be general enough to cover a wide range of categories, they\noften overlook the need for more specific capabilities.

Given the high costs of annotating\nfine-grained labels and the substantial data needed for fine-tuning LLMs, we\npropose to adopt semi-supervised learning (SSL). Our framework, SeFAR,\nincorporates several innovative designs to tackle these challenges.\nSpecifically, to capture sufficient visual details, we construct Dual-level\ntemporal elements as more effective representations, based on which we design a\nnew strong augmentation strategy for the Teacher-Student learning paradigm\nthrough involving moderate temporal perturbation. Furthermore, to handle the\nhigh uncertainty within the teacher model's predictions for FAR, we propose the\nAdaptive Regulation to stabilize the learning process. Experiments show that\nSeFAR achieves state-of-the-art performance on two FAR datasets, FineGym and\nFineDiving, across various data scopes.

    "abstract": "Transformer based models are increasingly being used in various domains\nincluding recommender systems (RS). Pretrained transformer models such as BERT\nhave shown good performance at language modelling. With the greater ability to\nmodel sequential tasks, variants of Encoder-only models (like BERT4Rec, SASRec\netc.) have found success in sequential RS problems. Computing dot-product\nattention in traditional transformer models has quadratic complexity in\nsequence length. This is a bigger problem with RS because unlike language\nmodels, new items are added to the catalogue every day. User buying history is\na dynamic sequence which depends on multiple factors. Recently, various linear\nattention models have tried to solve this problem by making the model linear in\nsequence length (token dimensions). Hydra attention is one such linear\ncomplexity model proposed for vision transformers which reduces the complexity\nof attention for both the number of tokens as well as model embedding\ndimensions. Building on the idea of Hydra attention, we introduce an efficient\nTransformer based Sequential RS (HydraRec) which significantly improves\ntheoretical complexity of computing attention for longer sequences and bigger\ndatasets while preserving the temporal context. Extensive experiments are\nconducted to evaluate other linear transformer-based RS models and compared\nwith HydraRec across various evaluation metrics.

To tackle this, we propose enhanced differential\ntesting to uncover various bugs in emerging SQL-like database systems. The\nchallenge is how to deal with differences of these emerging databases. Our\ninsight is that many emerging database systems are conceptually extensions of\nrelational database systems, making it possible to reveal logic bugs leveraging\nexisting relational, known-reliable database systems. However, due to\ninevitable syntax or semantics gaps, it remains challenging to scale\ndifferential testing to various emerging database systems.

We implemented\nour approach in a tool called SQLxDiff and applied it to four popular emerging\ndatabase systems.

    "abstract": "Face Restoration (FR) is a crucial area within image and video processing,\nfocusing on reconstructing high-quality portraits from degraded inputs. Despite\nadvancements in image FR, video FR remains relatively under-explored, primarily\ndue to challenges related to temporal consistency, motion artifacts, and the\nlimited availability of high-quality video data. Moreover, traditional face\nrestoration typically prioritizes enhancing resolution and may not give as much\nconsideration to related tasks such as facial colorization and inpainting. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel approach for the Generalized Video Face\nRestoration (GVFR) task, which integrates video BFR, inpainting, and\ncolorization tasks that we empirically show to benefit each other. We present a\nunified framework, termed as stable video face restoration (SVFR), which\nleverages the generative and motion priors of Stable Video Diffusion (SVD) and\nincorporates task-specific information through a unified face restoration\nframework. A learnable task embedding is introduced to enhance task\nidentification. Meanwhile, a novel Unified Latent Regularization (ULR) is\nemployed to encourage the shared feature representation learning among\ndifferent subtasks. To further enhance the restoration quality and temporal\nstability, we introduce the facial prior learning and the self-referred\nrefinement as auxiliary strategies used for both training and inference. The\nproposed framework effectively combines the complementary strengths of these\ntasks, enhancing temporal coherence and achieving superior restoration quality.\nThis work advances the state-of-the-art in video FR and establishes a new\nparadigm for generalized video face restoration.

These trainable codecs have many\nadvantages over traditional techniques, such as their straightforward\nadaptation to perceptual distortion metrics and high performance in specific\nfields thanks to their learning ability. However, current state-of-the-art\nneural codecs do not fully exploit the benefits of vector quantization and the\nexistence of the entropy gradient in decoding devices. In this paper, we\npropose to leverage these two properties (vector quantization and entropy\ngradient) to improve the performance of off-the-shelf codecs. Firstly, we\ndemonstrate that using non-uniform scalar quantization cannot improve\nperformance over uniform quantization. We thus suggest using predefined optimal\nuniform vector quantization to improve performance. Secondly, we show that the\nentropy gradient, available at the decoder, is correlated with the\nreconstruction error gradient, which is not available at the decoder. We\ntherefore use the former as a proxy to enhance compression performance. Our\nexperimental results show that these approaches save between 1 to 3% of the\nrate for the same quality across various pretrained methods. In addition, the\nentropy gradient based solution improves traditional codec performance\nsignificantly as well.",

This\nphenomenon is characterized by the abrupt halt of norm growth, as observed in\nthe linear Hatano-Nelson model, and can be interpreted as a stopping of\nconvective motion arising from self-induced disorder in the lattice.",

With the\nembedded-shear-layer scaling, self-similarity is observed for the mean velocity\nand all three components of turbulence intensity. The azimuthal-wavenumber\nspectra of streamwise velocity fluctuations possess two peaks in the\nwall-normal direction, an inner peak at the wavelength of approximately 100\nwall units and an outer peak in the wake region with growing strength,\nwavelength and distance to the wall in the downstream direction. Two-point\ncorrelations of streamwise velocity fluctuations show significant downstream\ngrowth and elongation of turbulence structures with increasing inclination\nangle. However, relative to the boundary-layer thickness, the correlation\nstructures decrease in size in the downstream direction.

The interplay between mass and environmental density during\nthis period drives diverse and distinct evolutionary pathways. Our analysis\nshows that majority of the main progenitor branches of the present-day GV\ngalaxies entered the green valley at $z<1$. We also find that a small fraction\n($\\sim 5\\%$) of the main progenitor branches had already crossed the green\nvalley and joined the red sequence by $z=0.1$, indicating that some galaxies\nmay undergo late-time rejuvenation, that allows them to reenter the green\nvalley by the present day. Our findings provide a comprehensive view of the\nmechanisms shaping the GV population across cosmic time.",

    "abstract": "Changes in room acoustics, such as modifications to surface absorption or the\ninsertion of a scattering object, significantly impact measured room impulse\nresponses (RIRs). These changes can affect the performance of systems used in\necho cancellation and active acoustics and support tasks such as navigation and\nobject tracking. Recognizing and quantifying such changes is, therefore,\ncritical for advancing technologies based on room acoustics. This study\nintroduces a method for analyzing acoustic environment changes by evaluating\nthe similarity of consecutively recorded RIRs. Short-time coherence is employed\nto characterize modifications, including changes in wall absorption or the\npresence of a moving person in the room. A sensitivity rating is further used\nto quantify the magnitude of these changes. The results clearly differentiate\nbetween types of modifications -- atmospheric variation, changes in absorption,\nand human presence. The methods described provide a novel approach to analyzing\nand interpreting room acoustics, emphasizing RIR similarity and extracting\ninformation from temporal and spectral signal properties.",

A promising\nand versatile method for high-power THz generation is optical rectification in\nnonlinear crystals pumped by powerful near-infrared ultrafast laser systems. In\nthis context, ytterbium-based laser sources are particularly advantageous in\nterms of power scalability and technology establishment. However, as the\nrepetition rate increases toward hundreds of MHz, the conversion efficiency\ntypically decreases, as most laser systems do not reach sufficiently high\naverage power to correspondingly enhance the peak power to drive the nonlinear\nconversion process efficiently. An alternative approach to achieving\nsufficiently high average power at high repetition rate is based on passive\nenhancement cavities, which boost the pulse energy of standard watt-level\nytterbium lasers by orders of magnitude. We present the first demonstration of\noptical rectification in a passive enhancement cavity at multi-kW levels,\nachieved by a 240-fold power enhancement.

This has motivated the authors\nin this paper to introduce a game between the model attacker and the model\ndefender for trigger-based black-box model watermarking. For each of the two\nplayers, we construct the payoff function and determine the optimal response,\nwhich enriches the theoretical foundation of model watermarking and may inspire\nus to develop novel schemes in the future.",

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in connected autonomous vehicle (CAV) technology have\nsparked growing research interest in lane-free traffic (LFT). LFT envisions a\nscenario where all vehicles are CAVs, coordinating their movements without\nlanes to achieve smoother traffic flow and higher road capacity. This\npotentially reduces congestion without building new infrastructure. However,\nthe transition phase will likely involve non-connected actors such as\nhuman-driven vehicles (HDVs) or independent AVs sharing the roads. This raises\nthe question of how LFT performance is impacted when not all vehicles are CAVs,\nas these non-connected vehicles may prioritize their own benefits over\nsystem-wide improvements. This paper addresses this question through\nmicroscopic simulation on a ring road, where CAVs follow the potential lines\n(PL) controller for LFT, while HDVs adhere to a strip-based car-following\nmodel. The PL controller is also modified for safe velocities to prevent\ncollisions. The results reveal that even a small percentage of HDVs can\nsignificantly disrupt LFT flow: 5% HDVs can reduce LFT's maximum road capacity\nby 16%, and a 20% HDVs nearly halves it. The study also develops an adaptive\npotential (APL) controller that forms APL corridors with modified PLs in the\nsurroundings of HDVs. APL shows a peak traffic flow improvement of 23.6% over\nthe PL controller. The study indicates that a penetration rate of approximately\n60% CAVs in LFT is required before significant benefits of LFT start appearing\ncompared to a scenario with all HDVs. These findings open a new research\ndirection on minimizing the adverse effects of non-connected vehicles on LFT.",

To tackle this issue, we propose NET-SA, an efficient\nsecure aggregation architecture for PPML based on in-network computing.

Accurate and secure\ngradient aggregation is then performed on the central server based on masked\ngradients and aggregated seeds. This design effectively reduces communication\noverhead due to eliminating the communication-intensive phases of seed\nagreement and secret sharing, with enhanced dropout tolerance due to overcoming\nthe threshold limit of secret sharing. Extensive experiments on server clusters\nand Intel Tofino programmable switch demonstrate that NET-SA achieves up to 77x\nand 12x enhancements in runtime and 2x decrease in total client communication\ncost compared with state-of-the-art methods.",

Grain boundary\nenergy is often portrayed as a function of macroscopic boundary parameters\nrepresenting grain misorientation and boundary plane inclination. In grain\nboundary simulation and modeling, many studies neglect structural multiplicity\nof boundaries, i.e., existence of metastable states, and focus on minimum\nenergy. The minimum energy function restricted to constant misorientation\nshould satisfy Herring's condition for interface stability. This requirement\nhas been ignored in recent works on grain boundary energy functions. Example\nviolations of the stability condition are shown. Moreover, a simple and natural\nprocedure for constructing a continuous function satisfying the condition is\ndescribed. Cusps in the energy as a function of boundary plane inclinations\narise because of the imposition of the stability condition, and their locations\nand shapes result from properties of input data.

To overcome this, we present a lookup table based on a\ndeep pose estimation method using a synthetic collection of diverse actions\nrigged avatars perform. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and\nefficiency of this lookup table-based retargeting approach.

These\nattacks entail introducing crafted perturbation signals to legitimate signals\nover the wireless channel, thereby misleading the receivers' semantic\ninterpretation. This paper investigates the above issue from a practical\nperspective. Contrasting with previous studies focusing on power-fixed attacks,\nwe extensively consider a more challenging scenario of power-variable attacks\nby devising an innovative attack model named Adjustable Perturbation Generator\n(APG), which is capable of generating semantic jamming signals of various power\nlevels. To combat semantic jamming attacks, we propose a novel framework called\nRobust Model Ensembling (ROME) for secure semantic communication. Specifically,\nROME can detect the presence of semantic jamming attacks and their power\nlevels. When high-power jamming attacks are detected, ROME adapts to raise its\nrobustness at the cost of generalization ability, and thus effectively\naccommodating the attacks. Furthermore, we theoretically analyze the robustness\nof the system, demonstrating its superiority in combating semantic jamming\nattacks via adaptive robustness. Simulation results show that the proposed ROME\napproach exhibits significant adaptability and delivers graceful robustness and\ngeneralization ability under power-variable semantic jamming attacks.",

The relatively cool temperature of the white\ndwarf suggests that the system could be a post-common-envelope binary (PCEB)\nthat has not undergone mass transfer, while the presence of a massive white\ndwarf indicates that the system might also represent a detached cataclysmic\nvariable (dCV) crossing the period gap.

At the core of 3D-LLaVA is a\nnew Omni Superpoint Transformer (OST), which integrates three functionalities:\n(1) a visual feature selector that converts and selects visual tokens, (2) a\nvisual prompt encoder that embeds interactive visual prompts into the visual\ntoken space, and (3) a referring mask decoder that produces 3D masks based on\ntext description. This versatile OST is empowered by the hybrid pretraining to\nobtain perception priors and leveraged as the visual connector that bridges the\n3D data to the LLM. After performing unified instruction tuning, our 3D-LLaVA\nreports impressive results on various benchmarks.",

    "abstract": "Lung ultrasound is a growing modality in clinics for diagnosing and\nmonitoring acute and chronic lung diseases due to its low cost and\naccessibility. Lung ultrasound works by emitting diagnostic pulses, receiving\npressure waves and converting them into radio frequency (RF) data, which are\nthen processed into B-mode images with beamformers for radiologists to\ninterpret. However, unlike conventional ultrasound for soft tissue anatomical\nimaging, lung ultrasound interpretation is complicated by complex\nreverberations from the pleural interface caused by the inability of ultrasound\nto penetrate air. The indirect B-mode images make interpretation highly\ndependent on reader expertise, requiring years of training, which limits its\nwidespread use despite its potential for high accuracy in skilled hands.\n  To address these challenges and democratize ultrasound lung imaging as a\nreliable diagnostic tool, we propose LUNA, an AI model that directly\nreconstructs lung aeration maps from RF data, bypassing the need for\ntraditional beamformers and indirect interpretation of B-mode images. LUNA uses\na Fourier neural operator, which processes RF data efficiently in Fourier\nspace, enabling accurate reconstruction of lung aeration maps. LUNA offers a\nquantitative, reader-independent alternative to traditional semi-quantitative\nlung ultrasound scoring methods. The development of LUNA involves synthetic and\nreal data: We simulate synthetic data with an experimentally validated approach\nand scan ex vivo swine lungs as real data. Trained on abundant simulated data\nand fine-tuned with a small amount of real-world data, LUNA achieves robust\nperformance, demonstrated by an aeration estimation error of 9% in ex-vivo lung\nscans.

We estimate both the\nunknown parameters of the multivariate non-linear model and the covariance\nmatrix of the noise.

It also determines the decentralization,\nsecurity, and efficiency of blockchain. Existing mechanisms all have certain\ncentralization issues and fail to ensure the decentralization of blockchain\nnetworks. A decentralized and efficient mechanism is required to improve\nblockchain systems. This paper proposes a fair consensus mechanism called Proof\nof Verifiable Functions (PoVF), based on the verifiability and unpredictability\nof verifiable functions. PoVF provides a sufficiently fair mechanism, ensuring\nthat all nodes in blockchain network have equal opportunity to participate in\nconsensus. In addition, a structure called \"Delay buffer\" is proposed to ensure\ntransactions are executed sequentially. It delay the selection of blocks to\navoid blockchain forks caused by broadcasting and transaction execution\nconfusion. According to our security analysis, PoVF is provably secure and has\nthe ability to resist potential adversaries. According to the experiments,\nPoVF-based blockchain can process up to 4000 transactions per second with nodes\nconfigured with only 4-core CPUs. This paper uses the Gini coefficient to\nmeasure the decentralization of blockchains, and the PoVF-based blockchain\nachieves the lowest Gini coefficient of 0.39 among all sampled blockchains.\nPoVF has been shown to provide sufficient efficiency while ensuring\ndecentralization and security through experiments.",

The frequency content of the THz emission signal is also\nstrongly modified under certain conditions. Whereas the emission from a single\nfilament is broadband, the emission from a periodic transverse array consists\nof several discrete frequencies. For this latter case, the THz spectrum can be\napproximated as the product of two factors - the spectrum from a single\nfilament and a complex frequency-dependent phase factor associated with the\nspatial distribution of the filaments. The complex phase factor accounts for\ninterference effects, amplifying certain frequencies from the single filament\nspectrum while suppressing others. The location and width of the discrete\nfrequencies present in the final spectrum depends on the number of filaments\nand their spacing.

In this paper, we introduce a novel hardness-driven strategy for\nMDA tasks, named \"A3MDA\" , which collectively considers these three aspects\nthrough Adaptive hardness quantification and utilization in both data\nAugmentation and domain Alignment.To achieve this, \"A3MDA\" progressively\nproposes three Adaptive Hardness Measurements (AHM), i.e., Basic, Smooth, and\nComparative AHMs, each incorporating distinct mechanisms for diverse scenarios.\nSpecifically, Basic AHM aims to gauge the instantaneous hardness for each\nsource/target sample. Then, hardness values measured by Smooth AHM will\nadaptively adjust the intensity level of strong data augmentation to maintain\ncompatibility with the model's generalization capacity.In contrast, Comparative\nAHM is designed to facilitate cluster-level constraints. By leveraging hardness\nvalues as sample-specific weights, the traditional MMD is enhanced into a\nweighted-clustered variant, strengthening the robustness and precision of\ninter-domain alignment. As for the often-neglected intra-domain alignment, we\nadaptively construct a pseudo-contrastive matrix by selecting harder samples\nbased on the hardness rankings, enhancing the quality of pseudo-labels, and\nshaping a well-clustered target feature space.

This paper\nadvances the DeepJSCC framework toward a semantics-aligned, high-fidelity\ntransmission approach, called semantics-guided diffusion DeepJSCC (SGD-JSCC).\nExisting schemes that integrate diffusion models (DMs) with JSCC face\nchallenges in transforming random generation into accurate reconstruction and\nadapting to varying channel conditions.

The DM is guided by diverse semantic information and integrates\nseamlessly with DeepJSCC. In a slow fading channel, SGD-JSCC dynamically adapts\nto the instantaneous signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) directly estimated from the\nchannel output, thereby eliminating the need for additional pilot transmissions\nfor channel estimation.

The emission centers are generally attributed to either intrinsic\nor extrinsic point defects embedded into hBN. Nevertheless, the microscopic\nstructure of most of these defect emitters is uncertain. Here, through\ndensity-functional theory calculations we studied the native antisite defects\nin hBN. We find that the neutral boron antisite might be a nonmagnetic single\nphoton source with zero-phonon-line (ZPL) at 1.58 eV and such a lineshape that\nis often observed in experiments. Furthermore, the positively charged nitrogen\nantisite might be associated with a dim color center recently observed as a\nblue emitter with ZPL at 2.63 eV. These simple single substitution defects\nindicate the existence of out-of-plane phonon mode which significantly affects\nthe optical properties. Our results could provide useful information for\nidentification of quantum emitters in hBN.",

    "abstract": "Multi-view learning (MVL) leverages multiple sources or views of data to\nenhance machine learning model performance and robustness. This approach has\nbeen successfully used in the Earth Observation (EO) domain, where views have a\nheterogeneous nature and can be affected by missing data. Despite the negative\neffect that missing data has on model predictions, the ML literature has used\nit as an augmentation technique to improve model generalization, like masking\nthe input data. Inspired by this, we introduce novel methods for EO\napplications tailored to MVL with missing views. Our methods integrate the\ncombination of a set to simulate all combinations of missing views as different\ntraining samples. Instead of replacing missing data with a numerical value, we\nuse dynamic merge functions, like average, and more complex ones like\nTransformer. This allows the MVL model to entirely ignore the missing views,\nenhancing its predictive robustness. We experiment on four EO datasets with\ntemporal and static views, including state-of-the-art methods from the EO\ndomain. The results indicate that our methods improve model robustness under\nconditions of moderate missingness, and improve the predictive performance when\nall views are present. The proposed methods offer a single adaptive solution to\noperate effectively with any combination of available views.",

While supervised\ncontrastive learning has recently emerged as a powerful tool for navigating\nlabel noise, many existing solutions remain heuristic, often devoid of a\nsystematic theoretical foundation for crafting robust supervised contrastive\nlosses. To address the gap, in this paper, we propose a unified theoretical\nframework for robust losses under the pairwise contrastive paradigm. In\nparticular, we for the first time derive a general robust condition for\narbitrary contrastive losses, which serves as a criterion to verify the\ntheoretical robustness of a supervised contrastive loss against label noise.\nThe theory indicates that the popular InfoNCE loss is in fact non-robust, and\naccordingly inspires us to develop a robust version of InfoNCE, termed\nSymmetric InfoNCE (SymNCE). Moreover, we highlight that our theory is an\ninclusive framework that provides explanations to prior robust techniques such\nas nearest-neighbor (NN) sample selection and robust contrastive loss.\nValidation experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of\nSymNCE against label noise.",

In\nrecent years, compositional data analysis (CoDA), which respects summability\nand non-negativity constraints, has gained increasing attention for mortality\nforecasting. While the centred log-ratio (CLR) transformation is commonly used\nto map compositional data to real space, the {\\alpha}-transformation, a\ngeneralisation of log-ratio transformations, offers greater flexibility and\nadaptability. This study contributes to mortality forecasting by introducing\nthe {\\alpha}-transformation as an alternative to the CLR transformation within\na non-functional CoDA model that has not been previously investigated in\nexisting literature. To fairly compare the impact of transformation choices on\nforecast accuracy, zero values in the data are imputed, although the\n{\\alpha}-transformation can inherently handle them. Using age-specific life\ntable death counts for males and females in 31 selected European\ncountries/regions from 1983 to 2018, the proposed method demonstrates\ncomparable performance to the CLR transformation in most cases, with improved\nforecast accuracy in some instances.

    "abstract": "Semi-supervised domain adaptation (SSDA) has been extensively researched due\nto its ability to improve classification performance and generalization ability\nof models by using a small amount of labeled data on the target domain.\nHowever, existing methods cannot effectively adapt to the target domain due to\ndifficulty in fully learning rich and complex target semantic information and\nrelationships. In this paper, we propose a novel SSDA learning framework called\nsemantic regularization learning (SERL), which captures the target semantic\ninformation from multiple perspectives of regularization learning to achieve\nadaptive fine-tuning of the source pre-trained model on the target domain. SERL\nincludes three robust semantic regularization techniques. Firstly, semantic\nprobability contrastive regularization (SPCR) helps the model learn more\ndiscriminative feature representations from a probabilistic perspective, using\nsemantic information on the target domain to understand the similarities and\ndifferences between samples. Additionally, adaptive weights in SPCR can help\nthe model learn the semantic distribution correctly through the probabilities\nof different samples. To further comprehensively understand the target semantic\ndistribution, we introduce hard-sample mixup regularization (HMR), which uses\neasy samples as guidance to mine the latent target knowledge contained in hard\nsamples, thereby learning more complete and complex target semantic knowledge.\nFinally, target prediction regularization (TPR) regularizes the target\npredictions of the model by maximizing the correlation between the current\nprediction and the past learned objective, thereby mitigating the misleading of\nsemantic information caused by erroneous pseudo-labels. Extensive experiments\non three benchmark datasets demonstrate that our SERL method achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance.",

To address these concerns,\nprevious methods safeguard the models by eliminating inappropriate concepts.\nNonetheless, these models alter the parameters of the backbone network and\nexert considerable influences on the structural (low-frequency) components of\nthe image, which undermines the model's ability to retain non-target concepts.\nIn this work, we propose our Dual encoder Modulation network (DuMo), which\nachieves precise erasure of inappropriate target concepts with minimum\nimpairment to non-target concepts. In contrast to previous methods, DuMo\nemploys the Eraser with PRior Knowledge (EPR) module which modifies the skip\nconnection features of the U-NET and primarily achieves concept erasure on\ndetails (high-frequency) components of the image. To minimize the damage to\nnon-target concepts during erasure, the parameters of the backbone U-NET are\nfrozen and the prior knowledge from the original skip connection features is\nintroduced to the erasure process. Meanwhile, the phenomenon is observed that\ndistinct erasing preferences for the image structure and details are\ndemonstrated by the EPR at different timesteps and layers.

However, these prompt-based methods face several\nlimitations: (1) incomplete modalities provide restricted modal cues for\ntask-specific inference, (2) dummy imputation for missing content causes\ninformation loss and introduces noise, and (3) static prompts are\ninstance-agnostic, offering limited knowledge for instances with various\nmissing conditions. To address these issues, we propose RAGPT, a novel\nRetrieval-AuGmented dynamic Prompt Tuning framework. RAGPT comprises three\nmodules: (I) the multi-channel retriever, which identifies similar instances\nthrough a within-modality retrieval strategy, (II) the missing modality\ngenerator, which recovers missing information using retrieved contexts, and\n(III) the context-aware prompter, which captures contextual knowledge from\nrelevant instances and generates dynamic prompts to largely enhance the MMT's\nrobustness. Extensive experiments conducted on three real-world datasets show\nthat RAGPT consistently outperforms all competitive baselines in handling\nincomplete modality problems.

    "abstract": "Open-vocabulary panoptic reconstruction offers comprehensive scene\nunderstanding, enabling advances in embodied robotics and photorealistic\nsimulation. In this paper, we propose PanopticRecon++, an end-to-end method\nthat formulates panoptic reconstruction through a novel cross-attention\nperspective. This perspective models the relationship between 3D instances (as\nqueries) and the scene's 3D embedding field (as keys) through their attention\nmap. Unlike existing methods that separate the optimization of queries and keys\nor overlook spatial proximity, PanopticRecon++ introduces learnable 3D\nGaussians as instance queries. This formulation injects 3D spatial priors to\npreserve proximity while maintaining end-to-end optimizability. Moreover, this\nquery formulation facilitates the alignment of 2D open-vocabulary instance IDs\nacross frames by leveraging optimal linear assignment with instance masks\nrendered from the queries. Additionally, we ensure semantic-instance\nsegmentation consistency by fusing query-based instance segmentation\nprobabilities with semantic probabilities in a novel panoptic head supervised\nby a panoptic loss. During training, the number of instance query tokens\ndynamically adapts to match the number of objects. PanopticRecon++ shows\ncompetitive performance in terms of 3D and 2D segmentation and reconstruction\nperformance on both simulation and real-world datasets, and demonstrates a user\ncase as a robot simulator.

To address this problem, this paper proposes a\ngeneralized gradient promotion (GradProm) training strategy for task-driven IQE\nof medical images. Specifically, we partition a task-driven IQE system into two\nsub-models, i.e., a mainstream model for image enhancement and an auxiliary\nmodel for visual recognition. During training, GradProm updates only parameters\nof the image enhancement model using gradients of the visual recognition model\nand the image enhancement model, but only when gradients of these two\nsub-models are aligned in the same direction, which is measured by their cosine\nsimilarity. In case gradients of these two sub-models are not in the same\ndirection, GradProm only uses the gradient of the image enhancement model to\nupdate its parameters. Theoretically, we have proved that the optimization\ndirection of the image enhancement model will not be biased by the auxiliary\nvisual recognition model under the implementation of GradProm.

    "abstract": "The battery performance and lifespan of electric vehicles (EVs) degrade\nsignificantly in cold climates, requiring a considerable amount of energy to\nheat up the EV batteries. This paper proposes a novel technology, namely\ntemperature-controlled smart charging, to coordinate the heating/charging power\nand reduce the total energy use of a solar-powered EV charging station. Instead\nof fixing the battery temperature setpoints, we analyze the thermal dynamics\nand inertia of EV batteries, and decide the optimal timing and proper amount of\nenergy allocated for heating. In addition, a temperature-sensitive charging\nmodel is formulated with consideration of dynamic charging rates as well as\nbattery health. We further tailor acceleration algorithms for large-scale EV\ncharging, including the reduced-order dual decomposition and vehicle\nrescheduling. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed\ntemperature-controlled smart charging is superior in capturing the flexibility\nvalue of EV batteries and making full use of the rooftop solar energy. The\nproposed model typically achieves a 12.5--18.4% reduction in the charging cost\nand a 0.4--6.8% drop in the overhead energy use for heating.",

The framework is easily extensible to nonlinear\ncontrol-affine systems. A novel neural candidate Lyapunov function is developed\nto ensure positive definiteness. Subsequently, a control policy is defined, in\nwhich the thrust direction vector minimizes the Lyapunov function's time\nderivative, and the thrust throttle is determined using minimal required\nthrottle. This approach ensures that all loss terms related to the control\nLyapunov function are either naturally satisfied or replaced by the derived\ncontrol policy. To jointly supervise the Lyapunov function and the control\npolicy, a simple loss function is introduced, leveraging optimal state-control\npairs obtained by a polynomial maps based method. Consequently, the trained\nneural network not only certifies the Lyapunov function but also generates a\nnear-optimal guidance policy, even for the bang-bang fuel-optimal problem.\nExtensive numerical simulations are presented to validate the proposed method.",

A body of work has proposed to\ndefend machine learning models against model extraction attacks, including both\nactive defense methods that modify the model's outputs or increase the query\noverhead to avoid extraction and passive defense methods that detect malicious\nqueries or leverage watermarks to perform post-verification. In this work, we\nintroduce a new defense paradigm called attack as defense which modifies the\nmodel's output to be poisonous such that any malicious users that attempt to\nuse the output to train a substitute model will be poisoned. To this end, we\npropose a novel lightweight backdoor attack method dubbed HoneypotNet that\nreplaces the classification layer of the victim model with a honeypot layer and\nthen fine-tunes the honeypot layer with a shadow model (to simulate model\nextraction) via bi-level optimization to modify its output to be poisonous\nwhile remaining the original performance. We empirically demonstrate on four\ncommonly used benchmark datasets that HoneypotNet can inject backdoors into\nsubstitute models with a high success rate. The injected backdoor not only\nfacilitates ownership verification but also disrupts the functionality of\nsubstitute models, serving as a significant deterrent to model extraction\nattacks.",

    "abstract": "In the face of increasing cyber threats, particularly ransomware attacks,\nthere is a pressing need for advanced detection and analysis systems that adapt\nto evolving malware behaviours. Throughout the literature, using machine\nlearning (ML) to obviate ransomware attacks has increased in popularity.\nUnfortunately, most of these proposals leverage non-incremental learning\napproaches that require the underlying models to be updated from scratch to\ndetect new ransomware, wasting time and resources. This approach is problematic\nbecause it leaves sensitive data vulnerable to attack during retraining, as\nnewly emerging ransomware strains may go undetected until the model is updated.\nFurthermore, most of these approaches are not designed to detect ransomware in\nreal-time data streams, limiting their effectiveness in complex network\nenvironments. To address this challenge, we present the Sysmon Incremental\nLearning System for Ransomware Analysis and Detection (SILRAD), which enables\ncontinuous updates to the underlying model and effectively closes the training\ngap. By leveraging the capabilities of Sysmon for detailed monitoring of system\nactivities, our approach integrates online incremental learning techniques to\nenhance the adaptability and efficiency of ransomware detection. The most\nvaluable features for detection were selected using the Pearson Correlation\nCoefficient (PCC), and concept drift detection was implemented through the\nADWIN algorithm, ensuring that the model remains responsive to changes in\nransomware behaviour. We compared our results to other popular techniques, such\nas Hoeffding Trees (HT) and Leveraging Bagging Classifier (LB), observing a\ndetection accuracy of 98.89% and a Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) rate\nof 94.11%, demonstrating the effectiveness of our technique.",

The role of turbulent collisions, mixing of\ndroplets, and water vapour fluctuations in crossing the 'size-gap' has been\nanalysed in detail. Collisions driven by the coupled effects of turbulent shear\nand differential sedimentation are shown to grow drizzle sized droplets. Growth\nis also promoted by turbulence-induced water vapour fluctuations, which\nmaintain polydispersity during the initial condensation driven growth and\nfacilitate subsequent growth by differential sedimentation driven coalescence.\nThe collision rate of droplets is strongly influenced by non-continuum\nhydrodynamics and so the size evolution beyond the condensation regime is found\nto be very sensitive to the mean free path of air. Turbulence-induced inertial\nclustering leads to a moderate enhancement in the growth rate but the\nintermittency of the turbulent shear rate does not change the coalescence rate\nsignificantly.

The\n$B^{0} \\to J/\\psi h_{1}$ decays are generally dominated by the longitudinal\npolarization contributions, specifically, $f_{L}(B^{0} \\to J/\\psi h_{1})>80\\%$,\nexcept for the case that $\\theta\\sim 35^\\circ$ and $-55^\\circ$. Unfortunately,\nthe direct $CP$ asymmetries of $B^{0} \\to J/\\psi h_{1}$ decays are too small to\nbe observed soon even if the effect of $\\theta$ is considered. The future\nprecise measurements on $B^{0} \\to J/\\psi h_{1}$ decays are expected for\ntesting these theoretical findings and exploring the interesting nature of\n$h_{1}(1170)$ and $h_{1}(1415)$.",

We detected ten CH emission\nfeatures at 3335 and 3349 MHz, and seven features at 3264 MHz, during both\npulsar-ON and pulsar-OFF phases. The observed velocities align with the OH\nemission and absorption reported by a previous study, suggesting a close\nspatial association between CH and OH molecules. The derived column densities\nfor CH clouds within the Parkes beam range from $0.05$ to $9.8 \\times 10^{13}$\ncm$^{-2}$, indicating that these clouds are likely in diffuse and translucent\nstates. Upper limits for CH column densities within the pulsar beam ranged from\n$0.3$ to $9.8 \\times 10^{13}$ cm$^{-2}$. Comparison of these column densities\nsuggests that CH clouds may exhibit clumpiness and substructure. No significant\nstimulated emission feature was detected in the optical depth spectra.\nAdditionally, as part of our search for pulsed stimulated emission, we\ninvestigated the potential CH absorption of the pulsar signal and found none,\nin agreement with astrophysical expectations. The upper limits for the\npotential maser amplification factors towards PSR J1644$-$4559 at 3264, 3335,\nand 3349 MHz are 1.014, 1.009, and 1.009, respectively.

Nevertheless, the inherent challenges of\nultrasound imaging, such as blurry boundaries and speckle noise, often cause\ntraditional segmentation methods to struggle with performance. Despite recent\nadvancements in universal image segmentation, such as the Segment Anything\nModel, existing interactive segmentation methods still suffer from inefficiency\nand lack of specialization. These methods rely heavily on extensive accurate\nmanual or random sampling prompts for interaction, necessitating numerous\nprompts and iterations to reach satisfactory performance. In response to this\nchallenge, we propose the Evidential Uncertainty-Guided Interactive\nSegmentation (EUGIS), an end-to-end, efficient tiered interactive segmentation\nparadigm based on evidential uncertainty estimation for ultrasound image\nsegmentation. Specifically, EUGIS harnesses evidence-based uncertainty\nestimation, grounded in Dempster-Shafer theory and Subjective Logic, to gauge\nthe level of uncertainty in the predictions of model for different regions. By\nprioritizing sampling the high-uncertainty region, our method can effectively\nsimulate the interactive behavior of well-trained radiologists, enhancing the\ntargeted of sampling while reducing the number of prompts and iterations\nrequired.Additionally, we propose a trainable calibration mechanism for\nuncertainty estimation, which can further optimize the boundary between\ncertainty and uncertainty, thereby enhancing the confidence of uncertainty\nestimation.",

Existing approaches\nto headline generation typically rely solely on the article content,\noverlooking crucial contextual features such as sentiment, category, and\naspect. This limitation significantly hinders their effectiveness and overall\nperformance. This study addresses this limitation by introducing a novel\ncorpus, BeliN (Bengali Religious News) - comprising religious news articles\nfrom prominent Bangladeshi online newspapers, and MultiGen - a contextual\nmulti-input feature fusion headline generation approach. Leveraging\ntransformer-based pre-trained language models such as BanglaT5, mBART, mT5, and\nmT0, MultiGen integrates additional contextual features - including category,\naspect, and sentiment - with the news content. This fusion enables the model to\ncapture critical contextual information often overlooked by traditional\nmethods. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of MultiGen over the\nbaseline approach that uses only news content, achieving a BLEU score of 18.61\nand ROUGE-L score of 24.19, compared to baseline approach scores of 16.08 and\n23.08, respectively. These findings underscore the importance of incorporating\ncontextual features in headline generation for low-resource languages.

    "abstract": "Self-Admitted Technical Debt, or SATD, is a self-admission of technical debt\npresent in a software system. To effectively manage SATD, developers need to\nestimate its priority and assess the effort required to fix the described\ntechnical debt. About a quarter of descriptions of SATD in software systems\nexpress some form of negativity or negative emotions when describing technical\ndebt. In this paper, we report on an experiment conducted with 59 respondents\nto study whether negativity expressed in the description of SATD\n\\textbf{actually} affects the prioritization of SATD. The respondents are a mix\nof professional developers and students, and in the experiment, we asked\nparticipants to prioritize four vignettes: two expressing negativity and two\nexpressing neutral sentiment. To ensure realism, vignettes were based on\nexisting SATD. We find that negativity causes between one-third and half of\ndevelopers to prioritize SATD, in which negativity is expressed as having more\npriority. Developers affected by negativity when prioritizing SATD are twice as\nlikely to increase their estimation of urgency and 1.5 times as likely to\nincrease their estimation of importance and effort for SATD compared to the\nlikelihood of decreasing these prioritization scores. Our findings show how\ndevelopers actively use negativity in SATD to determine how urgently a\nparticular instance of TD should be addressed. However, our study also\ndescribes a gap in the actions and belief of developers. Even if 33% to 50% use\nnegativity to prioritize SATD, 67% of developers believe that using negativity\nas a proxy for priority is unacceptable. Therefore, we would not recommend\nusing negativity as a proxy for priority. However, we also recognize that\ndevelopers might unavoidably express negativity when describing technical debt.",

    "abstract": "Recently, consensus protocols based on Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) have\ngained significant attention due to their potential to build robust blockchain\nsystems, particularly in asynchronous networks. In this paper, we propose\nFides, an asynchronous DAG-based BFT consensus protocol that leverages Trusted\nExecution Environments (TEEs) to tackle three major scalability and security\nchallenges faced by existing protocols: (i) the need for a larger quorum size\n(i.e., at least 3x larger) to tolerate Byzantine replicas, (ii) high\ncommunication costs and reliance on expensive cryptographic primitives (i.e.,\nglobal common coin) to reach agreement in asynchronous networks, and (iii) poor\ncensorship resilience undermining the liveness guarantee. Specifically, Fides\nadopts four trusted components-Reliable Broadcast, Vertex Validation, Common\nCoin, and Transaction Disclosure-within TEEs. Incorporating these components\nenables Fides to achieve linear message complexity, guaranteed censorship\nresilience, 2x larger quorum size, and lightweight common coin usage. Besides,\nabstracting these essential components rather than porting the entire protocol\ninto TEE can significantly reduce the Trusted Computing Base (TCB).\nExperimental evaluations of Fides in local and geo-distributed networks\ndemonstrate its superior performance compared to established state-of-the-art\nprotocols such as Tusk, RCC, HotStuff, and PBFT. The results indicate that\nFides achieves a throughput of 400k transactions per second in a\ngeo-distributed network and 810k transactions per second in a local network.\nOur analysis further explores the protocol's overhead, highlighting its\nsuitability and effectiveness for practical deployment in real-world blockchain\nsystems.",

    "abstract": "The nature of modern data is increasingly real-time, making outlier detection\ncrucial in any data-related field, such as finance for fraud detection and\nhealthcare for monitoring patient vitals. Traditional outlier detection\nmethods, such as the Local Outlier Factor (LOF) algorithm, struggle with\nreal-time data due to the need for extensive recalculations with each new data\npoint, limiting their application in real-time environments. While the\nIncremental LOF (ILOF) algorithm has been developed to tackle the challenges of\nonline anomaly detection, it remains computationally expensive when processing\nlarge streams of data points, and its detection performance may degrade after a\ncertain threshold of points have streamed in. In this paper, we propose a novel\napproach to enhance the efficiency of LOF algorithms for online anomaly\ndetection, named the Efficient Incremental LOF (EILOF) algorithm. The EILOF\nalgorithm only computes the LOF scores of new points without altering the LOF\nscores of existing data points. Although exact LOF scores have not yet been\ncomputed for the existing points in the new algorithm, datasets often contain\nnoise, and minor deviations in LOF score calculations do not necessarily\ndegrade detection performance. In fact, such deviations can sometimes enhance\noutlier detection. We systematically tested this approach on both simulated and\nreal-world datasets, demonstrating that EILOF outperforms ILOF as the volume of\nstreaming data increases across various scenarios. The EILOF algorithm not only\nsignificantly reduces computational costs, but also systematically improves\ndetection accuracy when the number of additional points increases compared to\nthe ILOF algorithm.",

As a result, language models will shape\nhow people learn about, perceive and interact with global cultures making it\nimportant to consider whose knowledge systems and perspectives are represented\nin models. Recognizing this importance, increasingly work in Machine Learning\nand NLP has focused on evaluating gaps in global cultural representational\ndistribution within outputs. However, more work is needed on developing\nbenchmarks for cross-cultural impacts of language models that stem from a\nnuanced sociologically-aware conceptualization of cultural impact or harm. We\njoin this line of work arguing for the need of metricizable evaluations of\nlanguage technologies that interrogate and account for historical power\ninequities and differential impacts of representation on global cultures,\nparticularly for cultures already under-represented in the digital corpora. We\nlook at two concepts of erasure: omission: where cultures are not represented\nat all and simplification i.e. when cultural complexity is erased by presenting\none-dimensional views of a rich culture. The former focuses on whether\nsomething is represented, and the latter on how it is represented. We focus our\nanalysis on two task contexts with the potential to influence global cultural\nproduction.

    "abstract": "3D terrain reconstruction with remote sensing imagery achieves cost-effective\nand large-scale earth observation and is crucial for safeguarding natural\ndisasters, monitoring ecological changes, and preserving the\nenvironment.Recently, learning-based multi-view stereo~(MVS) methods have shown\npromise in this task. However, these methods simply modify the general\nlearning-based MVS framework for height estimation, which overlooks the terrain\ncharacteristics and results in insufficient accuracy. Considering that the\nEarth's surface generally undulates with no drastic changes and can be measured\nby slope, integrating slope considerations into MVS frameworks could enhance\nthe accuracy of terrain reconstructions. To this end, we propose an end-to-end\nslope-aware height estimation network named TS-SatMVSNet for large-scale remote\nsensing terrain reconstruction.To effectively obtain the slope representation,\ndrawing from mathematical gradient concepts, we innovatively proposed a\nheight-based slope calculation strategy to first calculate a slope map from a\nheight map to measure the terrain undulation. To fully integrate slope\ninformation into the MVS pipeline, we separately design two slope-guided\nmodules to enhance reconstruction outcomes at both micro and macro levels.\nSpecifically, at the micro level, we designed a slope-guided interval partition\nmodule for refined height estimation using slope values. At the macro level, a\nheight correction module is proposed, using a learnable Gaussian smoothing\noperator to amend the inaccurate height values. Additionally, to enhance the\nefficacy of height estimation, we proposed a slope direction loss for\nimplicitly optimizing height estimation results. Extensive experiments on the\nWHU-TLC dataset and MVS3D dataset show that our proposed method achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance and demonstrates competitive generalization\nability.",

    "abstract": "Semantic communications, which focus on transmitting the semantic meaning of\ndata, have been proposed as a novel paradigm for achieving efficient and\nrelevant communication. Meanwhile, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)\nenhances spectral efficiency by allowing multiple users to share the same\nspectrum. However, semantic communications are unlikely to fully replace\nconventional bit-level communications in the near future, as the latter remain\ndominant. Therefore, integrating semantic users into a NOMA network alongside\nconventional bit-based users becomes a meaningful approach to improve both\ntransmission and spectrum efficiency. Nonetheless, due to the lack of a\nmathematical model that accurately characterizes the relationship between the\nperformance of semantic transceivers and wireless resource allocation,\nenhancing performance through resource optimization remains a challenge.\nMoreover, successive interference cancellation (SIC), a key technique in NOMA,\nintroduces additional complexity in system design and implementation. To\naddress these challenges, this paper first improves the deep semantic\ncommunication (DeepSC) transceiver to make it adaptive to varying wireless\ntransmission conditions. Subsequently, a data-driven regression approach is\nemployed to develop a mathematical model that captures the impact of wireless\nresources on semantic transceiver performance. In parallel, a multi-cluster\nhybrid NOMA (H-NOMA) framework is proposed, where each cluster consists of one\nsemantic user and one bit-based user, to mitigate the complexity introduced by\nSIC.

Despite these gains in\nefficiency, FED maintains high deduplication quality, with the duplicate\ndocument sets reaching a Jaccard similarity of over 0.96 compared to those\nidentified by the standard MinHash algorithm.

However, existing DRL-based methods for adaptive video streaming use\nonly application (APP) layer information, adopt heuristic training methods, and\ntrain generalized neural networks with pre-collected data. This paper aims to\nboost the quality of experience (QoE) of adaptive wireless video streaming by\nusing lower-layer information, deriving a rigorous training method, and\nadopting online tuning with real-time data. First, we formulate a more\ncomprehensive and accurate adaptive wireless video streaming problem as an\ninfinite stage discounted Markov decision process (MDP) problem by additionally\nincorporating past and lower-layer information, allowing a flexible tradeoff\nbetween QoE and costs for obtaining system information and solving the problem.\nIn the offline scenario (only with pre-collected data), we propose an enhanced\nasynchronous advantage actor-critic (eA3C) method by jointly optimizing the\nparameters of parameterized policy and value function. Specifically, we build\nan eA3C network consisting of a policy network and a value network that can\nutilize cross-layer, past, and current information and jointly train the eA3C\nnetwork using pre-collected samples. In the online scenario (with additional\nreal-time data), we propose two continual learning-based online tuning methods\nfor designing better policies for a specific user with different QoE and\ntraining time tradeoffs. Finally, experimental results show that the proposed\noffline policy can improve the QoE by 6.8~14.4% compared to the state-of-arts\nin the offline scenario, and the proposed online policies can further achieve\n6~28% gains in QoE over the proposed offline policy in the online scenario.",

In this paper, we pioneer an\ninvestigation into the transferability of adversarial video samples across\nV-MLLMs. We find that existing adversarial attack methods face significant\nlimitations when applied in black-box settings for V-MLLMs, which we attribute\nto the following shortcomings: (1) lacking generalization in perturbing video\nfeatures, (2) focusing only on sparse key-frames, and (3) failing to integrate\nmultimodal information. To address these limitations and deepen the\nunderstanding of V-MLLM vulnerabilities in black-box scenarios, we introduce\nthe Image-to-Video MLLM (I2V-MLLM) attack. In I2V-MLLM, we utilize an\nimage-based multimodal model (IMM) as a surrogate model to craft adversarial\nvideo samples. Multimodal interactions and temporal information are integrated\nto disrupt video representations within the latent space, improving adversarial\ntransferability. In addition, a perturbation propagation technique is\nintroduced to handle different unknown frame sampling strategies. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that our method can generate adversarial examples that\nexhibit strong transferability across different V-MLLMs on multiple video-text\nmultimodal tasks. Compared to white-box attacks on these models, our black-box\nattacks (using BLIP-2 as surrogate model) achieve competitive performance, with\naverage attack success rates of 55.48% on MSVD-QA and 58.26% on MSRVTT-QA for\nVideoQA tasks, respectively.

    "abstract": "The rotational Doppler effect (RDE) of structured light carrying orbital\nangular momentum (OAM) has attracted widespread attention for applications in\noptical sensors and OAM spectrum detection. These studies, however, based on\nRDE, are mostly focused on the motion parameters of rotating objects; other\nequally important attitude characteristics, e.g., the tilt angle of the axis of\nrotation, have rarely been considered. We observed an interesting phenomenon in\nthe experiments: the rotational Doppler spectral distribution varies with the\nellipticity of the elliptical optical vortex (EOV) and the tilt angle between\nthe rotational axis and optical axis, which inspired us to wonder if it is\npossible to detect oblique rotational axis or compensate the rotational Doppler\nbroadening effect induced by oblique incidence by utilizing the EOV. Here, we\nreveal the RDE quantitative relationship with tilt angle and ellipticity for\nthe first time and report a novel approach for tilt angle measurement. By\nemploying a series of EOV with periodically varying ellipticity to illuminate a\nrotating object and analyze the time-frequency spectral distribution of\nscattered light associated with ellipticity and tilt angle, the tilt angle can\nbe acquired accurately based on the specific relationship between the tilt\nangle and ellipticity of the EOV. Furthermore, the spectrum broadening effect\narising from oblique incidence in the actual scenario may be addressed through\nour scheme. The method may find applications in industrial manufacturing and\ntarget attitude measurement, and our results provide new insights for obtaining\nmore information about objects.",

Their rotational angular momenta are essentially the\nsame as those at the zero-age main sequence. The angular momentum dissipation\nexperienced by these stars during their pre-main sequence phase is also\nrelatively weak, so their rotational angular momentum can reflect the\nparameters of their parental molecular clouds. The reliability of angular\nmomentum measurements was evaluated based on the phenomenon of angular momentum\nconservation observed in stars before and after the turn-off point in\nobservational data. We find that stars with masses between 1.4$M_\\odot$ and\n1.8$M_\\odot$ show an inverse proportionality between angular momentum and\nisochrone age. We propose that the angular momentum-age correlation reflects\nchanges in the star-forming environment in the Milky Way's history. Besides,\nthe observed inverse proportionality implies that, as the Milky Way has\nevolved, the stars formed within it tend to possess greater rotational angular\nmomenta. This trend would promote the fragmentation of stars during the\npre-main sequence phase and inhibit the formation of massive stars, providing a\nuseful perspective for explaining variations in the initial mass function.",

For\nexample, while face authentication is widely used, it suffers from significant\nprivacy concerns. The collection of complete facial data makes it less\ndesirable for privacy-sensitive applications. Lip authentication, on the other\nhand, has emerged as a promising biometrics method. However, existing lip-based\nauthentication methods heavily depend on static lip shape when the mouth is\nclosed, which can be less robust due to lip shape dynamic motion and can barely\nwork when the user is speaking. In this paper, we revisit the nature of lip\nbiometrics and extract shape-independent features from the lips. We study the\ndynamic characteristics of lip biometrics based on articulator motion. Building\non the knowledge, we propose a system for shape-independent continuous\nauthentication via lip articulator dynamics.

We evaluate ValuesRAG using 6 diverse regional datasets and show\nthat it consistently outperforms baselines: including zero-shot,\nrole-assignment, few-shot, and hybrid methods, both in main experiments and\nablation settings.

EAT promotes the diversity of the ensemble, encouraging\neach model in the ensemble to have different robustness features, and employs a\nself-transferring mechanism to make full use of the robustness statistics of\nthe whole ensemble in the update of every single model.

Detailed analysis clarifies\nthe intrinsic issue with the broken-symmetry treatment of low-spin states. It\nshows, in particular, that the error in the BS calculation of exchange\nparameter scales with the degree of covalency between the magnetic and the\nbridging orbitals. This is due to the constraint on the form of\nmulticonfigurational state imposed by the BS determinant, a feature common to\nother single-reference methods too.

By employing a stretched\ntime variable, we derive the transient velocity field and corresponding\ninterface profile on this short time scale and recover the steady-state profile\non a longer time scale.

Numerous approaches are proposed to\nenhance the transferability of adversarial examples, including advanced\noptimization, data augmentation, and model modifications. However, these\nmethods still show limited transferability, particularly in cross-architecture\nscenarios, such as from CNN to ViT. To achieve high transferability, we propose\na technique termed Spatial Adversarial Alignment (SAA), which employs an\nalignment loss and leverages a witness model to fine-tune the surrogate model.\nSpecifically, SAA consists of two key parts: spatial-aware alignment and\nadversarial-aware alignment. First, we minimize the divergences of features\nbetween the two models in both global and local regions, facilitating spatial\nalignment. Second, we introduce a self-adversarial strategy that leverages\nadversarial examples to impose further constraints, aligning features from an\nadversarial perspective. Through this alignment, the surrogate model is trained\nto concentrate on the common features extracted by the witness model. This\nfacilitates adversarial attacks on these shared features, thereby yielding\nperturbations that exhibit enhanced transferability. Extensive experiments on\nvarious architectures on ImageNet show that aligned surrogate models based on\nSAA can provide higher transferable adversarial examples, especially in\ncross-architecture attacks.",

Reconfigurable Refractive Surface (RRS) is an energy efficient\nsolution to address this issue without relying on phase shifters. However, the\nincreased radiation aperture size extends the range of the Fresnel region,\nleading the users to lie in the near-field zone. Moreover, given the wideband\ncommunications in higher frequency bands, we cannot ignore the frequency\nselectivity of the RRS. These two effects collectively exacerbate the\nbeam-split issue, where different frequency components fail to converge on the\nuser simultaneously, and finally result in a degradation of the data rate. In\nthis paper, we investigate an RRS-based wideband near-field multi-user\ncommunication system. Unlike most existing studies on wideband communications,\nwhich consider the beam-split effect only with the near-field condition, we\nstudy the beam-split effect under the influence of both the near-field\ncondition and the frequency selectivity of the RRS. To mitigate the beam-split\neffect, we propose a Delayed-RRS structure, based on which a beamforming scheme\nis proposed to optimize the user's data rate. Through theoretical analysis and\nsimulation results, we analyze the influence of the RRS's frequency\nselectivity, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed beamforming scheme,\nand reveal the importance of jointly considering the near-field condition and\nthe frequency selectivity of RRS.",

FlashInfer tackles KV-cache storage heterogeneity using block-sparse\nformat and composable formats to optimize memory access and reduce redundancy.\nIt also offers a customizable attention template, enabling adaptation to\nvarious settings through Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation. Additionally,\nFlashInfer's load-balanced scheduling algorithm adjusts to dynamism of user\nrequests while maintaining compatibility with CUDAGraph which requires static\nconfiguration. FlashInfer have been integrated into leading LLM serving\nframeworks like SGLang, vLLM and MLC-Engine. Comprehensive kernel-level and\nend-to-end evaluations demonstrate FlashInfer's ability to significantly boost\nkernel performance across diverse inference scenarios: compared to\nstate-of-the-art LLM serving solutions, FlashInfer achieve 29-69%\ninter-token-latency reduction compared to compiler backends for LLM serving\nbenchmark, 28-30% latency reduction for long-context inference, and 13-17%\nspeedup for LLM serving with parallel generation.",

In\nthis paper, we explore the working mechanism of LLMs in information processing\nfrom the perspective of Information Bottleneck Theory. We propose a\nnon-training construction strategy to define a task space and identify the\nfollowing key findings: (1) LLMs compress input information into specific task\nspaces (e.g., sentiment space, topic space) to facilitate task understanding;\n(2) they then extract and utilize relevant information from the task space at\ncritical moments to generate accurate predictions.

IC-ICL enhances\nreasoning performance and inference efficiency by compressing retrieved example\ninformation into the task space. TS-FT employs a space-guided loss to fine-tune\nLLMs, encouraging the learning of more effective compression and selection\nmechanisms. Experiments across multiple datasets validate the effectiveness of\ntask space construction.

The natural frequency modes for the piezoelectric\nbeam are very important since the beam harvests the highest power in those\nmodes. We have observed that when the fluid motion vibrates the beam, in some\ninstances, the voltage output from piezoelectric material peaks to a high\nvalue, which is indicative of material nearing resonance frequencies at the\nfluid loading realized in those instances. However, in other cases, the voltage\noutput varies with the loading, and hence, the response of the piezoelectric\nbeam is broadband, very similar to the sloshing, which is inherently broadband.",

In particular, we assume the presence of a\nbackground magnetic field aligned in a specific direction. We show that there\nis an energy transfer from the oscillating axion field to photons and then to\nthe plasma induced by forced resonance. This resonance is most prominent for\nthe axion mass $m_{\\phi}$ equivalent to the plasma frequency $\\omega_p$.\nRequiring that the heating rate of the interstellar medium caused by the energy\ntransfer does not exceed the observed astrophysical cooling rate, we place\nforecast constraints on the axion-photon coupling $g$ for several different\namplitudes of the background magnetic field $B_0$. By choosing a typical value\n$B_0=10^{-6}$ G, we find that, for the resonance mass $m_{\\phi}=\\omega_p$, the\nupper limit of $g$ can be stronger than those derived from other measurements\nin the literature. With increased values of $B_0$, it is possible to put more\nstringent constraints on $g$ for a wider range of the axion mass away from the\nresonance point.",

In reality, the attackers could launch exponentially unbounded\nfalse data injection (EU-FDI) attacks, which are more destructive and could\nlead to the system's collapse or instability. Existing literature generally\naddresses bounded attack signals and/or bounded-first-order-derivative attack\nsignals, which exposes the CPSs to significant threats. In contrast, this paper\nproposes a fully-distributed attack-resilient bi-layer defense framework to\naddress the bipartite output containment problem for heterogeneous multi-agent\nsystems on signed digraphs, in the presence of EU-FDI attacks on both\ncyber-physical layer (CPL) and observer layer (OL). First, we design\nattack-resilient dynamic compensators that utilize data communicated on the OL\nto estimate the convex combinations of the states and negative states of the\nleaders. The attack-resilient compensators address the EU-FDI attacks on the OL\nand guarantee the uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB) estimation of the leaders'\nstates. Then, by using the compensators' states, fully-distributed\nattack-resilient controllers are designed on the CPL to further address the\nEU-FDI attacks on the actuators. Rigorous mathematical proof based on Lyapunov\nstability analysis is provided, establishing the theoretical soundness of the\nproposed bi-layer resilient defense framework, by preserving the UUB consensus\nand stability against EU-FDI attacks on both CPL and OL. Finally, a comparative\ncase study for heterogeneous multi-agent systems validate the enhanced\nresilience of the proposed defense strategies.",

This has\nmotivated the use of different noise schedules, the two most common choices\nbeing referred to as variance preserving (VP) and variance exploding (VE). Here\nwe revisit these schedules within the framework of stochastic interpolants.\nUsing the Gaussian Mixture (GM) and Curie-Weiss (CW) data distributions as test\ncase models, we first investigate the effect of the variance of the initial\nnoise distribution and show that VP recovers the low-level feature (the\ndistribution of each mode) but misses the high-level feature (the asymmetry\nbetween modes), whereas VE performs oppositely. We also show that this\ndichotomy, which happens when denoising by a constant amount in each step, can\nbe avoided by using noise schedules specific to VP and VE that allow for the\nrecovery of both high- and low-level features. Finally we show that these\nschedules yield generative models for the GM and CW model whose probability\nflow ODE can be discretized using $\\Theta_d(1)$ steps in dimension $d$ instead\nof the $\\Theta_d(\\sqrt{d})$ steps required by constant denoising.",

    "abstract": "Star formation quenching in galaxies is a critical process in galaxy\nformation. It is widely believed that the quenching process is dominated by the\nmass of galaxies and/or their environment. In Paper V, we addressed the\nchallenge to disentangle the effects of mass and environment by employing the\nPAC method, which combines spectroscopic and deep photometric surveys. This\napproach enabled us to measure the excess surface density of blue and red\ngalaxies around massive central galaxies down to $10^{9.0}M_{\\odot}$. However,\nit is not straightforward to completely separate the two effects. To address\nthis issue, in this paper, we derive the average quenched fraction of central\n(isolated) galaxies, $\\bar{f}_{\\mathrm{q}}^{\\mathrm{cen}}(M_{*})$, by combining\nthe 3D quenched fraction distribution $f^{\\mathrm{sat}}_{\\mathrm{q}}(r;\nM_{*,\\mathrm{cen}}, M_{*,\\mathrm{sat}})$, reconstructed from the\n$\\bar{n}_2w_{\\mathrm{p}}(r_{\\mathrm{p}})$ measurements, with the stellar\nmass-halo mass relation in N-body simulations from Paper IV, and the observed\ntotal quenched fraction, $\\bar{f}_{\\mathrm{q}}^{\\mathrm{all}}(M_{*})$. Using\n$f^{\\mathrm{sat}}_{\\mathrm{q}}(r;M_{*,\\mathrm{cen}},M_{*,\\mathrm{sat}})$,\n$\\bar{f}_{\\mathrm{q}}^{\\mathrm{cen}}(M_{*})$, and the galaxy-halo connection,\nwe assign a quenched probability to each (sub)halo in the simulation, enabling\na comprehensive study of galaxy quenching. We find that the mass-quenched\nfraction increases from 0.3 to 0.87 across the stellar mass range $[10^{9.5},\n10^{11.0}]M_{\\odot}$, while the environmental quenched fraction decreases from\n0.17 to 0.03. The mass effect dominates galaxy quenching across the entire\nstellar mass range we studied. Moreover, more massive host halos are more\neffective at quenching their satellite galaxies, while satellite stellar mass\nhas minimal influence on environmental quenching.",

JWST has revealed an unexpectedly large population\nof bright ($M_\\mathrm{UV} \\lesssim -20$) galaxies at $z\\gtrsim10$, implying\nfundamental changes in the star forming properties of galaxies at increasingly\nearly times. However, constraining the fainter population ($M_\\mathrm{UV}\n\\gtrsim -18$) has been more challenging. In this work, we present the\n$z\\gtrsim9$ UV luminosity function from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic\nSurvey. We calculate the UV luminosity function from several hundred\n$z\\gtrsim9$ galaxy candidates that reach UV luminosities of\n$M_\\mathrm{UV}\\sim-17$ in redshift bins of $z\\sim9-12$ (309 candidates) and\n$z\\sim12-16$ (63 candidates). We search for candidates at $z\\sim16-22.5$ and\nfind none. We also estimate the $z\\sim14-16$ luminosity function from the\n$z\\geq14$ subset of the $z\\sim12-16$ sample. Consistent with other\nmeasurements, we find an excess of bright galaxies that is in tension with many\ntheoretical models, especially at $z\\gtrsim12$. However, we also find high\nnumber densities at $-18\\lesssim M_\\mathrm{UV} \\lesssim-17$, suggesting that\nthere is a larger population of faint galaxies than expected, as well as bright\nones. From our parametric fits for the luminosity function, we find steep faint\nend slopes of $-2.5\\lesssim\\alpha\\lesssim-2.3$, suggesting a large population\nof faint ($M_\\mathrm{UV} \\gtrsim -17$) galaxies. Combined, the high\nnormalization and steep faint end slope of the luminosity function could imply\nthat the reionization process is appreciably underway as early as $z=10$.",
