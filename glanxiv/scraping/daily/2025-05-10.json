    "abstract": "The algorithms developed for Maritime Autonomous Surface Ships (MASS) are\noften challenging to test on actual vessels due to high operational costs and\nsafety considerations. Simulations offer a cost-effective alternative and\neliminate risks, but they may not accurately represent real-world dynamics for\nthe given tasks. Utilizing small-scale model ships and robotic vessels in\nconjunction with a laboratory basin provides an accessible testing environment\nfor the early stages of validation processes. However, designing and developing\na model vessel for a single test can be costly and cumbersome, and researchers\noften lack access to such infrastructure. To address these challenges and\nenable streamlined testing, we have developed an in-house testbed that\nfacilitates the development, testing, verification, and validation of MASS\nalgorithms in a digital-physical laboratory. This infrastructure includes a set\nof small-scale model vessels, a simulation environment for each vessel, a\ncomprehensive testbed environment, and a digital twin in Unity. With this, we\naim to establish a full design and verification pipeline that starts with\nhigh-fidelity simulation models of each model vessel, to the model-scale\ntesting in the laboratory basin, allowing possibilities for moving towards\nsemi-fullscale validation with R/V milliAmpere1 and full-scale validation with\nR/V Gunnerus. In this work, we present our progress on the development of this\ntestbed environment and its components, demonstrating its effectiveness in\nenabling ship guidance, navigation, and control (GNC), including autonomy.",

Unraveling these intricate causal relationships can benefit from the\nuse of robust data-driven methods.\n  Methods: We developed a method called Hillclimb-Causal Inference, a causal\ndiscovery approach that integrates the Hill Climb Search algorithm with a\ncustomized Linear Gaussian Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). This method\nwas applied to data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD)\nStudy, which included parental behavior assessments, children's genotypes, and\nexternalizing behavior measures. We performed dimensionality reduction to\naddress multicollinearity among parental behaviors and assessed children's\ngenetic risk for externalizing disorders using polygenic risk scores (PRS),\nwhich were computed based on GWAS summary statistics from independent cohorts.\nOnce the causal pathways were identified, we employed structural equation\nmodeling (SEM) to quantify the relationships within the model.\n  Results: We identified prominent causal pathways linking parental behaviors\nto children's externalizing outcomes. Parental alcohol misuse and broader\nbehavioral issues exhibited notably stronger direct effects (0.33 and 0.20,\nrespectively) compared to children's polygenic risk scores (0.07). Moreover,\nwhen considering both direct and indirect paths, parental substance misuse\n(alcohol, drug, and tobacco) collectively resulted in a total effect exceeding\n1.1 on externalizing behaviors.

    "abstract": "Many biological processes involve transport and organization of inclusions in\nthin fluid interfaces. A key aspect of these assemblies is the active\ndissipative stresses applied from the inclusions to the fluid interface,\nresulting in long-range active interfacial flows. We study the effect of these\nactive flows on the self-organization of rod-like inclusions in the interface.\nSpecifically, we consider a dilute suspension of Brownian rods of length $L$,\nembedded in a thin fluid interface of 2D viscosity $\\eta_m$ and surrounded on\nboth sides with 3D fluid domains of viscosity $\\eta_f$. The momentum transfer\nfrom the interfacial flows to the surrounding fluids occurs over length\n$\\ell_0=\\eta_m/\\eta_f$, known as Saffman-Delbr\\\"uck length. We use zeroth,\nfirst and second moments of Smoluchowski equation to obtain the conservation\nequations for concentration, polar order and nematic order fields, and use\nlinear stability analysis and continuum simulations to study the dynamic\nvariations of these fields as a function of $L/\\ell_0$, the ratio of active to\nthermal stresses, and the dimensionless self-propulsion velocity of the\nembedded particles. We find that at sufficiently large activities, the\nsuspensions of active extensile stress (pusher) with no directed motion undergo\na finite wavelength nematic ordering, with the length of the ordered domains\ndecreasing with increasing $L/\\ell_0$. The ordering transition is hindered with\nfurther increases in $L/\\ell_0$. In contrast, the suspensions with active\ncontractile stress (puller) remain uniform with variations of activity. We\nnotice that the self-propulsion velocity results in significant concentration\nfluctuations and changes in the size of the order domains that depend on\n$L/\\ell_0$.

In this paper, to investigate differences in how the two jurisdictions\nmanage and present evidence, we developed and evaluated a Large Language\nModel-based sentence classifier to perform automated analyses of electronic\ncigarette-related policy documents drawn from official Australian and UK\nlegislative processes (109 documents in total). Specifically, we utilized GPT-4\nto automatically classify sentences based on whether they contained claims that\ne-cigarettes were broadly helpful or harmful for public health. Our LLM-based\nclassifier achieved an F-score of 0.9. Further, when applying the classifier to\nour entire sentence-level corpus, we found that Australian legislative\ndocuments show a much higher proportion of harmful statements, and a lower\nproportion of helpful statements compared to the expected values, with the\nopposite holding for the UK. In conclusion, this work utilized an LLM-based\napproach to provide evidence to support the contention that - drawing on the\nsame evidence base - Australian ENDS-related policy documents emphasize the\nharms associated with ENDS products and UK policy documents emphasize the\nbenefits.

    "abstract": "The linear stability of global non-axisymmetric modes in differentially\nrotating, magnetized, non-ideal plasma is crucial for understanding turbulence\nand transport phenomena. We investigate the competition between the local\nMagneto-Rotational Instability (MRI) and the Magneto-Curvature Instability\n(MCI)--a distinct non-axisymmetric low-frequency curvature-driven global\nbranch--by developing and applying a non-ideal global spectral method,\nvalidated against NIMROD code simulations, and an extended effective potential\nformalism. Our analysis reveals that the global, low-frequency MCI persists at\nlow magnetic Reynolds numbers (Rm), whereas the localized, high-frequency MRI\nis stabilized by diffusive broadening of its structure around its Alfv\\'enic\nresonances. Consequently, we identify the global MCI as the primary onset\nmechanism for magnetohydrodynamic instability in systems with finite curvature,\ne.g., astrophysical rotators. We establish distinct parameter regimes for mode\ndominance: MCI prevails in geometrically moderate-thickness disks with high\ncurvature and intermediate radial gaps, while MRI dominates in thin,\nlow-curvature disks with large radial gaps. Mode competition is also highly\nsensitive to the flow profile, particularly vorticity and its gradient, with\nnon-uniform shear profiles exhibiting more robust instability due to\nflow-curvature and shear contributions. A key outcome is the development of\n\"spectral diagrams\" derived from the global spectral method. These diagrams\ncomprehensively map dominant instabilities and their characteristics, offering\na predictive tool for critical onset parameters (i.e., flow curvature, magnetic\nfield, and Rm) and facilitating the interpretation of experimental and\nsimulation results. Notably, these diagrams demonstrate that the global MCI is\ngenerally the sole unstable mode at the initial onset of instability.",

    "abstract": "High velocity stars move through the interstellar medium with V > 30 km/s.\nWhen the star has powerful winds, under the appropriate conditions, the\ninteraction of the wind with the interstellar material produces a system of\nshocks. The outer shock, called the bowshock, perturbs the ambient medium,\nheating and compressing the gas. The dust in the compressed bowshock cools,\nproducing infrared radiation. This emission appears as extended coma-shape\nstructures. The discovery of radio nonthermal emission from two stellar\nbowshock nebulae indicates that these sources might be accelerating electrons\nup to relativistic energies. The produced nonthermal radio emission is most\nprobably synchrotron which has a high degree of polarization. In this work we\nmodel the synchrotron emission of runaway massive star bowshocks aiming to\nproduce synthetic radio emission and polarization maps for two frequencies:\n1.40 and 4.86 GHz. We model the interacting plasmas in a steady-state regime by\nmeans of magnetohydrodynamics simulations and we compute the injection and\ntransport of the relativistic electrons in the diffusion approximation. We\ninclude in the model the most important depolarization effects. Our main\nconclusions are i) the effects of Faraday rotation within the source are\nimportant at the lowest frequency considered, ii) inferring the local magnetic\nfield direction from polarization measurements only can be misleading, iii)\nthermal radio emission produced by ionized plasma within the bowshock structure\nand surroundings can surpass the polarized one for the considered frequencies,\nand iv) the contribution from the background electrons is minor.",

Prior approaches are\noften limited to lightweight tasks or quadrupedal/wheeled platforms. To\novercome these limitations, we propose FALCON, a dual-agent\nreinforcement-learning-based framework for robust force-adaptive humanoid\nloco-manipulation. FALCON decomposes whole-body control into two specialized\nagents: (1) a lower-body agent ensuring stable locomotion under external force\ndisturbances, and (2) an upper-body agent precisely tracking end-effector\npositions with implicit adaptive force compensation. These two agents are\njointly trained in simulation with a force curriculum that progressively\nescalates the magnitude of external force exerted on the end effector while\nrespecting torque limits. Experiments demonstrate that, compared to the\nbaselines, FALCON achieves 2x more accurate upper-body joint tracking, while\nmaintaining robust locomotion under force disturbances and achieving faster\ntraining convergence. Moreover, FALCON enables policy training without\nembodiment-specific reward or curriculum tuning. Using the same training setup,\nwe obtain policies that are deployed across multiple humanoids, enabling\nforceful loco-manipulation tasks such as transporting payloads (0-20N force),\ncart-pulling (0-100N), and door-opening (0-40N) in the real world.",

We present two mode permuter designs based on fiber\nBragg gratings for links employing graded-index transmission fibers with $D=12$\nguided spatial and polarization modes. One design utilizes a step-index (SI)\ntransverse profile, and the other features a free-form-optimized transverse\nprofile achieving improved performance. For the SI design, we achieve\nmode-dependent loss standard deviation (MDL STD) and mode-averaged loss (MAL)\nof less than $0.14$ dB and $0.27$ dB, respectively, over the C-band. For the\ndesign with a free-form-optimized transverse profile, we achieve MDL STD and\nMAL of less than $0.11$ dB and $0.07$ dB, respectively, over the C-band. We\nnumerically evaluate the designs through link simulations and quantify the\nreduction in GD spread for different levels of random inter-group coupling in\nthe fiber. Our results show that in a link with periodic mode permutation and\nmode scrambling, the GD STD is reduced by a factor over $3.13$ compared to a\nlink relying solely on periodic mode scrambling.",

GD compensation, which involves periodically exchanging\npropagating signals between modes with lower and higher GDs, can potentially\nreduce GD spread.

Recently, novel experiments to search for axion DM have been proposed that\nuse optical cavities to amplify polarization rotation of laser light induced by\nthe axion-photon interaction. One such experiment employs a ring cavity\ncomposed of four mirrors.

Moreover, the laser makes it easier to scan the high\naxion mass region by tuning the reflection phase difference between s- and\np-polarizations.

Classic objectives for such probabilistic\nmodels for control and planning problems are reachability and stochastic\nshortest path. The widely studied algorithmic approach for these problems is\nthe Value Iteration (VI) algorithm which iteratively applies local updates\ncalled Bellman updates. There are many practical approaches for VI in the\nliterature but they all require exponentially many Bellman updates for MCs in\nthe worst case. A preprocessing step is an algorithm that is discrete,\ngraph-theoretical, and requires linear space. An important open question is\nwhether, after a polynomial-time preprocessing, VI can be achieved with\nsub-exponentially many Bellman updates. In this work, we present a new approach\nfor VI based on guessing values. Our theoretical contributions are twofold.\nFirst, for MCs, we present an almost-linear-time preprocessing algorithm after\nwhich, along with guessing values, VI requires only subexponentially many\nBellman updates. Second, we present an improved analysis of the speed of\nconvergence of VI for MDPs. Finally, we present a practical algorithm for MDPs\nbased on our new approach.

However, existing\ndetection models suffer from poor generalization across datasets, due to\nimplicit identity leakage, where models inadvertently learn speaker-specific\nfeatures instead of manipulation artifacts. To the best of our knowledge, this\nis the first study to explicitly analyze and address identity leakage in the\naudio deepfake detection domain. This work proposes an identity-independent\naudio deepfake detection framework that mitigates identity leakage by\nencouraging the model to focus on forgery-specific artifacts instead of\noverfitting to speaker traits. Our approach leverages Artifact Detection\nModules (ADMs) to isolate synthetic artifacts in both time and frequency\ndomains, enhancing cross-dataset generalization. We introduce novel dynamic\nartifact generation techniques, including frequency domain swaps, time domain\nmanipulations, and background noise augmentation, to enforce learning of\ndataset-invariant features. Extensive experiments conducted on ASVspoof2019,\nADD 2022, FoR, and In-The-Wild datasets demonstrate that the proposed\nADM-enhanced models achieve F1 scores of 0.230 (ADD 2022), 0.604 (FoR), and\n0.813 (In-The-Wild), consistently outperforming the baseline.

    "abstract": "This paper quantitatively investigates the crash severity of Autonomous\nVehicles (AVs) with spatially localized machine learning and macroscopic\nmeasures of the urban built environment. Extending beyond the microscopic\neffects of individual infrastructure elements, we focus on the city-scale land\nuse and behavioral patterns, while addressing spatial heterogeneity and spatial\nautocorrelation. We implemented a spatially localized machine learning\ntechnique called Geographical Random Forest (GRF) on the California AV\ncollision dataset. Analyzing multiple urban measures, including points of\ninterest, building footprint, and land use, we built a GRF model and visualized\nit as a crash severity risk map of San Francisco. This paper presents three\nfindings. First, spatially localized machine learning outperformed regular\nmachine learning in predicting AV crash severity. The bias-variance tradeoff\nwas evident as we adjusted the localization weight hyperparameter. Second, land\nuse was the most important predictor, compared to intersections, building\nfootprints, public transit stops, and Points Of Interest (POIs). Third, AV\ncrashes were more likely to result in low-severity incidents in city center\nareas with greater diversity and commercial activities, than in residential\nneighborhoods. Residential land use is likely associated with higher severity\ndue to human behavior and less restrictive environments. Counterintuitively,\nresidential areas were associated with higher crash severity, compared to more\ncomplex areas such as commercial and mixed-use areas. When robotaxi operators\ntrain their AV systems, it is recommended to: (1) consider where their fleet\noperates and make localized algorithms for their perception system, and (2)\ndesign safety measures specific to residential neighborhoods, such as slower\ndriving speeds and more alert sensors.",

These models refine images from random noise based on textual\nprompts, with initial reliance on text input shifting towards enhanced visual\nfidelity over time. This transition suggests that static model parameters might\nnot optimally address the distinct phases of generation. We introduce LGR-AD\n(Learning Graph Representation of Agent Diffusers), a novel multi-agent system\ndesigned to improve adaptability in dynamic computer vision tasks. LGR-AD\nmodels the generation process as a distributed system of interacting agents,\neach representing an expert sub-model. These agents dynamically adapt to\nvarying conditions and collaborate through a graph neural network that encodes\ntheir relationships and performance metrics. Our approach employs a\ncoordination mechanism based on top-$k$ maximum spanning trees, optimizing the\ngeneration process. Each agent's decision-making is guided by a meta-model that\nminimizes a novel loss function, balancing accuracy and diversity. Theoretical\nanalysis and extensive empirical evaluations show that LGR-AD outperforms\ntraditional diffusion models across various benchmarks, highlighting its\npotential for scalable and flexible solutions in complex image generation\ntasks.

Intuitively, selecting a null feature that is highly\ncorrelated with a true one may be less problematic than selecting a completely\nuncorrelated null feature. Second, correlation among features can cause\nvariable selection methods to produce very different feature sets across runs,\nmaking it hard to identify stable features. To address these issues, we propose\na new framework based on feature subspaces -- the subspaces spanned by selected\ncolumns of the feature matrix. This framework leads to a new definition of\nfalse positives and negatives based on the \"similarity\" of feature subspaces.\nFurther, instead of measuring stability of individual features, we measure\nstability with respect to feature subspaces. We propose and theoretically\nanalyze a subspace generalization of stability selection (Meinshausen and\nBuhlmann, 2010). This procedure outputs multiple candidate stable models which\ncan be considered interchangeable due to multicollinearity.

However, most of the constructions used for\ncoded computing work only under the assumption that the computations involved\nare exact, generally restricted to special classes of functions, and require\nquantized inputs. This paper considers the use of Private Berrut Approximate\nCoded Computing (PBACC) as a general solution to add strong but non-perfect\nprivacy to federated learning. We derive new adapted PBACC algorithms for\ncentralized aggregation, secure distributed training with centralized data, and\nsecure decentralized training with decentralized data, thus enlarging\nsignificantly the applications of the method and the existing privacy\nprotection tools available for these paradigms. Particularly, PBACC can be used\nrobustly to attain privacy guarantees in decentralized federated learning for a\nvariety of models. Our numerical results show that the achievable quality of\ndifferent learning models (convolutional neural networks, variational\nautoencoders, and Cox regression) is minimally altered by using these new\ncomputing schemes, and that the privacy leakage can be bounded strictly to less\nthan a fraction of one bit per participant.

Ever since the first publication (Daly\n2020), developers of the code base now known as Apache Otava (incubating), have\ncontinuosly improved its performance. Even when a contributor's primary\nmotivation was to add functionality, it seems like they couldn't help\nthemselves but to also make some performance optimizations while at it. When\ndeveloping the Nyrkio web service to provide change detection for performance\ntesting, we have observed that Otava had become fast enough that it was almost\nfeasible to compute change points synchronously, as the user is browsing test\nresults in a web browser. Inspired by this, we have developed and contributed a\nnew optimization for the common case where new data points are appended to the\nend of the series. This is now the 7th generation of performance optimizations\nin Otava. These improvements have been done over the past 8 years of\ndevelopment, by disconnected individuals at different employees. Taken\ntogether, the historical optimizations and those published in this paper,\nrepresent a 18 000 to 300 000 speedup over the original by the book\nimplementation of (Matteson and James 2014).

This conjecture is\nknown to hold for some groups $G$ and fail for others. In this paper we\nestablish three variants of the PTC. The first (due to Tim Austin) replaces the\nconstant function $1$ on the right-hand side of the tiling equation by $0$, and\nthe indicator functions $\\mathbb{1}_F$ and $\\mathbb{1}_A$ by bounded\ninteger-valued functions. The second, which applies in $G=\\mathbb{Z}^2$,\nreplaces the right-hand side of the tiling equation by an integer-valued\nperiodic function, and the functions $\\mathbb{1}_F$ and $\\mathbb{1}_A$ on the\nleft-hand side by bounded integer-valued functions. The third (which is the\nmost difficult to establish) is similar to the second, but retains the property\nof both $\\mathbb{1}_A$ and $\\mathbb{1}_{A_{\\mathrm{p}}}$ being indicator\nfunctions; in particular, we establish the PTC for multi-tilings in\n$G=\\mathbb{Z}^2$.

We evaluate the performance of\nthe method across three application domains: molecular activity prediction,\noxidation state classification of transition metal complexes, and breast cancer\ndiagnosis. In the molecular activity task, the classifier achieved the highest\naccuracy in predicting active compounds against two protein targets, with\nstrong correlations observed between the predicted probabilities and\nexperimental pIC50 values. For metal complexes, the classifier accurately\ndistinguished between oxidation states II and III for Fe, Mn, and Co, using\nonly metal-ligand bond lengths extracted from crystallographic data, and\ndemonstrated high consistency with known chemical trends. In the breast cancer\ndataset, the classifier achieved 97% accuracy, with low confidence predictions\nconcentrated in inherently ambiguous cases. Across all tasks, the Boltzmann\nclassifier performed competitively or better than standard models such as\nlogistic regression, support vector machines, random forests, and k-nearest\nneighbors.

    "abstract": "As transportation technology advances, the demand for connected vehicle\ninfrastructure has greatly increased to improve their efficiency and safety.\nOne area of advancement, Cooperative Driving Automation (CDA) still relies on\nexpensive autonomy sensors or connectivity units and are not interoperable\nacross existing market car makes/models, limiting its scalability on public\nroads. To fill these gaps, this paper presents a novel approach to\ndemocratizing CDA technology, it leverages low-cost, commercially available\nedge devices such as vehicle dash-cams and open-source software to make the\ntechnology accessible and scalable to be used in transportation infrastructure\nand broader public domains. This study also investigates the feasibility of\nutilizing cost-effective communication protocols based on LTE and WiFi. These\ntechnologies enable lightweight Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communications,\nfacilitating real-time data exchange between vehicles and infrastructure. Our\nresearch and development efforts are aligned with industrial standards to\nensure compatibility and future integration into existing transportation\necosystems. By prioritizing infrastructure-oriented applications, such as\nimproved traffic flow management, this approach seeks to deliver tangible\nsocietal benefits without directly competing with vehicle OEMs. As recent\nadvancement of Generative AI (GenAI), there is no standardized integration of\nGenAI technologies into open-source CDAs, as the current trends of muiltimodal\nlarge language models gain popularity, we demonstrated a feasible locally\ndeployed edge LLM models can enhance driving experience while preserving\nprivacy and security compared to cloud-connected solutions.

However, inertial sensors also require measurement bias\nestimation, yet introducing the bias in the filter state breaks the Lie group\nsymmetry. In this paper, we design a neural network to predict the bias of an\ninertial measurement unit (IMU) from a sequence of previous IMU measurements.\nThis allows us to use an invariant filter for visual inertial odometry, relying\non the learned bias prediction rather than introducing the bias in the filter\nstate.

However, in organizational\nsettings, the use of DP remains largely confined to isolated data releases.\nThis approach restricts the potential of DP to serve as a framework for\ncomprehensive privacy risk management at an organizational level. Although one\nmight expect that the cumulative privacy risk of isolated releases could be\nassessed using DP's compositional property, in practice, individual DP\nguarantees are frequently tailored to specific releases, making it difficult to\nreason about their interaction or combined impact. At the same time, less\ntailored DP guarantees, which compose more easily, also offer only limited\ninsight because they lead to excessively large privacy budgets that convey\nlimited meaning. To address these limitations, we present DPolicy, a system\ndesigned to manage cumulative privacy risks across multiple data releases using\nDP. Unlike traditional approaches that treat each release in isolation or rely\non a single (global) DP guarantee, our system employs a flexible framework that\nconsiders multiple DP guarantees simultaneously, reflecting the diverse\ncontexts and scopes typical of real-world DP deployments. DPolicy introduces a\nhigh-level policy language to formalize privacy guarantees, making\ntraditionally implicit assumptions on scopes and contexts explicit. By deriving\nthe DP guarantees required to enforce complex privacy semantics from these\nhigh-level policies, DPolicy enables fine-grained privacy risk management on an\norganizational scale. We implement and evaluate DPolicy, demonstrating how it\nmitigates privacy risks that can emerge without comprehensive,\norganization-wide privacy risk management.",

    "abstract": "Recent neuro-symbolic approaches have successfully extracted symbolic\nrule-sets from CNN-based models to enhance interpretability. However, applying\nsimilar techniques to Vision Transformers (ViTs) remains challenging due to\ntheir lack of modular concept detectors and reliance on global self-attention\nmechanisms. We propose a framework for symbolic rule extraction from ViTs by\nintroducing a sparse concept layer inspired by Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs). This\nlinear layer operates on attention-weighted patch representations and learns a\ndisentangled, binarized representation in which individual neurons activate for\nhigh-level visual concepts. To encourage interpretability, we apply a\ncombination of L1 sparsity, entropy minimization, and supervised contrastive\nloss. These binarized concept activations are used as input to the FOLD-SE-M\nalgorithm, which generates a rule-set in the form of logic programs. Our method\nachieves a 5.14% better classification accuracy than the standard ViT while\nenabling symbolic reasoning. Crucially, the extracted rule-set is not merely\npost-hoc but acts as a logic-based decision layer that operates directly on the\nsparse concept representations. The resulting programs are concise and\nsemantically meaningful. This work is the first to extract executable logic\nprograms from ViTs using sparse symbolic representations. It bridges the gap\nbetween transformer-based vision models and symbolic logic programming,\nproviding a step forward in interpretable and verifiable neuro-symbolic AI.",

We propose incorporating interaction and kinematic priors of all agent\nclasses--vehicles, pedestrians, and cyclists with class-specific interaction\nlayers to capture agent behavioral differences. To improve the interpretability\nof the agent interactions, we introduce DG-SFM, a rule-based interaction\nimportance score that guides the interaction layer. To ensure physically\nfeasible predictions, we proposed suitable kinematic models for all agent\nclasses with a novel pedestrian kinematic model. We benchmark our approach on\nthe Argoverse 2 dataset, using the state-of-the-art transformer HPTR as our\nbaseline. Experiments demonstrate that our method improves interaction\ninterpretability, revealing a correlation between incorrect predictions and\ndivergence from our interaction prior. Even though incorporating the kinematic\nmodels causes a slight decrease in accuracy, they eliminate infeasible\ntrajectories found in the dataset and the baseline model.

This approach enables event probabilities to naturally emerge in\nthe latent space as the VAE learns to both reconstruct the original embeddings\nand predict the embeddings of semantically related events. We evaluate our\nmethod on complementary events (i.e., event A and its complement, event not-A),\nwhere the true probabilities of the two events must sum to 1. Experiment\nresults on open-weight language models demonstrate that probabilities recovered\nfrom embeddings exhibit greater coherence than those directly reported by the\ncorresponding models and align closely with the true probabilities.",

If\nsuch a mode is present, not only will topological protection hold despite the\ntransverse polarization profile changing due to modal dispersion, but there is\nalso a degree of robustness to variations in the coefficients of TE and TM\nmodes present. Lastly, we demonstrate how a generalized skyrmion number can\nrecover topological protection in situations where the usual skyrmion number is\nnot preserved.

It maintains accuracy above 91%\nfor both LHC and RHIC sets, while achieving above 96% accuracy for all RHIC\nsets, including the $p_T > 7\\,\\mathrm{GeV}/c$ set, despite never being trained\non any RHIC data. Analysis of per-class accuracy reveals how quantum\nchromodynamics (QCD) effects, such as leading particle effect and kinematic\noverlap at high $p_T$, shape the model's performance across particle types.\nThese results suggest that the model captures physically meaningful features of\nhigh-energy collisions, rather than simply overfitting to kinematics of the\ntraining data.

Additionally, the issue of missing sensor data,\nwhich often occurs in practical situations due to hardware malfunctions, has\nnot been explored yet. This paper seeks to fill these voids by introducing a\nlightweight LSTM-based model that can be used to classify both activities and\nsubjects. The proposed model was used to classify the HAR dataset by UCI [1],\nachieving an accuracy of 93.89% in activity recognition (across six\nactivities), nearing the 96.67% benchmark, and an accuracy of 80.19% in subject\nrecognition (involving 30 subjects), thereby establishing a new baseline for\nthis area of research. We then simulate the absence of sensor data to mirror\nreal-world scenarios and incorporate imputation techniques, both with and\nwithout Principal Component Analysis (PCA), to restore incomplete datasets. We\nfound that K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) imputation performs the best for filling\nthe missing sensor data without PCA because the use of PCA resulted in slightly\nlower accuracy. These results demonstrate how well the framework handles\nmissing sensor data, which is a major step forward in using the Human Activity\nRecognition dataset for reliable classification tasks.",

This\nrepresentation consists of viewpoint, object nodes, and room nodes.

    "abstract": "In this article, we propose a novel extension of Light-Front Holographic\nQuantum Chromodynamics (QCD) to study the effects of spin-orbit coupling on the\nbaryon spectrum by introducing a flavor-dependent dynamical spin-orbit\npotential. This potential, modulated by the holographic coordinate and quark\nflavor, accounts for the mass hierarchy of quarks and the nonperturbative\ndynamics of confinement. By incorporating an exponentially decaying coupling\nthat varies with the confinement scale, we capture the interplay between\nshort-distance and long-distance spin-orbit interactions, particularly for\nheavy-light baryons. An optional coupling to holographic glueball fields\nfurther enriches the model, introducing nonperturbative QCD effects. The\nresulting modified light-front wave equation predicts flavor-dependent mass\nsplittings and Regge trajectories, offering improved descriptions of both light\nand heavy baryon spectra. We discuss the implementation, parameter fitting, and\ntestable predictions for experimental validation, particularly for heavy\nbaryons observed at LHCb and Belle II. This approach bridges light and heavy\nquark dynamics, advancing the holographic modeling of baryon spectroscopy.",

By analyzing over 400,000 scientific\narticles from prominent sources such as PLOS One and Nature, we extracted and\nstandardized more than 5.6 million author-task assignments corresponding to\n1.58 million author mentions. Our analysis reveals substantial disparities in\nworkload distribution. Notably, in small teams with three co-authors, the most\nengaged contributor performs over three times more tasks than the least\nengaged, a disparity that grows linearly with team size. This demonstrates a\nconsistent pattern of central and peripheral roles within modern collaborative\nteams. Moreover, our analysis shows distinct positional biases in task\nallocation: technical responsibilities, such as software development and formal\nanalysis, broadly fall to authors positioned earlier in the author list,\nwhereas managerial tasks, including supervision and funding acquisition,\nincreasingly concentrate among authors positioned toward the end. This gradient\nunderscores a significant division of labor, where early-listed authors mainly\nundertake most hands-on activities.

However, some instances of this problem are unsolvable, lacking any\nstable matching. A long-standing open question posed by Gusfield and Irving\n(1989) asks about the behavior of the probability function Pn, which measures\nthe likelihood that a random instance with n agents is solvable.\n  This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the landscape surrounding\nthis question, combining structural, probabilistic, and experimental\nperspectives. We review existing approaches from the past four decades,\nhighlight connections to related problems, and present novel structural and\nexperimental findings. Specifically, we estimate Pn for instances with\npreferences sampled from diverse statistical distributions, examining problem\nsizes up to 5,001 agents, and look for specific sub-structures that cause\nunsolvability. Our results reveal that while Pn tends to be low for most\ndistributions, the number and lengths of \"unstable\" structures remain limited,\nsuggesting that random instances are \"close\" to being solvable.\n  Additionally, we present the first empirical study of the number of stable\nmatchings and the number of stable partitions that random instances admit,\nusing recently developed algorithms. Our findings show that the solution sets\nare typically small. This implies that many NP-hard problems related to\ncomputing optimal stable matchings and optimal stable partitions become\ntractable in practice, and motivates efficient alternative solution concepts\nfor unsolvable instances, such as stable half-matchings and maximum stable\nmatchings.",

Since the n th root\nof the average of the n th power of the link size in the fluctuating lattice is\nvery strongly dependent on the power n, because of very huge fluctuations, the\ndifferent types of physical energy scales can get very different. With a Galton\ni.e. log normal distribution of the link size the various energy scales have\ntheir logarithms fall into a nice straight line versus the power of the link\nsize, on which they depend.

    "abstract": "As machine learning based systems become more integrated into daily life,\nthey unlock new opportunities but face the challenge of adapting to dynamic\ndata environments. Various forms of data shift-gradual, abrupt, or\ncyclic-threaten model accuracy, making continual adaptation essential.\nContinual Learning (CL) enables models to learn from evolving data streams\nwhile minimizing forgetting of prior knowledge. Among CL strategies,\nreplay-based methods have proven effective, but their success relies on\nbalancing memory constraints and retaining old class accuracy while learning\nnew classes. This paper presents TaskVAE, a framework for replay-based CL in\nclass-incremental settings. TaskVAE employs task-specific Variational\nAutoencoders (VAEs) to generate synthetic exemplars from previous tasks, which\nare then used to train the classifier alongside new task data. In contrast to\ntraditional methods that require prior knowledge of the total class count or\nrely on a single VAE for all tasks, TaskVAE adapts flexibly to increasing tasks\nwithout such constraints. We focus on Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using\nIMU sensor-equipped devices. Unlike previous HAR studies that combine data\nacross all users, our approach focuses on individual user data, better\nreflecting real-world scenarios where a person progressively learns new\nactivities. Extensive experiments on 5 different HAR datasets show that TaskVAE\noutperforms experience replay methods, particularly with limited data, and\nexhibits robust performance as dataset size increases. Additionally, memory\nfootprint of TaskVAE is minimal, being equivalent to only 60 samples per task,\nwhile still being able to generate an unlimited number of synthetic samples.\nThe contributions lie in balancing memory constraints, task-specific\ngeneration, and long-term stability, making it a reliable solution for\nreal-world applications in domains like HAR.",

Notably, the superior activated carbon\npossessed a high BET surface area of 2400 m^2/g and an exceptionally uniform\nmicropore structure with an average pore size of approximately 11 Angstroms.\nThis research paves the way for designing adsorbents with high physical\nadsorption capacities tailored for CWAs protection, offering a significant\nadvancement in developing next-generation protective materials.",

We performed experiments on 2D dunes in a 2D flume\nand Euler-Lagrange simulations of 3D bedforms. In all reversal experiments and\nsimulations, the initial condition start with a conical heap deforming into a\nsteady-state dune, which is then perturbed by reversing the flow, resulting in\nan inverted dune. We show that during the reversal the grains on the lee side\nimmediately climb back onto the dune while its internal part and toe remain\nstatic, forming a new lee face of varying angle on the previous stoss slope.

There\nare two main types of traditional GPU- based solutions. One is referred to as\npre-baked animation texture technology. The problem with this solution is that\nit can only play animations from the pre-baked animation.

The other solution is referred to as\ndedicated processing with a simple skeleton hierarchy (the number of skeleton\nlevels < 64). This option does not need to simulate and bake animation data in\nadvance. However, performance is dramatically impaired when processing complex\nskeletons with too many skeleton levels (such as fluttering clothing, soft\nplants, dragon-like creatures, etc.). In order to solve these issues, we\ndeveloped a parallel prefix tree update solution to optimize the animation\nupdate process of complex skeletons with too many levels, and combined\ntraditional solutions to implement a GPU-based skeletal animation solution.\nThis solution does not need to simulate and bake animation results.

This framework naturally\nfacilitates a Schrodinger-picture evolution for fermionic perturbations on a\nquantum-corrected background. Under the test-field approximation, each massive\nmode sees its own dressed metric, akin to bosonic perturbations, but with\ndistinctive Planck-scale modifications in both temporal and spatial components.\nMassless modes, by contrast, experience an equivalent class of conformal\nbackgrounds: quantum corrections drop out of the spatial sector, while the\ntemporal component alone is dressed by quantum gravity corrections. Extending\nbeyond the test-field regime via a Born-Oppenheimer approximation, we\nincorporate fermionic backreaction self-consistently. Each mode's energy\n(depending on the either vacuum or pair states they occupied) sources a\nmode-dependent shift of the background Hamiltonian, resulting in a rainbow\nmetric. In the deep Planck regime, vacuum occupation yields a positive\nfermionic perturbation term in the Hamiltonian, raising the effective\nminisuperspace potential and delaying the bounce to higher density in the\ncontracting branch.

    "abstract": "Underwater object detection using sonar imagery has become a critical and\nrapidly evolving research domain within marine technology. However, sonar\nimages are characterized by lower resolution and sparser features compared to\noptical images, which seriously degrades the performance of object detection.To\naddress these challenges, we specifically propose a Detection Transformer\n(DETR) architecture optimized with a Neural Architecture Search (NAS) approach\ncalled NAS-DETR for object detection in sonar images. First, an improved\nZero-shot Neural Architecture Search (NAS) method based on the maximum entropy\nprinciple is proposed to identify a real-time, high-representational-capacity\nCNN-Transformer backbone for sonar image detection. This method enables the\nefficient discovery of high-performance network architectures with low\ncomputational and time overhead. Subsequently, the backbone is combined with a\nFeature Pyramid Network (FPN) and a deformable attention-based Transformer\ndecoder to construct a complete network architecture. This architecture\nintegrates various advanced components and training schemes to enhance overall\nperformance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this architecture achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on two Representative datasets, while maintaining\nminimal overhead in real-time efficiency and computational complexity.\nFurthermore, correlation analysis between the key parameters and differential\nentropy-based fitness function is performed to enhance the interpretability of\nthe proposed framework. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work in\nthe field of sonar object detection to integrate the DETR architecture with a\nNAS search mechanism.",

At half-filling, where the system possesses BDI\nsymmetry, we show that a new class of critical phases is realized, with the\nstates at zero energy showing a multifractal character. The multifractal\nproperties depend on the concentration $\\mathfrak{c}$ of the $\\pi$-flux defects\nand spatial correlations between the flux defects.

The combination\nof decomposition preprocessing and machine learning models have demonstrated\nsignificant effectiveness in Hs prediction by extracting data features.\nHowever, decomposing the unknown data in the test set can lead to data leakage\nissues. To simultaneously achieve data feature extraction and prevent data\nleakage, a novel Adaptive Feature Extraction Time-Frequency Network (AFE-TFNet)\nis proposed to improve prediction accuracy and stability. It is encoder-decoder\nrolling framework. The encoder consists of two stages: feature extraction and\nfeature fusion. In the feature extraction stage, global and local frequency\ndomain features are extracted by combining Wavelet Transform (WT) and Fourier\nTransform (FT), and multi-scale frequency analysis is performed using Inception\nblocks. In the feature fusion stage, time-domain and frequency-domain features\nare integrated through dominant harmonic sequence energy weighting (DHSEW). The\ndecoder employed an advanced long short-term memory (LSTM) model.

Results show that AFE-TFNet\nsignificantly outperforms benchmark methods in terms of prediction accuracy.\nFeature extraction can significantly improve the prediction accuracy. DHSEW has\nsubstantially increased the accuracy of medium-term to long-term forecasting.\nThe prediction accuracy of AFE-TFNet does not demonstrate significant\nvariability with changes of rolling time window size.

We propose that humans accomplish this by exploiting\nconstraints that self-motion imposes on retinal velocities. When an eye\ntranslates and rotates in a stationary 3D scene, the velocity at each retinal\nlocation is constrained to a line segment in the 2D space of retinal\nvelocities. The slope and intercept of this segment is determined by the eye's\ntranslation and rotation, and the position along the segment is determined by\nthe local scene depth. Since all possible velocities arising from a stationary\nscene must lie on this segment, velocities that are not must correspond to\nobjects moving within the scene. We hypothesize that humans make use of these\nconstraints by using deviations of local velocity from these constraint lines\nto detect moving objects. To test this, we used a virtual reality headset to\npresent rich wide-field stimuli, simulating the visual experience of\ntranslating forward in several virtual environments with varied precision of\ndepth information. Participants had to determine if a cued object moved\nrelative to the scene. Consistent with the hypothesis, we found that\nperformance depended on the deviation of the object velocity from the\nconstraint segment, rather than a difference between retinal velocities of the\nobject and its local surround. We also found that the endpoints of the\nconstraint segment reflected the precision of depth information available in\nthe different virtual environments.",

We unfold the iterative optimized\nsolution of this model into a multistage network, with each stage comprising a\nreflectance-assisted illumination correction (RAIC) module and an\nillumination-guided reflectance enhancement (IGRE) module.

Although these\nmodels exhibit impressive generative capabilities, they also expose significant\nsecurity risks due to their vulnerability to jailbreak attacks, where the\nmodels are manipulated to produce unsafe content such as pornography, violence,\nor discrimination. Existing works such as T2VSafetyBench provide preliminary\nbenchmarks for safety evaluation, but lack systematic methods for thoroughly\nexploring model vulnerabilities. To address this gap, we are the first to\nformalize the T2V jailbreak attack as a discrete optimization problem and\npropose a joint objective-based optimization framework, called T2V-OptJail.\nThis framework consists of two key optimization goals: bypassing the built-in\nsafety filtering mechanisms to increase the attack success rate, preserving\nsemantic consistency between the adversarial prompt and the unsafe input\nprompt, as well as between the generated video and the unsafe input prompt, to\nenhance content controllability. In addition, we introduce an iterative\noptimization strategy guided by prompt variants, where multiple semantically\nequivalent candidates are generated in each round, and their scores are\naggregated to robustly guide the search toward optimal adversarial prompts. We\nconduct large-scale experiments on several T2V models, covering both\nopen-source models and real commercial closed-source models. The experimental\nresults show that the proposed method improves 11.4% and 10.0% over the\nexisting state-of-the-art method in terms of attack success rate assessed by\nGPT-4, attack success rate assessed by human accessors, respectively, verifying\nthe significant advantages of the method in terms of attack effectiveness and\ncontent control.",

Edge AIGC\nnetworks have been introduced to meet the stringent low-latency requirements of\nteleoperation. However, the inherent uncertainty of AIGC service quality and\nthe need to incentivize AIGC service providers (ASPs) make the design of a\nrobust incentive mechanism essential. This design is particularly challenging\ndue to both uncertainty and information asymmetry, as teleoperators have\nlimited knowledge of the remaining resource capacities of ASPs. To this end, we\npropose a distributionally robust optimization (DRO)-based contract theory to\ndesign robust reward schemes for AIGC task offloading. Notably, our work\nextends the contract theory by integrating DRO, addressing the fundamental\nchallenge of contract design under uncertainty. In this paper, contract theory\nis employed to model the information asymmetry, while DRO is utilized to\ncapture the uncertainty in AIGC service quality. Given the inherent complexity\nof the original DRO-based contract theory problem, we reformulate it into an\nequivalent, tractable bi-level optimization problem. To efficiently solve this\nproblem, we develop a Block Coordinate Descent (BCD)-based algorithm to derive\nrobust reward schemes.

Traditional VIF methods primarily focus on generating fused\nimages with high visual quality, while recent advancements increasingly\nemphasize incorporating semantic information into the fusion model during\ntraining.

This raises a critical\nquestion: can we design a more concise and efficient structure to integrate\nsemantic information directly into the fusion model during training-Inspired by\nmulti-task learning, we propose a concise and universal training framework,\nMultiTaskVIF, for segmentation-oriented VIF models. In this framework, we\nintroduce a multi-task head decoder (MTH) to simultaneously output both the\nfused image and the segmentation result during training. Unlike previous\ncascade training frameworks that necessitate joint training with a complete\nsegmentation model, MultiTaskVIF enables the fusion model to learn semantic\nfeatures by simply replacing its decoder with MTH.

Optical surveys provide photometric\nmeasurements of a large variety of objects, over decades and searching for\nperiodicities coming from galaxies in their long-term optical/UV lightcurves\nmay help identify new MBBH candidates. Using the Catalina Real-Time Transient\nSurvey (CRTS) and Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) data, we studied the\nlong-term periodicity of variable sources in the centre of galaxies identified\nusing the galaxy catalogue Glade+. We report 36 MBBHs candidates, with\nsinusoidal variability with amplitudes between 0.1 and 0.8 magnitudes over 3-5\ncycles, through fitting 15 years of data. The periodicities are also detected\nwhen adding a red noise contribution to the sine model. Moreover, the\nperiodicities are corroborated through Generalized Lomb Scargle (GLS)\nperiodograms analysis, providing supplementary evidence for the observed\nmodulation. We also indicate 58 objects, that were previously proposed to be\nMBBH candidates from analysis of CRTS data only. Adding ZTF data clearly shows\nthat the previously claimed modulation is due to red noise. We also created a\ncatalogue of 221 weaker candidates which require further observations over the\ncoming years to help validate their nature. Based on our 36 MBBHs candidates,\nwe expect ~20 MBBHs at z<1, which is commensurate with simulations. Further\nobservations will help confirm these results.",

To enable memory-efficient fine-tuning, existing\nmethods apply block-wise quantization techniques, such as NF4 and AF4, to the\nnetwork weights. We show that these quantization techniques incur suboptimal\nquantization errors. Therefore, as a first novelty, we propose an optimization\napproach for block-wise quantization. Using this method, we design a family of\nquantizers named 4-bit block-wise optimal float (BOF4), which consistently\nreduces the quantization error compared to both baseline methods. We provide\nboth a theoretical and a data-driven solution for the optimization process and\nprove their practical equivalence. Secondly, we propose a modification to the\nemployed normalization method based on the signed absolute block maximum\n(BOF4-S), enabling further reduction of the quantization error and empirically\nachieving less degradation in language modeling performance. Thirdly, we\nexplore additional variations of block-wise quantization methods applied to\nLLMs through an experimental study on the importance of accurately representing\nzero and large-amplitude weights on the one hand, and optimization towards\nvarious error metrics on the other hand. Lastly, we introduce a mixed-precision\nquantization strategy dubbed outlier-preserving quantization (OPQ) to address\nthe distributional mismatch induced by outlier weights in block-wise\nquantization.

This study seeks to empirically validate the\neffectiveness of the Odychess Approach in improving chess knowledge, strategic\nunderstanding, and metacognitive skills in students. A quasi-experimental study\nwas conducted with a pre-test/post-test design and a control group (N=60). The\nexperimental intervention implemented the Odychess Approach, incorporating a\nLlama 3.3 language model that was specifically adapted using\nParameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques to act as a Socratic chess\ntutor. Quantitative assessment instruments were used to measure chess\nknowledge, strategic understanding, and metacognitive skills before and after\nthe intervention. The results of the quasi-experimental study showed\nsignificant improvements in the experimental group compared to the control\ngroup in the three variables analyzed: chess knowledge, strategic\nunderstanding, and metacognitive skills. The complementary qualitative analysis\nrevealed greater analytical depth, more developed dialectical reasoning, and\nincreased intrinsic motivation in students who participated in the Odychess\nmethod-based intervention. The Odychess Approach represents an effective\npedagogical methodology for teaching chess, demonstrating the potential of the\nsynergistic integration of constructivist and dialectical principles with\ngenerative artificial intelligence.

    "abstract": "Reasoning large language models (RLLMs) have demonstrated outstanding\nperformance across a variety of tasks, yet they also expose numerous security\nvulnerabilities. Most of these vulnerabilities have centered on the generation\nof unsafe content. However, recent work has identified a distinct\n\"thinking-stopped\" vulnerability in DeepSeek-R1: under adversarial prompts, the\nmodel's reasoning process ceases at the system level and produces an empty\nfinal answer. Building upon this vulnerability, researchers developed a novel\nprompt injection attack, termed reasoning interruption attack, and also offered\nan initial analysis of its root cause. Through extensive experiments, we verify\nthe previous analyses, correct key errors based on three experimental findings,\nand present a more rigorous explanation of the fundamental causes driving the\nvulnerability. Moreover, existing attacks typically require over 2,000 tokens,\nimpose significant overhead, reduce practicality, and are easily detected. To\novercome these limitations, we propose the first practical reasoning\ninterruption attack. It succeeds with just 109 tokens by exploiting our newly\nuncovered \"reasoning token overflow\" (RTO) effect to overwrite the model's\nfinal answer, forcing it to return an invalid response. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that our proposed attack is highly effective. Furthermore, we\ndiscover that the method for triggering RTO differs between the official\nDeepSeek-R1 release and common unofficial deployments. As a broadened\napplication of RTO, we also construct a novel jailbreak attack that enables the\ntransfer of unsafe content within the reasoning tokens into final answer,\nthereby exposing it to the user.

The practical equality of\nthis mass to the sum of the masses of our Galaxy and the Andromeda Galaxy, as\nwell as the absence of mass growth in the range of distances under\nconsideration, gives grounds to conclude that the entire mass of the Local\nGroup is confined within the virial radii around its two main galaxies.

    "abstract": "Modern applications increasingly rely on inference serving systems to provide\nlow-latency insights with a diverse set of machine learning models. Existing\nsystems often utilize resource elasticity to scale with demand. However, many\napplications cannot rely on hardware scaling when deployed at the edge or other\nresource-constrained environments. In this work, we propose a model selection\nand scheduling algorithm that implements accuracy scaling to increase\nefficiency for these more constrained deployments. We show that existing\nschedulers that make decisions using profiled model accuracy are biased toward\nthe label distribution present in the test dataset. To address this problem, we\npropose using ML models -- which we call SneakPeek models -- to dynamically\nadjust estimates of model accuracy, based on the underlying data. Furthermore,\nwe greedily incorporate inference batching into scheduling decisions to improve\nthroughput and avoid the overhead of swapping models in and out of GPU memory.\nOur approach employs a new notion of request priority, which navigates the\ntrade-off between attaining high accuracy and satisfying deadlines. Using data\nand models from three real-world applications, we show that our proposed\napproaches result in higher-utility schedules and higher accuracy inferences in\nthese hardware-constrained environments.",

Most proposed ringlet confinement mechanisms presume that there\nare one or more shepherd satellites whose gravitational perturbations keeps the\nringlet confined radially, but the absence of such shepherds in Cassini\nobservations of Saturn's rings casts doubt upon those ringlet confinement\nmechanisms. The following uses a suite of N-body simulations to explore an\nalternate scenario, whereby ringlet self-gravity drives a narrow eccentric\nringlet into a self-confining state. These simulations show that, under a wide\nvariety of initial conditions, an eccentric ringlet's secular perturbations of\nitself causes the eccentricity of its outer edge to grow at the expense of its\ninner edge. This causes the ringlet's nonlinearity parameter $q$ to grow over\ntime until it exceeds the $q\\simeq\\sqrt{3}/2$ threshold where the ringlet's\norbit-averaged angular momentum flux due to viscosity + self-gravity is zero.\nThe absence of any net radial angular momentum transfer through the ringlet\nmeans that the ringlet has settled into a self-confining state, i.e. it does\nnot spread radially due to its viscosity, and simulations also show that such\nringlets have sharp edges. Nonetheless, viscosity still circularizes the\nringlet in time $\\tau_e\\sim10^6$ orbits $\\sim1000$ years, which will cause the\nringlet's nonlinearity parameter to shrink below the $q\\simeq\\sqrt{3}/2$\nthreshold and allows radial spreading to resume. Either sharp-edged narrow\neccentric ringlets are transient phenomena, or exterior perturbations are also\nsustaining the ringlet's eccentricity. We then speculate about how such\nringlets might come to be.",

This issue becomes\nespecially problematic in real-world scenarios where the dominant modality may\nbe unavailable, resulting in severe performance degradation. To this end, we\napply a simple but effective plug-and-play regularization term based on\nfunctional entropy, which introduces no additional parameters or modules. This\nterm is designed to intuitively balance the contribution of each visual\nmodality to the segmentation results. Specifically, we leverage the log-Sobolev\ninequality to bound functional entropy using functional-Fisher-information.

A multi-scale regularization module is proposed to\napply our proposed plug-and-play term on high-level features and also\nsegmentation predictions for more balanced multi-modal learning.

Intuitively, the importance of sentiment\nclassification tasks is the same in all domains for multi-domain sentiment\nclassification; but domain classification tasks are different because the\nimpact of domain information on sentiment classification varies across\ndifferent fields; this can be controlled through adjustable weights or hyper\nparameters.

    "abstract": "Embodied AI research has traditionally emphasized performance metrics such as\nsuccess rate and cumulative reward, overlooking critical robustness and safety\nconsiderations that emerge during real-world deployment. In actual\nenvironments, agents continuously encounter unpredicted situations and\ndistribution shifts, causing seemingly reliable policies to experience\ncatastrophic failures, particularly in manipulation tasks. To address this gap,\nwe introduce four novel safety-centric metrics that quantify an agent's\nresilience to environmental perturbations. Building on these metrics, we\npresent Adaptive Contrastive Optimization for Robust Manipulation (ACORN), a\nplug-and-play algorithm that enhances policy robustness without sacrificing\nperformance. ACORN leverages contrastive learning to simultaneously align\ntrajectories with expert demonstrations while diverging from potentially unsafe\nbehaviors. Our approach efficiently generates informative negative samples\nthrough structured Gaussian noise injection, employing a double perturbation\ntechnique that maintains sample diversity while minimizing computational\noverhead. Comprehensive experiments across diverse manipulation environments\nvalidate ACORN's effectiveness, yielding improvements of up to 23% in safety\nmetrics under disturbance compared to baseline methods. These findings\nunderscore ACORN's significant potential for enabling reliable deployment of\nembodied agents in safety-critical real-world applications.",

Although it is\nwidely accepted that their magnetic fields are generated by the dynamo process,\nit is hard to reproduce coherent oscillations of large-scale magnetic fields\nwith a dipolar symmetry as observed for the Sun when turbulent and compressible\nregimes are explored. Most previous 3D numerical studies partially avoided this\nproblem by considering a numerical domain with low density stratification,\nwhich may correspond to neglecting surface effects where density drops\nconsiderably. To address this question, we perform direct numerical simulations\nof convective dynamos in extreme parameter regimes of both strong turbulence\nand strong density stratification, using software MagIC. Our simulations\nexhibit rotationally-influenced large-scale convective motions surrounded by a\nturbulent compressible surface layer. We find complex time variations of the\nmagnetic field in flow regimes of predominantly dipolar configuration with\nrespect to the few large-scale harmonics. In such regimes, turbulent surface\nlayer induces global magnetic pumping mechanism, transporting magnetic energy\ninto the deep interiors of our dynamo model. Dipole magnetic fields are found\nin regimes of transition between solar- and anti-solar differential rotation,\nand interact dynamically with it. The spatial distribution and temporal\nbehavior of the large-scale fields is consistent with observations of low-mass\nstars, which suggest magnetic pumping could promote time-dependent magnetic\nfields with a dipolar symmetry as observed for the Sun and other solar-like\nstars.

    "abstract": "In the era of rapid development of social media, social recommendation\nsystems as hybrid recommendation systems have been widely applied. Existing\nmethods capture interest similarity between users to filter out\ninterest-irrelevant relations in social networks that inevitably decrease\nrecommendation accuracy, however, limited research has a focus on the mutual\ninfluence of semantic information between the social network and the user-item\ninteraction network for further improving social recommendation. To address\nthese issues, we introduce a social \\underline{r}ecommendation model with\nro\\underline{bu}st g\\underline{r}aph denoisin\\underline{g}-augmentation fusion\nand multi-s\\underline{e}mantic Modeling(Burger). Specifically, we firstly\npropose to construct a social tensor in order to smooth the training process of\nthe model. Then, a graph convolutional network and a tensor convolutional\nnetwork are employed to capture user's item preference and social preference,\nrespectively. Considering the different semantic information in the user-item\ninteraction network and the social network, a bi-semantic coordination loss is\nproposed to model the mutual influence of semantic information. To alleviate\nthe interference of interest-irrelevant relations on multi-semantic modeling,\nwe further use Bayesian posterior probability to mine potential social\nrelations to replace social noise. Finally, the sliding window mechanism is\nutilized to update the social tensor as the input for the next iteration.\nExtensive experiments on three real datasets show Burger has a superior\nperformance compared with the state-of-the-art models.",

The guided mode-resonant\nmetasurface belongs to this class with grating-waveguide responses and shows\nasymmetric resonances. Here, we have theoretically studied the origin of the\nresonance, finding out the root of the Fano interference. We have followed the\nab initio theory derived from the Feshbach formalism for the electromagnetic\nscattering. We have numerically simulated the metasurface to obtain different\nfield parameters required for the ab initio theory; in this regard, we have\nused the multipole decomposition of the scattering fields for the induced\nmoments. Motivated by our recent experiments, we have used a planewave and\npolarized dipole sources to excite the metasurface, and studied subsequent\neffects, like the resonance redshift and the resonance linewidth narrowing for\nthe metasurface. These happened due to the change of the excitation, and we\nhave numerically quantified them. The change of the excitation source bears the\nnovelty of the work.

However, practical\nchallenges include unpredictable demand and translating diverse, qualitative\nmanagerial objectives from non-expert operators into tractable optimization\nmodels. This paper introduces RideAgent, an LLM-powered agent framework that\nautomates and enhances electric ride-hailing fleet management. First, an LLM\ninterprets natural language queries from fleet managers to formulate\ncorresponding mathematical objective functions. These user-defined objectives\nare then optimized within a Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP) framework, subject\nto the constraint of maintaining high operational profit. The profit itself is\na primary objective, estimated by an embedded Random Forest (RF) model\nleveraging exogenous features. To accelerate the solution of this MIP, a\nprompt-guided LLM analyzes a small sample of historical optimal decision data\nto guide a variable fixing strategy. Experiments on real-world data show that\nthe LLM-generated objectives achieve an 86% text similarity to standard\nformulations in a zero-shot setting. Following this, the LLM-guided variable\nfixing strategy reduces computation time by 53.15% compared to solving the full\nMIP with only a 2.42% average optimality gap. Moreover, this variable fixing\nstrategy outperforms five cutting plane methods by 42.3% time reduction with\nminimal compromise to solution quality. RideAgent offers a robust and adaptive\nautomated framework for objective modeling and accelerated optimization. This\nframework empowers non-expert fleet managers to personalize operations and\nimprove urban transportation system performance.",

This paper introduces an\nintermediate language specifically designed for Persian language processing\nthat addresses these challenges through a multi-faceted approach. Our\nmethodology combines two key components: Large Language Model (LLM) prompting\ntechniques and a specialized sequence-to-sequence machine transliteration\narchitecture. We developed and implemented a systematic approach for\nconstructing a comprehensive lexical database for homographs with multiple\npronunciations disambiguation often termed polyphones, utilizing formal concept\nanalysis for semantic differentiation. We train our model using two distinct\ndatasets: the LLM-generated dataset for formal and informal Persian and the\nB-Plus podcasts for informal language variants. The experimental results\ndemonstrate superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art\napproaches, particularly in handling the complexities of Persian phoneme\nconversion. Our model significantly improves Phoneme Error Rate (PER) metrics,\nestablishing a new benchmark for Persian G2P conversion accuracy. This work\ncontributes to the growing research in low-resource language processing and\nprovides a robust solution for Persian text-to-speech systems and demonstrating\nits applicability beyond Persian.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in various\ndomains, primarily due to their strong capabilities in reasoning and generating\nhuman-like text. Despite their impressive performance, LLMs are susceptible to\nhallucinations, which can lead to incorrect or misleading outputs. This is\nprimarily due to the lack of up-to-date knowledge or domain-specific\ninformation. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a promising approach to\nmitigate hallucinations by leveraging external knowledge sources. However, the\nsecurity of RAG systems has not been thoroughly studied. In this paper, we\nstudy a poisoning attack on RAG systems named POISONCRAFT, which can mislead\nthe model to refer to fraudulent websites. Compared to existing poisoning\nattacks on RAG systems, our attack is more practical as it does not require\naccess to the target user query's info or edit the user query. It not only\nensures that injected texts can be retrieved by the model, but also ensures\nthat the LLM will be misled to refer to the injected texts in its response. We\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of POISONCRAFTacross different datasets,\nretrievers, and language models in RAG pipelines, and show that it remains\neffective when transferred across retrievers, including black-box systems.\nMoreover, we present a case study revealing how the attack influences both the\nretrieval behavior and the step-by-step reasoning trace within the generation\nmodel, and further evaluate the robustness of POISONCRAFTunder multiple defense\nmechanisms. These results validate the practicality of our threat model and\nhighlight a critical security risk for RAG systems deployed in real-world\napplications.

However, a prevalent limitation is that conventional deep\nlearning models, which typically rely on training datasets, often exhibit\nsuboptimal generalization to unseen real-world image pairs. This restricts\ntheir practical utility when faced with real-world scenarios not included in\nthe training datasets. To overcome this, we introduce a two-stage random\nalternating framework (TRA-PAN) that performs instance-specific optimization\nfor any given Multispectral(MS)/Panchromatic(PAN) pair, ensuring robust and\nhigh-quality fusion. TRA-PAN effectively integrates strong supervision\nconstraints from reduced-resolution images with the physical characteristics of\nthe full-resolution images. The first stage introduces a pre-training\nprocedure, which includes Degradation-Aware Modeling (DAM) to capture spectral\ndegradation mappings, alongside a warm-up procedure designed to reduce training\ntime and mitigate the adverse effects of reduced-resolution data. The second\nstage employs Random Alternation Optimization (RAO), randomly alternating\nbetween reduced- and full-resolution images to refine the fusion model\nprogressively. This adaptive, per-instance optimization strategy, operating in\na one-shot manner for each MS/PAN pair, yields superior high-resolution\nmultispectral images. Experimental results demonstrate that TRA-PAN outperforms\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in quantitative metrics and visual quality in\nreal-world scenarios, underscoring its enhanced practical applicability and\nrobustness.",

To complete the task,\nexisting approaches predominantly rely on parametric human models (e.g., SMPL),\nwhich establish correspondences between images and contact regions through\nfixed SMPL vertex sequences. This actually completes the mapping from image\nfeatures to an ordered sequence. However, this approach lacks consideration of\ngeometry, limiting its generalizability in distinct human geometries.

The challenge with this task\nis that the current sensor-based methods face challenges in balancing accuracy\nand cost in distance measurement. A common practice is to install cameras on\ntransmission towers, which, however, struggle to measure true 3D distances due\nto the lack of depth information. Although 3D lasers can provide accurate depth\ndata, their high cost makes large-scale deployment impractical.\n  To address this challenge, we present ElectricSight, a system designed for 3D\ndistance measurement and monitoring of potential hazards to power transmission\nlines. This work's key innovations lie in both the overall system framework and\na monocular depth estimation method. Specifically, the system framework\ncombines real-time images with environmental point cloud priors, enabling\ncost-effective and precise 3D distance measurements. As a core component of the\nsystem, the monocular depth estimation method enhances the performance by\nintegrating 3D point cloud data into image-based estimates, improving both the\naccuracy and reliability of the system.\n  To assess ElectricSight's performance, we conducted tests with data from a\nreal-world power transmission scenario.

    "abstract": "Transient size segregation of a bi-disperse granular mixture flowing over a\nperiodic chute is studied using DEM simulations and theory. A recently\ndeveloped particle force-based size segregation model has been shown to\nsuccessfully predict the steady state behavior of binary granular mixtures [1].\nThis promising model is used to predict the time-dependent segregation of\ndifferent size binary mixtures in this work. A one dimensional continuum model\nis developed to solve the convection-diffusion equation by incorporating a\nmixture segregation model along with rheological model. The inter-coupling of\nsegregation with rheology is accounted to predict evolution of species\nconcentration. We also investigate the effect of different initial\nconfigurations (Large near base (LNB), Small near base (SNB) and well-mixed) on\nthe transient evolution of the flow and segregation. The particle force-based\nsegregation model is able to predict the evolution of the concentration profile\nfor all three initial configurations for smallest size ratio of 1.25.\nSignificant deviations, however, are observable for larger size ratios,\nsuggesting the need to account for the evolution of the velocity field in the\nmodel.",

    "abstract": "Prompt engineering has emerged as a critical component in optimizing large\nlanguage models (LLMs) for domain-specific tasks. However, the role of prompt\nspecificity, especially in domains like STEM (physics, chemistry, biology,\ncomputer science and mathematics), medicine, and law, remains underexplored.\nThis thesis addresses the problem of whether increasing the specificity of\nvocabulary in prompts improves LLM performance in domain-specific\nquestion-answering and reasoning tasks. We developed a synonymization framework\nto systematically substitute nouns, verbs, and adjectives with varying\nspecificity levels, measuring the impact on four LLMs: Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct,\nGranite-13B-Instruct-V2, Flan-T5-XL, and Mistral-Large 2, across datasets in\nSTEM, law, and medicine. Our results reveal that while generally increasing the\nspecificity of prompts does not have a significant impact, there appears to be\na specificity range, across all considered models, where the LLM performs the\nbest. Identifying this optimal specificity range offers a key insight for\nprompt design, suggesting that manipulating prompts within this range could\nmaximize LLM performance and lead to more efficient applications in specialized\ndomains.",

While video-based gait identification systems\nperform well on large public datasets, their performance drops when applied to\nreal-world, unconstrained gait data due to various factors. Among these,\nuncontrolled outdoor environments, non-overlapping camera views, varying\nillumination, and computational efficiency are core challenges in gait-based\nauthentication. Currently, no dataset addresses all these challenges\nsimultaneously. In this paper, we propose an OptiGait-LGBM model capable of\nrecognizing person re-identification under these constraints using a skeletal\nmodel approach, which helps mitigate inconsistencies in a person's appearance.\nThe model constructs a dataset from landmark positions, minimizing memory usage\nby using non-sequential data. A benchmark dataset, RUET-GAIT, is introduced to\nrepresent uncontrolled gait sequences in complex outdoor environments. The\nprocess involves extracting skeletal joint landmarks, generating numerical\ndatasets, and developing an OptiGait-LGBM gait classification model. Our aim is\nto address the aforementioned challenges with minimal computational cost\ncompared to existing methods. A comparative analysis with ensemble techniques\nsuch as Random Forest and CatBoost demonstrates that the proposed approach\noutperforms them in terms of accuracy, memory usage, and training time.

In recent years, delving into the factorization of the\nsecond operator appearing in the Fueter-Sce mapping theorem has uncovered its\npotential to generate novel classes of functions and their respective\nfunctional calculi. The sets of functions obtained from this factorization and\nthe associated functional calculi define the so-called {\\em fine structures on\nthe $S$-spectrum}. This paper aims to comprehensively investigate the function\ntheories for the fine structures of Dirac type in the quaternionic framework,\npresenting new series expansions for axially harmonic, Fueter regular, and\naxially polyanalytic functions. These series expansions are highly nontrivial.\nIn fact, when considering the hypercomplex realm, specifically the quaternionic\nor the Clifford setting, extending the concept of complex power series\nexpansion is not immediate, and different Taylor and Laurent expansions appear\nwith different sets of convergence. Additionally, our objectives include\nestablishing the representation formulas for these function spaces; such\nformulas encode the fundamental properties of the functions and have numerous\nconsequences. Finally, in the last section of this paper, we explain the\napplications of the fine structures in operator theory.",

The paired autoencoder framework is a novel approach\nthat leverages the strengths of both data-driven and model-based methods by\nprojecting both the data and the quantity of interest into a latent space and\nmapping these latent spaces to provide surrogate forward and inverse mappings.\nWe illustrate the advantages of this approach through numerical experiments,\nincluding seismic imaging and classical inpainting: nonlinear and linear\ninverse problems, respectively. Although the paired autoencoder framework is\nlikelihood-free, it generates multiple data- and model-based reconstruction\nmetrics that help assess whether examples are in or out of distribution. In\naddition to direct model estimates from data, the paired autoencoder enables\nlatent-space refinement to fit the observed data accurately. Numerical\nexperiments show that this procedure, combined with the latent-space initial\nguess, is essential for high-quality estimates, even when data noise exceeds\nthe training regime.

The\nnonlinearity, describing the current-induced tunability of oscillating\nfrequency, is a distinctive feature of STNOs, which plays important roles in\nefficient manipulation of microwave frequencies, rapid spec-trum analysis, and\nthe design of neuromorphic devices. However, experimental research on its\nefficient modulation remains limited. Here, we comprehensively studied the\nimpact of several factors on nonlinearity in nanoscale three-terminal\nMTJ-STNOs, including the external magnetic field, the thickness of CoFeB free\nlayer, and the combination of spin-transfer torque (STT) and spin-orbit torque\n(SOT). Among these factors, nonlinearity can be significantly tuned by the\ndirection of magnetic field as well as the thickness of CoFeB free layer.\nNotably, it reaches zero in 1.1 nm CoFeB, where the oscillation frequency is\nnot affected by the drive current. Such property provides a more intrinsic and\nrobust approach to achieve zero nonlinearity in STNOs, which is advantageous\nfor high-quality microwave generators. More importantly, we found that\nnonlinearity can also be electrically modulated by both STT and SOT currents,\nand develop a refined model that accounts for the additional contribution of\nthe SOT current to explain the mechanism. This electrical approach is more\nconvenient, energy-efficient, and well-suited for miniaturization.

We then propose data-compatible FCI (dcFCI), the first hybrid\ncausal discovery algorithm to jointly address latent confounding, empirical\nunfaithfulness, and mixed data types. dcFCI integrates our score into an\n(Anytime)FCI-guided search that systematically explores, ranks, and validates\ncandidate PAGs. Experiments on synthetic and real-world scenarios demonstrate\nthat dcFCI significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, often recovering\nthe true PAG even in small and heterogeneous datasets. Examining top-ranked\nPAGs further provides valuable insights into structural uncertainty, supporting\nmore robust and informed causal reasoning and decision-making.",

We find\nthat it is not necessary to use the entire information of one modality to\nreinforce the other during cross-modal interaction, and the features that can\nreinforce a modality may contain only a part of it. To this end, we design an\ninnovative Transformer-based Adaptive Cross-modal Fusion Network (TACFN).\nSpecifically, for the redundant features, we make one modality perform\nintra-modal feature selection through a self-attention mechanism, so that the\nselected features can adaptively and efficiently interact with another\nmodality. To better capture the complementary information between the\nmodalities, we obtain the fused weight vector by splicing and use the weight\nvector to achieve feature reinforcement of the modalities.

DiffATD maintains a belief distribution over each\nunobserved state in the environment, using this distribution to dynamically\nbalance exploration-exploitation. Exploration reduces uncertainty by sampling\nregions with the highest expected entropy, while exploitation targets areas\nwith the highest likelihood of discovering the target, indicated by the belief\ndistribution and an incrementally trained reward model designed to learn the\ncharacteristics of the target. DiffATD enables efficient target discovery in a\npartially observable environment within a fixed sampling budget, all without\nrelying on any prior supervised training. Furthermore, DiffATD offers\ninterpretability, unlike existing black-box policies that require extensive\nsupervised training.

However, conventional biological experimental approaches are\ncostly, time-consuming, and resource-intensive; therefore, machine\nlearning-based computational methods offer a promising solution to mitigate\nthese limitations. This paper proposes a model called 'GBDTSVM', representing a\nnovel and efficient machine learning approach for predicting snoRNA-disease\nassociations by leveraging a Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) and Support\nVector Machine (SVM). 'GBDTSVM' effectively extracts integrated snoRNA-disease\nfeature representations utilizing GBDT and SVM is subsequently utilized to\nclassify and identify potential associations. Furthermore, the method enhances\nthe accuracy of these predictions by incorporating Gaussian kernel profile\nsimilarity for both snoRNAs and diseases. Experimental evaluation of the\nGBDTSVM model demonstrated superior performance compared to state-of-the-art\nmethods in the field, achieving an area under the receiver operating\ncharacteristic (AUROC) of 0.96 and an area under the precision-recall curve\n(AUPRC) of 0.95 on MDRF dataset. Moreover, our model shows superior performance\non two more datasets named LSGT and PsnoD. Additionally, a case study on the\npredicted snoRNA-disease associations verified the top 10 predicted snoRNAs\nacross nine prevalent diseases, further validating the efficacy of the GBDTSVM\napproach. These results underscore the model's potential as a robust tool for\nadvancing snoRNA-related disease research.

The method of\ndecoy states can detect photon-number-splitting eavesdropping and thus enables,\nin theory, secure QKD using weak coherent pulses over long distances with high\nchannel loss inherent in satellite communication systems. However, it is widely\nknown that realistic QKD devices can be vulnerable to various types of\nside-channel attacks that rely on flaws in experimental implementation. In most\nfree-space QKD systems, including that on board Micius, multiple semiconductor\nlasers with passive optics are utilized to randomly generate polarization\nstates. Optical pulses from independent laser diodes can to some extent differ\nin their temporal, spectral, and/or spatial distribution, and the quantum\nstates can thus be distinguishable. Such distinguishability of photons in\nadditional non-operational degrees of freedom compromises unconditional\nsecurity of QKD since an eavesdropper can exploit this loophole to improve\ntheir attack strategy. The author carried out a thorough analysis of the\nexperimental data obtained during multiple communication sessions between\nMicius and one of the ground stations designed specifically for it. Relative\ntime delays between all the eight laser diodes on board have been found. The\ntypical desynchronization between the lasers exceeds 100 ps, which is\ncomparable with their pulse duration of 200 ps. The largest time delay was\nobserved between signal and decoy states for vertically polarized photons and\nis about 300 ps. With such mismatch in timing, a potential attacker using as\nperfect equipment as possible unless it violates the laws of physics was shown\nto be capable of distinguishing decoy states from signal ones in at least 98.7%\nof cases.",

We unveil how\ntopologically nontrivial defect states and non-Hermiticity interplay by\ncompeting with each other, exhibiting a transition from topologically\nnontrivial defect states to skin states. In addition, we show that decreasing\nthe defect strength can result in a transition from trivial defect states to\nskin states.

Traditional physics-based\nmodels and data-driven approaches often struggle to simultaneously ensure model\ninterpretability, noise robustness, and estimation optimality. To address this\nissue, this paper proposes an Adaptive Physics-Informed System Modeling with\nControl (APSMC) framework. By integrating Kalman filter-based state estimation\nwith physics-constrained proximal gradient optimization, the framework\nadaptively updates time-varying state-space model parameters while processing\nreal-time input-output data under white noise disturbances. Theoretically, this\nprocess is equivalent to real-time tracking of the Jacobian matrix of a\nnonlinear dynamical system. Within this framework, we leverage the theoretical\nfoundation of stochastic subspace identification to demonstrate that, as\nobservational data accumulates, the APSMC algorithm yields state-space model\nestimates that converge to the theoretically optimal solution. The\neffectiveness of the proposed framework is validated through numerical\nsimulations of a Duffing oscillator and the seismic response of a frame\nstructure, as well as experimental tests on a scaled bridge model. Experimental\nresults show that, under noisy conditions, APSMC successfully predicts 19\nconsecutive 10-second time series using only a single initial 10-second segment\nfor model updating, achieving a minimum normalized mean square error (NMSE) of\n0.398%. These findings demonstrate that the APSMC framework not only offers\nsuperior online identification and denoising performance but also provides a\nreliable foundation for downstream applications such as structural health\nmonitoring, real-time control, adaptive filtering, and system identification.",

In this\nregard, we have studied the observable-directed flow ($v_1$) of identified\nhadrons, particularly the $v_1$ of baryons and antibaryons, as well as the\nsplitting observed between them in detail. We propose a new ansatz for the\ninitial baryon distribution. By employing this initial baryon deposition model\nalongside a tilted energy distribution as inputs to a hybrid framework, we\nsuccessfully describe the rapidity-odd $v_1$ of identified hadrons, including\nthe elusive baryon-antibaryon splitting of $v_1$ across a wide range of\n$\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$. Our model, incorporating baryon stopping and it's subsequent\ndiffusion within a relativistic hydrodynamic framework and employing a\ncrossover equation of state derived from lattice QCD calculations, establishes\na non-critical baryonic baseline. Moreover, we demonstrate that recent STAR\nmeasurements of the centrality and system-size dependence of $v_1$ splitting\nbetween oppositely charged hadrons-attributed to electromagnetic field\neffects-are significantly influenced by background contributions from baryon\nstopping and its diffusion. Furthermore, we show that the rapidity dependence\nof the splitting of the rapidity-even component of $v_1$ between $p$ and\n$\\bar{p}$ is highly sensitive to the initial baryon deposition scheme. If\nmeasured experimentally, this could constraint the rapidity dependence of the\ninitial baryon deposition profile.

To overcome these\nlimitations, we propose a novel framework that integrates LLMs with an\ninfluence-based plan consensus protocol. In this framework, each robot\nindependently generates a local plan toward the desired formation using its own\nLLM. The robots then iteratively refine their plans through a decentralized\nconsensus protocol that accounts for their influence on neighboring robots.\nThis process drives the system toward a coherent and stable flocking formation\nin a fully decentralized manner.

In that study, a dusty plasma\nwas modeled as a viscoelastic fluid using the incompressible limit of the\ngeneralized hydrodynamic model under strongly coupled conditions in a regime\nwhere the system remains in a fluid state but exhibits significant\ninterparticle correlations, with potential energy dominating over kinetic\nenergy. In this paper, we extend the previous work by employing the same model\nto investigate the evolution of a dipole represented by two counter rotating\nLamb-Oseen vortices in an inhomogeneous medium. It is shown that the entire\ndynamics of a dipole is governed by the competition between the strength of\ntransverse shear waves, which is proportional to the elastic strength of the\nviscoelastic background medium, and the circulation strength of the vortices in\nthe dipole structure. The density inhomogeneity is introduced along the\nvertical direction, perpendicular to the direction of dipole motion, using both\nsmooth and sharp cutoffs. The numerical simulations show that a higher\ncirculation strength of a dipole or lower coupling strength of the background\nmedium allows the dipole to survive longer and follow a more pronounced curved\ntrajectory toward the high-density side. While the overall effects of\ncirculation and coupling strength are similar in both densities, the resulting\nstructure morphologies differ in the smooth density case, the interface around\nthe vortices gradually forms a mushroom-like shape, whereas in the sharp case,\nit forms a simple spiral envelope. These effects are visualized through two\ndimensional simulations based on the incompressible generalized hydrodynamic\nmodel.",

Extending Landauer's principle, we show that the\nthermodynamic cost of observation includes not only information erasure but\nalso the stabilization of rendered states.

A significant advantage of PC-SRGAN over conventional SR\ntechniques is its physical consistency, which makes it a viable surrogate model\nfor time-dependent problems. PC-SRGAN advances scientific machine learning by\nimproving accuracy and efficiency, enhancing process understanding, and\nbroadening applications to scientific research.

In optics, photonic toroidal vortices constitute a novel\nclass of three-dimensional, space-time nonseparable structured light fields\nthat carry transverse orbital angular momentum. However, as solutions to the\ndispersive form of Maxwell's equations, these wavepackets do not survive upon\nnondispersive propagation, and their dynamics remain elusive. In this article,\nthe dynamics of photonic toroidal vortices under various dispersion regimes,\nmediated by both transverse and longitudinal orbital angular momentum, are\ninvestigated through simulations and experiments. The results reveal that the\nmotion of a toroidal vortex is strongly affected by the presence of\nlongitudinal orbital angular momentum. The swirling flow destabilizes the\ntoroidal structure under dispersion conditions and induces topological\ntransformations in the vortex line characterized by its annihilation and\nsubsequent reformation in vacuum. Remarkably, the renascent toroidal vortex\nexhibits robust propagation in vacuum while maintaining its toroidal structure.\nThese findings are supported by experimental validation and highlight the\npotential of photonic toroidal vortices as controllable channels for\ndirectional energy and information transfer.",

FMEnets integrates the\nfundamental governing equations (Navier-Stokes for fluid flow, material balance\nfor reactive species transport, and energy balance for temperature\ndistribution) into a unified multi-scale network model. The framework is\ncomposed of three interconnected sub-networks with independent optimizers that\nenable both forward and inverse problem-solving. In the forward mode, FMEnets\npredicts velocity, pressure, species concentrations, and temperature profiles\nusing only inlet and outlet information. In the inverse mode, FMEnets utilizes\nsparse multi-residence-time measurements to simultaneously infer unknown\nkinetic parameters and states. FMEnets can be implemented either as FME-PINNs,\nwhich employ conventional multilayer perceptrons, or as FME-KANs, based on\nKolmogorov-Arnold Networks. Comprehensive ablation studies highlight the\ncritical role of the FMEnets architecture in achieving accurate predictions.\nSpecifically, FME-KANs are more robust to noise than FME-PINNs, although both\nrepresentations are comparable in accuracy and speed in noise-free conditions.\nThe proposed framework is applied to three different sets of reaction scenarios\nand is compared with finite element simulations. FMEnets effectively captures\nthe complex interactions, achieving relative errors less than 2.5% for the\nunknown kinetic parameters.

    "abstract": "The monopulse technique is characterized by its high accuracy in angle\nestimation and simplicity in engineering implementation. However, in the\ncomplex electromagnetic environment, the presence of the mainlobe jamming (MLJ)\ngreatly degrades the accuracy of angle estimation. Conventional methods of\njamming suppression often lead to significant deviations in monopulse ratio\nwhile suppressing MLJ. Additionally, the monopulse technique based on\ntraditional radar cannot jointly estimate the target's range. In this paper,\nthe four-channel adaptive beamforming (ABF) algorithm is proposed, which adds a\ndelta-delta channel based on conventional sum-difference-difference\nthree-channel to suppress a single MLJ. Moreover, considering the suppression\nof multiple MLJs and sidelobe jammings (SLJs), the row-column ABF algorithm is\nproposed. This algorithm utilizes more spatial degrees of freedom (DOFs) to\nsuppress multiple jammings by the row-column adaptive beamforming at the\nsubarray level. The key ideal of both algorithms is to suppress MLJ with null\nalong one spatial direction while keeping the sum and difference beampatterns\nundistorted along another spatial direction. Therefore, the monopulse ratio\nremains undistorted while suppressing the MLJ, ensuring the accuracy of\nmonopulse parameter estimation. Furthermore, by utilizing the additional\ndegrees of freedom (DOFs) in the range domain provided by the multiple-input\nmultiple-output space-time coding array (MIMO-STCA) radar, joint angle-range\nestimation can be achieved through the monopulse technique. Simulation results\nhighlight the effectiveness of the proposed methods in suppressing multiple\nMLJs and enhancing the accuracy of monopulse parameter estimation, as verified\nby the low root mean square error (RMSE) in the parameter estimation results.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have gained widespread adoption across diverse\napplications due to their impressive generative capabilities. Their\nplug-and-play nature enables both developers and end users to interact with\nthese models through simple prompts. However, as LLMs become more integrated\ninto various systems in diverse domains, concerns around their security are\ngrowing. Existing studies mainly focus on threats arising from user prompts\n(e.g. prompt injection attack) and model output (e.g. model inversion attack),\nwhile the security of system prompts remains largely overlooked. This work\nbridges the critical gap. We introduce system prompt poisoning, a new attack\nvector against LLMs that, unlike traditional user prompt injection, poisons\nsystem prompts hence persistently impacts all subsequent user interactions and\nmodel responses. We systematically investigate four practical attack strategies\nin various poisoning scenarios. Through demonstration on both generative and\nreasoning LLMs, we show that system prompt poisoning is highly feasible without\nrequiring jailbreak techniques, and effective across a wide range of tasks,\nincluding those in mathematics, coding, logical reasoning, and natural language\nprocessing. Importantly, our findings reveal that the attack remains effective\neven when user prompts employ advanced prompting techniques like\nchain-of-thought (CoT). We also show that such techniques, including CoT and\nretrieval-augmentation-generation (RAG), which are proven to be effective for\nimproving LLM performance in a wide range of tasks, are significantly weakened\nin their effectiveness by system prompt poisoning.",

The proposed strategy is motivated by\ndata from the Human Epilepsy Project (HEP), which collects seizure occurrence\ndata for epilepsy patients, together with relevant covariates. The model is\ndesigned to flexibly accommodate the particular challenges that arise with such\ndata. First, epilepsy data require models that can allow for extensive\nheterogeneity, across both patients and time. With this regard, state space\nmodels offer a flexible, yet still analytically amenable class of models.\nNevertheless, seizure time-series might share similar behavioral patterns, such\nas local prolonged periods of elevated seizure presence, which we refer to as\n\"clumping\". Such similarities can be used to share strength across patients and\ndefine subgroups. However, due to the lack of alignment, straightforward\nhierarchical modeling of latent state space parameters is not practicable. To\novercome this constraint, we construct a strategy that preserves the\nflexibility of individual trajectories while also exploiting similarities\nacross individuals to borrow information through a nonparametric prior. On the\none hand, heterogeneity is ensured by (almost) subject-specific state-space\nsubmodels. On the other, borrowing of information is obtained by introducing a\nPitman-Yor prior on group-specific probabilities for patterns of clinical\ninterest. We design a posterior sampling strategy that leverages recent\ndevelopments of binary state space models using the Unified Skewed Normal\nfamily (SUN).

    "abstract": "Magnetic particle imaging (MPI) is an in vivo method to detect magnetic\nnanoparticles for cell tracking, vascular imaging, and molecular target imaging\nwithout ionizing radiation. Current magnetic particle imaging is accomplished\nby forming an field-free line (FFL) through a gradient selection field. By\ntranslating and rotating FFL under excitation and drive fields, the harmonic\ncomplex signal of a point source forms a Lorentzian-shape point spread function\non the plane perpendicular to FFL. The Lorentzian PSF has a finite size and\nlimited resolution due to the non-sharp Langevin function and weak selection\nfield. This study proposes a donut-shaped focal spot by borrowing the\nstimulated emission depletion (STED) fluorescence microscopy principle. The\ninfluence of the gradient selection field on the relaxation time of magnetic\nparticles determines the nonlinear phase shift of the harmonic complex signals,\nresulting in the formation of a donut-shaped focal spot. By subtracting the\ndonut-shaped focal spot from the Lorentzian focal spot, the STED focal spot\nsize was reduced by up to 4 times beyond the Langevin magnetization resolution\nbarrier. In human brain FFL-based MPI scanner, the donut-shaped focal spot can\nbe used to reconstruct images with super-resolution and super-sensitivity\nthrough the deconvoution of the STED focal spot and filtered backprojection\nalgorithm.",

    "abstract": "Network resilience, dynamically quantified by the Fiedler value\n(\\(\\lambda_2\\),the second smallest eigenvalue of the Laplacian matrix) ensures\nfunctional stability and efficient energy transmission, yet also introduces\nvulnerabilities that dismantling the resilience of the network can cause a\nfunctional breakdown of the network. However, traditional percolation\nstrategies focused on structural attacks often fail to effectively affect\nresilience and lack universal applicability. Here, we employ a Laplacian\nspectral perturbation approach to systematically identify and remove edges\ncritical to resilience. We derive the sensitivity of \\(\\lambda_2\\) to\ntopological changes and employ the gradient of Fiedler vector to measure each\nedge's contribution of resilience, revealing an intrinsic relationship to\ncommunity partition. Accordingly, we propose the Fiedler Gradient Iterative\nAttack (FGIA) algorithm, which constructs locally optimal edge removal\nsequences to maximize \\(\\lambda_2\\) degradation with significantly lower\ncomputational cost than brute-force methods. Our results offer a rigorous\napproach for inducing controlled resilience collapse, with potential\napplications in neuroscience and critical infrastructure protection.",

Early investigations were based on the\nleading-spot hypothesis for the sun and yielded contradictory results. Here, we\nanalyzed the flare-associated t-IVdm burst on 20110924 with medium-strong\nlevels of polarization and from sources near a sunspot. We found that the\nemission is intermittent and the maximum $T_B$ exceeds 10$^{11}$ K, with\nwell-defined upper and lower frequency cutoffs. The radio sources are\nleft-handed polarized, located above the sunspot with a negative polarity. The\nsources align well with the sites of the second harmonic of the local electron\ngyrofrequency. These findings provide essential evidence that the burst is\ninduced by the electron cyclotron maser emission (ECME) in the harmonic X mode.\nWe further modeled the transport of downward-streaming energetic electrons\nalong a coronal loop and found most electrons get mirrored within the specific\naltitude range of 20-100 Mm. This explains why such bursts tend to have\nwell-defined spectral ranges. We also found the ECME-radiating energetic\nelectrons exhibit a shell-like VDF instead of the generally-presumed loss-cone\ndistribution. The study greatly expands the application of ECME in solar radio\nastronomy and provides solar samples for similar bursts from other flaring\nstars.",

    "abstract": "We investigate in-context learning (ICL) through a meticulous experimental\nframework that systematically varies task complexity and model architecture.\nExtending beyond the linear regression baseline, we introduce Gaussian kernel\nregression and nonlinear dynamical system tasks, which emphasize temporal and\nrecursive reasoning. We evaluate four distinct models: a GPT2-style\nTransformer, a Transformer with FlashAttention mechanism, a convolutional\nHyena-based model, and the Mamba state-space model. Each model is trained from\nscratch on synthetic datasets and assessed for generalization during testing.\nOur findings highlight that model architecture significantly shapes ICL\nperformance. The standard Transformer demonstrates robust performance across\ndiverse tasks, while Mamba excels in temporally structured dynamics. Hyena\neffectively captures long-range dependencies but shows higher variance early in\ntraining, and FlashAttention offers computational efficiency but is more\nsensitive in low-data regimes. Further analysis uncovers locality-induced\nshortcuts in Gaussian kernel tasks, enhanced nonlinear separability through\ninput range scaling, and the critical role of curriculum learning in mastering\nhigh-dimensional tasks.",

    "abstract": "Climate modeling is reaching unprecedented resolution, producing petabytes of\ndata. AI climate model emulators offer a path to computationally cheap\nanalysis, enabling new scientific insight and scenario planning. Recent\nadvances show promise in faithfully emulating climate data. However, prevailing\nauto-regressive paradigms are difficult to train on climate time horizons due\nto drifts, instabilities, and component-coupling challenges. They are hard to\nscale to high resolution and require sifting through troves of output to\nidentify rare extremes of interest. We present Climate in a Bottle (cBottle), a\ngenerative diffusion-based framework emulating global 5 km climate simulations\nand reanalysis on the HEALPix grid. cBottle samples directly from the full\ndistribution of atmospheric states, avoiding auto-regressive rollout, and is\nthe first to reach this 12.5M-pixel global resolution. It consists of two\nstages: a coarse-resolution generator conditioned on sea surface temperatures\nand solar position, followed by a patch-based 16x super-resolution stage.\ncBottle passes a battery of tests, including diurnal-to-seasonal variability,\nlarge-scale modes of variability, tropical cyclone statistics, and trends of\nclimate change and weather extremes. It is a step toward a foundation model:\nbridging data modalities (reanalysis and simulation), enabling zero-shot bias\ncorrection, downscaling, and data infilling. It also enables new interactivity\nvia guided diffusion. For example, we train a tropical cyclone (TC) classifier\nalongside the generator, guide towards TC states, and obtain physically\ncredible samples. This opens the door to guidance methods for a wide array of\nuser queries and new ways of interacting with climate data.",

    "abstract": "Electrochemical hybrid battery models have major potential to enable advanced\nphysics-based control, diagnostic, and prognostic features for next-generation\nlithium-ion battery management systems. This is due to the physical\nsignificance of the electrochemical model, which is complemented by a machine\nlearning model that compensates for output prediction errors caused by system\nuncertainties. While hybrid models have demonstrated robust output prediction\nperformance under large system uncertainties, they are highly susceptible to\nthe influence of uncertainties during parameter identification, which can\ncompromise the physical significance of the model. To address this challenge,\nwe present a parameter estimation framework that explicitly considers system\nuncertainties through a discrepancy function. The approach also incorporates a\ndownsampling procedure to address the computational barriers associated with\nlarge time-series data sets, as are typical in the battery domain. The\nframework was validated in simulation, yielding several mean parameter\nestimation errors that were one order of magnitude smaller than those of the\nconventional least squares approach. While developed for the high-uncertainty,\nelectrochemical hybrid modeling context, the estimation framework is applicable\nto all models and is presented in a generalized form.",

    "abstract": "Let (\\mathcal{F}(n)) be the graph of (n)-vertex triangulations of the\n3-sphere (S^3), with edges as bistellar 2--3 and 3--2 moves. Pachner's theorem\n\\cite{P91} shows the flip graph is connected with 1--4 and 4--1 moves, but\n(\\mathcal{F}(n)) loses connectivity: it is connected for (5 \\leq n \\leq 9)\n((n=5) minimal for (S^3)) but splits into multiple components at (n=16),\n(n=20), (n=21), and likely beyond. The polytopal closure of (\\mathcal{F}(n)) is\nthe component with all boundary complexes of convex 4-polytopes. We prove\n(\\mathcal{F}(10)) and (\\mathcal{F}(11)) are connected by showing: every\nnon-polytopal 10-vertex seed triangulation (no 3--2 flips) is one 2--3 flip\nfrom a convex-polytope boundary, and every 11-vertex seed triangulation arises\nfrom a 10-vertex convex polytope via a 1--4 flip and 2--3 or 3--2 flips, both\nin the polytopal closure. We address four unflippable (S^3) complexes ((U(16)),\n(U(20)), (U_1(21)), (U_2(21))), showing each connects to the polytopal closure\nof (\\mathcal{F}(n+1)) after one 1--4 vertex insertion and an annealing process\nmaximizing removable-vertex chains.
