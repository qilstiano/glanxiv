    "abstract": "Neural oscillations facilitate the functioning of the human brain in spatial\nand temporal dimensions at various frequencies. These oscillations feature a\nuniversal frequency architecture that is governed by brain anatomy, ensuring\nfrequency specificity remains invariant across different measurement\ntechniques. Initial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methodology constrained\nfunctional MRI (fMRI) investigations to a singular frequency range, thereby\nneglecting the frequency characteristics inherent in blood oxygen\nlevel-dependent oscillations. With advancements in MRI technology, it has\nbecome feasible to decode intricate brain activities via multi-band frequency\nanalysis (MBFA). During the past decade, the utilization of MBFA in fMRI\nstudies has surged, unveiling frequency-dependent characteristics of\nspontaneous slow oscillations (SSOs) believed to base dark energy in the brain.\nThere remains a dearth of conclusive insights and hypotheses pertaining to the\nproperties and functionalities of SSOs in distinct bands. We surveyed the SSO\nMBFA studies during the past 15 years to delineate the attributes of SSOs and\nenlighten their correlated functions. We further proposed a model to elucidate\nthe hierarchical organization of multi-band SSOs by integrating their function,\naimed at bridging theoretical gaps and guiding future MBFA research endeavors.",

    "abstract": "We present an Adversarially Pre-trained Transformer (APT) that is able to\nperform zero-shot meta-learning on tabular prediction tasks without\npre-training on any real-world dataset, extending on the recent development of\nPrior-Data Fitted Networks (PFNs) and TabPFN. Specifically, APT is pre-trained\nwith adversarial synthetic data agents, who continue to shift their underlying\ndata generating distribution and deliberately challenge the model with\ndifferent synthetic datasets. In addition, we propose a mixture block\narchitecture that is able to handle classification tasks with arbitrary number\nof classes, addressing the class size limitation -- a crucial weakness of prior\ndeep tabular zero-shot learners. In experiments, we show that our framework\nmatches state-of-the-art performance on small classification tasks without\nfiltering on dataset characteristics such as number of classes and number of\nmissing values, while maintaining an average runtime under one second. On\ncommon benchmark dataset suites in both classification and regression, we show\nthat adversarial pre-training was able to enhance TabPFN's performance. In our\nanalysis, we demonstrate that the adversarial synthetic data agents were able\nto generate a more diverse collection of data compared to the ordinary random\ngenerator in TabPFN.

    "abstract": "Interest in vibrational polaritonic chemistry, where ground-state chemical\nkinetics are modified via confined optical modes in a cavity, has surged in\nrecent years. Although models have been developed to understand cavity-modified\nreactions, fully quantum mechanical simulations remain out of reach for the\ncollective regime that involves many molecules, a critical aspect of the\nphenomenon. Mixed quantum-classical (MQC) simulations offer a scalable\nalternative, but their accuracy requires testing and potential improvements\neven in the single-molecule limit. In this work, we take this step by first\nintroducing the mapping approach to surface hopping (MASH) to address the\nlimitations of traditional MQC methods. Second, we incorporate a quantum\ntreatment of the cavity mode, moving beyond the classical approximations often\nemployed in previous studies. Results for a single-molecule model of\nvibrational polaritonic chemistry show that combining MASH with a quantum\ncavity mode yields the most accurate rates. However, this scheme may produce\ndifferent long-time population dynamics at zero coupling depending on whether\nthe cavity mode is quantized; a problem known as size-inconsistency in MASH. We\naddress this problem proposing the $\\epsilon$-MASH approach, which forbids\nhopping between states with negligible nonadiabatic couplings (NACs). Combining\nMASH with a quantum cavity mode thus provides a promising approach for scalable\nand accurate MQC simulations in the collective regime.",

Increase in urbanization leads to increase in accidents and\ntraffic congestion in junction areas resulting in delayed travel time. In order\nto solve these problems, an intelligent system utilizing automatic detection\nand tracking system is significant. But this becomes a challenging task at road\nintersection areas which require a wide range of field view. For this reason,\nfish eye cameras are widely used in real time vehicle detection purpose to\nprovide large area coverage and 360 degree view at junctions.

The\nproposed scheme for detecting vehicles in fish-eye images consists of a\nlight-weight day-night CNN classifier so that two different solutions can be\nimplemented to address the day-night detection issues. Furthurmore, challenging\ninstances are upsampled in the dataset for proper localization of vehicles and\nlater on the detection model is ensembled and trained in different combination\nof vehicle datasets for better generalization, detection and accuracy.

    "abstract": "Recently, optically active spin defects embedded in van der Waals (vdW)\ncrystals have emerged as a transformative quantum sensing platform to explore\ncutting-edge materials science and quantum physics. Taking advantage of\nexcellent solid-state integrability, this new class of spin defects can be\narranged in controllable nanoscale proximity of target materials in vdW\nheterostructures, showing great promise for improving spatial resolution and\nfield sensitivity of current sensing technologies. Building on this\nstate-of-the-art measurement platform, here we report hexagonal boron\nnitride-based quantum imaging of field-free deterministic magnetic switching of\nroom-temperature two-dimensional magnet Fe3GaTe2 in an all-vdW spin-orbit\ntorque (SOT) system. By visualizing SOT-driven variations of nanoscale Fe3GaTe2\nmagnetic stray field profile under different conditions, we have revealed how\nthe observed magnetic switching evolves from deterministic to indeterministic\nbehavior due to the interplay between out-of-plane spins, in-plane spins and\nJoule heating. This understanding, which is otherwise difficult to access by\nconventional transport measurements, offers valuable insights on material\ndesign, testing, and evaluation of next-generation vdW spintronic devices.",

    "abstract": "By generalizing the eta-pairing theory to non-Hermitian Hubbard models on\narbitrary lattices, we obtain the sufficient and necessary condition for the\neta-pairing operator to be an eigenoperator of the Hamiltonian $H$, and find\nunique eta-pairing phenomena without Hermitian analogs. For instance, the\nHermitian conjugate of an eta-pairing eigenoperator may not be an\neigenoperator, eta-pairing eigenoperators can be spatially modulated, and the\n$SU(2)$ pseudospin symmetry may not be respected even if $H$ commutes with the\neta-pairing operators. Remarkably, these novel non-Hermitian phenomena are\nclosely related to each other by several theorems we establish and can lead to,\ne.g., the notion of non-Hermitian angular-momentum operators and the anomalous\nlocalization of eta-pairing eigenstates. Some issues on the $SO(4)$ and\nparticle-hole symmetries are clarified. Our general eta-pairing theory also\nreveals a previously unnoticed unification of these symmetries of the Hubbard\nmodel. To exemplify these findings, we propose the Hatano-Nelson-Hubbard model.\nIn this interacting non-Hermitian system without even the bulk translation\ninvariance, the right and left two-particle eta-pairing eigenstates are\nexponentially localized at opposite boundaries of the chain. We then generalize\nthis model to two dimensions and find that the eta-pairing eigenstate can\nexhibit the first- or second-order skin effect. Thus, eta-pairing may represent\na new mechanism for skin effects in interacting non-Hermitian systems, even in\nhigher dimensions and without the bulk translation symmetry. To realize all of\nthe non-Hermitian eta-pairing phenomena, we construct a general two-sublattice\nmodel defined on an arbitrary lattice, which can exhibit anomalous localization\nof eta-pairing eigenstates; besides, this model can reveal the eta-pairing\nstructure [e.g., the $SO(4)$ symmetry] in systems with Hermitian hoppings.",

To solve PIRD, we define a pointwise redundancy rate function based on\nthe minimum MI principle applied locally in the frequency-domain representation\nof the processes. The framework is validated in benchmark simulations of\nGaussian systems, demonstrating its advantages over traditional PID in\ncapturing temporal correlations and showing how the spectral representation may\nreveal scale-specific higher-order interactions that are obscured in the time\ndomain. Furthermore, we apply PIRD to a physiological network comprising\ncerebrovascular and cardiovascular variables, revealing frequency-dependent\nredundant information exchange during a protocol of postural stress.

    "abstract": "Phylogenetic analysis traditionally relies on labor-intensive manual\nextraction of morphological traits, limiting its scalability for large\ndatasets. Recent advances in deep learning offer the potential to automate this\nprocess, but the effectiveness of different morphological representations for\nphylogenetic trait extraction remains poorly understood. In this study, we\ncompare the performance of deep learning models using three distinct\nmorphological representations - full segmentations, binary masks, and Fourier\ndescriptors of beetle outlines. We test this on the Rove-Tree-11 dataset, a\ncurated collection of images from 215 rove beetle species. Our results\ndemonstrate that the mask-based model outperformed the others, achieving a\nnormalized Align Score of 0.33 plus/minus 0.02 on the test set, compared to\n0.45 plus/minus 0.01 for the Fourier-based model and 0.39 plus/minus 0.07 for\nthe segmentation-based model. The performance of the mask-based model likely\nreflects its ability to capture shape features while taking advantage of the\ndepth and capacity of the ResNet50 architecture. These results also indicate\nthat dorsal textural features, at least in this group of beetles, may be of\nlowered phylogenetic relevance, though further investigation is necessary to\nconfirm this. In contrast, the Fourier-based model suffered from reduced\ncapacity and occasional inaccuracies in outline approximations, particularly in\nfine structures like legs. These findings highlight the importance of selecting\nappropriate morphological representations for automated phylogenetic studies\nand the need for further research into explainability in automatic\nmorphological trait extraction.",

We\nhave discovered that in methylammonium lead iodide, this hysteretic metastable\nphase is athermal, meaning it shows almost no temporal phase evolution under\nisothermal conditions. We also show that a large number of distinguishable\nmetastable states can be prepared following different thermal pathways.\nFurthermore, under a reversible thermal perturbation, the states in the\nmetastable phase either show return-point memory or undergo a systematic\nnonrecoverable phase evolution, depending on the thermal history and the sign\nof the temperature perturbation. Since the phase fraction can be probed with\nextreme sensitivity via luminescence, we have an optically retrievable memory\nthat reliably records any breach in temperature stability.

We discover that the transformer-based encoder adopted in recent\nyears is actually capable of performing the alignment internally during the\nforward pass, prior to decoding. This new phenomenon enables a simpler and more\nefficient model, the \"Aligner-Encoder\". To train it, we discard the dynamic\nprogramming of RNN-T in favor of the frame-wise cross-entropy loss of AED,\nwhile the decoder employs the lighter text-only recurrence of RNN-T without\nlearned cross-attention -- it simply scans embedding frames in order from the\nbeginning, producing one token each until predicting the end-of-message. We\nconduct experiments demonstrating performance remarkably close to the state of\nthe art, including a special inference configuration enabling long-form\nrecognition. In a representative comparison, we measure the total inference\ntime for our model to be 2x faster than RNN-T and 16x faster than AED.

To address this,\nwe propose AnyPlace, a two-stage method trained entirely on synthetic data,\ncapable of predicting a wide range of feasible placement poses for real-world\ntasks. Our key insight is that by leveraging a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to\nidentify rough placement locations, we focus only on the relevant regions for\nlocal placement, which enables us to train the low-level\nplacement-pose-prediction model to capture diverse placements efficiently. For\ntraining, we generate a fully synthetic dataset of randomly generated objects\nin different placement configurations (insertion, stacking, hanging) and train\nlocal placement-prediction models. We conduct extensive evaluations in\nsimulation, demonstrating that our method outperforms baselines in terms of\nsuccess rate, coverage of possible placement modes, and precision. In\nreal-world experiments, we show how our approach directly transfers models\ntrained purely on synthetic data to the real world, where it successfully\nperforms placements in scenarios where other models struggle -- such as with\nvarying object geometries, diverse placement modes, and achieving high\nprecision for fine placement.

    "abstract": "Efficient use of cultivated areas is a necessary factor for sustainable\ndevelopment of agriculture and ensuring food security. Along with the rapid\ndevelopment of satellite technologies in developed countries, new methods are\nbeing searched for accurate and operational identification of cultivated areas.\nIn this context, identification of cropland boundaries based on spectral\nanalysis of data obtained from satellite images is considered one of the most\noptimal and accurate methods in modern agriculture. This article proposes a new\napproach to determine the suitability and green index of cultivated areas using\nsatellite data obtained through the \"Google Earth Engine\" (GEE) platform. In\nthis approach, two powerful algorithms, \"SNIC (Simple Non-Iterative Clustering)\nSuper Pixels\" and \"Canny Edge Detection Method\", are combined. The SNIC\nalgorithm combines pixels in a satellite image into larger regions (super\npixels) with similar characteristics, thereby providing better image analysis.\nThe Canny Edge Detection Method detects sharp changes (edges) in the image to\ndetermine the precise boundaries of agricultural fields. This study, carried\nout using high-resolution multispectral data from the Sentinel-2 satellite and\nthe Google Earth Engine JavaScript API, has shown that the proposed method is\neffective in accurately and reliably classifying randomly selected agricultural\nfields. The combined use of these two tools allows for more accurate\ndetermination of the boundaries of agricultural fields by minimizing the\neffects of outliers in satellite images. As a result, more accurate and\nreliable maps can be created for agricultural monitoring and resource\nmanagement over large areas based on the obtained data.

Several AI-text\ndetectors have been developed in response, which typically utilize a fixed\nglobal threshold (e.g., $\\theta = 0.5$) to classify machine-generated text.\nHowever, one universal threshold could fail to account for distributional\nvariations by subgroups.

This is particularly relevant for\nthe governance of AI-generated media, or synthetic media, an emergent visual\ntechnology that impacts how people interpret online content and perceive media\nas records of reality. Studying the stakeholders affecting synthetic media\ngovernance is vital to assessing safeguards that help audiences make sense of\ncontent in the AI age; yet there is little qualitative research about how key\nactors from civil society, industry, media, and policy collaborate to\nconceptualize, develop, and implement such practices. This paper addresses this\ngap by analyzing 23 in-depth, semi-structured interviews with stakeholders\ngoverning synthetic media from across sectors alongside two real-world cases of\nmultistakeholder synthetic media governance. Inductive coding reveals key\nthemes affecting synthetic media governance, including how temporal\nperspectives-spanning past, present, and future-mediate stakeholder\ndecision-making and rulemaking on synthetic media. Analysis also reveals the\ncritical role of trust, both among stakeholders and between audiences and\ninterventions, as well as the limitations of technical transparency measures\nlike AI labels for supporting effective synthetic media governance. These\nfindings not only inform the evidence-based design of synthetic media policy\nthat serves audiences encountering content, but they also contribute to the\nliterature on multistakeholder AI governance overall through rare insight into\nreal world examples of such processes.",

This paper presents ImprovNet, a transformer-based\narchitecture that generates expressive and controllable musical improvisations\nthrough a self-supervised corruption-refinement training strategy. The\nimprovisational style transfer is aimed at making meaningful modifications to\none or more musical elements - melody, harmony or rhythm of the original\ncomposition with respect to the target genre.

    "abstract": "Although learning-based models hold great promise for MRI reconstruction,\nsingle-site models built on limited local datasets often suffer from poor\ngeneralization. This challenge has spurred interest in collaborative model\ntraining on multi-site datasets via federated learning (FL) -- a\nprivacy-preserving framework that aggregates model updates instead of sharing\nimaging data. Conventional FL aggregates locally trained model weights into a\nglobal model, inherently constraining all sites to use a homogeneous model\narchitecture. This rigidity forces sites to compromise on architectures\ntailored to their compute resources and application-specific needs, making\nconventional FL unsuitable for model-heterogeneous settings where each site may\nprefer a distinct architecture. To overcome this limitation, we introduce\nFedGAT, a novel model-agnostic FL technique based on generative autoregressive\ntransformers. FedGAT decentralizes the training of a global generative prior\nthat learns the distribution of multi-site MR images. For high-fidelity\nsynthesis, we propose a novel site-prompted GAT prior that controllably\nsynthesizes realistic MR images from desired sites via autoregressive\nprediction across spatial scales. Each site then trains its own reconstruction\nmodel -- using an architecture of its choice -- on a hybrid dataset augmenting\nits local MRI dataset with GAT-generated synthetic MR images emulating datasets\nfrom other sites. This hybrid training strategy enables site-specific\nreconstruction models to generalize more effectively across diverse data\ndistributions while preserving data privacy. Comprehensive experiments on\nmulti-institutional datasets demonstrate that FedGAT enables flexible,\nmodel-heterogeneous collaborations and achieves superior within-site and\ncross-site reconstruction performance compared to state-of-the-art FL\nbaselines.",

    "abstract": "Reward-guided text generation (RGTG) has emerged as a viable alternative to\noffline reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). RGTG methods can\nalign baseline language models to human preferences without further training\nlike in standard RLHF methods. However, they rely on a reward model to score\neach candidate token generated by the language model at inference, incurring\nsignificant test-time overhead. Additionally, the reward model is usually only\ntrained to score full sequences, which can lead to sub-optimal choices for\npartial sequences. In this work, we present a novel reward model architecture\nthat is trained, using a Bradley-Terry loss, to prefer the optimal expansion of\na sequence with just a \\emph{single call} to the reward model at each step of\nthe generation process. That is, a score for all possible candidate tokens is\ngenerated simultaneously, leading to efficient inference. We theoretically\nanalyze various RGTG reward models and demonstrate that prior techniques prefer\nsub-optimal sequences compared to our method during inference. Empirically, our\nreward model leads to significantly faster inference than other RGTG methods.\nIt requires fewer calls to the reward model and performs competitively compared\nto previous RGTG and offline RLHF methods.",

    "abstract": "Spanwise wall forcing in the form of streamwise-travelling waves is applied\nto the suction side of a transonic airfoil with a shock wave to reduce\naerodynamic drag. The study, conducted using direct numerical simulations,\nextends earlier findings by Quadrio et al. (J. Fluid Mech. vol. 942, 2022, R2)\nand confirms that the wall manipulation shifts the shock wave on the suction\nside towards the trailing edge of the profile, thereby enhancing its\naerodynamic efficiency. A parametric study over the parameters of wall forcing\nis carried out for the Mach number set at 0.7 and the Reynolds number at\n300,000. Similarities and differences with the incompressible plane case are\ndiscussed; for the first time, we describe how the interaction between the\nshock wave and the boundary layer is influenced by flow control via spanwise\nforcing. With suitable combinations of control parameters, the shock is\ndelayed, and results in a separated region whose length correlates well with\nfriction reduction. The analysis of the transient process following the sudden\napplication of control is used to link flow separation with the intensification\nof the shock wave.",

    "abstract": "Medical time series has been playing a vital role in real-world healthcare\nsystems as valuable information in monitoring health conditions of patients.\nAccurate classification for medical time series, e.g., Electrocardiography\n(ECG) signals, can help for early detection and diagnosis. Traditional methods\ntowards medical time series classification rely on handcrafted feature\nextraction and statistical methods; with the recent advancement of artificial\nintelligence, the machine learning and deep learning methods have become more\npopular. However, existing methods often fail to fully model the complex\nspatial dynamics under different scales, which ignore the dynamic\nmulti-resolution spatial and temporal joint inter-dependencies. Moreover, they\nare less likely to consider the special baseline wander problem as well as the\nmulti-view characteristics of medical time series, which largely hinders their\nprediction performance. To address these limitations, we propose a\nMulti-resolution Spatiotemporal Graph Learning framework, MedGNN, for medical\ntime series classification. Specifically, we first propose to construct\nmulti-resolution adaptive graph structures to learn dynamic multi-scale\nembeddings. Then, to address the baseline wander problem, we propose Difference\nAttention Networks to operate self-attention mechanisms on the finite\ndifference for temporal modeling. Moreover, to learn the multi-view\ncharacteristics, we utilize the Frequency Convolution Networks to capture\ncomplementary information of medical time series from the frequency domain. In\naddition, we introduce the Multi-resolution Graph Transformer architecture to\nmodel the dynamic dependencies and fuse the information from different\nresolutions. Finally, we have conducted extensive experiments on multiple\nmedical real-world datasets that demonstrate the superior performance of our\nmethod. Our Code is available.",

    "abstract": "A dedicated search for upward-going air showers at zenith angles exceeding\n$110^\\circ$ and energies $E>0.1$ EeV has been performed using the Fluorescence\nDetector of the Pierre Auger Observatory. The search is motivated by two\n\"anomalous\" radio pulses observed by the ANITA flights I and III which appear\ninconsistent with the Standard Model of particle physics. Using simulations of\nboth regular cosmic ray showers and upward-going events, a selection procedure\nhas been defined to separate potential upward-going candidate events and the\ncorresponding exposure has been calculated in the energy range [0.1-33] EeV.\nOne event has been found in the search period between 1 Jan 2004 and 31 Dec\n2018, consistent with an expected background of $0.27 \\pm 0.12$ events from\nmis-reconstructed cosmic ray showers. This translates to an upper bound on the\nintegral flux of $(7.2 \\pm 0.2) \\times 10^{-21}$ cm$^{-2}$ sr$^{-1}$ y$^{-1}$\nand $(3.6 \\pm 0.2) \\times 10^{-20}$ cm$^{-2}$ sr$^{-1}$ y$^{-1}$ for an\n$E^{-1}$ and $E^{-2}$ spectrum, respectively. An upward-going flux of showers\nnormalized to the ANITA observations is shown to predict over 34 events for an\n$E^{-3}$ spectrum and over 8.1 events for a conservative $E^{-5}$ spectrum, in\nstrong disagreement with the interpretation of the anomalous events as\nupward-going showers.",

    "abstract": "There are numerous devices currently known with the purpose of reducing the\nirregularity of the flow upstream of the propeller and to decrease by that\nmeans the propeller-induced vibration and noise. Many of these devices are\nwing-shaped vortex-generators that affect the flow with their induced (i.e.\npassive) longitudinal vortices. The paper's subject is the use of a ring-shaped\nwing as a highly effective passive vortex-generator which allows to control the\nflow closer to the most charged sections of propeller blades. The problem of a\nthin ring-shaped wing with irregular (asymmetric) geometry in the irregular\nsteady flow has been solved in a linear approach and the intensity of the\ninduced longitudinal vortices as a function of the irregularity of the flow and\nthe geometry of the ring wing has been estimated using that solution.\nExperiments in the towing tank showing good concordance with the theoretical\nmodel confirmed the effectiveness of such a device. Some additional advantages\nof a ring-shaped wing incorporated into the construction of stabilizers are\nconsidered.",

Given a pool of LLM experts and a utility function,\nHeterogeneous Swarms employs two iterative steps: role-step and weight-step.\nFor role-step, we interpret model roles as learning a DAG that specifies the\nflow of inputs and outputs between LLMs. Starting from a swarm of random\ncontinuous adjacency matrices, we decode them into discrete DAGs, call the LLMs\nin topological order, evaluate on the utility function (e.g. accuracy on a\ntask), and optimize the adjacency matrices with particle swarm optimization\nbased on the utility score. For weight-step, we assess the contribution of\nindividual LLMs in the multi-LLM systems and optimize model weights with swarm\nintelligence.

The crucial question we need to\nanswer is where this event comes from and what its source is. Intriguingly,\nIceCube has been operating with a much larger effective area for a considerably\nlonger time, yet it has not reported neutrinos above 10~PeV. We quantify the\ntension between the KM3NeT event and the absence of similar high-energy events\nin IceCube. Through a detailed analysis, we determine the most likely neutrino\nenergy to be in the range of 23 - 2400 PeV. We find a $3.5\\sigma$ tension\nbetween the two experiments, assuming the neutrino is from the diffuse\nisotropic neutrino flux. Alternatively, assuming the event is of cosmogenic\norigin and considering three representative models, this tension still falls\nwithin 3.1 - 3.6$\\sigma$. The least disfavored scenario is a steady or\ntransient point source, though still leading to $2.9\\sigma$ and $2.0\\sigma$\ntensions, respectively. The lack of observation of high-energy events in\nIceCube seriously challenges the explanation of this event coming from any\nknown diffuse fluxes.

This paper introduces sliding tile attention (STA) to\naddress this challenge. STA leverages the observation that attention scores in\npretrained video diffusion models predominantly concentrate within localized 3D\nwindows. By sliding and attending over the local spatial-temporal region, STA\neliminates redundancy from full attention. Unlike traditional token-wise\nsliding window attention (SWA), STA operates tile-by-tile with a novel\nhardware-aware sliding window design, preserving expressiveness while being\nhardware-efficient. With careful kernel-level optimizations, STA offers the\nfirst efficient 2D/3D sliding-window-like attention implementation, achieving\n58.79% MFU. Precisely, STA accelerates attention by 2.8-17x over\nFlashAttention-2 (FA2) and 1.6-10x over FlashAttention-3 (FA3). On the leading\nvideo DiT, HunyuanVideo, STA reduces end-to-end latency from 945s (FA3) to 685s\nwithout quality degradation, requiring no training.

In this paper, we\npropose InvarExplore, a unified framework that systematically explores\ndifferent model invariance at the same time, allowing us to take advantage of\nthe synergy between each type of invariance. Importantly, InvarExplore features\na discrete search algorithm that enables us to explore permutation invariance,\nwhich is under-studied as it cannot be optimized with gradient-based methods.\nResults show that InvarExplore is compatible with existing state-of-the-art\nmethods, achieving an add-on performance improvement over strong competing\nmethods.",

In QC$_2$D, both theoretical and numerical studies derive the\npresence of the so-called baryon superfluid phase at sufficiently large\nchemical potential ($\\mu_q$), where diquark condensates govern the ground\nstate. The hadron mass spectrum simulated in this phase shows that the mass of\nan iso-singlet ($I=0$) and $0^-$ state is remarkably reduced, but such a mode\ncannot be described by the chiral perturbation theory.

To address this, three main phase-field approaches have\nemerged, each attempting to reconcile material strength and toughness. The\nfirst, known as the classical variational approach, preserves the variational\nstructure but fails to accurately incorporate the strength surface. In\ncontrast, the other two approaches -- the complete nucleation and hybrid\ncohesive zone models -- sacrifice variational consistency. Among these, only\nthe complete nucleation approach precisely accounts for the strength surface.\nAll three approaches, especially the second one, deviate from the sharp\nvariational theory of brittle fracture, raising concerns about their\nreliability in predicting the growth of cracks under non-mode-I loading. This\npaper evaluates precisely this issue. It is the first in a series of studies\ncomparing the three approaches, systematically investigating crack growth under\nmode II, mode III, and mixed-mode loadings. The results confirm that the\ncomplete nucleation approach effectively predicts crack growth across all\ninvestigated problems, and its predictions agree well with those from other two\napproaches for tension-dominated cases. Additionally, the findings highlight\nthat inaccurate accounting of the strength surface in the classical variational\napproach can influence crack path predictions. Lastly, they reveal that\nmodifying the crack driving force to incorporate the strength surface in the\nhybrid cohesive zone approach causes crack propagation at an incorrect fracture\ntoughness.",

By posing clarifying questions, LLM agents can acquire additional task\nspecifications, progressively narrowing the space of viable solutions and\nreducing the risk of generating unsatisfactory outputs. Yet, generating\neffective clarifying questions requires LLM agents to engage in a form of\nmeta-cognitive reasoning, an ability LLMs may presently lack. Our proposed\napproach of active task disambiguation enables LLM agents to generate targeted\nquestions maximizing the information gain. Effectively, this approach shifts\nthe load from implicit to explicit reasoning about the space of viable\nsolutions.

Then we test how tau_dep and eff vary as functions of the regional\nmass-weighted mean molecular gas properties on cloud scales (60-150pc): gas\nsurface density, <Sigma_mol^cloud>, velocity dispersion, <sigma_mol^cloud>,\nvirial parameter, <alpha_vir^cloud>, and gravitational free-fall time,\n<tau_ff^cloud>. <tau_ff^cloud> and tau_dep correlate positively, consistent\nwith the expectation that gas density plays a key role in setting the rate of\nstar formation.

This paper stands out\nas the first work to comprehensively study the task of explaining audio\ndifferences and then propose benchmark, baselines for the task. First, we\npresent two new datasets for audio difference explanation derived from the\nAudioCaps and Clotho audio captioning datasets. Using Large Language Models\n(LLMs), we generate three levels of difference explanations: (1) concise\ndescriptions of audio events and objects, (2) brief sentences about audio\nevents, acoustic scenes, and signal properties, and (3) comprehensive\nexplanations that include semantics and listener emotions. For the baseline, we\nuse prefix tuning where audio embeddings from two audio files are used to\nprompt a frozen language model. Our empirical analysis and ablation studies\nreveal that the naive baseline struggles to distinguish perceptually similar\nsounds and generate detailed tier 3 explanations. To address these limitations,\nwe propose ADIFF, which introduces a cross-projection module, position\ncaptioning, and a three-step training process to enhance the model's ability to\nproduce detailed explanations.

A simple\nmultiwavelength average of foam-induced blurring consistent with holographic\nquantum gravity is described, analogous to atmospheric seeing from the ground.\nThis fits with measured instrumental point-spread functions and with the\nhighest-energy localization of GRB221009A, resolving the observational issues\nand pointing to a key physical implication: spacetime does not look smooth.",

When the quantum\nresources such as squeezing has been widely explored, light-mater interaction\nsystems set up a highly controllable platform applicable for QM in novel\npursuit of high MP. However, critical QM by the conventional linear interaction\nis confronted with the restriction of low-frequency-limit condition and the\ndetrimental problem of diverging preparation time of the probe state (PTPS).\nThis work shows that mixed interactions by linear and nonlinear light-matter\ncouplings in the presence of bias field can provide various quantum resources,\nincluding squeezing, degeneracy lifting, displacement and quantum phase\ntransition. These resources manifest high sensitivity for QM as demonstrated by\nanalytically obtained critical components or exponential behavior of quantum\nFisher information. We find that these sensitivity resources can be combined to\nupgrade the upper bound of MP by many orders over the widely-applied squeezing\nresource. As further advantages, such an upgraded metrology protocol not only\nbreaks the frequency-limit restrictions but also avoids the detrimental problem\nof diverging PTPS which were both encountered in linear interaction.

    "abstract": "Normative mapping is a framework used to map population-level features of\nhealth-related variables. It is widely used in neuroscience research, but the\nliterature lacks established protocols in modalities that do not support\nhealthy control measurements, such as intracranial EEG (icEEG). An icEEG\nnormative map would allow researchers to learn about population-level brain\nactivity and enable comparison of individual data against these norms to\nidentify abnormalities. Currently, no standardised guide exists for\ntransforming clinical data into a normative, regional icEEG map. Papers often\ncite different software and numerous articles to summarise the lengthy method,\nmaking it laborious for other researchers to understand or apply the process.\nOur protocol seeks to remedy this gap by providing a dataflow guide and key\ndecision points that summarise existing methods. This protocol is used heavily\nin published works from our own lab (twelve peer-reviewed journal\npublications). Briefly, we take as input, icEEG recordings and neuroimaging\ndata from people with epilepsy who are undergoing evaluation for resective\nsurgery. As final outputs, we obtain a normative icEEG map, comprising signal\nproperties localised to brain regions. Optionally, we can also process new\nsubjects through the same pipeline and obtain their z-scores (or centiles) in\neach brain region, for abnormality detection and localisation. To date, a\nsingle, cohesive, dataflow pipeline for generating normative icEEG maps, along\nwith abnormality mapping, has not been created. We envisage that this dataflow\nguide will not only increase understanding and application of normative mapping\nmethods, but will also improve the consistency and quality of studies in the\nfield.",

Learning a quantum channel in this way presents\ndifficulties, due to the fact that two channels may act similarly on low energy\ninputs but very differently for high energy inputs. They may also act similarly\non coherent state inputs but differently on non-classical inputs. Extrapolating\nthe behaviour of a channel for more general input states from its action on the\nfar more limited set of low energy coherent states is a case of\nout-of-distribution generalisation. To be sure that such generalisation gives\nmeaningful results, one needs to relate error bounds for the training set to\nbounds that are valid for all inputs. We show that for any pair of channels\nthat act sufficiently similarly on low energy coherent state inputs, one can\nbound how different the input-output relations are for any (high energy or\nhighly non-classical) input.

We run 1-D dust transport and collision models with\nDustPy and generate synthetic observations, and find that discs formed by this\nmechanism have sizes determined by the extent of their dead zones. Accounting\nfor dust porosity, and considering less fragile dust, do not change disc sizes\nsignificantly. The smooth dust morphology can be altered only when pressure\nbumps are present in the dead zone. However, when present at small radii (<=10\nau), pressure bumps cannot effectively trap dust. Dust in these bumps fragments\nand replenishes the inner discs, effectively hiding dust traps in the optically\nthick inner disc from observations. We note a striking resemblance in the\nradial intensity profile between our synthetic observations and some recent\nhigh-resolution observations of compact discs.

    "abstract": "The recent prediction and discovery of hypervelocity supernova survivors has\nprovided strong evidence that the \"dynamically driven double-degenerate\ndouble-detonation\" (D6) Type Ia supernova scenario occurs in Nature. In this\nmodel, the accretion stream from the secondary white dwarf in a double white\ndwarf binary strikes the primary white dwarf violently enough to trigger a\nhelium shell detonation, which in turn triggers a carbon/oxygen core\ndetonation. If the secondary white dwarf survives the primary's explosion, it\nwill be flung away as a hypervelocity star. While previous work has shown that\nthe hotter observed D6 stars can be broadly understood as secondaries whose\nouter layers have been heated by their primaries' explosions, the properties of\nthe cooler D6 stars have proven difficult to reproduce. In this paper, we show\nthat the cool D6 stars can be explained by the Kelvin-Helmholtz contraction of\nhelium or carbon/oxygen white dwarfs that underwent significant mass loss and\ncore heating prior to and during the explosion of their white dwarf companions.\nWe find that the current population of known D6 candidates is consistent with\n~2% of Type Ia supernovae leaving behind a hypervelocity surviving companion.\nWe also calculate the evolution of hot, low-mass oxygen/neon stars and find\nreasonable agreement with the properties of the LP 40-365 class of\nhypervelocity survivors, suggesting that these stars are the kicked remnants of\nnear-Chandrasekhar-mass oxygen/neon white dwarfs that were partially disrupted\nby oxygen deflagrations.

    "abstract": "We present the JWST discovery of a highly-extincted ($A_V\\sim52$) candidate\nbrown dwarf ($\\sim0.018$M$_\\odot$) in the outskirts of the Trapezium Cluster\nthat appears to be coincident with the end of a $\\sim 1700\\,$au long,\nremarkably uniformly wide, dark trail that broadens only slightly at the end\nopposite the point source. We examine whether a dusty trail associated with a\nhighly-extincted brown dwarf could plausibly be detected with JWST and explore\npossible origins. We show that a dusty trail associated with the brown dwarf\ncould be observable if dust within it is larger than that in the ambient\nmolecular cloud. For example, if the ambient cloud has a standard\n$\\sim0.25$$\\mu$m maximum grain size and the trail contains micron-sized grains,\nthen the trail will have a scattering opacity over an order of magnitude larger\ncompared to the surroundings in NIRCam short-wavelength filters. We use a\nsimple model to show that a change in maximum grain size can reproduce the high\n$A_V$ and the multi-filter NIRCam contrast seen between the trail and its\nsurroundings. We propose and explore two possible mechanisms that could be\nresponsible for the trail: i) a weak FUV radiation-driven wind from the\ncircum-brown dwarf disc due to the O stars in the region and ii) a\nBondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton accretion wake. The former would be the most distant\nknown case of the Trapezium stars' radiation driving winds from a disc, and the\nlatter would be the first known example of ``late'' infall from the\ninterstellar medium onto a low mass object in a high-mass star-forming region.",

    "abstract": "We explore a minimal scenario where the sole Standard-Model Higgs is\nresponsible for reheating the Universe after inflation, produces a significant\nbackground of gravitational waves and maintains the full classical stability of\nthe electroweak vacuum. As the Higgs self-coupling runs toward negative values\nat high energy scales, a non-minimal interaction with curvature during a stiff\nbackground expansion era drives the Higgs fluctuations closer to the\ninstability scale. This curvature-induced tachyonic instability leads to an\nintense production of Higgs particles, accompanied by a stochastic\ngravitational-wave background. The characteristic features of such signal can\nbe directly correlated to the inflationary scale, the non-minimal coupling\nparameter and the top quark Yukawa coupling. We distinguish between three\npossible scenarios: absolute stability with low top quark masses, potential\nvacuum instability, and absolute stability with new physics above the\ninstability scale. Our findings suggest that the detection of a peaked\nbackground of gravitational waves together with its inflationary tail has the\npotential to unveil the features of the Higgs effective potential at very high\nenergy scales while providing a minimal explanation for the reheating phase and\nthe emergence of the Standard-Model plasma in the early Universe.

In the M-dwarf subsample, two debris disks have been\ndetected, around the M3V dwarf GJ581 and the M4V dwarf FomalhautC (LP876-10).\nThis result gives a disk detection rate of 2.1^{+2.7}_{-0.7}% at the 68%\nconfidence level, significantly less than measured for earlier stellar types in\nthe DEBRIS program. However, we show that the survey of the DEBRIS M-dwarf\nsubsample is about ten times shallower than the surveys of the DEBRIS FGK\nsubsamples when studied in the physical parameter space of the disk's\nfractional dust luminosity versus blackbody radius. Furthermore, had the DEBRIS\nK-star subsample been observed at the same shallower depth in this parameter\nspace, its measured disk detection rate would have been statistically\nconsistent with the one found for the M-dwarf subsample. Hence, the incidence\nof debris disks does not appear to drop from the K subsample to the M subsample\nof the DEBRIS program, when considering disks in the same region of physical\nparameter space. An alternative explanation is that the only two bright disks\ndiscovered in the M-dwarf subsample would not, in fact, be statistically\nrepresentative of the whole population.",

Near the critical\ntemperature $T_c \\approx 90$ K, supercurrent-fluctuation-induced noise leads to\na sharp reduction of the NV $T_1$. By carefully analyzing the\ntemperature-scaling of $T_1$, we observe clear deviations from the BCS\nprediction, reflecting the importance of order parameter fluctuations and\nenabling the determination of both static and dynamical critical exponents.\nWhen a small field is applied, we detect a broad and asymmetric reduction of NV\n$T_1$ near $T_c$; the field-induced smearing of the transition unveils the\npresence of a vortex liquid phase. Finally, NV decoherence ($T_2$) noise\nspectroscopy allows us to characterize magnetic noise at even lower MHz-scale\nfrequencies and obtain evidence for complex vortex-solid fluctuations well\nbelow $T_c$.

In this work, we investigate how dipolar bosonic\ncrystals respond to correlated disorder in the form of quasiperiodic\npotentials. Using exact numerical simulations and a suite of observables -\nincluding order parameters, energy, density distributions, and two-body\ncoherence measures - we explore one-dimensional dipolar bosons in quasiperiodic\nlattices at both commensurate and incommensurate fillings. Our results reveal a\ncomplex competition between superfluid, Mott insulator, density-wave, and\ncrystalline phases, governed by the intricate balance of dipolar interactions,\nkinetic energy, and disorder strength. Crucially, we identify mechanisms that\ninfluence dipolar crystals, showing their surprising robustness even in the\npresence of strong quasiperiodic disorder. Strikingly, we challenge previous\nclaims by demonstrating that a kinetic crystal phase - expected to precede full\ncrystallization - does not emerge in the ground state. Instead, its traits\nappear only under moderate disorder, but never fully develop, giving way to a\ndirect transition from a charge density wave to a crystal state.

The\ntemporal dynamics of these modes is described by a Lindblad equation in which\nthe instantaneous Hamiltonian plays the role of the Lindblad operator, thereby\nallowing the environment to couple with the system through the energy channels\n(weak measurement protocol). We show that in the presence of such a real time\nramp, the survival probability of these modes decreases (increases) in short\n(long) time scale where the dephasing (quantum Zeno) effect dominates with the\nincreasing amplitude of the system-to-environment coupling, for both slow and\nfast ramps from a topological to a normal insulating state.

To improve the efficiency of on-device deployment, small language\nmodels (SLMs) are often adopted due to their efficient decoding latency and\nreduced energy consumption. However, these SLMs often generate inaccurate\nresponses when handling complex queries. One promising solution is\nuncertainty-based SLM routing, offloading high-stakes queries to stronger LLMs\nwhen resulting in low-confidence responses on SLM. This follows the principle\nof \"If you lack confidence, seek stronger support\" to enhance reliability.\nRelying on more powerful LLMs is yet effective but increases invocation costs.\nTherefore, striking a routing balance between efficiency and efficacy remains a\ncritical challenge. Additionally, efficiently generalizing the routing strategy\nto new datasets remains under-explored. In this paper, we conduct a\ncomprehensive investigation into benchmarking and generalization of\nuncertainty-driven routing strategies from SLMs to LLMs over 1500+ settings.\nOur findings highlight: First, uncertainty-correctness alignment in different\nuncertainty quantification (UQ) methods significantly impacts routing\nperformance. Second, uncertainty distributions depend more on both the specific\nSLM and the chosen UQ method, rather than downstream data.

    "abstract": "Despite extensive safety alignment efforts, large language models (LLMs)\nremain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks that elicit harmful behavior. While\nexisting studies predominantly focus on attack methods that require technical\nexpertise, two critical questions remain underexplored: (1) Are jailbroken\nresponses truly useful in enabling average users to carry out harmful actions?\n(2) Do safety vulnerabilities exist in more common, simple human-LLM\ninteractions? In this paper, we demonstrate that LLM responses most effectively\nfacilitate harmful actions when they are both actionable and informative--two\nattributes easily elicited in multi-step, multilingual interactions. Using this\ninsight, we propose HarmScore, a jailbreak metric that measures how effectively\nan LLM response enables harmful actions, and Speak Easy, a simple multi-step,\nmultilingual attack framework. Notably, by incorporating Speak Easy into direct\nrequest and jailbreak baselines, we see an average absolute increase of 0.319\nin Attack Success Rate and 0.426 in HarmScore in both open-source and\nproprietary LLMs across four safety benchmarks. Our work reveals a critical yet\noften overlooked vulnerability: Malicious users can easily exploit common\ninteraction patterns for harmful intentions.",

Our key insights is that disentangling information\nextrapolation from primitive decoding allows efficient transfer of structural\npatterns across training scenes. Our method: (1) learns cross-scene priors to\ngenerate intermediate virtual views to extrapolate to unobserved regions, (2)\noffers a two-stage network design separating virtual view generation from 3D\nprimitive decoding for efficient training and modular model design, and (3)\nintegrates a pre-trained foundation model for joint inference of latent\nfeatures and texture, improving scene understanding and generalization. sshELF\ncan reconstruct 360 degree scenes from six sparse input views and achieves\ncompetitive results on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Recent work on the isominwidth\nproblem on the sphere S^2 shows that the solution is the regular spherical\ntriangle when the width is at most \\pi/2 according to Bezdek and Blekherman,\nwhile Freyer and Sagmeister proved that the minimizer is the polar of a\nspherical Reuleaux triangle when the minimal width is greater than \\pi/2.\n  In this paper, the hyperbolic isominwidth problem is discussed with respect\nto the probably most natural notion of width due to Lassak in the hyperbolic\nspace H^n where strips bounded by a supporting hyperplane and a corresponding\nhypersphere are considered.

    "abstract": "Teaching robots dexterous manipulation skills, such as tool use, presents a\nsignificant challenge. Current approaches can be broadly categorized into two\nstrategies: human teleoperation (for imitation learning) and sim-to-real\nreinforcement learning. The first approach is difficult as it is hard for\nhumans to produce safe and dexterous motions on a different embodiment without\ntouch feedback. The second RL-based approach struggles with the domain gap and\ninvolves highly task-specific reward engineering on complex tasks. Our key\ninsight is that RL is effective at learning low-level motion primitives, while\nhumans excel at providing coarse motion commands for complex, long-horizon\ntasks. Therefore, the optimal solution might be a combination of both\napproaches. In this paper, we introduce DexterityGen (DexGen), which uses RL to\npretrain large-scale dexterous motion primitives, such as in-hand rotation or\ntranslation. We then leverage this learned dataset to train a dexterous\nfoundational controller. In the real world, we use human teleoperation as a\nprompt to the controller to produce highly dexterous behavior. We evaluate the\neffectiveness of DexGen in both simulation and real world, demonstrating that\nit is a general-purpose controller that can realize input dexterous\nmanipulation commands and significantly improves stability by 10-100x measured\nas duration of holding objects across diverse tasks. Notably, with DexGen we\ndemonstrate unprecedented dexterous skills including diverse object\nreorientation and dexterous tool use such as pen, syringe, and screwdriver for\nthe first time.",

We summarize\nthe conceptual basis of each method to highlight their similarities and\ndifferences.

Shot design, a critical\naspect of filmmaking, involves meticulously planning both camera movements and\nobject motions in a scene. However, enabling intuitive shot design in modern\nimage-to-video generation systems presents two main challenges: first,\neffectively capturing user intentions on the motion design, where both camera\nmovements and scene-space object motions must be specified jointly; and second,\nrepresenting motion information that can be effectively utilized by a video\ndiffusion model to synthesize the image animations. To address these\nchallenges, we introduce MotionCanvas, a method that integrates user-driven\ncontrols into image-to-video (I2V) generation models, allowing users to control\nboth object and camera motions in a scene-aware manner. By connecting insights\nfrom classical computer graphics and contemporary video generation techniques,\nwe demonstrate the ability to achieve 3D-aware motion control in I2V synthesis\nwithout requiring costly 3D-related training data. MotionCanvas enables users\nto intuitively depict scene-space motion intentions, and translates them into\nspatiotemporal motion-conditioning signals for video diffusion models.

They apply to systems described by agents transitioning\nbetween vertices along the edges of a network (at some rate in each direction).\nIt has recently been shown by the authors that, at stationarity, a hidden\nlinearity exists between currents that flow along edges: if one controls the\ncurrent of a specific \"input\" edge (by tuning transition rates along it), any\nother current is a linear-affine function of the input current [PRL 133, 047401\n(2024)]. In this paper, we extend this result to the situation where one\ncontrols the currents of several edges, and prove that other currents are in\nlinear-affine relation with the input ones. Two proofs with distinct insights\nare provided: the first relies on Kirchhoff's current law and reduces the input\nset inductively through graph analysis, while the second utilizes the resolvent\napproach via a Laplace transform in time. We obtain explicit expressions for\nthe current-to-current susceptibilities, which allow one to map current\ndependencies through the network. We also verify from our expression that\nKirchhoff's current law is recovered as a limiting case of our mutual\nlinearity. Last, we uncover that susceptibilities can be obtained from\nfluctuations when the reference system is originally at equilibrium.",

We employ multi-line, non-local thermodynamic\nequilibrium (non-LTE) inversions of the spectropolarimetric data to infer the\nstratification of the physical parameters of the atmosphere.

Given its connection to NP-hard problems and\nreal-world applications, there has been significant experimental interest in\nexploring quantum advantage for MIS. Pioneering experiments on King's Lattice\ngraphs suggested a quadratic speed-up over simulated annealing, but recent\nbenchmarks using state-of-the-art methods found no clear advantage, likely due\nto the structured nature of the tested instances. In this work, we generate\nhard instances of unit-disk graphs by leveraging complexity theory results and\nvarying key hardness parameters such as density and treewidth. For a fixed\ngraph size, we show that increasing these parameters can lead to prohibitive\nclassical runtime increases of several orders of magnitude. We then compare\nclassical and quantum approaches on small instances and find that, at this\nscale, quantum solutions are slower than classical ones for finding exact\nsolutions.

Instead, we encode the optimization problem\ninto the dynamics of a physical system and coherently simulate the time\nevolution. This allows us, in certain cases, to obtain exponentially better\nquery upper bounds relative to the best known upper bounds for gradient-based\noptimization schemes which utilize quantum computers only for the evaluation of\ngradients. Our first two algorithms can find local optima of a differentiable\nfunction $f: \\mathbb{R}^N \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ by simulating either\nclassical or quantum dynamics with friction via a time-dependent Hamiltonian.\nWe show that these methods require $O(N\\kappa^2/h_x^2\\epsilon)$ queries to a\nphase oracle to find an $\\epsilon$-approximate local optimum of a locally\nquadratic objective function, where $\\kappa$ is the condition number of the\nHessian matrix and $h_x$ is the discretization spacing. In contrast, we show\nthat gradient-based methods require $O(N(1/\\epsilon)^{\\kappa \\log(3)/4})$\nqueries. Our third algorithm can find the global optimum of $f$ by preparing a\nclassical low-temperature thermal state via simulation of the classical\nLiouvillian operator associated with the Nos\\'e Hamiltonian. We use results\nfrom the quantum thermodynamics literature to bound the thermalization time for\nthe discrete system. Additionally, we analyze barren plateau effects that\ncommonly plague quantum optimization algorithms and observe that our approach\nis vastly less sensitive to this problem than standard gradient-based\noptimization.

These resonances, which occur\npreferentially in systems formed via isolated binary evolution with strong\ntidal effects, lead to excesses in the distribution of the azimuthal angle\nbetween the projections of the component spin vectors onto the orbital plane at\n$\\phi_{12}=0,\\pm\\pi$. Previous analyses have demonstrated that this parameter\nis particularly difficult to constrain for individual binaries. In this work,\nwe conduct the first hierarchical analysis modeling the population-level\ndistribution of $\\phi_{12}$ simultaneously with the other mass and spin\nparameters for simulated binary black hole populations to determine whether\nspin-orbit resonances can be reliably constrained. While we are unlikely to\nfind definitive evidence for spin-orbit resonances with a population of the\nsize expected by the end of the ongoing LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA fourth observing run,\nwe correctly recover the various $\\phi_{12}$ distributions we simulate within\nuncertainties. We find that we can place meaningful constraints on the relative\nexcesses at $\\phi_{12}=0,\\pm\\pi$, which encodes information about mass transfer\nin the formation of the binary. We can also distinguish between fully isotropic\nspin angle distributions and those with features in the spin azimuth and tilt\ndistributions. Thus, we show that population-level measurements of the\n$\\phi_{12}$ distribution offer a reliable, novel way to probe binary formation\nchannels, dynamics, and mass transfer with gravitational-wave observations.",

    "abstract": "Solving hard optimization problems is one of the most promising application\ndomains for quantum computers due to the ubiquity of such problems in industry\nand the availability of broadly applicable quantum speedups. However, the\nability of near-term quantum computers to tackle industrial-scale optimization\nproblems is limited by their size and the overheads of quantum error\ncorrection. Quantum Random Access Optimization (QRAO) has been proposed to\nreduce the space requirements of quantum optimization. However, to date QRAO\nhas only been implemented using variational algorithms, which suffer from the\nneed to train instance-specific variational parameters, making them difficult\nto scale. We propose and benchmark a non-variational approach to QRAO based on\nthe Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz (QAOA) for the MaxCut problem. We show\nthat instance-independent ``fixed\" parameters achieve good performance,\nremoving the need for variational parameter optimization. Additionally, we\nevaluate different design choices, such as various mixers, initial states, and\nQRAO-specific implementations of the QAOA cost operator, and identify a\nstrategy that performs well in practice. Our results pave the way for the\npractical execution of QRAO on early fault-tolerant quantum computers.",

The models were used to investigate the\nemission of gravitational waves (GWs) through $f$-mode oscillations in the\ncorresponding neutron stars. We obtained the stellar structure, $f$-mode\nfrequency and tidal deformability $\\Lambda$ for our models. We report that the\n$\\Delta$ EoS is stiffer compared to the $H$ EoS. We also analyzed the velocity\nof sound in these media. The corresponding mass--radius relationships were\nobtained and compared with various observations. We studied the dependence of\n$f$-mode frequencies on the stellar mass, redshift and tidal deformability. We\nemployed the well known Cowling approximation to obtain the $f$-mode\nfrequencies for $l=2,\\,3$ and $4$ modes of oscillation. We found that the\n$f$-mode frequencies of the $H$ and $\\Delta$ EoSs were almost the same in the\nlower mass region, while we observed a substantial difference between them in\nthe high-mass region.

In this paper, we show that the\ncommon practice of individually exploiting the text or image encoders of these\npowerful multi-modal models is highly suboptimal for intra-modal tasks like\nimage-to-image retrieval. We argue that this is inherently due to the\nCLIP-style inter-modal contrastive loss that does not enforce any intra-modal\nconstraints, leading to what we call intra-modal misalignment. To demonstrate\nthis, we leverage two optimization-based modality inversion techniques that map\nrepresentations from their input modality to the complementary one without any\nneed for auxiliary data or additional trained adapters. We empirically show\nthat, in the intra-modal tasks of image-to-image and text-to-text retrieval,\napproaching these tasks inter-modally significantly improves performance with\nrespect to intra-modal baselines on more than fifteen datasets. Additionally,\nwe demonstrate that approaching a native inter-modal task (e.g. zero-shot image\nclassification) intra-modally decreases performance, further validating our\nfindings. Finally, we show that incorporating an intra-modal term in the\npre-training objective or narrowing the modality gap between the text and image\nfeature embedding spaces helps reduce the intra-modal misalignment.

    "abstract": "Machine Unlearning allows participants to remove their data from a trained\nmachine learning model in order to preserve their privacy, and security.\nHowever, the machine unlearning literature for generative models is rather\nlimited. The literature for image-to-image generative model (I2I model)\nconsiders minimizing the distance between Gaussian noise and the output of I2I\nmodel for forget samples as machine unlearning. However, we argue that the\nmachine learning model performs fairly well on unseen data i.e., a retrained\nmodel will be able to catch generic patterns in the data and hence will not\ngenerate an output which is equivalent to Gaussian noise. In this paper, we\nconsider that the model after unlearning should treat forget samples as\nout-of-distribution (OOD) data, i.e., the unlearned model should no longer\nrecognize or encode the specific patterns found in the forget samples. To\nachieve this, we propose a framework which decouples the model parameters with\ngradient ascent, ensuring that forget samples are OOD for unlearned model with\ntheoretical guarantee. We also provide $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-unlearning\nguarantee for model updates with gradient ascent. The unlearned model is\nfurther fine-tuned on the remaining samples to maintain its performance. We\nalso propose an attack model to ensure that the unlearned model has effectively\nremoved the influence of forget samples.

This framework naturally accounts for uncertainty in\nboth world model and preference model, allowing for decision-making that is\nepistemically and axiologically humble, parsimonious, and future-proof. We\ndemonstrate this novel approach in a simplified autonomous vehicle environment\nwith multi-agent vehicles whose driving policies are mediated by gatekeepers\nthat evaluate, in an online fashion, the risk to the collective safety in their\nneighborhood, and intervene through each vehicle's policy when appropriate. We\nshow that the introduction of gatekeepers in an AV fleet, even at low\npenetration, can generate significant positive externalities in terms of\nincreased system safety.",

    "abstract": "Robust training methods typically defend against specific attack types, such\nas Lp attacks with fixed budgets, and rarely account for the fact that\ndefenders may encounter new attacks over time. A natural solution is to adapt\nthe defended model to new adversaries as they arise via fine-tuning, a method\nwhich we call continual robust training (CRT). However, when implemented\nnaively, fine-tuning on new attacks degrades robustness on previous attacks.\nThis raises the question: how can we improve the initial training and\nfine-tuning of the model to simultaneously achieve robustness against previous\nand new attacks? We present theoretical results which show that the gap in a\nmodel's robustness against different attacks is bounded by how far each attack\nperturbs a sample in the model's logit space, suggesting that regularizing with\nrespect to this logit space distance can help maintain robustness against\nprevious attacks. Extensive experiments on 3 datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and\nImageNette) and over 100 attack combinations demonstrate that the proposed\nregularization improves robust accuracy with little overhead in training time.\nOur findings and open-source code lay the groundwork for the deployment of\nmodels robust to evolving attacks.",

Here, we present a {\\it\nmulti-fidelity} emulation of large-scale 21~cm lightcone images from the epoch\nof reionization, which is realized by applying the {\\it few-shot transfer\nlearning} to training generative adversarial networks (GAN) from small-scale to\nlarge-scale simulations. Specifically, a GAN emulator is first trained with a\nhuge number of small-scale simulations, and then transfer-learned with only a\nlimited number of large-scale simulations, to emulate large-scale 21~cm\nlightcone images. We test the precision of our transfer-learned GAN emulator in\nterms of representative statistics including global 21~cm brightness\ntemperature history, 2D power spectrum, and scattering transform coefficients.\nWe demonstrate that the lightcone images generated by the transfer-learned GAN\nemulator can reach the percentage level precision in most cases on small\nscales, and the error on large scales only increases mildly to the level of a\nfew tens of per cent. Nevertheless, our multi-fidelity emulation technique\nsaves a significant portion of computational resources that are mostly consumed\nfor generating training samples for GAN. On estimate, the computational\nresource by training GAN completely with large-scale simulations would be one\nto two orders of magnitude larger than using our multi-fidelity technique.

These are found in\ncontexts where: either a) one only has partial, discrete observations of the\nunderlying continuous stochastic process, or b) the original system is too\ncomplex to analyze, so one partitions the continuous state-space of the\noriginal system to construct a handleable, finite-state model thereof.

    "abstract": "Flight delays due to holding maneuvers are a critical and costly phenomenon\nin aviation, driven by the need to manage air traffic congestion and ensure\nsafety. Holding maneuvers occur when aircraft are instructed to circle in\ndesignated airspace, often due to factors such as airport congestion, adverse\nweather, or air traffic control restrictions. This study models the prediction\nof flight delays due to holding maneuvers as a graph problem, leveraging\nadvanced Graph Machine Learning (Graph ML) techniques to capture complex\ninterdependencies in air traffic networks. Holding maneuvers, while crucial for\nsafety, cause increased fuel usage, emissions, and passenger dissatisfaction,\nmaking accurate prediction essential for operational efficiency. Traditional\nmachine learning models, typically using tabular data, often overlook\nspatial-temporal relations within air traffic data. To address this, we model\nthe problem of predicting holding as edge feature prediction in a directed\n(multi)graph where we apply both CatBoost, enriched with graph features\ncapturing network centrality and connectivity, and Graph Attention Networks\n(GATs), which excel in relational data contexts. Our results indicate that\nCatBoost outperforms GAT in this imbalanced dataset, effectively predicting\nholding events and offering interpretability through graph-based feature\nimportance. Additionally, we discuss the model's potential operational impact\nthrough a web-based tool that allows users to simulate real-time delay\npredictions. This research underscores the viability of graph-based approaches\nfor predictive analysis in aviation, with implications for enhancing fuel\nefficiency, reducing delays, and improving passenger experience.",

It enables models to\nachieve performance comparable to those trained on the raw full dataset and has\nbecome a widely adopted method for data sharing. However, security concerns in\nDD remain underexplored. Existing studies typically assume that malicious\nbehavior originates from dataset owners during the initial distillation\nprocess, where backdoors are injected into raw datasets. In contrast, this work\nis the first to address a more realistic and concerning threat: attackers may\nintercept the dataset distribution process, inject backdoors into the distilled\ndatasets, and redistribute them to users. While distilled datasets were\npreviously considered resistant to backdoor attacks, we demonstrate that they\nremain vulnerable to such attacks. Furthermore, we show that attackers do not\neven require access to any raw data to inject the backdoors successfully.\nSpecifically, our approach reconstructs conceptual archetypes for each class\nfrom the model trained on the distilled dataset. Backdoors are then injected\ninto these archetypes to update the distilled dataset. Moreover, we ensure the\nupdated dataset not only retains the backdoor but also preserves the original\noptimization trajectory, thus maintaining the knowledge of the raw dataset. To\nachieve this, a hybrid loss is designed to integrate backdoor information along\nthe benign optimization trajectory, ensuring that previously learned\ninformation is not forgotten. Extensive experiments demonstrate that distilled\ndatasets are highly vulnerable to backdoor attacks, with risks pervasive across\nvarious raw datasets, distillation methods, and downstream training strategies.\nMoreover, our attack method is efficient, capable of synthesizing a malicious\ndistilled dataset in under one minute in certain cases.",

Moreover, the radiative component of heat\nexchange-dominant in hot and dry climates-is typically lumped into a single\nartificial metric, the mean radiant temperature, rather than being resolved\ninto its shortwave and longwave spectral components. The shortwave irradiation\ndistribution on the human body is often highly anisotropic, causing localized\nthermal discomfort in outdoor environments. However, no existing methods\neffectively quantify shortwave and longwave irradiation distributions on the\nhuman body. To address this gap, we developed two methods to quantify these\nprocesses. The first approach uses an outdoor thermal manikin with a\nwhite-coated side, enabling the separation of spectral components by\nsubtracting measurements from symmetrically corresponding surface zones of tan\ncolor. The second hybrid approach converts radiometer measurements in six\ndirections into boundary conditions for computational thermal manikin\nsimulations. We evaluated irradiation distributions for various body parts\nusing both methods during outdoor measurements across sunny, partially shaded,\nand fully shaded sites under warm to extremely hot conditions. In most cases,\nthe two methods produced closely aligned results, with divergences highlighting\ntheir respective strengths and limitations. Additionally, we used the manikin\nto quantify irradiation attenuation provided by five long-sleeve shirts with\ncolors ranging from white to black. These advanced methods can be integrated\nwith airflow and thermoregulatory modeling to optimize outdoor built\nenvironments for enhanced human thermal comfort.",

Using the\nintercept in the SN magnitude-distance relation as a diagnostic for\nsystematics, we find not only large dispersions but also a large discrepancy in\nthe low-$z$ SN sample when compared to the high-$z$ DES-SN sample within the\nsingle DESY5 compilation, in contrast to the uniform behavior found in the\nPantheonPlus data. Correcting for this low-$z$ systematics with or without\nincluding the cosmic microwave background data can largely reduce the\npreference for dynamical DE to be less than $2\\sigma$.

Reviewing endoscopy videos often involves frequent\nadjustments and reorientations to piece together a complete view, which can be\nboth time-consuming and prone to errors. Image stitching techniques address\nthis issue by providing a continuous and complete visualization of the examined\narea. However, endoscopic images, particularly those of the esophagus, present\nunique challenges. The smooth surface, lack of distinct feature points, and\nnon-horizontal orientation complicate the stitching process, rendering\ntraditional feature-based methods often ineffective for these types of images.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel preprocessing pipeline designed to enhance\nendoscopic image stitching through advanced computational techniques. Our\napproach converts endoscopic video data into continuous 2D images by following\nfour key steps: (1) keyframe selection, (2) image rotation adjustment to\ncorrect distortions, (3) surface unwrapping using polar coordinate\ntransformation to generate a flat image, and (4) feature point matching\nenhanced by Adaptive Histogram Equalization for improved feature detection. We\nevaluate stitching quality through the assessment of valid feature point match\npairs.

While 2050 targets suggest a transition endpoint,\nmaintaining these systems beyond mid-century requires continuous renewal,\nmarking a fundamental yet often overlooked shift in industrial dynamics. This\nstudy examines the transition from initial deployment to long-term renewal,\nusing a two-phase growth model: an exponential expansion followed by capacity\nstabilization. By integrating this pattern with a Weibull distribution of PV\npanel and wind turbine lifespans, we estimate the annual production required\nfor both expansion and maintenance. Our findings highlight two key factors\ninfluencing production dynamics: deployment speed and lifespan. When deployment\noccurs faster than the average lifespan, production overshoots and exhibits\ndamped oscillations due to successive installation and replacement cycles. In\ncontrast, gradual deployment leads to a smooth increase before stabilizing at\nthe renewal rate. Given current scenarios, the PV industry is likely to\nexperience significant oscillations - ranging from 15 % to 60 % of global\nproduction - while wind power follows a monotonic growth trajectory. These\noscillations, driven by ambitious energy targets, may result in cycles of\noverproduction and underproduction, affecting industrial stability. Beyond\nsolar and wind, this study underscores a broader challenge in the energy\ntransition: shifting from infrastructure expansion to long-term maintenance.\nAddressing this phase is crucial for ensuring the resilience and sustainability\nof renewable energy systems beyond 2050.",

    "abstract": "Jailbreak attacks against large language models (LLMs) aim to induce harmful\nbehaviors in LLMs through carefully crafted adversarial prompts. To mitigate\nattacks, one way is to perform adversarial training (AT)-based alignment, i.e.,\ntraining LLMs on some of the most adversarial prompts to help them learn how to\nbehave safely under attacks. During AT, the length of adversarial prompts plays\na critical role in the robustness of aligned LLMs. While long-length\nadversarial prompts during AT might lead to strong LLM robustness, their\nsynthesis however is very resource-consuming, which may limit the application\nof LLM AT. This paper focuses on adversarial suffix jailbreak attacks and\nunveils that to defend against a jailbreak attack with an adversarial suffix of\nlength $\\Theta(M)$, it is enough to align LLMs on prompts with adversarial\nsuffixes of length $\\Theta(\\sqrt{M})$. Theoretically, we analyze the\nadversarial in-context learning of linear transformers on linear regression\ntasks and prove a robust generalization bound for trained transformers. The\nbound depends on the term $\\Theta(\\sqrt{M_{\\text{test}}}/M_{\\text{train}})$,\nwhere $M_{\\text{train}}$ and $M_{\\text{test}}$ are the numbers of adversarially\nperturbed in-context samples during training and testing. Empirically, we\nconduct AT on popular open-source LLMs and evaluate their robustness against\njailbreak attacks of different adversarial suffix lengths. Results confirm a\npositive correlation between the attack success rate and the ratio of the\nsquare root of the adversarial suffix length during jailbreaking to the length\nduring AT. Our findings show that it is practical to defend against\n``long-length'' jailbreak attacks via efficient ``short-length'' AT. The code\nis available at https://github.com/fshp971/adv-icl.",

Typically,\ninstructions are paired with multiple responses sampled from other LLMs, which\nare often out of the distribution of the target model to be fine-tuned. This,\nat scale, can lead to diminishing returns and even hurt the models' performance\nand robustness. We propose **GRAPE**, a novel SFT framework that accounts for\nthe unique characteristics of the target model. For each instruction, it\ngathers responses from various LLMs and selects the one with the highest\nprobability measured by the target model, indicating that it aligns most\nclosely with the target model's pretrained distribution; it then proceeds with\nstandard SFT training.\n  We first evaluate GRAPE with a controlled experiment, where we sample various\nsolutions for each question in UltraInteract from multiple models and fine-tune\ncommonly used LMs like LLaMA3.1-8B, Mistral-7B, and Qwen2.5-7B on\nGRAPE-selected data. GRAPE significantly outperforms strong baselines,\nincluding distilling from the strongest model with an absolute gain of up to\n13.8%, averaged across benchmarks, and training on 3x more data with a maximum\nperformance improvement of 17.3%. GRAPE's strong performance generalizes to\nrealistic settings. We experiment with the post-training data used for Tulu3\nand Olmo-2. GRAPE outperforms strong baselines trained on 4.5 times more data\nby 6.1% and a state-of-the-art data selection approach by 3% on average\nperformance. Remarkably, using 1/3 of the data and half the number of epochs,\nGRAPE enables LLaMA3.1-8B to surpass the performance of Tulu3-SFT by 3.5%.",

Surprisingly, some of these methods even downgrade the grounding ability\nof MLLMs that were never trained with such pixel-level supervision.

Our results reveal branching fractions\nranging from $10^{-7}$ to $10^{-5}$, values that are well within the measurable\nrange of current experiments. A striking contrast emerges between penguin- and\ntree-dominated decays: while penguin-dominated processes yield larger branching\nfractions, tree-dominated decays exhibit significantly enhanced direct $CP$\nasymmetries. In particular, the decays $B_s \\to f_0(1370) \\eta$ and $B_s \\to\na_0(1450) K$ demonstrate marked sensitivity to the choice of scalar meson\nscenario, offering critical constraints for identifying the optimal model once\nexperimental data are available.

However, architecture patterns may not be detectable by\nanalyzing source code artifacts, requiring the analysis of other types of\nartifacts. Moreover, many existing pattern detection instance approaches are\ncomplex to extend. This article presents our ongoing PhD research, early\nexperiments, and a prototype for a tool we call MicroPAD for automating the\ndetection of microservice pattern instances. The prototype uses Large Language\nModels (LLMs) to analyze Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) artifacts to aid\ndetection, aiming to keep costs low and maximize the scope of detectable\npatterns. Early experiments ran the prototype thrice in 22 GitHub projects. We\nverified that 83\\% of the patterns that the prototype identified were in the\nproject. The costs of detecting the pattern instances were minimal. These\nresults indicate that the approach is likely viable and, by lowering the entry\nbarrier to automating pattern instance detection, could help democratize\ndeveloper access to this category of architecture knowledge.

However, this\nflexibility often introduces code quality issues, with prior studies showing\nthat approximately 76% of public notebooks are non-executable, raising\nsignificant concerns about reusability. We argue that the traditional notion of\nexecutability - requiring a notebook to run fully and without error - is overly\nrigid, misclassifying many notebooks and overestimating their\nnon-executability. This paper investigates pathological executability issues in\npublic notebooks under varying notions and degrees of executability. Even\npartially improving executability can improve code comprehension and offer a\npathway for dynamic analyses. With this insight, we first categorize notebooks\ninto potentially restorable and pathological non-executable notebooks and then\nmeasure how removing misconfiguration and superficial execution issues in\nnotebooks can improve their executability (i.e., additional cells executed\nwithout error). In a dataset of 42,546 popular public notebooks containing\n34,659 non-executable notebooks, only 21.3% are truly pathologically\nnon-executable. For restorable notebooks, LLM-based methods fully restore 5.4%\nof previously non-executable notebooks. Among the partially restored, the\nexecutability of notebooks improves by 42.7% and 28% by installing the correct\nmodules and generating synthetic data. These findings challenge prior\nassumptions, suggesting that notebooks have higher executability than\npreviously reported, many of which offer valuable partial execution, and that\ntheir executability should be evaluated within the interactive notebook\nparadigm rather than through traditional software executability standards.",

Its definition is a direct generalization of the\nbasis-dependent $\\ell_1$-norm of coherence, and it offers a more accurate\ndescription because we can use a frame containing several orthogonal bases.

To bridge this gap, we provide\nMRAMG-Bench, a meticulously curated, human-annotated benchmark comprising 4,346\ndocuments, 14,190 images, and 4,800 QA pairs, distributed across six distinct\ndatasets and spanning three domains: Web, Academia, and Lifestyle. The datasets\nincorporate diverse difficulty levels and complex multi-image scenarios,\nproviding a robust foundation for evaluating the MRAMG task.

In directed acyclic\ngraphs (DAGs), fCMs are well-understood: a unique probability distribution on\nthe random variables can be easily specified, and a crucial graph-separation\nresult called the d-separation theorem allows one to characterize conditional\nindependences between the variables. However, fCMs on cyclic graphs pose\nchallenges due to the absence of a systematic way to assign a unique\nprobability distribution to the fCM's variables, the failure of the\nd-separation theorem, and lack of a generalization of this theorem that is\napplicable to all consistent cyclic fCMs. In this work, we develop a causal\nmodeling framework applicable to all cyclic fCMs involving finite-cardinality\nvariables, except inconsistent ones admitting no solutions. Our probability\nrule assigns a unique distribution even to non-uniquely solvable cyclic fCMs\nand reduces to the known rule for uniquely solvable fCMs. We identify a class\nof fCMs, called averagely uniquely solvable, that we show to be the largest\nclass where the probabilities admit a Markov factorization. Furthermore, we\nintroduce a new graph-separation property, p-separation, and prove this to be\nsound and complete for all consistent finite-cardinality cyclic fCMs while\nrecovering the d-separation theorem for DAGs.

However, an eccentric orbit results in temporally\ndependent irradiation and a non-permanent dayside, as the planet-star distance\ncan change drastically during its orbit. In this paper, we present 3D\natmospheric models of TOI-150b, an eccentric (e=0.26), Jupiter-mass 1.75 M_Jup\nplanet whose equilibrium temperature varies from 1300K to 1700K.

The strength and magnitude of these\neffects scale with the chosen global magnetic field strength.

Load forecasting performance can be improved by\nlearning the similarities among multiple entities (e.g., regions, buildings).\nTechniques based on multi-task learning obtain predictions by leveraging\nconsumption patterns from the historical load demand of multiple entities and\ntheir relationships. However, existing techniques cannot effectively assess\ninherent uncertainties in load demand or account for dynamic changes in\nconsumption patterns. This paper proposes a multi-task learning technique for\nonline and probabilistic load forecasting. This technique provides accurate\nprobabilistic predictions for the loads of multiple entities by leveraging\ntheir dynamic similarities. The method's performance is evaluated using\ndatasets that register the load demand of multiple entities and contain diverse\nand dynamic consumption patterns.

Investigating the internal absorption is crucial for\nunraveling the complex structure of FSRQs and constraining the poorly known\nlocation of the gamma-ray emission region.

However, current methods have three unsolved\nissues: overlooking layer-wise sensitivity to KV cache quantization, high\noverhead of online fine-grained decision-making, and low flexibility to\ndifferent LLMs and constraints. Therefore, we theoretically analyze the\ninherent correlation of layer-wise transformer attention patterns to KV cache\nquantization errors and study why key cache is generally more important than\nvalue cache for quantization error reduction.

However, LLMs\ninherently reflect biases present in their training data, leading to a critical\nchallenge: when these models generate synthetic data for training, they may\npropagate and amplify their inherent biases that can significantly impact model\nfairness and robustness on downstream tasks--a phenomenon we term bias\ninheritance. This work presents the first systematic investigation in\nunderstanding, analyzing, and mitigating bias inheritance. We study this\nproblem by fine-tuning LLMs with a combined dataset consisting of original and\nLLM-augmented data, where bias ratio represents the proportion of augmented\ndata. Through systematic experiments across 10 classification and generation\ntasks, we analyze how 6 different types of biases manifest at varying bias\nratios. Our results reveal that bias inheritance has nuanced effects on\ndownstream tasks, influencing both classification tasks and generation tasks\ndifferently. Then, our analysis identifies three key misalignment factors:\nmisalignment of values, group data, and data distributions. Based on these\ninsights, we propose three mitigation strategies: token-based, mask-based, and\nloss-based approaches. Experiments demonstrate that these strategies also work\ndifferently on various tasks and bias, indicating the substantial challenges to\nfully mitigate bias inheritance.

When implementing a gate that\nrequires additional connectivity beyond the native connectivity, the qubit\nstate must be moved to a nearby connected qubit to execute the desired gate\nlocally. This is typically achieved using a series of SWAP gates creating a\nSWAP path. However, routing methods relying on SWAP gates often lead to\nincreased circuit depth and gate count, motivating the need for alternative\napproaches. This work explores the potential of teleported gates to improve\nqubit routing efficiency, focusing on implementation within specific hardware\ntopologies and benchmark quantum algorithms. We propose a routing method that\nis assisted by gate teleportation. It establishes additional connectivity using\ngate teleportation paths through available unused qubits, termed auxiliary\nqubits, within the topology. To optimize this approach, we have developed an\nalgorithm to identify the best gate teleportation connections, considering\ntheir potential to reduce the depth of the circuit and address possible errors\nthat may arise from the teleportation paths. Finally, we demonstrate depth\nreduction with gate teleportation-assisted routing in various benchmark\nalgorithms, including case studies on the compilation of the Deutsch-Jozsa\nalgorithm and the Quantum Approximation Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) for\nheavy-hexagon topology used in IBM 127-qubit Eagle r3 processors.

One key\nissue affecting this reliability is order sensitivity, wherein slight\nvariations in the input arrangement can lead to inconsistent or biased outputs.\nAlthough recent advances have reduced this sensitivity, the problem remains\nunresolved. This paper investigates the extent of order sensitivity in LLMs\nwhose internal components are hidden from users (such as closed-source models\nor those accessed via API calls). We conduct experiments across multiple tasks,\nincluding paraphrasing, relevance judgment, and multiple-choice questions. Our\nresults show that input order significantly affects performance across tasks,\nwith shuffled inputs leading to measurable declines in output accuracy.\nFew-shot prompting demonstrates mixed effectiveness and offers partial\nmitigation; however, fails to fully resolve the problem.

To overcome these limitations, available domain expert\nknowledge in the form of parametrised mechanistic dynamical models can be used\nwhenever it is available and time series observations may be represented as an\nelement from a given class of parametrised dynamical models. This makes the\nlearning process interpretable and allows the modeller to deal with sparsely\nand irregularly sampled data in a natural way. However, the internal processes\nof a dynamical model are often only partially observed. This can lead to\nambiguity regarding which particular model realization best explains a given\ntime series observation. This problem is well-known in the literature, and a\ndynamical model with this issue is referred to as structurally unidentifiable.\nTraining a classifier that incorporates knowledge about a structurally\nunidentifiable dynamical model can negatively influence classification\nperformance. To address this issue, we employ structural identifiability\nanalysis to explicitly relate parameter configurations that are associated with\nidentical system outputs. Using the derived relations in classifier training,\nwe demonstrate that this method significantly improves the classifier's ability\nto generalize to unseen data on a number of example models from the biomedical\ndomain.

This work\nmakes the following contributions: First, we explore the scaling of train-time\nand inference-time compute for speech synthesis.

Our experiments reveal that scaling train-time\ncompute for Llasa consistently improves the naturalness of synthesized speech\nand enables the generation of more complex and accurate prosody patterns.\nFurthermore, from the perspective of scaling inference-time compute, we employ\nspeech understanding models as verifiers during the search, finding that\nscaling inference-time compute shifts the sampling modes toward the preferences\nof specific verifiers, thereby improving emotional expressiveness, timbre\nconsistency, and content accuracy.

In\ndimension two, the boundary of reasonable systems is one dimensional, so\ninformation should not be able to propagate there. This led to the conjecture\nthat in 2D, weak mixing implies strong mixing. The question was investigated in\nseveral previous works, and proof of this conjecture is available in the case\nof finite range Gibbsian specifications, and in the case of nearest-neighbour\nFK percolation (under some restrictions).

To address this, we design adaptive\nobjectives for individual points based on their ambiguity levels, aiming to\nensure the correctness of low-ambiguity points while allowing mistakes for\nhigh-ambiguity points. Specifically, we first estimate ambiguities based on\nposition embeddings. Then, we develop a margin generator to shift decision\nboundaries for contrastive feature embeddings, so margins are narrowed due to\nincreasing ambiguities with even negative margins for extremely high-ambiguity\npoints.

However, malicious servers could deliberately\nmanipulate the models to reconstruct clients' data from shared gradients,\nposing significant privacy risks. Although such active gradient leakage attacks\n(AGLAs) have been widely studied, they suffer from two severe limitations: (i)\ncoverage: no existing AGLAs can reconstruct all samples in a batch from the\nshared gradients; (ii) stealthiness: no existing AGLAs can evade principled\nchecks of clients. In this paper, we address these limitations with two core\ncontributions. First, we introduce a new theoretical analysis approach, which\nuniformly models AGLAs as backdoor poisoning. This analysis approach reveals\nthat the core principle of AGLAs is to bias the gradient space to prioritize\nthe reconstruction of a small subset of samples while sacrificing the majority,\nwhich theoretically explains the above limitations of existing AGLAs. Second,\nwe propose Enhanced Gradient Global Vulnerability (EGGV), the first AGLA that\nachieves complete attack coverage while evading client-side detection. In\nparticular, EGGV employs a gradient projector and a jointly optimized\ndiscriminator to assess gradient vulnerability, steering the gradient space\ntoward the point most prone to data leakage. Extensive experiments show that\nEGGV achieves complete attack coverage and surpasses state-of-the-art (SOTA)\nwith at least a 43% increase in reconstruction quality (PSNR) and a 45%\nimprovement in stealthiness (D-SNR).",

Upon\ncrossing the Widom line, new mechanisms of flow instability emerge, feasibly\nleading to changes in dominating modes that yield turbulence. The present work\ninvestigates the sensitivity of three-dimensional boundary-layer modal\ninstability to these intrinsic uncertainties in fluid properties. The\nuncertainty, regardless of its source and the fluid regimes, gives rise to\ndistortions of all profiles that constitute the inputs of the stability\noperator. The effect of these distortions on flow stability is measured by\nsensitivity coefficients, which are formulated with the adjoint operator and\nvalidated against linear modal stability analysis. The results are presented\nfor carbon dioxide at a representative supercritical pressure of about 80 bar.\nThe sensitivity to different inputs of the stability operator across various\nthermodynamic regimes show an immense range of sensitivity amplitude. A\nbalancing relationship between the density gradient and its perturbation leads\nto a quadratic effect across the Widom line, provoking significant sensitivity\nto distortions of the second derivative of the pressure with respect to the\ndensity, $\\partial^2 p/\\partial \\rho^2$. From an application-oriented point of\nview, one important question is whether the correct baseflow profiles can be\nmeaningfully analyzed by the simplified ideal-fluid model...",

In this paper we consider two model Hamiltonians with a continuous\nparameter that is partly unknown. We assess robust controllability against this\nparameter uncertainty using existing theoretical frameworks and take a\nnumerical route by discretizing the unknown parameter in the cases where we\ncannot predict controllability.

Although\nexisting research has optimized designs for phase and mixer operators to\nimprove performance, challenges remain, particularly concerning the excessive\nuse of two-qubit gates in the construction of phase operators. To address these\nissues, we introduce a Dynamic Adaptive Phase Operator (DAPO) algorithm, which\ndynamically constructs phase operators based on the output of previous layers\nand neighborhood search approach, optimizing the problem Hamiltonian more\nefficiently.

Experimental results on MaxCut and NAE3SAT\nproblems show that DAPO achieves higher approximation ratios and significantly\nreduces two-qubit RZZ gates, especially in dense graphs.

In this\npaper, we propose the first-ever interpolation-based progressive lossy\ncompression solution that has both high reduction ratios and low operation\ncosts. The interpolation-based algorithm has been verified as one of the best\nfor scientific data reduction, but previously no effort exists to make it\nsupport progressive retrieval. Our contributions are three-fold: (1) We\nthoroughly analyze the error characteristics of the interpolation algorithm and\npropose our solution IPComp with multi-level bitplane and predictive coding.\n(2) We derive optimized strategies toward minimum data retrieval under\ndifferent fidelity levels indicated by users through error bounds and bitrates.\n(3) We evaluate the proposed solution using six real-world datasets from four\ndiverse domains. Experimental results demonstrate our solution archives up to\n$487\\%$ higher compression ratios and $698\\%$ faster speed than other\nstate-of-the-art progressive compressors, and reduces the data volume for\nretrieval by up to $83\\%$ compared to baselines under the same error bound, and\nreduces the error by up to $99\\%$ under the same bitrate.",

    "abstract": "Scaling large language models (LLMs) improves performance but dramatically\nincreases inference costs. The feed-forward network (FFN), consuming\napproximately 70\\% of inference compute, represents a critical bottleneck,\nparticularly in large batch size scenarios. While mixture-of-experts (MoE)\narchitectures leverage activation sparsity for efficiency, converting existing\ndense models to MoEs traditionally requires resource-intensive continual\npre-training. We present CMoE, a framework that rapidly transforms dense LLMs\ninto MoEs without training. The key innovation lies in analyzing FFN neuron\nactivations to partition them into shared (always active) and routed experts.\nRouted neurons are clustered using a balanced assignment algorithm, and a\ndifferentiable router is constructed analytically from activation statistics,\nenabling immediate deployment or optional lightweight fine-tuning. Experiments\ndemonstrate that, with activation ratio of 75\\%, it achieves remarkable\nresults, delivering lossless precision in terms of perplexity while still\nmaintaining a 5\\% acceleration. Further experiments reveal that a CMoE\nconfiguration activating just 25\\% of parameters reduces end-to-end latency by\n1.5x while preserving usable perplexity without additional training. Moreover,\na brief LoRA fine-tuning process (requiring only 1 hour and 2,000 samples)\nsuccessfully recovers over 76\\% of the dense model's downstream accuracy. By\neffectively balancing performance and efficiency, CMoE offers a viable path\nforward for deploying LLMs in real-world scenarios where computational\nresources are limited.

In this study, we aim to explore\nthe relationship between the morphology, in particular the asymmetries of\ngalaxies, and their distances to the cluster centre. For galaxies in the Fornax\nDeep Survey, we quantified the morphologies of dwarf galaxies using Asymmetry\n(A) and Smoothness (S). Unlike previous work, we use isophotal CAS-parameters,\nwhich are sensitive to the outer parts of galaxies. We constructed the A-r and\nS-r diagrams to investigate the relationship between morphology and distance.\nAdditionally, we examined the effects of asymmetry on magnitude and colour.\nFurthermore, to better understand the assembly history of the galaxy cluster,\nwe performed a phase-space analysis for Fornax dwarf galaxies. We find that\ndwarf galaxies in the outer regions of the Fornax cluster have higher values of\nasymmetry compared to other dwarfs in the cluster, indicating a greater degree\nof morphological disturbances within dwarf galaxies in these regions. We also\nfind that galaxies in the very inner regions are more asymmetric than those\nfurther out. The A-magnitude relation reveals a trend where asymmetry increases\nas galaxies become fainter, and the A-colour relation shows that galaxies with\nbluer colours tend to exhibit higher asymmetry. We do not find any correlations\nwith smoothness, except that smoothness strongly decreases with stellar mass.\nWe propose that the higher asymmetry of dwarfs in the outer regions is most\nlikely caused by ram pressure stripping. In the very inner parts, the\nasymmetries most likely are caused by tidal effects. In addition, our\nphase-space diagram suggests that galaxies near pericentre in the Fornax\ncluster exhibit significantly higher asymmetry, indicating that morphological\ndisturbances happened during their first pericentric passage.",

    "abstract": "Symbiotic stars serve as exceptional laboratories for investigating mass\ntransfer processes in binary systems. However, the dominant mechanism of mass\ntransfer from the red giant donor to the compact accretor - typically a white\ndwarf or, in rare cases, a neutron star - remains unclear. It is uncertain\nwhether it is driven primarily by the stellar wind, Roche-lobe overflow, or a\ncombination of the two. While radii inferred from rotational velocities or\nspectral types suggest smaller Roche-lobe filling factors, the presence of\nellipsoidal variability, presumably caused by tidally deformed giants in many\nsymbiotic systems, indicates the opposite. Interferometric observations of\nsymbiotic giants, combined with distance measurements provided by the Gaia\nmission, offer a promising avenue to resolve this discrepancy. In this first\npaper of the series, we (re)analyze VLTI/PIONIER observations of six symbiotic\nstars: AG Peg, FG Ser, ER Del, V1261 Ori, RW Hya, and V399 Pav. With the\nexception of the uncertain case of V399 Pav, we find that the giants in these\nsystems remain well within their canonical Roche lobes, even in V1261 Ori and\nRW Hya, where ellipsoidal variability is observed. All six stars appear to be\nrather luminous and likely located on the asymptotic giant branch, although the\npossibility of some of them being at the tip of the first red giant branch\ncannot be ruled out.",

    "abstract": "Cognition, information processing in form of inference, communication, and\nmemorization, is the central activity of any intelligence. Its physical\nrealization in a brain, computer, or in any other intelligent system requires\nresources like time, energy, memory, bandwidth, money, and others. Due to\nlimited resources, many real world intelligent systems perform only imperfect\ncognition. To understand the trade-off between accuracy and resource\ninvestments in existing systems, e.g. in biology, as well as for the\nresource-aware optimal design of information processing systems, like computer\nalgorithms and artificial neural networks, a quantification of information\nobtained in an imperfect cognitive operation is desirable. To this end, we\npropose the concept of the achieved information gain (AIG) of a belief update,\nwhich is given by the amount of information obtained by updating from the\ninitial state of knowledge to the ideal state, minus the amount that a change\nfrom the imperfect to the ideal state would yield. AIG has many desirable\nproperties for quantifying imperfect cognition. The ratio of achieved to\nideally obtainable information measures cognitive fidelity and that of AIG to\nthe necessary cognitive effort measures cognitive efficiency. We provide an\naxiomatic derivation of AIG, relate it to other information measures,\nillustrate its application to common scenarios of posterior inaccuracies, and\ndiscuss the implication of cognitive efficiency for sustainable resource\nallocation in computational inference.",

AT 2018dyk has sparked a debate in the literature around\nits classification as either a bona-fide TDE or as an active galactic nucleus\n(AGN) turn-on state change. A new follow-up spectrum taken with the Dark Energy\nSpectroscopic Instrument, in combination with host-galaxy analysis using\narchival SDSS-MaNGA data, supports the identification of AT 2018dyk as a TDE.\nSpecifically, we classify this object as a TDE that occurred within a gas-rich\nenvironment, which was responsible for both its mid-infrared (MIR) outburst and\ndevelopment of Fe coronal emission lines. Comparison with the known sample of\nTDE-linked extreme coronal line emitters (TDE-ECLEs) and other TDEs displaying\ncoronal emission lines (CrL-TDEs) reveals similar characteristics and shared\nproperties.

    "abstract": "3D and 2D gaze estimation share the fundamental objective of capturing eye\nmovements but are traditionally treated as two distinct research domains. In\nthis paper, we introduce a novel cross-task few-shot 2D gaze estimation\napproach, aiming to adapt a pre-trained 3D gaze estimation network for 2D gaze\nprediction on unseen devices using only a few training images. This task is\nhighly challenging due to the domain gap between 3D and 2D gaze, unknown screen\nposes, and limited training data. To address these challenges, we propose a\nnovel framework that bridges the gap between 3D and 2D gaze. Our framework\ncontains a physics-based differentiable projection module with learnable\nparameters to model screen poses and project 3D gaze into 2D gaze. The\nframework is fully differentiable and can integrate into existing 3D gaze\nnetworks without modifying their original architecture. Additionally, we\nintroduce a dynamic pseudo-labelling strategy for flipped images, which is\nparticularly challenging for 2D labels due to unknown screen poses. To overcome\nthis, we reverse the projection process by converting 2D labels to 3D space,\nwhere flipping is performed. Notably, this 3D space is not aligned with the\ncamera coordinate system, so we learn a dynamic transformation matrix to\ncompensate for this misalignment. We evaluate our method on MPIIGaze, EVE, and\nGazeCapture datasets, collected respectively on laptops, desktop computers, and\nmobile devices.

    "abstract": "Context: Code refactoring is widely recognized as an essential software\nengineering practice that improves the understandability and maintainability of\nsource code. Several studies attempted to detect refactoring activities through\nmining software repositories, allowing one to collect, analyze, and get\nactionable data-driven insights about refactoring practices within software\nprojects. Objective: Our goal is to identify, among the various quality models\npresented in the literature, the ones that align with the developer's vision of\neliminating duplicates of code, when they explicitly mention that they refactor\nthe code to improve them. Method: We extract a corpus of 332 refactoring\ncommits applied and documented by developers during their daily changes from\n128 open-source Java projects. In particular, we extract 32 structural metrics\nfrom which we identify code duplicate removal commits with their corresponding\nrefactoring operations, as perceived by software engineers. Thereafter, we\nempirically analyze the impact of these refactoring operations on a set of\ncommon state-of-the-art design quality metrics. Results: The statistical\nanalysis of the results obtained shows that (i) some state-of-the-art metrics\nare capable of capturing the developer's intention of removing code\nduplication; and (ii) some metrics are being more emphasized than others. We\nconfirm that various structural metrics can effectively represent code\nduplication, leading to different impacts on software quality. Some metrics\ncontribute to improvements, while others may lead to degradation. Conclusion:\nMost of the mapped metrics associated with the main quality attributes\nsuccessfully capture developers' intentions for removing code duplicates, as is\nevident from the commit messages. However, certain metrics do not fully capture\nthese intentions",

This\ncontribution will discuss the requirements of FCC-ee vertex detectors, from the\nnecessary impact parameter resolution via the challenging collision environment\nat the Z pole to the tight requirement on the material budget, which should be\nkept below 0.3% of a radiation length per detection layer. Next, the proposed\nvertex detector designs for FCC-ee are shortly presented, and an outlook is\ngiven on novel detector designs and features.\n  The requirements for the vertexing performance translate into requirements\nfor the sensors used for the vertex detector.

Estimates take on the form of simple rational functions of\nkinetic rates.

In this work, we provide\nanalytical fits for these scaling relations, valid for the dark matter\nparameter space compatible with current astrophysical and cosmological data\nthat can be directly incorporated into future studies of massive Boson stars in\nthe strong coupling regime, avoiding the need for numerical calculations. We\nalso provide analytical fits for empirical and universal relations, for\ngravitational wave asteroseismology, which can be used to infer microscopic\ndark matter properties following a successful detection. Further, we\ninvestigate the possibility of the detection of $f$-modes and the dark matter\nparameter space that can be probed with current and future gravitational wave\ndetectors across multiple frequency bands.",

In this paper, we aim to predict performance in closed-book question\nanswering (QA), a vital downstream task that directly reflects a model's\ninternalized knowledge without the help of external tools. We address three\nprimary challenges: (1) limited access to and understanding of pre-training\ncorpora, (2) limitations of current evaluation methods for pre-trained models,\nand (3) limitations of frequency-based metrics in predicting model performance.\nIn response, we conduct large-scale retrieval and semantic analysis across the\npre-training corpora of 21 publicly available and 3 custom-trained large\nlanguage models. We then develop a multi-template QA evaluation framework\nincorporating paraphrased question variants. Building on these foundations, we\npropose Size-dependent Mutual Information (SMI), an information-theoretic\nmetric that linearly correlates pre-training data characteristics, model size,\nand QA accuracy, without requiring additional training. Experimental results\nshow that SMI outperforms co-occurrence-based baselines, achieving $R^2 > 0.75$\non models with over one billion parameters.

    "abstract": "Objective: Identifying the activity of motor neurons (MNs) non-invasively is\npossible by decomposing signals from muscles, e.g., surface electromyography\n(EMG) or ultrasound. The theoretical background of MN identification is\nconvolutive blind source separation (cBSS), and different algorithms have been\ndeveloped and validated. Yet, the existence and identifiability of inverse\nsolutions and the corresponding estimation errors are not fully understood.\nFurther, the guidelines for selecting appropriate parameters are often built on\nempirical observations, limiting the translation to clinical applications and\nother modalities. Approach: We revisited the cBSS model for MN identification,\naugmented it with new theoretical insights and derived a framework that can\npredict the existence of inverse solutions. This framework allows the\nquantification of estimation errors due to the imperfect inversion of the motor\nunit action potentials (MUAP), noise sources, and the ill-conditioning of the\ninverse problem. To bridge the gap between theory and practice, we used\ncomputer simulations. Main results: (1) Increasing the similarity of MUAPs or\ncorrelation between spike trains increases the bias for detecting high\namplitude MUs. (2) The optimal objective function depends on the expected spike\namplitude, spike amplitude statistics and the amplitude of background spikes.\n(3) There is some wiggle room for MN detection given non-stationary MUAPs. (4)\nThere is no connection between MUAP duration and extension factor, in contrast\nto previous guidelines. (5) Source quality metrics like the silhouette score\n(SIL) or the pulse-to-noise ratio (PNR) are highly correlated with a source's\nobjective function output. (6) SIL is superior to PNR. Significance: These\nfindings will guide cBSS algorithm developments tailored to MN identification\nand clinical application translation.",

In practice, however, DMs such as financial\ninstitutions typically disclose only partial model information via\nexplanations. Such partial disclosure can lead agents to misinterpret the model\nand take actions that unknowingly harm their utility. A key open question is\nhow DMs can communicate explanations in a way that avoids harming strategic\nagents, while still supporting their own decision-making goals, e.g.,\nminimising predictive error. In this work, we analyse well-known explanation\nmethods, and establish a necessary condition to prevent explanations from\nmisleading agents into self-harming actions.

To demonstrate how ARexes can be\noperationalised in practice, we propose a simple learning procedure that\njointly optimises the predictive model and explanation policy.

Decision Trees (DTs), on the other hand, remain\na widely used class of models for structured tabular data but are typically not\ndesigned to capture sequential patterns directly. Instead, DT-based approaches\nfor time-series data often rely on feature engineering, such as manually\nincorporating lag features, which can be suboptimal for capturing complex\ntemporal dependencies. To address this limitation, we introduce ReMeDe Trees, a\nnovel recurrent DT architecture that integrates an internal memory mechanism,\nsimilar to RNNs, to learn long-term dependencies in sequential data. Our model\nlearns hard, axis-aligned decision rules for both output generation and state\nupdates, optimizing them efficiently via gradient descent.

Unlike raw\nhigh-dimensional countermeasure embeddings, which lack interpretability, the\nproposed probabilistic attribute embeddings aim to detect specific speech\nsynthesizer components, represented through high-level attributes and their\ncorresponding values. We use these probabilistic embeddings with four\nclassifier back-ends to address two downstream tasks: spoofing detection and\nspoofing attack attribution. The former is the well-known bonafide-spoof\ndetection task, whereas the latter seeks to identify the source method\n(generator) of a spoofed utterance. We additionally use Shapley values, a\nwidely used technique in machine learning, to quantify the relative\ncontribution of each attribute value to the decision-making process in each\ntask. Results on the ASVspoof2019 dataset demonstrate the substantial role of\nduration and conversion modeling in spoofing detection; and waveform generation\nand speaker modeling in spoofing attack attribution. In the detection task, the\nprobabilistic attribute embeddings achieve $99.7\\%$ balanced accuracy and\n$0.22\\%$ equal error rate (EER), closely matching the performance of raw\nembeddings ($99.9\\%$ balanced accuracy and $0.22\\%$ EER). Similarly, in the\nattribution task, our embeddings achieve $90.23\\%$ balanced accuracy and\n$2.07\\%$ EER, compared to $90.16\\%$ and $2.11\\%$ with raw embeddings. These\nresults demonstrate that the proposed framework is both inherently explainable\nby design and capable of achieving performance comparable to raw CM embeddings.",

Multi-agent reinforcement learning frameworks based on\nneural networks have gained significant interest to simulate the emergence of\nhuman-like linguistic phenomena. In this study, we employ such a framework in\nwhich agents first acquire an artificial language before engaging in\ncommunicative interactions, enabling direct comparisons to human result. Using\na very generic communication optimization algorithm and neural-network learners\nthat have no prior experience with language or semantic preferences, our\nresults demonstrate that learning alone does not lead to DCM, but when agents\ncommunicate, differential use of markers arises.

However, these datasets often\nexhibit long-tailed class distributions in real-world scenarios, leading to\nbiased demonstration selection. In this work, we show that such class\nimbalances significantly degrade the ICL performance across various tasks,\nregardless of selection methods. Moreover, classical rebalancing methods, which\nfocus solely on class weights, yield poor performance due to neglecting\ncondition bias--skewed feature distributions within classes. To address this,\nwe propose Reweighting with Conditional Bias (dubbed RCB), a simple and\ncomplementary approach to enhance ICL performance under class imbalance. In\nparticular, RCB estimates conditional bias using a balanced subset and\nre-weights demonstration scores based on both class weight and conditional\nbias. In effect, RCB prevents over-selection from dominant classes while\npreserving the efficacy of current selection methods. Extensive experiments on\ncommon benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, improving the\naverage accuracy of current selection methods by up to 5.42%.",

    "abstract": "In this work we show how to maximize absorption of plasmonic nanoparticles in\nterms of size, geometry and material. For that reason the interaction of\nnanoparticles with light was decomposed into different effects. We determined\nthat the main effect dictating the optimal amount of optical losses is\nradiation damping, and how it depends on nanoparticle size and geometry. Based\non this, we find that for many combinations of sizes and geometries losses in\npure metals are far from optimal. To overcome the aforementioned issue,\nalloying is presented as straightforward and flexible way of modulating the\noptical losses. Furthermore, strategies for tuning the optical losses to values\nabove, between, and even below those in pure plasmonic metals are developed in\nterms of selecting the right alloy composition. In some cases, alloys showed a\nmultifold increase in absorption when compared to pure plasmonic metals. The\nphysical reasons governing such changes are elucidated based on the electronic\nstructure changes during alloying of different metals, which enables\ngeneralization of the results to other systems. Besides increasing absorption,\nelectronic structure changes can also be utilized for channeling the absorbed\nenergy to suit different purposes, such as hot carrier generation for\nphotocatalysis or solar energy harvesting. Overall, these results establish\nalloying as a powerful tool for designing nanostructures for applications that\nutilize light absorption.",

The intensity I of\nthe pump laser is chosen such that excitation and ionization of the electronic\ndegrees of freedom are negligible while excitation of the wavepacket in the\nnuclear degrees of freedom is non-negligible. The numerical treatment, which\ntakes advantage of the fact that the laser pulse is very short compared to\ntypical molecular time scales, is based on a wave packet decomposition that\nutilizes hyperspherical coordinates. The framework is applied to the extremely\nfloppy bosonic helium trimer. A convergence analysis of the partial wave\ndecomposition is conducted. The kinetic energy release and orientation dynamics\nare presented. While the dynamics of more strongly-bound van der Waals trimers\nsuch as, e.g., the argon trimer display negligible coupling between vibrational\nand rotational degrees of freedom, rendering a description within a rigid-body\npicture appropriate, those of weakly-bound trimers display non-negligible\ncoupling between vibrational and rotational degrees of freedom, rendering a\ndescription within a rigid-body picture inappropriate.

    "abstract": "Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a well-suited technique for\nretrieving privacy-sensitive Electronic Health Records (EHR). It can serve as a\nkey module of the healthcare copilot, helping reduce misdiagnosis for\nhealthcare practitioners and patients. However, the diagnostic accuracy and\nspecificity of existing heuristic-based RAG models used in the medical domain\nare inadequate, particularly for diseases with similar manifestations. This\npaper proposes MedRAG, a RAG model enhanced by knowledge graph (KG)-elicited\nreasoning for the medical domain that retrieves diagnosis and treatment\nrecommendations based on manifestations. MedRAG systematically constructs a\ncomprehensive four-tier hierarchical diagnostic KG encompassing critical\ndiagnostic differences of various diseases. These differences are dynamically\nintegrated with similar EHRs retrieved from an EHR database, and reasoned\nwithin a large language model. This process enables more accurate and specific\ndecision support, while also proactively providing follow-up questions to\nenhance personalized medical decision-making. MedRAG is evaluated on both a\npublic dataset DDXPlus and a private chronic pain diagnostic dataset (CPDD)\ncollected from Tan Tock Seng Hospital, and its performance is compared against\nvarious existing RAG methods. Experimental results show that, leveraging the\ninformation integration and relational abilities of the KG, our MedRAG provides\nmore specific diagnostic insights and outperforms state-of-the-art models in\nreducing misdiagnosis rates.

    "abstract": "The size distribution of TNOs in the Kuiper Belt provides crucial insights\ninto the formation and evolution of the outer Solar System. Recent\nobservational surveys, including OSSOS++, have revealed that dynamically cold\nand hot TNO populations exhibit similar size distributions for dimmer objects\n($H_r > 5$), which are consistent with planetesimal formation by streaming\ninstability (SI). However, the hot population contains a significantly larger\nnumber of massive bodies, including several dwarf planets. In this study, we\ninvestigate the role of pebble accretion in shaping the size distribution of\nhot TNOs, after their formation in the primordial disk (PB) between 20 and 30\nau and before these bodies were dynamically implanted into their current orbits\nby a migrating Neptune. We find that pebble accretion grows the most massive\nbodies only, consistent with the flattening of the distribution brightwards of\n$H_r=5$. All results point to a correlation (degeneracy) between the pebble\naerodynamic size and the intensity of the gas motions. Nevertheless, accretion\nfrom an inward-drifting stream of pebbles is unlikely, as it puts extreme\ndemands on the mass budget of pebbles. In particular, the masses of the cold\nclassicals are too low to trigger pebble accretion. Accretion in an environment\nwhere pebbles are entrained, as believed to be the case in rings seen with\nALMA, is preferable. Combining the constraints obtained from this study with\nALMA imagery morphology fitting reveals a typical pebble aerodynamic size of\n$\\tau_s \\sim 10^{-2}$, a turbulent diffusivity parameter $\\alpha_D\\sim10^{-3}$,\nand a total accreted pebble mass of ${\\sim}10\\,m_\\oplus$ in the primordial\nbelt. Those TNOs formed through significant pebble accretion with masses\nexceeding ${\\sim}10^{-4}\\,m_\\oplus$ are likely to satisfy the International\nAstronomical Union's ``round shape'' criterion for dwarf planets.",

These models exhibit a\nremarkable ability to generate highly artistic and intricately detailed images\nbased on textual prompts. However, obtaining desired generation outcomes often\nnecessitates repetitive trials of manipulating text prompts just like casting\nspells on a magic mirror, and the reason behind that is the limited capability\nof semantic understanding inherent in current image generation models.\nSpecifically, existing diffusion models encode the text prompt input with a\npre-trained encoder structure, which is usually trained on a limited number of\nimage-caption pairs. The state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) based on\nthe decoder-only structure have shown a powerful semantic understanding\ncapability as their architectures are more suitable for training on very\nlarge-scale unlabeled data. In this work, we propose to enhance text-to-image\ndiffusion models by borrowing the strength of semantic understanding from large\nlanguage models, and devise a simple yet effective adapter to allow the\ndiffusion models to be compatible with the decoder-only structure. Meanwhile,\nwe also provide a supporting theoretical analysis with various architectures\n(e.g., encoder-only, encoder-decoder, and decoder-only), and conduct extensive\nempirical evaluations to verify its effectiveness.

    "abstract": "This chapter is about the fundamentals of fabrication, control, and\nhuman-robot interaction of a new type of collaborative robotic manipulators,\ncalled malleable robots, which are based on adjustable architectures of varying\nstiffness for achieving high dexterity with lower mobility arms. Collaborative\nrobots, or cobots, commonly integrate six or more degrees of freedom (DOF) in a\nserial arm in order to allow positioning in constrained spaces and adaptability\nacross tasks. Increasing the dexterity of robotic arms has been indeed\ntraditionally accomplished by increasing the number of degrees of freedom of\nthe system; however, once a robotic task has been established (e.g., a\npick-and-place operation), the motion of the end-effector can be normally\nachieved using less than 6-DOF (i.e., lower mobility). The aim of malleable\nrobots is to close the technological gap that separates current cobots from\nachieving flexible, accessible manufacturing automation with a reduced number\nof actuators.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive biases are predictable, systematic errors in human reasoning. They\ninfluence decision-making in various areas, including architectural\ndecision-making, where architects face many choices. For example, anchoring can\ncause architects to unconsciously prefer the first architectural solution that\nthey came up with, without considering any solution alternatives. Prior\nresearch suggests that training individuals in debiasing techniques during a\npractical workshop can help reduce the impact of biases. The goal of this study\nwas to design and evaluate a debiasing workshop with individuals at various\nstages of their professional careers. To test the workshop's effectiveness, we\nperformed an experiment with 16 students and 20 practitioners, split into\ncontrol and workshop group pairs. We recorded and analyzed their think-aloud\ndiscussions about improving the architectures of systems they collaborated on.\nThe workshop improved the participants' argumentation when discussing\narchitectural decisions and increased the use of debiasing techniques taught\nduring the workshop. This led to the successful reduction of the researched\nbiases' occurrences. In particular, anchoring and optimism bias occurrences\ndecreased significantly. We also found that practitioners were more susceptible\nto cognitive biases than students, so the workshop had a more substantial\nimpact on practitioners. We assume that the practitioners' attachment to their\nsystems may be the cause of their susceptibility to biases. Finally, we\nidentified factors that may reduce the effectiveness of the debiasing workshop.\nOn that basis, we prepared a set of teaching suggestions for educators.\nOverall, we recommend using this workshop to educate both students and\nexperienced practitioners about the typical harmful influences of cognitive\nbias on architectural decisions and how to avoid them.",

    "abstract": "Interference effects are usually observed by intensity measurement. Path\nindistinguishability by quantum complementarity principle requires projection\nof the interfering fields into a common indistinguishable mode before\ndetection. On the other hand, the essence of wave interference is the addition\nof amplitudes of the interfering fields. Therefore, if amplitudes can be\ndirectly measured and added, interference can occur even though the interfering\nfields are in well-distinguishable modes. Here, we make a comprehensive study\nin both theory and experiment of a technique by homodyne measurement of field\namplitudes to reveal interference. This works for both classical and quantum\nfields even though there exists distinguishability in the interfering paths of\nlight. This directly challenges complementarity principle. We present a\nresolution of this issue from the viewpoint of measurement that emphasizes\neither particle or wave. This technique is particularly useful for recovering\ninterference in unbalanced interferometers with path-imbalance beyond coherence\nlength of the input field and can be applied to remote sensing to extend\napplicable range. Since the amplitude-based interference phenomena studied here\nare fundamentally different from the traditional intenisty-based interference\nphenomena, our approach leads to a new paradigm to study coherence between\noptical fields.",

This paper presents a system\ndesigned for the automated testing of in-vehicle APIs. By clearly defining and\nsegmenting the testing process, we enable Large Language Models (LLMs) to focus\non specific tasks, ensuring a stable and controlled testing workflow.\nExperiments conducted on over 100 APIs demonstrate that our system effectively\nautomates vehicle API testing. The results also confirm that LLMs can\nefficiently handle mundane tasks requiring human judgment, making them suitable\nfor complete automation in similar industrial contexts.",

Our findings demonstrate that both ILs\ninduce significant disorder in lipid membranes by altering the area per lipid\nmolecule, thereby modulating their viscoelastic properties. ILs with longer\nalkyl chains show stronger interactions with membranes, causing more pronounced\ndisorder. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy indicates that IL\nincorporation shifts the membrane main phase transition to lower temperatures\nand introduces gauche defects, signifying increased structural disorder. This\neffect is amplified with longer alkyl chains and higher IL concentrations.\nQuasielastic neutron scattering studies highlight that ILs markedly enhance the\nlateral diffusion of lipids within the membrane leaflet, with the extent of\nenhancement determined by the membrane physical state, IL concentration, and\nalkyl chain length. The most pronounced acceleration in lateral diffusion\noccurs in ordered membrane phase with higher concentrations of the longer chain\nIL. Molecular dynamics simulations corroborate these experimental findings,\nshowing that longer chain ILs extensively disrupt lipid organization, introduce\nmore gauche defects, increase the area per lipid, and consequently enhance\nlateral diffusion.

This study therefore\nproposes a multimodal deep-learning approach utilizing complementary\ninformation from routine anatomical MR images, clinical parameters, and RT\ntreatment planning information for improved predictive accuracy. The approach\nutilizes a self-supervised Vision Transformer (ViT) to encode multi-sequence MR\nbrain volumes to effectively capture both global and local context from the\nhigh dimensional input. The encoder is trained in a self-supervised upstream\ntask on unlabeled glioma MRI datasets from the open BraTS2021, UPenn-GBM, and\nUCSF-PDGM datasets to generate compact, clinically relevant representations\nfrom FLAIR and T1 post-contrast sequences. These encoded MR inputs are then\nintegrated with clinical data and RT treatment planning information through\nguided cross-modal attention, improving progression classification accuracy.\nThis work was developed using two datasets from different centers: the Burdenko\nGlioblastoma Progression Dataset (n = 59) for training and validation, and the\nGlioCMV progression dataset from the University Hospital Erlangen (UKER) (n =\n20) for testing. The proposed method achieved an AUC of 75.3%, outperforming\nthe current state-of-the-art data-driven approaches.

Timing analysis of fast variability in low Fourier\nfrequency bands shows that high-energy photons lag behind low-energy photons, a\nphenomenon referred to as hard lag. Conversely, in high Fourier frequency\nbands, low-energy photons lag behind high-energy photons, known as soft lag.\nThis frequency-dependent lag spectrum suggests that the lags arise from\ndifferent physical processes. Notably, a trend has been observed wherein the\nlags shift towards shorter timescales during the rising hard state, indicating\nan evolution in the inner accretion flow.

The objective is\nto maximize the average sum rate and we take a particle swarm optimization\napproach to solve it. Simulation results show that PIA achieves performance\ncomparable to MA-enabled arrays while outperforming traditional uniform arrays.\nHence, PIA offers a fixed yet efficient array deployment approach without the\ncomplexities associated with MA-enabled arrays.",

OntoSCPrompt first\ngenerates a SPARQL query structure (including SPARQL keywords such as SELECT,\nASK, WHERE and placeholders for missing tokens) and then fills them with\nKG-specific information. To enhance the understanding of the underlying KG, we\npresent an ontology-guided, hybrid prompt learning strategy that integrates KG\nontology into the learning process of hybrid prompts (e.g., discrete and\ncontinuous vectors). We also present several task-specific decoding strategies\nto ensure the correctness and executability of generated SPARQL queries in both\nstages. Experimental results demonstrate that OntoSCPrompt performs as well as\nSOTA approaches without retraining on a number of KGQA datasets such as CWQ,\nWebQSP and LC-QuAD 1.0 in a resource-efficient manner and can generalize well\nto unseen domain-specific KGs like DBLP-QuAD and CoyPu KG Code:\n\\href{https://github.com/LongquanJiang/OntoSCPrompt}{https://github.com/LongquanJiang/OntoSCPrompt}",

    "abstract": "In Paper I, we introduced the hybrid Relay, an alternative second-generation\ntime-delay interferometry (TDI) configuration designed to minimize null\nfrequencies and enhance gravitational wave (GW) analysis for massive binary\nblack holes (MBBHs). In Paper II, we further improved its noise\ncharacterization performance by replacing its null stream with a more stable\nchannel, $C^{12}_3$. In this work, we present a novel TDI scheme, PD4L, which\nfeatures minimal null frequencies and a reduced time span. Unlike the hybrid\nRelay or the second-generation Michelson which require delays up to $7L$ (with\n$L$ denoting the light-travel time between spacecraft), the PD4L uses delays no\nlonger than $3L$, corresponding to a total time span of $4L$. This compact\nstructure yields several advantages: 1) reducing data margins at segment\nboundaries, 2) mitigating aliasing in the high frequency regime, and 3)\nshortening the signal tails caused by long span. To evaluate PD4L's\nperformance, we perform parameter inference for chirping GW signals from\ncoalescing MBBHs. Our results show that the PD4L outperforms the hybrid Relay\nin the high frequency band and performs comparably at low frequencies.\nMoreover, PD4L's null stream exhibits the same minimal null frequencies as its\nscience channels and maintains a more stable noise spectrum than $C^{12}_3$.\nWhile the noise spectra of its science channels are slightly less stable than\nthose of the hybrid Relay, PD4L can still reliably infer noise parameters for\ndata durations of up to four months.

    "abstract": "The Ucar effect is a simple yet astonishing phenomenon where a permanent\nmagnet can be levitated by placing it in the vicinity of another permanent\nmagnet that rotates sufficiently fast. The few previous works on this type of\nmagnetic levitation all required magnets rotating on the order of 200 Hz. Here\nwe investigate the influence of applying a static magnetic field on the\nrotation axis and show that this can lower the needed rotation frequency to\nbelow 50 Hz. We explain this by a detailed analysis of the force producing\nlevitation, which is a superposition of a repelling force caused by the\noff-axis (rotating) magnetic field and an attractive force due to the on-axis\nfield. We study this force and resulting levitation experimentally,\nanalytically and numerically for three different rotor magnet configurations,\nshowing that trends in the levitation distance and frequency range can be\naccurately predicted from both the numerical and analytical models.",

    "abstract": "One of the most significant challenges in Music Emotion Recognition (MER)\ncomes from the fact that emotion labels can be heterogeneous across datasets\nwith regard to the emotion representation, including categorical (e.g., happy,\nsad) versus dimensional labels (e.g., valence-arousal). In this paper, we\npresent a unified multitask learning framework that combines these two types of\nlabels and is thus able to be trained on multiple datasets. This framework uses\nan effective input representation that combines musical features (i.e., key and\nchords) and MERT embeddings. Moreover, knowledge distillation is employed to\ntransfer the knowledge of teacher models trained on individual datasets to a\nstudent model, enhancing its ability to generalize across multiple tasks. To\nvalidate our proposed framework, we conducted extensive experiments on a\nvariety of datasets, including MTG-Jamendo, DEAM, PMEmo, and EmoMusic.\nAccording to our experimental results, the inclusion of musical features,\nmultitask learning, and knowledge distillation significantly enhances\nperformance. In particular, our model outperforms the state-of-the-art models,\nincluding the best-performing model from the MediaEval 2021 competition on the\nMTG-Jamendo dataset. Our work makes a significant contribution to MER by\nallowing the combination of categorical and dimensional emotion labels in one\nunified framework, thus enabling training across datasets.",

In order to ensure this\nsystem operates as intended, accurate tracking of the spatiotemporal trajectory\nis of crucial significance. Moreover, minimizing the tracking error is a\nnecessary step in this process. To this end, a novel lead-lag judgment\nmechanism is proposed. This mechanism precisely quantifies the longitudinal\npositional deviation between the vehicle and the target trajectory over time,\nthen the deviation is corrected with a real - time acceleration compensation\nstrategy, as a result, the accuracy and reliability of trajectory tracking are\nsignificantly enhanced. Real - vehicle experiments were conducted in a\ndedicated test field to validate the feasibility of this innovative approach\nempirically. Subsequently, the obtained tracking data was subsequent processed\nusing the lead-lag judgment mechanism. In this step, we carefully analyzed the\nspatiotemporal error patterns between the vehicle and the target trajectory\nunder different alignments and speeds. Finally, using real highway speed and\nalignment data, we conducted comprehensive spatiotemporal trajectory tracking\nsimulations. Through experiments and simulations, tracking errors maintained in\nan acceptable range and reasonable spatiotemporal distance is given during the\npreemptive merging process on highway ramps. Overall, this study offers\nvaluable insights for highway ramp emerging safety. Future work can expand on\nthese findings.",

However, standard PINNs often require a\nlarge number of training samples to achieve high accuracy, leading to increased\ncomputational costs. To address this issue, we propose Active Learning-Driven\nPINNs (AL-PINN), which integrates Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) and Active\nLearning (AL) strategies to optimize sample selection dynamically.\n  AL-PINN utilizes Monte Carlo Dropout to estimate epistemic uncertainty in the\nmodel predictions, enabling the adaptive selection of high-uncertainty regions\nfor additional training. This approach significantly enhances learning\nefficiency by focusing computational resources on the most informative data\npoints. We evaluate AL-PINN on benchmark PDE problems with known analytical\nsolutions and real-world WeatherBench climate data. Our results demonstrate\nthat AL-PINN achieves comparable or superior accuracy compared to traditional\nPINNs while reducing the number of required training samples.\n  The proposed framework is particularly beneficial for scientific and\nengineering applications where data collection is expensive or limited, such as\nclimate modeling, medical simulations, and material science.

Despite its mathematical simplicity, its\nimplementation in fixed time-step molecular simulations remains a formidable\nchallenge due to the discontinuity at contact. To circumvent the issues\nassociated with the ill-defined force at contact, a continuous\npotential--referred to here as the pseudo-hard-sphere (pHS) potential--has\nrecently been proposed [J. Chem, Phys. 149, 164907 (2018)]. This potential is\nconstructed to match the second virial coefficient of the hard-sphere potential\nand is expected to mimic its thermodynamic properties. However, this hypothesis\nhas only been partially validated within the fluid region of the phase diagram\nfor hard-sphere dispersions in two and three dimensions. In this contribution,\nwe examine the ability of the continuous pHS potential to reproduce the\nequation of state of a hard-sphere fluid, not only in the fluid phase but also\nacross the fluid-solid coexistence region. Our focus is primarily on\nhard-sphere systems in three and four dimensions.

    "abstract": "Visual-language foundation Models (FMs) exhibit remarkable zero-shot\ngeneralization across diverse tasks, largely attributed to extensive\npre-training on largescale datasets. However, their robustness on\nlow-resolution/pixelated (LR) images, a common challenge in real-world\nscenarios, remains underexplored. We introduce LR0.FM, a comprehensive\nbenchmark evaluating the impact of low resolution on the zero-shot\nclassification performance of 10 FM(s) across 66 backbones and 15 datasets. We\npropose a novel metric, Weighted Aggregated Robustness, to address the\nlimitations of existing metrics and better evaluate model performance across\nresolutions and datasets. Our key findings show that: (i) model size positively\ncorrelates with robustness to resolution degradation, (ii) pre-training dataset\nquality is more important than its size, and (iii) fine-tuned and higher\nresolution models are less robust against LR. Our analysis further reveals that\nthe model makes semantically reasonable predictions at LR, and the lack of\nfine-grained details in input adversely impacts the model's initial layers more\nthan the deeper layers. We use these insights and introduce a simple strategy,\nLR-TK0, to enhance the robustness of models without compromising their\npre-trained weights. We demonstrate the effectiveness of LR-TK0 for robustness\nagainst low-resolution across several datasets and its generalization\ncapability across backbones and other approaches.

In this SFDMA scheme, the multi-user semantic\ninformation is encoded into discrete approximately orthogonal representations,\nand the encoded semantic features of multiple users can be simultaneously\ntransmitted in the same time-frequency resource. Specifically, for inference\ntasks, we design a SFDMA digital BC network based on robust information\nbottleneck (RIB), which can achieve a tradeoff between inference performance,\ndata compression and multi-user interference. Moreover, for image\nreconstruction tasks, we develop a SFDMA digital BC network by utilizing a Swin\nTransformer, which significantly reduces multi-user interference. More\nimportantly, SFDMA can protect the privacy of users' semantic information, in\nwhich each receiver can only decode its own semantic information. Furthermore,\nwe establish a relationship between performance and signal to interference plus\nnoise ratio (SINR), which is fitted by an Alpha-Beta-Gamma (ABG) function.\nFurthermore, an optimal power allocation method is developed for the inference\nand reconstruction tasks. Extensive simulations verify the effectiveness and\nsuperiority of our proposed SFDMA scheme.",

While automated machine learning pipelines are\nstarting to recognize and integrate data preprocessing into their solutions for\nclassification and regression tasks, this integration is lacking for more\nspecialized tasks like survival or time-to-event models. As a result, survival\nanalysis not only faces the general challenges of data preprocessing but also\nsuffers from the lack of tailored, automated solutions in this area.\n  To address this gap, this paper presents 'CleanSurvival', a\nreinforcement-learning-based solution for optimizing preprocessing pipelines,\nextended specifically for survival analysis. The framework can handle\ncontinuous and categorical variables, using Q-learning to select which\ncombination of data imputation, outlier detection and feature extraction\ntechniques achieves optimal performance for a Cox, random forest, neural\nnetwork or user-supplied time-to-event model. The package is available on\nGitHub: https://github.com/datasciapps/CleanSurvival\n  Experimental benchmarks on real-world datasets show that the Q-learning-based\ndata preprocessing results in superior predictive performance to standard\napproaches, finding such a model up to 10 times faster than undirected random\ngrid search.

In this\nwork, we investigate the perturbations induced on streams by the passage of\ndense stellar systems, such as globular clusters themselves, to test the\npossibility that they may cause the formation of gaps as well. In particular,\nwe focus on the study of the stream of Palomar 5, a well-known globular cluster\nin the Galactic halo, which has particularly long tidal tails. For this\npurpose, we used a particle-test code to simulate Palomar 5's tidal tails when\nsubjected to the Galaxy's gravitational field plus its whole system of globular\nclusters. Our study shows that the tails of Palomar 5 can be strongly perturbed\nby the close passage of other clusters, in particular of NGC 2808, NGC 7078,\nNGC 104, and that these perturbations induce the formation of gaps in the\ntails. These results show that globular clusters are capable of inducing gaps\nin streams--as other baryonic components such as giant molecular clouds and the\ngalactic bar have been shown to do in other works. Therefore, when searching to\nconstruct the distribution function of dark matter sub halos within the Milky\nWay, the gap contribution from globular clusters must be included.",

    "abstract": "Robots with very limited capabilities are placed on the vertices of a graph\nand are required to move toward a single, common vertex, where they remain\nstationary once they arrive. This task is referred to as the GATHERING problem.\nMost of the research on this topic has focused on feasibility challenges in the\nasynchronous setting, where robots operate independently of each other. A\ncommon assumption in these studies is that robots are equipped with\nmultiplicity detection, the ability to recognize whether a vertex is occupied\nby more than one robot. Additionally, initial configurations are often\nrestricted to ensure that no vertex hosts more than one robot. A key difficulty\narises from the possible symmetries in the robots' placement relative to the\ngraph's topology. This paper investigates the GATHERING problem on Rings under\na sequential scheduler, where only one robot at a time is active. While this\nsequential activation helps to break symmetries, we remove two common\nassumptions: robots do not have multiplicity detection, and in initial\nconfigurations, vertices can be occupied by multiplicities. We prove that such\na generalized GATHERING problem cannot be solved under general sequential\nschedulers. However, we provide a complete characterization of the problem when\na sequential Round Robin scheduler is used, where robots are activated one at a\ntime in a fixed cyclic order that repeats indefinitely. Furthermore, we fully\ncharacterize the DISTINCT GATHERING problem, the most used variant of\nGATHERING, in which the initial configurations do not admit multiplicities.",

A prime example is\nnumerical weather prediction, where atmospheric processes are modeled using\ndiscrete gridded representations of the physical variables and dynamics.\nUncertainties are assessed by running the simulations multiple times, yielding\nensembles of simulated fields as a high-dimensional stochastic representation\nof the forecast distribution. The high-dimensionality and large volume of\nensemble datasets poses major computing challenges for subsequent forecasting\nstages. Data-driven dimensionality reduction techniques could help to reduce\nthe data volume before further processing by learning meaningful and compact\nrepresentations. However, existing dimensionality reduction methods are\ntypically designed for deterministic and single-valued inputs, and thus cannot\nhandle ensemble data from multiple randomized simulations. In this study, we\npropose novel dimensionality reduction approaches specifically tailored to the\nformat of ensemble forecast fields. We present two alternative frameworks,\nwhich yield low-dimensional representations of ensemble forecasts while\nrespecting their probabilistic character. The first approach derives a\ndistribution-based representation of an input ensemble by applying standard\ndimensionality reduction techniques in a member-by-member fashion and merging\nthe member representations into a joint parametric distribution model. The\nsecond approach achieves a similar representation by encoding all members\njointly using a tailored variational autoencoder. We evaluate and compare both\napproaches in a case study using 10 years of temperature and wind speed\nforecasts over Europe. The approaches preserve key spatial and statistical\ncharacteristics of the ensemble and enable probabilistic reconstructions of the\nforecast fields.",

DiTAR utilizes a\ndivide-and-conquer strategy for patch generation, where the language model\nprocesses aggregated patch embeddings and the diffusion transformer\nsubsequently generates the next patch based on the output of the language\nmodel. For inference, we propose defining temperature as the time point of\nintroducing noise during the reverse diffusion ODE to balance diversity and\ndeterminism.

Despite the growing potential of upcoming LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA\nobserving runs and future detectors to measure eccentric-precessing signals,\naccurately and efficiently modeling them remains a challenge. In this work, we\npresent pyEFPE, a frequency-domain post-Newtonian (PN) waveform model for the\ninspiral of precessing-eccentric compact binaries. pyEFPE improves upon\nprevious models by introducing analytical expressions for the Fourier mode\namplitudes, enhancing the numerical stability of the multiple scale analysis\nframework, and adding recently derived PN corrections, critical to accurately\ndescribe signals in GW detectors. Additionally, we simplify the numerical\nimplementation and introduce a scheme to interpolate the amplitudes, achieving\na speedup of up to ~O(15) in the waveform computations, making the model\npractical for data analysis applications. We thoroughly validate pyEFPE by\ncomparing it to other waveform models in the quasi-circular and\neccentric-spin-aligned limits, finding good agreement. Additionally, we\ndemonstrate pyEFPE's capability to analyze simulated GW events, accurately\nrecovering the parameters of signals described by both pyEFPE and IMRPhenomXP.\nWhile pyEFPE still lacks important physical effects, such as higher-order PN\ncorrections, higher-order modes, mode asymmetries, tidal interactions or the\nmerger-ringdown phase, it represents a significant step towards more complete\nwaveform models, offering a flexible and efficient framework that can be\nextended in future work to incorporate these effects.",

The focus of this\narticle is to deliver unbiased estimates of the unknown parameters, that is,\nstochastic estimators that, in expectation, are equal to the maximize of the\nmarginal likelihood, and possess no numerical approximation error.

Research results suggest that LLMs\nsurpass the mere replication of existing code examples, where some LLMs have\nbeen trained on an open-source multibody simulation code. However, for\nclosed-source simulation software, such results are not to be expected as their\nideas and concepts might differ from other publicly available ones.

A series of tests have been\nconducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed force sensor, including\nforce calibration, repeatability test, hysteresis study, force measurement\ncomparison, and temperature calibration and compensation tests. The results\ndemonstrated good repeatability, with a force measurement range of 4.69 N, a\nhigh sensitivity of approximately 1169.04 pm/N, a root mean square error (RMSE)\nof 0.12 N, and a maximum hysteresis of 4.83%. When compared to a commercial\nload cell, the sensor showed a percentage error of 2.56% and an RMSE of 0.14 N.\nBesides, the proposed sensor validated its temperature compensation\neffectiveness, with a force RMSE of 0.01 N over a temperature change of 11\nCelsius degree. The sensor was integrated with a soft grow-and-twine gripper to\nmonitor interaction forces between different objects and the robotic gripper.\nClosed-loop force control was applied during automated pick-and-place tasks and\nsignificantly improved gripping stability, as demonstrated in tests.

    "abstract": "Space layout design (SLD), occurring in the early stages of the design\nprocess, nonetheless influences both the functionality and aesthetics of the\nultimate architectural outcome. The complexity of SLD necessitates innovative\napproaches to efficiently explore vast solution spaces. While image-based\ngenerative AI has emerged as a potential solution, they often rely on\npixel-based space composition methods that lack intuitive representation of\narchitectural processes. This paper leverages deep Reinforcement Learning (RL),\nas it offers a procedural approach that intuitively mimics the process of human\ndesigners. Effectively using RL for SLD requires an explorative space composing\nmethod to generate desirable design solutions. We introduce \"laser-wall\", a\nnovel space partitioning method that conceptualizes walls as emitters of\nimaginary light beams to partition spaces. This approach bridges vector-based\nand pixel-based partitioning methods, offering both flexibility and exploratory\npower in generating diverse layouts. We present two planning strategies:\none-shot planning, which generates entire layouts in a single pass, and dynamic\nplanning, which allows for adaptive refinement by continuously transforming\nlaser-walls. Additionally, we introduce on-light and off-light wall\ntransformations for smooth and fast layout refinement, as well as identity-less\nand identity-full walls for versatile room assignment. We developed\nSpaceLayoutGym, an open-source OpenAI Gym compatible simulator for generating\nand evaluating space layouts.

Annotating a large amount of\ndata is vital and can be a make-or-break factor for the robustness of a\ntracking model. Robustness is particularly crucial in animal tracking, as\naccurate tracking over long time horizons is essential for capturing the\nbehavior of animals. However, generating additional annotations using\nfoundation models can be counterproductive, as the quality of the annotations\nis just as important. Poorly annotated data can introduce noise and\ninaccuracies, ultimately compromising the performance and accuracy of the\ntrained model. Over-reliance on automated annotations without ensuring\nprecision can lead to diminished results, making careful oversight and quality\ncontrol essential in the annotation process. Ultimately, we demonstrate that a\nthoughtful combination of automated annotations and manually annotated data is\na valuable strategy, yielding an IDF1 score of 80.8 against blind usage of SAM2\nvideo with an IDF1 score of 65.6.",

    "abstract": "Although \"climate litigation\" is not an indigenous term in China, localizing\nit is essential to support the development of an independent environmental\nlegal knowledge system in China. Rooted in China's judicial tradition, which\nemphasizes substantive rationality, traditional legal theories have primarily\nfocused on environmental law. However, the contemporary practices in the rule\nof law have created an unclear trajectory for climate litigation. Research in\nthis area has long been trapped in a paradigm that relies on lawsuits for\necological environmental damage compensation and environmental public interest\nlitigation, leading to a significant disconnect between theoretical frameworks\nand practical application. With the advancement of the \"dual carbon\" strategic\ngoals-carbon peaking and carbon neutrality-it has become imperative to redefine\nthe concept of climate litigation within the Chinese context. We need to\nestablish a theoretical framework that aligns with the \"dual carbon\" objectives\nwhile providing theoretical and institutional support for climate litigation,\nultimately contributing to the international discourse on climate justice.\nAdditionally, Hong Kong's proactive climate governance and robust ESG\n(Environmental, Social, and Governance) practices provide valuable insights for\ndeveloping comprehensive climate litigation mechanisms. Based on this analysis,\nwe propose concrete plans for building a climate litigation system in China,\nestablishing a preventive relief system and a multi-source legal framework at\nthe substantive level and developing climate judicial mechanisms for mitigation\nand adaptation at the procedural level.",

    "abstract": "The choice of delay-Doppler domain (DD) pulse shaping filter plays an\nimportant role in determining the performance of Zak-OTFS. Sinc filter has good\nmain lobe characteristics (with nulls at information grid points) which is good\nfor equalization/detection, but has high side lobes which are detrimental for\ninput-output (I/O) relation estimation. Whereas, Gaussian filter is highly\nlocalized with very low side lobes which is good for I/O relation estimation,\nbut has poor main lobe characteristics which is not good for\nequalization/detection. In this paper, we propose a new filter, termed as {\\em\nGaussian-sinc (GS) filter}, which inherits the complementary strengths of both\nGaussian and sinc filters. The proposed filter does not incur time or bandwidth\nexpansion. We derive closed-form expressions for the I/O relation and noise\ncovariance of Zak-OTFS with the proposed GS filter. We evaluate the Zak-OTFS\nperformance for different pulse shaping filters with I/O relation estimated\nusing exclusive and embedded pilots. Our results show that the proposed GS\nfilter achieves better bit error rate (BER) performance compared to other\nfilters reported in the literature. For example, with model-free I/O relation\nestimation using embedded pilot and 8-QAM, the proposed GS filter achieves an\nSNR gain of about 4 dB at $10^{-2}$ uncoded BER compared to Gaussian and sinc\nfilters, and the SNR gain becomes more than 6 dB at a coded BER of $10^{-4}$\nwith rate-1/2 coding.",

    ],
    "abstract": "Variational phase field fracture models are now widely used to simulate crack\npropagation in structures. A critical aspect of these simulations is the\ncorrect determination of the propagation threshold of pre-existing cracks, as\nit highly relies on how the initial cracks are implemented. While prior studies\nbriefly discuss initial crack implementation techniques, we present here a\nsystematic investigation. Various techniques to introduce initial cracks in\nphase field fracture simulations are tested, from the crack explicit meshing to\nthe replacement by a fully damaged phase field, including different variants\nfor the boundary conditions. Our focus here is on phase field models aiming to\napproximate, in the $\\Gamma$-convergence limit, Griffith quasi-static\npropagation in the framework of Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics. Therefore, a\nsharp crack model from classic linear elastic fracture mechanics based on\nGriffith criterion is the reference in this work. To assess the different\ntechniques to introduce initial cracks, we rely on path-following methods to\ncompute the sharp crack and the phase field smeared crack solutions. The\nunderlying idea is that path-following ensures staying at equilibrium at each\ninstant so that any difference between phase field and sharp crack models can\nbe attributed to numerical artifacts. Thus, by comparing the results from both\nmodels, we can provide practical recommendations for reliably incorporating\ninitial cracks in phase field fracture simulations. The comparison shows that\nan improper initial crack implementation often requires the smeared crack to\ntransition to a one-element-wide phase band to adequately represent a\ndisplacement jump along a crack. This transition increases the energy required\nto propagate the crack, leading to a significant overshoot in the\nforce-displacement response. The take-home message is that to predict the\npropagation threshold accurately and avoid artificial toughening; the crack\nmust be initialized either setting the phase field to its damage state over a\none-element-wide band or meshing the crack explicitly as a one-element-wide\nslit and imposing the fully cracked state on the crack surface.",

    "abstract": "Fuzzy rule-based systems interpret data in low-dimensional domains, providing\ntransparency and interpretability. In contrast, deep learning excels in complex\ntasks like image and speech recognition but is prone to overfitting in sparse,\nunstructured, or low-dimensional data. This interpretability is crucial in\nfields like healthcare and finance. Traditional rule-based systems, especially\nANFIS with grid partitioning, suffer from exponential rule growth as\ndimensionality increases. We propose a strategic rule-reduction model that\napplies Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on normalized firing strengths to\nobtain linearly uncorrelated components. Binary Particle Swarm Optimization\n(BPSO) selectively refines these components, significantly reducing the number\nof rules while preserving precision in decision-making. A custom parameter\nupdate mechanism fine-tunes specific ANFIS layers by dynamically adjusting BPSO\nparameters, avoiding local minima. We validated our approach on standard UCI\nrespiratory, keel classification, regression datasets, and a real-world\nischemic stroke dataset, demonstrating adaptability and practicality. Results\nindicate fewer rules, shorter training, and high accuracy, underscoring the\nmethods effectiveness for low-dimensional interpretability and complex data\nscenarios. This synergy of fuzzy logic and optimization fosters robust\nsolutions. Our method contributes a powerful framework for interpretable AI in\nmultiple domains.

    "abstract": "Spiking Large Language Models have been shown as a good alternative to LLMs\nin various scenarios. Existing methods for creating Spiking LLMs, i.e., direct\ntraining and ANN-SNN conversion, often suffer from performance degradation and\nrelatively high computational costs. To address these issues, we propose a\nnovel Fast ANN-SNN conversion strategy (FAS) that transforms LLMs into spiking\nLLMs in two stages. The first stage employs a full-parameter fine-tuning of\npre-trained models, so it does not need any direct training from scratch. The\nsecond stage introduces a coarse-to-fine calibration method to reduce\nconversion errors and improve accuracy. Experiments on both language and\nvision-language tasks across four different scales of LLMs demonstrate that FAS\ncan achieve state-of-the-art performance yet with significantly reduced\ninference latency and computational costs. Notably, FAS only takes eight\ntimesteps to achieve an accuracy of 3\\% higher than that of the OPT-7B model,\nwhile reducing energy consumption by 96.63\\%.

    "abstract": "The integration of slow-thinking mechanisms into large language models (LLMs)\noffers a promising way toward achieving Level 2 AGI Reasoners, as exemplified\nby systems like OpenAI's o1. However, several significant challenges remain,\nincluding inefficient overthinking and an overreliance on auxiliary reward\nmodels. We point out that these limitations stem from LLMs' inability to\ninternalize the search process, a key component of effective reasoning. A\ncritical step toward addressing this issue is enabling LLMs to autonomously\ndetermine when and where to backtrack, a fundamental operation in traditional\nsearch algorithms. To this end, we propose a self-backtracking mechanism that\nequips LLMs with the ability to backtrack during both training and inference.\nThis mechanism not only enhances reasoning ability but also efficiency by\ntransforming slow-thinking processes into fast-thinking through\nself-improvement. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our proposal\nsignificantly enhances the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, achieving a\nperformance gain of over 40 percent compared to the optimal-path supervised\nfine-tuning method. We believe this study introduces a novel and promising\npathway for developing more advanced and robust Reasoners.",

The FOEWPT\nis one of the requirements needed for electroweak baryogenesis to explain the\nbaryon asymmetry of the universe (BAU). Thus, the RxSM is a perfect example to\nstudy features related to the FOEWPT at current and future collider\nexperiments. The RxSM has two CP-even Higgs bosons, $h$ and $H$, with masses\n$m_h < m_H$, where we assume that $h$ corresponds to the Higgs boson discovered\nat the LHC. Our analysis is based on a benchmark plane that ensures the\noccurence of a strong FOEWPT, where $m_H > 2 m_h$ is found. In a first step we\nanalyze the di-Higgs production at the (HL-)LHC, $gg \\to hh$, with a focus on\nthe impact of the trilinear Higgs couplings (THCs), $\\lambda_{hhh}$ and\n$\\lambda_{hhH}$. The interferences of the resonant $H$-exchange diagram\ninvolving $\\lambda_{hhH}$ and the non-resonant diagrams result in a\ncharacteristic peak-dip (or dip-peak) structure in the $m_{hh}$ distribution.\nWe analyze how $\\lambda_{hhH}$ can be accessed, taking into account the\nexperimental smearing and binning.

    "abstract": "Anomaly detection based on 3D point cloud data is an important research\nproblem and receives more and more attention recently. Untrained anomaly\ndetection based on only one sample is an emerging research problem motivated by\nreal manufacturing industries such as personalized manufacturing where only one\nsample can be collected without any additional labels and historical datasets.\nIdentifying anomalies accurately based on one 3D point cloud sample is a\ncritical challenge in both industrial applications and the field of machine\nlearning. This paper aims to provide a formal definition of the untrained\nanomaly detection problem based on 3D point cloud data, discuss the differences\nbetween untrained anomaly detection and current unsupervised anomaly detection\nproblems. Unlike trained unsupervised learning, untrained unsupervised learning\ndoes not rely on any data, including unlabeled data. Instead, they leverage\nprior knowledge about the surfaces and anomalies.\n  We propose three complementary methodological frameworks: the Latent Variable\nInference Framework that employs probabilistic modeling to distinguish\nanomalies; the Decomposition Framework that separates point clouds into\nreference, anomaly, and noise components through sparse learning; and the Local\nGeometry Framework that leverages neighborhood information for anomaly\nidentification. Experimental results demonstrate that untrained methods achieve\ncompetitive detection performance while offering significant computational\nadvantages, demonstrating up to a 15-fold increase in execution speed.

    "abstract": "Wigner's Friend scenarios push the boundaries of quantum theory by modeling\nagents, along with their memories storing measurement outcomes, as physical\nquantum systems. Extending these ideas beyond quantum theory, we ask: in which\nphysical theories, and under what assumptions, can agents who are reasoning\nlogically about each other's measurement outcomes encounter apparent paradoxes?\nTo address this, we prove a link between Wigner's Friend type multi-agent\nparadoxes and contextuality in general theories: if agents who are modeled\nwithin a physical theory come to a contradiction when reasoning using that\ntheory (under certain assumptions on how they reason and describe\nmeasurements), then the theory must admit contextual correlations of a logical\nform. This also yields a link between the distinct fundamental concepts of\nHeisenberg cuts and measurement contexts in general theories, and in\nparticular, implies that the quantum Frauchiger-Renner paradox is a proof of\nlogical contextuality. Moreover, we identify structural properties of such\nparadoxes in general theories and specific to quantum theory. For instance, we\ndemonstrate that theories admitting behaviors corresponding to extremal\nvertices of n-cycle contextuality scenarios admit Wigner's Friend type\nparadoxes without post-selection, and that any quantum Wigner's Friend paradox\nbased on the n-cycle scenario must necessarily involve post-selection. Further,\nwe construct a multi-agent paradox based on a genuine contextuality scenario\ninvolving sequential measurements on a single system, showing that Bell\nnon-local correlations between distinct subsystems are not necessary for\nWigner's Friend paradoxes. Our work offers an approach to investigate the\nstructure of physical theories and their information-theoretic resources by\nmeans of deconstructing the assumptions underlying multi-agent physical\nparadoxes.",

To counteract an attacker transmitting all the adversarial\nsignals from a single antenna, we exploit carrier phase-based observations\ncoupled with a low-end inertial sensor to identify spoofing and meaconing.

    "abstract": "To safeguard Civilian Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) external\ninformation available to the platform encompassing the GNSS receiver can be\nused to detect attacks. Cross-checking the GNSS-provided time against\nalternative multiple trusted time sources can lead to attack detection aiming\nat controlling the GNSS receiver time. Leveraging external, network-connected\nsecure time providers and onboard clock references, we achieve detection even\nunder fine-grained time attacks. We provide an extensive evaluation of our\nmulti-layered defense against adversaries mounting attacks against the GNSS\nreceiver along with controlling the network link. We implement adversaries\nspanning from simplistic spoofers to advanced ones synchronized with the GNSS\nconstellation. We demonstrate attack detection is possible in all tested cases\n(sharp discontinuity, smooth take-over, and coordinated network manipulation)\nwithout changes to the structure of the GNSS receiver. Leveraging the diversity\nof the reference time sources, detection of take-over time push as low as 150us\nis possible. Smooth take-overs forcing variations as low as 30ns are also\ndetected based on on-board precision oscillators. The method (and thus the\nevaluation) is largely agnostic to the satellite constellation and the attacker\ntype, making time-based data validation of GNSS information compatible with\nexisting receivers and readily deployable.",

    "abstract": "This paper develops procedures to combine clusters for the approximate\nrandomization test proposed by Canay, Romano, and Shaikh (2017). Their test can\nbe used to conduct inference with a small number of clusters and imposes weak\nrequirements on the correlation structure. However, their test requires the\ntarget parameter to be identified within each cluster. A leading example where\nthis requirement fails to hold is when a variable has no variation within\nclusters. For instance, this happens in difference-in-differences designs\nbecause the treatment variable equals zero in the control clusters. Under this\nscenario, combining control and treated clusters can solve the identification\nproblem, and the test remains valid. However, there is an arbitrariness in how\nthe clusters are combined. In this paper, I develop computationally efficient\nprocedures to combine clusters when this identification requirement does not\nhold. Clusters are combined to maximize local asymptotic power. The simulation\nstudy and empirical application show that the procedures to combine clusters\nperform well in various settings.",

    "abstract": "Musical score following is the real-time mapping of a performance to\ncorresponding locations in a musical score. Score following can be used in a\nvariety of applications including automatic page turning and real-time\naccompaniment. This report presents a novel approach for score following\nmotivated by Wilson and Adams's 2013 paper, which introduces Spectral Mixture\n(SM) kernels for Gaussian Process (GP) regression. Since the SM kernel is\nderived from a Mixture of Gaussians in the frequency domain, it is particularly\nsuitable for modelling the superposed power spectra of musical notes, in which\nenergy is concentrated at multiples of the fundamental frequency of each note.\nOur score follower begins by using a GP to statistically infer the musical\nnotes played during 800-sample 'audioframes' (~18 ms) of solo piano music.\nThese predictions are then used in a duration-dependent Hidden Markov Model to\npredict the most likely score positions in real time. Our two-stage approach\nachieves successful score following not only on four-part hymns arranged for\nkeyboard, but also on pieces for the violin, oboe, and flute. This showcases\nthe powerful and flexible nature of GPs for statistical inference on musical\naudio signals. Given the success of this project, we contribute to the\nliterature a first proof of concept of the application of GPs in score\nfollowing, and more broadly, in online Music Information Retrieval (MIR) tasks.\nThis project also contributes a working score follower product that renders\nscore position in real time using an adapted open-source user interface. Areas\nfor future work include improving accuracy on repeated notes and during heavy\nuse of sustain pedal, adapting to minor deviations from the score, and\nmodelling multi-instrument works.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs), such as o1 from OpenAI, have demonstrated\nremarkable reasoning capabilities. o1 generates a long chain-of-thought\n(LongCoT) before answering a question. LongCoT allows LLMs to analyze problems,\ndevise plans, reflect, and backtrack effectively. These actions empower LLM to\nsolve complex problems. After the release of o1, many teams have attempted to\nreplicate its LongCoT and reasoning capabilities. In terms of methods, they\nprimarily rely on knowledge distillation with data from existing models with\nLongCoT capacities (e.g., OpenAI-o1, Qwen-QwQ, DeepSeek-R1-Preview), leaving\nsignificant uncertainties on systematically developing such reasoning\nabilities. In terms of data domains, these works focus narrowly on math while a\nfew others include coding, limiting their generalizability. This paper\nintroduces a novel approach to enable LLM's LongCoT capacity without\ndistillation from o1-like models or expensive human annotations, where we\nbootstrap LongCoT (BOLT) from a standard instruct model. BOLT involves three\nstages: 1) LongCoT data bootstrapping with in-context learning on a standard\ninstruct model; 2) LongCoT supervised finetuning; 3) online training to further\nrefine LongCoT capacities. In BOLT, only a few in-context examples need to be\nconstructed during the bootstrapping stage; in our experiments, we created 10\nexamples, demonstrating the feasibility of this approach. We use\nLlama-3.1-70B-Instruct to bootstrap LongCoT and apply our method to various\nmodel scales (7B, 8B, 70B). We achieve impressive performance on a variety of\nbenchmarks, Arena-Hard, MT-Bench, WildBench, ZebraLogic, MATH500, which\nevaluate diverse task-solving and reasoning capabilities.",

    "abstract": "While the sources of the diffuse astrophysical neutrino flux detected by the\nIceCube Neutrino Observatory are still largely unknown, one of the promising\nmethods used towards understanding this is investigating the potential temporal\nand spatial correlations between neutrino alerts and the electromagnetic\nradiation from blazars. We report on the multiwavelength target-of-opportunity\nobservations of the blazar B3 2247+381, taken in response to an IceCube\nmultiplet alert for a cluster of muon neutrino events compatible with the\nsource location between May 20, 2022 and November 10, 2022. B3 2247+381 was not\ndetected with VERITAS during this time period. The source was found to be in a\nlow-flux state in the optical, ultraviolet and gamma-ray bands for the time\ninterval corresponding to the neutrino event, but was detected in the hard\nX-ray band with NuSTAR during this period. We find the multiwavelength spectral\nenergy distribution is well described using a simple one-zone leptonic\nsynchrotron self-Compton radiation model. Moreover, assuming the neutrinos\noriginate from hadronic processes within the jet, the neutrino flux would be\naccompanied by a photon flux from the cascade emission, and the integrated\nphoton flux required in such a case would significantly exceed the total\nmultiwavelength fluxes and the VERITAS upper limits presented here. The lack of\nflaring activity observed with VERITAS, combined with the low multiwavelength\nflux levels, and given the significance of the neutrino excess is at 3$\\sigma$\nlevel (uncorrected for trials), makes B3 2247+381 an unlikely source of the\nIceCube multiplet. We conclude that the neutrino excess is likely a background\nfluctuation.",

    "abstract": "In object detection, the instance count is typically used to define whether a\ndataset exhibits a long-tail distribution, implicitly assuming that models will\nunderperform on categories with fewer instances. This assumption has led to\nextensive research on category bias in datasets with imbalanced instance\ncounts. However, models still exhibit category bias even in datasets where\ninstance counts are relatively balanced, clearly indicating that instance count\nalone cannot explain this phenomenon. In this work, we first introduce the\nconcept and measurement of category information amount. We observe a\nsignificant negative correlation between category information amount and\naccuracy, suggesting that category information amount more accurately reflects\nthe learning difficulty of a category. Based on this observation, we propose\nInformation Amount-Guided Angular Margin (IGAM) Loss. The core idea of IGAM is\nto dynamically adjust the decision space of each category based on its\ninformation amount, thereby reducing category bias in long-tail datasets. IGAM\nLoss not only performs well on long-tailed benchmark datasets such as LVIS v1.0\nand COCO-LT but also shows significant improvement for underrepresented\ncategories in the non-long-tailed dataset Pascal VOC. Comprehensive experiments\ndemonstrate the potential of category information amount as a tool and the\ngenerality of our proposed method.",

    "abstract": "Despite incredible progress, many neural architectures fail to properly\ngeneralize beyond their training distribution. As such, learning to reason in a\ncorrect and generalizable way is one of the current fundamental challenges in\nmachine learning. In this respect, logic puzzles provide a great testbed, as we\ncan fully understand and control the learning environment. Thus, they allow to\nevaluate performance on previously unseen, larger and more difficult puzzles\nthat follow the same underlying rules. Since traditional approaches often\nstruggle to represent such scalable logical structures, we propose to model\nthese puzzles using a graph-based approach. Then, we investigate the key\nfactors enabling the proposed models to learn generalizable solutions in a\nreinforcement learning setting. Our study focuses on the impact of the\ninductive bias of the architecture, different reward systems and the role of\nrecurrent modeling in enabling sequential reasoning. Through extensive\nexperiments, we demonstrate how these elements contribute to successful\nextrapolation on increasingly complex puzzles.These insights and frameworks\noffer a systematic way to design learning-based systems capable of\ngeneralizable reasoning beyond interpolation.",

We will\nreview here the physical origins of the frustration concept and review evidence\nthat local frustration is important for protein physiology, protein-protein\nrecognition, catalysis and allostery.

    "abstract": "Advancements in emerging technologies, e.g., reconfigurable intelligent\nsurfaces and holographic MIMO (HMIMO), facilitate unprecedented manipulation of\nelectromagnetic (EM) waves, significantly enhancing the performance of wireless\ncommunication systems. To accurately characterize the achievable performance\nlimits of these systems, it is crucial to develop a universal EM-compliant\nchannel model. This paper addresses this necessity by proposing a comprehensive\nEM channel model tailored for realistic multi-path environments, accounting for\nthe combined effects of antenna array configurations and propagation conditions\nin HMIMO communications. Both polarization phenomena and spatial correlation\nare incorporated into this probabilistic channel model. Additionally, physical\nconstraints of antenna configurations, such as mutual coupling effects and\nenergy consumption, are integrated into the channel modeling framework.\nSimulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed probabilistic\nchannel model, indicating that traditional Rician and Rayleigh fading models\ncannot accurately depict the channel characteristics and underestimate the\nchannel capacity. More importantly, the proposed channel model outperforms\nfree-space Green's functions in accurately depicting both near-field gain and\nmulti-path effects in radiative near-field regions. These gains are much more\nevident in tri-polarized systems, highlighting the necessity of polarization\ninterference elimination techniques. Moreover, the theoretical analysis\naccurately verifies that capacity decreases with expanding communication\nregions of two-user communications.",

    "abstract": "Single-domain generalization for object detection (S-DGOD) seeks to transfer\nlearned representations from a single source domain to unseen target domains.\nWhile recent approaches have primarily focused on achieving feature invariance,\nthey ignore that domain diversity also presents significant challenges for the\ntask. First, such invariance-driven strategies often lead to the loss of\ndomain-specific information, resulting in incomplete feature representations.\nSecond, cross-domain feature alignment forces the model to overlook\ndomain-specific discrepancies, thereby increasing the complexity of the\ntraining process. To address these limitations, this paper proposes the\nDiversity Invariant Detection Model (DIDM), which achieves a harmonious\nintegration of domain-specific diversity and domain invariance. Our key idea is\nto learn the invariant representations by keeping the inherent domain-specific\nfeatures. Specifically, we introduce the Diversity Learning Module (DLM). This\nmodule limits the invariant semantics while explicitly enhancing\ndomain-specific feature representation through a proposed feature diversity\nloss. Furthermore, to ensure cross-domain invariance without sacrificing\ndiversity, we incorporate the Weighted Aligning Module (WAM) to enable feature\nalignment while maintaining the discriminative domain-specific information.\nExtensive experiments on multiple diverse datasets demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed model, achieving superior performance compared to\nexisting methods.",

    "abstract": "Luminous Infrared Galaxies (LIRGs) play a crucial role in understanding of\ngalaxy evolution. The present study examined 82 LIRGs, using data taken from\nthe Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database (NED),\nand HyperLEDA to explore their gas fractions and optical properties. The\nanalysis of data highlights the relationship between molecular-to-atomic mass\nof hydrogen gas ratio MH2/MH1 and morphological types, gas mass fractions, and\ngalaxy characteristics such as color and luminosity. The results showed that\nthe regressions between Mdust - M*,V and Mdust - SFR are not quite flat (when\ncorrelation coefficient > 0.5), which indicates a decrease in the\ndust-to-stellar content ratio as the gas is consumed and transformed into\nstars, and also a relatively flat trend for M dust - M*,V and fdust,bar - M*,V.\nMoreover, as the star mass declines, the total gas mass fraction (fgas)\nincreases quickly, with a high negative correlation coefficient of - 0.7 and a\nregression of - 0.85. Therefore, it can be inferred that galaxies with a high\ngas fraction (fgas) are either accreting gas at a rate sufficient to meet their\nenergy requirements for star formation or converting gas into stars less\neffectively. According to the findings, the gas exhaustion time in these\ngalaxies quickly reduces as the stellar mass increases, with a significant\nnegative correlation coefficient of - 0.7 and a regression that is a nearly\nlinear regression of - 0.9. On the other hand, when the baryonic gas mass\nfraction grows, which makes up the majority of the baryonic gas, grows, the gas\ndepletion time increases quickly.",

    "abstract": "We investigate properties of the emission region as revealed by drifting\nsubpulses of opposite drift directions at different parts of a pulse profile by\nusing the rotating carousel model in an obliquely rotating pulsar magnetosphere\nof multiple emission states. Subpulse emission is assumed coming from m\ndiscrete emission areas that are distributed around the magnetic axis on a\nrotating carousel. The flow rate of the emission areas is determined by the E x\nB drift in an emission state, designated by the parameter y, in which E and the\nassociated flow rate are dependent on y. In this model, subpulses appear to\ndrift in an emission state if a relative speed exists between the plasma flow\nand corotation, and the diversity in the drift rates and directions corresponds\nto the relative speed being different in different parts of a profile. We apply\nthe model to three pulsars that exhibit drifting subpulses of opposite drift\ndirections to identify the emission states and the values of m. Our results\nshow that different drifting subpulses correspond to particular values of m and\ny, and the latter implies that different emission states can coexist and\noperate concurrently in an emission region. We find that m does not show clear\ndependency on either the obliquity angle or emission state. We demonstrate that\nsubpulse arrangement may vary across an emission region meaning that it is not\nalways uniform on a carousel. We discuss drifting subpulses of opposite drift\ndirections and subpulse drift-rate switching in terms of different emission\nstates in our model, and speculate that they may be two manifestations of the\nsame underlying mechanism.",

To be specific,\nwe study a lattice model in which the magnetic configuration is determined by\nthe competition among ferromagnetic (FM) interaction, the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya\ninteraction, and the Kondo coupling $K_0$ to the Weyl fermion. Both quantum and\nfinite-temperature phase transitions between FM and correlated nesting helical\nconfigurations are found. Different from the uncorrelated helimagnet that\ndecouples from the Weyl fermions, this correlated helimagnet induces a magnetic\nBrillouin zone with a $K_0$-dependent nesting in the band structure of the\nconduction electrons instead of the monopole-like Weyl cone. By measuring the\ncurrent induced by the chiral magnetic effect on the conduction electron with\nnesting Weyl nodes, one can distinguish the correlated nesting helical order\nfrom the ferromagnetism because the chiral magnetic effect is considerably\nsuppressed in the former case. These properties we find here may explain the\nexperimental observations in ReAlX.",

As a representative sample of local data, prototypes offer an approach\nwith low resource consumption and no reliance on prior knowledge for MFL with\nmixed modalities. However, existing prototype-based MFL methods assume unified\nlabels across clients and identical tasks per client, which is impractical in\nMFL with mixed modalities. In this work, we propose an Adaptive prototype-based\nMultimodal Federated Learning (AproMFL) framework for mixed modalities to\naddress the aforementioned issues. Our AproMFL transfers knowledge through\nadaptively-constructed prototypes without unified labels. Clients adaptively\nselect prototype construction methods in line with labels; server converts\nclient prototypes into unified multimodal prototypes and cluster them to form\nglobal prototypes. To address model aggregation issues in task heterogeneity,\nwe develop a client relationship graph-based scheme to dynamically adjust\naggregation weights. Furthermore, we propose a global prototype knowledge\ntransfer loss and a global model knowledge transfer loss to enable the transfer\nof global knowledge to local knowledge. Experimental results show that AproMFL\noutperforms four baselines on three highly heterogeneous datasets\n($\\alpha=0.1$) and two heterogeneous tasks, with the optimal results in\naccuracy and recall being 0.42%~6.09% and 1.6%~3.89% higher than those of\nFedIoT (FedAvg-based MFL), respectively.",

    "abstract": "Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) including foundation models (FMs),\nare increasingly transforming human society, with smart city driving the\nevolution of urban living.Meanwhile, vehicle crowdsensing (VCS) has emerged as\na key enabler, leveraging vehicles' mobility and sensor-equipped capabilities.\nIn particular, ride-hailing vehicles can effectively facilitate flexible data\ncollection and contribute towards urban intelligence, despite resource\nlimitations. Therefore, this work explores a promising scenario, where\nedge-assisted vehicles perform joint tasks of order serving and the emerging\nfoundation model fine-tuning using various urban data. However, integrating the\nVCS AI task with the conventional order serving task is challenging, due to\ntheir inconsistent spatio-temporal characteristics: (i) The distributions of\nride orders and data point-of-interests (PoIs) may not coincide in geography,\nboth following a priori unknown patterns; (ii) they have distinct forms of\ntemporal effects, i.e., prolonged waiting makes orders become instantly invalid\nwhile data with increased staleness gradually reduces its utility for model\nfine-tuning.To overcome these obstacles, we propose an online framework based\non multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) with careful augmentation. A new\nquality-of-service (QoS) metric is designed to characterize and balance the\nutility of the two joint tasks, under the effects of varying data volumes and\nstaleness. We also integrate graph neural networks (GNNs) with MARL to enhance\nstate representations, capturing graph-structured, time-varying dependencies\namong vehicles and across locations. Extensive experiments on our testbed\nsimulator, utilizing various real-world foundation model fine-tuning tasks and\nthe New York City Taxi ride order dataset, demonstrate the advantage of our\nproposed method.",

    "abstract": "The proliferation of Text-to-Image (T2I) models has revolutionized content\ncreation, providing powerful tools for diverse applications ranging from\nartistic expression to educational material development and marketing. Despite\nthese technological advancements, significant ethical concerns arise from these\nmodels' reliance on large-scale datasets that often contain inherent societal\nbiases. These biases are further amplified when AI-generated content is\nincluded in training data, potentially reinforcing and perpetuating stereotypes\nin the generated outputs. In this paper, we introduce FairT2I, a novel\nframework that harnesses large language models to detect and mitigate social\nbiases in T2I generation. Our framework comprises two key components: (1) an\nLLM-based bias detection module that identifies potential social biases in\ngenerated images based on text prompts, and (2) an attribute rebalancing module\nthat fine-tunes sensitive attributes within the T2I model to mitigate\nidentified biases. Our extensive experiments across various T2I models and\ndatasets show that FairT2I can significantly reduce bias while maintaining\nhigh-quality image generation. We conducted both qualitative user studies and\nquantitative non-parametric analyses in the generated image feature space,\nbuilding upon the occupational dataset introduced in the Stable Bias study. Our\nresults show that FairT2I successfully mitigates social biases and enhances the\ndiversity of sensitive attributes in generated images. We further demonstrate,\nusing the P2 dataset, that our framework can detect subtle biases that are\nchallenging for human observers to perceive, extending beyond\noccupation-related prompts.

To quantify the effect of synthetic data\ncontamination, we train U-Net models on progressively \"poisoned\" datasets,\nwhere synthetic data proportions range from 16.67% to 83.33%. Experimental\nresults on a real MRI validation set reveal a significant performance\ndegradation as synthetic data increases, with Dice coefficients dropping from\n0.8937 (33.33% synthetic) to 0.7474 (83.33% synthetic). Accuracy and\nsensitivity exhibit similar downward trends, demonstrating the detrimental\neffect of synthetic data on segmentation robustness.

    "abstract": "LLMs have boosted progress in many AI applications. Recently, there were\nattempts to distill the vast knowledge of LLMs into information retrieval\nsystems. Those distillation methods mostly use output probabilities of LLMs\nwhich are unavailable in the latest black-box LLMs. We propose Syntriever, a\ntraining framework for retrievers using synthetic data from black-box LLMs.\nSyntriever consists of two stages. Firstly in the distillation stage, we\nsynthesize relevant and plausibly irrelevant passages and augmented queries\nusing chain-of-thoughts for the given queries. LLM is asked to self-verify the\nsynthetic data for possible hallucinations, after which retrievers are trained\nwith a loss designed to cluster the embeddings of relevant passages. Secondly\nin the alignment stage, we align the retriever with the preferences of LLMs. We\npropose a preference modeling called partial Plackett-Luce ranking to learn LLM\npreferences with regularization which prevents the model from deviating\nexcessively from that trained in the distillation stage. Experiments show that\nSyntriever achieves state-of-the-art performances on benchmark datasets from\nvarious domains in nDCG@$K$.

The electromagnetic particle-in-cell\nmethod with the finite-difference time-domain solver plus Monte Carlo collision\nmodel would be the most accurate method to simulate the wave-plasma\ninteraction.

Furthermore, the\neffects of electromagnetic wave frequency, the plasma distribution structures,\nand collision types on wave attenuation are investigated.

The\npre-trained Stable Diffusion (SD) models are helpful for image deblurring by\nproviding clear image priors. However, directly using a blurry image or\npre-deblurred one as a conditional control for SD will either hinder accurate\nstructure extraction or make the results overly dependent on the deblurring\nnetwork. In this work, we propose a Latent Kernel Prediction Network (LKPN) to\nachieve robust real-world image deblurring. Specifically, we co-train the LKPN\nin latent space with conditional diffusion. The LKPN learns a spatially variant\nkernel to guide the restoration of sharp images in the latent space. By\napplying element-wise adaptive convolution (EAC), the learned kernel is\nutilized to adaptively process the input feature, effectively preserving the\nstructural information of the input. This process thereby more effectively\nguides the generative process of Stable Diffusion (SD), enhancing both the\ndeblurring efficacy and the quality of detail reconstruction. Moreover, the\nresults at each diffusion step are utilized to iteratively estimate the kernels\nin LKPN to better restore the sharp latent by EAC. This iterative refinement\nenhances the accuracy and robustness of the deblurring process.

Quantum annealing, a\nspecialized approach within quantum computing, is particularly effective for\noptimization tasks, as it leverages quantum tunneling to escape local minima\nand efficiently explore complex energy landscapes. In geosciences, many\nproblems are framed as high-dimensional optimization problems, including\nseismic inversion, which aims to estimate subsurface impedances from seismic\ndata for accurate geological interpretation and resource exploration. This\nstudy presents a novel application of quantum computing for seismic inversion,\nmarking the first instance of inverting seismic data to estimate both P-wave\nand S-wave impedances using a quantum annealer. Building upon our prior work,\nwhich demonstrated the estimation of acoustic impedances from post-stack data\nusing a two-step framework, we propose an enhanced workflow capable of\ninverting both post-stack and pre-stack seismic data in a single step. This\nadvancement significantly reduces the number of qubits per model parameter\n(from 20 to 5) while improving computational speed (from 20 seconds to 6.3\nseconds). The seismic inversion is implemented using the D-Wave Leap hybrid\nsolver, achieving impedance estimation within 4-9 seconds, with the quantum\nprocessing unit (QPU) contributing just 0.043-0.085 seconds.

Effectively detecting hallucinations is\ntherefore crucial for the safe deployment of LLMs. Recent research has linked\nhallucinations to model uncertainty, suggesting that hallucinations can be\ndetected by measuring dispersion over answer distributions obtained from a set\nof samples drawn from a model. While drawing from the distribution over tokens\ndefined by the model is a natural way to obtain samples, in this work, we argue\nthat it is sub-optimal for the purpose of detecting hallucinations. We show\nthat detection can be improved significantly by taking into account model\nuncertainty in the Bayesian sense.

To address\nthis, we propose \\method, a novel multimodal framework that leverages\npre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to bridge temporal, visual, and\ntextual modalities for enhanced forecasting. Our framework comprises three key\ncomponents: (1) a Retrieval-Augmented Learner, which extracts enriched temporal\nfeatures through memory bank interactions; (2) a Vision-Augmented Learner,\nwhich encodes time series as informative images; and (3) a Text-Augmented\nLearner, which generates contextual textual descriptions. These components\ncollaborate with frozen pre-trained VLMs to produce multimodal embeddings,\nwhich are then fused with temporal features for final prediction.

    "abstract": "Network-wide traffic flow, which captures dynamic traffic volume on each link\nof a general network, is fundamental to smart mobility applications. However,\nthe observed traffic flow from sensors is usually limited across the entire\nnetwork due to the associated high installation and maintenance costs. To\naddress this issue, existing research uses various supplementary data sources\nto compensate for insufficient sensor coverage and estimate the unobserved\ntraffic flow. Although these studies have shown promising results, the\ninconsistent availability and quality of supplementary data across cities make\ntheir methods typically face a trade-off challenge between accuracy and\ngenerality. In this research, we first time advocate using the Global Open\nMulti-Source (GOMS) data within an advanced deep learning framework to break\nthe trade-off. The GOMS data primarily encompass geographical and demographic\ninformation, including road topology, building footprints, and population\ndensity, which can be consistently collected across cities. More importantly,\nthese GOMS data are either causes or consequences of transportation activities,\nthereby creating opportunities for accurate network-wide flow estimation.\nFurthermore, we use map images to represent GOMS data, instead of traditional\ntabular formats, to capture richer and more comprehensive geographical and\ndemographic information. To address multi-source data fusion, we develop an\nattention-based graph neural network that effectively extracts and synthesizes\ninformation from GOMS maps while simultaneously capturing spatiotemporal\ntraffic dynamics from observed traffic data. A large-scale case study across 15\ncities in Europe and North America was conducted. The results demonstrate\nstable and satisfactory estimation accuracy across these cities, which suggests\nthat the trade-off challenge can be successfully addressed using our approach.",

As HPC advances toward\nheterogeneous computing, integrating diverse GPU workloads on heterogeneous\nCPU-GPU systems, it is crucial to revisit and enhance uncore scaling. Our\ninvestigation reveals that uncore frequency scales down only when CPU power\napproaches its TDP (Thermal Design Power), an uncommon scenario in GPU-dominant\napplications, resulting in unnecessary power waste in modern heterogeneous\ncomputing systems. To address this, we present MAGUS, a user-transparent uncore\nfrequency scaling runtime for heterogeneous computing. Effective uncore tuning\nis inherently complex, requiring dynamic detection of application execution\nphases that affect uncore utilization. Moreover, any robust strategy must work\nacross a diverse range of applications, each with unique behaviors and resource\nrequirements. Finally, an efficient runtime should introduce minimal overhead.\nWe incorporate several key techniques in the design of MAGUS, including\nmonitoring and predicting memory throughput, managing frequent phase\ntransitions, and leveraging vendor-supplied power management support. We\nevaluate MAGUS using a diverse set of GPU benchmarks and applications across\nmultiple heterogeneous systems with different CPU and GPU architectures.

In this article, we propose a more rigorous and robust method of\nrestoring pruned networks in a fine-tuning free and data-free manner, called\nLBYL (Leave Before You Leave). LBYL significantly relaxes the aforementioned\nassumption in a way that each pruned neuron leaves its pieces of information to\nas many preserved neurons as possible and thereby multiple neurons together\nobtain a more robust approximation to the original output of the neuron who\njust left. Our method is based on a theoretical analysis on how to formulate\nthe reconstruction error between the original network and its approximation,\nwhich nicely leads to a closed form solution for our derived loss function.\nThrough the extensive experiments, LBYL is confirmed to be indeed more\neffective to approximate the original network and consequently able to achieve\nhigher accuracy for restored networks, compared to the recent approaches\nexploiting the similarity between two neurons.

To address this issue, we investigate TTA within multi-label scenario\n(ML--TTA), developing Bound Entropy Minimization (BEM) objective to\nsimultaneously increase the confidence of multiple top predicted labels.\nSpecifically, to determine the number of labels for each augmented view, we\nretrieve a paired caption with yielded textual labels for that view.

Following this, the proposed BEM\nconsiders the highest top-k predicted labels from view and caption as a single\nentity, respectively, learning both view and caption prompts concurrently. By\nbinding top-k predicted labels, BEM overcomes the limitation of vanilla entropy\nminimization, which exclusively optimizes the most confident class.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved significantly advanced\ncapabilities in understanding and generating human language text, which have\ngained increasing popularity over recent years. Apart from their\nstate-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) performance, considering\ntheir widespread usage in many industries, including medicine, finance,\neducation, etc., security concerns over their usage grow simultaneously. In\nrecent years, the evolution of backdoor attacks has progressed with the\nadvancement of defense mechanisms against them and more well-developed features\nin the LLMs. In this paper, we adapt the general taxonomy for classifying\nmachine learning attacks on one of the subdivisions - training-time white-box\nbackdoor attacks. Besides systematically classifying attack methods, we also\nconsider the corresponding defense methods against backdoor attacks. By\nproviding an extensive summary of existing works, we hope this survey can serve\nas a guideline for inspiring future research that further extends the attack\nscenarios and creates a stronger defense against them for more robust LLMs.",

    "abstract": "Despite the much proliferation of AI ethical principles in recent years,\nthere is a challenge of assuring AI ethics with current AI ethics frameworks in\nreal-world applications. While system safety has emerged as a distinct\ndiscipline for a long time, originated from safety concerns in early aircraft\nmanufacturing. The safety assurance is now an indispensable component in safety\ncritical domains. Motivated by the assurance approaches for safety-critical\nsystems such as aviation, this paper introduces the concept of AI ethics\nassurance cases into the AI ethics assurance. Three pillars of user\nrequirements, evidence, and validation are proposed as key components and\nintegrated into AI ethics assurance cases for a new approach of user\nrequirements-oriented AI ethics assurance. The user requirements-oriented AI\nethics assurance case is set up based on three pillars and hazard analysis\nmethods used in the safety assurance of safety-critical systems. This paper\nalso proposes a platform named Ethical-Lens (E-LENS) to implement the user\nrequirements-oriented AI ethics assurance approach. The proposed user\nrequirements-based E-LENS platform is then applied to assure AI ethics of an\nAI-driven human resource shortlisting system as a case study to show the\neffectiveness of the proposed approach.",

The SC-LDPC codes are constructed by treating the\nirregular graph corresponding to the parity-check matrix of a systematic rate R\n= (n - 1)/n CSOC as a convolutional protograph. The protograph can then be\nlifted using permutation matrices to generate a high-rate SC-LDPC code whose\nstrength depends on the lifting factor. The SC-LDPC codes constructed in this\nfashion can be decoded using iterative belief propagation (BP) based sliding\nwindow decoding (SWD).\n  A non-systematic version of a CSOC parity-check matrix is then proposed by\nmaking a slight modification to the systematic construction. The non-systematic\nparity-check matrix corresponds to a regular protograph whose degree profile\ndepends on the rate and error-correcting capability of the underlying CSOC.\nEven though the parity-check matrix is in non-systematic form, we show how\nsystematic encoding can still be performed. We also show that the\nnon-systematic convolutional protograph has a guaranteed girth and free\ndistance and that these properties carry over to the lifted versions.\n  Finally, numerical results are included demonstrating that CSOC-based SC-LDPC\ncodes (i) achieve excellent performance at very high rates, (ii) have\nperformance at least as good as that of SC-LDPC codes constructed from\nconvolutional protographs commonly found in the literature, and (iii) have\niterative decoding thresholds comparable to those of existing SC-LDPC code\ndesigns.",

Our study presents four\nnovelties: We harness the summarizing capabilities of LLMs to identify and\ndistill key Cognitive-Linguistic information from noisy speech transcripts,\neffectively filtering irrelevant information. We leverage the inherent\nlinguistic knowledge of LLMs to extract linguistic markers from unstructured\nand heterogeneous audio transcripts. We exploit the compositional ability of\nLLMs to generate AD speech transcripts consisting of diverse linguistic\npatterns to overcome the speech data scarcity challenge and enhance the\nrobustness of AD detection models.

Therefore, this RR Lyrae is the first variable star identified to be\nassociated with Aquarius III, despite its projected distance is more than 15\ntimes the half-light radius of Aquarius III. On the other hand, a dedicated\ntime-series monitoring of the central part of Aquarius III, out to a projected\nradius of approximately four half-light radius, revealed there is no RR Lyrae\nin this region. We ran a set of synthetic color-magnitude diagrams with\nproperties similar to Aquarius III, and found a non-negligible probability that\nAquarius III could have (at least one) RR Lyrae.

In this work, it is\nassumed that the reward is expressed as a reward machine whose transitions\ndepend on atomic propositions associated with the state of a Markov Decision\nProcess (MDP). Our goal is to identify the true reward machine using finite\ninformation. To this end, we first introduce the notion of a prefix tree policy\nwhich associates a distribution of actions to each state of the MDP and each\nattainable finite sequence of atomic propositions. Then, we characterize an\nequivalence class of reward machines that can be identified given the prefix\ntree policy. Finally, we propose a SAT-based algorithm that uses information\nextracted from the prefix tree policy to solve for a reward machine. It is\nproved that if the prefix tree policy is known up to a sufficient (but finite)\ndepth, our algorithm recovers the exact reward machine up to the equivalence\nclass. This sufficient depth is derived as a function of the number of MDP\nstates and (an upper bound on) the number of states of the reward machine.\nThese results are further extended to the case where we only have access to\ndemonstrations from an optimal policy.

RuO$_2$ has been considered a\nprototypical metallic altermagnet with a critical temperature higher than room\ntemperature. Previous interpretations of the unusual magnetic properties of\nRuO$_2$ relied on the theoretical prediction that local moments on two Ru\nsublattices, which are connected by four-fold rotational symmetry, are quite\nsignificant (approximately 1 $\\mu_B$), leading to long-range antiferromagnetic\norder. However, accumulated experimental data suggest that local moments on Ru\nin RuO$_2$ are vanishingly small, indicating that the bulk material is likely\nnon-magnetic. This observation is consistent with the delocalized nature of the\n4$d$ electrons of Ru and the strong screening effect in the metallic state. In\nthis work, we show that despite the non-magnetic bulk, the RuO$_2$(110) surface\nexhibits spontaneous magnetization. We attribute this effect to the breaking of\nlocal symmetry, which results in electronic redistribution and magnetic moment\nenhancement. The emergence of surface magnetism gives rise to interesting\nspectroscopic phenomena, including spin-polarized surface states,\nspin-polarized scanning probe microscopy images, and potentially spin-dependent\ntransport effects. These findings highlight the important role of surface\nmagnetic structures in the otherwise non-magnetic bulk RuO$_2$.",

    "abstract": "Identifying the extent of brain tumors is a significant challenge in brain\ncancer treatment. The main difficulty is in the approximate detection of tumor\nsize. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become a critical diagnostic tool.\nHowever, manually detecting the boundaries of brain tumors from MRI scans is a\nlabor-intensive task that requires extensive expertise. Deep learning and\ncomputer-aided detection techniques have led to notable advances in machine\nlearning for this purpose. In this paper, we propose a modified You Only Look\nOnce (YOLOv8) model to accurately detect the tumors within the MRI images. The\nproposed model replaced the Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) algorithm with a\nReal-Time Detection Transformer (RT- DETR) in the detection head. NMS filters\nout redundant or overlapping bounding boxes in the detected tumors, but they\nare hand-designed and pre-set. RT-DETR removes hand-designed components. The\nsecond improvement was made by replacing the normal convolution block with\nghost convolution. Ghost Convolution reduces computational and memory costs\nwhile maintaining high accuracy and enabling faster inference, making it ideal\nfor resource-constrained environments and real-time applications. The third\nimprovement was made by introducing a vision transformer block in the backbone\nof YOLOv8 to extract context-aware features. We used a publicly available\ndataset of brain tumors in the proposed model. The proposed model performed\nbetter than the original YOLOv8 model and also performed better than other\nobject detectors (Faster R- CNN, Mask R-CNN, YOLO, YOLOv3, YOLOv4, YOLOv5, SSD,\nRetinaNet, EfficientDet, and DETR).

We assume a range of BH mass,\nX-ray luminosity ($\\rm L_{X}$) and star formation rate (SFR) to bracket the\nlikely properties of LRDs. Our findings suggest that BH radio fluxes from LRDs\nare 10-100 times higher than the stellar fluxes from their host galaxies,\ndepending on BH mass, $\\rm L_X$ and SFR. The detection of a $\\sim$ 500 nJy\nsignal above 2 GHz at $z \\geq$ 5 or a $\\sim$ 2000 nJy flux at $z =$ 3-4 would\nbe a smoking gun for the presence of AGN provided that SFRs in the host\ngalaxies are $\\rm < 30~ M_{\\odot} ~yr^{-1}$.

Our findings show\nthat though the most energetically favorable bilayer structure retains the\nstacking pattern of the bulk counterpart, three other high-symmetry stacking\nstructures can be achieved by sliding one of the layers along three distinct\ndirections, with energy costs comparable to that observed in MoS$_2$ bilayer.\nAll these four bilayers exhibit semiconductor behavior with A-type\nantiferromagnetic ordering, similar to the bulk material, and demonstrate\nclosely aligned N\\'{e}el temperatures. Moreover, these bilayers exhibit\nrelatively low lattice thermal conductivities, pronounced anisotropy, and a\nstrong dependence on stacking patterns. This behavior is attributed to\nsignificant phonon-phonon scattering arising from avoided crossings between\nacoustic and optical phonons, as well as the presence of flat optical phonon\nbands in the low-frequency region. While the electronic structures and optical\nproperties of these bilayers show weak dependence on the stacking pattern for\nantiferromagnetic ordering, they undergo significant changes for ferromagnetic\nordering, influencing the band gap, valence and conduction band splitting, and\neffective mass.

Although large-scale robot demonstration datasets have shown\npotential for inducing generalization, they are resource-intensive to scale. In\ncontrast, human video data is abundant and diverse, presenting an attractive\nalternative. Yet, these human-video datasets lack action labels, complicating\ntheir use in imitation learning. Existing methods attempt to extract grounded\naction representations (e.g., hand poses), but resulting policies struggle to\nbridge the embodiment gap between human and robot actions. We propose an\nalternative approach: leveraging language-based reasoning from human\nvideos-essential for guiding robot actions-to train generalizable robot\npolicies. Building on recent advances in reasoning-based policy architectures,\nwe introduce Reasoning through Action-free Data (RAD). RAD learns from both\nrobot demonstration data (with reasoning and action labels) and action-free\nhuman video data (with only reasoning labels). The robot data teaches the model\nto map reasoning to low-level actions, while the action-free data enhances\nreasoning capabilities. Additionally, we will release a new dataset of 3,377\nhuman-hand demonstrations with reasoning annotations compatible with the Bridge\nV2 benchmark and aimed at facilitating future research on reasoning-driven\nrobot learning. Our experiments show that RAD enables effective transfer across\nthe embodiment gap, allowing robots to perform tasks seen only in action-free\ndata.

The emergent reasoning ability in large language models offer a\npromising path for next-generation on-device AI agents.

In this paper, we propose Division-of-Thoughts (DoT), a\ncollaborative reasoning framework leveraging the synergy between locally\ndeployed Smaller-scale Language Models (SLMs) and cloud-based LLMs. DoT\nleverages a Task Decomposer to elicit the inherent planning abilities in\nlanguage models to decompose user queries into smaller sub-tasks, which allows\nhybrid language models to fully exploit their respective strengths. Besides,\nDoT employs a Task Scheduler to analyze the pair-wise dependency of sub-tasks\nand create a dependency graph, facilitating parallel reasoning of sub-tasks and\nthe identification of key steps. To allocate the appropriate model based on the\ndifficulty of sub-tasks, DoT leverages a Plug-and-Play Adapter, which is an\nadditional task head attached to the SLM that does not alter the SLM's\nparameters. To boost adapter's task allocation capability, we propose a\nself-reinforced training method that relies solely on task execution feedback.\nExtensive experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate that our DoT\nsignificantly reduces LLM costs while maintaining competitive reasoning\naccuracy.

Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate\nthat our approach achieves faster convergence and higher policy returns\ncompared to state-of-the-art MARL baselines.",

    "abstract": "Action recognition in dark, low-light (under-exposed) or noisy videos is a\nchallenging task due to visibility degradation, which can hinder critical\nspatiotemporal details. This paper proposes MD-BERT, a novel multi-stream\napproach that integrates complementary pre-processing techniques such as gamma\ncorrection and histogram equalization alongside raw dark frames to address\nthese challenges. We introduce the Dynamic Feature Fusion (DFF) module,\nextending existing attentional fusion methods to a three-stream setting,\nthereby capturing fine-grained and global contextual information across\ndifferent brightness and contrast enhancements. The fused spatiotemporal\nfeatures are then processed by a BERT-based temporal model, which leverages its\nbidirectional self-attention to effectively capture long-range dependencies and\ncontextual relationships across frames. Extensive experiments on the ARID V1.0\nand ARID V1.5 dark video datasets show that MD-BERT outperforms existing\nmethods, establishing a new state-of-the-art performance. Ablation studies\nfurther highlight the individual contributions of each input stream and the\neffectiveness of the proposed DFF and BERT modules.

We assume there's a\ntime-invariant representation for the same neuron, reflecting its intrinsic\nproperties like molecular profiles, location, and morphology. The goal of\nobtaining these intrinsic neuronal representations has two criteria: (I)\nsegments from the same neuron should have more similar representations than\nthose from different neurons; (II) the representations must generalize well to\nout-of-domain data. To meet these, we propose the NeurPIR (Neuron Platonic\nIntrinsic Representation) framework. It uses contrastive learning, with\nsegments from the same neuron as positive pairs and those from different\nneurons as negative pairs. In implementation, we use VICReg, which focuses on\npositive pairs and separates dissimilar samples via regularization. We tested\nour method on Izhikevich model-simulated neuronal population dynamics data. The\nresults accurately identified neuron types based on preset hyperparameters. We\nalso applied it to two real-world neuron dynamics datasets with neuron type\nannotations from spatial transcriptomics and neuron locations.

    "abstract": "Price manipulation attack is one of the notorious threats in decentralized\nfinance (DeFi) applications, which allows attackers to exchange tokens at an\nextensively deviated price from the market. Existing efforts usually rely on\nreactive methods to identify such kind of attacks after they have happened,\ne.g., detecting attack transactions in the post-attack stage, which cannot\nmitigate or prevent price manipulation attacks timely. From the perspective of\nattackers, they usually need to deploy attack contracts in the pre-attack\nstage. Thus, if we can identify these attack contracts in a proactive manner,\nwe can raise alarms and mitigate the threats. With the core idea in mind, in\nthis work, we shift our attention from the victims to the attackers.\nSpecifically, we propose SMARTCAT, a novel approach for identifying price\nmanipulation attacks in the pre-attack stage proactively. For generality, it\nconducts analysis on bytecode and does not require any source code and\ntransaction data. For accuracy, it depicts the control- and data-flow\ndependency relationships among function calls into a token flow graph. For\nscalability, it filters out those suspicious paths, in which it conducts\ninter-contract analysis as necessary. To this end, SMARTCAT can pinpoint\nattacks in real time once they have been deployed on a chain. The evaluation\nresults illustrate that SMARTCAT significantly outperforms existing baselines\nwith 91.6% recall and ~100% precision. Moreover, SMARTCAT also uncovers 616\nattack contracts in-the-wild, accounting for \\$9.25M financial losses, with\nonly 19 cases publicly reported. By applying SMARTCAT as a real-time detector\nin Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain, it has raised 14 alarms 99 seconds after\nthe corresponding deployment on average.

Recent advancements in learned legged locomotion\ncontrollers have enabled more dynamic and versatile robot behaviors. However,\ndetermining the optimal behavior for interactions with different users across\nvaried scenarios remains a challenge. Current methods either rely on natural\nlanguage input, which is efficient but low-resolution, or learn from human\npreferences, which, although high-resolution, is sample inefficient. This paper\nintroduces a novel approach that leverages priors generated by pre-trained LLMs\nalongside the precision of preference learning. Our method, termed\nLanguage-Guided Preference Learning (LGPL), uses LLMs to generate initial\nbehavior samples, which are then refined through preference-based feedback to\nlearn behaviors that closely align with human expectations. Our core insight is\nthat LLMs can guide the sampling process for preference learning, leading to a\nsubstantial improvement in sample efficiency. We demonstrate that LGPL can\nquickly learn accurate and expressive behaviors with as few as four queries,\noutperforming both purely language-parameterized models and traditional\npreference learning approaches.

Building on recent\nadvances in feature learning, we develop an effective, scalable approach for\nextracting linear representations of general concepts in large-scale AI models\n(language models, vision-language models, and reasoning models). We show how\nthese representations enable model steering, through which we expose\nvulnerabilities, mitigate misaligned behaviors, and improve model capabilities.\nAdditionally, we demonstrate that concept representations are remarkably\ntransferable across human languages and combinable to enable multi-concept\nsteering. Through quantitative analysis across hundreds of concepts, we find\nthat newer, larger models are more steerable and steering can improve model\ncapabilities beyond standard prompting. We show how concept representations are\neffective for monitoring misaligned content (hallucinations, toxic content). We\ndemonstrate that predictive models built using concept representations are more\naccurate for monitoring misaligned content than using models that judge outputs\ndirectly.

However, a discrepancy\nexists between various studies and the theoretical stellar model predicts\ndependence of their luminosity on [Fe/H]. Here we present a careful study of\nthe dependence of absolute magnitudes and color indexes on metallicity in\noptical and near-infrared bands. With the TRGB stars identified in 33 Galactic\nglobular clusters by the reddest color in the $G_{\\rm BP}-G_{\\rm RP}$ vs.\n$G_{\\rm RP}$ diagram, it is confirmed that $M_\\rm I$ is almost constant of\n$-4.017 \\pm 0.036 \\pm 0.027$ mag when $[\\rm Fe/H]<-1.2$, which would give\n$H_0=70.86\\pm 1.2\\pm0.9$ $\\rm kms^{-1} Mp c^{-1}$ with this updated luminosity\ncalibration for type Ia supernovae. However, for $[\\rm Fe/H]>-1.2$, $M_\\rm I$\nis found to become fainter with lower metallicity, which would lead to a larger\nHubble constant. In the optical $G_{\\rm BP}, G_{\\rm RP}$ and $V$ bands, the\nabsolute magnitude of TRGB stars tends to increase with metallicity, while in\nthe infrared $J, H$, and $K_{\\rm S}$ bands, the variation with metallicity\nshows an inverse tendency.

    "abstract": "The widespread application of autonomous driving technology has significantly\nadvanced the field of autonomous racing. Model Predictive Contouring Control\n(MPCC) is a highly effective local trajectory planning method for autonomous\nracing. However, the traditional MPCC method struggles with racetracks that\nhave significant curvature changes, limiting the performance of the vehicle\nduring autonomous racing. To address this issue, we propose a\ncurvature-integrated MPCC (CiMPCC) local trajectory planning method for\nautonomous racing. This method optimizes the velocity of the local trajectory\nbased on the curvature of the racetrack centerline. The specific implementation\ninvolves mapping the curvature of the racetrack centerline to a reference\nvelocity profile, which is then incorporated into the cost function for\noptimizing the velocity of the local trajectory. This reference velocity\nprofile is created by normalizing and mapping the curvature of the racetrack\ncenterline, thereby ensuring efficient and performance-oriented local\ntrajectory planning in racetracks with significant curvature. The proposed\nCiMPCC method has been experimented on a self-built 1:10 scale F1TENTH racing\nvehicle deployed with ROS platform. The experimental results demonstrate that\nthe proposed method achieves outstanding results on a challenging racetrack\nwith sharp curvature, improving the overall lap time by 11.4%-12.5% compared to\nother autonomous racing trajectory planning methods.

In this paper, we derive\nasymptotically unbiased estimates of the multi-step forecasting risk and the\nimpulse response estimation risk to determine hyperparameters in settings where\nthe VAR is (potentially) misspecified. The proposed criteria can be used to\njointly select the optimal shrinkage hyperparameter, VAR lag length, and to\nchoose among different types of multi-step-ahead predictors; or among IRF\nestimates based on VARs and local projections.

In the second one, the goal is to\nclassify a citation to one of four types using the textual content.

One common approach uses energy-based\ndecoding, which defines a target distribution through an energy function that\ncombines multiple constraints into a weighted average. However, these methods\noften struggle to balance fluency with constraint satisfaction, even with\nextensive tuning of the energy function's coefficients. In this paper, we\nidentify that this suboptimal balance arises from sampling in continuous space\nrather than the natural discrete space of text tokens. To address this, we\npropose Discrete Auto-regressive Biasing, a controlled decoding algorithm that\nleverages gradients while operating entirely in the discrete text domain.\nSpecifically, we introduce a new formulation for controlled text generation by\ndefining a joint distribution over the generated sequence and an auxiliary bias\nsequence.

We confirm that iron emission strength serves as a good\ntracer of the Eddington ratio, and estimate SMBH masses using an iron-corrected\n$R$-$L$ relation for H$\\beta$, where $R$ is the broad line region size and $L$\nis the continuum luminosity. Compared to our measurements, previous canonical\nmeasurements without the iron correction are overestimated by a factor of 1.5\non average. The overestimation can be up to a factor of 5 for super-Eddington\nquasars. The fraction of super-Eddington quasars in our sample is about 5%,\nsignificantly higher than 0.4% derived from the canonical measurements. Using a\nsample featuring both H$\\beta$ and MgII emission lines, we calibrate MgII-based\nSMBH masses using iron-corrected, H$\\beta$-based SMBH masses and establish an\niron-corrected $R$-$L$ relation for MgII. The new relation adds an extra term\nof $-0.34R_{\\mathrm{Fe}}$ to the $R$-$L$ relation, where $R_{\\mathrm{Fe}}$\ndenotes the relative iron strength. We use this formula to build a catalog of\nabout 0.5 million DESI quasars at $0.6<z<1.6$. If these iron-corrected $R$-$L$\nrelations for H$\\beta$ and MgII are valid at high redshift, current mass\nmeasurements of luminous quasars at $z\\ge6$ would have been overestimated by a\nfactor of 2.3 on average, alleviating the tension between SMBH mass and growth\nhistory in the early universe.",

It has long been debated whether\ngalaxies or active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are the major source of Lyman\ncontinuum (LyC) photons responsible for reionization. Previous observations\nslightly favored galaxies as the major ionizing source. However, the James Webb\nSpace Telescope (JWST) recently discovered an unexpectedly high density of AGN\ncandidates at high redshift, which has largely enhanced the influence of AGNs.\nHere we derive a definitive upper bound on the AGN contribution to reionization\nusing the latest JWST data, and conclusively rule out AGNs as the dominant\nionizing source during the epoch of reionization (EoR). We build a sample of\nobjects (including galaxies and AGNs) in a specific redshift range between 7.15\nand 7.75 that has a high completeness. Each object is then decomposed into a\npoint-source component and an extended component in their rest-frame far-UV\nJWST images. Assuming all point-source components are AGNs, we obtain an\nabsolute upper limit for the density of the AGN population. This fiducial AGN\nsample reaches an unprecedentedly low luminosity of $M_{\\rm UV} \\approx -15$\nmag. Based on this sample, we find that AGNs can contribute at most one third\nof the LyC photons required to ionize the Universe in this redshift range.

Unlike conventional cyberattacks, IPI\nperpetrators leverage close proximity and personal knowledge to circumvent\nstandard protections, underscoring the need for targeted interventions. While\nsecurity clinics and other human-centered approaches effectively tailor\nsolutions for victims, their scalability remains constrained by resource\nlimitations and the need for specialized counseling. We present AID, an\nAutomated IPI Detection system that continuously monitors for unauthorized\naccess and suspicious behaviors on smartphones. AID employs a unified\narchitecture to process multimodal signals stealthily and preserve user\nprivacy. A brief calibration phase upon installation enables AID to adapt to\neach user's behavioral patterns, achieving high accuracy with minimal false\nalarms. Our 27-participant user study demonstrates that AID achieves highly\naccurate detection of non-owner access and fine-grained IPI-related activities,\nattaining a false positive rate of 1.6%, which is 11x lower than existing\nmethods, and an end-to-end F1 score of 0.981. These findings suggest that AID\ncan serve as a forensic tool that security clinics can deploy to scale their\nability to identify IPI tactics and deliver personalized, far-reaching support\nto survivors.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we analyze the orientation estimation problem using inertial\nmeasurement units. Many estimation algorithms suffer degraded performance when\naccelerations other than gravity affect the accelerometer. We show that linear\naccelerations resulting from rotational accelerations cannot be treated as\nexternal disturbance to be attenuated, rather, they change the dynamic behavior\nof the filter itself. In particular, this results in the introduction of\nadditional zeros in the linearized transfer functions. These zeros lead to\nnonminimum phase behavior, which is known to be challenging for control. We\nvalidate these findings experimentally. Further, we demonstrate that Mahony and\nMadgwick filters can attenuate the acceleration at the expense of reduced\nbandwidth. In addition, we show that validation schemes based on precollected\ndata fail to capture these closed-loop effects accurately.",
