    "abstract": "All-in-one image restoration (AIR) aims to address diverse degradations\nwithin a unified model by leveraging informative degradation conditions to\nguide the restoration process. However, existing methods often rely on\nimplicitly learned priors, which may entangle feature representations and\nhinder performance in complex or unseen scenarios. Histogram of Oriented\nGradients (HOG) as a classical gradient representation, we observe that it has\nstrong discriminative capability across diverse degradations, making it a\npowerful and interpretable prior for AIR. Based on this insight, we propose\nHOGformer, a Transformer-based model that integrates learnable HOG features for\ndegradation-aware restoration. The core of HOGformer is a Dynamic HOG-aware\nSelf-Attention (DHOGSA) mechanism, which adaptively models long-range spatial\ndependencies conditioned on degradation-specific cues encoded by HOG\ndescriptors. To further adapt the heterogeneity of degradations in AIR, we\npropose a Dynamic Interaction Feed-Forward (DIFF) module that facilitates\nchannel-spatial interactions, enabling robust feature transformation under\ndiverse degradations. Besides, we propose a HOG loss to explicitly enhance\nstructural fidelity and edge sharpness. Extensive experiments on a variety of\nbenchmarks, including adverse weather and natural degradations, demonstrate\nthat HOGformer achieves state-of-the-art performance and generalizes well to\ncomplex real-world scenarios.Code is available at\nhttps://github.com/Fire-friend/HOGformer.",

    "abstract": "Many social media studies argue that social media creates echo chambers where\nsome users only interact with peers of the same political orientation. However,\nrecent studies suggest that a substantial amount of Cross-Partisan Interactions\n(CPIs) do exist - even within echo chambers, but they may be toxic. There is no\nconsensus about how such interactions occur and when they lead to healthy or\ntoxic dialogue. In this paper, we study a comprehensive Twitter dataset that\nconsists of 3 million tweets from 2020 related to the U.S. context to\nunderstand the dynamics behind CPIs. We investigate factors that are more\nassociated with such interactions, including how users engage in CPIs, which\ntopics are more contentious, and what are the stances associated with healthy\ninteractions. We find that CPIs are significantly influenced by the nature of\nthe topics being discussed, with politically charged events acting as strong\ncatalysts. The political discourse and pre-established political views sway how\nusers participate in CPIs, but the direction in which users go is nuanced.\nWhile Democrats engage in cross-partisan interactions slightly more frequently,\nthese interactions often involve more negative and nonconstructive stances\ncompared to their intra-party interactions. In contrast, Republicans tend to\nmaintain a more consistent tone across interactions. Although users are more\nlikely to engage in CPIs with popular accounts in general, this is less common\namong Republicans who often engage in CPIs with accounts with a low number of\nfollowers for personal matters. Our study has implications beyond Twitter as\nidentifying topics with low toxicity and high CPI can help highlight potential\nopportunities for reducing polarization while topics with high toxicity and low\nCPI may action targeted interventions when moderating harm.",

    "abstract": "The probabilistic surrogates used by Bayesian optimizers make them popular\nmethods when function evaluations are noisy or expensive to evaluate. While\nBayesian optimizers are traditionally used for global optimization, their\nbenefits are also valuable for local optimization. In this paper, a framework\nfor gradient-enhanced unconstrained local Bayesian optimization is presented.\nIt involves selecting a subset of the evaluation points to construct the\nsurrogate and using a probabilistic trust region for the minimization of the\nacquisition function. The Bayesian optimizer is compared to quasi-Newton\noptimizers from MATLAB and SciPy for unimodal problems with 2 to 40 dimensions.\nThe Bayesian optimizer converges the optimality as deeply as the quasi-Newton\noptimizer and often does so using significantly fewer function evaluations. For\nthe minimization of the 40-dimensional Rosenbrock function for example, the\nBayesian optimizer requires half as many function evaluations as the\nquasi-Newton optimizers to reduce the optimality by 10 orders of magnitude. For\ntest cases with noisy gradients, the probabilistic surrogate of the Bayesian\noptimizer enables it to converge the optimality several additional orders of\nmagnitude relative to the quasi-Newton optimizers. The final test case involves\nthe chaotic Lorenz 63 model and inaccurate gradients. For this problem, the\nBayesian optimizer achieves a lower final objective evaluation than the SciPy\nquasi-Newton optimizer for all initial starting solutions. The results\ndemonstrate that a Bayesian optimizer can be competitive with quasi-Newton\noptimizers when accurate gradients are available, and significantly outperforms\nthem when the gradients are innacurate.",

The familiarity between\ndocuments arises from the persistence of underlying discourse structures.\nHowever, existing similarity metrics dependent on lexical overlap and syntactic\npatterns largely capture $\\textit{content}$ overlap, thus making them\nunsuitable for detecting $\\textit{structural}$ similarities.

Using QUDsim, we find that\nLLMs often reuse discourse structures (more so than humans) across samples,\neven when content differs.

First, we show\nthat for a strong atom-field coupling, when the duration of the $\\pi $-pulse\n(the time interval required to completely excite or deexcite the qubit in the\nresonant regime) is below $100\\omega ^{-1}$, the behaviour of the atomic\nexcitation probability deviates significantly from the textbook sinusoidal\nformula derived for the SRM under the rotating-wave approximation, and we\npresent simple analytical and semi-analytical methods to describe more\naccurately the dynamics. Then we show that the QRM reproduces the qubit's\ndynamics predicted by the SRM only for initial times, since in the QRM the\nqubit excitation probability exhibits a collapse behaviour even in the lossless\nscenario; we also notice that the qualitative behaviour of such collapses is\ndifferent from the ones occurring in the dissipative SRM. In the rest of this\nwork we study numerically the backreaction of the qubit on the cavity field and\nthe resulting atom--field entanglement, which are disregarded in the SRM. It is\nshown that the atom-field entanglement increases over time and a maximally\nentangled state is attained for large times.

    "abstract": "Tracking multiple objects in a continuous video stream is crucial for many\ncomputer vision tasks. It involves detecting and associating objects with their\nrespective identities across successive frames. Despite significant progress\nmade in multiple object tracking (MOT), recent studies have revealed the\nvulnerability of existing MOT methods to adversarial attacks. Nevertheless, all\nof these attacks belong to digital attacks that inject pixel-level noise into\ninput images, and are therefore ineffective in physical scenarios. To fill this\ngap, we propose PapMOT, which can generate physical adversarial patches against\nMOT for both digital and physical scenarios. Besides attacking the detection\nmechanism, PapMOT also optimizes a printable patch that can be detected as new\ntargets to mislead the identity association process. Moreover, we introduce a\npatch enhancement strategy to further degrade the temporal consistency of\ntracking results across video frames, resulting in more aggressive attacks. We\nfurther develop new evaluation metrics to assess the robustness of MOT against\nsuch attacks. Extensive evaluations on multiple datasets demonstrate that our\nPapMOT can successfully attack various architectures of MOT trackers in digital\nscenarios. We also validate the effectiveness of PapMOT for physical attacks by\ndeploying printed adversarial patches in the real world.",

Nonlocal\nmagic refers to nonstabilizerness that cannot be erased via local operations,\nwhile operator entanglement generalizes entanglement to operator space,\ncharacterizing the complexity of operators across a bipartition. Specifically,\nwe prove that a unitary map generates nonlocal magic if and only if it\ngenerates operator entanglement on Pauli strings. Guided by this result, we\nintroduce an average measure of a unitary's Pauli-entangling power, serving as\na proxy for nonlocal magic generation.

However, their\ncomputational costs make them infeasible for processing large document corpora.\nTo address this, retrieval systems often employ a telescoping approach, where\ncomputationally efficient but less precise lexical and semantic retrievers\nfilter potential candidates for further ranking. However, this approach heavily\ndepends on the quality of early-stage retrieval, which can potentially exclude\nrelevant documents early in the process. In this work, we propose a novel\nparadigm for re-ranking called online relevance estimation that continuously\nupdates relevance estimates for a query throughout the ranking process. Instead\nof re-ranking a fixed set of top-k documents in a single step, online relevance\nestimation iteratively re-scores smaller subsets of the most promising\ndocuments while adjusting relevance scores for the remaining pool based on the\nestimations from the final model using an online bandit-based algorithm. This\ndynamic process mitigates the recall limitations of telescoping systems by\nre-prioritizing documents initially deemed less relevant by earlier stages --\nincluding those completely excluded by earlier-stage retrievers. We validate\nour approach on TREC benchmarks under two scenarios: hybrid retrieval and\nadaptive retrieval.

    "abstract": "While deep neural networks (DNNs) are widely used for prediction, inference\non DNN-estimated subject-specific means for categorical or exponential family\noutcomes remains underexplored. We address this by proposing a DNN estimator\nunder generalized nonparametric regression models (GNRMs) and developing a\nrigorous inference framework. Unlike existing approaches that assume\nindependence between prediction errors and inputs to establish the error bound,\na condition often violated in GNRMs, we allow for dependence and our\ntheoretical analysis demonstrates the feasibility of drawing inference under\nGNRMs. To implement inference, we consider an Ensemble Subsampling Method (ESM)\nthat leverages U-statistics and the Hoeffding decomposition to construct\nreliable confidence intervals for DNN estimates. We show that, under GNRM\nsettings, ESM enables model-free variance estimation and accounts for\nheterogeneity among individuals in the population. Through simulations under\nnonparametric logistic, Poisson, and binomial regression models, we demonstrate\nthe effectiveness and efficiency of our method. We further apply the method to\nthe electronic Intensive Care Unit (eICU) dataset, a large-scale collection of\nanonymized health records from ICU patients, to predict ICU readmission risk\nand offer patient-centric insights for clinical decision-making.",

However, their large parameter\nsizes present deployment challenges in resource-constrained environments with\nlimited GPU memory capacity, as GPU memory is often insufficient to accommodate\nthe full set of model weights. Consequently, typical deployments rely on\nCPU-GPU hybrid execution: the GPU handles compute-intensive GEMM operations,\nwhile the CPU processes the relatively lightweight attention mechanism. This\nsetup introduces a key challenge: how to effectively optimize resource\nutilization across CPU and GPU? Prior work has designed system optimizations\nbased on performance models with limited scope. Specifically, such models do\nnot capture the complex interactions between hardware properties and system\nexecution mechanisms. Therefore, previous approaches neither identify nor\nachieve the hardware limit.\n  This paper presents MoE-Lens, a high-throughput MoE LLM inference system\ndesigned through holistic performance modeling for resource-constrained\nenvironments.

We introduce Speculative\nThinking, a training-free framework that enables large reasoning models to\nguide smaller ones during inference at the reasoning level, distinct from\nspeculative decoding, which operates at the token level. Our approach is based\non two observations: (1) reasoning-supportive tokens such as \"wait\" frequently\nappear after structural delimiters like \"\\n\\n\", serving as signals for\nreflection or continuation; and (2) larger models exhibit stronger control over\nreflective behavior, reducing unnecessary backtracking while improving\nreasoning quality. By strategically delegating reflective steps to a more\ncapable model, our method significantly boosts the reasoning accuracy of\nreasoning models while shortening their output. With the assistance of the 32B\nreasoning model, the 1.5B model's accuracy on MATH500 increases from 83.2% to\n89.4%, marking a substantial improvement of 6.2%.

    "abstract": "For over a century, the electrodynamics of material media has been\ncharacterized by competing formulations, persistent paradoxes, and a\nfundamental lack of consensus on force and energy. This manuscript demonstrates\nthat these long-standing challenges are not a sign of intrinsic ambiguity in\nthe laws of physics, but are the direct consequence of historical and\npedagogical models becoming disconnected from a foundational principle of\nmechanics. The resolution begins with the axiom that a physical force must act\nupon a well-defined mass. From this single principle, a rigorous Force-Energy\nConsistency Criterion is derived. When applied as a diagnostic tool, this\ncriterion reveals a shared foundational inconsistency in the mechanical\nstructure of the seminal formulations of Minkowski, Abraham, and conventional\ntextbook approaches: their postulated forces are shown to be irreconcilable\nwith their own descriptions of energy conversion. The analysis is completed by\nproving a profound epistemological limit inherent in any macroscopic theory:\nthe indeterminacy of the local force density. This result reframes the\nhistorical search for a unique force law as an ill-posed question. By demanding\nmechanical consistency and respecting this fundamental limit, the ambiguity\nthat has plagued the field is resolved. A single, unique framework emerges not\nas a choice, but as a necessary logical conclusion: the universal vacuum-form\nenergy-momentum tensor ($T^{\\mu\\nu}_{EM}(\\mathbf{E},\\mathbf{B})$) and the total\nLorentz force. This work establishes this framework as the sole description\nconsistent with determinable physics and formally separates it from the\ndistinct task of building pragmatic models to estimate the unknowable internal\nforces. The result is a complete, consistent, and methodologically sound\nrestoration of the electrodynamics of matter.",

    "abstract": "Quantum computing promises to revolutionize problem-solving through quantum\nmechanics, but current NISQ devices face limitations in qubit count and error\nrates, hindering the execution of large-scale quantum circuits. To address\nthese challenges and improve scalability, two main circuit cutting strategies\nhave emerged: the gate-cut approach, which distributes circuit segments across\nmultiple QPUs (spatial), and the qubit wire cut approach, which divides\ncircuits for sequential execution (temporal). This paper presents a\nhypergraph-based circuit cutting methodology suitable for both spatial and\ntemporal scenarios. By modeling quantum circuits as high-level hypergraphs, we\napply partitioning heuristics such as Stoer-Wagner, Fiduccia-Mattheyses, and\nKernighan-Lin to optimize the partitioning process. Our approach aims to reduce\ncommunication overhead in spatial cuts and minimize qubit initialization costs\nin temporal ones. To assess effectiveness, we propose a new evaluation metric\ncalled the coupling ratio, which quantifies the trade-offs between\ncommunication and initialization. Comparative analyses show that hypergraph\npartitioning improves the efficiency of distributed quantum architectures.\nNotably, the Fiduccia-Mattheyses heuristic offers superior performance and\nadaptability for real-time circuit cutting on multi-QPU systems. Overall, this\nwork positions hypergraph partitioning as a foundational technique for scalable\nquantum computing in distributed environments.",

In this article we compute the beta functions to 3\nloops and show that the 1-loop structure of flows persists to higher orders.\nFor SU(2) broken to U(1), we conjecture a beta function to all orders. The\nflows can be extended to large coupling using a strong-weak coupling duality $g\n\\to 1/g$. One finds a line of fixed points which are new conformal field\ntheories in 4 spacetime dimensions which are non-unitary due to negative norm\nstates but still have real eigenvalues. We also find massless flows between 2\nnon-trivial fixed points, and a regime with a cyclic RG flow. For the flows\nbetween points on the critical line, we compute the anomalous dimensions of the\nperturbations in the UV and IR, and identify some special points where\nanomalous dimensions are rational numbers. The model is non-unitary since the\nhamiltonian is pseudo-hermitian, $H^\\dagger = {\\cal K} H {\\cal K}^\\dagger$.

Detecting Action Units (AUs)\nin micro-expressions is crucial because it yields a finer representation of\nfacial motions than categorical emotions, effectively resolving the ambiguity\namong different expressions. One of the difficulties in micro-expression\nanalysis is that facial motions are subtle and brief, thereby increasing the\ndifficulty in correlating facial motion features to AU occurrence. To bridge\nthe subtlety issue, flow-related features and motion magnification are a few\ncommon approaches as they can yield descriptive motion changes and increased\nmotion amplitude respectively. While motion magnification can amplify the\nmotion changes, it also accounts for illumination changes and projection errors\nduring the amplification process, thereby creating motion artefacts that\nconfuse the model to learn inauthentic magnified motion features. The problem\nis further aggravated in the context of a more complicated task where more AU\nclasses are analyzed in cross-database settings. To address this issue, we\npropose InfuseNet, a layer-wise unitary feature infusion framework that\nleverages motion context to constrain the Action Unit (AU) learning within an\ninformative facial movement region, thereby alleviating the influence of\nmagnification artefacts. On top of that, we propose leveraging magnified latent\nfeatures instead of reconstructing magnified samples to limit the distortion\nand artefacts caused by the projection inaccuracy in the motion reconstruction\nprocess. Via alleviating the magnification artefacts, InfuseNet has surpassed\nthe state-of-the-art results in the CD6ME protocol.

For example, it can be used for the\nremoval of undesired trapped flux from contactless elements of superconducting\ndevices. We investigate the dynamics of vortex lines in a superconducting film\nwith a ratchet thickness profile driven by an oscillating magnetic field\napplied parallel to the film. We numerically simulate the dynamics of a single\nflux line modeled as an elastic string with a variable length. We explore the\nbehavior for different frequencies and amplitudes of the oscillating magnetic\nfield and find several dynamic regimes. For moderate frequencies, the average\nvelocity is finite only within specific amplitude ranges. A notable feature is\nthe presence of extended velocity plateaus, which correspond to regimes when\nthe line moves by integer multiples of the spatial period $w$ during integer\nmultiples of the time period $T$. The transitions to these plateau states are\nrather steep, especially at low frequencies. The plateau at velocity $w/T$\ndominates at intermediate frequencies but vanishes at high frequencies. The\nonset field amplitude of finite velocity nonmonotonically depends on the\nfrequency and passes through a minimum at a certain frequency value. At low\nfrequencies, the velocity exceeds $w/T$ and progressively increases with the\namplitude.

For a proton, d and u quarks get together first, and then they\ncapture another u quark so that the d quark is at the core to form a stable\nproton state with intergral electric charge. The two u quarks form a quantum\nspheric shell and move in a confining potential $C(r)= Q' r$ of the core d\nquark. The confining potential $C(r)$ is a static solution of new `phase'\nfields satisfying the fourth-order equation based on general Yang-Mills\nsymmetry. The two u quarks with the confining linear potentials $C(r)$ in the\nspherical shell can produce an effective quark Hooke potential $V_{qH}(r)=Qr^2\n+ V_o$ for the d quark at the core, where Q and $Q'$ are not independent. The\nproton mass is assumed to be approximately given by\n  $ E(d) + 2E(u)$, which can be obtained analytically from Dirac Hamiltonians\ninvolving $V_{qH}(r)$ and $C(r)$ for d and two u quarks respectively.

We conduct\nextensive experiments on the Llama2-7b model across four language pairs\n(English-Chinese, Chinese-English, Russian-German, German-Russian) in 1-shot\nand 3-shot settings, using COMET20 and COMET22 for evaluation. Our results\ndemonstrate that DiverseConE consistently outperforms strong baseline methods,\nincluding random selection, BM25, TopK, and a state-of-the-art contrastive\nselection method. Further analysis, including diversity metrics and human\nevaluation, validates the effectiveness of our approach and highlights the\nbenefits of considering demonstration diversity for improved translation\nquality.",

These black holes support a strong magnetic field that polarizes the\nelectroweak vacuum and creates a condensate of massive fields carrying\nsuperconducting currents along the black hole horizon. The currents, in turn,\ngenerate a ``corona'' of magnetic vortex segments attached to the horizon at\nboth ends. The condensate and corona together constitute the black hole hair.\nThe extremal solutions approach, in the far field, the magnetic\nReissner-Nordstr\\\"om configuration, with a total mass that is {\\it lower} than\nthe total charge, $M<|Q|$, due to the negative Zeeman energy of the condensate.\nThis makes the removal of the hair energetically unfavorable. The maximally\nhairy black holes exhibit masses comparable to terrestrial values, with\napproximately 11\\% of their total mass stored in the hair.

These issues fundamentally stem from\nthe over-reliance on randomized (probabilistic) neural networks-oversimplified\nmodels of biological neural networks-while neglecting the role of procedural\nreasoning (chain-of-thought) in trustworthy decision-making. Inspired by the\nhuman cognitive duality of fluid intelligence (flexible generation) and\ncrystallized intelligence (structured knowledge), this study proposes a\ndual-channel intelligent architecture that integrates probabilistic generation\n(LLMs) with white-box procedural reasoning (chain-of-thought) to construct\ninterpretable, continuously learnable, and human-aligned AI systems.\nConcretely, this work: (1) redefines chain-of-thought as a programmable\ncrystallized intelligence carrier, enabling dynamic knowledge evolution and\ndecision verification through multi-turn interaction frameworks; (2) introduces\na task-driven modular network design that explicitly demarcates the functional\nboundaries between randomized generation and procedural control to address\ntrustworthiness in vertical-domain applications; (3) demonstrates that\nmulti-turn interaction is a necessary condition for intelligence emergence,\nwith dialogue depth positively correlating with the system's human-alignment\ndegree.

Our observations uncover a\nrare scenario. The object is viewed inside the jet cone, very close to the axis\nof its relativistic jet, with a viewing angle of <0.6 deg. This effectively\nmaximizes Doppler boosting to values ~30 and enhances both electromagnetic and\nneutrino emission in the observer's direction. Based on polarimetric\nobservations, we unambiguously detect a net toroidal component of the jet's\nmagnetic field, indicating a current carrying jet flowing almost directly\ntowards our line of sight. Blazars with very small jet viewing angles offer a\nsolution to the longstanding mismatch between Doppler factors inferred from low\nVLBI apparent jet speed and those derived from VHE observations -- the\nso-called \"Doppler factor crisis\".

On\nreal-world traces, DynaServe boosts the overall serving capacity from\n1.15$\\times$ to 3.07$\\times$, improves goodput by up to 1.91$\\times$ and\n1.61$\\times$, and improves the performance by up to 60\\% in a hybrid workload\nunder SLO compared to state-of-the-art colocated and disaggregated baselines.",

We develop\nan interface, SemanticCommit, to better understand how users resolve conflicts\nwhen updating intent specifications such as Cursor Rules and game design\ndocuments. A knowledge graph-based RAG pipeline drives conflict detection,\nwhile LLMs assist in suggesting resolutions. We evaluate our technique on an\ninitial benchmark.

Half of our participants adopted a workflow\nof impact analysis, where they would first flag conflicts without AI revisions\nthen resolve conflicts locally, despite having access to a global revision\nfeature.

In\naddition to their behaviour with the changing centrality of the collision,\ntheir event shape dependence has also been studied for the first time, using\nthe event shape classifier transverse spherocity. The Gaussian estimator has\nbeen used to evaluate the correlations, and these have been compared to the\nparticipant plane correlations defined in an analogous way to the symmetry\nplane correlations and a qualitative match has been found between them. These\nevent-shape differentiated symmetry plane correlations can be used to deduce\nthe presence of higher-order anisotropies in the initial energy distribution,\nthus giving insight into the initial geometry of the colliding system, among\nother applications like model development and model testing using Bayesian\nanalyses.",

    "abstract": "The full three-body problem, on the motion of three celestial bodies under\ntheir mutual gravitational attraction, is one of the oldest unsolved problems\nin classical mechanics. The main difficulty comes from the presence of unstable\nand chaotic motions, which make long-term prediction impossible. In this paper,\nwe show that the full three-body problem exhibits a strong form of instability\nknown as Arnold diffusion. We consider the planar full three-body problem,\nformulated as a perturbation of both the Kepler problem and the planar circular\nrestricted three-body problem. We show that the system exhibits Arnold\ndiffusion, in the sense that there is a transfer of energy -- of an amount\nindependent of the perturbation parameter -- between the Kepler problem and the\nrestricted three-body problem. Our argument is based on the topological method\nof correctly aligned windows, which is implemented into a computer assisted\nproof. We demonstrate that the approach can be applied to physically relevant\nmasses of the bodies, choosing a Neptune-Triton-asteroid system as an example.\nIn this case, we obtain explicit estimates for the range of the perturbation\nparameter and for the diffusion time.",

Previous simulation results\nshow that weak rates on isotopes of Molybdenum (Mo) have a meaningful\ncontribution during the development of phases of stars before they go\nsupernova. The relative abundance, coupled with the stellar weak rates on Mo\nisotopes, may change the lepton-to-baryon content of the core material. Here,\nwe report on the calculation of nuclear structure properties of Mo isotopes\nfrom mass number 82 to 138, employing the RMF model. Later, we calculate the\nweak decay rates of these isotopes using the proton-neutron quasiparticle\nrandom phase approximation (pn-QRPA) model. In the first step, the ground-state\nnuclear properties of Mo isotopes such as binding energy per nucleon, neutron\nand proton separation energies, charge radii, total electric quadrupole\nmoments, and the deformation parameter of electric quadrupole moments have been\ncalculated using the density-dependent version of the RMF model with DD-PC1 and\nDD-ME2 functionals. The calculated electric quadrupole deformation parameters\nhave been used in a deformed pn-QRPA calculation in the second phase of this\nwork to calculate half-lives and weak decay rates for these Mo isotopes in\nstellar matter. We calculate the electron capture and beta-decay rates over an\nextensive range of temperature (0.01 x 10^9 K to 30 x 10^9 K) and density (10\nto 10^11 g/cm^3).

In this paper, we present a\nnovel perspective on vanilla MoE with top-$k$ routing inspired by sparse\nrepresentation. This allows us to bridge established theoretical insights from\nsparse representation into MoE models. Building on this foundation, we propose\na group sparse regularization approach for the input of top-$k$ routing, termed\nMixture of Group Experts (MoGE). MoGE indirectly regularizes experts by\nimposing structural constraints on the routing inputs, while preserving the\noriginal MoE architecture. Furthermore, we organize the routing input into a 2D\ntopographic map, spatially grouping neighboring elements. This structure\nenables MoGE to capture representations invariant to minor transformations,\nthereby significantly enhancing expert diversity and specialization.\nComprehensive evaluations across various Transformer models for image\nclassification and language modeling tasks demonstrate that MoGE substantially\noutperforms its MoE counterpart, with minimal additional memory and computation\noverhead.

These\ndifferences render single-strategy KV compression techniques ineffective for\nVAR models. To address this, we propose HACK, a training-free Head-Aware\nCompression method for KV cache. HACK allocates asymmetric cache budgets and\nemploys pattern-specific compression strategies tailored to the essential\ncharacteristics of each head category.

    "abstract": "Circuit representation learning has shown promise in advancing Electronic\nDesign Automation (EDA) by capturing structural and functional circuit\nproperties for various tasks. Existing pre-trained solutions rely on graph\nlearning with complex functional supervision, such as truth table simulation.\nHowever, they only handle simple and-inverter graphs (AIGs), struggling to\nfully encode other complex gate functionalities. While large language models\n(LLMs) excel at functional understanding, they lack the structural awareness\nfor flattened netlists. To advance netlist representation learning, we present\nNetTAG, a netlist foundation model that fuses gate semantics with graph\nstructure, handling diverse gate types and supporting a variety of functional\nand physical tasks. Moving beyond existing graph-only methods, NetTAG\nformulates netlists as text-attributed graphs, with gates annotated by symbolic\nlogic expressions and physical characteristics as text attributes. Its\nmultimodal architecture combines an LLM-based text encoder for gate semantics\nand a graph transformer for global structure. Pre-trained with gate and graph\nself-supervised objectives and aligned with RTL and layout stages, NetTAG\ncaptures comprehensive circuit intrinsics. Experimental results show that\nNetTAG consistently outperforms each task-specific method on four largely\ndifferent functional and physical tasks and surpasses state-of-the-art AIG\nencoders, demonstrating its versatility.",

Traditional multimodal models typically\nemphasize outcomes over the reasoning process, compromising the reliability of\nclinical decisions. To address the weak reasoning abilities and lack of\nsupervised processes in pathological VLMs, we have innovatively proposed\nPathVLM-R1, a visual language model designed specifically for pathological\nimages. We have based our model on Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct and enhanced its\nperformance for pathological tasks through meticulously designed post-training\nstrategies. Firstly, we conduct supervised fine-tuning guided by pathological\ndata to imbue the model with foundational pathological knowledge, forming a new\npathological base model. Subsequently, we introduce Group Relative Policy\nOptimization (GRPO) and propose a dual reward-driven reinforcement learning\noptimization, ensuring strict constraint on logical supervision of the\nreasoning process and accuracy of results via cross-modal process reward and\noutcome accuracy reward. In the pathological image question-answering tasks,\nthe testing results of PathVLM-R1 demonstrate a 14% improvement in accuracy\ncompared to baseline methods, and it demonstrated superior performance compared\nto the Qwen2.5-VL-32B version despite having a significantly smaller parameter\nsize.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have achieved notable success in code\ngeneration. However, they still frequently produce uncompilable output because\ntheir next-token inference procedure does not model formal aspects of code.\nAlthough constrained decoding is a promising approach to alleviate this issue,\nit has only been applied to handle either domain-specific languages or\nsyntactic features of general-purpose programming languages. However, LLMs\nfrequently generate code with typing errors, which are beyond the domain of\nsyntax and generally hard to adequately constrain. To address this challenge,\nwe introduce a type-constrained decoding approach that leverages type systems\nto guide code generation. For this purpose, we develop novel prefix automata\nand a search over inhabitable types, forming a sound approach to enforce\nwell-typedness on LLM-generated code. We formalize our approach on a\nfoundational simply-typed language and extend it to TypeScript to demonstrate\npracticality. Our evaluation on the HumanEval and MBPP datasets shows that our\napproach reduces compilation errors by more than half and significantly\nincreases functional correctness in code synthesis, translation, and repair\ntasks across LLMs of various sizes and model families, including\nstate-of-the-art open-weight models with more than 30B parameters. The results\ndemonstrate the generality and effectiveness of our approach in constraining\nLLM code generation with formal rules of type systems.",

To weight their respective contributions for a given membrane\ngeometry, the strain profile has to be mapped with respect to the ferroelectric\npolarization landscape, a necessary step to allow for a controlled tailoring of\nthe latter.

    "abstract": "There are a variety of mechanisms (i.e., input types) for real-time human\ninteraction that can facilitate effective human-robot teaming. For example,\nprevious works have shown how teleoperation, corrective, and discrete (i.e.,\npreference over a small number of choices) input can enable robots to complete\ncomplex tasks. However, few previous works have looked at combining different\nmethods, and in particular, opportunities for a robot to estimate and elicit\nthe most effective form of assistance given its understanding of a task. In\nthis paper, we propose a method for estimating the value of different human\nassistance mechanisms based on the action uncertainty of a robot policy. Our\nkey idea is to construct mathematical expressions for the expected\npost-interaction differential entropy (i.e., uncertainty) of a stochastic robot\npolicy to compare the expected value of different interactions. As each type of\nhuman input imposes a different requirement for human involvement, we\ndemonstrate how differential entropy estimates can be combined with a\nlikelihood penalization approach to effectively balance feedback informational\nneeds with the level of required input. We demonstrate evidence of how our\napproach interfaces with emergent learning models (e.g., a diffusion model) to\nproduce accurate assistance value estimates through both simulation and a robot\nuser study.

Utilizing soft-legged robots in performing tasks as a\nreplacement for human beings is an important stride to take, especially under\nharsh and hazardous conditions over rough terrain environments. For the demand\nto teach any robot how to behave in different scenarios, a real-time physical\nand visual simulation is essential. When it comes to soft robots specifically,\na simulation framework is still an arduous problem that needs to be disclosed.\nUsing the simulation open framework architecture (SOFA) is an advantageous\nstep. However, neither SOFA's manual nor prior public SOFA projects show its\nmaximum capabilities the users can reach. So, we resolved this by establishing\ncustomized settings and handling the framework components appropriately.\nSettling on perfect, fine-tuned SOFA parameters has stimulated our motivation\ntowards implementing the state-of-the-art (SOTA) reinforcement learning (RL)\nmethod of proximal policy optimization (PPO). The final representation is a\nwell-defined, ready-to-deploy walking, tripedal, soft-legged robot based on\nPPO-RL in a SOFA environment. Robot navigation performance is a key metric to\nbe considered for measuring the success resolution.

Specifically, we present qualitative and\nquantitative evidence to show that the classical, KD, and postquantum\nquasiprobabilities form a strict hierarchy, in the sense that joint probability\ndistributions are a strict subset of KD quasiprobability distributions that are\na strict subset of postquantum ones. Surprisingly, we are able to derive some\nnontrivial bounds valid for both classical probability and KD quasiprobability,\nand even valid for the KD quasiprobability generated by an arbitrary number of\nmeasurements.

This paper studies the hypothesis-testing problem regarding whether $n$\ni.i.d. samples are generated from a $d$-dimensional multivariate normal\ndistribution in settings where $d$ grows with $n$ at some rate. To this end, we\npropose a new class of tests which can be regarded as a high-dimensional\nadaptation of the classical radial-based approach to testing multivariate\nnormality. A key member of this class is a range-type test statistic which,\nunder a very general rate of growth of $d$ with respect to $n$, is proven to\nachieve both valid type I error-control and consistency for three important\nclasses of alternatives; namely, finite mixture model, non-Gaussian elliptical,\nand leptokurtic alternatives.

    "abstract": "Reducing undesirable path crossings among trajectories of different robots is\nvital in multi-robot navigation missions, which not only reduces detours and\nconflict scenarios, but also enhances navigation efficiency and boosts\nproductivity. Despite recent progress in multi-robot path-crossing-minimal\n(MPCM) navigation, the majority of approaches depend on the minimal\nsquared-distance reassignment of suitable desired points to robots directly.\nHowever, if obstacles occupy the passing space, calculating the actual\nrobot-point distances becomes complex or intractable, which may render the MPCM\nnavigation in obstacle environments inefficient or even infeasible.\n  In this paper, the concurrent-allocation task execution (CATE) algorithm is\npresented to address this problem (i.e., MPCM navigation in obstacle\nenvironments). First, the path-crossing-related elements in terms of (i) robot\nallocation, (ii) desired-point convergence, and (iii) collision and obstacle\navoidance are encoded into integer and control barrier function (CBF)\nconstraints. Then, the proposed constraints are used in an online constrained\noptimization framework, which implicitly yet effectively minimizes the possible\npath crossings and trajectory length in obstacle environments by minimizing the\ndesired point allocation cost and slack variables in CBF constraints\nsimultaneously. In this way, the MPCM navigation in obstacle environments can\nbe achieved with flexible spatial orderings. Note that the feasibility of\nsolutions and the asymptotic convergence property of the proposed CATE\nalgorithm in obstacle environments are both guaranteed, and the calculation\nburden is also reduced by concurrently calculating the optimal allocation and\nthe control input directly without the path planning process.",

Their detection could provide an important test bed for a\ndetailed study of lambda Boo stars. Results. For the first time, we present the\nsurprising finding of two lambda Boo stars as members of open clusters: HD\n28548 belongs to the cluster HSC 1640 and HD 36726 belongs to the cluster Theia\n139. This was confirmed using a detailed abundance analysis, while the cluster\nmembership was independently analyzed using Gaia DR3 data and radial\nvelocities. We compared the lambda Boo star HD 36726 with other cluster members\nand showed that the lambda Boo star was originally born with a near-solar\ncomposition. This also implies one of the highest chemical differences detected\nbetween two cluster members (0.5 dex). In addition, we suggest that the lambda\nBoo peculiarity strongly depletes heavier metals, but could also slightly\nmodify lighter abundances such as C and O. We also found that both lambda Boo\nstars belong to the periphery of their respective clusters. This would suggest\nthat lambda Boo stars avoid the strong photoevaporation by UV radiation from\nmassive stars in the central regions of the cluster. We preliminarily suggest\nthat peripheral location appears to be a necessary, though not sufficient,\ncondition for the development of lambda Boo peculiarity. We also obtained a\nprecise age determination for the lambda Boo stars HD 28548 (26.3 Myr) and HD\n36726 (33.1 Myr). Conclusions.

    "abstract": "Given the critical role of birds in ecosystems, Fine-Grained Bird Recognition\n(FGBR) has gained increasing attention, particularly in distinguishing birds\nwithin similar subcategories. Although Vision Transformer (ViT)-based methods\noften outperform Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based methods in FGBR,\nrecent studies reveal that the limited receptive field of plain ViT model\nhinders representational richness and makes them vulnerable to scale variance.\nThus, enhancing the multi-scale capabilities of existing ViT-based models to\novercome this bottleneck in FGBR is a worthwhile pursuit. In this paper, we\npropose a novel framework for FGBR, namely Multi-scale Diverse Cues Modeling\n(MDCM), which explores diverse cues at different scales across various stages\nof a multi-scale Vision Transformer (MS-ViT) in an\n\"Activation-Selection-Aggregation\" paradigm. Specifically, we first propose a\nmulti-scale cue activation module to ensure the discriminative cues learned at\ndifferent stage are mutually different. Subsequently, a multi-scale token\nselection mechanism is proposed to remove redundant noise and highlight\ndiscriminative, scale-specific cues at each stage. Finally, the selected tokens\nfrom each stage are independently utilized for bird recognition, and the\nrecognition results from multiple stages are adaptively fused through a\nmulti-scale dynamic aggregation mechanism for final model decisions.

    "abstract": "Image segmentation beyond predefined categories is a key challenge in remote\nsensing, where novel and unseen classes often emerge during inference.\nOpen-vocabulary image Segmentation addresses these generalization issues in\ntraditional supervised segmentation models while reducing reliance on extensive\nper-pixel annotations, which are both expensive and labor-intensive to obtain.\nMost Open-Vocabulary Segmentation (OVS) methods are designed for natural images\nbut struggle with remote sensing data due to scale variations, orientation\nchanges, and complex scene compositions. This necessitates the development of\nOVS approaches specifically tailored for remote sensing. In this context, we\npropose AerOSeg, a novel OVS approach for remote sensing data. First, we\ncompute robust image-text correlation features using multiple rotated versions\nof the input image and domain-specific prompts. These features are then refined\nthrough spatial and class refinement blocks. Inspired by the success of the\nSegment Anything Model (SAM) in diverse domains, we leverage SAM features to\nguide the spatial refinement of correlation features. Additionally, we\nintroduce a semantic back-projection module and loss to ensure the seamless\npropagation of SAM's semantic information throughout the segmentation pipeline.\nFinally, we enhance the refined correlation features using a multi-scale\nattention-aware decoder to produce the final segmentation map. We validate our\nSAM-guided Open-Vocabulary Remote Sensing Segmentation model on three benchmark\nremote sensing datasets: iSAID, DLRSD, and OpenEarthMap. Our model outperforms\nstate-of-the-art open-vocabulary segmentation methods, achieving an average\nimprovement of 2.54 h-mIoU.",

Our method\nidentifies the essential region for modification through algorithms that\nprovide visual explanations, and then our framework generates realistic\ncounterfactual explanations by combining adversarial attacks based on pruning\nthe adversarial gradient of the target classifier and the latent diffusion\nmodel. The proposed method outperforms previous state-of-the-art results on\nvarious evaluation criteria on ImageNet and CelebA-HQ datasets.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate the Domain Name System (DNS) over QUIC (DoQ)\nand propose a non-disruptive extension, which can greatly reduce DoQ's resource\nconsumption. This extension can benefit all DNS clients - especially Internet\nof Things (IoT) devices. This is important because even resource-constrained\nIoT devices can generate dozens of DNS requests every hour. DNS is a crucial\nservice that correlates IP addresses and domain names. It is traditionally sent\nas plain-text, favoring low-latency results over security and privacy. The\nrepercussion of this can be eavesdropping and information leakage about IoT\ndevices. To address these concerns, the newest and most promising solution is\nDoQ. QUIC offers features similar to TCP and TLS while also supporting early\ndata delivery and stream multiplexing. DoQ's specification requires that DNS\nexchanges occur over independent streams in a long-lived QUIC connection. Our\nhypothesis is that due to DNS's typically high transaction volume, managing\nQUIC streams may be overly resource intensive for IoT devices. Therefore, we\nhave designed and implemented a data delivery mode for DoQ using QUIC\ndatagrams, which we believe to be more preferable than stream-based delivery.\nTo test our theory, we analyzed the memory, CPU, signaling, power, and time of\neach DoQ delivery mode in a setup generating real queries and network traffic.\nOur novel datagram-based delivery mode proved to be decisively more\nresource-friendly with little compromise in terms of functionality or\nperformance. Furthermore, our paper is the first to investigate multiple\nqueries over DoQ, to our knowledge.",

The unique\nnon-commutative multiplication of non-Abelian groups, along with the distinct\ntopological classifications in the context of homotopy with or without a fixed\nbase point, makes the identification of different non-Abelian topological\nphases more nuanced and challenging than in the Abelian case.

However,\ncurrent methods struggle with challenges arising from multimodal data, such as\ndimensional disparities, mismatched target counts, vessel scale variations,\nocclusions, and asynchronous data streams from systems like the automatic\nidentification system (AIS) and closed-circuit television (CCTV). Traditional\nmulti-target association methods often struggle with these complexities,\nparticularly in densely trafficked waterways. To overcome these issues, we\npropose a graph learning-driven multi-vessel association (GMvA) method tailored\nfor maritime multimodal data fusion. By integrating AIS and CCTV data, GMvA\nleverages time series learning and graph neural networks to capture the\nspatiotemporal features of vessel trajectories effectively. To enhance feature\nrepresentation, the proposed method incorporates temporal graph attention and\nspatiotemporal attention, effectively capturing both local and global vessel\ninteractions. Furthermore, a multi-layer perceptron-based uncertainty fusion\nmodule computes robust similarity scores, and the Hungarian algorithm is\nadopted to ensure globally consistent and accurate target matching. Extensive\nexperiments on real-world maritime datasets confirm that GMvA delivers superior\naccuracy and robustness in multi-target association, outperforming existing\nmethods even in challenging scenarios with high vessel density and incomplete\nor unevenly distributed AIS and CCTV data.",

Yet, the\nCO2 growth rate anomaly obtained after removing the long term trend is 1.1\nppm~yr$^{-1}$, which is marginally smaller than the July--July growth rate\nanomalies of the two major previous El Ni\\~no events in 1997/98 and 2015/16.\nThe atmospheric CO2 growth rate anomaly was primarily driven by a 2.24\nGtC~yr$^{-1}$ reduction in the net land sink including 0.3 GtC~yr$^{-1}$ of\nfire emissions, partly offset by a 0.38 GtC~yr$^{-1}$ increase in the ocean\nsink relative to the 2015--2022 July--July mean. The tropics accounted for\n97.5\\% of the land CO2 flux anomaly, led by the Amazon (50.6\\%), central Africa\n(34\\%), and Southeast Asia (8.2\\%), with extra-tropical sources in South Africa\nand southern Brazil during April--July 2024. Our three DGVMs suggest greater\ntropical CO2 losses in 2023/2024 than during the two previous large El Ni\\~no\nin 1997/98 and 2015/16, whereas inversions indicate losses more comparable to\n2015/16. Overall, this update of the low latency budget highlights the impact\nof recent El Ni\\~no droughts in explaining the high CO2 growth rate until July\n2024.",

Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) technology has emerged as a\ntransformative approach that enables intelligent software-defined management of\nthe RAN. A cornerstone of O-RAN is the RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC), which\nfacilitates the deployment of intelligent applications (xApps and rApps) near\nthe radio unit. In this context, QoS management through O-RAN has been explored\nusing network slice and machine learning (ML) techniques. Although prior\nstudies have demonstrated the ability to optimize RAN resource allocation and\nprioritize slices effectively, they have not considered the critical\nintegration of Service Level Agreements (SLAs) into the ML learning process.\nThis omission can lead to suboptimal resource utilization and, in many cases,\nservice outages when target Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are not met. This\nwork introduces RSLAQ, an innovative xApp designed to ensure robust QoS\nmanagement for RAN slicing while incorporating SLAs directly into its\noperational framework. RSLAQ translates operator policies into actionable\nconfigurations, guiding resource distribution and scheduling for RAN slices.\nUsing deep reinforcement learning (DRL), RSLAQ dynamically monitors RAN\nperformance metrics and computes optimal actions, embedding SLA constraints to\nmitigate conflicts and prevent outages. Extensive system-level simulations\nvalidate the efficacy of the proposed solution, demonstrating its ability to\noptimize resource allocation, improve SLA adherence, and maintain operational\nreliability (>95%) in challenging scenarios.",

First, anatomical maps are independently derived\nfrom three sources: real patient data, XCAT digital phantoms, and synthetic\nanatomies created by combining organs from multiple patients. Second, we\nintroduce PhysioSynth, a modality-specific simulator that converts anatomical\nmasks into prior volumes using tissue-dependent parameters (e.g., HU, T1, T2,\nproton density) and modality-specific signal models. It supports simulation of\nCT and multiple MR sequences including GRE, SPACE, and VIBE. Third, the\nsynthesized anatomical priors are used to train 2-channel conditional denoising\ndiffusion models, which take the anatomical prior as structural condition\nalongside the noisy image, enabling generation of high-quality, structurally\naligned images. The framework achieves SSIM of 0.94 for CT and 0.89 for MR\ncompared to real data, and FSIM of 0.78 for simulated CT. The generative\nquality is further supported by a Frechet Inception Distance (FID) of 3.62 for\nCT synthesis. In modality conversion, seg2med achieves SSIM of 0.91 for MR to\nCT and 0.77 for CT to MR. Anatomical fidelity evaluation shows synthetic CT\nachieves mean Dice scores above 0.90 for 11 key abdominal organs, and above\n0.80 for 34 of 59 total organs.

    "abstract": "Dust-obscured galaxies (DOGs) are considered to be in a co-evolution phase,\nwith the associated active galactic nuclei (AGN) obscured by dust and gas.\nAlthough the DOGs are thought to harbor rapidly growing SMBHs, their X-ray\nstatistical properties, crucial for understanding the properties of obscuring\ngas as well as the accretion disk state and the hot electron corona around the\nSMBHs, remain unexplored due to the combination of the low number density of\nDOGs and the lack of X-ray surveys achieving both of the wide-area and\nuniformly high-sensitivity observations. We construct a sample of\nX-ray-detected DOGs in the eROSITA Final Equatorial Depth Survey (eFEDS) field\nand examine their X-ray statistical properties. By using Subaru/HSC SSP,\nVIKING, and WISE all-sky surveys, our results reveal the discovery of 5738\nIR-bright DOGs in the footprint covered by both of the eFEDS and VIKING surveys\n(60 deg^2), with 65 objects identified as X-ray-detected DOGs (eFEDS-DOGs).\nAmong them, 41 eFEDS-DOGs show a power-law slope in the near to mid-IR bands\n(power-law DOGs), indicating dust-obscured AGN. The hydrogen column density\n(N_H) suggests that eFEDS-DOGs cover even unobscured AGN, spanning 10^20 < N_H\n<= 10^23. On the other hand, the majority of IR-bright DOGs are not detected by\neROSITA, suggesting that most IR-bright DOGs are heavily obscured by dust and\ngas with N_H > 10^23. Therefore, eFEDS-DOGs, discovered thanks to the wide-area\nsurvey by eROSITA, are newly found populations showing less obscured phases\namong the lifetime of DOGs. Additionally, some eFEDS-DOGs exhibit deviations,\ndown to nearly 1.0 dex below the monochromatic luminosity at 6 micron versus\nabsorption-corrected intrinsic X-ray luminosity between 0.5-2 keV relation,\nsuggesting that it may signal high Eddington ratios reaching the Eddington\nlimit.",

    "abstract": "In open data sets of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), the\nheterogeneity of the data is typically attributed to a combination of factors,\nincluding differences in scanning procedures, the presence of confounding\neffects, and population diversities between multiple sites. These factors\ncontribute to the diminished effectiveness of representation learning, which in\nturn affects the overall efficacy of subsequent classification procedures. To\naddress these limitations, we propose a novel multi-site adversarial learning\nnetwork (MSalNET) for fMRI-based mental disorder detection. Firstly, a\nrepresentation learning module is introduced with a node information assembly\n(NIA) mechanism to better extract features from functional connectivity (FC).\nThis mechanism aggregates edge information from both horizontal and vertical\ndirections, effectively assembling node information. Secondly, to generalize\nthe feature across sites, we proposed a site-level feature extraction module\nthat can learn from individual FC data, which circumvents additional prior\ninformation. Lastly, an adversarial learning network is proposed as a means of\nbalancing the trade-off between individual classification and site regression\ntasks, with the introduction of a novel loss function. The proposed method was\nevaluated on two multi-site fMRI datasets, i.e., Autism Brain Imaging Data\nExchange (ABIDE) and ADHD-200. The results indicate that the proposed method\nachieves a better performance than other related algorithms with the accuracy\nof 75.56 and 68.92 in ABIDE and ADHD-200 datasets, respectively. Furthermore,\nthe result of the site regression indicates that the proposed method reduces\nsite variability from a data-driven perspective. The most discriminative brain\nregions revealed by NIA are consistent with statistical findings, uncovering\nthe \"black box\" of deep learning to a certain extent.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in reconfigurable antennas have led to the new concept of the\nfluid antenna system (FAS) for shape and position flexibility, as another\ndegree of freedom for wireless communication enhancement. This paper explores\nthe integration of a transmit FAS array for hybrid beamforming (HBF) into a\nreconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted communication architecture\nfor multiuser communications in the downlink, corresponding to the downlink\nRIS-assisted multiuser multiple-input single-output (MISO) FAS model (Tx\nRIS-assisted-MISO-FAS). By considering Rician channel fading, we formulate a\nsum-rate maximization optimization problem to alternately optimize the HBF\nmatrix, the RIS phase-shift matrix, and the FAS position. Due to the strong\ncoupling of multiple optimization variables, the multi-fractional summation in\nthe sum-rate expression, the modulus-1 limitation of analog phase shifters and\nRIS, and the antenna position variables appearing in the exponent, this problem\nis highly non-convex, which is addressed through the block coordinate descent\n(BCD) framework in conjunction with semidefinite relaxation (SDR) and\nmajorization-minimization (MM) methods. To reduce the computational complexity,\nwe then propose a low-complexity grating-lobe (GL)-based telescopic-FAS (TFA)\nwith multiple delicately deployed RISs under the sub-connected HBF architecture\nand the line-of-sight (LoS)-dominant channel condition, to allow closed-form\nsolutions for the HBF and TFA position. Our simulation results illustrate that\nthe former optimization scheme significantly enhances the achievable rate of\nthe proposed system, while the GL-based TFA scheme also provides a considerable\ngain over conventional fixed-position antenna (FPA) systems, requiring\nstatistical channel state information (CSI) only and with low computational\ncomplexity.",

We then give a full theoretical\ncharacterization of self-orthogonal linear CA, by considering the square matrix\nobtained by stacking the transition matrices of the CA and of its transpose,\nand determining when it is invertible.

Our construction does not compromise on the fact that the\ncodes are local on a lattice with open boundary conditions.

Conventionally, gas pressure maxima sustained by gas\nsurface density maxima have been considered as the primary cause of such dust\naccumulation. However, the disk's pressure structure depends not only on gas\ndensity but also on the temperature structure, which itself is influenced by\nthe distribution of dust. In this study, we propose a novel mechanism for dust\naccumulation, which is driven by the coevolution of dust and disk temperature.\nIn the inner disk region where the midplane temperature is primarily determined\nby the balance between viscous heating and radiative cooling, a perturbation in\ndust surface density distribution may affect radiative cooling efficiency,\npotentially producing a local maximum in the temperature and pressure profiles.\nTo test this hypothesis, we perform coupled calculations of dust and disk\ntemperature evolution, incorporating the advection, diffusion, coagulation, and\nfragmentation of dust particles along with viscous heating, radiative cooling,\nand radial thermal diffusion. Our results demonstrate that a pressure maximum\nformed by a perturbation in the dust surface density can spontaneously induce\ndust accumulation, even in the absence of a gas surface density maximum, under\nconditions where dust drift is significantly faster than diffusion and the\nthermal evolution occurs faster than the inward migration of dust. This\nmechanism requires viscous heating to dominate disk heating, and typically\noccurs interior to the snow line. In this spontaneous dust trap, the\ndust-to-gas density ratio at the midplane can exceed unity, suggesting the\npotential for rocky planetesimal formation via streaming and gravitational\ninstabilities.",

    "abstract": "Given the growing use of generative artificial intelligence as a tool for\ncreating multilingual content and bypassing both machine and traditional\ntranslation methods, this study explores the ability of linguistically trained\nindividuals to discern machine-generated output from human-written text (HT).\nAfter brief training sessions on the textual anomalies typically found in\nsynthetic text (ST), twenty-three postgraduate translation students analysed\nexcerpts of Italian prose and assigned likelihood scores to indicate whether\nthey believed they were human-written or AI-generated (ChatGPT-4o). The results\nshow that, on average, the students struggled to distinguish between HT and ST,\nwith only two participants achieving notable accuracy. Closer analysis revealed\nthat the students often identified the same textual anomalies in both HT and\nST, although features such as low burstiness and self-contradiction were more\nfrequently associated with ST. These findings suggest the need for improvements\nin the preparatory training. Moreover, the study raises questions about the\nnecessity of editing synthetic text to make it sound more human-like and\nrecommends further research to determine whether AI-generated text is already\nsufficiently natural-sounding not to require further refinement.",

    "abstract": "The rapid growth of social media has led to the widespread dissemination of\nfake news across multiple content forms, including text, images, audio, and\nvideo. Traditional unimodal detection methods fall short in addressing complex\ncross-modal manipulations; as a result, multimodal fake news detection has\nemerged as a more effective solution. However, existing multimodal approaches,\nespecially in the context of fake news detection on social media, often\noverlook the confounders hidden within complex cross-modal interactions,\nleading models to rely on spurious statistical correlations rather than genuine\ncausal mechanisms. In this paper, we propose the Causal Intervention-based\nMultimodal Deconfounded Detection (CIMDD) framework, which systematically\nmodels three types of confounders via a unified Structural Causal Model (SCM):\n(1) Lexical Semantic Confounder (LSC); (2) Latent Visual Confounder (LVC); (3)\nDynamic Cross-Modal Coupling Confounder (DCCC). To mitigate the influence of\nthese confounders, we specifically design three causal modules based on\nbackdoor adjustment, frontdoor adjustment, and cross-modal joint intervention\nto block spurious correlations from different perspectives and achieve causal\ndisentanglement of representations for deconfounded reasoning. Experimental\nresults on the FakeSV and FVC datasets demonstrate that CIMDD significantly\nimproves detection accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 4.27%\nand 4.80%, respectively. Furthermore, extensive experimental results indicate\nthat CIMDD exhibits strong generalization and robustness across diverse\nmultimodal scenarios.",

This is because the index\nreceives contributions only from \"short\" irreducible representations such that\nit is invariant under recombination at the boundary of the region of unitarity.\n  The purpose of this paper is to develop these notions for unitarizable\nsupermodules over the special linear Lie superalgebras $\\mathfrak{sl}(m\\vert\nn)$ with $m\\ge 2$, $n\\ge 1$. To keep it self-contained, we include a fair\namount of background material on structure theory, unitarizable supermodules,\nthe Duflo-Serganova functor, and elements of Harish-Chandra theory. Along the\nway, we provide a precise dictionary between various notions from theoretical\nphysics and mathematical terminology. Our final result is a kind of \"index\ntheorem\" that relates the counting of atypical constituents in a general\nunitarizable $\\mathfrak{sl}(m\\vert n)$-supermodule to the character-valued\n$Q$-Witten index, expressed as a supertrace over the full supermodule.

The key design of SCFlow2 is\nan introduction of geometry constraints into the training of recurrent matching\nnetwork, by combining the rigid-motion embeddings in 3D scene flow and 3D shape\nprior of the target. We train SCFlow2 on a combination of dataset Objaverse,\nGSO and ShapeNet, and evaluate on BOP datasets with novel objects.

The\nproposed method leverages the vision model being trained to parse the input\nvisual cues into a hierarchy structure, which is hence adopted to generate\nmasks accordingly. The accuracy of hierarchy is on par with the capability of\nthe model being trained, leading to evolved mask patterns at different training\nstages.

While the emergence of magic numbers\nbeyond 20 is commonly attributed to strong spin-orbit coupling, the microscopic\norigin of the spin-orbit potential remains elusive, owing to its dependence on\nthe resolution scale and renormalization scheme of nuclear forces. Here, we\ninvestigate the evolution of shell structure with varying momentum resolution\nin nuclear interactions derived from chiral effective field theory, using the\nsimilarity renormalization group, which provides a fundamental framework for\nlinking different scales. We uncover a universal transition from spin symmetry\nto pseudospin symmetry as the resolution scale decreases, during which magic\nnumbers emerge naturally. A similar pattern is found in calculations using\nrelativistic one-boson-exchange potentials, underscoring the robustness of the\nphenomenon. This work establishes a direct connection between realistic nuclear\nforces with a high resolution scale and effective nuclear forces at\ncoarse-grained scales, offering a first-principles explanation for the origin\nof magic numbers and pseudospin symmetry in nuclear shell structure, and new\ninsights into the structure of exotic nuclei far from stability.",

In order to understand the\ndriving forces of technology adoption in this use case, a large survey (N =\n2250) was conducted in five EU countries (Austria, Belgium, Estonia, Germany,\nGreece). For the data analysis structural equation modelling based on the\nUnified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) was employed, which\nwas extended by adding social beliefs, including descriptive social norms,\ncollective efficacy, social identity and trust. As a result, performance\nexpectancy, price value, and effort expectancy proved to be the most important\npredictors overall, with variations across countries.

    "abstract": "In real-world applications of large language models, outputs are often\nrequired to be confined: selecting items from predefined product or document\nsets, generating phrases that comply with safety standards, or conforming to\nspecialized formatting styles. To control the generation, constrained decoding\nhas been widely adopted. However, existing prefix-tree-based constrained\ndecoding is inefficient under GPU-based model inference paradigms, and it\nintroduces unintended biases into the output distribution. This paper\nintroduces Dynamic Importance Sampling for Constrained Decoding (DISC) with\nGPU-based Parallel Prefix-Verification (PPV), a novel algorithm that leverages\ndynamic importance sampling to achieve theoretically guaranteed asymptotic\nunbiasedness and overcomes the inefficiency of prefix-tree. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing methods in\nboth efficiency and output quality. These results highlight the potential of\nour methods to improve constrained generation in applications where adherence\nto specific constraints is essential.",

    "abstract": "Drifting is an advanced driving technique where the wheeled robot's\ntire-ground interaction breaks the common non-holonomic pure rolling\nconstraint. This allows high-maneuverability tasks like quick cornering, and\nsteady-state drifting control enhances motion stability under lateral slip\nconditions. While drifting has been successfully achieved in four-wheeled robot\nsystems, its application to single-track two-wheeled (STTW) robots, such as\nunmanned motorcycles or bicycles, has not been thoroughly studied. To bridge\nthis gap, this paper extends the drifting equilibrium theory to STTW robots and\nreveals the mechanism behind the steady-state drifting maneuver. Notably, the\ncounter-steering drifting technique used by skilled motorcyclists is explained\nthrough this theory. In addition, an analytical algorithm based on intrinsic\ngeometry and kinematics relationships is proposed, reducing the computation\ntime by four orders of magnitude while maintaining less than 6% error compared\nto numerical methods. Based on equilibrium analysis, a model predictive\ncontroller (MPC) is designed to achieve steady-state drifting and equilibrium\npoints transition, with its effectiveness and robustness validated through\nsimulations.",

Such Hamiltonians frequently\narise in quantum algorithms, including constrained mixers in QAOA, fermionic\nand excitation operators in VQE, and lattice gauge theory applications.\nAdditionally, we construct transposition gates, widely used in quantum\ncomputing, that scale more efficiently than the best known constructions in\nliterature. Our method emphasizes the minimization of non-transversal gates,\nparticularly T-gates, critical for fault-tolerant quantum computing. We\nconstruct circuits requiring $\\mathcal{O}(n|B|)$ CX gates and $\\mathcal{O}(n\n|B| + \\log(|B|) \\log (1/\\epsilon))$ T-gates, where $n$ is the number of qubits,\n$|B|$ the dimension of the projected subspace, and $\\epsilon$ the desired\napproximation precision.

Fully soft robots often suffer from\nstructural fragility and delayed sensory processing, limiting their practical\nfunctionality. The musculoskeletal system combines the adaptability of soft\nmaterials with the durability of rigid-body robots. It also leverages\nmorphological computation, where the morphological structures contribute to\ninformation processing, for dynamic and adaptive behaviors. This study focuses\non the pecking behaviors of birds, which enables precise haptic perception\nthrough the musculoskeletal system of their flexible neck. Physical reservoir\ncomputing is applied to flexible structures inspired by an ostrich neck to\nanalyze the relationship between haptic perception and physical\ncharacteristics. Experiments with both a physical robot and simulations reveal\nthat, with appropriate viscoelasticity, the flexible structure can discriminate\nobject softness and retain that information through behavior. Drawing on these\nfindings and anatomical insights from the ostrich neck, a haptic perception\nsystem is proposed that exhibits both separability and behavioral memory in\nflexible structures, enabling rapid learning and real-time inference.

We introduce\na constrained optimization method for simultaneous camera pose estimation and\n3D reconstruction that does not require SfM support. Core to our approach is\ndecomposing a camera pose into a sequence of camera-to-(device-)center and\n(device-)center-to-world optimizations. To facilitate, we propose two\noptimization constraints conditioned to the sensitivity of each parameter group\nand restricts each parameter's search space. In addition, as we learn the scene\ngeometry directly from the noisy point clouds, we propose geometric constraints\nto improve the reconstruction quality.

    "abstract": "The Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) method is a widely used numerical\ntechnique for solving Maxwell's equations, particularly in computational\nelectromagnetics and photonics. It enables accurate modeling of wave\npropagation in complex media and structures but comes with significant\ncomputational challenges. Traditional FDTD implementations rely on handwritten,\nplatform-specific code that optimizes certain kernels while underperforming in\nothers. The lack of portability increases development overhead and creates\nperformance bottlenecks, limiting scalability across modern hardware\narchitectures. To address these challenges, we introduce an end-to-end\ndomain-specific compiler based on the MLIR/LLVM infrastructure for FDTD\nsimulations. Our approach generates efficient and portable code optimized for\ndiverse hardware platforms.We implement the three-dimensional FDTD kernel as\noperations on a 3D tensor abstraction with explicit computational semantics.\nHigh-level optimizations such as loop tiling, fusion, and vectorization are\nautomatically applied by the compiler. We evaluate our customized code\ngeneration pipeline on Intel, AMD, and ARM platforms, achieving up to\n$10\\times$ speedup over baseline Python implementation using NumPy.",

In our\nsetting, we assume that our communication network consists of unreliable\ncommunication links (i.e., links suffering from packet drops). For countering\nlink unreliability our algorithm leverages narrowband error-free feedback\nchannels for acknowledging whether a packet transmission between nodes was\nsuccessful. Additionally, we show that the feedback channels play a crucial\nrole in enabling our algorithm to exhibit finite-time convergence. We analyze\nour algorithm and demonstrate its operation via an example, where we illustrate\nits operational advantages. Finally, simulations corroborate that our proposed\nalgorithm converges to the average of the initial quantized values in a finite\nnumber of steps, despite the packet losses. This is the first quantized\nconsensus algorithm in the literature that can handle packet losses and\nconverge to the average.

Log-based Anomaly Detection (LAD) is\nthe most representative technique used in different systems for attack\ndetection and safety guarantee, where multiple LAD methods and relevant\ndatasets have been proposed. However, even though some of these datasets are\nspecifically prepared for cloud systems, they only cover limited cloud\nbehaviors and lack information from a whole-system perspective. Another\ncritical issue to consider is normality shift, which implies that the test\ndistribution could differ from the training distribution and highly affect the\nperformance of LAD. Unfortunately, existing works only focus on simple shift\ntypes such as chronological changes, while other cloud-specific shift types are\nignored. Therefore, a dataset that captures diverse cloud system behaviors and\nvarious types of normality shifts is essential.\n  To fill this gap, we construct a dataset CAShift to evaluate the performance\nof LAD in cloud, which considers different roles of software in cloud systems,\nsupports three real-world normality shift types and features 20 different\nattack scenarios in various cloud system components. Based on CAShift, we\nevaluate the effectiveness of existing LAD methods in normality shift\nscenarios. Additionally, to explore the feasibility of shift adaptation, we\nfurther investigate three continuous learning approaches to mitigate the impact\nof distribution shift. Results demonstrated that 1) all LAD methods suffer from\nnormality shift where the performance drops up to 34%, and 2) existing\ncontinuous learning methods are promising to address shift drawbacks, but the\nconfigurations highly affect the shift adaptation.

The role of inertial spin dynamics in governing the\nmotion of Skyrmion, a topological spin texture, is elucidated. Using\nnonequilibrium Green's function Keldysh formalism, an equation of motion is\nderived in terms of collective coordinates for a Skyrmion coupled via a\n''minimal coupling'' to a bath of harmonic oscillators of frequency $\\omega$. A\ndeterministic and non-dissipative dynamics equation of motion is obtained with\nan explicit mass term for the Skyrmion emerging due the coupling, even within\nrigid Skyrmion picture. This results in a cyclotronic motion of Skyrmion, with\na frequency that can go ultrafast, depending on that of the oscillator.\nControlling the oscillator frequency can therefore guide the Skyrmion dynamics.\nOur theory bridges inertial dynamics and topology in magnetism and opens a\npathway to ultrafast control of topological spin textures.",

Estimating the interaction functions of\nsuch systems from data offers a direct path to understanding and predicting\nsuch dynamics. Existing Fourier-series-based methods encounter difficulties\nwith limited or biased data. To overcome this, we employ Gaussian process\nregression with additive periodic kernels.

Furthermore, owing to the\nBayesian framework, our method enables the evaluation of uncertainty in the\nestimation results. We validate our approach on Van der Pol, FitzHugh-Nagumo,\nand spiking neural models. Our approach outperforms Fourier-series baselines in\nboth error and stability under biased phase sampling.

In particular, it\n  states that any $N$-letter $g$-word such that $\\#\\{j:L_j=T_g\\}=n\\ge 1$ is\nbounded on $A^p_{\\omega^{p/2}}$ if and only if $g$ satisfies the \"fractional\"\nBloch-type condition \\[ \\|g\\|_{\\mathcal{B}^s_\\varphi}^s=\n\\sup_{z\\in\\mathbb{D}}\\frac{s|g(z)|^{s-1}|g'(z)|}{1+\\varphi'(|z|)} <\\infty, \\]\n  where $s=\\frac{N}{n}$, and $\\|L\\|_{A^p_{\\omega^{p/2}}}\\simeq\n\\|g\\|_{\\mathcal{B}^s_\\varphi}^N$.\n  The class of smooth rapidly decreasing weights contains\n  the radial weights \\begin{equation*}\n\\omega_n(z)=e^{-2\\exp_{n}(g_{\\alpha,c}(|z|))}, \\quad\\mbox{where}\\quad\ng_{\\alpha,c}(r)=\\tfrac{c}{(1-r^2)^{\\alpha}}, \\quad\\mbox{for $c,\\alpha>0$,}\n\\end{equation*} $\\exp_0(x)=x$ and $\\exp_n(x)=e^{\\exp_{n-1}(x)}$, for\n$n\\in\\mathbb{N}$. Therefore it contains\n  weights which decrease arbitrarily rapidly to zero as $|z|\\to 1^-$.",

    "abstract": "While most prior research has focused on improving the precision of\nmultimodal trajectory predictions, the explicit modeling of multimodal\nbehavioral intentions (e.g., yielding, overtaking) remains relatively\nunderexplored. This paper proposes a unified framework that jointly predicts\nboth behavioral intentions and trajectories to enhance prediction accuracy,\ninterpretability, and efficiency. Specifically, we employ a shared context\nencoder for both intention and trajectory predictions, thereby reducing\nstructural redundancy and information loss. Moreover, we address the lack of\nground-truth behavioral intention labels in mainstream datasets (Waymo,\nArgoverse) by auto-labeling these datasets, thus advancing the community's\nefforts in this direction. We further introduce a vectorized occupancy\nprediction module that infers the probability of each map polyline being\noccupied by the target vehicle's future trajectory. By leveraging these\nintention and occupancy prediction priors, our method conducts dynamic,\nmodality-dependent pruning of irrelevant agents and map polylines in the\ndecoding stage, effectively reducing computational overhead and mitigating\nnoise from non-critical elements. Our approach ranks first among LiDAR-free\nmethods on the Waymo Motion Dataset and achieves first place on the Waymo\nInteractive Prediction Dataset. Remarkably, even without model ensembling, our\nsingle-model framework improves the soft mean average precision (softmAP) by 10\npercent compared to the second-best method in the Waymo Interactive Prediction\nLeaderboard. Furthermore, the proposed framework has been successfully deployed\non real vehicles, demonstrating its practical effectiveness in real-world\napplications.",

    "abstract": "In modern air traffic management, generating synthetic flight trajectories\nhas emerged as a promising solution for addressing data scarcity, protecting\nsensitive information, and supporting large-scale analyses. In this paper, we\npropose a novel method for trajectory synthesis by adapting the Time-Based\nVector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (TimeVQVAE). Our approach leverages\ntime-frequency domain processing, vector quantization, and transformer-based\npriors to capture both global and local dynamics in flight data. By\ndiscretizing the latent space and integrating transformer priors, the model\nlearns long-range spatiotemporal dependencies and preserves coherence across\nentire flight paths. We evaluate the adapted TimeVQVAE using an extensive suite\nof quality, statistical, and distributional metrics, as well as a flyability\nassessment conducted in an open-source air traffic simulator. Results indicate\nthat TimeVQVAE outperforms a temporal convolutional VAE baseline, generating\nsynthetic trajectories that mirror real flight data in terms of spatial\naccuracy, temporal consistency, and statistical properties. Furthermore, the\nsimulator-based assessment shows that most generated trajectories maintain\noperational feasibility, although occasional outliers underscore the potential\nneed for additional domain-specific constraints. Overall, our findings\nunderscore the importance of multi-scale representation learning for capturing\ncomplex flight behaviors and demonstrate the promise of TimeVQVAE in producing\nrepresentative synthetic trajectories for downstream tasks such as model\ntraining, airspace design, and air traffic forecasting.",

Existing brain network analysis methods primarily focus on\ngraph-based models that rely solely on imaging data, which may overlook\nimportant non-imaging factors and limit the model's predictive power and\ninterpretability. In this paper, we present BrainPrompt, an innovative\nframework that enhances Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) by integrating Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) with knowledge-driven prompts, enabling more effective\ncapture of complex, non-imaging information and external knowledge for\nneurological disease identification. BrainPrompt integrates three types of\nknowledge-driven prompts: (1) ROI-level prompts to encode the identity and\nfunction of each brain region, (2) subject-level prompts that incorporate\ndemographic information, and (3) disease-level prompts to capture the temporal\nprogression of disease. By leveraging these multi-level prompts, BrainPrompt\neffectively harnesses knowledge-enhanced multi-modal information from LLMs,\nenhancing the model's capability to predict neurological disease stages and\nmeanwhile offers more interpretable results. We evaluate BrainPrompt on two\nresting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) datasets from\nneurological disorders, showing its superiority over state-of-the-art methods.\nAdditionally, a biomarker study demonstrates the framework's ability to extract\nvaluable and interpretable information aligned with domain knowledge in\nneuroscience.

Despite recent advances, there is no\ncomprehensive pipeline yet for bimanual class-agnostic interaction\nreconstruction from a monocular RGB video, where two hands and an unknown\nobject are interacting with each other. Previous works tackled the limited\nhand-object interaction case, where object templates are pre-known or only one\nhand is involved in the interaction. The bimanual interaction reconstruction\nexhibits severe occlusions introduced by complex interactions between two hands\nand an object. To solve this, we first introduce BIGS (Bimanual Interaction 3D\nGaussian Splatting), a method that reconstructs 3D Gaussians of hands and an\nunknown object from a monocular video. To robustly obtain object Gaussians\navoiding severe occlusions, we leverage prior knowledge of pre-trained\ndiffusion model with score distillation sampling (SDS) loss, to reconstruct\nunseen object parts. For hand Gaussians, we exploit the 3D priors of hand model\n(i.e., MANO) and share a single Gaussian for two hands to effectively\naccumulate hand 3D information, given limited views. To further consider the 3D\nalignment between hands and objects, we include the interacting-subjects\noptimization step during Gaussian optimization. Our method achieves the\nstate-of-the-art accuracy on two challenging datasets, in terms of 3D hand pose\nestimation (MPJPE), 3D object reconstruction (CDh, CDo, F10), and rendering\nquality (PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS), respectively.",

Current diagnostic\napproaches face notable limitations when applied across different aircraft\ntypes, particularly for newer models that lack sufficient operational data. To\naddress these challenges, this paper presents a self-supervised learning-based\nfoundation model that enables the transfer of diagnostic knowledge from mature\naircraft (e.g., A320, A330) to newer ones (e.g., C919). Leveraging\nself-supervised pretraining, the model learns universal feature representations\nfrom flight signals without requiring labeled data, making it effective in\ndata-scarce scenarios. This model enhances both anomaly detection and baseline\nsignal prediction, thereby improving system reliability. The paper introduces a\ncross-model dataset, a self-supervised learning framework for BAS diagnostics,\nand a novel Joint Baseline and Anomaly Detection Loss Function tailored to\nreal-world flight data. These innovations facilitate efficient transfer of\ndiagnostic knowledge across aircraft types, ensuring robust support for early\noperational stages of new models. Additionally, the paper explores the\nrelationship between model capacity and transferability, providing a foundation\nfor future research on large-scale flight signal models.",

Similar cases in the literature are\nattributed to poorly understood intrinsic processes. Our goal is to confirm or\nrefute the presence of planets around these ten evolved stars. Additionally, we\nevaluate the reliability and sensitivity of planet-confirmation metrics when\napplied to giant stars and present cases of intrinsically induced radial\nvelocity variations, aiming to enhance the physical understanding of the\nphenomenon. We combined 25 years of radial velocity data from the\nHamilton/Lick, SONG, and CARMENES spectrographs. To assess consistency with\nKeplerian models, we examined the residuals and tracked changes in statistical\nsignificance as new data were incorporated. Additionally, we compared radial\nvelocity amplitudes across optical and infrared wavelengths, searched for\nperiodic variations of activity indicators, and examined their correlations\nwith radial velocities. Seven of the ten giants exhibit intrinsically induced\nradial velocity variations. The strongest arguments against planets orbiting\nthe giants are guided by long-term radial velocity monitoring that detects\nchanging periodicity on long timescales or detects systematics close to the\noriginal period in the radial velocity residuals. While activity indicators\noffer some support, their signals are generally weak. Comparing optical and\ninfrared radial velocity amplitudes also proves insufficient for confirming or\nrefuting planets. We find HIP 64823 remains a promising candidate for hosting a\ngiant exoplanet with orbital period $P\\sim$ 7.75 yr. For two stars, the\nevidence remains inconclusive. Long-term radial velocity monitoring is\nessential for distinguishing planetary companions from intrinsic variations in\nevolved stars.",

In this study, we consider an\nadditional food provided prey-predator model exhibiting Holling type-IV\nfunctional response and the intra-specific competition among predators. We\nprove the existence and uniqueness of global positive solutions for the\nproposed model. We study the existence and stability of equilibrium points and\nfurther explore the codimension-$1$ and $2$ bifurcations with respect to the\nadditional food and competition. We further study the global dynamics of the\nsystem and discuss the consequences of providing additional food. Later, we do\nthe time-optimal control studies with respect to the quality and quantity of\nadditional food as control variables by transforming the independent variable\nin the control system. Making use of the Pontraygin maximum principle, we\ncharacterize the optimal quality of additional food and optimal quantity of\nadditional food. We show that the findings of these dynamics and control\nstudies have the potential to be applied to a variety of problems in pest\nmanagement.",

In this study, we build upon and\nimprove previous work exploring the complementarity between different\narchitectures. Instead of heuristically merging modules from various\narchitectures through trial and error, we preserve the integrity of each\narchitecture and combine them using ensemble techniques. By maintaining the\ndistinctiveness of each architecture, we aim to explore their inherent\ncomplementarity more deeply and with implicit isolation. This approach provides\na more systematic understanding of their individual strengths.\n  In addition to uncovering insights into architectural complementarity, we\nshowcase the effectiveness of even basic ensemble methods that combine models\nfrom diverse architectures. These methods outperform ensembles comprised of\nsimilar architectures. Our straightforward ensemble framework serves as a\nfoundational strategy for blending complementary architectures, offering a\nsolid starting point for further investigations into the unique strengths and\nsynergies among different architectures and their ensembles in image\nclassification.

Data prefetching is a key strategy to address this, with\ntraditional methods evolving to incorporate Machine Learning (ML) for improved\naccuracy. Modern prefetchers must balance high accuracy with low latency to\nfurther practicality. We explore the applicability of utilizing\nKolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) with learnable activation functions,a\nprefetcher we implemented called KANBoost, to further this aim. KANs are a\nnovel, state-of-the-art model that work on breaking down continuous, bounded\nmulti-variate functions into functions of their constituent variables, and use\nthese constitutent functions as activations on each individual neuron. KANBoost\npredicts the next memory access by modeling deltas between consecutive\naddresses, offering a balance of accuracy and efficiency to mitigate the memory\nwall problem with minimal overhead, instead of relying on address-correlation\nprefetching. Initial results indicate that KAN-based prefetching reduces\ninference latency (18X lower than state-of-the-art ML prefetchers) while\nachieving moderate IPC improvements (2.5\\% over no-prefetching). While KANs\nstill face challenges in capturing long-term dependencies, we propose that\nfuture research should explore hybrid models that combine KAN efficiency with\nstronger sequence modeling techniques, paving the way for practical ML-based\nprefetching in edge devices and beyond.",

However, panoramic images introduce severe\ndistortion, making it challenging to render 3D Gaussians into 2D distorted\nequirectangular space directly. Converting equirectangular images to cubemap\nprojections partially alleviates this problem but introduces new challenges,\nsuch as projection distortion and discontinuities across cube-face boundaries.\nTo address these limitations, we present a novel framework, named TPGS, to\nbridge continuous panoramic 3D scene reconstruction with perspective Gaussian\nsplatting. Firstly, we introduce a Transition Plane between adjacent cube faces\nto enable smoother transitions in splatting directions and mitigate\noptimization ambiguity in the boundary region. Moreover, an intra-to-inter face\noptimization strategy is proposed to enhance local details and restore visual\nconsistency across cube-face boundaries. Specifically, we optimize 3D Gaussians\nwithin individual cube faces and then fine-tune them in the stitched panoramic\nspace. Additionally, we introduce a spherical sampling technique to eliminate\nvisible stitching seams.

Specifically, we analyze the\nassociated autonomous system, focusing on its fixed points that represent dark\nenergy and scaling solutions, along with their stability conditions. We employ\ncenter manifold theory to address cases where some fixed points display\neigenvalues with zero and negative real parts. The model reveals attractors\ndescribing dark energy, enabling a smooth transition from the\nradiation-dominated era to the matter-dominated era, and ultimately into the\ndark-energy-dominated phase. Additionally, we identify a scaling matter\nsolution capable of modifying the growth rate of matter perturbations during\nthe matter-dominated epoch. Consequently, we study the evolution of matter\nperturbations by obtaining both analytical and numerical solutions to the\ndensity contrast evolution equation. Based on these results, we compute\nnumerical solutions for the weighted growth rate $f\\sigma_{8}$, indicating that\ninteracting $\\alpha$-attractor dark energy models may provide a better fit to\nstructure formation data than the standard $\\Lambda$CDM scenario.",

In light of the widespread adoption of\nLarge Language Models (LLMs), the intersection of humor and AI has become no\nlaughing matter. Advancements in the naturalness of human-computer interaction\ncorrelates with improvements in AI systems' abilities to understand humor. In\nthis study, we assess the ability of models in accurately identifying humorous\nquotes from a stand-up comedy transcript. Stand-up comedy's unique comedic\nnarratives make it an ideal dataset to improve the overall naturalness of\ncomedic understanding. We propose a novel humor detection metric designed to\nevaluate LLMs amongst various prompts on their capability to extract humorous\npunchlines. The metric has a modular structure that offers three different\nscoring methods - fuzzy string matching, sentence embedding, and subspace\nsimilarity - to provide an overarching assessment of a model's performance. The\nmodel's results are compared against those of human evaluators on the same\ntask. Our metric reveals that regardless of prompt engineering, leading models,\nChatGPT, Claude, and DeepSeek, achieve scores of at most 51% in humor\ndetection.

This model not only\nlearns spatiotemporal individual features but also learns the correlation with\nfull attention structures specialized in ADHD diagnosis. In particular, it\nfocuses on learning local blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signals and\ndistinguishing important regions of interest (ROI) in the brain. Specifically,\nthe three proposed methods for ADHD diagnosis transformer are as follows.\nFirst, we design a CNN-based embedding block to obtain more expressive\nembedding features in brain region attention. It is reconstructed based on the\npreviously CNN-based ADHD diagnosis models for the transformer. Next, for\nindividual spatiotemporal feature attention, we change the attention method to\nlocal temporal attention and ROI-rank based masking. For the temporal features\nof fMRI, the local temporal attention enables to learn local BOLD signal\nfeatures with only simple window masking. For the spatial feature of fMRI,\nROI-rank based masking can distinguish ROIs with high correlation in ROI\nrelationships based on attention scores, thereby providing a more specific\nbiomarker for ADHD diagnosis. The experiment was conducted with various types\nof transformer models. To evaluate these models, we collected the data from 939\nindividuals from all sites provided by the ADHD-200 competition.

The lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) is a drastically simplified\ndiscretization of the Boltzmann equation. We construct two new FP-based LBMs,\none for recovering the Navier-Stokes equations and the other for simulating the\nenergy equation, where, in each case, the effect of collisions is represented\nas relaxations of different central moments to their respective attractors.\nSuch attractors are obtained by matching the changes in various discrete\ncentral moments under collision with the continuous central moments prescribed\nby the FP model. As such, the resulting central moment attractors depend on the\nlower order moments and the diffusion tensor parameters and significantly\ndiffer from those based on the Maxwell distribution. The diffusion tensor\nparameters for evolving higher moments in simulating fluid motions at\nrelatively low viscosities are chosen based on a renormalization principle. The\nuse of such central moment formulations in modeling the collision step offers\nsignificant improvements in numerical stability, especially for simulations of\nthermal convective flows with a wide range of variations in the transport\ncoefficients.

The RV distribution of the members peaks at 5.0 km/s with a\ndispersion of 1.4 km/s, while the average metallicity is [Fe/H]=-0.03$\\pm$0.06,\nin line with previous determinations. Fitting empirical Lithium isochrones, we\nobtain a reliable age for the Pleiades of 118$\\pm$6 Myr, in agreement with the\nrecent literature. The activity indicators H$\\alpha$ line flux (Fha) and\nluminosity ratio (R'ha) show the hottest stars to be the less active ones. The\nR'ha values display the typical activity-rotation trend with the Rossby number\nwith a steep decay for $R_{\\rm O}\\geq$0.2 and a nearly flat (saturated)\nactivity level for smaller values. However, we still see a slight dependence on\n$R_{\\rm O}$ in the saturated regime which is well fitted by a power law with a\nslope of $-0.18\\pm0.02$, in agreement with some previous work.

We derive an algebraically exact, additive, and\nhierarchical decomposition of the KL divergence between a joint distribution\nP(X1,...,Xn) and a standard product reference distribution Q(X1,...,Xn) =\nproduct_i q(Xi), where variables are assumed independent and identically\ndistributed according to a common reference q. The total divergence precisely\nsplits into two primary components: (1) the summed divergence of each marginal\ndistribution Pi(Xi) from the common reference q(Xi), quantifying marginal\ndeviations; and (2) the total correlation (or multi-information), capturing the\ntotal statistical dependency among variables. Leveraging Mobius inversion on\nthe subset lattice, we further decompose this total correlation term into a\nhierarchy of signed contributions from distinct pairwise, triplet, and\nhigher-order statistical interactions, expressed using standard Shannon\ninformation quantities. This decomposition provides an algebraically complete\nand interpretable breakdown of KL divergence using established information\nmeasures, requiring no approximations or model assumptions. Numerical\nvalidation using hypergeometric sampling confirms the decomposition's exactness\nto machine precision across diverse system configurations.",

Recently, Jain and Mani (in Annual\nResearch Briefs, CTR, Stanford University, 2022) circumvented this issue by\napplying a variable transformation, which effectively leads to a generalized\ninterface-bound scalar transport equation with an additional interfacial\nconfining flux term. The resulting formulation has similarities with the\nconservative Allen-Cahn equation (CACE) used for tracking of interfaces. In\nthis paper, we will discuss a novel robust central moment lattice Boltzmann\n(LB) method to simulate the interface-bound advection-diffusion transport\nequation of a scalar field proposed in Teigen et al. by applying Jain and\nMani's transformation. It is coupled with another LB scheme for the CACE to\ncompute the evolving interfaces, and the resulting algorithm is validated\nagainst some benchmark problems available in the literature. As further\nextension, we have coupled it with our central moment LB flow solver for the\ntwo-fluid motions, which is modulated by the Marangoni stresses resulting from\nthe variation of the surface tension with the local surfactant concentration\nmodeled via the Langmuir isotherm. This is then validated by simulating\ninsoluble surfactant-laden drop deformation and break-up in a shear flow at\nvarious capillary numbers.",

An emulsion droplet of fixed\nvolume therefore tends to form a sphere, and pairs of droplets tend to\ncoalesce. Surfactant molecules adsorbed to the droplets' surfaces stabilize\nemulsions by providing a kinetic barrier to coalescence. Here, we show that the\nbound surfactants' osmotic pressure also competes with the droplet's intrinsic\nsurface tension and can reverse the sign of the overall surface free energy.\nThe onset of negative surface tension favors maximizing surface area and\ntherefore favors elongation into a worm-like morphology. Analyzing this system\nin the Gibbs grand canonical ensemble reveals a phase transition between\nspherical and worm-like emulsions that is governed by the chemical potential of\nsurfactant molecules in solution. Predictions based on this model agree with\nthe observed behavior of an experimental model system composed of\nlipid-stabilized silicone oil droplets in an aqueous surfactant solution.",

    "abstract": "Laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) is a widely recognized additive manufacturing\ntechnology for producing intricate metal components with exceptional accuracy.\nA key challenge in L-PBF is the formation of complex microstructures affecting\nproduct quality. We propose a physics-guided, machine-learning approach to\noptimize scan paths for desired microstructure outcomes, such as equiaxed\ngrains. We utilized a phase-field method (PFM) to model crystalline grain\nstructure evolution. To reduce computational costs, we trained a surrogate\nmachine learning model, a 3D U-Net convolutional neural network, using\nsingle-track phase-field simulations with various laser powers to predict\ncrystalline grain orientations based on initial microstructure and thermal\nhistory. We investigated three scanning strategies across various hatch\nspacings within a square domain, achieving a two-orders-of-magnitude speedup\nusing the surrogate model. To reduce trial and error in designing laser scan\ntoolpaths, we used deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to generate optimized scan\npaths for target microstructure. Results from three cases demonstrate the DRL\napproach's effectiveness. We integrated the surrogate 3D U-Net model into our\nDRL environment to accelerate the reinforcement learning training process. The\nreward function minimizes both aspect ratio and grain volume of the predicted\nmicrostructure from the agent's scan path. The reinforcement learning algorithm\nwas benchmarked against conventional zigzag approach for smaller and larger\ndomains, showing machine learning methods' potential to enhance microstructure\ncontrol and computational efficiency in L-PBF optimization.",

    "abstract": "Cooperative missions involving Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in dynamic\nenvironments pose significant challenges in ensuring both coordination and\nagility. In this paper, we introduce a novel game-theoretic approach for\ntime-critical missions, where each UAV optimizes a cost function that\nincorporates temporal and mission-specific constraints. The optimization is\nperformed within a one-dimensional domain, significantly reducing the\ncomputational cost and enabling real-time application to complex and dynamic\nscenarios. The framework is distributed in structure, allowing to achieve\nglobal, system-wide coordination (a Nash equilibrium) by using only local\ninformation. For ideal systems, we prove the existence and exponential\nstability of the Nash equilibrium. Furthermore, we invoke model predictive\ncontrol (MPC) for non-ideal scenarios. In particular, we propose a\ndiscrete-time optimization approach that tackles path-following errors and\ncommunication failures, ensuring reliable and agile performance in dynamic and\nuncertain environments. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and\nagility of the approach in ensuring successful mission execution across diverse\nscenarios. Experiments using a motion capture system provide further validation\nunder realistic conditions.",

To\naddress this limitation, we introduce a vision-based autonomous racing agent\nthat relies solely on ego-centric camera views and onboard sensor data,\neliminating the need for precise localization during inference. This agent\nemploys an asymmetric actor-critic framework: the actor uses a recurrent neural\nnetwork with the sensor data local to the car to retain track layouts and\nopponent positions, while the critic accesses the global features during\ntraining. Evaluated in GT7, our agent consistently outperforms GT7's\nbuilt-drivers.

By comparing\nthese results with those obtained from perturbation theory in the antiadiabatic\nlimit, we demonstrate that this anomalous feature is a remnant of the strong\nelectron-electron interaction mediated by the SSH coupling previously derived\nin the two-particle limit.

We close this knowledge gap by empirically measuring the extent to\nwhich servers and routers that process EU requests are located outside of the\nEU (and a handful of ``adequate'' non-EU countries). The key challenge is that\nboth browser measurements (to infer relevant endpoints) and data-plane\nmeasurements (to infer relevant IP addresses) are needed, but no large-scale\npublic infrastructure allows both. We build a novel methodology that combines\nBrightData (browser) and RIPE Atlas (data-plane) probes, with joint\nmeasurements from over 1,000 networks in 19 EU countries. We find that, on\naverage, 2.3% of servers serving users in each EU country are located in\nnon-adequate destination countries (1.4% of known trackers).

    "abstract": "Virtual YouTubers (VTubers) are avatar-based livestreamers that are voiced\nand played by human actors. VTubers have been popular in East Asia for years\nand have more recently seen widespread international growth. Despite their\nemergent popularity, research has been scarce into the interactions and\nrelationships that exist between avatarized VTubers and their viewers,\nparticularly in contrast to non-avatarized streamers. To address this gap, we\nperformed in-depth interviews with self-reported VTuber viewers (n=21). Our\nfindings first reveal that the avatarized nature of VTubers fosters new forms\nof theatrical engagement, as factors of the virtual blend with the real to\ncreate a mixture of fantasy and realism in possible livestream interactions.\nAvatarization furthermore results in a unique audience perception regarding the\nidentity of VTubers - an identity which comprises a dynamic, distinct mix of\nthe real human (the voice actor/actress) and the virtual character. Our\nfindings suggest that each of these dual identities both individually and\nsymbiotically affect viewer interactions and relationships with VTubers.\nWhereas the performer's identity mediates social factors such as intimacy,\nrelatability, and authenticity, the virtual character's identity offers\nfeelings of escapism, novelty in interactions, and a sense of continuity beyond\nthe livestream. We situate our findings within existing livestreaming\nliterature to highlight how avatarization drives unique, character-based\ninteractions as well as reshapes the motivations and relationships that viewers\nform with livestreamers. Finally, we provide suggestions and recommendations\nfor areas of future exploration to address the challenges involved in present\nlivestreamed avatarized entertainment.",

We investigate the potential of spatial\ninteraction on the livestreamed video content as a form of direct, real-time\ninput for livestreamed applications. We developed VIBES, a flexible digital\nsystem that registers viewers' mouse interactions on the streamed video, i.e.,\nclicks or movements, and transmits it directly into the streamed application.\nWe used VIBES as a technology probe; first designing possible demonstrative\ninteractions and using these interactions to explore streamers' perception of\nviewer influence and possible challenges and opportunities. We then deployed\napplications built using VIBES in two livestreams to explore its effects on\naudience engagement and investigate their relationships with the stream, the\nstreamer, and fellow audience members. The use of spatial interactions enhances\nengagement and participation and opens up new avenues for both streamer-viewer\nand viewer-viewer participation.
