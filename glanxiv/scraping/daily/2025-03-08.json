    "abstract": "Self-supervised learning (SSL) has advanced significantly in visual\nrepresentation learning, yet comprehensive evaluations of its adversarial\nrobustness remain limited. In this study, we evaluate the adversarial\nrobustness of seven discriminative self-supervised models and one supervised\nmodel across diverse tasks, including ImageNet classification, transfer\nlearning, segmentation, and detection. Our findings suggest that discriminative\nSSL models generally exhibit better robustness to adversarial attacks compared\nto their supervised counterpart on ImageNet, with this advantage extending to\ntransfer learning when using linear evaluation. However, when fine-tuning is\napplied, the robustness gap between SSL and supervised models narrows\nconsiderably. Similarly, this robustness advantage diminishes in segmentation\nand detection tasks. We also investigate how various factors might influence\nadversarial robustness, including architectural choices, training duration,\ndata augmentations, and batch sizes. Our analysis contributes to the ongoing\nexploration of adversarial robustness in visual self-supervised representation\nsystems.",

    "abstract": "The one-dimensional (1D) Stefan problem is a prototypical heat and mass\ntransfer problem that analyzes the temperature distribution in a material\nundergoing phase change. In addition, it describes the evolution of the phase\nchange front within the phase change material (PCM). Analytical solutions to\nthe two-phase Stefan problem that describe melting of a solid or boiling of a\nliquid have been extensively discussed in the literature. Density change\neffects and associated fluid flow phenomena during phase change are typically\nignored to simplify the analysis. As the PCM boils or condenses, it undergoes a\ndensity change of 1000 or more. The effects of density changes and convection\ncannot be ignored when dealing with such problems. In our recent work, we found\nanalytical solutions to the two-phase Stefan problem that account for a jump in\nthe thermophysical properties of the two phases, including density. In the\npresent work, we extend our prior analyses to obtain analytical solutions to\nthe three-phase Stefan problem in which an initially solid PCM melts and boils\nunder imposed temperature conditions. This scenario is typical of metal\nadditive manufacturing (AM) and welding processes, wherein a high-power laser\nmelts and boils the metal powder or substrate. While deriving the analytical\nsolution, all relevant jump conditions, including density and kinetic energy,\nare accounted for. It is shown that the three-phase Stefan problem admits\nsimilarity transformations and similarity solutions. To our knowledge, this is\nthe first work that presents an analytical solution to the three-phase Stefan\nproblem with simultaneous melting, solidification, boiling, and condensation\n(MSNBC). Furthermore, we describe a numerical method for solving the\nthree-phase Stefan problem with second-order accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Real-time computer-based accompaniment for human musical performances entails\nthree critical tasks: identifying what the performer is playing, locating their\nposition within the score, and synchronously playing the accompanying parts.\nAmong these, the second task (score following) has been addressed through\nmethods such as dynamic programming on string sequences, Hidden Markov Models\n(HMMs), and Online Time Warping (OLTW). Yet, the remarkably successful\ntechniques of Deep Learning (DL) have not been directly applied to this\nproblem.\n  Therefore, we introduce HeurMiT, a novel DL-based score-following framework,\nutilizing a neural architecture designed to learn compressed latent\nrepresentations that enables precise performer tracking despite deviations from\nthe score. Parallelly, we implement a real-time MIDI data augmentation toolkit,\naimed at enhancing the robustness of these learned representations.\nAdditionally, we integrate the overall system with simple heuristic rules to\ncreate a comprehensive framework that can interface seamlessly with existing\ntranscription and accompaniment technologies.\n  However, thorough experimentation reveals that despite its impressive\ncomputational efficiency, HeurMiT's underlying limitations prevent it from\nbeing practical in real-world score following scenarios. Consequently, we\npresent our work as an introductory exploration into the world of DL-based\nscore followers, while highlighting some promising avenues to encourage future\nresearch towards robust, state-of-the-art neural score following systems.",

Although\nsingle-hidden-layer PIELMs outperform deep physics-informed neural networks\n(PINNs) in speed and accuracy for linear and quasilinear PDEs, their extension\nto nonlinear problems remains challenging. To address this, we introduce a\ncurriculum learning strategy that reformulates nonlinear PDEs as a sequence of\nincreasingly complex quasilinear PDEs. Additionally, our approach enables a\nphysically interpretable initialization of network parameters by leveraging\nRadial Basis Functions (RBFs). The performance of the proposed algorithms is\nvalidated on two benchmark incompressible flow problems: the viscous Burgers\nequation and lid-driven cavity flow. To the best of our knowledge, this is the\nfirst work to extend PIELM to solving Burgers' shock solution as well as\nlid-driven cavity flow up to a Reynolds number of 100. As a practical\napplication, we employ PIELM to predict blood flow in a stenotic vessel.

We demonstrate that this method\ncan implement digital zero-noise extrapolation (ZNE), a quantum error\nmitigation technique. By employing quantum circuit unoptimization as a form of\ncircuit folding, noise can be systematically amplified. The key advantages of\nthis approach are twofold. First, its ability to generate an exponentially\nincreasing number of distinct circuit variants as the noise level is amplified,\nwhich allows noise averaging over many circuit variants with slightly different\ncircuit structure. Averaging over these variants can mitigate the effect of\nbiased error propagation due to the significantly altered circuit structure\nfrom quantum circuit unoptimization, or biased noise sources on a quantum\nprocessor. Second, quantum circuit unoptimization by design resists circuit\nsimplification back to the original unmodified circuit, making it plausible to\nuse ZNE in contexts where circuit compiler optimization is applied server-side.\nWe evaluate the effectiveness of quantum circuit unoptimization as a\nnoise-scaling method for ZNE in two test cases using depolarizing noise\nnumerical simulations: random quantum volume circuits, where the observable is\nthe heavy output probability, and QAOA circuits for the (unweighted) maximum\ncut problem on random 3-regular graphs, where the observable is the cut value.\nWe show that using quantum circuit unoptimization to perform ZNE can\napproximately recover signal from noisy quantum simulations.",

Considering\nthe heavy cost of training MLLMs, it is necessary to reuse the existing ones\nand further extend them to more modalities through Modality-incremental\nContinual Learning (MCL). However, this often comes with a performance\ndegradation in the previously learned modalities. In this work, we revisit the\nMCL and investigate a more severe issue it faces in contrast to traditional\ncontinual learning, that its degradation comes not only from catastrophic\nforgetting but also from the misalignment between the modality-agnostic and\nmodality-specific components. To address this problem, we propose an elegantly\nsimple MCL paradigm called \"MErge then ReAlign\" (MERA). Our method avoids\nintroducing heavy training overhead or modifying the model architecture, hence\nis easy to deploy and highly reusable in the MLLM community. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that, despite the simplicity of MERA, it shows\nimpressive performance, holding up to a 99.84% Backward Relative Gain when\nextending to four modalities, achieving a nearly lossless MCL performance.",

However, its comparability to traditional\ncomputerized methods remains unclear. This study investigates the convergent\nvalidity, user experience, and usability of VR-based versus PC-based\nassessments of short-term and working memory, and psychomotor skills, while\nalso examining how demographic and IT-related skills influence performance in\nboth modalities. Methods: Sixty-six participants performed the Digit Span Task\n(DST), Corsi Block Task (CBT), and Deary-Liewald Reaction Time Task (DLRTT) in\nboth VR- and PC-based formats. Participants' experience in using computers and\nsmartphones, and playing videogames, was considered. User experience and system\nusability of the formats were also evaluated. Results: While performance on DST\nwas similar across modalities, PC assessments enabled better performance on CBT\nand faster reaction times in DLRTT. Moderate-to-strong correlations between VR\nand PC versions supported convergent validity. Regression analyses revealed\nthat performance on PC versions was influenced by age, computing, and gaming\nexperience, whereas performance on VR versions was largely independent of these\nfactors, except for gaming experience predicting performance on CBT backward\nrecall. Moreover, VR assessments received higher ratings for user experience\nand usability than PC-based assessments. Conclusion: Immersive VR assessments\nprovide an engaging alternative to traditional computerized methods, with\nminimal reliance on prior IT experience and demographic factors. This\nresilience to individual differences suggests that VR may offer a more\nequitable and accessible platform for cognitive assessment. Future research\nshould explore the long-term reliability of VR-based assessments.",

While\nclassical methods such as DeepWalk, node2vec, and graph convolutional networks\nlearn node embeddings by capturing structural and relational patterns in\ngraphs, they often require significant computational resources and struggle\nwith scalability on large graphs. Quantum computing provides a promising\nalternative for graph-based learning by leveraging quantum effects and\nintroducing novel optimization approaches. Variational quantum circuits and\nquantum kernel methods have been explored for embedding tasks, but their\nscalability remains limited due to the constraints of noisy intermediate-scale\nquantum (NISQ) hardware. In this paper, we investigate quantum annealing (QA)\nas an alternative approach that mitigates key challenges associated with\nquantum gate-based models. We propose several formulations of the node\nembedding problem as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO)\ninstance, making it compatible with current quantum annealers such as those\ndeveloped by D-Wave. We implement our algorithms on a D-Wave quantum annealer\nand evaluate their performance on graphs with up to 100 nodes and embedding\ndimensions of up to 5.

    "abstract": "Pediatric dental segmentation is critical in dental diagnostics, presenting\nunique challenges due to variations in dental structures and the lower number\nof pediatric X-ray images. This study proposes a custom SegUNet model with a\nVGG19 backbone, designed explicitly for pediatric dental segmentation and\napplied to the Children's Dental Panoramic Radiographs dataset. The SegUNet\narchitecture with a VGG19 backbone has been employed on this dataset for the\nfirst time, achieving state-of-the-art performance. The model reached an\naccuracy of 97.53%, a dice coefficient of 92.49%, and an intersection over\nunion (IOU) of 91.46%, setting a new benchmark for this dataset. These results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the VGG19 backbone in enhancing feature\nextraction and improving segmentation precision. Comprehensive evaluations\nacross metrics, including precision, recall, and specificity, indicate the\nrobustness of this approach. The model's ability to generalize across diverse\ndental structures makes it a valuable tool for clinical applications in\npediatric dental care.

Many real-world phenomena governed by nonlinear\ndifferential equations (DEs), such as fluid flow, exhibit multiple solutions\nunder the same conditions, yet capturing this solution multiplicity remains a\nsignificant challenge. A key difficulty is giving appropriate initial\nconditions or initial guesses, to which the widely used time-marching schemes\nand Newton's iteration method are very sensitive in finding solutions for\ncomplex computational problems. While machine learning models, particularly\nPINNs, have shown promise in solving DEs, their ability to capture multiple\nsolutions remains underexplored. In this work, we propose a simple and\npractical approach using PINNs to learn and discover multiple solutions. We\nfirst reveal that PINNs, when combined with random initialization and deep\nensemble method -- originally developed for uncertainty quantification -- can\neffectively uncover multiple solutions to nonlinear ordinary and partial\ndifferential equations (ODEs/PDEs). Our approach highlights the critical role\nof initialization in shaping solution diversity, addressing an often-overlooked\naspect of machine learning for scientific computing. Furthermore, we propose\nutilizing PINN-generated solutions as initial conditions or initial guesses for\nconventional numerical solvers to enhance accuracy and efficiency in capturing\nmultiple solutions. Extensive numerical experiments, including the Allen-Cahn\nequation and cavity flow, where our approach successfully identifies both\nstable and unstable solutions, validate the effectiveness of our method.

    "abstract": "Object detection in videos plays a crucial role in advancing applications\nsuch as public safety and anomaly detection. Existing methods have explored\ndifferent techniques, including CNN, deep learning, and Transformers, for\nobject detection and video classification. However, detecting tiny objects,\ne.g., guns, in videos remains challenging due to their small scale and varying\nappearances in complex scenes. Moreover, existing video analysis models for\nclassification or detection often perform poorly in real-world gun detection\nscenarios due to limited labeled video datasets for training. Thus, developing\nefficient methods for effectively capturing tiny object features and designing\nmodels capable of accurate gun detection in real-world videos is imperative. To\naddress these challenges, we make three original contributions in this paper.\nFirst, we conduct an empirical study of several existing video classification\nand object detection methods to identify guns in videos. Our extensive analysis\nshows that these methods may not accurately detect guns in videos. Second, we\npropose a novel two-stage gun detection method. In stage 1, we train an\nimage-augmented model to effectively classify ``Gun'' videos. To make the\ndetection more precise and efficient, stage 2 employs an object detection model\nto locate the exact region of the gun within video frames for videos classified\nas ``Gun'' by stage 1. Third, our experimental results demonstrate that the\nproposed domain-specific method achieves significant performance improvements\nand enhances efficiency compared with existing techniques. We also discuss\nchallenges and future research directions in gun detection tasks in computer\nvision.",

To address\nthese limitations, we propose Adaptive student-teacher Cooperative Attention\nMasking for Knowledge Distillation (ACAM-KD), which introduces two key\ncomponents: (1) Student-Teacher Cross-Attention Feature Fusion (STCA-FF), which\nadaptively integrates features from both models for a more interactive\ndistillation process, and (2) Adaptive Spatial-Channel Masking (ASCM), which\ndynamically generates importance masks to enhance both spatial and channel-wise\nfeature selection. Unlike conventional KD methods, ACAM-KD adapts to the\nstudent's evolving needs throughout the entire distillation process. Extensive\nexperiments on multiple benchmarks validate its effectiveness. For instance, on\nCOCO2017, ACAM-KD improves object detection performance by up to 1.4 mAP over\nthe state-of-the-art when distilling a ResNet-50 student from a ResNet-101\nteacher. For semantic segmentation on Cityscapes, it boosts mIoU by 3.09 over\nthe baseline with DeepLabV3-MobileNetV2 as the student model.",

These\ninteractions result in unique temporal behaviors we call underlying scenarios.\nThe signal data from all system components, which is recorded during runtime,\ncan be processed and analyzed by observing changes in their runtime. Different\nsystem behaviors can be characterized by dividing the whole data spectrum into\nappropriate segments with consistent behavior, classifying these segments, and\nmapping them to different scenarios. These disjunctive scenarios can be\nanalyzed for their specific behavior which may divert from the expected average\nsystem behavior. We state the emerging problem of data segmentation as follows:\ndivide a multivariate data set into a suitable amount of segments with\nconsistent internal behavior. The problem can be divided into 2 subproblems:\n\"How many segments are present in the data set?\", and \"What are good\nsegmentation indices for the underlying segments?\". The complexity of the\nproblem still needs to be assessed, however, at this point we expect it to be\nNP-hard, as both the number of segments and the segmentation points are\nunknown. We are in search of appropriate metrics to quantify the quality of a\ngiven segmentation of a whole data set. In this paper, we discuss the\nsegmentation of multivariate data, but not the classification of segments into\nscenario classes.

However, existing multimodal SemiSL methods\ntypically focus on unimodal or modality-shared features, ignoring valuable\ntask-relevant modality-specific information, leading to a Modality Information\nGap. In this paper, we propose STiL, a novel SemiSL tabular-image framework\nthat addresses this gap by comprehensively exploring task-relevant information.\nSTiL features a new disentangled contrastive consistency module to learn\ncross-modal invariant representations of shared information while retaining\nmodality-specific information via disentanglement. We also propose a novel\nconsensus-guided pseudo-labeling strategy to generate reliable pseudo-labels\nbased on classifier consensus, along with a new prototype-guided label\nsmoothing technique to refine pseudo-label quality with prototype embeddings,\nthereby enhancing task-relevant information learning in unlabeled data.\nExperiments on natural and medical image datasets show that STiL outperforms\nthe state-of-the-art supervised/SSL/SemiSL image/multimodal approaches.

However, their adversarial\nrobustness remains less underexplored, especially across different KAN\narchitectures. To explore this critical safety issue, we conduct an analysis\nand find that due to overfitting to the specific basis functions of KANs, they\npossess poor adversarial transferability among different KANs. To tackle this\nchallenge, we propose AdvKAN, the first transfer attack method for KANs. AdvKAN\nintegrates two key components: 1) a Breakthrough-Defense Surrogate Model\n(BDSM), which employs a breakthrough-defense training strategy to mitigate\noverfitting to the specific structures of KANs. 2) a Global-Local Interaction\n(GLI) technique, which promotes sufficient interaction between adversarial\ngradients of hierarchical levels, further smoothing out loss surfaces of KANs.\nBoth of them work together to enhance the strength of transfer attack among\ndifferent KANs. Extensive experimental results on various KANs and datasets\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of AdvKAN, which possesses notably superior\nattack capabilities and deeply reveals the vulnerabilities of KANs.

Specifically, we consider the linear model $f(R,T) = R\n+ 2\\lambda T$, where $\\lambda$ governs the interaction between matter and\ngeometry. Using this parametric form, we derive the Hubble parameter as a\nfunction of redshift $z$ and incorporate it into the modified Friedmann\nequations. Constraining the model with OHD and Pantheon data, we obtain precise\nestimates for $H_0$, the present deceleration parameter $q_0$, and its\nevolutionary component $q_1$, confirming a smooth transition between cosmic\ndeceleration and acceleration. Further, we analyze the evolution of the energy\ndensity $\\rho$ and total EoS parameter $\\omega$ for different $\\lambda$ values,\nhighlighting deviations from $\\Lambda$CDM and the role of $\\lambda$ in shaping\ncosmic dynamics.

The radio emission from\npulsars, fast radio bursts, and magnetars can be elliptically polarized, and\nestimators of the total polarization and absolute value of the circular\npolarization are used in their observations.

Among different radicals, the hydroxyl\n(OH) is one of the most important ones, with a rather specific chemistry. Aims.\nThe goal of this work is to simulate the recombination dynamics of hydroxyl\nradicals and the subsequent formation of hydrogen peroxide (H$_{2}$O$_{2}$).\nMthods. We employed neural network potentials trained on ONIOM(QM/QM) data,\ncombining multi-reference (CASPT2) and density functional theory (DFT)\ncalculations. This approach allows us to model the recombination of hydroxyl\nradicals on ice surfaces with high computational efficiency and accuracy.\nResults. Our simulations reveal that the initial position of the radicals plays\na decisive role in determining recombination probability. We found that the\nformation of hydrogen-bond between radicals, competes with the formation of\nhydrogen peroxide, reducing the recombination efficiency, contrary to\nexpectancy. This competition reduces the recombination probability for radicals\nthat are initially formed approximately 3 \\AA{} apart. Recombination\nprobabilities also depend on the kinetic energy of the added radicals, with\nvalues around 0.33 for thermal radicals and a wide range of values between 0.33\nand 1.00 for suprathermal OH radicals. Conclusions. Based on our calculations\nwe provide recommendations for introducing OH radical recombination into\nkinetic astrochemical models, differentiating between thermal and suprathermal\nradicals. The recombination behavior varies significantly between these two\ncases: while thermal radicals are sometimes trapped in hydrogen-bonded minima,\nthe case of suprathermal radicals varies with the added energy. Our most\nimportant conclusion is that OH radical recombination probability cannot be\nassumed 1.0 for a wide variety of cases.",

Several phase transitions must have occurred in\nneutron stars as well such as transitions from normal to\nsuperfluid/superconducting phases and crust formation. In this work, we extend\nthe superfluid band theory, which has been formulated in our previous work [K.\nYoshimura and K. Sekizawa, Phys. Rev. C 109, 065804 (2024)] based on the\nKohn-Sham density functional theory (DFT) for superfluid systems, into the\nfinite temperature and finite magnetic field systems.

We also reveal that these transition\ntemperatures exhibit a systematical dependence on the baryon densities. By\nturning on the magnetic field, we find that protons' spin gets polarized at\naround $B=10^{16}\\,$G, whereas neutrons' spin is kept unpolarized on average up\nto around $B=10^{17}\\,$G. Intriguingly, our microscopic calculations reveal\nthat neutrons' spin is actually polarized locally inside and outside of the\nslab already at $B\\sim10^{16}\\,$G, while keeping the system unpolarized in\ntotal. As a conclusion, we have demonstrated validity and usefulness of the\nfully self-consistent superfluid nuclear band theory for describing neutron\nstar matter under arbitrary temperature and magnetic field. Critical\ntemperatures and magnetic fields have been predicted for 1) superfluid to\nnormal transition, 2) crust formation, and 3) spin polarization, under\nconditions relevant to realistic neutron star environments.",

In lane geometry representations, we present a theoretical analysis\nalongside experimental validation to verify that current sparse lane\nrepresentation methods contain inherent flaws, resulting in potential errors of\nup to 20 m, which raise significant safety concerns for driving. To address\nthis issue, we propose a novel patching strategy to completely represent the\nfull lane structure. To enable existing models to match this strategy, we\nintroduce the EndPoint head (EP-head), which adds a patching distance to\nendpoints. The EP-head enables the model to predict more complete lane\nrepresentations even with fewer preset points, effectively addressing existing\nlimitations and paving the way for models that are faster and require fewer\nparameters in the future. In model design, to enhance the model's perception of\nlane structures, we propose the PointLane attention (PL-attention), which\nincorporates prior geometric knowledge into the attention mechanism.

The refinement enhances\ncross-frame consistency by establishing reliable pixel correspondences between\nadjacent frames. Such correspondences further aid in merging redundant\nGaussians through cross-frame feature aggregation. The density of Gaussians is\nthereby reduced, empowering online reconstruction by significantly lowering\ncomputational and memory costs.

Such data often has metadata and partially\nobserved signals that jointly influence the generated values. However, existing\nmethods face three key limitations: (1) they condition on either the metadata\nor observed values, but rarely both together; (2) they adopt either\ntraining-time approaches that fail to generalize to unseen scenarios, or\ninference-time approaches that ignore metadata; and (3) they suffer from\ntrade-offs between generation speed and temporal coherence across time\nwindows--choosing either slow but coherent autoregressive methods or fast but\nincoherent parallel ones.

In contrast\nto the state feedback, the optimality of the dynamic output feedback control\nfor solving the LQR problem requires an implicit condition on the convergence\nof the state observer. Moreover, due to unknown system matrices and the\nexistence of observer error, it is difficult to analyze the convergence and\nstability of most existing output feedback learning-based control methods. To\ntackle these issues, we propose a generalized dynamic output feedback learning\ncontrol approach with guaranteed convergence, stability, and optimality\nperformance for solving the LQR problem of unknown discrete-time linear\nsystems. In particular, a dynamic output feedback controller is designed to be\nequivalent to a state feedback controller. This equivalence relationship is an\ninherent property without requiring convergence of the estimated state by the\nstate observer, which plays a key role in establishing the off-policy learning\ncontrol approaches. By value iteration and policy iteration schemes, the\nadaptive dynamic programming based learning control approaches are developed to\nestimate the optimal feedback control gain. In addition, a model-free stability\ncriterion is provided by finding a nonsingular parameterization matrix, which\ncontributes to establishing a switched iteration scheme. Furthermore, the\nconvergence, stability, and optimality analyses of the proposed output feedback\nlearning control approaches are given.

However, enhancing the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER)\nperformance remains a key challenge in developing SACs for HER technology.\nHerein, we employed first-principles calculations in conjunction with the\nclimbing-image nudged elastic band (CI-NEB) method to explore the effect of\nsurface ligands (F, Cl, Br, I) on the HER performance and mechanism of\nsingle-atom (Pd or Cu)-anchored MoS2 monolayer.

However, the introduction of ligands to Cu@MoS2\ndeteriorates HER performance due to strong coupling between the absorbed H and\nligands. It reveals that the ligand I restructures the local chemical\nmicroenvironment surrounding the SAC Pd, leading to impurity bands near the\nFermi level that couple favorably with the s states of H atoms, yielding\nnumerous highly active sites to enhance catalytic performance. Furthermore, the\nCI-NEB method elucidates that the enhanced HER mechanism for the I-Pd@MoS2\ncatalyst should belong to the coexistence of the Volmer-Tafel and\nVolmer-Heyrovsky reactions.

In this work,\nwe examine an insidious variant of this threat: toxic continuation. Unlike\nstandard jailbreaks that rely solely on malicious instructions, toxic\ncontinuation arises when the model is given a malicious input alongside a\npartial toxic output, resulting in harmful completions. This vulnerability\nposes a unique challenge in multimodal settings, where even subtle image\nvariations can disproportionately affect the model's response. To this end, we\npropose RedDiffuser (RedDiff), the first red teaming framework that uses\nreinforcement learning to fine-tune diffusion models into generating\nnatural-looking adversarial images that induce toxic continuations. RedDiffuser\nintegrates a greedy search procedure for selecting candidate image prompts with\nreinforcement fine-tuning that jointly promotes toxic output and semantic\ncoherence. Experiments demonstrate that RedDiffuser significantly increases the\ntoxicity rate in LLaVA outputs by 10.69% and 8.91% on the original and hold-out\nsets, respectively. It also exhibits strong transferability, increasing\ntoxicity rates on Gemini by 5.1% and on LLaMA-Vision by 26.83%.

    "abstract": "Distributed photovoltaic (DPV) systems are essential for advancing renewable\nenergy applications and achieving energy independence. Accurate DPV power\nforecasting can optimize power system planning and scheduling while\nsignificantly reducing energy loss, thus enhancing overall system efficiency\nand reliability. However, solar energy's intermittent nature and DPV systems'\nspatial distribution create significant forecasting challenges. Traditional\nmethods often rely on costly external data, such as numerical weather\nprediction (NWP) and satellite images, which are difficult to scale for smaller\nDPV systems. To tackle this issue, this study has introduced an advanced large\nlanguage model (LLM)-based time series forecasting framework Time-LLM to\nimprove the DPV power forecasting accuracy and generalization ability. By\nreprogramming, the framework aligns historical power data with natural language\nmodalities, facilitating efficient modeling of time-series data. Then\nQwen2.5-3B model is integrated as the backbone LLM to process input data by\nleveraging its pattern recognition and inference abilities, achieving a balance\nbetween efficiency and performance. Finally, by using a flatten and linear\nprojection layer, the LLM's high-dimensional output is transformed into the\nfinal forecasts. Experimental results indicate that Time-LLM outperforms\nleading recent advanced time series forecasting models, such as\nTransformer-based methods and MLP-based models, achieving superior accuracy in\nboth short-term and long-term forecasting. Time-LLM also demonstrates\nexceptional adaptability in few-shot and zero-shot learning scenarios.

We first analyze the\nphoton sphere, critical impact parameter, and innermost stable circular orbit\nas $\\zeta$ varies, and constrain $\\zeta$ using Event Horizon Telescope data.\nAdditionally, by employing the ray-tracing method to study photon trajectories\nnear the two quantum-corrected black holes, we find that $\\zeta$ can reduce the\nrange of impact parameters corresponding to the photon ring and lensed ring. We\nthen examine the optical appearance of these black holes with thin accretion\ndisks, showing $\\zeta$ significantly brightens the first model's image but has\nlittle effect on the second. Meanwhile, we demonstrate the contributions of the\ntransfer functions to the observed intensity of direct and lensed ring in the\nobserver's field of view, which has rarely been separately illustrated in\nprevious studies. Finally, we study the optical appearance of both\nquantum-corrected black holes under a static spherical accretion model, with\nresults consistent with the above. Therefore, we conclude that the second\nquantum-corrected black hole is almost indistinguishable from the Schwarzschild\nblack hole, while the first quantum-corrected black hole can be distinguished\nfrom the Schwarzschild black hole through its optical appearance.",

A central challenge in LL is the\nstability-plasticity dilemma, which requires models to balance the preservation\nof previous knowledge (stability) with the ability to learn new tasks\n(plasticity). While parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has been widely\nadopted in large language models, its application to lifelong learning remains\nunderexplored. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes AdaLL, an adapter-based\nframework designed to address the dilemma through a simple, universal, and\neffective strategy. AdaLL co-trains the backbone network and adapters under\nregularization constraints, enabling the backbone to capture task-invariant\nfeatures while allowing the adapters to specialize in task-specific\ninformation. Unlike methods that freeze the backbone network, AdaLL\nincrementally enhances the backbone's capabilities across tasks while\nminimizing interference through backbone regularization. This architectural\ndesign significantly improves both stability and plasticity, effectively\neliminating the stability-plasticity dilemma. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat AdaLL consistently outperforms existing methods across various\nconfigurations, including dataset choices, task sequences, and task scales.",

This problem was formulated by Caro and Ruiz and\nmotivated by the data-driven prediction problem in quantum mechanics. Caro and\nRuiz analysed the question of uniqueness for Hamiltonians of the form $-\\Delta\n+ V$ with an electric potential $V = V(\\mathrm{t}, \\mathrm{x})$ that depends on\nthe time and space variables. In this context, they proved that uniqueness\nholds in dimension $n \\geq 2$ whenever the potentials are bounded and have\nsuper-exponential decay at infinity. Although their result does not seem to be\noptimal, one would expect at least some degree of exponential decay to be\nnecessary for the potentials. However, in this paper, we show that by\nrestricting the analysis to Hamiltonians with time-independent electric\npotentials, namely $V = V(\\mathrm{x})$, uniqueness can be established for\nbounded integrable potentials exhibiting only super-linear decay at infinity,\nin any dimension $n \\geq 2$. This surprising improvement is possible because,\nunlike Caro and Ruiz's approach, our argument avoids the use of complex\ngeometrical optics (CGO). Instead, we rely on the construction of stationary\nstates at different energies -- this is possible because the potential does not\ndepend on time. These states will have an explicit leading term, given by a\nHerglotz wave, plus a correction term that will vanish as the energy grows.\nBesides the significant relaxation of decay assumptions on the potential, the\navoidance of CGO solutions is important in its own right, since such solutions\nare not readily available in more complicated geometric settings.",

The most widely used fundamental criterion\nfor rationale extraction is the maximum mutual information (MMI) criterion. In\nthis paper, we first demonstrate that MMI suffers from diminishing marginal\nreturns. Once part of the rationale has been identified, finding the remaining\nportions contributes only marginally to increasing the mutual information,\nmaking it difficult to use MMI to locate the rest. In contrast to MMI that aims\nto reproduce the prediction, we seek to identify the parts of the input that\nthe network can actually utilize.\n  This is achieved by comparing how different rationale candidates match the\ncapability space of the weight matrix. The weight matrix of a neural network is\ntypically low-rank, meaning that the linear combinations of its column vectors\ncan only cover part of the directions in a high-dimensional space\n(high-dimension: the dimensions of an input vector). If an input is fully\nutilized by the network, {it generally matches these directions (e.g., a\nportion of a hypersphere), resulting in a representation with a high norm.\nConversely, if an input primarily falls outside (orthogonal to) these\ndirections}, its representation norm will approach zero, behaving like noise\nthat the network cannot effectively utilize. Building on this, we propose using\nthe norms of rationale candidates as an alternative objective to MMI. Through\nexperiments on four text classification datasets and one graph classification\ndataset using three network architectures (GRUs, BERT, and GCN), we show that\nour method outperforms MMI and its improved variants in identifying better\nrationales.

However, existing algorithms only excel at specific single\ndegradation distributions due to limited adaption capacity and have to deal\nwith different weather degradations with separately trained models, thus may\nfail to handle real-world stochastic weather scenarios. Besides, the model\ntraining is also infeasible due to the lack of paired video data to\ncharacterize the coexistence of multiple weather. To ameliorate the\naforementioned issue, we propose a novel unified model, dubbed UniWRV, to\nremove multiple heterogeneous video weather degradations in an all-in-one\nfashion. Specifically, to tackle degenerate spatial feature heterogeneity, we\npropose a tailored weather prior guided module that queries exclusive priors\nfor different instances as prompts to steer spatial feature characterization.\nTo tackle degenerate temporal feature heterogeneity, we propose a dynamic\nrouting aggregation module that can automatically select optimal fusion paths\nfor different instances to dynamically integrate temporal features.\nAdditionally, we managed to construct a new synthetic video dataset, termed\nHWVideo, for learning and benchmarking multiple hybrid adverse weather removal,\nwhich contains 15 hybrid weather conditions with a total of 1500\nadverse-weather/clean paired video clips.

Among other methods,\nsubstitute model training is an all-encompassing attack applicable to any\nmachine learning model whose behaviour can be approximated from input-output\nqueries. Whereas prior works mainly focused on improving the performance of\nsubstitute models by, e.g. developing a new substitute training method, there\nhave been only limited ablation studies on the impact the attacker's strength\nhas on the substitute model's performance. As a result, different authors came\nto diverse, sometimes contradicting, conclusions. In this work, we exhaustively\nexamine the ambivalent influence of different factors resulting from varying\nthe attacker's capabilities and knowledge on a substitute training attack. Our\nfindings suggest that some of the factors that have been considered important\nin the past are, in fact, not that influential; instead, we discover new\ncorrelations between attack conditions and success rate. In particular, we\ndemonstrate that better-performing target models enable higher-fidelity attacks\nand explain the intuition behind this phenomenon. Further, we propose to shift\nthe focus from the complexity of target models toward the complexity of their\nlearning tasks. Therefore, for the substitute model, rather than aiming for a\nhigher architecture complexity, we suggest focusing on getting data of higher\ncomplexity and an appropriate architecture. Finally, we demonstrate that even\nin the most limited data-free scenario, there is no need to overcompensate weak\nknowledge with millions of queries. Our results often exceed or match the\nperformance of previous attacks that assume a stronger attacker, suggesting\nthat these stronger attacks are likely endangering a model owner's intellectual\nproperty to a significantly higher degree than shown until now.",

Established on the off-the-shelf\ntext-to-image (T2I) diffusion model, we propose a novel training-free\ntext-guided image-to-image (I2I) translation framework dubbed as\n\\textbf{P}hase-\\textbf{T}ransferred \\textbf{Diffusion} Model (PTDiffusion) for\nhidden art syntheses. PTDiffusion harmoniously embeds an input reference image\ninto arbitrary scenes described by the text prompts, producing illusion images\nexhibiting hidden visual cues of the reference image. At the heart of our\nmethod is a plug-and-play phase transfer mechanism that dynamically and\nprogressively transplants diffusion features' phase spectrum from the denoising\nprocess to reconstruct the reference image into the one to sample the generated\nillusion image, realizing deep fusion of the reference structural information\nand the textual semantic information in the diffusion model latent space.\nFurthermore, we propose asynchronous phase transfer to enable flexible control\nto the degree of hidden content discernability. Our method bypasses any model\ntraining and fine-tuning process, all while substantially outperforming related\ntext-guided I2I methods in image generation quality, text fidelity, visual\ndiscernibility, and contextual naturalness for illusion picture synthesis, as\ndemonstrated by extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments.

Although 3D-GS\nshows effectiveness in static scenes, their performance significantly degrades\nin real-world environments due to transient objects, lighting variations, and\ndiverse levels of occlusion. To tackle this, existing methods estimate\noccluders or transient elements by leveraging pre-trained models or integrating\nadditional transient field pipelines. However, these methods still suffer from\ntwo defects: 1) Using semantic features from the Vision Foundation model (VFM)\ncauses additional computational costs. 2) The transient field requires\nsignificant memory to handle transient elements with per-view Gaussians and\nstruggles to define clear boundaries for occluders, solely relying on\nphotometric errors. To address these problems, we propose ForestSplats, a novel\napproach that leverages the deformable transient field and a superpixel-aware\nmask to efficiently represent transient elements in the 2D scene across\nunconstrained image collections and effectively decompose static scenes from\ntransient distractors without VFM. We designed the transient field to be\ndeformable, capturing per-view transient elements. Furthermore, we introduce a\nsuperpixel-aware mask that clearly defines the boundaries of occluders by\nconsidering photometric errors and superpixels. Additionally, we propose\nuncertainty-aware densification to avoid generating Gaussians within the\nboundaries of occluders during densification. Through extensive experiments\nacross several benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that ForestSplats outperforms\nexisting methods without VFM and shows significant memory efficiency in\nrepresenting transient elements.",

In this paper, we investigate the effect of parasite quiescence on\nthe time to extinction of infectious disease epidemics.

This finding, proven using a time scale\nargument and singular perturbation theory for Markov processes, is illustrated\nand validated by numerical experiments based on the quasi-steady state\ndistribution.

Based on finite size scaling we show\nthat the transition between the two phases occurs at a critical damage\nanalogous to continuous phase transitions.

    "abstract": "Diffusion models have revolutionized generative modeling in continuous\ndomains like image, audio, and video synthesis. However, their iterative\nsampling process leads to slow generation and inefficient training, challenges\nthat are further exacerbated when incorporating Reinforcement Learning from\nHuman Feedback (RLHF) due to sparse rewards and long time horizons. Consistency\nmodels address these issues by enabling single-step or efficient multi-step\ngeneration, significantly reducing computational costs.\n  In this work, we propose a direct reward optimization framework for applying\nRLHF to consistency models, incorporating distributional regularization to\nenhance training stability and prevent reward hacking. We investigate various\n$f$-divergences as regularization strategies, striking a balance between reward\nmaximization and model consistency. Unlike policy gradient methods, our\napproach leverages first-order gradients, making it more efficient and less\nsensitive to hyperparameter tuning. Empirical results show that our method\nachieves competitive or superior performance compared to policy gradient based\nRLHF methods, across various automatic metrics and human evaluation.\nAdditionally, our analysis demonstrates the impact of different regularization\ntechniques in improving model generalization and preventing overfitting.",

However, they often\ngenerate hallucinated outputs inconsistent with the visual context or prompt,\nlimiting reliability in critical applications like autonomous driving and\nmedical imaging. Existing studies link hallucination to statistical biases,\nlanguage priors, and biased feature learning but lack a structured causal\nunderstanding. In this work, we introduce a causal perspective to analyze and\nmitigate hallucination in VLMs. We hypothesize that hallucination arises from\nunintended direct influences of either the vision or text modality, bypassing\nproper multi-modal fusion. To address this, we construct a causal graph for\nVLMs and employ counterfactual analysis to estimate the Natural Direct Effect\n(NDE) of vision, text, and their cross-modal interaction on the output. We\nsystematically identify and mitigate these unintended direct effects to ensure\nthat responses are primarily driven by genuine multi-modal fusion. Our approach\nconsists of three steps: (1) designing structural causal graphs to distinguish\ncorrect fusion pathways from spurious modality shortcuts, (2) estimating\nmodality-specific and cross-modal NDE using perturbed image representations,\nhallucinated text embeddings, and degraded visual inputs, and (3) implementing\na test-time intervention module to dynamically adjust the model's dependence on\neach modality. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly\nreduces hallucination while preserving task performance, providing a robust and\ninterpretable framework for improving VLM reliability.

We then\nderive an optimal bandwidth strategy along with a procedure for estimating\nasymptotic confidence intervals.

In\nour system, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs)\nshare aggregated observation data via communication channels while\nindependently processing these inputs to generate enriched state embeddings.\nThis design enables dynamic, cost-optimal, conflict-aware task allocation in a\n3D grid environment without the need for centralized coordination.

    "abstract": "This paper deals with the issue of conceptual models role in capturing\nsemantics and aligning them to serve the remaining development phases of\nsystems design. Specifically, the entity-relationship (ER) model is selected as\nan example of conceptual representation that serves this purpose in building\nrelational database systems. It is claimed that ER diagrams provide a solid\nbasis for subsequent technical implementation. The ER model appeal relies on\nits simplicity and its benefit in clarifying the requirements for databases.\nNevertheless, some researchers have observed that this reduction of complexity\nis accompanied by oversimplification and overlooking dynamism. Accordingly,\ncomplaints have risen about the lack of direct compatibility between ER\nmodeling and relational model. This paper is an attempt to explore what is\nbeneath this static ER simplicity and its role as a base for subsequent\ntechnical implementation. In this undertaking, we use thinging machines (TMs),\nwhere modeling is constructed upon a single notion thimac (thing/machine).\nThimac constituents are formed from the makeup of five actions, create,\nprocess, release, transfer, and receive that inject dynamism alongside with\nstructure. The ER entities, attributes, and relationship are modeled as\nthimacs. Accordingly, in this paper, ER examples are remodeled in TM while\nidentifying TM portions that correspond to ER components. The resulting TM\nmodel insets actions into entities, attributes and relationships. In this case,\nrelationships are the products of creating linking thimacs plus the logic of\nconstructing them. Based on such static/dynamic TM representation, the modeler\ncan produce any level of simplification, including the original ER model. In\nconclusion, results indicated that the TM models facilitate multilevel\nsimplicity and viable direct compatibility with the relational database model.",

This\npaper introduces a novel method, Semantic-consistent Ray Modeling of Hair\n(SRM-Hair), for making 3D hair morphable and controlled by coefficients. The\nkey contribution lies in semantic-consistent ray modeling, which extracts\nordered hair surface vertices and exhibits notable properties such as\nadditivity for hairstyle fusion, adaptability, flipping, and thickness\nmodification. We collect a dataset of over 250 high-fidelity real hair scans\npaired with 3D face data to serve as a prior for the 3D morphable hair. Based\non this, SRM-Hair can reconstruct a hair mesh combined with a 3D head from a\nsingle image. Note that SRM-Hair produces an independent hair mesh,\nfacilitating applications in virtual avatar creation, realistic animation, and\nhigh-fidelity hair rendering.

In addition, these uncertainty estimates are needed to\nestablish robust protection levels in safety critical applications.\n  To address this challenge, the main objectives of this paper aims at\nexploring a potential framework capable of providing both point estimates and\nassociated uncertainty measures of ionospheric Vertical Total Electron Content\n(VTEC). In this context, Probabilistic Neural Networks (PNNs) offer a promising\napproach to achieve this goal.

In this work, we integrate Multimodal Large Language\nModels (MLLMs) within DM-based face forensics, and propose a fine-grained\nanalysis triad framework called VLForgery, that can 1) predict falsified facial\nimages; 2) locate the falsified face regions subjected to partial synthesis;\nand 3) attribute the synthesis with specific generators. To achieve the above\ngoals, we introduce VLF (Visual Language Forensics), a novel and diverse\nsynthesis face dataset designed to facilitate rich interactions between Visual\nand Language modalities in MLLMs. Additionally, we propose an extrinsic\nknowledge-guided description method, termed EkCot, which leverages knowledge\nfrom the image generation pipeline to enable MLLMs to quickly capture image\ncontent. Furthermore, we introduce a low-level vision comparison pipeline\ndesigned to identify differential features between real and fake that MLLMs can\ninherently understand. These features are then incorporated into EkCot,\nenhancing its ability to analyze forgeries in a structured manner, following\nthe sequence of detection, localization, and attribution.

    "abstract": "The rapid expansion of mobile internet has resulted in a substantial increase\nin user-generated content (UGC) images, thereby making the thorough assessment\nof UGC images both urgent and essential. Recently, multimodal large language\nmodels (MLLMs) have shown great potential in image quality assessment (IQA) and\nimage aesthetic assessment (IAA). Despite this progress, effectively scoring\nthe quality and aesthetics of UGC images still faces two main challenges: 1) A\nsingle score is inadequate to capture the hierarchical human perception. 2) How\nto use MLLMs to output numerical scores, such as mean opinion scores (MOS),\nremains an open question. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel\ndataset, named Realistic image Quality and Aesthetic (RealQA), including 14,715\nUGC images, each of which is annoted with 10 fine-grained attributes. These\nattributes span three levels: low level (e.g., image clarity), middle level\n(e.g., subject integrity) and high level (e.g., composition). Besides, we\nconduct a series of in-depth and comprehensive investigations into how to\neffectively predict numerical scores using MLLMs. Surprisingly, by predicting\njust two extra significant digits, the next token paradigm can achieve SOTA\nperformance. Furthermore, with the help of chain of thought (CoT) combined with\nthe learnt fine-grained attributes, the proposed method can outperform SOTA\nmethods on five public datasets for IQA and IAA with superior interpretability\nand show strong zero-shot generalization for video quality assessment (VQA).\nThe code and dataset will be released.",

The dynamics of the fluid\nare governed by the incompressible Boussinesq approximation under the influence\nof gravity, and the interface between fluid and air is under the effect of\ncapillary forces.

Previous studies often rely on publicly available datasets\nfor training, focusing on modifying network architectures or incorporating\nspecialized modules to extract domain-invariant features and thus improve model\nrobustness. In contrast, inspired by single-frame structured-light\nphase-shifting encoding, this study introduces RGB-Speckle, a cross-scene 3D\nreconstruction framework based on an active stereo camera system, designed to\nenhance robustness. Specifically, we propose a novel phase pre-normalization\nencoding-decoding method: first, we randomly perturb phase-shift maps and embed\nthem into the three RGB channels to generate color speckle patterns;\nsubsequently, the camera captures phase-encoded images modulated by objects as\ninput to a stereo matching network. This technique effectively mitigates\nexternal interference and ensures consistent input data for RGB-Speckle,\nthereby bolstering cross-domain 3D reconstruction stability. To validate the\nproposed method, we conduct complex experiments: (1) construct a color speckle\ndataset for complex scenarios based on the proposed encoding scheme; (2)\nevaluate the impact of the phase pre-normalization encoding-decoding technique\non 3D reconstruction accuracy; and (3) further investigate its robustness\nacross diverse conditions.

In\nthe model group, DBND was induced in 40 rats through Hassan Shaker spinal cord\ntransection, with 24 rats surviving spinal shock and subsequently randomized\ninto two groups: a model-only group (DBND, n=12) and an EA intervention group\n(DBND+EA, n=12). DBND+EA was administered at Ciliao (BL32), Zhongji (RN3), and\nSanyinjiao (SP6) acupoints, for 20 minutes per session, once daily for 10\nconsecutive days. On day 29 post-injury, all rats underwent urodynamic\nassessments, followed by hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining, tandem mass tag\n(TMT) proteomics, and Western blot (WB) analysis of the detrusor and bladder\nneck tissues.\n  Results Urodynamic evaluation demonstrated that EA intervention enhanced\nbladder function in DBND rats. HE staining indicated reduced fibroplasia in the\ndetrusor muscle and alleviated inflammation in the bladder neck following EA.\nTMT proteomic analysis revealed 30 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) in\nthe detrusor and 59 DEPs in the bladder neck post-EA treatment. WB results\ncorroborated these TMT findings.\n  Conclusion EA effectively promotes synergy between the detrusor muscle and\nbladder neck in DBND, likely by enhancing detrusor contractility and\nfacilitating bladder neck relaxation during urination. This study provides\nmechanistic insights into the therapeutic role of EA in managing DBND.",

To analyze the sample complexity of our\nestimator, we exploit the hyperbolic Gaussian structure embedded in the random\nenvironment to bound the fluctuations of the underlying random edge\nconductances.",

While MRI offers\ndetailed visualization of cervical spine anatomy, manual interpretation remains\nlabor-intensive and prone to error. To address this, we developed an innovative\nAI-assisted Expert-based Diagnosis System that automates both segmentation and\ndiagnosis of cervical spondylosis using MRI. Leveraging multi-center datasets\nof cervical MRI images from patients with cervical spondylosis, our system\nfeatures a pathology-guided segmentation model capable of accurately segmenting\nkey cervical anatomical structures. The segmentation is followed by an\nexpert-based diagnostic framework that automates the calculation of critical\nclinical indicators. Our segmentation model achieved an impressive average Dice\ncoefficient exceeding 0.90 across four cervical spinal anatomies and\ndemonstrated enhanced accuracy in herniation areas. Diagnostic evaluation\nfurther showcased the system's precision, with the lowest mean average errors\n(MAE) for the C2-C7 Cobb angle and the Maximum Spinal Cord Compression (MSCC)\ncoefficient. In addition, our method delivered high accuracy, precision,\nrecall, and F1 scores in herniation localization, K-line status assessment, T2\nhyperintensity detection, and Kang grading.

While many KANs are\ndesigned using basis and polynomial functions, such as B-splines, ReLU-KAN\nutilizes a combination of ReLU functions to mimic the structure of B-splines\nand take advantage of ReLU's speed. However, ReLU-KAN is not built for multiple\ninputs, and its limitations stem from ReLU's handling of negative values, which\ncan restrict feature extraction. To address these issues, we introduce\nActivation Function-Based Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (AF-KAN), expanding\nReLU-KAN with various activations and their function combinations. This novel\nKAN also incorporates parameter reduction methods, primarily attention\nmechanisms and data normalization, to enhance performance on image\nclassification datasets. We explore different activation functions, function\ncombinations, grid sizes, and spline orders to validate the effectiveness of\nAF-KAN and determine its optimal configuration. In the experiments, AF-KAN\nsignificantly outperforms MLP, ReLU-KAN, and other KANs with the same parameter\ncount. It also remains competitive even when using fewer than 6 to 10 times the\nparameters while maintaining the same network structure. However, AF-KAN\nrequires a longer training time and consumes more FLOPs. The repository for\nthis work is available at https://github.com/hoangthangta/All-KAN.",

However, achieving efficient and robust HPO in deep reinforcement\nlearning (RL) is consistently challenging due to its high non-stationarity and\ncomputational cost. To tackle this problem, existing approaches attempt to\nadapt common HPO techniques (e.g., population-based training or Bayesian\noptimization) to the RL scenario. However, they remain sample-inefficient and\ncomputationally expensive, which cannot facilitate a wide range of\napplications.

Specifically, we\nformulate the HPO process as a multi-armed bandit with clustered arms (MABC)\nand link it directly to long-term return optimization. ULTHO also provides a\nquantified and statistical perspective to filter the HPs efficiently. We test\nULTHO on benchmarks including ALE, Procgen, MiniGrid, and PyBullet.

Based on the above findings, we have designed a novel Patch-Depth\nFusion Network (PDFNet) for high-precision dichotomous image segmentation. The\ncore of PDFNet consists of three aspects. Firstly, the object perception is\nenhanced through multi-modal input fusion. By utilizing the patch fine-grained\nstrategy, coupled with patch selection and enhancement, the sensitivity to\ndetails is improved. Secondly, by leveraging the depth integrity-prior\ndistributed in the depth maps, we propose an integrity-prior loss to enhance\nthe uniformity of the segmentation results in the depth maps. Finally, we\nutilize the features of the shared encoder and, through a simple depth\nrefinement decoder, improve the ability of the shared encoder to capture subtle\ndepth-related information in the images. Experiments on the DIS-5K dataset show\nthat PDFNet significantly outperforms state-of-the-art non-diffusion methods.\nDue to the incorporation of the depth integrity-prior, PDFNet achieves or even\nsurpassing the performance of the latest diffusion-based methods while using\nless than 11% of the parameters of diffusion-based methods.

However, current research provides\nlimited insight into the interpretability of this approach, which is essential\nfor enhancing AI reliability and enabling AI-driven knowledge discovery. In\nthis paper, rather than learning abstract prompt embeddings, we propose the\nfirst framework, named Interpretable Visual Prompt Tuning (IVPT), to explore\ninterpretability for visual prompts, by introducing hierarchical concept\nprototypes. Specifically, visual prompts are linked to human-understandable\nsemantic concepts, represented as a set of category-agnostic prototypes, each\ncorresponding to a specific region of the image. Then, IVPT aggregates features\nfrom these regions to generate interpretable prompts, which are structured\nhierarchically to explain visual prompts at different granularities.\nComprehensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations on fine-grained\nclassification benchmarks show its superior interpretability and performance\nover conventional visual prompt tuning methods and existing interpretable\nmethods.",

However, it is challenging to acquire the instantaneous\nchannel state information (CSI) for both fluid antennas and RISs, while\nfrequent adjustment of antenna positions and phase shifts will significantly\nincrease the system complexity. To tackle this issue, this paper investigates\nthe two-timescale design for FAS-RIS multi-user systems with linear precoding,\nwhere only the linear precoder design requires instantaneous CSI of the\nend-to-end channel, while the FAS and RIS optimization relies on statistical\nCSI. The main challenge comes from the complex structure of channel and inverse\noperations in linear precoding, such as regularized zero-forcing (RZF) and\nzero-forcing (ZF). Leveraging on random matrix theory (RMT), we first\ninvestigate the fundamental limits of FAS-RIS systems with RZF/ZF precoding by\nderiving the ergodic sum rate (ESR). This result is utilized to determine the\nminimum number of activated antennas to achieve a given ESR. Based on the\nevaluation result, we propose an algorithm to jointly optimize the antenna\nselection, regularization factor of RZF, and phase shifts at the RIS.

Prior works on both\nschemes typically assume \\emph{homogeneous} wireless conditions (equal path\nloss across devices) to enforce zero-bias updates or permit uncontrolled bias,\nresulting in suboptimal performance and high-variance model updates in\n\\emph{heterogeneous} environments, where devices with poor channel conditions\nslow down convergence. This paper addresses FL over heterogeneous wireless\nnetworks by proposing novel OTA and digital FL updates that allow a structured,\ntime-invariant model bias, thereby reducing variance in FL updates. We analyze\ntheir convergence under a unified framework and derive an upper bound on the\nmodel ``optimality error\", which explicitly quantifies the effect of bias and\nvariance in terms of design parameters. Next, to optimize this trade-off, we\nstudy a non-convex optimization problem and develop a successive convex\napproximation (SCA)-based framework to jointly optimize the design parameters.\nWe perform extensive numerical evaluations with several related design variants\nand state-of-the-art OTA and digital FL schemes.

Despite significant efforts to create a broad range of\nsurface patterns via wrinkling, little has been studied about a dynamic and\ntransient wrinkling process, where a suspended polymer thin film undergoes\nliquid-to-solid phase transitions. Here, a spontaneous wrinkling process is\nreported, when drying poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) soap films suspended on 3D\nprinted wireframes with near zero or negative Gaussian curvatures. As water\nevaporates, a thickness gradient across the sample is developed, leading to\nnon-uniform drying rates, and a concentration gradient between the inner and\nouter sides (exposed to air) of the suspended PVA soap film induces a\ndifferential osmotic pressure. Together, these effects contribute to an\nin-plane compressive stress, leading to the formation of surface wrinkles,\nwhose growth is guided by the geometry of the frame. Importantly, the wrinkles\nevolve dynamically: the wavelength and number of the wrinkles can be tuned by\naltering the concentration of the PVA aqueous solutions, the initial mass, the\nrelative humidity of the drying environment; the patterns of the resulting\nwrinkles can be programmed by the geometry of the wireframe.",

    "abstract": "Modern robotic systems, deployed across domains from industrial automation to\ndomestic assistance, face a critical challenge: executing tasks with precision\nand adaptability in dynamic, unpredictable environments.

Federated learning (FL), owing to its\ndistributed learning and privacy-preserving properties, has received attention\nfrom both academia and industry. In this paper, we introduce a system that\nintegrates FL and SemCom, which is called FedSem. We have also proposed an\noptimization problem related to resource allocation for this system. The\nobjective of this problem is to minimize the energy consumption and delay of\nFL, as well as the transmission energy of SemCom, while maximizing the accuracy\nof the model trained through FL. The channel access scheme is Orthogonal\nFrequency-Division Multiple Access (OFDMA). The optimization variables include\nthe binary (0-1) subcarrier allocation indicator, the transmission power of\neach device on specific subcarriers, the computational frequency of each\nparticipating device, and the compression rate for SemCom. To tackle this\ncomplex problem, we propose a resource allocation algorithm that decomposes the\noriginal problem into more tractable subproblems.

    "abstract": "In histopathology, intelligent diagnosis of Whole Slide Images (WSIs) is\nessential for automating and objectifying diagnoses, reducing the workload of\npathologists. However, diagnostic models often face the challenge of forgetting\npreviously learned data during incremental training on datasets from different\nsources. To address this issue, we propose a new framework PaGMIL to mitigate\ncatastrophic forgetting in breast cancer WSI classification. Our framework\nintroduces two key components into the common MIL model architecture. First, it\nleverages microscopic pathological prior to select more accurate and diverse\nrepresentative patches for MIL. Secondly, it trains separate classification\nheads for each task and uses macroscopic pathological prior knowledge, treating\nthe thumbnail as a prompt guide (PG) to select the appropriate classification\nhead. We evaluate the continual learning performance of PaGMIL across several\npublic breast cancer datasets. PaGMIL achieves a better balance between the\nperformance of the current task and the retention of previous tasks,\noutperforming other continual learning methods. Our code will be open-sourced\nupon acceptance.",

Subtle biases can propagate misinformation,\ninfluence decision-making, and reinforce stereotypes, raising ethical concerns.\nThis study presents a detection framework to identify nuanced biases in LLMs.\nThe approach integrates contextual analysis, interpretability via attention\nmechanisms, and counterfactual data augmentation to capture hidden biases\nacross linguistic contexts. The methodology employs contrastive prompts and\nsynthetic datasets to analyze model behaviour across cultural, ideological, and\ndemographic scenarios.\n  Quantitative analysis using benchmark datasets and qualitative assessments\nthrough expert reviews validate the effectiveness of the framework. Results\nshow improvements in detecting subtle biases compared to conventional methods,\nwhich often fail to highlight disparities in model responses to race, gender,\nand socio-political contexts. The framework also identifies biases arising from\nimbalances in training data and model architectures. Continuous user feedback\nensures adaptability and refinement. This research underscores the importance\nof proactive bias mitigation strategies and calls for collaboration between\npolicymakers, AI developers, and regulators.

Prior research, especially in open-source projects, primarily\nfocuses on either temporal or spatial consistency, or their basic combination,\nsuch as appending a description of a camera movement after a prompt without\nconstraining the outcomes of this movement. However, camera movement may\nintroduce new objects to the scene or eliminate existing ones, thereby\noverlaying and affecting the preceding narrative. Especially in videos with\nnumerous camera movements, the interplay between multiple plots becomes\nincreasingly complex. This paper introduces and examines integral\nspatio-temporal consistency, considering the synergy between plot progression\nand camera techniques, and the long-term impact of prior content on subsequent\ngeneration. Our research encompasses dataset construction through to the\ndevelopment of the model. Initially, we constructed a DropletVideo-10M dataset,\nwhich comprises 10 million videos featuring dynamic camera motion and object\nactions. Each video is annotated with an average caption of 206 words,\ndetailing various camera movements and plot developments. Following this, we\ndeveloped and trained the DropletVideo model, which excels in preserving\nspatio-temporal coherence during video generation.

Computational psychiatry\napproaches promise to bridge this gap by providing formal accounts of the\nlatent information processing changes that underlie the development and\nmaintenance of psychiatric phenomena.

We discuss strengths and\nlimitations of key approaches to modelling affect, with a focus on\nreinforcement learning, active inference, the hierarchical gaussian filter, and\ndrift-diffusion models. We find that, in this literature, affect is an\nimportant source of modulation in decision making, and has a bidirectional\ninfluence on how individuals infer both internal and external states.\nHighlighting the potential role of affect in information processing changes\nunderlying symptom development, we extend an existing model of psychosis, where\naffective changes are influenced by increasing cortical noise and consequent\nincreases in either perceived environmental instability or expected noise in\nsensory input, becoming part of a self-reinforcing process generating\nnegatively valenced, over-weighted priors underlying positive symptom\ndevelopment.

However, challenges and controversies remain due to\nits inevitable n-type antisite defects, hindering the experimental realization\nof intrinsic magnetic topological phenomena and rendering the precise control\nof topological phase transitions (TPTs) unachievable. Here, we study a\ncandidate material family, Mn(1-x)GexBi2Te4, in which the heavy n-type doping\nfeatures are strongly suppressed when the Ge content reaches 0.46, and multiple\ntopological phases are well maintained with the surface Dirac point located\nnear the Fermi level. Based on angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy,\ntransport measurements, and first-principles calculations, we reveal two\nmagnetism-induced TPTs: the first is antiferromagnetic-ordering-induced\ntransition from strong topological insulator to a magnetic topological\ninsulator as revealed by gap opening of topological surface states; the second\nis external-magnetic-field-dependent transition from magnetic topological\ninsulator to a Weyl semimetal with the gap reclosed. Our work paves the way for\nthe realization of intrinsic magnetic topological states in MnBi2Te4 family and\nprovides an ideal platform for achieving controllable and continuous TPTs\ntowards future spintronic applications.",

For Rank-R1, we\nuse a reinforcement learning algorithm along with only a small set of relevance\nlabels (without any reasoning supervision) to enhance the reasoning ability of\nLLM-based rerankers. Our hypothesis is that adding reasoning capabilities to\nthe rerankers can improve their relevance assessement and ranking capabilities.\nOur experiments on the TREC DL and BRIGHT datasets show that Rank-R1 is highly\neffective, especially for complex queries.

Conversely, viscous effects manifesting\nmacroscopically as strain-rate sensitivity inhibit localization. The analytical\nshear-band process zone model due to D.E. Grady, in turn based on a\nrigid-plastic solution for stress release by N.F. Mott, is advanced to account\nfor these phenomena. The material contains an average defect measure (e.g.,\nporosity) and a concentrated defect measure at a spatial location where shear\nbanding is most likely to initiate after an instability threshold is attained.\nShearing resistance and certain physical properties are reduced commensurately\nwith local defect concentration. Non-Newtonian viscosity increases dissipative\nresistance. Viscous dissipation, if strong enough, is shown to prevent an\ninfinitesimal-width shear band even in a non-conductor. Here, a\npseudo-quadratic viscosity widens the band similarly to heat conduction, and\nakin to quadratic shock viscosity often used to resolve widths of planar shock\nwaves. The model captures simulation data showing reduced localization strain\nand shear band width with increasing maximum initial pore size in additively\nmanufactured titanium and HY-100 steel. Predictions for shear band width, local\nstrain, and temperature are more accurate versus data on steel than prior\nanalytical modeling.

We analyze functionalities\nprovided by representative smartphone manufacturers and divide them into five\ncategories: text summarization, text Q&A, information extraction, content\ncreation, and notification management, further detailed into 20 specific tasks.\nFor each task, we construct high-quality datasets comprising 50 to 200\nquestion-answer pairs that reflect everyday mobile interactions, and we develop\nautomated evaluation criteria tailored for these tasks. We conduct\ncomprehensive evaluations of on-device LLMs and MLLMs using SmartBench and also\nassess their performance after quantized deployment on real smartphone NPUs.\nOur contributions provide a standardized framework for evaluating on-device\nLLMs in Chinese, promoting further development and optimization in this\ncritical area.

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) enables decentralized clients to collaboratively\ntrain a global model under the orchestration of a central server without\nexposing their individual data. However, the iterative exchange of model\nparameters between the server and clients imposes heavy communication burdens,\nrisks potential privacy leakage, and even precludes collaboration among\nheterogeneous clients. Distillation-based FL tackles these challenges by\nexchanging low-dimensional model outputs rather than model parameters, yet it\nhighly relies on a task-relevant auxiliary dataset that is often not available\nin practice. Data-free FL attempts to overcome this limitation by training a\nserver-side generator to directly synthesize task-specific data samples for\nknowledge transfer. However, the update rule of the generator requires clients\nto share on-device models for white-box access, which greatly compromises the\nadvantages of distillation-based FL. This motivates us to explore a data-free\nand black-box FL framework via Zeroth-order Gradient Estimation (FedZGE), which\nestimates the gradients after flowing through on-device models in a black-box\noptimization manner to complete the training of the generator in terms of\nfidelity, transferability, diversity, and equilibrium, without involving any\nauxiliary data or sharing any model parameters, thus combining the advantages\nof both distillation-based FL and data-free FL.

This task demands a highly generalizable perception system capable of\ndetecting potential holes, selecting the correct mating hole from multiple\ncandidates, estimating its precise pose, and executing insertion despite\nuncertainties. While learning-based methods have been applied to peg insertion,\nthey often fail to generalize beyond the specific peg-hole pairs encountered\nduring training. Recent advancements in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer a\npromising alternative, leveraging large-scale datasets to enable robust\ngeneralization across diverse tasks. Inspired by their success, we introduce a\nnovel zero-shot peg insertion framework that utilizes a VLM to identify mating\nholes and estimate their poses without prior knowledge of their geometry.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves 90.2% accuracy,\nsignificantly outperforming baselines in identifying the correct mating hole\nacross a wide range of previously unseen peg-hole pairs, including 3D-printed\nobjects, toy puzzles, and industrial connectors. Furthermore, we validate the\neffectiveness of our approach in a real-world connector insertion task on a\nbackpanel of a PC, where our system successfully detects holes, identifies the\ncorrect mating hole, estimates its pose, and completes the insertion with a\nsuccess rate of 88.3%.

To address the limitations of explicit modeling, we\npropose the End-to-End HOI Reconstruction Transformer with Graph-based Encoding\n(HOI-TG).

In this\npaper, we provide a fine-grained analysis of this phenomenon for two-layer ReLU\nnetworks under a teacher-student setup.

Notably, this rate does not suffer\nfrom the curse of dimensionality and demonstrates how substantial permutation\ncan reduce the LMC loss barrier. Moreover, we observe a sharp transition in the\nsparsity of GD/SGD solutions when increasing the learning rate and investigate\nhow this sparsity preference affects the LMC loss barrier modulo permutation.\nExperiments on both synthetic and MNIST datasets corroborate our theoretical\npredictions and reveal a similar trend for more complex network architectures.",

    "abstract": "Hickson compact groups (HCGs) offer an ideal environment for investigating\ngalaxy transformation as a result of interactions. It has been established that\nthe evolutionary sequence of HCGs is marked by an intermediate stage\ncharacterised by a substantial amount of HI in their intragroup medium (IGrM)\nin the form of tidal tails and bridges (Phase 2), rapidly followed by a final\nstage where no IGrM gas is found and where their member galaxies are highly\nHI-deficient (Phase 3). Despite numerous single-dish and interferometric HI\nstudies on the HCGs, a clear HI picture of the groups within their large-scale\nenvironment still remains to be uncovered. Taking advantage of the MeerKAT's\nhigh column density sensitivity and large field-of-view, we aim to investigate\nthe rapid transformation of HCGs from the intermediate to late phases, and\nestablish a picture of their gas content variations in the context of their\nlarge-scale environments. We performed MeerKAT observations of six HCGs\nselected to represent the intermediate and late phases of the proposed\nevolutionary sequence. Combining the HI observations with data from recent\nwide-field optical surveys, we evaluated the HI deficiencies of galaxies in a\n~30' radius of the HCGs. We find that galaxies surrounding both phases exhibit\nsimilar distributions in their gas content. Similarly, galaxies making up the\ncores of Phase 2 HCGs are comparable to their neighbours in terms of HI\ndeficiencies. However, Phase 3 groups are over an order of magnitude more\ndeficient than their surroundings, supporting previous findings that late-phase\nHCG galaxies are more evolved than their large-scale environments.",

However, a major challenge in this paradigm lies in effectively\nutilizing available driving data, as collecting new data is resource-intensive\nand often limited in its ability to cover diverse driving scenarios. While\nexisting imitation learning frameworks focus on leveraging expert\ndemonstrations, they often overlook the potential of additional complex driving\ndata from surrounding traffic participants. In this paper, we propose a data\naugmentation strategy that enhances imitation learning by leveraging the\nobserved trajectories of nearby vehicles, captured through the AV's sensors, as\nadditional expert demonstrations. We introduce a vehicle selection sampling\nstrategy that prioritizes informative and diverse driving behaviors,\ncontributing to a richer and more diverse dataset for training. We evaluate our\napproach using the state-of-the-art learning-based planning method PLUTO on the\nnuPlan dataset and demonstrate that our augmentation method leads to improved\nperformance in complex driving scenarios. Specifically, our method reduces\ncollision rates and improves safety metrics compared to the baseline. Notably,\neven when using only 10% of the original dataset, our method achieves\nperformance comparable to that of the full dataset, with improved collision\nrates. Our findings highlight the importance of leveraging diverse real-world\ntrajectory data in imitation learning and provide insights into data\naugmentation strategies for autonomous driving.",

However, in\npractice, designing rewards is difficult, and even when specified, evaluating\ntheir correctness is equally problematic: how do we know if a reward function\nis correctly specified? In our work, we address these challenges by focusing on\nreward alignment -- assessing whether a reward function accurately encodes the\npreferences of a human stakeholder. As a concrete measure of reward alignment,\nwe introduce the Trajectory Alignment Coefficient to quantify the similarity\nbetween a human stakeholder's ranking of trajectory distributions and those\ninduced by a given reward function. We show that the Trajectory Alignment\nCoefficient exhibits desirable properties, such as not requiring access to a\nground truth reward, invariance to potential-based reward shaping, and\napplicability to online RL. Additionally, in an 11 -- person user study of RL\npractitioners, we found that access to the Trajectory Alignment Coefficient\nduring reward selection led to statistically significant improvements.

    "abstract": "Accurate hand pose estimation is vital in robotics, advancing dexterous\nmanipulation in human-computer interaction. Toward this goal, this paper\npresents ReJSHand (which stands for Refined Joint and Skeleton Features), a\ncutting-edge network formulated for real-time hand pose estimation and mesh\nreconstruction. The proposed framework is designed to accurately predict 3D\nhand gestures under real-time constraints, which is essential for systems that\ndemand agile and responsive hand motion tracking. The network's design\nprioritizes computational efficiency without compromising accuracy, a\nprerequisite for instantaneous robotic interactions. Specifically, ReJSHand\ncomprises a 2D keypoint generator, a 3D keypoint generator, an expansion block,\nand a feature interaction block for meticulously reconstructing 3D hand poses\nfrom 2D imagery. In addition, the multi-head self-attention mechanism and a\ncoordinate attention layer enhance feature representation, streamlining the\ncreation of hand mesh vertices through sophisticated feature mapping and linear\ntransformation. Regarding performance, comprehensive evaluations on the\nFreiHand dataset demonstrate ReJSHand's computational prowess. It achieves a\nframe rate of 72 frames per second while maintaining a PA-MPJPE\n(Position-Accurate Mean Per Joint Position Error) of 6.3 mm and a PA-MPVPE\n(Position-Accurate Mean Per Vertex Position Error) of 6.4 mm. Moreover, our\nmodel reaches scores of 0.756 for F@05 and 0.984 for F@15, surpassing modern\npipelines and solidifying its position at the forefront of robotic hand pose\nestimators.

While sparse\noptimization has revolutionized model development by allowing data-driven\ndiscovery of parsimonious models from a library of possible equations, existing\napproaches for dynamical systems assume DAEs can be reduced to ODEs by\neliminating variables before model discovery. This assumption limits the\napplicability of such methods to DAE systems with unknown constraints and time\nscales.

By discovering the algebraic and dynamic components sequentially without\nprior identification of the algebraic variables, this approach leads to a\nsequence of convex optimization problems and has the advantage of discovering\ninterpretable models that preserve the structure of the underlying physical\nsystem.

This assessment helps determine the\nfracture's impact on spinal stability and the need for surgical intervention.\nHowever, the absence of pre-fracture CT scans and standardized vertebral\nreferences leads to measurement errors and inter-observer variability, while\nirregular compression patterns further challenge the precise grading of\nfracture severity. While deep learning methods have shown promise in aiding\nOVCFs screening, they often lack interpretability and sufficient sensitivity,\nlimiting their clinical applicability. To address these challenges, we\nintroduce a novel vertebra synthesis-height loss quantification-OVCFs grading\nframework. Our proposed model, HealthiVert-GAN, utilizes a coarse-to-fine\nsynthesis network designed to generate pseudo-healthy vertebral images that\nsimulate the pre-fracture state of fractured vertebrae. This model integrates\nthree auxiliary modules that leverage the morphology and height information of\nadjacent healthy vertebrae to ensure anatomical consistency. Additionally, we\nintroduce the Relative Height Loss of Vertebrae (RHLV) as a quantification\nmetric, which divides each vertebra into three sections to measure height loss\nbetween pre-fracture and post-fracture states, followed by fracture severity\nclassification using a Support Vector Machine (SVM). Our approach achieves\nstate-of-the-art classification performance on both the Verse2019 dataset and\nin-house dataset, and it provides cross-sectional distribution maps of\nvertebral height loss.
