    "abstract": "Analyzing operating room (OR) workflows to derive quantitative insights into\nOR efficiency is important for hospitals to maximize patient care and financial\nsustainability. Prior work on OR-level workflow analysis has relied on\nend-to-end deep neural networks. While these approaches work well in\nconstrained settings, they are limited to the conditions specified at\ndevelopment time and do not offer the flexibility necessary to accommodate the\nOR workflow analysis needs of various OR scenarios (e.g., large academic center\nvs. rural provider) without data collection, annotation, and retraining.\nReasoning segmentation (RS) based on foundation models offers this flexibility\nby enabling automated analysis of OR workflows from OR video feeds given only\nan implicit text query related to the objects of interest. Due to the reliance\non large language model (LLM) fine-tuning, current RS approaches struggle with\nreasoning about semantic/spatial relationships and show limited generalization\nto OR video due to variations in visual characteristics and domain-specific\nterminology. To address these limitations, we first propose a novel digital\ntwin (DT) representation that preserves both semantic and spatial relationships\nbetween the various OR components. Then, building on this foundation, we\npropose ORDiRS (Operating Room Digital twin representation for Reasoning\nSegmentation), an LLM-tuning-free RS framework that reformulates RS into a\n\"reason-retrieval-synthesize\" paradigm. Finally, we present ORDiRS-Agent, an\nLLM-based agent that decomposes OR workflow analysis queries into manageable RS\nsub-queries and generates responses by combining detailed textual explanations\nwith supporting visual evidence from RS. Experimental results on both an\nin-house and a public OR dataset demonstrate that our ORDiRS achieves a cIoU\nimprovement of 6.12%-9.74% compared to the existing state-of-the-arts.",

The study of blue straggler stars (BSS) provides insight into the\nmechanisms of stellar mass exchange during binary stellar evolution and the\ncomplex gravitational interactions within dense stellar systems. In\ncombination, they enhance our understanding of the possible life cycles of\nstars and the evolutionary pathways of star clusters.\n  Aim. We study the populations of BSSs in 41 globular clusters (GCs) and 42\nopen clusters (OCs) adopting photometry, proper motion, and parallax from the\nGaia Data Release 3 (DR3), confirming their cluster membership. We find a total\nof 4399 BSSs: all GCs show the presence of BSSs (3965 or ~90% of the sample),\nwhereas only 42 out of 129 studied OCs show the presence of BSSs (434 or ~10%\nof the sample). Clusters younger than ~500 Myr do not host any BSSs.\n  Methods. We derive their astrophysical parameters such as effective\ntemperature, surface gravity, and mass based on color-temperature relations,\nisochrone models and Gaia DR3 spectroscopy (if available). We find values for\n$T_{\\rm eff}=(6800 \\pm 585) \\ {\\rm K}$ and $(7570 \\pm 1400) \\ {\\rm K}$; and an\naverage mass of $\\langle M_{\\rm BSS} \\rangle = (1.02 \\pm 0.1) \\ {M_\\odot}$ and\n$\\langle M_{\\rm BSS} \\rangle = (1.75 \\pm 0.45) \\ {M_\\odot}$ for GCs and OCs,\nrespectively. We finally compute the difference of the BSS mass and the main\nsequence turn-off (MSTO) mass of its respective cluster, normalized by the MSTO\nmass, for every identified BSS.\n  Results. Based on this parameter and BSSs ages derived from isochrone models,\nwe find: i) GC BSSs that are most likely to be formed through collisions show a\n\"boost\" for ages ~ 1-2 Gyr, in agreement with ages for core-collapse events in\nGCs reported in previous studies; ii) a double sequence for GC BSSs that could\nindicate the hint of a pre/post-merger or close-binary scenario.",

This\ncomplexity class, one of six hardness levels identified by Chan and\nP\\u{a}tra\\c{s}cu [SODA 2010], includes diverse problems from several domains:\nCounting Inversions, string processing problems (BWT Construction, LZ77\nFactorization, Longest Common Substring, Batched Longest Previous Factor\nQueries, Batched Inverse Suffix Array Queries), and computational geometry\ntasks (Orthogonal Range Counting, Orthogonal Segment Intersection). We offer\ntwo main contributions:\n  We establish new links between the above string problems and Dictionary\nMatching, a classic task solvable using the Aho-Corasick automaton. We restrict\nDictionary Matching to instances with $O(n)$ binary patterns of length $m =\nO(\\log n)$ each, and we prove that, unless these instances can be solved in\n$o(n\\sqrt{\\log n})$ time, the aforementioned string problems cannot be solved\nfaster either.\n  Via further reductions, we extend this hardness to Counting Inversions (a\nfundamental component in geometric algorithms) and thus to Orthogonal Range\nCounting and Orthogonal Segment Intersection. This hinges on String Nesting, a\nnew problem which is equivalent to Dictionary Matching and can be reduced to\nCounting Inversions in three steps.\n  Together, our results unveil a single problem, with two equivalent\nformulations, that underlies the hardness of nearly all major problems\ncurrently occupying the $O(n\\sqrt{\\log n})$ level of hardness. These results\ndrastically funnel further efforts to improve the complexity of near-linear\nproblems.

Intrinsic motivation and transfer\nlearning have emerged as promising strategies to address this issue. Change\nBased Exploration Transfer (CBET), a technique that combines these two\napproaches for model-free algorithms, has shown potential in addressing sparse\nfeedback but its effectiveness with modern algorithms remains understudied.\nThis paper provides an adaptation of CBET for world model algorithms like\nDreamerV3 and compares the performance of DreamerV3 and IMPALA agents, both\nwith and without CBET, in the sparse reward environments of Crafter and\nMinigrid. Our tabula rasa results highlight the possibility of CBET improving\nDreamerV3's returns in Crafter but the algorithm attains a suboptimal policy in\nMinigrid with CBET further reducing returns. In the same vein, our transfer\nlearning experiments show that pre-training DreamerV3 with intrinsic rewards\ndoes not immediately lead to a policy that maximizes extrinsic rewards in\nMinigrid. Overall, our results suggest that CBET provides a positive impact on\nDreamerV3 in more complex environments like Crafter but may be detrimental in\nenvironments like Minigrid. In the latter case, the behaviours promoted by CBET\nin DreamerV3 may not align with the task objectives of the environment, leading\nto reduced returns and suboptimal policies.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel dissipativity-based distributed droop-free\ncontrol and communication topology co-design approach for voltage regulation\nand current sharing in DC microgrids (DC MGs) with generic ``ZIP'' loads. While\nZIP loads accurately capture the varied nature of the consumer loads, its\nconstant power load (CPL) component is particularly challenging (and\ndestabilizing) due to its non-linear form. Moreover, ensuring simultaneous\nvoltage regulation and current sharing and co-designing controllers and\ntopology are also challenging when designing control solutions for DC MGs. To\naddress these three challenges, we model the DC MG as a networked system\ncomprised of distributed generators (DGs), ZIP loads, and lines interconnected\naccording to a static interconnection matrix. Next, we equip each DG with a\nlocal controller and a distributed global controller (over an arbitrary\ntopology) to derive the error dynamic model of the DC MG as a networked\n``error'' system, including disturbance inputs and performance outputs.\nSubsequently, to co-design the controllers and the topology ensuring robust\n(dissipative) voltage regulation and current sharing performance, we use the\ndissipativity and sector boundedness properties of the involved subsystems and\nformulate Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) problems to be solved locally and\nglobally. To support the feasibility of the global LMI problem, we identify and\nembed several crucial necessary conditions in the corresponding local LMI\nproblems, thus providing a one-shot approach (as opposed to iterative schemes)\nto solve the LMI problems. Overall, the proposed approach in this paper\nprovides a unified framework for designing DC MGs. The effectiveness of the\nproposed solution was verified by simulating an islanded DC MG under different\nscenarios, demonstrating superior performance compared to traditional control\napproaches.",

The proof exploits\na connection to particle number conserving matchgate circuits with fermionic\nmagic state inputs, which are shown to be universal for quantum computation\nunder post-selection, and are therefore not classically simulable in the worst\ncase, in either the strong (multiplicative) or weak (sampling) sense. We apply\nthis result to quantum multi-reference methods designed for near-term hardware\nby ruling out certain dequantization strategies for computing the off-diagonal\nmatrix elements. We demonstrate these quantum speedups for two choices of\nreference state that incorporate both static and dynamic correlations to model\nthe electronic eigenstates of molecular systems: orbital-rotated matrix product\nstates, which are preparable in linear depth, and generalized unitary\ncoupled-cluster with single and double excitations, for which computing the\noff-diagonal matrix elements is $\\mathsf{BQP}$-complete for any polynomial\ndepth. In each case we discuss the implications for achieving exponential\nquantum advantage in quantum chemistry on near-term hardware.",

    "abstract": "In 1969 J. Verhoeff provided the first examples of a decimal error detecting\ncode using a single check digit to provide protection against all single,\ntransposition and adjacent twin errors. The three versions of such a code that\nhe presented are length 3-digit codes with 2 information digits. Existence of a\n4-digit code would imply the existence of 10 such disjoint 3-digit codes. This\npaper presents 3 pairwise disjoint 3-digit codes. The codes developed herein,\nhave the property that the knowledge of the multiset of digits included in a\nword is sufficient to determine the entire codeword even though their positions\nwere unknown. Thus the codes are permutation-free, and this fulfills Verhoeff's\ndesire to eliminate \"cyclic errors\". Phonetic errors, where 2 digit pairs of\nthe forms X0 and 1X are interchanged, are also eliminated.",

Sufficient conditions are established for local\nstability and stabilization based on quadratic Lyapunov functions, which also\nprovide ellipsoidal inner-estimates for the region of attraction and region of\nstabilizability of an equilibrium point. Our formulation exploits Petersen's\nLemma to convert the problem of certifying the sign-definiteness of the\nLyapunov condition into a line search over a single scalar parameter. The\nresulting linear matrix inequality (LMI) conditions scale quadratically with\nthe state dimension for both stability analysis and control synthesis, thus\nenabling analysis and control of QB systems with hundreds of state variables\nwithout resorting to specialized implementations. We demonstrate the approach\non three benchmark problems from the existing literature.

    "abstract": "The fractional quantum Hall state (FQHS), an incompressible liquid state\nhosting anyonic excitations with fractional charge and statistics, represents a\ncompelling many-body phase observed in clean two-dimensional (2D) carrier\nsystems. The expected non-Abelian nature of the FQHSs at even-denominator\nLandau level (LL) fillings has particularly sparked considerable recent\ninterest. At sufficiently small fillings, another exotic phase, namely a\nquantum Wigner crystal (WC) state, dominates. Here we report magneto-transport\nmeasurements in an ultrahigh-quality GaAs 2D \\textit{hole} system where the\nlarge hole effective mass leads to a significant LL mixing (LLM) even at very\nhigh magnetic fields and affects the many-body states at very small fillings.\nWe observe numerous developing FQHSs at both even- and odd-denominator\nfillings, deep in the insulating regime at $\\nu \\lesssim$ 1/3 where WC states\ndominate. The FQHSs we observe at odd-denominator fillings on the flanks of\n$\\nu=$ 1/4 and 1/6 are consistent with the Abelian Jain sequence of four-flux\nand six-flux composite fermions, while the ones at even-denominator fillings\n$\\nu=$ 1/4 and 1/6 are likely non-Abelian states emerging from the pairing of\nthese quasiparticles induced by severe LLM. Our results demonstrate that the\ncompetition between the FQHSs and WC phases is close at very small fillings\neven in the presence of severe LLM. We also measure activation energies of WC\nstates near $\\nu=$ 1/6, and find that they are substantially larger than what\nhas been reported for ultrahigh-quality GaAs 2D electrons. A moderate LLM is\nbelieved to lower the activation energy associated to the formation of WC\nintrinsic defects. The surprisingly large activation energy for our 2DHS with\nsignificant LLM is therefore puzzling, and may suggest a different type of\nintrinsic WC defect compared to that in 2D electrons.",

    "abstract": "Although speech recognition algorithms have developed quickly in recent\nyears, achieving high transcription accuracy across diverse audio formats and\nacoustic environments remains a major challenge. This work explores how\nincorporating custom language models with the open-source Vosk Toolkit can\nimprove speech-to-text accuracy in varied settings. Unlike many conventional\nsystems limited to specific audio types, this approach supports multiple audio\nformats such as WAV, MP3, FLAC, and OGG by using Python modules for\npreprocessing and format conversion.\n  A Python-based transcription pipeline was developed to process input audio,\nperform speech recognition using Vosk's KaldiRecognizer, and export the output\nto a DOCX file. Results showed that custom models reduced word error rates,\nespecially in domain-specific scenarios involving technical terminology, varied\naccents, or background noise.

In order to use this signal in a sample of galaxies to measure\nthe amplitude of primordial non-gaussianity, $f_{NL}$, we need to independently\ndetermine the degenerate bias coefficient, $b_\\Phi$, which quantifies the\nlogarithmic response of the galaxy number density to a change in amplitude of\nthe matter clustering. We study whether $b_\\Phi$ may be estimated from the\nobserved evolution of the number density of galaxies as a function of redshift.\nUsing cosmological N-body simulations, we find that $b_\\Phi$ may be estimated\nreasonably well for dark matter halos across the range of redshifts and halo\nmasses used by large-scale structure surveys aimed at measuring $f_{NL}$. This\nincludes non-gaussian secondary bias (or assembly bias) in halo concentration,\nwhich has previously been found to be quite large in amplitude. For an observed\nsurvey of galaxies, we additionally need to consider the selection function of\nthe sample, which can introduce redshift dependence via cuts on apparent\nmagnitude and colour.

    "abstract": "The irregular strip-packing problem consists of the computation of a\nnon-overlapping placement of a set of polygons onto a rectangular strip of\nfixed width and the minimal length possible. Recent performance gains of the\nMixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) solvers have encouraged the proposal of\nexact optimization models for nesting. The Dotted-Board (DB) MILP model solves\nthe discrete version of the nesting problem by constraining the positions of\nthe polygons to be on a grid of fixed points. However, its number of\nnon-overlapping constraints grows exponentially with the number of dots and\ntypes of polygons, which encouraged the proposal of a reformulation called the\nDB Clique Covering (DB-CC) that sets the current state-of-the-art by\nsignificantly reducing the constraints required. However, DB-CC requires a\nsignificant preprocessing time to compute edge and vertex clique coverings.\nMoreover, current knowledge of the stable set polytope suggests that achieving\na tighter formulation is unlikely. Thus, our hypothesis is that an ad-hoc exact\nalgorithm requiring no preprocessing might be a better option to solve the DB\nmodel than the costly Branch-and-Cut approach. This work proposes an exact\nbranch-and-bound-and-prune algorithm to solve the DB model from the conflict\ninverse graph based on ad-hoc data structures, bounding, and forward-checking\nfor pruning the search space. We introduce two 0-1 ILP DB reformulations with\ndiscrete rotations and a new lower-bound algorithm as by-products. Our\nexperiments show that DB-PB significantly reduces the resolution time compared\nto our replication of the DB-CC model. Seventeen open instances are solved up\nto optimality.",

The director\nangle is shown to decay in the far field inversely with distance to the dipole\nas is the case in the isotropic limit, but with a different angular dependence.\nTherefore elastic constant anisotropy modifies the elastic screening between\ndisclinations, with implications for the study of ensembles of defects as seen,\nfor example, in active matter in the extended system limit.",

However, assigning consistent overall\nquality ratings is challenging, prompting recent research to shift towards\ndetailed evaluations based on multiple specific safety criteria. This paper\nuncovers a consistent observation: safety rules characterized by high rating\nentropy are generally less reliable in identifying responses preferred by\nhumans. Leveraging this finding, we introduce ENCORE, a straightforward\nentropy-guided approach that composes multi-head rewards by downweighting rules\nexhibiting high rating entropy. Theoretically, we demonstrate that rules with\nelevated entropy naturally receive minimal weighting in the Bradley-Terry\noptimization framework, justifying our entropy-based penalization. Through\nextensive experiments on RewardBench safety tasks, our method significantly\nsurpasses several competitive baselines, including random weighting, uniform\nweighting, single-head Bradley-Terry models, and LLM-based judging methods.

    "abstract": "Investigating the public experience of urgent care facilities is essential\nfor promoting community healthcare development. Traditional survey methods\noften fall short due to limited scope, time, and spatial coverage.\nCrowdsourcing through online reviews or social media offers a valuable approach\nto gaining such insights. With recent advancements in large language models\n(LLMs), extracting nuanced perceptions from reviews has become feasible. This\nstudy collects Google Maps reviews across the DMV and Florida areas and\nconducts prompt engineering with the GPT model to analyze the aspect-based\nsentiment of urgent care. We first analyze the geospatial patterns of various\naspects, including interpersonal factors, operational efficiency, technical\nquality, finances, and facilities. Next, we determine Census Block\nGroup(CBG)-level characteristics underpinning differences in public perception,\nincluding population density, median income, GINI Index, rent-to-income ratio,\nhousehold below poverty rate, no insurance rate, and unemployment rate. Our\nresults show that interpersonal factors and operational efficiency emerge as\nthe strongest determinants of patient satisfaction in urgent care, while\ntechnical quality, finances, and facilities show no significant independent\neffects when adjusted for in multivariate models. Among socioeconomic and\ndemographic factors, only population density demonstrates a significant but\nmodest association with patient ratings, while the remaining factors exhibit no\nsignificant correlations. Overall, this study highlights the potential of\ncrowdsourcing to uncover the key factors that matter to residents and provide\nvaluable insights for stakeholders to improve public satisfaction with urgent\ncare.",

However, QST becomes impractical for reconstructing multi-qubit density\nmatrices since data sets and computational costs grow exponentially with qubit\nnumber. In this Letter, we introduce selective and efficient QST (SEEQST), an\napproach for efficiently estimating multiple selected elements of an arbitrary\n$N$-qubit density matrix. We show that any $N$-qubit density matrix can be\npartitioned into $2^N$ subsets, each containing $2^N$ elements. With SEEQST,\nany such subset can be accurately estimated from just two experiments with only\nsingle-qubit measurements. The complexity for estimating any subset remains\nconstant regardless of Hilbert-space dimension, so SEEQST can find the full\ndensity matrix using $2^{N+1} - 1$ experiments, where standard methods would\nuse $3^N$ experiments. We provide a circuit decomposition for the SEEQST\nexperiments, demonstrating that their maximum circuit depth scales\nlogarithmically with $N$ assuming all-to-all connectivity.

    "abstract": "In modern resource-sharing systems, multiple agents access limited resources\nwith unknown stochastic conditions to perform tasks. When multiple agents\naccess the same resource (arm) simultaneously, they compete for successful\nusage, leading to contention and reduced rewards. This motivates our study of\ncompetitive multi-armed bandit (CMAB) games. In this paper, we study a new\nN-player K-arm competitive MAB game, where non-myopic players (agents) compete\nwith each other to form diverse private estimations of unknown arms over time.\nTheir possible collisions on same arms and time-varying nature of arm rewards\nmake the policy analysis more involved than existing studies for myopic\nplayers. We explicitly analyze the threshold-based structures of social optimum\nand existing selfish policy, showing that the latter causes prolonged\nconvergence time $\\Omega(\\frac{K}{\\eta^2}\\ln({\\frac{KN}{\\delta}}))$, while\nsocially optimal policy with coordinated communication reduces it to\n$\\mathcal{O}(\\frac{K}{N\\eta^2}\\ln{(\\frac{K}{\\delta})})$. Based on the\ncomparison, we prove that the competition among selfish players for the best\narm can result in an infinite price of anarchy (PoA), indicating an arbitrarily\nlarge efficiency loss compared to social optimum. We further prove that no\ninformational (non-monetary) mechanism (including Bayesian persuasion) can\nreduce the infinite PoA, as the strategic misreporting by non-myopic players\nundermines such approaches. To address this, we propose a Combined\nInformational and Side-Payment (CISP) mechanism, which provides socially\noptimal arm recommendations with proper informational and monetary incentives\nto players according to their time-varying private beliefs. Our CISP mechanism\nkeeps ex-post budget balanced for social planner and ensures truthful reporting\nfrom players, achieving the minimum PoA=1 and same convergence time as social\noptimum.",

In the conventional FMT-SS, subcarrier\nbands are non-overlapping, leaving a spectral null between the adjacent\nsubcarrier bands.

The\ngenome's spatial organization inside the cell nucleus is critical for its\nproper function including gene regulation. The two major genomic compartments\n-- euchromatin and heterochromatin -- contain largely transcriptionally active\nand silenced genes, respectively, and exhibit distinct dynamics. In this work,\nwe present a hydrodynamic framework that describes the large-scale behavior of\neuchromatin and heterochromatin, and accounts for the interplay of mechanical\nforces, active processes, and nuclear confinement. Our model shows contractile\nstresses from cross-linking proteins lead to the formation of heterochromatin\ndroplets via mechanically driven phase separation. These droplets grow,\ncoalesce, and in nuclear confinement, wet the boundary. Active processes, such\nas gene transcription in euchromatin, introduce non-equilibrium fluctuations\nthat drive long-range, coherent motions of chromatin as well as the\nnucleoplasm, and thus alter the genome's spatial organization. These\nfluctuations also indirectly deform heterochromatin droplets, by continuously\nchanging their shape. Taken together, our findings reveal how active forces,\nmechanical stresses and hydrodynamic flows contribute to the genome's\norganization at large scales and provide a physical framework for understanding\nchromatin organization and dynamics in live cells.",

Developing strategies to manage\nflood risks requires flood projections with decision-relevant scales and\nwell-characterized uncertainties, often at high spatial resolutions. However,\ncalibrating high-resolution flood models can be computationally prohibitive. To\naddress this challenge, we propose a probabilistic downscaling approach that\nmaps low-resolution model projections onto higher-resolution grids. The\nexisting literature presents two distinct types of downscaling approaches: (1)\nprobabilistic methods, which are versatile and applicable across various\nphysics-based models, and (2) deterministic downscaling methods, specifically\ntailored for flood hazard models. Both types of downscaling approaches come\nwith their own set of mutually exclusive advantages. Here we introduce a new\napproach, PDFlood, that combines the advantages of existing probabilistic and\nflood model-specific downscaling approaches, mainly (1) spatial flooding\nprobabilities and (2) improved accuracy from approximating physical processes.\nCompared to the state of the art deterministic downscaling approach for flood\nhazard models, PDFlood allows users to consider previously neglected\nuncertainties while providing comparable accuracy, thereby better informing the\ndesign of risk management strategies.

To address these challenges, we\npropose DEMENTIA-PLAN, an innovative retrieval-augmented generation framework\nthat leverages large language models to enhance conversational support.

Through this multi-graph architecture, DEMENTIA-PLAN\ncomprehensively addresses both immediate care needs and facilitates deeper\nemotional resonance through personal memories, helping stabilize patient mood\nwhile providing reliable memory support. Our notable innovation is the\nself-reflection planning agent, which systematically coordinates knowledge\nretrieval and semantic integration across multiple knowledge graphs, while\nscoring retrieved content from daily routine and life memory graphs to\ndynamically adjust their retrieval weights for optimized response generation.\nDEMENTIA-PLAN represents a significant advancement in the clinical application\nof large language models for dementia care, bridging the gap between AI tools\nand caregivers interventions.",

IPTA datasets should be the most sensitive datasets to nanohertz\ngravitational waves (GWs), but take years to assemble, often excluding valuable\nrecent data. To address this, we introduce the IPTA \"Lite\" analysis, where a\nFigure of Merit is used to select an optimal PTA dataset to analyze for each\npulsar, enabling immediate access to new data and preliminary results prior to\nfull combination. We test the capabilities of the Lite analysis using IPTA DR2,\nfinding that \"DR2 Lite\" can be used to detect the common red noise process with\nan amplitude of $A = 4.8^{+1.8}_{-1.8} \\times 10^{-15}$ at $\\gamma = 13/3$.\nThis amplitude is slightly large in comparison to the combined analysis, and\nlikely biased high as DR2 Lite is more sensitive to systematic errors from\nindividual pulsars than the full dataset. Furthermore, although there is no\nstrong evidence for Hellings-Downs correlations in IPTA DR2, we still find the\nfull dataset is better at resolving Hellings-Downs correlations than DR2 Lite.\nAlongside the Lite analysis, we also find that analyzing a subset of pulsars\nfrom IPTA DR2, available at a hypothetical \"early\" stage of combination (EDR2),\nyields equally competitive results as the full dataset. Looking ahead, the Lite\nmethod will enable rapid synthesis of the latest PTA data, offering preliminary\nGW constraints before the superior full dataset combinations are available.",

We evaluate AILA on three\nchallenging tasks: price forecasting for various commodities and indices (S&P\n500, Gold, US dollar Futures, Coffee, Wheat), image recognition using the\nCIFAR-10 dataset, and sentiment analysis on the IMDB movie review dataset. In\nall cases, AILA matches strong deep learning baselines (LSTMs, Transformers,\nand ResNets), achieving it at a fraction of the training and inference time.\nNotably, we implement and test two versions of the model - AILA-Architecture 1,\nwhich uses simple linear layers as the connection mechanism between layers, and\nAILA-Architecture 2, which implements an attention mechanism to selectively\nfocus on outputs from previous layers. Both architectures are applied in a\nsingle-task learning setting, with each model trained separately for individual\ntasks. Results confirm that AILA's adaptive inter-layer connections yield\nrobust gains by flexibly reusing pertinent features at multiple network depths.\nThe AILA approach thus presents an extension to existing architectures,\nimproving long-range sequence modeling, image recognition with optimised\ncomputational speed, and SOTA classification performance in practice.",

The interaction between these two objects can drive\nrelativistic outflows, either jets or winds, in which particles can be\naccelerated to energies reaching hundreds of tera-electronvolts (TeV). It is\nhowever still debated where and under which physical conditions particles are\naccelerated in these objects and ultimately whether protons can be accelerated\nup to PeV energies. Among the well-known gamma-ray binaries, LS 5039 is a\nhigh-mass X-ray binary (HMXB) with an orbital period of 3.9 days that has been\nobserved up to TeV energies by the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.).\nIn this work, we present new observations of LS 5039 obtained with the High\nAltitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) observatory. Our data reveal that the gamma-ray\nspectrum of LS 5039 extends up to 200 TeV with no apparent spectral cut-off.\nFurthermore, we confirm, with a confidence level of 4.7{\\sigma}, that the\nemission between 2 TeV and 118 TeV is modulated by the orbital motion of the\nsystem, which indicates that these photons are likely produced within or near\nthe binary orbit where they can undergo absorption by the stellar photons. In a\nleptonic scenario, the highest energy photons detected by HAWC can be emitted\nby ~200 TeV electrons inverse Compton scattering stellar photons, which would\nrequire an extremely efficient acceleration mechanism operating within LS 5039.\nAlternatively, a hadronic scenario could explain the data through proton-proton\nor proton-{\\gamma} collisions of protons accelerated to peta-electronvolt (PeV)\nenergies.",

In rotating anode X-ray tubes, the most common design, thermal\nradiation is a bottleneck that prevents efficient cooling of the\nanode$\\unicode{x2014}$the hottest part of the device by far.

The focal spot size, which is related to the\nspatial coherence of generated X-rays, can also be made smaller at a constant\ntemperature. A major advantage of our \"nanophotonic thermal management\"\napproach is that in principle, it allows for complete control over the spectrum\nand direction of thermal radiation, which can lead to optimal thermal routing\nand improved performance.",

However, the methods to estimate this key\nproperty often rely on uncertain assumptions about geometry, depend on overly\nsimplistic uniform models, or require time-expensive observations to constrain\nthe gas temperature as well. An easy-to-use method to derive n(H2) that is\nvalid under realistic conditions is absent, causing an asymmetry in how\naccurately this parameter is estimated, and how often dedicated tracers are\nused, compared to the gas temperature. We propose and calibrate a versatile\ntool based on CH3OH lines that greatly simplifies the inference of the number\ndensity. CH3OH is abundant in both cold and hot gas, and thus it can be applied\nto a wide variety of scales. Moreover, this tool does not need to be tailored\nto the specific source properties (e.g. distance, temperature, and mass). We\nperform RT calculations to investigate the robustness of the line ratios as\ndensity probes, also in the presence of density and temperature gradients. We\nfind that the ratios of the (2_K-1_K) band transitions constrain the average\nn(H2) along the LOS within a factor of 2-3 in the range 5 x 10^4 - 3 x 10^7\ncm^-3. The range can be extended down to a few times 10^3 cm^-3, when also\nusing line ratios from the (5_K-4_K) and/or (7_K-6_K) bands. We provide\npractical analytic formulas and a numerical method for deriving n(H2) and its\nuncertainty from the line ratios. Thanks to our calibration and analytical\nrecipes, we make the estimate of n(H2) much simpler, with an effort comparable\nor inferior to deriving Tex, contributing to offsetting the disparity between\nthese two fundamental parameters of the molecular gas. Applying our method to a\nsub-sample of sources from the ATLASGAL TOP100 we show that the material in the\nclumps is being compressed, accelerating in the latest stages.",

The Quantum\nMax d-Cut (d-QMC) problem asks for the largest eigenvalue of a Hamiltonian on a\ngraph with n vertices whose edges correspond to swap operators acting on\n$(\\mathbb C^d)^{\\otimes n}$. The algebra generated by the swap operators is\nidentified as a quotient of a free algebra modulo symmetric group relations and\na single additional relation of degree d. This presentation leads to a tailored\nhierarchy of semidefinite programs, leveraging noncommutative polynomial\noptimization (NPO) methods, that converges to the solution of the d-QMC\nproblem. For complete bipartite graphs, exact solutions for the d-QMC problem\nare derived using the representation theory of symmetric groups and\nLittlewood-Richardson coefficients. This in particular includes the d-QMC\nproblem for clique and star graphs on n vertices, for all d and n. Lastly, the\npaper addresses a refined d-QMC problem focused on finding the largest\neigenvalue within each isotypic component (irreducible block) of the graph\nHamiltonian. It is shown that the spectrum of the star graph Hamiltonian\ndistinguishes between isotypic components of the 3-QMC problem. For general d,\nlow-degree relations for separating isotypic components are presented, enabling\nadaptation of the global NPO hierarchy to efficiently compute the largest\neigenvalue in each isotypic component.",

It is a versatile and\nwidely-used tool for scientists studying protein aggregation kinetics, as it\nenables the isolation and separate study of discrete reaction steps\ncontributing to protein aggregation, specifically elongation and secondary\nnucleation. However, the seeding levels required to achieve dominating effects\non each of these steps separately have been established largely by\ntrial-and-error, due in part to the lack of availability of integrated rate\nlaws valid for moderate to high seeding levels and generally applicable to all\ncommon underlying reaction mechanisms. Here, we improve on a recently developed\nmathematical method based on Lie symmetries for solving differential equations,\nand with it derive such an integrated rate law. We subsequently develop simple\nexpressions for the amounts of seed required to isolate each step. We\nrationalize the empirical observation that fibril seeds must often be broken up\ninto small pieces to successfully isolate elongation. We also derive\nexpressions for average fibril lengths at different times in the aggregation\nreaction, and explore different methods to break up fibrils. This paper will\nprovide an invaluable reference for future experimental and theoretical studies\nin which seeding techniques are employed, and should enable more sophisticated\nanalyses than have been performed to date.",

For trees with\ncoordination number z, such circuits can be built from z-site gates. We then\nintroduce a family of gates for which the dynamics is exactly solvable; these\nsatisfy a set of constraints that we term 'tree-unitarity'. Notably,\ntree-unitarity reduces to the previously-established notion of dual-unitarity\nfor z = 2, when the tree reduces to a line. Among the unexpected features of\ntree-unitarity is a trade-off between 'maximum butterfly velocity' dynamics of\nout-of-time-order correlators and the existence of non-vanishing correlation\nfunctions in multiple directions, a tension absent in one-dimensional\ndual-unitary models and their Euclidean generalizations. We connect the\nexistence of (a wide class of) solvable dynamics with non-maximal butterfly\nvelocity directly to a property of the underlying circuit geometry called\n$\\delta$-hyperbolicity, and argue that such dynamics can only arise in\nnon-Euclidean geometries.

The emergence of generative AI has eased the\ngeneration of varied poisoned samples. Robustness across types of triggers is\ncrucial to effective defense. We propose Prototype Guided Backdoor Defense\n(PGBD), a robust post-hoc defense that scales across different trigger types,\nincluding previously unsolved semantic triggers.

Emotion Recognition in Conversation (ERC)\naddresses this limitation, yet existing methods struggle to align multimodal\nfeatures and explain why emotions evolve within dialogues. To bridge this gap,\nwe propose GatedxLSTM, a novel speech-text multimodal ERC model that explicitly\nconsiders voice and transcripts of both the speaker and their conversational\npartner(s) to identify the most influential sentences driving emotional shifts.\nBy integrating Contrastive Language-Audio Pretraining (CLAP) for improved\ncross-modal alignment and employing a gating mechanism to emphasise emotionally\nimpactful utterances, GatedxLSTM enhances both interpretability and\nperformance. Additionally, the Dialogical Emotion Decoder (DED) refines emotion\npredictions by modelling contextual dependencies. Experiments on the IEMOCAP\ndataset demonstrate that GatedxLSTM achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA)\nperformance among open-source methods in four-class emotion classification.\nThese results validate its effectiveness for ERC applications and provide an\ninterpretability analysis from a psychological perspective.",

We\ndemonstrate that this evolution in dark energy can be explained by cosmic\ninhomogeneities and the Cosmic Web without modifying fundamental physics. Our\nmodel shows how the differential expansion between underdense voids and\noverdense walls creates an effective backreaction term that simulates evolving\ndark energy when interpreted within homogeneous cosmological frameworks. The\ninhomogeneous cosmic structure formation becomes significant $z\\sim 1-2$, the\nincreasing gravitational influence of wall regions counteracting the cosmic\nacceleration, producing both a weakening acceleration signal and a\ndirection-dependent Hubble parameter consistent with local measurements. This\nmechanism reconciles the higher locally measured Hubble constant $H_0\\approx\n73~ km/s/Mpc$ with the lower value inferred from CMB observations $H_0\\approx\n67-69~ km/s/Mpc$ without introducing new energy components or modifying general\nrelativity.

We apply this decay condition to\nextremal black holes derived in some UV completions of the Maxwell sector.

We show that the charge growth bound implies\npositivity of the $U(1)$ gauge coupling beta function. This provides an\nindependent argument that classically stable (embedded-Abelian) colored black\nholes cannot exist. The charge growth bound constrains conformal hidden sector\nmodels, and is always satisfied in their AdS dual realizations.",

However, as with all modelling,\nonly an approximation is made in the description of the biological and physical\nsystem. Here we show that tissue-scale spatial structure can have a profound\nimpact on the resilience of tumours to immunotherapy using a classical model\nincorporating IL-2 compounds and effector cells as treatment parameters. Using\nlinear stability analysis, numerical continuation, and direct simulations, we\nshow that diffusing cancer cell populations can undergo pattern-forming\n(Turing) instabilities, leading to spatially-structured states that persist far\ninto treatment regimes where the corresponding spatially homogeneous systems\nwould uniformly predict a cancer-free state. These spatially-patterned states\npersist in a wide range of parameters, as well as under time-dependent\ntreatment regimes. Incorporating treatment via domain boundaries can increase\nthis resistance to treatment in the interior of the domain, further\nhighlighting the importance of spatial modelling when designing treatment\nprotocols informed by mathematical models. Counter-intuitively, this mechanism\nshows that increased effector cell mobility can increase the resilience of\ntumours to treatment.

To\naddress this, we tackle the more challenging domain-label agnostic SSDG, where\ndomain labels for unlabeled data are not available during training. First, we\npropose a feature modulation strategy that enhances class-discriminative\nfeatures while suppressing domain-specific information. This modulation shifts\nfeatures toward Similar Average Representations-a modified version of class\nprototypes-that are robust across domains, encouraging the classifier to\ndistinguish between closely related classes and feature extractor to form\ntightly clustered, domain-invariant representations. Second, to mitigate domain\nnoise and improve pseudo-label accuracy, we introduce a loss-scaling function\nthat dynamically lowers the fixed confidence threshold for pseudo-labels,\noptimizing the use of unlabeled data. With these key innovations, our approach\nachieves significant improvements on four major domain generalization\nbenchmarks-even without domain labels. We will make the code available.",

Our best-fit model is a\n2-component 5th-degree harmonic model with an unprecedentedly constrained\neastward hotspot offset of $33.0^{+0.7}_{-0.9}$ degrees. We rule out a strong\nhemispheric latitudinal hotspot offset, as 3+ component maps providing\nlatitudinal degrees of freedom are strongly disfavored. As in previous studies\nwe find some model dependence in longitudinal hotspot offset; when we explore\nand combine a range of proximal models to avoid an overly constrained\nconfidence region, we find an eastward hotspot offset of $32.5^{+3.0}_{-10.6}$\ndegrees, indicating the presence of a strong eastward zonal jet.

Furthermore, we performed spectral and\nspectro-polarimetric analyses combining IXPE data with archival observations\nfrom NuSTAR, XMM-Newton, and Swift-XRT to derive detailed spectral and\npolarization properties. From the spectro-polarimetric analyses, an upper limit\non the polarization degree (PD) of 7.6% (at the 99% confidence) was estimated\nin the 2-8 keV band. The spectro-polarimetric analysis in the 5.66-8 keV band\nyielded a looser upper limit of 27% at the 99 % confidence. Comparing the\nmeasured polarization properties, coronal parameters, and inclination angle of\nNGC 2110 with the Monte Carlo radiative transfer (MONK) simulations suggest\nthat the current polarization measurements lack the sensitivity to place\ndefinitive constraints on the coronal geometry. The upper limits on PD, as\nderived from our analysis at the 99% confidence level, indicate that\npolarization remains undetected at a statistically significant level.\nConsequently, we are unable to determine whether the corona is elongated along\nthe disk or more compact and spherical.

Current models of\npolluted WDs frequently fail to account for this effect, although its inclusion\ncan increase the inferred accretion rate by orders of magnitude. It has been\nargued that this instability cannot be treated as a continuous mixing process\nand thus should not be considered in these models. In this work, we study\nthree-dimensional simulations of a thermohaline-unstable layer propagating into\nan underlying stable region, approximating the polluted WD scenario. We find\nthat although thermohaline convection works to reduce driving gradients\nsomewhat, the front continues to propagate and the system remains unstable.\nImportantly, the turbulent flux of metals broadly dominates over the diffusive\nflux in quantitative agreement with with existing mixing prescriptions\nimplemented in some stellar evolution models (except slightly below the\nboundary of the propagating front, where recent prescriptions neglect\novershoot-like effects). Thus, our results broadly support polluted WD models\nthat include thermohaline mixing in their estimates of the settling rate.",

In the absence\nof large quantum computers to empirically evaluate performance, theoretical\nframeworks such as the quantum probably approximately correct (PAC) and quantum\nstatistical query (QSQ) models have been proposed to study quantum algorithms\nfor learning classical functions. Despite numerous works investigating quantum\nadvantage in these models, we nevertheless only understand it at two extremes:\neither exponential quantum advantages for uniform input distributions or no\nadvantage for potentially adversarial distributions. In this work, we study the\ngap between these two regimes by designing an efficient quantum algorithm for\nlearning periodic neurons in the QSQ model over a broad range of non-uniform\ndistributions, which includes Gaussian, generalized Gaussian, and logistic\ndistributions. To our knowledge, our work is also the first result in quantum\nlearning theory for classical functions that explicitly considers real-valued\nfunctions. Recent advances in classical learning theory prove that learning\nperiodic neurons is hard for any classical gradient-based algorithm, giving us\nan exponential quantum advantage over such algorithms, which are the standard\nworkhorses of machine learning.

Making\nuse of the most up-to-date models for zero-metal and low-metallicity stars, we\ninvestigate the possible sources of $^{13}$C at low metallicity and verify\nwhether massive stars could be the sole responsible for the $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C\nratio observed in halo stars.

We find that stars\nwithout H-He shell mergers do not produce enough $^{13}$C to be compatible with\nthe observations. Instead, the primary production by shell mergers and later\nejection during the supernova explosion can explain 30 < $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C <\n100. The observations are best reproduced assuming a large frequency of shell\nmergers. The $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C < 30 can only be reproduced assuming an outer\nlayer ejection and no explosion, but requiring a larger production of $^{12}$C\nand $^{13}$C.

However, generating visual\nnarratives that are faithful to the input text and self-consistent across\ngenerated images remains an open challenge, due to the lack of knowledge\nconstraints used for planning the stories. In this work, we propose a new\nbenchmark, VinaBench, to address this challenge. Our benchmark annotates the\nunderlying commonsense and discourse constraints in visual narrative samples,\noffering systematic scaffolds for learning the implicit strategies of visual\nstorytelling. Based on the incorporated narrative constraints, we further\npropose novel metrics to closely evaluate the consistency of generated\nnarrative images and the alignment of generations with the input textual\nnarrative. Our results across three generative vision models demonstrate that\nlearning with VinaBench's knowledge constraints effectively improves the\nfaithfulness and cohesion of generated visual narratives.",

In the high-saturation regime, a coherent interaction\nis established between the vibrational and electronic degrees of freedom, and\nmolecules can simulate several cavity QED models, whereby a specific\nvibrational mode plays the role of the cavity mode. Focusing on the specific\nexample where the system is turned into an analogue simulator of the quantum\nRabi model, the steady state exhibits vibrational bi-modality resulting in a\nstatistical mixture of highly non-classical vibronic cat states. Applying our\nparadigm to molecules with prominent spatial asymmetry and combining an optical\nexcitation with a THz(IR) driving, the system can be turned into a single\nphoton transducer. Two possible implementations are discussed based on the\ncoupling to a subwavelength THz patch antenna or a resonant metamaterial. In a\nnutshell, this work assesses the role of molecules as an optomechanical quantum\ntoolbox for creating hybrid entangled states of electrons, photons, and\nvibrations, hence enabling frequency conversion over very different energy\nscales.",

We argue, based on an analysis of their superconducting\nspectra, that anomalous properties seen in the most-studied overdoped cuprates\nrequire a pairing interaction that is strongly inhomogeneous on nm length\nscales. This is consistent with recent proposals that the \"strange-metal\" phase\nabove $T_c$ in the same doping range arises from a spatially random\ninteraction. We show, via mean-field Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) calculations\nand time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau (TDGL) simulations, that key features of the\nobserved tunneling spectra are reproduced when both inhomogeneity and thermal\nphase fluctuations are accounted for. In accord with experiments, BdG\ncalculations find that low-$T$ spectra are highly inhomogeneous and exhibit a\nlow-energy spectral shoulder and broad coherence peaks. However, the spectral\ngap in this approach becomes homogeneous at high $T$, in contrast to\nexperiments. This is resolved when thermal fluctuations are included; in this\ncase, global phase coherence is lost at the superconducting $T_c$ via a\nbroadened BKT transition, while robust phase-coherent superconducting islands\npersist well above $T_c$. The local spectrum remains inhomogeneous at $T_c$.",

We clearly detected a QPO in the\nX-ray and O-IR bands during all three epochs. The QPO evolved, drifting from\n1.4 Hz in the first epoch, up to 2.2 Hz in the second and finally reaching 4.2\nHz at the third epoch. These are among the highest O-IR QPO frequencies\ndetected for a black hole X-ray transient. During the first two epochs, the\nX-ray and O-IR emission are correlated, with an optical lag (compared to the\nX-rays) varying from +70 ms to 0 ms. Finally, during the third epoch, we\nmeasured for the first time, a lag of the $z_s$-band respect to the $g_s$-band\nat the QPO frequency ($\\approx$+10 ms). By estimating the variable O-IR SED we\nfind that the emission is most likely non-thermal. Current state-of-the-art\nmodels can explain some of these properties, but neither the jet nor the hot\nflow model can easily explain the observed evolution of the QPOs. While this\nallowed us to put tight constraints on these components, more frequent coverage\nof the state transition with fast multi-wavelength observations is still needed\nto fully understand the evolution of the disc/jet properties in BH LMXBs.",

    "abstract": "Once galaxies settle their discs and become self-gravitating, stellar bars\ncan form, driving the subsequent evolution of their host galaxy. Determining\nthe ages of bars can therefore shed light on the epoch of the onset of secular\nevolution. In this work, we apply the first broadly applicable methodology to\nderive bar ages to a sample of 20 nearby galaxies. The method is based on the\nco-eval build-up of nuclear structures and bars and involves using IFS data\nfrom the MUSE instrument on VLT to disentangle the SFH of the nuclear disc from\nthe background population. This allows us to derive the formation epoch of the\nnuclear disc and, thus, of the bar. We estimate the bar formation epoch of\nnearby galaxies - mostly from the TIMER survey-, creating the largest sample of\ngalaxies with known bar ages to date. We find bar formation epochs between 1\nand 13 Gyr ago, illustrating how disc-settling and bar formation are processes\nthat first took place in the early Universe and are still taking place in some\ngalaxies. We infer the bar fraction over cosmological time with our sample,\nfinding remarkable agreement with that obtained from direct studies of galaxies\nat high redshifts. Additionally, for the first time, we can investigate secular\nevolution processes taking into account the ages of bars. Our results agree\nwith the scenario in which bars aid the quenching of the host galaxy, with\ngalaxies hosting older bars tending to be more \"quenched\". We also find that\nolder bars tend to be longer, stronger, and host larger nuclear discs.\nFurthermore, we find evidence of the nuclear disc stellar mass build-up over\ntime. On the other hand, we find no evidence of downsizing playing a role in\nbar formation, since we find that bar age is independent of galaxy stellar\nmass. With the means to estimate bar ages, we can begin to understand better\nwhen and how bars shape the observed properties of disc galaxies.",

This\nrequires that the target space has an isometry with compact orbits that acts\nwithout fixed points. Our approach allows us to include target spaces without\nnon-trivial 1-cycles, does not require the NLSM to be conformal, and when it is\nconformal it does not need to be rational; moreover, it highlights the\nmicroscopic origin of the topological terms that are responsible for the\nnon-invertibility of the defect. An interesting class of examples are\nWess-Zumino-Witten models, which are self-dual under a discrete gauging of a\nsubgroup of the isometry symmetry and so host a topological defect line with\nTambara-Yamagami fusion.

The\nstable crystal structure above the CDW transition is identified via soft phonon\ncondensation and confirmed to be harmonically stable through ab initio\ncalculations, consistent with recent X-ray diffraction refinements. The\nelectron-phonon coupling (EPC) in LaRu$_3$Si$_2$ is found to be mode-selective,\nprimarily driven by strong interactions between Ru-$B_{3u}$ phonons (local\n$x$-direction, pointing toward the hexagon center) and Ru-$A_g$ electrons\n(local $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital) within the kagome lattice. Using a spring-ball\nmodel, we identify this mode-selective EPC as a universal feature of kagome\nmaterials. Employing the newly developed Gaussian approximation of the hopping\nparameters, we derive an analytical expression for the EPC and demonstrate that\nsuperconductivity in LaRu$_3$Si$_2$ is mostly driven by the coupling between\nthe kagome $B_{3u}$ phonons and the $A_g$ electrons. The impact of doping is\nalso investigated, revealing that light hole doping (approximately one hole per\nunit cell) significantly enhances the superconducting critical temperature\n$T_c$ by 50%, whereas heavy doping induces structural instability and\nferromagnetism. Furthermore, high-throughput screening identifies 3063 stable\n1:3:2 kagome materials, of which 428 are predicted to exhibit superconductivity\nwith $T_c > 1$ K, and the highest $T_c$ reaching 15 K. These findings establish\nLaRu$_3$Si$_2$ and related materials as promising platforms for exploring the\ninterplay among kagome flat bands, EPC, and superconductivity. Additionally,\nthey may offer valuable insights into potential limitations on the $T_c$ of\nflat-band superconductivity in real materials.",

The non-axisymmetric\nstructures in the disk (e.g., the bar or spiral arms) have been suspected to be\nthe major source for such a perturbation. However, both the lifetime and the\nperiod of these internal perturbations are typically longer than the period at\nwhich stars oscillate vertically, implying that the perturbation is generally\nadiabatic. This issue is particularly pronounced in the inner Galaxy, where the\nvertical oscillation period is shorter and therefore adiabatically shielded\nmore than the outer disk. We show that two-armed phase spirals can naturally\nform in the inner disk if there is a vertical resonance that breaks the\nadiabaticity; otherwise, their formation requires a perturber with an\nunrealistically short lifetime. We predict analytically and confirm with\nsimulations that a steadily rotating (non-winding) two-armed phase spiral forms\nnear the resonance when stars are subject to both periodic perturbations (e.g.,\nby spiral arms) and stochastic perturbations (e.g., by giant molecular clouds).\nDue to the presence of multiple resonances, the vertical phase-space exhibits\nseveral local phase spirals that rotate steadily at distinct frequencies,\ntogether forming a global phase spiral that evolves over time. Our results\ndemonstrate that, contrary to earlier predictions, the formation of the\ntwo-armed phase spiral does not require transient perturbations with lifetimes\nshorter than the vertical oscillation period.",

Over time, they grow by accreting and\ndisrupting satellite galaxies, adding those stars to the brightest cluster\ngalaxy (BCG) and the intra-cluster light (ICL). However, the formation pathways\nof different galaxy clusters can vary significantly. To inform upcoming large\nsurveys, we aim to identify observables that can distinguish galaxy cluster\nformation pathways. Using four different hydrodynamical simulations,\nMagneticum, TNG100 of IllustrisTNG, Horizon-AGN, and Hydrangea, we study how\nthe fraction of stellar mass in the BCG and ICL ($f_{ICL+BCG}$) relates to the\ngalaxy cluster mass assembly history. For all simulations, $f_{ICL+BCG}$ is the\nbest tracer for the time at which the cluster has accumulated 50% of its mass\n($z_{f}$), performing better than other typical dynamical tracers, such as the\nsubhalo mass fraction, the halo mass, and the center shift. More relaxed\nclusters have higher $f_{ICL+BCG}$, in rare cases up to 90%, while dynamically\nactive clusters have lower fractions, down to 20%, which we find to be\nindependent of the exact implemented baryonic physics. We determine the average\nincrease in $f_{ICL+BCG}$ from stripping and mergers to be between 3-4% per\nGyr. $f_{ICL+BCG}$ is tightly traced by the stellar mass ratio between the BCG\nand both the second (M12) and fourth (M14) most massive cluster galaxy. The\naverage galaxy cluster has assembled half of its halo mass by $z_{f}=0.67$\n(about 6 Gyr ago), though individual histories vary significantly from\n$z_{f}=0.06$ to $z_{f}=1.77$ (0.8 to 10 Gyr ago). As all four cosmological\nsimulations consistently find that $f_{ICL+BCG}$ is an excellent tracer of the\ncluster dynamical state, upcoming surveys can leverage measurements of\n$f_{ICL+BCG}$ to statistically quantify the assembly of the most massive\nstructures.",

Only 14% of field galaxies on the star\nformation main sequence at z~0 actually evolved along the scaling relation,\nwhile the bulk of star forming galaxies in the local universe have undergone\ncycles of quenching and rejuvenation. In this work we describe the statistics\nof these galaxy evolution modes and how this impacts their stellar masses, ages\nand metallicities today. Galaxies with rejuvenation cycles can be distinguished\nwell from main-sequence-evolved galaxies in their features at z~0. We further\nexplore possible explanations and find that the geometry of gas accretion at\nthe halo outskirts shows a strong correlation with the star formation rate\nevolution, while the density parameter as a tracer of environment shows no\nsignificant correlation.

Compared to prior skill estimation\ndatasets, our dataset includes a massive number of skilled participants with\nunprecedented diversity in terms of gender, age, skill level, geographical\nlocation, etc. BASKET includes 20 fine-grained basketball skills, challenging\nmodern video recognition models to capture the intricate nuances of player\nskill through in-depth video analysis. Given a long highlight video (8-10\nminutes) of a particular player, the model needs to predict the skill level\n(e.g., excellent, good, average, fair, poor) for each of the 20 basketball\nskills. Our empirical analysis reveals that the current state-of-the-art video\nmodels struggle with this task, significantly lagging behind the human\nbaseline. We believe that BASKET could be a useful resource for developing new\nvideo models with advanced long-range, fine-grained recognition capabilities.\nIn addition, we hope that our dataset will be useful for domain-specific\napplications such as fair basketball scouting, personalized player development,\nand many others.

    "abstract": "Autonomous agents powered by foundation models have seen widespread adoption\nacross various real-world applications. However, they remain highly vulnerable\nto malicious instructions and attacks, which can result in severe consequences\nsuch as privacy breaches and financial losses. More critically, existing\nguardrails for LLMs are not applicable due to the complex and dynamic nature of\nagents. To tackle these challenges, we propose ShieldAgent, the first guardrail\nagent designed to enforce explicit safety policy compliance for the action\ntrajectory of other protected agents through logical reasoning. Specifically,\nShieldAgent first constructs a safety policy model by extracting verifiable\nrules from policy documents and structuring them into a set of action-based\nprobabilistic rule circuits. Given the action trajectory of the protected\nagent, ShieldAgent retrieves relevant rule circuits and generates a shielding\nplan, leveraging its comprehensive tool library and executable code for formal\nverification. In addition, given the lack of guardrail benchmarks for agents,\nwe introduce ShieldAgent-Bench, a dataset with 3K safety-related pairs of agent\ninstructions and action trajectories, collected via SOTA attacks across 6 web\nenvironments and 7 risk categories. Experiments show that ShieldAgent achieves\nSOTA on ShieldAgent-Bench and three existing benchmarks, outperforming prior\nmethods by 11.3% on average with a high recall of 90.1%. Additionally,\nShieldAgent reduces API queries by 64.7% and inference time by 58.2%,\ndemonstrating its high precision and efficiency in safeguarding agents.",

In this paper, we propose a new approach to\ncausal inference using panel data with large large $N$ and $T$. Our approach\nimputes the untreated potential outcomes for treated units using the outcomes\nfor untreated individuals with similar values of the latent confounders. In\norder to find units with similar latent characteristics, we utilize long\npre-treatment histories of the outcomes. Our analysis is based on a\nnonparametric, nonlinear, and nonseparable factor model for untreated potential\noutcomes and treatments. The model satisfies minimal smoothness requirements.\nWe impute both missing counterfactual outcomes and propensity scores using\nkernel smoothing based on the constructed measure of latent similarity between\nunits, and demonstrate that our estimates can achieve the optimal nonparametric\nrate of convergence up to log terms. Using these estimates, we construct a\ndoubly robust estimator of the period-specifc average treatment effect on the\ntreated (ATT), and provide conditions, under which this estimator is\n$\\sqrt{N}$-consistent, and asymptotically normal and unbiased.

How can these decisions be made such that the\nresulting designs are successful? This paper proposes a method for design\nalgorithm selection, which aims to select design algorithms that will produce a\ndistribution of design labels satisfying a user-specified success criterion --\nfor example, that at least ten percent of designs' labels exceed a threshold.\nIt does so by combining designs' predicted property values with held-out\nlabeled data to reliably forecast characteristics of the label distributions\nproduced by different design algorithms, building upon techniques from\nprediction-powered inference. The method is guaranteed with high probability to\nreturn design algorithms that yield successful label distributions (or the null\nset if none exist), if the density ratios between the design and labeled data\ndistributions are known.

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a theoretical framework for a Transformer-augmented,\nsectional Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture that aims to enhance\ncomputational efficiency while preserving model scalability. Unlike\nconventional MoE models, which route entire token embeddings to selected\nexperts, our approach portions the embedding dimension itself -- assigning\nsegments of each token's representation to dedicated experts. To combat losses\nin token representation, we utilize a pre-expert transformer layer to recompute\nattention across tokens and reduce the sequence length dimensionality. We\nextend our theory by deriving optimal scaling laws that a non-linear\nrelationship between the number of experts and factors such as model\ndimensionality, sequence length, and system overhead. These formulations yield\nclosed-form and numerically-solvable expressions for identifying the optimal\nexpert count under given architectural and hardware constraints. As a result,\nour framework not only provides theoretical bounds for computing efficiency\nwith varying frameworks but also guides practical design choices for scaling\nlarge models effectively.

We focus on two properties\nthat affect the choice of alternant: length and animacy. Both properties are\ndirectly present in datives but also reflect more global tendencies for shorter\nelements to precede longer ones and animates to precede inanimates. First, by\nmanipulating and ablating datives for these biases in the input, we show that\ndirect evidence of length and animacy matters, but easy-first preferences\npersist even without such evidence. Then, using LMs trained on systematically\nperturbed datasets to manipulate global length effects (re-linearizing\nsentences globally while preserving dependency structure), we find that dative\npreferences can emerge from indirect evidence.

However, current benchmarks conflate perceptual and reasoning\ntasks, making it difficult to assess whether MLLMs genuinely understand\nmathematical diagrams beyond superficial pattern recognition. To address this\ngap, we introduce MATHGLANCE, a benchmark specifically designed to isolate and\nevaluate mathematical perception in MLLMs. MATHGLANCE comprises 1.2K images and\n1.6K carefully curated questions spanning four perception tasks: shape\nclassification, object counting, relationship identification, and object\ngrounding, covering diverse domains including plane geometry, solid geometry,\nand graphical representations. Our evaluation of MLLMs reveals that their\nability to understand diagrams is notably limited, particularly in fine-grained\ngrounding tasks. In response, we construct GeoPeP, a perception-oriented\ndataset of 200K structured geometry image-text pairs explicitly annotated with\ngeometric primitives and precise spatial relationships. Training MLLM on GeoPeP\nleads to significant gains in perceptual accuracy, which in turn substantially\nimproves mathematical reasoning.

    "abstract": "Change detection is a key task in Earth observation applications. Recently,\ndeep learning methods have demonstrated strong performance and widespread\napplication. However, change detection faces data scarcity due to the\nlabor-intensive process of accurately aligning remote sensing images of the\nsame area, which limits the performance of deep learning algorithms. To address\nthe data scarcity issue, we develop a fine-tuning strategy called the Semantic\nChange Network (SCN). We initially pre-train the model on single-temporal\nsupervised tasks to acquire prior knowledge of instance feature extraction. The\nmodel then employs a shared-weight Siamese architecture and extended Temporal\nFusion Module (TFM) to preserve this prior knowledge and is fine-tuned on\nchange detection tasks. The learned semantics for identifying all instances is\nchanged to focus on identifying only the changes. Meanwhile, we observe that\nthe locations of changes between the two images are spatially identical, a\nconcept we refer to as spatial consistency. We introduce this inductive bias\nthrough an attention map that is generated by large-kernel convolutions and\napplied to the features from both time points. This enhances the modeling of\nmulti-scale changes and helps capture underlying relationships in change\ndetection semantics. We develop a binary change detection model utilizing these\ntwo strategies. The model is validated against state-of-the-art methods on six\ndatasets, surpassing all benchmark methods and achieving F1 scores of 92.87%,\n86.43%, 68.95%, 97.62%, 84.58%, and 93.20% on the LEVIR-CD, LEVIR-CD+,\nS2Looking, CDD, SYSU-CD, and WHU-CD datasets, respectively.",

VQCs are used as a\ncentral component in many algorithms, for example, in quantum machine learning,\noptimization, and quantum chemistry. Several methods have been developed to\noptimize VQCs. In this work, we enhance the performance of the well-known\nRotosolve method, a gradient-free optimization algorithm specifically designed\nfor VQCs. We develop two hybrid algorithms that combine an improved version of\nRotosolve with the free quaternion selection (FQS) algorithm, which is the main\nfocus of this study. Through numerical simulations, we observe that these\nhybrid algorithms achieve higher accuracy and better average performance across\ndifferent ansatz circuit sizes and cost functions. For shallow variational\ncircuits, we identify a trade-off between the expressivity of the variational\nansatz and the speed of convergence to the optimum: a more expressive ansatz\nultimately reaches a closer approximation to the true minimum, but at the cost\nof requiring more circuit evaluations for convergence. By combining the less\nexpressive but fast-converging Rotosolve with the more expressive FQS, we\nconstruct hybrid algorithms that benefit from the rapid initial convergence of\nRotosolve while leveraging the superior expressivity of FQS.

We introduce MotionCutMix, an online\ndata augmentation technique that dynamically generates training triplets by\nblending body part motions based on input text. While MotionCutMix effectively\nexpands the training distribution, the compositional nature introduces\nincreased randomness and potential body part incoordination. To model such a\nrich distribution, we present MotionReFit, an auto-regressive diffusion model\nwith a motion coordinator. The auto-regressive architecture facilitates\nlearning by decomposing long sequences, while the motion coordinator mitigates\nthe artifacts of motion composition. Our method handles both spatial and\ntemporal motion edits directly from high-level human instructions, without\nrelying on additional specifications or Large Language Models. Through\nextensive experiments, we show that MotionReFit achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance in text-guided motion editing.",

However, manual disease delineation for ADC and TDV\nmeasurements is unfeasible in clinical practice, demanding automation. As a\nfirst step, we propose an algorithm to generate fast and reproducible\nprobability maps of the skeleton, adjacent internal organs (liver, spleen,\nurinary bladder, and kidneys), and spinal canal. Methods: We developed an\nautomated deep-learning pipeline based on a 3D patch-based Residual U-Net\narchitecture that localizes and delineates these anatomical structures on\nWB-DWI. The algorithm was trained using \"soft-labels\" (non-binary\nsegmentations) derived from a computationally intensive atlas-based approach.\nFor training and validation, we employed a multi-center WB-DWI dataset\ncomprising 532 scans from patients with Advanced Prostate Cancer (APC) or\nMultiple Myeloma (MM), with testing on 45 patients. Results: Our\nweakly-supervised deep learning model achieved an average dice\nscore/precision/recall of 0.66/0.6/0.73 for skeletal delineations,\n0.8/0.79/0.81 for internal organs, and 0.85/0.79/0.94 for spinal canal, with\nsurface distances consistently below 3 mm. Relative median ADC and\nlog-transformed volume differences between automated and manual expert-defined\nfull-body delineations were below 10% and 4%, respectively. The computational\ntime for generating probability maps was 12x faster than the atlas-based\nregistration algorithm (25 s vs. 5 min). An experienced radiologist rated the\nmodel's accuracy \"good\" or \"excellent\" on test datasets. Conclusion: Our model\noffers fast and reproducible probability maps for localizing and delineating\nbody regions on WB-DWI, enabling ADC and TDV quantification, potentially\nsupporting clinicians in disease staging and treatment response assessment.",

NGC 7023 is a reflection nebula\npowered by a Herbig Ae Be star HD 200775 and also identified as a hub in the\nhub-filament cloud, LDN 1172/1174. We detect submillimetre emission well\ntowards the northern (identified as C1) and the eastern region of the\nreflection nebula. We investigated the polarization structure and the magnetic\nfield (B-field) morphology, which is found to be curved and follows the clump\nmorphology. The comparison of the B-field morphology at the clump scales\n($\\sim$0.02 pc) with that of the envelope ($\\sim$0.5 pc) suggests that the\nfield lines are not preserved from envelope to clump scales, implying that an\nexternal factor may be responsible for disturbing the B-field structure. We\nestimated a magnetic field strength of 179$\\pm$50 $\\mu$G in the starless core,\n121$\\pm$34 $\\mu$G in the protostellar core with a class I source and 150$\\pm$42\n$\\mu$G in the protostellar core with a class II source using the $N_{2}H^{+}$\n(1-0) line observed with 13.7 m single dish radio telescope at Taeduk Radio\nAstronomy Observatory (TRAO). The stability analysis using these B-field\nstrengths gives magnetically sub-critical values, while the magnetic,\ngravitational, and outflow kinetic energies are roughly balanced.

By measuring the auto-correlations\nand the auto-response functions for small perturbations we calculate the\nfluctuation-dissipation ratios (FDR) for the different variants of different\nanisotropy levels of the FF connectome. Numerical evidence is presented that\nthe FDRs follow the level of anisotropy of these non-equilibrium systems in\nagreement with the expectations. We also compare these results with those on a\nsymmetric random graph of similar size. We provide a detailed network analysis\nof the FF connectome and calculate the level of hierarchy, also related to the\nanisotropy. Finally, we provide some partial results for the periodic forced\nKuramoto, the Shinomoto-Kuramoto model.",

Using a dynamic\ncontrol area model, this work defines a 2x2 game in which two BRPs can choose\nto perform smart balancing. We study the impact of time delay, ramp rates, and\npricing mechanisms on Nash equilibria and Experience-weighted Attraction (EWA)\nlearning.

    "abstract": "We present the first quantum mechanical study of hyperfine effects in the\nrotational cluster states of a symmetric triatomic molecule H$_2$S. Rotational\nclusters arise from spontaneous symmetry breaking induced by\nhigh-angular-momentum rotational motions in certain rigid molecules, resulting\nin dynamic enantiomorphism driven by kinetic distortion effects. Hyperfine\ninteractions in the cluster states lead to collision-free breaking of nuclear\nspin symmetry, with the magnitude of nuclear spin ortho-para mixing\nsignificantly exceeding that in other states with same or lower angular\nmomentum. The ortho-para mixing induces nuclear spin polarization in the\nlaboratory frame and gives rise to two sets of enantiomers, that have different\nenergies and oppositely oriented nuclear spin projections. Although hyperfine\ninteractions preserve parity, they lift the degeneracy of opposite-parity\ncluster states. This phenomenon, previously observed experimentally, is\nexplained as a result of tunneling between rotating enantiomers, facilitated by\nthe Pauli exclusion principle.",

Thus, building on our work on classical algorithms based\non DVM, we propose neural network (NN) architecture to realize wideband\nmulti-beam beamformers using structure-imposed weight matrices and submatrices.\nThe structure and sparsity of the weight matrices and submatrices are shown to\nreduce the space and computational complexities of the NN greatly. The proposed\nnetwork architecture has O(pLM logM) complexity compared to a conventional\nfully connected L-layers network with O(M2L) complexity, where M is the number\nof nodes in each layer of the network, p is the number of submatrices per\nlayer, and M >> p. We will show numerical simulations in the 24 GHz to 32 GHz\nrange to demonstrate the numerical feasibility of realizing wideband multi-beam\nbeamformers using the proposed neural architecture. We also show the complexity\nreduction of the proposed NN and compare that with fully connected NNs, to show\nthe efficiency of the proposed architecture without sacrificing accuracy. The\naccuracy of the proposed NN architecture was shown using the mean squared\nerror, which is based on an objective function of the weight matrices and\nbeamformed signals of antenna arrays, while also normalizing nodes.

In this work, we propose a\nGlobal-Local Collaborative Reason and Debate with PSL (GLRD) framework for the\n3D OVD task, considering both local object-level information and global\nscene-level information. Specifically, LLM is utilized to perform common sense\nreasoning based on object-level and scene-level information, where the\ndetection result is refined accordingly. To further boost the LLM's ability of\nprecise decisions, we also design a probabilistic soft logic solver (OV-PSL) to\nsearch for the optimal solution, and a debate scheme to confirm the class of\nconfusable objects.

    "abstract": "We introduce Vision as LoRA (VoRA), a novel paradigm for transforming an LLM\ninto an MLLM. Unlike prevalent MLLM architectures that rely on external vision\nmodules for vision encoding, VoRA internalizes visual capabilities by\nintegrating vision-specific LoRA layers directly into the LLM. This design\nallows the added parameters to be seamlessly merged into the LLM during\ninference, eliminating structural complexity and minimizing computational\noverhead. Moreover, inheriting the LLM's ability of handling flexible context,\nVoRA can process inputs at arbitrary resolutions.\n  To further strengthen VoRA's visual capabilities, we introduce a block-wise\ndistillation method that transfers visual priors from a pre-trained ViT into\nthe LoRA layers, effectively accelerating training by injecting visual\nknowledge. Additionally, we apply bi-directional attention masks to better\ncapture the context information of an image. We successfully demonstrate that\nwith additional pre-training data, VoRA can perform comparably with\nconventional encode-based MLLMs. All training data, codes, and model weights\nwill be released at https://github.com/Hon-Wong/VoRA.",

    "abstract": "N-ary relational facts represent semantic correlations among more than two\nentities. While recent studies have developed link prediction (LP) methods to\ninfer missing relations for knowledge graphs (KGs) containing n-ary relational\nfacts, they are generally limited to transductive settings. Fully inductive\nsettings, where predictions are made on previously unseen entities, remain a\nsignificant challenge. As existing methods are mainly entity embedding-based,\nthey struggle to capture entity-independent logical rules. To fill in this gap,\nwe propose an n-ary subgraph reasoning framework for fully inductive link\nprediction (ILP) on n-ary relational facts. This framework reasons over local\nsubgraphs and has a strong inductive inference ability to capture n-ary\npatterns. Specifically, we introduce a novel graph structure, the n-ary\nsemantic hypergraph, to facilitate subgraph extraction. Moreover, we develop a\nsubgraph aggregating network, NS-HART, to effectively mine complex semantic\ncorrelations within subgraphs. Theoretically, we provide a thorough analysis\nfrom the score function optimization perspective to shed light on NS-HART's\neffectiveness for n-ary ILP tasks. Empirically, we conduct extensive\nexperiments on a series of inductive benchmarks, including transfer reasoning\n(with and without entity features) and pairwise subgraph reasoning. The results\nhighlight the superiority of the n-ary subgraph reasoning framework and the\nexceptional inductive ability of NS-HART.

Such systems can be employed as\nHeisenberg picture quantum memories with an engineered ability to approximately\nretain initial conditions over a bounded time interval. We use the quantum\nmemory decoherence time defined previously in terms of a fidelity threshold on\na weighted mean-square deviation for a subset (or linear combinations) of\nnetwork variables from their initial values. This approach is applied to\nmaximizing a high-fidelity asymptotic approximation of the decoherence time\nover the direct energy coupling parameters of the network. The resulting\noptimality condition is a set of linear equations for blocks of a sparse matrix\nassociated with the edges of the direct energy coupling graph of the network.\nWe also discuss a setting where the quantum network has a subset of dynamic\nvariables which are affected by the external fields only indirectly, through a\ncomplementary ``shielding'' system. This holds under a rank condition on the\nnetwork-field coupling matrix and can be achieved through an appropriate\nfield-mediated coupling between the component oscillators.

    "abstract": "Recent policy proposals aim to improve the safety of general-purpose AI, but\nthere is little understanding of the efficacy of different regulatory\napproaches to AI safety. We present a strategic model that explores the\ninteractions between safety regulation, the general-purpose AI creators, and\ndomain specialists--those who adapt the technology for specific applications.\nOur analysis examines how different regulatory measures, targeting different\nparts of the AI development chain, affect the outcome of this game. In\nparticular, we assume AI technology is characterized by two key attributes:\nsafety and performance. The regulator first sets a minimum safety standard that\napplies to one or both players, with strict penalties for non-compliance. The\ngeneral-purpose creator then invests in the technology, establishing its\ninitial safety and performance levels. Next, domain specialists refine the AI\nfor their specific use cases, updating the safety and performance levels and\ntaking the product to market. The resulting revenue is then distributed between\nthe specialist and generalist through a revenue-sharing parameter. Our analysis\nreveals two key insights: First, weak safety regulation imposed predominantly\non domain specialists can backfire. While it might seem logical to regulate AI\nuse cases, our analysis shows that weak regulations targeting domain\nspecialists alone can unintentionally reduce safety. This effect persists\nacross a wide range of settings. Second, in sharp contrast to the previous\nfinding, we observe that stronger, well-placed regulation can in fact mutually\nbenefit all players subjected to it. When regulators impose appropriate safety\nstandards on both general-purpose AI creators and domain specialists, the\nregulation functions as a commitment device, leading to safety and performance\ngains, surpassing what is achieved under no regulation or regulating one player\nalone.",

It is known that under certain conditions, smart\nbalancing can deteriorate the frequency stability of the power system. This\npaper examines how the publication of different types of NRT data affects smart\nbalancing and the frequency stability. A Monte-Carlo simulation of a dynamic\nmulti-agent model is performed to analyse the effects of smart balancing with\ndifferent parameters for the agents and the environment, using historical time\nseries of the power imbalance of the German control block as a basis. It is\nfound that smart balancing can significantly reduce the amount and cost of\nfrequency restoration reserve activation, but leads to a general increase of\nthe frequency variability.

    "abstract": "These notes detail the basics of the theory of Grothendieck toposes from the\nviewpoint of coverages. Typically one defines a site as a (small) category\nequipped with a Grothendieck topology. However, it is often desirable to\ngenerate a Grothendieck topology from a smaller structure, such as a\nGrothendieck pretopology, but these require some pullbacks to exist in your\nunderlying category. There is an even more light-weight structure one can\ngenerate a Grothendieck topology from called a coverage. Coverages don't\nrequire any limits or colimits to exist in the underlying category.\n  We prove in detail several results about coverages, such as closing coverages\nunder refinement and composition, to be what we call a saturated coverage,\nwhich doesn't change its category of sheaves. We show that Grothendieck\ntopologies are in bijection with saturated coverages. We give an explicit\ndescription of the saturated coverage and the Grothendieck topology generated\nfrom a coverage.\n  We furthermore give a readable account of some of the most important parts of\nGrothendieck topos theory, with an emphasis placed on coverages. These include\nconstructing sheafification using the plus construction and also in ``one go,''\nthe equivalence between left exact localizations of presheaf toposes and\nsaturated coverages, morphisms of sites using the fully general notion of\ncovering flatness, points of a Grothendieck topos and Giraud's theorem.

A crucial challenge for early diagnosis is differentiating uncertain\ncases with similar visual characteristics and closely annotation scores. In\nclinical practice, radiologists rely on quantitative, hand-crafted Radiomic\nfeatures extracted from Computed Tomography (CT) images, while recent research\nhas primarily focused on deep learning solutions. More recently,\nVision-Language Models (VLMs), particularly Contrastive Language-Image\nPre-Training (CLIP)-based models, have gained attention for their ability to\nintegrate textual knowledge into lung cancer diagnosis. While CLIP-Lung models\nhave shown promising results, we identified the following potential\nlimitations: (a) dependence on radiologists' annotated attributes, which are\ninherently subjective and error-prone, (b) use of textual information only\nduring training, limiting direct applicability at inference, and (c)\nConvolutional-based vision encoder with randomly initialized weights, which\ndisregards prior knowledge. To address these limitations, we introduce\nAutoRad-Lung, which couples an autoregressively pre-trained VLM, with prompts\ngenerated from hand-crafted Radiomics. AutoRad-Lung uses the vision encoder of\nthe Large-Scale Autoregressive Image Model (AIMv2), pre-trained using a\nmulti-modal autoregressive objective. Given that lung tumors are typically\nsmall, irregularly shaped, and visually similar to healthy tissue, AutoRad-Lung\noffers significant advantages over its CLIP-based counterparts by capturing\npixel-level differences.

However, most\nexisting methods focus primarily on generating static 3D models, overlooking\nthe potentially dynamic nature of certain shapes, such as humanoids, animals,\nand insects. To address this gap, we focus on rigging, a fundamental task in\nanimation that establishes skeletal structures and skinning for 3D models. In\nthis paper, we introduce OmniRig, the first large-scale rigging dataset,\ncomprising 79,499 meshes with detailed skeleton and skinning information.\nUnlike traditional benchmarks that rely on predefined standard poses (e.g.,\nA-pose, T-pose), our dataset embraces diverse shape categories, styles, and\nposes. Leveraging this rich dataset, we propose ARMO, a novel rigging framework\nthat utilizes an autoregressive model to predict both joint positions and\nconnectivity relationships in a unified manner. By treating the skeletal\nstructure as a complete graph and discretizing it into tokens, we encode the\njoints using an auto-encoder to obtain a latent embedding and an autoregressive\nmodel to predict the tokens. A mesh-conditioned latent diffusion model is used\nto predict the latent embedding for conditional skeleton generation. Our method\naddresses the limitations of regression-based approaches, which often suffer\nfrom error accumulation and suboptimal connectivity estimation. Through\nextensive experiments on the OmniRig dataset, our approach achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance in skeleton prediction, demonstrating improved\ngeneralization across diverse object categories.

    "abstract": "Collecting real-world vehicle accident videos for autonomous driving research\nis challenging due to their rarity and complexity. While existing driving video\ngeneration methods may produce visually realistic videos, they often fail to\ndeliver physically realistic simulations because they lack the capability to\ngenerate accurate post-collision trajectories. In this paper, we introduce\nAccidentSim, a novel framework that generates physically realistic vehicle\ncollision videos by extracting and utilizing the physical clues and contextual\ninformation available in real-world vehicle accident reports. Specifically,\nAccidentSim leverages a reliable physical simulator to replicate post-collision\nvehicle trajectories from the physical and contextual information in the\naccident reports and to build a vehicle collision trajectory dataset. This\ndataset is then used to fine-tune a language model, enabling it to respond to\nuser prompts and predict physically consistent post-collision trajectories\nacross various driving scenarios based on user descriptions. Finally, we employ\nNeural Radiance Fields (NeRF) to render high-quality backgrounds, merging them\nwith the foreground vehicles that exhibit physically realistic trajectories to\ngenerate vehicle collision videos. Experimental results demonstrate that the\nvideos produced by AccidentSim excel in both visual and physical authenticity.",

    "abstract": "Foundation models for 3D shape generation have recently shown a remarkable\ncapacity to encode rich geometric priors across both global and local\ndimensions. However, leveraging these priors for downstream tasks can be\nchallenging as real-world data are often scarce or noisy, and traditional\nfine-tuning can lead to catastrophic forgetting. In this work, we treat the\nweight space of a large 3D shape-generative model as a data modality that can\nbe explored directly. We hypothesize that submanifolds within this\nhigh-dimensional weight space can modulate topological properties or\nfine-grained part features separately, demonstrating early-stage evidence via\ntwo experiments. First, we observe a sharp phase transition in global\nconnectivity when interpolating in conditioning space, suggesting that small\nchanges in weight space can drastically alter topology. Second, we show that\nlow-dimensional reparameterizations yield controlled local geometry changes\neven with very limited data. These results highlight the potential of weight\nspace learning to unlock new approaches for 3D shape generation and specialized\nfine-tuning.",

In the state-of-the-art, this shift is often characterized at\na broad scale (slide-level or dataset-level) but not patch-level, which limits\nour comprehension of the impact of localized tissue characteristics on the\naccuracy of the deep learning models. To address this challenge, we present a\ndomain shift analysis framework based on UWarp, a novel registration tool\ndesigned to accurately align histological slides scanned under varying\nconditions. UWarp employs a hierarchical registration approach, combining\nglobal affine transformations with fine-grained local corrections to achieve\nrobust tissue patch alignment. We evaluate UWarp using two private datasets,\nCypathLung and BosomShieldBreast, containing whole slide images scanned by\nmultiple devices. Our experiments demonstrate that UWarp outperforms existing\nopen-source registration methods, achieving a median target registration error\n(TRE) of less than 4 pixels (<1 micrometer at 40x magnification) while\nsignificantly reducing computational time. Additionally, we apply UWarp to\ncharacterize scanner-induced local domain shift in the predictions of\nBreast-NEOprAIdict, a deep learning model for breast cancer pathological\nresponse prediction.

States of these cell types, as well as their numbers, are known to be\nrobust to external perturbations; as conceptualized by Waddington's epigenetic\nlandscape where cells embed themselves in valleys corresponding to final cell\ntypes. How is such robustness achieved by developmental dynamics and evolution?\nTo address this question, we consider a model of cells with gene expression\ndynamics and epigenetic feedback, governed by a gene regulation network. By\nevolving the network to achieve more cell types, we identified three major\ndifferentiation processes exhibiting different properties regarding their\nvariance, attractors, stability, and robustness. The first of these, type A,\nexhibits chaos and long-lived oscillatory dynamics that slowly transition until\nreaching a steady state. The second, type B, follows a channeled annealing\nprocess where the epigenetic changes in combination with noise shift the cells\ntowards varying final cell states that increase the stability. Lastly, type C\nexhibits a quenching process where cell fate is quickly decided by falling into\npre-existing fixed points while cell trajectories are separated through\nperiodic attractors or saddle points. We find types A and B to correspond well\nwith Waddington's landscape while being robust. Finally, the dynamics of type B\ndemonstrate a differentiation process that uses a directed shifting of fixed\npoints, visualized through the dimensional reduction of gene-expression states.\nCorrespondence with the experimental data of gene expression variance through\ndifferentiation is also discussed.",

In this work, we present a\ncomprehensive empirical study on model merging for L2S reasoning, exploring\ndiverse methodologies, including task-vector-based, SVD-based, and\nactivation-informed merging. Our experiments reveal that model merging can\nreduce average response length by up to 55% while preserving or even improving\nbaseline performance. We also identify a strong correlation between model scale\nand merging efficacy with extensive evaluations on 1.5B/7B/14B/32B models.\nFurthermore, we investigate the merged model's ability to self-critique and\nself-correct, as well as its adaptive response length based on task complexity.\nOur findings highlight model merging as a highly efficient and effective\nparadigm for L2S reasoning, offering a practical solution to the overthinking\nproblem while maintaining the robustness of System 2 reasoning.

    "abstract": "We consider two minimal mathematical models for cancer dynamics and\nself-adaptation. We aim to capture the interplay between the rapid progression\nof cancer growth and the possibility to leverage and enhance self-adaptive\ndefense mechanisms of an organism, e.g., motivated by immunotherapy. Yet, our\ntwo models are more abstract and generic encapsulating the essence of\ncompetition between rapid cancer growth and the speed of adaptation. First, we\npropose a four-dimensional ordinary differential equation model on a\nmacroscopic level. The model has three main parameter regimes and its most\nimportant features can be studied analytically. At small external stimulation\nof adaptation, cancer progresses to a deadly level. At intermediate external\ninput, a bifurcation is observed leaving behind only a locally stable\ncancer-free steady state. Unfortunately, in a large parameter regime after the\nbifurcation, a transient cancer density spike is observed. Only for a\ncombination of external input and speeding up adaptation, cancer does not reach\ncritical levels. To study the adaptation speed-up in the initial dynamics\nphase, we switch to a microscopic probabilistic model, which we study\nnumerically. The microscopic model undergoes a sharp transition under variation\nof the self-adaptation probability. It is shown that a combination of temporal\nmemory and rare stochastic positive adaptation events is crucial to move the\nsharp transition point to a desired regime. Despite their extreme simplicity,\nthe two models already provide remarkably deep insight into the challenges one\nhas to overcome to leverage/enhance the self-adaptation of an organism in\nfighting cancer.",

This lack of direct identifiers requires\nthe use of Record Linkage (RL) algorithms, which rely on partially identifying\nvariables to probabilistically determine whether records belong to the same\nentity. Since these variables lack the strength to perfectly combine\ninformation, RL procedures typically yield an imperfect set of linked records.\nTherefore, assessing the false discovery rate (FDR) of RL is crucial for\nensuring the reliability of subsequent analyses. In this paper, we introduce a\nnovel method for estimating the FDR in RL by linking records from real and\nsynthesised data. As synthetic records should never form links with real\nobservations, they provide a means to estimate the FDR across different\nprocedural settings. Notably, this method is applicable to all RL techniques.\nBy identifying the FDR in RL results and selecting suitable model parameters,\nour approach enables to assess and improve the reliability of linked data. We\nevaluate the performance of our procedure using established RL algorithms and\nbenchmark data sets before applying it to link siblings from the Netherlands\nPerinatal Registry, where the reliability of previous RL applications has never\nbeen confirmed.

The tilt of the potential breaks the spatial\ninversion symmetry allowing us to exploit the population of the energetically\nelevated well as a probe of induced interactions. For two impurities, the\ninteraction with the medium reduces the impurity population at the\nenergetically elevated well, which we interpret as evidence of induced\nimpurity-impurity attraction.

To alleviate the above challenges,\nparameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques (PEFT), such as prompt tuning, are\nemployed to adapt the PT-VLM to the diverse incrementally learned tasks.

Our main result offers a purely polyhedral characterization of\nthis semifield: we show that a tropical function is in the image of the\ntropicalization map if and only if it takes the same slope near infinity along\nparallel half-lines of the skeleton. This extends a result of Baker and\nRabinoff in dimension one to arbitrary dimensions. We use this characterization\nto establish that this semifield is finitely generated over the semifield of\ntropical rational numbers, providing a new proof of a recent result by Ducros,\nHrushovski, Loeser and Ye in the discrete valued field case. As a second\napplication, we present a new proof of the faithful tropicalization theorem by\nGubler, Rabinoff and Werner in the discrete valuation field case. The proof is\nconstructive and provides explicit coordinate functions for the embedding of\nthe skeleton, extending the existing results in dimension one to arbitrary\ndimensions.",

In our framework,\nmeasurements therefore play the role of acts with an uncertain outcome and our\nsimple decision-theoretic postulates ensure that Born's rule is encapsulated in\nthe utility functions associated with such acts. This approach allows us to\nuncouple (precise) probability theory from quantum mechanics, in the sense that\nit leaves room for a more general, so-called imprecise probabilities approach.\nWe discuss the mathematical implications of our findings, which allow us to\ngive a decision-theoretic foundation to recent seminal work by Benavoli,\nFacchini and Zaffalon, and we compare our approach to earlier and different\napproaches by Deutsch and Wallace.",

    "abstract": "The problem of the formation of exoplanets in inclined orbits relative to the\nequatorial plane of the parent star or the main plane of the protoplanetary\ndisk can be solved by introducing a smaller inclined disk. However, the\nquestion of the nature of such an internal disk remains open. In the paper, we\nsuccessfully tested the hypothesis about the formation of an inclined inner\ndisk in a protoplanetary disk near a T Tau type star as a result of a gas\nstream falling on it. To test the hypothesis, three-dimensional gas-dynamic\ncalculations were performed taking into account viscosity and thermal\nconductivity using the PLUTO package. In the course of the analysis of\ncalculations, it was shown that a single intersection of the matter stream with\nthe plane of the disk cannot ensure the formation of an inclined disk near the\nstar, while a double intersection can. In addition, in the case of a retrograde\nfall of matter, the angle of inclination of the resulting inner disk is\nsignificantly greater. An analysis of the observational manifestations of this\nevent was also carried out: the potential change in the brightness of the star,\nthe distribution of optical thickness in angles, the evolution of the accretion\nrate. It is shown that the decrease in brightness can reach up to $5^m$, taking\ninto account scattered light, and such a decrease in brightness will last\nseveral decades. In addition, a sharp increase in the accretion rate by two\norders of magnitude could potentially trigger an FU Ori-like outburst.",

Analysis of the light\ncurves using the Lomb-Scargle periodogram shows an increase in the spin period\nof SXP 138 from 140.69 to 140.85 seconds, indicating that the source is in the\npropeller regime. We calculate the associated rate of spin period change and\ncharacterize its non-linearity with a quadratic fit. Pulse profiles obtained by\nfolding the light curves at the spin period show two primary high peaks and two\nsecondary peaks for all the observations. Such features in the pulse profile\ncan result from the combined effect of pencil and fan beam emissions from the\ntwo antipodal hotspots accompanied by the relativistic bending of photons. The\nenergy spectra fit with both the blackbody and the power-law spectral model.\nThe best-fit models of all observations show an overall increasing trend in the\ntemperature of the source from 1.8 keV to 2.5 keV, during the first three\nobservations, and a possible decreasing trend in the photon index from 1.8 to\n1.7. The power-law component is dominant in the later observations, which is\nassociated with an increase in Compton scattering and the accretion rate. SXP\n138 has not been studied in detail, and this work bridges the gap by providing\nthe first comprehensive timing and spectral analysis of this source.

In this study, we applied a categorical Pavlovian disgust\nconditioning paradigm with two CS categories (animals and tools) and disgusting\nimages as US (e.g., feces). During categorization, acquisition, and extinction\nphases, we measured eye movements and pupil responses in 44 participants.\nConsistent with previous results, subjective disgust and US expectancy\nincreased from categorization to acquisition for CS+, along with greater pupil\ndilation for CS+ than CS-. Higher disgust sensitivity was associated with more\ngeneralized and longer lasting disgust experiences, as well as higher\nexpectancy for disgusting images. Pupil response during acquisition and\nextinction depended on disgust sensitivity: Participants with lower disgust\nsensitivity showed greater pupil dilation. These findings suggest that\nindividuals with high disgust sensitivity and prolonged expectancy may exhibit\nphysiological differences from less sensitive individuals as early as the\nacquisition phase. This could inform contamination-based OCD treatments by\nintegrating interventions which focus on attentional deployment or\nphysiological reactions.

First, we aim at enhancing the\nunderstanding of the invariants. We provide an explicit representation of the\nset of invariants that are admissible, i.e. for which (I1, I2) a deformation\nstate does indeed exist. Furthermore, we prove that uniaxial and equi-biaxial\ndeformation correspond to the boundary of the set of admissible invariants.\nSecond, we study how the experimentally-observed behaviour of different\nmaterials can be captured by means of neural network models of incompressible\nhyperelasticity, depending on whether both I1 and I2 or solely one of the\ninvariants, i.e. either only I1 or only I2, are taken into account. To this\nend, we investigate three different experimental data sets from the literature.\nIn particular, we demonstrate that considering only one invariant, either I1 or\nI2, can allow for good agreement with experiments in case of small\ndeformations. In contrast, it is necessary to consider both invariants for\nprecise models at large strains, for instance when rubbery polymers are\ndeformed. Moreover, we show that multiaxial experiments are strictly required\nfor the parameterisation of models considering I2. Otherwise, if only data from\nuniaxial deformation is available, significantly overly stiff responses could\nbe predicted for general deformation states. On the contrary, I1-only models\ncan make qualitatively correct predictions for multiaxial loadings even if\nparameterised only from uniaxial data, whereas I2-only models are completely\nincapable in even qualitatively capturing experimental stress data at large\ndeformations.",

Depending on the\nequation of state, the SNs could be stable and even be one of the candidates\nfor dark matter. In order to detect SNs which hitting the Earth or the Moon at\na non-relativistic velocity, a new messenger, the acoustic array, is analysed.\nThe results of the calculations show that the impact signal of an SN can be\ndetected at a distance of about 30 kilometers from the nugget's trajectory. By\nusing microphone boxes, hydrophones or seismographs to construct an array in\nthe bedrock, ocean or on the Moon, it is possible to reconstruct the velocity,\nmass, and interacting cross section of SNs, and then constrain also the nature\nof supra-nuclear matter. The acoustic array can also be used for distributed\nacoustic sensing of meteorites or earthquakes.

Existing tools such as NASA-TLX and DALI are still used to\nassess driving workload in automated vehicles, despite not accounting for new\ntasks. This study introduces AV-TLX, a specialized tool for measuring workload\nin Level 3 automated driving. The development process began with a narrative\nliterature review to identify the primary factors influencing workload. This\nwas followed by a series of qualitative sessions during which the dimensions\nand later the questions of the questionnaire were designed. The tools validity\nwas first assessed using CVR and CVI indices, and its reliability and\nconvergent validity were evaluated using a dynamic driving simulator with high\nfidelity. The final version of AV-TLX comprises 19 questions across 8\nsubscales, demonstrating excellent reliability (0.86) and validity (CVR >\n0.78). An agreement scores between the results of AV-TLX and NASA-TLX in the\nsimulation study was 0.6, which is considered acceptable for the consistency of\ntwo questionnaires. Furthermore, this questionnaire can be utilized in two\nways. First by reporting the overall workload and/or divided into 8 primary\nsubscales, or by categorizing the questions into two groups including takeover\ntask workload and automated driving task workload.

We present two methods to create counterfactual\nexplanations for image regression tasks using diffusion-based generative models\nto address challenges in sparsity and quality: 1) one based on a Denoising\nDiffusion Probabilistic Model that operates directly in pixel-space and 2)\nanother based on a Diffusion Autoencoder operating in latent space. Both\nproduce realistic, semantic, and smooth counterfactuals on CelebA-HQ and a\nsynthetic data set, providing easily interpretable insights into the\ndecision-making process of the regression model and reveal spurious\ncorrelations. We find that for regression counterfactuals, changes in features\ndepend on the region of the predicted value.

These issues become evident when organizations seek to leverage data\nscience, posing significant challenges to the implementation of analytical\nprojects.\n  This paper, grounded in real-world applications, defines the concept of\nartificial unicity and proposes RED2Hunt (RElational Databases REDundancy\nHunting), a human-in-the-loop framework for identifying hidden redundancy and,\nif problems occur, cleaning relational databases implemented with surrogate\nkeys.

Quite interestingly, those\nprofiles can be computed very efficiently in quasi-linear time.

Notebook software like Jupyter and\nGoogle Colab provides a user-friendly, interactive, web-based programming\ninterface and is widely used across science and engineering domains.

To guarantee high interactivity, modern notebook platforms\ntypically reserve GPU resources within actively running notebook sessions.\nThese notebook sessions are long-running but exhibit intermittent and sporadic\nGPU usage. Consequently, during most of their lifetimes, notebook sessions do\nnot use the reserved GPUs, resulting in extremely low GPU utilization and\nprohibitively high cost.\n  In this paper, we introduce NotebookOS, a GPU-efficient notebook platform\ndesigned to meet the unique requirements of IDLT. NotebookOS uses a replicated\nnotebook kernel design, where each kernel consists of three replicas\ndistributed across separate GPU servers and synchronized via Raft. To optimize\nGPU utilization, NotebookOS oversubscribes server resources via kernel\nreplication to leverage the relatively high task inter-arrival times in IDLT\nworkloads. By dynamically allocating GPUs to kernel replicas only while they\nare actively executing notebook cells, NotebookOS maximizes the likelihood of\nimmediate and interactive training upon notebook notebook-cell task submission.\nNotebookOS also migrates kernel replicas and automatically scales the GPU\ncluster under overload conditions. We evaluate NotebookOS extensively using\nproduction notebook workloads.

Here, we report both design and\nprocedural strategies to address this issue. First, we show that by reducing\nthe nanorod diameter from 360 nm to 260 nm, the EF minima can be avoided for\nany nanorod length, mitigating the impact of fabrication errors. In addition,\nwe explore the influence of incident wave polarization and orientation on the\nEF.

Furthermore, MagEs is integrated with the DetEQ model\nfor earthquake detection within the SAIPy package, creating a comprehensive\npipeline for earthquake detection and magnitude estimation using HR-GNSS data.\nThe MagEs model provides magnitude estimates within seconds of detection when\nusing stations within 3 degrees of the epicenter, which are the most relevant\nfor real-time applications. However, since it has been trained on data from\nstations up to 7.5 degrees away, it can also analyze data from larger\ndistances. The model can process data from a single station at a time or\ncombine data from up to three stations. The model was trained using synthetic\ndata reflecting rupture scenarios in the Chile subduction zone, and the results\nconfirm strong performance for Chilean earthquakes. Although tests from other\ntectonic regions also yielded good results, incorporating regional data through\ntransfer learning could further improve its performance in diverse seismic\nsettings.

    "abstract": "Emotion recognition is crucial for advancing mental health, healthcare, and\ntechnologies like brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). However, EEG-based emotion\nrecognition models face challenges in cross-domain applications due to the high\ncost of labeled data and variations in EEG signals from individual differences\nand recording conditions. Unsupervised domain adaptation methods typically\nrequire access to source domain data, which may not always be feasible in\nreal-world scenarios due to privacy and computational constraints. Source-free\nunsupervised domain adaptation (SF-UDA) has recently emerged as a solution,\nenabling target domain adaptation without source data, but its application in\nemotion recognition remains unexplored. We propose a novel SF-UDA approach for\nEEG-based emotion classification across domains, introducing a multi-stage\nframework that enhances model adaptability without requiring source data. Our\napproach incorporates Dual-Loss Adaptive Regularization (DLAR) to minimize\nprediction discrepancies on confident samples and align predictions with\nexpected pseudo-labels. Additionally, we introduce Localized Consistency\nLearning (LCL), which enforces local consistency by promoting similar\npredictions from reliable neighbors. These techniques together address domain\nshift and reduce the impact of noisy pseudo-labels, a key challenge in\ntraditional SF-UDA models. Experiments on two widely used datasets, DEAP and\nSEED, demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Our approach significantly\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving 65.84% accuracy when trained on\nDEAP and tested on SEED, and 58.99% accuracy in the reverse scenario.

Meanwhile, developers commonly\nreuse existing regexes from Internet sources and codebases. In this study, we\nask a simple question: are regex composition tasks unique enough to merit\ndedicated machinery, or is reuse all we need?\n  We answer this question through a systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art\nregex reuse and synthesis strategies. We begin by collecting a novel dataset of\nregex composition tasks mined from GitHub and RegExLib (55,137 unique tasks\nwith solution regexes). To address the absence of an automated regex reuse\nformulation, we introduce reuse-by-example, a Programming by Example (PbE)\napproach that leverages a curated database of production-ready regexes.\nAlthough all approaches can solve these composition tasks accurately,\nreuse-by-example and LLMs both do far better over the range of metrics we\napplied. Our evaluation then uses multiple dimensions, including a novel\nmetric, to compare reuse-by-example against two synthesis approaches: formal\nregex synthesizers and generative AI (LLMs). Although all approaches can solve\nthese composition tasks accurately, reuse and LLMs both do far better over the\nrange of metrics we applied.

    "abstract": "Context: Orbiting matter misaligned with a spinning black hole undergoes\nLense-Thirring precession, due to the frame-dragging effect. This phenomenon is\nparticularly relevant for type-C QPOs observed in the hard states of low-mass\nX-ray binaries. However, the accretion flow in these hard states is complex,\nconsisting of a geometrically thick, hot corona surrounded by a geometrically\nthin, cold disk. Recent simulations have demonstrated that, in such a truncated\ndisk scenario, the precession of the inner hot corona slows due to its\ninteraction with the outer cold disk. Aims: This paper aims to provide an\nanalytical description of the precession of an inner (hot) torus in the\npresence of accretion torques exerted by the outer (cold) disk. Methods. Using\nthe angular momentum conservation equation, we investigate the evolution of the\ntorus angular momentum vector for various models of accretion torque. Results:\nWe find that, in general, an accretion torque tilts the axis of precession away\nfrom the black hole spin axis. In all models, if the accretion torque is\nsufficiently strong, it can halt the precession; any perturbation from this\nstalled state will cause the torus to precess around an axis that is misaligned\nwith the black hole spin axis. Conclusions: The accretion torque exerted by the\nouter thin disk can cause precession around an axis that is neither aligned\nwith the black hole spin axis nor perpendicular to the plane of the disk. This\nfinding may have significant observational implications, as the jet direction,\nif aligned with the angular momentum axis of the torus, may no longer reliably\nindicate the black hole spin axis or the orientation of the outer accretion\ndisk.",

These\neffects are well-documented among traditional brain segmentation tools but have\nnot been studied extensively in tools based on deep-learning segmentations,\nwhich promise to be more robust. In this paper, we explore the potential of\ndeep learning to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of cortical thickness\nmeasurement in the presence of WM lesions, using a high-quality lesion filling\nalgorithm leveraging denoising diffusion networks.\n  A pseudo-3D U-Net architecture trained on the OASIS dataset to generate\nsynthetic healthy tissue, conditioned on binary lesion masks derived from the\nMSSEG dataset, allows realistic removal of white matter lesions in multiple\nsclerosis patients. By applying morphometry methods to patient images before\nand after lesion filling, we analysed robustness of global and regional\ncortical thickness measurements in the presence of white matter lesions.\nMethods based on a deep learning-based segmentation of the brain (Fastsurfer,\nDL+DiReCT, ANTsPyNet) exhibited greater robustness than those using classical\nsegmentation methods (Freesurfer, ANTs).",

In MRI in\nparticular, voxel dimension, slice spacing and acquisition plane can vary\nsubstantially. For clinical applications, therefore, algorithms must be trained\nto handle data with various voxel resolutions. The usual strategy to deal with\nheterogeneity of resolution is harmonization: resampling imaging data to a\ncommon (usually isovoxel) resolution. This can lead to loss of fidelity arising\nfrom interpolation artifacts out-of-plane and downsampling in-plane. We present\nin this paper a network architecture designed to be able to learn directly from\nspatially heterogeneous data, without resampling: a segmentation network based\non the e3nn framework that leverages a spherical harmonic, rather than\nvoxel-grid, parameterization of convolutional kernels, with a fixed physical\nradius. Networks based on these kernels can be resampled to their input voxel\ndimensions. We trained and tested our network on a publicly available dataset\nassembled from three centres, and on an in-house dataset of Multiple Sclerosis\ncases with a high degree of spatial inhomogeneity. We compared our approach to\na standard U-Net with two strategies for handling inhomogeneous data: training\ndirectly on the data without resampling, and resampling to a common resolution\nof 1mm isovoxels. We show that our network is able to learn from various\ncombinations of voxel sizes and outperforms classical U-Nets on 2D testing\ncases and most 3D testing cases.

Guided by the success of\nvarious low energy theorems, we assume that the explicit breaking of these\nsymmetries occurs only via the current quark masses, and all other symmetry\nbreakings are of dynamical nature. In order to take into account the effects of\nthe finite quark core sizes of the baryons on the equation of state, we make\nuse of an excluded volume framework which respects thermodynamic consistency.\nThe effects generated by the swelling quark cores generally act repulsively and\nlead to an increase of the pressure with increasing baryon density.

Beyond their role as static predictors, LLMs\nincreasingly function as intelligent agents, capable of reasoning,\ndecision-making, and adapting dynamically to complex environments. However, the\ntheoretical underpinnings of prompt engineering remain largely unexplored. In\nthis paper, we introduce a formal framework demonstrating that transformer\nmodels, when provided with carefully designed prompts, can act as a\nconfigurable computational system by emulating a ``virtual'' neural network\nduring inference. Specifically, input prompts effectively translate into the\ncorresponding network configuration, enabling LLMs to adjust their internal\ncomputations dynamically. Building on this construction, we establish an\napproximation theory for $\\beta$-times differentiable functions, proving that\ntransformers can approximate such functions with arbitrary precision when\nguided by appropriately structured prompts. Moreover, our framework provides\ntheoretical justification for several empirically successful prompt engineering\ntechniques, including the use of longer, structured prompts, filtering\nirrelevant information, enhancing prompt token diversity, and leveraging\nmulti-agent interactions. By framing LLMs as adaptable agents rather than\nstatic models, our findings underscore their potential for autonomous reasoning\nand problem-solving, paving the way for more robust and theoretically grounded\nadvancements in prompt engineering and AI agent design.",

    "abstract": "There remains debate over whether the accretion disk survives or is entirely\ndisrupted after the nova eruption. In our previous paper, Muraoka et al. (2024,\nPASJ, 76, 293) have photometrically demonstrated that the surviving accretion\ndisk was expanded close to the L1 point during the optical plateau stage and\nthen drastically shrank to the tidal truncation radius after the optical\nplateau stage ended. To approach the clarification of the physical mechanism\nthat drives these structural changes, we have then conducted systematic\nanalyses of the spectral evolution of the narrow emission line components in\noptical over 22 d following the optical peak during the 2022 nova eruption of U\nScorpii (U Sco). Additionally, we present its optical spectrum in quiescence\n794 d after the 2022 nova eruption. We find that the single-peaked narrow\ncomponents of H$\\alpha$ and He II 4686 appeared almost simultaneously between\nroughly days 6 and 8, preceding the onset of the disk eclipses observed after\nday 11. This finding suggests that the nova wind near the binary system may be\nthe primary origin of these narrow components and even remained active several\ndays after the nova eruption with a velocity of approximately 1000 km s$^{-1}$,\nlikely driving the expansion of the accretion disk until the end of the optical\nplateau stage. While the contribution of the rotating accretion disk might be\ndominated by that of the nova wind in the H$\\alpha$ line profile, the outward\nsurface flow from the expanded disk might also contribute to these narrow\nfeatures during the optical plateau stage, making the single-peaked narrow line\nprofiles more pronounced.",

The first, iGreedy, uses latency\nmeasurements from geographically dispersed locations to map anycast\ndeployments. The second, MAnycast2, uses anycast to perform a census of other\nanycast networks. MAnycast2's advantage is speed, performing an Internet-wide\ncensus in 3 hours, but it suffers from problems with accuracy and precision.\nInversely, iGreedy is highly accurate but much slower.

Our simulations\nshow that an $FA$ whose beat pattern has non-zero mean curvature sustains\nballistic motion for several hundred beats before transitioning to a\ndiffusion-dominated regime via rotational diffusion.

    "abstract": "In large language model (LLM) serving systems, executing each request\nconsists of two phases: the compute-intensive prefill phase and the\nmemory-intensive decoding phase. To prevent performance interference between\nthe two phases, current LLM serving systems typically adopt prefill-decoding\ndisaggregation, where the two phases are split across separate machines.\nHowever, we observe this approach leads to significant resource\nunderutilization. Specifically, prefill instances that are compute-intensive\nsuffer from low memory utilization, while decoding instances that are\nmemory-intensive experience low compute utilization. To address this problem,\nthis paper proposes Adrenaline, an attention disaggregation and offloading\nmechanism designed to enhance resource utilization and performance in LLM\nserving systems. Adrenaline's key innovation lies in disaggregating part of the\nattention computation in the decoding phase and offloading them to prefill\ninstances. The memory-bound nature of decoding-phase attention computation\ninherently enables an effective offloading strategy, yielding two complementary\nadvantages: 1) improved memory capacity and bandwidth utilization in prefill\ninstances, and 2) increased decoding batch sizes that enhance compute\nutilization in decoding instances, collectively boosting overall system\nperformance. Adrenaline achieves these gains through three key techniques:\nlow-latency decoding synchronization, resource-efficient prefill colocation,\nand load-aware offloading scheduling. Experimental results show that Adrenaline\nachieves 2.28x higher memory capacity and 2.07x better memory bandwidth\nutilization in prefill instances, up to 1.67x improvements in compute\nutilization for decoding instances, and 1.68x higher overall inference\nthroughput compared to state-of-the-art systems.",

In both types of data the intensities of most of the emission\nlines were measured and abundances of oxygen and N, Ne, S, Ar, Cl and Fe were\ndetermined as well as physical parameters of the \\ion{H}{ii} region. The\nchemical abundances were obtained from both types of data with the Te-method.\nAbundances calculated from both types of data agree to within the cited\nuncertainties. The analysis of the echelle data revealed three distinct\nkinematic subsystems within the studied \\ion{H}{ii} region: a narrow component\n(NC, $\\sigma ~ 12$~km/s), a broad component (BC, $\\sigma ~ 40$~km/s), and a\nvery broad component (VBC, $\\sigma ~ 60-110$~km/s, detected only in the\nbrightest emission lines). The velocity dispersion dependence on the ionisation\npotential of elements showed no correlation for the NC, indicating a well-mixed\nturbulent medium, while the BC exhibited pronounced stratification,\ncharacteristic of an expanding shell. Based on a detailed analysis of the\nkinematics and chemical composition, it was concluded that the BC is associated\nwith the region surrounding a Wolf-Rayet star of spectral type WN7-8. The\nstellar wind from this WR star interacts with a shell ejected during an earlier\nevolutionary stage (either as a red supergiant or a luminous blue variable,\nLBV), which is enriched in nitrogen.

In settings without selection bias or\nconfounding, $E[Y|do(X)] = E[Y|X]$, which can be estimated using standard\nregression methods. However, regression fails when systematic missingness\ninduced by selection bias, or confounding distorts the data. Boeken et al.\n[2023] show that when training data is subject to selection, proxy variables\nunaffected by this process can, under certain constraints, be used to correct\nfor selection bias to estimate $E[Y|X]$, and hence $E[Y|do(X)]$, reliably. When\ndata is additionally affected by confounding, however, this equality is no\nlonger valid.\n  Building on these results, we consider a more general setting and propose a\nframework that incorporates both selection bias and confounding. Specifically,\nwe derive theoretical conditions ensuring identifiability and recoverability of\ncausal effects under access to external data and proxy variables.

To\naddress these problems, we propose a novel Truncated Diffusion model for\nefficient Blind Face Restoration (TD-BFR), a three-stage paradigm tailored for\nthe progressive resolution of degraded images. Specifically, TD-BFR utilizes an\ninnovative truncated sampling method, starting from low-quality (LQ) images at\nlow resolution to enhance sampling speed, and then introduces an adaptive\ndegradation removal module to handle unknown degradations and connect the\ngeneration processes across different resolutions. Additionally, we further\nadapt the priors of pre-trained diffusion models to recover rich facial\ndetails. Our method efficiently restores high-quality images in a\ncoarse-to-fine manner and experimental results demonstrate that TD-BFR is, on\naverage, \\textbf{4.75$\\times$} faster than current state-of-the-art\ndiffusion-based BFR methods while maintaining competitive quality.",

This lies outside conventional textbook physics predictions, yet\nits existence has been indicated previously and if eventually confirmed will\nhave a significant effect on physics theory and many technological\napplications, especially those involving high current density (> 10^9 A/m2).\nThe experiment described here is based on the measurement of force on a copper\narmature submerged in a trough containing liquid metal through which constant\nDC current is passing. The coaxial symmetry of the experiment (CRE Coaxial\nRecoil Experiment) was able to limit all net force on the centred armature to\nthe direction of interest, parallel to the current within it. All the\nexperimental data related the measured forces on the armature to the current\nflowing through the circuit. Variations were made to the length and location of\nthe armature along the central axis as well as modifications to the liquid\nmetal configuration. Raw and processed results are presented, and an\nexperimental technique described that revealed strong evidence for the\nexistence of and discrimination between axial mechanical contact forces and\nlongitudinal EM force.

We\nemployed a Markovian framework to study the Hepsilon multilevel source\nfunction, used relative contribution functions to identify its formation\nregions, and correlated the properties of synthetic spectra with atmospheric\nparameters. Results. Ellerman bombs are predominantly optically thick in\nHepsilon, appearing as well-defined structures. UV bursts and small flares are\npartially optically thin and give rise to diffuse structures. The Hepsilon line\nserves as a good velocity diagnostic for small-scale heating events in the\nlower chromosphere.

This study proposes a methodology to\nanalyze route between maritime points of interest and extract geo-referenced\nstandard routes, as maritime patterns of life, from raw AIS data. The\nunderlying assumption is that ships adhere to consistent patterns when\ntravelling in certain maritime areas due to geographical, environmental, or\neconomic factors. Deviations from these patterns may be attributed to weather\nconditions, seasonality, or illicit activities. This enables maritime\nsurveillance authorities to analyze the navigational behavior between ports,\nproviding insights on vessel route patterns, possibly categorized by vessel\ncharacteristics (type, flag, or size). Our methodological process begins by\nsegmenting AIS data into distinct routes using a finite state machine (FSM),\nwhich describes routes as seg-ments connecting pairs of points of interest. The\nextracted segments are ag-gregated based on their departure and destination\nports and then modelled using iterative density-based clustering to connect\nthese ports. The cluster-ing parameters are assigned manually to sample and\nthen extended to the en-tire dataset using linear regression. Overall, the\napproach proposed in this paper is unsupervised and does not require any ground\ntruth to be trained. The approach has been tested on data on the on a six-year\nAIS dataset cover-ing the Arctic region and the Europe, Middle East, North\nAfrica areas. The total size of our dataset is 1.15 Tbytes. The approach has\nproved effective in extracting standard routes, with less than 5% outliers,\nmostly due to routes with either their departure or their destination port not\nincluded in the test areas.",

Marine debris can devastate habitats and endanger marine life\nthrough entanglement, while harmful algal blooms can produce toxins that\nnegatively affect marine ecosystems.

These\nmarine anomalies can be identified by applying trained deep learning (DL)\nmodels on multispectral satellite imagery.

    "abstract": "Most, if not all, robot navigation systems employ a decomposed planning\nframework that includes global and local planning. To trade-off onboard\ncomputation and plan quality, current systems have to limit all robot dynamics\nconsiderations only within the local planner, while leveraging an extremely\nsimplified robot representation (e.g., a point-mass holonomic model without\ndynamics) in the global level. However, such an artificial decomposition based\non either full or zero consideration of robot dynamics can lead to gaps between\nthe two levels, e.g., a global path based on a holonomic point-mass model may\nnot be realizable by a non-holonomic robot, especially in highly constrained\nobstacle environments. Motivated by such a limitation, we propose a novel\nparadigm, Decremental Dynamics Planning that integrates dynamic constraints\ninto the entire planning process, with a focus on high-fidelity dynamics\nmodeling at the beginning and a gradual fidelity reduction as the planning\nprogresses. To validate the effectiveness of this paradigm, we augment three\ndifferent planners with DDP and show overall improved planning performance. We\nalso develop a new DDP-based navigation system, which achieves first place in\nthe simulation phase of the 2025 BARN Challenge. Both simulated and physical\nexperiments validate DDP's hypothesized benefits.",

    "abstract": "Hybrid storage systems (HSS) integrate multiple storage devices with diverse\ncharacteristics to deliver high performance and capacity at low cost. The\nperformance of an HSS highly depends on the effectiveness of two key policies:\n(1) the data-placement policy, which determines the best-fit storage device for\nincoming data, and (2) the data-migration policy, which dynamically rearranges\nstored data (i.e., prefetches hot data and evicts cold data) across the devices\nto sustain high HSS performance. Prior works optimize either data placement or\ndata migration in isolation, which leads to suboptimal HSS performance.\nUnfortunately, no prior work tries to optimize both policies together.\n  Our goal is to design a holistic data-management technique that optimizes\nboth data-placement and data-migration policies to fully exploit the potential\nof an HSS, and thus significantly improve system performance. We propose\nHarmonia, a multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL)-based data-management\ntechnique that employs two lightweight autonomous RL agents, a data-placement\nagent and a data-migration agent, that adapt their policies for the current\nworkload and HSS configuration while coordinating with each other to improve\noverall HSS performance.\n  We evaluate Harmonia on real HSS configurations with up to four heterogeneous\nstorage devices and seventeen data-intensive workloads. On\nperformance-optimized (cost-optimized) HSS with two storage devices, Harmonia\noutperforms the best-performing prior approach by 49.5% (31.7%) on average. On\nan HSS with three (four) devices, Harmonia outperforms the best-performing\nprior work by 37.0% (42.0%) on average. Harmonia's performance benefits come\nwith low latency (240ns for inference) and storage overheads (206 KiB in DRAM\nfor both RL agents combined). We will open-source Harmonia's implementation to\naid future research on HSS.",

    "abstract": "We present 3D radiation hydrodynamics simulations of common-envelope (CE)\nevolution involving a 12 solar mass red supergiant donor and a 3 solar mass\ncompanion. Existing 3D simulations are predominantly adiabatic, focusing\nstrongly on low-mass donors on the red giant and asymptotic giant branches.\nHowever, the adiabatic assumption breaks down once the perturbed CE material\nbecomes optically thin or when entering a longer-timescale evolutionary phase\nafter the dynamical plunge-in. This is especially important for high-mass red\nsupergiant donors, which have short thermal timescales, adding significant\nuncertainty to our understanding of how massive binary stars evolve into\ngravitational-wave sources, X-ray binaries, stripped-envelope supernovae, and\nmore. We compare our radiation hydrodynamics simulations with an adiabatic\nsimulation from Paper I that is otherwise identical, finding that radiative\ndiffusion strongly inhibits CE ejection. The fraction of ejected mass is\nroughly half that of the adiabatic case without accounting for recombination\nenergy release. Almost no material is ejected during the dynamical plunge-in,\nand longer-timescale ejection during the slow spiral-in is suppressed. However,\nthe orbital separation reached at the end of the dynamical plunge-in does not\ndiffer significantly. The large amount of remaining bound mass tentatively\nsupports the emerging view that the dynamical plunge-in is followed by a\nnon-adiabatic phase, during which a substantial fraction of the envelope is\nejected and the binary orbit may continue to evolve.",

Yet, they remain prone to\nhallucinations-incorrect responses that contradict input images, posing\nsubstantial risks in clinical decision-making. Detecting these hallucinations\nis essential for establishing trust in MLLMs among clinicians and patients,\nthereby enabling their real-world adoption. Current hallucination detection\nmethods, especially semantic entropy (SE), have demonstrated promising\nhallucination detection capacity for LLMs. However, adapting SE to medical\nMLLMs by incorporating visual perturbations presents a dilemma. Weak\nperturbations preserve image content and ensure clinical validity, but may be\noverlooked by medical MLLMs, which tend to over rely on language priors. In\ncontrast, strong perturbations can distort essential diagnostic features,\ncompromising clinical interpretation. To address this issue, we propose Vision\nAmplified Semantic Entropy (VASE), which incorporates weak image\ntransformations and amplifies the impact of visual input, to improve\nhallucination detection in medical VQA. We first estimate the semantic\npredictive distribution under weak visual transformations to preserve clinical\nvalidity, and then amplify visual influence by contrasting this distribution\nwith that derived from a distorted image. The entropy of the resulting\ndistribution is estimated as VASE. Experiments on two medical open-ended VQA\ndatasets demonstrate that VASE consistently outperforms existing hallucination\ndetection methods.",

The spectral changes are\nstrongest at the wave vector corresponding to the 3D CDW order despite the fact\nthat the CDW is absent in our experimental conditions. Our findings challenge\nconventional phonon self-energy renormalization models and instead support a\nscenario in which low-energy phonons hybridize with dispersive\ncharge-density-wave excitations.

To address this, we introduce MLLM-Selector, an automated approach\nthat identifies valuable data for VIT by weighing necessity and diversity.

Empirical results indicate that within\nidentical experimental conditions, MLLM-Selector surpasses LLaVA-1.5 in some\nbenchmarks with less than 1% of the data and consistently exceeds performance\nacross all validated benchmarks when using less than 50%.",

In text-to-semantic decoding, a semantic-aware\nspeech tokenizer converts the speech signal into semantic tokens, which can be\nsynthesized from the text via a language model in an auto-regressive manner.\nMeanwhile, the semantic-to-acoustic decoding module simultaneously translates\ngenerated semantic tokens into the speech signal in a streaming way.

Specifically, flow-matching decoding can\ngenerate speech by chunks, presenting a lower RTF of 0.1 but a higher latency\nof 300ms. Instead, the multi-stream language model generates speech by frames\nin an autoregressive manner, presenting a higher RTF of 0.3 but a low latency\nof 150ms.

This has led to complex engines with a surge in the number\nof corresponding tunable parameters in actuator set points and control\nsettings. Automated calibration is therefore essential to keep development time\nand costs at acceptable levels. In this work, an innovative self-learning\ncalibration method is presented based on in-cylinder pressure curve shaping.\nThis method combines Principal Component Decomposition with constrained\nBayesian Optimization. To realize maximal thermal engine efficiency, the\noptimization problem aims at minimizing the difference between the actual\nin-cylinder pressure curve and an Idealized Thermodynamic Cycle. By\ncontinuously updating a Gaussian Process Regression model of the pressure's\nPrincipal Components weights using measurements of the actual operating\nconditions, the mean in-cylinder pressure curve as well as its uncertainty\nbounds are learned. This information drives the optimization of calibration\nparameters, which are automatically adapted while dealing with the risks and\nuncertainties associated with operational safety and combustion stability. This\ndata-driven method does not require prior knowledge of the system. The proposed\nmethod is successfully demonstrated in simulation using a Reactivity Controlled\nCompression Ignition engine model. The difference between the Gross Indicated\nEfficiency of the optimal solution found and the true optimum is 0.017%. For\nthis complex engine, the optimal solution was found after 64.4s, which is\nrelatively fast compared to conventional calibration methods.",

    "abstract": "Video generation models have achieved remarkable progress in text-to-video\ntasks. These models are typically trained on text-video pairs with highly\ndetailed and carefully crafted descriptions, while real-world user inputs\nduring inference are often concise, vague, or poorly structured. This gap makes\nprompt optimization crucial for generating high-quality videos. Current methods\noften rely on large language models (LLMs) to refine prompts through in-context\nlearning, but suffer from several limitations: they may distort user intent,\nomit critical details, or introduce safety risks. Moreover, they optimize\nprompts without considering the impact on the final video quality, which can\nlead to suboptimal results. To address these issues, we introduce VPO, a\nprincipled framework that optimizes prompts based on three core principles:\nharmlessness, accuracy, and helpfulness. The generated prompts faithfully\npreserve user intents and, more importantly, enhance the safety and quality of\ngenerated videos. To achieve this, VPO employs a two-stage optimization\napproach. First, we construct and refine a supervised fine-tuning (SFT) dataset\nbased on principles of safety and alignment. Second, we introduce both\ntext-level and video-level feedback to further optimize the SFT model with\npreference learning. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that VPO\nsignificantly improves safety, alignment, and video quality compared to\nbaseline methods. Moreover, VPO shows strong generalization across video\ngeneration models. Furthermore, we demonstrate that VPO could outperform and be\ncombined with RLHF methods on video generation models, underscoring the\neffectiveness of VPO in aligning video generation models.

This approach\nyields personalized clusters without needing to access the entire graph, which\nmakes it highly suitable for numerous applications involving large graphs.\nHowever, most existing solutions merely rely on the topological connectivity\nbetween nodes in $G$, rendering them vulnerable to missing or noisy links that\nare commonly present in real-world graphs.\n  To address this issue, this paper resorts to leveraging the complementary\nnature of graph topology and node attributes to enhance local clustering\nquality. To effectively exploit the attribute information, we first formulate\nthe LGC as an estimation of the bidirectional diffusion distribution (BDD),\nwhich is specialized for capturing the multi-hop affinity between nodes in the\npresence of attributes. Furthermore, we propose LACA, an efficient and\neffective approach for LGC that achieves superb empirical performance on\nmultiple real datasets while maintaining strong locality. The core components\nof LACA include (i) a fast and theoretically-grounded preprocessing technique\nfor node attributes, (ii) an adaptive algorithm for diffusing any vectors over\n$G$ with rigorous theoretical guarantees and expedited convergence, and (iii)\nan effective three-step scheme for BDD approximation. Extensive experiments,\ncomparing 17 competitors on 8 real datasets, show that LACA outperforms all\ncompetitors in terms of result quality measured against ground truth local\nclusters, while also being up to orders of magnitude faster.

In particular,\nit reveals how the issue logic works including the policy of the issue\nscheduler, the structure of the register file and its associated cache, and\nmultiple features of the memory pipeline. Moreover, it analyses how a simple\ninstruction prefetcher based on a stream buffer fits well with modern NVIDIA\nGPUs and is likely to be used. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of the\nregister file cache and the number of register file read ports on both\nsimulation accuracy and performance.\n  By modeling all these new discovered microarchitectural details, we achieve\n18.24% lower mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) in execution cycles than\nprevious state-of-the-art simulators, resulting in an average of 13.98% MAPE\nwith respect to real hardware (NVIDIA RTX A6000). Also, we demonstrate that\nthis new model stands for other NVIDIA architectures, such as Turing. Finally,\nwe show that the software-based dependence management mechanism included in\nmodern NVIDIA GPUs outperforms a hardware mechanism based on scoreboards in\nterms of performance and area.",

In the initial\nstate, the resting particles are placed in the positive half-line $x\\geqslant\n0$ at equal distances. Their masses alternate between two distinct values. The\ndynamics is initialized by giving the leftmost particle a positive velocity.\nDue to elastic inter-particle collisions, the whole system gradually comes into\nmotion, filling both right-hand and left-hand half-lines. As shown by\n[Chakraborti S., Dhar A., Krapivsky P., SciPost Phys., 2022, 13, 074], an\ninherent feature of such a billiard is the emergence of two different modes:\nthe shock wave that propagates in $x\\geqslant 0$ and the splash region in\n$x<0$. Moreover, the behaviour of the relevant observables is characterized by\nuniversal asymptotic power-law dependencies. In view of the finite size of the\nsystem and of finite observation times, these dependencies only start to\nacquire a universal character. To analyse them, we set up molecular dynamics\nsimulations using the concept of effective scaling exponents, familiar in the\ntheory of continuous phase transitions.

Specifically,\nwe devise a bin-wise sampling strategy that enables MLLMs to generate diverse\nanswers based on various combinations of keyframes, thereby enriching the\nvisual context. To determine the final prediction from the sampled answers, we\nemploy a self-reward by linearly combining three scores: (1) a frequency score\nindicating the prevalence of each option, (2) a marginal confidence score\nreflecting the inter-intra sample certainty of MLLM predictions, and (3) a\nreasoning score for different question types, including clue-guided answering\nfor global questions and temporal self-refocusing for local questions. The\nfrequency score ensures robustness through majority correctness, the\nconfidence-aligned score reflects prediction certainty, and the typed-reasoning\nscore addresses cases with sparse key visual information using tailored\nstrategies.

While climate change\ntrends dominate the skill of temperature predictions, the method presents\nadditional skill over the climatological forecast in regions influenced by\nknown teleconnections. We reach similar conclusions based on the validation of\nprecipitation predictions. Despite underperforming SEAS5 in most tropics, our\nmodel offers added value in numerous extratropical inland regions.

    "abstract": "We report on a recent breakthrough in rule-based graph programming, which\nallows us to reach the time complexity of imperative linear-time algorithms. In\ngeneral, achieving the complexity of graph algorithms in conventional languages\nusing graph transformation rules is challenging due to the cost of graph\nmatching. Previous work demonstrated that with rooted rules, certain algorithms\ncan be executed in linear time using the graph programming language GP 2.\nHowever, for non-destructive algorithms that retain the structure of input\ngraphs, achieving linear runtime required input graphs to be connected and of\nbounded node degree. In this paper, we overcome these preconditions by\nenhancing the graph data structure generated by the GP 2 compiler and\nexploiting the new structure in programs. We present three case studies, a\ncycle detection program, a program for numbering the connected components of a\ngraph, and a breadth-first search program. Each of these programs runs in\nlinear time on both connected and disconnected input graphs with arbitrary node\ndegrees. We give empirical evidence for the linear time complexity by using\ntimings for various classes of input graphs.",

This technique relies\non the splitting of the dynamics into a projected and an orthogonal part.\nHowever, the well-posedness of the abstract Cauchy problem for the orthogonal\ndynamics remains an open problem. Moreover, it is rarely discussed under which\nassumptions the Dyson identity, which is used to derive the GLE, holds. In this\narticle, we address this issue for rank-one projections (Mori's projection).\n  For the Mori projection, the orthogonal dynamics is obtained from the bounded\nperturbation theorem. The variation of constants formula for strongly\ncontinuous semigroups then yields the GLE and the second fluctuation\ndissipation theorem (2FDT). We show that the variation of constants can be\nreplaced by a limiting process in order to give a general proof of the GLE and\n2FDT that does not require the differentiability of the fluctuating forces.\n  In addition, we offer an alternative approach that does not require the\nbounded perturbation theorem. Our starting point is the observation that the\nGLE and 2FDT uniquely determine the fluctuating forces as well as the memory\nkernel. Furthermore, the orbit maps for the orthogonal dynamics can be directly\ndefined via solutions of linear Volterra equations. All desired properties of\nthe orthogonal dynamics are then proven directly from this definition. In\nparticular, the orthogonal dynamics is a strongly continuous semigroup\ngenerated by $\\overline{\\mathcal{QL}}\\mathcal{Q}$, where $\\mathcal{L}$ is the\ngenerator of the time evolution operator, and $\\mathcal{P}=1-\\mathcal{Q}$ is\nthe Mori projection operator.\n  Our results apply to general autonomous dynamical systems whose time\nevolution is given by a strongly continuous semigroup.",

    "abstract": "Recent research has revealed that high compression of Deep Neural Networks\n(DNNs), e.g., massive pruning of the weight matrix of a DNN, leads to a severe\ndrop in accuracy and susceptibility to adversarial attacks. Integration of\nnetwork pruning into an adversarial training framework has been proposed to\npromote adversarial robustness. It has been observed that a highly pruned\nweight matrix tends to be ill-conditioned, i.e., increasing the condition\nnumber of the weight matrix. This phenomenon aggravates the vulnerability of a\nDNN to input noise. Although a highly pruned weight matrix is considered to be\nable to lower the upper bound of the local Lipschitz constant to tolerate large\ndistortion, the ill-conditionedness of such a weight matrix results in a\nnon-robust DNN model. To overcome this challenge, this work develops novel\njoint constraints to adjust the weight distribution of networks, namely, the\nTransformed Sparse Constraint joint with Condition Number Constraint (TSCNC),\nwhich copes with smoothing distribution and differentiable constraint functions\nto reduce condition number and thus avoid the ill-conditionedness of weight\nmatrices. Furthermore, our theoretical analyses unveil the relevance between\nthe condition number and the local Lipschitz constant of the weight matrix,\nnamely, the sharply increasing condition number becomes the dominant factor\nthat restricts the robustness of over-sparsified models. Extensive experiments\nare conducted on several public datasets, and the results show that the\nproposed constraints significantly improve the robustness of a DNN with high\npruning rates.",

The total power\noutput is estimated between 140 and 260 TW, potentially the most intense ever\nrecorded, surpassing the brightest eruption at Surt in 2001 (~80 TW). Within\nthat region, only one hot spot was previously known (Pfd454). This feature was\nearlier estimated to cover an area of 300 square km with a total power output\nof 34 GW. JIRAM results show that the region produces a power output of 140-260\nTW, over 1,000 times higher than earlier estimates. Three adjacent hot spots\nalso exhibited dramatic power increases: P139, PV18, and an unnamed feature\nsouth of the main one that surged to ~1 TW, placing all of them among the top\n10 most powerful hot spots observed on Io. A temperature analysis of the\nfeatures supports a simultaneous onset of these brightenings and suggests a\nsingle eruptive event propagating beneath the surface across hundreds of\nkilometers, the first time this has been observed on Io. This implies a\nconnection among the hotspots' magma reservoirs, while other nearby hotspots\nthat have been known to be active in the recent past, such as Kurdalagon\nPatera, appear unaffected. The simultaneity supports models of massive,\ninterconnected magma reservoirs. The global scale of this event involving\nmultiple hotspots and covering several hundred thousand square km should be\nconsidered in the future models of the lithosphere and interior of Io.",

    "abstract": "Piecewise smooth systems are intensively studied today in many application\nareas, such as economics, finance, engineering, biology, and ecology. In this\nwork, we consider a class of one-dimensional piecewise linear discontinuous\nmaps with a finite number of partitions and functions sharing the same real\nfixed point. We show that the dynamics of this class of maps can be analyzed\nusing the well-known piecewise linear circle map and prove that their bounded\nbehavior, unrelated to the fixed point, may consist of either nonhyperbolic\ncycles or quasiperiodic orbits densely filling certain segments, with possible\ncoexistence. A corresponding model describing the price dynamics of a financial\nmarket serves as an illustrative example. While simulated model dynamics may be\nmistaken for chaotic behavior, our results demonstrate that they are\nquasiperiodic.",

We\nfocus on the very general format of $\\{\\cup, \\times\\}$-circuits -- also known\nas d-representations or DNNF circuits -- and aim to find the limits of this\napproach.\n  In prior work, it has been shown that there always exists a $\\{\\cup,\n\\times\\}$-circuits-circuit of size $N^{O(subw)}$ representing the query result,\nwhere N is the size of the database and subw the submodular width of the query.\nIf the arity of all relations is bounded by a constant, then subw is linear in\nthe treewidth tw of the query. In this setting, the authors of this paper\nproved a lower bound of $N^{\\Omega(tw^{\\varepsilon})}$ on the circuit size\n(ICALP 2023), where $\\varepsilon>0$ depends on the excluded grid theorem.\n  Our first main contribution is to improve this lower bound to\n$N^{\\Omega(tw)}$, which is tight up to a constant factor in the exponent. Our\nsecond contribution is a $N^{\\Omega(subw^{1/4})}$ lower bound on the circuit\nsize for join queries over relations of unbounded arity. Both lower bounds are\nunconditional lower bounds on the circuit size for well-chosen database\ninstances. Their proofs use a combination of structural (hyper)graph theory\nwith communication complexity in a simple yet novel way. While the second lower\nbound is asymptotically equivalent to Marx's conditional bound on the decision\ncomplexity (JACM 2013), our $N^{\\Theta(tw)}$ bound in the bounded-arity setting\nis tight, while the best conditional bound on the decision complexity is\n$N^{\\Omega(tw/\\log tw)}$.

This research area presents a complex\nchallenge in computer vision because of the rapid and intricate movements\ninherent in sign languages, which encompass hand gestures, body postures, and\neven facial expressions. Recently, skeleton-based action recognition has\nattracted increasing attention due to its ability to handle variations in\nsubjects and backgrounds independently. However, current skeleton-based SLR\nmethods exhibit three limitations: 1) they often neglect the importance of\nrealistic hand poses, where most studies train SLR models on non-realistic\nskeletal representations; 2) they tend to assume complete data availability in\nboth training or inference phases, and capture intricate relationships among\ndifferent body parts collectively; 3) these methods treat all sign glosses\nuniformly, failing to account for differences in complexity levels regarding\nskeletal representations. To enhance the realism of hand skeletal\nrepresentations, we present a kinematic hand pose rectification method for\nenforcing constraints. Mitigating the impact of missing data, we propose a\nfeature-isolated mechanism to focus on capturing local spatial-temporal\ncontext. This method captures the context concurrently and independently from\nindividual features, thus enhancing the robustness of the SLR model.\nAdditionally, to adapt to varying complexity levels of sign glosses, we develop\nan input-adaptive inference approach to optimise computational efficiency and\naccuracy.

In\nthis paper, we propose a Mixture of Rule Experts guided by a Large Language\nModel (MoRE-LLM) which combines a data-driven black-box model with knowledge\nextracted from an LLM to enable domain knowledge-aligned and transparent\npredictions. While the introduced Mixture of Rule Experts (MoRE) steers the\ndiscovery of local rule-based surrogates during training and their utilization\nfor the classification task, the LLM is responsible for enhancing the domain\nknowledge alignment of the rules by correcting and contextualizing them.\nImportantly, our method does not rely on access to the LLM during test time and\nensures interpretability while not being prone to LLM-based confabulations. We\nevaluate our method on several tabular data sets and compare its performance\nwith interpretable and non-interpretable baselines. Besides performance, we\nevaluate our grey-box method with respect to the utilization of interpretable\nrules. In addition to our quantitative evaluation, we shed light on how the LLM\ncan provide additional context to strengthen the comprehensibility and\ntrustworthiness of the model's reasoning process.",

While other foreground removal\ntechniques struggle with complex systematics, methods like foreground avoidance\nemerge as effective alternatives. However, this approach inevitably results in\nthe loss of Fourier modes and a reduction in cosmological constraints. We\npresent a novel method that, by enforcing the non-negativity of the observed\nfield in real space, allows us to recover some of the lost information,\nparticularly phase angles. We demonstrate that the effectiveness of this\nstraightforward yet powerful technique arises from the mode mixing from the\nnon-linear evolution of LSS. Since the non-negativity is ensured by mass\nconservation, one of the key principles of the cosmic dynamics, we can restore\nthe lost modes without explicitly expressing the exact form of the mode mixing.\nUnlike previous methods, our approach utilizes information from highly\nnon-linear scales, and has the potential to revolutionize the analysis of radio\nobservational data in cosmology. Crucially, we demonstrate that in\nlong-baseline interferometric observations, such as those from the Square\nKilometre Array (SKA), it is still possible to recover the baryonic acoustic\noscillation (BAO) signature despite not directly covering the relevant scales.\nThis opens up potential future survey designs for cosmological detection.",

    "abstract": "The role of kinetic electrons in the excitation and sustainment of ion-bulk\nelectrostatic waves in collisionless plasmas is investigated, with a focus on\nthe physical mechanisms responsible for the generation of small-scale\nstructures in space plasmas. Building on the work of F. Valentini et al., PRL,\n106, 165002 (2011), we numerically solve the Vlasov-Poisson system in one\nspatial and one velocity dimension for both ions and electrons. Our findings\nreveal that a significant fraction of the energy supplied by an external\ndriving electric field, used to trigger ion-bulk waves excitation, is\ntransferred to electrons, which become trapped within the wave potential well.\nAs a result, multiple phase-space vortices, generated during the early time\nevolution, undergo a merging process in the long-time limit, ultimately\nresulting in a single, coherent, and persistent phase-space hole in the\ndistributions of both species. Furthermore, the resonant interaction between\nelectrons and ion-bulk fluctuations induces a velocity-space diffusion process,\nleading to the development of a \"flat-top\" profile in the electron velocity\ndistribution, routinely observed in near Earth space. To establish\nobservational relevance, virtual spacecraft measurements were performed to\nevaluate the detectability of the velocity distribution features observed in\nthe simulations using modern spaceborne instruments. The results presented here\nare consistent with observations of electrostatic phenomena in space plasmas,\nand underscore the widespread occurrence of such structures across various\nplasma environments.",

At the beginning a\nbrief overview of the revious work in this project is provided. Afterwards the\nfocus shifts to a crucial problem in the fruit farming domain: the difficulty\nof making reliable yield predictions early in the season. Following three Satin\nsweet cherry trees along the year 2023 enabled the collection of accurate\nground truth data about the development of cherries from dormancy until\nharvest. The methodology used to collect this data is presented, along with its\nvaluation and visualization. The predictive power of counting objects at all\nrelevant vegetative stages of the fruit development cycle in cherry trees with\nregards to yield predictions is investigated. It is found that all investigated\nfruit states are suitable for yield predictions based on linear regression.\nConceptionally, there is a trade-off between earliness and external events with\nthe potential to invalidate the prediction. Considering this, two optimal\ntimepoints are suggested that are opening cluster stage before the start of the\nflowering and the early fruit stage right after the second fruit drop. However,\nboth timepoints are challenging to solve with automated procedures based on\nimage data. Counting developing cherries based on images is exceptionally\ndifficult due to the small fruit size and their tendency to be occluded by\nleaves. It was not possible to obtain satisfying results relying on a\nstate-of-the-art fruit-counting method. Counting the elements within a bursting\nbud is also challenging, even when using high resolution cameras.

The IVTON task involves seamlessly\nsuperimposing a garment from one image onto a person in another, creating a\nrealistic depiction of the person wearing the specified garment. Unlike\nconventional diffusion-based virtual try-on models that depend on large\npre-trained U-Net architectures, ITA-MDT leverages a lightweight, scalable\ntransformer-based denoising diffusion model with a mask latent modeling scheme,\nachieving competitive results while reducing computational overhead. A key\ncomponent of ITA-MDT is the Image-Timestep Adaptive Feature Aggregator (ITAFA),\na dynamic feature aggregator that combines all of the features from the image\nencoder into a unified feature of the same size, guided by diffusion timestep\nand garment image complexity. This enables adaptive weighting of features,\nallowing the model to emphasize either global information or fine-grained\ndetails based on the requirements of the denoising stage. Additionally, the\nSalient Region Extractor (SRE) module is presented to identify complex region\nof the garment to provide high-resolution local information to the denoising\nmodel as an additional condition alongside the global information of the full\ngarment image. This targeted conditioning strategy enhances detail preservation\nof fine details in highly salient garment regions, optimizing computational\nresources by avoiding unnecessarily processing entire garment image.\nComparative evaluations confirms that ITA-MDT improves efficiency while\nmaintaining strong performance, reaching state-of-the-art results in several\nmetrics.",

A\nnoise equivalent temperature (NET) as low as 0.5 uK/Hz^(1/2), at 1 Hz, is\nreported for 100 nm thick resonators at 4.2 K.

Unfortunately, real data do carry several\ninherent risks due to the many potential biases they exhibit when gathered\nwithout a proper random sampling over the reference population, and most of the\ntimes this is way too expensive or time consuming to be a viable option.\nDepending on how training data have been gathered, unmitigated biases can lead\nto harmful or discriminatory consequences that ultimately hinders large scale\napplicability of pre-trained models and undermine their truthfulness or\nfairness expectations. In this paper, a mixed active sampling and data\ngeneration strategy -- called samplation -- is proposed as a mean to compensate\nduring fine-tuning of a pre-trained classifer the unfair classifications it\nproduces, assuming that the training data come from a non-probabilistic\nsampling schema. Given a pre-trained classifier, first a fairness metric is\nevaluated on a test set, then new reservoirs of labeled data are generated and\nfinally a number of reversely-biased artificial samples are generated for the\nfine-tuning of the model.

    "abstract": "This position paper addresses the fallacies associated with the improper use\nof affordances in the opportunistic design of augmented reality (AR)\napplications. While opportunistic design leverages existing physical\naffordances for content placement and for creating tangible feedback in AR\nenvironments, their misuse can lead to confusion, errors, and poor user\nexperiences. The paper emphasizes the importance of perceptible affordances and\nproperly mapping virtual controls to appropriate physical features in AR\napplications by critically reflecting on four fallacies of facilitating\naffordances, namely, the subjectiveness of affordances, affordance imposition\nand reappropriation, properties and dynamicity of environments, and mimicking\nthe real world. By highlighting these potential pitfalls and proposing a\npossible path forward, we aim to raise awareness and encourage more deliberate\nand thoughtful use of affordances in the design of AR applications.",

This research\npresents a comprehensive comparative assessment of different forecasting\nmethods for MOSFET failure forecasting applications.

A\ncomprehensive comparison is performed assessing their MOSFET ageing forecasting\nability for different forecasting horizons. For short-term predictions, all\nalgorithms result in acceptable results, with the best results produced by\nclassical NN forecasting models at the expense of higher computations. For\nlong-term forecasting, only the TFT is able to produce valid outcomes owing to\nthe ability to integrate covariates from the expected future conditions.\nAdditionally, TFT attention points identify key ageing turning points, which\nindicate new failure modes or accelerated ageing phases.",

These applications benefit greatly from the use of cables for\nmanipulation mechanisms due to their lightweight, low-cost, and simple design.\nHowever, designing effective control and planning strategies for\ncable-suspended systems presents several challenges, including indirect load\nactuation, nonlinear configuration space, and highly coupled system dynamics.\nIn this paper, we introduce a novel event-triggered distributed Nonlinear Model\nPredictive Control (NMPC) method specifically designed for cooperative\ntransportation involving multiple quadrotors manipulating a cable-suspended\npayload. This approach addresses key challenges such as payload manipulation,\ninter-robot separation, obstacle avoidance, and trajectory tracking, all while\noptimizing the use of computational and communication resources. By integrating\nan event-triggered mechanism, our NMPC method reduces unnecessary computations\nand communication, enhancing energy efficiency and extending the operational\nrange of MAVs. The proposed method employs a lightweight state vector\nparametrization that focuses on payload states in all six degrees of freedom,\nenabling efficient planning of trajectories on the SE(3) manifold. This not\nonly reduces planning complexity but also ensures real-time computational\nfeasibility. Our approach is validated through extensive simulation,\ndemonstrating its efficacy in dynamic and resource-constrained environments.",

    "abstract": "As the Large-scale Language Models (LLMs) continue to scale, the requisite\ncomputational power and bandwidth escalate. To address this, we introduce\nUB-Mesh, a novel AI datacenter network architecture designed to enhance\nscalability, performance, cost-efficiency and availability. Unlike traditional\ndatacenters that provide symmetrical node-to-node bandwidth, UB-Mesh employs a\nhierarchically localized nD-FullMesh network topology. This design fully\nleverages the data locality of LLM training, prioritizing short-range, direct\ninterconnects to minimize data movement distance and reduce switch usage.\n  Although UB-Mesh's nD-FullMesh topology offers several theoretical\nadvantages, its concrete architecture design, physical implementation and\nnetworking system optimization present new challenges. For the actual\nconstruction of UB-Mesh, we first design the UB-Mesh-Pod architecture, which is\nbased on a 4D-FullMesh topology. UB-Mesh-Pod is implemented via a suite of\nhardware components that serve as the foundational building blocks, including\nspecifically-designed NPU, CPU, Low-Radix-Switch (LRS), High-Radix-Switch\n(HRS), NICs and others. These components are interconnected via a novel Unified\nBus (UB) technique, which enables flexible IO bandwidth allocation and hardware\nresource pooling. For networking system optimization, we propose advanced\nrouting mechanism named All-Path-Routing (APR) to efficiently manage data\ntraffic. These optimizations, combined with topology-aware performance\nenhancements and robust reliability measures like 64+1 backup design, result in\n2.04x higher cost-efficiency, 7.2% higher network availability compared to\ntraditional Clos architecture and 95%+ linearity in various LLM training tasks.",

Wave breaking and friction are critical drivers of wave\ndissipation over rough seabeds, especially in the surf zone. Phase-resolved\nwave models, often relying on classical bed shear stress or canopy drag\napproaches, can fail to capture these processes due to limitations in their\nphysical assumptions, especially for large roughness elements typical of rocky\nseabeds. The present study adapts the Bulk Canopy Drag (BCD) parameterization,\ninherited from vegetation and porous media studies, into the 3D non-hydrostatic\nphase-resolved SYMPHONIE model to simulate wave dissipation over rough seabeds.\nThe model was tested against laboratory experiments (LEGOLAS), using controlled\nirregular wave forcing propagating over a rough ramp. Results reveal that\nturbulent drag dominates the outer surf zone, while inertial drag plays a key\nrole in the inner surf zone. A combined optimization of these influences\nachieved strong agreement with experimental measurements under one irregular\nwave forcing and a specific bottom configuration. These findings underscore the\nimportance of accurately incorporating both turbulent and inertial\ncontributions into wave dissipation models for the rocky surf zone. The\nproposed BCD approach provides a promising framework for improving\nphase-resolved modeling of wave dynamics, with potential applications for more\ncomplex field conditions.

In this paper, we demonstrate that the connection between\nglobal and s-t variants behaves very differently across computational models:\n  1.In parallel and distributed models, we obtain almost tight reductions from\nglobal to s-t vertex connectivity.

    "abstract": "Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) provide standalone precise\nnavigation for a wide gamut of applications. Nevertheless, applications or\nsystems such as unmanned vehicles (aerial or ground vehicles and surface\nvessels) generally require a much higher level of accuracy than those provided\nby standalone receivers. The most effective and economical way of achieving\ncentimeter-level accuracy is to rely on corrections provided by fixed\n\\emph{reference station} receivers to improve the satellite ranging\nmeasurements. Differential GNSS (DGNSS) and Real Time Kinematics (RTK) provide\ncentimeter-level accuracy by distributing online correction streams to\nconnected nearby mobile receivers typically termed \\emph{rovers}. However, due\nto their static nature, reference stations are prime targets for GNSS attacks,\nboth simplistic jamming and advanced spoofing, with different levels of\nadversarial control and complexity. Jamming the reference station would deny\ncorrections and thus accuracy to the rovers. Spoofing the reference station\nwould force it to distribute misleading corrections. As a result, all connected\nrovers using those corrections will be equally influenced by the adversary\nindependently of their actual trajectory. We evaluate a battery of tests\ngenerated with an RF simulator to test the robustness of a common DGNSS/RTK\nprocessing library and receivers. We test both jamming and synchronized\nspoofing to demonstrate that adversarial action on the rover using reference\nspoofing is both effective and convenient from an adversarial perspective.\nAdditionally, we discuss possible strategies based on existing countermeasures\n(self-validation of the PNT solution and monitoring of own clock drift) that\nthe rover and the reference station can adopt to avoid using or distributing\nbogus corrections.",

When a magnetic field is\napplied along an orthorhombic in-plane axis at 4.2 K, magnetization increases\nabruptly around 34 T, followed by a hysteresis loop upon decreasing the field.\nSubsequent measurements reveal a significantly enhanced magnetization,\nindicative of a switch of the magnetization easy axis. Conversely, the other\northorhombic in-plane axis becomes the magnetization hard axis. Surprisingly,\nthe easy axis is switchable by changing the field direction to the other\northorhombic in-plane axis. Moreover, this memory effect is stable up to room\ntemperature. Polarized light microscope images have visually revealed domain\nformation of the as-cast samples and domain rearrangement by magnetic fields.\nThis intriguing axis-conversion phenomenon is a novel magnetic shape memory\neffect for heat cycles up to room temperature.

In this\nenergy regime the quantum mechanical properties of the system can be understood\nin terms of classical orbits by the application of semiclassical techniques. In\nfact the first theoretical explanation of the spectrum of the hydrogen atom\nwithin Bohr's atomic model was a semiclassical one using classical orbits and a\nquantization condition for the angular momentum. Contrary to the hydrogen atom,\nthe degeneracy of states with the same principal quantum number $n$ is lifted\nin exciton spectra. This is similar to the situation in alkali atoms, where\nthese splittings are caused by the interaction of the excited electron with the\nionic core. For excitons in cuprous oxide, these splittings occur due to the\ninfluence of the complex band structure of the crystal. Using an adiabatic\napproach and analytically derived energy surfaces, we develop a semiclassical\nspherical model and determine, via semiclassical torus quantization, the\nquantum defects of various angular momentum states.",

For the case\n$\\gamma\\in(\\frac{n}{2}+1,\\frac{n}{2}+2)$, we present a simple proof of reverse\nSobolev inequalities by using the center of mass condition introduced by Hang.\nIn addition, applying this approach, we establish the quantitative stability of\nreverse Sobolev inequalities of order $\\gamma\\in(\\frac{n}{2}+1,\\frac{n}{2}+2)$\nwith explicit lower bounds.

    "abstract": "Current diffusion-based super-resolution (SR) approaches achieve commendable\nperformance at the cost of high inference overhead. Therefore, distillation\ntechniques are utilized to accelerate the multi-step teacher model into\none-step student model. Nevertheless, these methods significantly raise\ntraining costs and constrain the performance of the student model by the\nteacher model. To overcome these tough challenges, we propose Consistency\nTrajectory Matching for Super-Resolution (CTMSR), a distillation-free strategy\nthat is able to generate photo-realistic SR results in one step. Concretely, we\nfirst formulate a Probability Flow Ordinary Differential Equation (PF-ODE)\ntrajectory to establish a deterministic mapping from low-resolution (LR) images\nwith noise to high-resolution (HR) images. Then we apply the Consistency\nTraining (CT) strategy to directly learn the mapping in one step, eliminating\nthe necessity of pre-trained diffusion model. To further enhance the\nperformance and better leverage the ground-truth during the training process,\nwe aim to align the distribution of SR results more closely with that of the\nnatural images. To this end, we propose to minimize the discrepancy between\ntheir respective PF-ODE trajectories from the LR image distribution by our\nmeticulously designed Distribution Trajectory Matching (DTM) loss, resulting in\nimproved realism of our recovered HR images. Comprehensive experimental results\ndemonstrate that the proposed methods can attain comparable or even superior\ncapabilities on both synthetic and real datasets while maintaining minimal\ninference latency.",

    "abstract": "Vision-language foundation models have shown impressive capabilities across\nvarious zero-shot tasks, including training-free localization and grounding,\nprimarily focusing on localizing objects in images. However, leveraging those\ncapabilities to localize actions and events in videos is challenging, as\nactions have less physical outline and are usually described by higher-level\nconcepts. In this work, we propose VideoGEM, the first training-free spatial\naction grounding method based on pretrained image- and video-language\nbackbones. Namely, we adapt the self-self attention formulation of GEM to\nspatial activity grounding. We observe that high-level semantic concepts, such\nas actions, usually emerge in the higher layers of the image- and\nvideo-language models. We, therefore, propose a layer weighting in the\nself-attention path to prioritize higher layers. Additionally, we introduce a\ndynamic weighting method to automatically tune layer weights to capture each\nlayer`s relevance to a specific prompt. Finally, we introduce a prompt\ndecomposition, processing action, verb, and object prompts separately,\nresulting in a better spatial localization of actions. We evaluate the proposed\napproach on three image- and video-language backbones, CLIP, OpenCLIP, and\nViCLIP, and on four video grounding datasets, V-HICO, DALY,\nYouCook-Interactions, and GroundingYouTube, showing that the proposed\ntraining-free approach is able to outperform current trained state-of-the-art\napproaches for spatial video grounding.",

Within the framework of the renormalization group approach, we\nconstruct the coupled flow equations of all interaction parameters and obtain\nseveral unique properties. On one hand, the interaction parameters flow toward\nseveral fixed points (FPs) at certain critical energy scales. We identify two\ndifferent types of FPs designated at the clean limit. FP-I is characterized by\nthe divergence of the quadratic parameter and exhibits robustness against\nvariations in interaction parameters. In contrast, FP-II is dominated by the\ncubic and quartic interaction parameters, and it is sensitive to initial\nconditions, leading to five subclasses. Besides, we find that disorder\nscattering can influence fermion velocities and critical energy scales, and\neven destabilize certain FPs around the $\\tau_{x,z}$-QCPs, driving the system\ntoward a preempted disorder-induced FP. On the other hand, we find that quantum\nfluctuations play a critical role in shaping the critical temperature ($T_c$)\nas the system approaches these QCPs. Near the $\\tau_x$-QCP, $T_c$ is\nconsiderably suppressed for both FP-I and FP-II. In contrast, near the\n$\\tau_0$-QCP, $T_c$ undergoes a substantial decrease for FP-I but only a slight\ndecrease for FP-II. Conversely, $T_c$ exhibits an increasing trend near the\n$\\tau_y$-QCP, with a pronounced peak at $v_{\\Delta 0}/v_{F0} \\sim 0.25$.\nHowever, numerical analysis suggests that the $\\tau_z$-QCP is unlikely to be\nphysically realizable. Additionally, we realize that $T_c$ can also be modified\nby the emergence of disorder-induced FPs in the vicinity of the $\\tau_x$-QCP.\nThese findings would provide valuable insights into the critical low-energy\nproperties of $d$-wave cuprate superconductors and related materials.",

It is well\nknown that for many PDEs there exists a multitude of measure-valued solutions\neven if admissibility criteria like an energy inequality are imposed. Hence in\nrecent years, people have tried to select the relevant solutions among all\nadmissible measure-valued solutions or at least to rule out some solutions\nwhich are not relevant.\n  In this paper another such criterion is studied. In particular, we aim to\nselect generalized Young measures which are ``maximally turbulent''. To this\nend, we look for maximizers of a certain functional, namely the variance, or\nmore precisely, the Jensen defect of the energy. We prove existence of such a\nmaximizer and we show that its mean value and total energy is uniquely\ndetermined. Our theory is carried out in a very general setting which may be\napplied in many situations where maximally turbulent measures shall be selected\namong a set of generalized Young measures.\n  Finally, we apply this general framework to the incompressible and the\nisentropic compressible Euler equation. Our criterion of maximal turbulence is\nplausible and leads to existence and uniqueness in a certain sense (in\nparticular, the mean value and the total energy of different maximally\nturbulent solutions coincide).",

Chaos, in either setting, can be characterized by statistical\nindependence between observables at $ t = 0 $ and $ t \\to \\infty $, leading to\nthe vanishing of cumulants involving these observables. In the quantum case,\nthe notion of independence is replaced by free independence, which only emerges\nin the thermodynamic limit (asymptotic freeness). In this work, we propose a\ndefinition of quantum chaos based on asymptotic freeness and investigate its\nemergence in quantum many-body systems including the mixed-field Ising model\nwith a random magnetic field, a higher spin version of the same model, and the\nSYK model. The hallmark of asymptotic freeness is the emergence of the free\nconvolution prediction for the spectrum of operators of the form $ A(0) + B(t)\n$, implying the vanishing of all free cumulants between $A(0)$ and $B(t)$ in\nthe thermodynamic limit for an infinite-temperature thermal state. We\nsystematically investigate the spectral properties of $ A(0) + B(t) $ in the\nabove-mentioned models, show that fluctuations on top of the free convolution\nprediction follow universal Wigner-Dyson statistics, and discuss the connection\nwith quantum chaos.

    "abstract": "Transformer-based methods have achieved remarkable results in image\nsuper-resolution tasks because they can capture non-local dependencies in\nlow-quality input images. However, this feature-intensive modeling approach is\ncomputationally expensive because it calculates the similarities between\nnumerous features that are irrelevant to the query features when obtaining\nattention weights. These unnecessary similarity calculations not only degrade\nthe reconstruction performance but also introduce significant computational\noverhead. How to accurately identify the features that are important to the\ncurrent query features and avoid similarity calculations between irrelevant\nfeatures remains an urgent problem. To address this issue, we propose a novel\nand effective Progressive Focused Transformer (PFT) that links all isolated\nattention maps in the network through Progressive Focused Attention (PFA) to\nfocus attention on the most important tokens. PFA not only enables the network\nto capture more critical similar features, but also significantly reduces the\ncomputational cost of the overall network by filtering out irrelevant features\nbefore calculating similarities.

To address this limitation, we\npropose bounded exhaustive random program generation, a novel method that\nfocuses the search space of program generation with the aim of more quickly\nidentifying bug-triggering programs.

To\nensure efficiency, we maintain a solvable constraint set during the template\ngeneration phase and then methodically explore all possible values of\nplaceholders within these constraints during the exhaustive enumeration phase.\nWe have implemented this approach for Solidity, a popular smart contract\nlanguage for the Ethereum blockchain, in a tool named Erwin. Based on a recent\nstudy of Solidity compiler bugs, the placeholders used by Erwin relate to\nlanguage features commonly associated with compiler bugs. Erwin has\nsuccessfully identified 23 previously unknown bugs across two Solidity\ncompilers, solc and solang, and one Solidity static analyzer, slither.\nEvaluation results demonstrate that Erwin outperforms state-of-the-art Solidity\nfuzzers in bug detection and complements developer-written test suites by\ncovering 4,582 edges and 14,737 lines of the solc compiler that were missed by\nsolc unit tests.",

Standard techniques to handle class imbalance include SMOTE,\nwhich generates synthetic samples from the minority class. However, SMOTE is\nintrinsically designed for continuous input variables. In fact, despite\nSMOTE-NC-its default extension to handle mixed features (continuous and\ncategorical variables)-very few works propose procedures to synthesize mixed\nfeatures. On the other hand, many real-world classification tasks, such as in\nbanking sector, deal with mixed features, which have a significant impact on\npredictive performances. To this purpose, we introduce MGS-GRF, an oversampling\nstrategy designed for mixed features. This method uses a kernel density\nestimator with locally estimated full-rank covariances to generate continuous\nfeatures, while categorical ones are drawn from the original samples through a\ngeneralized random forest. Empirically, contrary to SMOTE-NC, we show that\nMGS-GRF exhibits two important properties: (i) the coherence i.e. the ability\nto only generate combinations of categorical features that are already present\nin the original dataset and (ii) association, i.e. the ability to preserve the\ndependence between continuous and categorical features.

Here, we consider the effects of the long-range Coulomb\ninteraction between two electrons on the real time evolution of such\ndistributions in the experimentally relevant case of smooth guiding and quantum\npoint contact (QPC) potentials. Both Hanbury Brown and Twiss (HBT) and\nHong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) setups are investigated. The theoretical consideration\ntakes advantage of the separation of degrees of freedom leading to the\nindependent motion of the center of mass and the relative motion. The most\nprominent effect of this separation is the prediction of molecular bound\nstates, into which two electrons can become trapped and propagate as a pair\nalong the center of mass trajectory while simultaneously rotating around each\nother. The existence of a number of such molecular bound states should\nnaturally strongly affect the outgoing electrons' distribution in the HBT\nexperiment leading to bunching. But also in the HOM setup where colliding\nelectrons are initially spatially separated, we predict new effects due to the\nquantum tunneling of two electrons colliding at the QPC into the joint\nmolecular bound states. The lifetime of these quasi-bound states is shown to\ndepend on the symmetry of the orbital wave function of the two-electron state\ngiving rise to means to distinguish spin-triplets from spin-singlets (enabling\nthe creation of electronic Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) pairs).

    "abstract": "This paper addresses a generalization problem of Multi-Agent Pathfinding\n(MAPF), called Collaborative Task Sequencing - Multi-Agent Pathfinding\n(CTS-MAPF), where agents must plan collision-free paths and visit a series of\nintermediate task locations in a specific order before reaching their final\ndestinations. To address this problem, we propose a new approach, Collaborative\nTask Sequencing - Conflict-Based Search (CTS-CBS), which conducts a two-level\nsearch. In the high level, it generates a search forest, where each tree\ncorresponds to a joint task sequence derived from the jTSP solution. In the low\nlevel, CTS-CBS performs constrained single-agent path planning to generate\npaths for each agent while adhering to high-level constraints. We also provide\nheoretical guarantees of its completeness and optimality (or sub-optimality\nwith a bounded parameter). To evaluate the performance of CTS-CBS, we create\ntwo datasets, CTS-MAPF and MG-MAPF, and conduct comprehensive experiments. The\nresults show that CTS-CBS adaptations for MG-MAPF outperform baseline\nalgorithms in terms of success rate (up to 20 times larger) and runtime (up to\n100 times faster), with less than a 10% sacrifice in solution quality.\nFurthermore, CTS-CBS offers flexibility by allowing users to adjust the\nsub-optimality bound omega to balance between solution quality and efficiency.\nFinally, practical robot tests demonstrate the algorithm's applicability in\nreal-world scenarios.",

However, when post-FEC data is\nunavailable, it becomes necessary to rely on pre-FEC hard-decision data, which\ninevitably introduces hard-decision errors. These hard-decision errors will\nresult in a power offset that undermines the accuracy of absolute power\nmonitoring. In this paper, we present the first analytical expression for power\noffset in MMSE-PPE when using pre-FEC hard-decision data, achieved by\nintroducing a virtual hard-decision nonlinear perturbation term. Based on this\nanalytical expression, we also establish the first nonlinear relationship\nbetween the power offset and the symbol error rate (SER) of M-ary quadrature\namplitude modulation (M-QAM) formats based on Gaussian assumptions. Verified in\na numerical 130-GBaud single-wavelength coherent optical fiber transmission\nsystem, the correctness of the analytical expression of power offset has been\nconfirmed with 4-QAM, 16-QAM, and 64-QAM formats under different SER\nsituations. Furthermore, the nonlinear relationship between the power offset\nand SER of $M$-QAM formats has also been thoroughly validated under both linear\nscale (measured in mW) and logarithmic scale (measured in dB).

    "abstract": "Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive\nperformance in various vision-language (VL) tasks, but their expensive\ncomputations still limit the real-world application. To address this issue,\nrecent efforts aim to compress the visual features to save the computational\ncosts of MLLMs. However, direct visual compression methods, e.g. efficient\nprojectors, inevitably destroy the visual semantics in MLLM, especially in\ndifficult samples. To overcome this shortcoming, we propose a novel dynamic\npyramid network (DPN) for efficient MLLMs. Specifically, DPN formulates MLLM as\na hierarchical structure where visual features are gradually compressed with\nincreasing depth. In this case, even with a high compression ratio,\nfine-grained visual information can still be perceived in shallow layers. To\nmaximize the benefit of DPN, we further propose an innovative Dynamic Pooling\nExperts (DPE) that can dynamically choose the optimal visual compression rate\naccording to input features. With this design, harder samples will be assigned\nlarger computations, thus preserving the model performance. To validate our\napproach, we conduct extensive experiments on two popular MLLMs and ten\nbenchmarks. Experimental results show that DPN can save up to 56% average FLOPs\non LLaVA while further achieving +0.74% performance gains. Besides, the\ngeneralization ability of DPN is also validated on the existing high-resolution\nMLLM called LLaVA-HR. The source code will be released at\nhttps://github.com/aihao2000/DPN-LLaVA.",

The\ndetailed movements of an object may be represented by unstructured motion\nvectors or a set of motion primitives using a pre-defined articulation from a\ntemplate model. Just as a free-hand sketch can intuitively visualize scenes or\nintentions with a sparse set of lines, we utilize a set of parametric 3D curves\nto capture a set of spatially smooth motion elements for general objects with\nunknown structures. We first extract noisy, 3D point cloud motion guidance from\nvideo frames using semantic features, and our approach deforms a set of curves\nto abstract essential motion features as a set of explicit 3D representations.\nSuch abstraction enables an understanding of prominent components of motions\nwhile maintaining robustness to environmental factors.

    "abstract": "This report presents Wan, a comprehensive and open suite of video foundation\nmodels designed to push the boundaries of video generation. Built upon the\nmainstream diffusion transformer paradigm, Wan achieves significant\nadvancements in generative capabilities through a series of innovations,\nincluding our novel VAE, scalable pre-training strategies, large-scale data\ncuration, and automated evaluation metrics. These contributions collectively\nenhance the model's performance and versatility. Specifically, Wan is\ncharacterized by four key features: Leading Performance: The 14B model of Wan,\ntrained on a vast dataset comprising billions of images and videos,\ndemonstrates the scaling laws of video generation with respect to both data and\nmodel size. It consistently outperforms the existing open-source models as well\nas state-of-the-art commercial solutions across multiple internal and external\nbenchmarks, demonstrating a clear and significant performance superiority.\nComprehensiveness: Wan offers two capable models, i.e., 1.3B and 14B\nparameters, for efficiency and effectiveness respectively. It also covers\nmultiple downstream applications, including image-to-video, instruction-guided\nvideo editing, and personal video generation, encompassing up to eight tasks.\nConsumer-Grade Efficiency: The 1.3B model demonstrates exceptional resource\nefficiency, requiring only 8.19 GB VRAM, making it compatible with a wide range\nof consumer-grade GPUs. Openness: We open-source the entire series of Wan,\nincluding source code and all models, with the goal of fostering the growth of\nthe video generation community. This openness seeks to significantly expand the\ncreative possibilities of video production in the industry and provide academia\nwith high-quality video foundation models.

    "abstract": "Large deep learning models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in a\nwide range of tasks. These models often necessitate distributed systems for\nefficient training and inference. The fundamental building blocks for\ndistributed model execution are intra-layer parallel operators. The most\neffective approach to enhancing the performance of intra-layer parallel\noperators involves overlapping computation with communication. The overlapping\ncan be achieved through either operator decomposition or kernel fusion. While\ndecomposing operators is straightforward to implement, it often results in\nsuboptimal performance. On the other hand, fusing communication kernels with\ncompute kernels demands significant expertise and is error-prone.\n  In this paper, we propose TileLink to enable efficient compilation and\ngeneration of overlapped compute-communication kernels. TileLink is composed of\nfrontend and backend. In the frontend, TileLink decouples the design space of\ncommunication and computation, linking these two parts via tile-centric\nprimitives. In the backend, TileLink translates these primitives into low-level\ncommunication instructions, integrating the communication and computation\ncomponents to achieve overlapped execution. In experiments, TileLink achieves\nfrom $1.17\\times$ to $20.76\\times$ speedup to non-overlapping baseline and\nachieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art overlapping libraries on\nGPUs.",

However, observations\nwith Earth-based instruments are approaching fundamental limits on angular\nresolution. These can only be overcome by placing at least one interferometric\nelement in space. In this paper, several concepts of spaceborne VLBI systems\nare discussed, including TeraHertz Exploration and Zooming-in for Astrophysics\n(THEZA) and the Black Hole Explorer (BHEX). Spaceborne VLBI telescopes have\nsome of the most demanding requirements of any space science mission. The VLBI\nsystem as a whole includes globally distributed elements, each with their own\nfunctional constraints, limiting when observations can be performed. This\nnecessitates optimisation of the system parameters in order to maximise the\nscientific return of the mission.

A preliminary analysis of how these constraints can\nbe minimised through optimisation of the spacecraft configuration and operation\nis also provided. A space-based VLBI simulation tool (spacevlbi) has been\ndeveloped to model such missions and its capabilities are demonstrated\nthroughout the paper.

    "abstract": "Adversarial attacks in black-box settings are highly practical, with\ntransfer-based attacks being the most effective at generating adversarial\nexamples (AEs) that transfer from surrogate models to unseen target models.\nHowever, their performance significantly degrades when transferring across\nheterogeneous architectures -- such as CNNs, MLPs, and Vision Transformers\n(ViTs) -- due to fundamental architectural differences. To address this, we\npropose Feature Permutation Attack (FPA), a zero-FLOP, parameter-free method\nthat enhances adversarial transferability across diverse architectures. FPA\nintroduces a novel feature permutation (FP) operation, which rearranges pixel\nvalues in selected feature maps to simulate long-range dependencies,\neffectively making CNNs behave more like ViTs and MLPs. This enhances feature\ndiversity and improves transferability both across heterogeneous architectures\nand within homogeneous CNNs. Extensive evaluations on 14 state-of-the-art\narchitectures show that FPA achieves maximum absolute gains in attack success\nrates of 7.68% on CNNs, 14.57% on ViTs, and 14.48% on MLPs, outperforming\nexisting black-box attacks. Additionally, FPA is highly generalizable and can\nseamlessly integrate with other transfer-based attacks to further boost their\nperformance.

The luminosity of the corona is roughly consistent\nwith -- though higher than -- the expected from mm--X-ray correlations derived\nin recent studies of RQ AGN.

High angular resolution observations at\nfrequencies below 5 GHz are needed to constrain a putative optically thin\nsynchrotron component and the amount of free-free absorption.",

    "abstract": "Misgendering is the act of referring to someone by a gender that does not\nmatch their chosen identity. It marginalizes and undermines a person's sense of\nself, causing significant harm. English-based approaches have clear-cut\napproaches to avoiding misgendering, such as the use of the pronoun ``they''.\nHowever, other languages pose unique challenges due to both grammatical and\ncultural constructs. In this work we develop methodologies to assess and\nmitigate misgendering across 42 languages and dialects using a\nparticipatory-design approach to design effective and appropriate guardrails\nacross all languages. We test these guardrails in a standard LLM-based\napplication (meeting transcript summarization), where both the data generation\nand the annotation steps followed a human-in-the-loop approach. We find that\nthe proposed guardrails are very effective in reducing misgendering rates\nacross all languages in the summaries generated, and without incurring loss of\nquality. Our human-in-the-loop approach demonstrates a method to feasibly scale\ninclusive and responsible AI-based solutions across multiple languages and\ncultures. We release the guardrails and synthetic dataset encompassing 42\nlanguages, along with human and LLM-judge evaluations, to encourage further\nresearch on this subject.",

To address these limitations, we propose the Attribute-formed\nLanguage Bottleneck Model (ALBM). ALBM organizes concepts in the\nattribute-formed class-specific space, where concepts are descriptions of\nspecific attributes for specific classes. In this way, ALBM can avoid the\nspurious cue inference problem by classifying solely based on the essential\nconcepts of each class. In addition, the cross-class unified attribute set also\nensures that the concept spaces of different classes have strong correlations,\nas a result, the learned concept classifier can be easily generalized to unseen\nclasses. Moreover, to further improve interpretability, we propose Visual\nAttribute Prompt Learning (VAPL) to extract visual features on fine-grained\nattributes. Furthermore, to avoid labor-intensive concept annotation, we\npropose the Description, Summary, and Supplement (DSS) strategy to\nautomatically generate high-quality concept sets with a complete and precise\nattribute.

This study examines the concept of information digestion-the\nprocess through which information is accurately understood-and aims to\nelucidate differences in the information digestion processes of sellers and\nbuyers to clarify the role of product page information. To address this, we\nconducted two experiments: a questionnaire survey involving 400 subjects and a\nconjoint analysis with eye-tracking for 15 participants. Initially, we selected\neight sample products from four distinct product categories based on the Foote,\nCone, and Belding (FCB) grid and compared the product information components\nconsidered important by sellers and buyers. Subsequently, we created 12 types\nof product pages that varied in the combination of four attributes: title,\nprice, product description, and image. Experiment 1 revealed significant\ndifferences in the perceived importance of product page components between\nbuyers and sellers. It also demonstrated that product categories and\ntransaction experience influenced the importance assigned to these components,\nparticularly for buyers. Results from Experiment 2 showed that buyers\nprioritize product descriptions and identified two distinct buyer groups based\non their information digestion patterns: one that carefully reads and digests\ninformation and another that processes information more rapidly.

Due\nto the development of powerful software tools that can deal efficiently and\naccurately with higher-order modes in each port, researchers need conversion\nrules between multimode network parameters.

We develop a group-theoretic\nframework to describe the symmetry packaging for a variety of concrete\nsymmetries and to classify the corresponding packaged states: \\textbf{(1)} We\nprove that for any finite or compact group $G$, there exist $G$-associated\npackaged subspaces, in which every vector is automatically a packaged state.

Successful furniture\narrangement requires proper physical relationships (e.g., collision avoidance)\nand spacing relationships between furniture and their functional zones to be\nrespected. However, manually defined relationships are almost always incomplete\nand can produce unrealistic layouts. This work instead extracts spacing\nrelationships automatically based on a hierarchical analysis and adopts the\nDelaunay Triangulation to produce important triple relationships. Compared to\npairwise relationship modeling, triple relationships account for interactions\nand space utilization among multiple objects. To this end, we introduce\nRelTriple, a novel approach that enhances furniture distribution by learning\nspacing relationships between objects and regions. We formulate triple\nrelationships as object-to-object (O2O) losses and object-to-region (O2R)\nlosses and integrate them directly into the training process of generative\ndiffusion.

While standard\nfinite difference schemes are, in general, not monotone, the so-called\nsemi-Lagrangian schemes are monotone by construction.

To address this challenge, our primary focus is\non obtaining high resolution time-frequency representations (TFRs) from their\nlow resolution counterparts. Recognizing that the curve features of TFRs are a\nspecific type of texture feature, we argue that pre trained generative models\nsuch as Stable Diffusion (SD) are well suited for enhancing TFRs, thanks to\ntheir powerful capability in capturing texture representations.

    "abstract": "The complexity of condensed matter arises from emergent behaviors that cannot\nbe understood by analyzing individual constituents in isolation. While\ntraditional condensed-matter approaches-developed primarily for ideal\ncrystalline solids-have provided deep insights into symmetry, order, and\nelectronic structure, they fall short in describing the rich, multiscale\norganization of hierarchical and soft materials. These systems exhibit\nstructural correlations across multiple length and time scales, often governed\nby nonlinear interactions that span from molecular to macroscopic domains. This\nreview explores how the convergence of emerging experimental and computational\nstrategies are redefining our ability to characterize and model such systems.\nWe examine how multimodal techniques-combining scattering, imaging, and\nspectroscopy-can map structural order and dynamics across scales, with methods\nlike small-angle scattering tensor tomography, dark-field imaging, and\nultrafast spectroscopies providing unprecedented spatiotemporal resolution. On\nthe computational front, machine learning approaches such as graph neural\nnetworks, neural operators, and physics-informed models offer powerful tools to\nconnect disparate scales and uncover hidden correlations in high-dimensional\ndata. These advancements have the potential to close the gap between structure\nand function in complex materials, thereby addressing one of the grand\nchallenges of contemporary material science: understanding and engineering\nmultiscale architectures, whose emergent properties underpin the behavior of\nnext-generation functional materials, biological systems, and adaptive\ntechnologies.",

While vulnerability databases provide valuable\ninformation for mitigation, many security patches are released silently in new\ncommits of OSS repositories without explicit indications of their security\nimpact. This makes it challenging for software maintainers and users to detect\nand address these vulnerability fixes. There are a few approaches for detecting\nvulnerability-fixing commits (VFCs) but most of these approaches leverage\ncommit messages, which would miss silent VFCs. On the other hand, there are\nsome approaches for detecting silent VFCs based on code change patterns but\nthey often fail to adequately characterize vulnerability fix patterns, thereby\nlacking effectiveness. For example, some approaches analyze each hunk in known\nVFCs, in isolation, to learn vulnerability fix patterns; but vulnerabiliy fixes\nare often associated with multiple hunks, in which cases correlations of code\nchanges across those hunks are essential for characterizing the vulnerability\nfixes. To address these problems, we first conduct a large-scale empirical\nstudy on 11,900 VFCs across six programming languages, in which we found that\nover 70% of VFCs involve multiple hunks with various types of correlations.\nBased on our findings, we propose Fixseeker, a graph-based approach that\nextracts the various correlations between code changes at the hunk level to\ndetect silent vulnerability fixes.

These failures result in considerable\nwaste of resource and time, highlighting the critical need for effective and\nefficient failure diagnosis to reduce the cost of LLM training.\n  In this paper, we present the first empirical study on the failure reports of\n428 LLM training failures in our production Platform-X between May 2023 and\nApril 2024. Our study reveals that hardware and user faults are the predominant\nroot causes, and current diagnosis processes rely heavily on training logs.\nUnfortunately, existing log-based diagnostic methods fall short in handling LLM\ntraining logs. Considering the unique features of LLM training, we identify\nthree distinct patterns of LLM training logs: cross-job, spatial, and temporal\npatterns. We then introduce our Log-based Large-scale LLM training failure\ndiagnosis framework, L4, which can automatically extract failure-indicating\ninformation (i.e., log events, nodes, stages, and iterations) from extensive\ntraining logs, thereby reducing manual effort and facilitating failure\nrecovery.

However, these well-trained models can hardly detect the\nundefined new keypoints in test time, which largely hinders their feasibility\nfor diverse downstream tasks. To handle this, various solutions are explored\nbut still suffer from either limited generalizability or transferability.\nTherefore, in this paper, we explore a novel keypoint learning paradigm in that\nwe only annotate new keypoints in the new data and incrementally train the\nmodel, without retaining any old data, called Incremental object Keypoint\nLearning (IKL). A two-stage learning scheme as a novel baseline tailored to IKL\nis developed. In the first Knowledge Association stage, given the data labeled\nwith only new keypoints, an auxiliary KA-Net is trained to automatically\nassociate the old keypoints to these new ones based on their spatial and\nintrinsic anatomical relations. In the second Mutual Promotion stage, based on\na keypoint-oriented spatial distillation loss, we jointly leverage the\nauxiliary KA-Net and the old model for knowledge consolidation to mutually\npromote the estimation of all old and new keypoints. Owing to the investigation\nof the correlations between new and old keypoints, our proposed method can not\njust effectively mitigate the catastrophic forgetting of old keypoints, but may\neven further improve the estimation of the old ones and achieve a positive\ntransfer beyond anti-forgetting.

    "abstract": "Modern software systems are developed in diverse programming languages and\noften harbor critical vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit to compromise\nsecurity. These vulnerabilities have been actively targeted in real-world\nattacks, causing substantial harm to users and cyberinfrastructure. Since many\nof these flaws originate from the code itself, a variety of techniques have\nbeen proposed to detect and mitigate them prior to software deployment.\nHowever, a comprehensive comparative study that spans different programming\nlanguages, program representations, bug types, and analysis techniques is still\nlacking. As a result, the relationships among programming languages,\nabstraction levels, vulnerability types, and detection approaches remain\nfragmented, and the limitations and research gaps across the landscape are not\nclearly understood. This article aims to bridge that gap by systematically\nexamining widely used programming languages, levels of program representation,\ncategories of vulnerabilities, and mainstream detection techniques. The survey\nprovides a detailed understanding of current practices in vulnerability\ndiscovery, highlighting their strengths, limitations, and distinguishing\ncharacteristics. Furthermore, it identifies persistent challenges and outlines\npromising directions for future research in the field of software security.",

    "abstract": "In online advertising systems, publishers often face a trade-off in\ninformation disclosure strategies: while disclosing more information can\nenhance efficiency by enabling optimal allocation of ad impressions, it may\nlose revenue potential by decreasing uncertainty among competing advertisers.\nSimilar to other challenges in market design, understanding this trade-off is\nconstrained by limited access to real-world data, leading researchers and\npractitioners to turn to simulation frameworks. The recent emergence of large\nlanguage models (LLMs) offers a novel approach to simulations, providing\nhuman-like reasoning and adaptability without necessarily relying on explicit\nassumptions about agent behavior modeling. Despite their potential, existing\nframeworks have yet to integrate LLM-based agents for studying information\nasymmetry and signaling strategies, particularly in the context of auctions. To\naddress this gap, we introduce InfoBid, a flexible simulation framework that\nleverages LLM agents to examine the effects of information disclosure\nstrategies in multi-agent auction settings. Using GPT-4o, we implemented\nsimulations of second-price auctions with diverse information schemas. The\nresults reveal key insights into how signaling influences strategic behavior\nand auction outcomes, which align with both economic and social learning\ntheories. Through InfoBid, we hope to foster the use of LLMs as proxies for\nhuman economic and social agents in empirical studies, enhancing our\nunderstanding of their capabilities and limitations. This work bridges the gap\nbetween theoretical market designs and practical applications, advancing\nresearch in market simulations, information design, and agent-based reasoning\nwhile offering a valuable tool for exploring the dynamics of digital economies.",

The dealer decodes the transmitted keys relying on the\nnonlocal hyperentanglement-assisted polarization GHZ state analysis. Our QSS\nprotocol is unconditionally secure in theory. We develop simulation method to\nestimate its performance in practical environment. Compared with the QSS based\non the GHZ state, our protocol has several advantages. First, it does not\nrequire basis selection and can completely distinguish eight polarization GHZ\nstates, which can improve the utilization rate of entanglement resources to\n100$\\%$ and increase the key generation rate by an order of magnitude. Second,\nit only requires one round of classical communication, and thus can reduce key\ngeneration time by 69.4$\\%$. Third, it can eliminate the weak random security\nvulnerabilities associated with the basis selection. Finally, our protocol only\nuses linear optical elements, which makes it practically feasible. Our QSS\nprotocol has potential application in future quantum communication network.",

    "abstract": "In this report, we present Qwen2.5-Omni, an end-to-end multimodal model\ndesigned to perceive diverse modalities, including text, images, audio, and\nvideo, while simultaneously generating text and natural speech responses in a\nstreaming manner. To enable the streaming of multimodal information inputs,\nboth audio and visual encoders utilize a block-wise processing approach. To\nsynchronize the timestamps of video inputs with audio, we organize the audio\nand video sequentially in an interleaved manner and propose a novel position\nembedding approach, named TMRoPE(Time-aligned Multimodal RoPE). To concurrently\ngenerate text and speech while avoiding interference between the two\nmodalities, we propose \\textbf{Thinker-Talker} architecture. In this framework,\nThinker functions as a large language model tasked with text generation, while\nTalker is a dual-track autoregressive model that directly utilizes the hidden\nrepresentations from the Thinker to produce audio tokens as output. Both the\nThinker and Talker models are designed to be trained and inferred in an\nend-to-end manner. For decoding audio tokens in a streaming manner, we\nintroduce a sliding-window DiT that restricts the receptive field, aiming to\nreduce the initial package delay. Qwen2.5-Omni is comparable with the similarly\nsized Qwen2.5-VL and outperforms Qwen2-Audio. Furthermore, Qwen2.5-Omni\nachieves state-of-the-art performance on multimodal benchmarks like Omni-Bench.\nNotably, Qwen2.5-Omni's performance in end-to-end speech instruction following\nis comparable to its capabilities with text inputs, as evidenced by benchmarks\nsuch as MMLU and GSM8K. As for speech generation, Qwen2.5-Omni's streaming\nTalker outperforms most existing streaming and non-streaming alternatives in\nrobustness and naturalness.",

    "abstract": "The process of spin-charge interconversion is critical in modern spintronics.\nNonetheless, experiments conducted on a wide variety of magnetic\nheterostructures consistently report that charge-to-spin and spin-to-charge\nconversion efficiencies can be vastly different, especially in the case of\ntopological insulators (TI). This discrepancy between the two \"reciprocal\"\neffects remains unexplained, hampering the development of spin devices based on\nspin-charge conversion. In this study, we investigate both spin-charge and\ncharge-spin interconversion processes in TI Bi2Te3/Py and Pt/Py bilayers\nexperimentally using spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance and spin pumping\ntechniques. We find that the measured charge-to-spin conversion efficiency\n(C-S) in TI/Py is ~26 times larger than the measured spin-to-charge conversion\nefficiency (S-C), whereas C-S and S-C are comparable in the case of Pt/Py.\nUsing a theoretical model enforcing Onsager reciprocity, we show that\nspin-to-charge and charge-to-spin conversions in bilayers are genuinely\ninequivalent, and explain our results as arising from the distinct spin current\nleakage that takes place during the interconversion. This work clarifies\nprevious conflicting reports on spin-charge interconversion processes and\nhighlights the potential of interface engineering to achieve efficient spin\ntransport in TI-based ferromagnetic heterostructures, paving the way for highly\nefficient spintronic devices.",

A key bottleneck\nstems from the proliferation of visual tokens required for fine-grained image\nunderstanding. We propose Skip-Vision, a unified framework addressing both\ntraining and inference inefficiencies in vision-language models. On top of\nconventional token compression approaches, our method introduces two\ncomplementary acceleration strategies. For training acceleration, we observe\nthat Feed-Forward Network (FFN) computations on visual tokens induce marginal\nfeature updates. This motivates our Skip-FFN strategy, which bypasses FFN\nlayers for redundant visual tokens. For inference acceleration, we design a\nselective KV-cache removal mechanism that prunes the skipped key-value pairs\nduring decoding while preserving model performance. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that Skip-Vision reduces training time by up to 35\\%, inference\nFLOPs by 75\\%, and latency by 45\\%, while achieving comparable or superior\nperformance to existing methods.

However, deep networks often produce over-confident or\nunder-confident predictions, leading to miscalibration. Various methods have\nbeen proposed to address this issue by designing effective loss functions for\ncalibration, such as focal loss. In this paper, we analyze its effectiveness\nand provide a unified loss framework of focal loss and its variants, where we\nmainly attribute their superiority in model calibration to the loss weighting\nfactor that estimates sample-wise uncertainty. Based on our analysis, existing\nloss functions fail to achieve optimal calibration performance due to two main\nissues: including misalignment during optimization and insufficient precision\nin uncertainty estimation. Specifically, focal loss cannot align sample\nuncertainty with gradient scaling and the single logit cannot indicate the\nuncertainty. To address these issues, we reformulate the optimization from the\nperspective of gradients, which focuses on uncertain samples. Meanwhile, we\npropose using the Brier Score as the loss weight factor, which provides a more\naccurate uncertainty estimation via all the logits.

In this paper, we present the first\nsynthetic-to-real robust depth estimation framework, incorporating motion and\nstructure priors to capture real-world knowledge effectively. In the synthetic\nadaptation, we transfer motion-structure knowledge inside cost volumes for\nbetter robust representation, using a frozen daytime model to train a depth\nestimator in synthetic adverse conditions. In the innovative real adaptation,\nwhich targets to fix synthetic-real gaps, models trained earlier identify the\nweather-insensitive regions with a designed consistency-reweighting strategy to\nemphasize valid pseudo-labels.

    "abstract": "Behavior recognition is an important task in video representation learning.\nAn essential aspect pertains to effective feature learning conducive to\nbehavior recognition. Recently, researchers have started to study fine-grained\nbehavior recognition, which provides similar behaviors and encourages the model\nto concern with more details of behaviors with effective features for\ndistinction. However, previous fine-grained behaviors limited themselves to\ncontrolling partial information to be similar, leading to an unfair and not\ncomprehensive evaluation of existing works. In this work, we develop a new\nvideo fine-grained behavior dataset, named BEAR, which provides fine-grained\n(i.e. similar) behaviors that uniquely focus on two primary factors defining\nbehavior: Environment and Action. It includes two fine-grained behavior\nprotocols including Fine-grained Behavior with Similar Environments and\nFine-grained Behavior with Similar Actions as well as multiple sub-protocols as\ndifferent scenarios. Furthermore, with this new dataset, we conduct multiple\nexperiments with different behavior recognition models. Our research primarily\nexplores the impact of input modality, a critical element in studying the\nenvironmental and action-based aspects of behavior recognition. Our\nexperimental results yield intriguing insights that have substantial\nimplications for further research endeavors.",

This work tackles two key challenges:\nefficient skill acquisition from limited human demonstrations and\ncontext-driven skill selection. We introduce AdaDexGrasp, a framework that\nlearns a library of grasping skills from a single human demonstration per skill\nand selects the most suitable one using a vision-language model (VLM). To\nimprove sample efficiency, we propose a trajectory following reward that guides\nreinforcement learning (RL) toward states close to a human demonstration while\nallowing flexibility in exploration. To learn beyond the single demonstration,\nwe employ curriculum learning, progressively increasing object pose variations\nto enhance robustness. At deployment, a VLM retrieves the appropriate skill\nbased on user instructions, bridging low-level learned skills with high-level\nintent. We evaluate AdaDexGrasp in both simulation and real-world settings,\nshowing that our approach significantly improves RL efficiency and enables\nlearning human-like grasp strategies across varied object configurations.\nFinally, we demonstrate zero-shot transfer of our learned policies to a\nreal-world PSYONIC Ability Hand, with a 90% success rate across objects,\nsignificantly outperforming the baseline.",

Energy\nbudget and transfer analysis between modes were conducted for two-dimensional\nflow around a cylinder with eigenmodes growing or decaying from a steady flow.\nUsing the linearized energy transfer equation and eigenmodes from global\nstability analysis, we identify the energy budget and spatial distribution that\ndetermine growth rates of the modes. Moreover, energy budget and transfer\nanalysis are realized by considering the time evolution of the eigenmodes, even\nduring the nonlinear development of the eigenmodes. By introducing time-varying\ndynamic mode decomposition with a phase-control strategy for multiple\ntime-series datasets from numerical simulations of the phase-controlled initial\nflow, time-varying eigenmodes are extracted in the transient two-dimensional\ncylinder flow. With the extracted time-dependent modes and the derived energy\ntransfer equations, the time evolution of the energy budget and spatial\ndistribution of energy transfer can be computed until the eigenmodes developed\nfrom the steady field reach the post-transient periodic flow.

We introduce\nnovel robustness metrics and analyze four state-of-the-art code LLMs, revealing\nthat, on average, 43.1% of their generated code is less robust than\nhuman-written counterparts.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in large language models have highlighted the critical need\nfor precise control over model outputs through predefined constraints. While\nexisting methods attempt to achieve this through either direct\ninstruction-response synthesis or preferential response optimization, they\noften struggle with constraint understanding and adaptation. This limitation\nbecomes particularly evident when handling fine-grained constraints, leading to\neither hallucination or brittle performance. We introduce Generative\nAdversarial Policy Optimization (GAPO), a novel framework that combines\nGAN-based training dynamics with an encoder-only reward model to progressively\nlearn and adapt to increasingly complex constraints. GAPO leverages adversarial\ntraining to automatically generate training samples of varying difficulty while\nutilizing the encoder-only architecture to better capture prompt-response\nrelationships. Extensive experiments demonstrate GAPO's superior performance\nacross multiple benchmarks, particularly in scenarios requiring fine-grained\nconstraint handling, where it significantly outperforms existing methods like\nPPO, DPO, and KTO. Our results suggest that GAPO's unique approach to\npreferential prompt learning offers a more robust and effective solution for\ncontrolling LLM outputs.

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning often faces challenges with reward misalignment, where\nagents optimize for given rewards but fail to exhibit the desired behaviors.\nThis occurs when the reward function incentivizes proxy behaviors that diverge\nfrom the true objective. While human-in-the-loop (HIL) methods can help, they\nmay exacerbate the problem, as humans are prone to biases that lead to\ninconsistent, subjective, or misaligned feedback, complicating the learning\nprocess. To address these issues, we propose two key contributions. First, we\nextend the use of zero-shot, off-the-shelf large language models (LLMs) for\nreward shaping beyond natural language processing (NLP) to continuous control\ntasks. By leveraging LLMs as direct feedback providers, we replace surrogate\nmodels trained on human feedback, which often suffer from the bias inherent in\nthe feedback data it is trained on. Second, we introduce a hybrid framework\n(LLM-HFBF) that enables LLMs to identify and correct biases in human feedback\nwhile incorporating this feedback into the reward shaping process. The LLM-HFBF\nframework creates a more balanced and reliable system by addressing both the\nlimitations of LLMs (e.g., lack of domain-specific knowledge) and human\nsupervision (e.g., inherent biases). By enabling human feedback bias flagging\nand correction, our approach improves reinforcement learning performance and\nreduces reliance on potentially biased human guidance. Empirical experiments\nshow that biased human feedback significantly reduces performance, with average\nepisodic reward (AER) dropping from 28.472 in (unbiased approaches) to 7.039\n(biased with conservative bias). In contrast, LLM-based approaches maintain a\nmatching AER like unbiased feedback, even in custom edge case scenarios.",

    "abstract": "We present a summary of the in-orbit performance of the soft X-ray imaging\ntelescope Xtend onboard the XRISM mission, based on in-flight observation data,\nincluding first-light celestial objects, calibration sources, and results from\nthe cross-calibration campaign with other currently-operating X-ray\nobservatories. XRISM/Xtend has a large field of view of $38.5'\\times38.5'$,\ncovering an energy range of 0.4--13 keV, as demonstrated by the first-light\nobservation of the galaxy cluster Abell 2319. It also features an energy\nresolution of 170--180 eV at 6 keV, which meets the mission requirement and\nenables to resolve He-like and H-like Fe K$\\alpha$ lines. Throughout the\nobservation during the performance verification phase, we confirm that two\nissues identified in SXI onboard the previous Hitomi mission -- light leakage\nand crosstalk events -- are addressed and suppressed in the case of Xtend. A\njoint cross-calibration observation of the bright quasar 3C273 results in an\neffective area measured to be $\\sim420$ cm$^{2}$@1.5 keV and $\\sim310$\ncm$^{2}$@6.0 keV, which matches values obtained in ground tests. We also\ncontinuously monitor the health of Xtend by analyzing overclocking data,\ncalibration source spectra, and day-Earth observations: the readout noise is\nstable and low, and contamination is negligible even one year after launch. A\nlow background level compared to other major X-ray instruments onboard\nsatellites, combined with the largest grasp ($\\Omega_{\\rm eff}\\sim60$ ${\\rm\ncm^2~degree^2}$) of Xtend, will not only support Resolve analysis, but also\nenable significant scientific results on its own. This includes near future\nfollow-up observations and transient searches in the context of time-domain and\nmulti-messenger astrophysics.",

In this\npaper, we propose a compact discrete skill space for offline RL tasks supported\nby state-of-the-art transformer-based encoder and diffusion-based decoder.\nCoupled with a high-level policy trained via offline RL techniques, our method\nestablishes a hierarchical RL framework where the trained diffusion decoder\nplays a pivotal role. Empirical evaluations show that the proposed algorithm,\nDiscrete Diffusion Skill (DDS), is a powerful offline RL method. DDS performs\ncompetitively on Locomotion and Kitchen tasks and excels on long-horizon tasks,\nachieving at least a 12 percent improvement on AntMaze-v2 benchmarks compared\nto existing offline RL approaches.

    "abstract": "The direct imaging of Earth-like planets in solar neighbors is challenging.\nBoth transit and radial velocity (RV) methods suffer from noise due to stellar\nactivity. By choosing a typical configuration of an X array interferometer, we\nused theoretical formulas to calculate the intrinsic Poisson noise and the\nnoise of stellar activities. Assuming a fixed array with no rotation and\nignoring other systematic and astrophysical noises, we considered a single\nactive region on a stellar disk, including both spots and flares with different\nparameters, for instance, the position, size, and temperature of the active\nregions. Then we simulated the S/N of Earth-like planets in HZ around G dwarf\nstars (solar-like) and M dwarfs (Proxima-like), with different stellar\nactivities in the mid-infrared (MIR) band ( 7-12 $\\mu$m). The noise attributed\nto stellar activity has much less influence than the Transit and RV method when\ndetecting Earth-like planets around both G and M dwarfs. I.e. Stellar activity\ncan hardly influence the detection of Earth-like planets around G dwarf stars.\nHowever, detecting Earth-like planets around M dwarfs, which are usually more\nactive, can be significantly hindered. We also analyzed the uncertainty of the\nplanet's location due to the deduced S/N. Consequently, we have determined the\npossibility of mistaking a planet in the HZ as being outside the HZ based on an\nerroneous S/N measurement. Selecting quiescent target stars or monitoring the\nlight curves of stars would be a helpful way to get rid of contaminates\nassociated with violent stellar activities.",

In this paper, we propose to improve MHA by\nexploring diverse learners and introducing various interactions between heads,\nwhich results in a Hierarchical multI-head atteNtion driven Transformer model,\ntermed HINT, for image restoration. HINT contains two modules, i.e., the\nHierarchical Multi-Head Attention (HMHA) and the Query-Key Cache Updating\n(QKCU) module, to address the redundancy problem that is rooted in vanilla MHA.\nSpecifically, HMHA extracts diverse contextual features by employing heads to\nlearn from subspaces of varying sizes and containing different information.\nMoreover, QKCU, comprising intra- and inter-layer schemes, further reduces the\nredundancy problem by facilitating enhanced interactions between attention\nheads within and across layers. Extensive experiments are conducted on 12\nbenchmarks across 5 image restoration tasks, including low-light enhancement,\ndehazing, desnowing, denoising, and deraining, to demonstrate the superiority\nof HINT.

However, these approaches may overlook geometric complexity, resulting\nin suboptimal interaction fidelity. To address this limitation, we introduce\nROG, a novel diffusion-based framework that models the spatiotemporal\nrelationships inherent in HOIs with rich geometric detail. For efficient object\nrepresentation, we select boundary-focused and fine-detail key points from the\nobject mesh, ensuring a comprehensive depiction of the object's geometry.

Furthermore, we develop a diffusion-based\nrelation model that integrates spatial and temporal attention mechanisms,\nenabling a better understanding of intricate HOI relationships. This relation\nmodel refines the generated motion's IDF, guiding the motion generation process\nto produce relation-aware and semantically aligned movements.

Within this framework, we\nintroduce a dual-core ENSO model (DCM) that integrates two widely used ENSO\nmodeling approaches: a linear stochastic model confined to the equator and a\nnonlinear intermediate model extending off-equator. The stochastic model\nensures computational efficiency and statistical accuracy. It captures\nessential ENSO characteristics and reproduces the observed non-Gaussian\nstatistics. Meanwhile, the nonlinear model assimilates pseudo-observations from\nthe stochastic model while resolving key air-sea interactions, such as feedback\nbalances and spatial patterns of sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTA)\nduring El Ni\\~no peaks and improving western-central Pacific SSTA magnitudes\nand spatial accuracy. The DCM effectively captures the realistic dynamical and\nstatistical features of the ENSO diversity and complexity.

The classical meet-in-the-middle (MIM)\nalgorithm of Horowitz--Sahni runs in $\\mathcal{O}^*(2^{n/2})$, which remains\nthe best-known deterministic bound. Yet in practice, many instances exhibit\nabundant collisions in partial sums, so the true difficulty is often governed\nby $U = |\\Sigma(S)|$, the number of unique subset sums.\n  We present a structure-aware, adaptive solver that enumerates only the\ndistinct subset sums, pruning duplicates on the fly and achieving deterministic\nruntime $\\mathcal{O}(U \\cdot n^2)$ and expected randomized runtime\n$\\mathcal{O}(U \\cdot n)$. Its core is a canonical unique-subset-sums enumerator\ncombined with a double meet-in-the-middle strategy, supporting anytime and\nonline modes.\n  To ensure worst-case gains even on unstructured inputs, we introduce a\nControlled Aliasing technique that provably reduces the enumeration space by a\nfixed constant factor. This yields a guaranteed global runtime of\n$\\mathcal{O}^*(2^{n/2 - \\varepsilon})$ for some $\\varepsilon > 0$, strictly\nimproving upon classical bounds.\n  Empirical results show that the solver adapts efficiently to structured\ninputs with low entropy (e.g., instances with small doubling constants,\nduplicates, or additive progressions) often approaching near-dynamic\nprogramming performance.

    "abstract": "Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are a type of highly-polarized, millisecond-duration\nelectromagnetic pulses in the radio band, which are mostly produced at\ncosmological distances. These properties provide a natural laboratory for\ntesting the extreme Faraday effect, a phenomenon in which two different\npropagation modes of a pulse separate after passing through a dense, highly\nionized, and magnetized medium. We derive the critical condition (e.g.,\nrotation measure) for the extreme Faraday effect to occur in FRBs, which\nexceeds the currently observed maximum value but remains within the\ntheoretically predicted range.

However, despite the significance of safety alignment,\nresearch on the vulnerabilities remains largely underexplored. In this paper,\nwe investigate the unexplored vulnerability of the safety alignment, examining\nits ability to consistently provide safety guarantees for\nout-of-distribution(OOD)-ifying harmful inputs that may fall outside the\naligned data distribution. Our key observation is that OOD-ifying the vanilla\nharmful inputs highly increases the uncertainty of the model to discern the\nmalicious intent within the input, leading to a higher chance of being\njailbroken. Exploiting this vulnerability, we propose JOOD, a new Jailbreak\nframework via OOD-ifying inputs beyond the safety alignment. We explore various\noff-the-shelf visual and textual transformation techniques for OOD-ifying the\nharmful inputs. Notably, we observe that even simple mixing-based techniques\nsuch as image mixup prove highly effective in increasing the uncertainty of the\nmodel, thereby facilitating the bypass of the safety alignment. Experiments\nacross diverse jailbreak scenarios demonstrate that JOOD effectively jailbreaks\nrecent proprietary LLMs and MLLMs such as GPT-4 and o1 with high attack success\nrate, which previous attack approaches have consistently struggled to\njailbreak.

We challenge this notion by\nintroducing a new sufficient condition for local linear convergence: as long as\nthe converged primal-dual optimal solutions satisfy strict complementarity,\nADMM attains local linear convergence, independent of nondegeneracy conditions.\nOur proof is based on a direct local linearization of the ADMM operator and a\nrefined error bound for the projection onto the positive semidefinite cone,\nimproving previous bounds and revealing the anisotropic nature of projection\nresiduals. Extensive numerical experiments confirm the significance of our\ntheoretical results, demonstrating that ADMM achieves local linear convergence\nand computes high-accuracy solutions in a variety of SDP instances, including\nthose cases where nondegeneracy fails.

The challenge lies in obtaining accurate\nmodels due to limited diverse training data, particularly in regions with\nlimited visits (uncertain regions). Existing approaches passively quantify\nuncertainty after sample generation, failing to actively collect uncertain\nsamples that could enhance state coverage and improve model accuracy. Moreover,\nMBRL often faces difficulties in making accurate multi-step predictions,\nthereby impacting overall performance.

A symbol-pair code that meets\nthe Singleton-type bound is called a maximum distance separable (MDS)\nsymbol-pair code. MDS symbol-pair codes are optimal in the sense that they have\nthe highest pair error-correcting capability. In this paper, we focus on new\nconstructions of MDS symbol-pair codes using simple-root cyclic codes.\nSpecifically, three new infinite families of $(n, d_P)_q$-MDS symbol-pair codes\nare obtained: (1) $(n=4q+4,d_P=7)_q$ for $q\\equiv 1\\pmod 4$; (2)\n$(n=4q-4,d_P=8)_q$ for $q\\equiv 3\\pmod 4$; (3) $(n=2q+2,d_P=9)_q$ for $q$ being\nan odd prime power. The first two constructions are based on analyzing the\nsolutions of certain equations over finite fields. The third construction\narises from the decomposition of cyclic codes, where we utilize the orthogonal\nrelationships between component codes and their duals to rigorously exclude the\npresence of specific codewords. It is worth noting that for the pair distance\n$d_P=7$ or $8$, our $q$-ary MDS symbol-pair codes achieve the longest known\ncode length when $q$ is not a prime.

    "abstract": "Shewhart Control Charts (SCC)s are constructed under the assumption of\nnormality and are widely recognized in statistical quality control by numerous\nresearchers. Problems arise when the distribution of process data does not\nconform to a typical Normal Distribution (ND) or when there is insufficient\nevidence to confirm that the data has approximately ND. Additionally, in some\nprocesses, Tied Observations (TO)s are present. The resolution of the\nmeasurement device used to assess a quality characteristic can lead to rounding\nerrors, as well as TOs. In many cases, SCCs prove inadequate. In this paper, we\naddress the challenges of non-normal observations and rounding errors by\ndeveloping a Shewhart Signed-Rank Control Chart (SS-RCC) based on the Wilcoxon\nstatistic. We define a random variable for TOs and another for Untied\nObservations (UO)s. Subsequently, we approximate their distributions using a\nScaled-Normal Distribution (SND) and apply a Deep Learning (DL) model to\nestimate the scale parameters of the SND for the Control Chart (CC). In\npractice, we calculate the Average Run Length ($ARL$) for specific cases using\nJohnson-type distribution benchmarks to illustrate the effects of ties and\nshifts in manufacturing processes.",

Hence, this system can\noperate as an active magneto-heat engine or pump in the presence of a load\nforce. Interestingly, we observe that the activity or self-propulsion impacts\nthe thermodynamic performance characteristics of the gyrator only in the\npresence of the magnetic field. We examine two scenarios: first, by applying a\nload in a direction opposing the torque and second, by applying a load in the\nsame direction as that of torque.\n  In the first case, for a fixed parameter regime, the gyrator is found to act\nas a heat engine or a heat pump depending on the strength of the applied load,\nwhereas in the latter case, it can only operate as a heat pump. Moreover,\nunlike the Brownian gyrator or Brownian magneto gyrator, captivatingly, the\nefficiency is found to have no universal upper bound and can be made $100\\%$ by\ntuning the system parameters.

The end-to-end system is analyzed for two cases, i) the perfect\nalignment, and ii) the misalignment fading due to the random mechanical\nvibrations in the optical inter-satellite link. It is found that the harvested\npower is maximized when the distance between the SPS and LLO satellite is\nminimized and it is calculated as 331.94 kW, however, when the random\nmisalignment fading is considered, the mean of the harvested power reduces to\n309.49 kW for the same distance. In the next hop, the power harvested by the\nsolar array on the LLO satellite is consumed entirely as the relay power.\nIdentical parabolic antennas are considered during the RF-based WPT system\nbetween the LLO satellite and the LSP, which utilizes a full-tracking module,\nand between the LLO satellite and the Malapert Mountain region, which uses a\nhalf-tracking module that executes the tracking on the receiver dish only.

To address these challenges, we introduce TheoryCoder, an\ninstantiation of TBRL that exploits hierarchical representations of theories\nand efficient program synthesis methods for more powerful learning and\nplanning. TheoryCoder equips agents with general-purpose abstractions (e.g.,\n\"move to\"), which are then grounded in a particular environment by learning a\nlow-level transition model (a Python program synthesized from observations by a\nlarge language model). A bilevel planning algorithm can exploit this\nhierarchical structure to solve large domains.

Most existing\ntheoretical results in robust regression assume that the noise has a finite\nabsolute mean, an assumption violated by certain distributions, such as Cauchy\nand some Pareto noise. In this paper, we introduce a generalized Cauchy noise\nframework that accommodates all noise distributions with finite moments of any\norder, even when the absolute mean is infinite. Within this framework, we study\nthe \\textit{kernel Cauchy ridge regressor} (\\textit{KCRR}), which minimizes a\nregularized empirical Cauchy risk to achieve robustness. To derive the\n$L_2$-risk bound for KCRR, we establish a connection between the excess Cauchy\nrisk and $L_2$-risk for sufficiently large scale parameters of the Cauchy loss,\nwhich reveals that these two risks are equivalent. Furthermore, under the\nassumption that the regression function satisfies H\\\"older smoothness, we\nderive excess Cauchy risk bounds for KCRR, showing improved performance as the\nscale parameter decreases. By considering the twofold effect of the scale\nparameter on the excess Cauchy risk and its equivalence with the $L_2$-risk, we\nestablish the almost minimax-optimal convergence rate for KCRR in terms of\n$L_2$-risk, highlighting the robustness of the Cauchy loss in handling various\ntypes of noise.
