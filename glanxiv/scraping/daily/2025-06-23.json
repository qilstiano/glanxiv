We demonstrate that\neasily understandable and implementable strategies can enhance the risk-return\nprofile of a portfolio containing LETFs. Our analysis shows that seemingly\nreasonable investment strategies may result in undesirable Omega ratios, with\nthese effects compounding across rebalancing periods. By contrast, relatively\nsimple dynamic strategies that systematically de-risk the portfolio once gains\nare observed can exploit this compounding effect, taking advantage of favorable\nOmega ratio dynamics.

    "abstract": "Relative localization in the near-field scenario is critically important for\nunmanned vehicle (UxV) applications. Although related works addressing 2D\nrelative localization problem have been widely studied for unmanned ground\nvehicles (UGVs), the problem in 3D scenarios for unmanned aerial vehicles\n(UAVs) involves more uncertainties and remains to be investigated. Inspired by\nthe phenomenon that animals can achieve swarm behaviors solely based on\nindividual perception of relative information, this study proposes an\ninfrastructure-free 3D relative localization framework that relies exclusively\non onboard ultra-wideband (UWB) sensors. Leveraging 2D relative positioning\nresearch, we conducted feasibility analysis, system modeling, simulations,\nperformance evaluation, and field tests using UWB sensors. The key\ncontributions of this work include: derivation of the Cram\\'er-Rao lower bound\n(CRLB) and geometric dilution of precision (GDOP) for near-field scenarios;\ndevelopment of two localization algorithms -- one based on Euclidean distance\nmatrix (EDM) and another employing maximum likelihood estimation (MLE);\ncomprehensive performance comparison and computational complexity analysis\nagainst state-of-the-art methods; simulation studies and field experiments; a\nnovel sensor deployment strategy inspired by animal behavior, enabling\nsingle-sensor implementation within the proposed framework for UxV\napplications. The theoretical, simulation, and experimental results demonstrate\nstrong generalizability to other 3D near-field localization tasks, with\nsignificant potential for a cost-effective cross-platform UxV collaborative\nsystem.",

    "abstract": "Inspired by the amplitude bootstrap program, the spirit of this work is to\nconstrain the space of consistent inflationary correlation functions -\nspecifically, the bispectrum of curvature perturbations - using fundamental\nprinciples such as unitarity, locality, analyticity, and symmetries. To this\nend, we assume a setup for inflation in which de Sitter isometries are only\nmildly broken by the slow roll of the inflaton field, and study the bispectrum\nimprinted by a generic hidden sector during inflation. Assuming that the hidden\nsector's contributions to primordial non-Gaussianity are dominated by the\nexchange of a scalar operator (which does not preclude high-spin UV\ncompletions), we derive nontrivial positivity constraints on the resulting\nbispectrum $B(k_1,k_2,k_3)$. In particular, we show that $B$ must be negative\nin a certain region around the equilateral configuration. For instance, for\nisosceles triangles (with $k_2=k_3$) this region is given by $0.027\\lesssim\nk_3/k_1\\leq 2$. Furthermore, we demonstrate that unitarity imposes upper and\nlower bounds on the bispectrum shape, thereby carving out a Bispectrum Island\nwhere consistent shapes in our setup can reside. We complement our analysis by\ncontemplating alternative setups where the coupling to the hidden sector is\nallowed to strongly break de Sitter boosts. We also identify situations that\nwould push the bispectrum off the island and the profound physical features\nthey would reveal.",

In such an\napplication, vertices and/or edges of the graph may not be perfectly reliable;\nan agent may experience failure or a communication link rendered inoperable.\nWith the goal of designing robust swarm formations, or unit ball graphs with\nhigh reliability (probability of connectedness), in a preliminary conference\npaper we provided an algorithm with cubic time complexity to determine all\npossible changes to a unit ball graph by repositioning a single vertex. Using\nthis algorithm and Monte Carlo simulations, one obtains an efficient method to\nmodify a unit ball graph by moving a single vertex to a location which\nmaximizes the reliability. Another important consideration in many swarm\nmissions is area coverage, yet highly reliable ball graphs often contain\nclusters of vertices. Here, we generalize our previous algorithm to improve\narea coverage as well as reliability. Our algorithm determines a location to\nadd or move a vertex within a unit ball graph which maximizes the reliability,\nunder the constraint that no other vertices of the graph be within some fixed\ndistance.

We perform a comprehensive study spanning five diverse target\nlanguages, three base LLMs, and seven downstream tasks spanning over 4,100 GPU\ntraining hours (9,900+ TFLOPs) across various adaptation techniques: few-shot\nprompting, translate-test, fine-tuning, embedding re-initialization, and\ninstruction fine-tuning. Our results show that the few-shot prompting and\ntranslate-test settings tend to heavily outperform the gradient-based\nadaptation methods. To better understand this discrepancy, we design a novel\nmetric, Valid Output Recall (VOR), and analyze model outputs to empirically\nattribute the degradation of these trained models to catastrophic forgetting.\nTo the extent of our knowledge, this is the largest study done on in-context\nlearning for low-resource languages with respect to train compute and number of\nadaptation techniques considered. We make all our datasets and trained models\navailable for public use.",

    "authors": [

    ],
    "abstract": "We make two closely related theoretical contributions to the use of\nimportance sampling schemes. First, for independent sampling, we prove that the\nminimax optimal trial distribution coincides with the target if and only if the\ntarget distribution has no atom with probability greater than $1/2$, where\n\"minimax\" means that the worst-case asymptotic variance of the self-normalized\nimportance sampling estimator is minimized. When a large atom exists, it should\nbe downweighted by the trial distribution. A similar phenomenon holds for a\ncontinuous target distribution concentrated on a small set. Second, we argue\nthat it is often advantageous to run the Metropolis--Hastings algorithm with a\ntempered stationary distribution, $\\pi(x)^\\beta$, and correct for the bias by\nimportance weighting. The dynamics of this \"importance-tempered\" sampling\nscheme can be described by a continuous-time Markov chain. We prove that for\none-dimensional targets with polynomial tails, $\\pi(x) \\propto (1 +\n|x|)^{-\\gamma}$, this chain is uniformly ergodic if and only if $1/\\gamma <\n\\beta < (\\gamma - 2)/\\gamma$. These results suggest that for target\ndistributions with light or polynomial tails of order $\\gamma > 3$, importance\ntempering can improve the precision of time-average estimators and essentially\neliminate the need for burn-in.",

    "abstract": "Traditional mental health support systems often generate responses based\nsolely on the user's current emotion and situations, resulting in superficial\ninterventions that fail to address deeper emotional needs. This study\nintroduces a novel framework by integrating spiritual wisdom from the Bhagavad\nGita with advanced large language model GPT-4o to enhance emotional well-being.\nWe present the GITes (Gita Integrated Therapy for Emotional Support) dataset,\nwhich enhances the existing ExTES mental health dataset by including 10,729\nspiritually guided responses generated by GPT-4o and evaluated by domain\nexperts. We benchmark GITes against 12 state-of-the-art LLMs, including both\nmental health specific and general purpose models. To evaluate spiritual\nrelevance in generated responses beyond what conventional n-gram based metrics\ncapture, we propose a novel Spiritual Insight metric and automate assessment\nvia an LLM as jury framework using chain-of-thought prompting. Integrating\nspiritual guidance into AI driven support enhances both NLP and spiritual\nmetrics for the best performing LLM Phi3-Mini 3.2B Instruct, achieving\nimprovements of 122.71% in ROUGE, 126.53% in METEOR, 8.15% in BERT score,\n15.92% in Spiritual Insight, 18.61% in Sufficiency and 13.22% in Relevance\ncompared to its zero-shot counterpart. While these results reflect substantial\nimprovements across automated empathy and spirituality metrics, further\nvalidation in real world patient populations remains a necessary step. Our\nfindings indicate a strong potential for AI systems enriched with spiritual\nguidance to enhance user satisfaction and perceived support outcomes. The code\nand dataset will be publicly available to advance further research in this\nemerging area.",

    "abstract": "Bias field artifacts in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans introduce\nspatially smooth intensity inhomogeneities that degrade image quality and\nhinder downstream analysis. To address this challenge, we propose a novel\nvariational Hadamard U-Net (VHU-Net) for effective body MRI bias field\ncorrection. The encoder comprises multiple convolutional Hadamard transform\nblocks (ConvHTBlocks), each integrating convolutional layers with a Hadamard\ntransform (HT) layer. Specifically, the HT layer performs channel-wise\nfrequency decomposition to isolate low-frequency components, while a subsequent\nscaling layer and semi-soft thresholding mechanism suppress redundant\nhigh-frequency noise. To compensate for the HT layer's inability to model\ninter-channel dependencies, the decoder incorporates an inverse\nHT-reconstructed transformer block, enabling global, frequency-aware attention\nfor the recovery of spatially consistent bias fields. The stacked decoder\nConvHTBlocks further enhance the capacity to reconstruct the underlying\nground-truth bias field. Building on the principles of variational inference,\nwe formulate a new evidence lower bound (ELBO) as the training objective,\npromoting sparsity in the latent space while ensuring accurate bias field\nestimation. Comprehensive experiments on abdominal and prostate MRI datasets\ndemonstrate the superiority of VHU-Net over existing state-of-the-art methods\nin terms of intensity uniformity, signal fidelity, and tissue contrast.\nMoreover, the corrected images yield substantial downstream improvements in\nsegmentation accuracy. Our framework offers computational efficiency,\ninterpretability, and robust performance across multi-center datasets, making\nit suitable for clinical deployment.",

    "abstract": "The dominance of matter over antimatter in the universe has consistently\ndriven the pursuit of new physics beyond the Standard Model that violates\ncharge-parity symmetry. Unlike the well-constrained electrons and neutrons,\nstrange baryons (hyperons) remain a largely unexplored territory, in which\ninteractions between hyperons and particles from new physics could induce a\nnon-trivial electric dipole moment (EDM). However, direct measurements of\nhyperon EDMs through spin precession are highly challenging due to their short\nlifetimes. In this paper, we present a novel method to extract the EDM of the\nlightest hyperon, $\\Lambda$, using the entangled $\\Lambda$$\\overline{\\Lambda}$\nsystem. Our result is consistent with zero, achieving a\nthree-order-of-magnitude improvement over the previous upper limit established\nin the 1980s with comparable statistics, providing stringent constraints on\npotential new physics.",

    "abstract": "Affective interaction is not merely about recognizing emotions; it is an\nembodied, situated process shaped by context and co-created through\ninteraction. In affective computing, the role of haptic feedback within dynamic\nemotional exchanges remains underexplored. This study investigates how\nsituational emotional cues influence the perception and interpretation of\nhaptic signals given by a robot. In a controlled experiment, 32 participants\nwatched video scenarios in which a robot experienced either positive actions\n(such as being kissed), negative actions (such as being slapped) or neutral\nactions. After each video, the robot conveyed its emotional response through\nhaptic communication, delivered via a wearable vibration sleeve worn by the\nparticipant. Participants rated the robot's emotional state-its valence\n(positive or negative) and arousal (intensity)-based on the video, the haptic\nfeedback, and the combination of the two. The study reveals a dynamic interplay\nbetween visual context and touch. Participants' interpretation of haptic\nfeedback was strongly shaped by the emotional context of the video, with visual\ncontext often overriding the perceived valence of the haptic signal. Negative\nhaptic cues amplified the perceived valence of the interaction, while positive\ncues softened it. Furthermore, haptics override the participants' perception of\narousal of the video. Together, these results offer insights into how situated\nhaptic feedback can enrich affective human-robot interaction, pointing toward\nmore nuanced and embodied approaches to emotional communication with machines.",

    "abstract": "The growing reliance on power electronics introduces new challenges requiring\ndetailed time-domain analyses with fast and accurate circuit simulation tools.\nCurrently, commercial time-domain simulation software are mainly relying on\nphysics-based methods to simulate power electronics. Recent work showed that\ndata-driven and physics-informed learning methods can increase simulation speed\nwith limited compromise on accuracy, but many challenges remain before\ndeployment in commercial tools can be possible. In this paper, we propose a\nphysics-informed bidirectional long-short term memory neural network\n(BiLSTM-PINN) model to simulate the time-domain response of a closed-loop dc-dc\nboost converter for various operating points, parameters, and perturbations. A\nphysics-informed fully-connected neural network (FCNN) and a BiLSTM are also\ntrained to establish a comparison. The three methods are then compared using\nstep-response tests to assess their performance and limitations in terms of\naccuracy. The results show that the BiLSTM-PINN and BiLSTM models outperform\nthe FCNN model by more than 9 and 4.5 times, respectively, in terms of median\nRMSE. Their standard deviation values are more than 2.6 and 1.7 smaller than\nthe FCNN's, making them also more consistent. Those results illustrate that the\nproposed BiLSTM-PINN is a potential alternative to other physics-based or\ndata-driven methods for power electronics simulations.",

Additionally, we include the various lines to create a repeating pattern\nthat can be viewed as a wallpaper group if the angle set contains fewer than 3\nangles. There are 17 wallpaper groups up to isomorphism, so we determine which\nsuch groups can be constructed in this way, depending on the rotational and\nreflectional symmetries present in the given pattern. If the angle set contains\nmore than 4 angles, the resulting pattern will be dense and hence no longer a\nwallpaper group.

This leaves\nserial dictatorship (SD) as the only rule that avoids justified envy under\nstandard direct mechanisms. What if SD outcomes are undesirable from a\ndesigner's perspective? We propose visible fairness, which demands fairness\nrelative to the (potentially purposefully incomplete) preference information\nthe mechanism elicits.

    "abstract": "Sparse matrices and tensors are ubiquitous throughout multiple subfields of\ncomputing. The widespread usage of sparse data has inspired many in-memory and\non-disk storage formats, but the only widely adopted storage specifications are\nthe Matrix Market and FROSTT file formats, which both use ASCII text. Due to\nthe inefficiency of text storage, these files typically have larger file sizes\nand longer parsing times than binary storage formats, which directly store an\nin-memory representation to disk. This can be a major bottleneck; since sparse\ncomputation is often bandwidth-bound, the cost of loading or storing a matrix\nto disk often exceeds the cost of performing a sparse computation. While it is\ncommon practice for practitioners to develop their own, custom, non-portable\nbinary formats for high-performance sparse matrix storage, there is currently\nno cross-platform binary sparse matrix storage format. We present Binsparse, a\ncross-platform binary sparse matrix and tensor format specification. Binsparse\nis a modular, embeddable format, consisting of a JSON descriptor, which\ndescribes the matrix or tensor dimensions, type, and format, and a series of\nbinary arrays, which can be stored in all modern binary containers, such as\nHDF5, Zarr, or NPZ. We provide several reference implementations of Binsparse\nspanning 5 languages, 5 frameworks, and 4 binary containers. We evaluate our\nBinsparse format on every matrix in the SuiteSparse Matrix Collection and a\nselection of tensors from the FROSTT collection. The Binsparse HDF5 CSR format\nshows file size reductions of 2.4x on average without compression and 7.5x with\ncompression. We evaluate our parser's read/write performance against a\nstate-of-the-art Matrix Market parser, demonstrating warm cache mean read\nspeedups of 26.5x without compression and 2.6x with compression, and write\nspeedups of 31x without compression and 1.4x with compression.",

Time-resolved X-ray\nscattering is a powerful tool for imaging structural dynamics in molecules\nbecause of the strong scattering from the core electrons localized near each\nnucleus. Such core-electron contributions generally dominate the differential\nscattering signal, masking any signatures of rearrangement in the chemically\nimportant valence electrons. Ammonia represents an exception to the typically\nhigh core-to-valence electron ratio. We measured 9.8 keV X-ray scattering from\ngas-phase deuterated ammonia following photoexcitation via a 200 nm pump pulse\nto the 3s Rydberg state. We observed changes in the recorded scattering\npatterns due to the initial photoexcitation and subsequent deuterium\ndissociation. Ab initio calculations confirm that the observed signal is\nsensitive to the rearrangement of the single photoexcited valence electron as\nwell as the interplay between adiabatic and nonadiabatic dissociation channels.\nThe use of ultrafast hard X-ray scattering to image the structural\nrearrangement of single valence electrons constitutes an important advance in\ntracking valence electronic structure in photoexcited atoms and molecules.",

    "abstract": "Image registration is used in many medical image analysis applications, such\nas tracking the motion of tissue in cardiac images, where cardiac kinematics\ncan be an indicator of tissue health. Registration is a challenging problem for\ndeep learning algorithms because ground truth transformations are not feasible\nto create, and because there are potentially multiple transformations that can\nproduce images that appear correlated with the goal. Unsupervised methods have\nbeen proposed to learn to predict effective transformations, but these methods\ntake significantly longer to predict than established baseline methods. For a\ndeep learning method to see adoption in wider research and clinical settings,\nit should be designed to run in a reasonable time on common, mid-level\nhardware. Fast methods have been proposed for the task of image registration\nbut often use patch-based methods which can affect registration accuracy for a\nhighly dynamic organ such as the heart.\n  In this thesis, a fast, volumetric registration model is proposed for the use\nof quantifying cardiac strain. The proposed Deep Learning Neural Network (DLNN)\nis designed to utilize an architecture that can compute convolutions incredibly\nefficiently, allowing the model to achieve registration fidelity similar to\nother state-of-the-art models while taking a fraction of the time to perform\ninference. The proposed fast and lightweight registration (FLIR) model is used\nto predict tissue motion which is then used to quantify the non-uniform strain\nexperienced by the tissue. For acquisitions taken from the same patient at\napproximately the same time, it would be expected that strain values measured\nbetween the acquisitions would have very small differences.

    "abstract": "In this work, we present high-resolution spectroscopic observations for six\nmetal-poor stars with [Fe/H]<-3 (including one with [Fe/H]<-4), selected using\nnarrow-band Ca II HK photometry from the DECam MAGIC Survey. The spectroscopic\ndata confirms the accuracy of the photometric metallicities and allows for the\ndetermination of chemical abundances for 16 elements, from carbon to barium.\nThe program stars have chemical abundances consistent with this metallicity\nrange. A kinematic/dynamical analysis suggests that all program stars belong to\nthe distant Milky Way halo population (heliocentric distances 35 < dhelio/kpc <\n55), including three with high-energy orbits that might have been associated\nwith the Magellanic system and one, J0026-5445, having parameters consistent\nwith being a member of the Sagittarius stream. The remaining two stars show\nkinematics consistent with the Gaia-Sausage/Enceladus dwarf galaxy merger.\nJ0433-5548, with [Fe/H]=-4.12, is a carbon-enhanced ultra metal-poor star, with\n[C/Fe]=+1.73. This star is believed to be a bona fide second-generation star,\nand its chemical abundance pattern was compared with yields from metal-free\nsupernova models. Results suggest that J0433-5548 could have been formed from a\ngas cloud enriched by a single supernova explosion from a ~11Mo star in the\nearly universe. The successful identification of such objects demonstrates the\nreliability of photometric metallicity estimates, which can be used for target\nselection and statistical studies of faint targets in the Milky Way and its\nsatellite population. These discoveries illustrate the power of measuring\nchemical abundances of metal-poor Milky Way halo stars to learn more about\nearly galaxy formation and evolution.",

We use Prospector stellar population\nsynthesis software (Leja et al. 2017; Johnson & Leja 2017; Johnson et al. 2021)\nto model non-parametric star formation histories for 39 CL-AGN host galaxies.\nWe find that $43^{+13}_{-12}\\%$ of our gold sample CL-AGN at z < 0.15 are star\nforming, while $29^{+13}_{-10}\\%$ fall in the Green Valley of the stellar\nmass-sSFR diagram. At z > 0.15, $57^{+13}_{-18}\\%$ of CL-AGN in the gold sample\nare star-forming and $29^{+19}_{-14}\\%$ are in the Green Valley. CL-AGN hosts\nhave similar star formation properties to the host galaxies of Seyfert 1 and 2\nAGN at z < 0.15 and to Seyfert 2 AGN at z > 0.15. We find no statistically\nsignificant differences in the star formation properties of turn-on and\nturn-off CL-AGN. We also find no evidence for rapid quenching in the Green\nValley CL-AGN. We conclude that CL-AGN state transitions are not associated\nwith the formation history of CL-AGN host galaxies on large spatial scales,\nimplying CL-AGN state transitions may instead result from nuclear-scale or\naccretion disk effects.",

Through\nstructured JSON communication, these agents handle tasks including controller\nselection, scenario design, parameter optimization, performance evaluation, and\ndecision-making. Through an actor-critic optimization approach, the system\niteratively improves performance while progressing through scenarios of\nincreasing complexity to ensure robustness under nominal conditions,\nmeasurement noise, actuator disturbances, and parametric uncertainties. Key\ninnovations include structured multi-agent collaboration, robust optimization\nmechanisms, and real-time adaptability via in-context learning. Validated\nacross four diverse control systems, namely, DC Motor Position control, Ball\nand Beam, Inverted Pendulum, and Double Inverted Pendulum, the framework\nachieves competitive performance against classical methods. Its Full State\nFeedback solution closely matches Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) results,\nwhile the designed PID controller significantly outperforming MATLAB's\nPIDTuner, reducing PID tracking error by 55% through adaptive parameter\nexploration.

Building on the complex,\nholomorphic metric extension and contour-integration regularization of\nclassical singularities, we show that promoting the metric to a complex-valued\ntensor on a complex 4-fold enlarges the frame bundle to SO(4,C). Its spin\ndouble cover factorizes as a product of two independent SL(2,C) factors modulo\na shared Z\\_2, and selecting one Weyl factor recovers the familiar SL(2,C)/Z\\_2\nspin cover of the Lorentz group. By explicitly extending metric components and\nconnection forms into the complex domain, using contour deformations to avoid\ncoordinate-singular loci, we exhibit how left- and right-handed Weyl spinors\ntransform under separate SL(2,C) factors, and how modding out a common Z\\_2\nreproduces the standard spin-Lorentz structure. In particular, the same\ncontour-integration techniques that yield singularity-free Schwarzschild and\nKerr solutions via a holomorphic radial coordinate also furnish a holomorphic\nspin bundle in which chiral spin representations live without imposing exotic\nmatter or modifying the Einstein equations. This embedding clarifies the\ngeometric origin of chirality, enables holomorphic factorization of curvature\nand connection forms, and provides a foundation for constructing holomorphic\nfield theories and complexified gravity backgrounds.

We verify this by proving that $f(n) =\n\\left \\lfloor (n+1)/4 \\right \\rfloor$. The proof hinges on further proving that\nif $G$ is such a graph and $\\iota(G, P_3) = (n+1)/4$, then $\\iota(G-v, P_3) <\n\\iota(G, P_3)$ for each vertex $v$ of $G$. This new idea promises to be of\nfurther use. We also prove that if the maximum degree of such a graph $G$ is at\nleast $5$, then $\\iota(G,P_3) \\leq n/4$.",

The system is driven by an external periodic\nfield and includes dissipative processes.

Quenches in the potential height\nare used to demonstrate dynamical fragmentation of the droplet for repulsive\npotentials as well as self-evaporation along with droplet localization and\neventual relaxation for longer evolution times in the case of attractive\npotential wells. The many-body character of the dynamics is explicated by\nevaluating the participating single-particle eigenstates manifesting the\nsuperposition nature of the droplet state. Our results should be detectable by\ncurrent ultracold atom experiments and may inspire engineered droplet dynamics\nwith the aid of external potentials.",

Conventional deep learning approaches for analyzing\nthese signals typically rely on homogeneous datasets and static bespoke models,\nlimiting their robustness and generalizability across diverse clinical settings\nand acquisition protocols. In this study, we present a cardiac sensing\nfoundation model (CSFM) that leverages advanced transformer architectures and a\ngenerative, masked pretraining strategy to learn unified representations from\nvast, heterogeneous health records. Our model is pretrained on an innovative\nmulti-modal integration of data from multiple large-scale datasets (including\nMIMIC-III-WDB, MIMIC-IV-ECG, and CODE), comprising cardiac signals and the\ncorresponding clinical or machine-generated text reports from approximately 1.7\nmillion individuals.

Extensive evaluations across diagnostic\ntasks, demographic information recognition, vital sign measurement, clinical\noutcome prediction, and ECG question answering reveal that CSFM consistently\noutperforms traditional one-modal-one-task approaches.

Next,\nwe numerically implement this transformer and demonstrate in experiments the\nexact correspondence between our architecture and Lloyd's algorithm, providing\na fully neural implementation of $k$-means clustering.

The\nspatiotemporal co-occurrence of such effects further drives extreme anomalies\nin vegetation productivity and net land carbon storage. However, the impacts of\nclimate change on extremes in net biospheric production (NBP) over longer time\nperiods are unknown. Using the percentile threshold on the probability\ndistribution curve of NBP anomalies, we computed negative and positive extremes\nin NBP. Here we show that due to climate warming, about 88% of global regions\nwill experience a larger magnitude of negative NBP extremes than positive NBP\nextremes toward the end of 2100, which accelerate the weakening of the land\ncarbon sink. Our analysis indicates the frequency of negative extremes\nassociated with declines in biospheric productivity was larger than positive\nextremes, especially in the tropics. While the overall impact of warming at\nhigh latitudes is expected to increase plant productivity and carbon uptake,\nhigh-temperature anomalies increasingly induce negative NBP extremes toward the\nend of the 21st century. Using regression analysis, we found soil moisture\nanomalies to be the most dominant individual driver of NBP extremes. The\ncompound effect of hot, dry, and fire caused extremes at more than 50% of the\ntotal grid cells. The larger proportion of negative NBP extremes raises a\nconcern about whether the Earth is capable of increasing vegetation production\nwith growing human population and rising demand for plant material for food,\nfiber, fuel, and building materials. The increasing proportion of negative NBP\nextremes highlights the consequences of not only reduction in total carbon\nuptake capacity but also of conversion of land to a carbon source.",

    "abstract": "Large-scale 3D semantic scene generation has predominantly relied on\nvoxel-based representations, which are memory-intensive, bound by fixed\nresolutions, and challenging to edit. In contrast, primitives represent\nsemantic entities using compact, coarse 3D structures that are easy to\nmanipulate and compose, making them an ideal representation for this task. In\nthis paper, we introduce PrITTI, a latent diffusion-based framework that\nleverages primitives as the main foundational elements for generating\ncompositional, controllable, and editable 3D semantic scene layouts. Our method\nadopts a hybrid representation, modeling ground surfaces in a rasterized format\nwhile encoding objects as vectorized 3D primitives. This decomposition is also\nreflected in a structured latent representation that enables flexible scene\nmanipulation of ground and object components. To overcome the orientation\nambiguities in conventional encoding methods, we introduce a stable\nCholesky-based parameterization that jointly encodes object size and\norientation. Experiments on the KITTI-360 dataset show that PrITTI outperforms\na voxel-based baseline in generation quality, while reducing memory\nrequirements by up to $3\\times$. In addition, PrITTI enables direct\ninstance-level manipulation of objects in the scene and supports a range of\ndownstream applications, including scene inpainting, outpainting, and\nphoto-realistic street-view synthesis.",

    "abstract": "Are there any conditions under which a generative model's outputs are\nguaranteed not to infringe the copyrights of its training data? This is the\nquestion of \"provable copyright protection\" first posed by Vyas, Kakade, and\nBarak (ICML 2023). They define near access-freeness (NAF) and propose it as\nsufficient for protection. This paper revisits the question and establishes new\nfoundations for provable copyright protection -- foundations that are firmer\nboth technically and legally. First, we show that NAF alone does not prevent\ninfringement. In fact, NAF models can enable verbatim copying, a blatant\nfailure of copy protection that we dub being tainted. Then, we introduce our\nblameless copy protection framework for defining meaningful guarantees, and\ninstantiate it with clean-room copy protection. Clean-room copy protection\nallows a user to control their risk of copying by behaving in a way that is\nunlikely to copy in a counterfactual clean-room setting. Finally, we formalize\na common intuition about differential privacy and copyright by proving that DP\nimplies clean-room copy protection when the dataset is golden, a copyright\ndeduplication requirement.",

We investigated the\ncapabilities of early prompt injection detection systems, focusing specifically\non the detection performance of techniques implemented in various open-source\nsolutions.

    "abstract": "Ensuring robustness and resilience in intermodal transportation systems is\nessential for the continuity and reliability of global logistics. These systems\nare vulnerable to various disruptions, including natural disasters and\ntechnical failures. Despite significant research on freight transportation\nresilience, investigating the robustness of the system after targeted and\nclimate-change driven disruption remains a crucial challenge. Drawing on\nnetwork science methodologies, this study models the interdependencies within\nthe rail and water transport networks and simulates different disruption\nscenarios to evaluate system responses. We use the data from the US Department\nof Energy Volpe Center for network topology and tonnage projections. The\nproposed framework quantifies deliberate, stochastic, and climate driven\ninfrastructure failure, using higher resolution downscaled multiple Earth\nSystem Models simulations from Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase\nversion 6. We show that the disruptions of a few nodes could have a larger\nimpact on the total tonnage of freight transport than on network topology. For\nexample, the removal of targeted 20 nodes can bring the total tonnage carrying\ncapacity to 30 percent with about 75 percent of the rail freight network\nintact. This research advances the theoretical understanding of transportation\nresilience and provides practical applications for infrastructure managers and\npolicymakers. By implementing these strategies, stakeholders and policymakers\ncan better prepare for and respond to unexpected disruptions, ensuring\nsustained operational efficiency in the transportation networks.",

This paper\nintroduces an intelligent, multi-layered machine learning framework designed to\ndetect ARP spoofing in real-time IoT deployments. Our approach combines feature\nengineering based on ARP header behavior, traffic flow analysis, and temporal\npacket anomalies with a hybrid detection pipeline incorporating decision trees,\nensemble models, and deep learning classifiers.

The system is validated on both simulated IoT traffic and the\nCICIDS2017 dataset, achieving over 97% detection accuracy with low false\npositive rates.

    "abstract": "In their 1997 paper titled ``Fruit Salad\", Gy\\'{a}rf\\'{a}s posed the\nfollowing conjecture: there exists a constant $k$ such that if each path of a\ngraph spans a $3$-colourable subgraph, then the graph is $k$-colourable. It is\nnoted that $k=4$ might suffice. Let $r(G)$ be the maximum chromatic number of\nany subgraph $H$ of $G$ where $H$ is spanned by a path. The only progress on\nthis conjecture comes from Randerath and Schiermeyer in 2002, who proved that\nif $G$ is an $n$ vertex graph, then $\\chi(G) \\leq r(G)\\log_{\\frac{8}{7}}(n)$.\n  We prove that for all natural numbers $r$, there exists a graph $G$ with\n$r(G)\\leq r$ and $\\chi(G)\\geq \\lfloor\\frac{3r}{2}\\rfloor -1$. Hence, for all\nconstants $k$ there exists a graph with $\\chi - r > k$. Our proof is\nconstructive.\n  We also study this problem in graphs with a forbidden induced subgraph. We\nshow that if $G$ is $K_{1,t}$-free, for $t\\geq 4$, then $\\chi(G) \\leq\n(t-1)(r(G)+\\binom{t-1}{2}-3)$. If $G$ is claw-free, then we prove $\\chi(G) \\leq\n2r(G)$. Additionally, the graphs $G$ where every induced subgraph $G'$ of $G$\nsatisfy $\\chi(G') = r(G')$ are considered. We call such graphs path-perfect, as\nthis class generalizes perfect graphs. We prove that if $H$ is a forest with at\nmost $4$ vertices other than the claw, then every $H$-free graph $G$ has\n$\\chi(G) \\leq r(G)+1$. We also prove that if $H$ is additionally not isomorphic\nto $2K_2$ or $K_2+2K_1$, then all $H$-free graphs are path-perfect.",

    "abstract": "The cosmic time dilation observed in Type Ia supernova light curves suggests\nthat the passage of cosmic time varies throughout the evolution of the\nUniverse. This observation implies that the rate of proper time is not\nconstant, as assumed in the standard FLRW metric, but instead is\ntime-dependent. Consequently, the commonly used FLRW metric should be replaced\nby a more general framework, known as the Conformal Cosmology (CC) metric, to\nproperly account for cosmic time dilation. The CC metric incorporates both\nspatial expansion and time dilation during cosmic evolution. As a result, it is\nnecessary to distinguish between comoving and proper (physical) time, similar\nto the distinction made between comoving and proper distances. In addition to\nsuccessfully explaining cosmic time dilation, the CC metric offers several\nfurther advantages: (1) it preserves Lorentz invariance, (2) it maintains the\nform of Maxwell's equations as in Minkowski space-time, (3) it eliminates the\nneed for dark matter and dark energy in the Friedmann equations, and (4) it\nsuccessfully predicts the expansion and morphology of spiral galaxies in\nagreement with observations.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in AI weather forecasting have led to the emergence of\nso-called \"foundation models\", typically defined by expensive pretraining and\nminimal fine-tuning for downstream tasks. However, in the natural sciences, a\ndesirable foundation model should also encode meaningful statistical\nrelationships between the underlying physical variables. This study evaluates\nthe performance of the state-of-the-art Aurora foundation model in predicting\nhydrological variables, which were not considered during pretraining. We\nintroduce a lightweight approach using shallow decoders trained on the latent\nrepresentations of the pretrained model to predict these new variables. As a\nbaseline, we compare this to fine-tuning the full model, which allows further\noptimization of the latent space while incorporating new variables into both\ninputs and outputs. The decoder-based approach requires 50% less training time\nand 35% less memory, while achieving strong accuracy across various\nhydrological variables and preserving desirable properties of the foundation\nmodel, such as autoregressive stability. Notably, decoder accuracy depends on\nthe physical correlation between the new variables and those used during\npretraining, indicating that Aurora's latent space captures meaningful physical\nrelationships. In this sense, we argue that an important quality metric for\nfoundation models in Earth sciences is their ability to be extended to new\nvariables without a full fine-tuning. This provides a new perspective for\nmaking foundation models more accessible to communities with limited\ncomputational resources, while supporting broader adoption in Earth sciences.",

To address these challenges, we propose RareSpot, a\nrobust detection framework integrating multi-scale consistency learning and\ncontext-aware augmentation. Our multi-scale consistency approach leverages\nstructured alignment across feature pyramids, enhancing fine-grained object\nrepresentation and mitigating scale-related feature loss. Complementarily,\ncontext-aware augmentation strategically synthesizes challenging training\ninstances by embedding difficult-to-detect samples into realistic environmental\ncontexts, significantly boosting model precision and recall. Evaluated on an\nexpert-annotated prairie dog drone imagery benchmark, our method achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance, improving detection accuracy by over 35% compared\nto baseline methods. Importantly, it generalizes effectively across additional\nwildlife datasets, demonstrating broad applicability.

The eventual selection is performed by applying rules or\ndeliberations to the raw evaluations, and then deterministically selecting the\nitems deemed to be the best. These domains feature error-prone evaluations and\nuncertainty about future outcomes, which undermine the reliability of such\ndeterministic selection rules. As a result, selection mechanisms involving\nexplicit randomization that incorporate the uncertainty are gaining traction in\npractice. However, current randomization approaches are ad hoc, and as we\nprove, inappropriate for their purported objectives. In this paper, we propose\na principled framework for randomized decision-making based on interval\nestimates of the quality of each item. We introduce MERIT (Maximin Efficient\nRandomized Interval Top-k), an optimization-based method that maximizes the\nworst-case expected number of top candidates selected, under uncertainty\nrepresented by overlapping intervals (e.g., confidence intervals or min-max\nintervals). MERIT provides an optimal resource allocation scheme under an\ninterpretable notion of robustness. We develop a polynomial-time algorithm to\nsolve the optimization problem and demonstrate empirically that the method\nscales to over 10,000 items. We prove that MERIT satisfies desirable axiomatic\nproperties not guaranteed by existing approaches. Finally, we empirically\ncompare algorithms on synthetic peer review data.

The monomers considered here are anticipated to dissolve in the bulk\nflow and can be adsorbed at the interface of air-liquid as well.

The motivation behind this work is to extend the work of\nKarapetsas and Bontozoglou[1] for flow over a slippery bottom and in the\npresence of externally imposed shear forces and observe their impact on the\nflow dynamics. The Orr-Sommerfeld eigensystem is obtained, then it is solved\nanalytically using the longwave approximation method in the longwave regime ($k\n\\ll 1$) and subsequently, the Chebyshev spectral collocation method is employed\nfor numerical evaluation in the arbitrary wave regime.

We identify interlopers from other Milky Way (MW) structures,\nwhich amount to 22 percent of the total sample. Most interlopers are associated\nwith the halo, with the remainder linked to the Galactic disk. We confirm the\npreviously reported lag in the rotation curve of bulge RR~Lyrae stars\nregardless of the removal of interlopers. Metal-rich RR~Lyrae stars' rotation\npatterns are consistent with that of non-variable metal-rich giants, following\nthe MW bar, while metal-poor stars exhibit slower rotation. The analysis of\norbital parameter space is used to distinguish bulge stars that, in the bar\nreference frame, have prograde orbits from those in retrograde orbits. We\nclassify the prograde stars into orbital families and estimate the chaoticity\n(in the form of frequency drift) of their orbits. RR~Lyrae stars with\nbanana-like orbits have a bimodal distance distribution, similar to the\ndistance distribution seen in the metal-rich red clump stars. The fraction of\nstars with banana-like orbits decreases linearly with metallicity, as does the\nfraction of stars on prograde orbits (in the bar reference frame). The\nretrograde moving stars (in the bar reference frame) form a centrally\nconcentrated nearly spherical distribution. Analyzing an $N$-body+SPH\nsimulation, we find that some stellar particles in the central parts oscillate\nbetween retrograde and prograde orbits and only a minority stays prograde over\na long period of time. Based on the simulation, the ratio between prograde and\nretrograde stellar particles seems to stabilize within a couple of gigayears\nafter bar formation. The non-chaoticity of retrograde orbits and their high\nnumbers can explain some of the spatial and kinematical features of the MW\nbulge that have been often associated with a classical bulge.",

At the fine-grained level, token importance scores are employed\nto emphasize the most informative tokens from each teacher adaptively. At the\ncoarse-grained level, we summarize the knowledge from multiple teachers and\ntransfer it to the student using a set of general-knowledge LoRA adapters with\na router.

Heterogeneous architectures, combining specialized processing\nelements (PEs), have emerged as a key solution for achieving the required\nperformance and energy efficiency. However, optimizing energy while executing\napplications on these platforms requires efficiently managing platform\nresources like PEs, power features, and memory footprint, all while adhering to\ncritical application deadlines. This paper presents MEDEA, a novel design-time\nmulti-objective manager for energy-efficient DNN inference on Heterogeneous ULP\n(HULP) platforms. MEDEA uniquely integrates: kernel-level dynamic voltage and\nfrequency scaling (DVFS) for dynamic energy adaptation; kernel-level\ngranularity scheduling, suitable for specialized accelerators; memory-aware\nadaptive tiling to navigate severe memory constraints; and all within a timing\nconstraint-based optimization strategy, which minimizes energy based on\napplication deadline.

We confirm this behavior and show\nthat it persists when DESI BAO data are replaced by SH0ES $H_0$ measurements,\ndespite the known tension between these probes in the presence of CMB data. In\nboth cases, the constraints favor a transition from an early-time phantom-like\nphase to a late-time quintessence-like phase, with the crossing occurring at\ndifferent redshifts depending on the dataset combination. The probability that\na phantom divide line (PDL) crossing does not occur within the expansion\nhistory is excluded at significance levels ranging between\n$3.1\\sigma$-$5.2\\sigma$. To investigate whether the apparent PDL crossing is a\ngenuine feature preferred by the data or an artifact of the linear form of the\nCPL parametrization, we isolate the PDL crossing feature by introducing two\nmodified versions of CPL that explicitly forbid it: CPL${}_{>a_\\mathrm{c}}$ and\nCPL${}_{<a_\\mathrm{c}}$.

Three\ncommon methods--difference-in-coefficients (DIC), Kitagawa-Oaxaca-Blinder\n(KOB), and causal decomposition analysis (CDA)--share the same goal to identify\nsuch contributors but can produce divergent results depending on confounding\nand model assumptions. Despite these challenges, applied researchers lack clear\nguidance on selecting appropriate methods for different scenarios. Methods. We\nstart with a brief review of each method, assuming no unmeasured confounders.\nWe then move to two more realistic scenarios: 1) unmeasured confounders affect\nthe relationship between intermediate confounders and the mediator, and 2)\nunmeasured confounders affect the relationship between the mediator and the\noutcome. For each scenario, we generate simulated data, apply all three\nmethods, compare their estimates, and interpret the results using Directed\nAcyclic Graphs. Results. Under the assumption of no unmeasured confounders, the\nDIC approach is a simplistic method suitable only when no intermediate\nconfounders are present. The KOB decomposition is appropriate unless adjustment\nfor baseline covariates is necessary. When unmeasured confounding exists, the\nDIC method yields biased estimates in both scenarios, and all three methods\nproduce biased results in the second scenario. However, CDA, when paired with\nsensitivity analysis can help assess the robustness of its estimates.\nConclusions. We advise against using the DIC method, particularly, in\nobservational studies, as the assumptions of no intermediate confounders is\noften unrealistic.

While recent efforts have leveraged Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) to aid execution-free FL, these have primarily focused\non identifying faults in the system under test (SUT) rather than in the often\ncomplex system test code. However, the latter is also important as, in\npractice, many failures are triggered by faulty test code. To overcome these\nchallenges, we introduce a fully static, LLM-driven approach for system test\ncode fault localization (TCFL) that does not require executing the test case.\nOur method uses a single failure execution log to estimate the test's execution\ntrace through three novel algorithms that identify only code statements likely\ninvolved in the failure. This pruned trace, combined with the error message, is\nused to prompt the LLM to rank potential faulty locations. Our black-box,\nsystem-level approach requires no access to the SUT source code and is\napplicable to large test scripts that assess full system behavior. We evaluate\nour technique at function, block, and line levels using an industrial dataset\nof faulty test cases not previously used in pre-training LLMs. Results show\nthat our best estimated trace closely match actual traces, with an F1 score of\naround 90%. Additionally, pruning the complex system test code reduces the\nLLM's inference time by up to 34% without any loss in FL performance.

    "abstract": "Geological data show that, early in its history, the Earth had a large-scale\nmagnetic field with an amplitude comparable to that of the present geomagnetic\nfield. However, its origin remains enigmatic and various mechanisms have been\nproposed to explain the Earth's field over geological time scales. Here, we\ncritically evaluate whether tidal forcing could explain the early Earth's\ngeodynamo, by combining constraints from geophysical models of the Earth-Moon\nsystem and predictions from rotating turbulence studies. We show that the\nMoon's tides could be strong enough before $-3.25$ Gy to trigger turbulence in\nthe Earth's core, and possibly dynamo action in the mean time. Then, we propose\nnew scaling laws for the magnetic field amplitude $B$. We show that $B \\propto\n\\beta^{4/3}$, where $\\beta$ is the typical equatorial ellipticity of the liquid\ncore, if the turbulence involves weak interactions of three-dimensional\ninertial waves. Otherwise, we would expect $B \\propto \\beta$ if the amplitude\nof tidal forcing were strong enough. When extrapolated to the Earth's core, it\nsuggests that tidal forcing alone was too weak to possibly explain the ancient\npaleomagnetic field. Therefore, our study indirectly favours another origin for\nthe early Earth's geodynamo on long time scales (e.g. the exsolution of light\nelements atop the core, or thermal convection due to secular cooling).",

    "abstract": "We consider the problem of online dynamic mechanism design for sequential\nauctions in unknown environments, where the underlying market and, thus, the\nbidders' values vary over time as interactions between the seller and the\nbidders progress. We model the sequential auctions as an infinite-horizon\naverage-reward Markov decision process (MDP), where the transition kernel and\nreward functions are unknown to the seller. In each round, the seller\ndetermines an allocation and a payment for each bidder. Each bidder receives a\nprivate reward and submits a sealed bid to the seller. The state, which\nrepresents the underlying market, evolves according to an unknown transition\nkernel and the seller's allocation policy. Unlike existing works that formulate\nthe problem as a multi-armed bandit model or as an episodic MDP, where the\nenvironment resets to an initial state after each round or episode, our paper\nconsiders a more realistic and sophisticated setting in which the market\ncontinues to evolve without restarting. We first extend the\nVickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism, which is known to be efficient,\ntruthful, and individually rational for one-shot static auctions, to sequential\nauctions, thereby obtaining a dynamic VCG mechanism counterpart that preserves\nthese desired properties. We then focus on the online setting and develop an\nonline reinforcement learning algorithm for the seller to learn the underlying\nMDP model and implement a mechanism that closely resembles the dynamic VCG\nmechanism. We show that the learned online mechanism asymptotically converges\nto a dynamic mechanism that approximately satisfies efficiency, truthfulness,\nand individual rationality with arbitrarily high probability and achieves\nguaranteed performance in terms of various notions of regret.",

The jet splitting momentum\nfraction ($z_g$) and the groomed jet mass to the ungroomed jet transverse\nmomentum ($M_g / p_{T,\\text{jet}}$) are reconstructed using the Soft Drop\nalgorithm with two grooming parameter settings.

    "abstract": "Water ice is a fundamental building material of comets and other bodies in\nthe outer solar system. Yet, the properties of cometary water ice are\nchallenging to study, due to its volatility and the typical distances at which\ncomets are observed. Cometary outbursts, impulsive mass-loss events that can\nliberate large amounts of material, offer opportunities to directly observe and\ncharacterize cometary water ice. We present a study of comet 243P/NEAT,\ninstigated by a $-3$ mag outburst that occurred in December 2018. Optical\nimages and a 251-day lightcurve were examined to characterize the outburst and\nthe comet's quiescent activity. Variations in the quiescent lightcurve appear\nto be dominated by coma asymmetries, rather than changing activity levels as\nthe comet approached and receded from the Sun. Furthermore, the lightcurve\nshows evidence for 1 to 2 additional small outbursts ($-0.3$ mag) occurring in\nSeptember 2018. The large December 2018 outburst likely ejected water ice\ngrains, yet no signatures of ice were found in color photometry, a color map,\nnor a near-infrared spectrum. We discuss possible dynamical and thermal reasons\nfor this non-detection. In this context, we examined the comae of comets\n103P/Hartley 2 and C/2013 US$_{10}$ (Catalina), and show that a one-to-one\nmapping between continuum color and the presence of water ice cannot be\nsupported. We also discuss possible causes for the large outburst, and find\nthat there is an apparent grouping in the kinetic energy per mass estimates for\nthe outbursts of 5 comets.",

By\ncontrolling reciprocal-space occupancy, we investigate the dynamics of\nlocalized states and wavepackets, observing refocusing behavior, breathing\nmodes modulated by reciprocal-space discretizations, and wavepacket\ntrajectories that reflect the underlying topology.

It enables the\ncreation of synthetic data that preserves real-world characteristics while\naddressing key challenges such as data scarcity, privacy concerns, and purity\nconstraints associated with real data. In this survey, we provide a\ncomprehensive review of synthetic network traffic generation approaches,\ncovering essential aspects such as data types, generation models, and\nevaluation methods. With the rapid advancements in AI and machine learning, we\nfocus particularly on deep learning-based techniques while also providing a\ndetailed discussion of statistical methods and their extensions, including\ncommercially available tools. Furthermore, we highlight open challenges in this\ndomain and discuss potential future directions for further research and\ndevelopment.

We\ncharacterize the dynamics of minority islands of spins surrounded by a large\nbackground of spins pointing in the opposite direction. We show that in the\nbistable phase, the minority islands are always reabsorbed by the surrounding\nat a constant velocity, irrespectively of their size.

We aim to assess the presence of a coherent satellite plane around\nNGC 2750 by identifying new candidate dwarf galaxies and low surface brightness\nfeatures. We conducted deep, wide-field photometric observations of NGC 2750\nusing the Large Binocular Telescope in the g- and r-bands. Standard data\nreduction techniques were applied to enhance the detection of\nlow-surface-brightness features down to about 31 mag/arcsec^2 in r. Our\nobservations led to the discovery of six new candidate dwarf galaxies,\nincluding one with properties consistent with an ultra-diffuse galaxy. We also\nidentified tidal features around NGC 2750, indicating past interactions with\nnearby satellites. The spatial distribution of satellites suggests a moderate\nflattening, further supported by the newly identified candidates. Follow-up\nspectroscopic measurements will be critical in confirming or challenging the\nstrong kinematic coherence observed previously. The luminosity function of NGC\n2750 reveals an excess of bright satellites compared to similar systems, adding\nto the growing tension between observed satellite populations and cosmological\nsimulations.",

The\nsecond is that the basic result of nudging (that for $H$ small enough and\n$\\chi$ large enough predictability horizons are infinite) holds for one variant\nof the modular algorithm. The third is that, for any $H>0$ and any $\\chi>0$,\none step of the modular algorithm decreases the next step's error and increases\n(an estimate of) predictability horizons. A method synthesizing assimilation\nwith eddy viscosity models of turbulence is also presented. Numerical tests are\ngiven, confirming the effectiveness of the modular assimilation algorithm.

This paper develops\nthe formalism much further, including showing how the 0A and 0B choices\nfamiliar in continuum approaches have a direct analogue in terms of building\nsolutions of the appropriate string equations. This also illuminates several\nkey differences between the 0A and 0B models at the level of matrix model loop\nobservables.

While interventions across multiple domains are increasingly proposed,\nthere is limited guidance on appropriate methods for evaluating their\neffectiveness. To address this gap, we develop an extended causal decomposition\nanalysis that simultaneously targets multiple causally ordered intervening\nfactors, allowing for the assessment of their synergistic effects.

As an evolved subgiant star, this target\nhas p-mode oscillations that are larger in amplitude (4-8 m/s) and occur on\nlonger timescales (80 min.) than those of typical Sun-like stars of RV surveys,\nmagnifying their corresponding effects on the stellar spectral profile. We show\nthat for HD 142091, p-mode oscillations manifest primarily as pure Doppler\nshifts in the average line profile -- measured by the cross-correlation\nfunction (CCF) -- with \"shape-driven\" CCF variations as a higher-order effect.\nSpecifically, we find that the amplitude of the shift varies across the CCF\nbisector, with 10% larger oscillation amplitudes closer to the core of the CCF,\nand 25% smaller oscillation amplitudes for bisector velocities derived near the\nwings; we attribute this trend to larger oscillation velocities higher in the\nstellar atmosphere. Using a line-by-line analysis, we verify that a similar\ntrend is seen as a function of average line depth, with deeper lines showing\nlarger oscillation amplitudes. Finally, we find no evidence that p-mode\noscillations have a chromatic dependence across the NEID bandpass beyond that\ndue to intrinsic line depth differences across the spectrum.",

Despite their importance, current methods for measuring LyA\nabsorption cannot directly derive the intrinsic quasar continuum and make\nstrong assumptions on its shape, thus distorting the measured LyA clustering.\nWe present SpenderQ, a ML-based approach for directly reconstructing the\nintrinsic quasar spectra and measuring the LyA forest from observations.\nSpenderQ uses the Spender spectrum autoencoder to learn a compact and\nredshift-invariant latent encoding of quasar spectra, combined with an\niterative procedure to identify and mask absorption regions. To demonstrate its\nperformance, we apply SpenderQ to 400,000 synthetic quasar spectra created to\nvalidate the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Year 1 LyA cosmological\nanalyses. SpenderQ accurately reconstructs the true intrinsic quasar spectra,\nincluding the broad LyB, LyA, SiIV, CIV, and CIII emission lines.

While asteroseismic\nobservations have recently enabled detailed probing of CHeB star interiors,\nseismic signatures related to structural variations at the boundary between the\nconvective and radiative core, and chemical composition gradients within the\nradiative core remain underexplored. This paper investigates how such gradients\naffect the oscillation modes of low-mass CHeB stars, focusing on mixed dipole\nmodes and uncoupled g-modes as diagnostic tools. Using semi-analytical models\ncalibrated with the evolutionary codes $\\texttt{BaSTI-IAC}$,$ \\texttt{CLES}$,\nand $\\texttt{MESA}$, we examine the impact of density discontinuities and\nassociated structural glitches on mode period spacings. These codes span\ndiverse physical prescriptions, allowing us to isolate robust features relevant\nfor calibration. Our approach enables controlled glitch insertion while\npreserving a realistic representation of the star. Consistent with prior works,\nwe find that structural glitches introduce periodic components in the period\nspacings, providing constraints on the location and amplitude of interior\nvariations. We compare models with smooth and sharp transitions, demonstrating\nhow glitch sharpness affects period spacing and mode trapping. Simulations\nbased on four-year $\\textit{Kepler}$ data show that our models yield\noscillation frequencies closely matching observations.

We use cosmological `zoom-in' simulations of three massive galaxy\nhaloes ($M_{\\rm{200c}} = 10^{12.5-13}$M$_\\odot$), each simulated with and\nwithout magnetic fields. The fraction of gas retained after infall through the\nCGM across our full satellite sample shows no population-wide impact of\nmagnetic fields on ram pressure stripping.

Magnetic\nfields reduce turbulent mixing, significantly inhibiting the dispersion of\nmetals into the host CGM. This suppressed mixing greatly reduces condensation\nfrom the host CGM onto the stripped tail. By studying the magnetic field\nstructure, we find evidence of magnetic draping and attribute differences in\nthe stripping rate to the draping layer. Differences in condensation from the\nhost CGM are attributed to magnetic field lines aligned with the tail\nsuppressing turbulent mixing. We simulate one halo with enhanced resolution in\nthe CGM and show these results are converged with resolution, though the\nstructure of the cool gas in the tail is not.

The lepton number violation by heavy RHN\nalso induces a one-loop Majorana mass of $\\nu_R$ rendering the light neutrinos\nto be Majorana fermions. Successful leptogenesis constrain the parameter space\nin terms of RHN mass and axion decay constant. This has interesting\nconsequences for both ALP and QCD axion DM parameter space within reach of\nseveral ongoing and near future experiments. We also propose a Dirac version of\nthis scenario without any total lepton number violation. This leads to a\nlong-lived asymmetric Dirac fermion contributing partially to DM thereby\nopening up more parameter space for ALP. In addition to axion search\nexperiments, the proposed scenarios can have observable signatures at cosmic\nmicrowave background (CMB), DM search as well as terrestrial particle physics\nexperiments.",

    "abstract": "Active, low-mass stars are widely observed to have radii that are larger than\npredicted by standard stellar models. Proposed mechanisms for this radius\ninflation generally involve stellar magnetism, either in the form of added\npressure support in the outer layers and/or suppression of convection via\nstarspots. We have assembled a large sample of 261 low-mass stars in the young\nclusters Upper Scorpius, $\\alpha$ Persei, Pleiades, and Praesepe (spanning ages\n10--670 Myr) for which the data exist to empirically measure the stellar radii,\nrotation periods, and starspot covering fractions. We find a clear, strong\nrelationship between the degree of radius inflation and stellar rotation as\nrepresented by the Rossby number; this inflation-rotation relationship bears\nstriking resemblance to canonical activity-rotation relationships, including\nboth the so-called linear and saturated regimes. We also demonstrate here for\nthe first time that the radius inflation depends directly on the starspot\ncovering fraction. We furthermore find that the stars' effective temperatures\ndecrease with decreasing Rossby number as well, and that this temperature\nsuppression balances the radius inflation so as to preserve the stellar\nbolometric luminosity. These relationships are consistent across the age range\nsampled here, which spans from the pre--main-sequence to the zero-age main\nsequence. The favorable comparison of our findings to the predictions of modern\nstarspot-based stellar evolution models suggests that, while rotation is\nclearly the underlying driver, magnetism may be the most likely direct cause of\nthe radius inflation phenomenon.",

We demonstrate that due to the\ninterplay of superexchange and Hund's coupling, the system can be in a\nhigh-spin, low-spin or spin-gapped state. The low-spin state has singlets\nacross the bilayer in the $d_{z^2}$ orbital, with charge carriers in the\n$d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital. Thus, at low energy scales, it behaves as an effective\none band system when hole doped. By contrast, the high-spin state is a more\nrobust, spin-1 antiferromagnet. Using Hartree-Fock methods, we find that for\nfixed interaction strength and doping, high-spin magnetism remains more robust\nthan the low-spin counterpart.

    "abstract": "The unique atomic monolayer structure of graphene gives rise to a broad range\nof remarkable mechanical folding properties. However, significant challenges\nremain in effectively harnessing them in a controllable and scalable manner. In\nthis study, we introduce an innovative approach that employs micron-scale\ncavities, fabricated through ultrafast laser patterning, in a stretchable\npolymer substrate to locally modulate adhesion and strain transfer to a\ngraphene monolayer. This technique enables the deterministic induction of\nsingle folds in graphene with fold dimensions, width and height in the hundreds\nof nanometers, tunable through the geometry of the polymer cavities and the\napplied strain. Importantly, these folds are reversible, returning to a flat\nmorphology with minimal structural damage, as confirmed by Raman spectroscopy.\nAdditionally, our method allows for the creation of fields of folds with\nreproducible periodicity, defining clear potential for practical applications.\nThese findings pave the way for the development of advanced devices that would\nleverage the strain and morphology-sensitive properties of graphene.",

Such\nFD fluctuations are referred to as \"Faraday complexity\", and can unveil\nsmall-scale magneto-ionic structures in both the synchrotron-emitting and the\nforeground volumes. We explore the astrophysical origin of the Faraday\ncomplexity exhibited by 191 polarised extragalactic radio sources (EGSs) within\n5 deg from the Galactic plane in the longitude range of 20-52 deg, using\nbroadband data from the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array presented by a previous\nwork. A new parameter called the FD spread is devised to quantify the spatial\nFD fluctuations. We find that the FD spread of the EGSs (i) demonstrates an\nenhancement near the Galactic mid-plane, most notable within Galactic latitude\nof +-3 deg, (ii) exhibits hints of modulations across Galactic longitude, (iii)\ndoes not vary with the source size across the entire range of 2.5\"-300\", and\n(iv) has an amplitude higher than expected from magneto-ionic structures of\nextragalactic origin. All these suggest that the primary cause of the Faraday\ncomplexity exhibited by our target EGSs is <2.5\"-scale magneto-ionic structures\nin the Milky Way. We argue that the anisotropic turbulent magnetic field\ngenerated by galactic-scale shocks and shears, or the stellar feedback-driven\nisotropic turbulent magnetic field, are the most likely candidates.

In this work, we show how\nthe \\textit{quantum many-body bootstrap} framework, specifically the reduced\ndensity matrix (RDM) bootstrap, can be leveraged to obtain rigorous lower\nbounds on the superfluid stiffness in frustration-free interacting models with\nsuperconducting ground state. We numerically apply the method to a special\nclass of frustration free models, which are known as quantum geometric nesting\nmodels, for flat-band superconductivity, where we uncover a general relation\nbetween the stiffness and the pair mass. Going beyond the familiar Hubbard case\nwithin this class, we find how additional interactions, notably simple magnetic\ncouplings, can enhance the superfluid stiffness. Furthermore, the RDM bootstrap\nunexpectedly reveals that the trion-type correlations are essential for\nbounding the stiffness, offering new insights on the structure of these models.\nA straightforward generalization of the method can lead to bounds on\nsusceptibilities that are complementary to variational approaches.

However, scalable\nfabrication of locally addressable devices in these materials remains\nchallenging. Here, we demonstrate an efficient fabrication approach by\npatterning narrow constrictions in a superconducting KTaO3-based\nheterostructure. The constrictions are individually tunable via the coplanar\nside gates formed within the same 2DEG plane. Our technique leverages the high\ndielectric permittivity of KTaO3 (epsilon_r ~ 5000) to achieve strong\nelectrostatic modulation of the superconducting 2DEG. Transport measurements\nthrough the constriction reveal a range of transport regimes: Within the\nsuperconducting state, we demonstrate efficient modulation of the critical\ncurrent and Berezinskii Kosterlitz Thouless (BKT) transition temperature at the\nweak link. Further tuning of the gate voltage reveals an unexpectedly regular\nCoulomb blockade pattern. All of these states are achievable with a side gate\nvoltage |V_SG| < 1 V.

Recent efforts have\nextensively explored EEG-based brain foundation models for generalized brain\ndecoding, employing large-scale training on multiple datasets. However, most of\nthese attempts struggle with generalizability and fail to achieve satisfactory\nperformance without task-specific tuning due to pronounced inherent\nheterogeneity among decoding tasks. To address these challenges, we present\nUniMind, a general-purpose EEG foundation model for unified multi-task brain\ndecoding by uniquely unleashing the power of large language models to\ncomprehend complex neural patterns. UniMind offers several advantages. First,\nwe design a Neuro-Language Connector to bridge the modality gap between neural\nsignals and large language models, distilling and transforming the\nspatiotemporal neural patterns of EEG data into representations understandable\nby language models. Second, a Task-aware Query Selection module is proposed to\ninject task-awareness into the cross-modal alignment by dynamically generating\ntask-adaptive query tokens, enabling learning of task-relevant neural patterns\nacross diverse tasks. Extensive experiments across ten datasets demonstrate\nthat UniMind substantially outperforms state-of-the-art multi-task decoding\nmodels, with an average gain of 12 percent, while also offering valuable\nneuroscientific insights into neural functional correlations across tasks.

But this overlooks a fundamental shift in how transport\nphenomena and reaction kinetics interact. In filament CVD, the filament is not\njust a substrate; it is the dominant heat source and flow disruptor all in one.\nIn this work, we ask: What really governs Si film growth on filaments? Using a\nvalidated three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model, we show\nthat filament geometry, thermal gradients, and flow-induced buoyancy do not\nmerely affect uniformity -- they define the very regimes (reaction-limited,\ntransition, diffusion-limited) in which deposition occurs. Our model, validated\nagainst three independent experimental studies (R-squared = 0.969), reveals how\ntemperature, flow rate, and reactor layout fundamentally shift the growth\ndynamics. We show that reducing filament diameter from 2 mm to 500 microns does\nnot just increase local surface area -- it can triple growth rates (up to\napproximately 39 microns per minute), but only in carefully tuned\nhigh-temperature regimes. Similarly, multi-filament setups do not simply scale\ndeposition, they reshape flow fields and compound thermal asymmetries,\nsometimes improving uniformity, other times worsening it. These effects are not\nevident without modeling the interplay between transport and kinetics,\nsomething experiments alone cannot resolve. To bridge physical understanding\nwith design actionability, we apply global sensitivity analysis via Polynomial\nChaos Expansion (PCE) and Sobol indices. These reveal how in reaction-limited\nregimes, temperature dominates; in diffusion-limited regimes, reactant\ntransport takes over.",

    "abstract": "This work examines whether activating latent subspaces in language models\n(LLMs) can steer scientific code generation toward a specific programming\nlanguage. Five causal LLMs were first evaluated on scientific coding prompts to\nquantify their baseline bias among four programming languages. A static\nneuron-attribution method, perturbing the highest activated MLP weight for a\nC++ or CPP token, proved brittle and exhibited limited generalization across\nprompt styles and model scales. To address these limitations, a\ngradient-refined adaptive activation steering framework (G-ACT) was developed:\nper-prompt activation differences are clustered into a small set of steering\ndirections, and lightweight per-layer probes are trained and refined online to\nselect the appropriate steering vector. In LLaMA-3.2 3B, this approach reliably\nbiases generation towards the CPP language by increasing the average probe\nclassification accuracy by 15% and the early layers (0-6) improving the probe\nclassification accuracy by 61.5% compared to the standard ACT framework. For\nLLaMA-3.3 70B, where attention-head signals become more diffuse, targeted\ninjections at key layers still improve language selection. Although per-layer\nprobing introduces a modest inference overhead, it remains practical by\nsteering only a subset of layers and enables reproducible model behavior.

    "abstract": "Aligning the rhythm of visual motion in a video with a given music track is a\npractical need in multimedia production, yet remains an underexplored task in\nautonomous video editing. Effective alignment between motion and musical beats\nenhances viewer engagement and visual appeal, particularly in music videos,\npromotional content, and cinematic editing. Existing methods typically depend\non labor-intensive manual cutting, speed adjustments, or heuristic-based\nediting techniques to achieve synchronization. While some generative models\nhandle joint video and music generation, they often entangle the two\nmodalities, limiting flexibility in aligning video to music beats while\npreserving the full visual content. In this paper, we propose a novel and\nefficient framework, termed MVAA (Music-Video Auto-Alignment), that\nautomatically edits video to align with the rhythm of a given music track while\npreserving the original visual content. To enhance flexibility, we modularize\nthe task into a two-step process in our MVAA: aligning motion keyframes with\naudio beats, followed by rhythm-aware video inpainting. Specifically, we first\ninsert keyframes at timestamps aligned with musical beats, then use a\nframe-conditioned diffusion model to generate coherent intermediate frames,\npreserving the original video's semantic content. Since comprehensive test-time\ntraining can be time-consuming, we adopt a two-stage strategy: pretraining the\ninpainting module on a small video set to learn general motion priors, followed\nby rapid inference-time fine-tuning for video-specific adaptation. This hybrid\napproach enables adaptation within 10 minutes with one epoch on a single NVIDIA\n4090 GPU using CogVideoX-5b-I2V as the backbone. Extensive experiments show\nthat our approach can achieve high-quality beat alignment and visual\nsmoothness.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in applications requiring\nlong context lengths, but the key-value (KV) cache often becomes a memory\nbottleneck on GPUs as context grows. To address this, we propose Commutative\nVector Quantization (CommVQ) to significantly reduce memory usage for\nlong-context LLM inference. We first introduce additive quantization with a\nlightweight encoder and codebook to compress the KV cache, which can be decoded\nvia simple matrix multiplication. To further reduce computational costs during\ndecoding, we design the codebook to be commutative with Rotary Position\nEmbedding (RoPE) and train it using an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm.\nThis enables efficient integration of decoding into the self-attention\nmechanism. Our approach achieves high accuracy with additive quantization and\nlow overhead via the RoPE-commutative codebook. Experiments on long-context\nbenchmarks and GSM8K show that our method reduces FP16 KV cache size by 87.5%\nwith 2-bit quantization, while outperforming state-of-the-art KV cache\nquantization methods.

Direct bulk\ndensity measurements for sub-millimeter to millimeter-sized meteoroids are\ndifficult, often relying on forward modeling without robust uncertainty\nestimates. Methods based solely on select observables can overlook\nnoise-induced biases and non-linear relations between physical parameters. This\nstudy aims to automate the inversion of meteoroid physical parameters from\noptical meteor data, focusing on bulk density and its associated uncertainties.\nWe compare an observables-based selection method (PCA) with an RMSD-based\napproach used to select among millions of ablation model runs using full light\nand deceleration curves as constraints. After validating both approaches on six\nsynthetic test cases, we apply them to two Perseid meteors recorded by high\nsensitivity Electron-Multiplied CCD (EMCCD) cameras and high precision\nmirror-tracked meteors detected by the Canadian Automated Meteor Observatory\n(CAMO). Our results show that relying only on observables, as in the PCA\napproach can converge to wrong solutions and can yield unphysical solutions. In\ncontrast, the RMSD-based method offers more reliable density constraints,\nparticularly for bright and strongly decelerating meteor. Small relative\nmeasurement precision in brightness and lag relative to the full range of\nobserved lag and luminosity is the key to tight solution.

    "abstract": "In this work, we introduce OmniGen2, a versatile and open-source generative\nmodel designed to provide a unified solution for diverse generation tasks,\nincluding text-to-image, image editing, and in-context generation. Unlike\nOmniGen v1, OmniGen2 features two distinct decoding pathways for text and image\nmodalities, utilizing unshared parameters and a decoupled image tokenizer. This\ndesign enables OmniGen2 to build upon existing multimodal understanding models\nwithout the need to re-adapt VAE inputs, thereby preserving the original text\ngeneration capabilities. To facilitate the training of OmniGen2, we developed\ncomprehensive data construction pipelines, encompassing image editing and\nin-context generation data. Additionally, we introduce a reflection mechanism\ntailored for image generation tasks and curate a dedicated reflection dataset\nbased on OmniGen2. Despite its relatively modest parameter size, OmniGen2\nachieves competitive results on multiple task benchmarks, including\ntext-to-image and image editing. To further evaluate in-context generation,\nalso referred to as subject-driven tasks, we introduce a new benchmark named\nOmniContext. OmniGen2 achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source\nmodels in terms of consistency. We will release our models, training code,\ndatasets, and data construction pipeline to support future research in this\nfield.

    "abstract": "Machine learning (ML) models are proving to be vulnerable to a variety of\nattacks that allow the adversary to learn sensitive information, cause\nmispredictions, and more. While these attacks have been extensively studied,\ncurrent research predominantly focuses on analyzing each attack type\nindividually. In practice, however, adversaries may employ multiple attack\nstrategies simultaneously rather than relying on a single approach. This\nprompts a crucial yet underexplored question: When the adversary has multiple\nattacks at their disposal, are they able to mount or amplify the effect of one\nattack with another? In this paper, we take the first step in studying the\nstrategic interactions among different attacks, which we define as attack\ncompositions. Specifically, we focus on four well-studied attacks during the\nmodel's inference phase: adversarial examples, attribute inference, membership\ninference, and property inference. To facilitate the study of their\ninteractions, we propose a taxonomy based on three stages of the attack\npipeline: preparation, execution, and evaluation. Using this taxonomy, we\nidentify four effective attack compositions, such as property inference\nassisting attribute inference at its preparation level and adversarial examples\nassisting property inference at its execution level. We conduct extensive\nexperiments on the attack compositions using three ML model architectures and\nthree benchmark image datasets. Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness\nof these four attack compositions. We implement and release a modular reusable\ntoolkit, COAT. Arguably, our work serves as a call for researchers and\npractitioners to consider advanced adversarial settings involving multiple\nattack strategies, aiming to strengthen the security and robustness of AI\nsystems.",

However, the bandwidth of these links is limited, and thus,\npresents challenges to the applicability of CF-mMIMO, especially with an\never-increasing number of users. To address this, we propose a method based on\nvariational Bayesian (VB) inference for performing the JED process, where the\nAPs forward low-resolution quantized versions of the signals to the CPU. We\nconsider two approaches: \\emph{quantization-and-estimation} (Q-E) and\n\\emph{estimation-and-quantization} (E-Q). In the Q-E approach, each AP uses a\nlow-bit quantizer to quantize the signal before forwarding it to the CPU, while\nin the E-Q approach, each AP first performs local channel estimation and then\nsends a low-bit quantized version of the estimated channel to the CPU. We\nevaluate the performance of our VB-based approach under perfect fronthaul link\n(PFL) with unquantized received signals, Q-E, and E-Q in terms of symbol error\nrate (SER), normalized mean square error (NMSE) of the channel estimation,\ncomputational complexity, and fronthaul signaling overhead. We also compare\nthese results with those of the linear minimum mean squared error (LMMSE)\nmethod under the PFL scenario. Our numerical results show that both the VB(Q-E)\nand VB(E-Q) approaches achieve superior performance compared to LMMSE(PFL),\nbenefiting from the nonlinear modeling inherent in VB. Furthermore, the VB(Q-E)\nmethod outperforms VB(E-Q) due to errors in the local channel estimation\nprocess at the APs within the VB(E-Q) approach.",

Evaluations were conducted on 50,000+ image patches from diverse\nscanners (Hamamatsu, Philips, Leica Aperio AT2) across multiple sites. The FMA\nachieved the highest patch-wise AUROC of 0.995 (95% CI [0.994, 0.995]),\noutperforming the ResNet50-based method (AUROC: 0.977, 95% CI [0.977, 0.978])\nand the KBA (AUROC: 0.940, 95% CI [0.933, 0.946]). To translate detection into\nactionable insights, we developed a quality report scorecard that quantifies\nhigh-quality patches and visualizes artifact distributions.",

While the groundbreaking\nwork of Agol et al.

We solve this fundamental\nlimitation through two complementary mathematical approaches: (1)\nRiemann-Liouville fractional calculus operators that naturally handle\nnon-integer powers through exact integral representations, and (2) a continuous\ndifferential equation framework that generalizes discrete polynomial recursions\nto arbitrary real exponents. Our method provides exact analytical expressions\nfor all half-integer powers ($\\alpha = k/2$) essential for 4-term limb\ndarkening law by Claret (2000), maintains machine precision even at geometric\ncontact points where numerical methods fail, and preserves the computational\nspeed advantages crucial for parameter fitting. We demonstrate that the\nsquare-root limb darkening ($\\alpha = 1/2$) favored by recent stellar\natmosphere studies can now be computed analytically with the same efficiency as\ntraditional quadratic models, achieving 10--100$\\times$ speed improvements over\nnumerical integration while providing exact analytical derivatives.",

    "abstract": "Angular dispersion (AD) is a ubiquitous phenomenon in optics after light\ntraverses a diffractive or dispersive device, whereby each wavelength\npropagates at a different angle. AD is useful in a variety of applications; for\nexample, modifying the group velocity or group-velocity dispersion of pulsed\nlasers in free space or optical materials, which are essential ingredients in\ngroup-velocity matching and dispersion compensation. Conventional optical\ncomponents introduce `differentiable' AD, so that the propagation angle can be\nexpanded perturbatively around a fixed frequency, in which only a few low\nAD-orders are typically relevant. However, this model does not encompass newly\nemerging classes of propagation-invariant pulsed optical fields, such as\n`space-time wave packets', which incorporate a new form of AD that we call\n`non-differentiable AD'. This is a surprising feature: there exists a frequency\nat which the derivative of the propagation angle with respect to frequency is\nnot defined. Consequently, the propagation angle cannot be expanded\nperturbatively at this frequency, and a large number of independently\ncontrollable AD orders are needed to approximate this condition. Synthesizing\nthese new AD-induced field configurations requires constructing a `universal AD\nsynthesizer' capable of accessing the magnitude and sign of any AD order, a\ncapability missing from any single optical component to date. This Perspective\narticle provides a unified schema for studying differentiable and\nnon-differentiable AD, shows that non-differentiable AD enables circumventing\nmany well-established constraints in optics -- thereby giving rise to new\napplications, and outlines the requirements for a universal AD synthesizer\ncapable of producing both forms of AD.",

This decreases from 45 $R_{\\rm g}$ to 9 $R_{\\rm\ng}$ during the transition from the hard to hard intermediate and then soft\nintermediate state.

The overall slope\nof the observed trend is in strong agreement with the predictions of LT\nprecession, despite the complexities of accretion behavior, though there is an\noffset in absolute value which may indicate that the system parameters are\nstill not well determined. The inner radius of the hot flow is consistent with\na constant value throughout most of the outburst, indicating that changes in\nthe jet (e.g. the discrete ejections) do not strongly affect the radiated\npower.

These reduced state dynamics approaches rely on high-quality\ndata and struggle with highly sparse spatiotemporal noisy measurements\ntypically obtained from experiments. Furthermore, there is no guarantee that\nthese models satisfy governing physical conservation laws, especially for\nparameters that are not a part of the model learning process. In this article,\nwe propose a reduced state dynamics approach, which we refer to as ECLEIRS,\nthat satisfies conservation laws exactly even for parameters unseen in the\nmodel training process. ECLEIRS is demonstrated for two applications: 1)\nobtaining clean solution signals from sparse and noisy measurements of\nparametric systems, and 2) predicting dynamics for unseen system parameters.

    "abstract": "The recent work by Shojaee et al. (2025), titled The Illusion of Thinking:\nUnderstanding the Strengths and Limitations of Reasoning Models via the Lens of\nProblem Complexity, presents a compelling empirical finding, a reasoning cliff,\nwhere the performance of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) collapses beyond a\nspecific complexity threshold, which the authors posit as an intrinsic scaling\nlimitation of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. This commentary, while\nacknowledging the study's methodological rigor, contends that this conclusion\nis confounded by experimental artifacts. We argue that the observed failure is\nnot evidence of a fundamental cognitive boundary, but rather a predictable\noutcome of system-level constraints in the static, text-only evaluation\nparadigm, including tool use restrictions, context window recall issues, the\nabsence of crucial cognitive baselines, inadequate statistical reporting, and\noutput generation limits. We reframe this performance collapse through the lens\nof an agentic gap, asserting that the models are not failing at reasoning, but\nat execution within a profoundly restrictive interface. We empirically\nsubstantiate this critique by demonstrating a striking reversal. A model,\ninitially declaring a puzzle impossible when confined to text-only generation,\nnow employs agentic tools to not only solve it but also master variations of\ncomplexity far beyond the reasoning cliff it previously failed to surmount.\nAdditionally, our empirical analysis of tool-enabled models like o4-mini and\nGPT-4o reveals a hierarchy of agentic reasoning, from simple procedural\nexecution to complex meta-cognitive self-correction, which has significant\nimplications for how we define and measure machine intelligence. The illusion\nof thinking attributed to LRMs is less a reasoning deficit and more a\nconsequence of an otherwise capable mind lacking the tools for action.",

    "abstract": "Offline Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning seeks to train agents to\nreach specified goals from previously collected trajectories. Scaling that\npromises to long-horizon tasks remains challenging, notably due to compounding\nvalue-estimation errors. Principled geometric offers a potential solution to\naddress these issues. Following this insight, we introduce Projective\nQuasimetric Planning (ProQ), a compositional framework that learns an\nasymmetric distance and then repurposes it, firstly as a repulsive energy\nforcing a sparse set of keypoints to uniformly spread over the learned latent\nspace, and secondly as a structured directional cost guiding towards proximal\nsub-goals. In particular, ProQ couples this geometry with a Lagrangian\nout-of-distribution detector to ensure the learned keypoints stay within\nreachable areas. By unifying metric learning, keypoint coverage, and\ngoal-conditioned control, our approach produces meaningful sub-goals and\nrobustly drives long-horizon goal-reaching on diverse a navigation benchmarks.",

    "abstract": "Ultra-long generation by large language models (LLMs) is a widely demanded\nscenario, yet it remains a significant challenge due to their maximum\ngeneration length limit and overall quality degradation as sequence length\nincreases. Previous approaches, exemplified by LongWriter, typically rely on\n''teaching'', which involves supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on synthetic\nlong-form outputs. However, this strategy heavily depends on synthetic SFT\ndata, which is difficult and costly to construct, often lacks coherence and\nconsistency, and tends to be overly artificial and structurally monotonous. In\nthis work, we propose an incentivization-based approach that, starting entirely\nfrom scratch and without relying on any annotated or synthetic data, leverages\nreinforcement learning (RL) to foster the emergence of ultra-long, high-quality\ntext generation capabilities in LLMs. We perform RL training starting from a\nbase model, similar to R1-Zero, guiding it to engage in reasoning that\nfacilitates planning and refinement during the writing process. To support\nthis, we employ specialized reward models that steer the LLM towards improved\nlength control, writing quality, and structural formatting. Experimental\nevaluations show that our LongWriter-Zero model, trained from Qwen2.5-32B,\nconsistently outperforms traditional SFT methods on long-form writing tasks,\nachieving state-of-the-art results across all metrics on WritingBench and\nArena-Write, and even surpassing 100B+ models such as DeepSeek R1 and\nQwen3-235B.

Nonetheless, the generalization capability of\nvisuomotor policies remains limited, especially when small demonstration\ndatasets are available. Accumulated errors in visuomotor policies significantly\nhinder their ability to complete long-horizon tasks. To address these\nlimitations, we propose SViP, a framework that seamlessly integrates visuomotor\npolicies into task and motion planning (TAMP). SViP partitions human\ndemonstrations into bimanual and unimanual operations using a semantic scene\ngraph monitor. Continuous decision variables from the key scene graph are\nemployed to train a switching condition generator. This generator produces\nparameterized scripted primitives that ensure reliable performance even when\nencountering out-of-the-distribution observations. Using only 20 real-world\ndemonstrations, we show that SViP enables visuomotor policies to generalize\nacross out-of-distribution initial conditions without requiring object pose\nestimators. For previously unseen tasks, SViP automatically discovers effective\nsolutions to achieve the goal, leveraging constraint modeling in TAMP\nformulism. In real-world experiments, SViP outperforms state-of-the-art\ngenerative IL methods, indicating wider applicability for more complex tasks.\nProject website: https://sites.google.com/view/svip-bimanual",

As a\nconsequence, Markovian models are insufficient for capturing the folding\ndynamics, as quantified by the MSD and the MFPT, even when including\ncoordinate-dependent friction.

Our results reveal that it is not just the\nsequence itself, but its specific arrangement that influences DNA stability. We\nexamine two types of DNA sequences containing a block of either AT or GC\nbase-pairs, resulting in the formation of a large bubble or a smaller bubble\nwithin the DNA, respectively. By systematically shifting these blocks along the\nstrand, we investigate how their positioning influences the force-temperature\nphase diagram of DNA. Our Brownian dynamics simulations reveal that, at high\nforces, melting of the entire DNA strand is initiated after stretching $\\approx\n9$ GC base-pairs, independent of the specific base-pair sequence. In contrast,\nno such characteristic length scale is observed in the Gaussian network model.\nOur study suggests that free strand entropy plays a significant role in\ndetermining the force-temperature phase diagram of the DNA.",

However, the inter-shell\nangular correlation exhibits sharp peaks at irregular angular intervals in fMD\nwhich are not seen in LD indicating strongly correlated motion of the two\nspherical shells in the cluster in fMD. The single particle dynamics of the\ncluster is characterized by the Van - Hove self autocorrelation function and\nMean Squared Displacement (MSD). Notably, the Van - Hove autocorrelation\nfunction in fMD simulations exhibits narrower width and higher peak height as\ncompared to the LD simulations, suggesting greater particle mobility in LD.\nTrajectory analysis reveals a rotational motion of the particles about a common\naxis in fMD which disappears with progressively increasing friction\ncoefficient.

The\ninitial angular separation speed of the two components was estimated to 30 mas\nd^{-1}. We respectively fitted a single circular Gaussian model component to\neach of 14 sliced visibility datasets. For the case of including only European\nbaselines, during the final hour of the EVN observation, the fitted sizes\nexhibited linear expansion, indicating that the measured sizes were dominated\nby the angular separation of the two components. The 6-h EVN observation took\nplace in a rising phase of an even larger 4-day-long radio flare, implying that\nthe ejection events were quite frequent and therefore continuous radio\nmonitoring is necessary to correctly estimate the power of the transient jet.\nCombined with X-ray monitoring data, the radio quenching and subsequent\nflares/ejections were likely driven by instabilities in the inner hot accretion\ndisk.",

We analyze this solution under\ngravitational perturbations and find that it exhibits a single-peak potential.\nFor this case, no echoes are produced. Furthermore, we consider the massive\ncase of the three-form fields by introducing a Stueckelberg field to restore\ngauge invariance and to investigate its effect on GWs at late times. In this\ncase, the potential exhibits a double-peak structure, with the modified\npotential appearing beside the gravitational perturbation potential. We also\nexamine the impact of the relevant parameters as well as the influence of the\nparameter $c_0$, which arises from the equation of motion of the Stueckelberg\nfield. For a large value of $a_1$, the two peaks of the potentials are close\ntogether, while $c_0$ affects the amplitude and decay rate of the time-domain\nwaveform, resulting in no echoes. For small values of $a_1$, the peaks of the\npotentials are widely separated and $c_0$ influences both the phase and the\namplitude of the echoes. In addition, the quasinormal frequencies of the black\nhole are also calculated using both the WKB and Prony methods.

    "abstract": "Physics-informed deep learning has achieved remarkable progress by embedding\ngeometric priors, such as Hamiltonian symmetries and variational principles,\ninto neural networks, enabling structure-preserving models that extrapolate\nwith high accuracy. However, in systems with dissipation and holonomic\nconstraints, ubiquitous in legged locomotion and multibody robotics, the\ncanonical symplectic form becomes degenerate, undermining the very invariants\nthat guarantee stability and long-term prediction. In this work, we tackle this\nfoundational limitation by introducing Presymplectification Networks (PSNs),\nthe first framework to learn the symplectification lift via Dirac structures,\nrestoring a non-degenerate symplectic geometry by embedding constrained systems\ninto a higher-dimensional manifold. Our architecture combines a recurrent\nencoder with a flow-matching objective to learn the augmented phase-space\ndynamics end-to-end. We then attach a lightweight Symplectic Network (SympNet)\nto forecast constrained trajectories while preserving energy, momentum, and\nconstraint satisfaction. We demonstrate our method on the dynamics of the\nANYmal quadruped robot, a challenging contact-rich, multibody system. To the\nbest of our knowledge, this is the first framework that effectively bridges the\ngap between constrained, dissipative mechanical systems and symplectic\nlearning, unlocking a whole new class of geometric machine learning models,\ngrounded in first principles yet adaptable from data.",

Existing literature\non improving efficiency mainly adheres to the before-reasoning paradigms such\nas prompting and reasoning or fine-tuning and reasoning, but ignores the\npromising direction of directly encouraging the model to speak concisely by\nintervening during the generation of reasoning. In order to fill the blank, we\npropose a framework dubbed ConciseHint, which continuously encourages the\nreasoning model to speak concisely by injecting the textual hint (manually\ndesigned or trained on the concise data) during the token generation of the\nreasoning process. Besides, ConciseHint is adaptive to the complexity of the\nquery by adaptively adjusting the hint intensity, which ensures it will not\nundermine model performance. Experiments on the state-of-the-art LRMs,\nincluding DeepSeek-R1 and Qwen-3 series, demonstrate that our method can\neffectively produce concise reasoning processes while maintaining performance\nwell.

By exploiting the special one-dimensional structure (even if only\npartially present) of the problem, the proposed FICA incorporates a set of\nstrong valid inequalities to accelerate the solution process. We prove that\nFICA achieves the same optimality as the well-known conditional value-at-risk\n(CVaR) inner convex approximation method. Our numerical experiments demonstrate\nthat the proposed FICA can yield 40x computational speedup compared to CVaR,\nand can even reach up to 500x speedup when the optimisation horizon exceeds 16\ntime steps. This speedup is achieved when only 50% of constraints in a WJCC\nhave the one-dimensional structure. The approximation quality is numerically\nverified to be the same as CVaR, and the quality gap is below 1% when compared\nto the computationally demanding exact reformulation of the LHS-WJCC in most\ncases.

However, current methods isolate\nassociation and similarity analysis of drug and microbe, lacking effective\ninter-view optimization and coordinated multi-view feature fusion. In our\nstudy, a multi-view Divergence-Convergence Feature Augmentation framework for\nDrug-related Microbes Prediction (DCFA_DMP) is proposed, to better learn and\nintegrate association information and similarity information. In the divergence\nphase, DCFA_DMP strengthens the complementarity and diversity between\nheterogeneous information and similarity information by performing Adversarial\nLearning method between the association network view and different similarity\nviews, optimizing the feature space. In the convergence phase, a novel\nBidirectional Synergistic Attention Mechanism is proposed to deeply synergize\nthe complementary features between different views, achieving a deep fusion of\nthe feature space. Moreover, Transformer graph learning is alternately applied\non the drug-microbe heterogeneous graph, enabling each drug or microbe node to\nfocus on the most relevant nodes. Numerous experiments demonstrate DCFA_DMP's\nsignificant performance in predicting drug-microbe associations. It also proves\neffectiveness in predicting associations for new drugs and microbes in cold\nstart experiments, further confirming its stability and reliability in\npredicting potential drug-microbe associations.",

We evaluate CACE\nusing realistic workloads that include both latency-sensitive code completion\nand throughput-intensive code reasoning tasks.

    "abstract": "Word cloud use is a popular text visualization technique that scales font\nsizes based on word frequencies within a defined spatial layout. However,\ntraditional word clouds disregard semantic relationships between words,\narranging them without considering their meanings. Semantic word clouds\nimproved on this by positioning related words in proximity; however, still\nstruggled with efficient space use and representing frequencies through font\nsize variations, which can be misleading because of word length differences.\nThis paper proposes StoryGem, a novel text visualization approach that\naddresses these limitations.

Furthermore, this paper proposes an optimization problem to\nmaximize the font size within the regions of a Voronoi treemap.

Despite large-scale success, there remain significant\nchallenges including their reliance on extensive computational and memory\nresources for pre-training on huge datasets as well as difficulties in\ntask-specific transfer learning. These limitations coupled with energy\ninefficiencies mainly arise due to the computation-intensive self-attention\nmechanism. To address these issues, we propose a novel Super-Pixel Based Patch\nPooling (SPPP) technique that generates context-aware, semantically rich, patch\nembeddings to effectively reduce the architectural complexity and improve\nefficiency. Additionally, we introduce the Light Latent Attention (LLA) module\nin our pipeline by integrating latent tokens into the attention mechanism\nallowing cross-attention operations to significantly reduce the time and space\ncomplexity of the attention module.

This targeted attention improves\ntraining efficiency and accelerates convergence. Notably, the SPPP module is\nlightweight and can be easily integrated into existing transformer\narchitectures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed architecture\nprovides significant improvements in terms of computational efficiency while\nachieving comparable results with the state-of-the-art approaches, highlighting\nits potential for energy-efficient transformers suitable for edge deployment.\n(The code is available on our GitHub repository:\nhttps://github.com/zser092/Focused-Attention-ViT).",

At the core of this\nimportant robotic field is shape servoing, a task focused on controlling\ndeformable objects into desired shapes. The shape servoing formulation requires\nthe specification of a goal shape. However, most prior works in shape servoing\nrely on impractical goal shape acquisition methods, such as laborious\ndomain-knowledge engineering or manual manipulation. DefGoalNet previously\nposed the current state-of-the-art solution to this problem, which learns\ndeformable object goal shapes directly from a small number of human\ndemonstrations. However, it significantly struggles in multi-modal settings,\nwhere multiple distinct goal shapes can all lead to successful task completion.\nAs a deterministic model, DefGoalNet collapses these possibilities into a\nsingle averaged solution, often resulting in an unusable goal. In this paper,\nwe address this problem by developing DefFusionNet, a novel neural network that\nleverages the diffusion probabilistic model to learn a distribution over all\nvalid goal shapes rather than predicting a single deterministic outcome. This\nenables the generation of diverse goal shapes and avoids the averaging\nartifacts. We demonstrate our method's effectiveness on robotic tasks inspired\nby both manufacturing and surgical applications, both in simulation and on a\nphysical robot. Our work is the first generative model capable of producing a\ndiverse, multi-modal set of deformable object goals for real-world robotic\napplications.",

In this paper, we propose Programming by\nBackprop (PBB) as a potential driver of this effect - teaching a model to\nevaluate a program for inputs by training on its source code alone, without\never seeing I/O examples. To explore this idea, we finetune LLMs on two sets of\nprograms representing simple maths problems and algorithms: one with source\ncode and I/O examples (w/ IO), the other with source code only (w/o IO). We\nfind evidence that LLMs have some ability to evaluate w/o IO programs for\ninputs in a range of experimental settings, and make several observations.\nFirstly, PBB works significantly better when programs are provided as code\nrather than semantically equivalent language descriptions. Secondly, LLMs can\nproduce outputs for w/o IO programs directly, by implicitly evaluating the\nprogram within the forward pass, and more reliably when stepping through the\nprogram in-context via chain-of-thought. We further show that PBB leads to more\nrobust evaluation of programs across inputs than training on I/O pairs drawn\nfrom a distribution that mirrors naturally occurring data. Our findings suggest\na mechanism for enhanced reasoning through code training: it allows LLMs to\ninternalise reusable algorithmic abstractions. Significant scope remains for\nfuture work to enable LLMs to more effectively learn from symbolic procedures,\nand progress in this direction opens other avenues like model alignment by\ntraining on formal constitutional principles.",

It constructs embedded keys as physical layer fingerprints\nfor lightweight identification and designs a joint transceiver that integrates\nBDs' backscatter waveform with receiver functionality to mitigate interference\nfrom ambient RF signals by exploiting repeated patterns in OFDM symbols. Based\non this, a challenge-response authentication procedure is introduced to enable\nlow-complexity fingerprint exchange between two paired BDs leveraging channel\ncoherence, while securing the exchange process using a random number and\nunpredictable channel fading. Additionally, we optimize the authentication\nprocedure for high-mobility scenarios, completing exchanges within the channel\ncoherence time to minimize the impact of dynamic channel fluctuations. Security\nanalysis confirms its resistance against impersonation, eavesdropping, replay,\nand counterfeiting attacks.

Additionally, we explore the emission\nproperties of these systems under incoherent excitation of the emitters,\nemploying a general theoretical framework for open cavity-QED systems, which is\nvalid across all light-matter interaction regimes and preserves gauge\ninvariance within truncated Hilbert spaces. Furthermore, we study the influence\nof the emitter-environment interaction on the spectral properties of the\nsystem. Specifically, when each emitter interacts independently with its own\nreservoir, we observe the emergence of an emission peak at the cavity's\nresonant frequency for even values of $N$. Our analysis also clarify the\nevolution of the system as the number of emitters increases, ultimately\nconverging towards an equivalent system composed of two interacting single-mode\nbosonic fields.",

However, in practice, the\nmanifold is typically unknown and only noisy samples are available. A\nfundamental approach to uncovering the manifold structure is local averaging,\nwhich is a cornerstone of state-of-the-art provable methods for manifold\nfitting and denoising. However, to the best of our knowledge, there are no\nworks that rigorously analyze the accuracy of local averaging in a manifold\nsetting in high-noise regimes. In this work, we provide theoretical analyses of\na two-round mini-batch local averaging method applied to noisy samples drawn\nfrom a $d$-dimensional manifold $\\mathcal M \\subset \\mathbb{R}^D$, under a\nrelatively high-noise regime where the noise size is comparable to the reach\n$\\tau$.

One\neffective way to assess this effect is to get an accurate picture of the\npopulation of planet-hosting binaries and compare its characteristics to that\nof field star binaries. We construct an extensive database, collected from\nintensive literature exploration, to achieve a complete census of all\nplanet-hosting binaries known to date. Despite the heterogeneous character of\nthe different surveys this database is built on, and the biases and selection\neffects that unavoidably affect any sample of planet-hosting binaries, we look\nfor statistically significant trends and correlations within our sample. Our\ndatabase provides the characteristics for 759 systems (among which 31\ncircumbinaries), which is an increase by a factor of 9 with respect to the\nprevious complete census of planet-hosting binaries. Of the 728 S-type systems,\n651 are binaries, 73 are triples and 4 are quadruples. The raw distribution of\nplanet-hosting binary separations peaks around 500\\,au instead of 50\\,au for\nfield binaries. By analyzing the distribution of on-sky angular separations as\na function of distance $d_b$ to the systems we argue that the observed deficit\nof planet-hosting close-in binaries cannot be explained solely by observational\nbiases. Likewise, by exploring how multiplicity fractions among planet-hosts\nvary with $d_b$ we suggest that the subsample of known planet-hosting binaries\nat $<500\\,$pc is not bias-dominated (but not bias-free). In this $<500\\,$pc\ndomain, the multiplicity fraction of planet-hosting stars is $\\sim22.5\\%$,\napproximately half of the value for field stars, and the deficit of\nplanet-hosting binaries extends to separations of $\\sim500\\,$au, giving an\napproximate estimate of the detrimental effect binarity has on planet-formation",

The aim of this work is to show that\nincorporating heterogeneous chlorine chemistry into a global 3D model of\nMartian photochemistry with conventional gas-phase chemistry can reproduce\nspatial and temporal changes in hydrogen chloride on Mars. We incorporated this\nheterogeneous chlorine scheme into the MPCM to model chlorine photochemistry\nduring MYs 34 and 35.

We also examined correlations in the model\nresults between HCl and other key atmospheric quantities, as well as production\nand loss processes, to understand the impact of different factors driving\nchanges in HCl. We find that this 3D model of Martian is consistent with the\nchanges in HCl observed by ACS in MY 34 and MY 35, including detections and 70%\nof non-detections. For the remaining 30%, model HCl is higher than the ACS\ndetection limit due to biases associated with water vapour, dust, or water ice\ncontent at these locations. As with previous 1D model calculations, we find\nthat heterogeneous chemistry is required to describe the loss of HCl, resulting\nin a lifetime of a few sols that is consistent with the observed seasonal\nvariation in HCl. As a result of this proposed chemistry, modelled HCl is\ncorrelated with water vapour, airborne dust, and temperature, and\nanticorrelated with water ice.

Our waveform mismatch\nanalysis demonstrates that the use of three-image templates significantly\nimproves our ability to distinguish source signals, reducing mismatches from\n$O(10^{-1})$ to $O(10^{-2})$, typically by factors between 1.5 and 5 compared\nto the standard two-image template model. At lens masses above $10^7 \\,\nM_\\odot$, diffraction effects become negligible for ground-based detectors,\nresulting in an additional mismatch reduction by a factor of approximately\nthree. These findings highlight the critical need for multi-image templates in\nGW searches to enhance detection efficiency and accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Smartphone location data have transformed urban mobility research, providing\nunprecedented insights into how people navigate and interact in cities.\nHowever, leveraging location data at scale presents methodological challenges.\nAccurately identifying individuals' home and work locations is critical for a\nrange of applications, including commuting analysis, unemployment estimation,\nand urban accessibility studies. Despite their widespread use, home-work\ndetection methods lack a standardized framework that accounts for differing\ndata quality and that is validated against ground-truth observations. This\nlimits the comparability and reproducibility of results across studies and\ndatasets. In this paper, we present HoWDe, a robust algorithm for identifying\nhome and work locations from mobility data, explicitly designed to handle\nmissing data and varying data quality across individuals. Using two unique\nground-truth datasets comprising over 5100 individuals from more than 80\ncountries, HoWDe achieves home and work detection accuracies of up to 97% and\n88%, respectively, with consistent performance across countries and demographic\ngroups. We examine how parameter choices shape the trade-off between accuracy\nand user retention, and demonstrate how these methodological decisions\ninfluence downstream applications such as employment estimation and commuting\npattern analysis. By supporting in-house pre-processing through a transparent\nand validated pipeline, HoWDe also facilitates the sharing of\nprivacy-preserving mobility data. Together, our tools and findings establish\nmethodological standards that support more robust, scalable, and reproducible\nmobility research at both individual and urban scales.",

The success of the No-U-Turn\nSampler (NUTS) largely stems from its clever local adaptation of the\nintegration time in Hamiltonian Monte Carlo via a geometric U-turn condition.\nHowever, posterior distributions frequently exhibit multi-scale geometries with\nextreme variations in scale, making it necessary to also adapt the leapfrog\nintegrator's step size locally and dynamically. Despite its practical\nimportance, this problem has remained largely open since the introduction of\nNUTS by Hoffman and Gelman (2014). To address this issue, we introduce the\nWithin-orbit Adaptive Leapfrog No-U-Turn Sampler (WALNUTS), a generalization of\nNUTS that adapts the leapfrog step size at fixed intervals of simulated time as\nthe orbit evolves. At each interval, the algorithm selects the largest step\nsize from a dyadic schedule that keeps the energy error below a user-specified\nthreshold. Like NUTS, WALNUTS employs biased progressive state selection to\nfavor states with positions that are further from the initial point along the\norbit. Empirical evaluations on multiscale target distributions, including\nNeal's funnel and the Stock-Watson stochastic volatility time-series model,\ndemonstrate that WALNUTS achieves substantial improvements in sampling\nefficiency and robustness compared to standard NUTS.",

The quasibound state frequencies are\ncomputed analytically, and we examine their dependence on the scalar field's\nmass and charge, as well as on the black hole's mass and electric charge.

This specific black hole metric\narises as a solution to the low-energy effective action of string theory in\n$2+1$ dimensions, and it holds potential for experimental realization in analog\ngravity systems due to the similarity between its surface gravity and that of\nacoustic analogs.

M-11761-12705 is a massive galaxy with a stellar mass of\nlog(M_star/M_sun) = 11.6; the masses of four other galaxies are moderate: 10.1\n< log($M_star/M_sun) < 10.4.

The histogram for the spaxel abundances\ndemonstrates two distinct peaks, the difference between the (O/H)_h and the\n(O/H)_l abundances are of 0.06 - 0.08 dex. The high-metallicity regions are\nlocated in the O/H - N/O diagram closer to the lower envelope of the band than\nthe low-metallicity regions. The abundance properties in the massive galaxy can\nbe explained by the low-metallicity gas infall onto the galaxy and subsequent\nstarburst in the diluted interstellar gas. For moderate-mass galaxies, the\nhigher oxygen abundance in the high-metallicity region and its shift towards\nthe lower envelope in the N/O -- O/H diagram compared to the low-metallicity\nregion can be explained in one of two ways: either the starburst in the\nhigh-metallicity region occurred several dozens of Myr ago, or the star\nformation in the galaxy is accompanied by galactic winds, and the region\nevolved with the lower efficiency of the enriched galactic winds shows higher\nmetallicity. Two galaxies of our sample are members of galaxy pairs.

It is\ninteresting to observe that, with increasing distance between the detectors and\nthe boundary, the boundary tends to suppress quantum steering in one direction\nwhile enhancing it in the opposite direction. In the case of identical\ndetectors, steering is symmetric when they are aligned parallel to the\nboundary. However, orthogonal alignment breaks this symmetry due to their\nunequal spatial proximity to the boundary. For non-identical detectors in the\nparallel configuration, the steering from $A$ to $B$ ($A \\rightarrow B$)\ngenerally surpasses that from $B$ to $A$ ($B \\rightarrow A$). In contrast, when\nthe detectors are oriented orthogonally to the boundary, the relative strength\nof $A \\rightarrow B$ and $B \\rightarrow A$ steerability depends on the\ninterplay between the boundary effects and the detectors' energy gap\ndifference. Across most of the parameter space, the orthogonal alignment tends\nto enhance $B \\rightarrow A$ steering while suppressing $A \\rightarrow B$\nsteering compared to the parallel setup. These findings suggest that boundary\nconfigurations should be flexibly adjusted according to the directional\ndependence of steering harvesting in order to optimize quantum information\nextraction.",

    "abstract": "One common critique of biometric authentication is that if an individual's\nbiometric is compromised, then the individual has no recourse. The concept of\nrevocable biometrics was developed to address this concern. A biometric scheme\nis revocable if an individual can have their current enrollment in the scheme\nrevoked, so that the compromised biometric template becomes worthless, and the\nindividual can re-enroll with a new template that has similar recognition\npower. We show that modern deep CNN face matchers inherently allow for a robust\nrevocable biometric scheme. For a given state-of-the-art deep CNN backbone and\ntraining set, it is possible to generate an unlimited number of distinct face\nmatcher models that have both (1) equivalent recognition power, and (2)\nstrongly incompatible biometric templates. The equivalent recognition power\nextends to the point of generating impostor and genuine distributions that have\nthe same shape and placement on the similarity dimension, meaning that the\nmodels can share a similarity threshold for a 1-in-10,000 false match rate. The\nbiometric templates from different model instances are so strongly incompatible\nthat the cross-instance similarity score for images of the same person is\ntypically lower than the same-instance similarity score for images of different\npersons. That is, a stolen biometric template that is revoked is of less value\nin attempting to match the re-enrolled identity than the average impostor\ntemplate. We also explore the feasibility of using a Vision Transformer (ViT)\nbackbone-based face matcher in the revocable biometric system proposed in this\nwork and demonstrate that it is less suitable compared to typical ResNet-based\ndeep CNN backbones.",

One candidate for the generating mechanism is preferential\nattachment which, in its simplest form, results in a degree distribution that\nfollows the power law. Consequently, the growth of real-life networks that\nroughly display such power-law behaviour is commonly modelled by preferential\nattachment. However, the validity of the power law has been challenged by the\npresence of alternatives with comparable performance, as well as the recent\nfindings that the right tail of the degree distribution is often lighter than\nimplied by the body, whilst still being heavy. In this paper, we study a\nmodified version of the model with a flexible preference function that allows\nsuper/sub-linear behaviour whilst also guaranteeing that the limiting degree\ndistribution has a heavy tail.

Furthermore, when the query point cloud is noisy or has\nbeen transformed (e.g., rotated), it adds to the complexity.

    "abstract": "Despite extensive research on piezoelectric polymers since the discovery of\npiezoelectric poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) in 1969, the fundamental physics\nof polymer piezoelectricity has remained elusive. Based on the classic\nprinciple of piezoelectricity, polymer piezoelectricity should originate from\nthe polar crystalline phase. Surprisingly, the crystal contribution to the\npiezoelectric strain coefficient d31 is determined to be less than 10%,\nprimarily owing to the difficulty in changing the molecular bond lengths and\nbond angles. Instead, >85% contribution is from Poisson's ratio, which is\nclosely related to the oriented amorphous fraction (OAF) in uniaxially\nstretched films of semicrystalline ferroelectric (FE) polymers. In this\nperspective, the semicrystalline structure-piezoelectric property relationship\nis revealed using PVDF-based FE polymers as a model system. In melt-processed\nFE polymers, the OAF is often present and links the crystalline lamellae to the\nisotropic amorphous fraction. Molecular dynamics simulations demonstrate that\nthe electrostrictive conformation transformation of the OAF chains induces a\npolarization change upon the application of either a stress (the direct\npiezoelectric effect) or an electric field (the converse piezoelectric effect).\nMeanwhile, relaxor-like secondary crystals in OAF (SCOAF), which are favored to\ngrow in the extended-chain crystal (ECC) structure, can further enhance the\npiezoelectricity. However, the ECC structure is difficult to achieve in PVDF\nhomopolymers without high-pressure crystallization. We have discovered that\nhigh-power ultrasonication can effectively induce SCOAF in PVDF homopolymers to\nimprove its piezoelectric performance. Finally, we envision that the\nelectrostrictive OAF mechanism should also be applicable for other FE polymers\nsuch as odd-numbered nylons and piezoelectric biopolymers.",

We also find that melting efficiency maxima are usually highest on\nEarth-size planets. We show that the melting efficiency is only affected by\ncore size ratio for large cores and older planets, where melt production is\ndecreased significantly compared to smaller core size ratios. Projecting the\nlunar impactor flux on the generic planets, we find that Moon-sized planets\nproduce the most melt throughout their evolution, relative to planet volume.\nContrary to previous scaling laws, our method accounts for melt production by\ndecompression or plastic work in addition to shock melting. We find that\ntraditional scaling laws underestimate melt production on length scales where\nvariations in the target planets' lithology, temperature, and lithostatic\npressure become significant. We propose empirical formulas to predict melt\ngeneration as a function of radial structure and thermal age.",

    "abstract": "Stock price prediction is vital for investment decisions and risk management,\nyet remains challenging due to markets' nonlinear dynamics and time-varying\ninter-stock correlations. Traditional static-correlation models fail to capture\nevolving stock relationships. To address this, we propose a Differential Graph\nTransformer (DGT) framework for dynamic relationship modeling and price\nprediction. Our DGT integrates sequential graph structure changes into\nmulti-head self-attention via a differential graph mechanism, adaptively\npreserving high-value connections while suppressing noise. Causal temporal\nattention captures global/local dependencies in price sequences. We further\nevaluate correlation metrics (Pearson, Mutual Information, Spearman, Kendall's\nTau) across global/local/dual scopes as spatial-attention priors. Using 10\nyears of S&P 500 closing prices (z-score normalized; 64-day sliding windows),\nDGT with spatial priors outperformed GRU baselines (RMSE: 0.24 vs. 0.87).\nKendall's Tau global matrices yielded optimal results (MAE: 0.11). K-means\nclustering revealed \"high-volatility growth\" and \"defensive blue-chip\" stocks,\nwith the latter showing lower errors (RMSE: 0.13) due to stable correlations.\nKendall's Tau and Mutual Information excelled in volatile sectors. This study\ninnovatively combines differential graph structures with Transformers,\nvalidating dynamic relationship modeling and identifying optimal correlation\nmetrics/scopes. Clustering analysis supports tailored quantitative strategies.\nOur framework advances financial time-series prediction through dynamic\nmodeling and cross-asset interaction analysis.",

However,\nwithout a selection function to describe the completeness of the cluster\ncensus, it is difficult to quantitatively interpret their distribution. We\ncreate a method to empirically determine the selection function of a Galactic\ncluster catalogue. We test it by investigating the completeness of the cluster\ncensus in the outer Milky Way, where old and young clusters exhibit different\nspatial distributions. We develop a method to generate realistic mock clusters\nas a function of their parameters, in addition to accounting for Gaia's\nselection function and astrometric errors. We then inject mock clusters into\nGaia DR3 data, and attempt to recover them in a blind search using HDBSCAN. We\nfind that the main parameters influencing cluster detectability are mass,\nextinction, and distance. Age also plays an important role, making older\nclusters harder to detect due to their fainter luminosity function. High proper\nmotions also improve detectability. After correcting for these selection\neffects, we find that old clusters are $2.97\\pm0.11$ times more common at a\nGalactocentric radius of 13~kpc than in the solar neighbourhood -- despite\npositive detection biases in their favour, such as hotter orbits or a higher\nscale height. The larger fraction of older clusters in the outer Galaxy cannot\nbe explained by an observational bias, and must be a physical property of the\nMilky Way: young outer-disc clusters are not forming in the outer Galaxy, or at\nleast not with sufficient masses to be identified as clusters in Gaia DR3. We\npredict that in this region, more old clusters than young ones remain to be\ndiscovered. The current presence of old, massive outer-disc clusters could be\nexplained by radial heating and migration, or alternatively by a lower cluster\ndestruction rate in the anticentre.",

In this paper, we introduce a ternary phase\nseparation model, with non-reciprocal interactions between two of the three\nphases and a spectator phase that mimics a boundary. Through numerical\nsimulations, we uncover three distinct phase behaviours: a quasi-static regime,\ncharacterized by well-defined non-equilibrium contact angles at the three phase\ncontact line; a limit cycle regime, with the three bulk phases rotating around\nthe three phase contact line; and a travelling wave regime, featuring\npersistent directional motion. We complement our numerical findings with\nanalytical examination of linear stability and the wave propagation speed near\nequilibrium. Our model provides a minimal framework for extending classical\nequilibrium wetting theory to active and non-equilibrium systems.",

Matrix-Game is trained using a two-stage\npipeline that first performs large-scale unlabeled pretraining for environment\nunderstanding, followed by action-labeled training for interactive video\ngeneration. To support this, we curate Matrix-Game-MC, a comprehensive\nMinecraft dataset comprising over 2,700 hours of unlabeled gameplay video clips\nand over 1,000 hours of high-quality labeled clips with fine-grained keyboard\nand mouse action annotations. Our model adopts a controllable image-to-world\ngeneration paradigm, conditioned on a reference image, motion context, and user\nactions. With over 17 billion parameters, Matrix-Game enables precise control\nover character actions and camera movements, while maintaining high visual\nquality and temporal coherence. To evaluate performance, we develop GameWorld\nScore, a unified benchmark measuring visual quality, temporal quality, action\ncontrollability, and physical rule understanding for Minecraft world\ngeneration. Extensive experiments show that Matrix-Game consistently\noutperforms prior open-source Minecraft world models (including Oasis and\nMineWorld) across all metrics, with particularly strong gains in\ncontrollability and physical consistency. Double-blind human evaluations\nfurther confirm the superiority of Matrix-Game, highlighting its ability to\ngenerate perceptually realistic and precisely controllable videos across\ndiverse game scenarios.

Rather than constructing a global map or relying on absolute\nlocalization, NOVA formulates perception, estimation, and control entirely in\nthe target's reference frame. A tightly integrated stack combines a lightweight\nobject detector with stereo depth completion, followed by histogram-based\nfiltering to infer robust target distances under occlusion and noise. These\nmeasurements feed a visual-inertial state estimator that recovers the full\n6-DoF pose of the robot relative to the target. A nonlinear model predictive\ncontroller (NMPC) plans dynamically feasible trajectories in the target frame.\nTo ensure safety, high-order control barrier functions are constructed online\nfrom a compact set of high-risk collision points extracted from depth, enabling\nreal-time obstacle avoidance without maps or dense representations. We validate\nNOVA across challenging real-world scenarios, including urban mazes, forest\ntrails, and repeated transitions through buildings with intermittent GPS loss\nand severe lighting changes that disrupt feature-based localization. Each\nexperiment is repeated multiple times under similar conditions to assess\nresilience, showing consistent and reliable performance.

    "abstract": "Bose-Einstein condensation of spin-polarized triplet excitons can give rise\nto an intriguing spin supercurrent, enabling experimental detection of exciton\ncondensation. In this work, we predict that Ta3X8 (X=I, Br) ferromagnetic\nmonolayers are spin-polarized triplet excitonic insulators (EIs), based on the\nsystematic first-principles GW calculations coupled with the Bethe-Salpeter\nequation (GW+BSE). The single-particle calculations of spin-polarized band\nstructures reveal that these monolayers are bipolar magnetic semiconductors,\nwhere the highest valence band and the lowest conduction band possess opposite\nspin polarization. The two low-energy bands, primarily originating from Ta\n$d_{z^2}$ orbitals, are almost flat. The same-orbital parity and opposite-spin\nnatures of the band-edge states effectively suppress dielectric screening,\npromoting the emergence of the EI state. The GW+BSE calculations reveal that\nthe binding energy of the lowest-energy exciton is 1.499 eV for Ta3I8 monolayer\nand 1.986 eV for Ta3Br8 monolayer. Since both values exceed the respective GW\nband gaps, these results indicate a strong excitonic instability in these\nmonolayers. A wavefunction analysis confirms that the lowest-energy exciton is\na tightly bound Frenkel-like state, exhibiting a spin-polarized triplet nature\nwith $S_z=1$. Our findings establish a valuable material platform for\ninvestigating spin-polarized triplet EIs, offering promising potential for\nspintronic applications.",

This extensive analysis of the theoretical\nguarantees of DPM allows a better understanding of its behaviour for arbitrary\ninputs.

Inspired by the recent\nadvances in motion synthesis, we propose a two-stage solution: encoding\ntwo-person motions into discrete tokens and then generating these tokens from\nmusic. To effectively capture intricate interactions, we represent both\ndancers' motions as a unified whole to learn the necessary motion tokens, and\nadopt a coarse-to-fine learning strategy in both the stages. Our first stage\nutilizes a VQ-VAE that hierarchically separates high-level semantic features at\na coarse temporal resolution from low-level details at a finer resolution,\nproducing two discrete token sequences at different abstraction levels.\nSubsequently, in the second stage, two generative masked transformers learn to\nmap music signals to these dance tokens: the first producing high-level\nsemantic tokens, and the second, conditioned on music and these semantic\ntokens, producing the low-level tokens. We train both transformers to learn to\npredict randomly masked tokens within the sequence, enabling them to\niteratively generate motion tokens by filling an empty token sequence during\ninference. Through the hierarchical masked modeling and dedicated interaction\nrepresentation, DuetGen achieves the generation of synchronized and interactive\ntwo-person dances across various genres.

    "abstract": "The computational and energy costs of Large Language Models (LLMs) have\nincreased exponentially driven by the growing model sizes and the massive\nadoption of LLMs by hundreds of millions of users. The unit cost of an LLM is\nthe computation of a token. Therefore, the tokenizer plays an important role in\nthe efficiency of a model, and they are carefully optimized to minimize the\nnumber of tokens for the text in their training corpus. One of the most popular\napplications of LLMs are chatbots that interact with users. A key observation\nis that, for those chatbots, what is important is the performance of the\ntokenizer in the user text input and the chatbot responses. Those are most\nlikely different from the text in the training corpus. So, a question that\nimmediately arises is whether there is a potential benefit in optimizing\ntokenizers for chatbot conversations. In this paper, this idea is explored for\ndifferent tokenizers by using a publicly available corpus of chatbot\nconversations to redesign their vocabularies and evaluate their performance in\nthis domain. The results show that conversation-optimized tokenizers\nconsistently reduce the number of tokens in chatbot dialogues, which can lead\nto meaningful energy savings, in the range of 5% to 10% while having minimal or\neven slightly positive impact on tokenization efficiency for the original\ntraining corpus.",

In\nthis way, the same multilinear structure, with the same polynomial\ncoefficients, is inherited by the asymptotic expansion of any linearly induced\nquantity such as the distribution of the $k$-th largest level. Whereas the\nresults for the unitary ensembles are presented with proof, the discussion of\nthe orthogonal and symplectic ones is based on some hypotheses.

During the group dance generation process, however, most existing\nmethods still face three primary issues: multi-dancer collisions, single-dancer\nfoot sliding and abrupt swapping in the generation of long group dance. In this\npaper, we propose TCDiff++, a music-driven end-to-end framework designed to\ngenerate harmonious group dance. Specifically, to mitigate multi-dancer\ncollisions, we utilize a dancer positioning embedding to better maintain the\nrelative positioning among dancers. Additionally, we incorporate a\ndistance-consistency loss to ensure that inter-dancer distances remain within\nplausible ranges. To address the issue of single-dancer foot sliding, we\nintroduce a swap mode embedding to indicate dancer swapping patterns and design\na Footwork Adaptor to refine raw motion, thereby minimizing foot sliding. For\nlong group dance generation, we present a long group diffusion sampling\nstrategy that reduces abrupt position shifts by injecting positional\ninformation into the noisy input. Furthermore, we integrate a Sequence Decoder\nlayer to enhance the model's ability to selectively process long sequences.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that our TCDiff++ achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance, particularly in long-duration scenarios, ensuring high-quality and\ncoherent group dance generation.",

However, for challenging\ncorpora, we argue that enhancing queries alone is insufficient for robust\nsemantic matching; the LLM should also have sufficient understanding of the\ncorpus by directly handling and augmenting the documents themselves. To this\nend, we present an LLM-based retriever empowered to augment both user queries\nand corpus documents, with its policy fully explored via reinforcement learning\n(RL) and minimal human inductive bias. Notably, we find that simply allowing\nthe LLM to modify documents yields little benefit unless paired with our\ncarefully designed bidirectional RL framework, which enables the LLM to\nsimultaneously learn and collaborate on both query and document augmentation\npolicies. A key technical challenge in realizing such a framework lies in\njointly updating both policies during training, where the rewards for the two\ndirections depend on each other, making their entangled reward intractable. Our\napproach addresses this by introducing a reward sampling strategy and a\nspecifically designed RL algorithm that enables effective training with these\nsampled rewards. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach\nsignificantly enhances LLM-based retrieval performance in both sparse and dense\nsettings, particularly in difficult retrieval domains, and achieves strong\ncross-benchmark generalization.

We further show\nthat image reconstructions at pixel scales finer than the PSF resolution\nintroduce substantial statistical uncertainties, reducing the effective number\nof independent spatial degrees of freedom. These findings underscore the\nnecessity of PSF-based analysis for accurate sensitivity evaluation and\nstatistically robust imaging in Compton cameras, particularly in applications\nwhere the background discrimination is critical.",

Our multi-modal decoder\nintegrates both modals for comprehensive diagnostic reports generation.\nExperiments on the PathText (BRCA) dataset demonstrate our framework's\nsuperiority, achieving state-of-the-art performance with 7.4\\% relative\nimprovement in NLP metrics and 19.1\\% enhancement in classification metrics for\nHer-2 prediction versus existing methods.

Specifically, the proposed RDPO\nreverse-samples real video sequences with a pre-trained generator to\nautomatically build preference pairs that are statistically distinguishable in\nterms of physical correctness.

Benefiting from\nthe dynamic information explored from real videos, our proposed RDPO\nsignificantly improves the action coherence and physical realism of the\ngenerated videos.

DLBC partitions agents into distinct groups\nand dynamically modulates behavioral diversity both within and between these\ngroups. By dynamically modulating behavioral diversity within and between these\ngroups, DLBC achieves enhanced division of labor through inter-group\nconsistency, which constrains behavioral strategies across different groups.\nSimultaneously, intra-group consistency, achieved by aligning behavioral\nstrategies within each group, fosters stronger intra-group cooperation.\nCrucially, DLBC's direct constraint of agent policy functions ensures its broad\napplicability across various algorithmic frameworks. Experimental results in\nvarious grouping cooperation scenarios demonstrate that DLBC significantly\nenhances both intra-group cooperative performance and inter-group task\nspecialization, yielding substantial performance improvements. DLBC provides\nnew ideas for behavioral consistency control of multi-intelligent body systems,\nand its potential for application in more complex tasks and dynamic\nenvironments can be further explored in the future.",

The generalization\nerror bound is decomposed into two components: the trajectory term and the\nflatness term. Our analysis improves the trajectory term to $O(n^{-1})$,\nsignificantly enhancing the previous $O((nb)^{-1/2})$ bound for bounded losses,\nwhere n is the number of training samples and b is the batch size. By selecting\nan optimal variance for the perturbation noise, the overall bound is further\nrefined to $O(n^{-2/3})$. For sub-Gaussian loss functions, a tighter trajectory\nterm is also achieved. In both cases, the flatness term remains stable across\niterations and is smaller than those reported in previous literature, which\nincrease with iterations. This stability, ensured by T2pm-SGD, leads to tighter\ngeneralization error bounds for both loss function types.

Since deterministic voting rules cannot achieve this\nideal, we develop randomized voting rules that satisfy ex-ante neutrality,\nmonotonicity, and continuity, while maintaining strong ex-post proportionality\nguarantees.\n  Continuity of the candidate selection probabilities proves to be the most\ndemanding of our ex-ante desiderata. We provide it via voting rules that are\nalgorithmically stable, a stronger notion of robustness which captures the\ncontinuity of the committee distribution under small changes. First, we\nintroduce Softmax-GJCR, a randomized variant of the Greedy Justified Candidate\nRule (GJCR) [Brill and Peters, 2023], which carefully leverages slack in GJCR\nto satisfy our ex-ante properties. This polynomial-time algorithm satisfies\nEJR+ ex post, assures ex-ante monotonicity and neutrality, and provides\n$O(k^3/n)$-stability (ignoring $\\log$ factors). Building on our techniques for\nSoftmax-GJCR, we further show that stronger stability guarantees can be\nattained by (i) allowing exponential running time, (ii) relaxing EJR+ to an\napproximate $\\alpha$-EJR+, and (iii) relaxing EJR+ to JR.\n  We finally demonstrate the utility of stable voting rules in other settings.\nIn online dynamic committee voting, we show that stable voting rules imply\ndynamic voting rules with low expected recourse, and illustrate this reduction\nfor Softmax-GJCR. Our voting rules also satisfy a stronger form of stability\nthat coincides with differential privacy, suggesting their applicability in\nprivacy-sensitive domains.",

This paper proposes an efficient network reduction\nframework based on subgraph extraction, which accurately preserves epidemic\nspreading dynamics and information flow through a coordinated optimization\nstrategy of node removal and edge pruning. Specifically, a node removal\nalgorithm driven by enhanced degree centrality is introduced to preferentially\nremove low-centrality nodes, thereby constructing a smaller-scale subnetwork.\nSubsequently, an edge pruning algorithm is designed to regulate the edge\ndensity of the subnetwork, ensuring that its average degree remains\napproximately consistent with that of the original network. Experimental\nresults on Erd\\\"os-R\\'enyi random graphs, Barab\\'asi-Albert scale-free\nnetworks, and real-world social contact networks from various domains\ndemonstrate that this proposed method can reduce the size of networks with\nheterogeneous structures by more than 85\\%, while preserving their epidemic\ndynamics and information flow. More importantly, our method almost always\nachieves the highest accuracy compared to state-of-the-art techniques.

Despite its promise, FL faces significant hurdles in\nnon-identically and independently distributed (non-IID) data scenarios, where\nmost existing methods often struggle with data heterogeneity and lack\nrobustness in performance. This paper introduces Federated Loss Exploration\n(FedLEx), an innovative approach specifically designed to tackle these\nchallenges. FedLEx distinctively addresses the shortcomings of existing FL\nmethods in non-IID settings by optimizing its learning behavior for scenarios\nin which assumptions about data heterogeneity are impractical or unknown. It\nemploys a federated loss exploration technique, where clients contribute to a\nglobal guidance matrix by calculating gradient deviations for model parameters.\nThis matrix serves as a strategic compass to guide clients' gradient updates in\nsubsequent FL rounds, thereby fostering optimal parameter updates for the\nglobal model. FedLEx effectively navigates the complex loss surfaces inherent\nin non-IID data, enhancing knowledge transfer in an efficient manner, since\nonly a small number of epochs and small amount of data are required to build a\nstrong global guidance matrix that can achieve model convergence without the\nneed for additional data sharing or data distribution statics in a large client\nscenario.

Across\nall LLMs examined, AggTruth demonstrated stable performance in both same-task\nand cross-task setups, outperforming the current SOTA in multiple scenarios.\nFurthermore, we conducted an in-depth analysis of feature selection techniques\nand examined how the number of selected attention heads impacts detection\nperformance, demonstrating that careful selection of heads is essential to\nachieve optimal results.",

Although the\ncontributions of the direct and indirect regulatory pathways of feed-forward\nloops to output variability have been well characterized, the impact of their\njoint action arising from their shared input and output remains poorly\nunderstood. Here, we identify an additional component of noise that emerges\nspecifically from this convergent nature of the pathways. Using inter-gene\ncorrelations, we reveal the regulatory basis of the cross-interaction noise and\ninterpret it as synergy or redundancy in noise propagation, depending on\nwhether the combined pathways amplify or suppress fluctuations. Synergy\ntypically arises in coherent feed-forward loops, whereas redundancy is common\nin incoherent ones. This framework not only accounts for previously observed\ndifferences in noise behavior across coherent and incoherent structures but\nalso provides a generalizable strategy to connect network structure with\nstochastic gene regulation.

Key elements for managing the loss of conventional\ngenerators are virtual-synchronous-generator-based grid-forming inverters.\nDespite the unique advantages of this technology, there are still various\nchallenges, most notably the problem of active-reactive power coupling due to a\nnonzero power angle and high grid impedance ratio R/X. The effect of power\ncoupling means that any change in the inverter's active power will affect the\nreactive power and vice versa. This challenge results in grid instability,\nreduces control performance, and restricts the active power delivery capability\nof the inverter to the grid. This paper presents a new vision to solve this\nimpact in weak grids by a new power-decoupling method based on adaptive virtual\nsynchronous generator parameters. The power coupling will be studied\nconsidering the parameters causing this effect. Fuzzy logic will serve to\nadjust the parameters of power control loops. Hardware-in-the-loop testing on a\nreal-time simulator (OP4610) and a physical microcontroller verified and\nvalidated the proposed method.

    "abstract": "The multivariate Gaussian rate-distortion (RD) function is crucial in various\napplications, such as digital communications, data storage, or neural networks.\nHowever, the complex form of the multivariate Gaussian RD function prevents its\napplication in many neural network-based scenarios that rely on its analytical\nproperties, for example, white-box neural networks, multi-device task-oriented\ncommunication, and semantic communication. This paper proposes a simple but\naccurate approximation for the multivariate Gaussian RD function. The upper and\nlower bounds on the approximation error (the difference between the approximate\nand the exact value) are derived, which indicate that for well-conditioned\ncovariance matrices, the approximation error is small. In particular, when the\ncondition number of the covariance matrix approaches 1, the approximation error\napproaches 0. In addition, based on the proposed approximation, a new\nclassification algorithm called Adaptive Regularized ReduNet (AR-ReduNet) is\nderived by applying the approximation to ReduNet, which is a white-box\nclassification network oriented from Maximal Coding Rate Reduction (MCR$^2$)\nprinciple. Simulation results indicate that AR-ReduNet achieves higher accuracy\nand more efficient optimization than ReduNet.",

    "abstract": "The reliance on distributed renewable energy has increased recently. As a\nresult, power electronic-based distributed generators replaced synchronous\ngenerators which led to a change in the dynamic characteristics of the\nmicrogrid. Most critically, they reduced system inertia and damping. Virtual\nsynchronous generators emulated in power electronics, which mimic the dynamic\nbehaviour of synchronous generators, are meant to fix this problem. However,\nfixed virtual synchronous generator parameters cannot guarantee a frequency\nregulation within the acceptable tolerance range. Conversely, a dynamic\nadjustment of these virtual parameters promises robust solution with stable\nfrequency. This paper proposes a method to adapt the inertia, damping, and\ndroop parameters dynamically through a fuzzy neural network controller. This\ncontroller trains itself online to choose appropriate values for these virtual\nparameters. The proposed method can be applied to a typical AC microgrid by\nconsidering the penetration and impact of renewable energy sources. We study\nthe system in a MATLAB/Simulink model and validate it experimentally in real\ntime using hardware-in-the-loop based on an embedded ARM system (SAM3X8E,\nCortex-M3). Compared to traditional and fuzzy logic controller methods, the\nresults demonstrate that the proposed method significantly reduces the\nfrequency deviation to less than 0.03 Hz and shortens the stabilizing/recovery\ntime.",

Last decade, many one- or two-stage designs for\nsingle-arm trials (SATs) have emerged as an alternative to overcome this issue.\nThese designs rely on the one-sample log-rank test (OSLRT) and its modified\nversion (mOSLRT) to compare the survival curves of an experimental and an\nexternal control group under the proportional hazards (PH) assumption that may\nbe violated. We extend Finkelstein's formulation of OSLRT as a score test under\nPH by using a piecewise exponential model with change-points (CPs) for early,\nmiddle and delayed treatment effects and an accelerated hazards model for\ncrossing hazards. The restricted mean survival time (RMST) based test is\nadapted to SATs and we also construct a combination test procedure (max-Combo)\nwith correction for multiple testing. The performance of the developed tests\n(score tests, RMST and max-Combo tests) are evaluated through a simulation\nstudy of early, middle, delayed effects and crossing hazards. Findings show\nthat the score tests are as conservative as the OSLRT and have the highest\npower when the data generation matches with the model. The max-Combo test is an\ninteresting approach when the time-dependent relative treatment effect and/or\nthe values of CPs are unknown. Uncertainty on the survival curve estimate of\nthe external control group and model misspecification may have a significant\nimpact on performance. For illustration, we apply the developed tests on three\nreal data examples.",

However, MeV-GeV\nPWN counterparts are still largely lacking. To date, only a dozen PWNe are\nidentified by the Fermi-Large Area Telescope (LAT) in the MeV-GeV band. Most\nPWNe are located along the Galactic plane embedded within the prominent,\ndiffuse Galactic gamma-ray emission, which makes these sources difficult to\ndisentangle from the bright diffuse background. We present a systematic search\nfor gamma-ray counterparts to known PWNe in the 300MeV-2TeV energy band using\nthe Fermi-LAT. We target locations of previously identified PWNe that lack\ndetected Fermi-LAT pulsars to minimize associated pulsar contamination. The\nsample includes 6 previously identified Fermi-LAT PWNe and 8 Fermi-LAT sources\nassociated with PWNe. We report the analysis of 58 regions of interest and\nclassify detected sources as either a likely PWN or a candidate PWN counterpart\nbased on their morphological and spectral characteristics across the broadband\nspectrum. There are 9 unidentified Fermi-LAT sources that we consider as likely\nPWN counterparts, which, if confirmed to be PWNe, would greatly increase the\nPWN population detected by the Fermi-LAT from 12 to 21. The remaining Fermi-LAT\ndetected sources are considered weaker PWN candidates. A second approach in the\nsystematic search for gamma-ray emitting PWNe will involve studying the\noff-pulse phases of Fermi-LAT pulsars for the presence of an obscured PWN and\nwill be reported in a subsequent paper.",

Both approaches reveal that the vortex\ncirculation increases for disk motions in either direction, toward or away from\nthe wall. However, the effect of the bottom wall on the vortex core radius\ndiffers depending on the motion of the disk. The presence of the wall increases\nthe core radius only when the disk moves toward the wall, while no significant\neffect is observed for a translation away from the wall.

In this work, we propose SpaNN, an attack detector whose\ncomputational complexity is independent of the expected number of adversarial\npatches. The key novelty of the proposed detector is that it builds an ensemble\nof binarized feature maps by applying a set of saliency thresholds to the\nneural activations of the first convolutional layer of the victim model.

We\nevaluate SpaNN on four widely used data sets for object detection and\nclassification, and our results show that SpaNN outperforms state-of-the-art\ndefenses by up to 11 and 27 percentage points in the case of object detection\nand the case of image classification, respectively.

Achieving comprehensive\nAI empowerment across multiple disciplines is still out of reach. Present-day\nresearch data collection is often fragmented, lacking unified standards,\ninefficiently managed, and difficult to share. Creating a single platform for\nstandardized data digitization needs to overcome the inherent challenge of\nbalancing between universality (supporting the diverse, ever-evolving needs of\nvarious disciplines) and standardization (enforcing consistent formats to fully\nenable AI). No existing platform accommodates both facets. Building a truly\nmultidisciplinary platform requires integrating scientific domain knowledge\nwith sophisticated computing skills. Researchers often lack the computational\nexpertise to design customized and standardized data recording methods, whereas\nplatform developers rarely grasp the intricate needs of multiple scientific\ndomains. These gaps impede research data standardization and hamper AI-driven\nprogress. In this study, we address these challenges by developing Airalogy\n(https://airalogy.com), the world's first AI- and community-driven platform\nthat balances universality and standardization for digitizing research data\nacross multiple disciplines. Airalogy represents entire research workflows\nusing customizable, standardized data records and offers an advanced AI\nresearch copilot for intelligent Q&A, automated data entry, analysis, and\nresearch automation. Already deployed in laboratories across all four schools\nof Westlake University, Airalogy has the potential to accelerate and automate\nscientific innovation in universities, industry, and the global research\ncommunity-ultimately benefiting humanity as a whole.",

    "abstract": "LiDAR-Inertial Odometry (LIO) is widely used for accurate state estimation\nand mapping which is an essential requirement for autonomous robots.\nConventional LIO methods typically rely on formulating constraints from the\ngeometric structure sampled by the LiDAR. Hence, in the lack of geometric\nstructure, these tend to become ill-conditioned (degenerate) and fail.\nRobustness of LIO to such conditions is a necessity for its broader deployment.\nTo address this, we propose PG-LIO, a real-time LIO method that fuses\nphotometric and geometric information sampled by the LiDAR along with inertial\nconstraints from an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). This multi-modal\ninformation is integrated into a factor graph optimized over a sliding window\nfor real-time operation. We evaluate PG-LIO on multiple datasets that include\nboth geometrically well-conditioned as well as self-similar scenarios. Our\nmethod achieves accuracy on par with state-of-the-art LIO in geometrically\nwell-structured settings while significantly improving accuracy in degenerate\ncases including against methods that also fuse intensity.

While\nthere are established methods for point clouds of sufficient quality,\nstate-of-the-art still struggles when this quality drops. Thus, this paper\npresents a novel learning-based framework for predicting robust point\ncorrespondences between pairs of noisy, sparse and unstructured 3D point clouds\nfrom a light-weight, low-power, inexpensive, consumer-grade System-on-Chip\n(SoC) Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) radar sensor. Our network is\nbased on the transformer architecture which allows leveraging the attention\nmechanism to discover pairs of points in consecutive scans with the greatest\nmutual affinity. The proposed network is trained in a self-supervised way using\nset-based multi-label classification cross-entropy loss, where the ground-truth\nset of matches is found by solving the Linear Sum Assignment (LSA) optimization\nproblem, which avoids tedious hand annotation of the training data.\nAdditionally, posing the loss calculation as multi-label classification permits\nsupervising on point correspondences directly instead of on odometry error,\nwhich is not feasible for sparse and noisy data from the SoC radar we use. We\nevaluate our method with an open-source state-of-the-art Radar-Inertial\nOdometry (RIO) framework in real-world Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) flights\nand with the widely used public Coloradar dataset.

This paper presents a high-fidelity Ray Tracing Method (RTM)\nsynergistically amalgamated with a continuously differentiable\nGalerkin-Difference (GD) interpolation strategy for three-dimensional electron\ndensity reconstruction. The RTM-GD can ensure analytically smooth gradients,\nand thus significantly enhance gradient continuity, numerical stability, and\ncomputational efficiency in Hamiltonian-based ray tracing. To systematically\nevaluate the applicability and performance of RTM-GD, we propose a four-stage\nexperimental design. First, we conduct a grid-resolution sensitivity experiment\nto evaluate the convergence behavior and directional consistency of the\ninterpolation method under varying spatial scales. Second, we perform an\nelevation-angle scanning experiment ranging from 3 to 65 degrees within a\nmid-latitude ionospheric environment. The results indicate that RTM-GD improves\npath accuracy by over an order of magnitude compared to Catmull-Rom\ninterpolation, while achieving a 14.6-fold increase in computational efficiency\nrelative to the Richardson extrapolation method. Third, we further conduct\nsimulation experiments for high-elevation F2-mode propagation near the critical\nincident angle. RTM-GD achieves further error reduction compared to the second\nscheme, confirming its numerical stability and robustness. Finally, we compare\nsynthetic oblique ionograms generated by RTM-GD with observed HF propagation\ncharacteristics. The results demonstrate that the model can effectively capture\nthe typical dual-mode propagation behavior of the F2 layer.

    "abstract": "Autonomous and learning agents increasingly participate in markets - setting\nprices, placing bids, ordering inventory. Such agents are not just aiming to\noptimize in an uncertain environment; they are making decisions in a\ngame-theoretical environment where the decision of one agent influences the\nprofit of other agents. While game theory usually predicts outcomes of\nstrategic interaction as an equilibrium, it does not capture how repeated\ninteraction of learning agents arrives at a certain outcome. This article\nsurveys developments in modeling agent behavior as dynamical systems, with a\nfocus on projected gradient and no-regret learning algorithms. In general,\nlearning in games can lead to all types of dynamics, including convergence to\nequilibrium, but also cycles and chaotic behavior. It is important to\nunderstand when we can expect efficient equilibrium in automated markets and\nwhen this is not the case. Thus, we analyze when and how learning agents\nconverge to an equilibrium of a market game, drawing on tools from variational\ninequalities and Lyapunov stability theory. Special attention is given to the\nstability of projected dynamics and the convergence to equilibrium sets as\nlimiting outcomes. Overall, the paper provides mathematical foundations for\nanalyzing stability and convergence in agentic markets driven by autonomous,\nlearning agents.",

    "abstract": "Cooking requires not only following instructions but also understanding,\nexecuting, and monitoring each step - a process that can be challenging without\nvisual guidance. Although recipe images and videos offer helpful cues, they\noften lack consistency in focus, tools, and setup. To better support the\ncooking process, we introduce VisualChef, a method for generating contextual\nvisual aids tailored to cooking scenarios. Given an initial frame and a\nspecified action, VisualChef generates images depicting both the action's\nexecution and the resulting appearance of the object, while preserving the\ninitial frame's environment. Previous work aims to integrate knowledge\nextracted from large language models by generating detailed textual\ndescriptions to guide image generation, which requires fine-grained\nvisual-textual alignment and involves additional annotations. In contrast,\nVisualChef simplifies alignment through mask-based visual grounding. Our key\ninsight is identifying action-relevant objects and classifying them to enable\ntargeted modifications that reflect the intended action and outcome while\nmaintaining a consistent environment. In addition, we propose an automated\npipeline to extract high-quality initial, action, and final state frames.

On Split\nCIFAR10, SESLR achieves nearly 30% improvement in average accuracy with only\none-third of the memory consumption compared to baseline methods.

By decoupling the slow dynamics of the\ndriver (a laser or ultrarelativistic particle beam) from the fast plasma\nresponse, these codes can reduce the computational time by several orders of\nmagnitude compared to conventional PIC codes. In this work, we demonstrate that\nquasistatic PIC codes can also be utilized to investigate relativistic\nbeam-plasma instabilities, with a focus on the oblique two-stream instability\n(OTSI). For this purpose, we have developed a 2D quasistatic PIC code, QuaSSis,\nbased on a new numerical scheme that can handle transversely periodic boundary\nconditions, a capability absent in previous quasistatic codes. The accuracy of\nQuaSSis is benchmarked first against standard PIC simulations performed with\nthe CALDER code, and then against an analytical spatiotemporal model of the\nOTSI. Physically, this instability grows exponentially from initial\nfluctuations in the particle charge or current densities. Since the numerical\nnoise inherent to PIC simulations can mimic these fluctuations to some extent,\nits control is crucial to seed the beam-plasma instability at the desired\namplitude. Common methods for tuning this noise involve modifying the\nresolution or adding filters, but these can be computationally costly when\naiming at very low noise levels. Here, we show that this noise can be finely\ncontrolled by properly initializing the positions and weights of the\nmacroparticles.",

In this study, we develop an\nenergy-based physics-informed neural network (PINN) framework using an\nincremental approach to model viscoelastic creep, stress relaxation, buckling,\nand growth-induced morphogenesis. Physics consistency is ensured by training\nneural networks to minimize the systems potential energy functional, implicitly\nsatisfying equilibrium and constitutive laws.

Results show that the\nenergy-based PINN effectively predicts viscoelastic instabilities,\npost-buckling evolution and tissue morphological evolution, offering a\npromising alternative to traditional methods.

In the present work, we start by summarizing how unquenched orbital\nmoments arise from particular combinations of crystal field splitting and\norbital filling. We exemplify this for the cases of two-dimensional (2D) VI$_3$\nand FePS$_3$, and show that Hubbard corrections as well as self-consistent\nspin-orbit coupling are crucial ingredients for predicting correct orbital\nmoments from first principles calculations. We then search the Computational 2D\nMaterials Database (C2DB) for monolayers having tetrahedral or octahedral\ncrystal field splitting of transition metal $d$-states and orbital occupancy\nthat is expected to lead to large orbital moments. We identify 112 monolayers\nwith octahedral crystal field splitting and 62 monolayers with tetrahedral\ncrystal field splitting and for materials with partially filled $t_{2g}$ bands,\nwe verify that inclusion of Hubbard corrections as well as self-consistent\nspin-orbit coupling typically increases the magnitude of predicted orbital\nmoments by an order of magnitude.",

    "abstract": "We report the discovery of J1218+1813, a circular diffuse radio source\ndetected in the Very Large Array (VLA) FIRST survey at 1400 MHz. The source has\nan angular diameter of approximately one arcminute, corresponding to a physical\nsize of ~180 kpc, and is associated with an elliptical galaxy with a redshift\nof z = 0.139635. To investigate its nature, we conducted a comprehensive\nmultiwavelength analysis spanning both high and low radio frequencies,\nutilizing the VLA in C-configuration at L, C and X bands, along with the\nupgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) at bands 3 (250-500 MHz), 4\n(550-850 MHz), and 5 (1000-1460 MHz). A spectral study based on these\nmultiwavelength observations reveals that the core of J1218+1813 exhibits a\nsteep spectral index of 0.8, indicating that the emission is dominated by\noptically thin synchrotron radiation. The spectral index varies between 1.1 and\n1.8, from the inner to the outer structure, with the steepest values observed\nat the periphery of the diffuse emission. An optical analysis of the central\nhost galaxy using spectroscopic data is also performed. The estimated black\nhole mass is $2.8 \\pm 0.8 \\times 10^{8}$ M${_\\odot}$, while the host galaxy has\na stellar mass of 2.9 $\\times$ 10$^{11}$ M${_\\odot}$ and a stellar age of 8.58\nGyr. The identification of J1218+1813 is particularly significant because it\nprovides insight into the mechanisms responsible for the formation of circular\ndiffuse radio structures surrounded by an elliptical galaxy. Potential\nformation scenarios for J1218+1813 are discussed in this paper.",

Observations from both ground-based and space-based\nfacilities have been analysed to investigate state transitions within the\nsystem. Throughout this period, significant changes in the light curve have\nbeen observed, corresponding to different mass accretion states. From four\nyears of TESS photometry, we derive a revised photometric period that agrees\nwith the spectroscopic period to within 1.2$\\sigma$. These optical observations\nfurther suggest switching between two accretion poles. During intervals of high\naccretion, dips in the X-ray light curve indicate that the primary accretion\npole is obscured by an accretion stream elevated above the orbital plane, a\nfeature also evident in the TESS light curves. Additionally, periodogram\nanalysis reveals a periodicity of $\\approx$437 days, which may be related to\nlong-term accretion state changes. Following a 16-year high state, AN UMa\nentered two short-lived low states, lasting 180 and 123 days, during which it\nfaded to a magnitude of 19.2, as recorded by the ZTF and ATLAS surveys. Using\nthe system's low-state brightness and the distance provided by Gaia, we\nestimate that the system may have a white dwarf with an effective temperature\nof $\\approx$15000~K, and a donor of spectral type M4.7.

In our discussion, we also introduce a second\nimportant hypothesis: if a measurement closely approximates an ideal one in\nterms of experimental precision, the information it provides about a physical\nsystem is independent of the measurement method and, specifically, of the\nsystem's physical quantities being measured. This principle can be expressed in\nterms of metric properties of a manifold whose points represent the state of\nthe system. These and other reasonable hypotheses provide the foundation for a\nframework of quantum reconstruction.\n  The theory presented in this paper is based on a description of physical\nsystems in terms of their statistical properties, specifically statistical\nparameters, and focuses on the study of estimators for these parameters. To\nachieve the goal of quantum reconstruction, a divide-and-conquer approach is\nemployed, wherein the space of two discrete conjugate Hamiltonian variables is\npartitioned into a binary tree of nested sets. This approach naturally leads to\nthe reconstruction of the linear and probabilistic structure of quantum\nmechanics.",

However, these categorizations have become\noutdated, as their conceptualizations are unable to meaningfully compare PGM\nwith neural network (NN) click models nor generalize to newer interfaces, such\nas carousel interfaces. We argue that this outdated view fails to adequately\nexplain the fundamentals of click model designs, thus hindering the development\nof novel click models.\n  This work reconsiders what should be the fundamental concepts in click model\ndesign, grounding them - unlike previous approaches - in their mathematical\nproperties. We propose three fundamental key-design choices that explain what\nstatistical patterns a click model can capture, and thus indirectly, what user\nbehaviors they can capture. Based on these choices, we create a novel click\nmodel taxonomy that allows a meaningful comparison of all existing click\nmodels; this is the first taxonomy of single-list, grid and carousel click\nmodels that includes PGMs and NNs.

Instead of feeding the compressed bottlenecks to the decoder\ndirectly, we introduce the multi-semantic features of normal samples into the\nreconstruction process. To this end, we first extract abstract global semantics\nof normal cases by a pre-trained vision-language network, then the learnable\nsemantic codebooks are constructed to store representative feature vectors of\nnormal samples by vector quantisation. Finally, the above multi-semantic\nfeatures are fused and employed as input to the decoder to guide the\nreconstruction of anomalies to approximate normality. Extensive experiments are\nconducted to validate the effectiveness of our proposed method, and it achieves\nthe SOTA performance on the MVTec LOCO AD dataset with improvements of 5.7% in\npixel-sPRO and 2.6% in image-AUROC.

    "abstract": "The widespread deployment of large language models (LLMs) has raised critical\nconcerns over their vulnerability to jailbreak attacks, i.e., adversarial\nprompts that bypass alignment mechanisms and elicit harmful or policy-violating\noutputs. While proprietary models like GPT-4 have undergone extensive\nevaluation, the robustness of emerging open-source alternatives such as\nDeepSeek remains largely underexplored, despite their growing adoption in\nreal-world applications. In this paper, we present the first systematic\njailbreak evaluation of DeepSeek-series models, comparing them with GPT-3.5 and\nGPT-4 using the HarmBench benchmark. We evaluate seven representative attack\nstrategies across 510 harmful behaviors categorized by both function and\nsemantic domain. Our analysis reveals that DeepSeek's Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)\narchitecture introduces routing sparsity that offers selective robustness\nagainst optimization-based attacks such as TAP-T, but leads to significantly\nhigher vulnerability under prompt-based and manually engineered attacks. In\ncontrast, GPT-4 Turbo demonstrates stronger and more consistent safety\nalignment across diverse behaviors, likely due to its dense Transformer design\nand reinforcement learning from human feedback. Fine-grained behavioral\nanalysis and case studies further show that DeepSeek often routes adversarial\nprompts to under-aligned expert modules, resulting in inconsistent refusal\nbehaviors. These findings highlight a fundamental trade-off between\narchitectural efficiency and alignment generalization, emphasizing the need for\ntargeted safety tuning and modular alignment strategies to ensure secure\ndeployment of open-source LLMs.",

In the cyclic processes displayed so far, the global causal\norder is determined jointly by the operations performed by agents at each\nevent, a feature that can be certified through the introduction of causal games\nand (the violation of) causal inequalities. This raises the question of whether\nthere exist processes in which an agent acting at a single event can\nunilaterally determine her causal ordering with respect to some other events.\nWe answer this question in the affirmative, by introducing a process in which\nany party may be put in a position to pick, on her own, any other party to lie\nin her future.

We investigate thermal rectification in a\nquantum harmonic oscillator coupled to two thermal baths via both single-photon\n(linear) and two-photon (nonlinear) exchange processes. At low temperatures,\nrectification arises from a state-dependent suppression of two-photon emission:\nwhen the cold bath dominates, it drives the oscillator into low-occupancy\nstates, inhibiting emission and creating a thermal bottleneck. At higher\ntemperatures, rectification is governed by the asymmetric scaling of\nhigher-order moments associated with two-photon absorption and emission. We\nsystematically explore various bath coupling configurations and identify the\nconditions under which nonlinear dissipation leads to directional heat flow.\nFurthermore, we propose an implementation scheme based on coupling an auxiliary\ntwo-level system to the oscillator, enabling effective two-photon dissipation.\nThese results contribute to the understanding of quantum heat transport in the\npresence of nonlinear dissipation and may support future efforts in nanoscale\nthermal rectification design.",

Most existing\nhyperbolic learning methods use fixed distance measures for all data, assuming\na uniform hierarchy across all data points. However, real-world hierarchical\nstructures exhibit significant diversity, making this assumption overly\nrestrictive. In this paper, we propose a geometry-aware distance measure in\nhyperbolic spaces, which dynamically adapts to varying hierarchical structures.\nOur approach derives the distance measure by generating tailored projections\nand curvatures for each pair of data points, effectively mapping them to an\nappropriate hyperbolic space. We introduce a revised low-rank decomposition\nscheme and a hard-pair mining mechanism to mitigate the computational cost of\npair-wise distance computation without compromising accuracy. We present an\nupper bound on the low-rank approximation error using Talagrand's concentration\ninequality, ensuring theoretical robustness. Extensive experiments on standard\nimage classification (MNIST, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100), hierarchical\nclassification (5-level CIFAR-100), and few-shot learning tasks (mini-ImageNet,\ntiered-ImageNet) demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

While\nwritten GEC is well-established, spoken GEC (SGEC), aiming to provide feedback\nbased on learners' speech, poses additional challenges due to disfluencies,\ntranscription errors, and the lack of structured input. SGEC systems typically\nfollow a cascaded pipeline consisting of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR),\ndisfluency detection, and GEC, making them vulnerable to error propagation\nacross modules. This work examines an End-to-End (E2E) framework for SGEC and\nfeedback generation, highlighting challenges and possible solutions when\ndeveloping these systems. Cascaded, partial-cascaded and E2E architectures are\ncompared, all built on the Whisper foundation model. A challenge for E2E\nsystems is the scarcity of GEC labeled spoken data. To address this, an\nautomatic pseudo-labeling framework is examined, increasing the training data\nfrom 77 to over 2500 hours. To improve the accuracy of the SGEC system,\nadditional contextual information, exploiting the ASR output, is investigated.\nCandidate feedback of their mistakes is an essential step to improving\nperformance. In E2E systems the SGEC output must be compared with an estimate\nof the fluent transcription to obtain the feedback. To improve the precision of\nthis feedback, a novel reference alignment process is proposed that aims to\nremove hypothesised edits that results from fluent transcription errors.\nFinally, these approaches are combined with an edit confidence estimation\napproach, to exclude low-confidence edits.

    "abstract": "We propose a hyperbolic set-to-set distance measure for computing\ndissimilarity between sets in hyperbolic space. While point-to-point distances\nin hyperbolic space effectively capture hierarchical relationships between data\npoints, many real-world applications require comparing sets of hyperbolic data\npoints, where the local structure and the global structure of the sets carry\ncrucial semantic information. The proposed the \\underline{h}yperbolic\n\\underline{s}et-\\underline{to}-\\underline{s}et \\underline{d}istance measure\n(HS2SD) integrates both global and local structural information: global\nstructure through geodesic distances between Einstein midpoints of hyperbolic\nsets, and local structure through topological characteristics of the two sets.\nTo efficiently compute topological differences, we prove that using a finite\nThue-Morse sequence of degree and adjacency matrices can serve as a robust\napproximation to capture the topological structure of a set. In this case, by\nconsidering the topological differences, HS2SD provides a more nuanced\nunderstanding of the relationships between two hyperbolic sets. Empirical\nevaluation on entity matching, standard image classification, and few-shot\nimage classification demonstrates that our distance measure outperforms\nexisting methods by effectively modeling the hierarchical and complex\nrelationships inherent in hyperbolic sets.",

    "abstract": "Fifth generation district heating and cooling (5GDHC) networks accelerate the\nuse of renewable energies in the heating sector and enable flexible, efficient\nand future-proof heating and cooling supply via a single network. Due to their\nlow temperature level and high integration of renewables, 5GDHC systems pose\nnew challenges for the modeling of these networks in order to simulate and test\noperational strategies. A particular feature is the use of uninsulated pipes,\nwhich allow energy exchange with the surrounding ground. Accurate modeling of\nthis interaction is essential for reliable simulation and optimization. This\npaper presents a thermp-physical model of the pip connections, the surrounding\nsoil, a latent heat storage in the form of an ice storage as a seasonal heat\nstorage and the house transfer stations. The model is derived from mass and\nenergy balances leading to ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Validation\nis performed using field date from the 5GDHC network in Gutach-Bleibach,\nGermany, which supplies heating and cooling to 30 modern buildings. With an\naverage model deviation of 4.5 % in the normalized mean bias error (NMBE) and\n15.9 % in the coefficient of the variation of the root mean square error\n(CVRMSE), the model's accuracy is validated against the available temperature\nmeasurements. The realistic representation of the thermal-hydraulic\ninteractions between soil and pipes, as well as the heat flow within the\nnetwork, confirms the accuracy of the model and its applicability for the\nsimulation of 5GDHC systems. The model is made openly accessible under an\nopen-source license.",

The primary challenges involve maintaining consistency across\nmultiple views and effectively synthesizing shapes and textures under diverse\nconditions. In this paper, we propose the Multi-View Auto-Regressive\n(\\textbf{MV-AR}) method, which leverages an auto-regressive model to\nprogressively generate consistent multi-view images from arbitrary prompts.\nFirstly, the next-token-prediction capability of the AR model significantly\nenhances its effectiveness in facilitating progressive multi-view synthesis.\nWhen generating widely-separated views, MV-AR can utilize all its preceding\nviews to extract effective reference information. Subsequently, we propose a\nunified model that accommodates various prompts via architecture designing and\ntraining strategies. To address multiple conditions, we introduce condition\ninjection modules for text, camera pose, image, and shape. To manage\nmulti-modal conditions simultaneously, a progressive training strategy is\nemployed. This strategy initially adopts the text-to-multi-view (t2mv) model as\na baseline to enhance the development of a comprehensive X-to-multi-view (X2mv)\nmodel through the randomly dropping and combining conditions. Finally, to\nalleviate the overfitting problem caused by limited high-quality data, we\npropose the ``Shuffle View\" data augmentation technique, thus significantly\nexpanding the training data by several magnitudes.

Compared to rigid link robots, CDPRs provide better\nmaneuverability due to the flexibility of the cables and consume lesser power\ndue to the high strength-to-weight ratio of the cables. However, amongst other\nthings, the flexibility of the cables and the fact that they can only pull (and\nnot push) render the dynamics of CDPRs complex.

We discuss potential applications\nof federated learning in several fields of chemical engineering, from the\nmolecular to the process scale. In addition, we apply federated learning in two\nexemplary case studies that simulate practical scenarios of multiple chemical\ncompanies holding proprietary data sets: (i) prediction of binary mixture\nactivity coefficients with graph neural networks and (ii) system identification\nof a distillation column with autoencoders. Our results indicate that ML models\njointly trained with federated learning yield significantly higher accuracy\nthan models trained by each chemical company individually and can perform\nsimilarly to models trained on combined datasets from all companies.

We used simulated SNe and a standard image subtraction method to\ndetermine limiting detection magnitudes for the data set.

Lastly, we combined these\nprobabilities with the intrinsic CCSN rates of the sample galaxies estimated\nbased on their detailed radiative transfer modeling to derive the fraction of\nundetectable CCSNe in local LIRGs.

    "abstract": "In networked control systems, communication resource constraints often\nnecessitate the use of \\emph{sparse} control input vectors. A prototypical\nproblem is how to ensure controllability of a linear dynamical system when only\na limited number of actuators (inputs) can be active at each time step. In this\nwork, we first present an algorithm for determining the \\emph{sparse actuator\nschedule}, i.e., the sequence of supports of the input vectors that ensures\ncontrollability. Next, we extend the algorithm to minimize the average control\nenergy by simultaneously minimizing the trace of the controllability Gramian,\nunder the sparsity constraints. We derive theoretical guarantees for both\nalgorithms: the first algorithm ensures controllability with a minimal number\nof control inputs at a given sparsity level; for the second algorithm, we\nderive an upper bound on the average control energy under the resulting\nactuator schedule. Finally, we develop a novel sparse controller based on\nKalman filtering and sparse signal recovery that drives the system to a desired\nstate in the presence of process and measurement noise. We also derive an upper\nbound on the steady-state MSE attained by the algorithm. We corroborate our\ntheoretical results using numerical simulations and illustrate that sparse\ncontrol achieves a control performance comparable to the fully actuated\nsystems.",

    "abstract": "In a world of increasing policy uncertainty, central banks are relying more\non soft information sources to complement traditional economic statistics and\nmodel-based forecasts. One valuable source of soft information comes from\nintelligence gathered through central bank liaison programs -- structured\nprograms in which central bank staff regularly talk with firms to gather\ninsights. This paper introduces a new text analytics and retrieval tool that\nefficiently processes, organises, and analyses liaison intelligence gathered\nfrom firms using modern natural language processing techniques. The textual\ndataset spans 25 years, integrates new information as soon as it becomes\navailable, and covers a wide range of business sizes and industries. The tool\nuses both traditional text analysis techniques and powerful language models to\nprovide analysts and researchers with three key capabilities: (1) quickly\nquerying the entire history of business liaison meeting notes; (2) zooming in\non particular topics to examine their frequency (topic exposure) and analysing\nthe associated tone and uncertainty of the discussion; and (3) extracting\nprecise numerical values from the text, such as firms' reported figures for\nwages and prices growth. We demonstrate how these capabilities are useful for\nassessing economic conditions by generating text-based indicators of wages\ngrowth and incorporating them into a nowcasting model. We find that adding\nthese text-based features to current best-in-class predictive models, combined\nwith the use of machine learning methods designed to handle many predictors,\nsignificantly improves the performance of nowcasts for wages growth. Predictive\ngains are driven by a small number of features, indicating a sparse signal in\ncontrast to other predictive problems in macroeconomics, where the signal is\ntypically dense.",

Advances in\ninformation theory have introduced several quantities to describe complex\ninformation structures, where collective patterns of coordination emerge from\nhigh-order (i.e. beyond-pairwise) interdependencies. Unfortunately, the use of\nthese approaches to study large neural systems is severely hindered by the poor\nscalability of existing techniques. Moreover, there are relatively few measures\nspecifically designed for multivariate time series data. Here we introduce a\nnovel measure of information about macroscopic structures, termed\nM-information, which quantifies the high-order integration of information in\ncomplex dynamical systems. We show that M-information can be calculated via a\nconvex optimisation problem, and we derive a robust and efficient algorithm\nthat scales gracefully with system size. Our analyses show that M-information\nis resilient to noise, indexes critical behaviour in artificial neuronal\npopulations, and reflects task performance in real-world mouse brain activity\ndata. Furthermore, M-information can be incorporated into existing information\ndecomposition frameworks to reveal a comprehensive taxonomy of information\ndynamics. Taken together, these results help us unravel collective computation\nin complex neural systems.",

However, despite their success in accelerating atomistic\nsimulations, NIPs face challenges in directly predicting electronic properties\nand often require coupling to higher-scale models or extensive simulations for\nmacroscopic properties. Machine learning (ML) offers alternatives for\nstructure-to-property mapping but faces trade-offs: feature-based methods often\nlack generalizability, while deep neural networks require significant data and\ncomputational power. To address these trade-offs, we introduce HackNIP, a\ntwo-stage pipeline that leverages pretrained NIPs.

This study investigates whether such a\nhybridization approach, by ``hacking\" the NIP, can outperform end-to-end deep\nneural networks, determines the dataset size at which this transfer learning\napproach surpasses direct fine-tuning of the NIP, and identifies which NIP\nembedding depths yield the most informative features.

While effective in balanced settings, conventional KD suffers\nsignificantly when applied to long-tailed data distributions, as the teacher\nmodel tends to be biased toward head classes and provides limited supervision\nfor tail classes. In this paper, we propose Long-Tailed Knowledge Distillation\n(LTKD), a novel framework tailored for class-imbalanced scenarios. We begin by\nreformulating the standard KD objective into two components: inter-group and\nintra-group Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, corresponding to the prediction\ndistributions across and within class groups (head, medium, tail),\nrespectively. This decomposition allows us to identify and quantify the sources\nof teacher bias. To address them, we introduce (1) a rebalanced inter-group\nloss that calibrates the teacher's group-level predictions and (2) a uniform\nintra-group loss that ensures equal contribution from all groups during\ndistillation. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100-LT, TinyImageNet-LT, and\nImageNet-LT show that LTKD consistently outperforms existing KD methods,\nachieving significant gains in both overall accuracy and tail-class\nperformance.

By analyzing how\nelements of arbitrary subsets are distributed among the faces of the cube\nE_q^n, we discover new combinatorial identities with geometric significance. We\nprove that for any subset A contained in E_2^n, the rank function satisfies\nrefined bounds that lead to exact computations for small cardinalities.\nSpecifically, we show that for odd cardinalities, the lower bound is\n4D_A/(|A|^2-1) where D_A is the sum of all pairwise Hamming distances in A. Our\nmain theorem establishes identities connecting the number of k-dimensional\nfaces containing exactly e elements of a subset to binomial sums over all\nsubsets of specified cardinality. This yields a parametric family of identities\nwhere classical results emerge as special cases. As applications, we derive a\ngeometric interpretation of Vandermonde's identity by examining faces of\nq-valued cubes, revealing that this classical result naturally arises from\ncounting element distributions. We also obtain a completely new identity for\neven-weight vectors: (2^(k-1) - 1) times 2^(n-1) times binomial(n,k) equals the\nsum over i from 1 to floor(n/2) of binomial(n,2i) times binomial(n-2i,k-2i).\nThis identity, valid for all 1 <= k <= n, demonstrates how geometric\nperspectives can uncover hidden combinatorial relationships.

To date, the seminal\nwork of Roundy (1985, 1986) and Jackson et al. (1985) remains unsurpassed in\nefficiently developing provably-good dynamic policies in this context.\n  The principal contribution of this paper consists in developing a wide range\nof algorithmic ideas and analytical insights around the continuous-time joint\nreplenishment problem, culminating in a deterministic framework for efficiently\napproximating optimal dynamic policies to any desired level of accuracy. These\nadvances enable us to derive a compactly-encoded replenishment policy whose\nlong-run average cost is within factor $1 + \\epsilon$ of the dynamic optimum,\narriving at an efficient polynomial-time approximation scheme (EPTAS).\nTechnically speaking, our approach hinges on affirmative resolutions to two\nfundamental open questions:\n  -- We devise the first efficient discretization-based framework for\napproximating the joint replenishment problem. Specifically, we prove that\nevery continuous-time infinite-horizon instance can be reduced to a\ncorresponding discrete-time $O( \\frac{ n^3 }{ \\epsilon^6 } )$-period instance,\nwhile incurring a multiplicative optimality loss of at most $1 + \\epsilon$.\n  -- Motivated by this relation, we substantially improve on the $O(\n2^{2^{O(1/\\epsilon)}} \\cdot (nT)^{ O(1) } )$-time approximation scheme of\nNonner and Sviridenko (2013) for the discrete-time joint replenishment problem.\nBeyond an exponential improvement in running time, we demonstrate that\nrandomization and hierarchical decompositions can be entirely avoided, while\nconcurrently offering a relatively simple analysis.",

    "abstract": "Virtual staining is a promising technique that uses deep generative models to\nrecreate histological stains, providing a faster and more cost-effective\nalternative to traditional tissue chemical staining. Specifically for H&E-HER2\nstaining transfer, despite a rising trend in publications, the lack of\nsufficient public datasets has hindered progress in the topic. Additionally, it\nis currently unclear which model frameworks perform best for this particular\ntask. In this paper, we introduce the HER2match dataset, the first publicly\navailable dataset with the same breast cancer tissue sections stained with both\nH&E and HER2. Furthermore, we compare the performance of several Generative\nAdversarial Networks (GANs) and Diffusion Models (DMs), and implement a novel\nBrownian Bridge Diffusion Model for H&E-HER2 translation. Our findings indicate\nthat, overall, GANs perform better than DMs, with only the BBDM achieving\ncomparable results. Furthermore, we emphasize the importance of data alignment,\nas all models trained on HER2match produced vastly improved visuals compared to\nthe widely used consecutive-slide BCI dataset. This research provides a new\nhigh-quality dataset ([available upon publication acceptance]), improving both\nmodel training and evaluation. In addition, our comparison of frameworks offers\nvaluable guidance for researchers working on the topic.",

    "abstract": "A direct interaction between dark energy and dark matter provides a natural\nand important extension to the standard $\\Lambda$CDM cosmology. We perform a\nnon-parametric reconstruction of the vacuum energy ($w=-1$) interacting with\ncold dark matter using the cosmological data from DESI DR2, Planck CMB, and\nthree SNIa samples (PP, DESY5, and Union3). By discretizing the coupling\nfunction $\\beta(z)$ into 20 redshift bins and assuming a Gaussian smoothness\nprior, we reconstruct $\\beta(z)$ without assuming any specific\nparameterization. The mean reconstructed $\\beta(z)$ changes sign during cosmic\nevolution, indicating an energy transfer from cold dark matter to dark energy\nat early times and a reverse flow at late times. At high redshifts, $\\beta(z)$\nshows a $\\sim 2\\sigma$ deviation from $\\Lambda$CDM. At low redshifts, the\nresults depend on the SNIa sample: CMB+DESI and CMB+DESI+PP yield $\\beta(z)$\nconsistent with zero within $2\\sigma$, while CMB+DESI+DESY5 and CMB+DESI+Union3\nprefer negative $\\beta$ at $\\sim2\\sigma$. Both $\\chi^2$ tests and Bayesian\nanalyses favor the $\\beta(z)$ model, with CMB+DESI DR2+DESY5 showing the most\nsignificant support through the largest improvement in goodness of fit\n($\\Delta\\chi^2_{\\rm MAP}=-17.76$) and strongest Bayesian evidence\n($\\ln\\mathcal{B} = 5.98 \\pm 0.69$). Principal component analysis reveals that\nthe data effectively constrain three additional degrees of freedom in the\n$\\beta(z)$ model, accounting for most of the improvement in goodness of fit.\nOur results demonstrate that the dynamical dark energy preference in current\ndata can be equally well explained by such a sign-reversal interacting dark\nenergy, highlighting the need for future observations to break this degeneracy.",

An intriguing challenge arises when agents\ninteract with the world as a dynamic data stream and ad-hoc queries from users:\nsupporting knowledge for queries, namely evidence, usually appears\nasynchronously with the arrival time of queries, and agents need to ground\ntheir responses in historical data, present observations, and even future\nstreams. We frame this challenge as Query-Evidence Asynchrony, where user\nqueries and their supporting evidence typically arrive asynchronously in the\nstreaming setting. This setting requires not only strong reasoning capabilities\nbut also the ability to retain past observations and respond to queries with\ntemporal awareness. In this paper, we introduce a diagnostic benchmark that\nevaluates Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) on their ability to handle\ninteraction with streaming data. Further, we present AViLA, Asynchronous\nVideo-Language Agent for streaming data interaction that can handle ad-hoc\nqueries and give time-aware responses. For this purpose, AViLA consists of\nthree key modules: comprehensive memory retention, evidence identification, and\nevidence-grounded trigger, that are designed to maintain a general-purpose\nmemory and respond readily and timely to queries. Our experiments show that\nexisting models often fail to respond at appropriate times, while AViLA\nsignificantly improves both accuracy and temporal awareness.

Here, we present an atomistic simulation method where\nthe motion of vacancies is accelerated, while the fast degrees of freedom are\npropagated with standard molecular dynamics. The resulting method is free of\nadjustable parameters and can predict microstructural evolution under\nirradiation at elevated temperatures. Simulating the microstructural evolution\nof tungsten under irradiation at dose rates of $10^{-5}$, $10^{-4}$, and\n$10^{-3}$ dpa/second, we find that increasing the temperature or reducing the\ndose rate primarily results in a reduction of the steady-state defect\nconcentration, in qualitative agreement with deuterium retention and\npost-irradiation resistivity recovery experiments. The formation of a nanoscale\nvoid is observed if a system initially containing a large dislocation loop is\nirradiated.

We formalize the key elements involved in protection\ndecision-making - including code artifacts, assets, security requirements,\nattacks, and software protections - and frame the protection process through a\ngame-theoretic model. In this model, a defender strategically applies\nprotections to various code artifacts of a target application, anticipating\nrepeated attack attempts by adversaries against the confidentiality and\nintegrity of the application's assets. The selection of the optimal defense\nmaximizes resistance to attacks while ensuring the application remains usable\nby constraining the overhead introduced by protections. The game is solved\nthrough a heuristic based on a mini-max depth-first exploration strategy,\naugmented with dynamic programming optimizations for improved efficiency.\nCentral to our formulation is the introduction of the Software Protection\nIndex, an original contribution that extends existing notions of potency and\nresilience by evaluating protection effectiveness against attack paths using\nsoftware metrics and expert assessments.

    "abstract": "Hill's specificity criterion has been highly influential in biomedical and\nepidemiological research. However, it remains controversial and its application\noften relies on subjective and qualitative analysis without a comprehensive and\nrigorous causal theory. Focusing on unmeasured confounding adjustment with\nmultiple treatments and multiple outcomes, this paper develops a formal and\nquantitative framework for leveraging specificity for causal inference in\nobservational studies. The proposed framework introduces a causal specificity\nassumption, a quantitative measure of specificity, a hypothesis testing\nprocedure, and identification and estimation strategies. Identification under a\nnonparametric outcome model is established. The causal specificity assumption\nconcerns only the breadth of causal associations, in contrast to Hill's\nspecificity that concerns observed associations and to existing confounding\nadjustment methods that rely on auxiliary variables (e.g., instrumental\nvariables, negative controls) or independence structures (e.g., factor models).\nA sensitivity analysis procedure is proposed to assess robustness of the test\nagainst violations of this assumption. This framework is particularly suited to\nexposure- and outcome-wide studies, where joint causal discovery across\nmultiple treatments and multiple outcomes is of interest. It also offers a\npotential tool for addressing other sources of bias, such as invalid\ninstruments in Mendelian randomization and selection bias in missing data\nanalysis.",

Although\npredictive AI can process large alert volumes and identify known patterns, it\nstruggles with novel and evolving scenarios that demand contextual\nunderstanding and nuanced judgement. A promising solution is Human-AI teaming\n(HAT), which combines human expertise with AI's computational capabilities.\nLearning to Defer (L2D) operationalises HAT by enabling AI to \"defer\" uncertain\nor unfamiliar cases to human experts. However, traditional L2D models rely on\nstatic deferral policies that do not evolve with experience, limiting their\nability to learn from human feedback and adapt over time. To overcome this, we\nintroduce Learning to Defer with Human Feedback (L2DHF), an adaptive deferral\nframework that leverages Deep Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback\n(DRLHF) to optimise deferral decisions. By dynamically incorporating human\nfeedback, L2DHF continuously improves AP accuracy and reduces unnecessary\ndeferrals, enhancing SOC effectiveness and easing analyst workload. Experiments\non two widely used benchmark datasets, UNSW-NB15 and CICIDS2017, demonstrate\nthat L2DHF significantly outperforms baseline models. Notably, it achieves\n13-16% higher AP accuracy for critical alerts on UNSW-NB15 and 60-67% on\nCICIDS2017. It also reduces misprioritisations, for example, by 98% for\nhigh-category alerts on CICIDS2017. Moreover, L2DHF decreases deferrals, for\nexample, by 37% on UNSW-NB15, directly reducing analyst workload.

Their X-ray emission is\nsimulated for the hot ICM gas phase, the entire Warm-Hot medium, the diffuse\nand low-density Warm-Hot Intergalactic Medium (WHIM). Inside clusters, the soft\nexcess appears to be produced by substructures of the WARM gas phase which host\ndense warm clumps (i.e, the Warm Circum-Galactic Medium, WCGM), and in fact the\ninner soft excess is strongly correlated with substructure and WCGM mass\nfractions. Outside of the virial radius, the fraction of WHIM gas that is\nmostly inside filaments connected to clusters boosts the soft X-ray excess. The\nmore diffuse the gas is, the higher the soft X-ray excess beyond the virial\nregion. The thermal emission of WARM gas phase, in the form of WCGM clumps and\nWHIM diffuse filaments, reproduces well the soft excess emission that was\nobserved up to the virial radius in Coma and in the inner regions of other\nmassive clusters.

Baseline evaluations\nunderscore the task's complexity, with the leading reasoning model O3-Mini\nachieving only 38.87% success rate on BIRD-CRITIC-PG and 33.33% on\nBIRD-CRITIC-Multi. Meanwhile, advancing open-source models for database tasks\nis crucial for empowering local development while safeguarding data privacy.\nTherefore, we present Six-Gym (Sql-fIX-Gym), a training environment for\nelevating open-source model capabilities for SQL issue debugging. This\nenvironment leverages SQL-Rewind strategy, which automatically generates\nexecutable issue-solution datasets by reverse-engineering issues from verified\nSQLs. However, popular trajectory-based fine-tuning methods do not explore\nsubstantial supervisory signals. We further propose f-Plan Boosting, which\nextracts high-level debugging plans from SQL solutions, enabling teacher LLMs\nto produce 73.7% more successful trajectories for training.

However, existing approaches face two\nkey challenges. First, they often struggle to interpret complex text\ninstructions or operate ineffectively in densely cluttered environments.\nSecond, most methods require a training or finetuning step to adapt to new\ndomains, limiting their generation in real-world applications. In this paper,\nwe introduce GraspMAS, a new multi-agent system framework for language-driven\ngrasp detection. GraspMAS is designed to reason through ambiguities and improve\ndecision-making in real-world scenarios. Our framework consists of three\nspecialized agents: Planner, responsible for strategizing complex queries;\nCoder, which generates and executes source code; and Observer, which evaluates\nthe outcomes and provides feedback. Intensive experiments on two large-scale\ndatasets demonstrate that our GraspMAS significantly outperforms existing\nbaselines. Additionally, robot experiments conducted in both simulation and\nreal-world settings further validate the effectiveness of our approach.

The proofs apply in the cases of targets centred at\ntypical points of the self-similar set, with respect to any Bernoulli measure\non it.

    "abstract": "The low-rank matrix completion problem asks whether a given real matrix with\nmissing values can be completed so that the resulting matrix has low rank or is\nclose to a low-rank matrix. The completed matrix is often required to satisfy\nadditional structural constraints, such as positive semi-definiteness or a\nbounded infinity norm. The problem arises in various research fields, including\nmachine learning, statistics, and theoretical computer science, and has broad\nreal-world applications.\n  This paper presents new $\\mathsf{NP} $-hardness results for low-rank matrix\ncompletion problems. We show that for every sufficiently large integer $d$ and\nany real number $\\varepsilon \\in [ 2^{-O(d)},\\frac{1}{7}]$, given a partial\nmatrix $A$ with exposed values of magnitude at most $1$ that admits a positive\nsemi-definite completion of rank $d$, it is $\\mathsf{NP}$-hard to find a\npositive semi-definite matrix that agrees with each given value of $A$ up to an\nadditive error of at most $\\varepsilon$, even when the rank is allowed to\nexceed $d$ by a multiplicative factor of $O (\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon ^2 \\cdot\n\\log(1/\\varepsilon)} )$. This strengthens a result of Hardt, Meka, Raghavendra,\nand Weitz (COLT, 2014), which applies to multiplicative factors smaller than\n$2$ and to $\\varepsilon $ that decays polynomially in $d$. We establish similar\n$\\mathsf{NP}$-hardness results for the case where the completed matrix is\nconstrained to have a bounded infinity norm (rather than be positive\nsemi-definite), for which all previous hardness results rely on complexity\nassumptions related to the Unique Games Conjecture. Our proofs involve a novel\nnotion of nearly orthonormal representations of graphs, the concept of line\ndigraphs, and bounds on the rank of perturbed identity matrices.",

    "abstract": "Model editing offers a low-cost technique to inject or correct a particular\nbehavior in a pre-trained model without extensive retraining, supporting\napplications such as factual correction and bias mitigation. Despite this\ncommon practice, it remains unknown whether edits persist after fine-tuning or\nwhether they are inadvertently reversed. This question has fundamental\npractical implications. For example, if fine-tuning removes prior edits, it\ncould serve as a defence mechanism against hidden malicious edits. Vice versa,\nthe unintended removal of edits related to bias mitigation could pose serious\nsafety concerns. We systematically investigate the interaction between model\nediting and fine-tuning in the context of T2I diffusion models, which are known\nto exhibit biases and generate inappropriate content. Our study spans two T2I\nmodel families (Stable Diffusion and FLUX), two sota editing techniques, and\nthree fine-tuning methods (DreamBooth, LoRA, and DoRA). Through an extensive\nempirical analysis across diverse editing tasks and evaluation metrics, our\nfindings reveal a trend: edits generally fail to persist through fine-tuning,\neven when fine-tuning is tangential or unrelated to the edits. Notably, we\nobserve that DoRA exhibits the strongest edit reversal effect. At the same\ntime, among editing methods, UCE demonstrates greater robustness, retaining\nsignificantly higher efficacy post-fine-tuning compared to ReFACT. These\nfindings highlight a crucial limitation in current editing methodologies,\nemphasizing the need for more robust techniques to ensure reliable long-term\ncontrol and alignment of deployed AI systems.

    "abstract": "The finite element method (FEM) is a well-established numerical method for\nsolving partial differential equations (PDEs). However, its mesh-based nature\ngives rise to substantial computational costs, especially for complex\nmultiscale simulations. Emerging machine learning-based methods (e.g., neural\noperators) provide data-driven solutions to PDEs, yet they present challenges,\nincluding high training cost and low model reusability. Here, we propose the\nneural-operator element method (NOEM) by synergistically combining FEM with\noperator learning to address these challenges. NOEM leverages neural operators\n(NOs) to simulate subdomains where a large number of finite elements would be\nrequired if FEM was used. In each subdomain, an NO is used to build a single\nelement, namely a neural-operator element (NOE).

Finsler\ngeometry generalizes Riemannian geometry by allowing the metric tensor to\ndepend on position and an additional internal degree of freedom, typically\nrepresented by a vector field at each point of the spacetime manifold. We\nexplore whether Finsler-type geometries can describe gravitational interaction\nand cosmological dynamics. In particular, we examine the Barthel connection and\n$(\\alpha, \\beta)$ geometries, where $\\alpha$ is a Riemannian metric and $\\beta$\nis a one-form. For a specific construction of $\\beta$, the Barthel connection\ncoincides with the Levi-Civita connection of the associated Riemann metric. We\nreview gravitational field and cosmological evolution in three geometries:\nBarthel-Randers ($F = \\alpha + \\beta$), Barthel-Kropina ($F = \\alpha^2 \\beta$),\nand the conformally transformed Barthel-Kropina geometry. After presenting the\nmathematical foundations of Finslerian-type modified gravity theories, we\nderive generalized Friedmann equations in these geometries assuming a\nFriedmann-Lema\\^itre-Robertson-Walker type metric.

Traditional\nwireless receivers have relied on mathematical modeling and Bayesian inference,\nachieving remarkable success in most areas but falling short in their ability\nto characterize channel matrices. Neural networks (NNs) have demonstrated\nsignificant potential in this aspect. Nevertheless, integrating traditional\ninference methods with NNs presents challenges, particularly in tracking the\nerror progression. Given the inevitable presence of noise in wireless systems,\ngenerative models that are more resilient to noise are garnering increased\nattention. In this paper, we propose re-evaluating the MIMO-OFDM receiver using\ndiffusion models, which is a common generative approach. With diffusion models,\nwe can effectively leverage prior knowledge of channel matrices and incorporate\ntraditional signal estimation components. Specifically, we explore the\ndiffusion system and introduce an imagination-screening strategy to guide the\ndiffusion process. Furthermore, diffusion models enable adaptation to varying\nnoise levels and pilot schemes using the same NN, significantly reducing\ntraining and deployment costs. Simulated results reveal that, for pilot\ndensities ranging from 4-6 pilots per 64-subcarrier block and signal-to-noise\nratios (SNRs) from -4 dB to 0 dB, our proposed receiver reduces\nchannel-reconstruction error by up to two times compared to leading\ndeep-learning models, with the most pronounced improvements observed in\nlow-pilot conditions.

While deep learning has advanced in skin lesion classification, most\nexisting models provide only binary outputs, offering limited clinical insight.\nThis work introduces a novel approach that extends beyond classification,\nenabling interpretable risk modelling through a Conditional Variational\nAutoencoder. The proposed method learns a structured latent space that captures\nsemantic relationships among lesions, allowing for a nuanced, continuous\nassessment of morphological differences. An SVM is also trained on this\nrepresentation effectively differentiating between benign nevi and melanomas,\ndemonstrating strong and consistent performance.

Nonetheless, their\nfaint outer regions often display a break, with either a down-bending or an\nup-bending profile. Recent Euclid Early Release Observations show that\ndown-bending breaks are scarce in the Perseus cluster, as already suspected in\nVirgo. We use hydrodynamic simulations of disc galaxies interacting with a\nPerseus-like cluster. We show that Type II profiles (down-bending) can be\nrapidly eroded by the cluster tidal field on a 1 Gyr timescale, while Type III\n(up-bending) and Type I (no break) profiles remain largely unaffected. Type II\nprofiles are eroded through dynamical processes, including tidal stirring of\nstars by the cluster potential and triggering of star formation in the outer\ndisc. Our simulations show that observations of disc breaks across environments\nand cosmic epochs are consistent with a coherent evolutionary picture. At high\nredshift, JWST reveals early break structures in isolated environments. At low\nredshift, field disc galaxies retain these breaks, while dense clusters, as\nobserved by Euclid in Perseus, show significant alterations. Our findings\nsupport a scenario in which down-bending profiles result from internal\nprocesses during early formation phases and are later modified by environmental\neffects in clusters. This interpretation does not require additional mechanisms\nsuch as ram-pressure stripping or star formation threshold variations to\nexplain the observed evolution of down-bending breaks.",

    "abstract": "Strong both broad and narrow emission lines from central broad emission line\nregions (BLRs) and narrow emission line regions (NLRs) are fundamental\nspectroscopic characteristics of broad line Active Galactic Nuclei (BLAGNs).\nLack of central BLRs leads to the identified true Type-2 AGNs without central\nhidden BLRs, providing clues on formation/suppression of AGN BLRs. Whether were\nthere BLAGNs with lack of central NLRs is still an open question. Here, in the\nblue quasar SDSS J1251+0613, both blue continuum emissions and broad emission\nlines can be clearly detected in its SDSS spectrum, however there are no\napparently detected narrow emission lines in the optical/NUV bands, leading to\nno central normal NLRs in the blue quasar SDSS J1251+0613. In order to explain\nthe lack of NLRs, evolving NLRs is proposed that the radial outflows are\ncarrying materials from BLRs to NLRs and the current narrow line emission\nmaterials are lying closer to the outer side of central BLRs in SDSS\nJ1521+0613. The results in this manuscript can indicate a new unique subclass\nof BLAGNs, the BLAGNs without central normal NLRs, which will provide potential\nclues on physical origin/evolution of AGN NLRs.",

    "abstract": "Rug pull scams have emerged as a persistent threat to cryptocurrency, causing\nsignificant financial losses. A typical scenario involves scammers deploying\nhoneypot contracts to attract investments, restricting token sales, and\ndraining the funds, which leaves investors with worthless tokens. Current\nmethods either rely on predefined patterns to detect code risks or utilize\nstatistical transaction data to train detection models. However, real-world Rug\nPull schemes often involve a complex interplay between malicious code and\nsuspicious transaction behaviors. These methods, which solely focus on one\naspect, fall short in detecting such schemes effectively.\n  In this paper, we propose RPHunter, a novel technique that integrates code\nand transaction for Rug Pull detection. First, RPHunter establishes declarative\nrules and performs flow analysis to extract code risk information, further\nconstructing a semantic risk code graph (SRCG). Meanwhile, to leverage\ntransaction information, RPHunter formulates dynamic token transaction\nactivities as a token flow behavior graph (TFBG) in which nodes and edges are\ncharacterized from network structure and market manipulation perspectives.\nFinally, RPHunter employs graph neural networks to extract complementary\nfeatures from SRCG and TFBG, integrating them through an attention fusion model\nto enhance the detection of Rug Pull. We manually analyzed 645 Rug Pull\nincidents from code and transaction aspects and constructed a ground-truth\ndataset. We evaluated RPHunter on our dataset, achieving a precision of 95.3%,\na recall of 93.8% and an F1 score of 94.5%, which highlights superior\nperformance compared to existing methods. Furthermore, when applied to the\nreal-world scenarios, RPHunter has identified 4801 Rug Pull tokens, achieving a\nprecision of 90.7%.",

    "abstract": "Existing autoregressive large-scale text-to-speech (TTS) models have\nadvantages in speech naturalness, but their token-by-token generation mechanism\nmakes it difficult to precisely control the duration of synthesized speech.\nThis becomes a significant limitation in applications requiring strict\naudio-visual synchronization, such as video dubbing. This paper introduces\nIndexTTS2, which proposes a novel, general, and autoregressive model-friendly\nmethod for speech duration control. The method supports two generation modes:\none explicitly specifies the number of generated tokens to precisely control\nspeech duration; the other freely generates speech in an autoregressive manner\nwithout specifying the number of tokens, while faithfully reproducing the\nprosodic features of the input prompt. Furthermore, IndexTTS2 achieves\ndisentanglement between emotional expression and speaker identity, enabling\nindependent control over timbre and emotion. In the zero-shot setting, the\nmodel can accurately reconstruct the target timbre (from the timbre prompt)\nwhile perfectly reproducing the specified emotional tone (from the style\nprompt). To enhance speech clarity in highly emotional expressions, we\nincorporate GPT latent representations and design a novel three-stage training\nparadigm to improve the stability of the generated speech. Additionally, to\nlower the barrier for emotional control, we designed a soft instruction\nmechanism based on text descriptions by fine-tuning Qwen3, effectively guiding\nthe generation of speech with the desired emotional orientation. Finally,\nexperimental results on multiple datasets show that IndexTTS2 outperforms\nstate-of-the-art zero-shot TTS models in terms of word error rate, speaker\nsimilarity, and emotional fidelity.

These errors frequently serve as\nvectors for severe vulnerabilities, while their repair requires extensive\nknowledge of program logic and C's memory model. Automated Program Repair (APR)\nhas emerged as a critical research area to address these challenges.\nTraditional APR approaches rely on expert-designed strategies and predefined\ntemplates, which are labor-intensive and constrained by the effectiveness of\nmanual specifications.

Current\napproaches to this problem still rely heavily on manual computations, which are\nhighly prone to errors due to the intricate nature of the underlying\ncalculations. To date, no efficient algorithm implemented in any computer\nalgebra system has been made publicly available to tackle this problem in a\nsystematic manner.\n  Motivated by the above, in this work, which is considered as Part I of our\nproject, we first establish a criterion based entirely on linear algebra for\ndetermining whether a given homogeneous polynomial is \"hit\".

Specifically, it was shown that measurements with an array of m+1\ndetectors allows one to certify stellar rank of approximate Fock state |m>,\neven when the state is subjected to losses or certain noise. Here we address\nthe question how many click detectors are in principle required to certify high\nstellar ranks. We show that two click detectors arranged in a Hanbury\nBrown-Twiss setup suffice.

    "abstract": "Single-linkage clustering is a popular form of hierarchical agglomerative\nclustering (HAC) where the distance between two clusters is defined as the\nminimum distance between any pair of points across the two clusters. In\nsingle-linkage HAC, the output is typically the single-linkage dendrogram\n(SLD), which is the binary tree representing the hierarchy of clusters formed\nby iteratively contracting the two closest clusters. In the dynamic setting,\nprior work has only studied maintaining a minimum spanning forest over the data\nsince single-linkage HAC reduces to computing the SLD on the minimum spanning\nforest of the data.\n  In this paper, we study the problem of maintaining the SLD in the\nfully-dynamic setting. We assume the input is a dynamic forest $F$\n(representing the minimum spanning forest of the data) which receives a\nsequence of edge insertions and edge deletions. To our knowledge, no prior work\nhas provided algorithms to update an SLD asymptotically faster than recomputing\nit from scratch. All of our update algorithms are asymptotically faster than\nthe best known static SLD computation algorithm, which takes $O(n \\log h)$ time\nwhere $h$ is the height of the dendrogram ($h \\leq n-1$). Furthermore, our\nalgorithms are much faster in many cases, such as when $h$ is low. Our first\nset of results are an insertion algorithm in $O(h)$ time and a deletion\nalgorithm in $O(h \\log (1+n/h))$ time. Next, we describe parallel and\nbatch-parallel versions of these algorithms which are work-efficient or nearly\nwork-efficient and have poly-logarithmic depth. Finally, we show how to perform\ninsertions near-optimally in $O(c \\log(1+n/c))$ time, where $c$ is the number\nof structural changes in the dendrogram caused by the update, and give a\nwork-efficient parallel version of this algorithm that has polylogarithmic\ndepth.",

A channel selection function is called\nconsistent if the selected channel remains unchanged when the available channel\nset shrinks, provided the selected channel is still available. We show that all\nconsistent channel selection functions are equivalent to the function that\nalways selects the smallest-index channel under appropriate channel relabeling.\nThis leads to a natural representation of a consistent channel hopping\nalgorithm as a sequence of permutations. For the two-user MRP, we characterize\nrendezvous time slots using a fictitious user and derive tight bounds on the\nmaximum time-to-rendezvous (MTTR) and expected time-to-rendezvous (ETTR).\nNotably, the ETTR is shown to be the inverse of the Jaccard index when\npermutations are randomly selected. We also prove that consistent channel\nhopping algorithms maximize the rendezvous probability. To reduce\nimplementation complexity, we propose the modulo algorithm, which uses modular\narithmetic with one-cycle permutations and achieves performance comparable to\nlocality-sensitive hashing (LSH)-based algorithms.

    "abstract": "This paper shows that linearizing the transverse discontinuity mapping (TDM)\nin Filippov systems can produce inaccurate predictions of the dynamics in\nimpact oscillators operating near a pre-stressed soft barrier. This discrepancy\narises from the limitations of the linearized saltation matrix, which\ninaccurately predicts impacts in the local neighborhood of the discontinuity\nboundary. To address this issue, a higher-order approximation of the TDM is\nderived, which accurately captures the onset of impacts and closely matches the\nresults obtained from both numerical simulations and electronic experiments.\nThe proposed higher-order TDM results in a quadratic estimation of flight time\nfor impacts. Geometrically, real-valued impact events are only feasible when\nthe discriminant of this quadratic equation is positive. The differences in the\npredicted higher-order flight times and mapping estimates become more\npronounced for low-velocity impacts close to grazing. Subsequently, a numerical\napproximation of the higher-order saltation matrix and its consequent Floquet\nmultipliers and Lyapunov exponents for stability analysis is proposed and\ndemonstrated on a pre-stressed, forced, damped, soft impact oscillator. To\nvalidate the numerically observed discontinuity-induced bifurcations, an analog\nelectronic circuit is proposed that models a soft mechanical prestressed\noscillator. This inductor-less circuit overcomes the limitations of typical\nLCR-based circuits, which are used to design such oscillators but cannot\naccommodate low stiffness ratios. The experimentally obtained limit cycles,\nfinger-shaped Poincar\\'e sections, and bifurcation diagrams match the\npredictions of the higher-order TDM, validating that the proposed circuit\naccurately models the soft-impact oscillator for both low and high stiffness\nratios.",

Unlike conventional image\ncaptioning and retrieval datasets that focus on surface-level descriptions,\nOpenEvents V1 dataset emphasizes contextual and temporal grounding through\nthree primary tasks: (1) generating rich, event-aware image captions, (2)\nretrieving event-relevant news articles from image queries, and (3) retrieving\nevent-relevant images from narrative-style textual queries. The dataset\ncomprises over 200,000 news articles and 400,000 associated images sourced from\nCNN and The Guardian, spanning diverse domains and time periods. We provide\nextensive baseline results and standardized evaluation protocols for all tasks.\nOpenEvents V1 establishes a robust foundation for developing multimodal AI\nsystems capable of deep reasoning over complex real-world events.

    "abstract": "The overexpression of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) in\nbreast cells is a key driver of HER2-positive breast cancer, a highly\naggressive subtype requiring precise diagnosis and targeted therapy.\nImmunohistochemistry (IHC) is the standard technique for HER2 assessment but is\ncostly, labor-intensive, and highly dependent on antibody selection. In\ncontrast, hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, a routine histopathological\nprocedure, offers broader accessibility but lacks HER2 specificity. This study\nproposes an advanced deep learning-based image translation framework to\ngenerate highfidelity IHC images from H&E-stained tissue samples, enabling\ncost-effective and scalable HER2 assessment. By modifying the loss function of\npyramid pix2pix, we mitigate mode collapse, a fundamental limitation in\ngenerative adversarial networks (GANs), and introduce a novel variance-based\npenalty that enforces structural diversity in generated images. Our model\nparticularly excels in translating HER2-positive (IHC 3+) images, which have\nremained challenging for existing methods due to their complex morphological\nvariations. Extensive evaluations on the BCI histopathological dataset\ndemonstrate that our model surpasses state-of-the-art methods in terms of peak\nsignal-tonoise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity index (SSIM), and Frechet\nInception Distance (FID), particularly in accurately translating HER2-positive\n(IHC 3+) images. Beyond medical imaging, our model exhibits superior\nperformance in general image-to-image translation tasks, showcasing its\npotential across multiple domains. This work marks a significant step toward\nAI-driven precision oncology, offering a reliable and efficient alternative to\ntraditional HER2 diagnostics.",

In\nthis work, we observe that such limitations persist in existing\npost-training-based MLLM personalization methods. Specifically, despite being\npost-tuned with large-scale caption data through supervised fine-tuning (SFT),\nthese models frequently fail to produce faithful descriptions in real-world\nscenarios, such as multi-concept image captioning. However, acquiring\nlarge-scale, high-quality captions for such complex settings is both costly and\ndifficult. To address the data-centric nature of SFT, we propose a\nreinforcement learning (RL)-based post-training framework. To the best of our\nknowledge, this is the first RL-based approach to post-train MLLMs for\npersonalized image captioning. Our method significantly enhances both visual\nrecognition and personalized generation capabilities of MLLMs, and consistently\noutperforms existing SFT-based baselines, especially in the challenging\nmulti-concept image captioning task.",

Suppose there are $h\\geq1$ failed nodes\nin a rack (called the host rack). Then together with its surviving nodes, the\nhost rack downloads recovery data from $\\bar{d}$ helper racks and repairs its\nfailed nodes. In this paper, we focus on studying the rack-aware minimum\nstorage generating (MSR) codes for repairing $h$ failed nodes within the same\nrack. By using the coupled-layer construction with the alignment technique, we\nconstruct the first class of rack-aware MSR codes for all\n$\\bar{k}+1\\leq\\bar{d}\\leq\\bar{n}-1$ which achieve the small sub-packetization\n$l=\\bar{s}^{\\lceil\\bar{n}/\\bar{s}\\rceil}$ where the field size $q$ increases\nlinearly with $n$ and $\\bar{s}=\\bar{d}-\\bar{k}+1$. In addition, these codes\nachieve optimal repair bandwidth for $1\\leq h\\leq u-v$, and asymptotically\noptimal repair bandwidth for $u-v+1\\leq h\\leq u$. In particular, they achieve\noptimal access when $h=u-v$. It is worth noting that the existing rack-aware\nMSR codes which achieve the same sub-packetization\n$l=\\bar{s}^{\\lceil\\bar{n}/\\bar{s}\\rceil}$ are only known for the special case\nof $\\bar{d}=\\bar{n}-1$, $h=1$, and the field size is much larger than ours.\nThen, based on our first construction we further develop another class of\nexplicit rack-aware MSR codes with even smaller sub-packetization\n$l=\\bar{s}^{\\lceil\\bar{n}/(\\bar{s}+1)\\rceil}$ for all admissible values of\n$\\bar{d}$.",

    "abstract": "Despite growing interest in Learning-by-Teaching (LbT), few studies have\nexplored how this paradigm can be implemented with autonomous, peer-like social\nrobots in real classrooms. Most prior work has relied on scripted or\nWizard-of-Oz behaviors, limiting our understanding of how real-time,\ninteractive learning can be supported by artificial agents. This study\naddresses this gap by introducing Interactive Reinforcement Learning (RL) as a\ncognitive model for teachable social robots. We conducted two between-subject\nexperiments with 58 primary school children, who either taught a robot or\npracticed independently on a tablet while learning French vocabulary\n(memorization) and grammatical rules (inference). The robot, powered by\nInteractive RL, learned from the child's evaluative feedback. Children in the\nLbT condition achieved significantly higher retention gains compared to those\nin the self-practice condition, especially on the grammar task. Learners with\nlower prior knowledge benefited most from teaching the robot. Behavioural\nmetrics revealed that children adapted their teaching strategies over time and\nengaged more deeply during inference tasks. This work makes two contributions:\n(1) it introduces Interactive RL as a pedagogically effective and scalable\nmodel for peer-robot learning, and (2) it demonstrates, for the first time, the\nfeasibility of deploying multiple autonomous robots simultaneously in real\nclassrooms. These findings extend theoretical understanding of LbT by showing\nthat social robots can function not only as passive tutees but as adaptive\npartners that enhance meta-cognitive engagement and long-term learning\noutcomes.",

    "abstract": "Connected automated vehicles (CAVs) cruising control strategies have been\nextensively studied at the microscopic level. CAV controllers sense and react\nto traffic both upstream and downstream, yet most macroscopic models still\nassume locality, where the desired speed only depends on local density. The\nnonlocal macroscopic traffic flow models that explicitly capture the ``look\nahead'' and ``look behind'' nonlocal CAV dynamics remain underexplored. In this\npaper, we propose a Physics-informed Neural Network framework to directly learn\na macroscopic non-local flow model from a generic looking-ahead looking-behind\nvehicle motion model, which bridges the micro-macro modeling gap. We\nreconstruct macroscopic traffic states from synthetic CAV trajectories\ngenerated by the proposed microscopic control designs, and then learn a\nnon-local traffic flow model that embeds a non-local conservation law to\ncapture the resulting look-ahead look-behind dynamics. To analyze how CAV\ncontrol parameters affect nonlocal traffic flow, we conduct high-fidelity\ndriving simulator experiments to collect human drivers' trajectory data with\nvarying downstream and upstream visibility, which serves as a baseline for\ntuning CAV control gains. Our analysis validates that the learned non-local\nflow model predicts CAV traffic dynamics more accurately than local models, and\nthe fundamental diagram exhibits far less scatter in the speed - density\nrelation. We further show that the looking-ahead/looking-behind control gains\nmainly reshape the non-local kernels, while the macroscopic speed and non-local\ndensity relation mainly depends on the desired speed function choice of the CAV\ncontroller. Our results provide a systematic approach for learning non-local\nmacroscopic traffic-flow models directly from generic CAV control designs.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we study the problem of map matching with travel time\nconstraints. Given a sequence of $k$ spatio-temporal measurements and an\nembedded path graph with travel time costs, the goal is to snap each\nmeasurement to a close-by location in the graph, such that consecutive\nlocations can be reached from one another along the path within the timestamp\ndifference of the respective measurements. This problem arises in public\ntransit data processing as well as in map matching of movement trajectories to\ngeneral graphs. We show that the classical approach for this problem, which\nrelies on selecting a finite set of candidate locations in the graph for each\nmeasurement, cannot guarantee to find a consistent solution. We propose a new\nalgorithm that can deal with an infinite set of candidate locations per\nmeasurement. We prove that our algorithm always detects a consistent map\nmatching path (if one exists). Despite the enlarged candidate set, we also\ndemonstrate that our algorithm has superior running time in theory and\npractice. For a path graph with $n$ nodes, we show that our algorithm runs in\n$\\mathcal{O}(k^2 n \\log {nk})$ and under mild assumptions in $\\mathcal{O}(k n\n^\\lambda + n \\log^3 n)$ for $\\lambda \\approx 0.695$. This is a significant\nimprovement over the baseline, which runs in $\\mathcal{O}(k n^2)$ and which\nmight not even identify a correct solution. The performance of our algorithm\nhinges on an efficient segment-circle intersection data structure. We describe\nhow to design and implement such a data structure for our application.

The hexagonal crystal system and antiferromagnetic\nordering of V atoms generate a magnetic space group that enforces alternating\nspin polarization in momentum space while maintaining zero net magnetization.\nThe calculated band structure reveals robust altermagnetic signatures: along\nthe high-symmetry direction, we observe a pronounced spin splitting of ~270 meV\nwith alternating spin polarization. Crucially, the spin splitting exhibits\nminimal sensitivity to spin-orbit coupling (SOC) effect, highlighting the\ndominance of exchange interactions over relativistic effects. From Monte Carlo\nsimulations, we predict a magnetic transition temperature ($T_m$ ) of ~228 K,\nindicating stable magnetic ordering above liquid nitrogen temperatures. The\ncombination of symmetry-protected spin textures, SOC-independent splitting, and\nelevated $T_m$ temperature makes V-GICs as a promising candidate for spintronic\napplications, particularly for zero-field spin-polarized current generation and\ntopologically robust spin transport.

Leveraging the unparalleled resolution and sensitivity of\nJWST and imaging data from CEERs program, we simulate galaxies with bulge+disk\ncomponents and assess the effectiveness of single and double S\\'ersic model\nfittings, respectively. We first evaluate the performance of single S\\'ersic\nfits, and find it can recover total magnitudes (i.e., within 0.5 mag), and size\n(i.e., within 0.2 dex), down to 27 mag. The features that emerged in the\nresidual map can properly reflect the underlying two-component structures.

For double S\\'ersic models, we find comparable accuracy in\nrecovering bulge and disk magnitudes (i.e., within 0.5 mag), and effective\nradius (i.e., within 0.2 dex), down to 26 mag. To quantitatively determine\nwhether a double S\\'ersic model better describes our two-component systems\ncompared to a single S\\'ersic profile, we evaluate the Bayesian Information\nCriterion for both model configurations.

However, their enormous memory requirements make them prohibitively\nexpensive to fine-tune or deploy in resource-constrained environments. To\naddress this challenge, we introduce SlimMoE, a multi-stage compression\nframework for transforming large MoE models into much smaller, efficient\nvariants without incurring the prohibitive costs of training from scratch. Our\nmethod systematically reduces parameter counts by slimming experts and\ntransferring knowledge through intermediate stages, effectively mitigating the\nperformance degradation common in one-shot pruning approaches. Using this\nframework, we compress Phi 3.5-MoE (41.9B total/6.6B activated parameters) to\ncreate Phi-mini-MoE (7.6B total/2.4B activated parameters) and Phi-tiny-MoE\n(3.8B total/1.1B activated parameters) using only 400B tokens--less than 10% of\nthe original model's training data. These compressed models can be fine-tuned\non a single GPU (A100 for Phi-mini-MoE, A6000 for Phi-tiny-MoE), making them\nhighly suitable for academic and resource-limited settings. Our experiments\ndemonstrate that these compressed models outperform others of similar size and\nremain competitive with larger models. For instance, Phi-mini-MoE achieves\nsimilar or better performance to Phi-3-mini using only 2/3 of the activated\nparameters and yields comparable MMLU scores to Llama 3.1 8B despite having\nsignificantly lower latency. Our findings demonstrate that structured pruning\ncombined with staged distillation offers an effective path to creating\nhigh-quality, compact MoE models, paving the way for broader adoption of MoE\narchitectures.

    "abstract": "Current low-light image enhancement (LLIE) methods face significant\nlimitations in simultaneously improving brightness while preserving semantic\nconsistency, fine details, and computational efficiency. With the emergence of\nstate-space models, particularly Mamba, image restoration has achieved\nremarkable performance, yet existing visual Mamba approaches flatten 2D images\ninto 1D token sequences using fixed scanning rules, critically limiting\ninteractions between distant tokens with causal relationships and constraining\ntheir ability to capture meaningful long-range dependencies. To address these\nfundamental limitations, we propose BSMamba, a novel visual Mamba architecture\ncomprising two specially designed components: Brightness Mamba and Semantic\nMamba. The Brightness Mamba revolutionizes token interaction patterns by\nprioritizing connections between distant tokens with similar brightness levels,\neffectively addressing the challenge of brightness restoration in LLIE tasks\nthrough brightness-guided selective attention. Complementing this, the Semantic\nMamba establishes priority interactions between tokens sharing similar semantic\nmeanings, allowing the model to maintain contextual consistency by connecting\nsemantically related regions across the image, thus preserving the hierarchical\nnature of image semantics during enhancement. By intelligently modeling tokens\nbased on brightness and semantic similarity rather than arbitrary scanning\npatterns, BSMamba transcends the constraints of conventional token sequencing\nwhile adhering to the principles of causal modeling. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that BSMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance in LLIE while\npreserving semantic consistency. Code is available at\nhttps://github.com/bywlzts/BSMamba.",

A key\nchallenge is to design amorphous HfO$_2$-based high-$k$ materials with both\nstructural and performance stability. Here, using molecular dynamics\nsimulations supported by experimental measurements, we reveal that Ba doping\nstimulates a polyamorphic transition in HfO$_2$, yielding a semi-ordered\namorphous (SA) phase characterized by disordered oxygens embedded within an\nordered metal sublattice. We find that this phase arises from degenerate\nshort-range symmetry breaking modes, consistent with Pauling's parsimony rule.\nNotably, the SA structure is thermodynamically stable and displays a wider\nbandgap and higher dielectric constant than conventional random-packing\namorphous structure, owing to suppressed subgap states and increased Born\neffective charges. We further demonstrate that this structural motif\ngeneralizes to Ba-, Sr-, and Ca-doped HfO$_2$ and ZrO$_2$, establishing a\nbroadly applicable strategy for designing high-performance amorphous\ndielectrics.",

    "abstract": "While recent 3D generative models can produce high-quality texture images,\nthey often fail to capture human preferences or meet task-specific\nrequirements. Moreover, a core challenge in the 3D texture generation domain is\nthat most existing approaches rely on repeated calls to 2D text-to-image\ngenerative models, which lack an inherent understanding of the 3D structure of\nthe input 3D mesh object. To alleviate these issues, we propose an end-to-end\ndifferentiable, reinforcement-learning-free framework that embeds human\nfeedback, expressed as differentiable reward functions, directly into the 3D\ntexture synthesis pipeline. By back-propagating preference signals through both\ngeometric and appearance modules of the proposed framework, our method\ngenerates textures that respect the 3D geometry structure and align with\ndesired criteria. To demonstrate its versatility, we introduce three novel\ngeometry-aware reward functions, which offer a more controllable and\ninterpretable pathway for creating high-quality 3D content from natural\nlanguage. By conducting qualitative, quantitative, and user-preference\nevaluations against state-of-the-art methods, we demonstrate that our proposed\nstrategy consistently outperforms existing approaches.

We employed normalisation, standardisation, as well as\nlogarithmic and power transformations paired with Bayesian hyperparameter\noptimisation and genetic algorithms. CodeBERT, a pre-trained language model for\nboth natural and programming languages, was fine-tuned to classify user dropout\ngiven their posts (questions and answers) and code snippets.

The Stochastic Gradient Descent regressor,\nfollowed by Bagging and Epsilon Support Vector Machine models, consistently\ndemonstrated superior performance to other benchmarked algorithms in predicting\nuser code quality across multiple quality dimensions and languages. Extreme\nGradient Boosting paired with log-transformation exhibited the highest F1-score\n(0.825) in predicting user dropout. CodeBERT was able to classify user dropout\nwith a final F1-score of 0.809, validating the performance of Extreme Gradient\nBoosting that was solely based on numerical data.

The quality of each speech\nsample may not be consistent across the entire duration, and it remains unclear\nwhich segments of the speech receive the primary focus from humans when\nassigning subjective evaluation for MOS calculation. We hypothesize that when\nhumans rate speech, they tend to assign more weight to low-quality speech\nsegments, and the variance in ratings for each sample is mainly due to\naccidental assignment of higher scores when overlooking the poor quality speech\nsegments.

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a theoretical framework to address the reduced\nbiquaternion equality-constrained total least squares (RBTLSE) problem. The\nobjective is to find an approximate solution to the system $AX \\approx B$,\nsubject to linear constraints $CX = D$, while explicitly accounting for errors\nin both the coefficient matrix $A$ and the observation matrix $B$. We establish\nconditions under which real and complex solutions exist and develop\ncorresponding solution methods using real and complex representations of\nreduced biquaternion matrices. To assess the sensitivity of the solutions to\ndata perturbations, we derive relative normwise condition numbers and provide\ntight upper bounds on the relative forward errors. These results ensure the\ncomputational reliability of the proposed framework. Extensive numerical\nexperiments validate the theoretical findings and demonstrate that the RBTLSE\napproach significantly outperforms the conventional reduced biquaternion\nequality-constrained least squares (RBLSE) method, particularly in noisy\nenvironments affecting both sides of the system.",

Specifically, PeepLoc works on any mobile device\nwith an unmodified Wi-Fi transceiver and in any indoor environment with a\nsufficient number of Wi-Fi access points (APs) and pedestrian traffic. At the\ncore of PeepLoc is (a) a mechanism which allows any Wi-Fi device to obtain\nnon-cooperative time-of-flight (ToF) to any Wi-Fi AP and (b) a novel\nbootstrapping mechanism that relies on pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) and\ncrowdsourcing to opportunistically initialize pre-existing APs as anchor points\nwithin an environment. We implement PeepLoc using commodity hardware and\nevaluate it extensively across 4 campus buildings. We show PeepLoc leads to a\nmean and median positional error of 3.41 m and 3.06 m respectively, which is\nsuperior to existing deployed indoor localization systems and is competitive\nwith commodity GPS in outdoor environments.",

While traditional Test-Driven Development (TDD) offers\na path for code refinement, its efficacy with LLMs is often undermined by the\nscarcity of high-quality test cases or the pitfalls of automated test\ngeneration, including biased tests or inaccurate output predictions that can\nmisdirect the correction process. This paper introduces Property-Generated\nSolver, a novel framework that leverages Property-Based Testing (PBT) to\nvalidate high-level program properties or invariants, instead of relying on\nspecific input-output examples. These properties are often simpler to define\nand verify than directly predicting exhaustive test oracles, breaking the\n\"cycle of self-deception\" where tests might share flaws with the code they are\nmeant to validate. Property-Generated Solver employs two collaborative\nLLM-based agents: a Generator dedicated to code generation and iterative\nrefinement, and a Tester that manages the PBT life-cycle and formulate\nsemantically rich feedback from property violations. The resulting\ncomprehensive and actionable feedback then guides the Generator in its\nrefinement efforts. By establishing PBT as the core validation engine within\nthis iterative, closed-loop paradigm, Property-Generated Solver provides a\nrobust mechanism for steering LLMs towards more correct and generalizable code.\nExtensive experimental results on multiple code generation benchmarks\ndemonstrate that Property-Generated Solver achieves substantial pass@1\nimprovements, ranging from 23.1% to 37.3% relative gains over established TDD\nmethods.",

The chance of rear-end collisions is closely related to drivers'\ncar-following (CF) behaviors in the traffic flow. Given that drivers may rely\non more than the information of the direct lead vehicle (DLV) when making CF\ndecisions, expanding drivers' perceptual range by providing beyond-visual-range\n(BVR) information based on vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication may enhance\nCF safety. Thus, four different human-machine interfaces (HMIs) providing\nvarious types of BVR information in CF events were designed, including\nBrake-HMI showing only brake action of indirect lead vehicles (ILV), Dis-HMI\nand THW-HMI showing the relative distance and time headway between the ILV and\nDLV, respectively, and Video-HMI showing the live-stream video of ILV from the\nperspective of DLV. A driving simulator experiment with 40 participants was\nconducted to evaluate the impact of BVR-based HMI on driving safety in CF\nevents. We found that, in general, BVR information could improve CF safety\nwithout overloading drivers and compromising their visual attention allocation\nstrategies, particularly among novice drivers, by enabling quicker brake\nresponses and increasing time headway and time-to-collision in brake events.\nThe Brake-HMI yielded the safest performance in chain brake events, whereas\nVideo-HMI increased attentional demands without observable benefits.

    "abstract": "It has been assumed that nuclear modification does not exist in the\nlongitudinal-transverse structure function ratio $R_N=F_L^N/(2xF_1^N)$ in\nlepton deep inelastic scattering. This assumption is widely used in obtaining\nstructure functions of the ``nucleon\" from nuclear data such as the deuteron\nones. However, nuclear modifications do exist theoretically at least at medium-\nand large-$x$ regions because nucleons in a nucleus move in any direction,\nwhich is not necessary the longitudinal direction of the virtual-photon or\nweak-boson momentum in lepton scattering. Because of this transverse motion,\nthe nucleon's transverse and longitudinal structure functions should mix with\neach other in nuclei with the mixture probability proportional to the nucleon's\ntransverse momentum squared $\\vec p_T^{\\,\\, 2}/Q^2$. In this work, numerical\nresults are explicitly shown on such nuclear modifications in the deuteron.\nThese nuclear modifications are important for determining precise structure\nfunctions of the nucleon. Furthermore, modifications of $R_N$ should be\ninvestigated also at small $x$ by the future electron-ion collider to find\ninteresting gluon dynamics in nuclei. Hopefully, this nuclear effect on $R_N$\ncould be found by future experimental measurements at lepton accelerator\nfacilities.",

    "abstract": "Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for\nautonomous driving. However, despite their advanced capabilities, DRL-based\npolicies remain highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks, posing serious safety\nrisks in real-world deployments. Investigating such attacks is crucial for\nrevealing policy vulnerabilities and guiding the development of more robust\nautonomous systems. While prior attack methods have made notable progress, they\nstill face several challenges: 1) they often rely on high-frequency attacks,\nyet critical attack opportunities are typically context-dependent and\ntemporally sparse, resulting in inefficient attack patterns; 2) restricting\nattack frequency can improve efficiency but often results in unstable training\ndue to the adversary's limited exploration. To address these challenges, we\npropose an adaptive expert-guided adversarial attack method that enhances both\nthe stability and efficiency of attack policy training. Our method first\nderives an expert policy from successful attack demonstrations using imitation\nlearning, strengthened by an ensemble Mixture-of-Experts architecture for\nrobust generalization across scenarios. This expert policy then guides a\nDRL-based adversary through a KL-divergence regularization term. Due to the\ndiversity of scenarios, expert policies may be imperfect. To address this, we\nfurther introduce a performance-aware annealing strategy that gradually reduces\nreliance on the expert as the adversary improves. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that our method achieves outperforms existing approaches in terms\nof collision rate, attack efficiency, and training stability, especially in\ncases where the expert policy is sub-optimal.",

    "abstract": "Diffusion reconstruction plays a critical role in various applications such\nas image editing, restoration, and style transfer. In theory, the\nreconstruction should be simple - it just inverts and regenerates images by\nnumerically solving the Probability Flow-Ordinary Differential Equation\n(PF-ODE). Yet in practice, noticeable reconstruction errors have been observed,\nwhich cannot be well explained by numerical errors. In this work, we identify a\ndeeper intrinsic property in the PF-ODE generation process, the instability,\nthat can further amplify the reconstruction errors. The root of this\ninstability lies in the sparsity inherent in the generation distribution, which\nmeans that the probability is concentrated on scattered and small regions while\nthe vast majority remains almost empty. To demonstrate the existence of\ninstability and its amplification on reconstruction error, we conduct\nexperiments on both toy numerical examples and popular open-sourced diffusion\nmodels. Furthermore, based on the characteristics of image data, we\ntheoretically prove that the instability's probability converges to one as the\ndata dimensionality increases. Our findings highlight the inherent challenges\nin diffusion-based reconstruction and can offer insights for future\nimprovements.",

    "abstract": "Quantum batteries are devices designed to store and deliver energy using\nquantum mechanics. In charger-mediated protocols, energy is transferred from a\ncharger to batteries via their interaction, typically modulated through\nquenches that require either global or local access to the primary systems.\nSuch control schemes can introduce noise and become impractical for long-range\ncharging scenarios, where the charger and battery are spatially separated. To\novercome these limitations, we propose a modulator-assisted scheme that enables\nindirect control of energy transfer using only local operations on a third\nsystem, the modulator, which interacts only with the charger. The\ncharger-battery interaction remains always on and requires no direct control\nduring the charging cycle. Instead, repeated unitary pulses applied to the\nmodulator exploit the quantum Zeno effect to dynamically modulate the effective\ncoupling strength, thereby controlling the battery's charging speed. Our\nprotocol enables the potential of remote, platform-independent control of\nenergy flow and provides a framework for engineering interactions in spatially\ndistributed quantum technologies.",

    "abstract": "This study examines the long-term economic impact of the colonial Mita system\nin Peru, building on Melissa Dell's foundational work on the enduring effects\nof forced labor institutions. The Mita, imposed by the Spanish colonial\nauthorities from 1573 to 1812, required indigenous communities within a\ndesignated boundary to supply labor to mines, primarily near Potosi. Dell's\noriginal regression discontinuity design (RDD) analysis, leveraging the Mita\nboundary to estimate the Mita's legacy on modern economic outcomes, indicates\nthat regions subjected to the Mita exhibit lower household consumption levels\nand higher rates of child stunting. In this paper, I replicate Dell's results\nand extend this analysis. I apply Double Machine Learning (DML) methods--the\nPartially Linear Regression (PLR) model and the Interactive Regression Model\n(IRM)--to further investigate the Mita's effects. DML allows for the inclusion\nof high-dimensional covariates and enables more flexible, non-linear modeling\nof treatment effects, potentially capturing complex relationships that a\npolynomial-based approach may overlook. While the PLR model provides some\nadditional flexibility, the IRM model allows for fully heterogeneous treatment\neffects, offering a nuanced perspective on the Mita's impact across regions and\ndistrict characteristics. My findings suggest that the Mita's economic legacy\nis more substantial and spatially heterogeneous than originally estimated. The\nIRM results reveal that proximity to Potosi and other district-specific factors\nintensify the Mita's adverse impact, suggesting a deeper persistence of\nregional economic inequality. These findings underscore that machine learning\naddresses the realistic non-linearity present in complex, real-world systems.\nBy modeling hypothetical counterfactuals more accurately, DML enhances my\nability to estimate the true causal impact of historical interventions.",

We also develop and implement a practical algorithmic variant\nthat in a hybrid alternating fashion combines a barrier and a plain gradient\ndescent.

Vision-based active tracking by a UAV\nentails solving two coupled problems: 1) compute-efficient and accurate\n(target) object detection and target state estimation; and 2) maneuver\ndecisions to ensure that the target remains in the field of view in the future\ntime-steps and favorably positioned for continued detection. As a solution to\nthe first problem, this paper presents a novel integration of standard deep\nlearning based architectures with Kernelized Correlation Filter (KCF) to\nachieve compute-efficient object detection without compromising accuracy,\nunlike standalone learning or filtering approaches. The proposed perception\nframework is validated using a lab-scale setup. For the second problem, to\nobviate the linearity assumptions and background variations limiting\neffectiveness of the traditional controllers, we present the use of\nreinforcement learning to train a neuro-controller for fast computation of\nvelocity maneuvers. New state space, action space and reward formulations are\ndeveloped for this purpose, and training is performed in simulation using\nAirSim. The trained model is also tested in AirSim with respect to complex\ntarget maneuvers, and is found to outperform a baseline PID control in terms of\ntracking up-time and average distance maintained (from the target) during\ntracking.",

    "abstract": "Weakly supervised temporal action localization is a challenging task as only\nthe video-level annotation is available during the training process. To address\nthis problem, we propose a two-stage approach to fully exploit multi-resolution\ninformation in the temporal domain and generate high quality frame-level pseudo\nlabels based on both appearance and motion streams. Specifically, in the first\nstage, we generate reliable initial frame-level pseudo labels, and in the\nsecond stage, we iteratively refine the pseudo labels and use a set of selected\nframes with highly confident pseudo labels to train neural networks and better\npredict action class scores at each frame. We fully exploit temporal\ninformation at multiple scales to improve temporal action localization\nperformance. Specifically, in order to obtain reliable initial frame-level\npseudo labels, in the first stage, we propose an Initial Label Generation (ILG)\nmodule, which leverages temporal multi-resolution consistency to generate high\nquality class activation sequences (CASs), which consist of a number of\nsequences with each sequence measuring how likely each video frame belongs to\none specific action class. In the second stage, we propose a Progressive\nTemporal Label Refinement (PTLR) framework. In our PTLR framework, two networks\ncalled Network-OTS and Network-RTS, which are respectively used to generate\nCASs for the original temporal scale and the reduced temporal scales, are used\nas two streams (i.e., the OTS stream and the RTS stream) to refine the pseudo\nlabels in turn. By this way, the multi-resolution information in the temporal\ndomain is exchanged at the pseudo label level, and our work can help improve\neach stream (i.e., the OTS/RTS stream) by exploiting the refined pseudo labels\nfrom another stream (i.e., the RTS/OTS stream).",

    "abstract": "In recent years, Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a widely adopted\nprivacy-preserving distributed training approach, attracting significant\ninterest from both academia and industry. Research efforts have been dedicated\nto improving different aspects of FL, such as algorithm improvement, resource\nallocation, and client selection, to enable its deployment in distributed edge\nnetworks for practical applications. One of the reasons for the poor FL model\nperformance is due to the worker dropout during training as the FL server may\nbe located far away from the FL workers. To address this issue, an Hierarchical\nFederated Learning (HFL) framework has been introduced, incorporating an\nadditional layer of edge servers to relay communication between the FL server\nand workers. While the HFL framework improves the communication between the FL\nserver and workers, large number of communication rounds may still be required\nfor model convergence, particularly when FL workers have non-independent and\nidentically distributed (non-IID) data. Moreover, the FL workers are assumed to\nfully cooperate in the FL training process, which may not always be true in\npractical situations. To overcome these challenges, we propose a\nsynthetic-data-empowered HFL framework that mitigates the statistical issues\narising from non-IID local datasets while also incentivizing FL worker\nparticipation. In our proposed framework, the edge servers reward the FL\nworkers in their clusters for facilitating the FL training process. To improve\nthe performance of the FL model given the non-IID local datasets of the FL\nworkers, the edge servers generate and distribute synthetic datasets to FL\nworkers within their clusters. FL workers determine which edge server to\nassociate with, considering the computational resources required to train on\nboth their local datasets and the synthetic datasets.",

However, the ground bounce (GB) that is\npresent in GPR data, which is caused by the dielectric discontinuity between\nsoil and air, is a major source of interference and degrades landmine detection\nperformance. To mitigate this interference, GB tracking algorithms formulated\nusing both a Kalman filter (KF) and a particle filter (PF) framework are\nproposed. In particular, the location of the GB in the radar signal is modeled\nas the hidden state in a stochastic system for the PF approach. The\nobservations are the 2D radar images, which arrive scan by scan along the\ndown-track direction. An initial training stage sets parameters automatically\nto accommodate different ground and weather conditions. The features associated\nwith the GB description are updated adaptively with the arrival of new data.\nThe prior distribution for a given location is predicted by propagating\ninformation from two adjacent channels/scans, which ensures that the overall GB\nsurface remains smooth.

This primary\nlimitation stems from the heavy reliance on domain-specific verifiers, which\nresults in prohibitive complexity and limited scalability. To address the\nchallenge, our key observation is that LLM's intrinsic probability of\ngenerating a correct free-form answer directly indicates its own evaluation of\nthe reasoning reward (i.e., how well the reasoning process leads to the correct\nanswer). Building on this insight, we propose RLPR, a simple verifier-free\nframework that extrapolates RLVR to broader general domains. RLPR uses the\nLLM's own token probability scores for reference answers as the reward signal\nand maximizes the expected reward during training. We find that addressing the\nhigh variance of this noisy probability reward is crucial to make it work, and\npropose prob-to-reward and stabilizing methods to ensure a precise and stable\nreward from LLM intrinsic probabilities. Comprehensive experiments in four\ngeneral-domain benchmarks and three mathematical benchmarks show that RLPR\nconsistently improves reasoning capabilities in both areas for Gemma, Llama,\nand Qwen based models.

The key insight of Morse is to\nreformulate the iterative generation (from noise to data) process via taking\nadvantage of fast jump sampling and adaptive residual feedback strategies.\nSpecifically, Morse involves two models called Dash and Dot that interact with\neach other. The Dash model is just the pre-trained diffusion model of any type,\nbut operates in a jump sampling regime, creating sufficient space for sampling\nefficiency improvement. The Dot model is significantly faster than the Dash\nmodel, which is learnt to generate residual feedback conditioned on the\nobservations at the current jump sampling point on the trajectory of the Dash\nmodel, lifting the noise estimate to easily match the next-step estimate of the\nDash model without jump sampling. By chaining the outputs of the Dash and Dot\nmodels run in a time-interleaved fashion, Morse exhibits the merit of flexibly\nattaining desired image generation performance while improving overall runtime\nefficiency. With our proposed weight sharing strategy between the Dash and Dot\nmodels, Morse is efficient for training and inference. Our method shows a\nlossless speedup of 1.78X to 3.31X on average over a wide range of sampling\nstep budgets relative to 9 baseline diffusion models on 6 image generation\ntasks.

Despite recent advances, current\napproaches face significant challenges in processing aerial imagery due to\ncomplex object characteristics including scale variations, diverse\norientations, and semantic ambiguities inherent to the overhead perspective. To\naddress these limitations, we propose DiffRIS, a novel framework that harnesses\nthe semantic understanding capabilities of pre-trained text-to-image diffusion\nmodels for enhanced cross-modal alignment in RRSIS tasks. Our framework\nintroduces two key innovations: a context perception adapter (CP-adapter) that\ndynamically refines linguistic features through global context modeling and\nobject-aware reasoning, and a progressive cross-modal reasoning decoder (PCMRD)\nthat iteratively aligns textual descriptions with visual regions for precise\nsegmentation. The CP-adapter bridges the domain gap between general\nvision-language understanding and remote sensing applications, while PCMRD\nenables fine-grained semantic alignment through multi-scale feature\ninteraction. Comprehensive experiments on three benchmark datasets-RRSIS-D,\nRefSegRS, and RISBench-demonstrate that DiffRIS consistently outperforms\nexisting methods across all standard metrics, establishing a new\nstate-of-the-art for RRSIS tasks. The significant performance improvements\nvalidate the effectiveness of leveraging pre-trained diffusion models for\nremote sensing applications through our proposed adaptive framework.",

The negative directions of the filtrations\ncapture the robustness of the ``basin'' by quantifying how much perturbations\ncan be tolerated without altering the tendency to be attracted to a given\nattractor. Furthermore, to accommodate real-world phenomena, we consider\ndynamical systems not on metric spaces with discrete-time maps, but on sets\nendowed with a more general cost function, where the dynamics are governed by\npartial maps. To illustrate the generality of the proposed construction, we\napply it to ensemble forecasts of a tropical cyclone.

Text-Image Retrieval (TIR) retrieves a target image\nfrom a gallery based on an image-level description, while Referring Expression\nComprehension (REC) localizes a target object within a given image using an\ninstance-level description. However, real-world applications often present more\ncomplex demands. Users typically query an instance-level description across a\nlarge gallery and expect to receive both relevant image and the corresponding\ninstance location. In such scenarios, TIR struggles with fine-grained\ndescriptions and object-level localization, while REC is limited in its ability\nto efficiently search large galleries and lacks an effective ranking mechanism.\nIn this paper, we introduce a new task called \\textbf{Referring Expression\nInstance Retrieval (REIR)}, which supports both instance-level retrieval and\nlocalization based on fine-grained referring expressions. First, we propose a\nlarge-scale benchmark for REIR, named REIRCOCO, constructed by prompting\nadvanced vision-language models to generate high-quality referring expressions\nfor instances in the MSCOCO and RefCOCO datasets.

Given a referring expression, the textual branch encodes it into a\nquery embedding. The visual branch detects candidate objects and extracts their\ninstance-level visual features. The most similar candidate to the query is\nselected for bounding box prediction. CLARE is first trained on object\ndetection and REC datasets to establish initial grounding capabilities, then\noptimized via Contrastive Language-Instance Alignment (CLIA) for improved\nretrieval across images.

Empirical analysis shows that even after continual pre-training (CPT)\nand supervised fine-tuning (SFT), LLMs may misinterpret the execution order of\nstate changes, resulting in incorrect explanations despite making correct\ndetection decisions. To address these challenges, we propose Smart-LLaMA-DPO\nbased on LLaMA-3.1-8B.

Second, we\nperform CPT using large-scale smart contract to enhance the LLM's understanding\nof specific security practices in smart contracts.

Extensive experiments demonstrate that DFPT-KD leads to trained\nstudents performing better than the vanilla KD.

    "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based post-training has significantly advanced\nthe complex reasoning capabilities of language models, fostering sophisticated\nself-reflection processes. However, this ``slow thinking'' paradigm presents a\ncritical challenge to reasoning efficiency: models may expend excessive\ncomputation on simple questions and shift reasoning prematurely for complex\nones. Previous mechanisms typically rely on static length budgets or predefined\nrules, lacking the adaptability for varying question complexities and models'\nevolving capabilities. To this end, we propose AdapThink, an adaptive\npost-training framework designed to induce more efficient thinking while\nmaintaining the performance of reasoning language models. Specifically,\nAdapThink incorporates two key mechanisms: 1) A group-relative reward function\nthat leverages model confidence and response's characteristic to dynamically\nadjust the preference of reflection-related transition words without resorting\nto a fixed length preference. 2) A diversity-aware sampling mechanism that\nbalances the training group's solution accuracy with reasoning diversity via an\nentropy-guided score. Experiments on several mathematical reasoning datasets\nwith DeepSeek-distilled models demonstrate AdapThink's advantages in enabling\nadaptive reasoning patterns and mitigating the inefficiencies.",

However, we\nidentify two critical challenges in this direction: (1) VLMs tend to learn\nshortcuts by relying heavily on history input information, achieving seemingly\nstrong planning results without genuinely understanding the visual inputs; and\n(2) the chain-ofthought (COT) reasoning processes are always misaligned with\nthe motion planning outcomes, and how to effectively leverage the complex\nreasoning capability to enhance planning remains largely underexplored. In this\npaper, we start from a small-scale domain-specific VLM and propose Drive-R1\ndesigned to bridges the scenario reasoning and motion planning for AD. Drive-R1\nfirst undergoes the supervised finetuning on a elaborate dataset containing\nboth long and short COT data. Drive-R1 is encouraged to reason step-by-step\nfrom visual input to final planning decisions. Subsequently, Drive-R1 is\ntrained within a reinforcement learning framework that incentivizes the\ndiscovery of reasoning paths that are more informative for planning, guided by\nrewards based on predicted trajectories and meta actions. Experimental\nevaluations on the nuScenes and DriveLM-nuScenes benchmarks demonstrate that\nDrive-R1 achieves superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art\nVLMs. We believe that Drive-R1 presents a promising direction for bridging\nreasoning and planning in AD, offering methodological insights for future\nresearch and applications.",

With the advent of large CMB surveys\nlike those from the Planck satellite, the ACT and SPT telescopes, we now have\naccess to a large number of galaxy clusters detected at millimeter wavelengths\nvia the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) effect. Nevertheless, it is\ninteresting to complement them with high-angular-resolution (tens of\narcseconds) observations to target the lowest-mass and highest-redshift\nclusters. This is the case of observations with the NIKA2 camera, which is\ninstalled on the IRAM 30--m telescope in Pico Veleta, Spain. We used the\nexisting 150 GHz (2 mm) data from the NIKA2 Cosmological Legacy Survey (N2CLS)\nLarge Program to blindly search for galaxy clusters in the well-known COSMOS\nfield, across a 877 arcmin$^2$ region centered on (R.A., Dec.)$_{J2000}$ =\n(10h00m28.81s, +02d17m30.44s). We first developed a dedicated data reduction\npipeline to construct NIKA2 maps at 2 mm. We then used a matched-filter\nalgorithm to extract cluster candidates assuming a universal pressure profile\nto model the expected cluster tSZ signal. We computed the purity and\ncompleteness of the sample by applying the previous algorithm to simulated maps\nof the sky signal in the COSMOS field. We find a total of 16 cluster candidates\nat S/N > 4, from which eight have either an optical or X-ray cluster (or group\nof galaxies) counterpart. This is the first blind detection of clusters of\ngalaxies at mm wavelengths at 18\" angular resolution. From this analysis, we\nconfirm that NIKA2 and the IRAM 30--m telescope should be sensitive to low-mass\nclusters at intermediate and high redshift, complementing current and planned\nlarge tSZ-based cluster surveys.",

    "abstract": "We critically assess the w0waCDM model, employing the\nChevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrization, against Baryon Acoustic\nOscillation (BAO) measurements from DESI Data Release 2 (DR2). While DESI DR2\nBAO observations are broadly consistent with a standard expansion history and\nmatter density Omegam approximately 0.3, our Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)\nfits reveal observable-dependent shifts in best-fit parameters and degeneracy\ndirections for the w0waCDM model, particularly when using rd-dependent and\nrd-independent observables separately. When constrained solely by DESI DR2 BAO\ndata, the w0waCDM model exhibits a critical inconsistency: it predicts\nsystematically lower values for DV/rd, DM/rd, and DH/rd, but higher values for\nthe rd-independent ratio DM/DH. This tension arises from the inherent\nlimitations of the CPL parametrization, particularly its behavior at high\nredshifts, where w(z) asymptotes to w0 + wa. To fit early-time observables like\nrd, the model is driven to high Omegam and large negative wa, resulting in\nparameter combinations that may lack physical plausibility. Our findings\nunderscore that DESI DR2 BAO data alone is insufficient to constrain w0waCDM\nreliably, especially in the presence of CPL-induced degeneracies. Even ratio\nobservables like DM/DH, which are independent of rd, are not immune to these\neffects. We advocate for constraining individual observables such as DV, DM,\nand DH separately--ideally combined with external priors on rd--to obtain more\nphysically reliable constraints on evolving dark energy models. Ultimately,\nthis study highlights the importance of caution when using approximate\nparametrizations such as CPL in precision cosmology, particularly across wide\nredshift ranges.",

Although diffusion models offer greater\nflexibility, they often suffer from high computational costs during inference.\nTo combine the strengths of both approaches, we introduce a two-stage method.\nFirst, we construct a training-free conditional diffusion model by analytically\nderiving an exact score function under a Gaussian mixture prior formed from\nsamples of the underlying joint distribution. This exact conditional score\nmodel allows us to efficiently generate noise-labeled data, consisting of\ninitial diffusion Gaussian noise and posterior samples conditioned on various\nobservation values, by solving a reverse-time ordinary differential equation.\nSecond, we use this noise-labeled data to train a feedforward neural network\nthat maps noise and observations directly to posterior samples, eliminating the\nneed for reversibility or iterative sampling at inference time. The resulting\nmodel provides fast, accurate, and scalable conditional sampling for\nhigh-dimensional and multi-modal posterior distributions, making it well-suited\nfor uncertainty quantification tasks, e.g., parameter estimation of complex\nphysical systems.

Conceptually, ADSA dynamically identifies\nhistorical tokens crucial for maintaining local texture consistency and those\nessential for ensuring global semantic coherence, thereby efficiently\nstreamlining attention computation. Additionally, we introduce a dynamic\nKV-cache update mechanism tailored for ADSA, reducing GPU memory consumption\nduring inference by approximately $50\\%$. Extensive qualitative and\nquantitative experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our\napproach in terms of both generation quality and resource efficiency.",

Here, we have\novercome this issue by comparing calculated O$_2$ adsorption energy\n($E_{\\text{ads}}$) to simulated $E_{\\text{ads}}$ distribution from experimental\ntemperature-programmed desorption (TPD) spectrum. The distribution obtained\nbased on equilibrium thermodynamic arguments is in good agreement with the\ncalculated $E_{\\text{ads}}$ from modelling O$_2$ adsorption on\nanatase-TiO$_2$(101) using the generalized gradient approximation and van der\nWaals density functionals (vdW-DFs) with Hubbard correction, which is\nparticularly the case when vdW-DF3-opt2 is used. On this basis, we concluded\nthat the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) initiates from a physisorbed O$_2$\nthermodynamically as stable as that in the gas phase. In contrast, the\ncalculated $E_{\\text{ads}}$ for Pt(111) exhibit a significant overestimation of\nthe O$_2$ adsorption due to excessive vdW correction. Therefore, a systematic\ninvestigation based on TPD spectroscopy can be used to diagnose the reliability\nof theoretical predictions of ORR and is expected to lead to improvements in\nexchange-correlation functionals for catalysts.",

    "abstract": "When analyzing data from multiple sources, it is often convenient to strike a\ncareful balance between two goals: capturing the heterogeneity of the samples\nand sharing information across them. We introduce a novel framework to model a\ncollection of samples using dependent Dirichlet processes constructed through a\nthinning mechanism. The proposed approach modifies the stick-breaking\nrepresentation of the Dirichlet process by thinning, that is, setting equal to\nzero a random subset of the beta random variables used in the original\nconstruction. This results in a collection of dependent random distributions\nthat exhibit both shared and unique atoms, with the shared ones assigned\ndistinct weights in each distribution. The generality of the construction\nallows expressing a wide variety of dependence structures among the elements of\nthe generated random vectors. Moreover, its simplicity facilitates the\ncharacterization of several theoretical properties and the derivation of\nefficient computational methods for posterior inference. A simulation study\nillustrates how a modeling approach based on the proposed process reduces\nuncertainty in group-specific inferences while preventing excessive borrowing\nof information when the data indicate it is unnecessary. This added flexibility\nimproves the accuracy of posterior inference, outperforming related\nstate-of-the-art models. An application to the Collaborative Perinatal Project\ndata highlights the model's capability to estimate group-specific densities and\nuncover a meaningful partition of the observations, both within and across\nsamples, providing valuable insights into the underlying data structure.",

    "abstract": "Transfer learning is a cornerstone of modern machine learning, promising a\nway to adapt models pretrained on a broad mix of data to new tasks with minimal\nnew data. However, a significant challenge remains in ensuring that transferred\nfeatures are sufficient to handle unseen datasets, amplified by the difficulty\nof quantifying whether two tasks are \"related\". To address these challenges, we\nevaluate model transfer from a pretraining mixture to each of its component\ntasks, assessing whether pretrained features can match the performance of\ntask-specific direct training. We identify a fundamental limitation in deep\nlearning models -- an \"information saturation bottleneck\" -- where networks\nfail to learn new features once they encode similar competing features during\ntraining. When restricted to learning only a subset of key features during\npretraining, models will permanently lose critical features for transfer and\nperform inconsistently on data distributions, even components of the training\nmixture. Empirical evidence from published studies suggests that this\nphenomenon is pervasive in deep learning architectures -- factors such as data\ndistribution or ordering affect the features that current representation\nlearning methods can learn over time. This study suggests that relying solely\non large-scale networks may not be as effective as focusing on task-specific\ntraining, when available. We propose richer feature representations as a\npotential solution to better generalize across new datasets and, specifically,\npresent existing methods alongside a novel approach, the initial steps towards\naddressing this challenge.",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes an approach that leverages multimodal data by integrating\nvisual images with radio frequency (RF) pilots to optimize user association and\nbeamforming in a downlink wireless cellular network under a max-min fairness\ncriterion. Traditional methods typically optimize wireless system parameters\nbased on channel state information (CSI). However, obtaining accurate CSI\nrequires extensive pilot transmissions, which lead to increased overhead and\nlatency. Moreover, the optimization of user association and beamforming is a\ndiscrete and non-convex optimization problem, which is challenging to solve\nanalytically. In this paper, we propose to incorporate visual camera data in\naddition to the RF pilots to perform the joint optimization of user association\nand beamforming. The visual image data helps enhance channel awareness, thereby\nreducing the dependency on extensive pilot transmissions for system\noptimization. We employ a learning-based approach based on using first a\ndetection neural network that estimates user locations from images, and\nsubsequently two graph neural networks (GNNs) that extract features for system\noptimization based on the location information and the received pilots,\nrespectively. Then, a multimodal GNN is constructed to integrate the features\nfor the joint optimization user association and beamforming. Simulation results\ndemonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance, while\nhaving low computational complexity and being interpretable and generalizable,\nmaking it an effective solution as compared to traditional methods based only\non RF pilots.",

This paper extends a semi-analytical approach\nfor pricing American options in time-inhomogeneous models, including pure\ndiffusions, jump-diffusions, and Levy processes. Building on prior work, we\nderive and solve Volterra integral equations of the second kind to determine\nthe exercise boundary explicitly, offering a computationally superior\nalternative to traditional finite-difference and Monte Carlo methods. We\naddress key open problems: (1) extending the decomposition method, i.e.\nsplitting the American option price into its European counterpart and an early\nexercise premium, to general jump-diffusion and Levy models; (2) handling cases\nwhere closed-form transition densities are unavailable by leveraging\ncharacteristic functions via, e.g., the COS method; and (3) generalizing the\nframework to multidimensional diffusions. Numerical examples demonstrate the\nmethod's efficiency and robustness. Our results underscore the advantages of\nthe integral equation approach for large-scale industrial applications, while\nresolving some limitations of existing techniques.",
