    "abstract": "Quantum Error Correction (QEC) is widely regarded as the most promising path\ntowards quantum advantage, with significant advances in QEC codes, decoding\nalgorithms, and physical implementations. The success of QEC relies on\nachieving quantum gate fidelities below the error threshold of the QEC code,\nwhile accurately decoding errors through classical processing of the QEC\nstabilizer measurements. In this paper, we uncover the critical system-level\nrequirements from a controller-decoder system (CDS) necessary to successfully\nexecute the next milestone in QEC, a non-Clifford circuit. Using a\nrepresentative non-Clifford circuit, of Shor factorization algorithm for the\nnumber 21, we convert the logical-level circuit to a QEC surface code circuit\nand finally to the physical level circuit. By taking into account all realistic\nimplementation aspects using typical superconducting qubit processor\nparameters, we reveal a broad range of core requirements from any CDS aimed at\nperforming error corrected quantum computation. Our findings indicate that the\ncontroller-decoder closed-loop latency must remain within tens of microseconds,\nachievable through parallelizing decoding tasks and ensuring fast communication\nbetween decoders and the controller. Additionally, by extending existing\nsimulation techniques, we simulate the complete fault-tolerant factorization\ncircuit at the physical level, demonstrating that near-term hardware\nperformance, such as a physical error rate of 0.1% and 1000 qubits, are\nsufficient for the successful execution of the circuit. These results are\ngeneral to any non-Clifford QEC circuit of the same scale, providing a\ncomprehensive overview of the classical components necessary for the\nexperimental realization of non-Clifford circuits with QEC.",

In this work, we\ndemonstrate that delta-T noise, measured across an ensemble of atomic-scale\njunctions, can be utilized to estimate the temperature bias in these systems.\nOur approach employs a supervised machine learning algorithm to train a neural\nnetwork with input features being the scaled electrical conductance, the\ndelta-T noise, and the mean temperature. Due to limited experimental data, we\ngenerate synthetic datasets, designed to mimic experiments. The neural network,\ntrained on these synthetic data, was subsequently applied to predict\ntemperature biases from experimental datasets. Using performance metrics, we\ndemonstrate that the mean bias -- the deviation of predicted temperature\ndifferences from their true value -- is less than 1 K for junctions with\nconductance up to 4$G_0$. Our study highlights that, while a single delta-T\nnoise measurement is insufficient for accurately estimating the applied\ntemperature bias due to noise contributions from other sources, averaging over\nan ensemble of junctions enables predictions within experimental uncertainties.\nThis demonstrates that machine learning approaches can be utilized for\nestimation of temperature biases, and similarly other stimuli in electronic\njunctions.",

Despite a general\ndifficulty of analytically solving such models, in our previous work [1], we\nconsidered an exactly calculable model of such scattering processes with a\ntime-dependent mass of the form $m^2(t)\\supset \\mu^4t^2$ and the\ntime-dependence never disappears formally. In this work, we discuss another\nexactly calculable model with a time-dependent mass that has a spike/peak but\nasymptotes to a constant, which effectively appears in the preheating model of\nHiggs inflation with a non-minimal coupling. Thanks to the localized\ntime-dependence of the mass, the daughter particle number density behaves in a\nphysically reasonable way contrary to the one in our previous model due to the\ninfinite time-dependent mass in the asymptotic future. On the other hand, we\nfind that the daughter particle experiences the kinematically forbidden\nprocess, which is a non-perturbative phenomenon found in our previous work. As\nin the previous model, the kinematically forbidden process produces daughter\nparticles exponentially more than the parent particle having the time-dependent\nmass, which never happens for particle decay processes without time-dependent\nbackgrounds. This result supports the existence of such a non-perturbative\nparticle production process in general time-dependent backgrounds.",

In real-world applications, when multiple optimal or\nconstraint-satisfying solutions exist, enumerating all these solutions --\nrather than finding just one -- is often desirable, as it provides flexibility\nin decision-making. However, combinatorial problems and their enumeration\nversions pose significant computational challenges due to combinatorial\nexplosion. To address these challenges, we propose enumeration algorithms for\ncombinatorial optimization and constraint satisfaction problems using Ising\nmachines. Ising machines are specialized devices designed to efficiently solve\ncombinatorial problems. Typically, they sample low-cost solutions in a\nstochastic manner. Our enumeration algorithms repeatedly sample solutions to\ncollect all desirable solutions. The crux of the proposed algorithms is their\nstopping criteria for sampling, which are derived based on probability theory.\nIn particular, the proposed algorithms have theoretical guarantees that the\nfailure probability of enumeration is bounded above by a user-specified value,\nprovided that lower-cost solutions are sampled more frequently and equal-cost\nsolutions are sampled with equal probability. Many physics-based Ising machines\nare expected to (approximately) satisfy these conditions. As a demonstration,\nwe applied our algorithm using simulated annealing to maximum clique\nenumeration on random graphs. We found that our algorithm enumerates all\nmaximum cliques in large dense graphs faster than a conventional\nbranch-and-bound algorithm specially designed for maximum clique enumeration.\nThis demonstrates the promising potential of our proposed approach.",

While many RH rebalancing studies\nfocus on nominal scenarios with regular demand patterns, it is crucial to\nconsider disruptions - such as train line interruptions - that negatively\nimpact operational efficiency, resulting in longer travel times, higher costs,\nincreased transfers, and service delays. This study examines how RH rebalancing\nstrategies can strengthen the resilience of multi-modal transportation systems\nagainst such disruptions.

    "abstract": "Surgical treatment for prostate cancer often involves organ removal, i.e.,\nprostatectomy. Pathology reports on these specimens convey treatment-relevant\ninformation. Beyond these reports, the diagnostic process generates extensive\nand complex information that is difficult to represent in reports, although it\nis of significant interest to the other medical specialties involved. 3D tissue\nreconstruction would allow for better spatial visualization, as well as\ncombinations with other imaging modalities. Existing approaches in this area\nhave proven labor-intensive and challenging to integrate into clinical\nworkflows. 3D-SLIVER provides a simplified solution, implemented as an\nopen-source 3DSlicer extension. We outline three specific real-world scenarios\nto illustrate its potential to improve transparency in diagnostic workflows and\ncontribute to multi-modal research endeavors. Implementing the 3D\nreconstruction process involved four sub-modules of 3D-SLIVER: digitization of\nslicing protocol, virtual slicing of arbitrary 3D models based on that\nprotocol, registration of slides with virtual slices using the Coherent Point\nDrift algorithm, and 3D reconstruction of registered information using convex\nhulls, Gaussian splatter and linear extrusion. Three use cases to employ\n3D-SLIVER are presented: a low-effort approach to pathology workflow\nintegration and two research-related use cases illustrating how to perform\nretrospective evaluations of PI-RADS predictions and statistically model 3D\ndistributions of morphological patterns. 3D-SLIVER allows for improved\ninterdisciplinary communication among specialties. It is designed for\nsimplicity in application, allowing for flexible integration into various\nworkflows and use cases. Here we focused on the clinical care of prostate\ncancer patients, but future possibilities are extensive with other neoplasms\nand in education and research.",

Despite the bare electrostatic interaction between two\nelectrons being repulsive, in a metal electron-hole fluctuations can give rise\nto Friedel oscillations of the screened Coulomb potential. Cooper pairing among\nthe electrons then emerges when taking advantage of the attractive regions. The\nnature of the leading pairing mechanism in some two-dimensional transition\nmetal dichalcogenides is still debated. Focusing on NbSe$_2$, we show that\nsuperconductivity can be induced by the Coulomb interaction when accounting for\nscreening effects on the trigonal lattice with multiple orbitals. Using ab\ninitio-based tight-binding parametrizations for the relevant low-energy\nd-bands, we evaluate the screened interaction microscopically, in a scheme\nincluding Bloch overlaps. In the direct space, we find long-range Friedel\noscillations alternating in sign, a key to the Kohn-Luttinger mechanism. The\nmomentum-resolved gap equations predict two degenerate solutions at the\ncritical temperature Tc, signaling the unconventional nature of the pairing.\nTheir complex linear combination, i.e., a chiral gap with p-like symmetry,\nprovides the ground state of the system. Our prediction of a fully gapped\nchiral phase well below Tc is in excellent agreement with the spectral function\nextracted from tunneling spectroscopy measurements of single-layer NbSe$_2$.",

Especially in the context\nof offshore wind integration, hybrid AC/DC grids are considered to be the most\neffective technology to transmit this RES power over long distances. As hybrid\nAC/DC systems develop, they are expected to become increasingly complex and\nmeshed as the current AC system. Nevertheless, there is still limited\nliterature on how to optimize hybrid AC/DC topologies while minimizing the\ntotal power generation cost. For this reason, this paper proposes a methodology\nto optimize the steady-state switching states of transmission lines and busbar\nconfigurations in hybrid AC/DC grids. The proposed optimization model includes\noptimal transmission switching (OTS) and busbar splitting (BS), which can be\napplied to both AC and DC parts of hybrid AC/DC grids. To solve the problem, a\nscalable and exact nonlinear, non-convex model using a big M approach is\nformulated. In addition, convex relaxations and linear approximations of the\nmodel are tested, and their accuracy, feasibility, and optimality are analyzed.\nThe numerical experiments show that a solution to the combined OTS/BS problem\ncan be found in acceptable computation time and that the investigated\nrelaxations and linearisations provide AC feasible results.",

Increasing the workspace of a robot arm requires longer links, which\nadds weight to the system and requires a larger storage volume. However, the\ntradeoff between workspace and storage volume can be resolved by the use of\ndeployable structures with high extensibility. In this work we introduce a\nbidirectional tape spring based structure that can be stored in a compact state\nand then extended to perform manipulation tasks, allowing for a large\nmanipulation workspace and low storage volume. Bidirectional tape springs are\ndemonstrated to have large buckling strength compared to single tape springs,\nwhile maintaining the ability to roll into a compact storage volume. Two tape\nspring structures are integrated into a bimanual manipulator robot called\nGRIP-tape that allows for object Grasping and Rolling In Planar configurations\n(GRIP). In demonstrations we show that the continuum kinematics of the tape\nsprings enable novel manipulation capabilities such as simultaneous\ntranslation-rotation and multi-object conveyance. Furthermore, the dual\nmechanical properties of stiffness and softness in the tape springs enables\ninherent safety from unintended collisions within the workspace and\nsoft-contact with objects.

    "abstract": "Crowdsourcing is a common approach to rapidly annotate large volumes of data\nin machine learning applications. Typically, crowd workers are compensated with\na flat rate based on an estimated completion time to meet a target hourly wage.\nUnfortunately, prior work has shown that variability in completion times among\ncrowd workers led to overpayment by 168% in one case, and underpayment by 16%\nin another. However, by setting a time limit for task completion, it is\npossible to manage the risk of overpaying or underpaying while still\nfacilitating flat rate payments. In this paper, we present an analysis of the\nimpact of a time limit on crowd worker performance and satisfaction. We\nconducted a human study with a maximum view time for a crowdsourced image\nclassification task. We find that the impact on overall crowd worker\nperformance diminishes as view time increases. Despite some images being\nchallenging under time limits, a consensus algorithm remains effective at\npreserving data quality and filters images needing more time. Additionally,\ncrowd workers' consistent performance throughout the time-limited task\nindicates sustained effort, and their psychometric questionnaire scores show\nthey prefer shorter limits. Based on our findings, we recommend implementing\ntask time limits as a practical approach to making compensation more equitable\nand predictable.",

However, existing methods that leverage differentiable\nprogramming to identify world models are incapable of jointly optimizing the\ngeometry, appearance, and physical properties of the scene. In this work, we\nintroduce a novel rigid object representation that allows the joint\nidentification of these properties. Our method employs a novel differentiable\npoint-based geometry representation coupled with a grid-based appearance field,\nwhich allows differentiable object collision detection and rendering. Combined\nwith a differentiable physical simulator, we achieve end-to-end optimization of\nworld models, given the sparse visual and tactile observations of a physical\nmotion sequence. Through a series of world model identification tasks in\nsimulated and real environments, we show that our method can learn both\nsimulation- and rendering-ready world models from only one robot action\nsequence.

They swiftly elevate the thermodynamic conditions\nof test gases, making them ideal for examining rapid chemical reactions and\ngenerating high-enthalpy flows for aerodynamic research. However, non-ideal\neffects, stemming from factors like diaphragm opening processes and viscous\neffects, can significantly influence thermodynamic conditions behind the shock\nwave. This study investigates the impact of various diaphragm opening patterns\non the shock parameters near the driven section end-wall. Experiments were\nconducted using helium and argon as driver and driven gases, respectively, at\npressures ranging from 1.32 to 2.09 bar and temperatures from 1073 to 2126 K\nbehind the reflected shock. High-speed imaging captured different diaphragm\nrupture profiles, classified into four distinct types based on their dynamics.\nResults indicate that the initial stages of diaphragm opening, including the\nrate and profile of opening, play crucial roles in resulting incident shock\nMach number and test time. A sigmoid function was employed to fit the diaphragm\nopening profiles, allowing for accurate categorization and analysis. New\ncorrelations were developed to predict the incident shock attenuation rate and\npost-shock pressure rise, incorporating parameters such as diaphragm opening\ntime, rupture profile constants, and normalized experimental Mach number.

    "abstract": "Animal excretions in form of urine puddles and feces are a significant source\nof emissions in livestock farming. Automated detection of soiled floor in barns\ncan contribute to improved management processes but also the derived\ninformation can be used to model emission dynamics. Previous research\napproaches to determine the puddle area require manual detection of the puddle\nin the barn. While humans can detect animal excretions on thermal images of a\nlivestock barn, automated approaches using thresholds fail due to other objects\nof the same temperature, such as the animals themselves. In addition, various\nparameters such as the type of housing, animal species, age, sex, weather and\nunknown factors can influence the type and shape of excretions. Due to this\nheterogeneity, a method for automated detection of excretions must therefore be\nnot only be accurate but also robust to varying conditions. These requirements\ncan be met by using contemporary deep learning models from the field of\nartificial intelligence. This work is the first to investigate the suitability\nof different deep learning models for the detection of excretions in pigsties,\nthereby comparing established convolutional architectures with recent\ntransformer-based approaches. The detection models Faster R-CNN, YOLOv8, DETR\nand DAB-DETR are compared and statistically assessed on two created training\ndatasets representing two pig houses. We apply a method derived from nested\ncross-validation and report on the results in terms of eight common detection\nmetrics. Our work demonstrates that all investigated deep learning models are\ngenerally suitable for reliably detecting excretions with an average precision\nof over 90%. The models also show robustness on out of distribution data that\npossesses differences from the conditions in the training data, however, with\nexpected slight decreases in the overall detection performance.",

    "abstract": "We study the fair allocation of indivisible goods among a group of agents,\naiming to limit the envy between any two agents. The central open problem in\nthis literature, which has proven to be extremely challenging, is regarding the\nexistence of an EFX allocation, i.e., an allocation such that any envy from\nsome agent i toward another agent j would vanish if we were to remove any\nsingle good from the bundle allocated to j. When the agents' valuations are\nadditive, which has been the main focus of prior works, Chaudhury et al. [2024]\nshowed that an EFX allocation is guaranteed to exist for all instances\ninvolving up to three agents. Subsequently, Berger et al. [2022] extended this\nguarantee to nice-cancelable valuations and Akrami et al. [2023] to\nMMS-feasible valuations. However, the existence of EFX allocations for\ninstances involving four agents remains open, even for additive valuations. We\ncontribute to this literature by focusing on EF2X, a relaxation of EFX which\nrequires that any envy toward some agent vanishes if any two of the goods\nallocated to that agent were to be removed. Our main result shows that EF2X\nallocations are guaranteed to exist for any instance with four agents, even for\nthe class of cancelable valuations, which is more general than additive. Our\nproof is constructive, proposing an algorithm that computes such an allocation\nin pseudopolynomial time. Furthermore, for instances involving three agents we\nprovide an algorithm that computes an EF2X allocation in polynomial time, in\ncontrast to EFX, for which the fastest known algorithm for three agents is only\npseudopolynomial.",

Through experimental and theoretical analyses, we demonstrate how the\nparticle dynamics are influenced by their zeta potential sensitivity to the\nlocal salt concentration, which in turn is affected by surface conductance\neffects induced by the surface carboxyl groups. Consequently, colloids with\ncomparable zeta potentials but differing surface concentrations of carboxyl\ngroups can be separated with 100% efficiency. This approach, which employs a\nsimple, easy-to-operate device, has discipline-spanning potential for the\ncontinuous separation of colloids distinguished solely by surface properties\nthat influence their zeta potential sensitivities, like roughness,\npermeability, heterogeneity, and chemical composition.",

This study addresses this gap by constructing an SDoH-enriched\nknowledge graph using the MIMIC-III dataset and PrimeKG. We introduce a novel\nfairness formulation for graph embeddings, focusing on invariance with respect\nto sensitive SDoH information. Via employing a heterogeneous-GCN model for\ndrug-disease link prediction, we detect biases related to various SDoH factors.\nTo mitigate these biases, we propose a post-processing method that\nstrategically reweights edges connected to SDoHs, balancing their influence on\ngraph representations.

The area of Learning with Noisy Labels (LNL) has introduced\nmethods to effectively train DL models in the presence of noisily-labeled\ndatasets. Traditionally, these methods are tested using synthetic label noise,\nwhere ground truth labels are randomly (and automatically) flipped. However,\nrecent findings highlight that models perform substantially worse under human\nlabel noise than synthetic label noise, indicating a need for more realistic\ntest scenarios that reflect noise introduced due to imperfect human labeling.\nThis underscores the need for generating realistic noisy labels that simulate\nhuman label noise, enabling rigorous testing of deep neural networks without\nthe need to collect new human-labeled datasets. To address this gap, we present\nCluster-Based Noise (CBN), a method for generating feature-dependent noise that\nsimulates human-like label noise. Using insights from our case study of label\nmemorization in the CIFAR-10N dataset, we design CBN to create more realistic\ntests for evaluating LNL methods.

We extend our analysis to include two\nfrequency-dependent propagation effects: (i) multipath scattering,\ncharacterized by a pulse-broadening timescale $\\tau_\\mathrm{sc} \\propto\n\\nu^{-4}$, and (ii) residual dispersion, parameterized by $\\Delta\n\\mathrm{DM}\\propto \\nu^{-2}$. Our analysis shows that scattering preserves the\ninverse relation between sub-burst slope and duration, but increases the\nscaling coefficient when $\\tau_\\mathrm{sc}$ exceeds the intrinsic width\n($t_\\mathrm{w}$) of sub-bursts. Residual DM errors act asymmetrically:\nunder-dedispersion flattens the sub-burst slope, whereas over-dedispersion\ncauses a non-linear increase and eventually a change of sign. When both effects\nare present, scattering counterbalances the steepening induced by\nover-dedispersion and augments the flattening produced by under-dedispersion,\nyielding characteristically distorted curves. We repeat measurements for\nultra-short duration bursts (ultra-FRBs) with $t_\\mathrm{w} = 50\\\n\\mu\\mathrm{s}$ at 1 GHz and found them to be far more sensitive to propagation\nerrors.

Out of these, the majority\nwere clinical corpora -- 46 real ones, 5 translated ones, and 6 synthetic ones.\nAs to domain proxies, we identified 18 close and 17 distant ones. There is a\nclear divide between the large number of non-accessible authentic clinical\nGerman-language corpora and their publicly accessible substitutes: translated\nor synthetic, close or more distant proxies. So on first sight, the data\nbottleneck seems broken. Yet differences in genre-specific writing style,\nwording and medical domain expertise in this typological space are also\nobvious. This raises the question how valid alternative corpus designs really\nare.",

    "abstract": "Selection bias can hinder accurate estimation of association parameters in\nbinary disease risk models using non-probability samples like electronic health\nrecords (EHRs). The issue is compounded when participants are recruited from\nmultiple clinics/centers with varying selection mechanisms that may depend on\nthe disease/outcome of interest. Traditional inverse-probability-weighted (IPW)\nmethods, based on constructed parametric selection models, often struggle with\nmisspecifications when selection mechanisms vary across cohorts. This paper\nintroduces a new Joint Augmented Inverse Probability Weighted (JAIPW) method,\nwhich integrates individual-level data from multiple cohorts collected under\npotentially outcome-dependent selection mechanisms, with data from an external\nprobability sample. JAIPW offers double robustness by incorporating a flexible\nauxiliary score model to address potential misspecifications in the selection\nmodels. We outline the asymptotic properties of the JAIPW estimator, and our\nsimulations reveal that JAIPW achieves up to five times lower relative bias and\nthree times lower root mean square error (RMSE) compared to the best performing\njoint IPW methods under scenarios with misspecified selection models. Applying\nJAIPW to the Michigan Genomics Initiative (MGI), a multi-clinic EHR-linked\nbiobank, combined with external national probability samples, resulted in\ncancer-sex association estimates closely aligned with national benchmark\nestimates. We also analysed the association between cancer and polygenic risk\nscores (PRS) in MGI to illustrate a situation where the exposure variable is\nnot measured in the external probability sample.",

In this work, we propose an operational task\nto identify measurements that are neither projective nor classical\npost-processing of data obtained from projective measurements. Our setup\ninvolves space-like separated parties with access to a shared state with\nbounded local dimensions. Specifically, in the case of qubits, we focus on a\nbipartite scenario with different sets of target correlations. While some of\nthese correlations can be obtained through non-projective measurements on a\nshared two-qubit state, it is impossible to generate these correlations using\n{\\it projective simulable} measurements on bipartite qubit states, or\nequivalently, by using one bit of shared randomness and local post-processing.\nFor certain target correlations, we show that detecting qubit non-projective\nmeasurements is robust under {\\it arbitrary} depolarising noise, except in the\nlimiting case. We extend this task for qutrits and demonstrate that some\ncorrelations achievable via local non-projective measurements cannot be\nreproduced by both parties performing the same qutrit {\\it projective\nsimulable} measurements on their pre-shared state. We provide numerical\nevidence for the robustness of this scheme under {\\it arbitrary} depolarising\nnoise. For a more generic consideration (bipartite and tripartite scenario), we\nprovide numerical evidence for a projective-simulable bound on the reward\nfunction for our task.

As chatbots\nevolved from rule-based systems to those powered by large language models\n(LLMs), evaluating the effectiveness of their personality design has become\nincreasingly complex, particularly due to the open-ended nature of\ninteractions. A recent and widely adopted method for assessing the personality\ndesign of LLM-based chatbots is the use of self-report questionnaires. These\nquestionnaires, often borrowed from established human personality inventories,\nask the chatbot to rate itself on various personality traits. Can LLM-based\nchatbots meaningfully \"self-report\" their personality? We created 500 chatbots\nwith distinct personality designs and evaluated the validity of their\nself-report personality scores by examining human perceptions formed during\ninteractions with these chatbots. Our findings indicate that the chatbot's\nanswers on human personality scales exhibit weak correlations with both\nhuman-perceived personality traits and the overall interaction quality.

Since this standard ruler relies only on the statistical\nproximity of the dark sirens and galaxies (a general property of large-scale\nstructures), it is essentially model-independent: the correlation is maximal\nwhen both redshift and $D_L$ shells coincide.

Although recent dust polarization surveys,\nprimarily with Planck, have shown that molecular clouds are strongly\nmagnetized, the significance of magnetic fields in Bok globules has largely\nbeen limited to individual case studies, lacking a broader statistical\nunderstanding. In this work, we introduce a comprehensive optical polarimetric\nsurvey of 21 Bok globules. Using Gaia and near-IR photometric data, we produce\nextinction maps for each target. Using the radiative torque alignment model\ncustomized to the physical properties of the Bok globule, we characterize the\npolarization efficiency of one representative globule as a function of its\nvisual extinction. We thus find our optical polarimetric data to be a good\nprobe of the globule's magnetic field. Our statistical analysis of the\norientation of elongated extinction structures relative to the plane-of-sky\nmagnetic field orientations shows they do not align strictly parallel or\nperpendicular. Instead, the data is best explained by a bimodal distribution,\nwith structures oriented at projected angles that are either parallel or\nperpendicular. The plane-of-sky magnetic field strengths on the scales probed\nby optical polarimetric data are measured using the Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi\ntechnique. We then derive magnetic properties such as Alfv\\'en Mach numbers and\nmass-to-magnetic flux ratios.

These challenges need to be\novercome for a better understanding of the r-process in a broader context. To\nunderstand how the abundances of the third r-process peak are synthesised and\nevolve in the Universe, a homogeneous chemical analysis of metal-poor stars\nusing high quality data observed in the blue region of the electromagnetic\nspectrum (< 400 nm) is necessary. We provide a homogeneous set of abundances\nfor the third r-process peak (Os, Ir, Pt) and Hf, increasing by up to one order\nof magnitude their availability in the literature. A classical 1D, local\nthermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) analysis of four elements (Hf, Os, Ir, Pt) is\nperformed, using ATLAS model atmospheres to fit synthetic spectra in high\nresolution (> 40,000), high signal-to-noise ratio, of 52 red giants observed\nwith UVES/VLT. Due to the heavy line blending involved, a careful determination\nof upper limits and uncertainties is done. The observational results are\ncompared with state-of-the-art nucleosynthesis models. Our sample displays\nlarger abundances of Ir (Z=77) in comparison to Os (Z=76), which have been\nmeasured in a few stars in the past. The results also suggest decoupling\nbetween abundances of third r-process peak elements with respect to Eu (rare\nearth element) in Eu-poor stars. This seems to contradict a co-production\nscenario of Eu and the third r-process peak elements Os, Ir, and Pt in the\nprogenitors of these objects. Our results are challenging to explain from the\nnucleosynthetic point of view: the observationally derived abundances indicate\nthe need for an additional early, primary formation channel (or a non-robust\nr-process).",

Employing a combination of Bethe\nAnsatz, exact diagonalization, and density matrix renormalization group (DMRG)\nmethods, we explore the intricate phase diagram that emerges when the impurity\nis coupled either integrably or non-integrably to the chain. For integrable\nantiferromagnetic impurity couplings, we identify two distinct phases: the\nKondo phase, where the impurity is screened by a multiparticle Kondo effect,\nand the antiferromagnetic bound mode phase, where an exponentially localized\nbound state screens the impurity in the ground state. When coupled\nferromagnetically while maintaining integrability, the impurity behaves as a\nfree spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$, leading to either a ferromagnetic bound mode phase,\nwhere the impurity remains free in the ground state but may be screened at\nhigher energy excitations or an unscreened (or local moment) phase where\nimpurity remains unscreened in every eigenstate whereas for non-integrable\nferromagnetic coupling, the impurity is not free. In the case of non-integrable\nantiferromagnetic coupling, a third phase emerges, characterized by mid-gap\nexcitations with two degenerate states below the mass gap on top of the Kondo\nand antiferromagnetic bound mode phases, further enriching the phase diagram.\nOur findings highlight the nuanced behavior of boundary impurities in gapped\nantiferromagnetic systems, offering new insights into Kondo effects and\nimpurity screening in the presence of fractionalized edge modes and bulk\nantiferromagnetic order.",

We then compute the\ntorus conformal blocks and find that the twist two-point function, and\ntherefore the R\\'enyi entropy, is two-periodic along each cycle of the torus.\nThe second R\\'enyi entropy for a single interval of the $\\rm E_{8,1}$ WZW model\nhas the universal logarithmic divergent behavior in the decompactification\nlimit of the torus, as expected as well as the interval approaches the size of\nthe cycle of the torus. Furthermore, we see that the $q$-expansion is UV\nfinite, apart from the leading universal logarithmic divergence. We also find\nthat there is a divergence as the size of the entangling interval approaches\nthe cycle of the torus, suggesting that gluing two tori along an interval the\nsize of a cycle is a singular limit.",

This research explores the potential\nof multimodal Integral Field Spectroscopy (IFS) applied to galaxy analysis\nthrough the development and evaluation of a tool that complements the\nvisualization of datacubes with sound. The proposed application,\n\\textit{ViewCube}, provides interactive visualizations and sonifications of\nspectral information across a two-dimensional field-of-view, and its\narchitecture is designed to incorporate future sonification approaches. The\nfirst sonification implementation described in this article uses a deep\nlearning module to generate binaural unsupervised auditory representations.

Out of 67 participants who\ncompleted the questionnaire, 42 had the opportunity to test the application in\nperson prior to filling out the online survey. 81\\% of these 42 participants\nexpressed the good interactive response of the tool, 79.1\\% of the complete\nsample found the application \"Useful\", and 58.2\\% rated its aesthetics as\n\"Good\".

The $\\Sigma_{\\rm\nSFR}{\\rm MS}$\\ is already observed at cosmic morning ($z\\sim7.5$).

Notably,\ndata scaling has been primarily driven by automatic data pipelines, which focus\non the self-instruction of LLMs. The paradigm has been taken for granted for\nquite some time, but the study of the effectiveness of scaling with these data\nhas been neglected for a long time. In this context, this work revisits scaling\nwith synthetic data and focuses on developing video-LLMs from a data-centric\nperspective. Our primary study approach involves fine-tuning pre-trained\nimage-LLMs with video data and examining learning efficiency through data\nscaling. Results from our preliminary experiments reveal a low learning\nefficiency phenomenon when simply scaling up video data samples, which, through\nour probing, can be ascribed to a lack of instruction diversity. Aiming at this\nissue, we propose a data augmentation method called Sparrow, which synthesizes\nvideo-like samples from pure text instruction data. Mixing these synthetic\nsamples with the video data enables a more efficient training scheme. Through\ncomprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed method achieves\nperformance comparable to or even superior to that of baselines trained with\nsignificantly more samples.

An effective merging scheme is introduced to\nfacilitate the growth and refinement of AlphaTablets. Through iterative\noptimization and merging, we reconstruct complete and accurate 3D planes with\nsolid surfaces and clear boundaries. Extensive experiments on the ScanNet\ndataset demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in 3D planar reconstruction,\nunderscoring the great potential of AlphaTablets as a generic 3D plane\nrepresentation for various applications.

Lanthanide-doped nanoparticles (LnNP) are a unique type of\nupconversion nanoconverter, which can realize ultralarge anti-Stokes shift\n(>1000 nm) and high photostability, without photo-bleaching and photo-blinking.\nThe excitation wavelength of LnNPs has been limited to the second near-infrared\nwindow (1000-1700 nm), mainly sensitized by erbium ions with absorption\ncentered around 1.5 $\\mu$m. Here, we demonstrate novel self-sensitized holmium\n(Ho)-doped nanoconverters to further expand the sensitization range to the\nshort-wave infrared at 2 $\\mu$m and achieve efficient upconversion to 640 nm.\nWe show that this upconversion is a 4-photon conversion process with an\nunderlying energy transfer upconversion mechanism. Via careful control of\ndopant concentration and shelling we achieve a relative\nupconversion-to-downconversion efficiency up to 15.2%, more than half the\ntheoretical maximum. The placement of the Ho doped LnNPs into a plasmonic\nnanocavity device enables large gains in emission intensity (up to 32-fold),\ndue to the dramatic shortening of the emission lifetime of Ho from 29 $\\mu$s to\n<1 ns, indicating a high Purcell-enhancement factor of 3x10$^4$.

The conventional batch-to-batch matching mechanism is ideal for\nsmall-scale datasets and includes bi-level optimization methods on models and\nsyntheses, such as FRePo, RCIG, and RaT-BPTT, as well as other methods like\ndistribution matching, gradient matching, and weight trajectory matching.\nConversely, batch-to-global matching typifies decoupled methods, which are\nparticularly advantageous for large-scale datasets. This approach has garnered\nsubstantial interest within the community, as seen in SRe$^2$L, G-VBSM, WMDD,\nand CDA. A primary challenge with the second approach is the lack of diversity\namong syntheses within each class since samples are optimized independently and\nthe same global supervision signals are reused across different synthetic\nimages. In this study, we propose a new Diversity-driven EarlyLate Training\n(DELT) scheme to enhance the diversity of images in batch-to-global matching\nwith less computation. Our approach is conceptually simple yet effective, it\npartitions predefined IPC samples into smaller subtasks and employs local\noptimizations to distill each subset into distributions from distinct phases,\nreducing the uniformity induced by the unified optimization process. These\ndistilled images from the subtasks demonstrate effective generalization when\napplied to the entire task. We conduct extensive experiments on CIFAR,\nTiny-ImageNet, ImageNet-1K, and its sub-datasets. Our approach outperforms the\nprevious state-of-the-art by 2$\\sim$5% on average across different datasets and\nIPCs (images per class), increasing diversity per class by more than 5% while\nreducing synthesis time by up to 39.3% for enhancing the training efficiency.\nCode is available at: https://github.com/VILA-Lab/DELT.",

Our approach makes two\nkey contributions: a data curation strategy from the StyleGAN-based relighting\nmodel for our training, and a modified diffusion-based ControlNet that\nprocesses both latent intrinsic properties from the source image and latent\nextrinsic properties from the target image. We further improve lighting\ntransfer through a learned adaptor (MLP) that injects the target's latent\nextrinsic properties via cross-attention and fine-tuning.\n  Unlike traditional ControlNet, which generates images with conditional maps\nfrom a single scene, LumiNet processes latent representations from two\ndifferent images - preserving geometry and albedo from the source while\ntransferring lighting characteristics from the target.

Existing learning-based methods heavily\nrely on the Linear Blend Skinning (LBS) of minimally-clothed human models like\nSMPL to model deformation. However, they struggle to handle loose clothing,\nsuch as long dresses, where the canonicalization process becomes ill-defined\nwhen the clothing is far from the body, leading to disjointed and fragmented\nresults. To overcome this limitation, we propose FreeCloth, a novel hybrid\nframework to model challenging clothed humans. Our core idea is to use\ndedicated strategies to model different regions, depending on whether they are\nclose to or distant from the body. Specifically, we segment the human body into\nthree categories: unclothed, deformed, and generated. We simply replicate\nunclothed regions that require no deformation. For deformed regions close to\nthe body, we leverage LBS to handle the deformation. As for the generated\nregions, which correspond to loose clothing areas, we introduce a novel\nfree-form, part-aware generator to model them, as they are less affected by\nmovements. This free-form generation paradigm brings enhanced flexibility and\nexpressiveness to our hybrid framework, enabling it to capture the intricate\ngeometric details of challenging loose clothing, such as skirts and dresses.\nExperimental results on the benchmark dataset featuring loose clothing\ndemonstrate that FreeCloth achieves state-of-the-art performance with superior\nvisual fidelity and realism, particularly in the most challenging cases.",

    "abstract": "Level densities are often parametrized using the back-shifted Bethe formula\n(BBF) for nuclei that possess experimental data for s-wave neutron resonance\naverage spacings and a complete discrete level sequence at low excitation\nenergies. However, these parametrizations require the additional modeling of\nthe dependence of the spin-cutoff parameter on excitation energy. Here we avoid\nthe need to model the spin distribution of level densities by using the\nexperimental data to parametrize directly the state densities, for which the\nBBF does not depend on the spin-cutoff parameter. This approach allows for a\nlocal parameterization of state densities that is independent of the\nspin-cutoff parameter. We provide these parameters in a tabulated form for\napplications in nuclear reaction calculations and for testing microscopic\napproaches to state densities.",

    "abstract": "Safety concerns of Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have gradually\nbecome an important problem in various applications. Surprisingly, previous\nworks indicate a counterintuitive phenomenon that using textual unlearning to\nalign MLLMs achieves comparable safety performances with MLLMs aligned with\nimage text pairs. To explain such a phenomenon, we discover a Visual Safety\nInformation Leakage (VSIL) problem in existing multimodal safety benchmarks,\ni.e., the potentially risky content in the image has been revealed in the\ntextual query. Thus, MLLMs can easily refuse these sensitive image-text pairs\naccording to textual queries only, leading to unreliable cross-modality safety\nevaluation of MLLMs. We also conduct a further comparison experiment between\ntextual alignment and multimodal alignment to highlight this drawback. To this\nend, we construct multimodal Visual Leakless Safety Bench (VLSBench) with 2.2k\nimage-text pairs through an automated data pipeline. Experimental results\nindicate that VLSBench poses a significant challenge to both open-source and\nclose-source MLLMs, e.g., LLaVA, Qwen2-VL and GPT-4o. Besides, we empirically\ncompare textual and multimodal alignment methods on VLSBench and find that\ntextual alignment is effective enough for multimodal safety scenarios with\nVSIL, while multimodal alignment is preferable for safety scenarios without\nVSIL.

They\nrecorded the nucleosynthetic fingerprint of their parent stars and thus serve\nas valuable probes of these astrophysical sites. The most common types of\npresolar silicon carbide grains (called mainstream SiC grains) condensed in the\noutflows of asymptotic giant branch stars. Their measured silicon isotopic\nabundances are not significantly influenced by nucleosynthesis within the\nparent star, but rather represents the pristine stellar composition. Silicon\nisotopes can thus be used as a proxy for galactic chemical evolution. However,\nthe measured correlation of $^{29}$Si/$^{28}$Si versus $^{30}$Si/$^{28}$Si does\nnot agree with any current chemical evolution model. Here, we use a Monte Carlo\nmodel to vary nuclear reaction rates within their theoretical or experimental\nuncertainties and process them through stellar nucleosynthesis and galactic\nchemical evolution models to study the variation of silicon isotope abundances\nbased on these nuclear reaction rate uncertainties. We find that these\nuncertainties can indeed be responsible for the discrepancy between\nmeasurements and models and that the slope of the silicon isotope correlation\nline measured in mainstream SiC grains agrees with chemical evolution models\nwithin the nuclear reaction rate uncertainties.

While there are many algorithmic primitives to perform the required\ncalculations, all eventually lead to quantum gates operating on quantum bits,\nwith an order as determined by the structure of the objective function and the\nproperties of target hardware. When the structure of the problem representation\nis not aligned with structure and boundary conditions of the executing\nhardware, various overheads degrading the computation may arise, possibly\nnegating any possible quantum advantage.\n  Therefore, automatic transformations of problem representations play an\nimportant role in quantum computing when descriptions (semi-)targeted at humans\nmust be cast into forms that can be executed on quantum computers.\nMathematically equivalent formulations are known to result in substantially\ndifferent non-functional properties depending on hardware, algorithm and detail\nproperties of the problem. Given the current state of noisy intermediate-scale\nquantum (NISQ) hardware, these effects are considerably more pronounced than in\nclassical computing. Likewise, efficiency of the transformation itself is\nrelevant because possible quantum advantage may easily be eradicated by the\noverhead of transforming between representations. In this paper, we consider a\nspecific class of higher-level representations, i.e. polynomial unconstrained\nbinary optimisation problems, and devise novel automatic transformation\nmechanisms into widely used quadratic unconstrained binary optimisation\nproblems that substantially improve efficiency and versatility over the state\nof the art.

Our aim is to provide\nsome clarity about the status of justification, under various conditions, for\nimposing such constraints on the linearized theory in the $G_N\\to0$ limit as\nthey turn out to be of second-order.

Linearization (in)stabilities occur in\nany gauge-covariant field theory with non-linear equations and to address this\nin a unified framework, we translate the subject from the usual canonical\nformulation into a systematic covariant phase space language. This overcomes\ntheory-specific arguments, exhibiting the universal structure behind\n(in)stabilities, and permits us to cover arbitrary generally covariant\ntheories.

    "abstract": "The eigenvalues and eigenvectors of nonnormal matrices can be unstable under\nperturbations of their entries. This renders an obstacle to the analysis of\nnumerical algorithms for non-Hermitian eigenvalue problems. A recent technique\nto handle this issue is pseudospectral shattering [BGVKS23], showing that\nadding a random perturbation to any matrix has a regularizing effect on the\nstability of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Prior work has analyzed the\nregularizing effect of dense Gaussian perturbations, where independent noise is\nadded to every entry of a given matrix [BVKS20, BGVKS23, BKMS21, JSS21].\n  We show that the same effect can be achieved by adding a sparse random\nperturbation. In particular, we show that given any $n\\times n$ matrix $M$ of\npolynomially bounded norm: (a) perturbing $O(n\\log^2(n))$ random entries of $M$\nby adding i.i.d. complex Gaussians yields\n$\\log\\kappa_V(A)=O(\\text{poly}\\log(n))$ and $\\log\n(1/\\eta(A))=O(\\text{poly}\\log(n))$ with high probability; (b) perturbing\n$O(n^{1+\\alpha})$ random entries of $M$ for any constant $\\alpha>0$ yields\n$\\log\\kappa_V(A)=O_\\alpha(\\log(n))$ and $\\log(1/\\eta(A))=O_\\alpha(\\log(n))$\nwith high probability. Here, $\\kappa_V(A)$ denotes the condition number of the\neigenvectors of the perturbed matrix $A$ and $\\eta(A)$ denotes its minimum\neigenvalue gap.\n  A key mechanism of the proof is to reduce the study of $\\kappa_V(A)$ to\ncontrol of the pseudospectral area and minimum eigenvalue gap of $A$, which are\nfurther reduced to estimates on the least two singular values of shifts of $A$.\nWe obtain the required least singular value estimates via a streamlining of an\nargument of Tao and Vu [TV07] specialized to the case of sparse complex\nGaussian perturbations.",

In this\nstudy, we present a c-Si/TiO$_2$ heterojunction thin film solar cell (TFSC)\nwhere a pair of triangular HMDN comprised of Ag and AZO was utilized to enhance\nthe longer wavelength light absorption. The presence of the TiO$_2$ inverted\npyramid layer, in combination with the ITO and SiO$_2$-based pyramid layers at\nthe front, enhanced the shorter wavelength light absorption by increasing the\noptical path and facilitating the coupling of incoming light in photonic mode.\nConsequently, the average absorption by 1000 nm thick photoactive layer reached\n83.32 % for AM 1.5G within the wavelength range of 300 - 1100 nm which was\ninvestigated by employing the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method. The\nelectric field profile and current density profile demonstrated the respective\ncontributions of each layer in the absorption of light at shorter and longer\nwavelengths. The structure exhibited a short circuit current density ($J_{sc}$)\nof 37.96 mA/cm$^2$ and a power conversion efficiency ($PCE$) of 17.42 %.

We analyze the dynamics of a voltage-biased\nJosephson junction coupled to a photonic bath, represented as a long Josephson\njunction chain. Our findings show that the system can reach a non-equilibrium\nsteady state where the photonic degrees of freedom become significantly\noverheated, leading to a qualitative change in the current-voltage $I-V$ curve.\nThis phenomenon is analogous to the Joule effect observed in electrical\nconductors, where flowing current can substantially heat up electrons.\nRecognizing this effect is crucial for the many applications of high-impedance\nenvironments in quantum technologies.",

The goals of PB inference are two-fold: (i) to mitigate\nbias from errors in predictions and (ii) to improve efficiency relative to\ntraditional inference using only the gold-standard data. While early PB\ninference methods focused on bias, their ability to enhance efficiency remains\nunclear. We revisit a popular PB inference method and show that a simple\nmodification can be applied to guarantee improvements in efficiency beyond\nyielding valid inferences when the ML predictions are imperfect. The utility of\nthis approach in leveraging prediction-based outcomes to enhance efficiency is\ndemonstrated through extensive simulation studies and an application to the UK\nBiobank data.

The quantum system can be viewed as performing a\ncomplex mapping from an input time-series (the optical pulse) to an output\ntime-series (the systems response) which is often also an optical pulse. Using\nboth the transverse and non-integrable Ising models as examples, we show that\nnot only can temporal convolutional networks capture the input/output mapping\ngenerated by the system but can also be used to characterize the complexity of\nthe mapping. This measure of complexity is provided by the size of the smallest\nlatent space that is able to accurately model the mapping. We further find that\na generative model, in particular a variational auto-encoder, significantly\noutperforms traditional auto-encoders at learning the complex response of\nmany-body quantum systems. For the example that generated the most complex\nmapping, the variational auto-encoder produces outputs that have less than 10%\nerror for more than 90% of inputs across our test data.",

This enables watermarking 3DGS assets\nwith minimal fidelity trade-offs and prevents malicious users from removing the\nwatermarks from the model files, meeting the demands for invisibility and\nsecurity. 3) We present an Anti-distortion Message Extraction module to improve\nrobustness against various distortions.

Comparing with stellar and\nnebular emission models, we find that such a blue UV slope cannot be reproduced\nsolely by stellar models even with very young, metal-poor, or top-heavy\ncontiguous star formation associated with strong nebular continua making the UV\nslopes red, but with a high ionizing photon escape fraction,\n$f_\\mathrm{esc}^\\mathrm{ion} \\gtrsim 0.5$, for a weak nebular continuum.

A significant reason for the popularity of EF1 allocations\nis its simple fact of existence. It is known that EF1 allocations exist for two\nagents with arbitrary valuations; agents with doubly-monotone valuations;\nagents with Boolean valuations; and identical agents with negative Boolean\nvaluations.\n  We consider two new but natural classes of valuations, and partly extend\nresults on the existence of EF1 allocations to these valuations. Firstly, we\nconsider trilean valuations - an extension of Boolean valuations - when the\nvalue of any subset is 0, $a$, or $b$ for any integers $a$ and $b$. Secondly,\nwe define separable single-peaked valuations, when the set of items is\npartitioned into types. For each type, an agent's value is a single-peaked\nfunction of the number of items of the type. The value for a set of items is\nthe sum of values for the different types. We prove EF1 existence for identical\ntrilean valuations for any number of agents, and for separable single-peaked\nvaluations for three agents. For both classes of valuations, we also show that\nEFX allocations do not exist.",

This study extends the ensemble GANs (EGANs) framework to\ncapture the distribution of well log data and detect anomalies that fall\noutside of these distributions. The proposed approach compares the performance\nof traditional methods, such as Gaussian mixture models (GMMs), with EGANs in\ndetecting anomalies outside the expected data distributions. For the gamma ray\n(GR) dataset, EGANs achieved a precision of 0.62 and F1 score of 0.76,\noutperforming GMM's precision of 0.38 and F1 score of 0.54. Similarly, for\ntravel time (DT), EGANs achieved a precision of 0.70 and F1 score of 0.79,\nsurpassing GMM 0.56 and 0.71. In the neutron porosity (NPHI) dataset, EGANs\nrecorded a precision of 0.53 and F1 score of 0.68, outshining GMM 0.47 and\n0.61. For the bulk density (RHOB) dataset, EGANs achieved a precision of 0.52\nand an F1 score of 0.67, slightly outperforming GMM, which yielded a precision\nof 0.50 and an F1 score of 0.65. This work's novelty lies in applying EGANs for\nwell log data analysis, showcasing their ability to learn data patterns and\nidentify anomalies that deviate from them. This approach offers more reliable\nanomaly detection compared to traditional methods like GMM. The findings\nhighlight the potential of EGANs in enhancing anomaly detection for well log\ndata, delivering significant implications for optimizing drilling strategies\nand reservoir management through more accurate, data-driven insights into\nsubsurface characterization.",

We evaluated AIDetx on two benchmark datasets, achieving F1 scores\nexceeding 97% and 99%, respectively, highlighting its high accuracy. Compared\nto current methods, such as large language models (LLMs), AIDetx offers a more\ninterpretable and computationally efficient solution, significantly reducing\nboth training time and hardware requirements (e.g., no GPUs needed). The full\nimplementation is publicly available at https://github.com/AIDetx/AIDetx.",

Humans can reason\nnot only from a problem to a solution but also in reverse, i.e., start from the\nsolution and reason towards the problem. This often enhances overall reasoning\nperformance as it enables consistency checks between their forward and backward\nthinking. To enable Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform reverse thinking,\nwe introduce Reverse-Enhanced Thinking (RevThink), a framework composed of data\naugmentation and learning objectives. In RevThink, we augment the dataset by\ncollecting structured forward-backward reasoning from a teacher model,\nconsisting of: (1) the original question, (2) forward reasoning, (3) backward\nquestion, and (4) backward reasoning. We then employ three objectives to train\na smaller student model in a multi-task learning fashion: (a) generate forward\nreasoning from a question, (b) generate a backward question from a question,\nand (c) generate backward reasoning from the backward question. Experiments\nacross 12 datasets covering commonsense, math, and logical reasoning show an\naverage 13.53% improvement over the student model's zero-shot performance and a\n6.84% improvement over the strongest knowledge distillation baselines.\nMoreover, our method demonstrates sample efficiency -- using only 10% of the\ncorrect forward reasoning from the training data, it outperforms a standard\nfine-tuning method trained on 10x more forward reasoning.

While\nconventional approaches utilize dense Bird's Eye View (BEV)-based architectures\nfor depth estimation, contemporary query-based transformers excel in\ncamera-only detection through object-centric methodology.

In contrast to existing methods requiring computationally\nintensive BEV-grid rendering, SpaRC operates directly on encoded point\nfeatures, yielding substantial improvements in efficiency and accuracy.\nEmpirical evaluations on the nuScenes and TruckScenes benchmarks demonstrate\nthat SpaRC significantly outperforms existing dense BEV-based and sparse\nquery-based detectors.

    "abstract": "The I.I.D. Prophet Inequality is a fundamental problem where, given $n$\nindependent random variables $X_1,\\dots,X_n$ drawn from a known distribution\n$\\mathcal{D}$, one has to decide at every step $i$ whether to stop and accept\n$X_i$ or discard it forever and continue. The goal is to maximize or minimize\nthe selected value and compete against the all-knowing prophet. For\nmaximization, a tight constant-competitive guarantee of $\\approx 0.745$ is\nwell-known (Correa et al, 2019), whereas minimization is qualitatively\ndifferent: the optimal constant is distribution-dependent and can be\narbitrarily large (Livanos and Mehta, 2024).\n  In this paper, we provide a novel framework via the lens of Extreme Value\nTheory to analyze optimal threshold algorithms. We show that the competitive\nratio for the minimization setting has a closed form described by a function\n$\\Lambda$, which depends only on the extreme value index $\\gamma$; in\nparticular, it corresponds to $\\Lambda(\\gamma)$ for $\\gamma \\leq 0$. Despite\nthe contrast of maximization and minimization, our framework turns out to be\nuniversal and we recover the results of (Kennedy and Kertz, 1991) for\nmaximization as well. Surprisingly, the optimal competitive ratio for\nmaximization is given by the same function $\\Lambda(\\gamma)$, but for $\\gamma\n\\geq 0$. Along the way, we obtain several results on the algorithm and the\nprophet's objectives from the perspective of extreme value theory, which might\nbe of independent interest.\n  We next study single-threshold algorithms for minimization. Using extreme\nvalue theory, we generalize the results of (Livanos and Mehta, 2024) which hold\nonly for special classes of distributions, and obtain poly-logarithmic in $n$\nguarantees. Finally, we consider the $k$-multi-unit prophet inequality for\nminimization and show that there exist constant-competitive single-threshold\nalgorithms when $k \\geq \\log{n}$.",

Both approaches assume a\nmagnetohydrostatic equilibrium where the Lorentz force is balanced by a\npressure gradient, and include gravity and thermal diffusion. The simulations\nincorporate finite resistivity and viscosity and span the full range from\nstable to highly supercritical regimes for the first time. The global linear\nanalysis reveals two classes of unstable nonaxisymmetric $m=1$ modes.\nHigh-latitude modes grow at Alfv\\'enic rates with short radial scales,\nconsistent with local WKB solutions. Low-latitude modes, missed by local\nanalyses, show larger radial scales and reduced growth rates due to the\nstabilizing buoyancy. Simulations support these findings and yield field\nstrength thresholds for both instability onset and the transition between\nglobal and WKB regimes. These thresholds correspond to the roots of two\nalgebraic equations of the form $B_\\phi^{3/4} - a_1 \\mathcal{A}_1 B_\\phi^{1/4}\n- a_0 \\mathcal{A}_0 = 0$, where $\\mathcal{A}_0$, $\\mathcal{A}_1$ depend on the\nfluid properties, and $a_0$, $a_1$ are simulation-derived coefficients.\nCombining our results with stellar evolution models of low-mass stars, we find\nthat outer radiative cores of red giants are generally unstable, while deeper\ndegenerate regions require toroidal fields above $10-100$ kG for instability.\nOur findings may help to constrain asteroseismic magnetic field detection and\nangular momentum transport in red giant cores, and provide a framework for\nidentifying instability conditions in other stars with radiative interiors.",

Additionally, most of these unified solutions exhibit\nsignificant performance issues, including higher equal error rates or lower\naccuracy for specific attacks. To overcome these issues, we present the\nparallel stacked aggregation network (PSA-Net), a lightweight framework\ndesigned as an anti-spoofing defense system for voice-controlled smart IoT\ndevices. The PSA-Net processes raw audios directly and eliminates the need for\ndataset-dependent handcrafted features or pre-computed spectrograms.\nFurthermore, PSA-Net employs a split-transform-aggregate approach, which\ninvolves the segmentation of utterances, the extraction of intrinsic\ndifferentiable embeddings through convolutions, and the aggregation of them to\ndistinguish legitimate from spoofed audios. In contrast to existing deep\nResnet-oriented solutions, we incorporate cardinality as an additional\ndimension in our network, which enhances the PSA-Net ability to generalize\nacross diverse attacks.

    "abstract": "Neuroplasticity, the ability of the nervous system to adapt throughout an\norganism's lifespan, offers potential as both a biomarker and treatment target\nfor neuropsychiatric conditions. Psychedelics, a burgeoning category of drugs,\nare increasingly prominent in psychiatric research, prompting inquiries into\ntheir mechanisms of action. Distinguishing themselves from traditional\nmedications, psychedelics demonstrate rapid and enduring therapeutic effects\nafter a single or few administrations, believed to stem from their\nneuroplasticity-enhancing properties. This review examines how classic\npsychedelics (e.g., LSD, psilocybin, N,N-DMT) and non-classic psychedelics\n(e.g., ketamine, MDMA) influence neuroplasticity. Drawing from preclinical and\nclinical studies, we explore the molecular, structural, and functional changes\ntriggered by these agents. Animal studies suggest psychedelics induce\nheightened sensitivity of the nervous system to environmental stimuli\n(meta-plasticity), re-opening developmental windows for long-term structural\nchanges (hyper-plasticity), with implications for mood and behavior.\nTranslating these findings to humans faces challenges due to limitations in\ncurrent imaging techniques. Nonetheless, promising new directions for human\nresearch are emerging, including the employment of novel positron-emission\ntomography (PET) radioligands, non-invasive brain stimulation methods, and\nmultimodal approaches. By elucidating the interplay between psychedelics and\nneuroplasticity, this review informs the development of targeted interventions\nfor neuropsychiatric disorders and advances understanding of psychedelics'\ntherapeutic potential.",

Loop integrals\ncan be expanded in a power series in the ratio of the decuplet-octet baryon\nmass difference to the pseudoscalar meson mass and the first three terms in the\nseries are retained and evaluated. The universal baryon axial vector current so\nconstructed is neither diagonal nor off-diagonal in the sense that it can\nconnect baryon states of either different or equal spins to obtain appropriate\naxial vector couplings. Processes of interest are found in octet-baryon and\ndecuplet-baryon semileptonic decays and strong decays of decuplet baryons.

    "abstract": "The indirect detection of dark matter (DM) through its annihilation products\nis one of the primary strategies for DM detection. One of the least constrained\nclasses of models is neutrinophilic DM, because the annihilation products,\nweakly interacting neutrinos, are challenging to observe. Here, we consider a\nscenario where MeV-mass DM exclusively annihilates to the third neutrino mass\neigenstate, which is predominantly of tau and muon flavor. In such a scenario,\nthe potential detection rate of the neutrinos originating from the DM\nannihilation in our Galaxy in the conventional detectors would be suppressed by\nup to approximately two orders of magnitude. This is because the best\nsensitivity of such detectors for neutrinos with energies below approximately\n100 MeV is for electron neutrino flavor. In this work, we highlight the\npotential of large-scale DM detectors in uncovering such signals in the tens of\nMeV range of DM masses. In addition, we discuss how coincident signals in\ndirect detection DM experiments and upcoming neutrino detectors such as DUNE,\nHyper-Kamiokande, and JUNO could provide new perspectives on the DM problem.",

In this paper, we present the development and evaluation of a\nplatform designed to interactively improve object detection models. The\nplatform allows uploading and annotating images as well as fine-tuning object\ndetection models. Users can then manually review and refine annotations,\nfurther creating improved snapshots that are used for automatic object\ndetection on subsequent image uploads - a process we refer to as semi-automatic\nannotation resulting in a significant gain in annotation efficiency.\n  Whereas iterative refinement of model results to speed up annotation has\nbecome common practice, we are the first to quantitatively evaluate its\nbenefits with respect to time, effort, and interaction savings. Our\nexperimental results show clear evidence for a significant time reduction of up\nto 53% for semi-automatic compared to manual annotation.

    "abstract": "The simulation of high Reynolds number (Re) separated turbulent flows faces\nsignificant problems for decades: large eddy simulation (LES) is\ncomputationally too expensive, and Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS)\nmethods and hybrid RANS-LES methods often provide unreliable results. This has\nserious consequences, we are currently unable to reliably predict very high Re\nregimes, which hampers applications and our understanding of turbulence\nstructures. The paper reports the advantages of a strict mathematical approach,\ncontinuous eddy simulation (CES), to derive partially resolving turbulence\nmodels. In contrast to popular hybrid RANS-LES, this minimal error approach\nincludes a dynamic modification of the turbulence model in response to the\nactual flow resolution: the model can increase (decrease) its contribution to\nthe simulation in dependence of a low (high) flow resolution. This property is\nthe essential requirement to seamlessly cover RANS and LES regimes. The CES\nmodeling approach offers essential advantages regarding its functionality:\nbasically, it is independent of a variety of simulation settings applied in\npopular hybrid RANS-LES to improve the model performance. In addition, the CES\ncomputational cost can be below the cost of other hybrid RANS-LES and LES by\norders of magnitude. Essential simulation performance advantages of CES\nsimulations are described here with respect to three complex flow applications:\nperiodic hill flows at high Reynolds number, the NASA wall-mounted hump flow,\nand the Bachalo & Johnson axisymmetric transonic bump flow.",

Auditing clinical documentation on an\nelectronic health record (EHR) is challenging as it requires resource-intensive\nmanual efforts to identify keywords in relevant sections of specific forms.\nFurthermore, clinicians and healthcare professionals often do not use keywords;\ntheir clinical language can vary greatly and may contain various jargon and\nacronyms. Also, the relevant information may be recorded elsewhere. This study\ndescribes how we developed advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP)\nalgorithms, a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI), to analyse EHR data\nautomatically. Method: Advanced Optical Character Recognition techniques were\nused to process unstructured data sets, such as portable document format (pdf)\nfiles. Free text data was cleaned and pre-processed using Normalisation of Free\nText techniques. We developed algorithms and tools to unify the free text.\nFinally, the formulation was checked for the presence of each concept based on\nsimilarity using NLP-powered semantic matching techniques. Results: We\nextracted information indicative of formulation and assessed it to cover the\nrelevant concepts. This was achieved using a Weighted Score to obtain a\nConfidence Level. Conclusion: The rigour to which formulation is completed is\ncrucial to effectively using EHRs, ensuring correct and timely identification,\nengagement and interventions that may potentially avoid many suicide attempts\nand suicides.",

Most\nexisting MERC methods assume each utterance has complete modalities,\noverlooking the common issue of incomplete modalities in real-world scenarios.\nRecently, graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved notable results in\nIncomplete Multimodal Emotion Recognition in Conversations (IMERC). However,\ntraditional GNNs focus on binary relationships between nodes, limiting their\nability to capture more complex, higher-order information. Moreover, repeated\nmessage passing can cause over-smoothing, reducing their capacity to preserve\nessential high-frequency details. To address these issues, we propose a\nSpectral Domain Reconstruction Graph Neural Network (SDR-GNN) for incomplete\nmultimodal learning in conversational emotion recognition. SDR-GNN constructs\nan utterance semantic interaction graph using a sliding window based on both\nspeaker and context relationships to model emotional dependencies. To capture\nhigher-order and high-frequency information, SDR-GNN utilizes weighted\nrelationship aggregation, ensuring consistent semantic feature extraction\nacross utterances. Additionally, it performs multi-frequency aggregation in the\nspectral domain, enabling efficient recovery of incomplete modalities by\nextracting both high- and low-frequency information. Finally, multi-head\nattention is applied to fuse and optimize features for emotion recognition.\nExtensive experiments on various real-world datasets demonstrate that our\napproach is effective in incomplete multimodal learning and outperforms current\nstate-of-the-art methods.",

Our analysis reveals that the\ndistribution of transmission eigenvalues undergoes a transition from a\nmonomodal to a bimodal profile, and back to monomodal, as the frequency\napproaches the resonant frequency of the particles. Moreover, the distribution\nof dwell-time eigenvalues broadens significantly near resonance, with the\nlongest lifetimes exceeding the median by several orders of magnitude. These\nresults are explained by examining how frequency $\\omega$ affects the transport\nmean free path of light, $\\ell(\\omega)$, and the energy transport velocity,\n$v_E(\\omega)$, which in turn shape the observed distributions. We demonstrate\nthe strong potential of wavefront shaping to enhance both transmission and\nenergy storage in resonant disordered media. In the diffusive regime, where the\nsystem thickness $L$ exceeds the mean free path, both transmission and dwell\ntime can be enhanced by a factor $\\varpropto L/\\ell(\\omega) \\gg 1$ when using\nwavefronts associated with the largest eigenvalues instead of plane waves.

    "abstract": "Ensuring safety via safety filters in real-world robotics presents\nsignificant challenges, particularly when the system dynamics is complex or\nunavailable. To handle this issue, learning-based safety filters recently\ngained popularity, which can be classified as model-based and model-free\nmethods. Existing model-based approaches requires various assumptions on system\nmodel (e.g., control-affine), which limits their application in complex\nsystems, and existing model-free approaches need substantial modifications to\nstandard RL algorithms and lack versatility. This paper proposes a simple,\nplugin-and-play, and effective model-free safety filter learning framework. We\nintroduce a novel reward formulation and use Q-learning to learn Q-value\nfunctions to safeguard arbitrary task specific nominal policies via filtering\nout their potentially unsafe actions. The threshold used in the filtering\nprocess is supported by our theoretical analysis. Due to its model-free nature\nand simplicity, our framework can be seamlessly integrated with various RL\nalgorithms. We validate the proposed approach through simulations on double\nintegrator and Dubin's car systems and demonstrate its effectiveness in\nreal-world experiments with a soft robotic limb.",

Clarity about this\nquestion matters: in absence of alternatives, a reliable and universal theory\ninvolving the law of the wall is needed to provide essential guideline for the\nvalidation of theory, computational methods, and experimental studies of very\nhigh Reynolds number (Re) flows. The paper presents an analysis of concepts\nused to derive controversial conclusions.

On the other hand, realizability implies universality: models in\nconsistency with physical requirements do not need to be adjusted to different\nflows. There are essential advantages of a universal law of the wall: it\nenables the design of accurate turbulence models and it provides a bridge\nbetween finite Re observations and asymptotic structural theories of\nturbulence.",

Difficulties mainly arise when integrating dynamic\nenvironments across the IS lifecycle. A traditional approach is a registry that\nprovides the API documentation of the systems' endpoints. Large Language Models\n(LLMs) have shown to be capable of automatically creating system integrations\n(e.g., as service composition) based on this documentation but require concise\ninput due to input token limitations, especially regarding comprehensive API\ndescriptions. Currently, it is unknown how best to preprocess these API\ndescriptions. Within this work, we (i) analyze the usage of Retrieval Augmented\nGeneration (RAG) for endpoint discovery and the chunking, i.e., preprocessing,\nof OpenAPIs to reduce the input token length while preserving the most relevant\ninformation. To further reduce the input token length for the composition\nprompt and improve endpoint retrieval, we propose (ii) a Discovery Agent that\nonly receives a summary of the most relevant endpoints and retrieves details on\ndemand.

Symptoms of plant diseases are often seen on\ntheir leaves. The leaf images in existing datasets have been collected either\nunder controlled conditions or in the field. The majority of previous studies\nhave focused on identifying leaf diseases using images captured in controlled\nlaboratory settings, often achieving high performance.

The objective of this study is to evaluate the\nimpact of a data augmentation approach that involves removing complex\nbackgrounds from leaf images on the classification performance of apple leaf\ndiseases in images captured under real world conditions. To achieve this\nobjective, the lightweight pre-trained MobileNetV2 deep learning model was\nfine-tuned and subsequently used to evaluate the impact of expanding the\ntraining dataset with background-removed images on classification performance.\nExperimental results show that this augmentation strategy enhances\nclassification accuracy. Specifically, using the Adam optimizer, the proposed\nmethod achieved a classification accuracy of 98.71% on the Plant Pathology\ndatabase, representing an approximately 3% improvement and outperforming\nstate-of-the-art methods.

We use\n$\\mathcal{G}_{m_1, m_2}$ to represent the class of graphs $G$ that satisfy the\nfollowing conditions: for any subgraph $H$ of $G$, the inequality $e(H) \\leq\nm_1 v(H)$ holds, and for any bipartite subgraph $H$ of $G$, the inequality\n$e(H) \\leq m_2 v(H)$ holds. A graph $G$ is $\\alpha$-sparse if $e(H) \\leq \\alpha\nv(H)$ for every subgraph $H$ of $G$.\n  In this paper, we show that there is a small constant $r_0\\in [4m_1,\n6.21m_1]$ solely determined by both $m_1$ and $m_2$, such that for any graph\n$G\\in \\mathcal{G}_{m_1, m_2}$ (where the ratio $m_1/m_2$ is between $1$ and\n$1.8$ inclusive) with a maximum degree $\\Delta(G)\\geq r_0$, an equitable\n$r$-coloring is guaranteed for all $r\\geq \\Delta(G)$.

    "abstract": "The concept of a monitoring edge-geodetic set (MEG-set) in a graph $G$,\ndenoted $MEG(G)$, refers to a subset of vertices $MEG(G)\\subseteq V(G)$ such\nthat every edge $e$ in $G$ is monitored by some pair of vertices $ u, v \\in\nMEG(G)$, where $e$ lies on all shortest paths between $u$ and $v$. The minimum\nnumber of vertices required to form such a set is called the monitoring\nedge-geodetic number, denoted $meg(G)$. The primary motivation for studying\n$MEG$-sets in previous works arises from scenarios in which certain edges are\nremoved from $G$. In these cases, the vertices of the $MEG$-set are responsible\nfor detecting these deletions. Such detection is crucial for identifying which\nedges have been removed from $G$ and need to be repaired. In real life,\nrepairing these edges may be costly, or sometimes it is impossible to repair\nedges. In this case, the original $MEG$-set may no longer be effective in\nmonitoring the modified graph. This highlights the importance of reassessing\nand adapting the $MEG$-set after edge deletions. This work investigates the\nmonitoring edge-geodetic properties of graphs, focusing on how the removal of\n$k$ edges affects the structure of a graph and influences its monitoring\ncapabilities. Specifically, we explore how the monitoring edge-geodetic number\n$meg(G)$ changes when $k$ edges are removed. The study aims to compare the\nmonitoring properties of the original graph with those of the modified graph\nand to understand the impact of edge deletions.",

    "abstract": "We present an efficient reduction that converts any machine learning\nalgorithm into an interactive protocol, enabling collaboration with another\nparty (e.g., a human) to achieve consensus on predictions and improve accuracy.\nThis approach imposes calibration conditions on each party, which are\ncomputationally and statistically tractable relaxations of Bayesian\nrationality. These conditions are sensible even in prior-free settings,\nrepresenting a significant generalization of Aumann's classic \"agreement\ntheorem.\"\n  In our protocol, the model first provides a prediction. The human then\nresponds by either agreeing or offering feedback. The model updates its state\nand revises its prediction, while the human may adjust their beliefs. This\niterative process continues until the two parties reach agreement. Initially,\nwe study a setting that extends Aumann's Agreement Theorem, where parties aim\nto agree on a one-dimensional expectation by iteratively sharing their current\nestimates. Here, we recover the convergence theorem of Aaronson'05 under weaker\nassumptions. We then address the case where parties hold beliefs over\ndistributions with d outcomes, exploring two feedback mechanisms. The first\ninvolves vector-valued estimates of predictions, while the second adopts a\ndecision-theoretic approach: the human, needing to take an action from a finite\nset based on utility, communicates their utility-maximizing action at each\nround. In this setup, the number of rounds until agreement remains independent\nof d. Finally, we generalize to scenarios with more than two parties, where\ncomputational complexity scales linearly with the number of participants. Our\nprotocols rely on simple, efficient conditions and produce predictions that\nsurpass the accuracy of any individual party's alone.",

Internal tides are widespread in the\nMediterranean Sea.

    "abstract": "We present a scalable machine learning (ML) framework for large-scale kinetic\nMonte Carlo (kMC) simulations of itinerant electron Ising systems. As the\neffective interactions between Ising spins in such itinerant magnets are\nmediated by conducting electrons, the calculation of energy change due to a\nlocal spin update requires solving an electronic structure problem. Such\nrepeated electronic structure calculations could be overwhelmingly prohibitive\nfor large systems. Assuming the locality principle, a convolutional neural\nnetwork (CNN) model is developed to directly predict the effective local field\nand the corresponding energy change associated with a given spin update based\non Ising configuration in a finite neighborhood. As the kernel size of the CNN\nis fixed at a constant, the model can be directly scalable to kMC simulations\nof large lattices. Our approach is reminiscent of the ML force-field models\nwidely used in first-principles molecular dynamics simulations. Applying our ML\nframework to a square-lattice double-exchange Ising model, we uncover unusual\ncoarsening of ferromagnetic domains at low temperatures. Our work highlights\nthe potential of ML methods for large-scale modeling of similar itinerant\nsystems with discrete dynamical variables.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, origin-destination (OD) demand prediction has gained\nsignificant attention for its profound implications in urban development.\nExisting data-driven deep learning methods primarily focus on the spatial or\ntemporal dependency between regions yet neglecting regions' fundamental\nfunctional difference. Though knowledge-driven physical methods have\ncharacterised regions' functions by their radiation and attraction capacities,\nthese functions are defined on numerical factors like population without\nconsidering regions' intrinsic nominal attributes, e.g., a region is a\nresidential or industrial district. Moreover, the complicated relationships\nbetween two types of capacities, e.g., the radiation capacity of a residential\ndistrict in the morning will be transformed into the attraction capacity in the\nevening, are totally missing from physical methods.\n  In this paper, we not only generalize the physical radiation and attraction\ncapacities into the deep learning framework with the extended capability to\nfulfil regions' functions, but also present a new model that captures the\nrelationships between two types of capacities. Specifically, we first model\nregions' radiation and attraction capacities using a bilateral branch network,\neach equipped with regions' attribute representations. We then describe the\ntransformation relationship of different capacities of the same region using a\nhypergraph-based parameter generation method. We finally unveil the competition\nrelationship of different regions with the same attraction capacity through\ncluster-based adversarial learning. Extensive experiments on two datasets\ndemonstrate the consistent improvements of our method over the state-of-the-art\nbaselines, as well as the good explainability of regions' functions using their\nnominal attributes.",

We investigate the position\nfluctuation spectrum and the output field spectrum, finding that at G =0, the\nsystem displays a single peak, indicative of weak coupling between the optical\nand phononic modes. As G increases (e.g., G =0.1 kappa_a, 0.2 kappa_a, 0.4\nkappa_a, we observe a transition to double peak, which reflects stronger\ncoupling in the vicinity of cavity along with phonon modes that leads to normal\nmode splitting (NMS) in cavity magnomechanic system.

Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations driven by\nmachine-learning force fields (MLFF), which can study the interface dynamics\nunder near ab-initio accuracy, provides a powerful technique to reveal the\nformation mechanism of SWCNTs. Here, we develop a cobalt-carbon MLFF and\nperform growth simulations on a cobalt catalyst to investigate the chirality\npreference of the growth of SWCNTs under the vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) regime.\nThrough microkinetic modeling, we reproduce the observed growth and defect\nkinetics, demonstrating their dependence on the chirality. It is observed that\nwhile the initial chirality assignment is likely related to the configurational\ndegeneracy of the nanotube caps, pentagon defects immediately form and resolve\nafter nucleation. Such processes, which we name as diameter control mechanisms,\nnot only control the diameter toward an optimum but also shift the chirality\ndistribution drastically. Our work therefore offers a microkinetic modeling\nworkflow for the chirality-dependent kinetics of the SWCNTs, highlighting the\nimportant contribution of the defect kinetics to the chirality origination.",

    "abstract": "Accurate prediction of price behavior in the foreign exchange market is\ncrucial. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages technical\nindicators and deep neural networks. The proposed architecture consists of a\nLong Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and\nattention mechanism. Initially, trend and oscillation technical indicators are\nemployed to extract statistical features from Forex currency pair data,\nproviding insights into price trends, market volatility, relative price\nstrength, and overbought and oversold conditions. Subsequently, the LSTM and\nCNN networks are utilized in parallel to predict future price movements,\nleveraging the strengths of both recurrent and convolutional architectures. The\nLSTM network captures long-term dependencies and temporal patterns in the data,\nwhile the CNN network extracts local patterns. The outputs of the parallel LSTM\nand CNN networks are then fed into an attention mechanism, which learns to\nweigh the importance of each feature and temporal dependency, generating a\ncontext-aware representation of the input data. The attention-weighted output\nis then used to predict future price movements, enabling the model to focus on\nthe most relevant features and temporal dependencies. Through a comprehensive\nevaluation of the proposed approach on multiple Forex currency pairs, we\ndemonstrate its effectiveness in predicting price behavior and outperforming\nbenchmark models.",

In this\ncontext, threat modeling plays an essential role. Despite the advances in\nthreat modeling, the fundamental gap in the state-of-the art is the lack of a\nsystematic methodology for identifying threats in ICS comprehensively. Most\nthreat models in the literature (i) rely on expert knowledge, (ii) only include\ngeneric threats such as spoofing, tampering, etc., and (iii) these threats are\nnot comprehensive enough for the systems in question. To overcome these\nlimitations, we propose a novel evidence-based methodology to systematically\nidentify threats based on existing CVE entries of components and their\nassociated fundamental weaknesses in the form of CWE entries - namely, CVE-CWE\npairs - and thereby generate a comprehensive threat list.

    "abstract": "Trajectory prediction is essential for the safety and efficiency of planning\nin autonomous vehicles. However, current models often fail to fully capture\ncomplex traffic rules and the complete range of potential vehicle movements.\nAddressing these limitations, this study introduces three novel loss functions:\nOffroad Loss, Direction Consistency Error, and Diversity Loss. These functions\nare designed to keep predicted paths within driving area boundaries, aligned\nwith traffic directions, and cover a wider variety of plausible driving\nscenarios. As all prediction modes should adhere to road rules and conditions,\nthis work overcomes the shortcomings of traditional \"winner takes all\" training\nmethods by applying the loss functions to all prediction modes. These loss\nfunctions not only improve model training but can also serve as metrics for\nevaluating the realism and diversity of trajectory predictions. Extensive\nvalidation on the nuScenes and Argoverse 2 datasets with leading baseline\nmodels demonstrates that our approach not only maintains accuracy but\nsignificantly improves safety and robustness, reducing offroad errors on\naverage by 47% on original and by 37% on attacked scenes. This work sets a new\nbenchmark for trajectory prediction in autonomous driving, offering substantial\nimprovements in navigating complex environments.

    "abstract": "Building operations consume approximately 40% of global energy, with Heating,\nVentilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems responsible for up to 50% of\nthis consumption. As HVAC energy demands are expected to rise, optimising\nsystem efficiency is crucial for reducing future energy use and mitigating\nclimate change. Existing control strategies lack generalisation and require\nextensive training and data, limiting their rapid deployment across diverse\nbuildings. This paper introduces HVAC-DPT, a Decision-Pretrained Transformer\nusing in-context Reinforcement Learning (RL) for multi-zone HVAC control.\nHVAC-DPT frames HVAC control as a sequential prediction task, training a causal\ntransformer on interaction histories generated by diverse RL agents. This\napproach enables HVAC-DPT to refine its policy in-context, without modifying\nnetwork parameters, allowing for deployment across different buildings without\nthe need for additional training or data collection. HVAC-DPT reduces energy\nconsumption in unseen buildings by 45% compared to the baseline controller,\noffering a scalable and effective approach to mitigating the increasing\nenvironmental impact of HVAC systems.",

Different scenarios suggest that Europa's volatiles\ncould be derived from cometary ices or devolatilized building blocks. The study\nof post-accretion processes, in particular the \"open ocean\" phase that likely\noccurred before the formation of the icy crust, is crucial to distinguish these\norigins, as this phase is likely to have influenced the volatile inventory. The\nabundance of ammonia in Europa's building blocks is also crucial for\nunderstanding the composition of its ocean and primordial atmosphere. We aim to\ninvestigate ocean-atmosphere equilibrium during the post-accretion period by\nvarying the ammonia fraction in the atmosphere. Our model evaluates the\nvapor-liquid equilibrium of water and volatiles, as well as the chemical\nequilibrium within the ocean, to study Europa's early hydrosphere. We explore\ntwo initial conditions: one in which Europa's hydrosphere originates from\ncomet-like building blocks, and another in which it forms in equilibrium with a\nthick, CO$_2$-rich atmosphere. In both scenarios, the initial ratio of accreted\nCO$_2$ to NH$_3$ determines the magnitude of their partial pressures in\nEuropa's early atmosphere. If this ratio exceeds a certain threshold (set to\n$10^{-4}$ in this study), the atmosphere will be CO$_2$-rich; otherwise, it\nwill be CO$_2$-depleted by multiple orders of magnitude. Overall, our work\nprovides a initial assessment of the distribution of primordial volatiles in\nEuropa's primitive hydrosphere, and provides a baseline for interpreting data\nfrom the upcoming Europa Clipper mission.",

This study introduces a novel approach using graph neural networks\n(GNNs) and a Graph Transformer (GT) to predict the incidence of heart failure\n(HF) on a patient similarity graph at the next hospital visit. Materials and\nMethods: We used electronic health records (EHR) from the MIMIC-III dataset and\napplied the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to create a patient similarity\ngraph using embeddings from diagnoses, procedures, and medications. Three\nmodels - GraphSAGE, Graph Attention Network (GAT), and Graph Transformer (GT) -\nwere implemented to predict HF incidence. Model performance was evaluated using\nF1 score, AUROC, and AUPRC metrics, and results were compared against baseline\nalgorithms. An interpretability analysis was performed to understand the\nmodel's decision-making process. Results: The GT model demonstrated the best\nperformance (F1 score: 0.5361, AUROC: 0.7925, AUPRC: 0.5168). Although the\nRandom Forest (RF) baseline achieved a similar AUPRC value, the GT model\noffered enhanced interpretability due to the use of patient relationships in\nthe graph structure. A joint analysis of attention weights, graph connectivity,\nand clinical features provided insight into model predictions across different\nclassification groups.

The\n$\\sigma$-Orionis cluster is the ideal site to study disk winds under these\nconditions; its outer parts can be used to study disk evolution, while its\ninnermost regions to study the effect of external irradiation. For this, we\nanalyze the $\\rm [OI]\\,\\lambda$6300, $\\rm [NII]\\,\\lambda$6583, and $\\rm\n[SII]\\,\\lambda$6731,$\\lambda$6716 lines using high-resolution MIKE spectra of\n27 classical T Tauri stars and complemented by intermediate-resolution\nX-shooter data. We decompose the line profiles into multiple Gaussian\ncomponents. We calculated luminosities, line ratios, and kinematic properties\nof these components. We found that the $\\rm [OI]\\,\\lambda$6300 line luminosity\nand kinematic properties are similar to those found in low-mass star-forming\nregions (SFRs). The frequency of single-component $\\rm [OI]\\,\\lambda$6300 line\nprofiles reflects the expected evolutionary stage given the intermediate age of\n$\\sigma$-Orionis. This points to internal processes contributing to the line\nemission. However, the highly irradiated disks do not follow the accretion -\n[OI] luminosity relation found in low-mass SFRs, and all exhibit\nsingle-component line profiles. Line ratios of highly ionized species of [NII]\nand [SII] show higher ratios than typical values found in low-mass SFRs. The\ninnermost regions of $\\sigma$-Orionis are clearly affected by external\nirradiation, evidenced by the lack of correlation in the accretion - [OI]\nluminosity relation. The broad line widths of close-in sources, however,\nindicate a contribution from internal processes, such as magnetohydrodynamical\nwinds and/or internal photoevaporation.

The Dark\nEnergy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) BAO analysis for the first year (DR1)\ndata uses the ``standard'' reconstruction framework, in which the displacement\nfield is estimated from the observed density field by solving the linearized\ncontinuity equation in redshift space, and galaxy and random positions are\nshifted in order to partially remove nonlinearities. There are several\napproaches to solving for the displacement field in real survey data, including\nthe multigrid (MG), iterative Fast Fourier Transform (iFFT), and iterative Fast\nFourier Transform particle (iFFTP) algorithms. In this work, we analyze these\nalgorithms and compare them with various metrics including two-point statistics\nand the displacement itself using realistic DESI mocks. We focus on three\nrepresentative DESI samples, the emission line galaxies (ELG), quasars (QSO),\nand the bright galaxy sample (BGS), which cover the extreme redshifts and\nnumber densities, and potential wide-angle effects. We conclude that the MG and\niFFT algorithms agree within 0.4% in post-reconstruction power spectrum on BAO\nscales with the RecSym convention, which does not remove large-scale redshift\nspace distortions (RSDs), in all three tracers. The RecSym convention appears\nto be less sensitive to displacement errors than the RecIso convention, which\nattempts to remove large-scale RSDs. However, iFFTP deviates from the first\ntwo; thus, we recommend against using iFFTP without further development. In\naddition, we provide the optimal settings for reconstruction for five years of\nDESI observation. The analyses presented in this work pave the way for DESI DR1\nanalysis as well as future BAO analyses.",

    "abstract": "This thesis is part of a CIFRE agreement between the company Othello and the\nLIASD laboratory. The objective is to develop an artificial intelligence system\nthat can detect real-time dangers in a video stream. To achieve this, a novel\napproach combining temporal and spatial analysis has been proposed. Several\navenues have been explored to improve anomaly detection by integrating object\ndetection, human pose detection, and motion analysis. For result\ninterpretability, techniques commonly used for image analysis, such as\nactivation and saliency maps, have been extended to videos, and an original\nmethod has been proposed. The proposed architecture performs binary or\nmulticlass classification depending on whether an alert or the cause needs to\nbe identified. Numerous neural networkmodels have been tested, and three of\nthem have been selected. You Only Looks Once (YOLO) has been used for spatial\nanalysis, a Convolutional Recurrent Neuronal Network (CRNN) composed of VGG19\nand a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) for temporal analysis, and a multi-layer\nperceptron for classification. These models handle different types of data and\ncan be combined in parallel or in series. Although the parallel mode is faster,\nthe serial mode is generally more reliable. For training these models,\nsupervised learning was chosen, and two proprietary datasets were created. The\nfirst dataset focuses on objects that may play a potential role in anomalies,\nwhile the second consists of videos containing anomalies or non-anomalies. This\napproach allows for the processing of both continuous video streams and finite\nvideos, providing greater flexibility in detection.",

The advent of several large multi-band photometric surveys will allow\nus to statistically analyze this perturbation, with information that was not\npreviously available.

We test different algorithms to deal with the imbalance of\nour data and select the most suitable approach based on the considered metrics.\nWe show that our trained algorithm can provide a very accurate and rapid\nclassification of lopsided galaxies.

A common\napproach is to apply uniform scaling, treating unequipped links as equivalent\nto equipped ones. This study introduces a novel framework to improve traffic\nvariable estimation by integrating statistical scaling methods with geospatial\nimputation techniques. Two main approaches are proposed: (1) Statistical\nScaling, which includes hierarchical and non-hierarchical network approaches,\nand (2) Geospatial Imputation, based on variogram modeling. The hierarchical\nscaling method categorizes the network into several levels according to spatial\nand functional characteristics, applying tailored scaling factors to each\ncategory.

The variogram-based\ngeospatial imputation leverages spatial correlations to estimate traffic\nvariables for unequipped links, capturing spatial dependencies in urban road\nnetworks. Validation results indicate that the hierarchical scaling approach\nprovides the most accurate estimates, achieving reliable performance even with\nas low as 5% uniform detector coverage.

    "abstract": "Modeling the evolution of system with time-series data is a challenging and\ncritical task in a wide range of fields, especially when the time-series data\nis regularly sampled and partially observable. Some methods have been proposed\nto estimate the hidden dynamics between intervals like Neural ODE or\nExponential decay dynamic function and combine with RNN to estimate the\nevolution. However, it is difficult for these methods to capture the spatial\nand temporal dependencies existing within graph-structured time-series data and\ntake full advantage of the available relational information to impute missing\ndata and predict the future states. Besides, traditional RNN-based methods\nleverage shared RNN cell to update the hidden state which does not capture the\nimpact of various intervals and missing state information on the reliability of\nestimating the hidden state. To solve this problem, in this paper, we propose a\nmethod embedding Graph Neural ODE with reliability and time-aware mechanism\nwhich can capture the spatial and temporal dependencies in irregularly sampled\nand partially observable time-series data to reconstruct the dynamics. Also, a\nloss function is designed considering the reliability of the augment data from\nthe above proposed method to make further prediction. The proposed method has\nbeen validated in experiments of different networked dynamical systems.",

    "abstract": "Estimating the Doppler frequency shift caused by moving targets is one of the\nkey objectives of Integrated Sensing And Communication (ISAC) systems, as it\nenables applications such as target classification, human activity recognition,\nand gait analysis. In practical scenarios, Doppler estimation is hindered by\nthe movement of transmitter and receiver devices, and by the phase offsets\ncaused by their clock asynchrony. Existing approaches have separately addressed\nthese two aspects, either assuming clock-synchronous moving devices or\nasynchronous static ones. In fact, jointly tackling device motion and clock\nasynchrony is extremely challenging, as the Doppler shift from device movement\ndiffers for each propagation path and the phase offsets are time-varying. In\nthis work, we present AsyMov, a method to estimate the bistatic Doppler\nfrequency of a target and its velocity in ISAC setups featuring mobile and\nasynchronous devices. It leverages the channel impulse response at the\nreceiver, by originally exploiting the invariance of phase offsets across\npropagation paths and the bistatic geometry, where the target Doppler and the\ndevice velocity are jointly estimated by a newly proposed alternating\nminimization algorithm. Moreover, it can be seamlessly integrated with device\nvelocity measurements obtained from onboard sensors (if available), for\nenhanced reliability. Here, AsyMov is thoroughly characterized by way of theory\n(Cram\\'er-Rao bound), simulation and experiments, implementing it on an IEEE\n802.11ay testbed and testing it on multiple setups, also including a moving\nhuman target.

Although CLIP is\nhighly versatile, adapting it for face forgery detection is non-trivial as\nforgery-related knowledge is entangled with a wide range of unrelated\nknowledge. Existing methods treat CLIP merely as a feature extractor, lacking\ntask-specific adaptation, which limits their effectiveness. To address this, we\nintroduce an adapter to learn face forgery traces -- the blending boundaries\nunique to forged faces, guided by task-specific objectives. Then we enhance the\nCLIP visual tokens with a dedicated interaction strategy that communicates\nknowledge across CLIP and the adapter. Since the adapter is alongside CLIP, its\nversatility is highly retained, naturally ensuring strong generalizability in\nface forgery detection. With only 5.7M trainable parameters, our method\nachieves a significant performance boost, improving by approximately 7% on\naverage across five standard datasets. Additionally, we describe Forensics\nAdapter++, an extended method that incorporates textual modality via a newly\nproposed forgery-aware prompt learning strategy. This extension leads to a\nfurther 1.3% performance boost over the original Forensics Adapter.

Streetscape applications-focusing on challenges like\npedestrian safety and adaptive traffic management-depend on managing\ndistributed, heterogeneous sensor data, aligning information across time and\nspace, and enabling real-time processing.

By\nstructuring these capabilities as clear, composable abstractions with clear\nsemantics, SASS allows developers to scale streetscape applications efficiently\nwhile minimizing the complexity of multimodal integration.\n  We evaluated SASS in two real-world testbed environments: a controlled\nparking lot and an urban intersection in a major U.S. city.

The Multimodal Data Synchronization service reduced temporal\nmisalignment errors by 88%, achieving synchronization accuracy within 50\nmilliseconds.

In this study, the\nrole of shape attributes were characterized by sequential appearance of one or\ntwo of the aforementioned rotational phases across the phase diagram in a\npressure dependent manner which could be regarded as an important stepping\nstone towards fully predictive self-assembly behavior of hard particle systems.",

With conquering these\nnon-common mode noises, we demonstrate an exceptional fractional frequency\ninstability of 2.7E-17 at 1 second when normalized to the optical frequency.\nCharacterizing coherence across large frequency spacings poses a significant\nchallenge. To tackle this, we employ electro-optical frequency division to\ntransfer the relative stability of a 0.5 THz spacing two-color laser to a 25\nGHz microwave signal. As its performance surpasses the sensitivity of the\ncurrent apparatus, we establish two independent systems for comparative\nanalyses. The resulting 25 GHz signals exhibit exceptional phase noise of -74\ndBc/Hz at 1 Hz and -120 dBc/Hz at 100 Hz, demonstrating the two-color laser's\nperformance approaching the quantum noise limit of its synchronization system.\nIt also sets a new record for the two-point frequency division method in\nphotonic microwave generation.

    "abstract": "Given that distributed systems face adversarial behaviors such as\neavesdropping and cyberattacks, how to ensure the evidence fusion result is\ncredible becomes a must-be-addressed topic. Different from traditional research\nthat assumes nodes are cooperative, we focus on three requirements for evidence\nfusion, i.e., preserving evidence's privacy, identifying attackers and\nexcluding their evidence, and dissipating high-conflicting among evidence\ncaused by random noise and interference. To this end, this paper proposes an\nalgorithm for credible evidence fusion against cyberattacks. Firstly, the\nfusion strategy is constructed based on conditionalized credibility to avoid\ncounterintuitive fusion results caused by high-conflicting. Under this\nstrategy, distributed evidence fusion is transformed into the average consensus\nproblem for the weighted average value by conditional credibility of\nmulti-source evidence (WAVCCME), which implies a more concise consensus process\nand lower computational complexity than existing algorithms. Secondly, a state\ndecomposition and reconstruction strategy with weight encryption is designed,\nand its effectiveness for privacy-preserving under directed graphs is\nguaranteed: decomposing states into different random sub-states for different\nneighbors to defend against internal eavesdroppers, and encrypting the\nsub-states' weight in the reconstruction to guard against out-of-system\neavesdroppers. Finally, the identities and types of attackers are identified by\ninter-neighbor broadcasting and comparison of nodes' states, and the proposed\nupdate rule with state corrections is used to achieve the consensus of the\nWAVCCME. The states of normal nodes are shown to converge to their WAVCCME,\nwhile the attacker's evidence is excluded from the fusion, as verified by the\nsimulation on a distributed unmanned reconnaissance swarm.",

Multiple implementations exist for\nboth the DFT and the subsequent G0W0 calculation, leading to possible\ndifferences in quasiparticle energies. In the present work, the G0W0\nquasiparticle energies for states close to the band gap are calculated for six\ncrystalline solids, using four different codes: Abinit, exciting, FHI-aims, and\nGPAW. This comparison helps to assess the impact of basis-set types (planewaves\nversus localized orbitals) and the treatment of core and valence electrons\n(all-electron full potentials versus pseudopotentials). The impact of\nunoccupied states as well as the algorithms for solving the quasiparticle\nequation are also briefly discussed. For the KS-DFT band gaps, we observe good\nagreement between all codes, with differences not exceeding 0.1 eV, while the\nG0W0 results deviate on the order of 0.1-0.3 eV.

In\nparticular, three-dimensional (3D) topological spin textures are promising due\nto the expected complex non-linear dynamics as well as high static and dynamic\nthermal stability. In multilayer heterostructures, a hybrid chiral skyrmion\ntube is a well-known example of a 3D topological spin texture, exhibiting an\nintriguing chirality transition along the thickness direction. This transition\nprogresses from left-handed to right-handed N\\'eel-type chirality, passing\nthrough a Bloch-type intermediate state. Such an exotic spin configuration\npotentially exhibits distinctly different dynamics from that of the common\nskyrmion tube that exhibits a homogeneous chirality; yet these dynamics have\nnot been ascertained so far. Here we reveal the distinct features of\ncurrent-induced dynamics that result from the hybrid chiral skyrmion tube\nstructure in synthetic antiferromagnetic (SyAFM) multilayers. Strikingly, the\nSyAFM hybrid chiral skyrmion tubes exhibit a non-reciprocal skyrmion Hall\neffect in the flow regime. The non-reciprocity can even be tuned by the degree\nof magnetic compensation in the SyAFM systems. Our theoretical modeling\nqualitatively corroborates that the non-reciprocity stems from the dynamic\noscillation of skyrmion helicity during its current-induced motion. The\nfindings highlight the critical role of the internal degrees of freedom of\nthese complex skyrmion tubes for their current-induced dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have great potential in medical tasks, like\nVisual Question Answering (VQA), where they could act as interactive assistants\nfor both patients and clinicians. Yet their robustness to distribution shifts\non unseen data remains a key concern for safe deployment. Evaluating such\nrobustness requires a controlled experimental setup that allows for systematic\ninsights into the model's behavior. However, we demonstrate that current setups\nfail to offer sufficiently thorough evaluations. To address this gap, we\nintroduce a novel framework, called SURE-VQA, centered around three key\nrequirements to overcome current pitfalls and systematically analyze VLM\nrobustness: 1) Since robustness on synthetic shifts does not necessarily\ntranslate to real-world shifts, it should be measured on real-world shifts that\nare inherent to the VQA data; 2) Traditional token-matching metrics often fail\nto capture underlying semantics, necessitating the use of large language models\n(LLMs) for more accurate semantic evaluation; 3) Model performance often lacks\ninterpretability due to missing sanity baselines, thus meaningful baselines\nshould be reported that allow assessing the multimodal impact on the VLM. To\ndemonstrate the relevance of this framework, we conduct a study on the\nrobustness of various Fine-Tuning (FT) methods across three medical datasets\nwith four types of distribution shifts. Our study highlights key insights into\nrobustness: 1) No FT method consistently outperforms others in robustness, and\n2) robustness trends are more stable across FT methods than across distribution\nshifts. Additionally, we find that simple sanity baselines that do not use the\nimage data can perform surprisingly well and confirm LoRA as the\nbest-performing FT method on in-distribution data.

However, high dynamics, unstable topology\nchanges, and frequent route updates bring significant challenge to fast and\nadaptive routing policies. In addition, since computing, bandwidth, and storage\nresources in each LEO satellite is strictly limited, traffic demands are\ntypically unbalanced, further enlarging the challenge to scalable routing\npolicies with load balancing. Nevertheless, most existing research failed to\naddress the above difficulties. Therefore, this paper proposes a lightweight\nand scalable protocol of segment routing through landmark-based skeleton\ngraphs. To improve the overall performance, we design an efficient multipath\nsegment routing algorithm. First, the algorithm partitions the network into\nmultiple regions to construct skeleton paths, which can effectively guide\npacket forwarding and reduce the operating costs. In each region, multipath\nprobabilistic routing is used to achieve uniform traffic distribution, avoiding\nhotspot congestion. Furthermore, the flexible hierarchical partitioning and\nlocalized segmented routing is employed for fine-grained traffic control and\nQoS guarantee combined with adaptive local single-path routing.

Taking\ngender fairness as a representative issue, we identify three phenomena in\nfederated recommendation systems: performance difference, data imbalance, and\npreference disparity. We discover that the state-of-the-art methods only focus\non the first phenomenon. Consequently, their imposition of inappropriate\nfairness constraints detrimentally affects the model training. Moreover, due to\ninsufficient sensitive attribute protection of existing works, we can infer the\ngender of all users with 99.90% accuracy even with the addition of maximal\nnoise. In this work, we propose Privacy-Preserving Orthogonal Aggregation\n(PPOA), which employs the secure aggregation scheme and quantization technique,\nto prevent the suppression of minority groups by the majority and preserve the\ndistinct preferences for better group fairness. PPOA can assist different\ngroups in obtaining their respective model aggregation results through a\ndesigned orthogonal mapping while keeping their attributes private.\nExperimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate that PPOA\nenhances recommendation effectiveness for both females and males by up to 8.25%\nand 6.36%, respectively, with a maximum overall improvement of 7.30%, and\nachieves optimal fairness in most cases.

It is\nsuggested that these HVCs might contain a non-negligible fraction of the\nmissing baryons. The main aim of the current paper is to estimate the baryonic\nmass of the Milky Way halo in the form of HVCs in order to constrain a fraction\nof missing baryons in the form of these clouds. Such findings would give\nsubstantial help in the studying halo dynamics of our Galaxy.\n  We first estimate the HVCs distance. We consider the most recent and updated\nHVC catalog, namely the Galactic All Sky Survey (GASS), which, however, covers\nthe southern sky declinations, south of $b \\leq 60^\\circ$. Following a model\npresented in the literature, we assume that most of the HVCs (not all of the\nHVCs in the Milky Way) were ejected from the Magellanic Clouds (MCls) which is\nat a distance of about 50 kpc. We assume that the HVCs have a temperature in\nthe range of about $10^2 - 10^4$ K, and are distributed in the Galactic halo as\nthe Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile. Since the GASS survey covers a small\nportion of the sky, we estimate the number of missing clouds by using Monte\nCarlo (MC) simulations. The next step will be to estimate the total mass of the\nMilky Way contained in the form of these HVCs. The total mass resulted to be\n$\\sim (7 \\pm 2) \\times 10^{9} M_{\\odot}$ in the form of HVCs and compact\nhigh-velocity clouds (CHVCs).",

However, as LLMs continue to evolve, focus has\nincreasingly shifted to domain-specific capabilities and safety concerns,\nmaking those previous coarse-grained texts insufficient for meeting training\nrequirements. Furthermore, fine-grained information, such as quality, domain\nand toxicity, is becoming increasingly important in building powerful and\nreliable LLMs for various scenarios. To address these challenges, in this paper\nwe propose a new tool-chain called MDFG-tool for constructing large-scale and\nhigh-quality Chinese datasets with multi-dimensional and fine-grained\ninformation. First, we employ manually crafted rules to discard explicit noisy\ntexts from raw contents. Second, the quality evaluation model, domain\nclassifier, and toxicity evaluation model are well-designed to assess the\nremaining cleaned data respectively. Finally, we integrate these three types of\nfine-grained information for each text. With this approach, we release the\nlargest, high-quality and fine-grained Chinese text ChineseWebText2.0, which\nconsists of 3.8TB and each text is associated with a quality score, domain\nlabels, a toxicity label and a toxicity score, facilitating the LLM researchers\nto select data based on various types of fine-grained information.

Here, we explore how different types of inhibitory\nneurons can contribute to the diversity of the phase relations between two\ncortical areas. This research sheds light on the potential impact of local\nproperties, such as neuronal variability, on communication between distant\nbrain regions. We show that both homogeneous and heterogeneous inhibitory\nnetworks can exhibit phase diversity and nonintuitive regimes such as\nanticipated synchronization (AS) and phase bistability. It has been proposed\nthat the bi-stable phase could be related to bi-stable perception, such as in\nthe Necker cube. Moreover, we show that heterogeneity enlarges the region of\nzero-lag synchronization and bistability. We also show that the parameter\ncontrolling inhibitory heterogeneity modulates the transition from the usual\ndelayed synchronization regime (DS) to AS. Finally, we show that the inhibitory\nheterogeneity drives the internal dynamics of the free-running population.\nTherefore, we suggest a possible mechanism to explain when the DS-AS transition\noccurs via zero-lag synchronization or bi-stability.",

Observations of blue-shifted and red-shifted signals in the\ntransmission and dayside spectra of WASP-189b have sparked discussions about\nthe nature of winds on this planet. To investigate the structure of winds in\nthe atmosphere of the ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-189b, we studied its dayside\nemission spectrum with CRIRES$^+$ in the spectral K band. We used the\ncross-correlation method to detect emission signals of CO and Fe, and employed\na Bayesian framework to retrieve the atmospheric parameters relating to the\ntemperature-pressure structure and chemistry. The retrieval incorporated a\nnumerical model of the line profile influenced by various dynamic effects to\ndetermine the wind structure. The cross-correlation signals of CO and Fe showed\na velocity offset of ~6km/s, which could be caused by a fast day-to-night wind\nin the atmosphere of WASP-189b. The atmospheric retrieval showed that the line\nprofile of the observed spectra is best fitted by the presence of a\nday-to-night wind of 4.4km/s, while the retrieved equatorial jet velocity of\n1.0km/s is consistent with the absence of such a jet. Such a wind pattern is\nconsistent with the observed line broadening and can explain the majority of\nthe velocity offset, while uncertainties in the ephemerides and the effects of\na hot spot could also contribute to this offset. We further retrieved an\ninverted temperature-pressure profile and determined the C/O ratio and\nmetallicity. We showed that red-shifts of a few km/s in the dayside spectra\ncould be explained by day-to-night winds. Further studies combining\ntransmission and dayside observations could advance our understanding of\nWASP-189b's atmospheric circulation by improving the uncertainties in the\nvelocity offset and wind parameters.",

Remarkable studies on the very large\nand unconventional Nernst effect in WTe$_2$ have been reported, raising\nquestions about whether this property is shared across the entire family of van\nder Waals tellurides.\n  In this study, systematic measurements of the Nernst effect in telluride van\nder Waals Weyl semimetals are presented. Large linear Nernst coefficients in\nWTe$_2$ and MoTe$_2$ are identified, and moderate Nernst coefficients with\nnon-linear behavior in magnetic fields are observed in\nW$_{0.65}$Mo$_{0.35}$Te$_2$, TaIrTe$_4$, and TaRhTe$_4$. Within this sample\nset, a correlation between the dominant linear-in-magnetic-field component of\nthe Nernst coefficient and mobility is established, aligning with the\nestablished Nernst scaling framework, though with a different scaling factor\ncompared to existing literature. This enhancement might be caused by the shared\nfavorable electronic band structure of this family of materials. Conversely,\nthe non-linear component of the Nernst effect in a magnetic field could not be\ncorrelated with mobility.

We aim to explore the JWST observations of the\nbinary protostellar system Ced~110~IRS4A and IRS4B to unveil and quantify the\nice inventories toward these sources. We compare the ice abundances with those\nfound for the same molecular cloud. The analysis is performed by fitting or\ncomparing laboratory infrared spectra of ices to the observations. Spectral\nfits are carried out with the ENIIGMA fitting tool that searches for the best\nfit. For Ced~110~IRS4B, we detected the major ice species H$_2$O, CO, CO$_2$\nand NH$_3$. All species are found in a mixture except for CO and CO$_2$, which\nhave both mixed and pure ice components. In the case of Ced~110~IRS4A, we\ndetected the same major species as in Ced~110~IRS4B, as well as the following\nminor species CH$_4$, SO$_2$, CH$_3$OH, OCN$^-$, NH$_4^+$ and HCOOH. Tentative\ndetection of N$_2$O ice (7.75~$\\mu$m), forsterite dust (11.2~$\\mu$m) and\nCH$_3^+$ gas emission (7.18~$\\mu$m) in the primary source are also presented.\nCompared with the two lines of sight toward background stars in the Chameleon I\nmolecular cloud, the protostar has similar ice abundances, except in the case\nof the ions that are higher in IRS4A. The clearest differences are the absence\nof the 7.2 and 7.4~$\\mu$m absorption features due to HCOO$^-$ and icy complex\norganic molecules in IRS4A and evidence of thermal processing in both IRS4A and\nIRS4B as probed by the CO$_2$ ice features. We conclude that the binary\nprotostellar system Ced~110~IRS4A and IRS4B has a large inventory of icy\nspecies. The similar ice abundances in comparison to the starless regions in\nthe same molecular cloud suggest that the chemical conditions of the protostar\nwere set at earlier stages in the molecular cloud.",

Our approach leverages\nthe power of Transformer models to generate adaptive, real-time predictions of\nasset covariances, with a focus on the semi-covariance matrix to account for\ndownside risk. The semi-covariance matrix emphasizes negative correlations\nbetween assets, offering a more nuanced approach to risk management compared to\ntraditional methods that treat all volatility equally.\n  Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate that Transformer-based\npredictions of both covariance and semi-covariance significantly enhance\nportfolio performance. Our results show that portfolios optimized using the\nsemi-covariance matrix outperform those optimized with the standard covariance\nmatrix, particularly in volatile market conditions. Moreover, the use of the\nSortino ratio, a risk-adjusted performance metric that focuses on downside\nrisk, further validates the effectiveness of our approach in managing risk\nwhile maximizing returns.\n  These findings have important implications for asset managers and investors,\noffering a dynamic, data-driven framework for portfolio construction that\nadapts more effectively to shifting market conditions.

    "abstract": "Nowadays, software development progresses rapidly to incorporate new\nfeatures. To facilitate such growth and provide convenience for developers when\ncreating and updating software, reusing open-source software (i.e., thirdparty\nlibrary reuses) has become one of the most effective and efficient methods.\nUnfortunately, the practice of reusing third-party libraries (TPLs) can also\nintroduce vulnerabilities (known as 1-day vulnerabilities) because of the low\nmaintenance of TPLs, resulting in many vulnerable versions remaining in use. If\nthe software incorporating these TPLs fails to detect the introduced\nvulnerabilities and leads to delayed updates, it will exacerbate the security\nrisks. However, the complicated code dependencies and flexibility of TPL reuses\nmake the detection of 1-day vulnerability a challenging task. To support\ndevelopers in securely reusing TPLs during software development, we design and\nimplement VULTURE, an effective and efficient detection tool, aiming at\nidentifying 1-day vulnerabilities that arise from the reuse of vulnerable TPLs.\nIt first executes a database creation method, TPLFILTER, which leverages the\nLarge Language Model (LLM) to automatically build a unique database for the\ntargeted platform. Instead of relying on code-level similarity comparison,\nVULTURE employs hashing-based comparison to explore the dependencies among the\ncollected TPLs and identify the similarities between the TPLs and the target\nprojects. Recognizing that developers have the flexibility to reuse TPLs\nexactly or in a custom manner, VULTURE separately conducts version-based\ncomparison and chunk-based analysis to capture fine-grained semantic features\nat the function levels. We applied VULTURE to 10 real-world projects to assess\nits effectiveness and efficiency in detecting 1-day vulnerabilities. VULTURE\nsuccessfully identified 175 vulnerabilities from 178 reused TPLs.",

    "abstract": "Modern recommendation systems frequently employ online learning to\ndynamically update their models with freshly collected data. The most commonly\nused optimizer for updating neural networks in these contexts is the Adam\noptimizer, which integrates momentum ($m_t$) and adaptive learning rate\n($v_t$). However, the volatile nature of online learning data, characterized by\nits frequent distribution shifts and presence of noise, poses significant\nchallenges to Adam's standard optimization process: (1) Adam may use outdated\nmomentum and the average of squared gradients, resulting in slower adaptation\nto distribution changes, and (2) Adam's performance is adversely affected by\ndata noise. To mitigate these issues, we introduce CAdam, a confidence-based\noptimization strategy that assesses the consistency between the momentum and\nthe gradient for each parameter dimension before deciding on updates. If\nmomentum and gradient are in sync, CAdam proceeds with parameter updates\naccording to Adam's original formulation; if not, it temporarily withholds\nupdates and monitors potential shifts in data distribution in subsequent\niterations. This method allows CAdam to distinguish between the true\ndistributional shifts and mere noise, and to adapt more quickly to new data\ndistributions. In various settings with distribution shift or noise, our\nexperiments demonstrate that CAdam surpasses other well-known optimizers,\nincluding the original Adam. Furthermore, in large-scale A/B testing within a\nlive recommendation system, CAdam significantly enhances model performance\ncompared to Adam, leading to substantial increases in the system's gross\nmerchandise volume (GMV).",

The magneto-acoustic resonator (MAR) is based on a YIG\n(yttrium iron garnet) layer epitaxially grown on a GGG (gadolinium gallium\ngarnet) substrate. By optimizing the YIG thickness, we obtain a high\nmagneto-elastic coupling of around 1 MHz between the ferromagnetic resonance\n(FMR) in YIG and high overtone acoustic resonances (HBARs) in the YIG-GGG\nstructure in the 1-2 GHz frequency range. It allows to eliminate the need for\npre-selectors and bulky circulators, thus simplifying the MAO design while\nmaintaining the possibility to lock to HBAR YIG-GGG modes. With an adjustment\nin the loop over-amplification parameter, the MAO can be locked either only to\nhigh-Q magneto-acoustic HBARs or to both types of resonance including HBARs and\nthe FMR mode of the YIG film. In a low-phase-noise regime, MAO generates only\nat certain values of the applied field and exhibits discrete frequency\ntunability with a 3.281 MHz step corresponding to the frequency separation\nbetween the adjacent HBAR modes in a YIG-GGG structure. In a complex regime\nwhere oscillation conditions expand to include both HBAR and FMR modes, MAO\ndemonstrates continuous generation as the function of the applied field with\nvariable phase noise parameters. Moreover, in low-phase-noise regime, MAO phase\nnoise plot improves by 30 dB compared to the operational regime locked to the\npure FMR in YIG which is in agreement with the measured FMR and HBAR Q-factors.",

    "abstract": "Planning safe and efficient trajectories through signal-free intersections\npresents significant challenges for autonomous vehicles (AVs), particularly in\ndynamic, multi-task environments with unpredictable interactions and an\nincreased possibility of conflicts. This study aims to address these challenges\nby developing a unified, robust, adaptive framework to ensure safety and\nefficiency across three distinct intersection movements: left-turn, right-turn,\nand straight-ahead. Existing methods often struggle to reliably ensure safety\nand effectively learn multi-task behaviors from demonstrations in such\nenvironments. This study proposes a safety-critical planning method that\nintegrates Dynamic High-Order Control Barrier Functions (DHOCBF) with a\ndiffusion-based model, called Dynamic Safety-Critical Diffuser (DSC-Diffuser).\nThe DSC-Diffuser leverages task-guided planning to enhance efficiency, allowing\nthe simultaneous learning of multiple driving tasks from real-world expert\ndemonstrations. Moreover, the incorporation of goal-oriented constraints\nsignificantly reduces displacement errors, ensuring precise trajectory\nexecution. To further ensure driving safety in dynamic environments, the\nproposed DHOCBF framework dynamically adjusts to account for the movements of\nsurrounding vehicles, offering enhanced adaptability and reduce the\nconservatism compared to traditional control barrier functions. Validity\nevaluations of DHOCBF, conducted through numerical simulations, demonstrate its\nrobustness in adapting to variations in obstacle velocities, sizes,\nuncertainties, and locations, effectively maintaining driving safety across a\nwide range of complex and uncertain scenarios. Comprehensive performance\nevaluations demonstrate that DSC-Diffuser generates realistic, stable, and\ngeneralizable policies, providing flexibility and reliable safety assurance in\ncomplex multi-task driving scenarios.",

    "abstract": "In some models of nonequilibrium phase transitions, fluctuations of the\nanalyzed currents have been observed to diverge with system size. To assess\nwhether this behavior is universal across phase transitions, we examined heat\ncurrent fluctuations in the Curie-Weiss model, a paradigmatic model of the\nparamagnetic-ferromagnetic phase transition, coupled to two thermal baths. This\nmodel exhibits phase transitions driven by both the temperature and the\nmagnetic field. We find that at the temperature-driven phase transition, the\nheat current noise consists of two contributions: the equilibrium part, which\nvanishes with system size, and the nonequilibrium part, which diverges with\nsystem size. For small temperature differences, this leads to nonmonotonic\nscaling of fluctuations with system size. In contrast, at the\nmagnetic-field-driven phase transition, heat current fluctuations do not\ndiverge when observed precisely at the phase transition point. Instead, out of\nequilibrium, the noise is enhanced at the magnetic field values away but close\nto the phase transition point, due to stochastic switching between two current\nvalues. The maximum value of noise increases exponentially with system size,\nwhile the position of this maximum shifts towards the phase transition point.\nFinally, on the methodological side, the paper demonstrates that current\nfluctuations in large systems can be effectively characterized by combining a\npath integral approach for macroscopic fluctuations together with an effective\ntwo-state model describing subextensive transitions between the two macroscopic\nstates involved in the phase transition.",

    "abstract": "Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) have recently shown strong\nperformance in basic video understanding tasks, such as captioning and\ncoarse-grained question answering, but struggle with compositional reasoning\nthat requires multi-step spatio-temporal inference across object relations,\ninteractions, and events. The hurdles to enhancing this capability include\nextensive manual labor, the lack of spatio-temporal compositionality in\nexisting data and the absence of explicit reasoning supervision. In this paper,\nwe propose STEP, a novel graph-guided self-training method that enables\nVideo-LLMs to generate reasoning-rich fine-tuning data from any raw videos to\nimprove itself. Specifically, we first induce Spatio-Temporal Scene Graph\n(STSG) representation of diverse videos to capture fine-grained, multi-granular\nvideo semantics. Then, the STSGs guide the derivation of multi-step reasoning\nQuestion-Answer (QA) data with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) rationales. Both answers\nand rationales are integrated as training objective, aiming to enhance model's\nreasoning abilities by supervision over explicit reasoning steps. Experimental\nresults demonstrate the effectiveness of STEP across models of varying scales,\nwith a significant 21.3\\% improvement in tasks requiring three or more\nreasoning steps. Furthermore, it achieves superior performance with a minimal\namount of self-generated rationale-enriched training samples in both\ncompositional reasoning and comprehensive understanding benchmarks,\nhighlighting the broad applicability and vast potential.",

    "abstract": "We present a theoretical model and simulation for the formation dynamics of\ndiverse texture patterns that emerge spontaneously or self-organize during\nphase inversion processes of fresh cream by mechanical whipping. The results\nsuggest that the model should be applied for theoretically designing the\ntexture and quality of whipped cream and butter products. The modeling\ncomplexity in phase inversion processes from fresh cream via whipped cream to\nbutter was overcome by using a well-established complex systems approach,\ncoupled map lattice (CML). The proposed CML consists of a minimal set of\nprocedures (i.e., parameterized nonlinear maps), whipping, coalescence, and\nflocculation, acting on the appropriately coarse-grained field variables,\nsurface energy, cohesive energy, and velocity (flow) of the emulsion defined on\na two-dimensional square lattice. In the CML simulations, two well-known and\ndifferent phase inversion processes are reproduced at high and low whipping\ntemperatures. The overrun and viscosity changes simulated in these processes\nare at least qualitatively consistent with those observed in experiments. We\ncharacterize these processes exhibiting different texture patterns as the\nviscosity dominance at high whipping temperature and as the overrun dominance\nat low whipping temperature on the viscosity-overrun plane, which is one of the\nstate diagrams.",

A novel model-based MARL approach called RMIO is\nintroduced to address this limitation, specifically designed for scenarios\nwhere observation is lost in some agent. RMIO leverages the world model to\nreconstruct missing observations, and further reduces reconstruction errors\nthrough inter-agent information integration to ensure stable multi-agent\ndecision-making. Secondly, unlike CTCE methods such as MAMBA, RMIO adopts the\nCTDE paradigm in standard environment, and enabling limited communication only\nwhen agents lack observation data, thereby reducing reliance on communication.\nAdditionally, RMIO improves asymptotic performance through strategies such as\nreward smoothing, a dual-layer experience replay buffer, and an RNN-augmented\npolicy model, surpassing previous work. Our experiments conducted in both the\nSMAC and MaMuJoCo environments demonstrate that RMIO outperforms current\nstate-of-the-art approaches in terms of asymptotic convergence performance and\npolicy robustness, both in standard mission settings and in scenarios involving\nobservation loss.",

    "abstract": "With the ever-increasing number of news stories available online, classifying\nthem by topic, regardless of the language they are written in, has become\ncrucial for enhancing readers' access to relevant content. To address this\nchallenge, we propose a teacher-student framework based on large language\nmodels (LLMs) for developing multilingual news classification models of\nreasonable size with no need for manual data annotation. The framework employs\na Generative Pretrained Transformer (GPT) model as the teacher model to develop\nan IPTC Media Topic training dataset through automatic annotation of news\narticles in Slovenian, Croatian, Greek, and Catalan. The teacher model exhibits\na high zero-shot performance on all four languages. Its agreement with human\nannotators is comparable to that between the human annotators themselves. To\nmitigate the computational limitations associated with the requirement of\nprocessing millions of texts daily, smaller BERT-like student models are\nfine-tuned on the GPT-annotated dataset. These student models achieve high\nperformance comparable to the teacher model. Furthermore, we explore the impact\nof the training data size on the performance of the student models and\ninvestigate their monolingual, multilingual and zero-shot cross-lingual\ncapabilities. The findings indicate that student models can achieve high\nperformance with a relatively small number of training instances, and\ndemonstrate strong zero-shot cross-lingual abilities. Finally, we publish the\nbest-performing news topic classifier, enabling multilingual classification\nwith the top-level categories of the IPTC Media Topic schema.",

One challenge faced by researchers is the ethics of\nreal-world experimentation and the lack of social influence data. In this\nstudy, we provide a novel simulated environment that combines agentic\nintelligence with Large Language Models (LLMs) to test topic-specific influence\nmechanisms ethically.

Our current findings reveal that\nconstraining the action space and incorporating self-observation are key\nfactors for achieving stable and consistent opinion leader generation for\ntopic-specific influence.

    "abstract": "Open-Vocabulary 3D object affordance grounding aims to anticipate ``action\npossibilities'' regions on 3D objects with arbitrary instructions, which is\ncrucial for robots to generically perceive real scenarios and respond to\noperational changes. Existing methods focus on combining images or languages\nthat depict interactions with 3D geometries to introduce external interaction\npriors. However, they are still vulnerable to a limited semantic space by\nfailing to leverage implied invariant geometries and potential interaction\nintentions. Normally, humans address complex tasks through multi-step reasoning\nand respond to diverse situations by leveraging associative and analogical\nthinking. In light of this, we propose GREAT (GeometRy-intEntion collAboraTive\ninference) for Open-Vocabulary 3D Object Affordance Grounding, a novel\nframework that mines the object invariant geometry attributes and performs\nanalogically reason in potential interaction scenarios to form affordance\nknowledge, fully combining the knowledge with both geometries and visual\ncontents to ground 3D object affordance. Besides, we introduce the Point Image\nAffordance Dataset v2 (PIADv2), the largest 3D object affordance dataset at\npresent to support the task. Extensive experiments demonstrate the\neffectiveness and superiority of GREAT. The code and dataset are available at\nhttps://yawen-shao.github.io/GREAT/.",

Moreover, based in the interchange of mass in the\nporous media models, we can model the interchange of cars between streets and\noff-street parking-spaces. Therefore, our model is not a standard conservation\nlaw, being formulated as the coupling of a non-stationary\nconvection-diffusion-reaction PDE with a Darcy-Brinkman-Forchheimer PDE system.\nTo solve this model, the classical Galerkin P1 finite element method combined\nwith an explicit time marching scheme of strong stability-preserving type was\nenough to stabilize our numerical solutions. Numerical experiences on an\nurban-porous domain inspired by the city of Guadalajara (Mexico) allow us to\nsimulate the influence of the porosity terms on the traffic speed, the traffic\nflow at rush-valley hours, and the streets congestions due to the lack of\nparking spaces.",

However, previous research\nhas overlooked a crucial concern in image recognition: ensuring that models\ntrained on condensed datasets are unbiased towards protected attributes (PA),\nsuch as gender and race. Our investigation reveals that dataset distillation\n(DD) fails to alleviate the unfairness towards minority groups within original\ndatasets. Moreover, this bias typically worsens in the condensed datasets due\nto their smaller size. To bridge the research gap, we propose a novel fair\ndataset distillation (FDD) framework, namely FairDD, which can be seamlessly\napplied to diverse matching-based DD approaches, requiring no modifications to\ntheir original architectures. The key innovation of FairDD lies in\nsynchronously matching synthetic datasets to PA-wise groups of original\ndatasets, rather than indiscriminate alignment to the whole distributions in\nvanilla DDs, dominated by majority groups. This synchronized matching allows\nsynthetic datasets to avoid collapsing into majority groups and bootstrap their\nbalanced generation to all PA groups. Consequently, FairDD could effectively\nregularize vanilla DDs to favor biased generation toward minority groups while\nmaintaining the accuracy of target attributes. Theoretical analyses and\nextensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that FairDD significantly\nimproves fairness compared to vanilla DD methods, without sacrificing\nclassification accuracy. Its consistent superiority across diverse DDs,\nspanning Distribution and Gradient Matching, establishes it as a versatile FDD\napproach.",

However, their precise impact on observable\nparticle dynamics remains poorly understood. In this study, we address this gap\nby providing a scale-bridging view of a minimal active mixture with\nnonreciprocal polar interactions. We find that nonreciprocity induces chiral\nmotion on the particle level, yet no full, homogeneous synchronization.\nInstead, we observe various behaviors, ranging from fully synchronized clusters\nto chimera-like states.

Here we argue that, rather than the topological structure of\neach network snapshot, the main property of the trajectory that needs to be\npreserved in the embedding is the relative graph distance between snapshots.\nThis idea naturally leads to dimensionality reduction approaches that\nexplicitly consider relative distances, such as Multidimensional Scaling (MDS)\nor identifying the distance matrix as a feature matrix in which to perform\nPrincipal Component Analysis (PCA). This paper provides a comprehensible\nmethodology that illustrates this approach.

Precision and recall improve\nby 10% and 17% for multispeaker datasets, and by 24% and 17% for individual\nspeaker datasets, compared to raw data classifiers. This work provides a\nfoundational proof of concept for utilizing memristive nanowire networks (NWN)\nin edge-computing devices, showcasing their potential for efficient, real-time\naudio signal processing with reduced computational overhead and power\nconsumption, and enabling the development of advanced neuromorphic computing\nsolutions.",

This foundational mesh layer, based on metallic\nmesh structures, spans the entire brain and generates interference patterns,\nnoise, and resonance effects that modulate both local and global neural\ndynamics. The fused model goes beyond traditional connectivity frameworks by\nproviding a unified explanation for phenomena such as brain-wide phase\ngradients, stable low-frequency resonance frequencies, and long-range\nplasticity effects, which are often difficult to explain cohesively within\nexisting models.\n  In addition to accounting for classical neurobiological observations, such as\nphase synchrony, functional connectivity fluctuations, and local Hebbian\nplasticity, the model offers novel insights into less understood phenomena.\nSpecifically, it predicts connectivity-independent phase gradients across\nnon-synaptic regions, harmonic resonance peaks consistent across individuals,\nand diffuse plasticity driven by global interference patterns, all of which are\nchallenging to explain under current frameworks.\n  These unique predictions align with partial empirical observations, such as\ntraveling wave dynamics, consistent low-frequency oscillations, and\ntask-induced connectivity shifts, underscoring the model's relevance.\nAdditionally, the brain-mesh model generates testable hypotheses that\ndistinguish it from traditional approaches.

The numerical investigations we performed, demonstrate\nthat the proposed control strategy effectively suppresses synchronized dynamics\nwithin the swarmalator population.

We aim to share\nthe data with the scientific community as part of the multi-messenger effort at\ndifferent levels and for educational activities to engage the general public.\nFollowing the first portal created in 2007, a new portal hosted at\n\\url{https://opendata.auger.org} was established in February 2021. The portal\nis regularly updated and comprises 10\\% of the recorded cosmic-ray data\norganized in various datasets, each with a specific DOI provided by Zenodo.\nMoreover, a catalog with the 100 most energetic events is available. The portal\nadopts a ``dual'' concept, offering not only the download of public data but\nalso a series of Jupyter notebooks. These notebooks allow the general public to\nreproduce some of the most important results obtained by the Pierre Auger\nCollaboration and understand the main mechanisms governing the development of\nthe extensive air showers produced by the interaction of cosmic rays in the\nEarth's atmosphere. In 2023, the Pierre Auger Observatory joined the\nInternational Particle Physics Outreach Group (IPPOG). The successful debut\nenrolled 550 high-school students at 12 research institutions from 5 countries\nand was repeated this year, embracing yet more students and countries\nworldwide. During this day, the participants attend seminars about cosmic rays\nand are asked to reconstruct subsets of public data events using an Auger 3-D\nevent display. Finally, they participate in a Zoom session with scientists at\nthe Auger site.",

Traditionally, TDOM generation\ninvolves a complex set of traditional photogrammetric process, which may\ndeteriorate due to various challenges, including inaccurate Digital Surface\nModel (DSM), degenerated occlusion detections, and visual artifacts in weak\ntexture regions and reflective surfaces, etc. To address these challenges, we\nintroduce TOrtho-Gaussian, a novel method inspired by 3D Gaussian Splatting\n(3DGS) that generates TDOMs through orthogonal splatting of optimized\nanisotropic Gaussian kernel. More specifically, we first simplify the\northophoto generation by orthographically splatting the Gaussian kernels onto\n2D image planes, formulating a geometrically elegant solution that avoids the\nneed for explicit DSM and occlusion detection. Second, to produce TDOM of\nlarge-scale area, a divide-and-conquer strategy is adopted to optimize memory\nusage and time efficiency of training and rendering for 3DGS. Lastly, we design\na fully anisotropic Gaussian kernel that adapts to the varying characteristics\nof different regions, particularly improving the rendering quality of\nreflective surfaces and slender structures. Extensive experimental evaluations\ndemonstrate that our method outperforms existing commercial software in several\naspects, including the accuracy of building boundaries, the visual quality of\nlow-texture regions and building facades.

Indeed, non-destructive testing with industrial CT will\noften involve scanning multiple similar objects while maintaining high\nthroughput, requiring short scanning times, which is not a relevant concern in\nclinical CT. Under-sampling the tomographic data (sinograms) is a natural way\nto reduce the scanning time at the cost of image quality since the latter\ndepends on the number of measurements. In such a scenario, post-processing\ntechniques are required to compensate for the image artifacts induced by the\nsinogram sparsity. We introduce the Self-supervised Denoiser Framework (SDF), a\nself-supervised training method that leverages pre-training on highly sampled\nsinogram data to enhance the quality of images reconstructed from undersampled\nsinogram data. The main contribution of SDF is that it proposes to train an\nimage denoiser in the sinogram space by setting the learning task as the\nprediction of one sinogram subset from another. As such, it does not require\nground-truth image data, leverages the abundant data modality in CT, the\nsinogram, and can drastically enhance the quality of images reconstructed from\na fraction of the measurements. We demonstrate that SDF produces better image\nquality, in terms of peak signal-to-noise ratio, than other analytical and\nself-supervised frameworks in both 2D fan-beam or 3D cone-beam CT settings.\nMoreover, we show that the enhancement provided by SDF carries over when\nfine-tuning the image denoiser on a few examples, making it a suitable\npre-training technique in a context where there is little high-quality image\ndata. Our results are established on experimental datasets, making SDF a strong\ncandidate for being the building block of foundational image-enhancement models\nin CT.",

This model reproduces quantitatively the instability timescale found\nnumerically. We can observe signpost of this process on exoplanet systems\narchitecture. The critical spacing ensuring stability scales as the planet-to\nstar mass ratio to the power 1/4.

    "abstract": "In underwater images, most useful features are occluded by water. The extent\nof the occlusion depends on imaging geometry and can vary even across a\nsequence of burst images. As a result, 3D reconstruction methods robust on\nin-air scenes, like Neural Radiance Field methods (NeRFs) or 3D Gaussian\nSplatting (3DGS), fail on underwater scenes. While a recent underwater\nadaptation of NeRFs achieved state-of-the-art results, it is impractically\nslow: reconstruction takes hours and its rendering rate, in frames per second\n(FPS), is less than 1. Here, we present a new method that takes only a few\nminutes for reconstruction and renders novel underwater scenes at 140 FPS.\nNamed Gaussian Splashing, our method unifies the strengths and speed of 3DGS\nwith an image formation model for capturing scattering, introducing innovations\nin the rendering and depth estimation procedures and in the 3DGS loss function.\nDespite the complexities of underwater adaptation, our method produces images\nat unparalleled speeds with superior details. Moreover, it reveals distant\nscene details with far greater clarity than other methods, dramatically\nimproving reconstructed and rendered images. We demonstrate results on existing\ndatasets and a new dataset we have collected.\n  Additional visual results are available at:\nhttps://bgu-cs-vil.github.io/gaussiansplashingUW.github.io/ .",

We investigate\nthe universal dynamics of the generalized LE across regimes of weak and strong\ndissipation.

    "abstract": "Feature upsampling is an essential operation in constructing deep\nconvolutional neural networks. However, existing upsamplers either lack\nspecific feature guidance or necessitate the utilization of high-resolution\nfeature maps, resulting in a loss of performance and flexibility. In this\npaper, we find that the local self-attention naturally has the feature guidance\ncapability, and its computational paradigm aligns closely with the essence of\nfeature upsampling (\\ie feature reassembly of neighboring points). Therefore,\nwe introduce local self-attention into the upsampling task and demonstrate that\nthe majority of existing upsamplers can be regarded as special cases of\nupsamplers based on local self-attention. Considering the potential semantic\ngap between upsampled points and their neighboring points, we further introduce\nthe deformation mechanism into the upsampler based on local self-attention,\nthereby proposing LDA-AQU. As a novel dynamic kernel-based upsampler, LDA-AQU\nutilizes the feature of queries to guide the model in adaptively adjusting the\nposition and aggregation weight of neighboring points, thereby meeting the\nupsampling requirements across various complex scenarios. In addition, LDA-AQU\nis lightweight and can be easily integrated into various model architectures.\nWe evaluate the effectiveness of LDA-AQU across four dense prediction tasks:\nobject detection, instance segmentation, panoptic segmentation, and semantic\nsegmentation. LDA-AQU consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art\nupsamplers, achieving performance enhancements of 1.7 AP, 1.5 AP, 2.0 PQ, and\n2.5 mIoU compared to the baseline models in the aforementioned four tasks,\nrespectively.

While sentiment analysis has been extensively studied for\nlanguages like English, research in Bengali, remains limited, particularly for\nfine-grained sentiment categorization. This work aims to connect this gap by\ndeveloping a novel approach that integrates rule-based algorithms with\npre-trained language models. We developed a dataset from scratch, comprising\nover 15,000 manually labeled reviews. Next, we constructed a Lexicon Data\nDictionary, assigning polarity scores to the reviews. We developed a novel rule\nbased algorithm Bangla Sentiment Polarity Score (BSPS), an approach capable of\ngenerating sentiment scores and classifying reviews into nine distinct\nsentiment categories. To assess the performance of this method, we evaluated\nthe classified sentiments using BanglaBERT, a pre-trained transformer-based\nlanguage model. We also performed sentiment classification directly with\nBanglaBERT on the original data and evaluated this model's results. Our\nanalysis revealed that the BSPS + BanglaBERT hybrid approach outperformed the\nstandalone BanglaBERT model, achieving higher accuracy, precision, and nuanced\nclassification across the nine sentiment categories.

By median-stacking 353\nprestellar and 132 protostellar cores from the Herschel Gould Belt Survey and\nusing LOFAR Two-Meter Sky Survey (LoTSS) data (20\" resolution), 18 protostellar\nand 5 prestellar radio candidates were initially identified. However, these\nwere likely extragalactic contaminants within the Herschel catalog. Stacked\nanalyses did not reveal significant radio counterparts for prestellar and\nprotostellar cores, with upper limits of $5\\, \\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$ and $8\\,\n\\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$, respectively. Non-detections suggest strong extinction\nmechanisms like free-free absorption and the Razin-Tsytovich effect for\nprotostellar cores. For prestellar cores, analytical magnetostatic-isothermal\nmodels constrain the maximum ordered magnetic-field strength to 100 $\\mu$G.\nFuture predictions suggest that Square Kilometre Array-Low (SKA-Low) arrays\ncould detect this emission in 9 hours (AA*) or 4 hours (AA4), enabling more\nsensitive constraints on synchrotron radiation in star-forming cores.",

PVS enlargement may indicate\nimpaired clearance pathways and there is a need for reliable PVS detection\nmethods which are currently lacking. Aim: To optimise a widely used deep\nlearning model, the no-new-UNet (nnU-Net), for PVS segmentation. Methods: In 30\nhealthy participants (mean$\\pm$SD age: 50$\\pm$18.9 years; 13 females),\nT1-weighted MRI images were acquired using three different protocols on three\nMRI scanners (3T Siemens Tim Trio, 3T Philips Achieva, and 7T Siemens\nMagnetom). PVS were manually segmented across ten axial slices in each\nparticipant. Segmentations were completed using a sparse annotation strategy.\nIn total, 11 models were compared using various strategies for image handling,\npreprocessing and semi-supervised learning with pseudo-labels. Model\nperformance was evaluated using 5-fold cross validation (5FCV). The main\nperformance metric was the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC). Results: The\nvoxel-spacing agnostic model (mean$\\pm$SD DSC=64.3$\\pm$3.3%) outperformed\nmodels which resampled images to a common resolution (DSC=40.5-55%). Model\nperformance improved substantially following iterative label cleaning\n(DSC=85.7$\\pm$1.2%). Semi-supervised learning with pseudo-labels (n=12,740)\nfrom 18 additional datasets improved the agreement between raw and predicted\nPVS cluster counts (Lin's concordance correlation coefficient=0.89,\n95%CI=0.82-0.94). We extended the model to enable PVS segmentation in the\nmidbrain (DSC=64.3$\\pm$6.5%) and hippocampus (DSC=67.8$\\pm$5%).

We find\nthat signal loss in MR magnitude images can be one distinct contributor to the\ntemperature imaging signal void. Therefore, this study aims to investigate this\nfinding and more importantly. Also, this study intends to improve measurement\naccuracy by correcting CSF-induced temperature errors and employing a more\nreliable phase unwrapping algorithm. A gradient echo sequence with certain TE\nvalues for temperature imaging is used to quantify T2* variations during\nMRgLITT and to investigate the development of signal voids throughout the\ntreatment. Informed by these findings, a multi-echo GRE sequence with\nappropriate TE coverage is employed. A multi-echo-based correction algorithm is\ndeveloped to address the signal loss-induced temperature errors. A new phase\nunwrapping method and a new CSF pulsation correction approach are developed for\nmulti-echo signal processing. The temperature imaging method is evaluated by\ngel phantom, ex-vivo, and in-vivo LITT heating experiments. T2* shortening\nduring heating can be one important cause of the temperate imaging signal voids\nand this demands the multi-echo acquisition with varied TE values. The proposed\nmulti-echo-based method can effectively correct signal loss-induced temperature\nerrors and raise temperature estimation precision.

DEVA consolidates available in-vehicle edge\ndevices to maintain the resource pool, distributes video frames for analysis to\ndevices considering resource availability in each device, and dynamically\nadjusts frame rates of dashcams to control the overall workloads. The entire\nvideo analytics task is divided into multiple independent phases and executed\nin a pipelined manner to improve the overall frame processing throughput. We\nimplement DEVA in an Android app and also develop a dashcam emulation app to be\nused in vehicles that are not equipped with dashcams. Experimental results\nusing the apps and commercial smartphones show that DEVA can process real-time\nvideos from two dashcams with frame rates of around 22~30 FPS per camera within\n200 ms of latency, using three high-end devices.",

While current approaches typically distill 3D semantic\nfeatures from 2D foundational models (e.g., CLIP and SAM) to facilitate novel\nview segmentation and semantic understanding, their heavy reliance on 2D\nsupervision can undermine cross-view semantic consistency and necessitate\ncomplex data preparation processes, therefore hindering view-consistent scene\nunderstanding. In this work, we present FreeGS, an unsupervised\nsemantic-embedded 3DGS framework that achieves view-consistent 3D scene\nunderstanding without the need for 2D labels. Instead of directly learning\nsemantic features, we introduce the IDentity-coupled Semantic Field (IDSF) into\n3DGS, which captures both semantic representations and view-consistent instance\nindices for each Gaussian. We optimize IDSF with a two-step alternating\nstrategy: semantics help to extract coherent instances in 3D space, while the\nresulting instances regularize the injection of stable semantics from 2D space.\nAdditionally, we adopt a 2D-3D joint contrastive loss to enhance the\ncomplementarity between view-consistent 3D geometry and rich semantics during\nthe bootstrapping process, enabling FreeGS to uniformly perform tasks such as\nnovel-view semantic segmentation, object selection, and 3D object detection.\nExtensive experiments on LERF-Mask, 3D-OVS, and ScanNet datasets demonstrate\nthat FreeGS performs comparably to state-of-the-art methods while avoiding the\ncomplex data preprocessing workload.

In the automotive industry, there is a\ngrowing demand for knowledge transfer of failure analysis from experienced\nengineers to young engineers. However, failure events are phenomena that occur\nin a chain reaction, making them difficult for beginners to analyze them. While\nknowledge graphs, which can describe semantic relationships and structure\ninformation is effective in representing failure events, due to their\ncapability of representing the relationships between components, there is much\ninformation in KGs, so it is challenging for young engineers to extract and\nunderstand sub-graphs from the KG. On the other hand, there is increasing\ninterest in the use of Graph RAG, a type of RAG that combines LLMs and KGs for\nknowledge management. However, when using the current Graph RAG framework with\nan existing knowledge graph for automobile failures, several issues arise\nbecause it is difficult to generate executable queries for a knowledge graph\ndatabase which is not constructed by LLMs. To address this, we focused on\noptimizing the Graph RAG pipeline for existing knowledge graphs. Using an\noriginal Q&A dataset, the ROUGE F1 score of the sentences generated by the\nproposed method showed an average improvement of 157.6% compared to the current\nmethod.

Here, we report the lattice vibration, Raman modes, and\nroom-temperature spin-phonon coupling in 2D Fe3GaTe2 with\nabove-room-temperature Curie temperature (TC). Two typical Raman modes with\nout-of-plane lattice vibrations are identified: \"A\" _\"1g\" ^\"1\" and \"A\" _\"1g\"\n^\"2\" , whose frequencies increase as the thickness decreases from bulk to 2D\nFe3GaTe2 due to the weakening of interlayer vdW interactions and spin exchange\ncoupling.

In this analysis, we\nrevisited the radio loudness statistics of quasars by significantly expanding\nthe pool of known sources. Our main goal was to create a new, value-added\nquasar catalog with information about their extinction-corrected magnitudes,\nradio flux density, possible contamination levels, and other flags, besides\ntheir sky coordinates and photometric redshifts. We cross-matched the optical\nQuaia catalog of about 1.3 million quasars (from the Gaia data) with 1.9\nmillion sources from the Very Large Array Sky Survey (VLASS) radio catalog. We\nexplored different thresholds for the matching radius, balancing completeness\nand purity of the resulting Quaia-VLASS catalog, and found 1.5 arcseconds a\nsufficient choice. Our main finding is that the quasar radio-loud fraction is\nin good agreement with previous works (< 10%), and there is no significant\nlarge-scale sky pattern in radio loudness. The exact estimate depends on the\nG-band magnitude limit, and we observed weak trends with redshift and absolute\noptical magnitude, possibly indicating remnant systematic effects in our data.\nThe cross-matched Quaia-VLASS catalog with 43,650 sources and accompanying code\nare freely available at doi:10.5281/zenodo.16035690. This latest census of QSOs\nwith radio counterparts will facilitate further investigations of the dichotomy\nof radio-loud and radio-quiet quasars, and it may also support other lines of\nresearch.",

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in fine-tuning proprietary language models enable\ncustomized applications across various domains but also introduce two major\nchallenges: high resource demands and security risks. Regarding resource\ndemands, recent work proposes novel partial compression, such as BitDelta, to\nquantize the delta weights between the fine-tuned model and base model.\nRegarding the security risks, user-defined fine-tuning can introduce security\nvulnerabilities, such as alignment issues, backdoor attacks, and\nhallucinations. However, most of the current efforts in security assessment\nfocus on the full-precision or full-compression models, it is not\nwell-discussed how the partial compression methods affect security concerns. To\nbridge this gap, we evaluate the robustness of delta-weight quantization\nagainst these security threats. In this paper, we uncover a \"free lunch\"\nphenomenon: partial compression can enhance model security against\nfine-tuning-based attacks with bearable utility loss. Using Llama-2-7b-chat as\na case study, we show that, with under 10% utility degradation, the partial\ncompression mitigates alignment-breaking risks by up to 66.17%, harmful\nbackdoor vulnerabilities by 64.46%, and targeted output manipulation risks by\nup to 90.53%. We further apply LogitLens to visualize internal state\ntransformations during forward passes, suggesting mechanisms for both security\nfailure and recovery in standard versus compressed fine-tuning. This work\noffers new insights into selecting effective delta compression methods for\nsecure, resource-efficient multi-tenant services.",

Existing models have limited\nspatial perception and often exhibit structural hallucinations in this\nhigh-specification generative task. To address this issue, we propose a novel\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework, termed RAGDiffusion, to enhance\nstructure determinacy and mitigate hallucinations by assimilating external\nknowledge from LLM and databases.

While discrete generation methods are widely\nused, they suffer from limited expressiveness and frame-wise noise artifacts.\nIn contrast, continuous approaches produce smoother, more natural motion but\noften struggle to adhere to conditioning signals due to high-dimensional\ncomplexity and limited training data. To resolve this 'discord' between\ndiscrete and continuous representations we introduce DisCoRD: Discrete Tokens\nto Continuous Motion via Rectified Flow Decoding, a novel method that leverages\nrectified flow to decode discrete motion tokens in the continuous, raw motion\nspace. Our core idea is to frame token decoding as a conditional generation\ntask, ensuring that DisCoRD captures fine-grained dynamics and achieves\nsmoother, more natural motions. Compatible with any discrete-based framework,\nour method enhances naturalness without compromising faithfulness to the\nconditioning signals on diverse settings. Extensive evaluations demonstrate\nthat DisCoRD achieves state-of-the-art performance, with FID of 0.032 on\nHumanML3D and 0.169 on KIT-ML.

A mission called Theia has\nbeen submitted in 2022 for ESA's M7 call for missions, using a\ndiffraction-limited telescope about 1m in diameter and with a field of view of\n0.5 degrees, capable of achieving sub-micro-arcsecond angular accuracy,\ncorresponding to 1e-5 pixel on the detector. Such precision makes it possible\nto study the nature of dark matter in our galaxy and to reveal the architecture\nof exoplanetary systems close to the Sun, down to the mass of the Earth. The\naim of the experimental tests presented in this poster is to improve the TRL of\n2 specific aspects: the calibration of new CMOS detectors with very large\nnumber of pixels and the calibration of the telescope aberrations.First, a key\nelement of such a space telescope is the focal plane, which must be calibrated\nspatially with an extreme precision down to the 1e-5 pixel level. Previous work\nhas shown that this is possible with small detector matrices (80x80 px) [1].\nThe goal is now to check the performances and validate this method with the new\nvery large detectors. Pyxalis, a company based near Grenoble, is developing\nvery large detectors (8000x5000 px) that have a low noise level and high\nsensitivity. The aim is to characterize and validate this type of detectors in\na laboratory demonstration (see poster Pancher et al.), to ensure that the\nperformance achieved meets the required specifications. We present the results\nof these characterization in this contribution.The telescope stability is also\na sensitive issue. Recent work [2] has shown that the reference stars in the\nfield of the telescope can be used as actual metrology sources in order to\ncompute the field distortion function. Our simulations allow to model the\noptical aberrations with bivariate polynoms. The effects on the calibration\naccuracy of the degrees of the polynoms, the number of reference stars and the\ntilt perturbation of the M2 mirror are investigated.

We found no radio emission above\n$3\\sigma$ noise levels ($\\sim11$ and $\\sim18~\\mu$Jy~beam$^{-1}$ for the VLASS\nand FIRST maps, respectively) in either of the stacked images for the LRD\nsample, while the noise levels of the single-epoch images are comparable to\nthose found earlier in the stacking of high-redshift radio-quiet active\ngalactic nuclei (AGNs). The non-detection of radio emission in LRDs suggests\nthese sources host weaker (or no) radio AGNs.",

    "abstract": "Continuous-variable (CV) quantum computing is a promising candidate for\nquantum computation because it can, even with one mode, utilize\ninfinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces and can efficiently handle continuous\nvalues. Although photonic platforms have been considered as a leading platform\nfor CV computation, hybrid systems that use both qubits and bosonic modes,\ne.g., superconducting hardware, have shown significant advances because they\ncan prepare non-Gaussian states by utilizing the nonlinear interaction between\nthe qubits and the bosonic modes. However, the size of hybrid hardware is\ncurrently restricted. Moreover, the fidelity of the non-Gaussian state is also\nrestricted. This work extends the projective squeezing method to establish a\nformalism for projecting quantum states onto the states that are\nunitary-transformed from the squeezed vacuum at the expense of the sampling\ncost. Based on this formalism, we propose methods for simulating larger quantum\ndevices and projecting states onto the cubic phase state, a typical\nnon-Gaussian state, with a higher squeezing level and higher nonlinearity. To\nmake implementation practical, we can, by leveraging the interactions in hybrid\nsystems of qubits and bosonic modes, apply the smeared projector by using\neither the linear-combination-of-unitaries or virtual quantum error detection\nalgorithms. We numerically verify the performance of our methods and show that\nprojection can suppress the effect of photon-loss errors.",

Existing benchmarks\nprimarily focus on single-table QA, failing to capture the intricacies of\nreasoning across multiple relational tables, as required in real-world domains\nsuch as finance, healthcare, and e-commerce. To address this gap, we present\nTQA-Bench, a new multi-table QA benchmark designed to evaluate the capabilities\nof LLMs in tackling complex QA tasks over relational data. Our benchmark\nincorporates diverse relational database instances sourced from real-world\npublic datasets and introduces a flexible sampling mechanism to create tasks\nwith varying multi-table context lengths, ranging from 8K to 64K tokens. To\nensure robustness and reliability, we integrate symbolic extensions into the\nevaluation framework, enabling the assessment of LLM reasoning capabilities\nbeyond simple data retrieval or probabilistic pattern matching. We\nsystematically evaluate a range of LLMs, both open-source and closed-source,\nspanning model scales from 7 billion to 70 billion parameters.

    "abstract": "Clustering is a long-standing problem area in data mining. The centroid-based\nclassical approaches to clustering mainly face difficulty in the case of high\ndimensional inputs such as images. With the advent of deep neural networks, a\ncommon approach to this problem is to map the data to some latent space of\ncomparatively lower dimensions and then do the clustering in that space.\nNetwork architectures adopted for this are generally autoencoders that\nreconstruct a given input in the output. To keep the input in some compact\nform, the encoder in AE's learns to extract useful features that get decoded at\nthe reconstruction end. A well-known centroid-based clustering algorithm is\nK-means. In the context of deep feature learning, recent works have empirically\nshown the importance of learning the representations and the cluster centroids\ntogether. However, in this aspect of joint learning, recently a continuous\nvariant of K-means has been proposed; where the softmax function is used in\nplace of argmax to learn the clustering and network parameters jointly using\nstochastic gradient descent (SGD). However, unlike K-means, where the input\nspace stays constant, here the learning of the centroid is done in parallel to\nthe learning of the latent space for every batch of data. Such batch updates\ndisagree with the concept of classical K-means, where the clustering space\nremains constant as it is the input space itself. To this end, we propose to\nalternatively learn a clustering-friendly data representation and K-means based\ncluster centers.

However, it is challenging to reliably obtain\nthe precise measurement in computer networks because of the high measurement\ncost, and the unavoidable transmission loss. Although some methods proposed in\nrecent years allowed estimating network traffic from partial flow-level or\nlink-level measurements, they often perform poorly for traffic matrix\nestimation nowadays. Despite strong assumptions like low-rank structure and the\nprior distribution, existing techniques are usually task-specific and tend to\nbe significantly worse as modern network communication is extremely complicated\nand dynamic. To address the dilemma, this paper proposed a diffusion-based\ntraffic matrix analysis framework named Diffusion-TM, which leverages\nproblem-agnostic diffusion to notably elevate the estimation performance in\nboth traffic distribution and accuracy. The novel framework not only takes\nadvantage of the powerful generative ability of diffusion models to produce\nrealistic network traffic, but also leverages the denoising process to\nunbiasedly estimate all end-to-end traffic in a plug-and-play manner under\ntheoretical guarantee. Moreover, taking into account that compiling an intact\ntraffic dataset is usually infeasible, we also propose a two-stage training\nscheme to make our framework be insensitive to missing values in the dataset.\nWith extensive experiments with real-world datasets, we illustrate the\neffectiveness of Diffusion-TM on several tasks.

There is a moderate positive correlation between the bolometric\nluminosity ($L_{bol}$) and $L_{SiO}$ for both components (narrow and broad).\nThe UC $H_{II}$ sources show a weaker positive correlation between $L_{bol}$\nand $L_{SiO}$ and higher $L_{SiO}$ compared to the sources without UC $H_{II}$\nregions.

Many of these tasks are\nperformed in large batches or even offline, and the performance indictor for\nwhich is throughput. These tasks usually show the characteristic of prefix\nsharing, where different prompt input can partially show the common prefix.\nHowever, the existing LLM inference engines tend to optimize the streaming\nrequests and show limitations of supporting the large batched tasks with the\nprefix sharing characteristic. The existing solutions use the LRU-based cache\nto reuse the KV context of common prefix between requests. The KV context that\nare about to be reused may prematurely evicted with the implicit cache\nmanagement. Besides, the streaming oriented systems do not leverage the\nrequest-batch information and can not mix the decoding tokens with the prefill\nchunks to the best for the batched scenarios, and thus fails to saturate the\nGPU. We propose BatchLLM to address the above problems. BatchLLM explicitly\nidentifies the common prefixes globally. The requests sharing the same prefix\nwill be scheduled together to reuse the KV context the best. BatchLLM reorders\nthe requests and schedules the requests with larger ratio of decoding first to\nbetter mix the decoding tokens with the latter prefill chunks, and applies\nmemory-centric token batching to enlarge the token-batch sizes, which helps to\nincrease the GPU utilization. Finally, BatchLLM optimizes the prefix-shared\nAttention kernel with horizontal fusion to reduce tail effect and kernel launch\noverhead.

In\nclassical General Relativity (GR), a horizon is the defining feature of a black\nhole, which prevents any event inside from causally affecting the outside\nUniverse. The quest for distinguishing black holes from horizonless compact\nobjects using gravitational wave (GW) signals from compact binary coalescences\n(CBCs) can be helped by utilizing the phenomenon of tidal heating (TH), which\nleaves its imprint on the binary waveforms through the horizon parameters.\nFirst, we study the measurabilities of these parameters within the inspiral\nregime. Then, to extend our investigation for heavier binaries, we construct an\ninspiral-merger-ringdown waveform by using post-Newtonian calculations for the\ninspiral and numerical relativity data for the merger-ringdown part that\nincorporates the effects of tidal heating of black holes in the phase and the\namplitude. The new model shows improvements in waveform accuracy when compared\nto numerical relativity data. In the late inspiral phase when the compact\nobjects are closer to each other, the effects of tidal heating are stronger,\nopening up the possibility of identifying the objects more precisely. We\ndemonstrate, from numerical relativity data of binary black holes, how one can\nmodel tidal heating in the late inspiral regime and leverage this knowledge to\ntest for horizonless compact objects mimicking black holes. These studies bear\nsignificance in determining the nature of compact objects having masses in the\nentire range that LIGO and future ground-based gravitational-wave detectors can\ndetect.",

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) are susceptible to backdoor attacks, where\nadversaries poison datasets with adversary-specified triggers to implant hidden\nbackdoors, enabling malicious manipulation of model predictions. Dataset\npurification serves as a proactive defense by removing malicious training\nsamples to prevent backdoor injection at its source. We first reveal that the\ncurrent advanced purification methods rely on a latent assumption that the\nbackdoor connections between triggers and target labels in backdoor attacks are\nsimpler to learn than the benign features. We demonstrate that this assumption,\nhowever, does not always hold, especially in all-to-all (A2A) and untargeted\n(UT) attacks. As a result, purification methods that analyze the separation\nbetween the poisoned and benign samples in the input-output space or the final\nhidden layer space are less effective. We observe that this separability is not\nconfined to a single layer but varies across different hidden layers. Motivated\nby this understanding, we propose FLARE, a universal purification method to\ncounter various backdoor attacks. FLARE aggregates abnormal activations from\nall hidden layers to construct representations for clustering. To enhance\nseparation, FLARE develops an adaptive subspace selection algorithm to isolate\nthe optimal space for dividing an entire dataset into two clusters. FLARE\nassesses the stability of each cluster and identifies the cluster with higher\nstability as poisoned. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of FLARE against 22 representative backdoor attacks,\nincluding all-to-one (A2O), all-to-all (A2A), and untargeted (UT) attacks, and\nits robustness to adaptive attacks.

    "abstract": "Retrieval augmented generation has emerged as an effective method to enhance\nlarge language model performance. This approach typically relies on an internal\nretrieval module that uses various indexing mechanisms to manage a static\npre-processed corpus. However, such a paradigm often falls short when it is\nnecessary to integrate the most up-to-date information that has not been\nupdated into the corpus during generative inference time. In this paper, we\nexplore an alternative approach that leverages standard search engine APIs to\ndynamically integrate the latest online information (without maintaining any\nindex for any fixed corpus), thereby improving the quality of generated\ncontent. We design a collaborative LLM-based paradigm, where we include: (i) a\nparser-LLM that determines if the Internet augmented generation is demanded and\nextracts the search keywords if so with a single inference; (ii) a mixed\nranking strategy that re-ranks the retrieved HTML files to eliminate bias\nintroduced from the search engine API; and (iii) an extractor-LLM that can\naccurately and efficiently extract relevant information from the fresh content\nin each HTML file. We conduct extensive empirical studies to evaluate the\nperformance of this Internet search augmented generation paradigm. The\nexperimental results demonstrate that our method generates content with\nsignificantly improved quality.

Assuming that the LLM can\ngenerate a correct solution with non-zero probability and do better than a\nrandom guess in comparing a pair of correct and incorrect solutions, we prove\ntheoretically that the failure probability of this algorithm decays to zero\nexponentially or by a power law (depending on the specific way of scaling) as\nits test-time compute grows. The second one is a two-stage league-style\nalgorithm, where each candidate is evaluated by its average win rate against\nmultiple opponents, rather than eliminated upon loss to a single opponent.\nUnder analogous but more robust assumptions, we prove that its failure\nprobability also decays to zero exponentially with more test-time compute.

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks have demonstrated remarkable performance in various\nvision tasks, but their success heavily depends on the quality of the training\ndata. Noisy labels are a critical issue in medical datasets and can\nsignificantly degrade model performance. Previous clean sample selection\nmethods have not utilized the well pre-trained features of vision foundation\nmodels (VFMs) and assumed that training begins from scratch. In this paper, we\npropose CUFIT, a curriculum fine-tuning paradigm of VFMs for medical image\nclassification under label noise. Our method is motivated by the fact that\nlinear probing of VFMs is relatively unaffected by noisy samples, as it does\nnot update the feature extractor of the VFM, thus robustly classifying the\ntraining samples. Subsequently, curriculum fine-tuning of two adapters is\nconducted, starting with clean sample selection from the linear probing phase.\nOur experimental results demonstrate that CUFIT outperforms previous methods\nacross various medical image benchmarks. Specifically, our method surpasses\nprevious baselines by 5.0%, 2.1%, 4.6%, and 5.8% at a 40% noise rate on the\nHAM10000, APTOS-2019, BloodMnist, and OrgancMnist datasets, respectively.\nFurthermore, we provide extensive analyses to demonstrate the impact of our\nmethod on noisy label detection.

By incorporating multimodal instructions,\nGalaxAlign eliminates the need for expensive pretraining and enhances the\neffectiveness of fine-tuning.

In\nthis work, we focus on the problem of reconstructing a multi-object scene from\na single RGBD image, generally from a fixed camera in the scene. Traditional\nscene representation methods generally cannot infer the geometry of unobserved\nregions of the objects from the image. Attempts have been made to leverage deep\nlearning to train on a dataset of observed objects and representations, and\nthen generalize to new observations.

We introduce a novel task aimed at generating human motion\nvideos solely from reference images and natural language. This approach offers\ngreater flexibility and ease of use, as text is more accessible than the\ndesired guidance videos. However, training an end-to-end model for this task\nrequires millions of high-quality text and human motion video pairs, which are\nchallenging to obtain.

To overcome these challenges, we introduce an anchor point based\nrescale method and design a skeleton adapter to fill in missing details and\nbridge the gap between text-to-motion and motion-to-video generation.

A large\nlanguage model (LLM) is employed to decompose natural language into discrete\nmotion sequences, enabling the generation of motion videos of any desired\nlength.

Prior studies observe that LLMs' performance declines\nwhen intervening on surface structure, arguing their success relies on surface\nstructure recognition. However, surface structure sensitivity does not prevent\ndeep structure comprehension. Rigorously evaluating LLMs' capability requires\nanalyzing both, yet deep structure is often overlooked. To this end, we assess\nLLMs' comprehension ability using causal mediation analysis, aiming to fully\ndiscover the capability of using both deep and surface structures.\nSpecifically, we formulate the comprehension of deep structure as direct causal\neffect (DCE) and that of surface structure as indirect causal effect (ICE),\nrespectively. To address the non-estimability of original DCE and ICE --\nstemming from the infeasibility of isolating mutual influences of deep and\nsurface structures, we develop the corresponding quantifiable surrogates,\nincluding approximated DCE (ADCE) and approximated ICE (AICE). We further apply\nthe ADCE to evaluate a series of mainstream LLMs, showing that most of them\nexhibit deep structure comprehension ability, which grows along with the\nprediction accuracy. Comparing ADCE and AICE demonstrates closed-source LLMs\nrely more on deep structure, while open-source LLMs are more surface-sensitive,\nwhich decreases with model scale. Theoretically, ADCE is a bidirectional\nevaluation, which measures both the sufficiency and necessity of deep structure\nchanges in causing output variations, thus offering a more comprehensive\nassessment than accuracy, a common evaluation in LLMs. Our work provides new\ninsights into LLMs' deep structure comprehension and offers novel methods for\nLLMs evaluation.",

Furthermore, DRNet\ndemonstrates robust generalization capabilities, even extending to various\nout-of-distribution scenarios. The dual streams within DRNet serve distinct\nfunctions by addressing local or spatial information.

The dynamical anisotropic\nensembles of the FASTSUM Collaboration are utilised to conduct a comprehensive\nanalysis at eight temperatures beyond the established chiral transition.\nVisualisations of the centre vortex structure in temporal and spatial slices of\nthe lattice reveal that vortex percolation persists through the chiral\ntransition and ceases at a temperature that is approximately twice the chiral\ntransition temperature $T_c$. This implies that confinement is retained through\ntemperatures up to $T \\approx 2\\,T_c$, pointing toward a second transition\ncorresponding to deconfinement. The loss of percolation is quantified by the\nvortex cluster extent, providing a clear signal for the deconfinement\ntransition. Additional vortex statistics, including temporal correlations,\nvortex and branching point densities, the number of secondary clusters and\nvortex chain lengths between branching points, are scrutinised as a function of\ntemperature. All ten measures investigated herein show the characteristics of\ntwo transitions in QCD, encompassing the chiral transition at $T_c$ and the\ndeconfinement transition at $T \\approx 2\\,T_c$. Performing an inflection point\nanalysis on the vortex and branching point densities produces an estimate of\n$T_c$ that agrees with the known FASTSUM value.

    "abstract": "Iterative retrieval refers to the process in which the model continuously\nqueries the retriever during generation to enhance the relevance of the\nretrieved knowledge, thereby improving the performance of Retrieval-Augmented\nGeneration (RAG). Existing work typically employs few-shot prompting or\nmanually constructed rules to implement iterative retrieval. This introduces\nadditional inference overhead and overlooks the remarkable reasoning\ncapabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). In this paper, we introduce\nAuto-RAG, an autonomous iterative retrieval model centered on the LLM's\npowerful decision-making capabilities. Auto-RAG engages in multi-turn dialogues\nwith the retriever, systematically planning retrievals and refining queries to\nacquire valuable knowledge. This process continues until sufficient external\ninformation is gathered, at which point the results are presented to the user.\nTo this end, we develop a method for autonomously synthesizing reasoning-based\ndecision-making instructions in iterative retrieval and fine-tuned the latest\nopen-source LLMs. The experimental results indicate that Auto-RAG is capable of\nautonomous iterative interaction with the retriever, effectively leveraging the\nremarkable reasoning and decision-making abilities of LLMs, which lead to\noutstanding performance across six benchmarks. Further analysis reveals that\nAuto-RAG can autonomously adjust the number of iterations based on the\ndifficulty of the questions and the utility of the retrieved knowledge, without\nrequiring any human intervention. Moreover, Auto-RAG expresses the iterative\nretrieval process in natural language, enhancing interpretability while\nproviding users with a more intuitive experience\\footnote{Code is available at\n\\url{https://github.com/ictnlp/Auto-RAG}.",

    "abstract": "In economic analysis, rational decision-makers often take actions to reduce\ntheir risk exposure. These actions include purchasing market insurance and\nimplementing prevention measures to modify the shape of the loss distribution.\nUnder the assumption that the insureds' actions are fully observed by the\ninsurer, this paper investigates the interaction between self-protection and\ninsurance demand when insurance premiums are determined by convex premium\nprinciples within the framework of distortion risk measures. Specifically, the\ninsured selects an optimal proportional insurance share and prevention effort\nto minimize the risk measure of their end-of-period exposure. We explicitly\ncharacterize the optimal combination of prevention effort and insurance demand\nin a self-protection model when the insured adopts tail value-at-risk or a\nsubclass with strictly concave distortion functions. Additionally, we conduct\ncomparative static analyses to illustrate our main findings under various\npremium structures, risk aversion levels, and loss distributions. Our results\nindicate that market insurance and self-protection are complementary,\nsupporting classical insights from the literature regarding corner insurance\npolicies (i.e., null and full insurance) in the absence of ex ante moral\nhazard. Finally, we consider the effects of moral hazard on the interaction\nbetween self-protection and insurance demand.

We aim to\nunderstand whether the more widespread lopsidedness at high- than low-redshift\ncan be associated to environmental mechanisms being more effective in producing\nlopsided perturbations at high-redshift.

We then characterize lopsidedness in the disks of galaxies at each\nredshift, study the relevant mechanisms generating lopsidedness, as well as the\ncorrelation between such perturbation, the local environment and the galaxy\ninternal properties as a function of redshift. Consistent with previous and new\nobservational results, we find that: 1) simulations predict a significant\nfraction (~60%) of lopsided galaxies at high-redshift ($1.5 < z < 2$), 2) the\nfraction of lopsided galaxies, as well as the lopsided amplitude, decreases\nfrom high- to low-redshift, and 3) there is not a significant dependence of\nlopsidedness on the local environment, but there is a strong correlation\nbetween the lopsided amplitude and basic galaxies' structural properties at all\nredshift between $0 < z < 2$.

    "abstract": "Technologies for manipulating single atoms and molecules have advanced\ndrastically in the past decades. Due to their excellent controllability of\ninternal states, atoms and molecules serves as one of the ideal platforms as\nquantum systems. One major research direction in atomic systems is the precise\ndetermination of energy differences between two energy levels in atoms. This\nfield, known as precision measurement, is symbolized by the remarkable\nfractional uncertainty of $10^{-18}$ or lower achieved in the state-of-the-art\natomic clocks. Two-level systems in atoms are sensitive to various external\nfields and can therefore be function as quantum sensors. The effect of these\nfields manifests as energy shifts in the two-level system. Traditionally, such\nshifts are induced by electric or magnetic fields, as recognized even before\nthe advent of the precision spectroscopy with lasers. However, with\nhigh-precision measurements, energy shifts can also be caused by hypothetical\nfields weakly coupled to ordinary matter, or by small effects mediated by\nmassive particles, which are conventionally dealt with in the field of nuclear\nand particle physics. In most cases, the atomic systems as quantum sensors have\nnot been sensitive enough to detect such effects. Instead, experiments\nsearching for these interactions have placed constraints on coupling constants,\nexcept in a few cases where effects are predicted by the Standard Model of\nparticle physics. Nonetheless, measurements and searches for these effects in\natomic systems have led to the emergence of a new field of physics. In some\ncases, they open new parameter spaces to explore in conventionally investigated\ntopics, e.g., dark matter, fifth force, CP-violation, and other physics beyond\nthe Standard Model.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, labor shortages due to the declining birthrate and aging\npopulation have become significant challenges at construction sites in\ndeveloped countries, including Japan. To address these challenges, we are\ndeveloping an open platform called ROS2-TMS for Construction, a Cyber-Physical\nSystem (CPS) for construction sites, to achieve both efficiency and safety in\nearthwork operations. In ROS2-TMS for Construction, the system comprehensively\ncollects and stores environmental information from sensors placed throughout\nthe construction site. Based on these data, a real-time virtual construction\nsite is created in cyberspace. Then, based on the state of construction\nmachinery and environmental conditions in cyberspace, the optimal next actions\nfor actual construction machinery are determined, and the construction\nmachinery is operated accordingly. In this project, we decided to use the Open\nPlatform for Earthwork with Robotics and Autonomy (OPERA), developed by the\nPublic Works Research Institute (PWRI) in Japan, to control construction\nmachinery from ROS2-TMS for Construction with an originally extended behavior\ntree. In this study, we present an overview of OPERA, focusing on the newly\ndeveloped navigation package for operating the crawler dump, as well as the\noverall structure of ROS2-TMS for Construction as a Cyber-Physical System\n(CPS). Additionally, we conducted experiments using a crawler dump and a\nbackhoe to verify the aforementioned functionalities.",

    "abstract": "Analytic bounds on the projection of the global attractor of 2D\nincompressible turbulence in the palinstrophy--enstrophy plane [Dascaliuc,\nFoias, and Jolly 2005, 2010] are observed to vastly overestimate the values\nobtained from numerical simulations. This is due to the lack of a good estimate\nfor the inner product $(\\cal{B}(u,u),A^2u)$ of the advection term and the\nbiLaplacian. Sobolev inequalities like Ladyzhenskaya or Agmon's inequalities\nyield an upper bound that we show is not sharp. In fact, for statistically\nisotropic turbulence, the expected value of $(\\cal{B}(u,u),A^2u)$ is zero. The\nimplications for estimates on the behaviour of the global attractor are\ndiscussed.",

    "abstract": "We introduce a novel method for solving density-based topology optimization\nproblems: Sigmoidal Mirror descent with a Projected Latent variable (SiMPL).\nThe SiMPL method (pronounced as ``the simple method'') optimizes a design using\nonly first-order derivative information of the objective function. The bound\nconstraints on the density field are enforced with the help of the (negative)\nFermi--Dirac entropy, which is also used to define a non-symmetric distance\nfunction called a Bregman divergence on the set of admissible designs. This\nBregman divergence leads to a simple update rule that is further simplified\nwith the help of a so-called latent variable. Because the SiMPL method involves\ndiscretizing the latent variable, it produces a sequence of pointwise-feasible\niterates, even when high-order finite elements are used in the discretization.\nNumerical experiments demonstrate that the method outperforms other popular\nfirst-order optimization algorithms. To outline the general applicability of\nthe technique, we include examples with (self-load) compliance minimization and\ncompliant mechanism optimization problems.",

    "abstract": "Precisely modeling radio propagation in complex environments has been a\nsignificant challenge, especially with the advent of 5G and beyond networks,\nwhere managing massive antenna arrays demands more detailed information.\nTraditional methods, such as empirical models and ray tracing, often fall\nshort, either due to insufficient details or because of challenges for\nreal-time applications. Inspired by the newly proposed 3D Gaussian Splatting\nmethod in the computer vision domain, which outperforms other methods in\nreconstructing optical radiance fields, we propose RF-3DGS, a novel approach\nthat enables precise site-specific reconstruction of radio radiance fields from\nsparse samples. RF-3DGS can render radio spatial spectra at arbitrary positions\nwithin 2 ms following a brief 3-minute training period, effectively identifying\ndominant propagation paths. Furthermore, RF-3DGS can provide fine-grained\nSpatial Channel State Information (Spatial-CSI) of these paths, including the\nchannel gain, the delay, the angle of arrival (AoA), and the angle of departure\n(AoD). Our experiments, calibrated through real-world measurements, demonstrate\nthat RF-3DGS not only significantly improves reconstruction quality, training\nefficiency, and rendering speed compared to state-of-the-art methods, but also\nholds great potential for supporting wireless communication and advanced\napplications such as Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC).
