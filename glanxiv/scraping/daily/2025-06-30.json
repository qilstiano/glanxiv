    "abstract": "Time series forecasting models have diverse real world applications (e.g.,\nfrom electricity metrics to software workload). Latest foundational models\ntrained for time series forecasting show strengths (e.g., for long sequences\nand in zero-shot settings). However, foundational model was not yet used for\nforecasting rare, spiky events, i.e., a challenging target because those are a\ncorner case of extreme events. In this paper, we optimize a state-of-the-art\nfoundational model to forecast sporadic or spiky production outages of\nhigh-performance machine learning services powering billions of client devices.\nWe evaluate the forecasting errors of the foundational model compared with\nclassical stochastic forecasting models (e.g., moving average and\nautoregressive). The analysis helps us understand how each of the evaluated\nmodels performs for the sporadic or spiky events. For example, it identifies\nthe key patterns in the target data that are well tracked by the foundational\nmodel vs. each of the stochastic models. We use the models with optimal\nparameters to estimate a year-long outage statistics of a particular root cause\nwith less than 6% value errors.",

However, its fixed low-rank structure restricts\nits adaptability in scenarios with substantial domain gaps, where higher ranks\nare often required to capture domain-specific complexities. Current adaptive\nLoRA methods attempt to overcome this limitation by dynamically expanding or\nselectively allocating ranks, but these approaches frequently depend on\ncomputationally intensive techniques such as iterative pruning, rank searches,\nor additional regularization. To address these challenges, we introduce Stable\nRank-Guided Low-Rank Adaptation (SR-LoRA), a novel framework that utilizes the\nstable rank of pre-trained weight matrices as a natural prior for layer-wise\nrank allocation. By leveraging the stable rank, which reflects the intrinsic\ndimensionality of the weights, SR-LoRA enables a principled and efficient\nredistribution of ranks across layers, enhancing adaptability without incurring\nadditional search costs. Empirical evaluations on few-shot tasks with\nsignificant domain gaps show that SR-LoRA consistently outperforms recent\nadaptive LoRA variants, achieving a superior trade-off between performance and\nefficiency.

In this study, we investigate the underlying mechanisms behind the\npersistence of these errors across LMs of varying sizes (124M-7B) to both\nunderstand and mitigate the errors. Our study reveals that LMs rely on a number\nof components (attention heads and FF neurons) that independently make their\nown predictions. While some components reliably promote correct answers across\na generalized range of inputs (i.e., implementing \"sound mechanisms''), others\nare less reliable and introduce noise by promoting incorrect tokens (i.e.,\nimplementing \"faulty mechanisms''). Errors occur when the faulty mechanisms\novershadow the sound ones and dominantly affect the predictions. Motivated by\nthis insight, we introduce RASteer, a steering method to systematically\nidentify and increase the contribution of reliable components for improving\nmodel performance. RASteer substantially improves performance on balanced\nparentheses tasks, boosting accuracy of some models from $0$% to around $100$%\nwithout impairing the models' general coding ability.

    "abstract": "The Tamm-Dancoff Approximation (TDA) offers a computationally efficient\nalternative to full linear-response Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory\n(TDDFT) for calculating electronic excited states, particularly in large\nmolecular systems. By neglecting the coupling between excitation and\nde-excitation channels, TDA simplifies the TDDFT response equations into a\nHermitian form. This not only reduces computational cost but also eliminates\nnumerical instabilities that can arise in the full non-Hermitian formalism.\nWhile TDA has been widely explored for valence excitations, its reliability for\ntransition metal complexes and core-level spectroscopies remains largely\nuntested. In this work, we address this gap by systematically comparing TDA and\nfull TDDFT results for a series of transition metal species, focusing on\nabsorption spectra across the UV-Vis, metal K-edges, and L-edges. Our results\nshow that, for core-level excitations, TDA yields excitation energies and\noscillator strengths nearly indistinguishable from those obtained with full\nTDDFT. This agreement is attributed to the negligible contribution of\nde-excitation amplitudes at high excitation energies, indicating that the\nomitted coupling terms play an insignificant role in these spectral regimes.\nThese findings validate the accuracy and robustness of TDA in core-level\nspectra simulations and support its broader application in studies involving\ntransition metal systems.",

Most recent\nworks in ASD explore the use of large language models (LLMs) in goal-driven\nsettings, relying on human-specified research questions to guide hypothesis\ngeneration. However, scientific discovery may be accelerated further by\nallowing the AI system to drive exploration by its own criteria. The few\nexisting approaches in open-ended ASD select hypotheses based on diversity\nheuristics or subjective proxies for human interestingness, but the former\nstruggles to meaningfully navigate the typically vast hypothesis space, and the\nlatter suffers from imprecise definitions. This paper presents AutoDS -- a\nmethod for open-ended ASD that instead drives scientific exploration using\nBayesian surprise. Here, we quantify the epistemic shift from the LLM's prior\nbeliefs about a hypothesis to its posterior beliefs after gathering\nexperimental results. To efficiently explore the space of nested hypotheses,\nour method employs a Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) strategy with progressive\nwidening using surprisal as the reward function. We evaluate AutoDS in the\nsetting of data-driven discovery across 21 real-world datasets spanning domains\nsuch as biology, economics, finance, and behavioral science. Our results\ndemonstrate that under a fixed budget, AutoDS substantially outperforms\ncompetitors by producing 5--29\\% more discoveries deemed surprising by the LLM.\nOur human evaluation further finds that two-thirds of AutoDS discoveries are\nsurprising to the domain experts, suggesting this is an important step forward\ntowards building open-ended ASD systems.",

Developing universally applicable OD\nestimation methodologies is significantly challenged by the pervasive scarcity\nof high-fidelity traffic data and the difficulty in obtaining city-specific\nprior OD estimates (or seed ODs), which are often prerequisite for traditional\napproaches. Our proposed method directly estimates OD travel demand by\nsystematically leveraging aggregated, anonymized statistics from Google Maps\nTraffic Trends, obviating the need for conventional census or city-provided OD\ndata. The OD demand is estimated by formulating a single-level,\none-dimensional, continuous nonlinear optimization problem with nonlinear\nequality and bound constraints to replicate highway path travel times. The\nmethod achieves efficiency and scalability by employing a differentiable\nanalytical macroscopic network model. This model by design is computationally\nlightweight, distinguished by its parsimonious parameterization that requires\nminimal calibration effort and its capacity for instantaneous evaluation. These\nattributes ensure the method's broad applicability and practical utility across\ndiverse cities globally. Using segment sensor counts from Los Angeles and San\nDiego highway networks, we validate our proposed approach, demonstrating a\ntwo-thirds to three-quarters improvement in the fit to segment count data over\na baseline. Beyond validation, we establish the method's scalability and robust\nperformance in replicating path travel times across diverse highway networks,\nincluding Seattle, Orlando, Denver, Philadelphia, and Boston.

    "abstract": "Achieving high NV center conversion efficiency remains a key challenge in\nadvancing diamond-based quantum technologies. The generally accepted mechanism\nfor NV formation is that irradiation-induced vacancies become mobile during\nannealing and are trapped by substitutional nitrogen. However, the suggested\nmechanism does not consider the presence and role of hydrogen in the diamond\nand its influence on the NV formation pathway. This is despite ab-initio\ncalculations, which strongly suggest the formation of hydrogen-passivated NV\ncenters during CVD diamond growth. Recent experimental observations showing a\nstrong spatial correlation between NV centers, brown coloration, and the 468 nm\nluminescence center in as-grown CVD diamonds prompted us to investigate the\natomistic origin of these phenomena in the presence of NxVHy-type complex\ndefects. We used hybrid density functional theory DFT calculations and\nspectroscopic analysis of CVD diamonds grown with varying nitrogen content to\ninvestigate defect equilibria during growth. We identified the 468 nm center as\nthe NVH- defect, a hydrogen-passivated NV center, and assigned the\ncharacteristic UV-VIS absorption bands at 270 360 and 520 nm to NxVHy\ncomplexes. Our findings reveal that hydrogen plays a central role in\nstabilizing these defects during growth. We further showed that NVHx complex\ndefects dissociate into NV centers and interstitial hydrogen during post-growth\nirradiation and annealing, complementing vacancy trapping by substitutional\nnitrogen. These results provide a unified picture of the defect chemistry\nunderlying brown coloration, 468 nm center, and NV formation in CVD diamonds,\noffering new insights for optimizing diamond synthesis and processing for\nquantum applications by taking advantage of hydrogens role and dissociation of\nNVHx complexes.",

While prior research\nhas studied various aspects of TikTok's regular mode, including privacy and\npersonalization, TikTok's Kids Mode remains understudied, and there is a lack\nof transparency regarding its content curation and its safety and privacy\nprotections for children. In this paper, (i) we propose an auditing methodology\nto comprehensively investigate TikTok's Kids Mode and (ii) we apply it to\ncharacterize the platform's content curation and determine the prevalence of\nchild-directed content, based on regulations in the Children's Online Privacy\nProtection Act (COPPA).

The platform also lacks critical features, namely parental\ncontrols and accessibility settings. Our findings have important design and\nregulatory implications, as children may be incentivized to use TikTok's\nregular mode instead of Kids Mode, where they are known to be exposed to\nfurther safety and privacy risks.",

In this dissertation, we focus on\nlanguages spoken in Sub-Saharan Africa where all the indigenous languages in\nthis region can be regarded as low-resourced in terms of the availability of\nlabelled data for NLP tasks and unlabelled data found on the web. We analyse\nthe noise in the publicly available corpora, and curate a high-quality corpus,\ndemonstrating that the quality of semantic representations learned in word\nembeddings does not only depend on the amount of data but on the quality of\npre-training data. We demonstrate empirically the limitations of word\nembeddings, and the opportunities the multilingual pre-trained language model\n(PLM) offers especially for languages unseen during pre-training and\nlow-resource scenarios. We further study how to adapt and specialize\nmultilingual PLMs to unseen African languages using a small amount of\nmonolingual texts. To address the under-representation of the African languages\nin NLP research, we developed large scale human-annotated labelled datasets for\n21 African languages in two impactful NLP tasks: named entity recognition and\nmachine translation.

Our analysis extends across the\nrange from quantum-pressure-dominated to self-interaction-dominated\nstabilisation of the gravitationally bound solitonic core. Within this examined\nrange of self-coupling strengths, we find that mergers with a given initial\nspatial configuration and an increasing self-interaction strength $g$, result\nin cores with increased size that exhibit a reduced central density and\noscillate with decreased frequency. All of these features are in accordance\nwith expectations from the study of isolated Self-interacting Fuzzy Dark Matter\n(SFDM) solitons. The characteristic size of the granules in the surrounding\nhalo also grows but by a much smaller amount relative to the core; accordingly,\ntypical inter-vortex distances are also only mildly affected. We also measure\nthe total length of the vortex network which, although less robust, shows no\nclear dependence on increasing $g$ and no signs of decay over the timescales of\nour simulations. Measures of coherence of the field behave as in the\nnon-interacting case, again clearly separating the coherent core form the\nquasi-coherent halo.

    "abstract": "Digital pathology has revolutionized the field by enabling the digitization\nof tissue samples into whole slide images (WSIs). However, the high resolution\nand large size of WSIs present significant challenges when it comes to applying\nDeep Learning models. As a solution, WSIs are often divided into smaller\npatches with a global label (\\textit{i.e., diagnostic}) per slide, instead of a\n(too) costly pixel-wise annotation. By treating each slide as a bag of patches,\nMultiple Instance Learning (MIL) methods have emerged as a suitable solution\nfor WSI classification. A major drawback of MIL methods is their high\nvariability in performance across different runs, which can reach up to 10-15\nAUC points on the test set, making it difficult to compare different MIL\nmethods reliably. This variability mainly comes from three factors: i) weight\ninitialization, ii) batch (shuffling) ordering, iii) and learning rate. To\naddress that, we introduce a Multi-Fidelity, Model Fusion strategy for MIL\nmethods. We first train multiple models for a few epochs and average the most\nstable and promising ones based on validation scores. This approach can be\napplied to any existing MIL model to reduce performance variability. It also\nsimplifies hyperparameter tuning and improves reproducibility while maintaining\ncomputational efficiency. We extensively validate our approach on WSI\nclassification tasks using 2 different datasets, 3 initialization strategies\nand 5 MIL methods, for a total of more than 2000 experiments.",

Extending the conventionally used isotropic spin model for\nXCuCl$_{3}$, our analysis includes all the symmetry-allowed anisotropies and\ngives a detailed account of the role they play in the band topology of\ntriplets. We show that the triplet line nodes carry nontrivial Berry phases and\ncompute their $Z_2$ topological indices. To investigate the effect of breaking\nthe nonsymmorphic symmetry protecting the triplet nodes, we apply a magnetic\nfield tilted away from the high symmetry $(010)$ axis. We find that while the\ng-tensor anisotropy behaves as a trivial mass gapping out the triplets,\nexchange anisotropies supply a nontrivial momentum-dependent mass term.\nAnalogous to Haldane's original model, the competition of these mass terms\ndetermines the nature of the band topology in XCuCl$_{3}$. To enable an\nanalytic study of the band topology we derive an effective Dirac Hamiltonian\nand validate it by computing the band structure and topological indices in the\nnodal line and gapped phases from the linear bond-wave formalism.",

Our model shows\na remarkable performance when compared with the Sherwood hydrodynamic\nsimulations: it reproduces the flux distribution, the Ly-$\\alpha$ - dark matter\nhalo cross-correlations, and the count-in-cell statistics at the percent level\ndown to scales of a few Mpc. Our work provides crucial tools that bridge\nanalytic modeling on large scales with simulations on small-scales, enabling\nfield-level inference from Ly-$\\alpha$ forest data and simulation-based priors\nfor cosmological analyses.

Each spectrum was analyzed to infer the\nFalse Alarm Probability of signal detection, and the longitudinal magnetic\nfield was measured. This process yielded persistent detection of magnetic\nfields in all four stars. The median $1\\sigma$ longitudinal field uncertainty\nof the Zeeman detections was 0.6~G. The maximum unsigned longitudinal magnetic\nfields measured from the detections are rather weak, ranging from $0.34\\pm\n0.19$ G for $\\alpha$ Lep to $2.61\\pm 0.55$ G for 13 Mon. The Zeeman signatures\nshow different levels of complexity; those of the two hotter stars are\nrelatively simple, while those of the two cooler stars are more complex.

In this work, we introduce EMSpice 2.1, an\nenhanced tool built upon the existing coupled IR-EM analysis framework, EMSpice\n2.0, for EM-aware IR drop analysis. For the first time, EMSpice 2.1 uniquely\nintegrates Joule heating effects and practical thermal maps derived from actual\nchip conditions. Additionally, it features improved interoperability with\ncommercial EDA tools, facilitating more comprehensive EM and IR drop sign-off\nanalysis. Our findings demonstrate that specific hotspot patterns significantly\nimpact the lifetime of interconnects and overall chip reliability due to EM\nfailures. Furthermore, our tool exhibits strong agreement with\nindustry-standard tools such as COMSOL, achieving a speedup of over 200 times\nwhile maintaining high accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Current sparse autoencoder (SAE) approaches to neural network\ninterpretability assume that activations can be decomposed through linear\nsuperposition into sparse, interpretable features. Despite high reconstruction\nfidelity, SAEs consistently fail to eliminate polysemanticity and exhibit\npathological behavioral errors. We propose that neural networks encode\ninformation in two complementary spaces compressed into the same substrate:\nfeature identity and feature integration. To test this dual encoding\nhypothesis, we develop sequential and joint-training architectures to capture\nidentity and integration patterns simultaneously. Joint training achieves 41.3%\nreconstruction improvement and 51.6% reduction in KL divergence errors. This\narchitecture spontaneously develops bimodal feature organization: low squared\nnorm features contributing to integration pathways and the rest contributing\ndirectly to the residual. Small nonlinear components (3% of parameters) achieve\n16.5% standalone improvements, demonstrating parameter-efficient capture of\ncomputational relationships crucial for behavior. Additionally, intervention\nexperiments using 2x2 factorial stimulus designs demonstrated that integration\nfeatures exhibit selective sensitivity to experimental manipulations and\nproduce systematic behavioral effects on model outputs, including significant\ninteraction effects across semantic dimensions. This work provides systematic\nevidence for (1) dual encoding in neural representations, (2) meaningful\nnonlinearly encoded feature interactions, and (3) introduces an architectural\nparadigm shift from post-hoc feature analysis to integrated computational\ndesign, establishing foundations for next-generation SAEs.",

In\nreal-world applications, such as robotics, mechatronics, and communication\nnetworks, execution mismatches arising from system dynamics, hardware\nconstraints, and latency can significantly degrade performance. This work\nadvances AI by developing a novel control-optimized DRL framework that\nexplicitly models and compensates for action execution mismatches, a challenge\nlargely overlooked in existing methods. Our approach establishes a structured\ntwo-stage process: determining the desired action and selecting the appropriate\ncontrol signal to ensure proper execution. It trains the agent while accounting\nfor action mismatches and controller corrections. By incorporating these\nfactors into the training process, the AI agent optimizes the desired action\nwith respect to both the actual control signal and the intended outcome,\nexplicitly considering execution errors. This approach enhances robustness,\nensuring that decision-making remains effective under real-world uncertainties.\nOur approach offers a substantial advancement for engineering practice by\nbridging the gap between idealized learning and real-world implementation.

We examined feedforward neural networks (FFNs), bidirectional encoder\nrepresentations from transformers (BERT), and generative pre-trained\ntransformers (GPT) across 18 conditions in matching-to-sample (MTS)\nsimulations. Conditions varied in training structure (linear series,\none-to-many, and many-to-one), relation type (select-only, reject-only, and\nselect-reject), and negative comparison selection (standard and biased). A\nprobabilistic agent served as a benchmark, embodying purely associative\nlearning. The primary goal was to determine whether artificial neural networks\ncould demonstrate equivalence class formation or whether their performance\nreflected associative learning. Results showed that reject relations influenced\nagent performance. While some agents achieved high accuracy on equivalence\ntests, particularly with reject relations and biased negative comparisons, this\nperformance was comparable to the probabilistic agent. These findings suggest\nthat artificial neural networks, including transformer models, may rely on\nassociative strategies rather than SE.

Our findings reveal that the\nstandalone LLM introduces nearly 9x more new vulnerabilities than developers,\nwith many of these exhibiting unique patterns not found in developers' code.\nAgentic workflows also generate a significant number of vulnerabilities,\nparticularly when granting LLMs more autonomy, potentially increasing the\nlikelihood of misinterpreting project context or task requirements.

DFI transforms correlated features into\nindependent latent variables using a transport map, eliminating correlation\ndistortion. Importance is computed in this disentangled space and attributed\nback through the transport map's sensitivity. DFI provides a principled\ndecomposition of importance scores that sum to the total predictive variability\nfor latent additive models and to interaction-weighted functional ANOVA\nvariances more generally, under arbitrary feature dependencies.\n  We develop a comprehensive semiparametric theory for DFI. For general\ntransport maps, we establish root-$n$ consistency and asymptotic normality of\nimportance estimators in the latent space, which extends to the original\nfeature space for the Bures-Wasserstein map. Notably, our estimators achieve\nsecond-order estimation error, which vanishes if both regression function and\ntransport map estimation errors are $o_{\\mathbb{P}}(n^{-1/4})$.

As research moves toward deploying RL in real-world applications,\nthe field faces a new set of challenges inherent to real-world settings, such\nas large state-action spaces, non-stationarity, and partial observability.\nDespite their importance, these challenges are often underexplored in current\nbenchmarks, which tend to focus on idealized, fully observable, and stationary\nenvironments, often neglecting to incorporate real-world complexities\nexplicitly. In this paper, we introduce \\texttt{Gym4ReaL}, a comprehensive\nsuite of realistic environments designed to support the development and\nevaluation of RL algorithms that can operate in real-world scenarios. The suite\nincludes a diverse set of tasks that expose algorithms to a variety of\npractical challenges. Our experimental results show that, in these settings,\nstandard RL algorithms confirm their competitiveness against rule-based\nbenchmarks, motivating the development of new methods to fully exploit the\npotential of RL to tackle the complexities of real-world tasks.",

This generalizes many previously known results on\nspecial classes of graphs including interval graphs, permutation graphs, and\ngraphs of bounded boxicity, but also new classes such as intersection graphs of\nL-shapes in the plane.

These assays have become model systems of\nactive matter dynamics, as they spontaneously organize into diverse dynamical\nstates, including collective motions with chiral rotation. However, the\nmicroscopic mechanisms underlying these chiral collective dynamics have\nremained unclear. Here, we investigate rotating active nematic order in\nmicrotubule gliding assay experiments under two stabilization conditions, each\non two types of substrates.

Using Brownian dynamics simulations of self-propelled, semiflexible\nfilaments with chiral activity, we demonstrate that coherently rotating active\nnematic order emerges by this mechanism even in the absence of curvature, i.e.\nshape chirality, of the constituent filaments. Moreover, we predict that the\nangular speed and handedness of the collective rotation can be tuned by\nmodulating filament stiffness.

    "abstract": "This paper studies a power transmission system with both conventional\ngenerators (CGs) and distributed energy assets (DEAs) providing frequency\ncontrol. We consider an operating condition with demand aggregating two dynamic\ncomponents: one that switches between different values on a finite set, and one\nthat varies smoothly over time. Such dynamic operating conditions may result\nfrom protection scheme activations, external cyber-attacks, or due to the\nintegration of dynamic loads, such as data centers. Mathematically, the\ndynamics of the resulting system are captured by a system that switches between\na finite number of vector fields -- or modes--, with each mode having a\ndistinct equilibrium point induced by the demand aggregation. To analyze the\nstability properties of the resulting switching system, we leverage tools from\nhybrid dynamic inclusions and the concept of $\\Omega$-limit sets from sets.\nSpecifically, we characterize a compact set that is semi-globally practically\nasymptotically stable under the assumption that the switching frequency and\nload variation rate are sufficiently slow. For arbitrarily fast variations of\nthe load, we use a level-set argument with multiple Lyapunov functions to\nestablish input-to-state stability of a larger set and with respect to the rate\nof change of the loads. The theoretical results are illustrated via numerical\nsimulations on the IEEE 39-bus test system.",

    "abstract": "Most commonly used language models (LMs) are instruction-tuned and aligned\nusing a combination of fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, causing them to\nrefuse users requests deemed harmful by the model. However, jailbreak prompts\ncan often bypass these refusal mechanisms and elicit harmful responses. In this\nwork, we study the extent to which information accessed via jailbreak prompts\nis decodable using linear probes trained on LM hidden states. We show that a\ngreat deal of initially refused information is linearly decodable. For example,\nacross models, the response of a jailbroken LM for the average IQ of a country\ncan be predicted by a linear probe with Pearson correlations exceeding $0.8$.\nSurprisingly, we find that probes trained on base models (which do not refuse)\nsometimes transfer to their instruction-tuned versions and are capable of\nrevealing information that jailbreaks decode generatively, suggesting that the\ninternal representations of many refused properties persist from base LMs\nthrough instruction-tuning. Importantly, we show that this information is not\nmerely \"leftover\" in instruction-tuned models, but is actively used by them: we\nfind that probe-predicted values correlate with LM generated pairwise\ncomparisons, indicating that the information decoded by our probes align with\nsuppressed generative behavior that may be expressed more subtly in other\ndownstream tasks. Overall, our results suggest that instruction-tuning does not\nwholly eliminate or even relocate harmful information in representation\nspace-they merely suppress its direct expression, leaving it both linearly\naccessible and indirectly influential in downstream behavior.",

Triad relationships are\nclassically either balanced or imbalanced. However, real-world relationships\noften exhibit uncertainty, complexity, and interconnected dynamics that\ntranscend this classical framework, and we will sometimes see the synchronicity\nof balance and imbalance states. When these triadics are simultaneously\nbalanced and imbalanced, they form superposition and entanglement states that\nnecessitate the introduction of quantum balance. This study introduces a\nframework that extends classical Heider balance theory from social network\nanalysis by incorporating principles of quantum mechanics. In the framework,\neach triad is a quantum state of spin systems embedded in various network\ntopologies. Using a quantum transformation operator, we investigate the\nemergence of balanced and imbalanced states and identify ground and steady\nstates. In the quantum state, developments towards balance will occur by\nintroducing the Hamiltonian within the creation and annihilation operators\nframework. In these developments, we witness the emergence of superposition and\nentanglement quantum states with no classical equivalent, which form an\nuncertainty in the states. When the quantum evolution is a functional\ntemperature, we investigate the emergence of balanced and imbalanced states,\nanalyze ground and steady states, and examine phase transitions as a function\nof temperature.

Given a set of\nrequests for deploying virtualized applications, the edge provider has to\ndeploy a maximum number of them to the underlying physical network, subject to\ncapacity constraints. This challenge is known as the virtual network embedding\n(VNE) problem: it models applications as virtual networks, where virtual nodes\nrepresent functions and virtual links represent communication between the\nvirtual nodes.\n  All variants of VNE are known to be strongly NP-hard. Because of its\ncentrality to network virtualization, VNE has been extensively studied. We\nfocus on the online variant of VNE, in which deployment requests are not known\nin advance. This reflects the highly skewed and unpredictable demand intrinsic\nto the edge. Unfortunately, existing solutions to online VNE do not scale well\nwith the number of requests per second and the physical topology size.\n  We propose a novel approach in which our new online algorithm, OLIVE,\nleverages a nearly optimal embedding for an aggregated expected demand. This\nembedding is computed offline. It serves as a plan that OLIVE uses as a guide\nfor handling actual individual requests while dynamically compensating for\ndeviations from the plan.

However, existing sim2real\ntransfer methods struggle to address the autonomy-oriented requirements of\nbalancing: (i) conditioned domain adaptation, (ii) robust performance with\nlimited examples, (iii) modularity in handling multiple domain representations,\nand (iv) real-time performance. To alleviate these pain points, we present a\nunified framework for learning cross-domain adaptive representations through\nconditional latent diffusion for sim2real transferable autonomous driving\nalgorithms.

We systematically analyze the presented framework\nand report our findings in terms of performance benchmarks and ablation\nstudies, with critical quantitative metrics as well as insightful qualitative\nexamples and remarks.

The set of vertices V(G) is partitioned\nas V_1, V_2, ... ,V_c, where all vertices in V_j share the same color j.

The Minimum Selective Subset (MSS) problem seeks to\nfind a selective subset of minimum size. The problem was first introduced by\nWilfong in 1991 for a set of points in the Euclidean plane, where two major\nproblems, MCS (Minimum Consistent Subset) and MSS, were proposed.\n  In graph algorithms, the only known result is that the MSS problem is\nNP-complete, as shown in 2018. Beyond this, no further progress has been made\nto date. In contrast, the MCS problem has been widely studied in various graph\nclasses over the years. Therefore, in this work, we also extend the algorithmic\nstudy of MSS on various graph classes. We first present a log(n)-approximation\nalgorithm for general graphs with n vertices and regardless of the number of\ncolors.

    "abstract": "Future space observatories that seek to perform imaging and spectroscopy of\nfaint astronomical sources will require ultra-low-noise detectors that are\nsensitive over a broad wavelength range. Silicon charge-coupled devices (CCDs),\nsuch as EMCCDs, skipper CCDs, multi-amplifier sensing (MAS) CCDs, and\nsingle-electron sensitive read out (SiSeRO) CCDs have demonstrated the ability\nto detect and measure single photons from X-ray energies to near the silicon\nband gap (~1.1 $\\mu$m), making them candidate technologies for this\napplication. In this context, we study a relatively unexplored source of\nlow-energy background coming from Cherenkov radiation produced by energetic\ncosmic rays traversing a silicon detector. We present a model for Cherenkov\nphoton production and absorption that is calibrated to laboratory data, and we\nuse this model to characterize the residual background rate for ultra-low-noise\nsilicon detectors in space. We study how the Cherenkov background rate depends\non detector thickness, variations in solar activity, and the contribution of\nheavy cosmic ray species (Z > 2). We find that for thick silicon detectors,\nsuch as those required to achieve high quantum efficiency at long wavelengths,\nthe rate of cosmic-ray-induced Cherenkov photon production is comparable to\nother detector and astrophysical backgrounds. We apply our Cherenkov background\nmodel to simulated spectroscopic observations of extra-solar planets, and we\nfind that thick detectors continue to outperform their thinner counterparts at\nlonger wavelengths despite a larger Cherenkov background rate. Furthermore, we\nfind that minimal masking of cosmic-ray tracks continues to maximize the\nsignal-to-noise of very faint sources despite the existence of extended halos\nof Cherenkov photons.",

However, during collaborative tasks, existing\nsystems often lack the ability to accurately capture real-world interactions\nbetween students and physical objects. This issue could be addressed with\nautomatic 6D pose estimation, i.e., estimation of an object's position and\norientation in 3D space from RGB images or videos. For collaborative groups\nthat interact with physical objects, 6D pose estimates allow AI systems to\nrelate objects and entities. As part of this work, we introduce FiboSB, a novel\nand challenging 6D pose video dataset featuring groups of three participants\nsolving an interactive task featuring small hand-held cubes and a weight scale.\nThis setup poses unique challenges for 6D pose because groups are holistically\nrecorded from a distance in order to capture all participants -- this, coupled\nwith the small size of the cubes, makes 6D pose estimation inherently\nnon-trivial. We evaluated four state-of-the-art 6D pose estimation methods on\nFiboSB, exposing the limitations of current algorithms on collaborative group\nwork. An error analysis of these methods reveals that the 6D pose methods'\nobject detection modules fail. We address this by fine-tuning YOLO11-x for\nFiboSB, achieving an overall mAP_50 of 0.898. The dataset, benchmark results,\nand analysis of YOLO11-x errors presented here lay the groundwork for\nleveraging the estimation of 6D poses in difficult collaborative contexts.",

However, at low magnetic\nfields, such as that on Earth (~50 {\\mu}T), diamond magnetometers suffer from\nspectral congestion whereby ODMR peaks are not easily resolved. Here, we\nexperimentally investigate a potential solution of using an isotropic,\nthree-dimensional magnetic flux concentrator to amplify Earth's field without\naltering its direction. The concentrator consists of six ferrite cones, in a\nface-centered cubic arrangement, centered about a diamond. We vary the\ndirection of a 50 {\\mu}T applied field and record and fit the resulting ODMR\nspectra. By comparing the fitted fields to those of a reference fluxgate\nmagnetometer, we characterize the angular response of the diamond magnetometer\nand quantify absolute errors in the field magnitude and angle. We find that the\nenhancement factor is nearly isotropic, with a mean of 19.05 and a standard\ndeviation of 0.16, when weighted by solid angle coverage. Gradient broadening\nof the ODMR lines is sufficiently small that the spectra are well resolved for\nnearly all field directions, alleviating spectral congestion.

    "abstract": "While large language models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in web\nnavigation tasks, the extensive context of web pages, often represented as DOM\nor Accessibility Tree (AxTree) structures, frequently exceeds model context\nlimits. Current approaches like bottom-up truncation or embedding-based\nretrieval lose critical information about page state and action history. This\nis particularly problematic for adaptive planning in web agents, where\nunderstanding the current state is essential for determining future actions. We\nhypothesize that embedding models lack sufficient capacity to capture\nplan-relevant information, especially when retrieving content that supports\nfuture action prediction. This raises a fundamental question: how can retrieval\nmethods be optimized for adaptive planning in web navigation tasks? In\nresponse, we introduce \\textit{LineRetriever}, a novel approach that leverages\na language model to identify and retrieve observation lines most relevant to\nfuture navigation steps. Unlike traditional retrieval methods that focus solely\non semantic similarity, \\textit{LineRetriever} explicitly considers the\nplanning horizon, prioritizing elements that contribute to action prediction.\nOur experiments demonstrate that \\textit{LineRetriever} can reduce the size of\nthe observation at each step for the web agent while maintaining consistent\nperformance within the context limitations.",

    "abstract": "Evaporating multicomponent droplets are ubiquitous and appear in a variety of\neveryday situations and technological applications, including coating, 3D\nprinting, and energy conversion processes. During evaporation, concentration\ngradients are typically induced, resulting in flows within the droplets. Many\nof the mechanisms underlying multicomponent droplet evaporation are not fully\nunderstood. However, most methods utilize markers that can be surface active\nand thus affect droplet dynamics. Thus, high-resolution marker-free\nmeasurements of concentration gradients in evaporating multicomponent droplets\nare needed. Raman microscopy can provide such a method. However, as the Raman\nlaser has to undergo a phase transition, it is refracted, leading to a\ndistorted drop contour. In this study, we model refraction in the droplet to\nbetter understand the shift in focus leading to geometric distortion. The\nhorizontal and vertical shifts in focus are analyzed, and a modified\nconfiguration that enables Raman measurements with a horizontal laser is\nintroduced. For both configurations, the simulated drop shape in the Raman\nimage fits well with the measured shape. While Raman measurements with a\nvertically incident laser allow the study of the upper part of the droplet, for\ndroplets with large contact angles, horizontal Raman measurements allow for the\nanalysis of the region around the 3-phase contact line. As an example, a\nconcentration map of an evaporating 4.2 $\\mu$L glycerol/water droplet is\npresented. The results of this study can be used as a guide for Raman\nmicroscopy measurements of droplets. These findings contribute to understanding\ndroplet dynamics during evaporation and provide a basis for developing novel\nprinting, cleaning, and energy conversion technology applications.",

This research employed a content analysis method\nto identify relevant articles and news from sources such as Google Scholar, the\nSummon database of North Carolina State University, and the scholarly news\nportal NexisUni. The selected papers, news articles, and reports provide a\ncomprehensive overview of the fashion, textile, and apparel supply chain\ndisruptions caused by the pandemic and the war in Ukraine, accompanied by\ndiscussions from common supply chain perspectives. Disruptions due to COVID-19\ninclude international brands and retailers canceling orders, closures of stores\nand factories in developing countries, layoffs, and furloughs of workers in\nboth retail stores and supplier factories, the increased prominence of online\nand e-commerce businesses, the growing importance of automation and\ndigitalization in the fashion supply chain, considerations of sustainability,\nand the need for a resilient supply chain system to facilitate post-pandemic\nrecovery. In the case of the Russo-Ukraine war, Israel-Palestine war, and\nIndo-Pak war, the second-order effects of the conflict have had a more\nsignificant impact on the textile supply chain than the direct military\noperations themselves.

    "abstract": "In the medical domain, acquiring large datasets is challenging due to both\naccessibility issues and stringent privacy regulations. Consequently, data\navailability and privacy protection are major obstacles to applying machine\nlearning in medical imaging. To address this, our study proposes the Med-LSDM\n(Latent Semantic Diffusion Model), which operates directly in the 3D domain and\nleverages de-identified semantic maps to generate synthetic data as a method of\nprivacy preservation and data augmentation. Unlike many existing methods that\nfocus on generating 2D slices, Med-LSDM is designed specifically for 3D\nsemantic image synthesis, making it well-suited for applications requiring full\nvolumetric data. Med-LSDM incorporates a guiding mechanism that controls the 3D\nimage generation process by applying a diffusion model within the latent space\nof a pre-trained VQ-GAN. By operating in the compressed latent space, the model\nsignificantly reduces computational complexity while still preserving critical\n3D spatial details. Our approach demonstrates strong performance in 3D semantic\nmedical image synthesis, achieving a 3D-FID score of 0.0054 on the conditional\nDuke Breast dataset and similar Dice scores (0.70964) to those of real images\n(0.71496).

This paper focuses on\nrecovering generic orbits of functions on ${\\mathbb R}^{n}$ and the sphere\n$S^{n-1}$ under the rotation action of $SO(n)$. Specifically, we demonstrate\nthat invariants of degree three (called the bispectrum) suffice to recover\ngeneric orbits of functions in finite-dimensional approximations of\n$L^2({\\mathbb R}^n)$ obtained by band-limiting the spherical component and\ndiscretizing the radial direction.

From an application perspective, the most\nimportant case is $SO(3)$, which arises in many scientific fields, and in\nparticular, plays a central role in leading structural biology applications\nsuch as cryo-electron tomography and cryo-electron microscopy. Our result for\n$SO(3)$ states that considering three spherical shells (i.e., samples in the\nradial direction) is sufficient to recover generic orbits, which verifies an\nimplicit conjecture made in a paper of Bandeira et al.

For this purpose, one-dimensional and multidimensional singular\nspectrum analysis was used. The Hilbert transform was used to calculate the\nchange in the amplitude and phase of the annual oscillation over time. As a\nresult, it turned out that over an interval of about 180 years, an almost\nmonotonic increase in the amplitude of the annual oscillation from\n$\\approx$60~mas to $\\approx$90~mas and an almost monotonic phase shift of\n$\\approx$45$^\\circ$ are observed. A correlation was also found between the\namplitude of the annual component and the difference in average temperatures\nfrom November to March in the northern and southern hemispheres.",

    "abstract": "As hybrid, distributed, and asynchronous work models become more prevalent,\ncontinuous learning in Agile Software Development (ASD) gains renewed\nimportance. Communities of Practice (CoPs) are increasingly adopted to support\nsocial learning beyond formal education, often relying on virtual\ncommunication. Psychological safety, a prerequisite for effective learning,\nremains insufficiently understood in these settings. This mixed-methods study\ninvestigates psychological safety within Agile CoPs through survey data from\n143 participants. Results indicate that psychological safety is significantly\nlower in online interactions compared to face-to-face settings. Moreover, low\npsychological safety reduces participants' intent to continue contributing and\navoidance of interpersonal risk. No significant differences emerged based on\ngender, community seniority, or content creation activity. However, differences\nby role and age group suggest potential generational or role-related effects.\nThematic analysis revealed exclusionary behavior, negative interaction\npatterns, and hostility as primary threats to psychological safety, often\nreinforced by tribalism and specific community dynamics. Suggested\ninterventions include establishing explicit norms, structured facilitation, and\nactive moderation. The findings were validated through member checking with 30\nparticipants. This study provides a comparative perspective on interaction\nmodalities and offers practical guidance for organizers seeking to cultivate\ninclusive, high-impact CoPs and similarly structured virtual or hybrid work\nenvironments.",

The thesis establishes tight upper and lower\nbounds in several regimes for various local update algorithms and characterizes\nthe min-max complexity of multiple problem classes.

The mean curvature is used to determine the normal velocity within\nthe gradient flow structure, thus guaranteeing an unconditional energy\nstability for the discrete solution upon suitable discretization. We introduce\na novel weak formulation for this geometric PDE, in which different types of\nboundary conditions can be naturally enforced. We further discretize the weak\nformulation to obtain a fully discrete parametric finite element method, for\nwhich well-posedness can be rigorously shown.

While previous studies on 3D object detection often evaluate\nperformance based on mean average precision (mAP) and latency, they typically\nfail to address the trade-off between speed and accuracy, such as 60.0 mAP at\n100 ms vs 61.0 mAP at 500 ms. A quantitative assessment of the trade-offs\nbetween different hardware devices and accelerators remains unexplored, despite\nbeing critical for real-time applications. Furthermore, they overlook the\nimpact on collision avoidance in motion planning, for example, 60.0 mAP leading\nto safer motion planning or 61.0 mAP leading to high-risk motion planning. In\nthis paper, we introduce latency-aware AP (L-AP) and planning-aware AP (P-AP)\nas new metrics, which consider the physical world such as the concept of time\nand physical constraints, offering a more comprehensive evaluation for\nreal-time 3D object detection.

In this paper, we address this limitation and introduce LIMAO (Lifelong\nModular Learned Query Optimizer), a framework for lifelong learning of plan\ncost prediction that can be seamlessly integrated into existing LQOs. LIMAO\nleverages a modular lifelong learning technique, an attention-based neural\nnetwork composition architecture, and an efficient training paradigm designed\nto retain prior knowledge while continuously adapting to new environments. We\nimplement LIMAO in two LQOs, showing that our approach is agnostic to\nunderlying engines. Experimental results show that LIMAO significantly enhances\nthe performance of LQOs, achieving up to a 40% improvement in query execution\ntime and reducing the variance of execution time by up to 60% under dynamic\nworkloads. By leveraging a precise and self-consistent design, LIMAO\neffectively mitigates catastrophic forgetting, ensuring stable and reliable\nplan quality over time.

We\npresent strategies to automatically assign descriptive captions to an existing\ndataset, and train diffusion models using both pretrained text encoders and\nsimple transformer models trained from scratch. Captions are automatically\nassigned to generated scenes so that the degree of overlap between input and\noutput captions can be compared. We also assess the diversity and playability\nof the resulting level scenes. Results are compared with an unconditional\ndiffusion model and a generative adversarial network, as well as the\ntext-to-level approaches Five-Dollar Model and MarioGPT. Notably, the best\ndiffusion model uses a simple transformer model for text embedding, and takes\nless time to train than diffusion models employing more complex text encoders,\nindicating that reliance on larger language models is not necessary. We also\npresent a GUI allowing designers to construct long levels from model-generated\nscenes.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we examine eigenfunctions of a generalized Landau Magnetic\nLaplacian that models the physics of an electron confined to a plane in a\nmagnetic field orthogonal to the plane. This operator has an infinite\ndimensional null space and, at least in the model case, has infinite\ndimensional eigenspaces with eigenvalues which are essentially the same as the\neigenvalues of the Hermite operator. We demonstrate that, under fairly general\nassumptions on the potential function of the magnetic field, the $L^\\infty$\nnorm of these eigenfunctions is bounded by their $L^2$ norm independently of\nthe associated eigenvalue. We furthermore demonstrate an improvement in the\n$L^6$ norm of these eigenfunctions. The method we use comes from semiclassical\nanalysis and is inspired by the work of Koch, Tataru, and Zworski that applies\nlocally. In our case, we use a new conjugation argument to demonstrate the\nresult over all of $\\mathbb{R}^2$.",

There are several\nattempts to accomplish this task by the use of traditional 2D imaging, 3D\nreconstructions, and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). However, they have\nseveral drawbacks when processing 3D data and identifying individual plant\ncomponents. Therefore, in this work, we propose a novel Deep Learning\narchitecture to detect components of individual plants on Light Detection and\nRanging (LiDAR) 3D Point Cloud (PC) data sets. This architecture is based on\nthe concept of Graph Neural Networks (GNN), and feature enhancing with\nPrincipal Component Analysis (PCA). For this, each point is taken as a vertex\nand by the use of a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) layer, the edges are established,\nthus representing the 3D PC data set. Subsequently, Edge-Conv layers are used\nto further increase the features of each point. Finally, Graph Attention\nNetworks (GAT) are applied to classify visible phenotypic components of the\nplant, such as the leaf, stem, and soil. This study demonstrates that our\ngraph-based deep learning approach enhances segmentation accuracy for\nidentifying individual plant components, achieving percentages above 80% in the\nIoU average, thus outperforming other existing models based on point clouds.",

The approach uses a\nReinforcement Learning (RL) agent to explore the input space and identify\ncritical decision boundaries by rewarding actions that cause meaningful changes\nin the system's output. These counterfactual state transitions, where the\noutput changes, are collected and clustered using K-Means. Decision trees are\nthen trained on these clusters to extract human-readable rules that approximate\nthe system's decision logic near the identified boundaries. I demonstrated the\npipeline's effectiveness on three dummy legacy systems with varying complexity,\nincluding threshold-based, combined-conditional, and non-linear range logic.\nResults show that the RL agent successfully focuses exploration on relevant\nboundary regions, and the extracted rules accurately reflect the core logic of\nthe underlying dummy systems, providing a promising foundation for generating\nspecifications and test cases during legacy migration.",

The KZ protocol starts at\ntime $t_i<0$ from the negatively magnetized ground state for $h_i = t_i/t_s<0$.\nThen, the system evolves unitarily up to a time $t_f > 0$, such that the\nmagnetization of the state at time $t_f$ is positive. In finite-size systems,\nthe KZ dynamics develops out-of-equilibrium finite-size scaling (OFSS)\nbehaviors. Their scaling variables depend either exponentially or with a power\nlaw on the size, depending on the boundary conditions (BC). The OFSS functions\ncan be computed in effective models restricted to appropriate low-energy\n(magnetized and/or kink) states. The KZ scaling behavior drastically changes in\nthe thermodynamic limit (TL), defined as the infinite-size limit keeping $t$\nand $t_s$ fixed, which appears substantially unrelated with the OFSS regime,\nbecause it involves higher-energy multi-kink states, which are irrelevant in\nthe OFSS limit. The numerical analyses of the KZ dynamics in the TL show the\nemergence of a quantum spinodal-like scaling behavior at the FOQTs for all\nconsidered BC, which is independent of the BC. The longitudinal magnetization\nchanges sign at $h(t)=h*>0$, where $h*$ decreases with increasing $t_s$, as\n$h*\\sim 1/\\ln t_s$.

Then the full magnon-mediated interaction\nsatisfies Adler criterion and for a valley-odd/spatially-even order parameter\ncontains a universal attractive piece. This term is induced by spin-orbit\ncoupling and is confined to energies which are parametrically smaller than the\nFermi energy. We argue that, due to retardation, this magnon-mediated\nattraction gives rise to superconductivity despite that there exists a stronger\nstatic repulsion, in close analogy with how phonon-mediated attraction gives\nrise to pairing in the presence of stronger Coulomb (Hubbard) repulsion.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in video generation models have enabled high-quality short\nvideo generation from text prompts. However, extending these models to longer\nvideos remains a significant challenge, primarily due to degraded temporal\nconsistency and visual fidelity. Our preliminary observations show that naively\napplying short-video generation models to longer sequences leads to noticeable\nquality degradation. Further analysis identifies a systematic trend where\nhigh-frequency components become increasingly distorted as video length grows,\nan issue we term high-frequency distortion. To address this, we propose\nFreeLong, a training-free framework designed to balance the frequency\ndistribution of long video features during the denoising process. FreeLong\nachieves this by blending global low-frequency features, which capture holistic\nsemantics across the full video, with local high-frequency features extracted\nfrom short temporal windows to preserve fine details. Building on this,\nFreeLong++ extends FreeLong dual-branch design into a multi-branch architecture\nwith multiple attention branches, each operating at a distinct temporal scale.\nBy arranging multiple window sizes from global to local, FreeLong++ enables\nmulti-band frequency fusion from low to high frequencies, ensuring both\nsemantic continuity and fine-grained motion dynamics across longer video\nsequences. Without any additional training, FreeLong++ can be plugged into\nexisting video generation models (e.g. Wan2.1 and LTX-Video) to produce longer\nvideos with substantially improved temporal consistency and visual fidelity. We\ndemonstrate that our approach outperforms previous methods on longer video\ngeneration tasks (e.g. 4x and 8x of native length).

The kernels are\nregularized using a smoothing parameter, and then a standard quadrature is\napplied. The integrals are computed for three choices of the smoothing\nparameter to find the extrapolated value to fifth order accuracy. In this work,\nwe apply several techniques to reduce the computational cost of the\nextrapolated regularization method applied to the Stokes single and double\nlayer integrals. First, we use a straightforward OpenMP parallelization over\nthe target points. Second, we note that the effect of the regularization is\nlocal and evaluate only the local component of the sum for three values of the\nsmoothing parameter. The non-local component of the sum is only evaluated once\nand reused in the other sums. This component is still the computational\nbottleneck as it is $O(N^2)$, where $N$ is the system size. We apply the\nkernel-independent treecode to these far-field interactions to reduce the CPU\ntime.

Additionally, we\nconduct an interpretability analysis to measure context usage and input\nrelevance. We also introduce the TableEval benchmark, comprising 3017 tables\nfrom scholarly publications, Wikipedia, and financial reports, where each table\nis provided in five different formats: Image, Dictionary, HTML, XML, and LaTeX.\nOur findings indicate that while LLMs maintain robustness across table\nmodalities, they face significant challenges when processing scientific tables.",

    "abstract": "Survival analysis aims to explore the relationship between covariates and the\ntime until the occurrence of an event. The Cox proportional hazards model is\ncommonly used for right-censored data, but it is not strictly limited to this\ntype of data. However, the presence of missing values among the covariates,\nparticularly categorical ones, can compromise the validity of the estimates. To\naddress this issue, various classical methods for handling missing data have\nbeen proposed within the Cox model framework, including parametric imputation,\nnonparametric imputation, and semiparametric methods. It is well-documented\nthat none of these methods is universally ideal or optimal, making the choice\nof the preferred method often complex and challenging. To overcome these\nlimitations, we propose hybrid methods that combine the advantages of classical\nmethods to enhance the robustness of the analyses. Through a simulation study,\nwe demonstrate that these hybrid methods provide increased flexibility,\nsimplified implementation, and improved robustness compared to classical\nmethods. The results from the simulation study highlight that hybrid methods\noffer increased flexibility, simplified implementation, and greater robustness\ncompared to classical approaches. In particular, they allow for a reduction in\nestimation bias; however, this improvement comes at the cost of reduced\nprecision, due to increased variability. This observation reflects a well-known\nmethodological trade-off between bias and variance, inherent to the combination\nof complementary imputation strategies.",

The advent of Gaia DR3 offers an unprecedented astrometric\nprecision, enabling the discovery of new hypervelocity stars and facilitating\ntheir characterization. This study seeks to identify and characterize\nhypervelocity star candidates using Gaia DR3 data, focusing on stars lacking\nradial velocity measurements. Our goal was to estimate the total velocities of\nthese stars and establish their origin within the Galactic framework, if\npossible. We applied strict selection criteria to Gaia DR3 data, focusing on\nsources with low parallax uncertainties and high astrometric fidelity. The\ndistributions of the total velocities in the Galactic rest frame were derived\nand used to identify candidates. Spectroscopic follow-up with VLT/FORS2\nprovided radial velocity measurements for a subset of these candidates. We\nevaluated the probabilities of stars exceeding local escape velocities under\ndifferent Galactic potential models and traced their past orbits to identify\npossible origins. From Gaia DR3, we identified 149 hypervelocity star\ncandidates with Pesc > 50% of exceeding local escape velocities. Our follow-up\nspectroscopy for 23 of those sources confirms that the selected targets are\ntraveling at high velocities, with many appearing to escape the Galaxy,\ndepending on the Galactic potential adopted. Our analysis suggests that nearly\none-third of the stars may have an extra-Galactic origin.

    "abstract": "Signal detection is one of the main challenges of data science. According to\nthe nature of the data, the presence of noise may corrupt measurements and\nhinder the discovery of significant patterns. A wide range of techniques aiming\nat extracting the relevant degrees of freedom from data has been thus developed\nover the years. However, signal detection in almost continuous spectra, for\nsmall signal-to-noise ratios, remains a known difficult issue. This paper\ndevelops over recent advancements proposing to tackle this issue by analysing\nthe properties of the underlying effective field theory arising as a sort of\nmaximal entropy distribution in the vicinity of universal random matrix\ndistributions. Nearly continuous spectra provide an intrinsic and\nnon-conventional scaling law for field and couplings, the scaling dimensions\ndepending on the energy scale. The coarse-graining over small eigenvalues of\nthe empirical spectrum defines a specific renormalization group, whose\ncharacteristics change when the collective behaviour of \"informational\" modes\nbecome significant, that is, stronger than the intrinsic fluctuations of noise.\nThis paper pursues three different goals. First, we propose to quantify the\nreal effects of fluctuations relative to what can be called \"signal\", while\nimproving the robustness of the results obtained in our previous work. Second,\nwe show that quantitative changes in the presence of a signal result in a\ncounterintuitive modification of the distribution of eigenvectors. Finally, we\npropose a method for estimating the number of noise components and define a\nlimit of detection in a general nearly continuous spectrum using the\nrenormalization group. The main statements of this paper are essentially\nnumeric, and their reproducibility can be checked using the associated code.",

    "abstract": "Interplay of strong correlation and flat topological band has been a central\nproblem in moir\\'e systems such as the magic angle twisted bilayer graphene\n(TBG). Recent studies show that Mott-like states may still be possible in TBG\ndespite the Wannier obstruction. However, the nature of such unconventional\nstates is still not well understood. In this work we construct the ground state\nwavefunction and exotic excitations of a symmetric correlated semimetal or\ninsulator at even integer filling using a parton mean field theory of the\ntopological heavy fermion model. We label the valence of the $f$ orbital based\non its occupation $n_f$. At $\\nu=-2$, we show that the $f$ orbital is not in\nthe simple $f^{2+}$ valence expected from a trivial Mott localization. Instead,\naround $1/3$ of AA sites are self doped, with holes entering the $c$ orbitals\naway from AA sites. As a result, the $f$ orbital is in a superposition of\n$f^{2+}$ and $f^{3+}$ valences and should not be viewed as local moment. We dub\nthe phase as \\textit{mixed valence Mott insulator}. This unconventional\ninsulator has a large hybridization $\\langle c^\\dagger f \\rangle\\neq 0$ and is\nsharply distinct from the usual `kondo breakdown' picture. In most of the\nmomentum space away from the $\\Gamma$ point, there is a Mott gap equal to the\nHubbard $U$. At the $\\Gamma$ point, we have a `charge transfer gap' much\nsmaller than $U$. In particular, the top of the lower band is dominated by a\ncomposite excitation, which is a linear combination of $|f^{1+}\\rangle\\langle\nf^{2+}|$ and $|f^{2+}\\rangle\\langle f^{3+}|$ with a sign structure such that it\nis orthogonal to the microscopic $f$ operator. At $\\nu=0$, similar approach\nleads to a Mott semimetal. We hope this work will inspire more explorations of\nthe Anderson models with a large hybridization, a regime which may host new\nphysics beyond the familiar Kondo or heavy fermion systems.",

Leveraging a 3D variational\nautoencoder with a U-Net architecture, DeepCHART performs fast, likelihood-free\ninference, accurately capturing the non-linear gravitational dynamics and\nbaryonic processes embedded in cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. When\napplied to joint datasets combining Ly$\\alpha$ forest absorption and coeval\ngalaxy positions, the reconstruction quality improves further. For current\nsurveys, such as Subaru/PFS, CLAMATO, and LATIS, with an average transverse\nsightline spacing of $d_\\perp=2.4h^{-1}$cMpc, DeepCHART achieves high-fidelity\nreconstructions over the density range $0.4<\\Delta_{\\rm DM}<15$, with a\nvoxel-wise Pearson correlation coefficient of $\\rho\\simeq 0.77$. These\nreconstructions are obtained using Ly$\\alpha$ forest spectra with\nsignal-to-noise ratios as low as 2 and instrumental resolution $R=2500$,\nmatching Subaru/PFS specifications. For future high-density surveys enabled by\ninstruments such as ELT/MOSAIC and WST/IFS with $d_\\perp\\simeq\n1h^{-1}\\mathrm{cMpc}$, the correlation improves to $\\rho\\simeq 0.90$ across a\nwider dynamic range ($0.25<\\Delta_{\\rm DM}<40$). The framework reliably\nrecovers the dark matter density PDF as well as the power spectrum, with only\nmild suppression at intermediate scales. In terms of cosmic web classification,\nDeepCHART successfully identifies 81% of voids, 75% of sheets, 63% of\nfilaments, and 43% of nodes.

A dramatic example\nis hydrodynamic `shattering', the violent, pressure-driven fragmentation of a\ncooling cloud which falls drastically out of pressure balance with its\nsurroundings. We run MHD simulations to understand how shattering is influenced\nby magnetic fields. In MHD, clouds do not `shatter' chaotically. Instead, after\ninitial fragmentation, both hot and cold phases coherently `stream' in\nlong-lived, field-aligned, self-sustaining gas flows, at high speed ($\\sim 100\n\\, {\\rm km \\, s^{-1}}$). MHD thermal instability also produces such flows. They\nare due to the anisotropic nature of MHD pressure support, which only operates\nperpendicular to B-fields. Thus, even when $P_{\\rm B} + P_{\\rm gas}\n\\approx$const, pressure balance only holds perpendicular to B-fields.\nField-aligned gas pressure variations are unopposed, and results in gas\nvelocities $v \\sim (2 \\Delta P/\\rho)^{1/2}$ from Bernoulli's principle.\nStrikingly, gas in adjacent flux tubes $\\textit{counter-stream}$ in opposite\ndirections. We show this arises from a cooling-induced, MHD version of the thin\nshell instability. Magnetic tension is important both in enabling corrugational\ninstability and modifying its non-linear evolution. Even in high $\\beta$ hot\ngas, streaming can arise, since magnetic pressure support grows as gas cools\nand compresses. Thermal conduction increases the sizes and velocities of\nstreaming cloudlets, but does not qualitatively modify dynamics. These results\nare relevant to the counter-streaming gas flows observed in solar coronal rain,\nas well as multi-phase gas cooling and condensation in the ISM, CGM and ICM.",

In this `topological' regime of well-separated MZMs, their overlap\nis exponentially small, leading to exponentially small Majorana splitting, thus\nenabling the MZMs to be topologically protected by the superconducting gap.

The code implements standard algorithms widely used\nin current spectroscopic surveys for computing the two-point correlation\nfunction with its distortion matrix, covariance matrices; and it naturally\nextends the two-point estimator to three-point correlations. Thanks to GPU\noptimization, Lya2pcf achieves a substantial reduction in computational time\nfor both the two-point correlation function and its distortion matrix when\ncompared to the widely used PICCA code. We apply Lya2pcf to data from the Sloan\nDigital Sky Survey (SDSS) sixteenth data release (DR16) and a Dark Energy\nSpectroscopic Instrument Year-5 (DESI Y5) mock dataset, demonstrating overall\nperformance gains over PICCA, especially on GPUs. We show the first measurement\nof the anisotropic three-point correlation function on a large spectroscopic\nsample for all possible triangles with scales up to 80 Mpc/h. The estimator's\nfast computation and the resulting signal-to-noise ratio -- above one for many\ntriangle configurations -- demonstrate the viability of incorporating\nthree-point statistics into future cosmological inference analyses,\nparticularly with the larger datasets expected from Stage IV spectroscopic\nsurveys.",

IRAS\n23077+6707 is a highly-inclined and newly discovered protoplanetary disk, first\nreported in 2024.

The images show\nextended linear emission that spans $5.6{-}6.1''$ as expected for a radially\nextended, highly-inclined protoplanetary disk. Accompanied with lower\nresolution data, we show that the disk has a steep spectral index, ranging from\n$\\alpha=3.2{-}3.9$. We present evidence of multiple radial emission peaks and\ntroughs in emission, which may originate in disk rings and a central cavity. We\nfurther present evidence that these radial structures are asymmetric; hosting a\na significant brightness asymmetry, with emission enhanced by up to 50% in the\nnorth versus the south. We discuss hypotheses about the potential origins of\nthese features, including the possibility that IRAS 23077+6707 hosts a rare\nexample of an eccentric protoplanetary disk, which can induce these radially\nasymmetric structures. We present a simple eccentric continuum model of IRAS\n23077+6707, and show for an eccentricity of $e \\approx 0.26$, that this can\nreproduce the bulk morphology of the emission.",

    "abstract": "We introduce PyMGal, a Python package for generating optical mock\nobservations of galaxies from hydrodynamical simulations. PyMGal reads the\nproperties of stellar particles from these simulations and generates spectral\nenergy distributions (SEDs) based on a variety of stellar population models\nthat can be customised to fit the user's choice of applications. Given these\nSEDs, the program can calculate the brightness of particles in different output\nunits for hundreds of unique filters. These quantities can then be projected to\na 2D plane mimicking a telescope observation. The software is compatible with\ndifferent snapshot formats and allows a flexible selection of models, filters,\noutput units, axes of projection, angular resolutions, fields of view, and\nmore. It also supports additional features including dust attenuation, particle\nsmoothing, and the option to output spectral data cubes and maps of mass, age,\nand metallicity. These synthetic observations can be used to directly compare\nthe simulated objects to reality in order to model galaxy evolution, study\ndifferent theoretical models, and investigate different observational effects.\nThis package allows the user to perform fast and consistent comparisons between\nsimulation and observation, leading to a better and more precise understanding\nof what we see in our Universe.",

    "abstract": "The paper contributes to an ongoing effort to extend the conformal bootstrap\nbeyond its traditional focus on systems of four-point correlation functions.\nRecently, it was demonstrated that semidefinite programming can be used to\nformulate a six-point generalisation of the numerical bootstrap, yielding\nqualitatively new, rigorous bounds on CFT data. However, the numerical\nsix-point bootstrap requires solving SDPs involving infinite-dimensional\nmatrices, which has so far limited its applicability and hindered scalability\nin early implementations. This work overcomes the challenges by using sparse\nmatrix decompositions to exploit the banded structure of the underlying SDP.\nThe result is a rewriting of one-dimensional six-point bootstrap problems as\neffectively two-dimensional standard mixed correlator four-point bootstrap\ncomputations. As application, novel bounds whose extremal correlators\ninterpolate between the six-point functions of the generalised free fermion and\nboson are derived. The extremal interpolations are matched with perturbative\ndeformations of the massive free boson in AdS$_2$.",

Despite previous\nobservations revealing multiple cold fronts and dynamical disturbances in the\ncluster core, our XRISM observations show low gas velocity dispersions of\nsigma_v = 115 +/- 7 km s^-1 in the inner region (~< 25 kpc) and sigma_v = 186\n+/- 9 km s^-1 in the outer region (~ 25-50 kpc). The gas temperatures are kT =\n5.8 +/- 0.2 keV and 8.4 +/- 0.2 keV for the inner and outer regions,\nrespectively, with metal abundances of Z = 0.75 +/- 0.03 Z_sun (inner) and 0.44\n+/- 0.02 Z_sun (outer). The measured velocity dispersions correspond to\nnonthermal pressure fractions of only 1.4 +/- 0.2% (inner) and 2.5 +/- 0.2%\n(outer), indicating highly subsonic turbulence. Our analysis of the bulk gas\nmotion indicates that the gas in the inner region is nearly at rest relative to\nthe central galaxy (|v_bulk| = 8 +/- 7 km s^-1), while the outer region\nexhibits a moderate motion of |v_bulk| = 104 +/- 7 km s^-1. Assuming the\nvelocity dispersion arises from turbulent motions, the turbulent heating rate\nis ~ 40\\% of the radiative cooling rate, although there is some uncertainty.\nThis suggests that the heating and cooling of the gas are not currently\nbalanced. The activity of the central active galactic nucleus (AGN) has\napparently weakened. The sloshing motion that created the cold fronts may now\nbe approaching a turning point at which the velocity is minimum. Alternatively,\nthe central galaxy and the associated hot gas could be moving nearly parallel\nto the plane of the sky.",

Further and more precise directly measured dynamical masses of these\ncompanions are required to inform and gauge formation, evolutionary, and\natmospheric models. We present an updated study of HIP 99770 b based on\nobservations conducted with VLTI/GRAVITY. Aims: Combining the new data with\nprevious observations from the literature, we characterise HIP 99770 b to\nbetter constrain its orbit, dynamical mass, and atmospheric properties, as well\nas to shed light on its likely formation channel. Methods: We ran a renewed\norbit fit to further constrain the dynamical mass of the companion and the\norbit solution. We also analysed the GRAVITY K-band spectrum, placing it into\ncontext with literature data, and extracting magnitude, age, spectral type,\nbulk properties and atmospheric characteristics of HIP 99770 b. Results: We\ndetected the companion at a radial separation of $417\\,\\mathrm{mas}$ from its\nhost. The new orbit fit yields a dynamical mass of\n$17_{-5}^{+6}\\,\\mathrm{M}_\\mathrm{Jup}$ and an eccentricity of\n$0.31_{-0.12}^{+0.06}$. We also find that additional relative astrometry epochs\nin the future will not enable further constraints on the dynamical mass due to\nthe dominating relative uncertainty on the Hipparcos-Gaia proper motion\nanomaly. The publication of Gaia DR4 will likely ease this predicament. We find\nthat the companion is consistent with spectral type L8 and exhibits a potential\nmetal enrichment in its atmosphere.

Nevertheless,\nthe new constraints on its bulk properties and the additional GRAVITY spectrum\npresented here will aid future efforts to determine the formation history of\nHIP 99770 b.",

    "abstract": "The Schwarzschild solution describes a classical static black hole in general\nrelativity. When general relativity is extended by including semiclassical\ncorrections in the form of a renormalized energy-momentum tensor, the horizon\nof the Schwarzschild black hole disappears and is replaced by a wormhole. We\nstudy the stability of this quantum corrected static Schwarzschild solution in\nsemiclassical gravity by using it as the initial data of a dynamical evolution.\nWe find that the quantum corrected solution is unstable and that the wormhole\ncan expand or collapse when perturbed. In vacuum, the wormhole expands, but in\nthe presence of even a small amount of classical matter, the wormhole\ncollapses, forming a horizon and evolving to an evaporating black hole.",

Cosmological\nsimulations predict that seed magnetic fields are amplified up to the\n$\\mu$G-level in the ICM, but the magnetic field strength and structure have\nbeen studied in only a few clusters. Abell 2142 is a local massive cluster that\nshows evidence of a post-merger dynamical state. In this work, we aim to\nconstrain the magnetic field intensity, radial profile and power spectrum\nwithin its ICM, providing key insights into the nature of this non-thermal\ncomponent in galaxy clusters. We present MeerKAT observations of Abell 2142 in\nthe L-band (872-1712 MHz), imaged in polarisation for the first time with this\npurpose. We derive the Rotation Measure (RM) from the radio galaxies' polarised\nemission by applying the RM synthesis technique and analyse both the RM and\nfractional polarisation ($\\mathrm{F_p}$). To investigate the magnetic field\ndistribution within the ICM, we compare our results with mock RM maps generated\nfrom 3D simulations of the cluster. We find that the RM dispersion,\n$\\sigma_{\\mathrm{RM}}$, decreases with projected radius, whereas the\n$\\mathrm{F_p}$ increases. Both trends suggest that the magnetic field intensity\ndecreases at larger distances from the cluster center, in agreement with\nstudies on other clusters. Assuming that the magnetic field energy density\nscales with the gas thermal energy ($B \\propto n_e^{0.5}$), a magnetic field\nwith a power spectrum ranging from scales between 7 and 470 kpc, with peak at\n$\\sim 140$ kpc and mean central strength of $9.5 \\pm 1.0 \\ \\mu$G, provides the\nbest fit to our data.

Indeed, we have only confirmed 2 forming planets (i.e.,\nprotoplanets; ${\\lesssim}10$ Myr) residing in one single system. In comparison,\nwe have imaged over 200 protoplanetary disks in the past decade, with many of\nthem hosting substructures such as spirals and gaps which suggest the existence\nof protoplanets. To understand the early stages of planet formation, the\nHabitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) - with its high-contrast imaging and\nintegral field spectroscopy capabilities - presents a unique opportunity to\nexplore the demographics of the natal stages of planet formation and their\nbirth environments. We propose to image protoplanets within substructured\nprotoplanetary disks using HWO via direct imaging, and characterize them (i.e.,\nprotoplanets, protoplanetary disks, circumplanetary disks) using integral field\nspectroscopy and spectropolarimetry. This effort will dramatically extend\ncurrent population of protoplanets, probing and characterizing over 200\nprotoplanets. By expanding the number of protoplanets by two orders of\nmagnitude, these observations will test and refine planet formation theory and\nplanet-disk interaction theory, and further motivate planet migration studies\ntogether with existing mature planets.

Particularly valuable are ALMA data from a cycle-10 CISTERN\nprogram, providing [CII] coverage for 46 UV-faint (M_{UV,AB}>-24.5) and 25\nespecially UV-faint (Muv>-23.5) QSOs, improving statistics by 5x and 6x,\nrespectively.

Using these selections and recent QSO\nluminosity functions (LFs), we present the first characterization of UV\nluminosity distribution for QSOs in massive host galaxies and quantify [CII]\nLFs for both UV-bright and UV-faint QSOs. While ~3% of massive-host QSOs are\nUV-bright (Muv<-26), >~85% are UV-faint (Muv>-24.5).

    "abstract": "We introduce Calligrapher, a novel diffusion-based framework that\ninnovatively integrates advanced text customization with artistic typography\nfor digital calligraphy and design applications. Addressing the challenges of\nprecise style control and data dependency in typographic customization, our\nframework incorporates three key technical contributions. First, we develop a\nself-distillation mechanism that leverages the pre-trained text-to-image\ngenerative model itself alongside the large language model to automatically\nconstruct a style-centric typography benchmark. Second, we introduce a\nlocalized style injection framework via a trainable style encoder, which\ncomprises both Qformer and linear layers, to extract robust style features from\nreference images. An in-context generation mechanism is also employed to\ndirectly embed reference images into the denoising process, further enhancing\nthe refined alignment of target styles. Extensive quantitative and qualitative\nevaluations across diverse fonts and design contexts confirm Calligrapher's\naccurate reproduction of intricate stylistic details and precise glyph\npositioning. By automating high-quality, visually consistent typography,\nCalligrapher surpasses traditional models, empowering creative practitioners in\ndigital art, branding, and contextual typographic design.",

The\nanomalous planar effects manifest in a configuration when the applied electric\nfield/temperature gradient, magnetic field, and the measured Hall voltage are\nall co-planar, but the planar magnetic field is instrumental in breaking\n$\\hat{C}_{4z}\\hat{\\mathcal{T}}$ symmetry of the $d$-wave altermagnet, where\n$\\hat{\\mathcal{T}}$ is the time reversal operator, resulting in a Zeeman gap at\na shifted Dirac node and a nonzero Berry curvature monopole. We demonstrate\nthat these systems exhibit nearly half-quantized anomalous planar Hall and\nplanar thermal Hall effects at low temperatures that persist over a range of\nmagnetic fields. The angular dependence of the planar transport reveals a\n$\\cos2\\phi$ dependence on the magnetic field direction, where $\\phi$ is the\nazimuthal angle made by the magnetic field. We also discuss the anomalous\nplanar Nernst effect, or transverse thermopower, and demonstrate that the\nNernst conductivity peaks when the chemical potential lies just outside the\ninduced Zeeman gap and vanishes within the gap. We further explore the\ndependence of all three coefficients on the polar and the azimuthal angle of\nthe magnetic field when it is rotated in the full $3D$ space.

    "abstract": "Data selection plays a crucial role in data-driven decision-making, including\nin large language models (LLMs), and is typically task-dependent. Properties\nsuch as data quality and diversity have been extensively studied and are known\nto enhance model performance. However, it remains unclear whether there exist\nother quantitative and general principles of data selection that can\nconsistently improve performance, especially for complex tasks with limited\nprior knowledge. In this paper, we demonstrate that selecting more uniformly\ndistributed data can improve training efficiency while enhancing performance.\nSpecifically, we establish that more uniform (less biased) distribution leads\nto a larger minimum pairwise distance between data points, denoted by\n$h_{\\min}$, and prove that a smaller $h_{\\min}$ can slow down the training\ndynamics of gradient descent (GD). Moreover, we theoretically show that the\napproximation error of neural networks decreases as $h_{\\min}$ increases. Our\nanalysis introduces a convergence framework for GD beyond the Neural Tangent\nKernel (NTK) regime, applicable to a broad class of architectures, including\ntransformers, without requiring Lipschitz smoothness. This framework further\nprovides theoretical justification for the use of residual connections and\nfunction compositions in deep neural architectures. In the end, we conduct\ncomprehensive experiments for supervised fine-tuning across various settings,\nincluding different optimization strategies, model sizes, and training\ndatasets. The results consistently demonstrate that selecting data by\nmaximizing pairwise distance significantly accelerates training and achieves\ncomparable or better performance in LLMs across diverse datasets.

To\nenable this self-play training at scale, We implement a fully online,\nmulti-turn, multi-agent reinforcement learning system for LLMs and propose\nrole-conditioned advantage estimation (RAE) to stabilize multi-agent training.\nUsing SPIRAL, self-play on zero-sum games produces reasoning capabilities that\ntransfer broadly. Training Qwen3-4B-Base on Kuhn Poker alone achieves 8.6%\nimprovement on math and 8.4% on general reasoning, outperforming SFT on 25,000\nexpert game trajectories. Analysis reveals that this transfer occurs through\nthree cognitive patterns: systematic decomposition, expected value calculation,\nand case-by-case analysis. Multi-game training (TicTacToe, Kuhn Poker, Simple\nNegotiation) further enhances performance as each game develops distinct\nreasoning strengths. Applying SPIRAL to a strong reasoning model\n(DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B) can still lead to 2.0% average improvement.

While\nSET phases with Abelian anyons are relatively well understood, those involving\nnon-Abelian anyons remain elusive. This obscurity stems from the\nmulti-dimensional internal gauge spaces intrinsic to non-Abelian anyons -- a\nfeature first made explicit in [1,2] and further explored and formalized in our\nrecent works [3-8]. These internal spaces can transform in highly nontrivial\nways under global symmetries. In this work, we employ an exactly solvable model\n-- the multifusion Hu-Geer-Wu string-net model introduced in a companion paper\n[9] -- to reveal how the internal gauge spaces of non-Abelian anyons transform\nunder symmetries. We uncover a universal mechanism, global symmetry\nfragmentation (GSF), whereby symmetry-invariant anyons exhibit internal Hilbert\nspace decompositions into eigensubspaces labeled by generally fractional\nsymmetry charges. Meanwhile, symmetry-permuted anyons hybridize and fragment\ntheir internal spaces in accordance with their symmetry behavior. These\nfragmented structures realize genuinely nonlinear symmetry representations --\nto be termed coherent representations -- that transcend conventional linear and\nprojective classifications, reflecting the categorical nature of symmetries in\ntopological phases.

The\nenergy injection into plasma in redshift ranges, $5\\times10^4\\lesssim\nz\\lesssim2\\times10^6$ and $ z\\lesssim5\\times10^4$, leads to $\\mu$-type and\n$y$-type of CMB spectral distortions, respectively.

    "abstract": "Denoising diffusion models excel at generating high-quality images\nconditioned on text prompts, yet their effectiveness heavily relies on careful\nguidance during the sampling process. Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) provides a\nwidely used mechanism for steering generation by setting the guidance scale,\nwhich balances image quality and prompt alignment. However, the choice of the\nguidance scale has a critical impact on the convergence toward a visually\nappealing and prompt-adherent image. In this work, we propose an annealing\nguidance scheduler which dynamically adjusts the guidance scale over time based\non the conditional noisy signal. By learning a scheduling policy, our method\naddresses the temperamental behavior of CFG. Empirical results demonstrate that\nour guidance scheduler significantly enhances image quality and alignment with\nthe text prompt, advancing the performance of text-to-image generation.\nNotably, our novel scheduler requires no additional activations or memory\nconsumption, and can seamlessly replace the common classifier-free guidance,\noffering an improved trade-off between prompt alignment and quality.",

This\npaper presents a modified non-local gradient damage model (MNLD) that overcomes\nthese shortcomings by introducing modifications to the stress degradation\nfunction and forcing term in the Helmholtz free energy expression. These two\nmodifications ensure that as damage approaches its maximum value, both the\nthermodynamic damage driving force for damage vanishes and the evolution of the\nforcing term decays. Consequently, the damage band retains a non-growing\nconstant width throughout its evolution.

This study explores\nthe trends of probable contributors to Delhi's deteriorating air quality by\nanalyzing data from 2014 to 2024 -- a period that has not been the central\nfocus of previous research. The study aims to reassess the contributors in\nlight of recent shifts. The consistently worsening air quality has forced the\npeople of Delhi to adapt to an unhealthy environment. People breathing this\npolluted air are at great risk of developing several health issues such as\nrespiratory infections, heart disease, and lung cancer. The study provides a\nquantified perspective on how each contributor has influenced pollution levels\nby identifying percentage contributions of major sources. Over the years,\nDelhi's air pollution has been primarily attributed to stubble burning.\nHowever, the present study discusses the decline in stubble burning cases in\nthe current scenario and the evolving impact of contributors such as vehicular\nemissions, industrial activities, and population growth. Moreover, the study\nassesses the effectiveness of mitigation strategies like Electric Vehicles\n(EVs), public transport expansion, and pollution control policies. The average\nlevels of the Air Quality Index (AQI) during October-November and\nNovember-December remained consistently high from 2018 to 2024, reaching 374 in\nNovember 2024. Based on the data-driven analysis, the study demonstrates that\nexisting measures have fallen short and makes a strong case for implementing\nnew long-term strategies focusing on the root causes.",

To enable\nsuch models with high-fidelity human motion, two core challenges must be\naddressed. The first is the reconstruction gap between the continuous motion\nmodality and discrete representation in an autoregressive manner, and the\nsecond is the degradation of language intelligence during unified training.\nInspired by the mixture of experts, we propose MotionGPT3, a bimodal\nmotion-language model that treats human motion as a second modality, decoupling\nmotion modeling via separate model parameters and enabling both effective\ncross-modal interaction and efficient multimodal scaling training. To preserve\nlanguage intelligence, the text branch retains the original structure and\nparameters of the pretrained language model, while a new motion branch is\nintegrated via a shared attention mechanism, enabling bidirectional information\nflow between two modalities. We first employ a motion Variational Autoencoder\n(VAE) to encode raw human motion into latent representations. Based on this\ncontinuous latent space, the motion branch predicts motion latents directly\nfrom intermediate hidden states using a diffusion head, bypassing discrete\ntokenization. Extensive experiments show that our approach achieves competitive\nperformance on both motion understanding and generation tasks while preserving\nstrong language capabilities, establishing a unified bimodal motion diffusion\nframework within an autoregressive manner.",

    "abstract": "Determining how energy flows within and between molecules is crucial for\nunderstanding chemical reactions, material properties, and even vital processes\nsuch as photosynthesis. While the general principles of energy transfer are\nwell established, elucidating the specific molecular pathways by which energy\nis funneled remains challenging as it requires tracking energy flow in complex\nmolecular environments. Here, we demonstrate how photon excitation energy is\npartially dissipated in the light-harvesting Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO)\ncomplex, mediating the excitation energy transfer from light-harvesting\nchlorosomes to the photosynthetic reaction center in green sulfur bacteria.\nSpecifically, we isolate the contribution of the protein and specific\nvibrational modes of the pigment molecules to the energy dynamics. For this, we\nintroduce an efficient computational implementation of a recently proposed\ntheory of dissipation pathways for open quantum systems. Using it and a\nstate-of-the-art FMO model with highly structured and chromophore-specific\nspectral densities, we demonstrate that energy dissipation is dominated by\nlow-frequency modes ($<$ 800 cm$^{-1}$) as their energy range is near-resonance\nwith the energy gaps between electronic states of the pigments. We identify the\nmost important mode for dissipation to be in-plane breathing modes ($\\sim$200\ncm$^{-1}$) of the bacteriochlorophylls in the complex. Conversely, far-detuned\nintramolecular vibrations with higher frequencies ($>$ 800 cm$^{-1}$) play no\nrole in dissipation. Interestingly, the FMO complex first needs to borrow\nenergy from the environment to release excess photonic energy, making the\nenergy dissipation dynamics non-monotonic. Beyond their fundamental value,\nthese insights can guide the development of artificial light-harvesting devices\nand, more broadly, engineer environments for chemical and quantum control\ntasks.",

Ground truth depth, surface\nnormals, optical flow, occlusion, diffuse maps, six-degree-of-freedom pose,\ncoverage map, and 3D models are provided for 169 colonoscopy videos. Eight\nsimulated screening colonoscopy videos acquired by a gastroenterologist are\nprovided with ground truth poses. Lastly, the dataset includes 15 videos with\ncolon deformations for qualitative assessment. C3VDv2 emulates diverse and\nchallenging scenarios for 3D reconstruction algorithms, including fecal debris,\nmucous pools, blood, debris obscuring the colonoscope lens, en-face views, and\nfast camera motion. The enhanced realism of C3VDv2 will allow for more robust\nand representative development and evaluation of 3D reconstruction algorithms.\nProject Page - https://durrlab.github.io/C3VDv2/",

We find that the strongest predictors of these\nbarriers are differences in access to amenities, administrative borders, and\nresidential segregation by income and race. These invisible borders are\nconcentrated in urban cores and persist across cities, spatial scales, and time\nperiods. Physical infrastructure, such as highways and parks, plays a secondary\nbut still significant role, especially at short distances. We also find that\nindividuals who cross barriers tend to do so outside of traditional commuting\nhours and are more likely to live in areas with greater racial diversity, and\nhigher transit use or income. Together, these findings reveal how spatial,\nsocial, and behavioral forces structure urban accessibility and provide a\nscalable framework to detect and monitor barriers in cities, with applications\nin planning, policy evaluation, and equity analysis.",

A central server housing\na library of files populates both private and access caches using uncoded\nplacement. In this work, we focus on a constrained indexing regime, referred to\nas the intersection class, in which the sets used to index the demands of each\nuser must have a nonempty intersection. This regime models resource-limited IoT\nscenarios such as edge-assisted IoT systems, where devices with small private\ncaches connect to a small number of shared caches. We provide a necessary and\nsufficient condition under which the system parameters fall within this\nintersection class. Under this condition, we propose a centralized coded\ncaching scheme and characterize its rate-memory trade-off. Next, we define a\nuniform-intersection subclass and establish a condition under which the system\nbelongs to this subclass. Within this subclass, the proposed scheme has a\nregular structure, with each transmission benefiting the same number of users,\nand we characterize its rate-memory trade-off. Additionally, we derive an index\ncoding-based lower bound on the minimum achievable worst-case rate under\nuncoded placement. Finally, we provide numerical comparisons between the rate\nof the proposed scheme, the new lower bound, and bounds from the original work.",

By incorporating existing optical spectra, we derive He/H\nfor each galaxy using photoionization modeling of helium and hydrogen emission\nlines, including the He I 10830 {\\AA} line to break the density-temperature\ndegeneracy. After carefully selecting galaxies with robust He/H determinations,\nand adding 58 galaxies from previous studies, we obtain $Y_\\mathrm{P} =\n0.2387^{+0.0036}_{-0.0031}$. This $Y_\\mathrm{P}$ value is $\\sim1\\sigma$ lower\nthan most of the previous estimates, but agrees with recent determinations\nusing EMPGs and the CMB constraint from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT)\nexperiment. Our result indicates $N_\\mathrm{eff} = 2.54^{+0.21}_{-0.20}$,\nshowing a mild ($1-2\\sigma$) tension with the Standard Model and Planck\nresults.

Existing\non-device LLM engines, designed for isolated inferences, fail to efficiently\nmanage these concurrent and conflicting requests on consumer-grade\nheterogeneous SoCs with CPU, integrated GPU, and NPU. This paper introduces\nAgent.xpu, an efficient serving system for agentic LLM workloads on\nmemory-unified heterogeneous SoCs. With dedicated offline profiling, Agent.xpu\nfirst constructs a heterogeneous execution graph, which fuses and chunks model\nkernels for affinity-guided, elastic accelerator mapping with predictive kernel\nannotation. At runtime, its online scheduler enables fine-grained, kernel-level\npreemption to guarantee the responsiveness of reactive tasks. To maximize SoC\nutilization, it adopts slack-aware kernel backfill to opportunistically append\nproactive tasks, and mitigates NPU-iGPU contention via bandwidth-aware\ndispatch. Evaluation on an Intel Core Ultra SoC shows that Agent.xpu achieves\n4.6$\\times$ lower latency for reactive tasks and sustains\n1.6$\\times$-6.8$\\times$ higher throughput for proactive tasks compared to\nstate-of-the-art inference engines.",

This\nunexpected metallic regime naturally leads to a central question: how does the\nintroduction of dilution into an antiferromagnetic material, especially with\nlong-range magnetic interactions, induce metallicity -- a feature not commonly\nassociated with antiferromagnets? To address this question, we demonstrate that\nwhen the on-site repulsive Hubbard interaction strength is set to zero on a\npercentage of the sites (site dilution), the insulating state weakens due to\npercolative conduction among the diluted sites at low temperatures. Remarkably,\nthis occurs without any significant alteration to the underlying long-range\nantiferromagnetic ordering in the system, thereby providing a pathway to\nrealize antiferromagnetic metals. In addition, we show how the\nsublattice-dependent hopping can be exploited to engineer spin-polarized\nhalf-metallic antiferromagnets.

We show that the Dominating Set Knapsack\nproblem is strongly NP-complete even when restricted to Bipartite graphs but\nweakly NP-complete for Star graphs. We present a pseudo-polynomial time\nalgorithm for Trees in time $O(n\\cdot min\\{s^2, (\\alpha(V))^2\\})$. We show that\nDominating Set Knapsack is very unlikely to be Fixed Parameter Tractable(FPT)\nby proving that it is in W[2]-hard parameterized by the solution size. We\ndeveloped FPT algorithms with running time $O(4^{tw}\\cdot n^{O(1)} \\cdot\nmin\\{s^2, ((\\alpha(V))^2\\})$ and $O(2^{vck-1}\\cdot n^{O(1)} \\cdot\nmin\\{s^2,(\\alpha(V))^2\\})$, where $tw$ represents the treewidth of the given\ngraph, $vck$ is the solution size of the Vertex Cover Knapsack, $s$ is the size\nof the knapsack and $\\alpha(V)=\\sum_{v\\in V}\\alpha(v)$. We obtained similar\nresults for other variants k-Dominating Set Knapsack and Minimal Dominating Set\nKnapsack.

    "abstract": "When studying the properties of a ring $R$, it is often useful to compare $R$\nto other rings whose properties are already known. In this paper, we define\nthree ways in which a subring $R$ might be compared to a larger ring $T$: being\nassociated, being ideal-preserving, or being locally associated. We then\nexplore how these properties of a subring might be leveraged to give\ninformation about $R$, including applications to the field of factorization. Of\nparticular interest is the result that an order in a number field is associated\nif and only if it is both ideal-preserving and locally associated. We conclude\nwith a discussion of how these properties are realized in the case of orders in\na number field and how such orders might be found.",

Building upon the\nvariance-based probing method, PRD 107, 103005, (2023), we extend this concept\nto the optical domain: a weak probe laser interacts with an EO crystal placed\ninside a resonant microwave cavity at cryogenic temperatures, and the\naxion-induced electric field is revealed through induced ellipticity. The\ninjected RF signal coherently interferes with that of the axion field,\namplifying the optical response and significantly improving sensitivity.

In\nreal-world projects, developers often rely on broader repository and\nproject-level context beyond the local code to resolve such bugs. In this\npaper, we investigate how automatically extracting and providing such knowledge\ncan improve LLM-based program repair. We propose a layered knowledge injection\nframework that incrementally augments LLMs with structured context. It starts\nwith the Bug Knowledge Layer, which includes information such as the buggy\nfunction and failing tests; expands to the Repository Knowledge Layer, which\nadds structural dependencies, related files, and commit history; and finally\ninjects the Project Knowledge Layer, which incorporates relevant details from\ndocumentation and previously fixed bugs. We evaluate this framework on a\ndataset of 314 bugs from BugsInPy using two LLMs (Llama 3.3 and GPT-4o-mini),\nand analyze fix rates across six bug types. By progressively injecting\nknowledge across layers, our approach achieves a fix rate of 79% (250/314)\nusing Llama 3.3, a significant improvement of 23% over previous work. All bug\ntypes show improvement with the addition of repository-level context, while\nonly a subset benefit further from project-level knowledge, highlighting that\ndifferent bug types require different levels of contextual information for\neffective repair. We also analyze the remaining unresolved bugs and find that\nmore complex and structurally isolated bugs, such as Program Anomaly and GUI\nbugs, remain difficult even after injecting all available information. Our\nresults show that layered context injection improves program repair and suggest\nthe need for interactive and adaptive APR systems.",

To address these challenges, we introduce CoMMiT,\nCo-informed inference of Microbiome-Metabolome Interactions via novel Transfer\nlearning models.

CoMMiT operates under the flexible assumption that auxiliary\nmetabolites are collectively informative for the target metabolite, without\nrequiring individual auxiliary metabolites to be informative. CoMMiT uses a\nnovel data-driven approach to selecting the optimal set of auxiliary\nmetabolites. Using this optimal set, CoMMiT employs a de-biasing framework to\nenable efficient calculation of p-values, facilitating the identification of\nstatistically significant microbiome-metabolome interactions.

This complexity\nincreases when comparing different age-dating methods, as they rely on distinct\nindicators and are often applicable to non-overlapping regions of the\ncolor-magnitude diagram. Moreover, many empirical calibration methods rely on\npre-determined ages, often from open clusters or asteroseismology, which only\ncover a limited parameter space. Fortunately, the age-velocity-dispersion\nrelation (AVR), in which the velocity dispersion increases with age, is a\nuniversal feature among stars of all evolutionary stages. In this paper, we 1)\nexplore the parameter space in which [C/N] and gyrochronology are applicable,\nextending beyond the domains probed by asteroseismology and open clusters, and\n2) assess whether the traditionally assumed [C/N] and gyrochronology relations\nyield ages on a consistent physical scale, after calibrating both using the\nsame AVR. We find gyrochronology can be applied to all partially convective\nstars after they have converged onto the slow rotating sequence and before they\nexperience weakened magnetic braking; [C/N] can be used to infer ages for all\ngiants with metallicity > -0.8 dex and [C/N] < -0.05 dex, and can be used as an\nage-indicator down to [Fe/H] of -1 dex if only selecting the low-$\\alpha$ disk.\nLastly, ages obtained from [C/N] and gyrochronology agree within uncertainty\nafter accounting for systematic offsets.",

Yet their real competence, whether they can make sense of the\nreal-world context, and the implications for classrooms remain unclear. We\nconducted a scoping review from a mathematics-education perspective, including\nthree parts: a technical overview, a systematic review of word problems used in\nresearch, and a state-of-the-art empirical evaluation of LLMs on mathematical\nword problems. First, in the technical overview, we contrast the\nconceptualization of word problems and their solution processes between LLMs\nand students. In computer-science research this is typically labeled\nmathematical reasoning, a term that does not align with usage in mathematics\neducation. Second, our literature review of 213 studies shows that the most\npopular word-problem corpora are dominated by s-problems, which do not require\na consideration of realities of their real-world context. Finally, our\nevaluation of GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4o-mini, GPT-4.1, o3, and GPT-5 on 287 word\nproblems shows that most recent LLMs solve these s-problems with near-perfect\naccuracy, including a perfect score on 20 problems from PISA.

Differing sensitivities to planet bulk properties between the\nmicrolensing and transit methods require relations like a planet mass-radius\nrelation (MRR) to mediate. We propose using instead a planet-host ratio\nrelation (PHRR) to couple directly microlensing and transit observables. Unlike\nthe MRR, a PHRR uses parameters that are always measured and so can leverage\nthe full Roman exoplanet sample. Using 908 confirmed exoplanets from the NASA\nExoplanet Archive, we show that transit depth, $\\delta$, and planet-host mass\nratio, $q$, obey a PHRR that is continuous over all planet scales. The PHRR is\nimproved by including orbital period, $P$, and host effective temperature,\n$T_{\\star}$. We compare several candidate PHRRs of the form $\\delta (q,T_\\star,\nP)$, with the Bayesian Information Criterion favouring power-law dependence on\n$T_\\star$ and $P$, and broken power-law dependence on $q$. The break in $q$\nitself depends on $T_\\star$, as do the power-law slopes in $q$ either side of\nthe break. The favoured PHRR achieves a fairly uniform $50\\%$ relative\nprecision in $\\delta$ for all $q$. Approximately $5\\%$ of the sample has a\ntransit depth that is strongly under-predicted by the PHRR; around half of\nthese are associated with large stars ($R_\\star > 2.5 \\, R_{\\odot}$)\npotentially subject to Malmquist bias.",

We show that simulations at 900 and 1000 K with deposition\nrates of 10$^8$ monolayers per second provide a good compromise between\ncomputational cost and accuracy. In these conditions, the ratio between the Ge\ndeposition rate and the ad-atom jump rate is analogous to that of\nout-of-equilibrium experiments. In addition, the main features of the grown\nfilm (intermixing, critical film thickness, dislocation typology, and surface\nmorphology) are well described. Our simulations reveal that dislocations\noriginate in low-density amorphous regions that form under valleys of the rough\nGe film surface. Atoms are squeezed out of these regions to the surface,\nreleasing the stress accumulated in the film and smoothing its surface.\nAmorphous regions grow until atoms begin to rearrange in dislocation half-loops\nthat propagate throughout the Ge film. The threading arm ends of the\ndislocation half-loops move along the surface following valleys and avoiding\nislands. The film surface morphology affects the propagation path of the\ndislocation half-loops and the resulting dislocation network.",

    "abstract": "Parameterized local search combines classic local search heuristics with the\nparadigm of parameterized algorithmics. While most local search algorithms aim\nto improve given solutions by performing one single operation on a given\nsolution, the parameterized approach aims to improve a solution by performing\n$k$ simultaneous operations. Herein, $k$ is a parameter called search radius\nfor which the value can be chosen by a user. One major goal in the field of\nparameterized local search is to outline the trade-off between the size of $k$\nand the running time of the local search step. In this work, we introduce an\nabstract framework that generalizes natural parameterized local search\napproaches for a large class of partitioning problems: Given $n$ items that are\npartitioned into $b$ bins and a target function that evaluates the quality of\nthe current partition, one asks whether it is possible to improve the solution\nby removing up to $k$ items from their current bins and reassigning them to\nother bins. Among others, our framework applies for the local search versions\nof problems like Cluster Editing, Vector Bin Packing, and Nash Social Welfare.\nMotivated by a real-world application of the problem Vector Bin Packing, we\nintroduce a parameter called number of types $\\tau \\le n$ and show that all\nproblems fitting in our framework can be solved in $\\tau^k 2^{O(k)} |I|^{O(1)}$\ntime, where $|I|$ denotes the total input size. In case of Cluster Editing, the\nparameter $\\tau$ generalizes the well-known parameter neighborhood diversity of\nthe input graph. We complement this by showing that for all considered\nproblems, an algorithm significantly improving over our algorithm with running\ntime $\\tau^k 2^{O(k)} |I|^{O(1)}$ would contradict the ETH. Additionally, we\nshow that even on very restricted instances, all considered problems are\nW[1]-hard when parameterized by the search radius $k$ alone.",

However, current TTA\nresearches generally suffer from major limitations such as duplication of\nbaseline results, limited evaluation metrics, inconsistent experimental\nsettings, and insufficient analysis. These problems hinder fair comparisons\nbetween TTA methods and obscure their practical strengths and weaknesses. To\naddress these challenges, we introduce TTA-VLM, a comprehensive benchmark for\nevaluating TTA methods on VLMs. Our benchmark implements 8 episodic TTA and 7\nonline TTA methods within a unified and reproducible framework, and evaluates\nthem across 15 widely used datasets. Unlike prior studies focused solely on\nCLIP, we extend the evaluation to SigLIP--a model trained with a Sigmoid\nloss--and include training-time tuning methods such as CoOp, MaPLe, and TeCoA\nto assess generality. Beyond classification accuracy, TTA-VLM incorporates\nvarious evaluation metrics, including robustness, calibration,\nout-of-distribution detection, and stability, enabling a more holistic\nassessment of TTA methods. Through extensive experiments, we find that 1)\nexisting TTA methods produce limited gains compared to the previous pioneering\nwork; 2) current TTA methods exhibit poor collaboration with training-time\nfine-tuning methods; 3) accuracy gains frequently come at the cost of reduced\nmodel trustworthiness.

However, existing\ntechniques primarily focus on evaluating ADS functionalities in single-AV\nsettings. As ADSs are increasingly deployed in multi-AV traffic, it becomes\ncrucial to assess their cooperative performance, particularly regarding\ndeadlocks, a fundamental coordination failure in which multiple AVs enter a\ncircular waiting state indefinitely, resulting in motion planning failures.\nDespite its importance, the cooperative capability of ADSs to prevent deadlocks\nremains insufficiently underexplored. To address this gap, we propose the first\ndedicated Spatio-Temporal Conflict-Guided Deadlock Avoidance Testing technique,\nSTCLocker, for generating DeadLock Scenarios (DLSs), where a group of AVs\ncontrolled by the ADS under test are in a circular wait state. STCLocker\nconsists of three key components: Deadlock Oracle, Conflict Feedback, and\nConflict-aware Scenario Generation. Deadlock Oracle provides a reliable\nblack-box mechanism for detecting deadlock cycles among multiple AVs within a\ngiven scenario. Conflict Feedback and Conflict-aware Scenario Generation\ncollaborate to actively guide AVs into simultaneous competition over spatial\nconflict resources (i.e., shared passing regions) and temporal competitive\nbehaviors (i.e., reaching the conflict region at the same time), thereby\nincreasing the effectiveness of generating conflict-prone deadlocks. We\nevaluate STCLocker on two types of ADSs: Roach, an end-to-end ADS, and OpenCDA,\na module-based ADS supporting cooperative communication.

Critically, I demonstrate how the research outputs of\nthis thesis are useful for effectively learning from limited amounts of\nscientific text in order to identify misinformative scientific statements and\ngenerate new insights into the science communication process",

The microscopic basis of this\nphenomenon remains elusive and continues to be widely debated. One of the key\ndriving forces invoked are the specific properties of the air-water interface\nincluding the presence of large electric fields and distinct solvation at the\nsurface. Here, using a combination of classical molecular dynamics simulations,\nthe chemical physics of solvation, and unsupervised learning approaches, we\nplace these assumptions under close scrutiny. Using phenol as a model system,\nwe demonstrate that the electric field at the surface of water is not anomalous\nor unique compared to bulk water conditions. Furthermore, the electric field\nfluctuations de-correlate on a timescale of ~10 ps implying that their role in\nactivating much slower chemical reactions remains inconclusive. We deploy a\nrecently developed unsupervised learning approach, dubbed information balance,\nwhich detects in an agnostic fashion the relationship between the electric\nfield and solvation collective variables. It turns out that the electric field\non the hydroxyl group of the phenol is mostly determined by phenol hydration\nincluding the proximity and orientation of nearby water molecules. We caution\nthat the growing attention of the role that electric fields have garnered in\nenhancing chemical reactivity at the air-water interface, may not reflect their\nactual importance.",

    "abstract": "We prove that the two cornerstones of mean-field spin glass theory -- the\nParisi variational formula and the ultrametric organization of pure states --\nbreak down under heavy-tailed disorder. For the mixed spherical $p$-spin model\nwhose couplings have tail exponent $\\alpha<2$, we attach to each $p$ an\nexplicit threshold $H_p^{*}$. If any coupling exceeds its threshold, a single\ndominant monomial governs both the limiting free energy and the entire Gibbs\nmeasure; the resulting energy landscape is intrinsically probabilistic, with a\nsharp failure of ultrametricity for $p\\ge4$ and persistence of only a\ndegenerate 1-RSB structure for $p\\le3$. When all couplings remain below their\nthresholds, the free energy is $O(n^{-1})$ and the overlap is near zero,\nresulting in a trivial Gibbs geometry. For $\\alpha<1$ we further obtain exact\nfluctuations of order $n^{1-p}$.

Traditional frameworks integrating\nsemantic tokens with flow matching (FM) struggle with streaming capabilities\ndue to their reliance on a global receptive field. Additionally, directly\nimplementing token-by-token streaming speech generation often results in\ndegraded audio quality. To address these challenges, we propose StreamFlow, a\nnovel neural architecture that facilitates streaming flow matching with\ndiffusion transformers (DiT). To mitigate the long-sequence extrapolation\nissues arising from lengthy historical dependencies, we design a local\nblock-wise receptive field strategy. Specifically, the sequence is first\nsegmented into blocks, and we introduce block-wise attention masks that enable\nthe current block to receive information from the previous or subsequent block.\nThese attention masks are combined hierarchically across different DiT-blocks\nto regulate the receptive field of DiTs. Both subjective and objective\nexperimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves performance\ncomparable to non-streaming methods while surpassing other streaming methods in\nterms of speech quality, all the while effectively managing inference time\nduring long-sequence generation.

Ensuring robust encryption for sensitive\ninformation is critical for systems' compliance with security standards.\nAlthough holistic database encryption provides strong protection, existing\ndatabase systems often require a complete backup and restore cycle, resulting\nin prolonged downtime and increased storage usage. This makes it difficult to\nimplement online encryption techniques in high-throughput environments without\ndisrupting critical operations.\n  To address this challenge, we envision a solution that enables online\ndatabase encryption aligned with system activity, eliminating the need for\ndowntime, storage overhead, or full-database reprocessing. Central to this\nvision is the ability to predict which parts of the database will be accessed\nnext, allowing encryption to be applied online. As a step towards this\nsolution, this study proposes a predictive approach that leverages deep\nlearning models to forecast database lock sequences, using IBM Db2 as the\ndatabase system under study. In this study, we collected a specialized dataset\nfrom TPC-C benchmark workloads, leveraging lock event logs for model training\nand evaluation. We applied deep learning architectures, such as Transformer and\nLSTM, to evaluate models for various table-level and page-level lock\npredictions. We benchmark the accuracy of the trained models versus a Naive\nBaseline across different prediction horizons and timelines.\n  The study experiments demonstrate that the proposed deep learning-based\nmodels achieve up to 49% average accuracy for table-level and 66% for\npage-level predictions, outperforming a Naive Baseline.

Two research questions are addressed: (1) whether explanation\ncomplexity varies across different relevance ranges, and (2) whether\nexplanation complexity remains consistent under image augmentations such as\nrotation and noise. The results confirm that for our experiments higher concept\nrelevance leads to shorter, less complex explanations, while lower relevance\nresults in longer, more diffuse explanations.

    "abstract": "In a pure Gaussian tripartition, a range of entanglement between two parties\n($AB$) can be purified through classical communication of Gaussian measurements\nperformed within the third ($C$). To begin, this work introduces a direct\nmethod to calculate a hierarchic series of projective $C$ measurements for the\nremoval of any $AB$ Gaussian noise, circumventing divergences in prior\nprotocols. Next, a multimode conic framework is developed for pursuing the\nmaximum (Gaussian entanglement of assistance, GEOA) or minimum (Gaussian\nentanglement of formation, GEOF) pure entanglement that may be revealed or\nrequired between $AB$. Within this framework, a geometric necessary and\nsufficient entanglement condition emerges as a doubly-enclosed conic volume,\ndefining a novel distance metric for conic optimization. Extremizing this\ndistance for spacelike vacuum entanglement in the massless and massive free\nscalar fields yields (1) the highest known lower bound to GEOA, the first that\nremains asymptotically constant with increasing vacuum separation and (2) the\nlowest known upper bound to GEOF, the first that decays exponentially mirroring\nthe mixed $AB$ negativity. Furthermore, combination of the above with a\ngeneralization of previous partially-transposed noise filtering techniques\nallows calculation of a single $C$ measurement that maximizes the purified $AB$\nentanglement. Beyond expectation that these behaviors of spacelike GEOA and\nGEOF persist in interacting theories, the present measurement and optimization\ntechniques are applicable to physical many-body Gaussian states beyond quantum\nfields.",

This paper\naddresses this gap by explicitly incorporating in-waveguide attenuation into\nboth the system model and algorithm design, and studying its impact on the\ndownlink user data rates. We begin with a single-user scenario and derive a\nclosed-form expression for the globally optimal antenna placement, which\nreveals how the attenuation coefficient and the user-to-waveguide distance\njointly affect the optimal antenna position. Based on this analytical solution,\nwe further provide a theoretical analysis identifying the system conditions\nunder which the in-waveguide attenuation has an insignificant impact on the\nuser achievable rate. The study is then extended to the multi-user\nmultiple-input multiple-output setting, where two efficient algorithms are\ndeveloped, based on the weighted minimum mean square error method and the\nmaximum ratio combining method, to jointly optimize beamforming and antenna\nplacement. Simulation results validate the efficacy of the proposed algorithms\nand demonstrate that pinching-antenna systems substantially outperform\nconventional fixed-antenna baselines, underscoring their potential for future\nflexible wireless communications.",

However, these benefits remain out of\nreach if rule extraction is manual or solely reliant on ML, as both approaches\nyield incomplete, unreliable, and/or inaccurate rules.\n  This paper formulates rule extraction as a constraint modeling problem and\nintroduces NetNomos that learns propositional logic constraints directly from\nraw network measurements. Constraint modeling in this domain is uniquely\nchallenging due to the scale of the data, the inherent learning complexity and\npassive environment, and the lack of ground truth supervision. NetNomos\naddresses these challenges via a lattice-based search structured by constraint\nspecificity and succinctness.

Solving the Lorentz endpoint leads us to a two-weight\nSawyer-type inequality, for which we give a sufficient condition.

    "abstract": "Autonomous Driving Systems (ADSs) continue to face safety-critical risks due\nto the inherent limitations in their design and performance capabilities.\nOnline repair plays a crucial role in mitigating such limitations, ensuring the\nruntime safety and reliability of ADSs. Existing online repair solutions\nenforce ADS compliance by transforming unacceptable trajectories into\nacceptable ones based on predefined specifications, such as rule-based\nconstraints or training datasets. However, these approaches often lack\ngeneralizability, adaptability and tend to be overly conservative, resulting in\nineffective repairs that not only fail to mitigate safety risks sufficiently\nbut also degrade the overall driving experience. To address this issue, we\npropose Adaptive Decision Repair (ADReFT), a novel and effective repair method\nthat identifies safety-critical states through offline learning from failed\ntests and generates appropriate mitigation actions to improve ADS safety.\nSpecifically, ADReFT incorporates a transformer-based model with two joint\nheads, State Monitor and Decision Adapter, designed to capture complex driving\nenvironment interactions to evaluate state safety severity and generate\nadaptive repair actions. Given the absence of oracles for state safety\nidentification, we first pretrain ADReFT using supervised learning with coarse\nannotations, i.e., labeling states preceding violations as positive samples and\nothers as negative samples. It establishes ADReFT's foundational capability to\nmitigate safety-critical violations, though it may result in somewhat\nconservative mitigation strategies. Therefore, we subsequently finetune ADReFT\nusing reinforcement learning to improve its initial capability and generate\nmore precise and contextually appropriate repair decisions. Our evaluation\nresults illustrate that ADReFT achieves better repair performance.",

The model are then used to\nrender each stabilized frame. We utilize a scene extrapolation module to avoid\nframe cropping. Our method is evaluated on a repurposed dataset, instilled with\n3D-grounded information, covering samples with diverse camera motions and scene\ndynamics. Quantitatively, our method is competitive with or superior to\nstate-of-the-art 2D and 2.5D approaches in terms of conventional task metrics\nand new geometry consistency.

    "abstract": "The search for candidate materials for fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) has\nmainly focused on the topological and geometrical structures of single-particle\nChern bands. However, there are inherent limitations in approaches that neglect\ninteraction effects, highlighting the need for complementary methods. In this\nwork, we discuss how the Chern number defined for the effective interaction\nprojected onto a Chern band is related to the stabilization of FCIs.\nSpecifically, by formulating both the effective interaction and the\ntwo-particle problem using a common matrix, we establish a connection between\nthe two-particle band structure and the effective interaction. This formulation\nallows us to characterize the effective interaction through the topology of the\ntwo-particle band. To investigate the relationship between topological\neffective interactions and FCIs, we perform numerical calculations primarily\nbased on exact diagonalization. We find a notable correlation between the fact\nthat the dominant two-particle bands carry a unit Chern number and the\nrealization of a robust FCI at the filling fraction $\\nu = 1/3$. This result is\nconsistent with the presumed correspondence between pseudopotentials in the\nfractional quantum Hall effect and the two-particle band structure. From\nanother perspective, our findings suggest that the topology inherent in the\ninteraction itself can obstruct trivial ground states. We also discuss this in\nthe context of scattering channels. Extending such topological two-body\ninteractions could pave the way for realizing exotic states beyond FCIs.",

The main challenge in the\nconstruction and analysis of time-discrete numerical schemes is caused by a\ndrift that blows up at the origin, highly nonlinear drift and diffusion\ncoefficients and positivity-preserving requirement. Due to the presence of the\nPoisson jumps, additional difficulties arise in recovering the exact order\n$1/2$ of convergence for the time-stepping schemes. By incorporating\nimplicitness in the term $\\alpha_{-1}x^{-1} $ and introducing the modifications\nfunctions $f_h$ and $g_h$ in the recursion, a novel explicit Euler-type scheme\nis proposed, which is easy to implement and preserves the positivity of the\noriginal model unconditionally, i.e., for any time step-size $h>0$. A\nmean-square convergence rate of order $1/2$ is established for the proposed\nscheme in both the non-critical and general critical cases. Finally, numerical\nexperiments are provided to confirm the theoretical findings.",

The most common frameworks for analyzing stability\nchanges, however, require stationary (trend- and seasonality-free) data, which\nnecessitates error-prone data pre-processing. Here we propose a novel method of\nquantifying system stability based on eigenvalue tracking and Floquet\nMultipliers, which can be applied directly to diverse data without first\nremoving trend and seasonality, and is robust to changing noise levels, as can\nbe caused by merging signals from different sensors.

We then show that our\nmethod can be extended to analyze spatio-temporal data and illustrate this\nflexibility with remotely sensed Amazon rainforest vegetation productivity,\nhighlighting the spatial patterns of whole-ecosystem destabilization. Our work\napplies critical slowing down theory to glacier dynamics for the first time,\nand provides a novel and flexible method to quantify the stability or\nresilience of a wide range of spatiotemporal systems, including climate\nsubsystems, ecosystems, and transient landforms.",

    "abstract": "Non-perturbative high-harmonic generation (HHG) has recently been observed in\nthe liquid phase, where it was demonstrated to have a different physical\nmechanism compared to gas and solid phases of matter. The currently best\nphysical picture for liquid HHG eliminates scattered-electron contributions and\nidentifies on-site recombination as the dominant contributor. This mechanism\naccurately predicts the cut-off energy and its independence of the driving\nlaser wavelength and intensity. However, this implies that additional energy\nabsorbed in the liquid as the driving laser intensity is increased does not\nresult in higher-order non-linearities, which is in contrast to the\nconventional expectation from most nonlinear media. Here we experimentally\nobserve the formation of a second plateau in HHG from multiple liquids (water,\nheavy water, propranol, and ethanol), thus explaining the conundrum of the\nmissing higher-order response. We analyze this second plateau with a\ncombination of experimental, state-of-the-art ab-initio numerical (in diverse\nsystems of water, ammonia, and liquid methane), and semi-classical analytical,\ntechniques, and elucidate its physical origin to electrons that recombine on\nneighboring water molecules rather than at the ionization site, leading to\nunique HHG ellipticity dependence. Remarkably, we find that the second plateau\nis dominated by electrons recombining at the second solvation shell, relying on\nwide hole delocalization. Theory also predicts the appearance of even higher\nplateaus, indicating a general trend. Our work establishes new physical\nphenomena in the highly non-linear optical response of liquids, paving the way\nto attosecond probing of electron dynamics in solutions.",

    "abstract": "A linear layout of a graph consists of a linear ordering of its vertices and\na partition of its edges into pages such that the edges assigned to the same\npage obey some constraint. The two most prominent and widely studied types of\nlinear layouts are stack and queue layouts, in which any two edges assigned to\nthe same page are forbidden to cross and nest, respectively. The names of these\ntwo layouts derive from the fact that, when parsing the graph according to the\nlinear vertex ordering, the edges in a single page can be stored using a single\nstack or queue, respectively. Recently, the concepts of stack and queue layouts\nhave been extended by using a double-ended queue or a restricted-input queue\nfor storing the edges of a page. We extend this line of study to edge-weighted\ngraphs by introducing priority queue layouts, that is, the edges on each page\nare stored in a priority queue whose keys are the edge weights. First, we show\nthat there are edge-weighted graphs that require a linear number of priority\nqueues. Second, we characterize the graphs that admit a priority queue layout\nwith a single queue, regardless of the edge-weight function, and we provide an\nefficient recognition algorithm. Third, we show that the number of priority\nqueues required independently of the edge-weight function is bounded by the\npathwidth of the graph, but can be arbitrarily large already for graphs of\ntreewidth two. Finally, we prove that determining the minimum number of\npriority queues is NP-complete if the linear ordering of the vertices is fixed.",

In this work, we identify the\nunderlying issue as the proprioception shift problem, where the distributions\nof proprioceptive states diverge significantly between training and deployment.\nTo address this challenge, we propose a domain adaptation framework that\nbridges the gap by utilizing rollout data collected during deployment. Using\nWasserstein distance, we quantify the discrepancy between expert and rollout\nproprioceptive states and minimize this gap by adding noise to both sets of\nstates, proportional to the Wasserstein distance. This strategy enhances\nrobustness against proprioception shifts by aligning the training and\ndeployment distributions.

Intermittent processes include turbulence, convection,\nprecipitation patterns, as well as several in plasma physics, medicine,\nneuroscience, and economics. Traditionally, focus has been on global\nstatistical indicators, e.g. the average frequency of regime changes under\nfixed conditions, or how these vary as a function of the system's parameters.\nWe add a local perspective: we study the causes and drivers of the regime\nchanges in real time, with the ultimate goal of predicting them. Using five\ndifferent systems, of various complexities, we identify indicators and\nprecursors of regime transitions that are common across the different\nintermittency mechanisms and dynamical models. For all the systems and\nintermittency types under study, we find a correlation between the alignment of\nsome Lyapunov vectors and the concomitant, or aftermath, regime change. We\ndiscovered peculiar behaviors in the Lorenz 96 and in the Kuramoto-Shivanshinki\nmodels. In Lorenz 96 we identified crisis-induced intermittency with laminar\nintermissions, while in the Kuramoto-Shivanshinki we detected a spatially\nglobal intermittency which follows the scaling of type-I intermittency.

To our\nknowledge, this work represents the first exploration of optimizing\nquantization layer-wise bit-width in the inference serving system, by\nintroducing theoretical measurement of accuracy degradation. Simulation results\ndemonstrate a substantial reduction in overall time and power consumption, with\ncomputation payloads decreasing by over 80% and accuracy degradation kept below\n1%.",

To address these theoretical inconsistencies, alternative\nmodels, collectively known as exotic compact objects, have been proposed. In\nthis paper, we investigate the potential detectability of signatures associated\nwith non-rotating exotic compact objects within the Sgr~A* polarized flares\ndataset, as observed through GRAVITY and future instruments. We examine a total\nof eight distinct metrics, originating from four different categories of static\nand spherically symmetric compact objects: Black Holes, Boson stars, Fluid\nspheres, and Gravastars. Our approach involves utilizing a toy model that\norbits the compact object in the equatorial plane, at the\nSchwarzschild-Keplerian velocity. Using simulated astrometric and polarimetric\ndata with present GRAVITY and future GRAVITY+ uncertainties, we fit the\ndatasets across all metrics examined. We evaluated the detectability of the\nmetric for each dataset based on the resulting $\\chi^2_\\mathrm{red}$ and\nBIC-based Bayes factors. Plunge-through images of ECOs affect polarization and\nastrometry. With GRAVITY's present uncertainties, only a compact boson-star\nmodel is discernible. GRAVITY+'s improved sensitivity allows detection of most\nexotic compact object models. However, enhancing the astrophysical complexity\nof the hot spot model diminishes these outcomes. Presently, GRAVITY's\nuncertainties limit us to detecting just one exotic compact object metric. With\nGRAVITY+'s enhanced sensitivity, we can expect to uncover additional exotic\ncompact object models and use Sgr~A* as a laboratory for fundamental physics.",

Recent progress in hate speech detection is\ntypically concentrated on high-resource languages. However, low-resource\nlanguages still face significant challenges due to the lack of large-scale,\nhigh-quality datasets. This paper investigates how we can overcome this\nlimitation via prompt engineering on large language models (LLMs) focusing on\nlow-resource Bengali language. We investigate six prompting strategies -\nzero-shot prompting, refusal suppression, flattering the classifier, multi-shot\nprompting, role prompting, and finally our innovative metaphor prompting to\ndetect hate speech effectively in low-resource languages. We pioneer the\nmetaphor prompting to circumvent the built-in safety mechanisms of LLMs that\nmarks a significant departure from existing jailbreaking methods. We\ninvestigate all six different prompting strategies on the Llama2-7B model and\ncompare the results extensively with three pre-trained word embeddings - GloVe,\nWord2Vec, and FastText for three different deep learning models - multilayer\nperceptron (MLP), convolutional neural network (CNN), and bidirectional gated\nrecurrent unit (BiGRU). To prove the effectiveness of our metaphor prompting in\nthe low-resource Bengali language, we also evaluate it in another low-resource\nlanguage - Hindi, and two high-resource languages - English and German.

    "abstract": "Here, we outline how Rothman diagrams provide a geometric perspective that\ncan help epidemiologists understand the relationships between effect measure\nmodification (which we call association measure modification), collapsibility,\nand confounding. A Rothman diagram plots the risk of disease in the unexposed\non the x-axis and the risk in the exposed on the y-axis. Crude and\nstratum-specific risks in the two exposure groups define points in the unit\nsquare. When there is modification of a measure of association $M$ by a\ncovariate $C$, the stratum-specific values of $M$ differ across strata defined\nby $C$, so the stratum-specific points are on different contour lines of $M$.\nWe show how collapsibility can be defined in terms of standardization instead\nof no confounding, and we show that a measure of association is collapsible if\nand only if all its contour lines are straight. We illustrate these ideas using\ndata from a study in Newcastle, United Kingdom, where the causal effect of\nsmoking on 20-year mortality was confounded by age. From this perspective, it\nis clear that association measure modification and collapsibility are logically\nindependent of confounding.

We conducted high-resolution grating spectroscopy to identify potential\nsoft X-ray absorption and emission features. To measure the hot corona\ntemperatures from the spectral analysis above 3 keV, we also included data from\na previous NuSTAR observation from June 2015. We characterised the disc-corona\nsystem properties by analysing the broadband spectra and the SED from UV to\nhard X-rays. 1H 0419-577 was observed in a bare-like high-flux state at both\nepochs, with negligible neutral and ionised absorption along its line of sight\nat both Galactic and AGN rest-frames. However, several soft X-ray emission\nlines were detected, notably a broad and intense OVII line indicating an\naccretion disc origin at only a few tens of gravitational radii. The broadband\nX-ray spectra revealed a prominent, absorption-free smooth soft X-ray excess, a\nweak Fe Kalpha complex, and a lack of a Compton hump. Fitting data above 3 keV\nyielded apparent moderate hot corona temperatures of ~20-30 keV for the 2018\nand 2015 observations, depending on the model applied. The 2018 X-ray broadband\nspectra were well reproduced by either a relativistic reflection model with a\nhigh-density accretion disc (~10^18 cm^-2), or a hybrid model combining warm\nand hot coronae with relativistic reflection. We performed the SED analysis for\nthe latter scenario, which indicated that both the hot and warm coronae would\nhave a small spatial extent. Both scenarios can successfully reproduce the two\n2018 observations of 1H 0419-577, but they imply very different physical\nconditions, for example, in terms of disc density, temperature and accretion\npower released in the hot corona and the origin of the UV emission.",

With advances in aerospace\nengineering and micro/nano-scale technologies, gas flows exhibit the\ncoexistence of rarefied and continuum/near-continuum regimes, which calls for\nlarger time steps and coarser spatial grids for efficient numerical simulation.\nHowever, the mesh sizes and time steps in DSMC are constrained by the\nsingle-scale nature of the Boltzmann equation and the explicit treatment of\ncollision term following operator splitting. To overcome the resulting\ncomputational inefficiency, the Time-Relaxed Monte Carlo (TRMC) method\nintroduces a suitable time discretization of the Boltzmann equation, allowing\nfor significantly larger time steps. Besides, domain decomposition methods\nleverage the complementary strengths of continuum and particle-based\napproaches, facilitating the efficient simulation of multi-scale gas flows.\nHowever, in TRMC method, the physically accurate high-order terms are truncated\nand approximated through convergence to a local Maxwellian distribution.\nMeanwhile, the continuum breakdown criteria employed in hybrid methods are\neither empirical or semi-empirical. Recently, a timescale-based decomposition\nof the Boltzmann equation has been proposed to enable a more rational coupling\nbetween DSMC and Navier-Stokes. Inspired by this strategy, a novel hybrid\nparticle method is proposed to couple the stochastic particle Shakhov with\nDSMC, in which the collision operator is decomposed into two sub-steps based on\nlocal observation timescale and the relaxation time. The validity and accuracy\nof the proposed method are demonstrated through a series of benchmark cases,\nincluding 1-D sod shock tube, 2-D hypersonic flow around cylinder and jet\nexpansion into the vacuum, 3-D hypersonic flows around sphere and X-38 like\nvehicle in near-continuum flow regimes.",

In many experiments, especially in shock physics, radiography is the\nprimary means of observing the system of interest. However, radiography does\nnot provide direct access to key state variables, such as density, which\nprevents the application of traditional parameter estimation approaches. Here\nwe focus on flyer plate impact experiments on porous materials, and resolving\nthe underlying parameterized equation of state (EoS) and crush porosity model\nparameters given radiographic observation(s). We use machine learning as a tool\nto demonstrate with high confidence that using only high impact velocity data\ndoes not provide sufficient information to accurately infer both EoS and crush\nmodel parameters, even with fully resolved density fields or a dynamic sequence\nof images. We thus propose an observable data set consisting of low and high\nimpact velocity experiments/simulations that capture different regimes of\ncompaction and shock propagation, and proceed to introduce a generative machine\nlearning approach which produces a posterior distribution of physical\nparameters directly from radiographs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the\napproach in estimating parameters from simulated flyer plate impact\nexperiments, and show that the obtained estimates of EoS and crush model\nparameters can then be used in hydrodynamic simulations to obtain accurate and\nphysically admissible density reconstructions. Finally, we examine the\nrobustness of the approach to model mismatches, and find that the learned\napproach can provide useful parameter estimates in the presence of\nout-of-distribution radiographic noise and previously unseen physics, thereby\npromoting a potential breakthrough in estimating material properties from\nexperimental radiographic images.",

The dataset includes 14 malware types and 17 malware families, and was\nprocessed using a unified feature extraction pipeline based on static analysis,\nparticularly extracting features from Portable Executable headers, to support\nadvanced classification tasks.

In the binary classification of malware versus benign\nsamples, Random Forest and XGBoost achieved high accuracy on the full datasets,\nreaching 98.5% for type-based detection and 98.98% for family-based detection.\nWhen using truncated datasets of 1,000 samples to assess performance under\nlimited data conditions, both models still performed strongly, achieving 97.6%\nfor type-based detection and 98.66% for family-based detection. For interclass\nclassification, which distinguishes between malware types or families, the\nmodels reached up to 97.5% accuracy on type-level tasks and up to 93.7% on\nfamily-level tasks.

    "abstract": "A social norm defines what is good and what is bad in social contexts, as\nwell as what to do based on such assessments. A stable social norm should be\nmaintained against errors committed by its players. In addition, individuals\nmay have different probabilities of errors in following the norm, and a social\nnorm would be unstable if it benefited those who do not follow the norm\ncarefully. In this work, we show that Simple Standing, which has been known to\nresist errors and mutants successfully, actually exhibits threshold behavior.\nThat is, in a population of individuals playing the donation game according to\nSimple Standing, the residents can suppress the invasion of mutants with higher\nerror proneness only if the residents' own error proneness is sufficiently low.\nOtherwise, the population will be invaded by mutants that commit assessment\nerrors more frequently, and a series of such invasions will eventually\nundermine the existing social norm. This study suggests that the stability\nanalysis of a social norm may have a different picture if the probability of\nerror itself is regarded as an individual attribute.",

In this work, we propose\nMMV-RAM, a computational model tailored to matrix multiplication accelerators.\nMMV-RAM judiciously extends the Vector-RAM model with an additional processing\nunit that multiplies two matrices of sizes $n\\times s$ and $s\\times s$ in a\nsingle parallel step, where $s$ is a model parameter. We provide a detailed\ntheoretical analysis of the model, and carefully balance the computational\npower between the matrix and vector units, guided by the circuit complexity\nlower bound that parity is not in AC[0].\n  In MMV-RAM, we study algorithms for segmented scan and sum, two fundamental\nparallel primitives. We propose a segmented scan algorithm that uses matrix\nmultiplications to perform speculative block-scan computations, which runs in\n$O(\\log_s(n))$ steps. In contrast, we show that any algorithm that uses only\nthe vector unit of MMV-RAM requires\n$\\Omega\\left(\\frac{\\log_2(n)}{\\log_2\\log_2(n)}\\right)$ steps.

In many applications, the\nunknown parameter is high-dimensional, making computation of the posterior\nexpensive due to the need to sample in a high-dimensional space and the need to\nevaluate an expensive high-dimensional forward model relating the unknown\nparameter to the data. However, inverse problems often exhibit low-dimensional\nstructure due to the fact that the available data are only informative in a\nlow-dimensional subspace of the parameter space. Dimension reduction approaches\nexploit this structure by restricting inference to the low-dimensional subspace\ninformed by the data, which can be sampled more efficiently.

    "abstract": "The low equilibrium temperatures of temperate sub-Neptunes lead to extremely\nlong chemical timescales in their upper atmospheres, causing the abundances of\nchemical species to be strongly shaped by atmospheric transport. Here, we used\na three-dimensional (3D) general circulation model involving a passive tracer\nto investigate the atmospheric circulation and 3D transport of temperate\ngas-rich sub-Neptunes, using K2-18b as an example. We model K2-18b as a\nsynchronous or asynchronous rotator, exploring spin-orbit resonances (SOR) of\n2:1, 6:1, and 10:1. We find that the strong absorption of CO$_2$ and CH$_4$\ninduces a detached convective zone between 1 and 5 bar, resulting in strong\nvertical mixing at these levels. The upper atmosphere is dominated by eastward\nwinds (an equatorial superrotating jet present in all simulations), leading to\nwarmer evening terminators and approximately 20% higher passive tracer mass\nmixing ratios compared to the morning terminators. Rotation rates have minimal\nimpact on the strength of global mean vertical mixing, but significantly\ninfluence the latitudinal distribution of passive tracers. For synchronous, 2:1\nSOR, and 6:1 SOR simulations, passive tracers are more abundant in the\nupwelling branches at latitudes within 60$^\\circ$, while for the 10:1 SOR\nsimulation, strong transient eddies at high latitudes (>70$^\\circ$) between 0.1\nto 1 bar can transport passive tracers upward from the deep atmosphere, making\nthem more abundant there, despite their alignment with the downwelling branch\nof the large-scale circulation. This study focuses on the atmospheric dynamics\nand its influence on passive tracer transport, while a follow-up paper will\nincorporate active chemical species.",

    "abstract": "Avalanche models running in a self-organized critical regime have proven\npowerful in reproducing the power-law distributions and scale invariance that\ncharacterize the statistical properties of solar flares. They are often\ninterpreted as representing an individual active region of the Sun. As a\nresult, this class of models has rarely been applied to describe sympathetic\nflares $\\unicode{x2014}$ solar eruptions that occur in close spatial and\ntemporal proximity, seemingly driven by their mutual interaction. In this\nstudy, we investigate the phenomenon of sympathetic flaring using avalanche\nmodels and compare their statistical properties with observations of\nsympathetic flares on the Sun. We developed a novel avalanche model featuring\ntwo connected lattices, each representing a distinct active region. This\nconnectivity allows the transfer of nodal variable between the lattices,\nsimulating the non-local effects expected to occur during sympathetic flares.\nOur results show that under strong connectivity, the lattices exhibit temporal\nsynchronization, with correlations between their avalanche energies.\nFurthermore, increasing the connectivity between the lattices results in an\nexcess of avalanches at short waiting times. A quantitative comparison with\nobservational data suggests that only a weak connectivity allows our model to\nreplicate the observed solar waiting time distributions. Consequently, we\npropose that if magnetic connectivity between distinct active regions drives\nsympathetic flaring on the Sun, it must remain relatively weak.",

Unlike traditional static prompting methods, MAPS employs an\niterative refinement process. Initially, the model generates a solution using\nCoT prompting. When errors are detected, an adaptive self-reflection mechanism\nidentifies and analyzes them, generating tailored prompts to guide corrections.\nThese dynamically adjusted prompts enable the model to iteratively refine its\nreasoning. Experiments on four well-established benchmarks across multiple LLMs\nshow that MAPS significantly outperforms standard CoT and achieves competitive\nresults with reasoning-optimized models. In addition, MAPS enables\ngeneral-purpose LLMs to reach performance levels comparable to specialized\nreasoning models. While deeper reflection layers improve accuracy, they also\nincrease token usage and costs. To balance this trade-off, MAPS strategically\nlimits reflection depth, ensuring an optimal balance between cost and reasoning\nperformance.",

The effectiveness of the trained CNN is\ndemonstrated through fitting the spectral energy distributions of two prominent\nblazars, TXS 0506+059 and PKS 0735+178, both associated with IceCube neutrino\ndetections. The modeling is conducted under assumptions of constant neutrino\nflux across distinct energy ranges, as well as by adopting a fitting that\nincorporates the expected neutrino event count through a Poisson likelihood\nmethod.

We investigate which information on the magnetic fields of\ncoronal bright points (CBP) can be gained from the intensity and polarization\nof the Fe XIII 10747 A, Fe XIV 5303 A, Si X 14301 A, and Si IX 39343 A\nforbidden lines. We apply the P-CORONA synthesis code to a CBP model in the\nvery low corona, obtained with the Bifrost code, and to a larger global model\nto study the impact of the outer coronal material along the line of sight\n(LoS). The enhanced density within the CBP produces an intensity brightening,\nbut suppresses the linear polarization. The circular polarization from such\nregions often approaches 0.1% of the intensity. The contribution from the\ncoronal material along the LoS depends strongly on its temperature, and is\nweaker for lines with a peak response at higher temperatures (Fe10747 at 1.7\nMK; Fe5303 at 2 MK). The weak field approximation (WFA) provides information on\nthe longitudinal magnetic fields in the strongest-emitting spatial intervals\nalong the LoS, and is more reliable in the regions of the CBP where the field\ndoes not change sign. This tends to coincide with the regions where there is a\nstrong correlation between the circular polarization and the wavelength\nderivative of the intensity. Considering roughly 30 minutes of time evolution,\nthe CBP signals are somewhat attenuated but are still identifiable, while the\narea where the WFA can be suitably applied remains substantial. The circular\npolarization of the Fe5303 and especially Fe10747 lines are valuable\ndiagnostics for the magnetic fields in the higher-temperature regions of the\nCBP, which could be exploited with future coronagraphs with similar\ncapabilities to Cryo-NIRSP/DKIST, but designed to observe below 1.05 solar\nradii.",

Conventional quality control\napproaches, reliant on manually defined thresholds and features, lack\nadaptability to the complexity and variability inherent in production data and\nnecessitate extensive domain expertise.

This paper introduces a\nmethodology for industrial fault detection, which is both data-driven and\ntransparent. The approach integrates a supervised machine learning model for\nmulti-class fault classification, Shapley Additive Explanations for post-hoc\ninterpretability, and a do-main-specific visualisation technique that maps\nmodel explanations to operator-interpretable features. Furthermore, the study\nproposes an evaluation methodology that assesses model explanations through\nquantitative perturbation analysis and evaluates visualisations by qualitative\nexpert assessment. The approach was applied to the crimping process, a\nsafety-critical joining technique, using a dataset of univariate, discrete time\nseries. The system achieves a fault detection accuracy of 95.9 %, and both\nquantitative selectivity analysis and qualitative expert evaluations confirmed\nthe relevance and inter-pretability of the generated explanations.

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the approximation of the local volatility function in\nthe Cheyette interest rate model. Its main contribution is an explicit\nanalytical formula for approximating local volatility, derived by extending the\nclassical Dupire framework to interest rate models. In particular, an implicit\nDupire-like expression for local volatility is first derived for options\nwritten on the short rate. This expression is then approximated using a\ncombination of perturbation methods and probabilistic techniques, resulting in\na formula expressed in terms of time and strike derivatives of the Bachelier\nimplied variance. The final formula naturally extends to multi-factor Cheyette\nmodels and provides a practical tool for model calibration.",

The proposed pipeline first trains a Transformer on a mixture\nof target sequences arranged in different orders and then identifies benign\norders as those with fast loss drops in the early stage. As the search space\ngrows factorially with sequence length, we propose a two-stage hierarchical\napproach for inter- and intra-block reordering.

    "abstract": "In music information retrieval (MIR), contrastive self-supervised learning\nfor general-purpose representation models is effective for global tasks such as\nautomatic tagging. However, for local tasks such as chord estimation, it is\nwidely assumed that contrastively trained general-purpose self-supervised\nmodels are inadequate and that more sophisticated SSL is necessary; e.g.,\nmasked modeling. Our paper challenges this assumption by revealing the\npotential of contrastive SSL paired with a transformer in local MIR tasks. We\nconsider a lightweight vision transformer with one-dimensional patches in the\ntime--frequency domain (ViT-1D) and train it with simple contrastive SSL\nthrough normalized temperature-scaled cross-entropy loss (NT-Xent). Although\nNT-Xent operates only over the class token, we observe that, potentially thanks\nto weight sharing, informative musical properties emerge in ViT-1D's sequence\ntokens. On global tasks, the temporal average of class and sequence tokens\noffers a performance increase compared to the class token alone, showing useful\nproperties in the sequence tokens. On local tasks, sequence tokens perform\nunexpectedly well, despite not being specifically trained for. Furthermore,\nhigh-level musical features such as onsets emerge from layer-wise attention\nmaps and self-similarity matrices show different layers capture different\nmusical dimensions. Our paper does not focus on improving performance but\nadvances the musical interpretation of transformers and sheds light on some\noverlooked abilities of contrastive SSL paired with transformers for sequence\nmodeling in MIR.",

Our\nmodel, validated by Brownian dynamics simulations, is set in a minimal yet\nadaptable geometry, allowing us to eliminate the effects of specific\ngeometries. We identify distinct signatures in the PSD as a function of\nfrequency $f$, including $1/f^{3/2}$ and $1/f^{1/2}$ scalings related to\ndiffusive entrance and re-entrance effects, and a $1/f^2$ scaling associated\nwith adsorption. These scalings appear in key predicted quantities -- the total\nnumber of particles in the channel and the number of adsorbed or unadsorbed\nparticles -- and can dominate or combine in non-trivial ways depending on\nparameter values. Notably, when there is a separation of timescales between\ndiffusion within the channel and adsorption/desorption times, the PSD can\nexhibit two distinct slopes in some of the predicted quantities.

This stability challenges models predicting rapid fading from\nevolving magnetized outflows, such as those powered by young magnetars or\nrelativistic shocks. Our low-frequency observations show no evidence for\nspectral evolution between 1.4 GHz and 745 MHz, with a measured spectral index\nof $\\alpha = -0.15 \\pm 0.08$, in agreement with values reported from earlier\nobservations in 2016-2017. The PRS remains compact, exhibits a flat radio\nspectrum, and-if powered by an intermediate-mass black hole accreting at a low\nEddington ratio-its radio and X-ray properties are broadly consistent with the\nfundamental plane of radio-loud AGNs. While not conclusive, this scenario\nrepresents a viable alternative to magnetar wind nebula models and warrants\nfurther investigation. Furthermore, we find no statistically significant\ncorrelation between FRB burst activity and the luminosity of associated PRSs\namong repeating sources. This apparent decoupling challenges simple progenitor\nmodels that directly link bursts and persistent emission. Together, these\nresults suggest that the FRB engine and PRS may in some systems originate from\nphysically distinct sources, underscoring the need for flexible models to\nexplain the diverse environments of repeating FRBs.",

While various sparse attention methods have been\nproposed, many are designed as training-free inference accelerators or do not\noptimally capture the unique spatio-temporal characteristics inherent in video\ndata when trained natively. This paper introduces Video Mixture of Block\nAttention (VMoBA), a novel sparse attention mechanism specifically adapted for\nVDMs. Motivated by an in-depth analysis of attention patterns within\npre-trained video transformers, which revealed strong spatio-temporal locality,\nvarying query importance, and head-specific concentration levels, VMoBA\nenhances the original MoBA framework with three key modifications: (1) a\nlayer-wise recurrent block partition scheme (1D-2D-3D) to dynamically adapt to\ndiverse spatio-temporal attention patterns and improve efficiency; (2) global\nblock selection to prioritize the most salient query-key block interactions\nacross an entire attention head; and (3) threshold-based block selection to\ndynamically determine the number of attended blocks based on their cumulative\nsimilarity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VMoBA significantly\naccelerates the training of VDMs on longer sequences, achieving 2.92x FLOPs and\n1.48x latency speedup, while attaining comparable or even superior generation\nquality to full attention.

    "abstract": "Despite the great promise of Prompt Tuning (PT) in adapting large\nVision-Language Pretrained Models (VLPMs) to downstream tasks, they often\nstruggle to overcome the Base-New Tradeoff (BNT) dilemma: as VLPMs are better\ntuned to a base task, their ability to generalize to new tasks diminishes.\nRecent work on conditional PT addresses this problem by replacing static\nprompts with dynamic Visual Image Information (VII)-conditioned prompts,\nimproving the model's generalization to new tasks to some extent. In this work,\nwe first identify a critical issue with existing conditional PT methods: using\nVII as the \"condition\" of prompts yields suboptimal performance, and even\nrandom noise-conditioned prompts can outperform the VII-conditioned\ncounterparts. On further analysis, we find that learning dynamic prompts\nconditioned on Textual Class Information (TCI) is the key to solving the BNT\nproblem. Motivated by this, we then propose Class-adaptive Prompt Tuning\n(CaPT), which enables fast adaptation of tuned models to new classes by\nlearning TCI-conditioned prompts from base classes. Remarkably, CaPT can be\nused as a plugin to mitigate the BNT problem for existing unconditional PT\nschemes. Extensive experiments on 11 datasets show that CaPT consistently\nimproves the performance of five strong unconditional PT baselines with\nnegligible additional computational cost. Additionally, by integrating CaPT\nwith our recently proposed DePT framework, we devise a new conditional PT\napproach, termed DeCaPT, which outperforms the H ACC of the state-of-the-art\nconditional PT scheme by 3.49%, averaged over the 11 datasets.

Despite this interest, the empirical study of these methods is\nhindered by the lack of publicly available data. Reliable empirical analysis of\nthe privacy properties of an API, in fact, requires access to a dataset\nconsisting of realistic API outputs; however, privacy concerns prevent the\ngeneral release of such data to the public.\n  In this work, we develop a novel methodology to construct synthetic API\noutputs that are simultaneously realistic enough to enable accurate study and\nprovide strong privacy protections. We focus on one Privacy-Preserving Ads\nAPIs: the Topics API, part of Google Chrome's Privacy Sandbox. We developed a\nmethodology to generate a differentially-private dataset that closely matches\nthe re-identification risk properties of the real Topics API data. The use of\ndifferential privacy provides strong theoretical bounds on the leakage of\nprivate user information from this release.\n  Our methodology is based on first computing a large number of\ndifferentially-private statistics describing how output API traces evolve over\ntime. Then, we design a parameterized distribution over sequences of API traces\nand optimize its parameters so that they closely match the statistics obtained.\nFinally, we create the synthetic data by drawing from this distribution.\n  Our work is complemented by an open-source release of the anonymized dataset\nobtained by this methodology. We hope this will enable external researchers to\nanalyze the API in-depth and replicate prior and future work on a realistic\nlarge-scale dataset.

To resolve these issues through\na unified pipeline, we introduce: 1) Differential visibility verification\nthrough SDF-guided ray tracing, resolving reflection ambiguities via continuous\nocclusion modeling; 2) Planar-conformal regularization via ray-aligned geometry\npatches that enforce local surface coherence while preserving sharp edges\nthrough adaptive appearance weighting; and 3) Physically-grounded Eikonal\nrelaxation that dynamically modulates geometric constraints based on local\nradiance gradients, enabling detail preservation without sacrificing global\nregularity. Unlike prior methods that handle these aspects through sequential\noptimizations or isolated modules, our approach achieves cohesive integration\nwhere appearance-geometry constraints evolve synergistically throughout\ntraining. Comprehensive evaluations across synthetic and real-world datasets\ndemonstrate state-of-the-art performance, including a 21.4% reduction in\nChamfer distance over reflection-aware baselines and 2.32 dB PSNR improvement\nagainst neural rendering counterparts.

The\nnon-local features are twofold. First, the falling objects have random and\nheavy-tailed dimensions. Second, the locations where the objects are falling\nare at least for some of the models that we consider, depending on the shape of\nthe surface before deposition. We consider $(h_N)_{N\\in \\N}$ a sequence of\nrandom $(d+1)$-dimensional surfaces defined on $[0,D]^d$ for $d\\in \\{1,2\\}$.\nThus, the process $h_{N}$ is obtained by adding to $h_{N-1}$ an object $$\\s\\in\n[0,D]^d \\mapsto Z_{N}^{\\alpha-1} \\psi\\Big(\\frac{v_{Y_N}(\\s)}{Z_N}\\Big),$$ where\n$Z=(Z_i)_{i\\in \\N}$ is an i.i.d. sequence of Pareto random variables, where\n$\\psi:[0,\\infty)\\mapsto \\mathbb{R}^+$ determines the global shape of the\nobject, where $v_{\\y}(\\x)$ is the distance between $\\x$ and $\\y$ on the torus\nand where $Y=(Y_i)_{i\\in \\N}$ are random variables in $[0,D]^d$ that provide\nthe location of each falling object.\n  In the present papers we focus on three variations of this model.

Each worker\nrequires at most $h$ seconds to compute a stochastic gradient, and the\ncommunication times from the server to the workers and from the workers to the\nserver are $\\tau_{s}$ and $\\tau_{w}$ seconds per coordinate, respectively. One\nof the main motivations for distributed optimization is to achieve scalability\nwith respect to $n$. For instance, it is well known that the distributed\nversion of SGD has a variance-dependent runtime term $\\frac{h \\sigma^2 L\n\\Delta}{n \\varepsilon^2},$ which improves with the number of workers $n,$ where\n$\\Delta = f(x^0) - f^*,$ and $x^0 \\in R^d$ is the starting point. Similarly,\nusing unbiased sparsification compressors, it is possible to reduce both the\nvariance-dependent runtime term and the communication runtime term. However,\nonce we account for the communication from the server to the workers\n$\\tau_{s}$, we prove that it becomes infeasible to design a method using\nunbiased random sparsification compressors that scales both the server-side\ncommunication runtime term $\\tau_{s} d \\frac{L \\Delta}{\\varepsilon}$ and the\nvariance-dependent runtime term $\\frac{h \\sigma^2 L \\Delta}{\\varepsilon^2},$\nbetter than poly-logarithmically in $n$, even in the homogeneous (i.i.d.) case,\nwhere all workers access the same distribution. To establish this result, we\nconstruct a new \"worst-case\" function and develop a new lower bound framework\nthat reduces the analysis to the concentration of a random sum, for which we\nprove a concentration bound.

    "abstract": "The emergence of spontaneous symmetry breaking among a few heads of\nmulti-head attention (MHA) across transformer blocks in classification tasks\nwas recently demonstrated through the quantification of single-nodal\nperformance (SNP). This finding indicates that each head focuses its attention\non a subset of labels through cooperation among its SNPs. This underlying\nlearning mechanism is generalized to large-scale MHA (LS-MHA) using a single\nmatrix value representing single-head performance (SHP), analogous to\nsingle-filter performance in convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The results\nindicate that each SHP matrix comprises multiple unit clusters such that each\nlabel being explicitly recognized by a few heads with negligible noise. This\nleads to an increased signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) along the transformer blocks,\nthereby improving classification accuracy. These features give rise to several\ndistinct vision transformer (ViT) architectures that achieve the same accuracy\nbut differ in their LS-MHA structures. As a result, their soft committee yields\nsuperior accuracy, an outcome not typically observed in CNNs which rely on\nhundreds of filters. In addition, a significant reduction in latency is\nachieved without affecting the accuracy by replacing the initial transformer\nblocks with convolutional layers. This substitution accelerates early-stage\nlearning, which is then improved by subsequent transformer layers. The\nextension of this learning mechanism to natural language processing tasks,\nbased on quantitative differences between CNNs and ViT architectures, has the\npotential to yield new insights in deep learning. The findings are demonstrated\nusing compact convolutional transformer architectures trained on the CIFAR-100\ndataset.",

Silicone-based hemispherical domes have served as\nan experimental modal system to study this phenomenon, yet prior work has\nlargely focused on localized dimples or flat imperfections, failing to capture\nthe spatially distributed nature of real-world imperfection patterns. Here, we\nintroduce an acoustic-assisted method for fabricating thin shells with\nspatially distributed, vibrational mode-shaped imperfections. Silicone is cast\nonto a thick elastic mold excited by a speaker, and vibration-induced flow\nduring curing creates thickness variations. High-speed imaging and microCT\nscanning reveal accumulation of material at the antinodes of the mold's\nvibrational modes. We show that imperfection geometry can be tuned by acoustic\nfrequency, while their amplitude increases with acoustic volume. Buckling\nexperiments demonstrate significant reductions in critical pressure, offering a\nscalable platform to study and tune imperfection-sensitive mechanics.

    "abstract": "We investigate a two-qubit quantum system in contact with an environment\nmodeled by a microscopic collision model with added ancilla-ancilla collisions\nin the non-Markovian regime. Two schemes of the two-qubit collision model with\ncarried-forward correlations are introduced. In one scheme, a single stream of\nancillae interacts with only one of the qubits of the two-qubit system; in the\nother, both the qubits interact with two independent sequences of ancillae,\nwhich could be at the same or different temperatures. The system's\nnon-Markovian evolution is examined using the trace distance measure, and the\nnon-classicality of the system is studied using the Wigner function,\nnon-classical volume, and concurrence. Also, interesting steady-state behavior\nis observed when both the independent ancillae are kept at the same\ntemperature.",

    "abstract": "Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite communication is a promising solution for\nglobal wireless coverage, especially in underserved and remote areas. However,\nthe high relative velocity of LEO satellites induces significant Doppler shifts\nthat disrupt subcarrier orthogonality and degrade multicarrier system\nperformance. While the common time-varying Doppler shift can be compensated\nrelative to a reference point, the residual differential Doppler across users\nwithin the coverage cell remains a significant challenge, causing severe\nintercarrier interference. This paper presents a generalized analytical\nframework for characterizing both the Doppler shift magnitude and the\ndifferential Doppler in LEO systems. Unlike prior works limited by flat-Earth\nassumptions or specific orbital configurations, our model incorporates Earth's\ncurvature and supports arbitrary elevation angles. Using spherical geometry, we\nderive closed-form expressions for Doppler shift based on the central angle\nbetween the satellite and ground users. We further provide a statistical\ncharacterization of both the Doppler shift magnitude and the differential\nDoppler in terms of their cumulative distribution function (CDF) and\nprobability density function (PDF) for uniformly distributed users within a\nspherical cap cell. Additionally, we derive a tight upper bound for the Doppler\nshift CDF and an exact expression for the maximum differential Doppler\nexperienced across the coverage region. To mitigate intra-cell Doppler\nvariation, we implement a user clustering technique that partitions the\ncoverage area based on a Doppler disparity threshold into spherical sub-cells,\nensuring compliance with 3GPP tolerances. Extensive simulations over realistic\nsatellite constellations validate our analysis and reveal the impact of\naltitude, beamwidth, and satellite-user geometry on Doppler behavior.",

The theoretical framework developed in this paper is grounded in\nConstructive Alignment (CA) theory and Bloom's taxonomy for defining learning\nobjectives. We argue that AI influences learning objectives of different Bloom\nlevels in a different way, and assessment has to be adopted accordingly.\nFurthermore, in line with Bloom's vision, formative and summative assessment\nshould be aligned on whether the use of AI is permitted or not.\n  Although lecturers tend to agree that education and assessment need to be\nadapted to the presence of AI, a strong bias exists on the extent to which\nlecturers want to allow for AI in assessment. This bias is caused by a\nlecturer's familiarity with AI and specifically whether they use it themselves.\nTo avoid this bias, we propose structured guidelines on a university or faculty\nlevel, to foster alignment among the staff. Besides that, we argue that\nteaching staff should be trained on the capabilities and limitations of AI\ntools. In this way, they are better able to adapt their assessment methods.",

Shadow process tomography (SPT) utilizes the Choi isomorphism to map\nQPT to shadow state tomography (SST), significantly reducing the sample\ncomplexity for extracting information from quantum processes. However, SPT\nrelies on random unitary operators and complicates the determination of the\noptimal unitary operator that minimizes the shadow norm, which is the key\nfactor influencing the sample complexity. In this work, we propose a\ngeneralized SPT framework that minimizes the shadow norm by replacing unitary\noperators with generalized measurements (POVMs). This approach, termed shadow\nprocess tomography with POVMs (POVM-SPT), uses convex optimization to identify\nthe optimal POVM for minimizing the shadow norm, thereby further reducing\nsample complexity. We demonstrate the identification of the optimal POVM\nthrough numerical simulations and provide the corresponding optimization\nalgorithms. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that POVM-SPT achieves a\nsubstantial reduction in shadow norm compared to conventional SPT, with an\napproximate 7-fold improvement for single-qubit input states and a remarkable\n$2^{180}$-fold enhancement for 64-qubit input states.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we revisit stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with AdaGrad-type\npreconditioning. Our contributions are twofold. First, we develop a unified\nconvergence analysis of SGD with adaptive preconditioning under anisotropic or\nmatrix smoothness and noise assumptions. This allows us to recover\nstate-of-the-art convergence results for several popular adaptive gradient\nmethods, including AdaGrad-Norm, AdaGrad, and ASGO/One-sided Shampoo. In\naddition, we establish the fundamental connection between two recently proposed\nalgorithms, Scion and DASGO, and provide the first theoretical guarantees for\nthe latter. Second, we show that the convergence of methods like AdaGrad and\nDASGO can be provably accelerated beyond the best-known rates using Nesterov\nmomentum. Consequently, we obtain the first theoretical justification that\nAdaGrad-type algorithms can simultaneously benefit from both diagonal\npreconditioning and momentum, which may provide an ultimate explanation for the\npractical efficiency of Adam.",

    "abstract": "Super-resolution (SR) techniques can enhance the spatial resolution of remote\nsensing images by utilizing low-resolution (LR) images to reconstruct\nhigh-resolution (HR) images, enabling more efficient large-scale earth\nobservation applications. While single-image super-resolution (SISR) methods\nhave shown progress, reference-based super-resolution (RefSR) offers superior\nperformance by incorporating historical HR images alongside current LR\nobservations. However, existing RefSR methods struggle with real-world\ncomplexities, such as cross-sensor resolution gap and significant land cover\nchanges, often leading to under-generation or over-reliance on reference image.\nTo address these challenges, we propose CRefDiff, a novel controllable\nreference-based diffusion model for real-world remote sensing image SR. To\naddress the under-generation problem, CRefDiff is built upon the pretrained\nStable Diffusion model, leveraging its powerful generative prior to produce\naccurate structures and textures. To mitigate over-reliance on the reference,\nwe introduce a dual-branch fusion mechanism that adaptively integrates both\nlocal and global information from the reference image. Moreover, this novel\ndual-branch design enables reference strength control during inference,\nenhancing interactivity and flexibility of the model. Finally, a strategy named\nBetter Start is proposed to significantly reduce the number of denoising steps,\nthereby accelerating the inference process. To support further research, we\nintroduce Real-RefRSSRD, a new real-world RefSR dataset for remote sensing\nimages, consisting of HR NAIP and LR Sentinel-2 image pairs with diverse land\ncover changes and significant temporal gaps. Extensive experiments on\nReal-RefRSSRD show that CRefDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance across\nvarious metrics and improves downstream tasks such as scene classification and\nsemantic segmentation.",

We address the first issue by introducing two\nnovel methods to optimize the latent variables that use precision-weighting to\nre-balance the distribution of energy among layers during the `relaxation\nphase', and the second issue by proposing a novel weight update mechanism that\nreduces error accumulation in deeper layers.

Moreover, KAIROS supports efficient\nonline updates: when a new batch of size m arrives, all scores can be updated\nin $O(mN)$ time, delivering up to 50x speedup without compromising ranking\nquality. Empirical evaluations on noise, mislabeling, and poisoning benchmarks\nshow that KAIROS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art model-, Shapley-,\nand Wasserstein-based baselines in both accuracy and runtime.

Several VIC\nvegetation parameters were identified as important to the performance estimates\nfor evaporation during sensitivity analysis, and therefore were suitable\ncandidates to improve the model representation of evaporative fluxes.\nSensitivities for the streamflow performance, in turn, were mostly driven by\nthe soil and routing parameters, with little contribution from the vegetation\nparameters. The multiobjective calibration experiments were carried out for the\nmost parsimonious parameterization after a comparative analysis of the\nperformance gains and losses for streamflow and evaporation, and yielded\noptimal adjustments for both hydrologic variables simultaneously.

    "abstract": "The ever-increasing number of distributed embedded systems in the context of\nthe Internet of Things (IoT), Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN), and\nCyber-Physical Systems (CPS) rely on wireless communication to collect and\nexchange data. Nodes can employ single-hop communication which, despite its\nease, may necessitate energy-intensive long-range communication to cover long\ndistances. Conversely, multi-hop communication allows for more energy-efficient\nshort-range communication since nodes can rely on other nodes to forward their\ndata. Yet, this approach requires relay nodes to be available and continuous\nmaintenance of a dynamically changing distributed state. At the same time,\nenergy harvesting has the potential to outperform traditional battery-based\nsystems by improving their lifetime, scalability with lower maintenance costs,\nand environmental impact. However, the limited and temporally and spatially\nvariable harvested energy poses significant challenges for networking in energy\nharvesting networks, particularly considering the energy demands and\ncharacteristics of both multi-hop and single-hop communication. We propose\nE-WAN, a protocol for energy harvesting wide-area low-power networks that\nbuilds on the concept of \\emph{virtual sub-networks} to enable\nresource-efficient multi-hop communication when possible and reliable however\nenergy-intensive point-to-point communication otherwise. Nodes autonomously and\ndynamically move between the two and adjust to changing network states and\nresources based only on easily obtainable network state information. We\nillustrate E-WAN's advantages both in terms of efficiency and adaptability in\nvarious communication and harvesting scenarios. Furthermore, we demonstrate\nE-WAN operating in a realistic setting by deploying an energy harvesting\nnetwork in a real-world indoor environment.",

    "abstract": "Intersymbol Interference (ISI) is a major bottleneck in Molecular\nCommunication via Diffusion (MCvD), degrading system performance. This paper\nintroduces two families of linear channel codes to mitigate ISI: Zero Pad Zero\nStart (ZPZS) and Zero Pad (ZP) codes, ensuring that each codeword avoids\nconsecutive bit-1s. The ZPZS and ZP codes are then combined to form a binary ZP\ncode, offering a higher code rate than linear ZP codes and allowing simple\ndecoding via the Majority Location Rule (MLR). Additionally, a Leading One Zero\nPad (LOZP) code is proposed, which relaxes zero-padding constraints by\nprioritizing the placement of bit-1s, achieving a higher rate than ZP. A\nclosed-form expression is derived to compute expected ISI, showing it depends\non the average bit-1 density in the codewords. ISI and Bit Error Rate (BER)\nperformance are evaluated under two MCvD channel models: (i) without refresh,\nwhere past bits persist longer, and (ii) with refresh, where the channel is\ncleared after each reception. Results show that the LOZP code performs better\nin the refresh channel due to initial bit-1 placement, while ZP excels without\nrefresh by reducing average bit-1 density. The asymptotic upper bound on code\nrate illustrates a trade-off between ISI and rate. Simulations demonstrate that\nZP and LOZP codes improve BER by controlling bit-1 positions and density,\nproviding better reliability in ISI-dominated regimes compared to conventional\nerror-correcting codes.",

In contrast to polaritons\nin doped graphene, which arise from intraband electronic transitions, those in\ncharge-neutral graphene originate from interband transitions between Landau\nlevels, enabled by the applied magnetic field. Control of such quantum\npolaritons and shaping their wavefronts remains totally unexplored. Here we\ndesign an artificial two-dimensional quantum material formed by charge-neutral\ngraphene nanoribbons exposed to an external magnetic field. In such\nmetasurface, quantum polaritons acquire a hyperbolic dispersion. We find that\nthe topology of the isofrequency curves of quantum hyperbolic magnetoexciton\npolaritons excited in this quantum material can change, so that the shape of\nisofrequency curves transforms from a closed to open one by tuning the external\nmagnetic field strength. At the topological transition, we observe canalization\nphenomena, consisting of the propagation of all the polaritonic plane waves in\nthe continuum along the same direction when excited by a point source. From a\ngeneral perspective, our fundamental findings introduce a novel type of\nactively-tunable quantum polaritons with hyperbolic dispersion and can be\nfurther generalized to other types of quantum materials and polaritons in them.\nIn practice, quantum hyperbolic polaritons can be used for applications related\nto quantum sensing and computing.",

    "abstract": "Combining traditional RGB cameras with bio-inspired event cameras for robust\nobject tracking has garnered increasing attention in recent years. However,\nmost existing multimodal tracking algorithms depend heavily on high-complexity\nVision Transformer architectures for feature extraction and fusion across\nmodalities. This not only leads to substantial computational overhead but also\nlimits the effectiveness of cross-modal interactions. In this paper, we propose\nan efficient RGB-Event object tracking framework based on the linear-complexity\nVision Mamba network, termed Mamba-FETrack V2. Specifically, we first design a\nlightweight Prompt Generator that utilizes embedded features from each\nmodality, together with a shared prompt pool, to dynamically generate\nmodality-specific learnable prompt vectors. These prompts, along with the\nmodality-specific embedded features, are then fed into a Vision Mamba-based\nFEMamba backbone, which facilitates prompt-guided feature extraction,\ncross-modal interaction, and fusion in a unified manner. Finally, the fused\nrepresentations are passed to the tracking head for accurate target\nlocalization. Extensive experimental evaluations on multiple RGB-Event tracking\nbenchmarks, including short-term COESOT dataset and long-term datasets, i.e.,\nFE108 and FELT V2, demonstrate the superior performance and efficiency of the\nproposed tracking framework.

While existing graph-aware calibration methods seek\nto mitigate this limitation, they primarily depend on coarse one-hop\nstatistics, such as neighbor-predicted confidence, or latent node embeddings,\nthereby neglecting the fine-grained structural heterogeneity inherent in graph\ntopology. In this work, we propose Wavelet-Aware Temperature Scaling (WATS), a\npost-hoc calibration framework that assigns node-specific temperatures based on\ntunable heat-kernel graph wavelet features. Specifically, WATS harnesses the\nscalability and topology sensitivity of graph wavelets to refine confidence\nestimates, all without necessitating model retraining or access to neighboring\nlogits or predictions. Extensive evaluations across seven benchmark datasets\nwith varying graph structures and two GNN backbones demonstrate that WATS\nachieves the lowest Expected Calibration Error (ECE) among all compared\nmethods, outperforming both classical and graph-specific baselines by up to\n42.3\\% in ECE and reducing calibration variance by 17.24\\% on average compared\nwith graph-specific methods.

To mitigate this issue, trace clustering techniques group process\nexecutions into clusters, each represented by a simpler and more understandable\nprocess model. Model-driven trace clustering improves on this by assigning\ntraces to clusters based on their conformity to cluster-specific process\nmodels. However, most existing clustering techniques rely on either no process\nmodel discovery, or non-stochastic models, neglecting the frequency or\nprobability of activities and transitions, thereby limiting their capability to\ncapture real-world execution dynamics. We propose a novel model-driven trace\nclustering method that optimizes stochastic process models within each cluster.\nOur approach uses entropic relevance, a stochastic conformance metric based on\ndirectly-follows probabilities, to guide trace assignment. This allows\nclustering decisions to consider both structural alignment with a cluster's\nprocess model and the likelihood that a trace originates from a given\nstochastic process model. The method is computationally efficient, scales\nlinearly with input size, and improves model interpretability by producing\nclusters with clearer control-flow patterns.

We\ninvestigate the potential of large language models (LLMs) in teacher education,\nusing a case of teaching hate incidents management in schools. To this end, we\ncreate a multi-agent LLM-based system that mimics realistic situations of hate,\nusing a combination of retrieval-augmented prompting and persona modelling. It\nis designed to identify and analyse hate speech patterns, predict potential\nescalation, and propose effective intervention strategies. By integrating\npersona modelling with agentic LLMs, we create contextually diverse simulations\nof hate incidents, mimicking real-life situations. The system allows teachers\nto analyse and understand the dynamics of hate incidents in a safe and\ncontrolled environment, providing valuable insights and practical knowledge to\nmanage such situations confidently in real life. Our pilot evaluation\ndemonstrates teachers' enhanced understanding of the nature of annotator\ndisagreements and the role of context in hate speech interpretation, leading to\nthe development of more informed and effective strategies for addressing hate\nin classroom settings.",

    "abstract": "The present study connects inflation and freeze-in type dark matter (DM)\nwithin the same setup. Although the observables in these two phenomena lie at\nvastly different energy scales, they have been properly handled using the RG\nrunning of couplings. For studying DM and inflation, the SM has been minimally\nextended by introducing an abelian dark gauge symmetry and a dark singlet\nscalar. In studying inflation, the SM Higgs doublet has been considered as the\ninflaton, which has a non-minimal coupling with the Ricci scalar. All\ninflationary observables have been computed at the horizon exit scale and\nconstrained using the Planck data. Moreover, inflationary constraints have\nrevealed strong correlations among model parameters, significantly reducing the\nallowed parameter space. In particular, in the Higgs mixing angle and BSM Higgs\nmass plane, only those values that ensure the Higgs quartic coupling remains\nabove 0.18 are allowed. The additional gauge boson serves as a suitable DM\ncandidate, produced via the freeze-in mechanism and stabilised by charge\nconjugation symmetry. The upper bound on the DM relic density further shrinks\nthe parameter space allowed from inflationary constraints, becoming even\nnarrower if we assume that the present vector DM constitutes the total DM\ndensity. Since DM interactions are feeble, it remains safe from all terrestrial\nexperimental constraints. Additionally, the feeble dark matter coupling\nrequires the dark Higgs-Ricci scalar non-minimal coupling to be negligible to\nsatisfy Higgs inflation conditions. Finally, we have explored collider aspects\nand found that the trilinear and quartic Higgs vertices deviate from their SM\nvalues after incorporating inflation and DM constraints. Therefore, once we\nmeasure $\\kappa_{3,4}$ at the future collider, we can establish the robustness\nof the Higgs inflation scenario.",

It is defined as the equivalence class of the lattice of\nintegers with respect to linear operations that are composites of rotations,\nreflections, and positive scalar dilations. For a number field of degree $n$,\nthe shape is a point in the space of shapes $\\mathscr{S}_{n-1}$, which is the\ndouble quotient $GL_{n-1}(\\mathbb{Z}) \\backslash GL_{n-1}(\\mathbb{R}) /\nGO_{n-1}(\\mathbb{R})$.

We prove\nthat the shape of $K_m$ lies on one of ten explicitly described torus orbits in\n$\\mathscr{S}_3$, determined by the sign and residue class of $m \\bmod 32$. It\nis shown that the shape on a given torus orbit is completely determined by two\nparameters, one of which varies continuously, while the other takes values in a\ndiscrete set. As a result, the distribution of shapes in this family is\ngoverned by a product of a continuous and a discrete measure. Our results shed\nnew light on a question posed by Manjul Bhargava and Piper H concerning the\ndistribution of shapes in families of non-generic number fields of fixed\ndegree.

Currently, the role of\ndynamical changes during SSW events on radiative cooling in the MLT region is\nnot well understood. An investigation of the SSW-induced changes in CO$_2$\nradiative cooling in the MLT region is presented by examining the changes in\nthe dynamics and transport of key species, such as CO$_2$ and atomic oxygen\n(O). A composite analysis has been performed to understand these changes during\nthe major SSW events that occurred between 2005 and 2020. The variation of\ntrace species is found to be associated with the change in vertical residual\ncirculation. The results also show that CO$_2$ radiative cooling decreases\nduring the mesospheric cooling that occurs during the stratospheric warming\nover the polar region. During the recovery stage of the SSW event, the CO$_2$\nradiative cooling enhances in the mesosphere. These variations in CO$_2$\nradiative cooling are mainly caused by temperature perturbations and oxygen\ntransport in the MLT region.

We classify stable, metastable, and unstable DM states over a wide\nrange of condensate wave function amplitudes. It is shown that the axionlike\ninteraction causes instability and an imaginary speed of sound at low\namplitudes, whereas, in a specific high-amplitude band, DM attains a stable\nstate capable of forming a dense solitonic core and suppressing quantum\nfluctuations in the surrounding galactic DM halo. These findings are\ncorroborated by evaluating thermodynamic functions for DM in the dwarf galaxy\nNGC2366 and its hypothetical analogs with different core-to-halo mass ratios.\nDistinct DM phase compositions respond differently to fluctuation-induced\npartial pressure, resulting in a first-order phase transition in a certain\nrange of an interaction parameter. While the DM properties in NGC2366 lie\nwithin the supercritical regime, the phase transition nonetheless provides a\nthermodynamic marker separating stable from unstable DM configurations. Once a\ndense core forms - reaching a threshold of about 12% of the total mass - the\nenhanced gravitation stabilizes the DM halo against fluctuations, while the\ninternal pressure ensures core stability.

    "abstract": "Surgical instrument segmentation under Federated Learning (FL) is a promising\ndirection, which enables multiple surgical sites to collaboratively train the\nmodel without centralizing datasets. However, there exist very limited FL works\nin surgical data science, and FL methods for other modalities do not consider\ninherent characteristics in surgical domain: i) different scenarios show\ndiverse anatomical backgrounds while highly similar instrument representation;\nii) there exist surgical simulators which promote large-scale synthetic data\ngeneration with minimal efforts. In this paper, we propose a novel Personalized\nFL scheme, Spatio-Temporal Representation Decoupling and Enhancement (FedST),\nwhich wisely leverages surgical domain knowledge during both local-site and\nglobal-server training to boost segmentation. Concretely, our model embraces a\nRepresentation Separation and Cooperation (RSC) mechanism in local-site\ntraining, which decouples the query embedding layer to be trained privately, to\nencode respective backgrounds. Meanwhile, other parameters are optimized\nglobally to capture the consistent representations of instruments, including\nthe temporal layer to capture similar motion patterns. A textual-guided channel\nselection is further designed to highlight site-specific features, facilitating\nmodel adapta tion to each site. Moreover, in global-server training, we propose\nSynthesis-based Explicit Representation Quantification (SERQ), which defines an\nexplicit representation target based on synthetic data to synchronize the model\nconvergence during fusion for improving model generalization.",

We derive an expression for the expected duration of\nLoS between a static UAV in the air and a mobile ground user, and validate the\nsame through simulations.

In this work, we focus on\nthe supercooling phase transition for the scale symmetry breaking based on the\neffective potential of the Coleman-Weinberg (CW) type. We investigate the\neffect on the PBH production in the presence of an additional mass term for the\nCW scalar field, what we call a soft-scale breaking term, which serves as the\nextra explicit-scale breaking term other than the quantum scale anomaly induced\nby the CW mechanism. We demonstrate that even a small size of the soft-scale\nbreaking term can significantly affect the PBH production depending on its\nsign: a positive term slows down the phase transition, thereby enhancing the\nPBH abundance and improving the model's ability to account for dark matter; in\ncontrast, a negative term suppresses the PBH formation. The inclusion of such\nsoft-scale breaking terms broadens the viable parameter space and increases the\nflexibility of the framework. We further illustrate our results through two\nultraviolet-complete realizations: i) a many-flavor QCD-inspired model as a\nreference model which can dynamically induce a positive-soft scale breaking;\nii) a Higgs portal model with a $B-L$ scalar as the benchmark for the case\nwhere a negative-soft scale breaking is induced.

Real-world data does not\nprovide sufficient control, required for a rigorous evaluation of model\ngeneralization. In contrast, synthetically generated data allows to\nsystematically explore the boundaries of model competence/generalization. In\nthis work, we address two research questions: 1) Can we challenge\nopen-vocabulary object detectors with generated image content? 2) Can we find\nsystematic failure modes of those models? To address these questions, we design\ntwo automated pipelines using stable diffusion to inpaint unusual objects with\nhigh diversity in semantics, by sampling multiple substantives from WordNet and\nChatGPT. On the synthetically generated data, we evaluate and compare multiple\nopen-vocabulary object detectors as well as a classical object detector.

Our results indicate that inpainting can challenge open-vocabulary\nobject detectors in terms of overlooking objects.

While straightforward, this approach results in integration\nspaces larger than necessary, especially as the polynomial degree $p$ or the\nspatial dimension increases, leading to considerable computational overhead.\nThis work starts from the hypothesis that reducing the dimensionality of the\npolynomial space can lead to quadrature rules with fewer points and lower\ncomputational cost, while preserving the exactness of numerical integration. We\nuse trunk spaces that exclude high-degree monomials that do not improve the\napproximation quality of the discrete space. These reduced spaces retain\nsufficient expressive power and allow us to construct smaller (more economical)\nintegration domains. Given a maximum degree $p$, we define trial and test\nspaces $U$ and $V$ as 2D or 3D trunk spaces and form the integration space\n$\\mathcal{S} = U \\otimes V$. We then construct exact quadrature rules by\nsolving a non-convex optimisation problem over the number of points $q$, their\ncoordinates, and weights. We use a shallow neural network with linear\nactivations to parametrise the rule, and a random restart strategy to mitigate\nconvergence to poor local minima. When necessary, we dynamically increase $q$\nto achieve exact integration. Our construction reaches machine-precision\naccuracy (errors below 1e-22) using significantly fewer points than standard\ntensor-product Gaussian quadrature: up to 30\\% reduction in 2D for $p \\leq 10$,\nand 50\\% in 3D for $p \\leq 6$. These results show that combining the\nmathematical understanding of polynomial structure with numerical optimisation\ncan lead to a practical and extensible methodology for improving the\nadaptiveness, efficiency, and scalability of quadrature rules for high-order\nfinite element simulations.",

By tuning the ratio Jy/Jx, we document a\nsystematic evolution of the specific-heat anomaly. For example, in the\nquasi-one-dimensional limit, CV exhibits a broad, low-temperature hump, whereas\nstronger anisotropy yields sharper peaks that migrate to higher inverse\ntemperature. Finite-size scaling confirms the crossover from quasi-1D\nfluctuations to a two-dimensional Kosterlitz-Thouless transition. Incorporating\na DM interaction further enriches this landscape.

Meanwhile,\ndespite IARs having recently surpassed DMs in image generation quality and\nefficiency, no radioactive watermarking methods have been proposed for them. To\novercome this limitation, we propose the first watermarking method tailored for\nIARs and with radioactivity in mind - drawing inspiration from techniques in\nlarge language models (LLMs), which share IARs' autoregressive paradigm. Our\nextensive experimental evaluation highlights our method's effectiveness in\npreserving radioactivity within IARs, enabling robust provenance tracking, and\npreventing unauthorized use of their generated images.",

This\nresolves an open problem proposed in [Bogart et al., Discrete Analysis, 2017].\nAs conjectured in [Goodrick, Arch. Math. Logic, 2018], quantifier elimination\nis obtained for the extended structure featuring all integer division functions\n$x \\mapsto \\lfloor{\\frac{x}{f(t)}}\\rfloor$, one for each integer polynomial\n$f$.\n  Our algorithm works by iteratively eliminating blocks of existential\nquantifiers. The elimination of a block builds on two sub-procedures, both\nrunning in non-deterministic polynomial time. The first one is an adaptation of\na recently developed and efficient quantifier elimination procedure for\nPresburger arithmetic, modified to handle formulae with coefficients over the\nring $\\mathbb{Z}[t]$ of univariate polynomials. The second is reminiscent of\nthe so-called \"base $t$ division method\" used by Bogart et al. As a result, we\ndeduce that the satisfiability problem for the existential fragment of\none-parametric Presburger arithmetic (which encompasses a broad class of\nnon-linear integer programs) is in NP, and that the smallest solution to a\nsatisfiable formula in this fragment is of polynomial bit size.",

To address\nthese challenges, we introduce Proteus-ID, a novel diffusion-based framework\nfor identity-consistent and motion-coherent video customization. First, we\npropose a Multimodal Identity Fusion (MIF) module that unifies visual and\ntextual cues into a joint identity representation using a Q-Former, providing\ncoherent guidance to the diffusion model and eliminating modality imbalance.\nSecond, we present a Time-Aware Identity Injection (TAII) mechanism that\ndynamically modulates identity conditioning across denoising steps, improving\nfine-detail reconstruction. Third, we propose Adaptive Motion Learning (AML), a\nself-supervised strategy that reweights the training loss based on\noptical-flow-derived motion heatmaps, enhancing motion realism without\nrequiring additional inputs. To support this task, we construct Proteus-Bench,\na high-quality dataset comprising 200K curated clips for training and 150\nindividuals from diverse professions and ethnicities for evaluation.

Increasing T<sub>i</sub> and L<sub>v</sub>\nin this range resulted in an earlier breakdown of the tip vortices which in\nturn resulted in an earlier onset of wake recovery. Typically, the amplitude of\nwake meandering increased in the presence of FST, but not monotonically with\neither T<sub>i</sub> or L<sub>v</sub>. The nature of the low frequency region\n(typical of wake meandering frequencies) of the power spectra changed from a\nmore discrete to a more broadband one as FST level was increased, highlighting\na fundamental change in the nature of wake meandering with/without FST.

    "abstract": "Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly pivotal for generalist robot\nmanipulation, enabling tasks such as physical reasoning, policy generation, and\nfailure detection. However, their proficiency in these high-level applications\noften assumes a deep understanding of low-level physical prerequisites, a\ncapability that remains largely unverified. For robots to perform actions\nreliably, they must comprehend intrinsic object properties (e.g., material,\nweight), action affordances (e.g., graspable, stackable), and physical\nconstraints (e.g., stability, reachability, or an object's state, such as being\nclosed). Despite the widespread use of VLMs in manipulation tasks, we argue\nthat off-the-shelf models may lack this granular, physically grounded\nunderstanding, as such prerequisites are often overlooked during training.\n  To address this critical gap, we introduce PAC Bench, a comprehensive\nbenchmark designed to systematically evaluate VLMs on their understanding of\ncore Properties, Affordances, and Constraints (PAC) from a task executability\nperspective. PAC Bench features a diverse dataset with over 30,000 annotations,\ncomprising 673 real-world images (115 object classes, 15 property types, and 1\nto 3 affordances defined per class), 100 real-world humanoid-view scenarios,\nand 120 unique simulated constraint scenarios across four tasks.\n  Our evaluations reveal significant gaps in the ability of current VLMs to\ngrasp fundamental physical concepts, highlighting limitations in their\nsuitability for reliable robot manipulation and pointing to key areas for\ntargeted research.

However, to date, existing TTA methods primarily focus\non single-model adaptation. In this work, we investigate an intriguing\nquestion: how does cross-model knowledge influence the TTA process? Our\nfindings reveal that, in TTA's unsupervised online setting, each model can\nprovide complementary, confident knowledge to the others, even when there are\nsubstantial differences in model size. For instance, a smaller model like\nMobileViT (10.6M parameters) can effectively guide a larger model like ViT-Base\n(86.6M parameters). In light of this, we propose COCA, a Cross-Model\nCo-Learning framework for TTA, which mainly consists of two main strategies. 1)\nCo-adaptation adaptively integrates complementary knowledge from other models\nthroughout the TTA process, reducing individual model biases. 2)\nSelf-adaptation enhances each model's unique strengths via unsupervised\nlearning, enabling diverse adaptation to the target domain. Extensive\nexperiments show that COCA, which can also serve as a plug-and-play module,\nsignificantly boosts existing SOTAs, on models with various sizes--including\nResNets, ViTs, and Mobile-ViTs--via cross-model co-learned TTA.

The purpose of this paper is to present a comprehensive control\narchitecture for achieving complex tasks such as robotized harvesting in\nvineyards within the framework of the European project CANOPIES. In detail, a\n16-DOF dual-arm mobile robot is employed, controlled via a Hierarchical\nQuadratic Programming (HQP) approach capable of handling both equality and\ninequality constraints at various priorities to harvest grape bunches selected\nby the perception system developed within the project. Furthermore, given the\ncomplexity of the scenario and the uncertainty in the perception system, which\ncould potentially lead to collisions with the environment, the handling of\ninteraction forces is necessary. Remarkably, this was achieved using the same\nHQP framework. This feature is further leveraged to enable semi-autonomous\noperations, allowing a human operator to assist the robotic counterpart in\ncompleting harvesting tasks. Finally, the obtained results are validated\nthrough extensive testing conducted first in a laboratory environment to prove\nindividual functionalities, then in a real vineyard, encompassing both\nautonomous and semi-autonomous grape harvesting operations.",

    "abstract": "Multi-bit spiking neural networks (SNNs) have recently become a heated\nresearch spot, pursuing energy-efficient and high-accurate AI. However, with\nmore bits involved, the associated memory and computation demands escalate to\nthe point where the performance improvements become disproportionate. Based on\nthe insight that different layers demonstrate different importance and extra\nbits could be wasted and interfering, this paper presents an adaptive bit\nallocation strategy for direct-trained SNNs, achieving fine-grained layer-wise\nallocation of memory and computation resources. Thus, SNN's efficiency and\naccuracy can be improved. Specifically, we parametrize the temporal lengths and\nthe bit widths of weights and spikes, and make them learnable and controllable\nthrough gradients. To address the challenges caused by changeable bit widths\nand temporal lengths, we propose the refined spiking neuron, which can handle\ndifferent temporal lengths, enable the derivation of gradients for temporal\nlengths, and suit spike quantization better. In addition, we theoretically\nformulate the step-size mismatch problem of learnable bit widths, which may\nincur severe quantization errors to SNN, and accordingly propose the step-size\nrenewal mechanism to alleviate this issue. Experiments on various datasets,\nincluding the static CIFAR and ImageNet datasets and the dynamic CIFAR-DVS,\nDVS-GESTURE, and SHD datasets, demonstrate that our methods can reduce the\noverall memory and computation cost while achieving higher accuracy.\nParticularly, our SEWResNet-34 can achieve a 2.69% accuracy gain and 4.16x\nlower bit budgets over the advanced baseline work on ImageNet. This work will\nbe open-sourced.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a sample-efficient, data-driven control framework for\nfinite-horizon linear quadratic (LQ) control of linear time-varying (LTV)\nsystems. In contrast to the time-invariant case, the time-varying LQ problem\ninvolves a differential Riccati equation (DRE) with time-dependent parameters\nand terminal boundary constraints. We formulate the LQ problem as a nonconvex\noptimization problem and conduct a rigorous analysis of its dual structure. By\nexploiting the inherent convexity of the dual problem and analyzing the KKT\nconditions, we derive an explicit relationship between the optimal dual\nsolution and the parameters of the associated Q-function in time-varying case.\nThis theoretical insight supports the development of a novel, sample-efficient,\nnon-iterative semidefinite programming (SDP) algorithm that directly computes\nthe optimal sequence of feedback gains from an ensemble of input-state data\nsequences without model identification. The resulting convex, data-dependent\nframework provides global optimality guarantees for completely unknown LTV\nsystems. As a special case, the method also applies to finite-horizon LQ\ncontrol of linear time-invariant (LTI) systems. In this setting, a single\ninput-state trajectory suffices to identify the optimal LQ feedback policy,\nimproving significantly over existing Q-learning approaches for finite horizon\nLTI systems that typically require data from multiple episodes. The approach\nprovides a new optimization-based perspective on Q-learning in time-varying\nsettings and contributes to the broader understanding of data-driven control in\nnon-stationary environments. Simulation results show that, compared to recent\nmethods, the proposed approach achieves superior optimality and sample\nefficiency on LTV systems, and indicates potential for stabilizing and optimal\ncontrol of nonlinear systems.",

In such a square lattice with four +$M$ elements and four\n-$M$ elements, corner states appear when the superlattice exposes $2b$ Wyckoff\npositions. And the corner states will decrease when the number of exposed $2b$\nWyckoff positions decreases and disappears when $2b$ Wyckoff positions no\nlonger stand at the edge. By arranging all the magnetic rods into one\nmagnetization direction, we find that time-reversal symmetry is not important\nfor corner states.

Predicting these statistics\nusing fully resolved simulations at the high Reynolds numbers that typically\noccur in engineering, geophysical, and astrophysical flows will exceed the\ncapabilities of even the largest supercomputers for the foreseeable future. A\ncommon observation is that high-Reynolds-number flows are organized in clusters\nof intense turbulent activity separated by large regions of quiescent flow. We\nhere show that small-scale statistics in high-Reynolds-number turbulence can be\npredicted based on an ensemble hypothesis, stating that they can be emulated by\nthe statistical mixture of a heterogeneous ensemble of lower-Reynolds-number\nsimulations. These simulations are forced at smaller scales with energy\ninjection rates varying across the ensemble. We show that our method predicts\ncomplex gradient statistics from the recent literature, including the joint\nQR-PDF and extreme dissipation and enstrophy statistics, to unprecedented\naccuracy. Remarkably, we find that the weight distribution needed for the\nensemble method to make predictions can be inferred from the anomalous scaling\nexponents of turbulence. Thus combining theory with fully resolved simulations,\nour method can be readily applied to predict a wide range of statistics at high\nReynolds number but low cost, while opening up various avenues for further\ntheoretical and numerical exploration.",

    "abstract": "While artificial intelligence (AI) is advancing rapidly and mastering\nincreasingly complex problems with astonishing performance, the safety\nassurance of such systems is a major concern. Particularly in the context of\nsafety-critical, real-world cyber-physical systems, AI promises to achieve a\nnew level of autonomy but is hampered by a lack of safety assurance. While\ndata-driven control takes up recent developments in AI to improve control\nsystems, control theory in general could be leveraged to improve AI safety.\nTherefore, this article outlines a new perspective on AI safety based on an\ninterdisciplinary interpretation of the underlying data-generation process and\nthe respective abstraction by AI systems in a system theory-inspired and system\nanalysis-driven manner. In this context, the new perspective, also referred to\nas data control, aims to stimulate AI engineering to take advantage of existing\nsafety analysis and assurance in an interdisciplinary way to drive the paradigm\nof data control. Following a top-down approach, a generic foundation for safety\nanalysis and assurance is outlined at an abstract level that can be refined for\nspecific AI systems and applications and is prepared for future innovation.",

    "abstract": "Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) reconstruction is essential in medical\ndiagnostics. As the latest generative models, diffusion models (DMs) have\nstruggled to produce high-fidelity images due to their stochastic nature in\nimage domains. Latent diffusion models (LDMs) yield both compact and detailed\nprior knowledge in latent domains, which could effectively guide the model\ntowards more effective learning of the original data distribution. Inspired by\nthis, we propose Multi-domain Diffusion Prior Guidance (MDPG) provided by\npre-trained LDMs to enhance data consistency in MRI reconstruction tasks.\nSpecifically, we first construct a Visual-Mamba-based backbone, which enables\nefficient encoding and reconstruction of under-sampled images. Then pre-trained\nLDMs are integrated to provide conditional priors in both latent and image\ndomains. A novel Latent Guided Attention (LGA) is proposed for efficient fusion\nin multi-level latent domains. Simultaneously, to effectively utilize a prior\nin both the k-space and image domain, under-sampled images are fused with\ngenerated full-sampled images by the Dual-domain Fusion Branch (DFB) for\nself-adaption guidance. Lastly, to further enhance the data consistency, we\npropose a k-space regularization strategy based on the non-auto-calibration\nsignal (NACS) set. Extensive experiments on two public MRI datasets fully\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. The code is\navailable at https://github.com/Zolento/MDPG.",

    "abstract": "Medical image segmentation plays a crucial role in clinical diagnosis and\ntreatment planning, where accurate boundary delineation is essential for\nprecise lesion localization, organ identification, and quantitative assessment.\nIn recent years, deep learning-based methods have significantly advanced\nsegmentation accuracy. However, two major challenges remain. First, the\nperformance of these methods heavily relies on large-scale annotated datasets,\nwhich are often difficult to obtain in medical scenarios due to privacy\nconcerns and high annotation costs. Second, clinically challenging scenarios,\nsuch as low contrast in certain imaging modalities and blurry lesion boundaries\ncaused by malignancy, still pose obstacles to precise segmentation. To address\nthese challenges, we propose MedSAM-CA, an architecture-level fine-tuning\napproach that mitigates reliance on extensive manual annotations by adapting\nthe pretrained foundation model, Medical Segment Anything (MedSAM). MedSAM-CA\nintroduces two key components: the Convolutional Attention-Enhanced Boundary\nRefinement Network (CBR-Net) and the Attention-Enhanced Feature Fusion Block\n(Atte-FFB). CBR-Net operates in parallel with the MedSAM encoder to recover\nboundary information potentially overlooked by long-range attention mechanisms,\nleveraging hierarchical convolutional processing. Atte-FFB, embedded in the\nMedSAM decoder, fuses multi-level fine-grained features from skip connections\nin CBR-Net with global representations upsampled within the decoder to enhance\nboundary delineation accuracy. Experiments on publicly available datasets\ncovering dermoscopy, CT, and MRI imaging modalities validate the effectiveness\nof MedSAM-CA. On dermoscopy dataset, MedSAM-CA achieves 94.43% Dice with only\n2% of full training data, reaching 97.25% of full-data training performance,\ndemonstrating strong effectiveness in low-resource clinical settings.",

Verification-Aware (VA)\nprogramming languages support DbC and formal verification at compile-time or\nrun-time, offering stronger correctness guarantees than traditional testing.\nHowever, despite the strong guarantees provided by VA languages, their adoption\nremains limited. In this study, we investigate the barriers to adopting VA\nlanguages by analyzing developer discussions on public forums using topic\nmodeling techniques. We complement this analysis with a developer survey to\nbetter understand the practical challenges associated with VA languages. Our\nfindings reveal key obstacles to adoption, including steep learning curves and\nusability issues. Based on these insights, we identify actionable\nrecommendations to improve the usability and accessibility of VA languages. Our\nfindings suggest that simplifying tool interfaces, providing better educational\nmaterials, and improving integration with everyday development environments\ncould improve the usability and adoption of these languages.

    "abstract": "Diffusion-based video motion customization facilitates the acquisition of\nhuman motion representations from a few video samples, while achieving\narbitrary subjects transfer through precise textual conditioning. Existing\napproaches often rely on semantic-level alignment, expecting the model to learn\nnew motion concepts and combine them with other entities (e.g., ''cats'' or\n''dogs'') to produce visually appealing results. However, video data involve\ncomplex spatio-temporal patterns, and focusing solely on semantics cause the\nmodel to overlook the visual complexity of motion. Conversely, tuning only the\nvisual representation leads to semantic confusion in representing the intended\naction. To address these limitations, we propose SynMotion, a new\nmotion-customized video generation model that jointly leverages semantic\nguidance and visual adaptation. At the semantic level, we introduce the\ndual-embedding semantic comprehension mechanism which disentangles subject and\nmotion representations, allowing the model to learn customized motion features\nwhile preserving its generative capabilities for diverse subjects. At the\nvisual level, we integrate parameter-efficient motion adapters into a\npre-trained video generation model to enhance motion fidelity and temporal\ncoherence. Furthermore, we introduce a new embedding-specific training strategy\nwhich \\textbf{alternately optimizes} subject and motion embeddings, supported\nby the manually constructed Subject Prior Video (SPV) training dataset. This\nstrategy promotes motion specificity while preserving generalization across\ndiverse subjects. Lastly, we introduce MotionBench, a newly curated benchmark\nwith diverse motion patterns. Experimental results across both T2V and I2V\nsettings demonstrate that \\method outperforms existing baselines. Project page:\nhttps://lucaria-academy.github.io/SynMotion/",

Our results show that the battle AI achieves an average win rate of\n80.8% across 50 wild encounters, only 6% lower than the performance of an\nexperienced human player. Furthermore, we find that a model's battle\nperformance correlates strongly with its LLM Arena score on language-related\ntasks, indicating a meaningful link between linguistic ability and strategic\nreasoning.

    "abstract": "Prostate and zonal segmentation is a crucial step for clinical diagnosis of\nprostate cancer (PCa). Computer-aided diagnosis tools for prostate segmentation\nare based on the deep learning (DL) paradigm. However, deep neural networks are\nperceived as \"black-box\" solutions by physicians, thus making them less\npractical for deployment in the clinical setting. In this paper, we introduce a\nfeed-forward machine learning model, named Green U-shaped Learning (GUSL),\nsuitable for medical image segmentation without backpropagation. GUSL\nintroduces a multi-layer regression scheme for coarse-to-fine segmentation. Its\nfeature extraction is based on a linear model, which enables seamless\ninterpretability during feature extraction. Also, GUSL introduces a mechanism\nfor attention on the prostate boundaries, which is an error-prone region, by\nemploying regression to refine the predictions through residue correction. In\naddition, a two-step pipeline approach is used to mitigate the class imbalance,\nan issue inherent in medical imaging problems. After conducting experiments on\ntwo publicly available datasets and one private dataset, in both prostate gland\nand zonal segmentation tasks, GUSL achieves state-of-the-art performance among\nother DL-based models. Notably, GUSL features a very energy-efficient pipeline,\nsince it has a model size several times smaller and less complexity than the\nrest of the solutions. In all datasets, GUSL achieved a Dice Similarity\nCoefficient (DSC) performance greater than $0.9$ for gland segmentation.\nConsidering also its lightweight model size and transparency in feature\nextraction, it offers a competitive and practical package for medical imaging\napplications.",

This could be the signature of a second mode excitation source.\nWith over 27 years of helioseismic data from the Sun as a star observations by\nthe Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SoHO), we aim to study the variation in\nmode energy over this period, covering solar Cycles 23, 24, and the beginning\nof Cycle 25.

We reconstruct the energy time series for\neach mode with a sampling time of 1.45 days. By combining the small-time-scale\nvariations in energy for several low-degree modes in the 2090-3710uHz range, we\nstudy the correlation between the modes and their compatibility with the\nhypothesis that modes are only stochastically excited by convection. The\nobserved excitation rate significantly deviates from what would be expected in\nthe case of a purely stochastic excitation. Our results indicate that this\nenergy excess cannot be only attributed to instrumental effects and does not\nexhibit a cyclic variation.

    "abstract": "Vision Transformer have set new benchmarks in several tasks, but these models\ncome with the lack of high computational costs which makes them impractical for\nresource limited hardware. Network pruning reduces the computational complexity\nby removing less important operations while maintaining performance. However,\npruning a model on an unseen data domain, leads to a misevaluation of weight\nsignificance, resulting in suboptimal resource assignment. In this work, we\nfind that task-sensitive layers initially fail to improve the feature\nrepresentation on downstream tasks, leading to performance loss for early\npruning decisions. To address this problem, we introduce Pruning by Block\nBenefit (P3B), a pruning method that utilizes the relative contribution on\nblock level to globally assign parameter resources. P3B identifies low-impact\ncomponents to reduce parameter allocation while preserving critical ones.\nClassical pruning mask optimization struggles to reactivate zero-mask-elements.\nIn contrast, P3B sets a layerwise keep ratio based on global performance\nmetrics, ensuring the reactivation of late-converging blocks. We show in\nextensive experiments that P3B is a state of the art pruning method with most\nnoticeable gains in transfer learning tasks. Notably, P3B is able to conserve\nhigh performance, even in high sparsity regimes of 70% parameter reduction\nwhile only losing 0.64% in accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities at\nsolving complex reasoning tasks with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, but\ntheir decision-making processes remain somewhat blackbox. We introduce\ntextbfinverse reasoning, a novel paradigm enabling LLMs to decompose and\nexplain their own reasoning chains post-hoc. Our approach, used in SAGE-nano, a\n4-billion-parameter reasoning model, employs a metacognitive structure that\nreflects back via attention processes to identify major decision points and\ngenerate explanations of reasoning choices. While typical CoT approaches are\ndirected towards forward reasoning generation, inverse reasoning provides\ninsight into why specific reasoning chains were selected over others. Through\nthorough testing of logical reasoning puzzles, math problems and ethical\ndilemmas from AQUA-RAT, CommonsenseQA, and customized benchmarks, we\ndemonstrate that SAGE-nano is at the cutting edge both on reasoning accuracy\n(74.6% on AQUA-RAT) and explanation quality (92.1% human preference score) for\nits task, and offers performance almost on par with models like Claude-3.5\nSonnet or GPT-4o. Our contributions are: (i) the first rigorous framework for\nLLM self-reflection via inverse reasoning, (ii) a novel metalearning framework\nto reverse the attention flow, (iii) comprehensive evaluation frameworks for\nreasoning transparency, and (iv) evidence that increasing reasoning using\ninverse reasoning improves interpretability along with reasoning performance.\nOur work creates new avenues for transparent AI systems and closes significant\ngaps in AI safety, education, and scientific discovery.",

    "abstract": "The ever-growing size of training datasets enhances the generalization\ncapability of modern machine learning models but also incurs exorbitant\ncomputational costs. Existing data pruning approaches aim to accelerate\ntraining by removing those less important samples. However, they often rely on\ngradients or proxy models, leading to prohibitive additional costs of gradient\nback-propagation and proxy model training. In this paper, we propose Partial\nForward Blocking (PFB), a novel framework for lossless training acceleration.\nThe efficiency of PFB stems from its unique adaptive pruning pipeline: sample\nimportance is assessed based on features extracted from the shallow layers of\nthe target model. Less important samples are then pruned, allowing only the\nretained ones to proceed with the subsequent forward pass and loss\nback-propagation. This mechanism significantly reduces the computational\noverhead of deep-layer forward passes and back-propagation for pruned samples,\nwhile also eliminating the need for auxiliary backward computations and proxy\nmodel training. Moreover, PFB introduces probability density as an indicator of\nsample importance. Combined with an adaptive distribution estimation module,\nour method dynamically prioritizes relatively rare samples, aligning with the\nconstantly evolving training state. Extensive experiments demonstrate the\nsignificant superiority of PFB in performance and speed. On ImageNet, PFB\nachieves a 0.5% accuracy improvement and 33% training time reduction with 40%\ndata pruned.",

    "abstract": "We consider a coded distributed computing problem in a ring-based\ncommunication network, where $N$ computing nodes are arranged in a ring\ntopology and each node can only communicate with its neighbors within a\nconstant distance $d$. To mitigate the communication bottleneck in exchanging\nintermediate values, we propose new coded distributed computing schemes for the\nring-based network that exploit both ring topology and redundant computation\n(i.e., each map function is computed by $r$ nodes). Two typical cases are\nconsidered: all-gather where each node requires all intermediate values mapped\nfrom all input files, and all-to-all where each node requires a distinct set of\nintermediate values from other nodes. For the all-gather case, we propose a new\ncoded scheme based on successive reverse carpooling where nodes transmit every\nencoded packet containing two messages traveling in opposite directions along\nthe same path. Theoretical converse proof shows that our scheme achieves the\noptimal tradeoff between communication load, computation load $r$, and\nbroadcast distance $d$ when $N\\gg d$. For the all-to-all case, instead of\nsimply repeating our all-gather scheme, we delicately deliver intermediate\nvalues based on their proximity to intended nodes to reduce unnecessary\ntransmissions. We derive an information-theoretic lower bound on the optimal\ncommunication load and show that our scheme is asymptotically optimal under the\ncyclic placement when $N\\gg r$. The optimality results indicate that in\nring-based networks, the redundant computation $r$ only leads to an additive\ngain in reducing communication load while the broadcast distance $d$\ncontributes to a multiplicative gain.",

We use the\nvalue-added data products (photometric redshift, stellar mass, rest-frame $U-V$\nand $V-J$ colors, and $A_{\\rm V}$) provided by the public DAWN JWST Archive.\nThis data product derives from fitting the spectral energy distributions\nobtained from multiple NIRCam imaging surveys, augmented with pre-existing HST\nimaging data.

    "abstract": "We present a class of models based on extended gauged flavour symmetries that\naddress the hierarchical structure of fermion masses in the Standard Model (SM)\nthrough the radiative mass generation mechanism. In these frameworks, only\nthird-generation fermions acquire tree-level masses, while the first and second\ngenerations gain their masses via quantum corrections induced by new gauge\nbosons, naturally explaining the observed mass hierarchy. Since the technically\nnatural structure of fermion masses in the SM prevents such a mechanism from\nbeing implemented directly, we propose extensions involving both Abelian and\nnon-Abelian gauge symmetries. Abelian extensions, which must be flavour\nnon-universal, typically generate masses for only second-generation fermions at\nthe 1-loop level, requiring higher order corrections or extension of gauge\nstructure to account for first-generation masses. We show that either a $U(1)_1\n\\times U(1)_2$ extension or a single $U(1)_F$ with up to 2-loop mass generation\ncan successfully realize the mechanism, with the latter predicting a viable new\nphysics scale around $10^3$ TeV when flavour-violating charges are optimized.\nNon-Abelian extensions, such as those based on $SU(3)_F$, provide a more\nconstrained and predictive setup due to a comparatively fewer number of free\nparameters. We also explore a radiative mechanism in Abelian extensions within\nleft-right symmetric theories, which simultaneously addresses the strong CP\nproblem. All these models collectively offer a compelling and testable\nframework for generating a realistic SM fermion mass spectrum.",

In the past two decades, generative models have emerged which\nproduce synthetic random flows at a computational cost equivalent to no more\nthan a few time-steps of a simulation. These simplified models qualitatively\nbear some characteristics of turbulent flows in specific contexts\n(incompressible 3D hydrodynamics or magnetohydrodynamics), but generally\nstruggle with the synthesis of coherent structures. We aim at generating random\nfields (e.g. velocity, density, magnetic fields, etc.) with realistic physical\nproperties for a large variety of governing partial differential equations and\nat a small cost relative to time-resolved simulations. We propose a set of\napproximations applied to given sets of partial differential equations, and\ntest the validity of our method in the simplest framework: 2D decaying\nincompressible hydrodynamical turbulence. We compare results of 2D decaying\nsimulations with snapshots of our synthetic turbulence. We assess\nquantitatively the difference first with standard statistical tools: power\nspectra, increments and structure functions. These indicators can be reproduced\nby our method during up to about a third of the turnover time scale. We also\nconsider recently developed scattering transforms statistics, able to\nefficiently characterise non-Gaussian structures. This reveals more significant\ndiscrepancy, which can however be bridged by bootstrapping. Finally, the number\nof Fourier transforms necessary for one synthesis scales logarithmically in the\nresolution, compared to linearly for time-resolved simulations.

    "abstract": "With a sustainable increase in the scale of power system, the number of\nstates in the state space grows exponentially, and the reliability assessment\nof the power system faces enormous challenges. Traditional state-by-state\nassessment methods, such as state enumeration (SE) and Monte Carlo simulation\n(MCS) methods, have encountered performance bottlenecks in terms of efficiency\nand accuracy. In this paper, the Boolean lattice representation theory of the\nstate space was studied, and a dichotomy method was proposed to efficiently\npartition the state space into some disjoint sub-lattices with a relatively\nsmall number of optimal power flow (OPF) operations. Based on lattice\npartition, the reliability indices of the entire space can be calculated\nlattice-by-lattice. In addition, alone with the partitioning procedure, the\ncalculated loss of load probability (LOLP) monotonically increases and rapidly\ntends to the analytic value with the designated error bound. Moreover, we\ndesigned a customized Monte Carlo sampling method in lattices of interest to\ncompute expected energy not supply (EENS). The experiments are conducted on the\nRBTS and RTS-79 systems. The results show that the proposed method achieves the\nanalytic LOLP of the RBTS system after five hundreds of OPF operations, which\nis about hundreds of times faster than traditional methods, and the designed\nMonte Carlo sampling method converged after thousands of OPF operations on test\nsystems.",

Recent studies have explored intelligent methods for MR\ndiagnosis to minimize user dependence and improve accuracy.

In this study, we introduce an\nautomated MR diagnosis model (MReg) developed on the 4-chamber cardiac color\nDoppler echocardiography video (A4C-CDV). It follows comprehensive feature\nmining strategies to detect MR and assess its severity, considering clinical\nrealities. Our contribution is threefold. First, we formulate the MR diagnosis\nas a regression task to capture the continuity and ordinal relationships\nbetween categories. Second, we design a feature selection and amplification\nmechanism to imitate the sonographer's diagnostic logic for accurate MR\ngrading. Third, inspired by the Mixture-of-Experts concept, we introduce a\nfeature summary module to extract the category-level features, enhancing the\nrepresentational capacity for more accurate grading. We trained and evaluated\nour proposed MReg on a large in-house A4C-CDV dataset comprising 1868 cases\nwith three graded regurgitation labels.

Previous work suggests that such tools shape people's moral\nand political judgements. However, the long-term implications of LLM-based\nsocial decision-making remain unknown. How will human cooperation be affected\nwhen the assessment of social interactions relies on language models? This is a\npressing question, as human cooperation is often driven by indirect\nreciprocity, reputations, and the capacity to judge interactions of others.\nHere, we assess how state-of-the-art LLMs judge cooperative actions. We provide\n21 different LLMs with an extensive set of examples where individuals cooperate\n-- or refuse cooperating -- in a range of social contexts, and ask how these\ninteractions should be judged. Furthermore, through an evolutionary\ngame-theoretical model, we evaluate cooperation dynamics in populations where\nthe extracted LLM-driven judgements prevail, assessing the long-term impact of\nLLMs on human prosociality. We observe a remarkable agreement in evaluating\ncooperation against good opponents. On the other hand, we notice within- and\nbetween-model variance when judging cooperation with ill-reputed individuals.\nWe show that the differences revealed between models can significantly impact\nthe prevalence of cooperation. Finally, we test prompts to steer LLM norms,\nshowing that such interventions can shape LLM judgements, particularly through\ngoal-oriented prompts. Our research connects LLM-based advices and long-term\nsocial dynamics, and highlights the need to carefully align LLM norms in order\nto preserve human cooperation.",

To overcome these limitations, we\npropose Geminet, a lightweight and scalable ML-based TE framework that can\nhandle changing topologies. Geminet is built upon two key insights: (i) a\nmethodology that decouples neural networks from topology by learning an\niterative gradient-descent-based adjustment process, as the update rule of\ngradient descent is topology-agnostic, relying only on a few gradient-related\nquantities; (ii) shifting optimization from path-level routing weights to\nedge-level dual variables, reducing memory consumption by leveraging the fact\nthat edges are far fewer than paths. Evaluations on WAN and data center\ndatasets show that Geminet significantly improves scalability. Its neural\nnetwork size is only 0.04% to 7% of existing schemes, while handling topology\nvariations as effectively as HARP, a state-of-the-art ML-based TE approach,\nwithout performance degradation.

    "abstract": "Consider a graph with n nodes and m edges, independent edge weights and\nlengths, and arbitrary distance demands for node pairs. The spanner problem\nasks for a minimum-weight subgraph that satisfies these demands via\nsufficiently short paths w.r.t. the edge lengths. For multiplicative\nalpha-spanners (where demands equal alpha times the original distances) and\nassuming that each edge's weight equals its length, the simple Greedy heuristic\nby Alth\\\"ofer et al. (1993) is known to yield strong solutions, both in theory\nand practice. To obtain guarantees in more general settings, recent\napproximations typically abandon this simplicity and practicality. Still, so\nfar, there is no known non-trivial approximation algorithm for the spanner\nproblem in its most general form. We provide two surprisingly simple\napproximations algorithms. In general, our Augmented Greedy achieves the first\nunconditional approximation ratio of m, which is non-trivial due to the\nindependence of weights and lengths. Crucially, it maintains all size and\nweight guarantees Greedy is known for, i.e., in the aforementioned\nmultiplicative alpha-spanner scenario and even for additive +beta-spanners.\nFurther, it generalizes some of these size guarantees to derive new weight\nguarantees. Our second approach, Randomized Rounding, establishes a graph\ntransformation that allows a simple rounding scheme over a standard\nmulticommodity flow LP.

    "abstract": "Quantum networks with independent sources allow observing quantum nonlocality\nor steering with just a single measurement per node of the network, or without\nany inputs. Inspired by the recently introduced notion of swap-steering, we\nconsider here the triangle network scenario without inputs, where one of the\nparties is trusted to perform a well-calibrated measurement. In this scenario,\nwe first propose a linear witness to detect triangle network swap-steering.\nThen, by using the correlations that achieve the maximum value of this\ninequality, and assuming that all the sources are the same, we can self-test\nthe state generated by the sources and the measurements of the untrusted party.\nWe then extend this framework to ring networks with an arbitrary number of\nnodes with one of them being trusted. Interestingly, this is the first example\nof a topologically robust, that is, one can observe steerability without\nassuming the network structure of the network, as well as noise-robust quantum\nadvantage in a network. Additionally, by allowing the trusted party to perform\ntomography of their subsystems, we demonstrate that every bipartite entangled\nstate will result in swap-steerable correlations in the ring network. For this\npurpose, we construct linear witnesses to detect ring network swap-steering\ncorresponding to every bipartite entangled state.",

    "abstract": "Audio-Visual Segmentation (AVS) aims to segment sound-producing objects in\nvideo frames based on the associated audio signal. Prevailing AVS methods\ntypically adopt an audio-centric Transformer architecture, where object queries\nare derived from audio features. However, audio-centric Transformers suffer\nfrom two limitations: perception ambiguity caused by the mixed nature of audio,\nand weakened dense prediction ability due to visual detail loss. To address\nthese limitations, we propose a new Vision-Centric Transformer (VCT) framework\nthat leverages vision-derived queries to iteratively fetch corresponding audio\nand visual information, enabling queries to better distinguish between\ndifferent sounding objects from mixed audio and accurately delineate their\ncontours. Additionally, we also introduce a Prototype Prompted Query Generation\n(PPQG) module within our VCT framework to generate vision-derived queries that\nare both semantically aware and visually rich through audio prototype prompting\nand pixel context grouping, facilitating audio-visual information aggregation.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that our VCT framework achieves new\nstate-of-the-art performances on three subsets of the AVSBench dataset.

Specifically, we demonstrate that the\nprivacy-preserving computation process for defending against model poisoning\nattacks inadvertently leaks privacy to one of the honest-but-curious servers,\nenabling it to access users' gradients in plaintext. To address both privacy\nleakage and model poisoning attacks, we propose an enhanced privacy-preserving\nand Byzantine-robust federated learning (PBFL) scheme, comprising three\ncomponents: (1) a two-trapdoor fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) scheme to\nbolster users' privacy protection; (2) a novel secure normalization judgment\nmethod to preemptively thwart gradient poisoning; and (3) an innovative secure\ncosine similarity measurement method for detecting model poisoning attacks\nwithout compromising data privacy. Our scheme guarantees privacy preservation\nand resilience against model poisoning attacks, even in scenarios with\nheterogeneous, non-IID (Independently and Identically Distributed) datasets.\nTheoretical analyses substantiate the security and efficiency of our scheme,\nand extensive experiments corroborate the efficacy of our private attacks.\nFurthermore, the experimental results demonstrate that our scheme accelerates\ntraining speed while reducing communication overhead compared to the\nstate-of-the-art PBFL schemes.",

Standard\ndiffusion models achieve high-quality image reconstruction but require a large\nnumber of sampling steps during inference, resulting in substantial\ncomputational overhead. Although skip-sampling strategies have been proposed to\nimprove efficiency, they often lead to loss of fine structural details. To\naddress this issue, we propose a prior information embedding and wavelet\nfeature fusion fast sampling diffusion model for LACT reconstruction. The PWD\nenables efficient sampling while preserving reconstruction fidelity in LACT,\nand effectively mitigates the degradation typically introduced by\nskip-sampling. Specifically, during the training phase, PWD maps the\ndistribution of LACT images to that of fully sampled target images, enabling\nthe model to learn structural correspondences between them. During inference,\nthe LACT image serves as an explicit prior to guide the sampling trajectory,\nallowing for high-quality reconstruction with significantly fewer steps. In\naddition, PWD performs multi-scale feature fusion in the wavelet domain,\neffectively enhancing the reconstruction of fine details by leveraging both\nlow-frequency and high-frequency information. Quantitative and qualitative\nevaluations on clinical dental arch CBCT and periapical datasets demonstrate\nthat PWD outperforms existing methods under the same sampling condition.

However, these approaches face\nsignificant computational efficiency challenges. For instance, current\ntechniques may require tens of minutes to super-resolve a mere 2-second, 1080p\nvideo. In this paper, we present TurboVSR, an ultra-efficient diffusion-based\nvideo super-resolution model. Our core design comprises three key aspects: (1)\nWe employ an autoencoder with a high compression ratio of 32$\\times$32$\\times$8\nto reduce the number of tokens. (2) Highly compressed latents pose substantial\nchallenges for training. We introduce factorized conditioning to mitigate the\nlearning complexity: we first learn to super-resolve the initial frame;\nsubsequently, we condition the super-resolution of the remaining frames on the\nhigh-resolution initial frame and the low-resolution subsequent frames. (3) We\nconvert the pre-trained diffusion model to a shortcut model to enable fewer\nsampling steps, further accelerating inference. As a result, TurboVSR performs\non par with state-of-the-art VSR methods, while being 100+ times faster, taking\nonly 7 seconds to process a 2-second long 1080p video. TurboVSR also supports\nimage resolution by considering image as a one-frame video.

Hence, this\nnanocomposite provides a useful experimental system to investigate the\nrelationship between the structural disorder and the establishment of the\nsuperconducting phase coherence. In this work, we show from 3D focused ion beam\nscanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM) data that in the nanocomposite, a\ncomplex MgO/MgB2 microstructure spreads isotropically throughout the sample\nwith a constant fractal dimension of ~1.67. Atomic-resolution scanning\ntransmission electron microscopy (STEM) has revealed that the MgO/MgB2\ninterfaces are atomically clean and free from amorphous grain boundaries, even\nleading to atomically coherent interfaces. Detailed ac susceptibility\nmeasurements have demonstrated a smooth crossover from an intragranular to an\nintergranular superconducting regime, giving evidence of the establishment of\nthe critical state due to strong intergranular coupling just below the\nsuperconducting transition temperature. Also, spatially-resolved\ncathodoluminescence measurements have demonstrated that oxygen vacancies in the\nMgO-rich phase tend to aggregate near the MgO/MgB2 boundary regions, forming\nlong channels of oxygen vacancies through the nanocomposite.

To address this, we propose\nPGOV3D, a novel framework that introduces a Partial-to-Global curriculum for\nimproving open-vocabulary 3D semantic segmentation. The key innovation lies in\na two-stage training strategy. In the first stage, we pre-train the model on\npartial scenes that provide dense semantic information but relatively simple\ngeometry. These partial point clouds are derived from multi-view RGB-D inputs\nvia pixel-wise depth projection. To enable open-vocabulary learning, we\nleverage a multi-modal large language model (MLLM) and a 2D segmentation\nfoundation model to generate open-vocabulary labels for each viewpoint,\noffering rich and aligned supervision. An auxiliary inter-frame consistency\nmodule is introduced to enforce feature consistency across varying viewpoints\nand enhance spatial understanding. In the second stage, we fine-tune the model\non complete scene-level point clouds, which are sparser and structurally more\ncomplex. We aggregate the partial vocabularies associated with each scene and\ngenerate pseudo labels using the pre-trained model, effectively bridging the\nsemantic gap between dense partial observations and large-scale 3D\nenvironments.

    "abstract": "It is shown that magnetic islands generated by pressure-gradient-driven\nturbulence are common across a wide range of conditions. The interaction among\nturbulence, magnetic island and other large scale structures (the zonal flow\nand the zonal current), largely determines the dynamics of the system.\nTurbulence takes a background role, providing energy to the large-scale\nstructures, without influencing their evolution directly. The growth of the\nzonal current is linearly related to that of the magnetic island, while the\nzonal flow has a strongly sheared region where the island has its maximum\nradial extension. The zonal current is found to slow down the formation of\nlarge-scale magnetic islands, while the zonal flow is needed to have the system\nmove its energy to larger and larger scales. The driving instability in the\nsystem is the fluid Kinetic Ballooning Mode (KBM) instability at high beta,\nwhile the tearing mode is kept stable. The formation of magnetic-island-like\nstructures at the spatial scale of the fluid KBM instability is observed quite\nearly in the non-linear phase for most cases studied, and a slow coalescence\nprocess evolves the magnetic structures towards larger and larger scales. Cases\nthat did not show this coalescence process, nor the formation of the small\nscale island-like structures, were seen to have narrower mode structures for\ncomparable instability growth rates, which was achieved by varying the magnetic\nshear. The islands often end up exceeding the radial box size late in the\nnon-linear phase, showing unbounded growth. The impact on the pressure profile\nof turbulence driven magnetic islands is not trivial, showing flattening of the\npressure profile only far from the resonance, where the zonal flow is weaker,\nand the appearance of said flattening is slow, after the island has reached a\nsufficiently large size, when compared with collisional time scales.",

    "abstract": "Diffusion and flow matching models have significantly advanced media\ngeneration, yet their design space is well-explored, somewhat limiting further\nimprovements. Concurrently, autoregressive (AR) models, particularly those\ngenerating continuous tokens, have emerged as a promising direction for\nunifying text and media generation. This paper introduces Transition Matching\n(TM), a novel discrete-time, continuous-state generative paradigm that unifies\nand advances both diffusion/flow models and continuous AR generation. TM\ndecomposes complex generation tasks into simpler Markov transitions, allowing\nfor expressive non-deterministic probability transition kernels and arbitrary\nnon-continuous supervision processes, thereby unlocking new flexible design\navenues. We explore these choices through three TM variants: (i) Difference\nTransition Matching (DTM), which generalizes flow matching to discrete-time by\ndirectly learning transition probabilities, yielding state-of-the-art image\nquality and text adherence as well as improved sampling efficiency. (ii)\nAutoregressive Transition Matching (ARTM) and (iii) Full History Transition\nMatching (FHTM) are partially and fully causal models, respectively, that\ngeneralize continuous AR methods. They achieve continuous causal AR generation\nquality comparable to non-causal approaches and potentially enable seamless\nintegration with existing AR text generation techniques. Notably, FHTM is the\nfirst fully causal model to match or surpass the performance of flow-based\nmethods on text-to-image task in continuous domains. We demonstrate these\ncontributions through a rigorous large-scale comparison of TM variants and\nrelevant baselines, maintaining a fixed architecture, training data, and\nhyperparameters.",

Early\nattempts are only performed to defend against adversarial patches, leaving AT\nagainst a wider range of physically realizable attacks under-explored. In this\nwork, we consider defending against various physically realizable attacks with\na unified AT method. We propose PBCAT, a novel Patch-Based Composite\nAdversarial Training strategy. PBCAT optimizes the model by incorporating the\ncombination of small-area gradient-guided adversarial patches and imperceptible\nglobal adversarial perturbations covering the entire image. With these designs,\nPBCAT has the potential to defend against not only adversarial patches but also\nunseen physically realizable attacks such as adversarial textures.

    "abstract": "The deployment of robot assistants in large indoor spaces has seen\nsignificant growth, with escorting tasks becoming a key application. However,\nmost current escorting robots primarily rely on navigation-focused strategies,\nassuming that the person being escorted will follow without issue. In crowded\nenvironments, this assumption often falls short, as individuals may struggle to\nkeep pace, become obstructed, get distracted, or need to stop unexpectedly. As\na result, conventional robotic systems are often unable to provide effective\nescorting services due to their limited understanding of human movement\ndynamics. To address these challenges, an effective escorting robot must\ncontinuously detect and interpret human actions during the escorting process\nand adjust its movement accordingly. However, there is currently no existing\ndataset designed specifically for human action detection in the context of\nescorting. Given that escorting often occurs in crowded environments, where\nother individuals may enter the robot's camera view, the robot also needs to\nidentify the specific human it is escorting (the subject) before predicting\ntheir actions. Since no existing model performs both person re-identification\nand action prediction in real-time, we propose a novel neural network\narchitecture that can accomplish both tasks. This enables the robot to adjust\nits speed dynamically based on the escortee's movements and seamlessly resume\nescorting after any disruption. In comparative evaluations against strong\nbaselines, our system demonstrates superior efficiency and effectiveness,\nshowcasing its potential to significantly improve robotic escorting services in\ncomplex, real-world scenarios.",

These challenges hinder\napplications such as environmental monitoring, disaster response, and\nagricultural management, which require fine-grained and high-resolution data.\nIn this paper, we propose MWT-Diff, an innovative framework for satellite image\nsuper-resolution (SR) that combines latent diffusion models with wavelet\ntransforms to address these challenges. At the core of the framework is a novel\nmetadata-, wavelet-, and time-aware encoder (MWT-Encoder), which generates\nembeddings that capture metadata attributes, multi-scale frequency information,\nand temporal relationships. The embedded feature representations steer the\nhierarchical diffusion dynamics, through which the model progressively\nreconstructs high-resolution satellite imagery from low-resolution inputs. This\nprocess preserves critical spatial characteristics including textural patterns,\nboundary discontinuities, and high-frequency spectral components essential for\ndetailed remote sensing analysis. The comparative analysis of MWT-Diff across\nmultiple datasets demonstrated favorable performance compared to recent\napproaches, as measured by standard perceptual quality metrics including FID\nand LPIPS.",

    "abstract": "Current multi-view 3D object detection methods typically transfer 2D features\ninto 3D space using depth estimation or 3D position encoder, but in a fully\ndata-driven and implicit manner, which limits the detection performance.\nInspired by the success of radiance fields on 3D reconstruction, we assume they\ncan be used to enhance the detector's ability of 3D geometry estimation.\nHowever, we observe a decline in detection performance, when we directly use\nthem for 3D rendering as an auxiliary task. From our analysis, we find the\nperformance drop is caused by the strong responses on the background when\nrendering the whole scene. To address this problem, we propose object-centric\nradiance fields, focusing on modeling foreground objects while discarding\nbackground noises. Specifically, we employ Object-centric Radiance Fields\n(OcRF) to enhance 3D voxel features via an auxiliary task of rendering\nforeground objects. We further use opacity - the side-product of rendering- to\nenhance the 2D foreground BEV features via Height-aware Opacity-based Attention\n(HOA), where attention maps at different height levels are generated separately\nvia multiple networks in parallel. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes\nvalidation and test datasets demonstrate that our OcRFDet achieves superior\nperformance, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods with 57.2$\\%$ mAP\nand 64.8$\\%$ NDS on the nuScenes test benchmark.

    "abstract": "The unstable isotope $^{60}$Fe, with a half-life of 2.6 million years, is\nproduced primarily in supernova explosions. The observed presence of $^{60}$Fe\nin cosmic rays and its detection in deep-sea crusts and sediments suggest two\npossible scenarios: either the direct acceleration of $^{60}$Fe from supernova\nejecta or its enrichment in the circumstellar material surrounding supernova\nprogenitors, which indicates cosmic ray production in clusters of supernovae.\nFocusing on the latter scenario, we consider an environment shaped by\nsuccessive supernova explosions, reminiscent of the Local Bubble around the\ntime of the most recent supernova explosion. We independently tracked the\nevolution of the $^{60}$Fe mass ratio within the Local Bubble using passive\nscalars. To investigate the spectra of protons and $^{60}$Fe, we explicitly\nmodelled cosmic-ray acceleration and transport at the remnant of the last\nsupernova by simultaneously solving the hydrodynamical equations for the\nsupernova outflow and the transport equations for cosmic rays, scattering\nturbulence, and large-scale magnetic field, using the time-dependent\nacceleration code RATPaC. The main uncertainty in our prediction of the local\n$^{60}$Fe flux at about $pc=1$ GeV/nuc is the magnetic-field structure in the\nLocal Bubble and the cosmic-ray diffusion beyond the approximately $100$ kyr of\nevolution covered by our study. We found that if the standard galactic\npropagation applies, the local $^{60}$Fe flux would be around 3% of that\nmeasured. If there is a sustained reduction in the diffusion coefficient at and\nnear the Local Bubble, then the expected $^{60}$Fe flux could be up to 30% of\nthat measured.",

Second, these questions are reformulated\ninto an open-ended format and filtered using a multi-model voting technique to\neliminate shortcut cases related to guessing and memorization, ensuring robust\nreasoning evaluations. Third, we annotate the questions with detailed\nstep-by-step solutions, and design a reference-based ternary scoring mechanism\nto reliably assess intermediate reasoning steps.

To address this problem, a novel loss\nfunction is proposed, named Loss function for Hard High-quality Face (LH2Face).\nFirstly, a similarity measure based on the von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution\nis stated, specifically focusing on the logarithm of the Probability Density\nFunction (PDF), which represents the distance between a probability\ndistribution and a vector.

Finally, a renderer is constructed that\noptimizes FR through face reconstruction and vice versa.

In this\nstudy, we use a ten-hour nighttime observation of the bright radio source 3C48,\ncarried out with the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT), to\nexamine how ionospheric conditions affect radio signals. We focus on measuring\nphase fluctuations caused by the ionosphere and analyse how these variations\nchange with antenna separation using the spatial phase structure function. Our\nresults, based on data from three sub-bands between 575 and 725~MHz, show a\nclear power-law trend consistent with turbulent behaviour. We introduce the\ndiffractive scale as a scalar measure of ionospheric conditions, which could\nguide future calibration strategies. Furthermore, we find that the turbulence\nis anisotropic, with properties that vary by direction. The smallest\ndiffractive scales do not always align with Earth's magnetic field, suggesting\nthe influence of medium-scale Travelling Ionospheric Disturbances (MSTIDs). The\ncontribution of these wave-like MSTIDs to the structure function follows a\npower-law with a slope close to 2.0, indicating their dominant role in shaping\nthe observed anisotropic phase fluctuations.",

To address these limitations, we propose the\ncross-iterative Alignment and Fusion deep Unfolding Network (AFUNet), where HDR\nreconstruction is systematically decoupled into two interleaved subtasks --\nalignment and fusion -- optimized through alternating refinement, achieving\nsynergy between the two subtasks to enhance the overall performance. Our method\nformulates multi-exposure HDR reconstruction from a Maximum A Posteriori (MAP)\nestimation perspective, explicitly incorporating spatial correspondence priors\nacross LDR images and naturally bridging the alignment and fusion subproblems\nthrough joint constraints. Building on the mathematical foundation, we\nreimagine traditional iterative optimization through unfolding -- transforming\nthe conventional solution process into an end-to-end trainable AFUNet with\ncarefully designed modules that work progressively. Specifically, each\niteration of AFUNet incorporates an Alignment-Fusion Module (AFM) that\nalternates between a Spatial Alignment Module (SAM) for alignment and a Channel\nFusion Module (CFM) for adaptive feature fusion, progressively bridging\nmisaligned content and exposure discrepancies.

These escalating trends underscore the urgent\nneed for effective approaches that can automatically detect and understand\nsoftware vulnerabilities. Objective: However, the scarcity of labeled samples\nand the class imbalance issue in vulnerability datasets present significant\nchallenges for both Vulnerability Type Prediction (VTP) and Line-level\nVulnerability Detection (LVD), especially for rare yet critical vulnerability\ntypes. Moreover, most existing studies treat VTP and LVD as independent tasks,\noverlooking their inherent correlation, which limits the potential to leverage\nshared semantic patterns across tasks. Methods: To address these limitations,\nwe propose a unified approach that integrates Embedding-Layer Driven\nAdversarial Training (EDAT) with Multi-task Learning (MTL). Specifically, EDAT\nenhances model robustness by introducing adversarial perturbations to\nidentifier embeddings, guided by semantic importance. Meanwhile, MTL improves\noverall performance by leveraging shared representations and inter-task\ncorrelations between VTP and LVD. Results: Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat our proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on both VTP\nand LVD tasks. For VTP, it yields notable improvements in accuracy, precision,\nrecall, and F1-score, particularly in identifying rare vulnerability types.\nSimilarly, for LVD, our approach enhances line-level detection accuracy while\nsignificantly reducing false positives. Conclusion: Our study demonstrates that\ncombining EDAT with MTL provides a unified solution that improves performance\non both tasks and warrants further investigation.",

    "abstract": "This work-in-progress investigates the memorization, creativity, and nonsense\nfound in cooking recipes generated from Large Language Models (LLMs).\nPrecisely, we aim (i) to analyze memorization, creativity, and non-sense in\nLLMs using a small, high-quality set of human judgments and (ii) to evaluate\npotential approaches to automate such a human annotation in order to scale our\nstudy to hundreds of recipes. To achieve (i), we conduct a detailed human\nannotation on 20 preselected recipes generated by LLM (Mixtral), extracting\neach recipe's ingredients and step-by-step actions to assess which elements are\nmemorized--i.e., directly traceable to online sources possibly seen during\ntraining--and which arise from genuine creative synthesis or outright nonsense.\nWe find that Mixtral consistently reuses ingredients that can be found in\nonline documents, potentially seen during model training, suggesting strong\nreliance on memorized content. To achieve aim (ii) and scale our analysis\nbeyond small sample sizes and single LLM validation, we design an\n``LLM-as-judge'' pipeline that automates recipe generation, nonsense detection,\nparsing ingredients and recipe steps, and their annotation. For instance,\ncomparing its output against human annotations, the best ingredient extractor\nand annotator is Llama 3.1+Gemma 2 9B, achieving up to 78% accuracy on\ningredient matching. This automated framework enables large-scale\nquantification of memorization, creativity, and nonsense in generated recipes,\nproviding rigorous evidence of the models' creative capacities.",

    "abstract": "Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) represents a key paradigm for\nfuture wireless networks. However, existing approaches require waveform\nmodifications, dedicated pilots, or overhead that complicates standards\nintegration. We propose sensing for free - performing multi-source localization\nwithout pilots by reusing uplink data symbols, making sensing occur during\ntransmission and directly compatible with 3GPP 5G NR and 6G specifications.\nWith ever-increasing devices in dense 6G networks, this approach is\nparticularly compelling when combined with sparse arrays, which can localize\nmore sources than uniform arrays via an enlarged virtual array. Existing\npilot-free multi-source localization algorithms first reconstruct an extended\ncovariance matrix and apply subspace methods, incurring cubic complexity and\nlimited to second-order statistics. Performance degrades under non-Gaussian\ndata symbols and few snapshots, and higher-order statistics remain unexploited.\nWe address these challenges with an attention-only transformer that directly\nprocesses raw signal snapshots for grid-less end-to-end direction-of-arrival\n(DOA) estimation. The model efficiently captures higher-order statistics while\nbeing permutation-invariant and adaptive to varying snapshot counts. Our\nalgorithm greatly outperforms state-of-the-art AI-based benchmarks with over\n30x reduction in parameters and runtime, and enjoys excellent generalization\nunder practical mismatches. Applied to multi-user MIMO beam training, our\nalgorithm can localize uplink DOAs of multiple users during data transmission.\nThrough angular reciprocity, estimated uplink DOAs prune downlink beam sweeping\ncandidates and improve throughput via sensing-assisted beam management. This\nwork shows how reusing existing data transmission for sensing can enhance both\nmulti-source localization and beam management in 3GPP efforts towards 6G.",

Existing approaches for multi-robot\nrelative localization often depend on costly or short-range sensors like\ncameras and LiDARs. Consequently, these approaches face challenges such as high\ncomputational overhead (e.g., map merging) and difficulties in disjoint\nenvironments. To address this limitation, this paper introduces MGPRL, a novel\ndistributed framework for multi-robot relative localization using convex-hull\nof multiple Wi-Fi access points (AP). To accomplish this, we employ\nco-regionalized multi-output Gaussian Processes for efficient Radio Signal\nStrength Indicator (RSSI) field prediction and perform uncertainty-aware\nmulti-AP localization, which is further coupled with weighted convex hull-based\nalignment for robust relative pose estimation. Each robot predicts the RSSI\nfield of the environment by an online scan of APs in its environment, which are\nutilized for position estimation of multiple APs. To perform relative\nlocalization, each robot aligns the convex hull of its predicted AP locations\nwith that of the neighbor robots. This approach is well-suited for devices with\nlimited computational resources and operates solely on widely available Wi-Fi\nRSSI measurements without necessitating any dedicated pre-calibration or\noffline fingerprinting. We rigorously evaluate the performance of the proposed\nMGPRL in ROS simulations and demonstrate it with real-world experiments,\ncomparing it against multiple state-of-the-art approaches.

    "abstract": "Fuzzing is highly effective in detecting bugs due to the key contribution of\nrandomness. However, randomness significantly reduces the efficiency of\nfuzzing, causing it to cost days or weeks to expose bugs. Even though directed\nfuzzing reduces randomness by guiding fuzzing towards target buggy locations,\nthe dilemma of randomness still challenges directed fuzzers. Two critical\ncomponents, which are seeds and mutators, contain randomness and are closely\ntied to the conditions required for triggering bugs. Therefore, to address the\nchallenge of randomness, we propose to use large language models (LLMs) to\nremove the randomness in seeds and reduce the randomness in mutators. With\ntheir strong reasoning and code generation capabilities, LLMs can be used to\ngenerate reachable seeds that target pre-determined locations and to construct\nbug-specific mutators tailored for specific bugs. We propose RandLuzz, which\nintegrates LLMs and directed fuzzing, to improve the quality of seeds and\nmutators, resulting in efficient bug exposure. RandLuzz analyzes function call\nchain or functionality to guide LLMs in generating reachable seeds. To\nconstruct bug-specific mutators, RandLuzz uses LLMs to perform bug analysis,\nobtaining information such as bug causes and mutation suggestions, which\nfurther help generate code that performs bug-specific mutations. We evaluate\nRandLuzz by comparing it with four state-of-the-art directed fuzzers, AFLGo,\nBeacon, WindRanger, and SelectFuzz. With RandLuzz-generated seeds, the fuzzers\nachieve an average speedup ranging from 2.1$\\times$ to 4.8$\\times$ compared to\nusing widely-used initial seeds. Additionally, when evaluated on individual\nbugs, RandLuzz achieves up to a 2.7$\\times$ speedup compared to the\nsecond-fastest exposure. On 8 bugs, RandLuzz can even expose them within 60\nseconds.",

This limitation in earlier methods often led to unreliable\nconclusions when generalized to larger codebooks.

    "abstract": "Driven by large-scale contrastive vision-language pre-trained models such as\nCLIP, recent advancements in the image-text matching task have achieved\nremarkable success in representation learning. Due to image-level\nvisual-language alignment, CLIP falls short in understanding fine-grained\ndetails such as object attributes and spatial relationships between objects.\nRecent efforts have attempted to compel CLIP to acquire structured visual\nrepresentations by introducing prompt learning to achieve object-level\nalignment. While achieving promising results, they still lack the capability to\nperceive actions, which are crucial for describing the states or relationships\nbetween objects. Therefore, we propose to endow CLIP with fine-grained\naction-level understanding by introducing an LLM-enhanced action-aware\nmulti-modal prompt-tuning method, incorporating the action-related external\nknowledge generated by large language models (LLMs). Specifically, we design an\naction triplet prompt and an action state prompt to exploit compositional\nsemantic knowledge and state-related causal knowledge implicitly stored in\nLLMs. Subsequently, we propose an adaptive interaction module to aggregate\nattentive visual features conditioned on action-aware prompted knowledge for\nestablishing discriminative and action-aware visual representations, which\nfurther improves the performance.

    "abstract": "Chemical Reaction Networks (CRNs) provide a powerful framework for modeling\ncomplex systems due to their compositionality, which makes them well-suited for\nanalyzing interactions of subsystems within larger aggregate systems. This work\npresents a thermodynamic formalism for ranking CRN pathways under fixed\nthroughput currents (fixed velocities of species flowing in and out of the\nsystem), where pathways represent subnetworks capable of performing the\nstipulated chemical conversion. We define a thermodynamic cost function for\npathways derived from the large-deviation theory of stochastic CRNs, which\ndecomposes into two components: an ongoing maintenance cost to sustain a\nnon-equilibrium steady state (NESS), and a restriction cost, quantifying the\nongoing improbability of neutralizing reactions outside the specified pathway.\nApplying this formalism to detailed-balanced CRNs in the linear response\nregime, we prove that the resistance of a CRN decreases as reactions are added\nthat support the throughput current, and that the maintenance cost, the\nrestriction cost, and the thermodynamic cost of nested pathways are bounded\nbelow by those of their hosting network. Extending the analysis far from\nequilibrium, we find that while cost is non-decreasing for progressively more\nrestricted nested pathways near equilibrium, multimolecular CRN examples can be\nfound that assign lower costs to more restricted pathways at\nfar-from-equilibrium NESSs. The possibility to reduce the resistance of a\nnetwork at fixed throughput, while also simplifying the network, may have\nimplications for enzyme family evolution, in which novel reaction mechanisms\nmay first lead to a proliferation of pathways through non-specific catalysis,\nbut later selection for specificity may benefit both from species retention,\nand more efficient use of autocatalysts to improve throughput.",

To\nthis end, we first review current NF channel models and analyze the differences\nbetween the existing 3GPP TR 38.901 channel model and the NF channel model,\nincluding the spherical wavefront and spatially non-stationarity.

Using state-of-the-art\nquantum electrodynamic density functional theory (QEDFT) calculations, we\ndemonstrate that strong light-matter coupling can reconfigure both the\nelectronic and ionic structures of HgTe, driving the system into Weyl,\nnodal-line, or topological insulator phases.

    "abstract": "Thermal diodes that enable directional heat transport are essential for\nadvanced thermal management in microelectronics, energy systems, and thermal\nlogic devices. However, existing designs based on phase-change materials,\nnanostructures, or interfacial engineering suffer from limited rectification\nperformance, configurational inflexibility, and poor scalability. Here, we\npresent a thermomechanical metamaterial-based thermal diode that combines\ntemperature-responsive actuation with structural bistability to achieve\nhigh-efficiency, nonreciprocal thermal transport. The device integrates shape\nmemory alloy (SMA) springs with pre-buckled copper strips that undergo\nsnap-through transitions in response to thermal gradients. This reconfiguration\nenables contact-based conduction in the forward mode and suppresses reverse\nheat flow via radiative isolation. We develop a coupled analytical model\ncombining Euler-Bernoulli beam theory and a thermal resistance network, and\nvalidate the system through finite element (FE) simulations and experiments.\nThe device achieves a thermal rectification ratio exceeding 900, with robust\ncycling stability and structural integrity. A modular stacking strategy further\nenhances scalability without compromising performance.

Stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIMs) have emerged as a\npromising technology for realizing wave-domain signal processing, with mobile\nSIMs offering superior communication performance compared to their fixed\ncounterparts. In this paper, we investigate a novel unmanned aerial vehicle\n(UAV)-mounted SIMs (UAV-SIMs) assisted communication system within the\nlow-altitude economy (LAE) networks paradigm, where UAVs function as both base\nstations that cache SIM-processed data and mobile platforms that flexibly\ndeploy SIMs to enhance uplink communications from ground users. To maximize\nnetwork capacity, we formulate a UAV-SIM-based joint optimization problem\n(USBJOP) that comprehensively addresses three critical aspects: the association\nbetween UAV-SIMs and users, the three-dimensional positioning of UAV-SIMs, and\nthe phase shifts across multiple SIM layers. Due to the inherent non-convexity\nand NP-hardness of USBJOP, we decompose it into three sub-optimization\nproblems, \\textit{i.e.}, association between UAV-SIMs and users optimization\nproblem (AUUOP), UAV location optimization problem (ULOP), and UAV-SIM phase\nshifts optimization problem (USPSOP), and solve them using an alternating\noptimization strategy. Specifically, we transform AUUOP and ULOP into convex\nforms solvable by the CVX tool, while addressing USPSOP through a generative\nartificial intelligence (GAI)-based hybrid optimization algorithm. Simulations\ndemonstrate that our proposed approach significantly outperforms benchmark\nschemes, achieving approximately 1.5 times higher network capacity compared to\nsuboptimal alternatives.

    "abstract": "Understanding Titan's planetary boundary layer (PBL)-the lowest region of the\natmosphere influenced by surface conditions-remains challenging due to Titan's\nthick atmosphere and limited observations. Previous modeling studies have\nproduced inconsistent estimates of surface temperature variability, a critical\ndeterminant of PBL behavior, often without clear explanations grounded in\nsurface energy balance. Here, we develop a theoretical framework and apply a\nthree-dimensional dry general circulation model (GCM) to investigate how\nsurface thermal inertia influences surface energy balance and temperature\nvariability across diurnal and seasonal timescales. At diurnal timescales,\nlower thermal inertia surfaces experience larger temperature fluctuations and\nenhanced daytime sensible heat fluxes due to less efficient subsurface heat\nconduction. In contrast, at seasonal timescales, surface temperature variations\nshow weak sensitivity to thermal inertia, as atmospheric damping tends to\ndominate over subsurface conduction. The PBL depth ranges from a few hundred\nmeters to 1,000m on diurnal timescales, while seasonal maxima reach 2,000m,\nsupporting the interpretation from a previous study that the Huygens probe\ncaptured the two PBL structures. Simulated seasonal winds at the Huygens\nlanding site successfully reproduce key observed features, including\nnear-surface retrograde winds and meridional wind reversals within the lowest\nfew kilometers, consistent with Titan's cross-equatorial Hadley circulation.\nSimulations for the planned Dragonfly landing site predict shallower thermal\nPBLs with smaller fluctuation amplitudes, while maintaining similar wind\npatterns.

    "abstract": "Over the past 20 years, many new hadron states have been discovered, but\nunderstanding their nature remains a key experimental and theoretical\nchallenge. Recent studies have established that hadron-hadron interactions\nprimarily govern the generation of new hadronic states, with their spectroscopy\nserving as a powerful tool for probing these interactions and determining the\ncorresponding compositeness. In this work, we study four scenarios to determine\nthe $DK$ interaction by reproducing the mass of the $D_{s0}^*(2317)$, i.e.,\nassuming the $D_{s0}^*(2317)$ as a $DK$ molecule, a mixture of a $DK$ molecule\nand a bare state, a $DK-D_s\\eta$ molecule, and a mixture of a $DK-D_s\\eta$\nmolecule and a bare state. Using the $D^{0}K^{+}$ interactions derived from\nthese scenarios, we predict the $D^{0}K^{+}$ correlation functions. Our results\ndemonstrate that the inclusion of a bare state significantly alters the\nlineshape of the $D^{0}K^{+}$ correlation functions. These variations provide\nkey physical observables to probe the internal structure of the\n$D_{s0}^*(2317)$. Using the shallow bound state candidate $X(3872)$ as input,\nwe study the impact of including a bare state on the lineshape of the\n$D^0\\bar{D}^{*0}$ correlation functions, revealing more pronounced variations.\nOur analysis provides critical insights into the internal structure of exotic\nhadronic states via momentum correlation measurements.",

However, the accuracy of single-node sensing\nin ISAC system is limited, prompting the emergence of multi-node cooperative\nsensing. In multi-node cooperative sensing, the synchronization error limits\nthe sensing accuracy, which can be mitigated by the architecture of cell-free\nmassive multi-input multi-output (CF-mMIMO), since the multiple nodes are\ninterconnected via optical fibers with high synchronization accuracy. However,\nthe multi-node cooperative sensing in CF-mMIMO ISAC systems faces the following\nchallenges: 1) The joint optimization of placement and resource allocation of\ndistributed access points (APs) to improve the sensing performance in\nmulti-target detection scenario is difficult; 2) The fusion of the sensing\ninformation from distributed APs with multi-view discrepancies is difficult. To\naddress these challenges, this paper proposes a joint placement and antenna\nresource optimization scheme for distributed APs to minimize the sensing\nCramr-Rao bound for targets' parameters within the area of interest. Then, a\nsymbol-level fusion-based multi-dynamic target sensing (SL-MDTS) scheme is\nprovided, effectively fusing sensing information from multiple APs.

However,\nlarge-scale datasets, specially those constructed from crowd-sourcing and\nweb-scraping, often suffer from label noise, inconsistencies, and errors. This\nproblem is particularly pronounced in manufacturing domains, where obtaining\nhigh-quality labels is costly and time-consuming. This paper introduces\nVision-Language Sanitization and Refinement (VLSR), which is a\nvision-language-based framework for label sanitization and refinement in\nmulti-label manufacturing image datasets. This method embeds both images and\ntheir associated textual labels into a shared semantic space leveraging the\nCLIP vision-language model. Then two key tasks are addressed in this process by\ncomputing the cosine similarity between embeddings. First, label sanitization\nis performed to identify irrelevant, misspelled, or semantically weak labels,\nand surface the most semantically aligned label for each image by comparing\nimage-label pairs using cosine similarity between image and label embeddings.\nSecond, the method applies density-based clustering on text embeddings,\nfollowed by iterative cluster merging, to group semantically similar labels\ninto unified label groups. The Factorynet dataset, which includes noisy labels\nfrom both human annotations and web-scraped sources, is employed to evaluate\nthe effectiveness of the proposed framework.

By\nprojecting high dimensional key and value representations into a\nlower-dimensional subspace via random measurement matrices and reconstructing\nthe attention outputs using sparse recovery algorithms, CSAT significantly\nreduces attention complexity while maintaining semantic fidelity. Applied to\nvLLMs, CSAT exploits the inherent compressibility of both visual and textual\nrepresentations especially evident in video, where temporal redundancy is high,\nand in language, where cross-modal grounding is often sparse. In contrast to\nLLMs, which must often model entangled symbolic dependencies, vLLMs benefit\nfrom structured sparsity in alignment and scene composition, making them\nparticularly well-suited to compressed attention.

These results highlight ATF's ability to\nadaptively balance informativeness and minimalism across tasks. Our code\navailable at:\nhttps://github.com/torijune/ATF-Adaptive-Table-Filtering-Framework",

Yet their application to complex,\nreal-world scientific workflows remain limited by challenges in memory,\nplanning, and tool integration. Here, we introduce SciBORG (Scientific Bespoke\nArtificial Intelligence Agents Optimized for Research Goals), a modular agentic\nframework that allows LLM-based agents to autonomously plan, reason, and\nachieve robust and reliable domain-specific task execution. Agents are\nconstructed dynamically from source code documentation and augmented with\nfinite-state automata (FSA) memory, enabling persistent state tracking and\ncontext-aware decision-making. This approach eliminates the need for manual\nprompt engineering and allows for robust, scalable deployment across diverse\napplications via maintaining context across extended workflows and to recover\nfrom tool or execution failures. We validate SciBORG through integration with\nboth physical and virtual hardware, such as microwave synthesizers for\nexecuting user-specified reactions, with context-aware decision making and\ndemonstrate its use in autonomous multi-step bioassay retrieval from the\nPubChem database utilizing multi-step planning, reasoning, agent-to-agent\ncommunication and coordination for execution of exploratory tasks. Systematic\nbenchmarking shows that SciBORG agents achieve reliable execution, adaptive\nplanning, and interpretable state transitions.

The aim of TAMP is to restore a damaged target image\nby leveraging the complementary information from a reference image, where both\nimages captured the same scene but with a significant time gap in between,\ni.e., time-variant images. Different from conventional reference-guided image\ninpainting, the reference image under TAMP setup presents significant content\ndistinction to the target image and potentially also suffers from damages. Such\nan application frequently happens in our daily lives to restore a damaged image\nby referring to another reference image, where there is no guarantee of the\nreference image's source and quality. In particular, our study finds that even\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) reference-guided image inpainting methods fail to\nachieve plausible results due to the chaotic image complementation. To address\nsuch an ill-posed problem, we propose a novel Interactive Distribution\nTransition Estimation (InDiTE) module which interactively complements the\ntime-variant images with adaptive semantics thus facilitate the restoration of\ndamaged regions. To further boost the performance, we propose our TAMP\nsolution, namely Interactive Distribution Transition Estimation-driven\nDiffusion (InDiTE-Diff), which integrates InDiTE with SOTA diffusion model and\nconducts latent cross-reference during sampling. Moreover, considering the lack\nof benchmarks for TAMP task, we newly assembled a dataset, i.e., TAMP-Street,\nbased on existing image and mask datasets. We conduct experiments on the\nTAMP-Street datasets under two different time-variant image inpainting\nsettings, which show our method consistently outperform SOTA reference-guided\nimage inpainting methods for solving TAMP.",

    "abstract": "It has been shown that defining gravitational entanglement entropies relative\nto quantum reference frames (QRFs) intrinsically regularizes them. Here, we\ndemonstrate that such relational definitions also have an advantage in lattice\ngauge theories, where no ultraviolet divergences occur. To this end, we\nintroduce QRFs for the gauge group via Wilson lines on a lattice with global\nboundary, realizing edge modes on the bulk entangling surface. Overcoming\nchallenges of previous nonrelational approaches, we show that defining\ngauge-invariant subsystems associated with subregions relative to such QRFs\nnaturally leads to a factorization across the surface, yielding distillable\nrelational entanglement entropies. Distinguishing between extrinsic and\nintrinsic QRFs, according to whether they are built from the region or its\ncomplement, leads to extrinsic and intrinsic relational algebras ascribed to\nthe region. The \"electric center algebra\" of previous approaches is recovered\nas the algebra that all extrinsic QRFs agree on, or by incoherently twirling\nany extrinsic algebra over the electric corner symmetry group. Similarly, a\ngeneralization of previous proposals for a \"magnetic center algebra\" is\nobtained as the algebra that all intrinsic QRFs agree on, or, in the Abelian\ncase, by incoherently twirling any intrinsic algebra over a dual magnetic\ncorner group. Altogether, this leads to a compelling regional algebra and\nrelative entropy hierarchy. Invoking the corner twirls, we also find that the\nextrinsic/intrinsic relational entanglement entropies are upper bounded by the\nnon-distillable electric/magnetic center entropies. Finally, using extrinsic\nQRFs, we discuss the influence of \"asymptotic\" symmetries on regional\nentropies. Our work thus unifies and extends previous approaches and reveals\nthe interplay between entropies and regional symmetry structures.",

The obtained analytical expression of $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{s}}$ is\nused in the study of warm natural inflation (WNI). Although $n_{\\mathrm{s}}$\nand $r$ have been previously investigated, $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{s}}$ is omitted in\nprevious studies on WNI. Our study of $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{s}}$ completes previous\nphenomenological studies on WNI. In particular, the lower limit of the\nsymmetry-breaking scale in WNI becomes more concrete in this study.",

We\nmodel this challenge as a bi-objective optimization problem and propose a\ndecomposition-based solution that integrates chance-constrained programming\nwith network flow optimization. The framework separates the problem into two\ninterrelated subproblems: determining optimal node-level allocations across\ntime slots, and computing efficient inter-node resource transfers. We\ntheoretically prove the convergence of our method to the optimal solution that\nwould be obtained with full statistical knowledge of the adversary.

In addition to this energy bookkeeping, we also examine the quantum\nmechanical constraints on the Fo unit's rotation. We find that, as can be\nexpected, the energy spacing between quantized rotational states is several\norders of magnitude smaller than thermal energies at physiological temperature,\nand that the tunneling probability through rotational barriers practically\ntotally non-existent.

    "abstract": "Improving automated vehicle software requires driving data rich in valuable\nroad user interactions. In this paper, we propose a risk-based filtering\napproach that helps identify such valuable driving situations from large\ndatasets. Specifically, we use a probabilistic risk model to detect high-risk\nsituations. Our method stands out by considering a) first-order situations\n(where one vehicle directly influences another and induces risk) and b)\nsecond-order situations (where influence propagates through an intermediary\nvehicle). In experiments, we show that our approach effectively selects\nvaluable driving situations in the Waymo Open Motion Dataset. Compared to the\ntwo baseline interaction metrics of Kalman difficulty and Tracks-To-Predict\n(TTP), our filtering approach identifies complex and complementary situations,\nenriching the quality in automated vehicle testing. The risk data is made\nopen-source: https://github.com/HRI-EU/RiskBasedFiltering.",
