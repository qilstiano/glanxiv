In this work, we\npresent adversarial attacks designed specifically for MTPP models. A key\ncriterion for a good adversarial attack is its imperceptibility. For objects\nsuch as images or text, this is often achieved by bounding perturbation in some\nfixed $L_p$ norm-ball. However, similarly minimizing distance norms between two\nCTESs in the context of MTPPs is challenging due to their sequential nature and\nvarying time-scales and lengths. We address this challenge by first permuting\nthe events and then incorporating the additive noise to the arrival timestamps.\nHowever, the worst case optimization of such adversarial attacks is a hard\ncombinatorial problem, requiring exploration across a permutation space that is\nfactorially large in the length of the input sequence. As a result, we propose\na novel differentiable scheme PERMTPP using which we can perform adversarial\nattacks by learning to minimize the likelihood, while minimizing the distance\nbetween two CTESs. Our experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate the\noffensive and defensive capabilities, and lower inference times of PERMTPP.",

However, analyzing\nfootage from hundreds, if not thousands, of traffic cameras in a 24/7/365\nworking protocol remains an extremely challenging task, as current vision-based\napproaches primarily focus on extracting raw information, such as vehicle\ntrajectories or individual object detection, but require laborious\npost-processing to derive actionable insights.

This shift significantly enhances processing throughput by automating\ncomplex tasks like video classification and visual grounding, while improving\nadaptability by enabling seamless adjustments to diverse traffic scenarios and\nuser-defined queries. Our framework employs a severity-based aggregation\nstrategy to handle videos of various lengths and a novel multimodal prompt to\ngenerate structured responses for review and evaluation and enable fine-grained\nvisual grounding. We introduce IMS (Information Matching Score), a new\nMLLM-based metric for aligning structured responses with ground truth.

To overcome\nthis, we develop a total ordering relation for complex numbers, enabling\ncomparisons of the spectral components of general matrices with complex\neigenvalues. Building on this, we introduce the Spectral and Nilpotent Ordering\n(SNO), a partial order for arbitrary matrices of the same dimensions.

An additional result is the extension of the Schur--Ostrowski\ncriterion to the complex domain. Moreover, we characterize Jordan blocks of\nmatrix functions using a generalized dominance order for nilpotent components,\nfacilitating systematic analysis of non-diagonalizable matrices.

This instability, which rapidly increases the oscillation\namplitude of the trailing bunch, grows with higher power-transfer efficiency\nfrom the driver to the trailing bunch [V.

We test the relation using a grid of simulations across all\nparameters that affect the beam-breakup instability, assuming a uniform\naccelerating field (optimal beam loading) and no ion motion. We find that the\npreviously proposed efficiency$\\unicode{x2013}$instability relation represents\na lower limit on the strength of the instability for a given efficiency. For\neach normalized wake radius, only a certain accelerating field reaches this\nlowest value of the transverse instability; deviating from this point can\nincrease the growth rate by several orders of magnitude.

With the potential to address these demands, optically-active spin\ndefects in silicon are one proposed platform for building quantum technologies.\nHere, we electrically excite the silicon T centre in integrated optoelectronic\ndevices that combine nanophotonic waveguides and cavities with p-i-n diodes. We\nobserve single-photon electroluminescence from a cavity-coupled T centre with\n$g^{(2)}(0)=0.05(2)$. Further, we use the electrically-triggered emission to\nherald the electron spin state, initializing it with $92(8)\\%$ fidelity. This\nshows, for the first time, electrically-injected single-photon emission from a\nsilicon colour centre and a new method of electrically-triggered spin\ninitialization. These findings present a new telecommunications band light\nsource for silicon and a highly parallel control method for T centre quantum\nprocessors, advancing the T centre as a versatile defect for scalable quantum\ntechnologies.",

For example, in addition to analyzing spending behavior, we\ndevelop new metrics to quantify changes in consumers' online purchase frequency\nand the diversity of products purchased, to better reflect the growing ubiquity\nand dominance of online retail. Between 2018 and 2022 these consumer-level\nmetrics grew on average by more than 85%, peaking in 2021. We find a steady\nupward trend in individuals' online purchasing prior to COVID-19, with a\nsignificant increase in the first year of COVID, but without a lasting effect.\nPurchasing behaviors in 2022 were no greater than the result of the\npre-pandemic trend. We also find changes in purchasing significantly differ by\ndemographics, with different responses to the pandemic. We further use the\nconsumer-level data to show substitution effects between online and offline\nretail in sectors where Amazon heavily invested: books, shoes, and grocery.\nPrior to COVID we find year-to-year changes in the number of consumers making\nonline purchases for books and shoes negatively correlated with changes in\nemployment at local bookstores and shoe stores.

To get around this limitation, we\npropose to remove FoG using data-driven indicators of their abundance that are\nlocal in nature and thus avoid selection biases. In particular, we show that\nthe scale where the measured power spectrum quadrupole changes sign is tightly\nanti-correlated with both the satellite fraction and the velocity dispersion,\nand can thus be used to select galaxy samples with fewer FoG.

Thus, recent work has focused on developing techniques\nfor watermarking LLM-generated text, i.e., introducing an almost imperceptible\nsignal that allows a provider equipped with a secret key to determine if given\ntext was generated by their model. Current watermarking techniques are often\nnot practical due to concerns with generation latency, detection time,\ndegradation in text quality, or robustness. Many of these drawbacks come from\nthe focus on token-level watermarking, which ignores the inherent structure of\ntext. In this work, we introduce a new scheme, GaussMark, that is simple and\nefficient to implement, has formal statistical guarantees on its efficacy,\ncomes at no cost in generation latency, and embeds the watermark into the\nweights of the model itself, providing a structural watermark. Our approach is\nbased on Gaussian independence testing and is motivated by recent empirical\nobservations that minor additive corruptions to LLM weights can result in\nmodels of identical (or even improved) quality. We show that by adding a small\namount of Gaussian noise to the weights of a given LLM, we can watermark the\nmodel in a way that is statistically detectable by a provider who retains the\nsecret key. We provide formal statistical bounds on the validity and power of\nour procedure. Through an extensive suite of experiments, we demonstrate that\nGaussMark is reliable, efficient, and relatively robust to corruptions such as\ninsertions, deletions, substitutions, and roundtrip translations and can be\ninstantiated with essentially no loss in model quality.",

To\nconstruct this distribution, we use the Betti analogue of the Euler system\nmachinery, developed by Loeffler-Williams, as well as techniques analogous to\nthose used by Loeffler-Zerbes for interpolating the twists of Beilinson-Flach\nelements arising in the Euler system associated with Rankin-Selberg\nconvolutions of elliptic modular forms.

These distinct\nproperties are thought to originate from the presence of an anion-dominated\nionic network and interpenetrating water channels for cation transport, which\nindicates that associations in WiSEs are crucial to understanding their\nproperties. Currently, associations have mainly been investigated in the bulk,\nwhile little attention has been given to the electrolyte structure near\nelectrified interfaces. Here, we develop a theory for the electrical double\nlayer (EDL) of WiSEs, where we consistently account for the thermoreversible\nassociations of species into Cayley tree aggregates. The theory predicts an\nasymmetric structure of the EDL. At negative voltages, hydrated Li$^+$ dominate\nand cluster aggregation is initially slightly enhanced before disintegration at\nlarger voltages. At positive voltages when compared to the bulk, clusters are\nstrictly diminished. Performing atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations\nof the EDL of WiSE provides EDL data for validation and bulk data for\nparameterization of our theory. Validating the predictions of our theory\nagainst MD showed good qualitative agreement. Furthermore, we performed\nelectrochemical impendence measurements to determine the differential\ncapacitance of the studied LiTFSI WiSE and also found reasonable agreement with\nour theory. Overall, the developed approach can be used to investigate ionic\naggregation and solvation effects in the EDL, which amongst other properties,\ncan be used to understand the pre-cursers for solid-electrolyte interphase\nformation.",

The\nlack of inversion symmetry in monolayers of transition metal dichalcogenides\n(TMD), such as MoS$_2$ and WS$_2$, is particularly attractive for enabling\nnonlinear phenomena based on $\\chi^{(2)}$ in silicon photonic devices\nincorporated with these materials. Previous studies have demonstrated\nsecond-order nonlinearities in on-chip silicon-based devices integrated with\ntransition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). However, they have largely overlooked\nthe nonlinear modal interaction that considers both the tensorial nature of the\nTMD's second-order susceptibility and the full vectorial nature of the\nelectromagnetic fields. In this work, we investigate second-harmonic generation\n(SHG) in silicon nitride (SiN) waveguides integrated with a monolayer of\nMoS$_2$. We experimentally observed an enhancement in second-harmonic\ngeneration (SHG) in MoS$_2$-loaded waveguides compared to those without the\nmonolayer. Notably, this enhancement occurred even when the primary electric\nfield component of the pump and/or signal mode was orthogonal to the TMD plane,\nhighlighting co- and cross-polarized SHG interactions. This phenomenon cannot\nbe predicted by the traditionally used scalar models.In addition, we provide\nimportant guidelines for the design of MoS$_2$-loaded waveguides, taking into\naccount phase-matching, interaction length and the MoS$_2$ crystal orientation\nwith respect to the waveguide axis.",

We restrict our study to vehicles that interact with their\nenvironment through thrust, weight and drag forces, such as rotorcraft or\nsubmersibles. For such vehicles, theory predicts an optimum ratio between\nvehicle velocity and a characteristic velocity of the turbulence. The energy\nrequired for transit can be substantially smaller than what is required to move\nthrough quiescent fluid. We describe a simple picture for how a flight\ntrajectory could preferentially put vehicles in tailwinds rather than\nheadwinds, predicated on the organization of turbulence around vortices. This\nleads to an analytical parameter-free lower bound on the energy required to\ntraverse a turbulent flow. We test this bound by computationally optimizing\ntrajectories in Kraichnan's model of turbulence, and find that the energy\nrequired by point-models of vehicles is slightly larger than but close to our\nbound. Finally, we predict the existence of an optimum level of turbulence for\nwhich power is minimized, so that turbulence can be both too strong or too weak\nto be useful. This work strengthens previous findings that environmental\nturbulence can always reduce energy use.

In addition, sulfur is an earth-abundant, inexpensive material\nobtainable from multiple resources; thus, Li-S batteries are envisioned to\nprovide environmentally sustainable solutions to the growing demand for energy\nstorage. A crit-ical roadblock to the realization of commercial Li-S batteries\nis the formation of polysulfides and their secondary reactions with liquid\norganic electrolytes, resulting in low coulombic efficiency for charging and\nfast self-discharge rates. The realization of solid-state electrolytes for Li-S\nbat-teries provides potential pathways to address the safety concerns of liquid\nelectrolytes and inhib-it the formation of polysulfides and/or prevent their\ndiffusion into the anode electrode. However, current solid-state electrolytes\nare limited by low ionic conductivity, inadequate electrode inter-facial\ncompatibility, and restricted electrochemical windows. This review discusses\nthe status of polymer-based electrolytes for Li-S batteries, and outlines\ncurrent methods for their fabrication, their transport characteristics and\nongoing research aimed at overcoming material properties hindering the\ndevelopment of all-solid-state Li-S batteries.",

    "abstract": "In $d=4k+2$ dimensions, $p$-form gauge fields (with $p=2k$) with self-dual\nfield strengths couple naturally to dyonic branes with equal electric and\nmagnetic charges. Sen's action for a $p$-form gauge field with self-dual field\nstrength coupled to a spacetime metric $g$ involves an explicit Minkowski\nmetric; however, this action can be generalised to provide a theory in which\nthe Minkowski metric is replaced by a second metric $\\bar g$ on spacetime. This\ntheory describes a physical sector, consisting of the chiral $p$-form gauge\nfield coupled to the dynamical metric $g$, plus an auxiliary sector consisting\nof a second chiral $p$-form and the second metric $\\bar g$. The fields in this\nauxiliary sector only couple to each other and have no interactions with the\nphysical sector. However, in this theory, the standard coupling to a brane\ngiven by integrating the gauge potential over the world-volume of the brane is\nproblematic as the physical gauge potential depends non-locally on the fields\nappearing in the action. A consistent coupling is given by introducing Dirac\nbranes (generalising Dirac strings), and is shown to have generalised\nsymmetries corresponding to invariance under deforming the positions of the\nDirac branes, provided the Dirac branes do not intersect any physical brane\nworld-volumes.",

These\nparameters can be applied to column density maps of atomic hydrogen (HI). The\nHI distribution is susceptible to perturbations by environmental effects, e.g.\ninter-galactic medium pressure and tidal interactions. Therefore, HI morphology\ncan potentially identify galaxies undergoing ram-pressure stripping or tidal\ninteractions. We explore three fields in the WALLABY Pilot HI survey and\nidentify perturbed galaxies based on a k-nearest Neighbor (kNN) algorithm using\nan HI morphometric feature space. For training, we used labeled galaxies in the\ncombined NGC 4808 and NGC 4636 fields with six HI morphometrics to train and\ntest a kNN classifier. The kNN classification is proficient in classifying\nperturbed galaxies with all metrics -- accuracy, precision and recall -- at\n70-80%. By using the kNN method to identify perturbed galaxies in the\ndeployment field, the NGC 5044 mosaic, we find that in most regards, the\nscaling relations of perturbed and unperturbed galaxies have similar\ndistribution in the scaling relations of stellar mass vs star formation rate\nand the Baryonic Tully-Fisher relation, but the HI and stellar mass relation\nflatter than of the unperturbed galaxies. Our results for NGC 5044 provide a\nprediction for future studies on the fraction of galaxies undergoing\ninteraction in this catalogue and to build a training sample to classify such\ngalaxies in the full WALLABY survey.",

This is challenging and potentially\nsub-optimal, as every object in a dynamic scene has their own pattern of\nmovement, typically somewhat independent of others. In this paper, we\ninvestigate the benefit of explicitly modeling the objects in a dynamic scene\nseparately within the context of latent-transformer video prediction models.

    "abstract": "Understanding quantum phases of matter is a fundamental goal in physics. For\npure states, the representatives of phases are the ground states of locally\ninteracting Hamiltonians, which are also renormalization fixed points (RFPs).\nThese RFP states are exactly described by tensor networks. Extending this\nframework to mixed states, matrix product density operators (MPDOs) which are\nRFPs are believed to encapsulate mixed-state phases of matter in one dimension.\nHowever, it remains an open question whether, by analogy, such MPDO RFPs can be\nrealized as steady states of local Lindbladians. In this work, we resolve this\nquestion by analytically constructing parent Lindbladians for MPDO RFPs. These\nLindbladians are local, frustration-free, and exhibit minimal steady-state\ndegeneracy. Interestingly, we find that parent Lindbladians possess a rich\nstructure, including non-commutativity for certain classes of RFPs,\ndistinguishing them from their Hamiltonian counterparts.",

    "abstract": "Software bugs pose a significant challenge during development and\nmaintenance, and practitioners spend nearly 50% of their time dealing with\nbugs. Many existing techniques adopt Information Retrieval (IR) to localize a\nreported bug using textual and semantic relevance between bug reports and\nsource code. However, they often struggle to bridge a critical gap between bug\nreports and code that requires in-depth contextual understanding, which goes\nbeyond textual or semantic relevance. In this paper, we present a novel\ntechnique for bug localization - BRaIn - that addresses the contextual gaps by\nassessing the relevance between bug reports and code with Large Language Models\n(LLM). It then leverages the LLM's feedback (a.k.a., Intelligent Relevance\nFeedback) to reformulate queries and re-rank source documents, improving bug\nlocalization. We evaluate BRaIn using a benchmark dataset, Bench4BL, and three\nperformance metrics and compare it against six baseline techniques from the\nliterature. Our experimental results show that BRaIn outperforms baselines by\n87.6%, 89.5%, and 48.8% margins in MAP, MRR, and HIT@K, respectively.\nAdditionally, it can localize approximately 52% of bugs that cannot be\nlocalized by the baseline techniques due to the poor quality of corresponding\nbug reports.

The\ngalaxies show moderate reddening ($A_V~=~0.1-0.6$ mag) and the $A_V$ to stellar\nmass relation is consistent with local sources.

    "abstract": "We present a comparison of observed polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH)\nfeature ratios in 19 nearby galaxies with a grid of theoretical expectations\nfor near- and mid-infrared dust emission. The PAH feature ratios are drawn from\nCycle 1 JWST observations and are measured for 7224 stellar clusters and 29176\nstellar associations for which we have robust ages and mass estimates from HST\nfive-band photometry. Though there are galaxy-to-galaxy variations, the\nobserved PAH feature ratios largely agree with the theoretical models,\nparticularly those that are skewed toward more ionized and larger PAH size\ndistributions. For each galaxy we also extract PAH feature ratios for 200\npc-wide circular regions in the diffuse interstellar medium, which serve as a\nnon-cluster/association control sample. Compared to what we find for stellar\nclusters and associations, the 3.3um/7.7um and 3.3um/11.3um ratios from the\ndiffuse interstellar medium are $\\sim 0.10-0.15$ dex smaller. When the observed\nPAH feature ratios are compared to the radiation field hardness as probed by\nthe [OIII]/H$\\beta$ ratio, we find anti-correlations for nearly all galaxies in\nthe sample. These results together suggest that the PAH feature ratios are\ndriven by the shape intensity of the radiation field, and that the smallest\nPAHs -- observed via JWST F335M imaging -- are increasingly 'processed' or\ndestroyed in regions with the most intense and hard radiation fields.",

One of these phenomena, that has spurred intense\ntheoretical research, is ``benign overfitting'': deep neural networks seem to\ngeneralize well in the over-parametrized regime even though the networks show a\nperfect fit to noisy training data. It is now known that benign overfitting\nalso occurs in various classical statistical models. For linear maximum margin\nclassifiers, benign overfitting has been established theoretically in a class\nof mixture models with very strong assumptions on the covariate distribution.\nHowever, even in this simple setting, many questions remain open. For instance,\nmost of the existing literature focuses on the noiseless case where all true\nclass labels are observed without errors, whereas the more interesting noisy\ncase remains poorly understood. We provide a comprehensive study of benign\noverfitting for linear maximum margin classifiers. We discover a phase\ntransition in test error bounds for the noisy model which was previously\nunknown and provide some geometric intuition behind it. We further considerably\nrelax the required covariate assumptions in both, the noisy and noiseless case.\nOur results demonstrate that benign overfitting of maximum margin classifiers\nholds in a much wider range of scenarios than was previously known and provide\nnew insights into the underlying mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a promising technique that has shown\ngreat potential in addressing some of the limitations of large language models\n(LLMs). LLMs have two major limitations: they can contain outdated information\ndue to their training data, and they can generate factually inaccurate\nresponses, a phenomenon known as hallucinations. RAG aims to mitigate these\nissues by leveraging a database of relevant documents, which are stored as\nembedding vectors in a high-dimensional space. However, one of the challenges\nof using high-dimensional embeddings is that they require a significant amount\nof memory to store. This can be a major issue, especially when dealing with\nlarge databases of documents. To alleviate this problem, we propose the use of\n4-bit quantization to store the embedding vectors. This involves reducing the\nprecision of the vectors from 32-bit floating-point numbers to 4-bit integers,\nwhich can significantly reduce the memory requirements. Our approach has\nseveral benefits. Firstly, it significantly reduces the memory storage\nrequirements of the high-dimensional vector database, making it more feasible\nto deploy RAG systems in resource-constrained environments. Secondly, it speeds\nup the searching process, as the reduced precision of the vectors allows for\nfaster computation.

We prove a generalization of this theorem that\naccounts for the presence of a finite group action on $\\#^n(S^1\\times S^2)$.\nOur proof is independent of the classical theorem, so by considering the\ntrivial group action, we give a new proof of the classical theorem.\n  Specifically, we show that any finite group action on $\\#^n(S^1\\times S^2)$\nextends to a $\\textit{linearly parted}$ action on $\\natural^n(S^1\\times B^3)$\nand that any two such extensions are equivariantly diffeomorphic. Roughly, a\nlinearly parted action respects a decomposition into equivariant $0$-handles\nand $1$-handles, where, for each handle in the decomposition, its stabilizer\nacts linearly on that handle. The restriction to linearly parted actions is\nimportant, because there are infinitely many distinct nonlinear actions on\n$B^4$ with identical actions on $\\partial B^4$; these nonlinear actions give\nextensions of the same action on $\\partial B^4$ which are $\\textit{not}$\nequivariantly diffeomorphic.\n  We also prove a more general theorem: Every finite group action on\n$\\left(\\#^n(S^1\\times S^2),L\\right)$, with $L$ an invariant unlink, extends\nacross a pair $\\left(\\natural^n(S^1\\times B^3),\\mathcal{D}\\right)$, with\n$\\mathcal{D}$ an equivariantly boundary-parallel disk-tangle, and any two such\nextensions are equivariantly diffeomorphic.",

    "abstract": "In many service systems, especially those in healthcare, customer waiting\ntimes can result in increased service requirements. Such service slowdowns can\nsignificantly impact system performance. Therefore, it is important to properly\naccount for their impact when designing scheduling policies. Scheduling under\nwait-dependent service times is challenging, especially when multiple customer\nclasses are heterogeneously affected by waiting. In this work, we study\nscheduling policies in multiclass, multiserver queues with wait-dependent\nservice slowdowns. We propose a simulation-based Approximate Dynamic\nProgramming (ADP) algorithm to find close-to-optimal scheduling policies. The\nADP algorithm (i) represents the policy using classifiers based on the index\npolicy structure, (ii) leverages a coupling method to estimate the differences\nof the relative value functions directly, and (iii) uses adaptive sampling for\nefficient state-space exploration. Through extensive numerical experiments, we\nillustrate that the ADP algorithm generates close-to-optimal policies that\noutperform well-known benchmarks. We also provide insights into the structure\nof the optimal policy, which reveals an important trade-off between\ninstantaneous cost reduction and preventing the system from reaching high-cost\nequilibria. Lastly, we conduct a case study on scheduling admissions into\nrehabilitation care to illustrate the effectiveness of the ADP algorithm in\npractice.",

For the well-studied QED case,\nwe show explicitly how the off-forward AVV pole exactly cancels an identical\nPVV pole. We then demonstrate the dramatic difference in QCD due to the chiral\ncondensate, which qualitatively modifies anomalous Ward identities. As in the\nmassless case, the anomaly pole in QCD is canceled by the dynamics of a\nprimordial isosinglet pseudoscalar $\\bar \\eta$-meson, whose Wess-Zumino-Witten\ncoupling to the topological charge density shifts the pole to the physical\n$\\eta^\\prime$ mass, with the finite quark mass contribution differing by\n$O(10\\%)$ from the Witten-Veneziano formula. We obtain a compact analytic\nexpression for the finite mass corrections to Shore and Veneziano's result that\nthe proton's net quark helicity $\\Delta \\Sigma\\propto \\sqrt{\\chi_{\\rm QCD}'\n|_{m=0}(0)}$, the forward slope of the topological susceptibility in the chiral\nlimit, and show they are of the order of a few percent.

To address these challenges, this paper\npresents a neural network-based approach for real-time bus departure time\nprediction tailored for smart IoT public transit applications. We leverage\nAI-driven models to enhance the accuracy of bus schedules by preprocessing\ndata, engineering relevant features, and implementing a fully connected neural\nnetwork that utilizes historical departure data to predict departure times at\nsubsequent stops. In our case study analyzing bus data from Boston, we observed\nan average deviation of nearly 4 minutes from scheduled times. However, our\nmodel, evaluated across 151 bus routes, demonstrates a significant improvement,\npredicting departure time deviations with an accuracy of under 80 seconds. This\nadvancement not only improves the reliability of bus transit schedules but also\nplays a crucial role in enabling smart bus systems and IoT applications within\npublic transit networks.

    "abstract": "This article presents a study on the influence of antenna parameters in\nmedical microwave radiometers on brightness temperature. A series of\ncomputational experiments was conducted to analyse the dependence of brightness\ntemperature on antenna characteristics. Various antenna parameters and their\neffect on the distribution of electromagnetic fields in biological tissues were\nexamined. It was demonstrated that considering the antenna mismatch parameter\nis crucial when modelling the brightness temperature of biological tissues,\ncontributing about 2 percent to its formation. The depth range of brightness\ntemperature measurement was determined. The dependence of brightness\ntemperature on the antenna diameter and frequency was established. The findings\nof this study can be applied to improve medical microwave radiometers and\nenhance their efficiency in the early diagnosis of various diseases.",

    "abstract": "The Worthington jets from bursting bubbles at a gas-liquid interface can\nbreak up into small droplets, aerosolizing chemical and biological substances\ninto the atmosphere and impacting both global climate and public health.\nDespite their importance in contaminant transport, the influence of adsorbed\ncontaminants on bubble-bursting jet dynamics remains poorly understood. Here,\nwe document how an immiscible compound contaminant layer impacts the jet\nradius, which deviates from the expected jetting dynamics produced by clean\nbubble bursting. We rationalize the deviation of the jet radius by\ncharacterizing the propagation of the capillary waves at the air-oil-water\ninterface. We develop a linearized wave damping model based on the\nunderstanding of the oil thickness profile and the wave dispersion, and we\npropose a revised Ohnesorge number with a scaling relation that captures the\nexperimental results reasonably well across a wide range of oil layer\nthicknesses and viscosities. Our work not only advances the fundamental\nunderstanding of bubble bursting jets but also offers valuable insights for\npredicting aerosol size distributions and modeling the transport of airborne\ncontaminants in realistic environmental scenarios.",

    "abstract": "If supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) are driven together by gas disks\nin galactic nuclei, then a surrounding nuclear star cluster or in-situ\nstar-formation should deliver stars to the disk plane. Migration through the\ncircumbinary disk will quickly bring stars to the edge of a low-density cavity\ncleared by the binary, where the stellar orbit becomes trapped and locked with\nthe binary decay. Here we explore the scenario where the trapped stellar orbit\ndecays with the binary until the binary tidally strips the star in a runaway\nprocess. For Sun-like stars, this occurs preferentially for $10^4-10^6\nM_{\\odot}$ SMBHBs, as the SMBHB enters the LISA band. We estimate that the\nrunaway stripping process will generate Eddington-level X-ray flares repeating\non hours-to-days timescales and lasting for decades. The flaring timescales and\nenergetics of these circumbinary disk tidal disruption events (CBD-TDEs) match\nwell with the recently discovered Quasi-Periodic Eruptions. However, the\ninferred rates of the two phenomena are in tension, unless low-mass SMBHB\nmergers are more common than expected. For less-dense stars, stripping begins\nearlier in the SMBHB inspiral, has longer repetition times, lasts longer, is\ndimmer, and can occur for more massive SMBHBs. Wether CBD-TDEs are a known or a\nyet-undiscovered class of repeating nuclear transients, they could provide a\nnew probe of the elusive SMBH mergers in low mass / dwarf galaxies, which lie\nin the sweet-spot of the LISA sensitivity.",

Combining these\nmeasurements, we investigate the dust-to-gas (DtG), dust-to-metal (DtM), and\ndust-to-stellar mass (DtS) ratios of our sample as a function of metallicity.\nWhile our analysis is limited by systematic uncertainties related to the\n[CII]-to-H$_2$ conversion factor and dust temperature, we explore a wide range\nof possible values, and carefully assess their impact on our results. Under a\nfiducial set of assumptions, we find an average $\\log(\\mathrm{DtG}) = -3.02 \\pm\n0.23$, only slightly below that of local metal-rich galaxies. On the other\nhand, at fixed metallicity our average $\\log(\\mathrm{DtS}) = -2.15 \\pm 0.42$ is\nsignificantly larger than that of low-redshift galaxies. Finally, through a\ncomparison to various theoretical models of high-redshift dust production, we\nfind that assembling the dust reservoirs in massive galaxies at $z\\approx7$\nlikely requires the combination of rapid supernova enrichment and efficient ISM\ndust growth.",

We present a comprehensive analysis of 35 GRBs\nobserved by \\textit{Fermi}/GBM and \\textit{Fermi}/LAT over the past 15 years,\nfocusing on the nature of high-energy (HE, E$>$100 MeV) emission during the\nprompt emission phase. Our study combines temporal and spectral analyses to\ninvestigate the synchrotron origin of the observed emission spanning the energy\nrange from 10 keV to 100 GeV and explore the possible contribution of\nadditional spectral components. Temporal modeling of \\textit{Fermi}/LAT light\ncurves for 12 GRBs in our sample reveals deviations from standard afterglow\nscenarios during the early phases, suggesting a significant contamination from\nprompt emission. We find that most GRB spectra align with synchrotron emission\nextending to GeV energies, with the slope $p$ of the non-thermal electron\ndistribution clustering around $p\\sim2.7$, consistently with theoretical\npredictions. For three GRBs, an additional power law component is required to\nexplain the high-energy emission, but the nature and temporal evolution of this\ncomponent remain unclear due to the limited quality of \\textit{Fermi}/LAT data.\nWhen the power law component is needed, the synchrotron spectrum shows a sharp\nMeV suppression. It could be explained by the pair loading effects in the early\nafterglow. These findings emphasize the importance of multi-wavelength\nobservations in unveiling the mechanisms driving early HE prompt emission in\nGRBs. We briefly discuss the implications of our findings for future\nvery-high-energy (VHE, E$>$100 GeV) gamma-ray observatories, such as the\nCherenkov Telescope Array, and address the detection prospects of additional\nnon-thermal components in GRB spectra.",

Given their high luminosities (L>~10^4Lsun), red\nsupergiants (RSGs) are good tracers of the chemical abundances of the young\nstellar population in the Milky Way and nearby galaxies. However, previous\nabundance analyses tailored to RSGs suffer some systematic uncertainties\noriginating in, most notably, the synthesized molecular spectral lines for\nRSGs. Aims. We establish a new abundance analysis procedure for RSGs that\ncircumvents difficulties faced in previous works, and test the procedure with\nten nearby RSGs observed with the near-infrared high-resolution spectrograph\nWINERED (0.97--1.32 micron, R=28,000). Results. We determined the [X/Fe] of ten\nelements (Na I, Mg I, Al I, Si I, K I, Ca I, Ti I, Cr I, Ni I, and Y II). We\nestimated the relative precision in the derived abundances to be 0.04--0.12 dex\nfor elements with more than two lines analyzed (e.g., Fe I and Mg I) and up to\n0.18 dex for the other elements (e.g., Y II). We compared the resultant\nabundances of RSGs with the well-established abundances of another type of\nyoung star, namely the Cepheids, in order to evaluate the potential systematic\nbias in our abundance measurements, assuming that the young stars (i.e., both\nRSGs and Cepheids) in the solar neighborhood have common chemical abundances.\nWe find that the determined RSG abundances are highly consistent with those of\nCepheids within <~0.1 dex for some elements (notably [Fe/H] and [Mg/Fe]), which\nmeans the bias in the abundance determination for these elements is likely to\nbe small. In contrast, the consistency is worse for some other elements (e.g.,\n[Si/Fe] and [Y/Fe]). Nevertheless, the dispersion of the chemical abundances\namong our target RSGs is comparable with the individual statistical errors on\nthe abundances. Hence, the procedure is likely to be useful to evaluate the\nrelative difference in chemical abundances among RSGs.",

However,\ntheir capacity for face understanding has not been systematically studied. To\naddress this gap, we introduce FaceXBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed\nto evaluate MLLMs on complex face understanding tasks. FaceXBench includes\n5,000 multimodal multiple-choice questions derived from 25 public datasets and\na newly created dataset, FaceXAPI. These questions cover 14 tasks across 6\nbroad categories, assessing MLLMs' face understanding abilities in bias and\nfairness, face authentication, recognition, analysis, localization and tool\nretrieval. Using FaceXBench, we conduct an extensive evaluation of 26\nopen-source MLLMs alongside 2 proprietary models, revealing the unique\nchallenges in complex face understanding tasks. We analyze the models across\nthree evaluation settings: zero-shot, in-context task description, and\nchain-of-thought prompting. Our detailed analysis reveals that current MLLMs,\nincluding advanced models like GPT-4o, and GeminiPro 1.5, show significant room\nfor improvement. We believe FaceXBench will be a crucial resource for\ndeveloping MLLMs equipped to perform sophisticated face understanding. Code:\nhttps://github.com/Kartik-3004/facexbench",

In this paper, we focus on solving the elliptic equation\n$-\\nabla \\cdot (a \\nabla u) = f$ in a two-dimensional curved domain $\\Omega$,\nwhere the diffusion coefficient $a$ is variable and smooth. We propose a\nsixth-order $9$-point compact FDM on uniform Cartesian grids within the domain,\nnot relying on ghost points or information outside $\\overline{\\Omega}$.

We rigorously\nestablish the sixth-order convergence of the numerically approximated solution\n$u_h$ in the $\\infty$-norm. Additionally, we derive a gradient approximation\n$\\nabla u$ directly from $u_h$ without solving auxiliary equations. This\ngradient approximation achieves proven accuracy of order $5 + \\frac{1}{q}$ in\nthe $q$-norm for all $1 \\leq q \\leq \\infty$ (with a logarithmic factor $\\log h$\nfor $1 \\leq q < 2$).

As part of the procedure of\nBruno and Laurence, it is required to solve the Hamilton-Jacobi equation for a\nmagnetic potential on the outside of an interface given the field on the inside\nand the pressure-jump across the interface. For non-axisymmetric interface, it\nwas understood that solutions with insufficiently irrational rotational\ntransform might not exist, and examples have been given for which there are no\nsolutions at all for large enough pressure-jump. The present paper gives a\nmethod to compute regions in the phase space for the pressure-jump Hamiltonian\nthrough which no invariant tori pass. The paper also shows how to present the\nresults as regions in the space of pressure-jumps and outer rotational\ntransform for which there is no solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation. The\nmethod is expected to reach arbitrarily close to the full non-existence region\nwith enough computational work, so what is left over can be relied on to be\nmostly invariant tori. The paper also brings to attention a class of metrics on\ntori that are not necessarily axisymmetric yet have integrable geodesic flow.\nThey could give interfaces with solutions for all but finitely many rotational\ntransforms.",

It is thought to be composed of an equatorial dusty disk and a\npolar dusty wind launched by radiation pressure. However, this picture is based\non studies of moderately accreting AGN. Models suggest that the disk/wind\nstructure will change with specific accretion rate. Here we examine the wind\nlaunching region in two high accretion rate objects, I Zw 1 (super-Eddington)\nand H0557-385 (high-Eddington), using high spatial resolution interferometric\nobservations in the $K$-band from VLTI/GRAVITY and $LM$-bands VLTI/MATISSE. We\nrecover wavelength-dependent sizes of the dust emission using a Gaussian and\npower law fit to the visibilities. Both objects are partially resolved and have\nradial sizes in the $KLM$-bands between 0.3 - 1.5 mas, with no signs of\nelongation. Combining our measurements with VLTI/MIDI $N$-band data gives a\nfull multi-wavelength picture of the dust structure. We find that in H0557-385,\nthe dust sizes between $3.5-8\\:\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ are independent of the\nwavelength, roughly constant at $3-10$ sublimation radii. We argue that this\nindicates a direct view of the wind launching region and, together with an\nabsence of polar elongation, this implies that any wind would be launched in a\npreferentially equatorial direction or blown out by strong radiation pressure.\nThe size-wavelength relation for both objects shows a preferentially disky\nequatorial dust distribution. We conclude that there is strong evidence that\nthe Eddington ratio shapes the inner dust structure, most notably the\nwind-launching region and wind direction.",

Despite advances in radiation-hydrodynamic simulations, a\nconsistent \"drive deficit\" remains. Experimentally measured ICF capsule\nbang-times are systematically 400-700 ps later than simulations predict. The\nBuild-A-Hohlraum (BAH) campaign explored potential causes for this discrepancy\nby systematically varying hohlraum features, including laser entrance hole\n(LEH) windows, capsules, and gas fills. Overall, the agreement between\nsimulated and experimental x-ray drive was found to be largely unaffected by\nthese changes. The data allows us to exclude some hypotheses put forward to\npotentially explain the discrepancy. Errors in the local thermodynamic\nequilibrium (LTE) atomic modeling, errors in the modeling of LEH closure and\nerrors due to a lack of plasma species mix physics in simulations are shown to\nbe inconsistent with our measurements. Instead, the data supports the\nhypothesis that errors in NLTE emission modeling are a significant contributor\nto the discrepancy. X-ray emission in the 2 - 4 keV range is found to be\napproximately 30% lower than in simulations. This is accompanied by higher than\npredicted electron temperatures in the gold bubble region, pointing to errors\nin non-LTE modeling. Introducing an opacity multiplier of 0.87 on energy groups\nabove 1.8 keV improves agreement with experimental data, reducing the bang-time\ndiscrepancy from 300 ps to 100 ps.

ColNet divides models into the backbone and task-specific layers,\nforming groups of similar clients, with group leaders performing\nconflict-averse cross-group aggregation. A pool of experiments with different\nfederations demonstrated ColNet outperforms the compared aggregation schemes in\ndecentralized settings with label and task heterogeneity scenarios.",

    "abstract": "The mass accretion rates of young stellar objects (YSOs) are key to\nunderstanding how stars form, how their circumstellar disks evolve, and even\nhow planets form. We develop a Bayesian framework to determine the accretion\nrates of a sample of 15 YSOs using archival data from the VIRUS spectrograph\n($R \\sim 800$, 3500-5500\\r{A}) on the Hobby-Eberly Telescope. We are publicly\nreleasing our developed tool, dubbed nuts-for-ysos, as a Python package which\ncan also be applied to other spectroscopic datasets. The nuts-for-ysos code\nfits a simple accretion model to the near-UV and optical continuum of each\nVIRUS spectrum. Our Bayesian approach aims to identify correlations between\nmodel parameters using the No U-Turn Sampler (NUTS). Moreover, this approach\nself-consistently incorporates all parameter uncertainties, allowing for a\nthorough estimation of the probability distribution for accretion rate not\naccomplished in previous works. Using nuts-for-ysos, we derive accretion rates\nof each YSO. We then verify the reliability of our method by comparing to\nresults separately derived from only the spectral emission lines, and to\nresults from earlier studies of the Lupus, Chamaeleon I, and NGC1333 regions.\nFinally, we discuss what qualitative trends, covariances, and degeneracies were\nfound among model parameters. The technique developed in this paper is a useful\nimprovement that can be applied in the future to larger samples of YSOs\nobserved by VIRUS or other spectrographs.",

However,\nachieving real-time decision-making in Digital Twins considering uncertainty\nnecessitates an efficient uncertainty quantification (UQ) approach and\noptimization driven by accurate predictions of system behaviors, which remains\na challenge for learning-based methods. This paper presents a simultaneous\nmulti-step robust model predictive control (MPC) framework that incorporates\nreal-time decision-making with uncertainty awareness for Digital Twin systems.\nLeveraging a multistep ahead predictor named Time-Series Dense Encoder (TiDE)\nas the surrogate model, this framework differs from conventional MPC models\nthat provide only one-step ahead predictions. In contrast, TiDE can predict\nfuture states within the prediction horizon in a one-shot, significantly\naccelerating MPC. Furthermore, quantile regression is employed with the\ntraining of TiDE to perform flexible while computationally efficient UQ on data\nuncertainty. Consequently, with the deep learning quantiles, the robust MPC\nproblem is formulated into a deterministic optimization problem and provides a\nsafety buffer that accommodates disturbances to enhance constraint satisfaction\nrate. As a result, the proposed method outperforms existing robust MPC methods\nby providing less-conservative UQ and has demonstrated efficacy in an\nengineering case study involving Directed Energy Deposition (DED) additive\nmanufacturing.

    "abstract": "The standard language modeling (LM) loss by itself has been shown to be\ninadequate for effective dialogue modeling. As a result, various training\napproaches, such as auxiliary loss functions and leveraging human feedback, are\nbeing adopted to enrich open-domain dialogue systems. One such auxiliary loss\nfunction is Bag-of-Words (BoW) loss, defined as the cross-entropy loss for\npredicting all the words/tokens of the next utterance. In this work, we propose\na novel auxiliary loss named Bag-of-Keywords (BoK) loss to capture the central\nthought of the response through keyword prediction and leverage it to enhance\nthe generation of meaningful and interpretable responses in open-domain\ndialogue systems. BoK loss upgrades the BoW loss by predicting only the\nkeywords or critical words/tokens of the next utterance, intending to estimate\nthe core idea rather than the entire response. We incorporate BoK loss in both\nencoder-decoder (T5) and decoder-only (DialoGPT) architecture and train the\nmodels to minimize the weighted sum of BoK and LM (BoK-LM) loss. We perform our\nexperiments on two popular open-domain dialogue datasets, DailyDialog and\nPersona-Chat. We show that the inclusion of BoK loss improves the dialogue\ngeneration of backbone models while also enabling post-hoc interpretability. We\nalso study the effectiveness of BoK-LM loss as a reference-free metric and\nobserve comparable performance to the state-of-the-art metrics on various\ndialogue evaluation datasets.",

The application of DM\nin stereo image restoration is confronted with a series of challenges. The need\nto reconstruct two images exacerbates DM's computational cost. Additionally,\nexisting latent DMs usually focus on semantic information and remove\nhigh-frequency details as redundancy during latent compression, which is\nprecisely what matters for image restoration. To address the above problems, we\npropose a high-frequency aware diffusion model, DiffStereo for stereo image\nrestoration as the first attempt at DM in this domain. Specifically, DiffStereo\nfirst learns latent high-frequency representations (LHFR) of HQ images. DM is\nthen trained in the learned space to estimate LHFR for stereo images, which are\nfused into a transformer-based stereo image restoration network providing\nbeneficial high-frequency information of corresponding HQ images. The\nresolution of LHFR is kept the same as input images, which preserves the\ninherent texture from distortion. And the compression in channels alleviates\nthe computational burden of DM. Furthermore, we devise a position encoding\nscheme when integrating the LHFR into the restoration network, enabling\ndistinctive guidance in different depths of the restoration network.\nComprehensive experiments verify that by combining generative DM and\ntransformer, DiffStereo achieves both higher reconstruction accuracy and better\nperceptual quality on stereo super-resolution, deblurring, and low-light\nenhancement compared with state-of-the-art methods.",

The Hubble Tension, with a significance above 5$\\sigma$, and the $S_8$\ntension, showing a discrepancy of approximately 2-4$\\sigma$, highlight\ninconsistencies between measurements of the local and early universe. This\npaper expands a well-established Interacting Dark Energy (IDE) phenomenological\nscenario, where dark matter (DM) can transfer energy to dark energy (DE) or\nvice versa, depending on the sign of the coupling parameter $\\xi$. The novel\nfeature consists in a transition mechanism which reverses the direction of the\nenergy-momentum transfer after the redshift where the densities of the dark\nspecies are the same. We evaluate this model using a comprehensive set of\nrecent observational data, including Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) from\nthe DESI survey, Type Ia Supernovae from the PantheonPlus, DESY5 and Union3\nsamples, and Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data from Planck. Our analysis\nshows that this scenario can potentially relax both the $H_0$ and $S_8$\ntensions simultaneously. We find the new model to be weakly preferred over\n$\\Lambda$CDM by BAO-DESI data.

To overcome these limitations,\nwe investigate a hierarchical architecture for autoregressive language\nmodelling that combines character-level and word-level processing. It employs a\nlightweight character-level encoder to convert character sequences into word\nembeddings, which are then processed by a word-level backbone model and decoded\nback into characters via a compact character-level decoder. This method retains\nthe sequence compression benefits of word-level tokenization without relying on\na rigid, predefined vocabulary. We demonstrate, at scales up to 7 billion\nparameters, that hierarchical transformers match the downstream task\nperformance of subword-tokenizer-based models while exhibiting significantly\ngreater robustness to input perturbations. Additionally, during continued\npretraining on an out-of-domain language, our model trains almost twice as\nfast, achieves superior performance on the target language, and retains more of\nits previously learned knowledge.

    "abstract": "Benefiting from recent advancements in large language models and modality\nalignment techniques, existing Large Vision-Language Models(LVLMs) have\nachieved prominent performance across a wide range of scenarios. However, the\nexcessive computational complexity limits the widespread use of these models in\npractical applications. We argue that one main bottleneck in computational\ncomplexity is caused by the involvement of redundant vision sequences in model\ncomputation. This is inspired by a reassessment of the efficiency of vision and\nlanguage information transmission in the language decoder of LVLMs. Then, we\npropose a novel hierarchical vision-language interaction mechanism called\nHierarchical Vision injection for Mixture Attention (HiMix). In HiMix, only the\nlanguage sequence undergoes full forward propagation, while the vision sequence\ninteracts with the language at specific stages within each language decoder\nlayer. It is striking that our approach significantly reduces computational\ncomplexity with minimal performance loss. Specifically, HiMix achieves a 10x\nreduction in the computational cost of the language decoder across multiple\nLVLM models while maintaining comparable performance. This highlights the\nadvantages of our method, and we hope our research brings new perspectives to\nthe field of vision-language understanding. Project Page:\nhttps://xuange923.github.io/HiMix",

To mitigate this, IGUs are often filled with\nlow-conductivity gases like Argon. However, Argon concentration decreases over\ntime due to IGU aging and manufacturing processes, which lessens their\ninsulating effectiveness. This study presents a novel nondestructive\nmethodology to quantify Argon concentration in IGUs using ultrasonic technique.\nThe ultrasonic energy transmitted through the IGU is correlated with Argon\nconcentration, validated through both experimental measurements and numerical\nmodels using COMSOL Multiphysics. The models simulate acoustic-structure\ninteraction by adjusting gas density to reflect Argon presence, showing\nincreased ultrasonic energy with higher Argon concentrations. Experimental\nmeasurements on two IGU samples with twenty Argon-air mixtures (ranging from\n100% to 25% Argon) show that the proposed ultrasonic technique achieves a mean\nabsolute error of 0.13, outperforming Spark Emission Spectroscopy and Helantec\nISO-GAS-Control, which have errors of 2.31 and 0.33, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Recent LLMs have enabled significant advancements for conversational agents.\nHowever, they are also well known to hallucinate, producing responses that seem\nplausible but are factually incorrect. On the other hand, users tend to\nover-rely on LLM-based AI agents, accepting AI's suggestion even when it is\nwrong. Adding positive friction, such as explanations or getting user\nconfirmations, has been proposed as a mitigation in AI-supported\ndecision-making systems. In this paper, we propose an accountability model for\nLLM-based task-oriented dialogue agents to address user overreliance via\nfriction turns in cases of model uncertainty and errors associated with\ndialogue state tracking (DST). The accountability model is an augmented LLM\nwith an additional accountability head that functions as a binary classifier to\npredict the relevant slots of the dialogue state mentioned in the conversation.\nWe perform our experiments with multiple backbone LLMs on two established\nbenchmarks (MultiWOZ and Snips). Our empirical findings demonstrate that the\nproposed approach not only enables reliable estimation of AI agent errors but\nalso guides the decoder in generating more accurate actions. We observe around\n3% absolute improvement in joint goal accuracy (JGA) of DST output by\nincorporating accountability heads into modern LLMs. Self-correcting the\ndetected errors further increases the JGA from 67.13 to 70.51, achieving\nstate-of-the-art DST performance. Finally, we show that error correction\nthrough user confirmations (friction turn) achieves a similar performance gain,\nhighlighting its potential to reduce user overreliance.",

Bound RNAs require divalents like Mg2+ and/or Ca2+, preferring more\nordered phospholipids: gel, ripple or rafted membranes, in that order. RNAs\nalso bind and stabilize bilayers that are bent or sharply deformed. In\ncontrast, RNA binding without divalents extends to negatively charged membranes\nformed from simpler anionic phospholipids, and to plausibly prebiotic fatty\nacid bilayers. RNA-membranes also retain RNA function, such as base pairing,\npassive transport of tryptophan, specific affinity for peptide side chains,\nlike arginine, and catalysis by ribozymic ligase. Multiple membrane-bound RNAs\nwith biochemical functions, linked by specific base-pairing are readily\nconstructed. Given these experimental facts, genetic effects seem plausible.\nRNA functions often reside in few nucleotides, and are easily joined in a small\nRNA. Base-paired groups of these can evolve to be purposeful, joining related\nRNA functions. Such RNA groups permit complex genome functions, but require\nonly replication of short RNAs. RNA-membranes facilitate accurate RNA\nsegregation at cell division, and quickly evolve by appending new base-paired\nfunctions.

In particular, the long-tail effect can hamper the system's\nperformance in terms of accuracy, thus leading to false positives in the\nprovided recommendations. Foundation models are the most advanced generative\nAI-based models that achieve relevant results in several SE tasks.\n  This paper aims to investigate the capability of large language models (LLMs)\nto address the popularity bias in recommender systems of third-party libraries\n(TPLs).

This study aimed to\nelucidate the physical mechanisms underlying this phenomenon by analyzing the\nex vivo filling process in rat from a fully voided state to complete\ndistension, without preconditioning, using three complementary imaging\nmodalities. High-resolution micro-CT at 10.8 {\\mu}m resolution was used to\ngenerate detailed 3D reconstructions of the bladder lumen, revealing a 62 fold\nincrease in bladder volume during filling. Pressure-volume studies of whole\nbladder delineated three mechanical filling regimes: an initial high-compliance\nphase, a transitional phase, and a final high-pressure phase. While prior\nstudies conjectured small mucosal rugae (450 {\\mu}m) are responsible for the\nhigh compliance phase, multiphoton microscopy (MPM) of the dome of the voided\nbladder revealed large folds an order of magnitude larger than these rugae.\nBladder imaging during the inflation process demonstrated flattening of these\nlarge scale folds is responsible for volume increases in the initial high\ncompliance phase. The 3D reconstructions of the bladder lumen in the filled and\nvoided state revealed a high voiding efficiency of 97.13%. The MPM imaging\nresults suggest the large scale folds in the dome enable this high voiding\nfraction by driving urine toward the bladder outlet. These insights are vital\nfor computational models of bladder biomechanics and understanding changes to\nbladder function due to pathological conditions such as bladder outlet\nobstruction and age-related dysfunction.",

In zero field, neutron diffraction data show no\ntransition to a magnetically ordered state down to the lowest experimentally\navailable temperature of 35 mK, and the material remains magnetically\ndisordered down to this temperature. Polarised neutron diffraction measurements\nreveal the presence of a diffuse scattering signal suggesting only very weak\nspin-spin correlations in the ground state. For H // c (the easy magnetisation\ndirection), we followed the magnetisation process using neutron diffraction\nmeasurements and observed the appearance of field-induced magnetic Bragg peaks\nwith integer h and k indices in the (hk0) scattering plane. No magnetic peaks\nwith a non-zero propagation vector were detected. The observed in-field data\nfit well to a simple two-sublattice model with magnetic moments aligned along\nthe field direction but being significantly different in magnitude for the two\ninequivalent Tb3+ sites in the unit cell.

Vector processors address the scale-up challenge by decoupling\nVector Register File (VRF) and datapath widths, allowing the VRF to host long\nvectors and increase register-stored data reuse while reducing the relative\ncost of instruction fetch and decode. However, even the largest vector\nprocessor designs today struggle to scale to more than 8 vector lanes with\ndouble-precision Floating Point Units (FPUs) and 256 64-bit elements per vector\nregister. This limitation is induced by difficulties in the physical\nimplementation, which becomes wire-dominated and inefficient.

    "abstract": "The mass distribution of merging binary black holes is generically predicted\nto evolve with redshift, reflecting systematic changes in their astrophysical\nenvironment, stellar progenitors, and/or dominant formation channels over\ncosmic time. Whether or not such an effect is observed in gravitational-wave\ndata, however, remains an open question, with some contradictory results\npresent in the literature. In this paper, we study the ensemble of binary black\nholes within the latest GWTC-3 catalog released by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA\nCollaboration, systematically surveying for possible evolution of their mass\ndistribution with redshift. We specifically focus on two key features present\nin the binary black hole primary mass distribution -- (1) an excess of\n$35\\,M_\\odot$ black holes and (2) a broad power-law continuum ranging from 10\nto $\\gtrsim 80 M_\\odot$ -- and ask if one or both of these features are\nobserved to vary with redshift. We find no evidence that either the Gaussian\npeak or power-law continuum components of the mass distribution change with\nredshift. In some cases, we place somewhat stringent bounds on the degree of\nallowed redshift evolution. Most notably, we find that the mean location of the\n$35\\,M_\\odot$ peak and the slope of the power-law continuum are constrained to\nremain approximately constant below redshift $z\\approx 1$. The data remain more\nagnostic about other forms of redshift dependence, such as evolution in the\nheight of the $35\\,M_\\odot$ excess or the minimum and maximum black hole\nmasses. In all cases, we conclude that a redshift-dependent mass spectrum\nremains possible, but that it is not required by current data.",

For example, we may seek to make decisions that have at\nleast the reward of a reference ``default'' decision, with as low a cost as\npossible. This problem was recently introduced in the Multi-Armed Bandits with\nCost Subsidy (MAB-CS) framework. MAB-CS is broadly applicable to problem\ndomains where a primary metric (cost) is constrained by a secondary metric\n(reward), and the rewards are unknown. In our work, we address variants of\nMAB-CS including ones with reward constrained by the reward of a known\nreference arm or by the subsidized best reward. We introduce the\nPairwise-Elimination (PE) algorithm for the known reference arm variant and\ngeneralize PE to PE-CS for the subsidized best reward variant. Our\ninstance-dependent analysis of PE and PE-CS reveals that both algorithms have\nan order-wise logarithmic upper bound on Cost and Quality Regret, making our\npolicies the first with such a guarantee. Moreover, by comparing our upper and\nlower bound results we establish that PE is order-optimal for all known\nreference arm problem instances. Finally, experiments are conducted using the\nMovieLens 25M and Goodreads datasets for both PE and PE-CS revealing the\neffectiveness of PE and the superior balance between performance and\nreliability offered by PE-CS compared to baselines from the literature.",

We provide a valid, fast,\neasy-to-implement subsampling bootstrap method for constructing confidence\nintervals for asymptotically linear estimators and discuss its application to\nsemiparametric causal inference. Our method, inspired by the Cheap Bootstrap\n(Lam, 2022), leverages the quantiles of a t-distribution and has the desired\ncoverage with few bootstrap replications. We show that the method is\nasymptotically valid if the subsample size is chosen appropriately as a\nfunction of the sample size. We illustrate our method with data from the LEADER\ntrial (Marso et al., 2016), obtaining confidence intervals for a longitudinal\ntargeted minimum loss-based estimator (van der Laan and Gruber, 2012). Through\na series of empirical experiments, we also explore the impact of subsample\nsize, sample size, and the number of bootstrap repetitions on the performance\nof the confidence interval.",

Additionally, associative\npolymer chain configurational bias method is developed to improve sampling\nefficiency, demonstrating a significantly faster relaxation process. First, we\nset non-bonded interactions to be zero, and only keep the chain connectivity\nand association.

It emerged that the excluded volume effect and solvents immiscibility\neffects can result in inhomogeneous associating probability distribution along\nthe chain contour, in contrast to the homogeneity observed in ideal systems,\nthereby shifting from the binomial distribution to Poisson binomial\ndistribution. At last, the study is extended to cooperative association\nsystems.

    "abstract": "Virtualization in 5G and beyond networks allows the creation of virtual\nnetworks, or network slices, tailored to meet the requirements of various\napplications. However, this flexibility introduces several challenges for\ninfrastructure providers (InPs) in slice admission control (AC) and resource\nallocation. To maximize revenue, InPs must decide in real-time whether to admit\nnew slice requests (SRs) given slices' revenues, limited infrastructure\nresources, unknown relationship between resource allocation and Quality of\nService (QoS), and the unpredictability of future SRs. To address these\nchallenges, this paper introduces a novel data-driven framework for 5G slice\nadmission control that offers a guaranteed upper bound on the competitive\nratio, i.e., the ratio between the revenue obtained by an oracle solution and\nthat of the online solution. The proposed framework leverages a pricing\nfunction to dynamically estimate resources' pseudo-prices that reflect resource\nscarcity. Such prices are further coupled with a resource allocation algorithm,\nwhich leverages a machine-learned slice model and employs a primal-dual\nalgorithm to determine the minimum-cost resource allocation. The resource cost\nis then compared with the offered revenue to admit or reject a SR. To\ndemonstrate the efficacy of our framework, we train the data-driven slice model\nusing real traces collected from our 5G testbed. Our results show that our\nnovel approach achieves up to 42% improvement in the empirical competitive\nratio, i.e., ratio between the optimal and the online solution, compared to\nother benchmark algorithms.",

To address these challenges, we\npropose GauSTAR, a novel method that achieves photo-realistic rendering,\naccurate surface reconstruction, and reliable 3D tracking for general dynamic\nscenes with changing topology. Given multi-view captures as input, GauSTAR\nbinds Gaussians to mesh faces to represent dynamic objects. For surfaces with\nconsistent topology, GauSTAR maintains the mesh topology and tracks the meshes\nusing Gaussians. For regions where topology changes, GauSTAR adaptively unbinds\nGaussians from the mesh, enabling accurate registration and generation of new\nsurfaces based on these optimized Gaussians. Additionally, we introduce a\nsurface-based scene flow method that provides robust initialization for\ntracking between frames. Experiments demonstrate that our method effectively\ntracks and reconstructs dynamic surfaces, enabling a range of applications.

    "abstract": "The study of quantum nonlocality sharing has garnered significant attention,\nparticularly for two-qubit and three-qubit entangled systems. In this paper, we\nextend the investigation to $n$-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ)\nsystems, analyzing nonlocality sharing under unbiased unsharp measurements.\nEmploying the Seevink and Svetlichny inequalities, we explore both unilateral\nand multilateral sequential measurement scenarios. In the unilateral scenario,\nwe derive the range for which an observer's multiple copies can share genuine\n$n$-partite nonlocality with single copies of the remaining parties. In the\nmultilateral scenario, we identify the maximum number of independent observers\non $m$ sides who can share genuine $n$-partite nonlocality with other parties.\nA crucial aspect of our results is that all findings stem from a measurement\nstrategy where each sequential observer utilizes unbiased unsharp measurements.\nAs a specific case, for the four-qubit maximally entangled GHZ state, we\ndemonstrate that at most two copies of an observer (e.g., Alice) can share\nnonlocality in the unilateral sequential measurement scenario. However, in the\nmultilateral scenario, no additional sharing is possible compared to the\nunilateral case. This finding highlights the significance of unsharp\nmeasurements in optimizing the recycling of qubits for generating quantum\nnonlocality.",

Our time complexities match the recent\nfine-grained lower bounds for these problems restricted to ambiguity of word\nautomata.\n  We deduce analogous decidability results (ignoring complexity) for the growth\nof the number of results of set queries in Monadic Second-Order logic (MSO)\nover ranked trees. In the case of polynomial growth of degree $k$, we also\nprove a reparameterization theorem for such queries: their results can be\nmapped to $k$-tuples of input nodes in a finite-to-one and MSO-definable\nfashion.\n  This property of MSO set queries leads directly to a generalization of the\ndimension minimization theorem for string-to-string polyregular functions.

    "abstract": "Projections of hypercubes have been applied to visualize high-dimensional\nbinary state spaces in various scientific fields. Conventional methods for\nprojecting hypercubes, however, face practical difficulties. Manual methods\nrequire nontrivial adjustments of the projection basis, while\noptimization-based algorithms limit the interpretability and reproducibility of\nthe resulting plots. These limitations motivate us to explore theoretically\nanalyzable projection algorithms such as principal component analysis (PCA).\nHere, we investigate the mathematical properties of PCA-projected hypercubes.\nOur numerical and analytical results show that PCA effectively captures\npolarized distributions within the hypercubic state space. This property\nenables the assessment of the asymptotic distribution of projected vertices and\nerror bounds, which characterize the performance of PCA in the projected space.\nWe demonstrate the application of PCA to visualize the hypercubic energy\nlandscapes of Ising spin systems, specifically finite artificial spin-ice\nsystems, including those with geometric frustration. By adding projected\nhypercubic edges, these visualizations reveal pathways of correlated spin\nflips. We confirm that the time-integrated probability flux exhibits patterns\nconsistent with the pathways identified in the projected hypercubic energy\nlandscapes. Using the mean-field model, we show that dominant state transition\npathways tend to emerge around the periphery of the projected hypercubes. Our\nwork provides a better understanding of how PCA discovers hidden patterns in\nhigh-dimensional binary data.",

We computed He 1083 nm profiles from a radiation-MHD\nsimulation of the solar atmosphere to help interpretation of the observations.\nResults: We find fast-evolving blob-like emission features in the He 1083 nm\ntriplet at locations where the magnetic field is rapidly changing direction,\nand these are likely sites of magnetic reconnection. We fit the line with a\nmodel consisting of an emitting layer located below a cold layer representing\nthe fibril canopy. The modelling provides evidence that this model, while\nsimple, catches the essential characteristics of the line formation.

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks provide reliable solutions for many classification and\nregression tasks; however, their application in real-time wireless systems with\nsimple sensor networks is limited due to high energy consumption and\nsignificant bandwidth needs. This study proposes a multi-sensor wireless\ninference system with memristor-based analog computing. Given the sensors'\nlimited computational capabilities, the features from the network's front end\nare transmitted to a central device where an $L_p$-norm inspired approximation\nof the maximum operation is employed to achieve transformation-invariant\nfeatures, enabling efficient over-the-air transmission. We also introduce a\ntrainable over-the-air sensor fusion method based on $L_p$-norm inspired\ncombining function that customizes sensor fusion to match the network and\nsensor distribution characteristics, enhancing adaptability. To address the\nenergy constraints of sensors, we utilize memristors, known for their\nenergy-efficient in-memory computing, enabling analog-domain computations that\nreduce energy use and computational overhead in edge computing. This dual\napproach of memristors and $L_p$-norm inspired sensor fusion fosters\nenergy-efficient computational and transmission paradigms and serves as a\npractical energy-efficient solution with minimal performance loss.",

We design the\nBiased Random-Key Genetic Algorithm with $Q$-Learning, Simulated Annealing, and\nIterated Local Search for use within an RKO framework, employing a single\ndecoder function.

Therefore, the CRMI introduces active coupling between the ego\nvehicle and the sensor network. Second, the reward includes a penalty on the\ndistances traveled by the sensors. Third, the reward includes a measure of\nproximity of the sensors to the ego vehicle.

In auscultatory blood pressure measurement,\na patient's systolic (maximum) and diastolic (minimum) blood pressure are\ninferred from the pressure in an inflatable cuff wrapped around the arm. This\ntechnique is the gold standard against which all other non-invasive devices are\nvalidated. However, auscultatory measurements systematically underestimate\nsystolic blood pressure and overestimate diastolic blood pressure.\nOverestimation is attributed to the increased cuff pressure needed to occlude\nthe artery because of the surrounding tissue and arterial stiffness. In\ncontrast, the cause of systolic underestimation, which leads to potentially a\nthird of systolic hypertension cases being missed, has remained unclear. When\nthe cuff is inflated beyond the systolic blood pressure, the blood flow to the\nvessels downstream of the cuff is cut off. The pressure in these downstream\nvessels drops to a low plateau. We have developed a novel experimental rig that\nshows that the low downstream pressure is the key cause of the underestimation\nof systolic blood pressure. The lower the downstream pressure, the greater the\nunderestimation. Our results yield a simple physical model for the\nunderestimation of systolic pressure in our rig and in the human body.\nUnderstanding the physics behind the underestimation of systolic blood pressure\npaves the way for developing strategies to mitigate this error.",

    "abstract": "Finite mixtures are a broad class of models useful in scenarios where\nobserved data is generated by multiple distinct processes but without explicit\ninformation about the responsible process for each data point. Estimating\nBayesian mixture models is computationally challenging due to issues such as\nhigh-dimensional posterior inference and label switching. Furthermore,\ntraditional methods such as MCMC are applicable only if the likelihoods for\neach mixture component are analytically tractable.\n  Amortized Bayesian Inference (ABI) is a simulation-based framework for\nestimating Bayesian models using generative neural networks. This allows the\nfitting of models without explicit likelihoods, and provides fast inference.\nABI is therefore an attractive framework for estimating mixture models. This\npaper introduces a novel extension of ABI tailored to mixture models. We\nfactorize the posterior into a distribution of the parameters and a\ndistribution of (categorical) mixture indicators, which allows us to use a\ncombination of generative neural networks for parameter inference, and\nclassification networks for mixture membership identification. The proposed\nframework accommodates both independent and dependent mixture models, enabling\nfiltering and smoothing.

Such attacks often include\npacket Floods that impair the QoS of the networks and Gateways and even impede\nthe Gateways capability to carry out AD. Thus, this paper first evaluates these\neffects using system measurements during Flood attacks. It then demonstrates\nhow a Smart Quasi-Deterministic Policy Forwarder (SQF) at the entrance of the\nGateway can regulate the incoming traffic to ensure that the Gateway supports\nthe AD to operate promptly during an attack.

The obtained $^{236}$U/$^{238}$U atom ratios in the dissolved phase,\nranging from about $2\\times10^{-9}$ at $100$ m depth to about\n$1.5\\times10^{-9}$ at $2350$ m depth, indicate that anthropogenic $^{236}$U\ndominates the whole water column. The corresponding deep-water column inventory\n($12.6$ ng/m$^2$ or $32.1\\times10^{12}$ atoms/m$^2$) exceeds by a factor of\n$2.5$ the expected one for global fallout at similar latitudes ($5$ ng/m$^2$ or\n$13\\times10^{12}$ atoms/m$^2$), evidencing the influence of local or regional\n$^{236}$U sources in the western Mediterranean basin. On the other hand, the\ninput of $^{236}$U associated to Saharan dust outbreaks is evaluated. It is\nestimated an additional $^{236}$U annual deposition of about $0.2$ pg/m$^2$\nbased on the study of atmospheric particles collected in Monaco during\ndifferent Saharan dust intrusions. The obtained results in the corresponding\nsuspended solids collected at DYFAMED station indicate that about $64$% of that\n$^{236}$U stays in solution in seawater. Overall, this source accounts for\nabout $0.1$% of the $^{236}$U inventory excess observed at DYFAMED station. The\ninfluence of the so-called Chernobyl fallout and the radioactive effluents\nproduced by the different nuclear installations allocated to the Mediterranean\nbasin, might explain the inventory gap, however, further studies are necessary\nto come to a conclusion about its origin.",

To address this, we propose the CNN-Swin Hybrid Network\n(CSHNet), which combines two key modules: Swin Embedded CNN (SEC) and CNN\nEmbedded Swin (CES), forming the SEC-CES-Bottleneck (SCB). SEC leverages CNN's\ndetailed feature extraction while integrating the Swin Transformer's structural\nbias. CES, in turn, preserves the Swin Transformer's global integrity,\ncompensating for CNN's lack of focus on structure. Additionally, CSHNet\nincludes two components designed to enhance cross-domain information retention:\nthe Interactive Guided Connection (IGC), which enables dynamic information\nexchange between SEC and CES, and Adaptive Edge Perception Loss (AEPL), which\nmaintains structural boundaries during translation. Experimental results show\nthat CSHNet outperforms existing methods in both visual quality and performance\nmetrics across scene-level and instance-level datasets.

In previous contributions, these experiments\nwere modeled through a single-scale micromechanical simulation under the\nassumption of macroscopic homogeneity. Although efficient and accurate in many\nscenarios, simulations with low-off axis angles showed significant\ndiscrepancies with the experiments. It was hypothesized that the mismatch was\ncaused by macroscopic inhomogeneity, which would require a multiscale approach\nto capture it. However, full-field multiscale simulations remain\ncomputationally prohibitive. To address this issue, we replace the micromodel\nwith a Physically Recurrent Neural Network (PRNN), a surrogate model that\ncombines data-driven components with embedded constitutive models to capture\nhistory-dependent behavior naturally. The explainability of the latent space of\nthis network is also explored in a transfer learning strategy that requires no\nre-training. With the surrogate-based simulations, we confirm the hypothesis\nraised on the inhomogeneity of the macroscopic strain field and gain insights\ninto the influence of adjustment of the experimental setup with oblique\nend-tabs. Results from the surrogate-based multiscale approach show better\nagreement with experiments than the single-scale micromechanical approach over\na wide range of settings, although with limited accuracy on the creep\nexperiments, where macroscopic test effects were implicitly taken into account\nin the material properties calibration.",

Accelerating ML models, whether for training, or\ninference, heavily relies on matrix multiplications that can be efficiently\nexecuted on vector processors, or custom matrix engines. This work aims to\nintegrate the simplicity of structured sparsity into vector execution to speed\nup the corresponding matrix multiplications. Initially, the implementation of\nstructured-sparse matrix multiplication using the current RISC-V instruction\nset vector extension is comprehensively explored. Critical parameters that\naffect performance, such as the impact of data distribution across the scalar\nand vector register files, data locality, and the effectiveness of loop\nunrolling are analyzed both qualitatively and quantitatively. Furthermore, it\nis demonstrated that the addition of a single new instruction would reap even\nhigher performance. The newly proposed instruction is called vindexmac, i.e.,\nvector index-multiply-accumulate. It allows for indirect reads from the vector\nregister file and it reduces the number of instructions executed per matrix\nmultiplication iteration, without introducing additional dependencies that\nwould limit loop unrolling. The proposed new instruction was integrated in a\ndecoupled RISC-V vector processor with negligible hardware cost. Experimental\nresults demonstrate the runtime efficiency and the scalability offered by the\nintroduced optimizations and the new instruction for the execution of\nstate-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Networks.

A model based on phase fields is introduced\nthat takes into account fluid flow, capillary effects, and wetting behavior,\nall of which play an important role in drying. In addition, the MPF makes it\npossible to track the movement of the liquid-air interface without\ncomputationally expensive adaptive mesh generation. The presented model is used\nfor the first time to investigate pore emptying in real hard carbon\nmicrostructures. For this purpose, the microstructures of real dried electrodes\nare used as input for the simulations. The simulations performed here\ndemonstrate the importance of considering the resolved microstructural\ninformation compared to models that rely only on statistical geometry\nparameters such as pore size distributions. The influence of various parameters\nsuch as different microstructures, fluid viscosity, and the contact angle on\npore emptying are investigated. In addition, this work establishes a\ncorrelation between the capillary number and the breakthrough time of the\nsolvent as well as the height difference of the solvent front at the time of\nbreakthrough. The results indicate that the drying process can be optimized by\ndoping the particle surface, which changes the contact angle between the fluids\nand the particles.",

Many current\nhigh-performance XML models are composed of a lot of hyperparameters, which\ncomplicates the tuning process.

The\nproposed method not only has a closed-form solution but also is composed of a\nsingle hyperparameter. Since there are no precedents on applying ridge\nregression to XML, this paper verified the performance of the method by using\nvarious XML benchmark datasets.

These concerns are\ncompounded by the use of licensed models, where end-users purchase third-party\nmodels with only black-box access to protect model intellectual property (IP).\nIn such scenarios, conventional approaches to verify model integrity require\nknowledge of model parameters or cooperative model owners. To address this\nchallenge, we propose Michscan, a methodology leveraging power analysis to\nverify the integrity of black-box TinyML neural networks designed for\nresource-constrained devices. Michscan is based on the observation that\nmodifications to model parameters impact the instantaneous power consumption of\nthe device. We leverage this observation to develop a runtime model\nintegrity-checking methodology that employs correlational power analysis using\na golden template or signature to mathematically quantify the likelihood of\nmodel integrity violations at runtime through the Mann-Whitney U-Test. Michscan\noperates in a black-box environment and does not require a cooperative or\ntrustworthy model owner. We evaluated Michscan using an STM32F303RC\nmicrocontroller with an ARM Cortex-M4 running four TinyML models in the\npresence of three model integrity violations. Michscan successfully detected\nall integrity violations at runtime using power data from five inferences.

The key\nquestion is whether there exists an optimal strategy for selecting $\\lambda$\nafter each restart taking into account that the computational costs (runtime)\nincreases with $\\lambda$. In this work, potential restart strategies are\nclassified into parameter-dependent strategy types. A loss function is\nintroduced to quantify the wasted computational cost relative to the optimal\nstrategy.

In\nparticular, we analyze the scale of the mobility in the model, to ensure that\nthe model asymptotically approaches the sharp interface limit as the interface\nthickness approaches zero. For accurate calculations of surface tension, we\nintroduce a generalized form of smoothed Dirac delta functions that can adjust\nthe thickness of the tension layer, while strictly maintaining that its\nintegral equals one, even when the interface profile is not in equilibrium.\nFurthermore, we theoretically demonstrate that the spontaneous shrinkage of\nunder-resolved interface structures encountered in the Cahn-Hilliard phase\nfield method does not occur in the improved phase field model. Through various\nnumerical experiments, we determine the range of the optimal mobility, confirm\nthe theoretical analysis of the improved phase field model, verify its\nconvergence, and examine the performance of different surface tension models.\nThe numerical experiments include Rayleigh-Taylor instability, axisymmetric\nrising bubbles, droplet migration due to the Marangoni effect, partial\ncoalescence of a droplet into a pool, and deformation of three-dimensional\ndroplet in shear flow. In all these cases, numerical results are validated\nagainst experimental data and/or theoretical predictions.

In this work\nwe introduce a novel TDE implementation on CMOS. The circuit is robust to\ndevice mismatch and allows the linear integration of input events. This is\ncrucial for enabling a high-density implementation of many TDEs on the same\ndie, and for realising real-time parallel processing of the high-event-rate\ndata produced by event-driven sensors.",

Machine learning algorithms and\nfeature extraction methods have been employed to improve predictions and\nexplore healthy and accelerated aging e.g. neurodegenerative and psychiatric\ndisorders. The high-dimensional MRI data pose challenges to building\ngeneralizable and interpretable models as well as for data privacy. Common\npractices are resampling or averaging voxels within predefined parcels, which\nreduces anatomical specificity and biological interpretability as voxels within\na region may differently relate to aging. Effectively, naive fusion by\naveraging can result in information loss and reduced accuracy. We present a\nconceptually novel two-level stacking ensemble (SE) approach. The first level\ncomprises regional models for predicting individuals' age based on voxel-wise\ninformation, fused by a second-level model yielding final predictions. Eight\ndata fusion scenarios were explored using as input Gray matter volume (GMV)\nestimates from four datasets covering the adult lifespan. Performance, measured\nusing mean absolute error (MAE), R2, correlation and prediction bias, showed\nthat SE outperformed the region-wise averages. The best performance was\nobtained when first-level regional predictions were obtained as out-of-sample\npredictions on the application site with second-level models trained on\nindependent and site-specific data (MAE=4.75 vs baseline regional mean GMV\nMAE=5.68).

    "abstract": "Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly essential in various fields\nsuch as surveillance, reconnaissance, and telecommunications. This study aims\nto develop a learning algorithm for the path planning of UAV wireless\ncommunication relays, which can reduce storage requirements and accelerate Deep\nReinforcement Learning (DRL) convergence. Assuming the system possesses terrain\nmaps of the area and can estimate user locations using localization algorithms\nor direct GPS reporting, it can input these parameters into the learning\nalgorithms to achieve optimized path planning performance. However, higher\nresolution terrain maps are necessary to extract topological information such\nas terrain height, object distances, and signal blockages. This requirement\nincreases memory and storage demands on UAVs while also lengthening convergence\ntimes in DRL algorithms. Similarly, defining the telecommunication coverage map\nin UAV wireless communication relays using these terrain maps and user position\nestimations demands higher memory and storage utilization for the learning path\nplanning algorithms. Our approach reduces path planning training time by\napplying a dimensionality reduction technique based on Principal Component\nAnalysis (PCA), sample combination, Prioritized Experience Replay (PER), and\nthe combination of Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) loss\ncalculations in the coverage map estimates, thereby enhancing a Twin Delayed\nDeep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) algorithm. The proposed solution\nreduces the convergence episodes needed for basic training by approximately\nfour times compared to the traditional TD3.",

While\nthe beamforming design problem for the CF integrated sensing and communication\n(ISAC) paradigm has been addressed in the literature, existing methods rely on\ncentralized signal processing, leading to fronthaul load and scalability\nissues. This paper presents a two-stage beamforming design for the CF ISAC\nparadigm, aiming to significantly reduce the fronthaul load by distributing the\nsignal processing tasks between the central unit (CU) and the access points\n(APs). The design optimizes the sum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio\n(SINR) for communication users, subject to per-AP power constraints and\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR) requirements for radio-sensing purposes. The\nresulting optimization problems are non-convex and challenging to solve. To\naddress this, we employ a majorization-minimization (MM) approach, which\ndecomposes the problem into simpler convex subproblems. The results show that\nthe two-stage beamforming design achieves performance comparable to centralized\nmethods while substantially reducing the fronthaul load, thus minimizing data\ntransmission requirements over the fronthaul network.

    "abstract": "In the realm of multi-object tracking, the challenge of accurately capturing\nthe spatial and temporal relationships between objects in video sequences\nremains a significant hurdle. This is further complicated by frequent\noccurrences of mutual occlusions among objects, which can lead to tracking\nerrors and reduced performance in existing methods. Motivated by these\nchallenges, we propose a novel adaptive key frame mining strategy that\naddresses the limitations of current tracking approaches. Specifically, we\nintroduce a Key Frame Extraction (KFE) module that leverages reinforcement\nlearning to adaptively segment videos, thereby guiding the tracker to exploit\nthe intrinsic logic of the video content. This approach allows us to capture\nstructured spatial relationships between different objects as well as the\ntemporal relationships of objects across frames. To tackle the issue of object\nocclusions, we have developed an Intra-Frame Feature Fusion (IFF) module.\nUnlike traditional graph-based methods that primarily focus on inter-frame\nfeature fusion, our IFF module uses a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to\nfacilitate information exchange between the target and surrounding objects\nwithin a frame. This innovation significantly enhances target\ndistinguishability and mitigates tracking loss and appearance similarity due to\nocclusions. By combining the strengths of both long and short trajectories and\nconsidering the spatial relationships between objects, our proposed tracker\nachieves impressive results on the MOT17 dataset, i.e., 68.6 HOTA, 81.0 IDF1,\n66.6 AssA, and 893 IDS, proving its effectiveness and accuracy.",

On modern\nhardware, these are usually efficiently implemented by floating-point numbers.\nHowever, due to their finite precision, many floating-point operations lead to\nsmall imprecisions. Probabilistic model checkers claim trustworthiness on the\nground of a solid theoretical basis, yet prior work has uncovered discrepancies\nbetween the claimed and actual accuracy of these systems. How can we trust\nimplementations of model checkers? Our answer is an efficiently executable,\nformally verified implementation of interval iteration for MDPs. Our\ncorrectness proofs span the entire development from the high-level abstract\nsemantics of MDPs to the low-level implementation in LLVM that uses\nfloating-point arithmetic. We use the Isabelle/HOL proof assistant to verify\nthe abstract definition of interval iteration. Next, we employ step-wise\nrefinement to derive an efficient implementation in LLVM code. To that end, we\nextend the Isabelle Refinement Framework with support for reasoning about\nfloating point arithmetic and directed rounding modes. We experimentally\nevaluate our implementation on a set of benchmark MDPs.

Classical algorithms can efficiently compute policies that are optimal\nwith respect to, e.g., reachability probabilities. However, these policies are\nthen given in a tabular format. A longstanding challenge is to represent\noptimal or almost-optimal policies concisely, e.g., as decision trees. This\npaper makes two contributions towards this challenge: first, an SMT-based\napproach to encode a given (optimal) policy as a small decision tree, and\nsecond, an abstraction-refinement loop that searches for policies that are\noptimal within the set of policies that can be represented with a small tree.\nTechnically, the latter combines the SMT encoding with verification approaches\nfor families of Markov chains. The empirical evaluation demonstrates the\nfeasibility of these approaches and shows how they can outperform the\nstate-of-the-art on various benchmarks, yielding up to 20 times smaller trees\nrepresenting (almost) optimal policies for models with up to 10k states and 19\nvariables.",

For a constant\nsupersonic incoming flow past an infinitely long circular cone, a conic shock\nattached to the tip of the cone will form, provided the opening angle of the\ncone is less than a critical value. We introduce the shock polar for the radial\nand polar components of the velocity and show that there exists a monotonicity\nrelation between the shock angle and the radial velocity, which seems to be new\nand not been observed before. If a supersonic incoming flow is self-similar\nwith nonzero azimuthal velocity, a conic shock also form attached to the tip of\nthe cone. The state at the downstream may change smoothly from supersonic to\nsubsonic, thus the shock can be supersonic-supersonic, supersonic-subsonic and\neven supersonic-sonic where the shock front and the sonic front coincide. We\nfurther investigate the structural stability of smooth self-similar\nirrotational transonic flows and analyze the corresponding linear mixed type\nsecond order equation of Tricomi type.

We use\nconformal inference to construct a prediction set that achieves finite-sample\nvalidity under censoring and maintains consistency as sample size increases,\nusing a conformity score function designed for interval data. The procedure\naccommodates the prediction uncertainty that is irreducible (due to the\nstochastic nature of outcomes), the modelling uncertainty due to partial\nidentification and also sampling uncertainty that gets reduced as samples get\nlarger. We conduct a set of Monte Carlo simulations and an application to data\nfrom the Current Population Survey. The results highlight the robustness and\nefficiency of the proposed methods.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, Model-based Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) has\ndemonstrated significant advantages over model-free methods in terms of sample\nefficiency by using independent environment dynamics world models for data\nsample augmentation. However, without considering the limited sample size,\nthese methods still lag behind model-free methods in terms of final convergence\nperformance and stability. This is primarily due to the world model's\ninsufficient and unstable representation of global states in partially\nobservable environments. This limitation hampers the ability to ensure global\nconsistency in the data samples and results in a time-varying and unstable\ndistribution mismatch between the pseudo data samples generated by the world\nmodel and the real samples. This issue becomes particularly pronounced in more\ncomplex multi-agent environments. To address this challenge, we propose a\nmodel-based MARL method called GAWM, which enhances the centralized world\nmodel's ability to achieve globally unified and accurate representation of\nstate information while adhering to the CTDE paradigm. GAWM uniquely leverages\nan additional Transformer architecture to fuse local observation information\nfrom different agents, thereby improving its ability to extract and represent\nglobal state information. This enhancement not only improves sample efficiency\nbut also enhances training stability, leading to superior convergence\nperformance, particularly in complex and challenging multi-agent environments.\nThis advancement enables model-based methods to be effectively applied to more\ncomplex multi-agent environments. Experimental results demonstrate that GAWM\noutperforms various model-free and model-based approaches, achieving\nexceptional performance in the challenging domains of SMAC.",

Much research on making agents useful and safe focuses on\ndirectly modifying their behaviour, such as by training them to follow user\ninstructions. Direct behavioural modifications are useful, but do not fully\naddress how heterogeneous agents will interact with each other and other\nactors. Rather, we will need external protocols and systems to shape such\ninteractions. For instance, agents will need more efficient protocols to\ncommunicate with each other and form agreements. Attributing an agent's actions\nto a particular human or other legal entity can help to establish trust, and\nalso disincentivize misuse. Given this motivation, we propose the concept of\n\\textbf{agent infrastructure}: technical systems and shared protocols external\nto agents that are designed to mediate and influence their interactions with\nand impacts on their environments. Just as the Internet relies on protocols\nlike HTTPS, our work argues that agent infrastructure will be similarly\nindispensable to ecosystems of agents.

A graph is co-bipartite if its complement is a\nbipartite graph. Therefore, the vertex set of a co-bipartite graph can be\npartitioned into two disjoint cliques.\n  The concept of word-representability for co-bipartite graphs has not yet been\nfully studied. In the book Words and Graphs written by Sergey Kitaev and Vadim\nLozin, examples of co-bipartite graphs that are not word-representable are\nprovided. The authors have stated that it remains an open problem to\ncharacterize word-representable co-bipartite graphs. It is known that taking\nthe complement of word-representable graphs does not preserve their\nword-representability. In this paper, we first identify certain classes of\nbipartite graphs for which word-representation is preserved after the\ncomplement operation. We found that the complement of the path graphs, even\ncycle graphs and generalized crown graphs are also word-representable. Next, we\naim to find word-representable co-bipartite graphs in which the size of one\nclique partition is fixed while the other one can vary. We studied the\nword-representability of co-bipartite graphs where the sizes of one clique\npartition are $2$ and $3$. We found that any co-bipartite graphs where the size\nof the one clique partition is $2$ are word-representable. Also, when the size\nof the one clique partition is $3$, we found certain co-bipartite graphs are\nword-representable. Additionally, for word-representable graphs, it has been\nestablished that a graph is word-representable if and only if it can be\noriented in a specific manner, known as semi-transitive orientation. We provide\nthe necessary and sufficient conditions for a co-bipartite graph to have a\nsemi-transitive orientation.",

We solve the\nmagnetohydrodynamics equations and construct a self-consistent steady model of\nthe magnetized accretion flow surrounding a rotating BH, which includes TC and\nTDWs. We seek global accretion solutions spanning from the BH horizon to a\nlarge distance and analyze the solution's characteristics as a function of\ndissipation parameters. Accretion solutions with multiple critical points may\nexhibit shock waves if they meet the standing shock criteria. We found steady,\nglobal transonic, and shocked accretion solutions around the rotating BH. In\nparticular, the wind parameter ($m$) and the saturated conduction parameter\n($\\Phi_{\\rm s}$) significantly influence the dynamical behavior of shocks. The\nshock location moves away from the BH horizon as $\\Phi_{\\rm s}$ and $m$\nincrease, assuming fixed conditions at the disk's outer edge.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we establish sharp bounds for a family of Kantorovich-type\nneural network operators within the general frameworks of Sobolev-Orlicz and\nOrlicz spaces. We establish both strong (in terms of the Luxemburg norm) and\nweak (in terms of the modular functional) estimates, using different\napproaches. The strong estimates are derived for spaces generated by\n$\\varphi$-functions that are $N$-functions or satisfy the\n$\\Delta^\\prime$-condition. Such estimates also lead to convergence results with\nrespect to the Luxemburg norm in several instances of Orlicz spaces, including\nthe exponential case. Meanwhile, the weak estimates are achieved under less\nrestrictive assumptions on the involved $\\varphi$-function. To obtain these\nresults, we introduce some new tools and techniques in Orlicz spaces. Central\nto our approach is the Orlicz Minkowski inequality, which allows us to obtain\nunified strong estimates for the operators. We also present a weak (modular)\nversion of this inequality holding under weaker conditions. Additionally, we\nintroduce a novel notion of discrete absolute $\\varphi$-moments of hybrid type,\nand we employ the Hardy-Littlewood maximal operator within Orlicz spaces for\nthe asymptotic analysis. Furthermore, we introduce the new space\n$\\mathcal{W}^{1,\\varphi}(I)$, which is embedded in the Sobolev-Orlicz space\n$W^{1,\\varphi}(I)$ and modularly dense in $L^\\varphi(I)$. This allows to\nachieve asymptotic estimates for a wider class of $\\varphi$-functions,\nincluding those that do not meet the $\\Delta_2$-condition. For the extension to\nthe whole Orlicz-setting, we generalize a Sobolev-Orlicz density result given\nby H. Musielak using Steklov functions, providing a modular counterpart.\nFinally, we explore the relationships between weak and strong Orlicz Lipschitz\nclasses, providing qualitative results for the rate of convergence of the\noperators.",

Data-driven deep\nlearning (DL) models offer a promising alternative for developing predictive\nconstitutive models. When prediction is the primary focus, quantifying the\npredictive uncertainty of a trained DL model and communicating this uncertainty\nto end users is crucial for informed decision-making.\n  This study proposes a recursive Bayesian neural network (rBNN) framework,\nwhich builds upon recursive feedforward neural networks (rFFNNs) by introducing\ngeneralized Bayesian inference for uncertainty quantification. A significant\ncontribution of this work is the incorporation of a sliding window approach in\nrFFNNs, allowing the models to effectively capture temporal dependencies across\nload steps. The rBNN extends this framework by treating model parameters as\nrandom variables, with their posterior distributions inferred using generalized\nvariational inference.\n  The proposed framework is validated on two datasets: (i) a numerically\nsimulated consolidated drained (CD) triaxial dataset employing a hardening soil\nmodel and (ii) an experimental dataset comprising 28 CD triaxial tests on\nBaskarp sand. Comparative analyses with LSTM, Bi-LSTM, and GRU models\ndemonstrate that the deterministic rFFNN achieves superior predictive accuracy,\nattributed to its transparent structure and sliding window design.

They have found the\nnonlinearity-induced topological transition, while it has required complicated\nnonlinearity such as off-diagonal one. Thus, the existence of\nnonlinearity-induced transitions has been unclear under homogeneous on-site\nnonlinearity, which is ubiquitously found in nature. We here reveal that such\non-site nonlinearity can induce transitions of topological modes, where\ntopological modes converging to zero begin to converge to nonzero values. Since\nsuch nonlinearity-induced transition remains the bulk band topology unchanged,\nwe can regard it as a transition from a conventional topological mode to one\nunique to nonlinear systems. We analyze a nonlinear eigenvalue problem by\nrewriting it to a dynamical system in the spatial direction and clarify that\nthe nonlinearity-induced transition is a result of the bifurcation in the\nspatial dynamics. We also propose a possible setup to observe the\nnonlinearity-induced transition that uses a gradual amplification of nonlinear\nwaves. These results provide a general designing principle of topological\ninsulators controlled by nonlinearity.",

In this study, we adopt an\nefficient two-level clustering approach to automatically identify seasons using\nthe clear sky irradiance in first level and subsequently to identify daily\ncloud level as clear, cloudy and partly cloudy within each season in second\nlevel. In the second level of clustering, three methods are compared, namely,\nDaily Irradiance Index (DII or $\\beta$), Euclidean Distance (ED), and Dynamic\nTime Warping (DTW) distance. The DII is computed as the ratio of time integral\nof measured irradiance to time integral of the clear sky irradiance. The\nidentified clusters were compared quantitatively using established clustering\nmetrics and qualitatively by comparing the mean irradiance profiles. The\nresults clearly establish the superiority of the $\\beta$-based clustering\napproach as the leader, setting a new benchmark for solar irradiance clustering\nstudies. Moreover, $\\beta$-based clustering remains effective even for annual\ndata unlike the time-series methods which suffer significant performance\ndegradation.

    "abstract": "Anomaly detection methods typically require extensive normal samples from the\ntarget class for training, limiting their applicability in scenarios that\nrequire rapid adaptation, such as cold start. Zero-shot and few-shot anomaly\ndetection do not require labeled samples from the target class in advance,\nmaking them a promising research direction. Existing zero-shot and few-shot\napproaches often leverage powerful multimodal models to detect and localize\nanomalies by comparing image-text similarity. However, their handcrafted\ngeneric descriptions fail to capture the diverse range of anomalies that may\nemerge in different objects, and simple patch-level image-text matching often\nstruggles to localize anomalous regions of varying shapes and sizes. To address\nthese issues, this paper proposes the FiLo++ method, which consists of two key\ncomponents. The first component, Fused Fine-Grained Descriptions (FusDes),\nutilizes large language models to generate anomaly descriptions for each object\ncategory, combines both fixed and learnable prompt templates and applies a\nruntime prompt filtering method, producing more accurate and task-specific\ntextual descriptions. The second component, Deformable Localization (DefLoc),\nintegrates the vision foundation model Grounding DINO with position-enhanced\ntext descriptions and a Multi-scale Deformable Cross-modal Interaction (MDCI)\nmodule, enabling accurate localization of anomalies with various shapes and\nsizes. In addition, we design a position-enhanced patch matching approach to\nimprove few-shot anomaly detection performance. Experiments on multiple\ndatasets demonstrate that FiLo++ achieves significant performance improvements\ncompared with existing methods.

To\nenable variable compression rate, we introduce a simple but effective\nregularization mechanism named \"Tail Token Drop\" into discrete one-dimensional\nimage tokenizers.

However, current methodologies either overlook the intricacies of\ndevice physics or do not achieve satisfactory computational speeds. To bridge\nthis gap, this paper proposes a Hybrid-Parallel Collaborative (HPC) framework\nspecifically designed to analyze the Partial Differential Algebraic Equation\n(PDAE) modeled power electronic equipment, integrating the device physics and\ncircuit dynamics. The HPC framework employs a dynamic iteration to tackle the\nchallenges inherent in solving the coupled nonlinear PDAE system, and utilizes\na hybrid-parallel computing strategy to reduce computing time. Physics-based\nsystem partitioning along with hybrid-process-thread parallelization on shared\nand distributed memory are employed, facilitating the simulation of hundreds of\npartial differential equations (PDEs)-modeled devices simultaneously without\ncompromising speed. Experiments based on the hybrid line commutated converter\nand reverse-blocking integrated gate-commutated thyristors are conducted under\n3 typical real-world scenarios: semiconductor device optimization for the\nconverter; converter design optimization; and device failure analysis. The HPC\nframework delivers simulation speed up to 60 times faster than the leading\ncommercial software, while maintaining carrier-level accuracy in the\nexperiments. This shows great potential for comprehensive analysis and\ncollaborative optimization of devices and electronic power equipment,\nparticularly in extreme conditions and failure scenarios.",

In this work, we\nfirst conduct qualitative analysis to indicate that experts collapse to similar\nrepresentations in vanilla MoE, limiting the capacity of modular design and\ncomputational efficiency. Ulteriorly, Our analysis reveals that the performance\nof previous MoE variants maybe limited by a lack of diversity among experts.\nMotivated by these findings, we propose Orthogonal Mixture-of-Experts (OMoE), a\nresource-efficient MoE variant that trains experts in an orthogonal manner to\npromote diversity. In OMoE, a Gram-Schmidt process is leveraged to enforce that\nthe experts' representations lie within the Stiefel manifold. By applying\northogonal constraints directly to the architecture, OMoE keeps the learning\nobjective unchanged, without compromising optimality.

These inequalities are rooted in Wehrl's definition of\nsemiclassical entropy and his conjecture about its minimum value. Lieb resolved\nthis conjecture in 1978, posing a similar question for Bloch coherent states of\n$SU(2)$. The $SU(2)$ conjecture was settled by Lieb and Solovej in 2014, and\nthe conjecture was extended for a wide class of Lie groups. The generalized\nLieb conjecture has been resolved for several Lie groups, including $SU(N),\\,\nN\\geq 2$, $SU(1,1)$, and its $AX+B$ subgroup. Under the Li--Su assumption on\nisoperimetric regions in the complex hyperbolic ball, our sharp functional\ninequalities for the coherent state transforms extend this resolution to\n$SU(N,1),\\, N\\geq 2$. Additionally, we explore the Faber--Krahn inequality,\nwhich applies to the short-time Fourier transform with a Gaussian window. This\ninequality was previously proven by Nicola and Tilli and later extended by\nRamos and Tilli to the wavelet transform.

We translate MSTS into ten languages,\nshowing non-English prompts to increase the rate of unsafe model responses. We\nalso show models to be safer when tested with text only rather than multimodal\nprompts.

Since the symmetry properties of the closest\nWannier functions are common to those of the original atomic orbitals,\nsymmetry-adapted multipole basis (SAMB) can be defined as the complete\northonormal matrix basis set in the Hilbert space of the closest Wannier\nfunctions. Utilizing the completeness and orthonormality of SAMBs, the closest\nWannier Hamiltonian can be expressed as a linear combination of SAMBs belonging\nto the identity irreducible representation, thereby fully restoring the\nsymmetry of the system. Moreover, the linear coefficients of each SAMB (model\nparameters) related to crystalline electric fields, spin-orbit coupling, and\nelectron hoppings are determined through simple matrix projection without any\niterative procedure. Thus, this method allows us to unveil mutual interplay\namong hidden electronic multipole degrees of freedom in the Hamiltonian and\nnumerically evaluate them. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by\nmodeling monolayer graphene under a perpendicular electric field, highlighting\nits utility in symmetrizing the closest Wannier model, quantifying symmetry\nbreaking, and predicting unusual responses.

    "abstract": "Spatiotemporal optical vortices (STOVs), as a kind of structured light pulses\ncarrying transverse orbital angular momentum (OAM), have recently attracted\nsignificant research interest due to their unique photonic properties. However,\ngeneral STOV pulses typically exhibit an annular intensity profile in the\nspatiotemporal plane, with a radius that scales with the topological charge,\nlimiting their potential in many applications. Here, to address this\nlimitation, we introduce the concept of perfect spatiotemporal optical vortices\n(PSTOVs). Unlike STOV pulses, the intensity distribution of PSTOV wavepackets\nis nearly independent of the topological charge. We show that such wavepackets\ncan be generated by applying the spatiotemporal Fourier transform to a\nBessel-Gaussian mode in the spatiotemporal frequency domain. More importantly,\nthe mode distribution of PSTOV wavepackets can be freely controlled by\nintroducing azimuthal-dependent phase modulation, enabling conversion from a\nstandard annular profile to arbitrary polygonal shapes. Finally, experimental\nresults confirm the successful generation of these wavepackets. Our findings\nwill expand the study of STOV pulses and explore their potential applications\nin optical communications, information processing, topological photonics, and\nultrafast control of light-matter interactions.",

However, existing\ndiffusion-based methods have focused on the generation process in\nhigh-dimensional waveform or spectral domains, leading to increased generation\ncomplexity and slower inference speeds. Additionally, these methods have\nprimarily modelled clean speech distributions, with limited exploration of\nnoise distributions, thereby constraining the discriminative capability of\ndiffusion models for speech enhancement. To address these issues, we propose a\nnovel approach that integrates a conditional latent diffusion model (cLDM) with\ndual-context learning (DCL). Our method utilizes a variational autoencoder\n(VAE) to compress mel-spectrograms into a low-dimensional latent space. We then\napply cLDM to transform the latent representations of both clean speech and\nbackground noise into Gaussian noise by the DCL process, and a parameterized\nmodel is trained to reverse this process, conditioned on noisy latent\nrepresentations and text embeddings. By operating in a lower-dimensional space,\nthe latent representations reduce the complexity of the generation process,\nwhile the DCL process enhances the model's ability to handle diverse and unseen\nnoise environments. Our experiments demonstrate the strong performance of the\nproposed approach compared to existing diffusion-based methods, even with fewer\niterative steps, and highlight the superior generalization capability of our\nmodels to out-of-domain noise datasets\n(https://github.com/modelscope/ClearerVoice-Studio).",

However, its algorithmic\ncomplexity when applied to strongly convex functions remains unknown, as noted\nin the comprehensive review by Chambolle and Pock [2016]. This issue, aside\nfrom the critical step size, was addressed by Li et al. [2024b], with the\nmonotonic case further explored by Fu and Shi [2024]. In this paper, we\nintroduce a family of controllable momentum coefficients for forward-backward\naccelerated methods, focusing on the critical step size $s=1/L$. Unlike\ntraditional linear forms, the proposed momentum coefficients follow an\n$\\alpha$-th power structure, where the parameter $r$ is adaptively tuned to\n$\\alpha$. Using a Lyapunov function specifically designed for $\\alpha$, we\nestablish a controllable $O\\left(1/k^{2\\alpha} \\right)$ convergence rate for\nthe NAG-$\\alpha$ method, provided that $r > 2\\alpha$. At the critical step\nsize, NAG-$\\alpha$ achieves an inverse polynomial convergence rate of arbitrary\ndegree by adjusting $r$ according to $\\alpha > 0$. We further simplify the\nLyapunov function by expressing it in terms of the iterative sequences $x_k$\nand $y_k$, eliminating the need for phase-space representations. This\nsimplification enables us to extend the controllable $O \\left(1/k^{2\\alpha}\n\\right)$ rate to the monotonic variant, M-NAG-$\\alpha$, thereby enhancing\noptimization efficiency. Finally, by leveraging the fundamental inequality for\ncomposite functions, we extended the controllable $O\\left(1/k^{2\\alpha}\n\\right)$ rate to proximal algorithms, including the fast iterative\nshrinkage-thresholding algorithm (FISTA-$\\alpha$) and its monotonic counterpart\n(M-FISTA-$\\alpha$).",

It is shown\nthat increasing the exciton-plasmon coupling strength drives a transition in\nthe absorption spectra from an asymmetric Fano line shape to a Rabi splitting\npattern, while coupling the TLS to intramolecular vibrational modes reduces the\ncentral dip of the absorption spectra and makes the line shape more symmetric.\nThe simulated 2DES exhibit distinct features compared to those of a coupled\nmolecular dimer, highlighting the unique nonlinear response of plexciton\nsystems. In addition, a \"breathing mod\" pattern observed in the strong coupling\nregime can serve as a direct evidence of Rabi oscillation.",

    "abstract": "Data imbalance is a common issue in analyzing and predicting sudden traffic\nevents. Secondary crashes constitute only a small proportion of all crashes.\nThese secondary crashes, triggered by primary crashes, significantly exacerbate\ntraffic congestion and increase the severity of incidents. However, the severe\nimbalance of secondary crash data poses significant challenges for prediction\nmodels, affecting their generalization ability and prediction accuracy.\nExisting methods fail to fully address the complexity of traffic crash data,\nparticularly the coexistence of dynamic and static features, and often struggle\nto effectively handle data samples of varying lengths. Furthermore, most\ncurrent studies predict the occurrence probability and spatiotemporal\ndistribution of secondary crashes separately, lacking an integrated solution.\nTo address these challenges, this study proposes a hybrid model named\nVarFusiGAN-Transformer, aimed at improving the fidelity of secondary crash data\ngeneration and jointly predicting the occurrence and spatiotemporal\ndistribution of secondary crashes. The VarFusiGAN-Transformer model employs\nLong Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to enhance the generation of\nmultivariate long-time series data, incorporating a static data generator and\nan auxiliary discriminator to model the joint distribution of dynamic and\nstatic features. In addition, the model's prediction module achieves\nsimultaneous prediction of both the occurrence and spatiotemporal distribution\nof secondary crashes. Compared to existing methods, the proposed model\ndemonstrates superior performance in generating high-fidelity data and\nimproving prediction accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Remote sensing (RS) visual tasks have gained significant academic and\npractical importance. However, they encounter numerous challenges that hinder\neffective feature extraction, including the detection and recognition of\nmultiple objects exhibiting substantial variations in scale within a single\nimage. While prior dual-branch or multi-branch architectural strategies have\nbeen effective in managing these object variances, they have concurrently\nresulted in considerable increases in computational demands and parameter\ncounts. Consequently, these architectures are rendered less viable for\ndeployment on resource-constrained devices. Contemporary lightweight backbone\nnetworks, designed primarily for natural images, frequently encounter\ndifficulties in effectively extracting features from multi-scale objects, which\ncompromises their efficacy in RS visual tasks. This article introduces LWGANet,\na specialized lightweight backbone network tailored for RS visual tasks,\nincorporating a novel lightweight group attention (LWGA) module designed to\naddress these specific challenges. LWGA module, tailored for RS imagery,\nadeptly harnesses redundant features to extract a wide range of spatial\ninformation, from local to global scales, without introducing additional\ncomplexity or computational overhead. This facilitates precise feature\nextraction across multiple scales within an efficient framework.LWGANet was\nrigorously evaluated across twelve datasets, which span four crucial RS visual\ntasks: scene classification, oriented object detection, semantic segmentation,\nand change detection. The results confirm LWGANet's widespread applicability\nand its ability to maintain an optimal balance between high performance and low\ncomplexity, achieving SOTA results across diverse datasets. LWGANet emerged as\na novel solution for resource-limited scenarios requiring robust RS image\nprocessing capabilities.",

    "abstract": "Glassy materials yield under large external mechanical solicitations. Under\noscillatory shear, yielding shows a well-known rheological fingerprint, common\nto samples with widely different microstructures. At the microscale, this\ncorresponds to a transition between slow, solid-like dynamics and faster\nliquid-like dynamics, which can coexist at yielding in a finite range of strain\namplitudes. Here, we capture this phenomenology in a lattice model with two\nmain parameters: glassiness and disorder, describing the average coupling\nbetween adjacent lattice sites, and their variance, respectively. In absence of\ndisorder, our model yields a law of correspondent states equivalent to\ntrajectories on a cusp catastrophe manifold, a well-known class of problems\nincluding equilibrium liquid-vapour phase transitions. Introducing a finite\ndisorder in our model entails a qualitative change, to a continuous and rounded\ntransition, whose extent is controlled by the magnitude of the disorder. We\nshow that a spatial correlation length $\\xi$ emerges spontaneously from the\ncoupling between disorder and bifurcating dynamics. With vanishing disorder,\n$\\xi$ diverges and yielding becomes discontinuous, suggesting that the\nabruptness of yielding can be rationalized in terms of a lengthscale of dynamic\nheterogeneities.",

In\nthis paper, we propose that the observed high-frequency QPOs in these two short\nGRBs result from torsional oscillations in the GFs of SGRs associated with cold\nNSs, or from radial oscillations of hypermassive NSs as the hot remnants of\nbinary NS mergers, and then to constrain the EOS of NSs. For torsional\noscillations, the six selected EOSs (TM1, NL3, APR, SLy4, DDME2, and GM1) of\nNSs suitable for the zero-temperature condition exhibit significant overlap in\nmass ranges, suggesting that we cannot constrain the EOS of NSs. For radial\noscillations, the six selected EOSs (IUF, TM1, TMA, FSG, BHBLp, and NL3) of NSs\nsuitable for the high-temperature condition cannot be ruled out when redshift\nis considered.

How perovskite films form is of\nutmost significance in shaping their structural and functional characteristics.\nIn this context, the application of methylamine vapour during the precursor\ndeposition and subsequent treatment during the film formation stages emerges as\ncrucial for the development of high-quality perovskite films for solar cell\napplications. The utilization of methylamine vapour annealing is pivotal in\nimproving the crystallinity, morphology, and overall integrity of perovskite\nfilms. This work investigates the characteristics of perovskite films based on\nmethylamine lead iodide, focusing on aspects such as crystallographic structure\nand vibrational modes, which are directly linked to the performance of the\ndevices. The maximum power conversion efficiencies (PCE) obtained are 19.5% and\n18.6% using 1-step and 2-step processes are obtained. The effect of factors\nlike trap states, film homogeneity, and interfaces on the device performance\nare explored through capacitance measurements, photoluminescence, and\nelectroluminescence behaviour. The recombination behaviour of the perovskite\nfilms is correlated with the crystallographic properties. These findings\nprovide valuable insights into the influence of different processing\ntechniques, such as methylamine vapour treatment and vacuum annealing, on\nrejuvenating perovskite solar cells.",

    "abstract": "Assuming Galactic cosmic rays originate in supernovae and the winds of\nmassive stars, starburst galaxies should produce very-high-energy (VHE; E$>$100\nGeV) gamma-ray emission via the interaction of their copious quantities of\ncosmic rays with the large reservoirs of dense gas within the galaxies. Such\nVHE emission was detected by VERITAS from the starburst galaxy M 82 in 2008-09.\nAn extensive, multi-year campaign followed these initial observations, yielding\na total of 254 h of good quality VERITAS data on M 82. Leveraging modern\nanalysis techniques and the larger exposure, these VERITAS data show a more\nstatistically significant VHE signal ($\\sim$6.5 standard deviations\n($\\sigma$)). The corresponding photon spectrum is well fit by a power law\n($\\Gamma = 2.3 \\pm 0.3_{stat} \\pm0.2_{sys}$) and the observed integral flux is\nF($>$450 GeV) = $(3.2 \\pm0.6_{stat} \\pm 0.6_{sys}) \\times\n10^{-13}~\\mathrm{cm^{-2}~s}^{-1}$, or $\\sim$0.4\\% of the Crab Nebula flux above\nthe same energy threshold. The improved VERITAS measurements, when combined\nwith various multi-wavelength data, enable modeling of the underlying emission\nand transport processes. A purely leptonic scenario is found to be a poor\nrepresentation of the gamma-ray spectral energy distribution (SED). A\nlepto-hadronic scenario with cosmic rays following a power-law spectrum in\nmomentum (index $s\\simeq 2.25$), and with significant bremsstrahlung below\n$1$~GeV, provides a good match to the observed SED. The synchrotron emission\nfrom the secondary electrons indicates that efficient non-radiative losses of\ncosmic-ray electrons may be related to advective escape from the starburst\ncore.",

In this work, we introduce a novel\nAttention-Guided SElf-Reflection (AGSER) approach for zero-shot hallucination\ndetection in LLMs. The AGSER method utilizes attention contributions to\ncategorize the input query into attentive and non-attentive queries. Each query\nis then processed separately through the LLMs, allowing us to compute\nconsistency scores between the generated responses and the original answer. The\ndifference between the two consistency scores serves as a hallucination\nestimator. In addition to its efficacy in detecting hallucinations, AGSER\nnotably reduces computational overhead, requiring only three passes through the\nLLM and utilizing two sets of tokens.

Current state-of-the-art techniques feed\nsegmentation and depth estimation networks compressed PT sequences using either\nPrincipal Component Analysis (PCA) or Thermographic Signal Reconstruction\n(TSR). However, treating these two modalities independently constrains the\nperformance of PT inspection models as these representations possess\ncomplementary semantic features. To address this limitation, this work proposes\nPT-Fusion, a multi-modal attention-based fusion network that fuses both PCA and\nTSR modalities for defect segmentation and depth estimation of subsurface\ndefects in PT setups. PT-Fusion introduces novel feature fusion modules,\nEncoder Attention Fusion Gate (EAFG) and Attention Enhanced Decoding Block\n(AEDB), to fuse PCA and TSR features for enhanced segmentation and depth\nestimation of subsurface defects. In addition, a novel data augmentation\ntechnique is proposed based on random data sampling from thermographic\nsequences to alleviate the scarcity of PT datasets. The proposed method is\nbenchmarked against state-of-the-art PT inspection models, including U-Net,\nattention U-Net, and 3D-CNN on the Universit\\'e Laval IRT-PVC dataset.

Using a combination of\ngeneralized Wigner transport equation theory and machine-learning-assisted\nmolecular dynamics simulations, we reveal that the balance between\nparticle-like phonon propagating and wave-like tunneling transport mechanisms\nresults in a propagating-tunneling-invariant (PTI) ultralow thermal\nconductivity of approximately 0.6 W/mK (comparable to that of glass) over a\nbroad temperature range ($150<T<800$~K). This behavior stems from intrinsic\nstrong lattice anharmonicity driven by ferroelectric dipolar fluctuations,\neliminating the need for extrinsic structural modifications. In contrast, the\n$\\alpha$-In$_2$Se$_3$~monolayer, which shares the same stoichiometry, exhibits\na conventional temperature-dependent thermal conductivity, $\\kappa (T) \\propto\nT^{-1}$, typical of simple crystals. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the\nanharmonicity in $\\beta'$-In$_2$Se$_3$~can be precisely modulated by an\nexternal electric field, enabling on-demand control of thermal transport\nproperties, including modifying the temperature scaling behavior of heat\nconductivity and achieving a large thermal switching ratio of $\\approx$2.5.\nThese findings provide fundamental insights into the interplay between\nfield-tunable lattice anharmonicity, phonon dynamics, and thermal transport\nmechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Multi-source stationary computed tomography (MSS-CT) offers significant\nadvantages in medical and industrial applications due to its gantry-less scan\narchitecture and/or capability of simultaneous multi-source emission. However,\nthe lack of anti-scatter grid deployment in MSS-CT results in severe forward\nand/or cross scatter contamination, presenting a critical challenge that\nnecessitates an accurate and efficient scatter correction. In this work,\nComptoNet, an innovative end-to-end deep learning framework for scatter\nestimation in MSS-CT, is proposed, which integrates Compton-scattering physics\nwith deep learning techniques to address the challenges of scatter estimation\neffectively. Central to ComptoNet is the Compton-map, a novel concept that\ncaptures the distribution of scatter signals outside the scan field of view,\nprimarily consisting of large-angle Compton scatter. In ComptoNet, a reference\nCompton-map and/or spare detector data are used to guide the physics-driven\ndeep estimation of scatter from simultaneous emissions by multiple sources.\nAdditionally, a frequency attention module is employed for enhancing the\nlow-frequency smoothness. Such a multi-source deep scatter estimation framework\ndecouples the cross and forward scatter. It reduces network complexity and\nensures a consistent low-frequency signature with different photon numbers of\nsimulations, as evidenced by mean absolute percentage errors (MAPEs) that are\nless than $1.26\\%$. Conducted by using data generated from Monte Carlo\nsimulations with various phantoms, experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of\nComptoNet, with significant improvements in scatter estimation accuracy (a MAPE\nof $0.84\\%$). After scatter correction, nearly artifact-free CT images are\nobtained, further validating the capability of our proposed ComptoNet in\nmitigating scatter-induced errors.",

Furthermore, the long-term and spectral characteristics of only a ULX\nX-1 were investigated. ULX counterparts were determined from astrometric\ncalculations. The long-term light curves and SEDs were constructed to interpret\nthe origin of the optical and IR emissions. The masses and ages of donor star\ncandidates were determined using CMDs. To constrain the mechanism of X-ray\nemission, the time-averaged spectrum and long-term light curve of the X-1 were\nobtained. Unique optical and IR counterparts for ULXs X-14 and X-24 were\ndetermined, while only optical counterparts were detected for X-1 and X-18. Our\nfindings indicate that the optical emission originates from the donor stars of\nX-14 and X-24, whereas for X-1 and X-18, it is dominated by the accretion disk.\nIn addition, the X-1 exhibits long-term X-ray variability spanning orders of\nmagnitude.",

    "abstract": "Wireless devices are expected to provide a wide range of AI services in 6G\nnetworks. The increasing computing capabilities of wireless devices and the\nsurge of wireless data motivate the use of privacy-preserving federated\nlearning (FL). In contrast to centralized learning that requires sending large\namounts of raw data during uplink transmission, only local model parameters are\nuploaded in FL. Meanwhile, over-the-air (OtA) computation is considered as a\ncommunication-efficient solution for fast FL model aggregation by exploiting\nthe superposition properties of wireless multi-access channels. The required\ncommunication resources in OtA FL do not scale with the number of FL devices.\nHowever, OtA FL is significantly affected by the uneven signal attenuation\nexperienced by different FL devices. Moreover, the coexistence of multiple FL\ngroups with different FL tasks brings about inter-group interference. These\nchallenges cannot be well addressed by conventional cellular network\narchitectures. Recently, Cell-free Massive MIMO (mMIMO) has emerged as a\npromising technology to provide uniform coverage and high rates via joint\ncoherent transmission. In this paper, we investigate multi-task OtA FL in\nCell-free mMIMO systems. We propose optimal designs of transmit coefficients\nand receive combining at different levels of cooperation among the access\npoints, aiming to minimize the sum of OtA model aggregation errors across all\nFL groups. Numerical results demonstrate that Cell-free mMIMO significantly\noutperforms conventional Cellular mMIMO in term of the FL convergence\nperformance by operating at appropriate cooperation levels.",

Here, we\nreport the observation of a giant topological Hall resistivity of $\\sim 2.8 \\mu\n\\Omega$ \\text{cm} at room temperature in an epitaxial thin-film heterostructure\nof permalloy (Py, Ni$_{80}$Fe$_{20}$) and the half-metallic ferromagnet\nLa$_{0.65}$Sr$_{0.35}$MnO$_3$ (LSMO). This large magnitude of the topological\nHall effect in the Py/LSMO heterostructure, compared to a single-layer Py thin\nfilm, is attributed to the optimized combination of ferromagnetism in LSMO and\nthe strong spin-orbit-coupling-driven Rashba interaction at the interface. The\nintroduction of a ferroelectric BaTiO$_3$ (BTO) sandwich layer in the Py/LSMO\nheterostructure also leads to an enhanced topological Hall resistivity compared\nto the single-layer Py thin film. Interestingly, magnetic force microscopy\nmeasurements reveal skyrmion-like features, suggesting the origin of the\ntopological Hall effect. Our theoretical model calculations for the skyrmion\nlattice further indicate that the Rashba interaction, driven by the broken\ninversion symmetry in the Py/LSMO films, can account for the observed changes\nin the topological Hall effect at the interface. Our work opens the door for\nthe potential use of Py/LSMO thin films in spintronic applications.",

The impact of imperfect gain\ncontrol in the high-resolution regime is characterized by two asymptotic\nresults: 1) the rate loss due to overload distortion decays exponentially as\nthe loading factor increases, and 2) the rate loss due to granular distortion\ndecays quadratically as the step size vanishes. For a $2K$-level uniform\nquantizer, we prove that the optimal loading factor that maximizes the\nachievable rate scales like $2\\sqrt{\\ln (2K)}$ as the resolution increases. An\nasymptotically tight estimate of the optimal loading factor is further given,\nwhich is also highly accurate for finite resolutions.",

Furthermore, models display more pronounced ethical\ntendencies under intersectional conditions than in single-attribute settings,\nsuggesting that complex inputs reveal deeper biases.

Modular methods prioritize\nflexibility by avoiding the use of KG-fine-tuned models during retrieval,\nleading to fixed retrieval strategies and suboptimal retrieval quality.\nConversely, coupled methods embed KG information within models to improve\nretrieval quality, but at the expense of flexibility.

With the growing complexity of\ndeep neural networks (DNNs) and the introduction of advanced foundational\nmodels (FMs), the design space for DNN accelerators is expanding at an\nexponential rate. Additionally, this space is highly non-uniform and\nnon-convex, making it increasingly difficult to navigate and optimize.\nTraditional DSE techniques rely on search-based methods, which involve\niterative sampling of the design space to find the optimal solution. However,\nthis process is both time-consuming and often fails to converge to the global\noptima for such design spaces. Recently, AIrchitect v1, the first attempt to\naddress the limitations of search-based techniques, transformed DSE into a\nconstant-time classification problem using recommendation networks. In this\nwork, we propose AIrchitect v2, a more accurate and generalizable\nlearning-based DSE technique applicable to large-scale design spaces that\novercomes the shortcomings of earlier approaches. Specifically, we devise an\nencoder-decoder transformer model that (a) encodes the complex design space\ninto a uniform intermediate representation using contrastive learning and (b)\nleverages a novel unified representation blending the advantages of\nclassification and regression to effectively explore the large DSE space\nwithout sacrificing accuracy. Experimental results evaluated on 10^5 real DNN\nworkloads demonstrate that, on average, AIrchitect v2 outperforms existing\ntechniques by 15% in identifying optimal design points.

Under conditions of multi-camera inputs, the structural, textural\nand geometrical consistency among each view can be leveraged to achieve\nfine-grained object segmentation. To make better use of the above information,\nwe propose Surface representation based Self-supervised Object Segmentation\n(Surface-SOS), a new framework to segment objects for each view by 3D surface\nrepresentation from multi-view images of a scene. To model high-quality\ngeometry surfaces for complex scenes, we design a novel scene representation\nscheme, which decomposes the scene into two complementary neural representation\nmodules respectively with a Signed Distance Function (SDF). Moreover,\nSurface-SOS is able to refine single-view segmentation with multi-view\nunlabeled images, by introducing coarse segmentation masks as additional input.\nTo the best of our knowledge, Surface-SOS is the first self-supervised approach\nthat leverages neural surface representation to break the dependence on large\namounts of annotated data and strong constraints. These constraints typically\ninvolve observing target objects against a static background or relying on\ntemporal supervision in videos. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks\nincluding LLFF, CO3D, BlendedMVS, TUM and several real-world scenes show that\nSurface-SOS always yields finer object masks than its NeRF-based counterparts\nand surpasses supervised single-view baselines remarkably.

This has motivated the emergence of Hierarchical Federated\nLearning over vehicle-edge-cloud architectures (VEC-HFL). Nevertheless, one\naspect which is underexplored in the literature on VEC-HFL is that vehicles\noften need to execute multiple ML tasks simultaneously, where this multi-model\ntraining environment introduces crucial challenges. First, improper aggregation\nrules can lead to model obsolescence and prolonged training times. Second,\nvehicular mobility may result in inefficient data utilization by preventing the\nvehicles from returning their models to the network edge. Third, achieving a\nbalanced resource allocation across diverse tasks becomes of paramount\nimportance as it majorly affects the effectiveness of collaborative training.\nWe take one of the first steps towards addressing these challenges via\nproposing a framework for multi-model training in dynamic VEC-HFL with the goal\nof minimizing global training latency while ensuring balanced training across\nvarious tasks-a problem that turns out to be NP-hard. To facilitate timely\nmodel training, we introduce a hybrid synchronous-asynchronous aggregation\nrule.

    "abstract": "In high-dimensional regression, feature selection methods, such as sequential\nfeature selection (SeqFS), are commonly used to identify relevant features.\nWhen data is limited, domain adaptation (DA) becomes crucial for transferring\nknowledge from a related source domain to a target domain, improving\ngeneralization performance. Although SeqFS after DA is an important task in\nmachine learning, none of the existing methods can guarantee the reliability of\nits results. In this paper, we propose a novel method for testing the features\nselected by SeqFS-DA. The main advantage of the proposed method is its\ncapability to control the false positive rate (FPR) below a significance level\n$\\alpha$ (e.g., 0.05). Additionally, a strategic approach is introduced to\nenhance the statistical power of the test. Furthermore, we provide extensions\nof the proposed method to SeqFS with model selection criteria including AIC,\nBIC, and adjusted R-squared. Extensive experiments are conducted on both\nsynthetic and real-world datasets to validate the theoretical results and\ndemonstrate the proposed method's superior performance.",

    "abstract": "Advancements in deep learning and machine learning have improved the ability\nto model complex, nonlinear relationships, such as those encountered in complex\nmaterial inverse problems. However, the effectiveness of these methods often\ndepends on large datasets, which are not always available. In this study, the\nincorporation of domain-specific knowledge of the mechanical behavior of\nmaterial microstructures is investigated to evaluate the impact on the\npredictive performance of the models in data-scarce scenarios. To overcome data\nlimitations, a two-step framework, Learning Latent Hardening (LLH), is\nproposed. In the first step of LLH, a Deep Neural Network is employed to\nreconstruct full stress-strain curves from randomly selected portions of the\nstress-strain curves to capture the latent mechanical response of a material\nbased on key microstructural features. In the second step of LLH, the results\nof the reconstructed stress-strain curves are leveraged to predict key\nmicrostructural features of porous materials. The performance of six deep\nlearning and/or machine learning models trained with and without domain\nknowledge are compared: Convolutional Neural Networks, Deep Neural Networks,\nExtreme Gradient Boosting, K-Nearest Neighbors, Long Short-Term Memory, and\nRandom Forest. The results from the models with domain-specific information\nconsistently achieved higher $R^2$ values compared to models without prior\nknowledge. Models without domain knowledge missed critical patterns linking\nstress-strain behavior to microstructural changes, whereas domain-informed\nmodels better identified essential stress-strain features predictive of\nmicrostructure. These findings highlight the importance of integrating\ndomain-specific knowledge with deep learning to achieve accurate outcomes in\nmaterials science.",

In lattice systems under magnetic fields up to\nseveral tens of teslas, Zeeman effects on electron spins have been extensively\nstudied, while the impact on orbital motion has often been considered\nnegligible. However, the recent capability to generate ultra-high magnetic\nfields exceeding 1000 T has renewed interest in understanding their influence\non ordered phases in correlated electron systems, beyond spin-related\nphenomena. To examine these effects, we incorporate a magnetic field into the\nextended Falicov-Kimball model by introducing the Peierls phase into the\ntransfer integrals, enabling the study of orbital motion. Using the\nHartree-Fock approximation, we reveal a nonmonotonic response of the excitonic\norder parameter to increasing magnetic fields. At sufficiently high fields, the\nexcitonic order is suppressed, resulting in a disordered insulating state\ncharacterized by partial occupation of the two orbitals with nonzero Chern\nnumbers. This state is distinct from a fully orbital-polarized configuration.\nFurthermore, our analysis of an excitonic supersolid phase, in which excitonic\nand orbital orders coexist, demonstrates that orbital order remains robust\nunder magnetic fields, while excitonic condensation is suppressed. These\nfindings provide insights into the interplay between orbital motion and\nmagnetic fields in multi-orbital correlated electron systems.",

    "abstract": "Although significant progress has been made in the field of speech-driven 3D\nfacial animation recently, the speech-driven animation of an indispensable\nfacial component, eye gaze, has been overlooked by recent research. This is\nprimarily due to the weak correlation between speech and eye gaze, as well as\nthe scarcity of audio-gaze data, making it very challenging to generate 3D eye\ngaze motion from speech alone. In this paper, we propose a novel data-driven\nmethod which can generate diverse 3D eye gaze motions in harmony with the\nspeech. To achieve this, we firstly construct an audio-gaze dataset that\ncontains about 14 hours of audio-mesh sequences featuring high-quality eye gaze\nmotion, head motion and facial motion simultaneously. The motion data is\nacquired by performing lightweight eye gaze fitting and face reconstruction on\nvideos from existing audio-visual datasets. We then tailor a novel\nspeech-to-motion translation framework in which the head motions and eye gaze\nmotions are jointly generated from speech but are modeled in two separate\nlatent spaces. This design stems from the physiological knowledge that the\nrotation range of eyeballs is less than that of head. Through mapping the\nspeech embedding into the two latent spaces, the difficulty in modeling the\nweak correlation between speech and non-verbal motion is thus attenuated.\nFinally, our TalkingEyes, integrated with a speech-driven 3D facial motion\ngenerator, can synthesize eye gaze motion, eye blinks, head motion and facial\nmotion collectively from speech. Extensive quantitative and qualitative\nevaluations demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in generating\ndiverse and natural 3D eye gaze motions from speech.

    "abstract": "This paper discusses how particle production from the vacuum can be explained\nby local analysis when the field theory is defined by differential geometry on\ncurved manifolds. We have performed the local analysis in a mathematically\nrigorous way, respecting the Markov property. The exact WKB is used as a tool\nfor extracting non-perturbative effect from the local system. After a serious\napplication of the differential geometry and the exact WKB to particle\nproduction, we show that entanglement does not appear in the Unruh effect as\nfar as the standard formulation by the differential geometry is valid. This\nresult should not be attributed to a consistency problem between the\n``entanglement state'' and the ``standard field theory by differential\ngeometry'', but to the fact that the conventional calculation of the Unruh\neffect is done by extrapolation which is not consistent with the differential\ngeometry. The situation is similar to that of the Dirac monopole, but topology\nis not relevant and the basis for building field theories in differential\ngeometry is strongly involved.",

We show that our assumption is supported by\ndata on test score dynamics for older workers in the HRS. Using survey data\nfrom the PSID and administrative data from the IRS and SSA, we estimate that\nthe returns to unobserved skills $declined$ substantially in the late-1980s and\n1990s despite an increase in residual inequality. Accounting for firm-specific\npay differences yields similar results. Extending our framework to consider\noccupational differences in returns to skill and multiple unobserved skills, we\nfurther show that skill returns display similar patterns for workers employed\nin each of cognitive, routine, and social occupations.

In this work, we pinpoint the pivotal\nphysics and optimization strategies for high-quality single-stage LWFAs that\nare crucial for high-gain FELs. We have delved into the synergistic injection\nmechanism, where the self-evolution injection threshold is far from reached at\nthe injection position, with both the shock front and self-evolution of the\nlaser playing a role in the injection process. A thorough discussion has been\nprovided on the beam-quality degradation and optimization strategies, in terms\nof global (slice) energy spread and projected (slice) emittance. With the goal\nof achieving high-gain FELs driven by LWFAs, we have also explored the\nsynthesis quality of the electron beam to determine an optimized power gain\nlength. A comprehensive start-to-end simulation has been conducted,\ndemonstrating the effectiveness of compact FELs powered by these high-quality\nelectron beams. The resulting radiation reaches the saturation regime after a\n4.5-meter-long undulator, with an energy of 17.4 {\\mu}J and a power of 6.0 GW\nat a wavelength of 23.9 nm.

Degree-4 vertices that\ncan fold to a completely flat state have folding kinematics that are very\nwell-understood, and thus they have been used in many engineering and physics\napplications.

In this study we employ imaginary-time propagation of an improved\nmean-field model, including the Lee-Huang-Yang interaction. The dipolar\nsolitons are subject to an expulsive Gaussian potential at the center and a\nharmonic potential $-$ both acting in the $x$-$y$ plane. The phase-coherent\nsolitons, possessing the isolated droplets, are free to move along the $z$ axis\nwithout any relative motion between the droplets. The dynamical stability and\nmobility of these solitons are demonstrated by real-time propagation employing\nthe converged imaginary-time wave function as the initial state.",

Unfortunately, existing long-vector Instruction Set\nArchitecture (ISA) extensions, such as RISC-V Vector Extension (RVV) and Arm\nScalable Vector Extension (SVE), provide only one-dimensional strided and\nrandom memory accesses. While this is sufficient for typical vector engines, it\nfails to effectively utilize the large Single Instruction, Multiple Data (SIMD)\nwidths of in-cache vector engines. This is because mobile data-parallel kernels\nexpose limited parallelism across a single dimension.\n  Based on our analysis of mobile vector kernels, we introduce a long-vector\nMulti-dimensional Vector ISA Extension (MVE) for mobile in-cache computing. MVE\nachieves high SIMD resource utilization and enables flexible programming by\nabstracting cache geometry and data layout. The proposed ISA features\nmulti-dimensional strided and random memory accesses and efficient\ndimension-level masked execution to encode parallelism across multiple\ndimensions. Using a wide range of data-parallel mobile workloads, we\ndemonstrate that MVE offers significant performance and energy reduction\nbenefits of 2.9x and 8.8x, on average, compared to the SIMD units of a\ncommercial mobile processor, at an area overhead of 3.6%.",

Most existing KT models rely\nexclusively on human-defined knowledge concepts (KCs) associated with\nexercises. As a result, the effectiveness of these models is highly dependent\non the quality and completeness of the predefined KCs. Human errors in labeling\nand the cost of covering all potential underlying KCs can limit model\nperformance.\n  In this paper, we propose a KT model, Sparse Binary Representation KT\n(SBRKT), that generates new KC labels, referred to as auxiliary KCs, which can\naugment the predefined KCs to address the limitations of relying solely on\nhuman-defined KCs. These are learned through a binary vector representation,\nwhere each bit indicates the presence (one) or absence (zero) of an auxiliary\nKC. The resulting discrete representation allows these auxiliary KCs to be\nutilized in training any KT model that incorporates KCs. Unlike pre-trained\ndense embeddings, which are limited to models designed to accept such vectors,\nour discrete representations are compatible with both classical models, such as\nBayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT), and modern deep learning approaches.\n  To generate this discrete representation, SBRKT employs a binarization method\nthat learns a sparse representation, fully trainable via stochastic gradient\ndescent. Additionally, SBRKT incorporates a recurrent neural network (RNN) to\ncapture temporal dynamics and predict future student responses by effectively\ncombining the auxiliary and predefined KCs. Experimental results demonstrate\nthat SBRKT outperforms the tested baselines on several datasets and achieves\ncompetitive performance on others. Furthermore, incorporating the learned\nauxiliary KCs consistently enhances the performance of BKT across all tested\ndatasets.",

    "abstract": "Self-Admitted Technical Debt (SATD), cases where developers intentionally\nacknowledge suboptimal solutions in code through comments, poses a significant\nchallenge to software maintainability. Left unresolved, SATD can degrade code\nquality and increase maintenance costs. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have\nshown promise in tasks like code generation and program repair, their potential\nin automated SATD repayment remains underexplored.\n  In this paper, we identify three key challenges in training and evaluating\nLLMs for SATD repayment: (1) dataset representativeness and scalability, (2)\nremoval of irrelevant SATD repayments, and (3) limitations of existing\nevaluation metrics. To address the first two dataset-related challenges, we\nadopt a language-independent SATD tracing tool and design a 10-step filtering\npipeline to extract SATD repayments from repositories, resulting two\nlarge-scale datasets: 58,722 items for Python and 97,347 items for Java. To\nimprove evaluation, we introduce two diff-based metrics, BLEU-diff and\nCrystalBLEU-diff, which measure code changes rather than whole code.\nAdditionally, we propose another new metric, LEMOD, which is both interpretable\nand informative. Using our new benchmarks and evaluation metrics, we evaluate\ntwo types of automated SATD repayment methods: fine-tuning smaller models, and\nprompt engineering with five large-scale models. Our results reveal that\nfine-tuned small models achieve comparable Exact Match (EM) scores to\nprompt-based approaches but underperform on BLEU-based metrics and LEMOD.\nNotably, Gemma-2-9B leads in EM, addressing 10.1% of Python and 8.1% of Java\nSATDs, while Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct and GPT-4o-mini excel on BLEU-diff,\nCrystalBLEU-diff, and LEMOD metrics. Our work contributes a robust benchmark,\nimproved evaluation metrics, and a comprehensive evaluation of LLMs, advancing\nresearch on automated SATD repayment.",

    ],
    "abstract": "Object Referring Analysis (ORA), commonly known as referring expression\ncomprehension, requires the identification and localization of specific objects\nin an image based on natural descriptions. Unlike generic object detection, ORA\nrequires both accurate language understanding and precise visual localization,\nmaking it inherently more complex. Although recent pre-trained large visual\ngrounding detectors have achieved significant progress, they heavily rely on\nextensively labeled data and time-consuming learning. To address these, we\nintroduce a novel, training-free framework for zero-shot ORA, termed FLORA\n(Formal Language for Object Referring and Analysis). FLORA harnesses the\ninherent reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) and integrates\na formal language model - a logical framework that regulates language within\nstructured, rule-based descriptions - to provide effective zero-shot ORA. More\nspecifically, our formal language model (FLM) enables an effective,\nlogic-driven interpretation of object descriptions without necessitating any\ntraining processes. Built upon FLM-regulated LLM outputs, we further devise a\nBayesian inference framework and employ appropriate off-the-shelf interpretive\nmodels to finalize the reasoning, delivering favorable robustness against LLM\nhallucinations and compelling ORA performance in a training-free manner. In\npractice, our FLORA boosts the zero-shot performance of existing pretrained\ngrounding detectors by up to around 45%. Our comprehensive evaluation across\ndifferent challenging datasets also confirms that FLORA consistently surpasses\ncurrent state-of-the-art zero-shot methods in both detection and segmentation\ntasks associated with zero-shot ORA. We believe our probabilistic parsing and\nreasoning of the LLM outputs elevate the reliability and interpretability of\nzero-shot ORA. We shall release codes upon publication.",

    "abstract": "Recently, it has been proposed that holography imposes a universal lower\nbound on the Casimir effect for 3d BCFTs. This paper generalizes the\ndiscussions to higher dimensions. We find Einstein gravity, DGP gravity, and\nGauss-Bonnet gravity sets a universal lower bound of the strip Casimir effect\nin general dimensions. We verify the holographic bound by free theories and\n$O(N)$ models in the $\\epsilon$ expansions. We also derive the holographic\nbound of the Casimir effect for a wedge and confirm free theories obey it. It\nimplies holography sets a lower bound of the Casimir effect for general\nboundary shapes, not limited to the strip. Finally, we briefly comment on the\nimpact of mass and various generalizations and applications of our results.",

    "abstract": "This work explores the relationship between solution space and time\ncomplexity in the context of the $\\textbf{P}$ vs. $\\textbf{NP}$ problem,\nparticularly through the lens of the sliding tile puzzle and root finding\nalgorithms. We focus on the trade-off between finding a solution and verifying\nit, highlighting how understanding the structure of the solution space can\ninform the complexity of these problems. By examining the relationship between\nthe number of possible configurations and the time complexity required to\ntraverse this space we demonstrate that the minimal time to verify a solution\nis often smaller than the time required to discover it. Our results suggest\nthat the efficiency of solving $\\textbf{NP}$-complete problems is not only\ndetermined by the ability to find solutions but also by how effectively we can\nnavigate and characterize the solution space. This study contributes to the\nongoing discourse on computational complexity, particularly in understanding\nthe interplay between solution space size, algorithm design, and the inherent\nchallenges of finding versus verifying solutions.",

The standard\napproach to grow $\\alpha$-tantalum thin films on silicon involves heating the\nsubstrate, which takes several hours per deposition and prevents the\nintegration of this material with wafers containing temperature-sensitive\ncomponents. We report a detailed experimental study of an alternative growth\nmethod of $\\alpha$-tantalum on silicon, which is achieved at room temperature\nthrough the use of a niobium seed layer. Despite a substantially higher density\nof oxygen-rich grain boundaries in the films sputtered at room temperature,\nresonators made from these films are found to have state-of-the-art quality\nfactors, comparable to resonators fabricated from tantalum grown at high\ntemperature.
