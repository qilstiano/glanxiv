    "abstract": "Flight delay is a significant issue affecting air travel. The runway system,\nfrequently falling short of demand, serves as a bottleneck. As demand\nincreases, runway capacity expansion becomes imperative to mitigate congestion.\nHowever, the decision to expand runway capacity is challenging due to inherent\nuncertainties in demand forecasts. This paper presents a novel approach to\nmodeling air traffic demand growth as a jump diffusion process, incorporating\ntwo layers of uncertainty: Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) for continuous\nvariability and a Poisson process to capture the impact of crisis events, such\nas natural disasters or public health emergencies, on decision-making. We\npropose a real options model to jointly evaluate the interrelated factors of\noptimal runway capacity and investment timing under uncertainty, with\ninvestment timing linked to trigger demand. The findings suggest that increased\nuncertainty indicates more conservative decision-making. Furthermore, the\nrelationship between optimal investment timing and expansion size is complex:\nif the expansion size remains unchanged, the trigger demand decreases as the\ndemand growth rate increases; if the expansion size experiences a jump, the\ntrigger demand also exhibits a sharp rise. This work provides valuable insights\nfor airport authorities for informed capacity expansion decision-making.",

    "abstract": "Head computed tomography (CT) imaging is a widely-used imaging modality with\nmultitudes of medical indications, particularly in assessing pathology of the\nbrain, skull, and cerebrovascular system. It is commonly the first-line imaging\nin neurologic emergencies given its rapidity of image acquisition, safety,\ncost, and ubiquity. Deep learning models may facilitate detection of a wide\nrange of diseases. However, the scarcity of high-quality labels and\nannotations, particularly among less common conditions, significantly hinders\nthe development of powerful models. To address this challenge, we introduce\nFM-CT: a Foundation Model for Head CT for generalizable disease detection,\ntrained using self-supervised learning. Our approach pre-trains a deep learning\nmodel on a large, diverse dataset of 361,663 non-contrast 3D head CT scans\nwithout the need for manual annotations, enabling the model to learn robust,\ngeneralizable features. To investigate the potential of self-supervised\nlearning in head CT, we employed both discrimination with self-distillation and\nmasked image modeling, and we construct our model in 3D rather than at the\nslice level (2D) to exploit the structure of head CT scans more comprehensively\nand efficiently. The model's downstream classification performance is evaluated\nusing internal and three external datasets, encompassing both in-distribution\n(ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) data. Our results demonstrate that the\nself-supervised foundation model significantly improves performance on\ndownstream diagnostic tasks compared to models trained from scratch and\nprevious 3D CT foundation models on scarce annotated datasets. This work\nhighlights the effectiveness of self-supervised learning in medical imaging and\nsets a new benchmark for head CT image analysis in 3D, enabling broader use of\nartificial intelligence for head CT-based diagnosis.",

    "abstract": "Intelligent agents working in real-world environments must be able to learn\nabout the environment and its capabilities which enable them to take actions to\nchange to the state of the world to complete a complex multi-step task in a\nphotorealistic environment. Learning about the environment is especially\nimportant to perform various multiple-step tasks without having to redefine an\nagent's action set for different tasks or environment settings. In our work, we\naugment an existing task and motion planning framework with learned affordance\nmodels of objects in the world to enable planning and executing multi-step\ntasks using learned models. Each task can be seen as changing the current state\nof the world to a given goal state. The affordance models provide us with what\nactions are possible and how to perform those actions in any given state. A\nsymbolic planning algorithm uses this information and the starting and goal\nstate to create a feasible plan to reach the desired goal state to complete a\ngiven task. We demonstrate our approach in a virtual 3D photorealistic\nenvironment, AI2-Thor, and evaluate it on real-world tasks. Our results show\nthat our agent quickly learns how to interact with the environment and is well\nprepared to perform tasks such as \"Moving an object out of the way to reach the\ndesired location.\"",

The proposed two-dimensional barcode attack enables\nangle-dependent message selection while maintaining compatibility with\nunmodified QR readers and the 100 million US mobile users who use their phone's\nbuilt-in scanners. Unlike previous approaches that rely on nested codes,\nwatermarking, or error correction exploitation, our method achieves true\none-to-many mapping by manipulating the physical sampling process built into\nthe QR standard. By preserving critical function patterns while bifurcating\ndata modules, we create automated codes that produce different but valid\nreadings based on camera viewing angle.

    "abstract": "The design of analog circuits is a cornerstone of integrated circuit (IC)\ndevelopment, requiring the optimization of complex, interconnected\nsub-structures such as amplifiers, comparators, and buffers. Traditionally,\nthis process relies heavily on expert human knowledge to refine design\nobjectives by carefully tuning sub-components while accounting for their\ninterdependencies. Existing methods, such as Bayesian Optimization (BO), offer\na mathematically driven approach for efficiently navigating large design\nspaces. However, these methods fall short in two critical areas compared to\nhuman expertise: (i) they lack the semantic understanding of the sizing\nsolution space and its direct correlation with design objectives before\noptimization, and (ii) they fail to reuse knowledge gained from optimizing\nsimilar sub-structures across different circuits. To overcome these\nlimitations, we propose the Large Language Model-based Universal Sizing\nOptimizer (LLM-USO), which introduces a novel method for knowledge\nrepresentation to encode circuit design knowledge in a structured text format.\nThis representation enables the systematic reuse of optimization insights for\ncircuits with similar sub-structures. LLM-USO employs a hybrid framework that\nintegrates BO with large language models (LLMs) and a learning summary module.\nThis approach serves to: (i) infuse domain-specific knowledge into the BO\nprocess and (ii) facilitate knowledge transfer across circuits, mirroring the\ncognitive strategies of expert designers. Specifically, LLM-USO constructs a\nknowledge summary mechanism to distill and apply design insights from one\ncircuit to related ones. It also incorporates a knowledge summary critiquing\nmechanism to ensure the accuracy and quality of the summaries and employs\nBO-guided suggestion filtering to identify optimal design points efficiently.",

FLIP selectively samples multi-resolution patches centered on\nobjects of interest from the input. As a result, it allocates high-resolution\nprocessing to object centers while maintaining coarser peripheral context. This\noff-grid, scale-invariant design enables FLIP to outperform META's Segment\nAnything models (SAM) by large margins: With more than 1000x fewer parameters,\nFLIP-Tiny (0.51M parameters) reaches a mean IoU of 78.24% while SAM-H reaches\n75.41% IoU (641.1M parameters). FLIP-Large even achieves 80.33% mean IoU (96.6M\nparameters), still running about 6$\\times$ faster than SAM-H. We evaluate on\nsix benchmarks in total. In five established benchmarks (Hypersim, KITTI-360,\nOpenImages, COCO, LVIS) FLIP consistently outperforms SAM and various variants\nof it. In our novel ObjaScale dataset, which stress-tests scale invariance with\nobjects ranging from 0.0001% up-to 25% of the image area, we show that FLIP\nsegments even very small objects accurately, where existing models fail\nseverely. FLIP opens new possibilities for real-time, object-centric vision\napplications and offers much higher energy efficiency.

In this paper, we investigate the impact of such noise on\nreview comment generation and propose a novel approach using large language\nmodels (LLMs) to further clean these datasets. Based on an empirical study on a\nlarge-scale code review dataset, our LLM-based approach achieves 66-85%\nprecision in detecting valid comments. Using the predicted valid comments to\nfine-tune the state-of-the-art code review models (cleaned models) can generate\nreview comments that are 13.0% - 12.4% more similar to valid human-written\ncomments than the original models.

We trained two 3D\nconvolutional neural networks, Attention U-Net and SegResNet, and concatenated\nthe PET and CT volumes channel-wise as input. The performance of our custom\nloss function was evaluated against the Dice and Dice Focal Loss functions. For\nclinical significance, we considered a detected region of interest (ROI) as a\ntrue positive if at least the voxel with the maximum standardized uptake value\nfalls within the ROI. We assessed the models' performance based on the number\nof lesions in an image, tumour volume, activity, and extent of spread. The\nL1DFL outperformed the comparative loss functions by at least 13% on the test\nset. In addition, the F1 scores of the Dice Loss and the Dice Focal Loss were\nlower than that of L1DFL by at least 6% and 34%, respectively. The Dice Focal\nLoss yielded more false positives, whereas the Dice Loss was more sensitive to\nsmaller volumes and struggled to segment larger lesions accurately. They also\nexhibited network-specific variations and yielded declines in segmentation\naccuracy with increased tumour spread. Our results demonstrate the potential of\nL1DFL to yield robust segmentation of metastatic prostate cancer lesions in\nPSMA PET/CT images. The results further highlight potential complexities\narising from the variations in lesion characteristics that may influence\nautomated prostate cancer tumour detection and segmentation.

While the systems community has experimented with a plethora of new\nand adaptive eviction policies in non-OS settings (e.g., key-value stores,\nCDNs), it is very difficult to implement such policies in the page cache, due\nto the complexity of modifying kernel code.

Our framework is in the spirit of existing methods that use frequency\nmodulations in the waveforms, but we refine the approach by connecting it to\nstate-of-the-art post-Newtonian calculations of the time evolution of the\neccentricity. Using 39 numerical relativity (NR) simulations from the SXS and\nRIT catalogs, as well as waveforms obtained from the post-Newtonian\napproximation and effective-one-body (EOB) formalism, we show that our\nframework provides eccentricity estimates that connect smoothly into the\nrelativistic regime (even up to $\\sim 2M$ before merger).

The \"textbook\" example of an\nepisodic dust producing WR binary, WR140 (HD193793), provides us with an ideal\nlaboratory for investigating the dust physics and kinematics in an extreme\nenvironment. This study is among the first to utilize two separate JWST\nobservations, from Cycle 1 ERS (July 2022) and Cycle 2 (Sept. 2023), to measure\nWR140's dust kinematics and confirm its morphology. To measure the proper\nmotions and projected velocities of the dust shells, we performed a novel PSF\nsubtraction to reduce the effects of the bright diffraction spikes and\ncarefully aligned the Cycle 2 to the Cycle 1 images. At 7.7 $\\mu$m, through the\nbright feature common to 16 dust shells (C1), we find an average dust shell\nproper motion of $390\\pm29$ mas yr$^{-1}$, which equates to a projected\nvelocity of $2714\\pm188$ km s$^{-1}$ at a distance of 1.64 kpc. Our measured\nspeeds are constant across all visible shells and consistent with previously\nreported dust expansion velocities. Our observations not only prove that these\ndusty shells are astrophysical (i.e., not associated with any PSF artifact) and\noriginate from WR140, but also confirm the \"clumpy\" morphology of the dust\nshells, in which identifiable substructures within certain shells persist for\nat least 14 months from one cycle to the next. These results support the\nhypothesis that clumping in the wind collision region is required for dust\nproduction in WR binaries.",

Probabilistic Latent Encryption Mapping presents an\nalternative detection framework that models ransomware-induced encryption\nbehaviors through statistical representations of entropy deviations and\nprobabilistic dependencies in execution traces. Unlike conventional approaches\nthat depend on explicit bytecode analysis or predefined cryptographic function\ncall monitoring, probabilistic inference techniques classify encryption\nanomalies based on their underlying statistical characteristics, ensuring\ngreater adaptability to polymorphic attack strategies. Evaluations demonstrate\nthat entropy-driven classification reduces false positive rates while\nmaintaining high detection accuracy across diverse ransomware families and\nencryption methodologies. Experimental results further highlight the\nframework's ability to differentiate between benign encryption workflows and\nadversarial cryptographic manipulations, ensuring that classification\nperformance remains effective across cloud-based and localized execution\nenvironments. Benchmark comparisons illustrate that probabilistic modeling\nexhibits advantages over heuristic and machine learning-based detection\napproaches, particularly in handling previously unseen encryption techniques\nand adversarial obfuscation strategies. Computational efficiency analysis\nconfirms that detection latency remains within operational feasibility\nconstraints, reinforcing the viability of probabilistic encryption\nclassification for real-time security infrastructures. The ability to\nsystematically infer encryption-induced deviations without requiring static\nattack signatures strengthens detection robustness against adversarial evasion\ntechniques.",

    "abstract": "Designing novel materials for impact applications and predicting material\nbehavior using data-driven techniques require extensive datasets, which can be\nchallenging to obtain through conventional experimental methods. While high\nthroughput characterization is feasible at the sample micro and nanoscale,\nthere remains a critical need for an experimental tool capable of facilitating\nhigh-throughput measurements at the macroscale. This paper presents the design\nand development of a fully automated split Hopkinson pressure bar (SHPB) with\nfull-field diagnostics for performing dynamic compression experiments on\ndifferent materials. The automated SHPB experiments consist of four main\ncomponents: 1) striker launch and retrieval system, 2) bar repositioning\nmechanism, 3) automated sample placement system, and 4) diagnostics. Each of\nthese systems employs various electromechanical devices and actuators\nprogrammed to work collaboratively to automate the SHPB experimental setup. A\ndata analysis tool has been developed to automate the post-processing of the\ndata obtained from the setup. The setup also incorporates automated high-speed\nimaging, enabling full-field strain measurement capabilities. To benchmark the\nsetup, fully automated dynamic compression experiments were conducted on 45\nCopper 101 samples and 20 3D-printed resin samples. The stress-strain curve was\nextracted from the raw data using the automated data analysis tool. The\nefficiency of the data analysis tool is validated by comparing the data with\nexisting data analysis tools for SHPB. The stress-strain response obtained from\nthe copper experiments aligned well with existing data on copper. Furthermore,\nthe full-field strain measurements in experiments show strain values comparable\nto those of the strain gauge measurements. This advancement has enabled dynamic\ncompression experiments on materials at a rate of 60 samples per hour.",

However, these\ndevelopments have mainly benefited a small number of high-resource languages\nsuch as English. The majority of languages still face significant challenges\ndue to the scarcity of training data and computational resources. To address\nthis issue, this thesis focuses on cross-lingual transfer learning, a research\narea aimed at leveraging data and models from high-resource languages to\nimprove NLP performance for low-resource languages. Specifically, we focus on\nSequence Labeling tasks such as Named Entity Recognition, Opinion Target\nExtraction, and Argument Mining.\n  The research is structured around three main objectives: (1) advancing\ndata-based cross-lingual transfer learning methods through improved translation\nand annotation projection techniques, (2) developing enhanced model-based\ntransfer learning approaches utilizing state-of-the-art multilingual models,\nand (3) applying these methods to real-world problems while creating\nopen-source resources that facilitate future research in low-resource NLP.\n  More specifically, this thesis presents a new method to improve data-based\ntransfer with T-Projection, a state-of-the-art annotation projection method\nthat leverages text-to-text multilingual models and machine translation\nsystems. T-Projection significantly outperforms previous annotation projection\nmethods by a wide margin.

    "abstract": "Foundational models have emerged as a powerful paradigm in deep learning\nfield, leveraging their capacity to learn robust representations from\nlarge-scale datasets and effectively to diverse downstream applications such as\nclassification. In this paper, we present Astromer 2 a foundational model\nspecifically designed for extracting light curve embeddings. We introduce\nAstromer 2 as an enhanced iteration of our self-supervised model for light\ncurve analysis. This paper highlights the advantages of its pre-trained\nembeddings, compares its performance with that of its predecessor, Astromer 1,\nand provides a detailed empirical analysis of its capabilities, offering deeper\ninsights into the model's representations. Astromer 2 is pretrained on 1.5\nmillion single-band light curves from the MACHO survey using a self-supervised\nlearning task that predicts randomly masked observations within sequences.\nFine-tuning on a smaller labeled dataset allows us to assess its performance in\nclassification tasks. The quality of the embeddings is measured by the F1 score\nof an MLP classifier trained on Astromer-generated embeddings. Our results\ndemonstrate that Astromer 2 significantly outperforms Astromer 1 across all\nevaluated scenarios, including limited datasets of 20, 100, and 500 samples per\nclass. The use of weighted per-sample embeddings, which integrate intermediate\nrepresentations from Astromer's attention blocks, is particularly impactful.\nNotably, Astromer 2 achieves a 15% improvement in F1 score on the ATLAS dataset\ncompared to prior models, showcasing robust generalization to new datasets.\nThis enhanced performance, especially with minimal labeled data, underscores\nthe potential of Astromer 2 for more efficient and scalable light curve\nanalysis.",

However, flaky test detection and classification is challenging\ndue to the variability in test behavior, which can depend on environmental\nconditions and subtle code interactions. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer\npromising approaches to address this challenge, with fine-tuning and few-shot\nlearning (FSL) emerging as viable techniques. With enough data fine-tuning a\npre-trained LLM can achieve high accuracy, making it suitable for organizations\nwith more resources.

The integral formulation for modeling surface\ntension forces is known to be consistent and conservative, and to be a natural\nchoice for the simulation of flows driven by surface tension gradients along\nthe interface. This formulation was introduced by Popinet and Zaleski (1999)\nfor a front-tracking method and was later extended to level set methods by\nAl-Saud et al. (2018). In this work, we extend the integral formulation to a\nvolume of fluid (VOF) method for capturing the interface. In fact, we propose\nthree different schemes distinguished by the way we calculate the geometric\nproperties of the interface, namely curvature, tangent vector and surface\nfraction from VOF representation. We propose a coupled level set volume of\nfluid (CLSVOF) method in which we use a signed distance function coupled with\nVOF, a height function (HF) method in which we use the height functions\ncalculated from VOF, and a height function to distance (HF2D) method in which\nwe use a sign-distance function calculated from height functions. For\nvalidation, these methods are rigorously tested for several problems with\nconstant as well as varying surface tension. It is found that from an accuracy\nstandpoint, CLSVOF has the least numerical oscillations followed by HF2D and\nthen HF.

With large language models (LLMs) crossing critical\nreliability thresholds for a growing slate of capabilities, there is an\nincreasing effort to decompose systems into sets of LLM-based agents, each of\nwhom can be delegated sub-tasks. However, this decomposition (even when\nautomated) is often intuitive, e.g., based on how a human might assign roles to\nmembers of a human team. How close are these role decompositions to optimal?\nThis position paper argues that asymptotic analysis with LLM primitives is\nneeded to reason about the efficiency of such decomposed systems, and that\ninsights from such analysis will unlock opportunities for scaling them. By\ntreating the LLM forward pass as the atomic unit of computational cost, one can\nseparate out the (often opaque) inner workings of a particular LLM from the\ninherent efficiency of how a set of LLMs are orchestrated to solve hard\nproblems. In other words, if we want to scale the deployment of LLMs to the\nlimit, instead of anthropomorphizing LLMs, asymptotic analysis with LLM\nprimitives should be used to reason about and develop more powerful\ndecompositions of large problems into LLM agents.",

In this paper, we aim to fill the gap and propose to\nstudy the more general setting when the robust risk is only partially\nidentifiable. In particular, we introduce the worst-case robust risk as a new\nmeasure of robustness that is always well-defined regardless of\nidentifiability.

First, we show that existing\nrobustness methods are provably suboptimal in the partially identifiable case.\nWe then evaluate these methods and the minimizer of the (empirical) worst-case\nrobust risk on real-world gene expression data and find a similar trend: the\ntest error of existing robustness methods grows increasingly suboptimal as the\nfraction of data from unseen environments increases, whereas accounting for\npartial identifiability allows for better generalization.",

Meanwhile, privacy attacks aim to expose\nreal and worrying privacy risks associated with existing data release processes\nbut often face criticism for being unrealistic. Moreover, the literature on\nattacks generally does not identify what properties are necessary to defend\nagainst them.\n  We address the gap between these approaches by introducing demographic\ncoherence, a condition inspired by privacy attacks that we argue is necessary\nfor data privacy.

Our framework focuses on confidence rated\npredictors, which can in turn be distilled from almost any data-informed\nprocess. Thus, we capture privacy threats that exist even when no attack is\nexplicitly being carried out. Our framework not only provides a condition with\nrespect to which data release algorithms can be analysed but suggests natural\nexperimental evaluation methodologies that could be used to build practical\nintuition and make tangible assessment of risks. Finally, we argue that\ndemographic coherence is weaker than differential privacy: we prove that every\ndifferentially private data release is also demographically coherent, and that\nthere are demographically coherent algorithms which are not differentially\nprivate.",

    "abstract": "Robot learning requires a considerable amount of high-quality data to realize\nthe promise of generalization. However, large data sets are costly to collect\nin the real world. Physics simulators can cheaply generate vast data sets with\nbroad coverage over states, actions, and environments. However, physics engines\nare fundamentally misspecified approximations to reality. This makes direct\nzero-shot transfer from simulation to reality challenging, especially in tasks\nwhere precise and force-sensitive manipulation is necessary. Thus, fine-tuning\nthese policies with small real-world data sets is an appealing pathway for\nscaling robot learning. However, current reinforcement learning fine-tuning\nframeworks leverage general, unstructured exploration strategies which are too\ninefficient to make real-world adaptation practical. This paper introduces the\nSimulation-Guided Fine-tuning (SGFT) framework, which demonstrates how to\nextract structural priors from physics simulators to substantially accelerate\nreal-world adaptation. Specifically, our approach uses a value function learned\nin simulation to guide real-world exploration. We demonstrate this approach\nacross five real-world dexterous manipulation tasks where zero-shot sim-to-real\ntransfer fails. We further demonstrate our framework substantially outperforms\nbaseline fine-tuning methods, requiring up to an order of magnitude fewer\nreal-world samples and succeeding at difficult tasks where prior approaches\nfail entirely. Last but not least, we provide theoretical justification for\nthis new paradigm which underpins how SGFT can rapidly learn high-performance\npolicies in the face of large sim-to-real dynamics gaps.

This work targets processes within liquid-metal components\nof the reactor's breeding blankets. Order-of-magnitude analysis and\n{exploratory} numerical simulations are performed to understand the response of\nliquid metal to a rapidly changing magnetic field and to evaluate the accuracy\nof commonly used simplifying model assumptions. The response is found to\nconsist of two stages: an initial brief stage ($\\sim 1$ ms) characterized by a\nrapid increase in the induced currents, forces, and fluid velocity; and a\nsubsequent stage, which is triggered by the growing velocity of the metal and\nmarked by reversals of Lorentz force, and oscillations and decreases in the\namplitude of the induced fields. The transition to the second stage sets the\nupper limit of the velocity ($\\sim 0.5$ m/s in our tests), to which an\ninitially quiescent metal can be accelerated during the event. The simulations\nindicate that many widely used model assumptions, such as the negligible role\nof Joule dissipation in the heat balance and the constancy of physical property\ncoefficients, remain valid during the response. However, the assumption of\nliquid metal incompressibility is found to be questionable due to the potential\nsignificant effects of pressure waves.",

    "abstract": "Controllable video generation remains a significant challenge, despite recent\nadvances in generating high-quality and consistent videos. Most existing\nmethods for controlling video generation treat the video as a whole, neglecting\nintricate fine-grained spatiotemporal relationships, which limits both control\nprecision and efficiency. In this paper, we propose Controllable Video\nGenerative Adversarial Networks (CoVoGAN) to disentangle the video concepts,\nthus facilitating efficient and independent control over individual concepts.\nSpecifically, following the minimal change principle, we first disentangle\nstatic and dynamic latent variables. We then leverage the sufficient change\nproperty to achieve component-wise identifiability of dynamic latent variables,\nenabling disentangled control of video generation. To establish the theoretical\nfoundation, we provide a rigorous analysis demonstrating the identifiability of\nour approach. Building on these theoretical insights, we design a Temporal\nTransition Module to disentangle latent dynamics. To enforce the minimal change\nprinciple and sufficient change property, we minimize the dimensionality of\nlatent dynamic variables and impose temporal conditional independence. To\nvalidate our approach, we integrate this module as a plug-in for GANs.\nExtensive qualitative and quantitative experiments on various video generation\nbenchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly improves generation\nquality and controllability across diverse real-world scenarios.",

The cardinality constraint is a generalization of the all different\nconstraint that specifies the number of times each value must be taken by a\ngiven set of variables in a solution. The version with costs introduces an\nassignment cost and bounds the total sum of assignment costs.

Unlike traditional Kalman\nfilters that rely on explicit, linear models and centralized data fusion, the\nNDKF leverages neural networks to learn both the system dynamics and\nmeasurement functions directly from data. Each sensor node performs local\nprediction and update steps using these learned models and exchanges only\ncompact summary information with its neighbors via a consensus-based fusion\nprocess, which reduces communication overhead and eliminates a single point of\nfailure. Our theoretical convergence analysis establishes sufficient conditions\nunder which the local linearizations of the neural models guarantee overall\nfilter stability and provides a solid foundation for the proposed approach.\nSimulation studies on a 2D system with four partially observing nodes\ndemonstrate that the NDKF significantly outperforms a distributed Extended\nKalman Filter.

These two\nmodes have been conjectured to be supersymmetric (SUSY) partners in the\nlong-wavelength limit. Previous studies on these neutral excitations of the Pf\nstate have shown evidence in favor of SUSY in the vicinity of the second Landau\nlevel (SLL) Coulomb interaction. Inspired by that, using the framework of\nparton theory, we test the SUSY conjecture for a state that lies in the same\nuniversality class as the particle-hole conjugate of the Pf, namely the anti-Pf\n(aPf) state, by constructing explicit wave functions for its magnetoroton and\nneutral fermion excitations and evaluating them for very large system sizes. As\nwith the previous studies on the Pf state, we find that the long-wavelength\ngaps of the neutral modes of the parton state belonging to the same topological\nclass as the aPf are close to each other for the SLL Coulomb interaction.\nFurthermore, using the parton wave functions, we compute the dispersion of\nvarious neutral collective excitations, including the magnetoroton, neutral\nfermion, and parton-excitons, for several notable non-Abelian and Abelian\nstates. Finally, we propose a parton-exciton ansatz for the gapped neutral\nexcitation of the composite fermion Fermi liquid at quarter filling and compute\nits dispersion for the Coulomb interaction in the lowest Landau level.",

To\nmitigate this challenge, we propose the Pseudo Physics-Informed Neural Operator\n(PPI-NO) framework.

This\nsurrogate system is coupled with a neural operator model, using an alternating\nupdate and learning process to iteratively enhance the model's predictive\npower. While the physics derived via PPI-NO may not mirror the ground-truth\nunderlying physical laws -- hence the term ``pseudo physics'' -- this approach\nsignificantly improves the accuracy of standard operator learning models in\ndata-scarce scenarios, which is evidenced by extensive evaluations across five\nbenchmark tasks and a fatigue modeling application.",

    "abstract": "Visible watermarks pose significant challenges for image restoration\ntechniques, especially when the target background is unknown. Toward this end,\nwe present MorphoMod, a novel method for automated visible watermark removal\nthat operates in a blind setting -- without requiring target images. Unlike\nexisting methods, MorphoMod effectively removes opaque and transparent\nwatermarks while preserving semantic content, making it well-suited for\nreal-world applications. Evaluations on benchmark datasets, including the\nColored Large-scale Watermark Dataset (CLWD), LOGO-series, and the newly\nintroduced Alpha1 datasets, demonstrate that MorphoMod achieves up to a 50.8%\nimprovement in watermark removal effectiveness compared to state-of-the-art\nmethods. Ablation studies highlight the impact of prompts used for inpainting,\npre-removal filling strategies, and inpainting model performance on watermark\nremoval. Additionally, a case study on steganographic disorientation reveals\nbroader applications for watermark removal in disrupting high-level hidden\nmessages. MorphoMod offers a robust, adaptable solution for watermark removal\nand opens avenues for further advancements in image restoration and adversarial\nmanipulation.",

Similarly, TabPFN, a\nrecent non-LLM transformer pretrained on numerous tables for in-context\nlearning, has demonstrated excellent performance for dataset sizes up to a\nthousand samples. In contrast, gradient-boosted decision trees (GBDTs) are\ntypically trained from scratch on each dataset without benefiting from\npretraining data and must learn the relationships between columns from their\nentries alone since they lack natural language understanding.

In this paper, we propose a simple and lightweight\napproach for fusing large language models and TabPFN with gradient-boosted\ndecision trees, which allows scalable GBDTs to benefit from the natural\nlanguage capabilities and pretraining of transformers.

In the second RLHF stage,\na well-known challenge is reward hacking, where the LM over-optimizes the\nreward model. Such phenomenon is in line with Goodhart's law and can lead to\ndegraded performance on the true objective. In this paper, we investigate\nwhether a similar phenomenon, that we call teacher hacking, can occur during\nknowledge distillation. This could arise because the teacher LM is itself an\nimperfect approximation of the true distribution. To study this, we propose a\ncontrolled experimental setup involving: (i) an oracle LM representing the\nground-truth distribution, (ii) a teacher LM distilled from the oracle, and\n(iii) a student LM distilled from the teacher. Our experiments reveal the\nfollowing insights. When using a fixed offline dataset for distillation,\nteacher hacking occurs; moreover, we can detect it by observing when the\noptimization process deviates from polynomial convergence laws. In contrast,\nemploying online data generation techniques effectively mitigates teacher\nhacking. More precisely, we identify data diversity as the key factor in\npreventing hacking. Overall, our findings provide a deeper understanding of the\nbenefits and limitations of distillation for building robust and efficient LMs.",

Firstly, we argue that the algebraic structure that underlies\nthe large N limit of the chiral gauge theory is a partial permutation Frobenius\nalgebra of observables which codes covering maps of all degrees simultaneously.\nSecondly, we exploit the Gromov-Witten/Hurwitz correspondence to interpret\nchiral Yang-Mills theory as a finite deformation of a Gromov-Witten theory by\nan area-dependent transposition interaction and an operator that codes a\ncompactification of Hurwitz space.

Our goal is to identify and\ncharacterize new stellar bow shocks around O and Be runaway stars in the\ninfrared (IR), and to study their possible radio emission and nature. Our input\ndata is a catalog of O and Be runaways compiled using Gaia DR3. We used WISE IR\nimages to search for bow shocks around these runaways, Gaia DR3 data to\ndetermine the actual motion of the runaway stars corrected for interstellar\nmedium (ISM) motion caused by Galactic rotation, and archival radio data to\nsearch for emission signatures. We finally explored the radio detectability of\nthese sources under thermal and nonthermal scenarios. We found 9 new stellar\nbow shock candidates, 3 new bubble candidates, and 1 intermediate structure\ncandidate. One of them is an in situ bow shock candidate. We also found 17\nalready known bow shocks in our sample, though we discarded one, and 62\nmiscellaneous sources showing some IR emission around the runaways. We\ngeometrically characterized the sources in IR using the WISE-4 band and\nestimated the ISM density at the bow shock positions, obtaining median values\nof ~6 and ~4 cm$^{-3}$ using 2D and 3D peculiar velocities. Most of the new\ndiscovered bow shocks come from new runaway discoveries. Within our samples we\nfound that ~24% of the O-type runaway stars show bow shocks, while this\ndecreases to ~3% for Be-type runaway stars. Two bow shocks present radio\nemission but not as clear counterparts, and two others show hints of radio\nemission. The physical scenarios indicate that two sources could still be\ncompatible with nonthermal radio emission. The new sample of O and Be runaway\nstars allowed us to discover both new stellar bow shocks and bubbles. Their\ngeometrical characterization can be used to assess the physical scenario of the\nradio emission. (Abridged)",

    "abstract": "We present a neural radiance field (NeRF) based large-scale reconstruction\nsystem that fuses lidar and vision data to generate high-quality\nreconstructions that are geometrically accurate and capture photorealistic\ntexture. Our system adopts the state-of-the-art NeRF representation to\nincorporate lidar. Adding lidar data adds strong geometric constraints on the\ndepth and surface normals, which is particularly useful when modelling uniform\ntexture surfaces which contain ambiguous visual reconstruction cues. A key\ncontribution of this work is a novel method to quantify the epistemic\nuncertainty of the lidar-visual NeRF reconstruction by estimating the spatial\nvariance of each point location in the radiance field given the sensor\nobservations from the cameras and lidar. This provides a principled approach to\nevaluate the contribution of each sensor modality to the final reconstruction.\nIn this way, reconstructions that are uncertain (due to e.g. uniform visual\ntexture, limited observation viewpoints, or little lidar coverage) can be\nidentified and removed. Our system is integrated with a real-time lidar SLAM\nsystem which is used to bootstrap a Structure-from-Motion (SfM) reconstruction\nprocedure. It also helps to properly constrain the overall metric scale which\nis essential for the lidar depth loss. The refined SLAM trajectory can then be\ndivided into submaps using Spectral Clustering to group sets of co-visible\nimages together. This submapping approach is more suitable for visual\nreconstruction than distance-based partitioning. Our uncertainty estimation is\nparticularly effective when merging submaps as their boundaries often contain\nartefacts due to limited observations. We demonstrate the reconstruction system\nusing a multi-camera, lidar sensor suite in experiments involving both\nrobot-mounted and handheld scanning. Our test datasets cover a total area of\nmore than 20,000 square metres.",

Proximity to a massive galaxy appears to be more important in\ndetermining whether a dwarf is red, rather than simply its distance from nodes\nand filaments or the mean density of its local environment. Interestingly,\naround half of the red dwarfs reside outside the virial radii of massive\ngalaxies and around a third of those also inhabit regions in the lower 50 per\ncent in density percentile (i.e. regions of very low ambient density).

Within the large volume regime,\nwe analyze in detail the moduli dependence of these semi-classical\ncontributions and explore their implications for the black hole entropy. As a\nbyproduct, we show that the entropy captures, in a rather intricate way, the\ntransition between four- and five-dimensional dual EFT descriptions. In fact,\nthe expansion parameter $\\alpha$ controlling the relevant asymptotic series can\nbe related to the ratio of the black hole horizon and the Kaluza-Klein scale,\ngiven here by the inverse D0-brane mass. Furthermore, we are able to resum the\nseries into a well-behaved convergent expression for all values of $\\alpha$.\nThis demonstrates, in turn, that (stable) black holes can, indeed, probe scales\nbesides the quantum gravity cutoff. More precisely, by examining two\nrepresentative BPS systems -- the D0-D2-D4 and D2-D6 black hole solutions -- we\nexplicitly illustrate how highly non-local (perturbative) quantum effects\nresolve the divergences, ultimately leading to a well-defined entropy function.\nAdditionally, in certain cases, we show that one can take a suitable\ndecompactification limit to 5d and verify that the corrected entropy function\nreproduces the exact microstate counting of the underlying five-dimensional\nblack string. Our results also clarify the role of non-perturbative quantum\ncorrections, which, remarkably, do not modify any of our prior conclusions.",

Yet, the basic features of this phenomenon have never\nbeen explained by known physics. The main problem is the source which could\npower the dynamics of the BL. We advocate an idea that the dark matter (DM) in\nform of the axion quark nuggets (AQN) made of standard model quarks and gluons\n(similar to the old idea of the Witten's strangelets) could internally generate\nthe required power. The AQN model was invented long ago without any relation to\nthe BL physics. It was invented with a single motivation to explain the\nobserved similarity $\\Omega_{\\rm DM}\\sim \\Omega_{\\rm visible}$ between visible\nand DM components. This relation represents a very generic feature of this\nframework, not sensitive to any parameters of the construction. However, with\nthe same set of parameters being fixed long ago this model is capable to\naddress the key elements of the BL phenomenology, including the source of the\nenergy powering the BL events.\n  In particular, we argue that the visible size of BL, its typical life time,\nthe frequency of appearance, etc are all consistent with suggested proposal\nwhen BL represents a profound manifestation of the DM physics represented by\nthe AQN objects. We also argue that some of the Unidentified Aerial Phenomena\n(UAP) might be closely related to BL events, and therefore also represent\nprofound manifestations of the DM physics within AQN framework.

Intuitively, Lieb-Robinson bounds state that with local or\nexponentially decaying interactions, the correlation that can be built up\nbetween two sites separated by distance $r$ after a time $t$ decays as\n$\\exp(vt-r)$, where $v$ is the emergent Lieb-Robinson velocity. In many\nproblems, it is important to also capture how much of an operator grows to act\non $r^d$ sites in $d$ spatial dimensions. Perturbation theory and cluster\nexpansion methods suggest that at short times, these volume-filling operators\nare suppressed as $\\exp(-r^d)$ at short times. We confirm this intuition,\nshowing that for $r > vt$, the volume-filling operator is suppressed by\n$\\exp(-(r-vt)^d/(vt)^{d-1})$. This closes a conceptual and practical gap\nbetween the cluster expansion and the Lieb-Robinson bound. We then present two\nvery different applications of this new bound. Firstly, we obtain improved\nbounds on the classical computational resources necessary to simulate many-body\ndynamics with error tolerance $\\epsilon$ for any finite time $t$: as $\\epsilon$\nbecomes sufficiently small, only $\\epsilon^{-O(t^{d-1})}$ resources are needed.\nA protocol that likely saturates this bound is given.

In this paper, we analyze both numerical\nsimulations of disk galaxies and observational data to study the effect of\nbar-spiral physical overlap on stellar radial migration and star formation in\nthe bar vicinity, as a function of time and galactic azimuth. We study three\ndifferent numerical models, two of which are in a cosmological context, as well\nas APOGEE DR17 data and the WISE catalog of Galactic HII regions. We find that\nperiodic boosts in stellar radial migration occur when the bar and spiral\nstructure overlap. This mechanism causes net inward migration along the bar\nleading side, while stars along the bar trailling side and minor axis are\nshifted outward. The signature of bar-spiral induced migration is seen between\nthe bar's inner Lindbald resonance and well outside its corotation, beyond\nwhich other drivers take over. We also find that, in agreement with\nsimulations, APOGEE DR17 stars born at the bar vicinity (mostly metal-rich) can\nmigrate out to the solar radius while remaining on cold orbits. For the Milky\nWay, 13% of stars in the solar vicinity were born inside the bar, compared to\n5-20% in the simulations. Bar-spiral reconnections also result in periodic\nstarbursts at the bar ends with an enhancement of up to a factor of 4,\ndepending on the strength of the spiral structure. Similarly to the migration\nbursts, these do not always happen simultaneously at the two sides of the bar,\nhinting at the importance of odd spiral modes.

We derive the timescales for the\nonset of spectral correlations (ramp) and for the saturation (plateau) of the\nspectral form factor. Unexpectedly, we find that in the nonergodic phase, these\ntimescales decrease as the bandwidth of the matrices is reduced. We also show\nthat the high-frequency behavior of the power spectrum of energy fluctuations\ncan distinguish between the nonergodic and ergodic phases of the banded random\nmatrices.",

For a detailed comparison with observations, and to provide theories\nfor missing observables, we need to model the Milky Way as closely as possible.\nHowever, details of the Galactic structure are not fully defined by\nobservations, raising the need for more generalized models. With the Rhea\nsimulations we present a set of Milky Way like simulations, containing detailed\nphysics of the interstellar medium, as well as star formation and stellar\nfeedback. We conduct two simulations that differ in the gravitational\npotential: one fitted to several structural details derived from observations,\nthe other just reproducing the most basic quantities. We find little difference\nin the overall morphology except for the bar region, which funnels gas towards\nthe Galactic inner region and therefore prevents quenching in the center.\nDespite differences with galacto-centric radius, the global star formation rate\nis almost identical in both setups. A spiral arm potential does not influence\nproperties of groups of formed stars. A bar potential, however, lowers size and\nformation time of those groups. We therefore conclude for a spiral arm\npotential to have little influence on star formation in the Galaxy, except for\nproducing long-lived spiral structures instead of transient ones.

Our\nkey aim is to study the physical mechanisms that can explain the unexpected\nabundance of bright galaxies at $z \\geq 11$, as well as their metal enrichment\nand spectral properties. We also use recent data to determine the key sources\nof reionisation. To do so, we implement cold gas fractions and star formation\nefficiencies derived from the SPHINX20 high-resolution radiation-hydrodynamics\nsimulation into DELPHI, a semi-analytic model that tracks the assembly of dark\nmatter halos and their baryonic components from $z \\sim 4.5-40$.

Our\nkey findings are: (i) both the eIMF and eSFE models can explain the abundance\nof bright galaxies at $z \\geq 11$; (ii) dust attenuation plays an important\nrole for the bright-end of the UV LF at $z \\leq 11$; (iii) the mass-metallicity\nrelation is in place as early as $z \\sim 17$ in all models although its slope\nis model-dependent; (iv) within the spread of both models and observations, all\nof our models are in good agreement with current estimates of $\\beta$ slopes at\n$z \\sim 5-17$ and Balmer break strengths at $z \\sim 6-10$; (v) in the eIMF\nmodel, galaxies at $z\\geq12$ or with $\\rm{M_{UV}}\\geq-18$ show values of\n$\\xi_{\\rm{ion}} \\sim 10^{25.55}~{\\rm [Hz~erg^{-1}]}$, twice larger than in\nother models; (vi) star formation in galaxies below $10^{9}\\rm{M_{\\odot}}$ is\nthe key driver of reionisation, providing the bulk ($\\sim 85\\%$) of ionising\nphotons down to its midpoint at $z \\sim 7$.",

As part of The Binarity at LOw Metallicity (BLOeM) campaign in the\nSmall Magellanic Cloud we present a multi-epoch spectroscopic survey of 128\nsupergiant stars of spectral type B5--F5, which roughly correspond to initial\nmasses in the range 6 to 30 solar masses. The observed binary fraction for the\nB5-9 supergiants is 25+/-6 % (10+/-4 %) and 5+/-2 % (0 %) for the A-F stars,\nusing a radial velocity (RV) variability threshold of 5 kms (10 kms) as a\ncriterion for binarity. Accounting for observational biases we find an\nintrinsic multiplicity fraction of less than 18% for the B5-9 stars and\n8$^{+9}_{-7}$% for the AF stars, for the orbital periods up to 10$^{3.5}$day\nand mass-ratios (q) in the range 0.1 < q < 1. The large stellar radii of these\nsupergiant stars prevent short orbital periods but we demonstrate that this\neffect alone cannot explain our results. We assess the spectra and RV time\nseries of the detected binary systems and find that only a small fraction\ndisplay convincing solutions. We conclude that the multiplicity fractions are\ncompromised by intrinsic stellar variability such that the true multiplicity\nfraction may be significantly smaller. Our main conclusions from comparing the\nmultiplicity properties of the B5-9 and AF supergiants to that of their less\nevolved counterparts is that such stars cannot be explained by a direct\nevolution from the main sequence. Furthermore, by comparing their multiplicity\nproperties to red supergiant stars we conclude that the AF supergiant stars are\nneither progenitors nor descendants of red supergiants.",

We then run the purely geometrical\nAP test on these stacks, showing that a SKA-like experiment will be able to\nconstrain the product of the angular-diameter distance $D_{\\text{A}}$ and\nHubble parameter $H$ at reionization redshifts with $\\sim 2\\%$ precision,\nrobustly to astrophysical and cosmological uncertainties within the models\ntested here.

We explore how the choice of interaction affects the\nstrength of these peaks, with short-ranged interactions pushing the graviton\nmode far into the continuum of excitations, where it can be significantly\nscattered due to the increased density of states. We also analytically\ninvestigate the short lifetime of the graviton mode. In lattice systems,\ncontinuous rotational symmetry is broken, leading to highly anisotropic gapped\nexcitations that mix different angular momentum or ``spins''. This is despite\nthe surprising emergence of a ``guiding center\" continuous rotational symmetry\nin the ground state, which is shared by the graviton mode. Consequently, the\ngraviton mode in Chern bands can be strongly scattered by the anisotropic\ngapped excitations. However, the emergent rotational symmetry implies that\ngravitons can be robust in principle, and we propose experimental tuning\nstrategies to lower the graviton mode energy below the continuum.

    "abstract": "Rapidly rotating classical OBe stars have been proposed as the products of\nbinary interactions, and the fraction of Be stars with compact companions\nimplies that at least some are. However, to constrain the interaction physics\nspinning up the OBe stars, a large sample of homogeneously analysed OBe stars\nwith well-determined binary characteristics and orbital parameters are\nrequired. We investigate the multiplicity properties of a sample of 18 Oe, 62\nBe, and two Of?p stars observed within the BLOeM survey in the Small Magellanic\nCloud. We analyse the first nine epochs of spectroscopic observations obtained\nover approximately three months in 2023. Radial velocities (RVs) of all stars\nare measured. Applying commonly-used binarity criteria we classify objects as\nbinaries, binary candidates, and apparently single (RV stable) objects. We\nfurther inspect the spectra for double-lined spectroscopic binaries and\ncross-match with catalogues of X-ray sources and photometric binaries. We\nclassify 14 OBe stars as binaries, and an additional 11 as binary candidates.\nThe two Of?p stars are apparently single. Two more objects are most likely\ncurrently interacting binaries. Without those, the observed binary fraction for\nthe OBe sample (78 stars) is f_OBe_obs=0.18+/-0.04 (f_obs_cand=0.32+/-0.05\nincluding candidates). This fraction is less than half of that measured for OB\nstars in BLOeM. Combined with the lower fraction of SB2s, this suggests that\nOBe stars have indeed fundamentally different binary properties than OB stars.\nWe find no evidence for OBe binaries with massive compact companions, in\ncontrast to expectations from binary population synthesis. Our results support\nthe binary scenario as an important formation channel for OBe stars, as\npost-interaction binaries may have been disrupted or the stripped companions of\nOBe stars are harder to detect.",

    "abstract": "Radial migration is an important dynamical effect that has reshaped the\nGalactic disc, but its origin has yet to be elucidated. In this work, we\npresent evidence that resonant dragging by the corotation of a decelerating bar\ncould be the main driver of radial migration in the Milky Way disc. Using a\ntest particle simulation, we demonstrate this scenario explains the two\ndistinct age-metallicity sequences observed in the solar vicinity: the\nplateauing upper sequence is interpreted as stars dragged outwards by the\nexpanding corotation of the decelerating bar and the steeper lower sequence as\nstars formed locally around the solar circle. The upper migrated sequence\ndominates at guiding radii around the current corotation radius of the bar,\n$R\\sim7\\,\\mathrm{kpc}$, but rapidly dies away beyond this where the mechanism\ncannot operate. This behaviour naturally explains the radial dependence of the\n$\\mathrm{[\\alpha/Fe]}$-bimodality, in particular the truncation of the\nhigh-$\\mathrm{[\\alpha/Fe]}$ disc beyond the solar circle. Under our proposed\nradial migration scenario, we constrain the Milky Way bar's pattern speed\nevolution using the age-metallicity distribution of stars currently trapped at\ncorotation. We find the bar likely formed with an initial pattern speed of\n$60-100$ km s$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-1}$ and began decelerating $6-8$ Gyr ago at a rate\n$-\\dot{\\Omega}/\\Omega^2\\sim0.0025-0.0040$ (where the quoted ranges include\nsystematic uncertainties).",

However, even if a given\nsimulation reproduces the integrated properties of galaxies well, it may not\nreproduce the detailed structures of individual galaxies. Comparisons between\nthe 2D light distributions of simulated and observed galaxies -- particularly\nin the dwarf regime, where key processes like tidal perturbations and baryonic\nfeedback most strongly influence galaxy structure -- thus provide an additional\nvaluable test of the simulation's efficacy. We compare scaling relations\nderived from mock observations of simulated galaxies, drawn from the two\nlargest halos in the high-resolution NewHorizon cosmological simulation, with\ngalaxies in the Fornax cluster. While Fornax is significantly more massive than\neither group, it is the lowest-mass cluster in the local Universe, and contains\na well-studied population of spatially resolved dwarfs, hence serves as a\nuseful benchmark. Per unit stellar mass, NewHorizon dwarfs are systematically\nlarger in half-light radius, much fainter in surface brightness, and bluer in\ncolour than their Fornax counterparts, albeit with similar light profile\nshapes. We discuss potential reasons for these discrepancies, including\nenvironmental effects, baryonic feedback, resolution, or couplings of these\nfactors. As observations of dwarfs outside of the local Universe become more\nplentiful through on-going or up-coming surveys such as Euclid and LSST, 2D\ncomparisons such as these, where properties are measured in the same way across\nboth simulations and observations, can place strong constraints on processes\nthat alter the spatial distribution of baryons in galaxies.",

Cosmic rays, with their\nsubstantial energy density, influence the interstellar medium (ISM) by\nsupporting galactic winds, modulating star formation, and shaping ISM\nenergetics. The simulations incorporate a multi-phase ISM, self-consistent CR\ntransport in the advection-diffusion approximation, and interactions with\nmagnetic fields to study their effect on galaxy evolution. Key findings reveal\nthat CRs reduce star formation rates, and drive weak but sustained outflows\nwith mass loading factors of $\\sim0.2$, transporting a substantial fraction\n(20%-60%) of the injected CR energy. These CR-driven outflows are launched not\njust from the galactic center but across the entire disk, illustrating their\npervasive dynamical influence. Galactic disks supported by CRs exhibit broader\nvertical structures compared to magnetic-field-dominated setups, though the\nscale heights are similar.

In particular,\n'chromosome maps' (ChMs) built with ground-based photometry were constructed to\nidentify the first and second generation stars (1G and 2G) over the wide-field\nof view. The ChMs allow us to derive the fraction of distinct populations in an\nanalyzed field of view. We present here the radial distribution of the 2G\nfraction in 29 GCs. The distributions show that all the GCs either have a flat\ndistribution or more centrally concentrated 2G stars. Notably, we find that the\nfraction of 1G stars outside the half-light radius is clearly bifurcated across\nall mass range. It implies that a group of GCs with lower 1G fractions\n(hereafter Group II) have efficiently lost their 1G stars in the outermost\ncluster regions. In fact, in connection with the trends of the radial\ndistribution, most GCs of Group II have spatially mixed populations, while only\nless massive GCs in Group I (a group with higher 1G fraction) show that\nfeature. Lastly, we investigate links between these two groups and host cluster\nparameters. We find that most GCs of Group II are distributed along a broader\nrange of galactocentric distances with smaller perigalactic distances < 3.5\nkpc.

    "abstract": "Language agents have become a promising solution to complex interactive\ntasks. One of the key ingredients to the success of language agents is the\nreward model on the trajectory of the agentic workflow, which provides valuable\nguidance during training or inference. However, due to the lack of annotations\nof intermediate interactions, most existing works use an outcome reward model\nto optimize policies across entire trajectories. This may lead to sub-optimal\npolicies and hinder the overall performance. To address this, we propose QLASS\n(Q-guided Language Agent Stepwise Search), to automatically generate\nannotations by estimating Q-values in a stepwise manner for open language\nagents. By introducing a reasoning tree and performing process reward modeling,\nQLASS provides effective intermediate guidance for each step. With the stepwise\nguidance, we propose a Q-guided generation strategy to enable language agents\nto better adapt to long-term value, resulting in significant performance\nimprovement during model inference on complex interactive agent tasks. Notably,\neven with almost half the annotated data, QLASS retains strong performance,\ndemonstrating its efficiency in handling limited supervision. We also\nempirically demonstrate that QLASS can lead to more effective decision making\nthrough qualitative analysis. We will release our code and data.",

    "abstract": "The discovery of new materials is essential for enabling technological\nadvancements. Computational approaches for predicting novel materials must\neffectively learn the manifold of stable crystal structures within an infinite\ndesign space. We introduce Open Materials Generation (OMatG), a unifying\nframework for the generative design and discovery of inorganic crystalline\nmaterials. OMatG employs stochastic interpolants (SI) to bridge an arbitrary\nbase distribution to the target distribution of inorganic crystals via a broad\nclass of tunable stochastic processes, encompassing both diffusion models and\nflow matching as special cases. In this work, we adapt the SI framework by\nintegrating an equivariant graph representation of crystal structures and\nextending it to account for periodic boundary conditions in unit cell\nrepresentations. Additionally, we couple the SI flow over spatial coordinates\nand lattice vectors with discrete flow matching for atomic species. We\nbenchmark OMatG's performance on two tasks: Crystal Structure Prediction (CSP)\nfor specified compositions, and 'de novo' generation (DNG) aimed at discovering\nstable, novel, and unique structures. In our ground-up implementation of OMatG,\nwe refine and extend both CSP and DNG metrics compared to previous works. OMatG\nestablishes a new state of the art in generative modeling for materials\ndiscovery, outperforming purely flow-based and diffusion-based implementations.\nThese results underscore the importance of designing flexible deep learning\nframeworks to accelerate progress in materials science.

Existing\nMoE training systems attempt to mitigate these effects through expert\nrearrangement strategies, but they face challenges in terms of memory\nefficiency and timeliness of rearrangement. This paper proposes Fully Sharded\nSparse Data Parallelism (FSSDP), an innovative approach that tackles the\nparallelization of MoE layers and potential straggler effects caused by\nimbalanced expert loads from a new perspective. FSSDP fully shards the\nparameters and optimizer states of MoE layers across devices and sparsely\nmaterializes MoE parameters from scratch in each iteration with two sparse\ncollectives SparseAllGather and SparseReduceScatter. We build Hecate, a\nhigh-performance MoE training system that incorporates FSSDP to fully unlock\nits potential. Hecate introduces heterogeneous sharding, sparse\nmaterialization, and re-materialization techniques to construct flexible and\nefficient expert placements with low memory and communication overhead. Our\nevaluation reveals that Hecate achieves up to 3.54x speedup compared over\nstate-of-the-art MoE training systems and consistently demonstrates\nimprovements across model architectures and hardware environments.",

We establish tight algorithmic upper bounds for COPO, both\nfor Gaussian noise with flexible covariance and general noise with local\ndependence.

This paper presents a new approach to\nteaching undergraduate software engineering that emphasizes not only software\nengineering methodology but also experiencing development as a member of a team\nand modifying a legacy code base. Our innovative software engineering course\nbegins with learning the fundamentals of software engineering, followed by\nexamining an existing framework of a social media application. The students are\nthen grouped into multiple software teams, each focusing on a different aspect\nof the app. The separate teams must define requirements, design, and provide\ndocumentation on the services. Using an Agile development approach, the teams\nincrementally add to the code base and demonstrate features as the application\nevolves. Subsequent iterations of the class pick up the prior students code\nbase, providing experience working with a legacy code base. Preliminary results\nof using this approach at the university are presented in this paper including\nquantitative analysis. Analysis of student software submissions to the\ncloud-based code repository shows student engagement and contributions over the\nspan of the course.

    "abstract": "Sudden violations of the slow-roll regime during inflation, a natural\nprediction of many UV-complete inflationary models, give rise to sharp features\nin the primordial power spectrum. At large scales, these features provide a\nunique window into the physics of inflation, with constraints primarily derived\nfrom Cosmic Microwave Background observations of linearly evolved primordial\nfluctuations. However, on smaller scales, it is less clear whether primordial\nfeatures would survive the late-time nonlinear cosmological evolution, as they\nare expected to be washed out by mode coupling. In this paper, we run dedicated\nN-body simulations to tackle this question. We demonstrate that, while\noscillatory-like patterns are erased over time by nonlinearities, signatures of\nprimordial sharp features can persist through the nonlinear regime of structure\nformation. Those take the form of a localised power enhancement or decrease in\nthe matter power spectrum, whose amplitude and position can in principle be\nused to recover the scale of the primordial feature, and an oscillatory pattern\nin the halo mass function. While these findings highlight the power for\nconstraining inflationary physics at small scales, they also show the\nchallenges posed by potential degeneracies with other physical processes\nrelevant in the nonlinear regime of structure formation such as non-cold dark\nmatter candidates. Our results open new avenues for probing inflationary\nphysics in large scale structures and galactic physics and emphasise the need\nfor refined theoretical tools to robustly constrain primordial features.",

    "abstract": "Numerical simulation of multi-component flow systems characterized by the\nsimultaneous presence of pressure-velocity coupling and pressure-density\ncoupling dominated regions remains a significant challenge in computational\nfluid dynamics. Thus, this work presents a novel approach that combines the\nGodunov-type scheme for high-speed flows with the projection solution procedure\nfor incompressible flows to address this challenge. The proposed hybrid\napproach begins by splitting the inviscid flux into the advection part and the\npressure part. The solution variables are first updated to their intermediate\nstates by solving the advection part with the all-speed AUSM (Advection Upwind\nSplitting Method) Riemann solver. The advection flux in AUSM is modified to\neliminate the pressure flux term that deteriorates the accuracy at the low Mach\nregion. To prevent the advection flux from causing spurious velocities when\nsurface tension is present, the pressure-velocity coupling term is modified to\nensure it vanishes at material interfaces. Then, we derive the pressure\nHelmholtz equation to solve the final pressure and update the intermediate\nstates to the solution variables at the next time step. The proposed hybrid\napproach retains the upwind property of the AUSM scheme for high Mach numbers\nwhile recovering central schemes and the standard projection solution for low\nMach limits. To accurately resolve the complex flow structures including shock\nwaves and material interfaces without numerical oscillations, a newly proposed\nhomogenous ROUND (Reconstruction Operator on Unified Normalised-variable\nDiagram) reconstruction strategy is employed in this work. By simulating\nhigh-speed compressible multiphase flows and incompressible multiphase flows,\nthis study demonstrates the ability of the proposed method to accurately handle\nflow regimes across all Mach numbers.",

Like\nclassification tasks, survival analysis can exhibit bias against disadvantaged\ngroups, often due to biases inherent in data or algorithms. Several studies in\nboth the IS and CS communities have attempted to address fairness in survival\nanalysis. However, existing methods often overlook the importance of prediction\nfairness at pre-defined evaluation time points, which is crucial in real-world\napplications where decision making often hinges on specific time frames. To\naddress this critical research gap, we introduce a new fairness concept:\nequalized odds (EO) in survival analysis, which emphasizes prediction fairness\nat pre-defined time points. To achieve the EO fairness in survival analysis, we\npropose a Conditional Mutual Information Augmentation (CMIA) approach, which\nfeatures a novel fairness regularization term based on conditional mutual\ninformation and an innovative censored data augmentation technique. Our CMIA\napproach can effectively balance prediction accuracy and fairness, and it is\napplicable to various survival models. We evaluate the CMIA approach against\nseveral state-of-the-art methods within three different application domains,\nand the results demonstrate that CMIA consistently reduces prediction disparity\nwhile maintaining good accuracy and significantly outperforms the other\ncompeting methods across multiple datasets and survival models (e.g., linear\nCOX, deep AFT).",

One approach\nthat has been proposed to enhance the efficiency of edge computing is\ncomputation reuse, which eliminates redundant computations. Edge computing is\nintegrated with the ICN architecture, capitalizing on its inherent intelligence\nto facilitate computation reuse and reduce redundancies in computing\noperations. In many past works, ICN's ability to enable computation reuse\nthrough caching has been limited. In this context, a new approach is proposed\nthat considers computation requests with similar input data, which yield\nidentical results, as equivalent. This method facilitates computation reuse\nthrough caching in ICN. The use of approximate results to reduce redundant\ncomputations without requiring high accuracy in input matching is provided.\nThis concept is termed the Similarity Index, which effectively considers images\nto be similar despite minor changes in the angle of photography.

While many promising\nmethods have been developed using online corpora and captioned photographs,\ntheir application to scientific domains, where data encodes highly specialized\nknowledge, remains a challenge. Liquid Argon Time Projection Chambers (LArTPCs)\nprovide high-resolution 3D imaging for fundamental physics, but analysis of\ntheir sparse, complex point cloud data often relies on supervised methods\ntrained on large simulations, introducing potential biases. We introduce the\nPoint-based Liquid Argon Masked Autoencoder (PoLAr-MAE), applying masked point\nmodeling to unlabeled LArTPC images using domain-specific volumetric\ntokenization and energy prediction.

However,\nthe exact balance between the two doping regimes to achieve the best device\nperformance is not clear, especially as a function of operating wavelength. In\nthis work, 330 nm LEDs with varied $p$-doping approaches were characterised as\na function of temperature: Mg doped only (reference); polarisation doped and Mg\ndoped (co-doped); and polarisation doped only. At room temperature, the\nco-doped LED showed the highest electroluminescence (EL) intensity, with a\nsimilar operating voltage to the reference LED. The highest hole concentration,\nconfirmed by Hall effect measurements, as well as improved injection efficiency\nrevealed by simulations, are credited as the main reasons for EL improvement. A\nparasitic near-UV luminescence tail, analogous to the \"blue luminescence\" in\n$p$-GaN, was observed in both the reference and co-doped LEDs, but was absent\nin the polarisation doped LED. The reference LED demonstrated the highest\nincrease in operating voltage with decreasing temperature, while the LED with\nonly polarisation doping showed a temperature-independent behaviour,\ndemonstrating the benefits of a polarisation field-induced carrier\nconcentration. Further optimisation of the compositional grading with\nconcurrent Mg doping can potentially produce higher performance LEDs with\ncleaner spectra.",

Our final\nsample of 119 galaxies includes cD galaxies, Virgo cluster galaxies, group\ngalaxies, and field galaxies. We revisited known scaling relations (SRs)\ninvolving structural parameters, as well as those involving supermassive black\nholes (SMBHs) and ultramassive black holes (UMBHs). Refining the SRs, we also\nrevisited the bulge classification and considered the Fundamental Plane (FP)\nand its projections, as well as other SRs, such as the colour-magnitude\nrelation (CMR), Tully-Fisher relation (TFR) and luminosity concentration\nrelation (LCR). Classical bulges follow the same relations as elliptical\ngalaxies, while pseudobulges are usually outliers. The NIR colours of classical\nbulges and pseudobulges indicate that their ages are not radically different\ndespite their spread in luminosity, but we noticed that classical bulges are\nmore luminous than pseudobulges, therefore, this property provides a\ncomplementary bulge classification criterion. We included pseudobulges from\nother studies to strengthen the tendencies seen for pseudobulges in our sample.\nFrom the SRs for BHs, we found that pseudobulges do not follow SRs for\nearly-type galaxies and classical bulges. Additionally, the lack of correlation\nbetween BHs and discs may indicate these structures have not coevolved. From\nthe revision of SRs, we present a sample of galaxies likely to host SMBHs or\nUMBHs, which are suitable for dynamical BH mass determination from the ground.",

These systems are frequently exposed to both inter-node and\nintra-node label shifts, which present a critical obstacle to effectively\noptimizing model performance while ensuring that data remains confined to each\nnode. To tackle this, we propose the Versatile Robust Label Shift (VRLS)\nmethod, which enhances the maximum likelihood estimation of the test-to-train\nlabel density ratio. VRLS incorporates Shannon entropy-based regularization and\nadjusts the density ratio during training to better handle label shifts at the\ntest time. In multi-node learning environments, VRLS further extends its\ncapabilities by learning and adapting density ratios across nodes, effectively\nmitigating label shifts and improving overall model performance. Experiments\nconducted on MNIST, Fashion MNIST, and CIFAR-10 demonstrate the effectiveness\nof VRLS, outperforming baselines by up to 20% in imbalanced settings. These\nresults highlight the significant improvements VRLS offers in addressing label\nshifts.

    "abstract": "Cybersecurity is one of the most pressing technological challenges of our\ntime and requires measures from all sectors of society. A key measure is\nautomated security response, which enables automated mitigation and recovery\nfrom cyber attacks. Significant strides toward such automation have been made\ndue to the development of rule-based response systems. However, these systems\nhave a critical drawback: they depend on domain experts to configure the rules,\na process that is both error-prone and inefficient. Framing security response\nas an optimal control problem shows promise in addressing this limitation but\nintroduces new challenges. Chief among them is bridging the gap between\ntheoretical optimality and operational performance. Current response systems\nwith theoretical optimality guarantees have only been validated analytically or\nin simulation, leaving their practical utility unproven.\n  This thesis tackles the aforementioned challenges by developing a practical\nmethodology for optimal security response in IT infrastructures. It encompasses\ntwo systems. First, it includes an emulation system that replicates key\ncomponents of the target infrastructure. We use this system to gather\nmeasurements and logs, based on which we identify a game-theoretic model.\nSecond, it includes a simulation system where game-theoretic response\nstrategies are optimized through stochastic approximation to meet a given\nobjective, such as mitigating potential attacks while maintaining operational\nservices. These strategies are then evaluated and refined in the emulation\nsystem to close the gap between theoretical and operational performance. We\nprove structural properties of optimal response strategies and derive efficient\nalgorithms for computing them. This enables us to solve a previously unsolved\nproblem: demonstrating optimal security response against network intrusions on\nan IT infrastructure.",

    "abstract": "One of the most well-known and simplest models for diversity maximization is\nthe Max-Min Diversification (MMD) model, which has been extensively studied in\nthe data mining and database literature. In this paper, we initiate the study\nof the Asymmetric Max-Min Diversification (AMMD) problem. The input is a\npositive integer $k$ and a complete digraph over $n$ vertices, together with a\nnonnegative distance function over the edges obeying the directed triangle\ninequality. The objective is to select a set of $k$ vertices, which maximizes\nthe smallest pairwise distance between them. AMMD reduces to the well-studied\nMMD problem in case the distances are symmetric, and has natural applications\nto query result diversification, web search, and facility location problems.\nAlthough the MMD problem admits a simple $\\frac{1}{2}$-approximation by\ngreedily selecting the next-furthest point, this strategy fails for AMMD and it\nremained unclear how to design good approximation algorithms for AMMD. We\npropose a combinatorial $\\frac{1}{6k}$-approximation algorithm for AMMD by\nleveraging connections with the Maximum Antichain problem. We discuss several\nways of speeding up the algorithm and compare its performance against heuristic\nbaselines on real-life and synthetic datasets.",

    "abstract": "TabPFN has emerged as a promising in-context learning model for tabular data,\ncapable of directly predicting the labels of test samples given labeled\ntraining examples. It has demonstrated competitive performance, particularly on\nsmall-scale classification tasks. However, despite its effectiveness, TabPFN\nstill requires further refinement in several areas, including handling\nhigh-dimensional features, aligning with downstream datasets, and scaling to\nlarger datasets. In this paper, we revisit existing variants of TabPFN and\nobserve that most approaches focus either on reducing bias or variance, often\nneglecting the need to address the other side, while also increasing inference\noverhead. To fill this gap, we propose Beta (Bagging and Encoder-based\nFine-tuning for TabPFN Adaptation), a novel and effective method designed to\nminimize both bias and variance. To reduce bias, we introduce a lightweight\nencoder to better align downstream tasks with the pre-trained TabPFN. By\nincreasing the number of encoders in a lightweight manner, Beta mitigate\nvariance, thereby further improving the model's performance. Additionally,\nbootstrapped sampling is employed to further reduce the impact of data\nperturbations on the model, all while maintaining computational efficiency\nduring inference.

The second is the formulation of vacuum energy as\n$\\Lambda_{\\rm eff}\\!\\propto\\! F^2$ in terms of an exact $4$-form abelian gauge\nfield strength $F\\!=\\!dA$. When $A$ is identified with the Chern-Simons\n$3$-form of the Euler class, defined in terms of the spin connection, a $J\\cdot\nA$ interaction is generated by the conformal anomaly of massless fermions.

    "abstract": "Directional couplers are a fundamental building block in integrated\nphotonics, particularly in quantum applications and optimization-based design\nwhere precision is critical. Accurate functionality is crucial to ensure\nreliable operation within classical and quantum circuits. However,\ndiscrepancies between simulations and measurements are frequently observed.\nThese inaccuracies can compromise the performance and scalability of integrated\nphotonic systems, underscoring the critical need for advanced, precise\nsimulation methods that bridge the gap between design and implementation. In\nthis work, we show that this discrepancy can be mainly attributed to density\nchanges in the oxide cladding. We conduct a systematic study involving\nexperimental optical measurements, numerical simulations, and direct electron\nmicroscopy imaging to investigate this discrepancy in directional couplers. We\nfind that the impact of cladding density variations on performance increases as\nfeature gaps shrink. By incorporating these effects into our simulations using\na novel and physically motivated Effective Trench Medium Model (ETMM), we\nachieve highly accurate reproduction of experimental measurements. We quantify\nthe effects of cladding density variations on the SU(2) symmetry parameters\nthat govern light propagation in directional couplers. This insight is crucial\nfor advancing the precision of compact device fabrication, enabling reliable\nsimulation of photonic integrated devices.",

However, the privacy risks associated with IARs remain\nunexplored, raising concerns regarding their responsible deployment. To address\nthis gap, we conduct a comprehensive privacy analysis of IARs, comparing their\nprivacy risks to the ones of DMs as reference points. Concretely, we develop a\nnovel membership inference attack (MIA) that achieves a remarkably high success\nrate in detecting training images (with a True Positive Rate at False Positive\nRate = 1% of 86.38% vs. 6.38% for DMs with comparable attacks). We leverage our\nnovel MIA to provide dataset inference (DI) for IARs, and show that it requires\nas few as 6 samples to detect dataset membership (compared to 200 for DI in\nDMs), confirming a higher information leakage in IARs. Finally, we are able to\nextract hundreds of training data points from an IAR (e.g., 698 from VAR-d30).\nOur results suggest a fundamental privacy-utility trade-off: while IARs excel\nin image generation quality and speed, they are empirically significantly more\nvulnerable to privacy attacks compared to DMs that achieve similar performance.\nWe release the code at https://github.com/sprintml/privacy_attacks_against_iars\nfor reproducibility.",

Recent studies have shown that increasing\ntest-time computation enhances LLMs' reasoning capabilities.

Despite external guidance, the\neffectiveness of this system demonstrates the potential of a single LLM to\ntackle complex tasks.

This work explores an orthogonal direction focusing on\npost-training LLMs for autoregressive searching (i.e., an extended reasoning\nprocess with self-reflection and self-exploration of new strategies).

    "abstract": "When reading a document, glancing at the spatial layout of a document is an\ninitial step to understand it roughly. Traditional document layout analysis\n(DLA) methods, however, offer only a superficial parsing of documents, focusing\non basic instance detection and often failing to capture the nuanced spatial\nand logical relations between instances. These limitations hinder DLA-based\nmodels from achieving a gradually deeper comprehension akin to human reading.\nIn this work, we propose a novel graph-based Document Structure Analysis (gDSA)\ntask. This task requires that model not only detects document elements but also\ngenerates spatial and logical relations in form of a graph structure, allowing\nto understand documents in a holistic and intuitive manner. For this new task,\nwe construct a relation graph-based document structure analysis dataset\n(GraphDoc) with 80K document images and 4.13M relation annotations, enabling\ntraining models to complete multiple tasks like reading order, hierarchical\nstructures analysis, and complex inter-element relation inference. Furthermore,\na document relation graph generator (DRGG) is proposed to address the gDSA\ntask, which achieves performance with 57.6% at mAP$_g$@0.5 for a strong\nbenchmark baseline on this novel task and dataset. We hope this graphical\nrepresentation of document structure can mark an innovative advancement in\ndocument structure analysis and understanding. The new dataset and code will be\nmade publicly available at https://yufanchen96.github.io/projects/GraphDoc.",

Current attack methodologies use general techniques such as\nmodel querying or pixel value perturbations to generate adversarial examples\ndesigned to fool a model. These approaches may not adequately address the\nunique characteristics of clinical errors stemming from missed or incorrectly\nidentified clinical features. We propose the Concept-based Report Perturbation\nAttack (CoRPA), a clinically-focused black-box adversarial attack framework\ntailored to the medical imaging domain. CoRPA leverages clinical concepts to\ngenerate adversarial radiological reports and images that closely mirror\nrealistic clinical misdiagnosis scenarios.

This paper introduces a framework to analyze the\nsuitability of embedding models specifically for data curation in the language\nmodel pretraining setting. We quantify the correlation between similarity in\nthe embedding space to similarity in pretraining loss between different\ntraining examples, and how diversifying in the embedding space affects\npretraining quality. We analyze a variety of embedding models in our framework,\nwith experiments using the Pile dataset for pretraining a 1.7B parameter\ndecoder-only language model. We find that the embedding models we consider are\nall useful for pretraining data curation. Moreover, a simple approach of\naveraging per-token embeddings proves to be surprisingly competitive with more\nsophisticated embedding models -- likely because the latter are not designed\nspecifically for pretraining data curation. Indeed, we believe our analysis and\nevaluation framework can serve as a foundation for the design of embedding\nmodels that specifically reason about similarity in pretraining datasets.",

It employs a smaller model to generate a\ndraft token sequence, which is then verified by the original base model. In\nmulti-GPU systems, inference latency can be further reduced through tensor\nparallelism (TP), while the optimal TP size of the draft model is typically\nsmaller than that of the base model, leading to GPU idling during the drafting\nstage. To solve this problem, we propose EasySpec, a layer-parallel speculation\nstrategy that optimizes the efficiency of multi-GPU utilization.EasySpec breaks\nthe sequential execution order of layers in the drafting model, enabling\nmulti-layer parallelization across devices, albeit with some induced\napproximation errors. After each drafting-and-verification iteration, the draft\nmodel's key-value (KV) cache is calibrated in a single forward pass, preventing\nlong-term error accumulation at minimal additional latency. We evaluated\nEasySpec on several mainstream open-source LLMs, using smaller versions of\nmodels from the same series as drafters. The results demonstrate that EasySpec\ncan achieve a peak speedup of 4.17x compared to vanilla decoding, while\npreserving the original distribution of the base LLMs. Specifically, the\ndrafting stage can be accelerated by up to 1.62x with a maximum accuracy drop\nof only 7%, requiring no training or fine-tuning on the draft models.",

We show that this limitation\narises from the conventional pixel reconstruction objective, which biases\nmodels toward appearance fidelity at the expense of motion coherence. To\naddress this, we introduce VideoJAM, a novel framework that instills an\neffective motion prior to video generators, by encouraging the model to learn a\njoint appearance-motion representation. VideoJAM is composed of two\ncomplementary units. During training, we extend the objective to predict both\nthe generated pixels and their corresponding motion from a single learned\nrepresentation. During inference, we introduce Inner-Guidance, a mechanism that\nsteers the generation toward coherent motion by leveraging the model's own\nevolving motion prediction as a dynamic guidance signal. Notably, our framework\ncan be applied to any video model with minimal adaptations, requiring no\nmodifications to the training data or scaling of the model. VideoJAM achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance in motion coherence, surpassing highly competitive\nproprietary models while also enhancing the perceived visual quality of the\ngenerations. These findings emphasize that appearance and motion can be\ncomplementary and, when effectively integrated, enhance both the visual quality\nand the coherence of video generation.

    "abstract": "Diffusion models have gained popularity in graph generation tasks; however,\nthe extent of their expressivity concerning the graph distributions they can\nlearn is not fully understood. Unlike models in other domains, popular\nbackbones for graph diffusion models, such as Graph Transformers, do not\npossess universal expressivity to accurately model the distribution scores of\ncomplex graph data. Our work addresses this limitation by focusing on the\nfrequency of specific substructures as a key characteristic of target graph\ndistributions. When evaluating existing models using this metric, we find that\nthey fail to maintain the distribution of substructure counts observed in the\ntraining set when generating new graphs. To address this issue, we establish a\ntheoretical connection between the expressivity of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)\nand the overall performance of graph diffusion models, demonstrating that more\nexpressive GNN backbones can better capture complex distribution patterns. By\nintegrating advanced GNNs into the backbone architecture, we achieve\nsignificant improvements in substructure generation.",

However, many practical scenarios naturally involve\nheavy-tailed rewards or rewards where the worst-case range can be substantially\nlarger than the variance. In this paper, we develop an algorithmic approach\nbuilding on Catoni's estimator from robust statistics, and apply it to\ncontextual bandits with general function approximation. When the variance of\nthe reward at each round is known, we use a variance-weighted regression\napproach and establish a regret bound that depends only on the cumulative\nreward variance and logarithmically on the reward range $R$ as well as the\nnumber of rounds $T$. For the unknown-variance case, we further propose a\ncareful peeling-based algorithm and remove the need for cumbersome variance\nestimation. With additional dependence on the fourth moment, our algorithm also\nenjoys a variance-based bound with logarithmic reward-range dependence.\nMoreover, we demonstrate the optimality of the leading-order term in our regret\nbound through a matching lower bound.",

Data augmentation techniques\ncan be used to improve generalisability by expanding the diversity of feature\nrepresentations in the training data by altering existing examples.\nImage-to-image translation models are one approach capable of imposing the\ncharacteristic feature representations (i.e. style) of images from one dataset\nonto another.

    "abstract": "This study investigates the complex kinetics of thermodynamic nonequilibrium\neffects (TNEs) and their relative importance during the development of\nKelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI) using high-order discrete Boltzmann models\n(DBMs). First, the capabilities and differences among various discrete velocity\nsets in capturing TNEs and distribution functions are assessed. Practical\nguidelines for constructing discrete velocity stencils are proposed to enhance\nphase-space discretization and improve the robustness of high-order DBM\nsimulation. At different stages of KHI and under varying initial conditions,\nmultiscale TNEs, such as viscous stresses of different orders, emerge with\ndistinct dominant roles. Specifically, three scenarios are identified: (i)\nregimes dominated by first-order TNEs,(ii) alternation between first- and\nsecond-order TNEs, and (iii) states where second-order TNEs govern the system's\nbehavior. To quantitatively capture these transitions, criteria for TNE\ndominance at different orders in KHI evolution are established based on the\nrelative thermodynamic nonequilibrium intensity (\\(R_{\\text{TNE}}\\)). In\nscenarios dominated by second-order TNEs, differences between first-order and\nsecond-order models are compared in terms of macroscopic quantities,\nnonequilibrium effects, and kinetic moments, revealing the physical limitations\nof low-order models in capturing TNEs. Furthermore, the effectiveness,\nextensibility, and limitations of a representative high-order model are\nexamined under second-order TNE-dominated conditions. To encapsulate these\nfindings, a nonequilibrium phase diagram that visually maps the multiscale\ncharacteristics of KHI is constructed. This diagram not only provides intuitive\ninsights into the dynamic interplay of different nonequilibrium effects but\nalso serves as a kinetic roadmap for selecting suitable models under diverse\nnonequilibrium conditions.",

This study investigates the\nrepresentation learning gap between these two categories by analyzing\nmulti-level patch embeddings applied to cell instance segmentation and\nclassification. We implement an encoder-decoder architecture with a consistent\ndecoder and various encoders. These include convolutional, vision transformer\n(ViT), and hybrid encoders pre-trained on ImageNet-22K or LVD-142M,\nrepresenting general-purpose foundation models. These are compared against ViT\nencoders from the recently released UNI, Virchow2, and Prov-GigaPath foundation\nmodels, trained on patches extracted from hundreds of thousands of\nhistopathology whole-slide images. The decoder integrates patch embeddings from\ndifferent encoder depths via skip connections to generate semantic and distance\nmaps. These maps are then post-processed to create instance segmentation masks\nwhere each label corresponds to an individual cell and to perform cell-type\nclassification. All encoders remain frozen during training to assess their\npre-trained feature extraction capabilities. Using the PanNuke and CoNIC\nhistopathology datasets, and the newly introduced Nissl-stained CytoDArk0\ndataset for brain cytoarchitecture studies, we evaluate instance-level\ndetection, segmentation accuracy, and cell-type classification.

To address these issues and facilitate more convenient editing\nof face images, we propose a novel approach that leverages the power of\nStable-Diffusion (SD) models and crude 3D face models to control the lighting,\nfacial expression and head pose of a portrait photo.

    "abstract": "A smart ring is a wearable electronic device in the form of a ring that\nincorporates diverse sensors and computing technologies to perform a variety of\nfunctions. Designed for use with fingers, smart rings are capable of sensing\nmore subtle and abundant hand movements, thus making them a good platform for\ninteraction. Meanwhile, fingers are abundant with blood vessels and nerve\nendings and accustomed to wearing rings, providing an ideal site for continuous\nhealth monitoring through smart rings, which combine comfort with the ability\nto capture vital biometric data, making them suitable for all-day wear. We\ncollected in total of 206 smart ring-related publications and conducted a\nsystematic literature review. We provide a taxonomy regarding the sensing and\nfeedback modalities, applications, and phenomena. We review and categorize\nthese literatures into four main areas: (1) interaction - input, (2)\ninteraction - output, (3) passive sensing - in body feature, (4) passive\nsensing - out body activity.

    "abstract": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) mainly fall into two architectures,\neach involving a trade-off between training and inference efficiency: embedding\nspace alignment (e.g., LLaVA-1.5) is inefficient during inference, while\ncross-attention space alignment (e.g., Flamingo) is inefficient in training. In\nthis paper, we compare these two architectures and identify the key factors for\nbuilding efficient MLLMs. A primary difference between them lies in how\nattention is applied to visual tokens, particularly in their interactions with\neach other. To investigate whether attention among visual tokens is necessary,\nwe propose a new self-attention mechanism, NAAViT (\\textbf{N}o\n\\textbf{A}ttention \\textbf{A}mong \\textbf{Vi}sual \\textbf{T}okens), which\neliminates this type of attention. Our pilot experiment on LLaVA-1.5 shows that\nattention among visual tokens is highly redundant. Based on these insights, we\nintroduce SAISA (\\textbf{S}elf-\\textbf{A}ttention \\textbf{I}nput \\textbf{S}pace\n\\textbf{A}lignment), a novel architecture that enhance both training and\ninference efficiency. SAISA directly aligns visual features with the input\nspaces of NAAViT self-attention blocks, reducing computational overhead in both\nself-attention blocks and feed-forward networks (FFNs). Using the same\nconfiguration as LLaVA-1.5, SAISA reduces inference FLOPs by 66\\% and training\nbudget by 26\\%, while achieving superior performance in terms of accuracy.\nComprehensive ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of SAISA\nacross various LLMs and visual encoders.

In\nsuch a case, engineers prefer to obtain a set of Pareto optimal solutions with\nrespect to those requirements, but uniform sampling of generative models may\nnot yield a useful Pareto front. To address this gap, we introduce a new\nframework for Pareto-front design exploration with simulation fine-tuned\ngenerative models. First, the framework adopts preference alignment methods\ndeveloped for Large Language Models (LLMs) and showcases the first application\nin fine-tuning a generative model for engineering design. The important\ndistinction here is that we use a simulator instead of humans to provide\naccurate and scalable feedback. Next, we propose epsilon-sampling, inspired by\nthe epsilon-constraint method used for Pareto-front generation with classical\noptimization algorithms, to construct a high-quality Pareto front with the\nfine-tuned models. Our framework, named e-SimFT, is shown to produce\nbetter-quality Pareto fronts than existing multi-objective alignment methods.",

    "abstract": "Quantum computers create new security risks for today's encryption systems.\nThis paper presents an improved version of the Advanced Encryption Standard\n(AES) that uses quantum technology to strengthen protection. Our approach\noffers two modes: a fully quantum-based method for maximum security and a\nhybrid version that works with existing infrastructure. The system generates\nencryption keys using quantum randomness instead of predictable computer\nalgorithms, making keys virtually impossible to guess. It regularly refreshes\nthese keys automatically to block long-term attacks, even as technology\nadvances. Testing confirms the system works seamlessly with current security\nstandards, maintaining fast performance for high-volume data transfers. The\nupgraded AES keeps its original security benefits while adding three key\ndefenses: quantum-powered key creation, adjustable security settings for\ndifferent threats, and safeguards against attacks that exploit device\nvulnerabilities. Organizations can implement this solution in stages--starting\nwith hybrid mode for sensitive data while keeping older systems operational.\nThis phased approach allows businesses to protect financial transactions,\nmedical records, and communication networks today while preparing for more\npowerful quantum computers in the future. The design prioritizes easy adoption,\nrequiring no costly replacements of existing hardware or software in most\ncases.",

In\nthis work, we present an approach to address these drawbacks. We introduce a\nmodified Cartesian impedance control method combined with a Dynamical System\n(DS)-based motion generator, aimed at enhancing the interaction capability of\nthe EE without compromising main task tracking performance. This approach\nenables human coworkers to interact with the EE on-the-fly, e.g. tool\nchangeover, after which the robot compliantly resumes its task. Additionally,\ncombining with a new null space impedance control method enables the robot body\nto exhibit compliant behaviour in response to interactions, avoiding serious\ninjuries from accidental contact while mitigating the impact on main task\ntracking performance.

Applications that were once\ndesigned for basic MCUs are now deployed on highly heterogeneous SoC platforms.\nWhile these platforms deliver the necessary computational performance, they\nalso present challenges related to resource sharing and predictability. These\nchallenges are particularly pronounced when consolidating safety and\nnon-safety-critical systems, the so-called Mixed-Criticality Systems (MCS) to\nadhere to strict SWaP-C requirements. MCS consolidation on shared platforms\nrequires stringent spatial and temporal isolation to comply with functional\nsafety standards. Virtualization, mainly leveraged by hypervisors, is a key\ntechnology that ensures spatial isolation across multiple OSes and\napplications; however, ensuring temporal isolation remains challenging due to\ncontention on shared hardwar resources, which impacts real-time performance and\npredictability. To mitigate this problem, several strategies as cache coloring\nand memory bandwidth reservation have been proposed. Although cache coloring is\ntypically implemented on state-of-the-art hypervisors, memory bandwidth\nreservation approaches are commonly implemented at the Linux kernel level or\nrely on dedicated hardware and typically do not consider the concept of VMs\nthat can run different OSes. To fill the gap between current memory bandwidth\nreservation solutions and the deployment of MCSs that operate on a hypervisor,\nthis work introduces H-MBR, an open-source VM-centric memory bandwidth\nreservation mechanism. H-MBR features (i) VM-centric bandwidth reservation,\n(ii) OS and platform agnosticism, and (iii) reduced overhead.

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in deep learning optimization have introduced new\nalgorithms, such as Schedule-Free optimizers, AdEMAMix, MARS and Lion which\nmodify traditional momentum mechanisms. In a separate line of work, theoretical\nacceleration of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) in noise-dominated regime has\nbeen achieved by decoupling the momentum coefficient from the current\ngradient's weight. In this paper, we establish explicit connections between\nthese two lines of work. We substantiate our theoretical findings with\npreliminary experiments on a 150m language modeling task. We find that\nAdEMAMix, which most closely resembles accelerated versions of stochastic\ngradient descent, exhibits superior performance. Building on these insights, we\nintroduce a modification to AdEMAMix, termed Simplified-AdEMAMix, which\nmaintains the same performance as AdEMAMix across both large and small\nbatch-size settings while eliminating the need for two different momentum\nterms. The code for Simplified-AdEMAMix is available on the repository:\nhttps://github.com/DepenM/Simplified-AdEMAMix/.",

We develop an EP estimator, $E_{\\rm ep}$, to evaluate the\nconsistency of the peculiar acceleration power spectrum across different\ntracers. By calculating the ratio of the peculiar acceleration power spectra of\ntracers, the ensemble average of $E_{\\rm ep}$ is expected to be unity if EP\nholds on cosmological scales for these tracers. We validate this estimator\nusing N-body simulations, focusing on four redshift bins with $z\\leq 1.5$ and\nscales of $k$ in the range of $0.007$ and $0.2$ $h/\\rm Mpc$. By fitting a\nsingle parameter $\\delta_{\\rm ep}$ across redshifts, we find that DM particle\nmocks without EP violation yield $\\delta_{\\rm ep}$ consistent with zero under\nthe small redshift measurement uncertainty case, while the large redshift\nuncertainty case slightly induces biases at low redshifts.

Relativistic ray tracing of photons emitted from\nthe immediate vicinity of compact objects has, to date, been used to\ninvestigate various mechanisms that explain the observed weak BH QPOs.

Here, we\nexplore the QPO modulation mechanisms based on the BL obscuration. Using\nsimplified models of axisymmetric oscillations of thick accretion discs (tori),\nwe demonstrate that the disc oscillations drive the high NS QPO amplitudes\nthrough BL obscuration, which is relevant especially for vertical oscillations.\nWe also demonstrate that obscuration effects enable the observability of the\nKeplerian frequency in the case of discs that decay due to instabilities.",

Existing distributed attention mechanisms face significant\ncommunication overheads, making cross-attention layers a critical bottleneck\nfor efficient training and inference of MLLMs. To address this, we propose\nLV-XAttn, a distributed, exact cross-attention mechanism with minimal\ncommunication overhead. We observe that in applications involving large visual\ninputs, the size of the query block is typically much smaller than that of the\nkey-value blocks. Thus, in LV-XAttn we keep the large key-value blocks locally\non each GPU and exchange smaller query blocks across GPUs. We also introduce an\nefficient activation recomputation technique to support longer visual context.\nWe theoretically analyze the communication benefits of LV-XAttn and show that\nit can achieve speedups for a wide range of models. Our evaluations with Llama\n3-V, mPLUG-Owl3 and OpenFlamingo models find that LV-XAttn achieves up to\n10.62$\\times$ end-to-end speedup compared to existing approaches.",

This paper\npresents a method, based on discrete Fourier transform, for generating\nsynthetic time series with similar statistical moments for any given signal.\nThe suggested method makes it possible to control the level of similarity\nbetween the given signal and the generated synthetic signals. Proof shows\nanalytically that this method preserves the first two statistical moments of\nthe input signal, and its autocorrelation function. The method is compared to\nknown methods, ARMA, GAN, and CoSMoS. A large variety of environmental datasets\nwith different temporal resolutions, and from different domains are used,\ntesting the generality and flexibility of the method. A Python library\nimplementing this method is made available as open-source software.",

    "abstract": "We introduce FewTopNER, a novel framework that integrates few-shot named\nentity recognition (NER) with topic-aware contextual modeling to address the\nchallenges of cross-lingual and low-resource scenarios. FewTopNER leverages a\nshared multilingual encoder based on XLM-RoBERTa, augmented with\nlanguage-specific calibration mechanisms, to generate robust contextual\nembeddings. The architecture comprises a prototype-based entity recognition\nbranch, employing BiLSTM and Conditional Random Fields for sequence labeling,\nand a topic modeling branch that extracts document-level semantic features\nthrough hybrid probabilistic and neural methods. A cross-task bridge\nfacilitates dynamic bidirectional attention and feature fusion between entity\nand topic representations, thereby enhancing entity disambiguation by\nincorporating global semantic context. Empirical evaluations on multilingual\nbenchmarks across English, French, Spanish, German, and Italian demonstrate\nthat FewTopNER significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art few-shot NER\nmodels. In particular, the framework achieves improvements of 2.5-4.0\npercentage points in F1 score and exhibits enhanced topic coherence, as\nmeasured by normalized pointwise mutual information. Ablation studies further\nconfirm the critical contributions of the shared encoder and cross-task\nintegration mechanisms to the overall performance. These results underscore the\nefficacy of incorporating topic-aware context into few-shot NER and highlight\nthe potential of FewTopNER for robust cross-lingual applications in\nlow-resource settings.",

    "abstract": "Research on LLM technologies is rapidly emerging, with most of them employ a\n'fast thinking' approach to inference. Most LLMs generate the final result\nbased solely on a single query and LLM's reasoning capabilities. However, with\nthe advent of OpenAI-o1, 'slow thinking' techniques have garnered increasing\nattention because its process is closer to the human thought process. Inspired\nby the human ability to constantly associate and replenish knowledge during\nthinking, we developed the novel Chain-of-Associated-Thoughts (CoAT) framework,\nwhich introduces an innovative synergy between the Monte Carlo Tree Search\n(MCTS) algorithm and a dynamic mechanism for integrating new key information,\ntermed 'associative memory'. By combining the structured exploration\ncapabilities of MCTS with the adaptive learning capacity of associative memory,\nCoAT significantly expands the LLM search space, enabling our framework to\nexplore diverse reasoning pathways and dynamically update its knowledge base in\nreal-time. This allows the framework to not only revisit and refine earlier\ninferences but also adaptively incorporate evolving information, ensuring that\nthe final output is both accurate and comprehensive. We validate CoAT's\neffectiveness across a variety of generative and reasoning tasks. Quantitative\nexperiments show that CoAT achieves over 10% performance improvement on\nopen-source multi-hop reasoning datasets (HotpotQA, MuSiQue) and more than 15%\ngain on our proprietary CRB dataset.",

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the challenge of anti-jamming in moving reactive jamming\nscenarios. The moving reactive jammer initiates high-power tracking jamming\nupon detecting any transmission activity, and when unable to detect a signal,\nresorts to indiscriminate jamming. This presents dual imperatives: maintaining\nhiding to avoid the jammer's detection and simultaneously evading\nindiscriminate jamming. Spread spectrum techniques effectively reduce\ntransmitting power to elude detection but fall short in countering\nindiscriminate jamming. Conversely, changing communication frequencies can help\nevade indiscriminate jamming but makes the transmission vulnerable to tracking\njamming without spread spectrum techniques to remain hidden. Current\nmethodologies struggle with the complexity of simultaneously optimizing these\ntwo requirements due to the expansive joint action spaces and the dynamics of\nmoving reactive jammers. To address these challenges, we propose a parallelized\ndeep reinforcement learning (DRL) strategy. The approach includes a\nparallelized network architecture designed to decompose the action space. A\nparallel exploration-exploitation selection mechanism replaces the $\\varepsilon\n$-greedy mechanism, accelerating convergence. Simulations demonstrate a nearly\n90\\% increase in normalized throughput.",

The main reason of climate change is the\ngreenhouse effect caused by the accumulation of carbon dioxide in the\natmosphere. In this paper, we design a networked system underpinned by\ncompartmental dynamical thermodynamics to circulate the atmospheric carbon\ndioxide. Specifically, in the carbon dioxide emitter compartment, we develop an\ninitial-condition-dependent finite-time stabilizing controller that guarantees\nstability within a desired time leveraging the system property of affinity in\nthe control. Then, to compensate for carbon emissions we show that a\ncultivation of microalgae with a volume 625 times bigger than the one of the\ncarbon emitter is required. To increase the carbon uptake of the microalgae, we\nimplement the nonaffine-in-the-control microalgae dynamical equations as an\nenvironment of a state-of-the-art library for reinforcement learning (RL),\nnamely, Stable-Baselines3, and then, through the library, we test the\nperformance of eight RL algorithms for training a controller that maximizes the\nmicroalgae absorption of carbon through the light intensity. All the eight\ncontrollers increased the carbon absorption of the cultivation during a\ntraining of 200,000 time steps with a maximum episode length of 200 time steps\nand with no termination conditions.

In\nthis work, we search for a diffuse photon flux in the energy range between 50\nPeV and 200 PeV using data from the Pierre Auger Observatory. For the first\ntime, we combine the air-shower measurements from a 2 km$^2$ surface array\nconsisting of 19 water-Cherenkov surface detectors, spaced at 433 m, with the\nmuon measurements from an array of buried scintillators placed in the same\narea. Using 15 months of data, collected while the array was still under\nconstruction, we derive upper limits to the integral photon flux ranging from\n13.3 to 13.8 km$^{-2}$ sr$^{-1}$ yr$^{-1}$ above tens of PeV. We extend the\nPierre Auger Observatory photon search program towards lower energies, covering\nmore than three decades of cosmic-ray energy. This work lays the foundation for\nfuture diffuse photon searches: with the data from the next 10 years of\noperation of the Observatory, this limit is expected to improve by a factor of\n$\\sim$20.",

    "abstract": "Benchmark datasets have proved pivotal to the success of graph learning, and\ngood benchmark datasets are crucial to guide the development of the field.\nRecent research has highlighted problems with graph-learning datasets and\nbenchmarking practices -- revealing, for example, that methods which ignore the\ngraph structure can outperform graph-based approaches. Such findings raise two\nquestions: (1) What makes a good graph-learning dataset, and (2) how can we\nevaluate dataset quality in graph learning? Our work addresses these questions.\nAs the classic evaluation setup uses datasets to evaluate models, it does not\napply to dataset evaluation. Hence, we start from first principles. Observing\nthat graph-learning datasets uniquely combine two modes -- graph structure and\nnode features --, we introduce Rings, a flexible and extensible\nmode-perturbation framework to assess the quality of graph-learning datasets\nbased on dataset ablations -- i.e., quantifying differences between the\noriginal dataset and its perturbed representations. Within this framework, we\npropose two measures -- performance separability and mode complementarity -- as\nevaluation tools, each assessing the capacity of a graph dataset to benchmark\nthe power and efficacy of graph-learning methods from a distinct angle. We\ndemonstrate the utility of our framework for dataset evaluation via extensive\nexperiments on graph-level tasks and derive actionable recommendations for\nimproving the evaluation of graph-learning methods. Our work opens new research\ndirections in data-centric graph learning, and it constitutes a step toward the\nsystematic evaluation of evaluations.",

We\nreport closed-form expressions of the reduced kinetic and exchange energies of\nthese excited-state UEGs as functions of the density and the gap. Additionally,\nwe derive the leading term of the correlation energy in the high-density limit.\nBy incorporating an additional variable representing the degree of excitation\ninto the UEG paradigm, the present work introduces a new framework for\nconstructing local and semi-local state-specific functionals for excited\nstates.",

We produce and compare light curves of this transit event using\nhydrodynamical models with different values of the disc's gas mass, dust mass,\nand $\\alpha$-viscosity to determine the observable effect of each parameter.\nThese comparisons provide insight that could aid in the analysis of\nobservational data from the system when the real transit occurs and provide\nrecommendations for how such observations should be made. We find that a higher\ndust mass or higher value of $\\alpha$ correspond to a longer transit, with the\ngas mass having a more minor effect on the overall shape and duration of the\ntransit. A higher $\\alpha$ has an observable effect on the viscous spreading at\nthe outer edge of the disc, though is countered through truncation by the outer\nbinary. It is also shown that long-term interactions between the outer binary\nand disc can excite spiral arms in the disc, which introduce observable\nasymmetries to the light curve. Our models suggest that the transit should have\nbegun at the time of writing, but no dimming has yet been observed. It is\nlikely that the disc has a smaller radial extent than our models, due to a\nlower viscosity than can be simulated with SPH. The transit is expected to last\n8-11 years, ending in late 2034 at the latest.",

Matching the equation of state\n(EoS) for the crust and core and obtaining a suitable description of these\nextreme conditions are crucial for understanding the properties of these\ncompact objects. In this work, we construct ten different NS EoSs incorporating\nthree distinct crust models, which are connected to the core using a\nthermodynamically and causally consistent formalism. For cold NSs, we propose a\nlinear relationship between pressure and energy density in a narrow region\nbetween the crust and core, effectively establishing an interpolation function\nin the pressure-baryonic chemical potential plane. We then compare this EoS\nmatching method with the classical approach, which neglects causal and\nthermodynamic consistency. We solve the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation to\nobtain the mass-radius relationship and compare our results with observational\nconstraints on NSs. Furthermore, we investigate the influence of the new\nmatching formalism on non-radial oscillation frequencies and damping times. Our\nfindings suggest that the method used to glue the crust and core EoS impacts NS\nobservables, such as the radius, oscillation frequencies, and damping times of\nnon-radial modes, which may be crucial for interpreting future gravitational\nwave observations from neutron star mergers or isolated pulsars.

    "abstract": "The generation of a virtual digital avatar is a crucial research topic in the\nfield of computer vision. Many existing works utilize Neural Radiance Fields\n(NeRF) to address this issue and have achieved impressive results. However,\nprevious works assume the images of the training person are available and fixed\nwhile the appearances and poses of a subject could constantly change and\nincrease in real-world scenarios. How to update the human avatar but also\nmaintain the ability to render the old appearance of the person is a practical\nchallenge. One trivial solution is to combine the existing virtual avatar\nmodels based on NeRF with continual learning methods. However, there are some\ncritical issues in this approach: learning new appearances and poses can cause\nthe model to forget past information, which in turn leads to a degradation in\nthe rendering quality of past appearances, especially color bleeding issues,\nand incorrect human body poses. In this work, we propose a maintainable avatar\n(MaintaAvatar) based on neural radiance fields by continual learning, which\nresolves the issues by utilizing a Global-Local Joint Storage Module and a Pose\nDistillation Module. Overall, our model requires only limited data collection\nto quickly fine-tune the model while avoiding catastrophic forgetting, thus\nachieving a maintainable virtual avatar. The experimental results validate the\neffectiveness of our MaintaAvatar model.",

The lightweight inference,\nscalability, and competitive accuracy of RAPID-Net position it as a viable\noption for large-scale virtual screening campaigns.

The number of dementia patients is increasing as the population ages,\nand it is estimated that over 10 million people develop dementia each year.\nDementia progresses gradually, and the sooner a patient receives help and\nsupport, the better their chances of maintaining their functional abilities.\nFor this reason, early diagnosis of dementia is important. In recent years,\nmachine learning models based on naturally spoken language have been developed\nfor the early diagnosis of dementia. These methods have proven to be\nuser-friendly, cost-effective, scalable, and capable of providing extremely\nfast diagnoses. This study utilizes the well-known ADReSS challenge dataset for\nclassifying healthy controls and Alzheimer's patients. The dataset contains\nspeech recordings from a picture description task featuring a kitchen scene,\ncollected from both healthy controls and dementia patients. Unlike most\nstudies, this research does not segment the audio recordings into active speech\nsegments; instead, acoustic features are extracted from entire recordings. The\nstudy employs Ridge linear regression, Extreme Minimal Learning Machine, and\nLinear Support Vector Machine machine learning models to compute feature\nimportance scores based on model outputs. The Ridge model performed best in\nLeave-One-Subject-Out cross-validation, achieving a classification accuracy of\n87.8%. The EMLM model, proved to be effective in both cross-validation and the\nclassification of a separate test dataset, with accuracies of 85.3% and 79.2%,\nrespectively.

Here, we explored the domain specificity of a convolutional\nmodel's pre-training data relative to different downstream speech and\nnon-speech tasks using a self-supervised pre-training approach (BYOL-A). We\nfound that these pre-trained models (regardless of whether they were\npre-trained on speech data, non-speech data or both) enabled good performance\non nearly all downstream tasks, beating or nearly matching the performance of\npopular domain-specific models.

In\npractice this is often studied on a static network snapshot, for example, a\npreferential attachment model assumed to explain the more highly connected\nnodes or a rich-club}effect that analyses the most highly connected nodes. In\nthis paper, we consider temporal measures of how success (measured here as node\ndegree) propagates across time. By analogy with social mobility (a measure\npeople moving within a social hierarchy through their life) we define\nhierarchical mobility to measure how a node's propensity to gain degree changes\nover time. We introduce an associated taxonomy of temporal correlation\nstatistics including mobility, philanthropy and community. Mobility measures\nthe extent to which a node's degree gain in one time period predicts its degree\ngain in the next. Philanthropy and community measure similar properties related\nto node neighbourhood.\n  We apply these statistics both to artificial models and to 26 real temporal\nnetworks. We find that most of our networks show a tendency for individual\nnodes and their neighbourhoods to remain in similar hierarchical positions over\ntime, while most networks show low correlative effects between individuals and\ntheir neighbourhoods. Moreover, we show that the mobility taxonomy can\ndiscriminate between networks from different fields. We also generate\nartificial network models to gain intuition about the behaviour and expected\nrange of the statistics. The artificial models show that the opposite of the\n\"rich-get-richer\" effect requires the existence of inequality of degree in a\nnetwork.

However,\ndue to the verbosity of LLMs, the resulting reasoning chains can be long,\nmaking it harder to verify the reasoning steps and trace issues resulting from\ndependencies between the steps that may be farther away in the sequence of\nsteps. Importantly, mathematical reasoning allows each step to be derived from\na small set of premises, which are a subset of the preceding steps in the\nreasoning chain. In this paper, we present a framework that identifies the\npremises for each step, to improve the evaluation of reasoning. We restructure\nconventional linear reasoning chains into Premise Augmented Reasoning Chains\n(PARC) by introducing premise links, resulting in a directed acyclic graph\nwhere the nodes are the steps and the edges are the premise links. Through\nexperiments with a PARC-based dataset that we built, namely PERL (Premises and\nERrors identification in LLMs), we demonstrate that LLMs can reliably identify\npremises within complex reasoning chains. In particular, even open-source LLMs\nachieve 90% recall in premise identification. We also show that PARC helps to\nidentify errors in reasoning chains more reliably. The accuracy of error\nidentification improves by 6% to 16% absolute when step-by-step verification is\ncarried out in PARC under the premises.

Only a small fraction of the total plastic waste is recycled in\nthis manner, largely due to the significant variability in recycled plastics'\nmechanical properties. This variability stems from compositional fluctuations\nand impurities introduced throughout the materials' lifecycle and the recycling\nprocess, deterring industries with stringent product specifications from\nadopting recycled plastics on a wider scale. To overcome this challenge, we\npropose a composite structure inspired by nacre's microstructure - a natural\nmaterial known for its exceptional mechanical performance despite its inherent\nrandomness across multiple length scales. This bio-inspired design features\nstiff recycled plastic platelets (\"bricks\") within a soft polymeric matrix\n(\"mortar\"). We use a tension-shear-chain model to capture the deformation\nmechanism of the structure, and demonstrate, through a case study of commercial\nstretch wrap, that the proposed design reduces variability in effective elastic\nmodulus by 89.5% and in elongation at break by 42%, while achieving the same\nmodulus as the virgin stretch wrap material. These findings highlight the\npotential of the proposed bio-inspired design to enhance the mechanical\nperformance of recycled plastics, but also demonstrate that a universally\napplicable, chemistry-agnostic approach can substantially broaden their\napplications, paving the way for sustainable plastic waste management.",

While some efforts have aimed to unify motion-related\ntasks, these methods simply use different modalities as conditions to guide\nmotion generation. Consequently, they lack editing capabilities, fine-grained\ncontrol, and fail to facilitate knowledge sharing across tasks. To address\nthese limitations and provide a versatile, unified framework capable of\nhandling both human motion generation and editing, we introduce a novel\nparadigm: \\textbf{Motion-Condition-Motion}, which enables the unified\nformulation of diverse tasks with three concepts: source motion, condition, and\ntarget motion.

In\nMotionLab, we introduce the 1) MotionFlow Transformer to enhance conditional\ngeneration and editing without task-specific modules; 2) Aligned Rotational\nPosition Encoding to guarantee the time synchronization between source motion\nand target motion; 3) Task Specified Instruction Modulation; and 4) Motion\nCurriculum Learning for effective multi-task learning and knowledge sharing\nacross tasks.

    "abstract": "The civil engineering industry faces a critical need for innovative\nnon-destructive evaluation methods, particularly for ageing critical\ninfrastructure, such as bridges, where current techniques fall short.\nMuography, a non-invasive imaging technique, constructs three-dimensional\ndensity maps by detecting interactions of naturally occurring cosmic-ray muons\nwithin the scanned volume. Cosmic-ray muons provide deep penetration and\ninherent safety due to their high momenta and natural source. However, the\ntechnology's reliance on this source results in constrained muon flux, leading\nto prolonged acquisition times, noisy reconstructions and image interpretation\nchallenges. To address these limitations, we developed a two-model deep\nlearning approach. First, we employed a conditional Wasserstein generative\nadversarial network with gradient penalty (cWGAN-GP) to perform predictive\nupsampling of undersampled muography images. Using the Structural Similarity\nIndex Measure (SSIM), 1-day sampled images matched the perceptual qualities of\na 21-day image, while the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) indicated noise\nimprovement equivalent to 31 days of sampling. A second cWGAN-GP model, trained\nfor semantic segmentation, quantitatively assessed the upsampling model's\nimpact on concrete sample features. This model achieved segmentation of rebar\ngrids and tendon ducts, with Dice-S{\\o}rensen accuracy coefficients of 0.8174\nand 0.8663. Notably, it could mitigate or remove z-plane smearing artifacts\ncaused by muography's inverse imaging problem. Both models were trained on a\ncomprehensive Geant4 Monte-Carlo simulation dataset reflecting realistic civil\ninfrastructure scenarios. Our results demonstrate significant improvements in\nacquisition speed and image quality, marking a substantial step toward making\nmuography more practical for reinforced concrete infrastructure monitoring\napplications.",

    "abstract": "The growing frequency of cyberattacks has heightened the demand for accurate\nand efficient threat detection systems. SIEM platforms are important for\nanalyzing log data and detecting adversarial activities through rule-based\nqueries, also known as SIEM rules. The efficiency of the threat analysis\nprocess relies heavily on mapping these SIEM rules to the relevant attack\ntechniques in the MITRE ATT&CK framework. Inaccurate annotation of SIEM rules\ncan result in the misinterpretation of attacks, increasing the likelihood that\nthreats will be overlooked. Existing solutions for annotating SIEM rules with\nMITRE ATT&CK technique labels have notable limitations: manual annotation of\nSIEM rules is both time-consuming and prone to errors, and ML-based approaches\nmainly focus on annotating unstructured free text sources rather than\nstructured data like SIEM rules. Structured data often contains limited\ninformation, further complicating the annotation process and making it a\nchallenging task. To address these challenges, we propose Rule-ATT&CK Mapper\n(RAM), a novel framework that leverages LLMs to automate the mapping of\nstructured SIEM rules to MITRE ATT&CK techniques. RAM's multi-stage pipeline,\nwhich was inspired by the prompt chaining technique, enhances mapping accuracy\nwithout requiring LLM pre-training or fine-tuning. Using the Splunk Security\nContent dataset, we evaluate RAM's performance using several LLMs, including\nGPT-4-Turbo, Qwen, IBM Granite, and Mistral. Our evaluation highlights\nGPT-4-Turbo's superior performance, which derives from its enriched knowledge\nbase, and an ablation study emphasizes the importance of external contextual\nknowledge in overcoming the limitations of LLMs' implicit knowledge for\ndomain-specific tasks. These findings demonstrate RAM's potential in automating\ncybersecurity workflows and provide valuable insights for future advancements\nin this field.",

    "abstract": "In offline reinforcement learning-based recommender systems (RLRS), learning\neffective state representations is crucial for capturing user preferences that\ndirectly impact long-term rewards. However, raw state representations often\ncontain high-dimensional, noisy information and components that are not\ncausally relevant to the reward. Additionally, missing transitions in offline\ndata make it challenging to accurately identify features that are most relevant\nto user satisfaction. To address these challenges, we propose Policy-Guided\nCausal Representation (PGCR), a novel two-stage framework for causal feature\nselection and state representation learning in offline RLRS. In the first\nstage, we learn a causal feature selection policy that generates modified\nstates by isolating and retaining only the causally relevant components (CRCs)\nwhile altering irrelevant components. This policy is guided by a reward\nfunction based on the Wasserstein distance, which measures the causal effect of\nstate components on the reward and encourages the preservation of CRCs that\ndirectly influence user interests. In the second stage, we train an encoder to\nlearn compact state representations by minimizing the mean squared error (MSE)\nloss between the latent representations of the original and modified states,\nensuring that the representations focus on CRCs. We provide a theoretical\nanalysis proving the identifiability of causal effects from interventions,\nvalidating the ability of PGCR to isolate critical state components for\ndecision-making. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PGCR significantly\nimproves recommendation performance, confirming its effectiveness for offline\nRL-based recommender systems.",

The results show that SHIP\nperforms better than existing baseline methods in terms of deductive\ncapabilities while significantly surpassing them in inductive capabilities.\nMoreover, SHIP can effectively combine the two mapping processes to perform\nexcellent inductive reasoning.

    "abstract": "Exploring the photoinduced dynamics of chiral states offers promising avenues\nfor advanced control of condensed matter systems. Photoinduced or photoenhanced\nchirality in 1T-TiSe$_{2}$ has been suggested as a fascinating platform for\noptical manipulation of chiral states. However, the mechanisms underlying\nchirality training and its interplay with the charge density wave (CDW) phase\nremain elusive. Here, we use time-resolved X-ray diffraction (tr-XRD) with\ncircularly polarized pump lasers to probe the photoinduced dynamics of\nchirality in 1T-TiSe$_{2}$. We observe a notable ($\\sim$20%) difference in CDW\nintensity suppression between left- and right-circularly polarized pumps.\nAdditionally, we reveal momentum-resolved circular dichroism arising from\ndomains of different chirality, providing a direct link between CDW and\nchirality. An immediate increase in CDW correlation length upon laser pumping\nis detected, suggesting the photoinduced expansion of chiral domains. These\nresults both advance the potential of light-driven chirality by elucidating the\nmechanism driving chirality manipulation in TiSe$_2$, and they demonstrate that\ntr-XRD with circularly polarized pumps is an effective tool for chirality\ndetection in condensed matter systems.",

However, this may not be practical in many industrial\napplications. Here, we demonstrate in experiments of quasi-2D silo discharge of\nmonodisperse grains that the flow rate can be modulated by rotating the orifice\n- through elevating and shifting one side of the base - instead of tilting the\nentire silo. We use high-speed image analysis to track the average motion of\ngrains in the silo. We first show that the flow rate decreases with orifice\nangle, but that this decrease is not as strong as when a silo is tilted or when\na lateral orifice is used. However, with the addition of a grain-sized ridge on\neach side of the orifice, the flow rate collapses with prior tilted-silo\nresults. We then characterize the flow velocity of grains exiting the orifice\nand highlight key features of the stagnant zones and slip zones on each orifice\nside. Finally, we model our results based on these measurements, demonstrating\nthe importance of horizontal creep along slip zones next to the orifice and the\nnarrowest opening cross-section through which the material flows. These\nfindings reveal a simple method for controlling both flow rate and direction,\nand highlight the importance of both dynamics within and geometry of the\nstagnant zones near the orifice.",

The system consists of a transmit\nuser, a receive base station (BS), an IRS, and multiple targets in either the\nfar-field or near-field region of the IRS. In particular, we focus on the\nchallenging scenario where the line-of-sight (LOS) paths between targets and\nthe BS are blocked, such that the emitted orthogonal frequency division\nmultiplexing (OFDM) signals from the user reach the BS merely via the\nuser-target-IRS-BS path. Based on the signals received by the BS, our goal is\nto localize the targets by estimating their relative positions to the IRS,\ninstead of to the BS. We show that subspace-based methods, such as the multiple\nsignal classification (MUSIC) algorithm, can be applied onto the BS's received\nsignals to estimate the relative states from the targets to the IRS. To this\nend, we create a virtual signal via combining user-target-IRS-BS channels over\nvarious time slots. By applying MUSIC on such a virtual signal, we are able to\ndetect the far-field targets and the near-field targets, and estimate the\nangle-of-arrivals (AOAs) and/or ranges from the targets to the IRS.\nFurthermore, we theoretically verify that the proposed method can perfectly\nestimate the relative states from the targets to the IRS in the ideal case with\ninfinite coherence blocks.

Therefore, the measurement of such observables\nin future experiments at the upgraded up to 22 GeV CEBAF facility in the\nnear-threshold energy region might shed light both on the $\\psi(2S)N$\nabsorption cross section and on its part associated with the nondiagonal\nprocess $\\psi(2S)+N \\to J/\\psi+N$ at finite momenta, which are of crucial\nimportance in understanding of charmonium production and suppression in\nhigh-energy nucleus--nucleus collisions in a search for the quark-gluon plasma.",

However, its reliance on sparse Structure-from-Motion (SfM)\npoint clouds often limits scene reconstruction quality. To address the\nlimitation, this paper proposes a novel 3D reconstruction framework, Gaussian\nProcesses enhanced Gaussian Splatting (GP-GS), in which a multi-output Gaussian\nProcess model is developed to enable adaptive and uncertainty-guided\ndensification of sparse SfM point clouds. Specifically, we propose a dynamic\nsampling and filtering pipeline that adaptively expands the SfM point clouds by\nleveraging GP-based predictions to infer new candidate points from the input 2D\npixels and depth maps. The pipeline utilizes uncertainty estimates to guide the\npruning of high-variance predictions, ensuring geometric consistency and\nenabling the generation of dense point clouds. These densified point clouds\nprovide high-quality initial 3D Gaussians, enhancing reconstruction\nperformance. Extensive experiments conducted on synthetic and real-world\ndatasets across various scales validate the effectiveness and practicality of\nthe proposed framework.",

After a strong contraction, matter gains the equation of\nstate close to the one of radiation, such that the effect on matter on the\nevolution of the FLRW metric disappears at the classical level. However, this\neffect comes back owing to the quantum trace anomaly in the matter/radiation\nsector. In the present contribution, we explore the weak impact of massive\nfields on the anomaly-driven bounce solution and discuss the role of the vacuum\nterms. The masses are assumed small and regarded as small perturbations, which\nenables using trace anomaly even in this case. On the other hand, by adding the\n$R^2$ term to the action, we arrive at the model with the trans-Planckian\nbounce and subsequent Starobinsky inflation.

In\nparticular, $\\mathcal{C}$ is minimal if $\\Omega$ is cutting, i.e., every\nhyperplane is spanned by its intersection with $\\Omega$. Minimal linear codes\nhave important applications for secret sharing schemes and secure two-party\ncomputation. In this article we first investigate the properties of some\nalgebraic hypersurfaces $\\mathcal{V}_{\\varepsilon}^r$ related to certain\nquasi-Hermitian varieties of $\\mathrm{PG}(r,q^2)$, with $q=2^e$, $e>1$ odd.\nThese varieties give rise to a new infinite family of linear codes which are\nminimal except for $r=3$ and $e\\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$.

As a byproduct, we obtain $(r+1)$-dimensional codes with just\n$3$ non-zero weights. We point out that linear codes with few weights are also\nimportant in authentication codes and association schemes. In the last part of\nthe paper we consider an extension of the notion of being cutting with respect\nto subspaces other than hyperplanes and introduce the definition of cutting gap\nin order to characterize and measure what happens when this property is not\nsatisfied.

    "abstract": "Physical reservoir computing has emerged as a powerful framework for\nexploiting the inherent nonlinear dynamics of physical systems to perform\ncomputational tasks. Recently, we presented the magnon-scattering reservoir,\nwhose internal nodes are given by the fundamental wave-like excitations of\nferromagnets called magnons. These excitations can be geometrically-quantized\nand, in response to an external stimulus, show transient nonlinear scattering\ndynamics that can be harnessed to perform memory and nonlinear transformation\ntasks. Here, we test a magnon-scattering reservoir in a single magnetic disk in\nthe vortex state towards two key performance indicators for physical reservoir\ncomputing, the short-term memory and parity-check tasks. Using time-resolved\nBrillouin light scattering microscopy, we measure the evolution of the\nreservoir's spectral response to an input sequence consisting of random binary\ninputs encoded in microwave pulses with two distinct frequencies. Two different\noutput spaces of the reservoir are defined, one based on the time-averaged\nfrequency spectra and another based on temporal multiplexing. Our results\ndemonstrate that the memory and nonlinear transformation capability do not\ndepend on the chosen read-out scheme as long as the dimension of the output\nspace is large enough to capture all nonlinear features provided by the\nmagnon-magnon interactions. This further shows that solely the nonlinear\nmagnons in the physical system, not the read-out, determine the reservoir's\ncapacity.",

Operating on the Skarstrom cycle, the porous\nadsorbent columns of a PSA system alternate between adsorption and desorption\nphases to selectively enrich the desired component in a gas mixture. The\ncurrent work presents a robust and generalizable digital twin CFD model of a\nPSA system that can significantly help in design and device characterization.\nUsing an axisymmetric representation, the digital twin accurately mimics all\nthe key components of an air separation plant, including the air reservoir,\nadsorbent columns, product buffer tank, pressure regulator, solenoidal valves,\nand mesh filters. The model simulates the flow and adsorption processes in the\nsystem by solving the conservation equations for mass, momentum, energy, and\nspecies, along with the equation for adsorption kinetics. The cyclic operation\nof the PSA plants, typically controlled by solenoid valves, is emulated by\ndynamically modifying the boundary conditions of different subdomains. Such an\nintegrated approach is shown here to closely replicate the performance of an\nin-house PSA pilot setup producing oxygen in terms of purity and pressure\ntransience. Also, both the numerical and the experimental results yield an\noptimum performance for the same process parameters, such as pressurization\ntime (26 s), purge time (2 s), and equalization time (4 s). The proposed\nnumerical model is versatile and can be adapted to various industrial\napplications of PSA technology, such as hydrogen purification and carbon\ncapture. Thus, it offers a cost-effective tool for designing and optimizing PSA\nsystems.",

Next, our layerwise analysis of\npre-trained attention maps uncovers that: (1) There are three typical attention\npatterns (local, hybrid, and global); (2) Pre-training tasks notably influence\nthe pattern distribution across layers; (3) The hybrid pattern is crucial for\nsemantic segmentation as it attends to both nearby and foreground elements; (4)\nThe texture bias impedes model generalization in infrared tasks. Building on\nthese insights, we propose UNIP, a UNified Infrared Pre-training framework, to\nenhance the pre-trained model performance. This framework uses the\nhybrid-attention distillation NMI-HAD as the pre-training target, a large-scale\nmixed dataset InfMix for pre-training, and a last-layer feature pyramid network\nLL-FPN for fine-tuning. Experimental results show that UNIP outperforms various\npre-training methods by up to 13.5\\% in average mIoU on three infrared\nsegmentation tasks, evaluated using fine-tuning and linear probing metrics.\nUNIP-S achieves performance on par with MAE-L while requiring only 1/10 of the\ncomputational cost. Furthermore, UNIP significantly surpasses state-of-the-art\n(SOTA) infrared or RGB segmentation methods and demonstrates broad potential\nfor application in other modalities, such as RGB and depth.

In this theory, two\n  immiscible and incompressible fluids flowing in a porous medium are treated\nas\n  an effective fluid, substituting the two interacting subsystems for a\n  single system with an effective viscosity and pressure gradient. In assuming\n  Euler homogeneity of the total volumetric flow rate and comparing the\n  resulting first order partial differential equation to the total volumetric\n  flow rate in the porous medium, one can introduce of a novel\n  velocity that relates the two pairs of velocities. This velocity, the\n  co-moving velocity, describes the mutual co-carrying of fluids due to\n  immiscibility effects and interactions between the fluid clusters and the\nporous medium\n  itself.

For a fixed dissipation rate, there is a distinct speed-accuracy\nPareto front traversed by the scarcity of resources: scarcer resources lead to\nslower speed but more accurate synchronization. Increasing energy dissipation\neases this tradeoff by pushing the speed-accuracy Pareto front outwards.

As a consequence, it is normally carried out manually by designers in\nclose collaboration with end-users. The goal of this work is to check whether\nLLMs can act as facilitators for the refinement task, so as to let it be\ncarried out entirely -- or mostly -- by end-users. The Dimensional Fact Model\nis the target formalism for our study; as a representative LLM, we use\nChatGPT's model GPT-4o. To achieve our goal, we formulate three research\nquestions aimed at (i) understanding the basic competences of ChatGPT in\nmultidimensional modeling; (ii) understanding the basic competences of ChatGPT\nin refinement; and (iii) investigating if the latter can be improved via prompt\nengineering. The results of our experiments show that, indeed, a careful prompt\nengineering can significantly improve the accuracy of refinement, and that the\nresidual errors can quickly be fixed via one additional prompt.

This is enabled by high anisotropy FePt media,\nwhich needs to be heated through its Curie temperature ($T_C$) to facilitate\nmagnetization reversal by an electromagnetic write pole. HAMR micromagnetic\nmodeling is therefore challenging, as it needs to be performed in proximity to\nand above $T_C$, where a ferromagnet has no spontaneous magnetization. An\natomistic model is an optimal solution here, as it doesn't require any\nparameter renormalization or non-physical assumptions for modeling at any\ntemperature.

Here we demonstrate a true multiscale HAMR modeling\napproach, combining atomistic spin dynamics modeling for high temperature\nregions and micromagnetic modeling for lower temperature regions, in a moving\nsimulation window embedded within a long magnetic track. The advantages of this\napproach include natural emergence of $T_C$ and anisotropy distributions of\nFePt grains.

LLM watermarking has been\nproposed to trace unauthorized redistribution or resale of generated content by\nembedding identifiers within the text. Existing approaches primarily rely on\none-bit watermarking, which only verifies whether a text was generated by a\nspecific LLM. In contrast, multi-bit watermarking encodes richer information,\nenabling the identification of the specific LLM and user involved in generated\nor distributed content. However, current multi-bit methods directly embed the\nwatermark into the text without considering its watermark capacity, which can\nresult in failures, especially in low-entropy texts.

We then derive a\nformal inequality to optimally segment the text for watermark embedding.\nBuilding upon this, we propose DERMARK, a dynamic, efficient, and robust\nmulti-bit watermarking method that divides the text into variable-length\nsegments for each watermark bit during the inference. Moreover, DERMARK incurs\nnegligible overhead since no additional intermediate matrices are generated and\nachieves robustness against text editing by minimizing watermark extraction\nloss.

The\nrole of host interaction network topology in the emergence and spatial\ndiffusion of these highly contagious strains is analyzed, as well as how\nnetwork-based interventions can help mitigate their spread. To address these\nissues, we present simplified mathematical models that qualitatively describe\nthe occurrence, propagation, and impact of such mutations within\nhost-interaction networks. By incorporating the topology of the host network\ninto the analysis, a more advanced framework is proposed to curb the growth of\nmutant strains. Extensive numerical simulations of these models offer insights\ninto the mechanisms driving viral evolution, the dynamics of contagion, and the\ntopological influence of host networks on viral spread and containment\nstrategies.",

    "abstract": "CrSb has recently gained immense attention as an altermagnetic candidate.\nThis work reports on the experimental observation of direction-dependent\nconduction polarity (DDCP) in altermagnetic CrSb through Hall and Seebeck\nthermopower measurements. Conduction is dominated by holes along the c-axis and\nby electrons in the ab-plane of the hexagonal crystal of CrSb. Density\nfunctional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that DDCP in CrSb arises from a\nmulticarrier mechanism, where electrons and holes living in distinct bands\ndominate conduction along different crystallographic directions. Furthermore,\nDFT predicts that DDCP exists within a narrow energy window near the Fermi\nlevel and is sensitive to small doping levels. This prediction is\nexperimentally validated by the loss of DDCP in hole-doped\nCr$_{0.98}$V$_{0.02}$Sb. These findings highlight the potential for tunable\nelectronic behavior in CrSb, offering promising avenues for applications in\ndevices that require both p-type and n-type functionalities within a single\nmaterial.",

Typical incident responses\nrely very much on the log information captured by the system during the attacks\nand if needed, may need to isolate the victim from the network to avoid further\ndestructive attacks. However, there are real cases that there are insufficient\nlog records/information for the incident response team to identify the attacks\nand their origins while the attacked system cannot be stopped due to service\nrequirements (zero downtime online systems) such as online gaming sites.\nTypical incident response procedures and industrial standards do not provide an\nadequate solution to address this scenario. In this paper, being motivated by a\nreal case, we propose a solution, called \"Attack-Driven Incident Response and\nDefense System (ADIRDS)\" to tackle this problem. ADIRDS is an online monitoring\nsystem to run with the real system. By modeling the real system as a graph,\ncritical nodes/assets of the system are closely monitored. Instead of relying\non the original logging system, evidence will be collected from the attack\ntechnique perspectives. To migrate the risks, realistic honeypots with very\nsimilar business context as the real system are deployed to trap the attackers.\nWe successfully apply this system to a real case. Based on our experiments, we\nverify that our new approach of designing the realistic honeypots is effective,\n38 unique attacker's IP addresses were captured. We also compare the\nperformance of our realistic honey with both low and high interactive honeypots\nproposed in the literature, the results found that our proposed honeypot can\nsuccessfully cheat the attackers to attack our honeypot, which verifies that\nour honeypot is more effective.",

    "abstract": "Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) is a method for measuring a subjects heart\nrate remotely using a camera. Factors such as subject movement, ambient light\nlevel, makeup etc. complicate such measurements by distorting the observed\npulse. Recent works on this topic have proposed a variety of approaches for\naccurately measuring heart rate in humans, however these methods were tested in\nideal conditions, where the subject does not make significant movements and all\nmeasurements are taken at the same level of illumination. In more realistic\nconditions these methods suffer from decreased accuracy. The study proposes a\nmore robust method that is less susceptible to distortions and has minimal\nhardware requirements. The proposed method uses a combination of mathematical\ntransforms to calculate the subjects heart rate. It performs best when used\nwith a camera that has been modified by removing its infrared filter, although\nusing an unmodified camera is also possible. The method was tested on 26 videos\ntaken from 19 volunteers of varying gender and age.

However,\nclassical metrics, such as the Total Variation and the Wasserstein distances,\nare known to have high sample complexities and, therefore, may fail to provide\na meaningful distinction in many practical scenarios.\n  In this paper, we propose a new notion of distance, the Maximum Subgroup\nDiscrepancy (MSD).

    "abstract": "Achieving digital fairness by using NOMA is one of the more pressing issues\nin modern wireless communication systems for 5G/6G networks. This is\nparticularly true in the case of satellite uplink systems supporting a\npopulation of IoT wireless devices scattered in a wide coverage area. In this\nscenario, the variability of the link budget across space and time increases\nthe challenges of preventing a situation where only a subset of network users\ncan transmit while others are left unable to do so. This work investigates the\ncharacteristics of an uplink NOMA system with the goal of equalizing the\nachievable rate of the IoT network subscribers. Within the context of\nsingle-slot NOMA, two key outcomes are achieved: the determination of the\noptimal SIC ordering at the receiver and the exploration of power moderation,\ncoordinated by the receiver, to maximize the minimum user rate. In the context\nof multi-slot NOMA, which is particularly relevant to the satellite scenario\nunder consideration, a user rate equalization algorithm is proposed and its\nperformance is analyzed numerically. The trade-off between network performance,\nmeasured in terms of user rates, and complexity, determined by the number of\nSIC steps implemented at the receiver, is thoroughly evaluated for the\nsatellite scenario under consideration.",

In this paper, direct\nnumerical simulations of the intermittent reversals of the LSC in a\ntwo-dimensional square domain are performed, and the time series of the total\nangular momentum indicating the rotational direction of the LSC is predicted by\nreservoir computing whose input consists of the shear rates and temperatures at\nsix locations on the sidewalls. The total angular momentum in the simulation\nafter times shorter than half the typical duration of the quasi-stable states\nis successfully reproduced by the locally-measurable quantities on the\nsidewalls because the secondary rolls accompanied by the boundary flow\ncharacterize the reversal of the LSC. The successful prediction by such sparse\ninput derived from local measurements on the sidewalls demonstrates that the\nreservoir computing prediction of the reversal is feasible in laboratory\nexperiments and industrial applications. On the other hand, long-term\nprediction often provides the total angular momentum opposite in sign to the\none in the simulations in the late parts of long quasi-stable states. The\nstatistical independence of each reversal implies that the prediction after the\nreversal is difficult or even impossible, and the training data in the late\npart in the long quasi-stable state, which rarely appears, is contaminated by\nthe statistically-independent angular momentum in the subsequent quasi-stable\nstate.",

However, the naive application of DMs presents several key\nlimitations. (i) The diffusion prior has inferior semantic consistency (e.g.,\nID, structure and color.), increasing the difficulty of optimizing the BFR\nmodel; (ii) reliance on hundreds of denoising iterations, preventing the\neffective cooperation with perceptual losses, which is crucial for faithful\nrestoration. Observing that the latent consistency model (LCM) learns\nconsistency noise-to-data mappings on the ODE-trajectory and therefore shows\nmore semantic consistency in the subject identity, structural information and\ncolor preservation, we propose InterLCM to leverage the LCM for its superior\nsemantic consistency and efficiency to counter the above issues. Treating\nlow-quality images as the intermediate state of LCM, InterLCM achieves a\nbalance between fidelity and quality by starting from earlier LCM steps. LCM\nalso allows the integration of perceptual loss during training, leading to\nimproved restoration quality, particularly in real-world scenarios. To mitigate\nstructural and semantic uncertainties, InterLCM incorporates a Visual Module to\nextract visual features and a Spatial Encoder to capture spatial details,\nenhancing the fidelity of restored images.

These intergrowth compounds crystallize in a mixture of 2$H$\nhexagonal (Ce$_{2}$Ni$_{7}$-type) and 3$R$ rhombohedral (Gd$_{2}$Co$_{7}$-type)\npolymorphic structures which are related to the stacking of [$AB_{5}$] and\n[$A_{2}B_{4}$] subunits along the $c$-axis.The average cell volume decreases\nlinearly versus $A$' content, whereas the $c/a$ ratio reaches a minimum at $x$\n= 1, due to geometric constraints upon $A$' for La substitution between the two\ndifferent subunits. The magnetic properties strongly depend on the structure\ntype and the $A$' content. Hexagonal La$_{2}$Ni$_{7}$ is a weak antiferromagnet\n(wAFM) at low field and temperature and undergoes metamagnetic transitions\ntowards weak ferromagnetic state (wFM) under applied field. Under an applied\nfield of 0.1 T, La$_{2-x}A'_{x}$Ni$_{7}$ intermetallic compounds display two\ndifferent transition temperatures $T_{1}$ and $T_{2}$ that both increase with\n$x$. $T_{1}$ is associated with a wFM-wAFM transition in the 2$H$ phase for\n$A$'= Sm, whereas $T_{2}$ is related to the Curie temperature of both 2$H$ and\n3$R$ phases. A metamagnetic behaviour is observed between $T_{1}$ and $T_{2}$\nwith transition field $\\mu_{0}H_{Trans}$ between 2 and 3.5 T for compounds with\n$A$' = Sm.

The standard framework of contrastive learning minimizes the distance\nbetween \"similar\" instances and maximizes the distance between dissimilar ones\nin the projection space, disregarding the various aspects of similarity that\ncan exist between two samples. Current methods rely on a single projection\nhead, which fails to capture the full complexity of different aspects of a\nsample, leading to suboptimal performance, especially in scenarios with limited\ntraining data.

Those distortions may be\nnon-linear, their inverse functions may be ill-defined and unstable; they may\neven vary from one day to the next, and across the sample.

Neural operators (NOs) have been\neffectively used for rapid MT forward modeling, demonstrating their promising\nperformance in solving the MT forward modeling-related partial differential\nequations (PDEs). Particularly, they can obtain the electromagnetic field at\narbitrary locations and frequencies. In these NOs, the projection layers have\nbeen dominated by multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs), which may potentially reduce\nthe accuracy of solution due to they usually suffer from the disadvantages of\nMLPs, such as lack of interpretability, overfitting, and so on. Therefore, to\nimprove the accuracy of MT forward modeling with NOs and explore the potential\nalternatives to MLPs, we propose a novel neural operator by extending the\nFourier neural operator (FNO) with Kolmogorov-Arnold network (EFKAN). Within\nthe EFKAN framework, the FNO serves as the branch network to calculate the\napparent resistivity and phase from the resistivity model in the frequency\ndomain. Meanwhile, the KAN acts as the trunk network to project the resistivity\nand phase, determined by the FNO, to the desired locations and frequencies.\nExperimental results demonstrate that the proposed method not only achieves\nhigher accuracy in obtaining apparent resistivity and phase compared to the NO\nequipped with MLPs at the desired frequencies and locations but also\noutperforms traditional numerical methods in terms of computational speed.",

For optimal error rates, the right choice of the main parameters,\nnamely the length of the Bloom filter array, the number of hash functions used\nto map an element to the array's indices, and the number of elements to be\ninserted in one filter, is crucial. However, these parameters are constrained:\nThe number of hash functions is bounded to integer values, and the length of a\nBloom filter is usually chosen to be a power-of-two to allow for efficient\nmodulo operations using binary arithmetics.

    "abstract": "Novel materials drive progress across applications from energy storage to\nelectronics. Automated characterization of material structures with machine\nlearning methods offers a promising strategy for accelerating this key step in\nmaterial design. In this work, we introduce an autoregressive language model\nthat performs crystal structure prediction (CSP) from powder diffraction data.\nThe presented model, deCIFer, generates crystal structures in the widely used\nCrystallographic Information File (CIF) format and can be conditioned on powder\nX-ray diffraction (PXRD) data. Unlike earlier works that primarily rely on\nhigh-level descriptors like composition, deCIFer is also able to use\ndiffraction data to perform CSP. We train deCIFer on nearly 2.3M crystal\nstructures and validate on diverse sets of PXRD patterns for characterizing\nchallenging inorganic crystal systems. Qualitative checks and quantitative\nassessments using the residual weighted profile show that deCIFer produces\nstructures that more accurately match the target diffraction data. Notably,\ndeCIFer can achieve a 94% match rate on test data. deCIFer bridges experimental\ndiffraction data with computational CSP, lending itself as a powerful tool for\ncrystal structure characterization.",

A quantum autoencoder approach\nhas been used for compression purposes. However, existing autoencoders are\nlimited to small-scale images, and the mechanisms of state compression remain\nunclear. There is also a need for efficient quantum autoencoders using standard\nrepresentation approaches and for studying parameterized position-aware control\nqubits and their corresponding quality measurement metrics. This work\nintroduces a novel parameterized position-aware lossy quantum autoencoder\n(PALQA) circuit that utilizes the least significant bit control qubit for image\ncompression. The PALQA circuit employs a transformed coefficient block-based\nmodified state connection approach to efficiently compress images at various\nresolutions. The method leverages compression opportunities in the state-label\nconnection by applying position-aware least significant control qubit. Compared\nto JPEG and other enhanced quantum representation-based quantum autoencoders,\nthe PALQA circuit demonstrates superior performance in terms of the number of\ngates required and PSNR metrics.",

The goal of this work is to\ndevelop a grid-based machine learning tool capable of determining the stellar\nradius, mass, and age using only atmospheric constraints and to analyse the age\ndistribution of stars hosting giant planets. Our machine learning approach\ninvolves combining four tree-based machine learning algorithms (Random Forest,\nExtra Trees, Extreme Gradient Boosting, and CatBoost) trained on a grid of\nstellar models to infer stellar radius, mass, and age using Teff, [Fe/H], and\nluminosities. We perform a detailed statistical analysis to compare the\ninferences of our tool with those based on seismic data from the APOKASC and\nLEGACY samples. Finally, we apply our tool to determine the ages of stars\nhosting giant planets. Comparing the stellar parameter inferences from our\nmachine learning tool with those from the APOKASC and LEGACY, we find a bias\n(and a scatter) of -0.5\\% (5\\%) and -0.2\\% (2\\%) in radius, 6\\% (5\\%) per cent\nand -2\\% (3\\%) in mass, and -9\\% (16\\%) and 7\\% (23\\%) in age, respectively.\nTherefore, our machine learning predictions are commensurate with seismic\ninferences.

These\nstatistical ages of the host stars confirm previous predictions - based on\nstellar model ages for a relatively small number of hosts, as well as on the\naverage age-velocity dispersion relation - that stars hosting Hot Jupiters are\nstatistically younger than those hosting Warm and Cold Jupiters.",

    "abstract": "Context. Technical Debt (TD), defined as software constructs that are\nbeneficial in the short term but may hinder future change, is a frequently used\nterm in software development practice. Nevertheless, practitioners do not\nalways fully understand its definition and, in particular, conceptual model.\nPrevious research highlights that communication about TD is challenging,\nespecially with non-technical stakeholders. Discussions on this topic often\ncause conflicts due to misunderstandings related to other stakeholders'\nperspectives. Goal. We designed a board game to emulate TD concepts to make\nthem tangible to all stakeholders, including non-technical ones. The game aims\nto encourage discussions about TD in an emulated and safe environment, thereby\navoiding real-life conflicts. Method. To evaluate the game's effectiveness, we\nsurveyed 46 practitioners from diverse domains, positions, and experience\nlevels who played the game in 13 sessions following extensive testing during\nits development. In addition to the players' general feedback, we examined\nsituations where players recognized new insights about TD or connected game\nscenarios to real-life experiences. Results. Overall, the feedback on the game\nand its enjoyment factor were highly positive. While developers and software\narchitects often connected game situations to their real-world experiences,\nnon-technical stakeholders, such as scrum masters, product owners, and less\nexperienced developers, encountered multiple new insights on TD. Numerous\nplayers have shifted their attitudes toward TD and have outlined a plan to\nmodify their behavior regarding TD management. Conclusions. Although the game\nmay not lead to long-term behavior change among stakeholders, participants'\nfeedback provides evidence that it might serve as a valuable starting point for\nteam discussions on technical debt management.",

From the static camera feed, EditIQ initially generates multiple\nvirtual feeds, emulating a team of cameramen. These virtual camera shots termed\nrushes are subsequently assembled using an automated editing algorithm, whose\nobjective is to present the viewer with the most vivid scene content. To\nunderstand key scene elements and guide the editing process, we employ a\ntwo-pronged approach: (1) a large language model (LLM)-based dialogue\nunderstanding module to analyze conversational flow, coupled with (2) visual\nsaliency prediction to identify meaningful scene elements and camera shots\ntherefrom. We then formulate cinematic video editing as an energy minimization\nproblem over shot selection, where cinematic constraints determine shot\nchoices, transitions, and continuity. EditIQ synthesizes an aesthetically and\nvisually compelling representation of the original narrative while maintaining\ncinematic coherence and a smooth viewing experience. Efficacy of EditIQ against\ncompeting baselines is demonstrated via a psychophysical study involving twenty\nparticipants on the BBC Old School dataset plus eleven theatre performance\nvideos.

We address the long-standing limitation of\nremote sensing to penetrate deep into dense canopy layers. LiDAR and radar are\ncurrently considered the primary options for measuring 3D vegetation\nstructures, while cameras can only extract the reflectance and depth of top\nlayers. Using conventional, high-resolution aerial images, our approach allows\nsensing deep into self-occluding vegetation volumes, such as forests. It is\nsimilar in spirit to the imaging process of wide-field microscopy, but can\nhandle much larger scales and strong occlusion. We scan focal stacks by\nsynthetic-aperture imaging with drones and reduce out-of-focus signal\ncontributions using pre-trained 3D convolutional neural networks with mean\nsquared error (MSE) as the loss function. The resulting volumetric reflectance\nstacks contain low-frequency representations of the vegetation volume.\nCombining multiple reflectance stacks from various spectral channels provides\ninsights into plant health, growth, and environmental conditions throughout the\nentire vegetation volume.

Existing correspondence refinement methods mostly follow the\nparadigm of outlier removal, which either fails to correctly identify the\naccurate correspondences under extreme outlier ratios, or select too few\ncorrect correspondences to support robust registration. To address this\nchallenge, we propose a novel approach named Regor, which is a progressive\ncorrespondence regenerator that generates higher-quality matches whist\nsufficiently robust for numerous outliers. In each iteration, we first apply\nprior-guided local grouping and generalized mutual matching to generate the\nlocal region correspondences.

Further, we employ global correspondence refinement to obtain accurate\ncorrespondences from a global perspective. Through progressive iterations, this\nprocess yields a large number of high-quality correspondences. Extensive\nexperiments on both indoor and outdoor datasets demonstrate that the proposed\nRegor significantly outperforms existing outlier removal techniques.

The majority (>54%) of the high-mass stars constitute a non-clustered\ndistributed stellar population.

    "abstract": "In the framework of extended thermodynamics, where the cosmological constant\n$\\Lambda$ plays the role of a dynamical pressure $p$, its conjugate variable\n$V$ arises naturally. This makes it possible to define $C_p$ and $C_V$, the\nheat capacities at constant pressure and volume, respectively. We extend our\nprevious work on the heat capacities of the static ``quantum\" version of the\nBTZ black hole defined on a braneworld model to the case where the black hole\nis rotating. The extra degree of freedom that rotation grants the system\nimparts it with infinite families of both $C_p$ and $C_V$. We find exact\nformulae for these heat capacities as functions of the three dimensionless\nparameters of the theory, and explore some special cases in detail. In all\ncases considered, at least two physically realizable branches were observed,\nincluding both positive and negative heat capacities, signaling both stable and\nunstable black holes, respectively. Though the critical point seen in the\nstatic case disappears, other interesting points arise where the heat\ncapacities diverge. Finally, we discuss the conjectured connection in the\nliterature between the super-entropicity of a black hole and its instability,\nthough much like in the static case, the exact relationship, if any, remains\nunclear.",

However,\nthe guidance of flow matching is more general than and thus substantially\ndifferent from that of its predecessor, diffusion models. Therefore, the\nchallenge in guidance for general flow matching remains largely underexplored.\nIn this paper, we propose the first framework of general guidance for flow\nmatching. From this framework, we derive a family of guidance techniques that\ncan be applied to general flow matching.

In order to facilitate the flexible resource\nutilization of SAGIN, the network function virtualization technology (NFV) is\nproposed to be employed. Firstly, the task management is transformed into the\ndeployment of service function chains (SFCs). Then, we design an NFV-based SFC\nrecovery model in SAGIN in the face of resource failure, so that tasks can\nquickly select alternative resources to complete deployments. Moreover, the\nproblem of SFC recovery is formulated to minimize the total time consumption\nfor all completed SFCs. Since it is an NP-hard integer linear programming\nproblem, we propose the efficient recovery algorithm based on the matching\ngame. Finally, via various simulations, the effectiveness of the proposed\nalgorithm and its advantages are verified, where the total time consumption is\noptimized by about 25%, compared with other benchmark methods.",

    "abstract": "Context. Binary systems can be born surrounded by circumbinary discs. The\ngaseous discs surrounding either of the two stellar companions can have their\nlife extended by the supply of mass arriving from the circumbinary disc. Aims.\nThe objective of this study is to investigate the gravitational interactions\nexerted by a compact and eccentric binary system on the circumbinary and\ncircumprimary discs, and the resulting transport of gas and solids between the\ndisc components. Methods. We assume that the gas in the system behaves as a\nfluid and model its evolution by means of high resolution hydrodynamical\nsimulations. Dust grains are modeled as Lagrangian particles that interact with\nthe gas and the stars. Results. Models indicate that significant fluxes of gas\nand dust proceed from the circumbinary disc toward the circumprimary disc. For\nthe applied system parameters, grains of certain sizes are segregated outside\nthe tidal gap generated by the stars. Consequently, the size distribution of\nthe transported dust is not continuous but it presents a gap in the mm size\nrange. In close binaries, the lifetime of an isolated circumprimary disc is\nfound to be short, approximately 10 5 years, because of its small mass.\nHowever, because of the influx of gas from beyond the tidal gap, the disc\naround the primary star can survive much longer, about 10 6 years, as long as\ngas accretion from the circumbinary disc continues. The supply of solids and\nthe extended lifetime of a circumbinary disc also aids in the possible\nformation of giant planets. Compared to close binary systems without a\ncircumbinary disc, we expect a higher frequency of single- or multiple- planet\nsystems. Additionally, a planetesimal or debris belt can form in proximity of\nthe truncation radius of the circumprimary disc and/or around the location of\nthe exterior edge of the tidal gap.",

    "abstract": "In modern optimization methods used in deep learning, each update depends on\nthe history of previous iterations, often referred to as memory, and this\ndependence decays fast as the iterates go further into the past. For example,\ngradient descent with momentum has exponentially decaying memory through\nexponentially averaged past gradients. We introduce a general technique for\nidentifying a memoryless algorithm that approximates an optimization algorithm\nwith memory. It is obtained by replacing all past iterates in the update by the\ncurrent one, and then adding a correction term arising from memory (also a\nfunction of the current iterate). This correction term can be interpreted as a\nperturbation of the loss, and the nature of this perturbation can inform how\nmemory implicitly (anti-)regularizes the optimization dynamics. As an\napplication of our theory, we find that Lion does not have the kind of implicit\nanti-regularization induced by memory that AdamW does, providing a theory-based\nexplanation for Lion's better generalization performance recently documented.",

    "abstract": "Context. The localized formation of planetesimals can be triggered with the\nhelp of streaming instability when the local pebble density is high. This can\nhappen at various locations in the disk leading to the formation of local\nplanetesimal rings. The planetesimals in these rings subsequently grow from\nmutual collisions and by pebble accretion. Aims. We investigate the early\ngrowth of protoplanetary embryos from a ring of planetesimals created from\nstreaming instability to see if they reach sizes where they accrete pebbles\nefficiently. Methods. We simulate the early stages of planet formation for\nrings of planetesimals that we assume were created by streaming instability at\nvarious separations from the star and for various stellar masses using a\nsemi-analytic model. Results. The rings in the inner disk are able to produce\nprotoplanetary embryos in a short time whereas at large separations there is\nlittle to no growth. The growth of the largest bodies is significantly slower\naround lower-mass stars. Conclusions. The formation of planetary embryos from\nfilaments during the disk lifetime is possible but strongly dependent on the\nseparation from the star and the mass of the host star. It remains difficult to\nform the seeds of pebble accretion early in the outer disk \\sim 50AU,\nespecially for low-mass stars.",

Here, we show that electronic structure of the prototypical kagome\nmetal, Fe$_3$Sn$_2$, can be tailored by manipulating the breathing distortion\nof its kagome lattice with external pressure. The breathing distortion is\nsuppressed around 15 GPa and reversed at higher pressures. These changes lead\nto a series of Lifshitz transitions that we detect using broadband and\ntransient optical spectroscopy. Remarkably, the strength of the electronic\ncorrelations and the tendency to carrier localization are enhanced as the\nkagome network becomes more regular, suggesting that breathing distortion can\nbe a unique control parameter for the microscopic regime of the kagome metals\nand their electron dynamics.",

Molecular diffusion in DESs stems from\ntransient caging and translation jumps, necessitating an understanding of how\nmolecular structure regulates these processes. This study explores the\ninfluence of alkyl chain length on the nanoscopic dynamics of\nalkylamide-lithium perchlorate based DESs using quasielastic neutron scattering\n(QENS) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. QENS results show that, despite\nits shorter chain length and lighter mass, acetamide (ACM) exhibited the lowest\nmobility among the alkylamides, including propanamide (PRM) and butyramide\n(BUT). Detailed analysis of QENS data reveals that long-range jump diffusion is\nfastest in ACM and slowest in BUT, essentially due to their differences in\nmolecular size, mass and also enhanced complexation in longer alkyl chain\nmolecules. However, the localized dynamics follows an unusual trend, where PRM\nis the fastest and ACM is the slowest. Despite greater flexibility in BUT, the\nslower caged dynamics impedes its localized motion.

However, these frameworks face challenges, notably their\ndependence on a single codebook for quantization, which may not capture the\ncomplex, multifaceted nature of signals. In addition, inefficiencies in\ncodebook utilization lead to underutilized code vectors. To address these\nlimitations, we introduce BRIDLE (Bidirectional Residual Quantization\nInterleaved Discrete Learning Encoder), a self-supervised encoder pretraining\nframework that incorporates residual quantization (RQ) into the bidirectional\ntraining process, and is generalized for pretraining with audio, image, and\nvideo. Using multiple hierarchical codebooks, RQ enables fine-grained\ndiscretization in the latent space, enhancing representation quality. BRIDLE\ninvolves an interleaved training procedure between the encoder and tokenizer.\nWe evaluate BRIDLE on audio understanding tasks using classification\nbenchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art results, and demonstrate competitive\nperformance on image classification and video classification tasks, showing\nconsistent improvements over traditional VQ methods in downstream performance.",

However, the existing cognitive\ndiagnostic models (CDMs) represent students' proficiency via a unidimensional\nperspective, which can't assess the students' mastery on each knowledge concept\ncomprehensively. Moreover, the Q-matrix binarizes the relationship between\nexercises and knowledge concepts, and it can't represent the latent\nrelationship between exercises and knowledge concepts. Especially, when the\ngranularity of knowledge attributes refines increasingly, the Q-matrix becomes\nincomplete correspondingly and the sparse binary representation (0/1) fails to\ncapture the intricate relationships among knowledge concepts. To address these\nissues, we propose a Concept-aware Latent and Explicit Knowledge Integration\nmodel for cognitive diagnosis (CLEKI-CD). Specifically, a multidimensional\nvector is constructed according to the students' mastery and exercise\ndifficulty for each knowledge concept from multiple perspectives, which\nenhances the representation capabilities of the model. Moreover, a latent\nQ-matrix is generated by our proposed attention-based knowledge aggregation\nmethod, and it can uncover the coverage degree of exercises over latent\nknowledge. The latent Q-matrix can supplement the sparse explicit Q-matrix with\nthe inherent relationships among knowledge concepts, and mitigate the knowledge\ncoverage problem. Furthermore, we employ a combined cognitive diagnosis layer\nto integrate both latent and explicit knowledge, further enhancing cognitive\ndiagnosis performance.

    "abstract": "Recent 4D dynamic scene editing methods require editing thousands of 2D\nimages used for dynamic scene synthesis and updating the entire scene with\nadditional training loops, resulting in several hours of processing to edit a\nsingle dynamic scene. Therefore, these methods are not scalable with respect to\nthe temporal dimension of the dynamic scene (i.e., the number of timesteps). In\nthis work, we propose Instruct-4DGS, an efficient dynamic scene editing method\nthat is more scalable in terms of temporal dimension. To achieve computational\nefficiency, we leverage a 4D Gaussian representation that models a 4D dynamic\nscene by combining static 3D Gaussians with a Hexplane-based deformation field,\nwhich captures dynamic information. We then perform editing solely on the\nstatic 3D Gaussians, which is the minimal but sufficient component required for\nvisual editing. To resolve the misalignment between the edited 3D Gaussians and\nthe deformation field, which may arise from the editing process, we introduce a\nrefinement stage using a score distillation mechanism. Extensive editing\nresults demonstrate that Instruct-4DGS is efficient, reducing editing time by\nmore than half compared to existing methods while achieving high-quality edits\nthat better follow user instructions.

It is also an extension of the classical\nAllen-Cahn equation, which is widely used in physics to describe the phenomenon\nof two-phase fluid flows.Due to the nonlocality of the nonlocal operator,\nnumerical solutions to these equations face considerable challenges.It is worth\nnoting that whether we use low-order or high-order numerical differential\nformulas to approximate the operator, the corresponding matrix is always dense,\nwhich implies that the storage space and computational cost required for the\nformer and the latter are the same. However, the higher-order formula can\nsignificantly improve the accuracy of the numerical scheme.Therefore, the\nprimary goal of this paper is to construct a high-order numerical formula that\napproximates the nonlocal operator.To reduce the time step limitation in\nexisting numerical algorithms, we employed a technique combining the compact\nintegration factor method with the Pad\\'{e} approximation strategy to\ndiscretize the time derivative.A novel high-order numerical scheme, which\nsatisfies both the maximum principle and energy stability for the space\nnonlocal Allen-Cahn equation, is proposed.Furthermore, we provide a detailed\nerror analysis of the differential scheme, which shows that its convergence\norder is $\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\tau^2+h^6\\right)$.Especially, it is worth\nmentioning that the fully implicit scheme with sixth-order accuracy in spatial\nhas never been proven to maintain the maximum principle and energy stability\nbefore.Finally, some numerical experiments are carried out to demonstrate the\nefficiency of the proposed method.",

To\nsolve this problem, we propose to align video foundation models with human\npreferences from the perspective of post-training in this paper. Consequently,\nwe introduce an Iterative Preference Optimization strategy to enhance generated\nvideo quality by incorporating human feedback. Specifically, IPO exploits a\ncritic model to justify video generations for pairwise ranking as in Direct\nPreference Optimization or point-wise scoring as in Kahneman-Tversky\nOptimization. Given this, IPO optimizes video foundation models with guidance\nof signals from preference feedback, which helps improve generated video\nquality in subject consistency, motion smoothness and aesthetic quality, etc.\nIn addition, IPO incorporates the critic model with the multi-modality large\nlanguage model, which enables it to automatically assign preference labels\nwithout need of retraining or relabeling. In this way, IPO can efficiently\nperform multi-round preference optimization in an iterative manner, without the\nneed of tediously manual labeling. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that\nthe proposed IPO can effectively improve the video generation quality of a\npretrained model and help a model with only 2B parameters surpass the one with\n5B parameters.

At $z=0$, we find diverse profile shapes,\nincluding inner and outer drops and rises, with some galaxies exhibiting double\nbreaks. Gradient values align with observations. A temporal analysis of Local\nGroup analogs shows inner and outer breaks occurring at all cosmic times, with\nouter breaks being more frequent. Metallicity gradients show high variability\nat high redshift, transitioning to mild evolution at lower redshift. Most inner\nbreaks show central oxygen enhancement, linked to gas accretion and star\nformation. Inner drops result from disrupted gas due to feedback-driven\noutflows. Outer breaks with high metallicities arise from re-accreted material,\nextended star formation, and CGM-driven gas mixing. Outer drops are common at\nhigh redshift, linked to metal-poor gas accretion from cold flows. We highlight\nthe complex interplay of these processes which often act together.",

    "abstract": "The contextual multi-armed bandit (MAB) is a widely used framework for\nproblems requiring sequential decision-making under uncertainty, such as\nrecommendation systems. In applications involving a large number of users, the\nperformance of contextual MAB can be significantly improved by facilitating\ncollaboration among multiple users. This has been achieved by the clustering of\nbandits (CB) methods, which adaptively group the users into different clusters\nand achieve collaboration by allowing the users in the same cluster to share\ndata. However, classical CB algorithms typically rely on numerical reward\nfeedback, which may not be practical in certain real-world applications. For\ninstance, in recommendation systems, it is more realistic and reliable to\nsolicit preference feedback between pairs of recommended items rather than\nabsolute rewards. To address this limitation, we introduce the first\n\"clustering of dueling bandit algorithms\" to enable collaborative\ndecision-making based on preference feedback. We propose two novel algorithms:\n(1) Clustering of Linear Dueling Bandits (COLDB) which models the user reward\nfunctions as linear functions of the context vectors, and (2) Clustering of\nNeural Dueling Bandits (CONDB) which uses a neural network to model complex,\nnon-linear user reward functions. Both algorithms are supported by rigorous\ntheoretical analyses, demonstrating that user collaboration leads to improved\nregret bounds. Extensive empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world\ndatasets further validate the effectiveness of our methods, establishing their\npotential in real-world applications involving multiple users with\npreference-based feedback.",

We used the simultaneous energy spectra\nfrom NICER (0.6 - 11 keV) and IXPE (2-8 keV) to study the spectral properties\nof the source during observations.

The spectral properties of GX 9+1\nduring the observation are consistent with those of other bright atoll-sources\nin the soft state.

After\nthe growth of a massive torus around the black hole, the magnetic field is\namplified in it, developing poloidal fields via dynamo. In an early stage of\nthe torus growth, magnetic fluxes that fall to the vicinity of the central\nblack hole are swallowed by the black hole and global poloidal magnetic fields\nthat can be the source of the Blandford-Znajek mechanism are not developed.\nHowever, in a later stage in which the ram pressure of the infalling matter\nbecomes weak, the magnetic field amplified by the black hole spin via the\nwinding becomes large enough to expel the infalling matter by the magnetic\npressure, and subsequently, a global poloidal magnetic field that penetrates\nthe black hole is established, launching a jet along the spin axis by the\nBlandford-Znajek mechanism with the luminosity suitable for explaining typical\nlong gamma-ray bursts. Together with the jet launch, the effectively viscous\neffect in the inner region of the torus and the magnetocentrifugal effect drive\nthe stellar explosion with the explosion energy comparable to typical or\npowerful supernovae.

In this paper, we first review the interdisciplinary origins of\nstance as an individual-level construct to highlight relevant attributes (e.g.,\npsychological features) that might be useful to incorporate in stance detection\nmodels.

However, because of the extremely low intensity of the nonlinear\noptical signal generated by irradiating molecules with entangled photon pairs,\ntime-resolved spectroscopic measurements using entangled photons have yet to be\nexperimentally implemented. In this paper, we theoretically propose a quantum\nspectroscopy measurement employing a time-resolved fluorescence approach that\naligns with the capabilities of current photon detection technologies. The\nproposed quantum spectroscopy affords two remarkable advantages over\nconventional two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy. First, it enables the\nacquisition of two-dimensional spectra without requiring control over multiple\npulsed lasers. Second, it reduces the complexity of the spectra because the\nspectroscopic signal is contingent upon the nonlinear optical process of\nspontaneous emission. These advantages are similar to those achieved in a\nprevious study [Fujihashi et al., J. Chem. Phys. 160, 104201 (2024)]. However,\nour approach achieves sufficient signal intensities that can be readily\ndetected using existing photon detection technologies, thereby rendering it a\npracticable.

The framework presents approach to detecting bias,\ndiscrimination, stereotyping across various categories such as gender, caste,\nage, disability, socioeconomic status, linguistic variations, etc., using an\napproach which is Adaptive, Stochastic and Context-Aware.

    "abstract": "The increasing demand for electronics is driving shorter development cycles\nfor application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). To meet these\nconstraints, hardware designers emphasize reusability and modularity of IP\nblocks, leveraging standard system-on-chip (SoC) architectures with integrated\nprocessors and common interconnects. While these architectures reduce design\nand verification efforts, they also introduce complexity, as verification must\nencompass both hardware and software execution.\n  To enhance reusability, hardware IP blocks are often described in\nhigher-abstraction-level languages such as Chisel and SystemRDL, relying on\ncompilers to generate Verilog for RTL simulation and implementation. At the\nsystem level, SoC modeling and verification leverage C++ and SystemC,\nunderscoring the need for software compilation. Consequently, an effective\nbuild system must support both hardware design flows and software compilation,\nincluding cross-compilation for C++, C, and assembly.\n  Existing hardware build systems lack sufficient support for software\ncompilation, necessitating the development of a new solution.

To address this limitation, we propose the Composite Aware\nSemantic Injection Mechanism (CASIM), comprising a composite-aware semantic\nencoder and a text-motion aligner that learns the dynamic correspondence\nbetween text and motion tokens.

Learning-based methods, such as behavior cloning (BC) and\nreinforcement learning (RL), demonstrate promising performance in visual\nnavigation but still face inherent limitations. BC is susceptible to\ncompounding errors due to limited expert imitation, while RL struggles with\nreward function design and sample inefficiency. To address these limitations,\nthis paper proposes an inverse reinforcement learning (IRL)-based framework for\nhigh-speed visual navigation. By leveraging IRL, it is possible to reduce the\nnumber of interactions with simulation environments and improve capability to\ndeal with high-dimensional spaces while preserving the robustness of RL\npolicies. A motion primitive-based path planning algorithm collects an expert\ndataset with privileged map data from diverse environments, ensuring\ncomprehensive scenario coverage. By leveraging both the acquired expert and\nlearner dataset gathered from the agent's interactions with the simulation\nenvironments, a robust reward function and policy are learned across diverse\nstates. While the proposed method is trained in a simulation environment only,\nit can be directly applied to real-world scenarios without additional training\nor tuning. The performance of the proposed method is validated in both\nsimulation and real-world environments, including forests and various\nstructures. The trained policy achieves an average speed of 7 m/s and a maximum\nspeed of 8.8 m/s in real flight experiments. To the best of our knowledge, this\nis the first work to successfully apply an IRL framework for high-speed visual\nnavigation of drones.",

In addition, we predict the robust appearance of a zero-bias\nconductance peak in a dirty normal-metal--superconductor junction containing a\n$p$-wave magnet, which serves as an unambiguous signature of anomalous\nproximity effects associated with the Majorana flat bands.",

    "abstract": "Plasticity is inherent to many engineering materials such as metals. While it\ncan degrade the load-carrying capacity of structures via material yielding, it\ncan also protect structures through plastic energy dissipation. To fully\nharness plasticity, here we present the theory, method, and application of a\ntopology optimization framework that simultaneously optimizes structural\ngeometries and material phases to customize the stiffness, strength, and\nstructural toughness of designs experiencing finite strain elastoplasticity.\nThe framework accurately predicts structural responses by employing a rigorous,\nmechanics-based elastoplasticity theory that ensures isochoric plastic flow. It\nalso effectively identifies optimal material phase distributions using a\ngradient-based optimizer, where gradient information is obtained via a reversed\nadjoint method to address history dependence, along with automatic\ndifferentiation to compute the complex partial derivatives. We demonstrate the\nframework by optimizing a range of 2D and 3D elastoplastic structures,\nincluding energy-dissipating dampers, load-carrying beams, impact-resisting\nbumpers, and cold working profiled sheets. These optimized multimaterial\nstructures reveal important mechanisms for improving design performance under\nlarge deformation, such as the transition from kinematic to isotropic hardening\nwith increasing displacement amplitudes and the formation of twisted regions\nthat concentrate stress, enhancing plastic energy dissipation. Through the\nsuperior performance of these optimized designs, we demonstrate the framework's\neffectiveness in tailoring elastoplastic responses across various spatial\nconfigurations, material types, hardening behaviors, and combinations of\ncandidate materials.

    "abstract": "Residual transformations enhance the representational depth and expressive\npower of large language models (LLMs). However, applying static residual\ntransformations across all tokens in auto-regressive generation leads to a\nsuboptimal trade-off between inference efficiency and generation fidelity.\nExisting methods, including Early Exiting, Skip Decoding, and Mixture-of-Depth\naddress this by modulating the residual transformation based on token-level\ncomplexity. Nevertheless, these approaches predominantly consider the distance\ntraversed by tokens through the model layers, neglecting the underlying\nvelocity of residual evolution. We introduce Mixture of Multi-rate Residuals\n(M2R2), a framework that dynamically modulates residual velocity to improve\nearly alignment, enhancing inference efficiency. Evaluations on reasoning\noriented tasks such as Koala, Self-Instruct, WizardLM, and MT-Bench show M2R2\nsurpasses state-of-the-art distance-based strategies, balancing generation\nquality and speedup. In self-speculative decoding setup, M2R2 achieves up to\n2.8x speedups on MT-Bench, outperforming methods like 2-model speculative\ndecoding, Medusa, LookAhead Decoding, and DEED. In Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)\narchitectures, integrating early residual alignment with ahead-of-time expert\nloading into high-bandwidth memory (HBM) accelerates decoding, reduces\nexpert-switching bottlenecks, and achieves a 2.9x speedup, making it highly\neffective in resource-constrained environments.",

We\npropose a novel approach called SMTFL to achieve secure model training in\nfederated learning without relying on trusted participants. To safeguard\ngradients privacy against gradient inversion attacks, clients are dynamically\ngrouped, allowing one client's gradient to be divided to obfuscate the\ngradients of other clients within the group. This method incorporates checks\nand balances to reduce the collusion for inferring specific client data. To\ndetect poisoning attacks from malicious clients, we assess the impact of\naggregated gradients on the global model's performance, enabling effective\nidentification and exclusion of malicious clients. Each client's gradients are\nencrypted and stored, with decryption collectively managed by all clients. The\ndetected poisoning gradients are invalidated from the global model through a\nunlearning method. We present a practical secure aggregation scheme, which does\nnot require trusted participants, avoids the performance degradation associated\nwith traditional noise-injection, and aviods complex cryptographic operations\nduring gradient aggregation. Evaluation results are encouraging based on four\ndatasets and two models: SMTFL is effective against poisoning attacks and\ngradient inversion attacks, achieving an accuracy rate of over 95% in locating\nmalicious clients, while keeping the false positive rate for honest clients\nwithin 5%.

By\nleveraging multimodal data to extract challenging scenarios from real-world car\ncrash reports, TRACE constructs numerous critical test cases with less data,\nsignificantly enhancing ADS bug detection efficiency. Using in-context\nlearning, chain-of-thought prompting, and self-validation approaches, we use\nLLMs to extract environmental and road network information from crash reports.\nFor vehicle trajectory planning, data containing map information and vehicle\ncoordinates serves as a knowledge base to build a ChatGPT-based LLM with\npath-planning capabilities, which we named TrackMate. Based on 50 existing\ncrash reports, our approach successfully tested three ADS models across two\nsimulation platforms, MetaDrive and BeamNG. Of the 290 constructed test\nscenarios, 127 are identified as critical, as they resulted in vehicle\ncollisions. Additionally, user feedback reveals that TRACE demonstrates\nsuperior scenario reconstruction accuracy, with 77.5% of the scenarios being\nrated as 'mostly or 'totally' consistent, compared to only 27% for the most\nrelated SOTA, LCTGen.",

    "abstract": "Recent advancements have highlighted the Mamba framework, a state-space model\nknown for its efficiency in capturing long-range dependencies with linear\ncomputational complexity. While Mamba has shown competitive performance in\nmedical image segmentation, it encounters difficulties in modeling local\nfeatures due to the sporadic nature of traditional location-based scanning\nmethods and the complex, ambiguous boundaries often present in medical images.\nTo overcome these challenges, we propose Uncertainty-Driven Mamba (UD-Mamba),\nwhich redefines the pixel-order scanning process by incorporating channel\nuncertainty into the scanning mechanism. UD-Mamba introduces two key scanning\ntechniques: 1) sequential scanning, which prioritizes regions with high\nuncertainty by scanning in a row-by-row fashion, and 2) skip scanning, which\nprocesses columns vertically, moving from high-to-low or low-to-high\nuncertainty at fixed intervals. Sequential scanning efficiently clusters\nhigh-uncertainty regions, such as boundaries and foreground objects, to improve\nsegmentation precision, while skip scanning enhances the interaction between\nbackground and foreground regions, allowing for timely integration of\nbackground information to support more accurate foreground inference.\nRecognizing the advantages of scanning from certain to uncertain areas, we\nintroduce four learnable parameters to balance the importance of features\nextracted from different scanning methods. Additionally, a cosine consistency\nloss is employed to mitigate the drawbacks of transitioning between uncertain\nand certain regions during the scanning process. Our method demonstrates robust\nsegmentation performance, validated across three distinct medical imaging\ndatasets involving pathology, dermatological lesions, and cardiac tasks.",

To solve\nthis challenge, in this study, we first establish an iterative\nestimation-optimization analysis framework for multiagent value-mixing\nQ-learning.

Evaluation of\n1,000 real-world Kubernetes configurations achieved a 94\\% success rate while\nmaintaining a low rate of introducing new misconfigurations.\n  Our work makes a promising step towards automated container security\nmanagement, reducing the manual effort required for configuration maintenance.",

It is\ncommonly a result of particle-wave interactions and has a complex dependence on\nthe particle charge and mass, enabling species-selectivity. If the plasma is\nrotating, e.g. due to $\\mathbf{E} \\times \\mathbf{B}$ motion, the ponderomotive\neffect can be generated using static (i.e., time-independent) perturbations to\nthe electric and magnetic fields, which can be significantly cheaper to produce\nthan time-dependent waves. This feature can be particularly useful in rotating\nmirror machines where mirror confinement can be enhanced by rotation, both\nthrough centrifugal confinement and additionally through a ponderomotive\ninteraction with a static azimuthal perturbation. Some static perturbations\ngenerate a ponderomotive barrier, other perturbations can generate either a\nrepulsive barrier or an attractive ponderomotive well which can be used to\nattract particles of a certain species while repelling another. The viability\nof each of these effects depends on the specifics of the rotation profile and\ntemperature, and the resultant dispersion relation in the rotating plasma.",

This is\nbecause the model's position embedding mechanisms are limited to positions\nencountered during training, thus preventing effective representation of\npositions in longer sequences. We analyzed conventional position encoding\nmethods for long contexts and found the following characteristics. (1) When the\nrepresentation dimension is regarded as the time axis, Rotary Position\nEmbedding (RoPE) can be interpreted as a restricted wavelet transform using\nHaar-like wavelets. However, because it uses only a fixed scale parameter, it\ndoes not fully exploit the advantages of wavelet transforms, which capture the\nfine movements of non-stationary signals using multiple scales (window sizes).\nThis limitation could explain why RoPE performs poorly in extrapolation. (2)\nPrevious research as well as our own analysis indicates that Attention with\nLinear Biases (ALiBi) functions similarly to windowed attention, using windows\nof varying sizes. However, it has limitations in capturing deep dependencies\nbecause it restricts the receptive field of the model. From these insights, we\npropose a new position representation method that captures multiple scales\n(i.e., window sizes) by leveraging wavelet transforms without limiting the\nmodel's attention field.

We propose the Ball-Proximal Point Method, Broximal Point Method, or\nBall Point Method (BPM) for short - a novel algorithmic framework inspired by\nthe classical Proximal Point Method (PPM) (Rockafellar, 1976), which, as we\nshow, sheds new light on several foundational optimization paradigms and\nphenomena, including non-convex and non-smooth optimization, acceleration,\nsmoothing, adaptive stepsize selection, and trust-region methods. At the core\nof BPM lies the ball-proximal (\"broximal\") operator, which arises from the\nclassical proximal operator by replacing the quadratic distance penalty by a\nball constraint. Surprisingly, and in sharp contrast with the sublinear rate of\nPPM in the nonsmooth convex regime, we prove that BPM converges linearly and in\na finite number of steps in the same regime. Furthermore, by introducing the\nconcept of ball-convexity, we prove that BPM retains the same global\nconvergence guarantees under weaker assumptions, making it a powerful tool for\na broader class of potentially non-convex optimization problems. Just like PPM\nplays the role of a conceptual method inspiring the development of practically\nefficient algorithms and algorithmic elements, e.g., gradient descent, adaptive\nstep sizes, acceleration (Ahn & Sra, 2020), and \"W\" in AdamW (Zhuang et al.,\n2022), we believe that BPM should be understood in the same manner: as a\nblueprint and inspiration for further development.",

While common approaches like NOAA\nAtlas 14 assume that extreme precipitation characteristics are stationary over\ntime, this assumption may underestimate current and future hazards due to\nanthropogenic climate change. However, the incorporation of nonstationarity in\nthe statistical modeling of extreme precipitation has faced practical\nchallenges that have restricted its applications. In particular, random\nsampling variability challenges the reliable estimation of trends and\nparameters, especially when observational records are limited. To address this\nmethodological gap, we propose the Spatially Varying Covariates Model, a\nhierarchical Bayesian spatial framework that integrates nonstationarity and\nregionalization for robust frequency analysis of extreme precipitation. This\nmodel draws from extreme value theory, spatial statistics, and Bayesian\nstatistics, and is validated through cross-validation and multiple performance\nmetrics. Applying this framework to a case study of daily rainfall in the\nWestern Gulf Coast, we identify robustly increasing trends in extreme\nprecipitation intensity and variability throughout the study area, with notable\nspatial heterogeneity. This flexible model accommodates stations with varying\nobservation records, yields smooth return level estimates, and can be\nstraightforwardly adapted to the analysis of precipitation frequencies at\ndifferent durations and for other regions.",

    "abstract": "Diffusion models (DMs) have significantly advanced the development of\nreal-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR), but the computational cost of\nmulti-step diffusion models limits their application. One-step diffusion models\ngenerate high-quality images in a one sampling step, greatly reducing\ncomputational overhead and inference latency. However, most existing one-step\ndiffusion methods are constrained by the performance of the teacher model,\nwhere poor teacher performance results in image artifacts. To address this\nlimitation, we propose FluxSR, a novel one-step diffusion Real-ISR technique\nbased on flow matching models. We use the state-of-the-art diffusion model\nFLUX.1-dev as both the teacher model and the base model. First, we introduce\nFlow Trajectory Distillation (FTD) to distill a multi-step flow matching model\ninto a one-step Real-ISR. Second, to improve image realism and address\nhigh-frequency artifact issues in generated images, we propose TV-LPIPS as a\nperceptual loss and introduce Attention Diversification Loss (ADL) as a\nregularization term to reduce token similarity in transformer, thereby\neliminating high-frequency artifacts. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate\nthat our method outperforms existing one-step diffusion-based Real-ISR methods.\nThe code and model will be released at https://github.com/JianzeLi-114/FluxSR.",

From existing\nwork, two primary challenges emerge in this setting: (i) the dependence on an\nexternal verifier indicating a notable gap from intrinsic reasoning of human\nintelligence without any external feedback, and (ii) the lack of an efficient\nsearch algorithm. In this paper, we introduce the Verifier-free Test-time\nScalable Diffusion Model (VFScale) to achieve scalable intrinsic reasoning,\nwhich equips number-of-sample test-time scaling with the intrinsic energy\nfunction of diffusion models as the verifier. Concretely, VFScale comprises two\nkey innovations to address the aforementioned challenges. On the training side,\nVFScale consists of a novel LRNCL loss and a KL regularization to improve the\nenergy landscape, ensuring that the learned energy function itself serves as a\nreliable verifier. On the inference side, VFScale integrates the denoising\nprocess with a novel hybrid Monte Carlo Tree Search (hMCTS) to improve search\nefficiency. On challenging reasoning tasks of Maze and Sudoku, we demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of VFScale's training objective and scalable inference\nmethod.

    "abstract": "Generating structured textual content requires mechanisms that enforce\ncoherence, stability, and adherence to predefined constraints while maintaining\nsemantic fidelity. Conventional approaches often rely on rule-based heuristics\nor fine-tuning strategies that lack flexibility and generalizability across\ndiverse tasks. The incorporation of Gradient-Regularized Latent Space\nModulation (GRLSM) introduces a novel paradigm for guiding text generation\nthrough the application of structured constraints within the latent space. The\nintegration of gradient-based regularization mitigates abrupt variations in\nlatent representations, ensuring a smoother encoding process that enhances\nstructural consistency and logical progression within generated sequences.\nComparative evaluations demonstrate that latent space modulation leads to a\nreduction in perplexity, increased coherence scores, and improved structural\nalignment across multiple domains. Stability assessments further indicate that\nthe imposition of spectral norm constraints facilitates more controlled\nvariations in generated text, preserving semantic consistency under input\nperturbations. Empirical results confirm that structured latent space\nconstraints not only refine the organization of generated outputs but also\nenhance interpretability through more predictable and reliable synthesis\npatterns. Performance metrics illustrate that the GRLSM framework substantially\nreduces structural inconsistencies while preserving the generative flexibility\ninherent in neural models.",

In this study, we develop\na strategy for estimating stellar mass using SPHEREx by examining the\ndependence on different stellar population synthesis (SPS) models and proposing\nnew scaling relations based on simulated SPHEREx data. We estimate the resolved\nstellar masses of 19 nearby late-type galaxies from the PHANGS-MUSE survey,\ntreating these as fiducial masses. By testing four SPS models covering infrared\nwavelengths, i.e., E-MILES, Bruzual \\& Charlot 2003 (BC03), Charlot \\& Bruzual\n2019 (CB19), and FSPS, we find systematic differences in mass-to-light ratios\nat $3.6~{\\rm \\mu m}$ ($M_{\\ast}/L_{\\rm 3.6\\mu m}$) among the SPS models. In\nparticular, BC03 and CB19 yield mass-to-light ratios on average\n$\\sim0.2-0.3~{\\rm dex}$ lower than those from E-MILES and FSPS. These\nmass-to-light ratios strongly correlate with stellar age, indicating a\nsignificant impact of young stellar populations on stellar mass measurements.\nOur analysis, incorporating fiducial masses and simulated SPHEREx data,\nidentifies the $1.6~{\\rm \\mu m}$ band as the optimal wavelength for stellar\nmass estimation, with the lowest scatter ($0.15-0.20~{\\rm dex}$) of the stellar\nmass. This scatter can be further reduced to $0.10-0.12~{\\rm dex}$ across all\nSPS models by incorporating optical and SPHEREx colors.

To address this issue, we\npropose a novel Collaborative Inference with Token-lEvel Routing (CITER)\nframework that enables efficient collaboration between small and large language\nmodels (SLMs \\& LLMs) through a token-level routing strategy. Specifically,\nCITER routes non-critical tokens to an SLM for efficiency and routes critical\ntokens to an LLM for generalization quality. We formulate router training as a\npolicy optimization, where the router receives rewards based on both the\nquality of predictions and the inference costs of generation. This allows the\nrouter to learn to predict token-level routing scores and make routing\ndecisions based on both the current token and the future impact of its\ndecisions. To further accelerate the reward evaluation process, we introduce a\nshortcut which significantly reduces the costs of the reward estimation and\nimproving the practicality of our approach. Extensive experiments on five\nbenchmark datasets demonstrate that CITER reduces the inference costs while\npreserving high-quality generation, offering a promising solution for real-time\nand resource-constrained applications.

Through a\ncomprehensive analysis of both encoder and decoder-based LLMs across diverse\ndatasets, we observe that even highly salient neurons, identified via various\nattribution techniques for specific semantic concepts, consistently exhibit\npolysemantic behavior. Importantly, activation magnitudes for fine-grained\nconcepts follow distinct, often Gaussian-like distributions with minimal\noverlap. This observation motivates a shift from neuron attribution to\nrange-based interpretation. We hypothesize that interpreting and manipulating\nneuron activation ranges would enable more precise interpretability and\ntargeted interventions in LLMs. To validate our hypothesis, we introduce\nNeuronLens, a novel range-based interpretation and manipulation framework that\nprovides a finer view of neuron activation distributions to localize concept\nattribution within a neuron. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that\nNeuronLens significantly reduces unintended interference, while maintaining\nprecise manipulation of targeted concepts, outperforming neuron attribution.",

While existing multi-agent reinforcement learning methods\ntypically rely on predefined social norms to assign reputations, the question\nof how a population reaches a consensus on judgement when agents hold private,\nindependent views remains unresolved. In this paper, we propose a novel\nbottom-up reputation learning method, Learning with Reputation Reward (LR2),\ndesigned to promote cooperative behaviour through rewards shaping based on\nassigned reputation. Our agent architecture includes a dilemma policy that\ndetermines cooperation by considering the impact on neighbours, and an\nevaluation policy that assigns reputations to affect the actions of neighbours\nwhile optimizing self-objectives. It operates using local observations and\ninteraction-based rewards, without relying on centralized modules or predefined\nnorms. Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness and adaptability of LR2\nacross various spatial social dilemma scenarios. Interestingly, we find that\nLR2 stabilizes and enhances cooperation not only with reward reshaping from\nbottom-up reputation but also by fostering strategy clustering in structured\npopulations, thereby creating environments conducive to sustained cooperation.",

Furthermore,\ncombining the exact formula for the average hitting times with the general\nformula for the effective resistance of the graph allows determination of the\nnumber of spanning trees of the graph with two identified vertices.",

    "abstract": "Generating and distributing remote entangled pairs (EPs) is a primary\nfunction of quantum networks, as entanglement is the fundamental resource for\nkey quantum network applications. A critical performance metric for quantum\nnetworks is the time-to-serve (TTS) for users' EP requests, which is the time\nto distribute EPs between the requested nodes. Minimizing the TTS is essential\ngiven the limited qubit coherence time. In this paper, we study the Adaptive\nContinuous entanglement generation Protocol (ACP), which enables quantum\nnetwork nodes to continuously generate EPs with their neighbors, while\nadaptively selecting the neighbors to optimize TTS. Meanwhile, entanglement\npurification is used to mitigate decoherence in pre-generated EPs prior to the\narrival of user requests. We extend the SeQUeNCe simulator to fully implement\nACP and conduct extensive simulations across various network scales. Our\nresults show that ACP reduces TTS by up to 94% and increases entanglement\nfidelity by up to 0.05.",

    "abstract": "We present a search for the diffuse extremely-high-energy neutrino flux using\n$12.6$ years of IceCube data. The nonobservation of neutrinos with energies\nwell above $10 \\, \\mathrm{PeV}$ constrains the all-flavor neutrino flux at\n$10^{18} \\, \\mathrm{eV}$ to a level of $E^2 \\Phi_{\\nu_e + \\nu_\\mu + \\nu_\\tau}\n\\simeq 10^{-8} \\, \\mathrm{GeV} \\, \\mathrm{cm}^{-2} \\, \\mathrm{s}^{-1} \\,\n\\mathrm{sr}^{-1}$, the most stringent limit to date. Using these data, we\nconstrain the proton fraction of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) above\n$\\simeq 30 \\, \\mathrm{EeV}$ to be $\\lesssim 70\\,$% (at $90\\,$% CL) if the\ncosmological evolution of the sources is comparable to or stronger than the\nstar formation rate. This is the first result to disfavor the ``proton-only\"\nhypothesis for UHECRs in this evolution regime using neutrino data. This result\ncomplements direct air-shower measurements by being insensitive to\nuncertainties associated with hadronic interaction models. We also evaluate the\ntension between IceCube's nonobservation and the $\\sim 200 \\, \\mathrm{PeV}$\nKM3NeT neutrino candidate (KM3-230213A), finding it to be $\\sim 2.9 \\sigma$\nbased on a joint-livetime fit between neutrino datasets.",

    "abstract": "While current Vision Transformer (ViT) adapter methods have shown promising\naccuracy, their inference speed is implicitly hindered by inefficient memory\naccess operations, e.g., standard normalization and frequent reshaping. In this\nwork, we propose META, a simple and fast ViT adapter that can improve the\nmodel's memory efficiency and decrease memory time consumption by reducing the\ninefficient memory access operations. Our method features a memory-efficient\nadapter block that enables the common sharing of layer normalization between\nthe self-attention and feed-forward network layers, thereby reducing the\nmodel's reliance on normalization operations. Within the proposed block, the\ncross-shaped self-attention is employed to reduce the model's frequent\nreshaping operations. Moreover, we augment the adapter block with a lightweight\nconvolutional branch that can enhance local inductive biases, particularly\nbeneficial for the dense prediction tasks, e.g., object detection, instance\nsegmentation, and semantic segmentation. The adapter block is finally\nformulated in a cascaded manner to compute diverse head features, thereby\nenriching the variety of feature representations. Empirically, extensive\nevaluations on multiple representative datasets validate that META\nsubstantially enhances the predicted quality, while achieving a new\nstate-of-the-art accuracy-efficiency trade-off. Theoretically, we demonstrate\nthat META exhibits superior generalization capability and stronger\nadaptability.",

    "abstract": "Multiview feature learning aims to learn discriminative features by\nintegrating the distinct information in each view. However, most existing\nmethods still face significant challenges in learning view-consistency\nfeatures, which are crucial for effective multiview learning. Motivated by the\ntheories of CCA and contrastive learning in multiview feature learning, we\npropose the hierarchical consensus network (HCN) in this paper. The HCN derives\nthree consensus indices for capturing the hierarchical consensus across views,\nwhich are classifying consensus, coding consensus, and global consensus,\nrespectively. Specifically, classifying consensus reinforces class-level\ncorrespondence between views from a CCA perspective, while coding consensus\nclosely resembles contrastive learning and reflects contrastive comparison of\nindividual instances. Global consensus aims to extract consensus information\nfrom two perspectives simultaneously. By enforcing the hierarchical consensus,\nthe information within each view is better integrated to obtain more\ncomprehensive and discriminative features. The extensive experimental results\nobtained on four multiview datasets demonstrate that the proposed method\nsignificantly outperforms several state-of-the-art methods.",

    "abstract": "The context caching technique is employed to accelerate the Multimodal Large\nLanguage Model (MLLM) inference by prevailing serving platforms currently.\nHowever, this approach merely reuses the Key-Value (KV) cache of the initial\nsequence of prompt, resulting in full KV cache recomputation even if the prefix\ndiffers slightly. This becomes particularly inefficient in the context of\ninterleaved text and images, as well as multimodal retrieval-augmented\ngeneration. This paper proposes position-independent caching as a more\neffective approach for multimodal information management. We have designed and\nimplemented a caching system, named MPIC, to address both system-level and\nalgorithm-level challenges. MPIC stores the KV cache on local or remote disks\nwhen receiving multimodal data, and calculates and loads the KV cache in\nparallel during inference. To mitigate accuracy degradation, we have\nincorporated integrated reuse and recompute mechanisms within the system.

    "abstract": "While attention-based approaches have shown considerable progress in\nenhancing image fusion and addressing the challenges posed by long-range\nfeature dependencies, their efficacy in capturing local features is compromised\nby the lack of diverse receptive field extraction techniques. To overcome the\nshortcomings of existing fusion methods in extracting multi-scale local\nfeatures and preserving global features, this paper proposes a novel\ncross-modal image fusion approach based on a multi-scale convolutional neural\nnetwork with attention Transformer (MATCNN). MATCNN utilizes the multi-scale\nfusion module (MSFM) to extract local features at different scales and employs\nthe global feature extraction module (GFEM) to extract global features.\nCombining the two reduces the loss of detail features and improves the ability\nof global feature representation. Simultaneously, an information mask is used\nto label pertinent details within the images, aiming to enhance the proportion\nof preserving significant information in infrared images and background\ntextures in visible images in fused images. Subsequently, a novel optimization\nalgorithm is developed, leveraging the mask to guide feature extraction through\nthe integration of content, structural similarity index measurement, and global\nfeature loss. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations are conducted across\nvarious datasets, revealing that MATCNN effectively highlights infrared salient\ntargets, preserves additional details in visible images, and achieves better\nfusion results for cross-modal images.

The system comprises a monostatic\nmultiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar that transmits orthogonal time\nfrequency space (OTFS) waveforms. Bandwidth efficiency is achieved by making\nDoppler-delay (DD) domain bins available for shared use by the transmit\nantennas. For maximum communication rate, all DD-domain bins are used as\nshared, but in this case, the target resolution is limited by the aperture of\nthe receive array. A low-complexity method is proposed for obtaining coarse\nestimates of the radar targets parameters in that case. A novel approach is\nalso proposed to construct a virtual array (VA) for achieving a target\nresolution higher than that allowed by the receive array. The VA is formed by\nenforcing zeros on certain time-frequency (TF) domain bins, thereby creating\nprivate bins assigned to specific transmit antennas. The TF signals received on\nthese private bins are orthogonal, enabling the synthesis of a VA. When\ncombined with coarse target estimates, this approach provides high-accuracy\ntarget estimation. To preserve DD-domain information, the introduction of\nprivate bins requires reducing the number of DD-domain symbols, resulting in a\ntrade-off between communication rate and sensing performance.

It is shown that the upstream flow is dissipated by the Weibel\ninstability, so that the relativistic collisionless shock is formed as in the\ncase of cold upstream. The density and magnetic field structures around the\nshock front are almost independent of the upstream temperature when the spatial\nscale is normalized by the inertial length scale which takes into account the\nrelativistic temperature. This can be understood by considering the pressure\nanisotropy, which asymptotically approaches a finite value due to the\nrelativistic beaming effect, even as the temperature becomes relativistically\nhotter and hotter. In addition, as long as the shock velocity is relativistic,\nsome particles are accelerated, forming a power-law energy spectrum similar to\nthat in the cold upstream.",

    "abstract": "Pairwise network comparison is essential for various applications, including\nneuroscience, disease research, and dynamic network analysis. While existing\nliterature primarily focuses on comparing entire network structures, we address\na vertex-wise comparison problem where two random networks share the same set\nof vertices but allow for structural variations in some vertices, enabling a\nmore detailed and flexible analysis of network differences. In our framework,\nsome vertices retain their latent positions between networks, while others\nundergo shifts. To identify the shifted and unshifted vertices and estimate\ntheir latent position shifts, we propose a method that first derives vertex\nembeddings in a low-rank Euclidean space for each network, then aligns these\nestimated vertex latent positions into a common space to resolve potential\nnon-identifiability, and finally tests whether each vertex is shifted or not\nand estimates the vertex shifts. Our theoretical results establish the test\nstatistic for the algorithms, guide parameter selection, and provide\nperformance guarantees. Simulation studies and real data applications,\nincluding a case-control study in disease research and dynamic network\nanalysis, demonstrate that the proposed algorithms are both computationally\nefficient and effective in extracting meaningful insights from network\ncomparisons.",

By alternately stacking two\nmaterials with different thermal conductivities and rotating its multilayered\nstructure with respect to a longitudinal temperature gradient, off-diagonal\ncomponents in the thermal conductivity tensor are induced. This off-diagonal\nthermal conduction (ODTC) generates a finite transverse temperature gradient\nand Seebeck-effect-induced thermopower in the adiabatic condition, which is\nsuperposed on the isothermal transverse thermopower driven by the off-diagonal\nSeebeck effect (ODSE). In this study, we calculate and observe the\ntwo-dimensional temperature distribution and the resultant transverse\nthermopower in ATMLs comprising thermoelectric Co$_{2}$MnGa Heusler alloys and\nBi$_{2-a}$Sb$_{a}$Te$_{3}$ compounds.

This\nlimitation hampers the model's ability to capture global contextual\ninformation, particularly when dealing with multi-word aspect and opinion terms\nin complex sentences.

In this study, we exemplify the strain-engineered magnetism of\nLa$_{2/3}$Sr$_{1/3}$MnO$_3$ in freestanding and rippled membrane forms without\nand with process-induced strain, respectively, prepared by epitaxial lift-off\ntechnique. We find that the deposition of Pt/Ti stressor suppresses the crack\nformation in the lift-off process and induces a ripple structure in the\nLa$_{2/3}$Sr$_{1/3}$MnO$_3$ membrane. Laser micrograph and Raman spectroscopy\nshow a ripple period of about 30 um and a height of a few um, where alternating\nconvex and concave structures are subjected to tensile strain of 0.6% and\ncompressive strain of 0.5%, respectively. While the freestanding\nLa$_{2/3}$Sr$_{1/3}$MnO$_3$ membrane exhibits room-temperature ferromagnetism,\nthe macroscopic magnetic transition temperature (TC) of the rippled membrane is\nreduced by as large as 27%. Temperature-variable Kerr microscopy observation in\nthe rippled membrane reveals that the spatial variation of TC to be\napproximately 4% of the macroscopic TC, which coincides with the local strains\nat convex and concave structures. The large reduction of macroscopic TC in the\nrippled membrane may be ascribed to the lattice disorders due to strain\ngradient. Our demonstration of tuning ferromagnetism by the ripple structure\nvalidates the high potential of the process-induced strain in epitaxial\nlift-off technique and paves the way for strain-mediated emerging physical\nproperties in various transition metal oxides.",

In this paper, we present VolleyBots, a novel robot sports\ntestbed where multiple drones cooperate and compete in the sport of volleyball\nunder physical dynamics. VolleyBots integrates three features within a unified\nplatform: competitive and cooperative gameplay, turn-based interaction\nstructure, and agile 3D maneuvering. Competitive and cooperative gameplay\nchallenges each drone to coordinate with its teammates while anticipating and\ncountering opposing teams' tactics. Turn-based interaction demands precise\ntiming, accurate state prediction, and management of long-horizon temporal\ndependencies. Agile 3D maneuvering requires rapid accelerations, sharp turns,\nand precise 3D positioning despite the quadrotor's underactuated dynamics.\nThese intertwined features yield a complex problem combining motion control and\nstrategic play, with no available expert demonstrations. We provide a\ncomprehensive suite of tasks ranging from single-drone drills to multi-drone\ncooperative and competitive tasks, accompanied by baseline evaluations of\nrepresentative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) and game-theoretic\nalgorithms. Simulation results show that on-policy reinforcement learning (RL)\nmethods outperform off-policy methods in single-agent tasks, but both\napproaches struggle in complex tasks that combine motion control and strategic\nplay. We additionally design a hierarchical policy which achieves a 69.5%\npercent win rate against the strongest baseline in the 3 vs 3 task,\nunderscoring its potential as an effective solution for tackling the complex\ninterplay between low-level control and high-level strategy.

This preference distribution shift leads to catastrophic\nalignment failures in many real-world applications. We address this problem\nusing the principled framework of distributionally robust optimization, and\ndevelop two novel distributionally robust direct preference optimization (DPO)\nalgorithms, namely, Wasserstein DPO (WDPO) and Kullback-Leibler DPO (KLDPO).

ACM '20]\nsays that every planar graph $G$ is contained in $H\\boxtimes P\\boxtimes K_3$\nfor some planar graph $H$ with treewidth at most 3 and some path $P$. This\nresult has been the key to solving several old open problems. Several people\nhave asked whether the Planar Graph Product Structure Theorem can be proved\nwith good upper bounds on the length of $P$. No $o(n)$ upper bound was\npreviously known for $n$-vertex planar graphs. We answer this question in the\naffirmative, by proving that for any $\\epsilon\\in (0,1)$ every $n$-vertex\nplanar graph is contained in $H\\boxtimes P\\boxtimes K_{O(1/\\epsilon)}$, for\nsome planar graph $H$ with treewidth 3 and for some path $P$ of length\n$O(\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}n^{(1+\\epsilon)/2})$. This bound is almost tight since\nthere is a lower bound of $\\Omega(n^{1/2})$ for certain $n$-vertex planar\ngraphs. In fact, we prove a stronger result with $P$ of length\n$O(\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}\\,\\textrm{tw}(G)\\,n^{\\epsilon})$, which is tight up to the\n$O(\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}\\,n^{\\epsilon})$ factor for every $n$-vertex planar graph\n$G$. Finally, taking $\\epsilon=\\frac{1}{\\log n}$, we show that every $n$-vertex\nplanar graph $G$ is contained in $H\\boxtimes P\\boxtimes K_{O(\\log n)}$ for some\nplanar graph $H$ with treewidth at most 3 and some path $P$ of length\n$O(\\textrm{tw}(G)\\,\\log n)$. This result is particularly attractive since the\ntreewidth of the product $H\\boxtimes P\\boxtimes K_{O(\\log n)}$ is within a\n$O(\\log^2n)$ factor of the treewidth of $G$.",

Moreover, good estimates of\nthe masses of both BHs are not yet available to test this idea. Here we report\nthe evidence of a dual AGN candidate with mass ratio $\\sim$7:1 located in an\nundisturbed disk galaxy. We identify the central BH with mass of $9.4 \\times\n10^6M_\\odot$ from its radio emission as well as AGN-driven galactic-scale\nbiconical outflows. The off-centered BH generates obvious broad and narrow\nemission-line regions, which gives us a robust estimation of a $1.3 \\times\n10^6M_\\odot$ BH mass. We explore alternative scenarios for explaining the\nobservational features of this system, including the complex gas kinematics\ntriggered by central AGN activity and dust attenuation of the broad-line region\nof the central BH, finding that they failed to fully account for the kinematics\nof both the redshifted off-centered broad and narrow emission-line components.",

Traditional path planning methods fail to incorporate these\ndetailed wake structures, resulting in increased energy consumption, reduced\ncontrol stability, and heightened safety risks. This paper presents a novel\nwake-informed, 3D path planning approach that fully integrates localized wake\neffects and global currents into the planning algorithm. Two variants of the A*\nalgorithm - a current-informed planner and a wake-informed planner - are\ncreated to assess its validity and two neural network models are then trained\nto approximate these planners for real-time applications. Both the A* planners\nand NN models are evaluated using important metrics such as energy expenditure,\npath length, and encounters with high-velocity and turbulent regions. The\nresults demonstrate a wake-informed A* planner consistently achieves the lowest\nenergy expenditure and minimizes encounters with high-velocity regions,\nreducing energy consumption by up to 11.3%. The neural network models are\nobserved to offer computational speedup of 6 orders of magnitude, but exhibit\n4.51 - 19.79% higher energy expenditures and 9.81 - 24.38% less optimal paths.\nThese findings underscore the importance of incorporating detailed wake\nstructures into traditional path planning algorithms and the benefits of neural\nnetwork approximations to enhance energy efficiency and operational safety for\nAUVs in complex 3D domains.",

The imputation lies in the core of the game if, for each\nsub-coalition, the amount allocated to its agents is at least the worth of this\nsub-coalition. Hence, under a core imputation, each of exponentially many\nsub-coalitions gets satisfied. The following computational question has\nreceived much attention: Given an imputation, does it lie in the core? Clearly,\nthis question lies in co-NP, since a co-NP certificate for this problem would\nbe a sub-coalition which is not satisfied under the imputation. This question\nis in P for the assignment game [SS71] and has been shown to be co-NP-hard for\nseveral natural games, including max-flow [FZCD02] and MST [FKFH97]. The one\nnatural game for which this question has remained open is the b-matching game\nwhen the number of times an edge can be matched is unconstrained; in case each\nedge can be matched at most once, it is co-NP-hard [BKPW18]. At the outset, it\nwas not clear which way this open question would resolve: on the one hand, for\nall but one game, this problem was shown co-NP-hard and on the other hand,\nproximity to the assignment problem and the deep structural properties of\nmatching could lead to a positive result.

The masters varied significantly\nin artistic and managerial styles, meaning different combinations of artists\nand implements might be seen both between masters and within workshops or even\nindividual canvases. Information on how different workshops were managed and\nthe processes by which artworks were created remains elusive. Machine learning\nmethods have potential to unearth new information about artists' creative\nprocesses by extending the analysis of brushwork to a microscopic scale.\nAnalysis of workshop paintings, however, presents a challenge in that\ndocumentation of the artists and materials involved is sparse, meaning external\nexamples are not available to train networks to recognize their contributions.\nHere we present a novel machine learning approach we call pairwise assignment\ntraining for classifying heterogeneity (PATCH) that is capable of identifying\nindividual artistic practice regimes with no external training data, or \"ground\ntruth.\" The method achieves unsupervised results by supervised means, and\noutperforms both simple statistical procedures and unsupervised machine\nlearning methods.

    "abstract": "Spacecraft operations are influenced by uncertainties such as dynamics\nmodeling, navigation, and maneuver execution errors. Although mission design\nhas traditionally incorporated heuristic safety margins to mitigate the effect\nof uncertainties, particularly before/after crucial events, it is yet unclear\nwhether this practice will scale in the cislunar region, which features locally\nchaotic nonlinear dynamics and involves frequent lunar flybys. This paper\napplies chance-constrained covariance steering and sequential convex\nprogramming to simultaneously design an optimal trajectory and trajectory\ncorrection policy that can probabilistically guarantee safety constraints under\nthe assumed physical/navigational error models. The results show that the\nproposed method can effectively control the state uncertainty in a highly\nnonlinear environment. The framework allows faster computation and lossless\nconvexification of linear covariance propagation compared to existing methods,\nenabling a rapid and accurate comparison of $\\Delta V_{99}$ costs for different\nuncertainty parameters.

However, this constrained architecture for visual and\ntextual tokens restricts the design space for processing visual tokens,\npotentially leading to suboptimal performance and efficiency. In this paper, we\npropose Decomposed Attention (D-Attn), a more flexible attention architecture\nfor LVLMs, which enables modification of visual token operations without\naffecting textual-to-textual attention. D-Attn decomposes the 1-D causal\nself-attention of LVLMs into visual-to-visual, textual-to-visual, and\ntextual-to-textual attentions, and the visual and textual output tokens from\nthe decomposed attentions are merged with a carefully derived weighting\nstrategy, namely $\\alpha$-weighting. Taking advantage of the flexibility, we\nare able to introduce two critical improvements in visual token processing\nwhile maintaining the capacity of pre-trained LLMs: 1) We rectify the biased\npositional encoding in textual-to-visual attention to boost visual\nunderstanding performance. 2) We diagonalize visual-to-visual attention to\nreduce computation complexity from $O(|V|^2)$ to $O(|V|)$ for $|V|$ visual\ntokens without compromising performance.

We compare the difference in vote-shares (or the share of\npopulation) obtained by both these methods to determine the need to navigate\nnegative ties in these settings.

In bipartite graphs,\ncommon neighborhood computation between two vertices on the same vertex layer\nis a basic operator, which is easily solvable in general settings. However, it\ninevitably involves releasing the neighborhood information of vertices, posing\na significant privacy risk for users in real-world applications. To protect\nedge privacy in bipartite graphs, in this paper, we study the problem of\nestimating the number of common neighbors of two vertices on the same layer\nunder edge local differential privacy (edge LDP). The problem is challenging in\nthe context of edge LDP since each vertex on the opposite layer of the query\nvertices can potentially be a common neighbor. To obtain efficient and accurate\nestimates, we propose a multiple-round framework that significantly reduces the\ncandidate pool of common neighbors and enables the query vertices to construct\nunbiased estimators locally. Furthermore, we improve data utility by\nincorporating the estimators built from the neighbors of both query vertices\nand devise privacy budget allocation optimizations. These improve the\nestimator's robustness and consistency, particularly against query vertices\nwith imbalanced degrees.

We show that the oscillation and granulation power ratios\nbetween TESS and Kepler match the theoretical prediction, confirming that both\ndecrease as we move to redder wavelengths. We also see that the mean ratios of\noscillations and granulation agree, suggesting that oscillation and granulation\nhave the same wavelength dependence. We also find that the mean\nheight-to-background ratio for Kepler agrees with previous results and shows\ngood agreement with TESS.

    "abstract": "Bird's-eye view (BEV) perception has garnered significant attention in\nautonomous driving in recent years, in part because BEV representation\nfacilitates multi-modal sensor fusion. BEV representation enables a variety of\nperception tasks including BEV segmentation, a concise view of the environment\nuseful for planning a vehicle's trajectory. However, this representation is not\nfully supported by existing datasets, and creation of new datasets for this\npurpose can be a time-consuming endeavor. To address this challenge, we\nintroduce SimBEV. SimBEV is a randomized synthetic data generation tool that is\nextensively configurable and scalable, supports a wide array of sensors,\nincorporates information from multiple sources to capture accurate BEV ground\ntruth, and enables a variety of perception tasks including BEV segmentation and\n3D object detection. SimBEV is used to create the SimBEV dataset, a large\ncollection of annotated perception data from diverse driving scenarios. SimBEV\nand the SimBEV dataset are open and available to the public.",
