    "abstract": "In an early work from 1896, Maschke established the complete list of all\nfinite planar Cayley graphs. This result initiated a long line of research over\nthe next century, aiming at characterizing in a similar way all planar infinite\nCayley graphs. Droms (2006) proved a structure theorem for finitely generated\nplanar groups, i.e., finitely generated groups admitting a planar Cayley graph,\nin terms of Bass-Serre decompositions. As a byproduct of his structure theorem,\nDroms proved that such groups are finitely presented. More recently, Hamann\n(2018) gave a graph theoretical proof that every planar quasi-transitive graph\n$G$ admits a generating $\\mathrm{Aut}(G)$-invariant set of closed walks with\nonly finitely many orbits, and showed that a consequence is an alternative\nproof of Droms' result. Based on the work of Hamann, we show in this note that\nwe can also obtain a general structure theorem for $3$-connected locally finite\nplanar quasi-transitive graphs, namely that every such graph admits a canonical\ntree-decomposition whose edge-separations correspond to cycle-separations in\nthe (unique) embedding of $G$, and in which every part admits a\nvertex-accumulation free embedding. This result can be seen as a version of\nDroms' structure theorem for quasi-transitive planar graphs. As a corollary, we\nobtain an alternative proof of a result of Hamann, Lehner, Miraftab and\nR\\\"uhmann (2022) that every locally finite quasi-transitive planar graph admits\na canonical tree-decomposition, whose parts are either $1$-ended or finite\nplanar graphs.",

While existing alignment methods like Direct Preference\nOptimization (DPO) attempt to steer models to reflect human preferences, they\nstruggle to capture the distributional pluralistic preferences within a group.\nThese methods often skew toward dominant preferences, overlooking the diversity\nof opinions, especially when conflicting preferences arise. To address this\nissue, we propose Group Distributional Preference Optimization (GDPO), a novel\nframework that aligns language models with the distribution of preferences\nwithin a group by incorporating the concept of beliefs that shape individual\npreferences. GDPO calibrates a language model using statistical estimation of\nthe group's belief distribution and aligns the model with belief-conditioned\npreferences, offering a more inclusive alignment framework than traditional\nmethods. In experiments using both synthetic controllable opinion generation\nand real-world movie review datasets, we show that DPO fails to align with the\ntargeted belief distributions, while GDPO consistently reduces this alignment\ngap during training. Moreover, our evaluation metrics demonstrate that GDPO\noutperforms existing approaches in aligning with group distributional\npreferences, marking a significant advance in pluralistic alignment.",

Therefore, in order to derive novel and physically interesting\nsolutions that describe compact objects one needs to address generalised\ngravitational theories. One popular class of such theories is the\nEinstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet (EsGB) theory with a general coupling function\nbetween the scalar field of the theory and the quadratic Gauss-Bonnet term.\nStarting from black holes, we present a variety of spherically-symmetric\nsolutions for several different forms of the coupling function and discuss\ntheir main features. We then proceed to wormhole solutions and demonstrate that\nthe EsGB theory naturally supports traversable wormholes without the need for\nexotic matter. Regular scalarised particle-like solutions also emerge in the\ncontext of the same theory which also possess interesting observable features\nsuch as photon rings and echoes. Moving beyond this class of theories, we then\naddress the more extended scalar-tensor Horndeski theory, briefly mention the\ntypes of black-hole solutions that arise, and demonstrate that an appropriately\nconstructed disformal transformation of a black-hole solution, such as the\nLu-Pang solution, results into a traversable wormhole in the context of the\nbeyond-Horndeski theory.",

The structure that is\nbeing deformed is that of a presymplectic gauge PDE, which consists of a graded\npresymplectic structure and a compatible odd vector field. These are known to\nencode the Batalin-Vilkovisky (BV) formulation of a local gauge theory in terms\nof the finite dimensional supergeometrical object. Although in its present\nversion the method is limited to interactions that do not deform the\npre-symplectic structure and relies on some natural assumptions, it gives a\nremarkably simple way to analyse consistent interactions. The approach can be\nconsidered as the BV-AKSZ extension of the frame-like approach to consistent\ninteractions.

Using empirical data from timber auctions, we\nidentify buyers' tendency to delay consumption to resolve payoff uncertainty\nand reveal heterogeneous motivations among buyers. Through structural\nestimation, we uncover key parameters for each buyer type, including\nsensitivity to realized payoffs and consumption-related costs. Leveraging these\nestimates, we perform counterfactual analyses to propose revenue-enhancing\nconsumption periods and selling mechanisms.

    "abstract": "Water scarcity has required constant water recycling, leading to a decline in\nwater quality, further exacerbated by high concentrations of fine particles\nthat reduce the efficiency of solid-liquid separation systems. Inclined\nsettlers offer a viable secondary treatment option for high-turbidity water.\nEffective design requires understanding of operational conditions, geometry,\nand suspension properties. Using OpenFOAM, computational fluid dynamics\nsimulations were performed for a continuous inclined countercurrent conduit to\nassess the influence of inlet particle concentration on efficiency, exploring\nvarious Surface Overflow Rates (SOR) and inclination angles. The results show\nthat the steady state in which the flow settles is strongly dependent on the\nparticle concentration. For very low particle concentrations, the flow is\nmostly stationary with little to no resuspension of particles. Increasingly\nunstable regimes are observed to emerge as the inlet concentration increases,\nleading to increased particle resuspension. Instabilities arise from\noverhanging zones at the tip of the suspension, generating recirculation zones\nthat enlarge the resuspension region and induce entrainment within the bulk\nsuspension. Shear instabilities become noticeable at large particle\nconcentrations, further increasing resuspension. Different regimes were\nidentified, influenced by the SOR and the inclination angles. Additionally, a\nReynolds number characterizing these systems is proposed alongside a scale\nanalysis. The findings highlight particle concentration as a critical parameter\nin inclined plate settler design.",

This paper focuses on a new emerging property\ncalled contractivity, which refers to the exponential convergence of all system\ntrajectories toward each other under a specified metric. Data-driven closed\nloop contractivity has been studied for the case of the 2-norm and assuming\nnonlinearities are Lipschitz bounded in subsets of n dimensional euclidean\nspace. We extend the analysis by considering Riemannian metrics for polynomial\ndynamics. The key to our derivation is to leverage the convex criteria for\nclosed-loop contraction and duality results to efficiently check infinite\ndimensional membership constraints.

Our motivated observation is\nthat transportation problems with the optimality structures delineated by GSBs\nare pervasive across various scientific domains, such as generative modeling in\nmachine learning, mean-field games in stochastic control, and more. Exploring\nthe intrinsic connection between the mathematical modeling of GSBs and the\nmodern algorithmic characterization therefore presents a crucial, yet untapped,\navenue.

The resulting computational framework, driven by deep learning and\nneural networks, operates in a fully continuous state space (i.e., mesh-free)\nand satisfies distribution constraints, setting it apart from prior numerical\nsolvers relying on spatial discretization or constraint relaxation.

While empirical results are known for posits, this aspect\nhas yet to be formally investigated.\n  This paper provides rigorous derivations and proofs of the integral\nrepresentation capabilities of posits and takums, examining both the exact\nnumber of bits required to represent a given integer and the largest\nconsecutive integer that can be represented with a specified number of bits.\nThe findings indicate that, while posits are generally less effective than IEEE\n754 floating-point numbers in this regard, takums demonstrate overall superior\nrepresentational strength compared to both IEEE 754 and posits.",

    "abstract": "The Hamiltonian constraint remains an elusive object in loop quantum gravity\nbecause its action on spinnetworks leads to changes in their corresponding\ngraphs. As a result, calculations in loop quantum gravity are often considered\nunpractical, and neither the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian constraint, which\nform the physical space of states, nor the concrete effect of its\ngraph-changing character on observables are entirely known. Much worse, there\nis no reference value to judge whether the commonly adopted graph-preserving\napproximations lead to results anywhere close to the non-approximated dynamics.\nOur work sheds light on many of these issues, by devising a new numerical tool\nthat allows us to implement the action of the Hamiltonian constraint without\nthe need for approximations and to calculate expectation values for geometric\nobservables. To achieve that, we fill the theoretical gap left in the\nderivations of the action of the Hamiltonian constraint on spinnetworks: we\nprovide the first complete derivation of such action for the case of 4-valent\nspinnetworks, while updating the corresponding derivation for 3-valent\nspinnetworks. Our derivations also include the action of the volume operator.\nBy proposing a new approach to encode spinnetworks into functions of lists and\nthe derived formulas into functionals, we implement both the Hamiltonian\nconstraint and the volume operator numerically. We are able to transform\nspinnetworks with graph-changing dynamics perturbatively and verify that volume\nexpectation values have rather different behavior from the approximated,\ngraph-preserving results. Furthermore, using our tool we find a family of\npotentially relevant solutions of the Hamiltonian constraint. Our work paves\nthe way to a new generation of calculations in loop quantum gravity, in which\ngraph-changing results and their phenomenology can finally be accounted for and\nunderstood.",

    "abstract": "Social learning, a cornerstone of cultural evolution, enables individuals to\nacquire knowledge by observing and imitating others. At the heart of its\nefficacy lies episodic memory, which encodes specific behavioral sequences to\nfacilitate learning and decision-making. This study explores the interrelation\nbetween episodic memory and social learning in collective foraging. Using\nSequential Episodic Control (SEC) agents capable of sharing complete behavioral\nsequences stored in episodic memory, we investigate how variations in the\nfrequency and fidelity of social learning influence collaborative foraging\nperformance. Furthermore, we analyze the effects of social learning on the\ncontent and distribution of episodic memories across the group. High-fidelity\nsocial learning is shown to consistently enhance resource collection efficiency\nand distribution, with benefits sustained across memory lengths. In contrast,\nlow-fidelity learning fails to outperform nonsocial learning, spreading diverse\nbut ineffective mnemonic patterns. Novel analyses using mnemonic metrics reveal\nthat high-fidelity social learning also fosters mnemonic group alignment and\nequitable resource distribution, while low-fidelity conditions increase\nmnemonic diversity without translating to performance gains. Additionally, we\nidentify an optimal range for episodic memory length in this task, beyond which\nperformance plateaus. These findings underscore the critical effects of social\nlearning on mnemonic group alignment and distribution and highlight the\npotential of neurocomputational models to probe the cognitive mechanisms\ndriving cultural evolution.",

Its simple formulation enhances computational\nefficiency, leading to improvements in scalability and convergence speed.\nUnlike many modern activation functions, TeLU seamlessly combines the\nsimplicity and effectiveness of ReLU with the smoothness and analytic\nproperties essential for learning stability in deep neural networks. TeLU's\nability to mimic the behavior and optimal hyperparameter settings of ReLU,\nwhile introducing the benefits of smoothness and curvature, makes it an ideal\ndrop-in replacement.

    "abstract": "Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) enables the sharing of cryptographic keys\nsecured by quantum mechanics. The BB84 protocol assumed single-photon sources,\nbut practical systems rely on weak coherent pulses vulnerable to\nphoton-number-splitting (PNS) attacks. The Gottesman-Lo-L\\\"utkenhaus-Preskill\n(GLLP) framework addressed these imperfections, deriving secure key rate bounds\nunder limited PNS scenarios. The Decoy-state protocol further improved\nperformance by refining single-photon yield estimates, but still considered\nmulti-photon states as insecure, thereby limiting intensities and constraining\nkey rate and distance. More recently, finite-key security bounds for\ndecoy-state QKD have been extended to address general attacks, ensuring\nsecurity against adversaries capable of exploiting arbitrary strategies. In\nthis work, we focus on a specific class of attacks, the generalized PNS attack,\nand demonstrate that higher pulse intensities can be securely used by employing\nBayesian inference to estimate key parameters directly from observed data. By\nraising the pulse intensity to 10 photons, we achieve a 50-fold increase in key\nrate and a 62.2% increase in operational range (about 200 km) compared to the\ndecoy-state protocol. Furthermore, we accurately model after-pulsing using a\nHidden Markov Model and reveal inaccuracies in decoy-state calculations that\nmay produce erroneous key-rate estimates. While this methodology does not\naddress all possible attacks, it provides a new approach to security proofs in\nQKD by shifting from worst-case assumption analysis to observation-dependent\ninference, advancing the reach and efficiency of discrete-variable QKD\nprotocols.",

With its\nincreasing adoption, ensuring the reliability of WebAssembly code becomes\nparamount. In this paper, we investigate how well WebAssembly compilers fulfill\ncode reusability. Specifically, we inquire (1) what challenges arise when\ncross-compiling a high-level language codebase into WebAssembly and (2) how\nfaithfully WebAssembly compilers preserve code semantics in this new binary.\nThrough a study on 115 open-source codebases, we identify the key challenges in\ncross-compiling legacy C/C++ code into WebAssembly, highlighting the risks of\nsilent miscompilation and compile-time errors. We categorize these challenges\nbased on their root causes and propose corresponding solutions. We then\nintroduce a differential testing approach, implemented in a framework named\nWasmChecker, to investigate the semantics equivalency of code between native\nx86-64 and WebAssembly binaries. Using WasmChecker, we provide a witness that\nWebAssembly compilers do not necessarily preserve code semantics when\ncross-compiling high-level language code into WebAssembly due to different\nimplementations of standard libraries, unsupported system calls/APIs,\nWebAssembly's unique features, and compiler bugs. Furthermore, we have\nidentified 11 new bugs in the Emscripten compiler toolchain, all confirmed by\nEmscripten developers. As proof of concept, we make our framework and the\ncollected dataset of open-source codebases publicly available.",

The design space of TGNNs\nis notably complex, given the unique challenges in runtime efficiency and\nscalability raised by the evolving nature of temporal graphs. We contend that\nmany of the existing works on TGNN modeling inadequately explore the design\nspace, leading to suboptimal designs. Viewing TGNN models through a\nperformance-focused lens often obstructs a deeper understanding of the\nadvantages and disadvantages of each technique. Specifically, benchmarking\nefforts inherently evaluate models in their original designs and\nimplementations, resulting in unclear accuracy comparisons and misleading\nruntime. To address these shortcomings, we propose a practical comparative\nevaluation framework that performs a design space search across well-known TGNN\nmodules based on a unified, optimized code implementation. Using our framework,\nwe make the first efforts towards addressing three critical questions in TGNN\ndesign, spending over 10,000 GPU hours: (1) investigating the efficiency of\nTGNN module designs, (2) analyzing how the effectiveness of these modules\ncorrelates with dataset patterns, and (3) exploring the interplay between\nmultiple modules. Key outcomes of this directed investigative approach include\ndemonstrating that the most recent neighbor sampling and attention aggregator\noutperform uniform neighbor sampling and MLP-Mixer aggregator; Assessing static\nnode memory as an effective node memory alternative, and showing that the\nchoice between static or dynamic node memory should be based on the repetition\npatterns in the dataset.

Recently, a new probabilistic design\nscheme called distributionally robust fault detection (DRFD) has emerged and\nreceived immense interest. Despite its robustness against unknown distributions\nin practice, current DRFD focuses on the overall detectability of all possible\nfaults rather than the detectability of critical faults that are a priori\nknown. Henceforth, a new DRFD trade-off design scheme is put forward in this\nwork by utilizing prior fault information. The key contribution includes a\nnovel distributional robustness metric of detecting a known fault and a new\nrelaxed distributionally robust chance constraint that ensures robust\ndetectability. Then, a new DRFD design problem of fault detection under unknown\nprobability distributions is proposed, and this offers a flexible balance\nbetween the robustness of detecting known critical faults and the overall\ndetectability against all possible faults. To solve the resulting semi-infinite\nchance-constrained problem, we first reformulate it to a finite-dimensional\nproblem characterized by bilinear matrix inequalities (BMIs). Subsequently, a\ncustomized solution algorithm is developed, which includes a sequential\noptimization procedure and an initialization strategy. Finally, case studies on\na simulated three-tank system and a real-world battery cell are carried out to\nshowcase the usefulness of our DRFD method.",

Luminescence\nmeasurements were performed up to 10 GPa, while the Raman spectra were measured\nup to 20 GPa. The luminescence data revealed a linear blue shift of the\nemission maximum from about 2.5 eV at ambient pressure to 3.1 eV at 5 GPa and a\nstrong intensity quenching. The indirect-to-direct bandgap transition at about\n5 GPa, a phenomenon previously predicted only theoretically, was used to\nexplain the strong quenching of the luminescence. This model was confirmed by\nfitting luminescence intensity data and analysis of the luminescence decay\nkinetics, which exhibited a shortening of the pulse decay time with the\npressure increase. Raman spectra confirmed the stability of Cs2ZrCl6 up to 20\nGPa and showed no evidence of the pressure-induced structural phase\ntransitions. An energetic scheme of excitonic levels, which takes into account\nthe indirect-to-direct band gasp transition, was proposed to explain the rapid\nluminescence quenching with increasing pressure.",

    "abstract": "The multi-Higgs model (NHDM) is a class of new physics models that go beyond\nthe Standard Model with fewer assumptions, namely by postulating the existence\nof multiple Higgs doublets, while yielding a rich phenomenology. Among them,\nthe Four-Higgs-Doublet model (4HDM) has attracted increasing attention in\nrecent years, with nearly a hundred papers dedicated to its study. Scientists\nhave attempted to use it to explain many phenomena that the Standard Model\ncannot account for, such as dark matter, fermion mass hierarchies, neutrino\nmasses, cosmological phase transitions, and cosmic strings, among others. In\nthese efforts, imposing finite symmetries on the 4HDM is a standard procedure,\nbecause finite symmetries are central to explaining many physical phenomena,\nsuch as dark matter, and can also constrain excessively large parameter spaces\ntechnically. Therefore, given the recent attention to 4HDM and the importance\nof finite symmetries in model building, it is crucial from a mathematical\nperspective to classify all possible finite symmetries, as the classification\nresults can guide model construction and phenomenological studies. So far, two\nscenarios of discrete symmetries of 4HDM have been classified, but there are\nstill cases that haven't been studied. During our study, we found out\nsituations that have never appeared in 2HDM or 3HDM, and we developed many new\ntechniques to help us handle the difficulties. Therefore, before any further\nprogresses are made towards a full classification, it is timely to revisit the\ncurrent progress of 4HDM discrete symmetry classification in a\nbeginner-friendly manner, and to provide a look towards future research.",

In\nrecent years, Transformers have become state-of-the-art for this task, but\nsuffer from excessive memory requirements due to the need to explicitly store\nthe sequences.

Predicting users' watch times on videos often encounters\nfundamental challenges, including wide value ranges and imbalanced data\ndistributions, which can lead to significant estimation bias when directly\napplying regression techniques. Recent studies have attempted to address these\nissues by converting the continuous watch time estimation into an ordinal\nregression task. While these methods demonstrate partial effectiveness, they\nexhibit notable limitations: (1) the discretization process frequently relies\non bucket partitioning, inherently reducing prediction flexibility and accuracy\nand (2) the interdependencies among different partition intervals remain\nunderutilized, missing opportunities for effective error correction.\n  Inspired by language modeling paradigms, we propose a novel Generative\nRegression (GR) framework that reformulates WTP as a sequence generation task.\nOur approach employs \\textit{structural discretization} to enable nearly\nlossless value reconstruction while maintaining prediction fidelity. Through\ncarefully designed vocabulary construction and label encoding schemes, each\nwatch time is bijectively mapped to a token sequence. To mitigate the\ntraining-inference discrepancy caused by teacher-forcing, we introduce a\n\\textit{curriculum learning with embedding mixup} strategy that gradually\ntransitions from guided to free-generation modes. We evaluate our method\nagainst state-of-the-art approaches on two public datasets and one industrial\ndataset.

To address this, a\nsequential optimal transportation approach is used to generate a\nmodel-consistent sample by mapping observations from a flexible reduced-form to\nthe structural conditional distribution iteratively. Filtered series from the\ngenerated sample are model-consistent. Specializing to linear processes, a\nclosed-form Optimal Transport Filtering algorithm is derived. Minimizing the\ndiscrepancy between generated and actual observations defines an Optimal\nTransport Estimator. Its large sample properties are derived.

By contrast, in harmonic games - the strategic counterpart\nof potential games, where players have conflicting interests - very little is\nknown outside the narrow subclass of 2-player zero-sum games with a fully-mixed\nequilibrium. Our paper seeks to partially fill this gap by focusing on the full\nclass of (generalized) harmonic games and examining the convergence properties\nof follow-the-regularized-leader (FTRL), the most widely studied class of\nno-regret learning schemes. As a first result, we show that the continuous-time\ndynamics of FTRL are Poincar\\'e recurrent, that is, they return arbitrarily\nclose to their starting point infinitely often, and hence fail to converge. In\ndiscrete time, the standard, \"vanilla\" implementation of FTRL may lead to even\nworse outcomes, eventually trapping the players in a perpetual cycle of\nbest-responses. However, if FTRL is augmented with a suitable extrapolation\nstep - which includes as special cases the optimistic and mirror-prox variants\nof FTRL - we show that learning converges to a Nash equilibrium from any\ninitial condition, and all players are guaranteed at most O(1) regret. These\nresults provide an in-depth understanding of no-regret learning in harmonic\ngames, nesting prior work on 2-player zero-sum games, and showing at a high\nlevel that harmonic games are the canonical complement of potential games, not\nonly from a strategic, but also from a dynamic viewpoint.",

But the model utility easily suffers significant\nreduction during unlearning due to the gradient conflicts.

To make more effective use of supplementary demonstrations, we\nintroduce meta-goal in ILMAR to optimize the functional of the advantage\nfunction by explicitly minimizing the distance between the current policy and\nthe expert policy.

In this paper,\nwe propose DecDEC, an inference scheme that improves the quality of low-bit\nLLMs while preserving the key benefits of quantization: GPU memory savings and\nlatency reduction. DecDEC stores the residual matrix -- the difference between\nfull-precision and quantized weights -- in CPU, and dynamically fetches the\nresiduals for only a small portion of the weights. This portion corresponds to\nthe salient channels, marked by activation outliers, with the fetched residuals\nhelping to correct quantization errors in these channels.

Specifically, we define and\napply normalization criteria, mapping loop nests with different memory access\npatterns to the same canonical form. Since the memory access pattern is\nsusceptible to loop variations and critical for performance, this normalization\nallows many loop nests to be optimized by the same optimization recipe. To\nevaluate our approach, we apply the normalization with optimizations designed\nfor only the canonical form, improving the performance of many different loop\nnest variants.

This task aims to identify groups of objects\nthat travel together along a common route, which offers effective support for\ngovernment agencies in enhancing smart city management. However, the previous\nwork has made a strong assumption on the accuracy of recovered trajectories\nfrom videos and their co-movement pattern definition requires the group of\nobjects to appear across consecutive cameras along the common route. In\npractice, this often leads to missing patterns if a vehicle is not correctly\nidentified from a certain camera due to object occlusion or vehicle\nmis-matching. To address this challenge, we propose a relaxed definition of\nco-movement patterns from video data, which removes the consecutiveness\nrequirement in the common route and accommodates a certain number of missing\ncaptured cameras for objects within the group. Moreover, a novel enumeration\nframework called MaxGrowth is developed to efficiently retrieve the relaxed\npatterns. Unlike previous filter-and-refine frameworks comprising both\ncandidate enumeration and subsequent candidate verification procedures,\nMaxGrowth incurs no verification cost for the candidate patterns. It treats the\nco-movement pattern as an equivalent sequence of clusters, enumerating\ncandidates with increasing sequence length while avoiding the generation of any\nfalse positives. Additionally, we also propose two effective pruning rules to\nefficiently filter the non-maximal patterns. Extensive experiments are\nconducted to validate the efficiency of MaxGrowth and the quality of its\ngenerated co-movement patterns. Our MaxGrowth runs up to two orders of\nmagnitude faster than the baseline algorithm. It also demonstrates high\naccuracy in real video dataset when the trajectory recovery algorithm is not\nperfect.",

The set-valued objective function of the optimization\nproblem under consideration is defined by finitely many continuously\ndifferentiable vector-valued functions. For such optimization problems, at\nfirst, we propose a general scheme for nonlinear conjugate gradient methods and\nthen introduce Dai-Yuan, Polak-Ribi{\\`e}re-Polyak, and Hestenes-Stiefel\nconjugate gradient parameters for set-valued functions. Toward deriving the\ngeneral scheme, we introduce a condition of sufficient decrease and Wolfe line\nsearches for set-valued functions. For a given sequence of descent directions\nof a set-valued function, it is found that if the proposed standard Wolfe line\nsearch technique is employed, then the generated sequence of iterates for set\noptimization follows a Zoutendijk-like condition. With the help of the derived\nZoutendijk-like condition, we report that all the proposed nonlinear conjugate\ngradient schemes are globally convergent under usual assumptions. It is\nimportant to note that the ordering cone used in the entire study is not\nrestricted to be finitely generated, and no regularity assumption on the\nsolution set of the problem is required for any of the reported convergence\nanalyses. Finally, we demonstrate the performance of the proposed methods\nthrough numerical experiments.

    "abstract": "The expansion of large language models (LLMs) with hundreds of billions of\nparameters presents significant challenges to computational resources,\nparticularly data movement and memory bandwidth. Long-context LLMs, which\nprocess sequences of tens of thousands of tokens, further increase the demand\non the memory system as the complexity in attention layers and key-value cache\nsizes is proportional to the context length. Processing-in-Memory (PIM)\nmaximizes memory bandwidth by moving compute to the data and can address the\nmemory bandwidth challenges; however, PIM is not necessarily scalable to\naccelerate long-context LLM because of limited per-module memory capacity and\nthe inflexibility of fixed-functional unit PIM architecture and static memory\nmanagement. In this work, we propose LoL-PIM which is a multi-node PIM\narchitecture that accelerates long context LLM through hardware-software\nco-design. In particular, we propose how pipeline parallelism can be exploited\nacross a multi-PIM module while a direct PIM access (DPA) controller (or DMA\nfor PIM) is proposed that enables dynamic PIM memory management and results in\nefficient PIM utilization across a diverse range of context length. We\ndeveloped an MLIR-based compiler for LoL-PIM extending a commercial PIM-based\ncompiler where the software modifications were implemented and evaluated, while\nthe hardware changes were modeled in the simulator. Our evaluations demonstrate\nthat LoL-PIM significantly improves throughput and reduces latency for\nlong-context LLM inference, outperforming both multi-GPU and GPU-PIM systems\n(up to 8.54x and 16.0x speedup, respectively), thereby enabling more efficient\ndeployment of LLMs in real-world applications.",

To this end, the task of\nAdverse Condition Depth Estimation (ACDE) has gained significant attention.\nPrevious approaches in ACDE have primarily relied on generative models, which\nnecessitate additional target images to convert the sunny condition into\nadverse weather, or learnable parameters for feature augmentation to adapt\ndomain gaps, resulting in increased model complexity and tuning efforts.\nFurthermore, unlike CLIP-based methods where textual and visual features have\nbeen pre-aligned, depth estimation models lack sufficient alignment between\nmultimodal features, hindering coherent understanding under adverse conditions.\nTo address these limitations, we propose Multi-Modality Driven LoRA (MMD-LoRA),\nwhich leverages low-rank adaptation matrices for efficient fine-tuning from\nsource-domain to target-domain. It consists of two core components: Prompt\nDriven Domain Alignment (PDDA) and Visual-Text Consistent Contrastive\nLearning(VTCCL). During PDDA, the image encoder with MMD-LoRA generates\ntarget-domain visual representations, supervised by alignment loss that the\nsource-target difference between language and image should be equal.

The blackbody\nfabricated using this technique can be applied for online calibration in\nvarious extreme environments, significantly improving measurement accuracy and\nservice life.",

Second, the channel measurement rate proves inadequate to\nestimate high moving speeds. To overcome these issues, we present ASE, an\naccurate and robust Acoustic Speed Estimation system on a single commodity\nmicrophone. We model the sound propagation from a unique perspective of the\nacoustic diffusion field, and infer the speed from the acoustic spatial\ndistribution, a completely different way of thinking about speed estimation\nbeyond prior DFS-based approaches. We then propose a novel Orthogonal\nTime-Delayed Multiplexing (OTDM) scheme for acoustic channel estimation at a\nhigh rate that was previously infeasible, making it possible to estimate high\nspeeds. We further develop novel techniques for motion detection and signal\nenhancement to deliver a robust and practical system. We implement and evaluate\nASE through extensive real-world experiments. Our results show that ASE\nreliably tracks walking speed, independently of target location and direction,\nwith a mean error of 0.13 m/s, a reduction of 2.5x from DFS, and a detection\nrate of 97.4% for large coverage, e.g., free walking in a 4m $\\times$ 4m room.\nWe believe ASE pushes acoustic speed estimation beyond the conventional\nDFS-based paradigm and will inspire exciting research in acoustic sensing.",

    "abstract": "Significant progress has been made in automated problem-solving using\nsocieties of agents powered by large language models (LLMs). In finance,\nefforts have largely focused on single-agent systems handling specific tasks or\nmulti-agent frameworks independently gathering data. However, the multi-agent\nsystems' potential to replicate real-world trading firms' collaborative\ndynamics remains underexplored. TradingAgents proposes a novel stock trading\nframework inspired by trading firms, featuring LLM-powered agents in\nspecialized roles such as fundamental analysts, sentiment analysts, technical\nanalysts, and traders with varied risk profiles. The framework includes Bull\nand Bear researcher agents assessing market conditions, a risk management team\nmonitoring exposure, and traders synthesizing insights from debates and\nhistorical data to make informed decisions. By simulating a dynamic,\ncollaborative trading environment, this framework aims to improve trading\nperformance. Detailed architecture and extensive experiments reveal its\nsuperiority over baseline models, with notable improvements in cumulative\nreturns, Sharpe ratio, and maximum drawdown, highlighting the potential of\nmulti-agent LLM frameworks in financial trading.

    ],
    "abstract": "The goal of this note is to generalize Thurston's Topological\nCharacterization of Rational Functions to the setting when both the covering\ndegree and the set of marked points are infinite. A relevant class of branched\ncoverings are transcendental entire functions with finitely many singular\nvalues whose orbits escape to (or, more generally, accumulate ``near'')\n$\\infty$. Given a branched covering $f$ mimicking such post-singular behaviour,\none wants to decide whether it is Thurston equivalent to an entire function.\nThe answer is positive for a big class of entire function and generic escaping\nsingular orbits.\n  As in the Thurston's theorem, the problem reduces to the study of the\npull-back map $\\sigma$ defined on the corresponding Teichm\\\"uller space. But,\nunlike in the rational case, the space is infinite-dimensional and the\nbranching structure near $\\infty$ (which is essential singularity) is much more\nsubtle depending on the family of functions under consideration. A general\napproach is possible for entire functions defined by asymptotic area property\nintroduced in the article. Roughly, it implies that asymptotic tracts fill all\nspace near $\\infty$ even when their range shrinks.\n  The main result provides a sufficient condition for existence in the\nTeichm\\\"uller space of a $\\sigma$-invariant subset which looks like a\nfinite-dimensional compact: forgetting marked infinite tails of every orbit\nyields a compact set, while forgetting a long enough initial part of every\norbit yields a small perturbation of the identity homeomorphism. The statement\nremains valid even in case of non-escaping unbounded singular orbits and allows\nto deduce existence of a fixed point of $\\sigma$ in many relevant cases.",

However, the related\nand systematic study based on a realistic material system is still limited. As\nthe only experimentally realized antiferromagnetic topological insulator,\nMnBi$_{2}$Te$_{4}$ becomes a vital platform for exploring various topological\nstates. In this work, by using the comprehensive first-principles calculations,\nwe demonstrate that the QAHE can also be realized in compensated\nantiferromagnetic even-septuple-layer MnBi$_{2}$Te$_{4}$ without combined\nparity-time ($\\mathcal{PT}$) symmetry. Using a magnetic topological insulator\nmodel, the layer-resolved Chern number is calculated to further understand the\nphysical origin of different Chern numbers. The application of external\nhydrostatic pressure can strengthen the Te-Te quasicovalent bond due to the\ndramatic compression of the van der Waals gap. Thus, the resulting topological\nnontrivial gap can exceed the room-temperature energy scale in a wide range of\npressures. Additionally, we find that constructing MnBi$_{2}$Te$_{4}$/CrI$_{3}$\nheterostructure can realize the compensated antiferromagnetic configurations\nwith QAHE. Our findings illustrate the realization of QAHE in compensated\nantiferromagnetic even-septuple-layer MnBi$_{2}$Te$_{4}$ and provide a reliable\nstrategy to obtain the corresponding magnetic configurations.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we construct novel asymptotically locally AdS$_5$ black hole\nsolutions of Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory at the Chern-Simons point, supported\nby a scalar field that generates primary hair. The strength of the scalar field\nis governed by an independent integration constant; when this constant\nvanishes, the spacetime reduces to a black hole geometry devoid of hair. The\nexistence of these solutions is intrinsically tied to the horizon metric, which\nis modeled by three non-trivial Thurston geometries: Nil, Solv, and\n$SL(2,\\mathbb{R})$. The quadratic part of the scalar field action corresponds\nto a conformally coupled scalar in five dimensions -an invariance of the matter\nsector that is explicitly broken by the introduction of a quartic\nself-interaction. These black holes are characterized by two distinct\nparameters: the horizon radius and the temperature. Notably, there exists a\nstraight line in this parameter space along which the horizon geometry exhibits\nenhanced isometries, corresponding to solutions previously reported in JHEP 02,\n014 (2014). Away from this line, for a fixed horizon radius and temperatures\nabove or below a critical value, the metric's isometries undergo spontaneous\nbreaking. Employing the Regge-Teitelboim approach, we compute the mass and\nentropy of these solutions, both of which vanish. Despite this, only one of the\nintegration constants can be interpreted as hair, as the other modifies the\nlocal geometry at the conformal boundary. Finally, for Solv horizon geometries,\nwe extend these hairy solutions to six dimensions.",

Using different equations of state that include nucleons,\nhyperons, and/or $\\Delta$ resonances, we compute stellar configurations and\nexamine their fundamental mode frequencies in two limiting scenarios. In one\nlimit, nuclear reactions are fast enough to maintain chemical equilibrium\nthroughout the pulsation, resulting in a lower effective adiabatic index,\n$\\Gamma_{\\mathrm{EQ}}$, and softer stellar responses. In the opposite limit,\nnuclear reactions are too slow to adjust particle abundances during\noscillations, yielding a higher index, $\\Gamma_{\\mathrm{FR}}$, and stiffer\nstellar responses. We find that the equilibrium scenario triggers dynamic\ninstability at the maximum mass configuration, whereas the frozen composition\nscenario allows stable solutions to persist beyond this mass, extending the\nstable branch. This effect is modest for simpler equations of state, but\nbecomes increasingly pronounced for more complex compositions, where the\nemergence of new particle species at high densities leads to a significant\ndisparity between $\\Gamma_{\\mathrm{EQ}}$ and $\\Gamma_{\\mathrm{FR}}$. Realistic\nconditions, in which different nuclear reactions have distinct timescales, will\nplace the effective $\\Gamma$ between these two extreme values. Short-timescale\nreactions push the star toward the equilibrium limit, potentially restricting\nthe length of the stable branch. Conversely, slow reactions preserve a frozen\ncomposition, allowing the stable branch to grow. Thus, the actual extent of the\nstable configuration range depends critically on the interplay between\nnuclear-reaction timescales and the star's fundamental oscillation period.",

We investigate the resulting discrete solution space, the\naccuracy, and the computational cost of these spatial discretization schemes.\nTo fulfill the required C1 continuity of the rod formulation, the nodal scheme\ndiscretizes the rod in terms of its nodal positions and directors using cubic\nHermite splines. Isogeometric discretizations naturally fulfill this with\nsmooth spline basis functions and discretize the rod only in terms of the\npositions of the control points [2], which leads to a discrete solution in\nmultiple copies of the Euclidean space R3. They enable the employment of basis\nfunctions of one degree lower, i.e. quadratic C1 splines, and possibly reduce\nthe number of degrees of freedom. When using the nodal scheme, since the\ndefined director field is in the unit sphere S2, preserving this for the nodal\ndirector variable field requires an additional constraint of unit nodal\ndirectors. This leads to a discrete solution in multiple copies of the manifold\nR3xS2, however, results in zero nodal axial stress values. Allowing arbitrary\nlength for the nodal directors, i.e. a nodal director field in R3 instead of S2\nas within discrete rod elements, eliminates the constrained nodal axial\nstresses and leads to a discrete solution in multiple copies of R3. To enforce\nthe unit nodal director constraint, we discuss two approaches using the\nLagrange multiplier and penalty methods.

Firstly, we introduce a family\nof simple, experimentally feasible orthogonality graphs (measurement\ncompatibility structures) for which the maximum violation of the corresponding\nnon-contextuality inequalities allows to certify the maximum amount of $\\log_2\nd$ bits of randomness from a qu$d$it system with projective measurements for $d\n\\geq 3$.

We frame a relaxation of this condition in terms of\n$\\epsilon$-orthogonality graphs for a parameter $\\epsilon > 0$, and derive\nquantum correlations that allow to certify randomness for arbitrary relaxation\n$\\epsilon \\in [0,1)$. Thirdly, it is well known that a single qubit is\nnon-contextual, i.e., the qubit correlations can be explained by a\nnon-contextual hidden variable (NCHV) model.

Theoretically we show that in the\nlong-time limit this multi-agent reinforcement learning process always\neventually results in indefinite contribution to the public good or indefinite\ndefection (no agent contributing to the public good). However, by simulation of\nthe pre-limit behavior, we see that on complex network structures there may be\nmixed states in which the process seems to stabilize before actual convergence\nto states in which agent beliefs and actions are all the same. In these\nmetastable states the local network characteristics can determine whether\nagents have high or low trust in their neighbors.

    "abstract": "Regularization is a widely recognized technique in mathematical optimization.\nIt can be used to smooth out objective functions, refine the feasible solution\nset, or prevent overfitting in machine learning models. Due to its simplicity\nand robustness, the gradient descent (GD) method is one of the primary methods\nused for numerical optimization of differentiable objective functions. However,\nGD is not well-suited for solving $\\ell^1$ regularized optimization problems\nsince these problems are non-differentiable at zero, causing iteration updates\nto oscillate or fail to converge. Instead, a more effective version of GD,\ncalled the proximal gradient descent employs a technique known as\nsoft-thresholding to shrink the iteration updates toward zero, thus enabling\nsparsity in the solution. Motivated by the widespread applications of proximal\nGD in sparse and low-rank recovery across various engineering disciplines, we\nprovide an overview of the GD and proximal GD methods for solving regularized\noptimization problems. Furthermore, this paper proposes a novel algorithm for\nthe proximal GD method that incorporates a variable step size. Unlike\nconventional proximal GD, which uses a fixed step size based on the global\nLipschitz constant, our method estimates the Lipschitz constant locally at each\niteration and uses its reciprocal as the step size. This eliminates the need\nfor a global Lipschitz constant, which can be impractical to compute. Numerical\nexperiments we performed on synthetic and real-data sets show notable\nperformance improvement of the proposed method compared to the conventional\nproximal GD with constant step size, both in terms of number of iterations and\nin time requirements.",

We rationalise these experimental results by using band structure and\nspin accumulation calculations that are consistent with an interfacial\nspin-to-charge conversion mediated by inverse Rashba-Edelstein effect at the\nMoSe2/PtSe2 interface and being tuned by ferroelectricity in the adjacent\nLiNbO3 surface. This work points out the relevance of field effect spin-orbit\narchitectures for novel THz technologies.",

However, processing\nthe massive number of visual tokens incurs a significant computational cost.\nExisting analysis of the MLLM attention mechanisms remains shallow, leading to\ncoarse-grain token pruning strategies that fail to effectively balance speed\nand accuracy. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive investigation of MLLM\nattention mechanisms with LLaVA. We find that numerous visual tokens and\npartial attention computations are redundant during the decoding process. Based\non this insight, we propose Spatial-Temporal Visual Token Trimming\n($\\textbf{ST}^{3}$), a framework designed to accelerate MLLM inference without\nretraining. $\\textbf{ST}^{3}$ consists of two primary components: 1)\nProgressive Visual Token Pruning (\\textbf{PVTP}), which eliminates inattentive\nvisual tokens across layers, and 2) Visual Token Annealing (\\textbf{VTA}),\nwhich dynamically reduces the number of visual tokens in each layer as the\ngenerated tokens grow. Together, these techniques deliver around\n$\\mathbf{2\\times}$ faster inference with only about $\\mathbf{30\\%}$ KV cache\nmemory compared to the original LLaVA, while maintaining consistent performance\nacross various datasets.

Additionally, a\nreward function is designed to encourage strategies for obstacle avoidance,\nterrain following, terrain avoidance, and safe flight.

We explore whether\nselection of a sufficiently large domain size, together with the appropriate\nselection of parameters, can give rise to the development of patterns on\nnon-convex geometries e.g. annulus. Hence, the key research methodology and\noutcomes of our studies include: a complete analytical exploration of the\nspatiotemporal dynamics in an activator-depleted reaction-diffusion system; a\nlinear stability analysis to characterise the dual roles of cross-diffusion and\ndomain size of pattern formation on an annulus region; the derivation of the\ninstability conditions through lower and upper bounds of the domain size; the\nfull classification of the model parameters, and a demonstration of how\ncross-diffusion relaxes the general conditions for the reaction-diffusion\nsystem to exhibit pattern formation. To validate theoretical findings and\npredictions, we employ the finite element method to reveal spatial and\nspatiotemporal patterns in the dynamics of the cross-diffusive\nreaction-diffusion system within a two-dimensional annular domain.

    "abstract": "Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs), observed at large redshifts, are probes of the\nevolution of the Universe and can be used as cosmological tools. To this end,\nwe need tight (with small dispersion) correlations among key parameters. To\nreduce such a dispersion, we will mitigate gaps in light curves (LCs),\nincluding the plateau region, key to building the two-dimensional Dainotti\nrelation between the end time of plateau emission (Ta) to its luminosity (La).\nWe reconstruct LCs using nine models: Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Bi-Mamba,\nFourier Transform, Gaussian Process-Random Forest Hybrid (GP-RF), Bidirectional\nLong Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM), Conditional GAN (CGAN), SARIMAX-based Kalman\nfilter, Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), and Attention U-Net. These methods\nare compared to the Willingale model (W07) over a sample of 545 GRBs. MLP and\nBi-Mamba outperform other methods, with MLP reducing the plateau parameter\nuncertainties by 25.9% for log Ta, 28.6% for log Fa, and 37.7% for {\\alpha}\n(the post-plateau slope in the W07 model), achieving the lowest 5-fold cross\nvalidation (CV) mean squared error (MSE) of 0.0275. Bi-Mamba achieved the\nlowest uncertainty of parameters, a 33.3% reduction in log Ta, a 33.6%\nreduction in log Fa and a 41.9% in {\\alpha}, but with a higher MSE of 0.130.\nBi-Mamba brings the lowest outlier percentage for log Ta and log Fa (2.70%),\nwhile MLP carries {\\alpha} outliers to 0.900%. The other methods yield MSE\nvalues ranging from 0.0339 to 0.174. These improvements in parameter precision\nare needed to use GRBs as standard candles, investigate theoretical models, and\npredict GRB redshifts through machine learning.",

    "abstract": "In this brief and speculative commentary, we explore ideas inspired by neural\nnetworks in machine learning, proposing that a simple neural XOR motif,\ninvolving both excitatory and inhibitory connections, may provide the basis for\na relevant mode of plasticity in neural circuits of living organisms, with\nhomeostasis as the sole guiding principle. This XOR motif simply signals the\ndiscrepancy between incoming signals and reference signals, thereby providing a\nbasis for a loss function in learning neural circuits, and at the same time\nregulating homeostasis by halting the propagation of these incoming signals.\nThe core motif uses a 4:1 ratio of excitatory to inhibitory neurons, and\nsupports broader neural patterns such as the well-known 'winner takes all'\n(WTA) mechanism. We examined the prevalence of the XOR motif in the published\nconnectomes of various organisms with increasing complexity, and found that it\nranges from tens (in C. elegans) to millions (in several Drosophila neuropils)\nand more than tens of millions (in mouse V1 visual cortex). If validated, our\nhypothesis identifies two of the three key components in analogy to machine\nlearning models: the architecture and the loss function.

The study explores the influence of both general and specific\nmetric factors in determining vulnerability scores, providing new perspectives\non potential enhancements to these metrics.\n  This study adopts a quantitative approach, calculating and comparing the\ncoefficient of variation of vulnerability scores across 56 adversarial attacks\non LLMs. The attacks, sourced from various research papers, and obtained\nthrough online databases, were evaluated using multiple vulnerability metrics.\nScores were determined by averaging the values assessed by three distinct LLMs.\nThe results indicate that existing scoring-systems yield vulnerability scores\nwith minimal variation across different attacks, suggesting that many of the\nmetric factors are inadequate for assessing adversarial attacks on LLMs. This\nis particularly true for context-specific factors or those with predefined\nvalue sets, such as those in CVSS.

    "abstract": "With the development of coastal construction, a large amount of\nhuman-generated waste, particularly plastic debris, is continuously entering\nthe ocean, posing a severe threat to marine ecosystems. The key to effectively\naddressing plastic pollution lies in the ability to autonomously monitor such\ndebris. Currently, marine debris monitoring primarily relies on optical\nsensors, but these methods are limited in their applicability to underwater and\nseafloor areas due to low-visibility constraints. The acoustic camera, also\nknown as high-resolution forward-looking sonar (FLS), has demonstrated\nconsiderable potential in the autonomous monitoring of marine debris, as they\nare unaffected by water turbidity and dark environments. The appearance of\ntargets in sonar images changes with variations in the imaging viewpoint, while\nchallenges such as low signal-to-noise ratio, weak textures, and imaging\ndistortions in sonar imagery present significant obstacles to debris monitoring\nbased on prior class labels. This paper proposes an optical flow-based method\nfor marine debris monitoring, aiming to fully utilize the time series\ninformation captured by the acoustic camera to enhance the performance of\nmarine debris monitoring without relying on prior category labels of the\ntargets. The proposed method was validated through experiments conducted in a\ncirculating water tank, demonstrating its feasibility and robustness.

Recently,\nMamba has shown great potential for modeling long-range dependencies with\nlinear complexity, providing an effective solution to the above dilemma. To\nthis end, we propose a lightweight and effective Mamba-based network named\nSTNMamba, which incorporates carefully designed Mamba modules to enhance the\nlearning of spatial-temporal normality. Firstly, we develop a dual-encoder\narchitecture, where the spatial encoder equipped with Multi-Scale Vision Space\nState Blocks (MS-VSSB) extracts multi-scale appearance features, and the\ntemporal encoder employs Channel-Aware Vision Space State Blocks (CA-VSSB) to\ncapture significant motion patterns. Secondly, a Spatial-Temporal Interaction\nModule (STIM) is introduced to integrate spatial and temporal information\nacross multiple levels, enabling effective modeling of intrinsic\nspatial-temporal consistency. Within this module, the Spatial-Temporal Fusion\nBlock (STFB) is proposed to fuse the spatial and temporal features into a\nunified feature space, and the memory bank is utilized to store\nspatial-temporal prototypes of normal patterns, restricting the model's ability\nto represent anomalies. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets\ndemonstrate that our STNMamba achieves competitive performance with fewer\nparameters and lower computational costs than existing methods.",

We try to answer the following\nfundamental question: With only a fractional bandwidth allocated to the user\nwith sensing task, can the same delay resolution and unambiguous range be\nachieved as if all bandwidth were allocated to it? We affirmatively answer the\nquestion by proposing a novel two-stage delay estimation (TSDE) method that\nexploits the following facts: without increasing the allocated bandwidth,\nhigher delay resolution can be achieved via distributed subcarrier allocation\ncompared to its collocated counterpart, while there is a trade-off between\ndelay resolution and unambiguous range by varying the decimation factor of\nsubcarriers. Therefore, the key idea of the proposed TSDE method is to first\nperform coarse delay estimation with collocated subcarriers to achieve a large\nunambiguous range, and then use distributed subcarriers with optimized\ndecimation factor to enhance delay resolution while avoiding delay ambiguity.\nOur analysis shows that the proposed TSDE method can achieve the full-bandwidth\ndelay resolution and unambiguous range, by using only at most half of the full\nbandwidth, provided that the channel delay spread is less than half of the\nunambiguous range. Numerical results show the superiority of the proposed\nmethod over the conventional method with collocated subcarriers.",

Many models\nof fish growth assume that the fish population in a habitat is homogenous,\nmeaning that there is no physiological spectrum and, therefore, no size\nspectrum. Moreover, models that account for the size spectrum are not always\nanalytically tractable. We present novel mathematical models of fish growth in\nwhich the body weight of each fish is assumed to follow a von Bertalanffy-type\nmodel whose proportionality coefficient, representing the maximum body weight,\nmay differ among individual fish. This probabilistic description introduces the\nsize spectrum into the model, owing to which the time-dependent probability\ndensity of this model is obtained explicitly. We also consider a misspecified\nversion and a stochastic version of the model as advanced cases. We apply the\nfirst model to the real growth data of Plecoglossus altivelis altivelis as a\nkeystone fish species in Japan. The model successfully reproduces the skewed\nsize spectrum of this fish species over multiple years. We further use the\nstochastic model to investigate how fish growth dynamics are affected by\nenvironmental fluctuations.",

Our proposed\nmethod optimizes each agent's policy using the heterogeneous-agent proximal\npolicy optimization algorithm, allowing agents to autonomously decide whether\nto communicate or to explore, that is whether to share the locally collected\nmaps or continue the exploration.

    "abstract": "Text-guided image editing model has achieved great success in general domain.\nHowever, directly applying these models to the fashion domain may encounter two\nissues: (1) Inaccurate localization of editing region; (2) Weak editing\nmagnitude. To address these issues, the MADiff model is proposed. Specifically,\nto more accurately identify editing region, the MaskNet is proposed, in which\nthe foreground region, densepose and mask prompts from large language model are\nfed into a lightweight UNet to predict the mask for editing region. To\nstrengthen the editing magnitude, the Attention-Enhanced Diffusion Model is\nproposed, where the noise map, attention map, and the mask from MaskNet are fed\ninto the proposed Attention Processor to produce a refined noise map. By\nintegrating the refined noise map into the diffusion model, the edited image\ncan better align with the target prompt. Given the absence of benchmarks in\nfashion image editing, we constructed a dataset named Fashion-E, comprising\n28390 image-text pairs in the training set, and 2639 image-text pairs for four\ntypes of fashion tasks in the evaluation set. Extensive experiments on\nFashion-E demonstrate that our proposed method can accurately predict the mask\nof editing region and significantly enhance editing magnitude in fashion image\nediting compared to the state-of-the-art methods.",

The integration of deep\nlearning technology has significantly improved the efficiency and accuracy of\nintelligent Raman spectroscopy (RS) recognition. However, the current RS\nrecognition methods based on deep neural networks still require the annotation\nof a large amount of spectral data, which is labor-intensive. This paper\npresents a novel annotation-efficient Self-Calibrated Dual Contrasting (SCDC)\nmethod for RS recognition that operates effectively with few or no annotation.\nOur core motivation is to represent the spectrum from two different\nperspectives in two distinct subspaces: embedding and category. The embedding\nperspective captures instance-level information, while the category perspective\nreflects category-level information. Accordingly, we have implemented a dual\ncontrastive learning approach from two perspectives to obtain discriminative\nrepresentations, which are applicable for Raman spectroscopy recognition under\nboth unsupervised and semi-supervised learning conditions. Furthermore, a\nself-calibration mechanism is proposed to enhance robustness. Validation of the\nidentification task on three large-scale bacterial Raman spectroscopy datasets\ndemonstrates that our SCDC method achieves robust recognition performance with\nvery few (5$\\%$ or 10$\\%$) or no annotations, highlighting the potential of the\nproposed method for biospectral identification in annotation-efficient clinical\nscenarios.",

We introduce a spatial\ndiscretization method to encode neighbour states into feature vectors, serving\ntogether with pedestrian pushing tendencies as inputs to a random forest model\nfor predicting pushing behaviours.

However, the state-of-the-art device\ndesigns face scalability challenges, notably in achieving tunable two-qubit\ncoupling and ensuring qubit addressability. Here, we propose a\nsurface-code-compatible architecture, where each module has both tunable\ntwo-qubit gates and addressable single-qubit gates by introducing only a single\nextra donor in a pair of donors. We found that to compromise between the\nrequirement of tunability and that of addressability, an asymmetric scheme is\nnecessary. In this scheme, the introduced extra donor is strongly\ntunnel-coupled to one of the donor spin qubits for addressable single-qubit\noperation, while being more weakly coupled to the other to ensure the turning\non and off of the two-qubit operation. The fidelity of single-qubit and\ntwo-qubit gates can exceed the fault-tolerant threshold in our design.\nAdditionally, the asymmetric scheme effectively mitigates valley oscillations,\nallowing for engineering precision tolerances up to a few nanometers. Thus, our\nproposed scheme presents a promising prototype for large-scale, fault-tolerant,\ndonor-based spin quantum processors.",

A key challenge is\nidentifying appropriate quasiparticle states that canonically transform between\nmomentum and real space while retaining the correlation, entanglement, and\ngeometric properties - generally called the Wannier obstruction. Here, we\nintroduce a phase-space approach to bypass these obstructions. Instead of\ntreating the phase space as a manifold, we embed a real space through a Bloch\nvector space at each momentum. Orbital and spin states are introduced through\nproduct states with the Bloch vector, while quantum statistics, correlations,\ntopology, and entanglements are inherited from the Hamiltonian. We apply this\nframework to explore the unconventional pairing symmetry and the Bogoliubov-de\nGennes (BdG) equation in phase space. Our findings demonstrate that while\nsuperconductivity exhibits global coherence, the local Wannier orbital symmetry\nprimarily determines the pairing symmetry. We analytically solve the\nspin-fluctuation-mediated pairing symmetry on the phase space by engineering a\nflat band with artificial gauge fields. We validate the model on the\nsquare-octagon superconductor Lu$_2$Fe$_3$Si$_5$ using density functional\ntheory (DFT), revealing the coexistence of nodeless $s^{\\pm}$ and nodal\n$s_{z^2}$ pairing symmetries.

In the aspect\nof structure, real-world networks usually exhibit clear community structure and\nscale-free (long-tailed distribution) properties.

    "abstract": "The goal of this work is to generate natural speech in multiple languages\nwhile maintaining the same speaker identity, a task known as cross-lingual\nspeech synthesis. A key challenge of cross-lingual speech synthesis is the\nlanguage-speaker entanglement problem, which causes the quality of\ncross-lingual systems to lag behind that of intra-lingual systems. In this\npaper, we propose CrossSpeech++, which effectively disentangles language and\nspeaker information and significantly improves the quality of cross-lingual\nspeech synthesis. To this end, we break the complex speech generation pipeline\ninto two simple components: language-dependent and speaker-dependent\ngenerators. The language-dependent generator produces linguistic variations\nthat are not biased by specific speaker attributes. The speaker-dependent\ngenerator models acoustic variations that characterize speaker identity. By\nhandling each type of information in separate modules, our method can\neffectively disentangle language and speaker representation. We conduct\nextensive experiments using various metrics, and demonstrate that CrossSpeech++\nachieves significant improvements in cross-lingual speech synthesis,\noutperforming existing methods by a large margin.",

    "abstract": "While modern visual recognition systems have made significant advancements,\nmany continue to struggle with the open problem of learning from few exemplars.\nThis paper focuses on the task of object detection in the setting where object\nclasses follow a natural long-tailed distribution. Existing methods for\nlong-tailed detection resort to external ImageNet labels to augment the\nlow-shot training instances. However, such dependency on a large labeled\ndatabase has limited utility in practical scenarios. We propose a versatile and\nscalable approach to leverage optional unlabeled images, which are easy to\ncollect without the burden of human annotations. Our SimLTD framework is\nstraightforward and intuitive, and consists of three simple steps: (1)\npre-training on abundant head classes; (2) transfer learning on scarce tail\nclasses; and (3) fine-tuning on a sampled set of both head and tail classes.\nOur approach can be viewed as an improved head-to-tail model transfer paradigm\nwithout the added complexities of meta-learning or knowledge distillation, as\nwas required in past research. By harnessing supplementary unlabeled images,\nwithout extra image labels, SimLTD establishes new record results on the\nchallenging LVIS v1 benchmark across both supervised and semi-supervised\nsettings.",

    "abstract": "Inverse problems exist in many disciplines of science and engineering. In\ncomputer vision, for example, tasks such as inpainting, deblurring, and super\nresolution can be effectively modeled as inverse problems. Recently, denoising\ndiffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) are shown to provide a promising\nsolution to noisy linear inverse problems without the need for additional task\nspecific training. Specifically, with the prior provided by DDPMs, one can\nsample from the posterior by approximating the likelihood. In the literature,\napproximations of the likelihood are often based on the mean of conditional\ndensities of the reverse process, which can be obtained using Tweedie formula.\nTo obtain a better approximation to the likelihood, in this paper we first\nderive a closed form formula for the covariance of the reverse process. Then,\nwe propose a method based on finite difference method to approximate this\ncovariance such that it can be readily obtained from the existing pretrained\nDDPMs, thereby not increasing the complexity compared to existing approaches.\nFinally, based on the mean and approximated covariance of the reverse process,\nwe present a new approximation to the likelihood. We refer to this method as\ncovariance-aware diffusion posterior sampling (CA-DPS). Experimental results\nshow that CA-DPS significantly improves reconstruction performance without\nrequiring hyperparameter tuning. The code for the paper is put in the\nsupplementary materials.",

DAVE is a\nmanually annotated dataset encompassing 16 diverse actor categories (spanning\nanimals, humans, vehicles, etc.) and 16 action types (complex and rare cases\nlike cut-ins, zigzag movement, U-turn, etc.), which require high reasoning\nability.

    "abstract": "Medication recommendation is one of the most critical health-related\napplications, which has attracted extensive research interest recently. Most\nexisting works focus on a single hospital with abundant medical data. However,\nmany small hospitals only have a few records, which hinders applying existing\nmedication recommendation works to the real world. Thus, we seek to explore a\nmore practical setting, i.e., multi-center medication recommendation. In this\nsetting, most hospitals have few records, but the total number of records is\nlarge. Though small hospitals may benefit from total affluent records, it is\nalso faced with the challenge that the data distributions between various\nhospitals are much different. In this work, we introduce a novel conTrastive\nprEtrain Model with Prompt Tuning (TEMPT) for multi-center medication\nrecommendation, which includes two stages of pretraining and finetuning. We\nfirst design two self-supervised tasks for the pretraining stage to learn\ngeneral medical knowledge. They are mask prediction and contrastive tasks,\nwhich extract the intra- and inter-relationships of input diagnosis and\nprocedures. Furthermore, we devise a novel prompt tuning method to capture the\nspecific information of each hospital rather than adopting the common\nfinetuning. On the one hand, the proposed prompt tuning can better learn the\nheterogeneity of each hospital to fit various distributions. On the other hand,\nit can also relieve the catastrophic forgetting problem of finetuning. To\nvalidate the proposed model, we conduct extensive experiments on the public\neICU, a multi-center medical dataset. The experimental results illustrate the\neffectiveness of our model.

To\nreduce the computational complexity of GGC, only mergers between clusters and\ntheir neighbors are considered.

While previous methods have made considerable efforts to optimize\nthe adaptation process, a crucial question remains: can the model adapt to\ncontinually-changing environments with preserved plasticity over a long time?\nThe plasticity refers to the model's capability to adjust predictions in\nresponse to non-stationary environments continually. In this work, we explore\nplasticity, this essential but often overlooked aspect of continual adaptation\nto facilitate more sustained adaptation in the long run. First, we observe that\nmost CTTA methods experience a steady and consistent decline in plasticity\nduring the long-timescale continual adaptation phase. Moreover, we find that\nthe loss of plasticity is strongly associated with the change in label flip.\nBased on this correlation, we propose a simple yet effective policy, Adaptive\nShrink-Restore (ASR), towards preserving the model's plasticity. In particular,\nASR does the weight re-initialization by the adaptive intervals. The adaptive\ninterval is determined based on the change in label flipping. Our method is\nvalidated on extensive CTTA benchmarks, achieving excellent performance.",

Our method consistently approximates a broad class of spectral\nstatistics across both high- and ultra-high-dimensional regimes, accommodating\nscenarios where the dimension-to-sample-size ratio $p/n$ converges to a nonzero\nconstant or diverges to infinity without requiring structural assumptions on\nthe population covariance matrix, such as eigenvalue decay or low effective\nrank. We showcase this universal bootstrap method for high-dimensional\ncovariance inference. Extensive simulations and a real-world data study support\nour findings, highlighting the favorable finite sample performance of the\nproposed universal bootstrap procedure.",

    "abstract": "This paper studies the problem of stochastic bilevel optimization where the\nupper-level function is nonconvex with potentially unbounded smoothness and the\nlower-level function is strongly convex. This problem is motivated by\nmeta-learning applied to sequential data, such as text classification using\nrecurrent neural networks, where the smoothness constant of the upper-level\nloss function scales linearly with the gradient norm and can be potentially\nunbounded. Existing algorithm crucially relies on the nested loop design, which\nrequires significant tuning efforts and is not practical. In this paper, we\naddress this issue by proposing a Single Loop bIlevel oPtimizer (SLIP). The\nproposed algorithm first updates the lower-level variable by a few steps of\nstochastic gradient descent, and then simultaneously updates the upper-level\nvariable by normalized stochastic gradient descent with momentum and the\nlower-level variable by stochastic gradient descent. Under standard\nassumptions, we show that our algorithm finds an $\\epsilon$-stationary point\nwithin $\\widetilde{O}(1/\\epsilon^4)$\\footnote{Here $\\widetilde{O}(\\cdot)$\ncompresses logarithmic factors of $1/\\epsilon$ and $1/\\delta$, where\n$\\delta\\in(0,1)$ denotes the failure probability.} oracle calls of stochastic\ngradient or Hessian-vector product, both in expectation and with high\nprobability. This complexity result is nearly optimal up to logarithmic factors\nwithout mean-square smoothness of the stochastic gradient oracle. Our proof\nrelies on (i) a refined characterization and control of the lower-level\nvariable and (ii) establishing a novel connection between bilevel optimization\nand stochastic optimization under distributional drift. Our experiments on\nvarious tasks show that our algorithm significantly outperforms strong\nbaselines in bilevel optimization.",

However,\nthese works were still unable to replicate the extraordinary success of\nlanguage-supervised visual foundation models due to the ineffective usage of\naligned protein-text paired data and the lack of an effective function-informed\npre-training paradigm. To address these issues, this paper curates a\nlarge-scale protein-text paired dataset called ProtAnno with a property-driven\nsampling strategy, and introduces a novel function-informed protein\npre-training paradigm. Specifically, the sampling strategy determines selecting\nprobability based on the sample confidence and property coverage, balancing the\ndata quality and data quantity in face of large-scale noisy data. Furthermore,\nmotivated by significance of the protein specific functional mechanism, the\nproposed paradigm explicitly model protein static and dynamic functional\nsegments by two segment-wise pre-training objectives, injecting fine-grained\ninformation in a function-informed manner. Leveraging all these innovations, we\ndevelop ProtCLIP, a multi-modality foundation model that comprehensively\nrepresents function-aware protein embeddings.

    "abstract": "To address the longstanding tension between the Constrained Minimal\nSupersymmetric Standard Model (CMSSM) and recent experimental data, we\ninvestigate non-universal gaugino masses within an SU(5) Grand Unified Theory\n(GUT) framework, focusing on the $\\tilde{g}$-SUGRA scenario where $\\lvert M_{3}\n\\rvert \\gg \\lvert M_{1} \\rvert, \\lvert M_{2} \\rvert$. This hierarchy enables a\nheavier gluino, thereby evading current experimental bounds on supersymmetric\nparticles. Our analysis reveals that precise Higgs measurements place stringent\nconstraints on the model, requiring $\\tan\\beta \\gtrsim 5$ and $ M_{0} \\gtrsim\n20 \\, \\tan\\beta \\,\\text{GeV}$. Although the $\\tilde{g}$-SUGRA scenario can help\nreconcile the persistent $(g-2)_\\mu$ anomaly, the Higgs constraints\nsignificantly restrict its parameter space, making a large contribution to\n$(g-2)_{\\mu}$ challenging. We also assess the discovery prospects in upcoming\ndark matter direct detection experiments, including PandaX-xT (200 t.y.), LZ\n(projected), and XENONnT (20 t.y.), which may not fully cover the viable\nparameter space.

    "abstract": "Compression is an efficient way to relieve the tremendous communication\noverhead of federated learning (FL) systems. However, for the existing works,\nthe information loss under compression will lead to unexpected model/gradient\ndeviation for the FL training, significantly degrading the training\nperformance, especially under the challenges of data heterogeneity and model\nobsolescence. To strike a delicate trade-off between model accuracy and traffic\ncost, we propose Caesar, a novel FL framework with a low-deviation compression\napproach. For the global model download, we design a greedy method to optimize\nthe compression ratio for each device based on the staleness of the local\nmodel, ensuring a precise initial model for local training. Regarding the local\ngradient upload, we utilize the device's local data properties (\\ie, sample\nvolume and label distribution) to quantify its local gradient's importance,\nwhich then guides the determination of the gradient compression ratio. Besides,\nwith the fine-grained batch size optimization, Caesar can significantly\ndiminish the devices' idle waiting time under the synchronized barrier. We have\nimplemented Caesar on two physical platforms with 40 smartphones and 80 NVIDIA\nJetson devices. Extensive results show that Caesar can reduce the traffic costs\nby about 25.54%$\\thicksim$37.88% compared to the compression-based baselines\nwith the same target accuracy, while incurring only a 0.68% degradation in\nfinal test accuracy relative to the full-precision communication.",

In DAFSP, jobs are first processed in\ndistributed flowshops, and then assembled into final products by an assembly\nmachine, which usually has limited buffers in practical application. This\nlimited capacity can lead to deadlocks, halting job completion and blocking the\nentire manufacturing process. However, existing scheduling methods fail to\naddress these deadlocks in DAFSP effectively. As such, we develop a hybrid\ncooperative co-evolution (HCCE) algorithm for solving the deadlock-prone DAFSP\nby minimizing the makespan. For the first time, we use Petri nets to analyze\nthe deadlocks in DAFSP and propose a Petri net-based deadlock amending method\n(IDAM), which is further integrated into HCCE to ensure the feasibility (i.e.,\ndeadlock-freeness) of solutions. Importantly, HCCE contains an elite archive\n(EAR) and two subpopulations. It uses the problem-specific operators for\nheuristic initialization and global-search. To enhance the quality and\ndiversity of solutions, an information transfer mechanism (ITM) is developed\namong subpopulation and EAR, and four local-search operators are performed\nsequentially on each individual in EAR.

In particular, we utilize the Freidlin--Wentzell\nlarge deviation theory to gauge the rare probability in the vicinity of\nunordered chain-transitive invariant set on a nonmonotone manifold. We further\napply our theoretic results to the stochastic stability of classical positive\nfeedback systems by showing that the zero-noise limit is a convex combination\nof the Dirac measures on a finite number of asymptotically stable equilibria\nalthough such system may possess nontrivial periodic orbits.",

    "abstract": "The rapid development of large language models (LLMs) and large vision models\n(LVMs) have propelled the evolution of multi-modal AI systems, which have\ndemonstrated the remarkable potential for industrial applications by emulating\nhuman-like cognition. However, they also pose significant ethical challenges,\nincluding amplifying harmful content and reinforcing societal biases. For\ninstance, biases in some industrial image generation models highlighted the\nurgent need for robust fairness assessments. Most existing evaluation\nframeworks focus on the comprehensiveness of various aspects of the models, but\nthey exhibit critical limitations, including insufficient attention to content\ngeneration alignment and social bias-sensitive domains. More importantly, their\nreliance on pixel-detection techniques is prone to inaccuracies.\n  To address these issues, this paper presents INFELM, an in-depth fairness\nevaluation on widely-used text-to-image models. Our key contributions are: (1)\nan advanced skintone classifier incorporating facial topology and refined skin\npixel representation to enhance classification precision by at least 16.04%,\n(2) a bias-sensitive content alignment measurement for understanding societal\nimpacts, (3) a generalizable representation bias evaluation for diverse\ndemographic groups, and (4) extensive experiments analyzing large-scale\ntext-to-image model outputs across six social-bias-sensitive domains. We find\nthat existing models in the study generally do not meet the empirical fairness\ncriteria, and representation bias is generally more pronounced than alignment\nerrors. INFELM establishes a robust benchmark for fairness assessment,\nsupporting the development of multi-modal AI systems that align with ethical\nand human-centric principles.",

Specifically, the gradient descent algorithm is employed for\nsolving the ME-STARS element position optimization subproblem, and the weighted\nminimum mean square error and the successive convex approximation methods are\ninvoked for solving the active and passive beamforming subproblems,\nrespectively. It is further demonstrated that the proposed AO algorithm for ES\ncan be extended to solve the problems for MS and TS. Numerical results unveil\nthat: 1) the ME-STARS can significantly improve the WSR compared to the STARS\nwith fixed position elements and the conventional reconfigurable intelligent\nsurface with movable elements, thanks to the extra spatial-domain diversity and\nthe higher flexibility in beamforming; and 2) the performance gain of ME-STARS\nis significant in the scenarios with larger number of users or more scatterers.",

However, solving the\ncoupled Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman and Fokker-Planck equations that characterize\nMFCG equilibria remains a significant computational challenge, particularly in\nhigh-dimensional or complex environments.\n  This paper presents a scalable deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) approach to\napproximate equilibrium solutions of MFCGs. Building on previous works, We\nreformulate the infinite-agent stochastic control problem as a Markov Decision\nProcess, where each representative agent interacts with the evolving mean field\ndistribution. We use the actor-critic based algorithm from a previous paper\n(Angiuli et.al., 2024) as the baseline and propose several versions of more\nscalable and efficient algorithms, utilizing techniques including parallel\nsample collection (batching); mini-batching; target network; proximal policy\noptimization (PPO); generalized advantage estimation (GAE); and entropy\nregularization. By leveraging these techniques, we effectively improved the\nefficiency, scalability, and training stability of the baseline algorithm.\n  We evaluate our method on a linear-quadratic benchmark problem, where an\nanalytical solution to the MFCG equilibrium is available. Our results show that\nsome versions of our proposed approach achieve faster convergence and closely\napproximate the theoretical optimum, outperforming the baseline algorithm by an\norder of magnitude in sample efficiency.

Similarly to ATM, the new\nmethod implements the alchemical transformation as a coordinate transformation,\nand works with any unmodified force fields and standard chemical topologies.\nUnlike ATM, which transfers the whole ligands in and out of the receptor\nbinding site, ATS limits the magnitude of the alchemical perturbation by\ntransferring only the portion of the molecules that differ between the the\nbound and unbound ligands. The common region of the two ligands, which can be\narbitrarily large, is unchanged and does not contribute to the magnitude and\nstatistical fluctuations of the perturbation energy.

    "abstract": "We focus on enhancing comprehension in small-group recorded conversations,\nwhich serve as a medium to bring people together and provide a space for\nsharing personal stories and experiences on crucial social matters. One way to\nparse and convey information from these conversations is by sharing highlighted\nexcerpts in subsequent conversations. This can help promote a collective\nunderstanding of relevant issues, by highlighting perspectives and experiences\nto other groups of people who might otherwise be unfamiliar with and thus\nunable to relate to these experiences. The primary challenge that arises then\nis that excerpts taken from one conversation and shared in another setting\nmight be missing crucial context or key elements that were previously\nintroduced in the original conversation. This problem is exacerbated when\nconversations become lengthier and richer in themes and shared experiences. To\naddress this, we explore how Large Language Models (LLMs) can enrich these\nexcerpts by providing socially relevant context. We present approaches for\neffective contextualization to improve comprehension, readability, and empathy.\nWe show significant improvements in understanding, as assessed through\nsubjective and objective evaluations. While LLMs can offer valuable context,\nthey struggle with capturing key social aspects. We release the Human-annotated\nSalient Excerpts (HSE) dataset to support future work. Additionally, we show\nhow context-enriched excerpts can provide more focused and comprehensive\nconversation summaries.",

To tackle this challenge, we propose a two-branch network\narchitecture which fuses the depth estimation results of single-view and\nmulti-view branch. In specific, we introduced mamba to serve as feature\nextraction backbone and propose an attention-based fusion methods which\nadaptively select the most robust estimation results between the two branches.\nThus, the proposed method can perform well on some challenging scenes including\ndynamic objects, texture-less regions, etc. Ablation studies prove the\neffectiveness of the backbone and fusion method, while evaluation experiments\non challenging benchmarks (KITTI and DDAD) show that the proposed method\nachieves a competitive performance compared to the state-of-the-art methods.",

    "abstract": "Digital twin (DT) technology enables real-time simulation, prediction, and\noptimization of physical systems, but practical deployment faces challenges\nfrom high data requirements, proprietary data constraints, and limited\nadaptability to evolving conditions. This work introduces DDD-GenDT, a dynamic\ndata-driven generative digital twin framework grounded in the Dynamic\nData-Driven Application Systems (DDDAS) paradigm. The architecture comprises\nthe Physical Twin Observation Graph (PTOG) to represent operational states, an\nObservation Window Extraction process to capture temporal sequences, a Data\nPreprocessing Pipeline for sensor structuring and filtering, and an LLM\nensemble for zero-shot predictive inference. By leveraging generative AI,\nDDD-GenDT reduces reliance on extensive historical datasets, enabling DT\nconstruction in data-scarce settings while maintaining industrial data privacy.\nThe DDDAS feedback mechanism allows the DT to autonomically adapt predictions\nto physical twin (PT) wear and degradation, supporting DT-aging, which ensures\nprogressive synchronization of DT with PT evolution. The framework is validated\nusing the NASA CNC milling dataset, with spindle current as the monitored\nvariable. In a zero-shot setting, the GPT-4-based DT achieves an average RMSE\nof 0.479 A (4.79% of the 10 A spindle current), accurately modeling nonlinear\nprocess dynamics and PT aging without retraining. These results show that\nDDD-GenDT provides a generalizable, data-efficient, and adaptive DT modeling\napproach, bridging generative AI with the performance and reliability\nrequirements of industrial DT applications.",

    "abstract": "One of the common challenges faced by researchers in recent data analysis is\nmissing values. In the context of penalized linear regression, which has been\nextensively explored over several decades, missing values introduce bias and\nyield a non-positive definite covariance matrix of the covariates, rendering\nthe least square loss function non-convex. In this paper, we propose a novel\nprocedure called the linear shrinkage positive definite (LPD) modification to\naddress this issue. The LPD modification aims to modify the covariance matrix\nof the covariates in order to ensure consistency and positive definiteness.\nEmploying the new covariance estimator, we are able to transform the penalized\nregression problem into a convex one, thereby facilitating the identification\nof sparse solutions. Notably, the LPD modification is computationally efficient\nand can be expressed analytically. In the presence of missing values, we\nestablish the selection consistency and prove the convergence rate of the\n$\\ell_1$-penalized regression estimator with LPD, showing an $\\ell_2$-error\nconvergence rate of square-root of $\\log p$ over $n$ by a factor of\n$(s_0)^{3/2}$ ($s_0$: the number of non-zero coefficients). To further evaluate\nthe effectiveness of our approach, we analyze real data from the Genomics of\nDrug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) dataset. This dataset provides incomplete\nmeasurements of drug sensitivities of cell lines and their protein expressions.\nWe conduct a series of penalized linear regression models with each sensitivity\nvalue serving as a response variable and protein expressions as explanatory\nvariables.",

    "abstract": "We study a system of ultra cold dipolar Bose gas atoms confined in a\ntwo-dimensional (2D) harmonic trap with a dipolar impurity implanted at the\ncenter of the trap. Due to recent experimental progress in dipolar condensates,\nwe focused on calculating properties of dipolar impurity systems that might\nguide experimentalists if they choose to study impurities in dipolar gases. We\nused the Gross-Pitaevskii formalism solved numerically via the split-step\nCrank-Nicolson method. We chose parameters of the background gas to be\nconsistent with dysprosium (Dy), one of the strongest magnetic dipoles and of\ncurrent experimental interest, and used chromium (Cr), erbium (Er), terbium\n(Tb), and Dy for the impurity. The dipole moments were aligned by an external\nfield along what was chosen to be the z-axis, and studied 2D confinements that\nwere perpendicular or parallel to the external field. We show density contour\nplots for the two confinements, 1D cross sections of the densities, calculated\nself-energies of the impurities while varying both number of atoms in the\ncondensate and the symmetry of the trap. We also calculated the time evolution\nof the density of an initially pure system where an impurity is introduced. Our\nresults found that while the self-energy increases in magnitude with increasing\nnumber of particles, it is reduced when the trap anisotropy follows the natural\nanisotropy of the gas, i.e., elongated along the z-axis in the case of parallel\nconfinement. This work builds upon work done in Bose gases with zero-range\ninteractions and demonstrates some of the features that could be found when\nexploring dipolar impurities in 2D Bose gases.",

Both interventions are grounded in the Situated Expectancy-Value\nTheory of Achievement Motivation, which posits that students are more likely to\ncomplete a task that they expect to do well in and whose outcomes they think\nare valuable.
