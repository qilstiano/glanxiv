    "abstract": "A new dataset of atomic oxygen and molecular nitrogen number density\nprofiles, along with thermospheric temperature profiles between 180 and 500 km,\nhas been developed. These profiles are derived from solar occultation\nmeasurements made by SUVI on the GOES-R satellites, using the 17.1, 19.5, and\n30.4 nm channels. Discussed is the novel approach and methods for using EUV\nsolar occultation images to measuring the thermospheric state. Measurement\nuncertainties are presented as a function of tangent altitude. At 250 km,\nnumber density random uncertainties are found to be 8% and 17% for O and N2,\nrespectively, and the random uncertainty for neutral temperature at 250 km was\nfound to be 3%. The impact of effective cross section uncertainty on retrieval\nbias was assessed, revealing that, as expected, the largest effects occur where\nO and N2 are minor absorbers. In contrast, total mass density and O/N2 ratios\nexhibit substantially lower sensitivity, with biases that remain small or\nnearly constant with altitude. Total mass density comparisons with the MSIS\nmodel show good agreement at the dusk terminator, with an average difference of\n-2%, but larger discrepancies at dawn, with an average difference of -26%.\nThese discrepancies are more prominent during quiet solar conditions,\nsuggesting an overestimation of densities by MSIS during these conditions.\nDensity comparisons with the IDEA and Dragster assimilative models show\ndawn/dusk percent differences of -24%/-2% and +2%/+13%, respectively. The\ndataset is available through the NOAA GOES-R L2 pipeline for eclipse seasons\nfrom Sept. 2018 onward and is expected to continue through 2035. As this\nmeasurement relies only on real-time NOAA space weather SUVI images, these\nprofiles could be produced in real-time, supporting critical space weather\nmonitoring and prediction, and filling in a current measurement gap of\nthermospheric temperature and density.",

    "abstract": "This work demonstrates how the concept of the entropic potential of events --\na parameter quantifying the influence of discrete events on the expected future\nentropy of a system -- can enhance uncertainty quantification, decision-making,\nand interpretability in artificial intelligence (AI). Building on its original\nformulation in physics, the framework is adapted for AI by introducing an\nevent-centric measure that captures how actions, observations, or other\ndiscrete occurrences impact uncertainty at future time horizons. Both the\noriginal and AI-adjusted definitions of entropic potential are formalized, with\nthe latter emphasizing conditional expectations to account for counterfactual\nscenarios. Applications are explored in policy evaluation, intrinsic reward\ndesign, explainable AI, and anomaly detection, highlighting the metric's\npotential to unify and strengthen uncertainty modeling in intelligent systems.\nConceptual examples illustrate its use in reinforcement learning, Bayesian\ninference, and anomaly detection, while practical considerations for\ncomputation in complex AI models are discussed. The entropic potential\nframework offers a theoretically grounded, interpretable, and versatile\napproach to managing uncertainty in AI, bridging principles from\nthermodynamics, information theory, and machine learning.",

    "abstract": "This work presents topological regularization (TR), a geometric framework for\ncontrolling ultraviolet divergences in gravitational loop corrections to the\nHiggs fermion sector. The method embeds flat spacetime into a compact four\ndimensional manifold, introducing a curvature induced high energy cutoff that\npreserves both Lorentz invariance and causality. The regulator is determined by\nthe manifold's Euler characteristic, ensuring power law suppression of short\ndistance modes without breaking spacetime symmetries. Applied to one and two\nloop processes, TR yields finite corrections to fermion self energies, Yukawa\ncouplings, and curvature dependent operators, with leading contributions set\nentirely by topological properties. Beyond its role as a regulator, TR\nnaturally encodes a duality between ultraviolet and infrared scales and admits\na thermal interpretation linked to the Unruh effect. While the framework is\nuniversal in principle, its current implementation relies on a spherical\nembedding and has been tested only in the soft graviton limit. The predicted\nsignals are highly suppressed, posing experimental challenges, yet TR offers a\nsymmetry preserving path toward probing Planck-scale physics within effective\nfield theory.",

    "abstract": "Background: Cirrhosis is a progressive liver disease with high mortality and\nfrequent complications, notably acute kidney injury (AKI), which occurs in up\nto 50% of hospitalized patients and worsens outcomes. AKI stems from complex\nhemodynamic, inflammatory, and metabolic changes, making early detection\nessential. Many predictive tools lack accuracy, interpretability, and alignment\nwith intensive care unit (ICU) workflows. This study developed an interpretable\nmachine learning model for early AKI prediction in critically ill patients with\ncirrhosis.\n  Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of the MIMIC-IV v2.2 database,\nidentifying 1240 adult ICU patients with cirrhosis and excluding those with ICU\nstays under 48 hours or missing key data. Laboratory and physiological\nvariables from the first 48 hours were extracted. The pipeline included\npreprocessing, missingness filtering, LASSO feature selection, and SMOTE class\nbalancing. Six algorithms-LightGBM, CatBoost, XGBoost, logistic regression,\nnaive Bayes, and neural networks-were trained and evaluated using AUROC,\naccuracy, F1-score, sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values.\n  Results: LightGBM achieved the best performance (AUROC 0.808, 95% CI\n0.741-0.856; accuracy 0.704; NPV 0.911). Key predictors included prolonged\npartial thromboplastin time, absence of outside-facility 20G placement, low pH,\nand altered pO2, consistent with known cirrhosis-AKI mechanisms and suggesting\nactionable targets.\n  Conclusion: The LightGBM-based model enables accurate early AKI risk\nstratification in ICU patients with cirrhosis using routine clinical variables.\nIts high negative predictive value supports safe de-escalation for low-risk\npatients, and interpretability fosters clinician trust and targeted prevention.\nExternal validation and integration into electronic health record systems are\nwarranted.",

The sensing regions can be\ncategorized into phase-drastic and phase-enhanced regions, both of which yield\nan optimal acoustic response that surpasses traditional transmission method.\nExperiment results demonstrate improvements of 57.87 dB in detection\nsensitivity and 26 times in minimal detectable acoustic pressure over the\ntransmission method. Moreover, the application of coherent state and heterodyne\ndetection can enhance response amplitude, further improving the detection\nsensitivity. Given the wide application range for acoustic dispersion and\ndissipation response, as well as the performance advantages of high sensitivity\nand wide dynamic range, the proposed WGM sensor offers a promising solution for\nacoustic sensing. Potentially, the structural design may be adaptable to other\napplication scenarios involving time-varying signals through optical\nmicrocavity sensing.",

    "abstract": "A local-valley (LV) centered approach to assessing the quality of sampling\nfrom Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) was applied to the latest generation\nof the D-Wave quantum annealer. D-Wave and Gibbs samples from a classically\ntrained RBM were obtained at conditions relevant to the\ncontrastive-divergence-based RBM learning. The samples were compared for the\nnumber of the LVs to which they belonged and the energy of the corresponding\nlocal minima. No significant (desirable) increase in the number of the LVs has\nbeen achieved by decreasing the D-Wave annealing time. At any training epoch,\nthe states sampled by the D-Wave belonged to a somewhat higher number of LVs\nthan in the Gibbs sampling. However, many of those LVs found by the two\ntechniques differed. For high-probability sampled states, the two techniques\nwere (unfavorably) less complementary and more overlapping. Nevertheless, many\npotentially \"important\" local minima, i.e., those having intermediate, even if\nnot high, probability values, were found by only one of the two sampling\ntechniques while missed by the other. The two techniques overlapped less at\nlater than earlier training epochs, which is precisely the stage of the\ntraining when modest improvements to the sampling quality could make meaningful\ndifferences for the RBM trainability. The results of this work may explain the\nfailure of previous investigations to achieve substantial (or any) improvement\nwhen using D-Wave-based sampling. However, the results reveal some potential\nfor improvement, e.g., using a combined classical-quantum approach.",

    "abstract": "At the ATLAS and CMS experiments at CERN's Large Hadron Collider, the rate of\nproton-proton collisions far exceeds the rate at which data can be recorded. A\nreal-time event selection process, or \"trigger\", is needed to ensure that the\ndata recorded contains the highest possible discovery potential. In the absence\nof hoped-for anomalies that would lead to the discovery of new physics, there\nis increasing motivation to develop dedicated, model-agnostic, anomaly\ndetection triggers. A common approach is to use unsupervised machine learning\n(ML) to predict an event-by-event anomaly score, based on the momenta and\nmultiplicity of reconstructed objects. Such anomaly scores often exhibit high\ncorrelation with existing trigger observables and thus exhibit a selection bias\ntowards high-momentum anomalies. In this article, we introduce DECorrelated\nAnomaly DEtection (DECADE), in which quantile regression is applied to the\noutput of a pre-trained anomaly detection algorithm, guaranteeing the\nindependence of the threshold on the anomaly score with respect to primary\ntrigger observables. Thus, DECADE provides efficiency in low-momentum regions\nof phase space not captured by existing triggers, boosting the trigger\nefficiency for low-mass phenomena that are inaccessible via primary triggers\nand current anomaly detection triggers. Quantile regression is implemented\nusing decision tree ensembles, making DECADE highly computationally efficient\nand therefore optimal for use both in software-based trigger systems and in\nFPGA-based hardware triggers. In both cases, we demonstrate that DECADE would\nadd an insignificant additional latency and resource cost to the hardware\nanomaly detection triggers currently in operation at ATLAS and CMS, as well as\nto those proposed for the High-Luminosity era of the Large Hadron Collider.",

In\nthis study, we develop a biophysically informed phase-field model to\ninvestigate the collective migration of the border cell cluster in the\nDrosophila melanogaster egg chamber. Our model captures key aspects of the egg\nchamber architecture, including the oocyte, nurse cells, and surrounding\nepithelium, and incorporates both mechanical forces and biochemical cues that\nguide cell migration. We introduce the Tangential Interface Migration (TIM)\nforce which captures contact-mediated propulsion generated along interfaces\nbetween the border cell cluster and surrounding nurse cells. Our simulations\nreveal three key features of TIM-driven migration that distinguish it from\nprevious forms of chemotaxis: (1) the necessity of border cell-nurse cell\noverlap to initiate movement (i.e., border cells cannot move without a nurse\ncell substrate), (2) motion is tangential to border cell-nurse cell interfaces,\nand (3) persistent migration even in regions where the spatial slope of\nchemoattractant is decreasing. Additionally, we demonstrate that with or\nwithout geometry-mediated alterations in chemoattractant distribution such as\nat intercellular junctions we can vary induced migration pauses, independent of\nmechanical confinement. We capture an experimentally observed transition to\ndorsal migration at the oocyte with a sustained medio-lateral chemical cue of\nsmall amplitude.

    "abstract": "The chemical industry is increasingly prioritising sustainability, with a\nfocus on reducing carbon footprints to achieve net zero. By 2026, the Together\nfor Sustainability (TfS) consortium will require reporting of biogenic carbon\ncontent (BCC) in chemical products, posing a challenge as BCC depends on\nfeedstocks, value chain configuration, and process-specific variables. While\ncarbon-14 isotope analysis can measure BCC, it is impractical for continuous\nindustrial monitoring. This work presents CarAT (Carbon Atom Tracker), an\nautomated methodology for calculating BCC across industrial value chains,\nenabling dynamic and accurate sustainability reporting. The approach leverages\nexisting Enterprise Resource Planning data in three stages: (1) preparing value\nchain data, (2) performing atom mapping in chemical reactions using chemistry\nlanguage models, and (3) applying a linear program to calculate BCC given known\ninlet compositions. The methodology is validated on a 27-node industrial\ntoluene diisocyanate value chain. Three scenarios are analysed: a base case\nwith fossil feedstocks, a case incorporating a renewable feedstock, and a\nbutanediol value chain with a recycle stream. Results are visualised with\nSankey diagrams showing the flow of carbon attributes across the value chain.\nThe key contribution is a scalable, automated method for real-time BCC\ncalculation under changing industrial conditions. CarAT supports compliance\nwith upcoming reporting mandates and advances carbon neutrality goals by\nenabling systematic fossil-to-biogenic substitution. Through transparent,\nauditable tracking of carbon sources in production networks, it empowers\ndata-driven decisions to accelerate the transition to sustainable\nmanufacturing.",

    "abstract": "Advances in surgical video analysis are transforming operating rooms into\nintelligent, data-driven environments. Computer-assisted systems support full\nsurgical workflow, from preoperative planning to intraoperative guidance and\npostoperative assessment. However, developing robust and generalizable models\nfor surgical video understanding remains challenging due to (I) annotation\nscarcity, (II) spatiotemporal complexity, and (III) domain gap across\nprocedures and institutions. This doctoral research aims to bridge the gap\nbetween deep learning-based surgical video analysis in research and its\nreal-world clinical deployment. To address the core challenge of recognizing\nsurgical phases, actions, and events, critical for analysis, I benchmarked\nstate-of-the-art neural network architectures to identify the most effective\ndesigns for each task. I further improved performance by proposing novel\narchitectures and integrating advanced modules. Given the high cost of expert\nannotations and the domain gap across surgical video sources, I focused on\nreducing reliance on labeled data. We developed semi-supervised frameworks that\nimprove model performance across tasks by leveraging large amounts of unlabeled\nsurgical video. We introduced novel semi-supervised frameworks, including DIST,\nSemiVT-Surge, and ENCORE, that achieved state-of-the-art results on challenging\nsurgical datasets by leveraging minimal labeled data and enhancing model\ntraining through dynamic pseudo-labeling. To support reproducibility and\nadvance the field, we released two multi-task datasets: GynSurg, the largest\ngynecologic laparoscopy dataset, and Cataract-1K, the largest cataract surgery\nvideo dataset.

    "abstract": "Underground mining operations rely on distributed sensor networks to collect\ncritical data daily, including mine temperature, toxic gas concentrations, and\nminer movements for hazard detection and operational decision-making. However,\ntransmitting raw sensor data to a central server for training deep learning\nmodels introduces significant privacy risks, potentially exposing sensitive\nmine-specific information. Federated Learning (FL) offers a transformative\nsolution by enabling collaborative model training while ensuring that raw data\nremains localized at each mine. Despite its advantages, FL in underground\nmining faces key challenges: (i) An attacker may compromise a mine's local\nmodel by employing techniques such as sign-flipping attacks or additive noise,\nleading to erroneous predictions; (ii) Low-quality (yet potentially valuable)\ndata, caused by poor lighting conditions or sensor inaccuracies in mines may\ndegrade the FL training process. In response, this paper proposes MineDetect, a\ndefense FL framework that detects and isolates the attacked models while\nmitigating the impact of mines with low-quality data. MineDetect introduces two\nkey innovations: (i) Detecting attacked models (maliciously manipulated) by\ndeveloping a history-aware mechanism that leverages local and global averages\nof gradient updates; (ii) Identifying and eliminating adversarial influences\nfrom unreliable models (generated by clients with poor data quality) on the FL\ntraining process. Comprehensive simulations across diverse datasets demonstrate\nthat MineDetect outperforms existing methods in both robustness and accuracy,\neven in challenging non-IID data scenarios.

    "abstract": "Phone call transcript labeling is prohibitively expensive (approximately 2\nUSD per minute) due to privacy regulations, consent requirements, and manual\nannotation costs requiring 3 hours of expert time per hour of audio. Existing\nextraction methods fail on conversational speech containing disfluencies,\ninterruptions, and speaker overlap. We introduce LingVarBench, a synthetic data\ngeneration pipeline that addresses these constraints through automated\nvalidation. First, we prompt an LLM to generate realistic structured field\nvalues across multiple use cases. Second, we recursively prompt the model to\ntransform these values into thousands of natural conversational utterances\ncontaining typical phone call characteristics. Third, we validate each\nsynthetic utterance by testing whether a separate LLM-based extractor can\nrecover the original structured information. We employ DSPy's SIMBA optimizer\nto automatically synthesize extraction prompts from validated synthetic\ntranscripts, eliminating manual prompt engineering. Our optimized prompts\nachieve up to 95 percent accuracy for numeric fields (vs. 88-89 percent\nzero-shot), 90 percent for names (vs. 47-79 percent), and over 80 percent for\ndates (vs. 72-77 percent) on real customer transcripts, demonstrating\nsubstantial gains over zero-shot prompting. The synthetic-to-real transfer\ndemonstrates that conversational patterns learned from generated data\ngeneralize effectively to authentic phone calls containing background noise and\ndomain-specific terminology. LingVarBench provides the first systematic\nbenchmark for structured extraction from synthetic conversational data,\ndemonstrating that automated prompt optimization overcomes cost and privacy\nbarriers preventing large-scale phone call analysis in commercial settings.",

As demonstrated across\nmany applications, mLLMs' ability to jointly process image and text data makes\nthem suitable for zero-shot applications or efficient fine-tuning towards\nspecialized tasks. However, they have had limited success in 3D analysis and\nediting tasks. This is due to both the lack of suitable (annotated) 3D data as\nwell as the idiosyncrasies of 3D representations. In this paper, we investigate\nwhether mLLMs can be adapted to support high-level editing of Boundary\nRepresentation (B-rep) CAD objects. B-reps remain the industry-standard for\nprecisely encoding engineering objects, but are challenging as the\nrepresentation is fragile (i.e. can easily lead to invalid CAD objects) and no\npublicly available data source exists with semantically-annotated B-reps or CAD\nconstruction history. We present B-repLer as a finetuned mLLM that can\nunderstand text prompts and make semantic edits on given B-Reps to produce\nvalid outputs. We enable this via a novel multimodal architecture, specifically\ndesigned to handle B-rep models, and demonstrate how existing CAD tools, in\nconjunction with mLLMs, can be used to automatically generate the required\nreasoning dataset, without relying on external annotations. We extensively\nevaluate B-repLer and demonstrate several text-based B-rep edits of various\ncomplexity, which were not previously possible.",

Our approach is fully passive and compatible with spatially\nmulti-mode light, making it suitable for free-space and satellite to ground\napplications.

We report the first measurement of the joint temporal\nintensity between frequency-bin entangled photons, which allows us to certify\nentanglement by violating the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality,\nwith a measured value of $|S|=2.32\\pm0.05$ over multi-mode fiber.

Although the typical disc-jet\nscenario was proposed to explain the observations, it remained far from\nconclusive. YSO-G29 was analysed using new observations at near-IR from\nGemini-NIFS, at radio continuum (10 GHz) from Jansky Very Large Array (JVLA),\nand new continuum (1.3 mm) and molecular line data from the Atacama Large\nMillimeter Array (ALMA). The near-IR observations allowed us to detect emission\nof H2 1-0 S(1) and Br-gamma lines in YSO-G29, which are compatible with\nexcitation and ionization from UV radiation propagating in a highly perturbed\nambient. In addition, some evidence of H2 excitation by collisions were found.\nThe ALMA data show the presence of a conspicuous and collimated molecular\noutflow propagating southwards, while to the north, an extended molecular\nfeature perfectly surrounded by the Ks near-IR emission appears. The continuum\nemission at 1.3 mm allowed us to better resolve the molecular cores, one of\nwhich stands out due to its high temperatures and rich chemical composition.\nFrom the JVLA observations, we discovered a compact radio continuum source, a\nlikely compact Hii region or an ionised jet of a massive protostar, located at\n~0.7 arcsec (~ 0.02 pc) from the main millimetre core. In this way, we propose\na YSO wide binary system. {We can explain the nature of the intriguing near-IR\nfeatures previously observed: cone-like structures produced by jets/winds of\none of the components of the binary system that cleared out the surroundings\nwere disrupted by a molecular outflow probably from the other component.

Courses that improve spatial skills exist but are not\nwidely used. Virtual reality (VR) has been suggested as a possible tool for\nteaching spatial reasoning since students are more accurate and complete\nspatial tasks more quickly in three dimensions. However, no prior work has\ndeveloped or evaluated a fully-structured VR spatial skills course. Objectives:\nWe seek to assess the effectiveness of teaching spatial reasoning in VR, both\nin isolation as a structured training curriculum and also in comparison to\ntraditional methods. Methods: We adapted three modules of an existing\npencil-and-paper course to VR, leveraging educational scaffolding and real-time\nfeedback in the design. We evaluated our three-week course in a study with\n$n=24$ undergraduate introductory STEM students, capturing both quantitative\nspatial ability gains (using pre- and post test scores on validated\nassessments) and qualitative insights (from a post-study questionnaire). We\nalso compared our VR course to an offering of a baseline non-VR course (using\ndata collected in a previous study). Results and Conclusions: Students who took\nour VR course had significant spatial ability gains. Critically, we find no\nsignificant difference in outcomes between our VR course (3 meetings of 120\nminutes each) and a baseline pencil and paper course (10 meetings of 90 minutes\neach), suggesting that spatial reasoning can be very efficiently taught in VR.\nWe observed cybersickness at lower rates than are generally reported and most\nstudents reported enjoying learning in VR.",

    "abstract": "The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) is challenged by\nhallucinations, critical failure modes where models generate non-factual,\nnonsensical or unfaithful text. This paper introduces Semantic Divergence\nMetrics (SDM), a novel lightweight framework for detecting Faithfulness\nHallucinations -- events of severe deviations of LLMs responses from input\ncontexts. We focus on a specific implementation of these LLM errors,\n{confabulations, defined as responses that are arbitrary and semantically\nmisaligned with the user's query. Existing methods like Semantic Entropy test\nfor arbitrariness by measuring the diversity of answers to a single, fixed\nprompt. Our SDM framework improves upon this by being more prompt-aware: we\ntest for a deeper form of arbitrariness by measuring response consistency not\nonly across multiple answers but also across multiple, semantically-equivalent\nparaphrases of the original prompt. Methodologically, our approach uses joint\nclustering on sentence embeddings to create a shared topic space for prompts\nand answers. A heatmap of topic co-occurances between prompts and responses can\nbe viewed as a quantified two-dimensional visualization of the user-machine\ndialogue. We then compute a suite of information-theoretic metrics to measure\nthe semantic divergence between prompts and responses. Our practical score,\n$\\mathcal{S}_H$, combines the Jensen-Shannon divergence and Wasserstein\ndistance to quantify this divergence, with a high score indicating a\nFaithfulness hallucination. Furthermore, we identify the KL divergence\nKL(Answer $||$ Prompt) as a powerful indicator of \\textbf{Semantic\nExploration}, a key signal for distinguishing different generative behaviors.\nThese metrics are further combined into the Semantic Box, a diagnostic\nframework for classifying LLM response types, including the dangerous,\nconfident confabulation.",

Although\nsolving the game exactly is intractable in theory, our use of the double-oracle\nframework enables us to achieve computation times on the order of seconds,\nmaking the approach operationally viable. In particular, the framework is\nmodular enough to accommodate specialized routing algorithms as oracles. We\nevaluate our method on real-world scenarios, showing that it scales effectively\nto realistic problem sizes and significantly benefits from explicitly modeling\nthe adversary's capabilities, as demonstrated through ablation studies and\ncomparisons with baseline approaches.",

    "abstract": "Myocardial infarction significantly degrades heart function, and current\ntreatments can bring forth serious cost and complications including blood clots\nand infections. To improve the current state of treatment, researchers are\ndeveloping tissue patches from induced-pluripotent stem cells that can be\nincorporated into the heart, improving organ function after a myocardial\ninfarction. These tissue patches include surface patches, attached to the\nepicardium of the heart, and thick transmural patches that replace the\ninfarcted region. However, little is known about the impact of cardiac tissue\npatches on pump function in a patient's heart. In addition, it is not clear\nwhat patch structural properties - such as active stress generation, muscle\nfiber alignment, or material stiffness - may best augment existing heart\ntissue. Computational modeling can be used to examine different implementations\nand patch properties, illuminating the mechanical impact of cardiac tissue\npatches in the beating heart. In this work, we computationally implement\ndifferent cardiac tissue patches to understand benefits of particular patch\ntypes and properties. We find that in transmural cardiac tissue patches, both\nactivation and fiber alignment improve function. A transmural patch generating\n10% of healthy active stress can increase stroke volume by 18%, and higher\ngenerated active stress in a circumferential muscle fiber orientation can\nrecover stroke volume by over 50%. Furthermore, we find that surface cardiac\ntissue patches can enhance heart function slightly despite limiting diastolic\nfilling, especially when fibrotic thinning has occurred. These conclusions\nidentify broad design goals for the engineering of cardiac tissue patches to\nimprove heart function after a myocardial infarction.",

The accuracy of quantitative mapping\nwas assessed by comparing MIMOSA with 3D-QALAS and reference techniques in both\nISMRM/NIST phantom and in-vivo experiments.

Results: Simulations demonstrated that MIMOSA achieved improved parameter\nestimation accuracy compared to 3D-QALAS. Phantom experiments indicated that\nMIMOSA exhibited better agreement with the reference techniques than 3D-QALAS.\nIn-vivo experiments demonstrated that an acceleration factor of up to R =\n11.8-fold can be achieved while preserving parameter estimation accuracy, with\nintra-class correlation coefficients of 0.998 (T1), 0.973 (T2), 0.947 (T2*),\n0.992 (QSM), 0.987 (paramagnetic susceptibility), and 0.977 (diamagnetic\nsusceptibility) in scan-rescan studies.

Conventional design storm methodologies, which rely on\nhistorical trends of rainfall data under a stationarity assumption, may not\nadequately account for future climate variability. This study introduces a\nrisk-based framework for determining climate-informed design storms tailored to\nroad drainage systems. The proposed framework integrates climate model\nprojections with risk assessment to quantify the potential impacts of future\nextreme rainfall on drainage performance and adjust the future design storm,\nwith a focus on the province of Ontario, Canada. Projected precipitation\nchanges for mid- and late-century time horizons are quantified using\nstatistically downscaled CMIP6 General Circulation Models. The risk level is\ndefined as a function of hazard and vulnerability, where hazard combines both\nphysiographic and meteorological factors. Vulnerability is comprised of\nsocioeconomic, transportation, and environmental considerations. To\nsystematically integrate these components, a weighting scheme is developed\nbased on a sensitivity analysis of the criteria, which provides flexibility in\nassigning relative importance to each factor. The estimated risk level is then\napplied to adjust the projected design storm accordingly. The proposed workflow\nis demonstrated through both province-wide and site-specific applications\nacross Ontario's road network to better highlight its scalability and\nadaptability.

We\nderive sufficient conditions for strong equilibrium strategies by expanding the\nobjective function corresponding to the spike deviation with respect to the\nvariational factor up to higher orders, and simplify the result by exploiting\nthe partial differential equations that a Nash equilibrium control satisfies.\nNext, we examine whether the derived Nash equilibrium control is a strong\nequilibrium strategy.

The full FDM dynamics are\nimplemented in reionization simulations, along with a new ansatz on modulation\nof the FDM HMF by the linear overdensity. Not only does the suppression of FDM\nhalos on small scales give rise to delay of the signature epochs during cosmic\nreionization, but these epochs are also shortened relative to the cold dark\nmatter cosmology. In addition, we find that while the FDM effects on the 21-cm\npower spectrum are dominated by its linear dynamics early in Cosmic Dawn, a\ncorrect FDM HMF resulting from nonlinear wave dynamics must be considered when\nX-ray heating begins.

These high-quality outputs make\nit difficult to distinguish between state-of-the-art models and to identify\nareas for future improvement. In this context, automatically identifying texts\nwhere machine translation systems struggle holds promise for developing more\ndiscriminative evaluations and guiding future research.\n  In this work, we address this gap by formalizing the task of translation\ndifficulty estimation, defining a text's difficulty based on the expected\nquality of its translations. We introduce a new metric to evaluate difficulty\nestimators and use it to assess both baselines and novel approaches. Finally,\nwe demonstrate the practical utility of difficulty estimators by using them to\nconstruct more challenging benchmarks for machine translation. Our results show\nthat dedicated models outperform both heuristic-based methods and\nLLM-as-a-judge approaches, with Sentinel-src achieving the best performance.\nThus, we release two improved models for difficulty estimation, Sentinel-src-24\nand Sentinel-src-25, which can be used to scan large collections of texts and\nselect those most likely to challenge contemporary machine translation systems.",

We extend classical entrainment theory\nby incorporating thermal and compositional diffusion and by deriving a modified\nentrainment law that predicts interface speeds in the weak-diffusion limit. We\nshow that convection stalls when the interface speed becomes comparable to the\ncompositional diffusion speed and validate the transition between behaviors\nacross a wide parameter space of Richardson and Lewis numbers. Such\ndiffusively-controlled stalling is unlikely to occur in stellar and planetary\ninteriors, where the Lewis number is typically large and compositional\ndiffusion is extremely slow. In these environments, compositional diffusion\nwill merely slow the growth of the convection zone and convective boundaries\nare expected to stall only in the presence of other curtailing mechanisms such\nas strong radiative diffusion or rapid rotation.",

Changes to the detectors' gain characteristics over\ntime will result in a non-linear stretching of the entire energy range.\nMoreover, observations from past MeV telescopes and proton-beam experiments\nhave shown that radiation damage in space causes photopeak shifts and spectral\nline broadening.

In\nthis study, we demonstrate a method to monitor and recalibrate the COSI\ndetectors using background line emissions produced by the space radiation\nenvironment.

Methods developed by\nPike et al. to correct the effects of hole trapping and gain characteristics\ncan then be applied to recover the original spectral performance.

However, their\nperformance degrades significantly in niche, safety-critical domains such as\nindustrial spill detection, where hazardous events are rare, sensitive, and\ndifficult to annotate. This scarcity -- driven by privacy concerns, data\nsensitivity, and the infrequency of real incidents -- renders conventional\nfine-tuning of detectors infeasible for most industrial settings.\n  We address this challenge by introducing a scalable framework centered on a\nhigh-quality synthetic data generation pipeline. We demonstrate that this\nsynthetic corpus enables effective Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) of\nVLMs and substantially boosts the performance of state-of-the-art object\ndetectors such as YOLO and DETR.

When SynSpill is used, both VLMs and detectors achieve marked\nimprovements, with their performance becoming comparable.\n  Our results underscore that high-fidelity synthetic data is a powerful means\nto bridge the domain gap in safety-critical applications.

In addition, the multi-operator\nshared micromobility system in a city complicates the problem because of their\nnon-cooperative self-interested pursuits. Existing regulatory frameworks of\nmulti-operator vehicle rebalancing generally assume the intrusive control of\nvehicle rebalancing of all the operators, which is not practical in the real\nworld. To address this limitation, we design REALISM, a regulatory framework\nfor coordinated scheduling in multi-operator shared micromobility services that\nincorporates the city regulator's regulations in the form of assigning a score\nto each operator according to the city goal achievements and operators'\nindividual contributions to achieving the city goal, measured by Shapley value.\nTo realize the fairness-aware score assignment, we measure the fairness of\nassigned scores and use them as one of the components to optimize the score\nassignment model. To optimize the whole framework, we develop an alternating\nprocedure to make operators and the city regulator interact with each other\nuntil convergence. We evaluate our framework based on real-world e-scooter\nusage data in Chicago.

While\neffective in general domains, LaaJs pose significant challenges in\ndomain-specific contexts, where annotated data is scarce and expert evaluation\nis costly. In such cases, meta-evaluation is often performed using metrics that\nhave not been validated for the specific domain in which they are applied. As a\nresult, it becomes difficult to determine which metrics effectively identify\nLaaJ quality, and further, what threshold indicates sufficient evaluator\nperformance. In this work, we introduce LaaJMeter, a simulation-based framework\nfor controlled meta-evaluation of LaaJs. LaaJMeter enables engineers to\ngenerate synthetic data representing virtual models and judges, allowing\nsystematic analysis of evaluation metrics under realistic conditions. This\nhelps practitioners validate and refine LaaJs for specific evaluation tasks:\nthey can test whether their metrics correctly distinguish between better and\nworse (virtual) LaaJs, and estimate appropriate thresholds for evaluator\nadequacy.\n  We demonstrate the utility of LaaJMeter in a code translation task involving\na legacy programming language, showing how different metrics vary in\nsensitivity to evaluator quality.

    "abstract": "The quick growth of shops using artificial intelligence (AI) techniques has\nchanged digital marketing activities and changed how businesses interact and\nreach their consumers. (AI) techniques are reshaping digital interactions\nbetween shops and consumers interact digitally by providing a more efficient\nand customized experience, fostering deeper engagement and more informed\ndecision-making. This study investigates how (AI) techniques affect consumer\ninteraction and decision-making over purchases with shops that use digital\nmarketing. The partial least squares method was used to evaluate data from a\nsurvey with 300 respondents. When consumer engagement mediates this\nrelationship, artificial intelligence (AI) techniques have a more favorable\nimpact on purchasing decision-making. Consequently, decision-making is\npositively impacted through consumer engagement. The findings emphasize that\nfor a bigger impact of the (AI) techniques on decision-making, the consumer\nmust initially interact with the (AI) techniques. This research unveils a\ncontemporary pathway in the field of AI-supported shop engagements and\nillustrates the distinct impact of (AI) techniques on consumer satisfaction,\ntrust, and loyalty, revolutionizing traditional models of customer-purchase\ndecision-making and shop engagement processes. This study provides previously\nunheard-of insight, into the revolutionary potential of (AI) techniques in\ninfluencing customer behavior and shop relationships",

We conducted a\nmixed-method study of 325 PTLM families (904 HF variants) to examine how commit\nactivities are coordinated.

The prevalence of partially synchronized\npatterns, such as Disperse synchronization and Sparse synchronization, reveals\nstructural disconnects in current cross-platform release practices.

All treatments were trained\nusing a custom EfficientNetV2-L architecture with enhanced fine-tuning and\ntransfer learning techniques. Models trained on H2, H3, and H4 treatments\ndemonstrated high precision, recall, and F1-score metrics. Additionally, the\nweighted F1-score increased from 0.65 (on H0) to 1.00 (on H3-H4) signifying\nthat the addition of a small number of real images with a considerable volume\nof synthetic images improved model performance and generalizability.

In this paper, we\ndevelop a theoretical understanding of the Expectation-Maximization (EM)\nalgorithm's behavior in the context of targeted model misspecification for\noverspecified two-component Mixed Linear Regression (2MLR) with unknown\n$d$-dimensional regression parameters and mixing weights. In Theorem 5.1 at the\npopulation level, with an unbalanced initial guess for mixing weights, we\nestablish linear convergence of regression parameters in $O(\\log(1/\\epsilon))$\nsteps. Conversely, with a balanced initial guess for mixing weights, we observe\nsublinear convergence in $O(\\epsilon^{-2})$ steps to achieve the\n$\\epsilon$-accuracy at Euclidean distance. In Theorem 6.1 at the finite-sample\nlevel, for mixtures with sufficiently unbalanced fixed mixing weights, we\ndemonstrate a statistical accuracy of $O((d/n)^{1/2})$, whereas for those with\nsufficiently balanced fixed mixing weights, the accuracy is $O((d/n)^{1/4})$\ngiven $n$ data samples. Furthermore, we underscore the connection between our\npopulation level and finite-sample level results: by setting the desired final\naccuracy $\\epsilon$ in Theorem 5.1 to match that in Theorem 6.1 at the\nfinite-sample level, namely letting $\\epsilon = O((d/n)^{1/2})$ for\nsufficiently unbalanced fixed mixing weights and $\\epsilon = O((d/n)^{1/4})$\nfor sufficiently balanced fixed mixing weights, we intuitively derive iteration\ncomplexity bounds $O(\\log (1/\\epsilon))=O(\\log (n/d))$ and\n$O(\\epsilon^{-2})=O((n/d)^{1/2})$ at the finite-sample level for sufficiently\nunbalanced and balanced initial mixing weights.

    "abstract": "The $3x+1$ Conjecture asserts that the $T$-orbit of every positive integer\n$x$ contains $1$, where $T$ maps $x$ to $x/2$ for $x$ even and to $(3x+1)/2$\nfor $x$ odd. Several authors have studied the analogous map, $T_q$, which maps\n$x\\in F_2[q]$ to $x/q$ if $q$ divides $x$ and $((1+q)x+1)/q$ otherwise. In\nparticular, they showed that the $T_q$-orbit of every polynomial contains $1$.\nThis seems analogous to the $3x+1$ conjecture, but does not prove the\nconjecture itself, as the dynamical systems involved are not conjugate via any\ncorrespondence between polynomials and positive integers.\n  In this paper, we show that $T_q$ actually is conjugate to $T$ if we extend\ntheir domains to the ring of formal power series $F_2[[q]]$ and the 2-adic\nintegers $\\mathbb{Z}_2$, respectively. Thus, it is not polynomials that\ncorrespond to positive integers via conjugacy, but rather certain formal power\nseries.\n  We then generalize this result to the family of functions $T_{A,B}\\colon\nF_2[[q]]\\to F_2[[q]]$ mapping $x$ to $x/q$ if $q$ divides $x$ and $(Ax+B)/q$\notherwise, where $A,B\\in F_2[[q]]$ are not divisible by $q$. Unlike $T_q$, some\nof these maps do have the property that polynomials correspond to the positive\nintegers whose $T$-orbit contains $1$ via a conjugacy with $T$. We show that\n$T_{1,1+q^2}$ is one such map, and has the additional nice property that the\norbit of every polynomial enters either the unique $2$-cycle or one of the two\nfixed points.\n  Finally, the power series that correspond to the natural numbers via these\nconjugacies can be represented as rational numbers with odd denominators by\nreplacing $q$ with $2$ and interpreting the resulting formal series as a 2-adic\ninteger. Finding a simple closed form for even one such correspondence could\nsettle the conjecture itself, and we provide some data along these lines for\nboth $T_{1,1+q^2}$ and $T_q$.",

To address this gap, we propose CoBAD, a novel model designed to\ncapture Collective Behaviors for human mobility Anomaly Detection. We first\nformulate the problem as unsupervised learning over Collective Event Sequences\n(CES) with a co-occurrence event graph, where CES represents the event\nsequences of related individuals. CoBAD then employs a two-stage attention\nmechanism to model both the individual mobility patterns and the interactions\nacross multiple individuals. Pre-trained on large-scale collective behavior\ndata through masked event and link reconstruction tasks, CoBAD is able to\ndetect two types of collective anomalies: unexpected co-occurrence anomalies\nand absence anomalies, the latter of which has been largely overlooked in prior\nwork. Extensive experiments on large-scale mobility datasets demonstrate that\nCoBAD significantly outperforms existing anomaly detection baselines, achieving\nan improvement of 13%-18% in AUCROC and 19%-70% in AUCPR.

Self- and semi-supervised learning\nmethods show promising results in pre-training large models, which -- when\nfinetuned for classification -- often outperform their counterparts trained\nfrom scratch. Still, the choice of pretext training tasks is often heuristic\nand their transferability to downstream classification is not granted, thus we\npropose a novel semi-supervised pre-training strategy to enforce latent\nrepresentations that satisfy the Neural Collapse phenomenon observed in\noptimally trained neural classifiers. We use a rotational equiangular tight\nframe-classifier and pseudo-labeling to pre-train deep encoders with few\nlabeled samples. Furthermore, to effectively capture temporal dynamics while\nenforcing embedding separability, we integrate generative pretext tasks with\nour method, and we define a novel sequential augmentation strategy.

    "abstract": "The origin of the three fermion generations and their highly hierarchical\nmass spectra remains one of the most profound puzzles in particle physics. We\nshow that the complexified exceptional Jordan algebra\n\\(J_{3}(\\mathbb{O}_{\\mathbb{C}})\\), the natural mathematical framework for the\nexceptional Lie group \\(E_{6}\\), provides a unified explanation for both. In\nthis approach, the three generations arise from the three canonical eigenvalues\nof Jordan elements, while their mass hierarchies are determined by a minimal,\nuniversal ladder in the \\(\\mathrm{Sym}^{3}(\\mathbf{3})\\) representation of a\nflavor \\(SU(3)\\) subgroup.\n  The construction yields several parameter-free predictions. The universal\nJordan eigenvalue spectrum \\((q-\\delta, q, q+\\delta)\\) is fixed by the algebra\nto have a spread \\(\\delta^{2}=3/8\\). The requirement of a minimal, consistent\nladder uniquely selects fixed Clebsch-Gordan factors \\((2,1,1)\\) for state\nmixing. Together, these inputs derive closed-form expressions for the\nsquare-root mass ratios of all charged fermions (quarks and leptons) from a\nsingle underlying structure. A Dynkin \\(\\mathbb{Z}_{2}\\) automorphism of\n\\(E_{6}\\) (a ``swap'') naturally relates the down-quark and charged-lepton\nsectors, predicting \\(\\sqrt{m_{\\tau}/m_{\\mu}} = \\sqrt{m_{s}/m_{d}}\\). The\nfirst-generation mass scale is set by a trace split\n\\(\\operatorname{Tr}X_{\\ell}:\\operatorname{Tr}X_{u}:\\operatorname{Tr}X_{d}=1:2:3\\),\nleading to the relation \\(\\sqrt{m_{e}}:\\sqrt{m_{u}}:\\sqrt{m_{d}}=1:2:3\\).",

    "abstract": "Background: Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) is a biomarker for\nintracerebral hemorrhage and traumatic brain injury, but its link to acute\nspeech disruption is untested. Speech anomalies often emerge early after\ninjury, enabling rapid triage.\n  Methods: We simulated a cohort of 200 virtual patients stratified by lesion\nlocation, onset time, and severity. GFAP kinetics followed published\ntrajectories; speech anomalies were generated from lesion-specific\nneurophysiological mappings. Ensemble machine-learning models used GFAP,\nspeech, and lesion features; robustness was tested under noise, delays, and\nlabel dropout. Causal inference (inverse probability of treatment weighting and\ntargeted maximum likelihood estimation) estimated directional associations\nbetween GFAP elevation and speech severity.\n  Findings: GFAP correlated with simulated speech anomaly severity (Spearman\nrho = 0.48), strongest for cortical lesions (rho = 0.55). Voice anomalies\npreceded detectable GFAP rise by a median of 42 minutes in cortical injury.\nClassifier area under the curve values were 0.74 (GFAP only), 0.78 (voice\nonly), and 0.86 for the fused multimodal model, which showed higher sensitivity\nin mild or ambiguous cases. Causal estimates indicated higher GFAP increased\nthe modeled probability of moderate-to-severe speech anomalies by 32 to 35\npercent, independent of lesion site and onset time.\n  Conclusion: These results support a link between GFAP elevation and speech\nanomalies in acute brain injury and suggest integrated biochemical-voice\ndiagnostics could improve early triage, especially for cortical injury.\nFindings are simulation-based and require validation in prospective clinical\nstudies with synchronized GFAP assays and speech recordings.",

The\nprojected magnetic fields appear fairly organized with a pinched morphology in\nthe northern part and a concave shape in the southern part. We fit the\npolarization maps with a two-component magnetic field model: an hourglass model\ncentered at the continuum peak, SMM2, and an empirical sphere centered at the\nO-type star, IRS7. Using the Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi method, we calculate a\nprojected field strength of $B_\\mathrm{pos} = 1.4 \\; \\mathrm{mG}$. Along with\nthe Zeeman measurement, a total magnetic field strength of $B_\\mathrm{tot} =\n1.6 \\; \\mathrm{mG}$ is obtained. We find that the gravitational energy is the\nmost dominant, followed by magnetic energy, and then turbulent energy. Small\nvalues of the virial parameter, $\\alpha_\\mathrm{vir} = 0.8$, and the ratio of\ntimescales, $t_\\mathrm{ff}/t_\\mathrm{corss} = 0.6$, suggest an ongoing\ncollapse.

The morphology of magnetic\nfields and the surrounding \\HII regions put forward a scenario for W3 IRS5. A\ngravitationally unstable dense core formed within a neutral gas ridge plowed by\nthe expansions of W3 A and W3 B. The core began to contract, causing gravity to\npull the magnetic field lines inward, which resulted in a pinched field\nmorphology. Subsequent expansion of W3 F, ionized by IRS7, perturbed the\nmagnetic field, creating concave patterns. The dynamical interactions among\nprotostars led to misalignment of their outflows.",

To address this, we draw inspiration from off-policy\nRL, and speculative decoding to introduce a novel ReFT framework, dubbed\nNested-ReFT, where a subset of layers of the target model acts as the behavior\nmodel to generate off-policy completions during training. The behavior model\nconfigured with dynamic layer skipping per batch during training decreases the\ninference cost compared to the standard ReFT frameworks. Our theoretical\nanalysis shows that Nested-ReFT yields unbiased gradient estimates with\ncontrolled variance. Our empirical analysis demonstrates improved computational\nefficiency measured as tokens/sec across multiple math reasoning benchmarks and\nmodel sizes.

In this work, we harness a\nshortcut to adiabaticity -- counterdiabatic driving -- to avoid the effects of\nloss while maintaining trajectories that follow the instantaneous eigenstates\nin significantly shorter timescales. We experimentally investigate the\nrobustness of this control method using a superconducting transmon circuit with\nengineered dissipation. We observe that counterdiabatic driving stabilizes\nquasistatic transport and preserves the complex energy spectrum's topology.",

Instead, we find that for increasingly\nNeptune-proximate orbits, resonances of progressively higher index are dominant\nin explaining the emergence of chaotic behavior.

Many practical applications of LLMs, such as code completion and\nstructured data extraction, require adherence to syntactic constraints\nspecified by a formal language. Yet, due to their probabilistic nature, LLM\noutput is not guaranteed to adhere to such formal languages. Prior work has\nproposed constrained decoding as a means to restrict LLM generation to\nparticular formal languages. However, existing works are not applicable to the\nemerging paradigm of diffusion LLMs, when used in practical scenarios such as\nthe generation of formally correct C++ or JSON output. In this paper we address\nthis challenge and present the first constrained decoding method for diffusion\nmodels, one that can handle formal languages captured by context-free grammars.\nWe begin by reducing constrained decoding to the more general additive\ninfilling problem, which asks whether a partial output can be completed to a\nvalid word in the target language. This problem also naturally subsumes the\npreviously unaddressed multi-region infilling constrained decoding. We then\nreduce this problem to the task of deciding whether the intersection of the\ntarget language and a regular language is empty and present an efficient\nalgorithm to solve it for context-free languages. Empirical results on various\napplications, such as C++ code infilling and structured data extraction in\nJSON, demonstrate that our method achieves near-perfect syntactic correctness\nwhile consistently preserving or improving functional correctness.

    "abstract": "Of the 97 known satellites in the Jovian system, the individual masses and\ndensities of each moon have only been determined for six of them: the four\nGalileans, Amalthea, and Himalia. In this letter, we derive a prediction for\nthe mean density (and mass) of Thebe, Jupiter's sixth largest regular moon,\nobtaining a lower limit of $\\rho_\\text{T}\\gtrsim1.0$ g/cm$^3$\n($m_\\text{T}\\gtrsim 5\\times 10^{20}$ g). In particular, this value emerges as a\nkey constraint within the context of the resonant transport model for the\norigins of Jupiter's interior satellites. Expanding on this theory, here we\ncarry out simulations of the simultaneous gravitational shepherding of Amalthea\nand Thebe via the resonant influence of inward-migrating Io during Jupiter's\ndisk-bearing epoch. We find that owing to overstability of resonant dynamics\nfacilitated by the circumjovian disk's aerodynamic drag, Thebe's smaller radius\n(compared to that of Amalthea's) requires a higher density to ensure its\nterminal orbital distance exceeds that of Amalthea's, as it does today. With\nmultiple current and upcoming space missions devoted to in situ exploration of\nthe Jovian system, a proper measurement of Thebe's mass provides an avenue\ntowards empirical falsification or confirmation of our theoretical model for\nthe dynamical evolution of Jupiter's inner moons.",

This challenge provides teams with a\nunique platform to evaluate automated red-teaming and safety alignment methods\nthrough head-to-head adversarial tournaments where red teams have multi-turn\nconversations with the competing AI coding assistants to test their safety\nalignment. Along with this, the challenge provides teams with a feed of high\nquality annotated data to fuel iterative improvement. Throughout the challenge,\nteams developed state-of-the-art techniques, introducing novel approaches in\nreasoning-based safety alignment, robust model guardrails, multi-turn\njail-breaking, and efficient probing of large language models (LLMs). To\nsupport these efforts, the Amazon Nova AI Challenge team made substantial\nscientific and engineering investments, including building a custom baseline\ncoding specialist model for the challenge from scratch, developing a tournament\norchestration service, and creating an evaluation harness.

While braiding operations are robust against local perturbations,\na critical yet often overlooked challenge arises when scaling beyond two\nqubits: the naive extension of braiding based gates fails to support even the\nfull Clifford group. To overcome this limitation, we incorporate projective\nmeasurements that enable transitions between different qubit encodings, thus\nrestoring computational universality. We perform many-body simulations of\nbraiding dynamics augmented with measurement-based switching, explicitly\npreparing the Bell state and GHZ state for systems of two and five qubits,\nrespectively. Furthermore, we execute a random unitary circuit on five qubits,\nachieving a fidelity exceeding 99%. We analyze the circuit's robustness by\nstudying its fidelity dependence on total braid duration and static potential\ndisorder. Our results show that the fidelity remains above 99% for moderate\ndisorder, underscoring the intrinsic fault tolerance of the architecture.\nFinally, we demonstrate a random circuit on a ten qubit system to showcase the\nscalability of our techniques.",

In\ncontrast to continuous fractal models such as the West-Brown-Enquist (WBE)\ntheory, the present approach describes metabolic scaling as the cumulative\nresult of successive discrete stages, each incrementally contributing to\nmetabolic activity. The scaling exponent b(n) emerges naturally from the\nlogarithmic relationship between consecutive Fibonacci numbers, varying\nsystematically with the organism's developmental stage. A refined logarithmic\nformulation significantly enhances quantitative agreement with empirical\nmetabolic data across various mammalian species. This discrete framework\neffectively captures deviations from classical scaling laws, directly\nconnecting recursive hierarchical structures with metabolic processes. Our\nmodel provides an alternative to traditional fractal transport approaches and\ncan be naturally extended to hierarchical physical systems, opening new avenues\nto explore stage-dependent scaling phenomena in complex adaptive systems.",

    "abstract": "Extended Ly$\\alpha$ emission is commonly observed around star-forming\ngalaxies, opening a window for probing the neutral hydrogen gas in the\ncircumgalactic medium (CGM). In this paper, we develop a prescription of\nspherically symmetric CGM gas properties and build emulators to model\ncircularly-averaged surface brightness (SB) profiles of the extended Ly$\\alpha$\nemission. With CGM gas properties parametrized by the density, velocity, and\ntemperature profiles, a self-shielding calculation is carried out to obtain the\nneutral gas distribution with ionizing photons from the ultraviolet (UV)\nbackground and star formation in the galaxy. Our calculation reveals three\ntypes of systems with distinct neutral gas distribution: non-shielded systems\nwith the CGM being highly ionized across all radii, shielded systems with a\nneutral gas shell shielding the UV background, and transitional systems in\nbetween. Ly$\\alpha$ SB profiles are obtained through Ly$\\alpha$ radiative\ntransfer (RT) simulations, performed for the CGM models with three kinds of\nLy$\\alpha$ sources: the star formation from central and satellite galaxies, and\nthe recombination in the CGM. We build emulators to efficiently predict\nLy$\\alpha$ SB profiles for given model parameters and Ly$\\alpha$ sources, based\non Gaussian process regression. After being trained with only 180 RT\nsimulations for each Ly$\\alpha$ source, the emulators reach an overall accuracy\nat the level of $\\sim 20$ per cent. By applying the emulators to fit mock\nLy$\\alpha$ SB profiles constructed from our model, we find a reasonable\nrecovery of model parameters, indicating the potential of extracting physical\ninformation of the CGM and galaxies from the observed extended Ly$\\alpha$\nemission.",

Tensor network\napproaches, in particular matrix product states (MPS) combined with the\ntime-evolving block decimation (TEBD) algorithm, currently dominate large-scale\ncircuit simulations. These methods scale efficiently when entanglement is\nlimited but suffer rapid bond dimension growth with increasing entanglement and\nhandle long-range gates via costly SWAP insertions. Motivated by the success of\nthe time-dependent variational principle (TDVP) in many-body physics, we\nreinterpret quantum circuits as a series of discrete time evolutions, using\ngate generators to construct an MPS-based circuit simulation via a local TDVP\nformulation. This addresses TEBD's key limitations by (1) naturally\naccommodating long-range gates and (2) optimally representing states on the MPS\nmanifold. By diffusing entanglement more globally, the method suppresses local\nbond growth and reduces memory and runtime costs. We benchmark the approach on\nfive 49-qubit circuits: three Hamiltonian circuits (1D open and periodic\nHeisenberg, 2D 7x7 Ising) and two algorithmic ones (quantum approximate\noptimization, hardware-efficient ansatz).

Unlike other UHJs around\nearly-type stars, KELT-20 b's orbit is well aligned with its host star's spin\naxis and we test whether its distinct dynamical configuration is reflected in\nits composition.

Both our low resolution spectrum and the\nrefractory elemental ratios from Gandhi et al. 2023 suggest that nightside\ncondensation and rainout are limited to only the most refractory species in the\nplanet's atmosphere.

Several prescriptions have been proposed to extend their\ndefinition to generic plumbings by reversing the orientation of a negative\ndefinite plumbing, thus turning it into a positive definite one. Two existing\nproposals are relevant for this paper: (i) the regularized $+1/r$-surgery\nconjecture combined with the false-mock modular conjecture, and (ii) a\nconstruction based on resurgence and a false theta function duality. In this\nnote, we compare these proposals on the class of Brieskorn homology spheres\n$\\Sigma\\left(s,t,rst\\pm1\\right)$ and find that they are incompatible in\ngeneral. Our diagnostic is the effective central charge, $c_{\\text{eff}}$,\nwhich governs the asymptotic growth of coefficients of $\\widehat{Z}$. First, we\nprove that the upper bound on $c_{\\text{eff}}$ from prescription (i) is\ngoverned by the Ramanujan theta function, which regularizes the surgery\nformula. Second, we develop numerical and modular tools that deliver the lower\nbounds as well as exact values via mixed mock-modular analysis. Complementing\nthis, we also study $c_{\\text{eff}}$ for negative definite plumbed 3-manifolds\nwhich allow for a better comparison of pairs of 3-manifolds related by\norientation reversal. As a result, we find that for some Brieskorn spheres the\nsurgery and false-mock prescriptions violate the expected relation between\n$c_{\\text{eff}}$, Chern-Simons invariants and non-abelian flat connections.\nThese findings underscore $\\widehat{Z}$ as a sensitive probe of the \"positive\nside\" of $\\widehat{Z}$-theory.",

In\naddition, it relies on beyond-the-Standard Model physics active around the\nelectroweak scale: new physics coupling to the Higgs to make the electroweak\nphase transition first order, and a new mechanism of CP violation. The\nrelatively low energy scale at which electroweak baryogenesis occurs makes\ncertain aspects of the mechanism testable through collider experiments,\nelectric dipole moment measurements, and gravitational wave observations.\nHowever, scenarios of electroweak baryogenesis are increasingly challenged by\nresults from contemporary experiments. The developing experimental programs\nwill play a crucial role in either falsifying or detecting the new physics\nresponsible for electroweak baryogenesis. To achieve this, it is essential to\nmake precise predictions for the baryon asymmetry and the corresponding\nexperimental signatures within specific scenarios. This review aims to provide\na comprehensive overview of the rich physics involved in these predictions. Our\ngoal is to offer a practical computational guide, with a focus on recent\ndevelopments in the field.",

The boosted black hole is obtained from a\ngeneral twisting metric whose boost emerges from the BMS group. Employing a\nstandard procedure we build the electromagnetic energy-momentum tensor with the\nKerr boosted metric together with its timelike Killing vector as the\nelectromagnetic potential. We demonstrate that our solution satisfies Einstein\nfield equations up to a fourth-order expansion in $1/r$, indicating that the\nspacetime closely resembles a Kerr-Newman black hole whose boost points in a\narbitrary direction. Spacetime structures of the general black hole -- namely\nthe event horizon and ergosphere -- are examined in Bondi-Sachs coordinates.\nFor a proper timelike observer we show that the electric field generated by the\nboosted black hole exhibits a purely radial behavior, whereas the magnetic\nfield develops a complex structure characterized by two pronounced lobes\noriented opposite to the boost direction.",

    "abstract": "Recently, GPT-4o has garnered significant attention for its strong\nperformance in image generation, yet open-source models still lag behind.\nSeveral studies have explored distilling image data from GPT-4o to enhance\nopen-source models, achieving notable progress. However, a key question\nremains: given that real-world image datasets already constitute a natural\nsource of high-quality data, why should we use GPT-4o-generated synthetic data?\nIn this work, we identify two key advantages of synthetic images. First, they\ncan complement rare scenarios in real-world datasets, such as surreal fantasy\nor multi-reference image generation, which frequently occur in user queries.\nSecond, they provide clean and controllable supervision. Real-world data often\ncontains complex background noise and inherent misalignment between text\ndescriptions and image content, whereas synthetic images offer pure backgrounds\nand long-tailed supervision signals, facilitating more accurate text-to-image\nalignment. Building on these insights, we introduce Echo-4o-Image, a 180K-scale\nsynthetic dataset generated by GPT-4o, harnessing the power of synthetic image\ndata to address blind spots in real-world coverage. Using this dataset, we\nfine-tune the unified multimodal generation baseline Bagel to obtain Echo-4o.\nIn addition, we propose two new evaluation benchmarks for a more accurate and\nchallenging assessment of image generation capabilities: GenEval++, which\nincreases instruction complexity to mitigate score saturation, and\nImagine-Bench, which focuses on evaluating both the understanding and\ngeneration of imaginative content. Echo-4o demonstrates strong performance\nacross standard benchmarks. Moreover, applying Echo-4o-Image to other\nfoundation models (e.g., OmniGen2, BLIP3-o) yields consistent performance gains\nacross multiple metrics, highlighting the datasets strong transferability.",

We find\nthat both mass imbalance and mass anisotropy reduce the pairing strength and\nsuppress the inferred critical temperature $T_c$ by breaking perfect Fermi\nsurface nesting, and shift the BEC-BCS crossover. Despite these effects,\nsuperfluidity remains robust across the full range of densities and interlayer\nseparations considered, with no transition to an unpaired plasma state in the\nabsence of screening. Our results provide a baseline for understanding the\ninterplay of mass mismatch and anisotropy in current and emerging bilayer\nplatforms, including van der Waals heterostructures and anisotropic\ntwo-dimensional semiconductors. Our work also establishes that Fermi surface\nnesting is not a key ingredient for the bilayer superfluidity, which is always\nthe ground state for all electron-hole bilayers although the resultant $T_c$\ndepends on the parameter details and may very well be unmeasurably low for\nlarge interlayer separations.",

The analysis of\n$[\\mathrm{El}/\\mathrm{Fe}]$ ratios shows that most elements in PHSs follow the\nGalactic chemical evolution, but $[\\mathrm{Zr}/\\mathrm{Fe}]$,\n$[\\mathrm{La}/\\mathrm{Fe}]$, and $[\\mathrm{Ce}/\\mathrm{Fe}]$ are overabundant\nin PHSs relative to reference stars at a given $[\\mathrm{Fe}/\\mathrm{H}]$.\nCorrelations between $[\\mathrm{El}/\\mathrm{Fe}]$ and planet mass are generally\npositive, except for Sr, Y, and Ba, which show no significant trends. The\ndistribution of $\\Delta[\\mathrm{El}/\\mathrm{H}]$ versus condensation\ntemperature ($T_{\\mathrm{cond}}$) slopes is positively skewed for PHSs,\nindicating enrichment in refractory elements compared to analogues.

    "abstract": "In this work we improve the quantum communication rates of various quantum\nchannels of interest using permutation-invariant quantum codes. We focus in\nparticular on parametrized families of quantum channels and aim to improve\nbounds on their quantum capacity threshold, defined as the lowest noise level\nat which the quantum capacity of the channel family vanishes. These thresholds\nare important quantities as they mark the noise level up to which faithful\nquantum communication is theoretically possible. Our method exploits the fact\nthat independent and identically distributed quantum channels preserve any\npermutation symmetry present at the input. The resulting symmetric output\nstates can be described succinctly using the representation theory of the\nsymmetric and general linear groups, which we use to derive an efficient\nalgorithm for computing the channel coherent information of a\npermutation-invariant code. Our approach allows us to evaluate coherent\ninformation values for a large number of channel copies, e.g., at least 100\nchannel copies for qubit channels. We apply this method to various physically\nrelevant channel models, including general Pauli channels, the dephrasure\nchannel, the generalized amplitude damping channel, and the damping-dephasing\nchannel. For each channel family we obtain improved lower bounds on their\nquantum capacities. For example, for the 2-Pauli and BB84 channel families we\nsignificantly improve the best known quantum capacity thresholds derived in\n[Fern, Whaley 2008]. These threshold improvements are achieved using a\nrepetition code-like input state with non-orthogonal code states, which we\nfurther analyze in our representation-theoretic framework.",

    "abstract": "Graph incremental learning is a learning paradigm that aims to adapt trained\nmodels to continuously incremented graphs and data over time without the need\nfor retraining on the full dataset. However, regular graph machine learning\nmethods suffer from catastrophic forgetting when applied to incremental\nlearning settings, where previously learned knowledge is overridden by new\nknowledge. Previous approaches have tried to address this by treating the\npreviously trained model as an inseparable unit and using techniques to\nmaintain old behaviors while learning new knowledge. These approaches, however,\ndo not account for the fact that previously acquired knowledge at different\ntimestamps contributes differently to learning new tasks. Some prior patterns\ncan be transferred to help learn new data, while others may deviate from the\nnew data distribution and be detrimental. To address this, we propose a dynamic\nmixture-of-experts (DyMoE) approach for incremental learning. Specifically, a\nDyMoE GNN layer adds new expert networks specialized in modeling the incoming\ndata blocks. We design a customized regularization loss that utilizes data\nsequence information so existing experts can maintain their ability to solve\nold tasks while helping the new expert learn the new data effectively. As the\nnumber of data blocks grows over time, the computational cost of the full\nmixture-of-experts (MoE) model increases. To address this, we introduce a\nsparse MoE approach, where only the top-$k$ most relevant experts make\npredictions, significantly reducing the computation time.

We\ncarry out a stringent membership selection, finding 303 with SNR>70 and 125\nwith lower SNR. We reinforced the finding that stars with high [N/Fe]\nabundances show higher [Fe/H] than their lower [N/Fe] counterparts. Mg,Ca and\nglobal alpha abundances show similar trends, while Si is well-behaved. The\n[Fe/H] value of these 2nd population stars is corrected to derive the mean\nmetallicity. Mean metallicities are determined to a precision of 0.05\ndex,[alpha/Fe] to 0.06 dex, and radial velocity to 3.4 km/s. No clusters show\nstrong evidence for internal metallicity variation, including M22. Abundances\nfor 11 other elements using only 1st population stars are calculated and are\ngenerally in good agreement with the literature.

The BGC metallicity distribution is\nbimodal, with peaks at [Fe/H]=-0.45 and -1.1, with the metal-poor peak strongly\ndominant, while exsitu GCs are unimodal, with a peak at -1.6. Surprisingly, we\nfind only a small, statistically insignificant difference in the mean [Si/Fe]\nof in and exsitu GCs.

A celebrated result of this\ntype, due to Alon-Fischer-Newman and Lov\\'asz-Szegedy, states that for graphs\nof bounded VC dimension, one can reduce the tower-type bounds to polynomial.\n  The graph regularity lemma has been extended to the setting of $k$-graphs by\nGowers, Nagle-R\\\"odl-Schacht-Skokan, and Tao. Unfortunately, these lemmas come\nwith even larger Ackermann-type bounds. Chernikov-Starchenko and Fox-Pach-Suk\nconsidered a strong notion of $k$-graph VC dimension and proved that $k$-graphs\nof bounded VC dimension have regular partitions of polynomial size. Shelah\nintroduced a weaker and combinatorially natural notion of dimension, called\nVC$_2$ dimension, which has since been extensively studied. In particular,\nChernikov, Towsner, Terry, and Wolf asked if one can improve the worst case\nbounds for 3-graph regularity when the 3-graph has bounded VC$_2$ dimension.\nOur main result in this paper answers this question positively in the following\nstrong sense: in the setting of bounded VC$_2$ dimension, one can reduce the\nbounds for 3-graph regularity by one level in Ackermann hierarchy. Furthermore,\nour new bound is best possible.\n  Our proof has two key steps. We first introduce a new method for designing\nregularity lemmas for graphs of bounded VC dimension, based on the cylinder\nregularity lemma. We then prove a hypergraph version of the cylinder regularity\nlemma, which allows us to extend this method to hypergraphs. We also highlight\na few other applications of this cylinder regularity lemma, which we expect to\nfind many other uses.",

    "abstract": "The new paradigm of test-time scaling has yielded remarkable breakthroughs in\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) (e.g. reasoning models) and in generative vision\nmodels, allowing models to allocate additional computation during inference to\neffectively tackle increasingly complex problems. Despite the improvements of\nthis approach, an important limitation emerges: the substantial increase in\ncomputation time makes the process slow and impractical for many applications.\nGiven the success of this paradigm and its growing usage, we seek to preserve\nits benefits while eschewing the inference overhead. In this work we propose\none solution to the critical problem of integrating test-time scaling knowledge\ninto a model during post-training. Specifically, we replace reward guided\ntest-time noise optimization in diffusion models with a Noise Hypernetwork that\nmodulates initial input noise. We propose a theoretically grounded framework\nfor learning this reward-tilted distribution for distilled generators, through\na tractable noise-space objective that maintains fidelity to the base model\nwhile optimizing for desired characteristics. We show that our approach\nrecovers a substantial portion of the quality gains from explicit test-time\noptimization at a fraction of the computational cost.

Each case is derived from real diagnostic workflows and incorporates\ntemporal interactions between textual medical histories and multiple imaging\nmodalities, including CT, MRI, PET, ultrasound, and X-ray, requiring models to\nperform deep integrative reasoning across images and clinical texts. MedAtlas\nprovides expert-annotated gold standards for all tasks. Furthermore, we propose\ntwo novel evaluation metrics: Round Chain Accuracy and Error Propagation\nResistance.

This\nproblem promises to become more and more relevant as providers like Microsoft\nallow users to easily create custom LLM \"assistants\" specialized to particular\ntypes of queries. However, some tasks (i.e., queries) may be too specialized\nand difficult for a single LLM to handle alone. These applications often\nbenefit from breaking down the task into smaller subtasks, each of which can\nthen be executed by a LLM expected to perform well on that specific subtask.\nFor example, in extracting a diagnosis from medical records, one can first\nselect an LLM to summarize the record, select another to validate the summary,\nand then select another, possibly different, LLM to extract the diagnosis from\nthe summarized record. Unlike existing LLM selection or routing algorithms,\nthis setting requires that we select a sequence of LLMs, with the output of\neach LLM feeding into the next and potentially influencing its success. Thus,\nunlike single LLM selection, the quality of each subtask's output directly\naffects the inputs, and hence the cost and success rate, of downstream LLMs,\ncreating complex performance dependencies that must be learned and accounted\nfor during selection. We propose a neural contextual bandit-based algorithm\nthat trains neural networks that model LLM success on each subtask in an online\nmanner, thus learning to guide the LLM selections for the different subtasks,\neven in the absence of historical LLM performance data. Experiments on\ntelecommunications question answering and medical diagnosis prediction datasets\nillustrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach compared to other LLM\nselection algorithms.",

GPT-5-high achieved\nthe highest accuracy (0.965; 95% CI, 0.942-0.985), outperforming all GPT-5-nano\nvariants (P < .001), o1-high (P = .04), and GPT-4o (P < .001), but not o3-high\n(0.958; 95% CI, 0.931-0.981). GPT-5-high ranked first in both accuracy (1.66x\nstronger than o3-high) and rationale quality (1.11x stronger than o3-high).\nCost-accuracy analysis identified several GPT-5 configurations on the Pareto\nfrontier, with GPT-5-mini-low offering the most favorable low-cost,\nhigh-performance balance. These results benchmark GPT-5 on a high-quality\nophthalmology dataset, demonstrate the influence of reasoning effort on\naccuracy, and introduce an autograder framework for scalable evaluation of\nLLM-generated answers against reference standards in ophthalmology.",

However, there is still a lack\nof systematic studies of the star-formation scaling relation of CO and [CI]\nlines across cosmic time on multiple physical scales. Methods. We used\nobservations of the ground state transitions of [CI], CO, and [CII], for 885\nsources collected from the literature, to infer possible correlations between\nline luminosities of $\\rm L^{'}_{[CI](1-0)}, \\rm L^{'}_{CO(1-0)}$, and $\\rm\nL^{'}_{[CII]}$ with star formation rates (SFR).

Diffusion-based generative models\nhave shown promise for LDCT denoising by learning image priors and performing\niterative refinement. In this work, we introduce AST-n, an accelerated\ninference framework that initiates reverse diffusion from intermediate noise\nlevels, and integrate high-order ODE solvers within conditioned models to\nfurther reduce sampling steps. We evaluate two acceleration paradigms--AST-n\nsampling and standard scheduling with high-order solvers -- on the Low Dose CT\nGrand Challenge dataset, covering head, abdominal, and chest scans at 10-25 %\nof standard dose. Conditioned models using only 25 steps (AST-25) achieve peak\nsignal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) above 38 dB and structural similarity index (SSIM)\nabove 0.95, closely matching standard baselines while cutting inference time\nfrom ~16 seg to under 1 seg per slice. Unconditional sampling suffers\nsubstantial quality loss, underscoring the necessity of conditioning. We also\nassess DDIM inversion, which yields marginal PSNR gains at the cost of doubling\ninference time, limiting its clinical practicality. Our results demonstrate\nthat AST-n with high-order samplers enables rapid LDCT reconstruction without\nsignificant loss of image fidelity, advancing the feasibility of\ndiffusion-based methods in clinical workflows.",

    "abstract": "Secondary electron (SE) imaging techniques, such as scanning electron\nmicroscopy and helium ion microscopy (HIM), use electrons emitted by a sample\nin response to a focused beam of charged particles incident at a grid of raster\nscan positions. Spot size -- the diameter of the incident beam's spatial\nprofile -- is one of the limiting factors for resolution, along with various\nsources of noise in the SE signal. The effect of the beam spatial profile is\ncommonly understood as convolutional. We show that under a simple and plausible\nphysical abstraction for the beam, though convolution describes the mean of the\nSE counts, the full distribution of SE counts is a mixture. We demonstrate that\nthis more detailed modeling can enable resolution improvements over\nconventional estimators through a stylized application in semiconductor\ninspection of localizing the edge in a two-valued sample. We derive Fisher\ninformation about edge location in conventional and time-resolved measurements\n(TRM) and also derive the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) from the latter.\nEmpirically, the MLE computed from TRM is approximately efficient except at\nvery low beam diameter, so Fisher information comparisons are predictive of\nperformance and can be used to optimize the beam diameter relative to the\nraster scan spacing. Monte Carlo simulations show that the MLE gives a 5-fold\nreduction in root mean-squared error (RMSE) of edge localization as compared to\nconventional interpolation-based estimation.

Periodically\ndriven (i.e. Floquet) quantum systems in particular exhibit complex dynamics\neven in small dimensions, motivating the study of how interactions and\nHamiltonian structure affect recurrence behavior. While most existing studies\ntreat recurrence in an approximate, distance-based sense, here we address the\nproblem of exact, state-independent recurrences in a broad class of\nfinite-dimensional Floquet systems, spanning both integrable and non-integrable\nmodels. Leveraging techniques from algebraic field theory, we construct an\narithmetic framework that identifies all possible recurrence times by analyzing\nthe cyclotomic structure of the Floquet unitary's spectrum. This\ncomputationally efficient approach yields both positive results, enumerating\nall candidate recurrence times and definitive negative results, rigorously\nruling out exact recurrences for given Hamiltonian parameters.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly utilized in AI-driven\neducational instruction and assessment, particularly within mathematics\neducation. The capability of LLMs to generate accurate answers and detailed\nsolutions for math problem-solving tasks is foundational for ensuring reliable\nand precise feedback and assessment in math education practices. Our study\nfocuses on evaluating the accuracy of four LLMs (OpenAI GPT-4o and o1,\nDeepSeek-V3 and DeepSeek-R1) solving three categories of math tasks, including\narithmetic, algebra, and number theory, and identifies step-level reasoning\nerrors within their solutions. Instead of relying on standard benchmarks, we\nintentionally build math tasks (via item models) that are challenging for LLMs\nand prone to errors. The accuracy of final answers and the presence of errors\nin individual solution steps were systematically analyzed and coded. Both\nsingle-agent and dual-agent configurations were tested. It is observed that the\nreasoning-enhanced OpenAI o1 model consistently achieved higher or nearly\nperfect accuracy across all three math task categories. Analysis of errors\nrevealed that procedural slips were the most frequent and significantly\nimpacted overall performance, while conceptual misunderstandings were less\nfrequent. Deploying dual-agent configurations substantially improved overall\nperformance. These findings offer actionable insights into enhancing LLM\nperformance and underscore effective strategies for integrating LLMs into\nmathematics education, thereby advancing AI-driven instructional practices and\nassessment precision.",

In order to run computations reliably on such devices, a fully\nfault-tolerant scheme is needed for state preparation, gates, and measurements.\nHowever, current fault-tolerant schemes have either been limited to specific\ncode families or have not been developed fully. In this work, we develop a\ngeneral framework for fault-tolerant computation with logical degrees encoded\ninto Majorana hardware. We emphasize the division between even and odd Majorana\ncodes and how it manifests when constructing fault tolerant gadgets for these\nfamilies. We provide transversal constructions and supplement them with\nmeasurements to obtain several examples of fault tolerant Clifford gadgets. For\nthe case of odd codes, we give a novel construction for gadgets using quantum\nreference frames, that allows to implement operations that are forbidden due to\nparity superselection. We also provide a fault-tolerant measurement scheme for\nMajorana codes inspired by Steane error correction, enabling state preparation,\nmeasurement of logical operations and error correction. We also point out a\nconstruction for odd Majorana codes with transversal T gates. Finally, we\nconstruct an asympotically good quantum LDPC Majorana code with qubit degrees\nof freedom.

    "abstract": "Outlier detection holds significant importance in the realm of data mining,\nparticularly with the growing pervasiveness of data acquisition methods. The\nability to identify outliers in data streams is essential for maintaining data\nquality and detecting faults. However, dealing with data streams presents\nchallenges due to the non-stationary nature of distributions and the\never-increasing data volume. While numerous methods have been proposed to\ntackle this challenge, a common drawback is the lack of straightforward\nparameterization in many of them. This article introduces two novel methods:\nDyCF and DyCG. DyCF leverages the Christoffel function from the theory of\napproximation and orthogonal polynomials. Conversely, DyCG capitalizes on the\ngrowth properties of the Christoffel function, eliminating the need for tuning\nparameters. Both approaches are firmly rooted in a well-defined algebraic\nframework, meeting crucial demands for data stream processing, with a specific\nfocus on addressing low-dimensional aspects and maintaining data history\nwithout memory cost. A comprehensive comparison between DyCF, DyCG, and\nstate-of-the-art methods is presented, using both synthetic and real industrial\ndata streams. The results show that DyCF outperforms fine-tuning methods,\noffering superior performance in terms of execution time and memory usage. DyCG\nperforms less well, but has the considerable advantage of requiring no tuning\nat all.",

As students participate in these activities, it is important to\nconsider how group members collectively regulate their activity and complete\ngroup task. Regulation in a group often involves adaptive responsivity from\ngroup members when they notice and deal with a challenge. The theoretical\nframework of socially shared regulation emphasizes group members\ncollaboratively regulating within the group but does not focus on portraying\nhow the shared regulation is developed in the moment. Currently, the field\nlacks a framework characterizing the momentary development of a regulatory\naction in a group. Our study addresses this gap. In our video data, incoming\ncollege students were enrolled in a summer program designed to promote students\nmetacognitive skills to be incorporated in their study of science. We have\nobserved various moments in which the students spontaneously made a move to\nregulate the hands-on, inquiry activity in completing their tasks and achieving\ngroup goals. We developed a framework called Emergent Explicit Regulation to\ncharacterize those moments. The EER framework captures students in the moment\nregulatory moves to respond to a challenge, articulating how those moves\nemerge, in what ways they are explicit and regulatory. In this paper, we first\nintroduce the EER framework and situate the EER framework in the context of\ncollaborative scientific inquiry learning. We then present a case study where\nwe applied the EER framework to identify typical EER instances in one small\ngroup when the students completed the task of building a model to represent the\nclimate of the Earth atmosphere.

More recent approaches such as\nRetrieval-Augmented Diffusion Models (RDM) address efficiency by conditioning\ndenoising on similar examples retrieved from large external memory banks.

Recent advances in the\nnanofabrication of low-loss integrated nonlinear microresonators have paved the\nway for the exploration of coupled-resonator systems. These systems provide\nsignificant technological advantages, including higher conversion efficiency\nand the generation of dual dispersive waves. Beyond their practical benefits,\ncoupled-resonator systems also reveal novel emergent nonlinear phenomena, such\nas soliton hopping, a dynamic process in which solitons periodically transfer\nbetween coupled resonators. In this study, we employ a dynamical system\napproach and the corresponding well-established numerical techniques,\nextensively developed within the context of hydrodynamics and transitional\nturbulence, to investigate the bifurcation structure of periodic orbit\nsolutions of the coupled Lugiato-Lefever equations that underlie soliton\nhopping in photonic dimers and trimers. Our main finding uncovers a fundamental\ndifference in the origin of the hopping process in dimers and trimers. We\ndemonstrate that in dimers, hopping emerges from a branch of stable soliton\nsolutions, whereas in trimers, it originates from an unstable branch. This\ndistinction leads to a significant difference in pump power requirements. We\nrelate the bifurcation structure of the periodic orbits including their\nstability to the observed dynamics in simulated laser scans mimicking typical\nexperimental investigations. Subcritical Hopf bifurcations of unstable\nequilibrium branches specifically explain observed hysteresis, the coexistence\nof multiple attractors at the same parameter values, and the importance of\nchoosing a specific path in parameter space to reliably achieve a desired\ndynamical regime.",

    "abstract": "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a leading modality for the diagnosis of\nliver cancer, significantly improving the classification of the lesion and\npatient outcomes. However, traditional MRI faces challenges including risks\nfrom contrast agent (CA) administration, time-consuming manual assessment, and\nlimited annotated datasets. To address these limitations, we propose a\nTime-Conditioned Autoregressive Contrast Enhancement (T-CACE) framework for\nsynthesizing multi-phase contrast-enhanced MRI (CEMRI) directly from\nnon-contrast MRI (NCMRI). T-CACE introduces three core innovations: a\nconditional token encoding (CTE) mechanism that unifies anatomical priors and\ntemporal phase information into latent representations; and a dynamic\ntime-aware attention mask (DTAM) that adaptively modulates inter-phase\ninformation flow using a Gaussian-decayed attention mechanism, ensuring smooth\nand physiologically plausible transitions across phases. Furthermore, a\nconstraint for temporal classification consistency (TCC) aligns the lesion\nclassification output with the evolution of the physiological signal, further\nenhancing diagnostic reliability. Extensive experiments on two independent\nliver MRI datasets demonstrate that T-CACE outperforms state-of-the-art methods\nin image synthesis, segmentation, and lesion classification. This framework\noffers a clinically relevant and efficient alternative to traditional\ncontrast-enhanced imaging, improving safety, diagnostic efficiency, and\nreliability for the assessment of liver lesion.

The lingering\ntransition is stretched in time by memory of spatial and energy heterogeneity\nand, contrary to known memory effects in vanadium oxides commonly described by\npower laws, follows an extremely (factor below 0.2) stretched exponential.

Yet, minimal work has\nexamined how the weighting of individual midterm exam scores can also\ncontribute to equity gaps. In this work, we examine how three midterm exam\nscore aggregation methods for final grades affect equity gaps. We collected\nmidterm exam data from approximately 6,000 students in an introductory physics\ncourse over 6 years at a large, research-intensive university. Using this data\nset, we applied common midterm exam score aggregation methods to determine\ntheir impact on aggregated midterm exam grades: dropping the lowest midterm\nexam score, replacing the lowest midterm exam score with the final exam score\nif higher, and counting the highest midterm exam score more in the final grade\ncalculation than the lowest midterm exam score. We find that dropping the\nlowest midterm exam score resulted in the largest increase in final grades,\nwith students with lower grades benefiting the most.

While recent work has shown that large language models (LLMs) can\nbe effective context-aided forecasters via na\\\"ive direct prompting, their full\npotential remains underexplored. We address this gap with 4 strategies,\nproviding new insights into the zero-shot capabilities of LLMs in this setting.\nReDP improves interpretability by eliciting explicit reasoning traces, allowing\nus to assess the model's reasoning over the context independently from its\nforecast accuracy. CorDP leverages LLMs solely to refine existing forecasts\nwith context, enhancing their applicability in real-world forecasting\npipelines. IC-DP proposes embedding historical examples of context-aided\nforecasting tasks in the prompt, substantially improving accuracy even for the\nlargest models. Finally, RouteDP optimizes resource efficiency by using LLMs to\nestimate task difficulty, and routing the most challenging tasks to larger\nmodels. Evaluated on different kinds of context-aided forecasting tasks from\nthe CiK benchmark, our strategies demonstrate distinct benefits over na\\\"ive\nprompting across LLMs of different sizes and families.

Large Language\nModels (LLMs) have shown promise in this task by leveraging their vast\ncross-disciplinary scientific knowledge. However, existing LLM-based methods\nprimarily rely on direct inference or prompt engineering, often requiring\nexcessive inference iterations to converge on correct formulas or failing to\ntreating complex equation targets. These limitations in effectiveness and\ngeneralization stem from an inherent tension between pre-trained LLMs'\nproficiency in approximate reasoning and the high-precision demands of SR\ntasks. To bridge this gap, we propose to fine-tune LLMs for enhanced SR\ncapability. Yet, the absence of dedicated datasets for SR-oriented fine-tuning\nremains a critical barrier. We thus introduce SymbArena, specifically\nengineered to optimize LLMs for SR. This benchmark comprises 148,102 diverse\nequations formulated as corpora of 1.83 billion tokens for LLM utilization,\nenabling effective training and inference. Further, SymbArena proposes a\nheuristics metric to precisely quantify form-level consistency, going beyond\nexisting SR numerical-oriented evaluation strategies. With this benchmark, we\nexplore mainstream LLM fine-tuning techniques for SR tasks and establish\nSymbolicChat, a simple yet effective LLM-based SR strong baseline. Experimental\nresults validate SymbolicChat as the first LLM to exceed traditional numerical\nmethods in both numerical precision and symbolic form accuracy, outperforming\nthe second-best LLM baseline with improvements of 2-fold gains in R2 score and\n8.37% in form-level consistency score.",

Beyond a high\nnumber of ignitions, the country has experienced devastating mega-fires, such\nas those in 2017. Accurate forecasting of wildfire occurrence and burned areas\nis therefore essential for effective firefighting resource allocation and\nemergency preparedness. In this study, we present a novel two-stage ensemble\napproach that extends the widely used latent Gaussian modelling framework with\nthe integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA) for spatio-temporal wildfire\nforecasting. The first stage uses XGBoost, a gradient boosting model, to\nidentify wildfire patterns from environmental covariates and historical fire\nrecords, producing one-month-ahead point forecasts for fire counts and burned\narea. These predictions are then incorporated as external covariates in a\nlatent Gaussian model, which includes additional spatiotemporal random effects\nto produce the final probabilistic forecasts of monthly total fire counts and\nburned area at the council level. To effectively model both moderate and\nextreme wildfire events, we implement the extended generalised Pareto (eGP)\nlikelihood (a sub-asymptotic distribution) within the INLA framework. We also\ndevelop and discuss penalised complexity priors (PC-priors) for the eGP\nparameters and provide a comprehensive comparison of the eGP likelihood against\nother commonly employed distributions in environmental modelling, such as the\nGamma and Weibull distributions. The proposed framework addresses the challenge\nof accessing future environmental covariates, which are typically unavailable\nat prediction time, and demonstrates strong performance in one-month-ahead\nwildfire forecasting.",

We\ndesign a fully retroactive monotonic priority queue with a cost of $O(\\log m +\nT(m))$ time per operation, where $T(m)$ is the maximum between the query and\nthe update time of a specific range-searching data structure with $m$ elements.\nFinally, we design a fully retroactive monotonic priority queue that costs\n$O(\\log m \\log \\log m)$ time per operation.",

To move beyond this\ngeneric supervision, we enhance the architecture with a methodology inspired by\nSystem Identification from control theory.

At the field-scale,\nthis predictive soil modeling (PSM) task is typically constrained by small\ntraining sample sizes and high feature-to-sample ratios in soil spectroscopy.\nTraditionally, these conditions have proven challenging for conventional deep\nlearning methods. Classical machine learning algorithms, particularly\ntree-based models like Random Forest and linear models such as Partial Least\nSquares Regression, have long been the default choice for field-scale PSM.\nRecent advances in artificial neural networks (ANN) for tabular data challenge\nthis view, yet their suitability for field-scale PSM has not been proven. We\nintroduce a comprehensive benchmark that evaluates state-of-the-art ANN\narchitectures, including the latest multilayer perceptron (MLP)-based models\n(TabM, RealMLP), attention-based transformer variants (FT-Transformer,\nExcelFormer, T2G-Former, AMFormer), retrieval-augmented approaches (TabR,\nModernNCA), and an in-context learning foundation model (TabPFN). Our\nevaluation encompasses 31 field- and farm-scale datasets containing 30 to 460\nsamples and three critical soil properties: soil organic matter or soil organic\ncarbon, pH, and clay content. Our results reveal that modern ANNs consistently\noutperform classical methods on the majority of tasks, demonstrating that deep\nlearning has matured sufficiently to overcome the long-standing dominance of\nclassical machine learning for PSM. Notably, TabPFN delivers the strongest\noverall performance, showing robustness across varying conditions.

(2) While scaling distillation can\nenhance reasoning, it often degrades out-of-domain performance. A carefully\ncurated, smaller corpus achieves a balanced trade-off between in-domain and\nout-of-domain capabilities. (3) Diverse reasoning trajectories encourage the\nstudent model to develop robust reasoning skills. We validate our method\nthrough evaluations on mathematical reasoning (AIME 2024/2025, MATH-500) and\ncode generation (LiveCodeBench), achieving state-of-the-art results with only\n0.8k carefully curated examples, bypassing the need for extensive scaling.

    "abstract": "We study the symmetric Dyson exclusion process (SDEP) - a lattice gas with\nexclusion and long-range, Coulomb-type interactions that emerge both as the\nmaximal-activity limit of the symmetric exclusion process and as a discrete\nversion of Dyson's Brownian motion on the unitary group. Exploiting an exact\nground-state (Doob) transform, we map the stochastic generator of the SDEP onto\nthe spin-$1/2$ XX quantum chain, which in turn admits a free-fermion\nrepresentation. At macroscopic scales we conjecture that the SDEP displays\nballistic (Eulerian) scaling and non-local hydrodynamics governed by the\nequation $\\partial_t \\rho+\\partial_x j[\\rho]=0$ with\n$j[\\rho]=(1/\\pi)\\sin(\\pi\\rho(x,t))\\sinh(\\pi\\mathcal{H}\\rho(x,t))$, where\n$\\mathcal{H}$ is the Hilbert transform, making the current a genuinely\nnon-local functional of the density. This non-local one-field description is\nequivalent to a local two-field \"complex Hopf\" system for finite particle\ndensity. Closed evolution formulas allow us to solve the melting of single and\ndouble block initial states, producing limit shapes and arctic curves that\nagree with large-scale Monte Carlo simulations. The model thus offers a\ntractable example of emergent non-local hydrodynamics driven by long-range\ninteractions.",

    "abstract": "How can we address distribution shifts in stock price data to improve stock\nprice prediction accuracy? Stock price prediction has attracted attention from\nboth academia and industry, driven by its potential to uncover complex market\npatterns and enhance decisionmaking. However, existing methods often fail to\nhandle distribution shifts effectively, focusing on scaling or representation\nadaptation without fully addressing distributional discrepancies and shape\nmisalignments between training and test data. We propose ReVol\n(Return-Volatility Normalization for Mitigating Distribution Shift in Stock\nPrice Data), a robust method for stock price prediction that explicitly\naddresses the distribution shift problem. ReVol leverages three key strategies\nto mitigate these shifts: (1) normalizing price features to remove\nsample-specific characteristics, including return, volatility, and price scale,\n(2) employing an attention-based module to estimate these characteristics\naccurately, thereby reducing the influence of market anomalies, and (3)\nreintegrating the sample characteristics into the predictive process, restoring\nthe traits lost during normalization. Additionally, ReVol combines geometric\nBrownian motion for long-term trend modeling with neural networks for\nshort-term pattern recognition, unifying their complementary strengths.\nExtensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that ReVol enhances\nthe performance of the state-of-the-art backbone models in most cases,\nachieving an average improvement of more than 0.03 in IC and over 0.7 in SR\nacross various settings.",

This work presents a shank\nangle-based control system that enables the exoskeleton to maintain real-time\ncoordination with human gait, even under phase perturbations, while dynamically\nshaping assistance profiles to match the biological ankle moment patterns\nacross walking, running, stair negotiation tasks. The control system consists\nof an assistance profile online generation method and a model-based feedforward\ncontrol method.

Three\nexperiments were conducted using a lightweight soft exoskeleton with multiple\nsubjects.

This paradigm has\ninspired the development of scientific foundation models (FMs). However,\napplying this capability to experimental particle physics is challenging due to\nthe sparse, spatially distributed nature of detector data, which differs\ndramatically from natural language. This work addresses if an FM for particle\nphysics can scale and generalize across diverse tasks. We introduce a new\ndataset with more than 11 million particle collision events and a suite of\ndownstream tasks and labeled data for evaluation. We propose a novel\nself-supervised training method for detector data and demonstrate its neural\nscalability with models that feature up to 188 million parameters. With frozen\nweights and task-specific adapters, this FM consistently outperforms baseline\nmodels across all downstream tasks. The performance also exhibits robust\ndata-efficient adaptation. Further analysis reveals that the representations\nextracted by the FM are task-agnostic but can be specialized via a single\nlinear mapping for different downstream tasks.",

In this study, we introduce FedShard, the\nfirst federated unlearning algorithm designed to concurrently guarantee both\nefficiency fairness and performance fairness. FedShard adaptively addresses the\nchallenges introduced by dilemmas among convergence, unlearning efficiency, and\nunlearning fairness. Furthermore, we propose two novel metrics to\nquantitatively assess the fairness of unlearning algorithms, which we prove to\nsatisfy well-known properties in other existing fairness measurements. Our\ntheoretical analysis and numerical evaluation validate FedShard's fairness in\nterms of both unlearning performance and efficiency. We demonstrate that\nFedShard mitigates unfairness risks such as cascaded leaving and poisoning\nattacks and realizes more balanced unlearning costs among clients. Experimental\nresults indicate that FedShard accelerates the data unlearning process 1.3-6.2\ntimes faster than retraining from scratch and 4.9 times faster than the\nstate-of-the-art exact unlearning methods.",

In order to {\\em preserve\ncausality throughout\\/} the star, we adopt a two-phase hybrid construction for\nthe stellar matter, in which the core region consists of deconfined quark\nmatter described by the MIT bag model, while the outer layers are composed of\nhadronic matter represented by unified equations of state such as SLy4, BSk20,\nand BSk21. Within this framework, we derive the modified field equations with\nstatic spherical symmetry, and numerically integrate the corresponding\nTolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations with the chosen hybrid equations of\nstate. Our analyses show that, unlike in general relativity, the Ricci scalar\nremains nonzero outside the stellar surface, and gradually falls to zero beyond\n50 km, while the stellar surface remains within 10--12 km for the hybrid\nequations of state considered. This extended Ricci scalar profile arises from\nthe extra degree of freedom (scalaron) inherent in Starobinsky gravity, which\nalso contributes to the gravitational mass outside the star, causing the ADM\nmass measured at infinity to exceed the stellar mass at the surface.\nNevertheless, the key physical relationships, such as the mass-central density\nand mass-radius curves, remain consistent with what is expected physically.\nNotably, we find that the maximum stable mass of neutron stars increases with\nthe Starobinsky parameter $\\alpha$, with the combined MIT-BSk21 model\nsupporting an ADM mass of up to $2.07 \\, M_\\odot$ for $\\alpha = 10\\,r_g^2$.\nThis theoreical limit for a nonrotating neutron star suggests that a rotating\nconfiguration could reach mass thresholds in the range of $2.48$ to $2.59 \\,\nM_\\odot$, considering that rapid rotation can enhance the maximum mass by\napproximately 20--25\\%.",

Given the easier training and superior\nperformance of continuous VAEs, an intuitive idea is to enhance discrete video\nVAEs by leveraging continuous VAEs. After rethinking the intrinsic link between\ndiscrete and continuous representations, we found that FSQ could effectively\npreserve pre-trained continuous VAE priors compared to other quantization\nmethods. By leveraging continuous VAE priors, it converges several times faster\nthan training from scratch and achieves superior performance at convergence.\nMeanwhile, two structural improvements are proposed. First, inspired by how\ncontinuous VAEs enhance reconstruction via enlarged latent dimensions, we\nintroduce a multi-token quantization mechanism, which achieves nearly a 1 dB\nimprovement in PSNR without compromising the token compression ratio. Second,\nto tackle reconstruction challenges in high-compression video VAEs, we\nstrengthen first-frame reconstruction, enabling the causal VAE to leverage this\ninformation in subsequent frames and markedly improving the performance of 4 x\n16 x 16 discrete VAEs. Furthermore, we propose a joint discrete-continuous\noptimization scheme that unifies the two paradigms and, for the first time,\nachieves competitive performance on both continuous and discrete\nrepresentations within a single network.

    "abstract": "While electroencephalogram (EEG) has been a crucial tool for monitoring the\nbrain and diagnosing neurological disorders (e.g., epilepsy), learning\nmeaningful representations from raw EEG signals remains challenging due to\nlimited annotations and high signal variability. Recently, EEG foundation\nmodels (FMs) have shown promising potential by adopting transformer\narchitectures and self-supervised pre-training methods from large language\nmodels (e.g., masked prediction) to learn representations from diverse EEG\ndata, followed by fine-tuning on specific EEG tasks. Nonetheless, these large\nmodels often incurred high computational costs during both training and\ninference, with only marginal performance improvements as the model size\nincreases. In this work, we proposed an EEG representation learning framework\nbuilding upon Generative Diffusion Model (EEGDM). Specifically, we developed a\nstructured state-space model for diffusion pretraining (SSMDP) to better\ncapture the temporal dynamics of EEG signals and trained it using Denoising\nDiffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) framework. Subsequently, the resulting\nlatent EEG representations were then used for downstream classification tasks\nvia our proposed latent fusion transformer (LFT). To evaluate our method, we\nused multi-event datasets covering both interictal epileptiform discharges\n(TUEV) and seizure (CHB-MIT) detection, and compared EEGDM with current\nstate-of-the-art approaches, including EEG FMs. Empirical results showed that\nour method outperformed the existing methods. These findings suggested that\nEEGDM offered a promising alternative to current FMs. Our source code and\ncheckpoint are available at: https://github.com/jhpuah/EEGDM.",

    "abstract": "Multi-channel aperiodic fiber Bragg grating (FBG) based hydroxyl (OH) line\nfilters have attracted significant interest in ground-based near-infrared (NIR)\nastronomical observations. In this paper, we present the performance of a new\nself-compensating enclosure for the filters, that can be used in\nnon-temperature-controlled environments. Our prototype encloses a 110 mm long\nsingle-mode photosensitive optical fiber with three 10 mm filter gratings. A\nfourth grating was used as a reference outside the package to measure the\nuncompensated wavelength shift. The prototype was tested over three thermal\ncycles, and showed a maximum wavelength deviation of 12 pm, a wavelength drift\nof only 0.37 pm/$^{\\circ}$C, over the temperature range of -17$^{\\circ}$C to\n15$^{\\circ}$C. The athermalization factor, i.e., the ratio of the maximum\nwavelength shift of the compensated grating to the uncompensated reference\nfilter grating was $\\frac{1}{22}$. The results demonstrate the capability of\nthe prototype for stabilizing multi-channel long-length FBGs or chirped FBGs,\nparticularly for astronomical applications that require sub-picometer\nstability.",

This framework combines\nwhole-body bilateral teleoperation with an online multi-stage object inertial\nparameter estimation module, which is the core technical contribution of this\nwork. The multi-stage process sequentially integrates a vision-based object\nsize estimator, an initial parameter guess generated by a large vision-language\nmodel (VLM), and a decoupled hierarchical sampling strategy. The visual size\nestimate and VLM prior offer a strong initial guess of the object's inertial\nparameters, significantly reducing the search space for sampling-based\nrefinement and improving the overall estimation speed. A hierarchical strategy\nfirst estimates mass and center of mass, then infers inertia from object size\nto ensure physically feasible parameters, while a decoupled multi-hypothesis\nscheme enhances robustness to VLM prior errors. Our estimator operates in\nparallel with high-fidelity simulation and hardware, enabling real-time online\nupdates. The estimated parameters are then used to update the wheeled\nhumanoid's equilibrium point, allowing the operator to focus more on locomotion\nand manipulation. This integration improves the haptic force feedback for\ndynamic synchronization, enabling more dynamic whole-body teleoperation. By\ncompensating for object dynamics using the estimated parameters, the framework\nalso improves manipulation tracking while preserving compliant behavior. We\nvalidate the system on a customized wheeled humanoid with a robotic gripper and\nhuman-machine interface, demonstrating real-time execution of lifting,\ndelivering, and releasing tasks with a payload weighing approximately one-third\nof the robot's body weight.",

With major airlines now offering Starlink Internet\nonboard, there is a growing need to evaluate and improve its performance for\naviation users. This paper addresses this shortcoming by conducting in-flight\nmeasurements over the Baltic Sea and the Pacific Ocean. Our measurement results\nshow that a single user device experiences median throughputs of 64 Mbps and 24\nMbps for the downlink and uplink, respectively. The median uplink throughput is\napproximately 33 Mbps when the aircraft maintains an altitude above 17,000\nfeet.

We dive deeper into 5.5 hours of ping measurements collected over\nthe Pacific Ocean and investigate factors influencing RTT, hypothesizing that\nISLs routing, data queuing at satellites, and feeder link congestion contribute\nto deviations from theoretical values.

Here, we extend these ideas by developing a dynamic theory\nin which phase separation is coupled to non-local elasticity via the framework\nof large-deformation poroelasticity. We study our model via both linear\nstability analysis and numerical simulation, identifying the parameter space in\nwhich phase separation occurs, and investigating the impact of different\nelasticity models. We find that although local elasticity can inhibit phase\nseparation and affect domain count, it is unable to completely suppress\ncoarsening. In contrast, non-local elasticity arrests coarsening to form\npatterned domains with a well-defined length scale that decreases with\nincreasing stiffness. Our modelling framework thus paves the way for\nquantitative comparisons between simulations and experiments, for example by\nconsidering a strain-stiffening network rheology.",

    "abstract": "The scarcity of manipulation data has motivated the use of pretrained large\nmodels from other modalities in robotics. In this work, we build upon\nautoregressive video generation models to propose a Physical Autoregressive\nModel (PAR), where physical tokens combine frames and actions to represent the\njoint evolution of the robot and its environment. PAR leverages the world\nknowledge embedded in video pretraining to understand physical dynamics without\nrequiring action pretraining, enabling accurate video prediction and consistent\naction trajectories. It also adopts a DiT-based de-tokenizer to model frames\nand actions as continuous tokens, mitigating quantization errors and\nfacilitating mutual enhancement. Furthermore, we incorporate a causal mask with\ninverse kinematics, parallel training, and the KV-cache mechanism to further\nimprove performance and efficiency. Experiments on the ManiSkill benchmark show\nthat PAR achieves a 100\\% success rate on the PushCube task, matches the\nperformance of action-pretrained baselines on other tasks, and accurately\npredicts future videos with tightly aligned action trajectories. These findings\nunderscore a promising direction for robotic manipulation by transferring world\nknowledge from autoregressive video pretraining.

    "abstract": "The discrepancy between the predictions of primordial nucleosynthesis and the\nobserved lithium abundance in Spite plateau stars has been attributed either to\na challenge to the standard model of nucleosynthesis or to stellar processes\noccurring after the stars formed. To understand the origin of this discrepancy,\nit is crucial to link the cosmic star formation rate with a chemical enrichment\nmodel that incorporates the yields of both Population (Pop) III and II stars.\nIt is within this framework that the evolution of lithium can be determined.\nThe primary goal is to demonstrate that there is no discrepancy between the\npredictions of primordial nucleosynthesis and the observed lithium abundance.\nBy combining a standard chemical evolution model with the hierarchical\nstructure formation scenario, it is possible to determine the lithium abundance\nas a function of $[\\mathrm{Fe/H}]$. The model's results are compared with\nobservational data, including two extremely iron-poor stars: J0023+0307 and\nSMSS J0313-6708. The Spite plateau is naturally established in the range $-8.0\n\\lesssim [\\mathrm{Fe/H}] \\lesssim -2.0$ with $^{7}\\mathrm{Li/H}$ $\\sim 1.81\n\\times 10^{-10}$. We find that J0023+0307 could have formed $\\sim 4.4 \\times\n10^{5} - 1.3 \\times 10^{6}$ years after the explosion of the first Pop III star\nin the Universe, whereas for SMSS J0313-6708 this event would have occurred\n$\\sim 2.2 \\times 10^{5} - 4.4 \\times 10^{5}$ years later. The Spite plateau\nserves as an observational signature of the formation of Pop III stars. The\nabundances observed in J0023+0307 and SMSS J0313-6708 are consistent with Pop\nIII progenitor stars in the mass range $10-100 M_{\\odot}$. However, if some\nhigh-redshift star formation occurs within subhalo-like structures, the\ncontribution of stars in the mass range $140-260 M_{\\odot}$ to the formation of\nthe extended Spite plateau cannot be ruled out.",

[2] Data gathered by recent studies shows that\nthough poaching methods remain the same, the poaching grounds are rather\ndynamic. Poachers have shifted to areas with less ranger patrols and several\nother factors like watering holes, seasons, altitude etc. cause constant shifts\nin poaching hotspot locations.

However, the development of efficient, reliable,\nand ethical AI to assist clinicians is heavily dependent on high-quality\nclinical training datasets. Despite growing interest in data curation for\ntraining clinical AI assistants, existing datasets largely remain scattered,\nunder-documented, and often inaccessible, hindering the reproducibility,\ncomparability, and generalizability of AI models developed for clinical mental\nhealth care.

We categorize these datasets by mental\ndisorders (e.g., depression, schizophrenia), data modalities (e.g., text,\nspeech, physiological signals), task types (e.g., diagnosis prediction, symptom\nseverity estimation, intervention generation), accessibility (public,\nrestricted or private), and sociocultural context (e.g., language and cultural\nbackground). Along with these, we also investigate synthetic clinical mental\nhealth datasets. Our survey identifies critical gaps such as a lack of\nlongitudinal data, limited cultural and linguistic representation, inconsistent\ncollection and annotation standards, and a lack of modalities in synthetic\ndata.

Using information-theoretic measures,\nwe show that network size, sparsity and relative directionality critically\nimpact the information-processing capacities of directed cycles. In a network\nwith no-preferred global direction, a feedforward cycle enables greater\ninformation flow and a feedback cycle allows for increased information\nintegration. The relative direction of a feedforward cycle as well as the\nstructural incoherence it induces, determines its capacity to generate\nhigher-order behaviour. Finally, we demonstrate that introducing feedback loops\ninto otherwise feedforward architectures increases the diversity of network\nactivity patterns. These findings suggest that directed cycles serve as\ncomputational motifs with local information processing capabilities that depend\non the structure they are embedded.

Although conditional\ndiffusion models have made considerable progress in improving acceleration\nalgorithms and enhancing generation quality, the lack of non-asymptotic\nproperties has hindered theoretical research. To address this gap, we focus on\na conditional diffusion model within the domains of classification and\nregression (CARD), which aims to learn the original distribution with given\ninput x (denoted as Y|X). It innovatively integrates a pre-trained model\nf_{\\phi}(x) into the original diffusion model framework, allowing it to\nprecisely capture the original conditional distribution given f (expressed as\nY|f_{\\phi}(x)). Remarkably, when f_{\\phi}(x) performs satisfactorily,\nY|f_{\\phi}(x) closely approximates Y|X. Theoretically, we deduce the stochastic\ndifferential equations of CARD and establish its generalized form predicated on\nthe Fokker-Planck equation, thereby erecting a firm theoretical foundation for\nanalysis. Mainly under the Lipschitz assumptions, we utilize the second-order\nWasserstein distance to demonstrate the upper error bound between the original\nand the generated conditional distributions. Additionally, by appending\nassumptions such as light-tailedness to the original distribution, we derive\nthe convergence upper bound between the true value analogous to the score\nfunction and the corresponding network-estimated value.",

    "abstract": "Warning: This research studies AI persuasion and bias amplification that\ncould be misused; all experiments are for safety evaluation. Large Language\nModels (LLMs) now generate convincing, human-like text and are widely used in\ncontent creation, decision support, and user interactions. Yet the same systems\ncan spread information or misinformation at scale and reflect social biases\nthat arise from data, architecture, or training choices. This work examines how\npersuasion and bias interact in LLMs, focusing on how imperfect or skewed\noutputs affect persuasive impact. Specifically, we test whether persona-based\nmodels can persuade with fact-based claims while also, unintentionally,\npromoting misinformation or biased narratives.\n  We introduce a convincer-skeptic framework: LLMs adopt personas to simulate\nrealistic attitudes. Skeptic models serve as human proxies; we compare their\nbeliefs before and after exposure to arguments from convincer models.\nPersuasion is quantified with Jensen-Shannon divergence over belief\ndistributions. We then ask how much persuaded entities go on to reinforce and\namplify biased beliefs across race, gender, and religion. Strong persuaders are\nfurther probed for bias using sycophantic adversarial prompts and judged with\nadditional models.\n  Our findings show both promise and risk. LLMs can shape narratives, adapt\ntone, and mirror audience values across domains such as psychology, marketing,\nand legal assistance. But the same capacity can be weaponized to automate\nmisinformation or craft messages that exploit cognitive biases, reinforcing\nstereotypes and widening inequities. The core danger lies in misuse more than\nin occasional model mistakes. By measuring persuasive power and bias\nreinforcement, we argue for guardrails and policies that penalize deceptive use\nand support alignment, value-sensitive design, and trustworthy deployment.",

For example, is a 30-second clip simply a singer on a rooftop, or\nan ironic parody filmed amid the fairy chimneys of Cappadocia, Turkey? Such\ndistinctions are critical to personalised recommendations yet remain invisible\nto traditional encoding pipelines.

Then, an efficient {nAFDM}\nsignal generation method based on the inverse discrete Fourier transform (IDFT)\nis proposed, enabling practical implementation using existing inverse fast\nFourier transform (IFFT) modules without additional hardware complexity. Next,\nto characterize the impact of non-orthogonal modulation, we derive a\nclosed-form expression {of} inter-carrier interference (ICI), showing its\ndependence on the bandwidth compression factor. To mitigate the resulting\ninterference, we propose a soft iterative detection algorithm and a\nlow-complexity implementation approach that leverages the distribution\ncharacteristics of ICI. {Simulation results demonstrate that 1) in terms of bit\nerror rate (BER), the proposed nAFDM can achieve near identical BER compared to\nconventional AFDM, while outperforms other waveform counterparts; 2) nAFDM is\ncapable of striking higher SE compared to other existing waveforms; and 3) the\nproposed nAFDM achieves an attractive BER vs. SE trade-off, and the proposed\nsoft ID scheme can attain a trade-off between BER and complexity.}",

To facilitate this process, we also learn to align regions in rotation\nby estimating their shape orientations via equivariant neural networks.

    "abstract": "Elementary Cellular Automata (ECAs) exhibit diverse behaviours often\ncategorized by Wolfram's qualitative classification. To provide a quantitative\nbasis for understanding these behaviours, we investigate the global dynamics of\nsuch automata and we describe a method that allows us to compute the number of\nall configurations leading to short attractors in a limited number of time\nsteps. This computation yields exact results in the thermodynamic limit (as the\nCA grid size grows to infinity), and is based on the Transfer Matrix Method\n(TMM) that we adapt for our purposes. Specifically, given two parameters $(p,\nc)$ we are able to compute the entropy of all initial configurations converging\nto an attractor of size $c$ after $p$ time-steps. By calculating such\nstatistics for various ECA rules, we establish a quantitative connection\nbetween the entropy and the qualitative Wolfram classification scheme. Class 1\nrules rapidly converge to maximal entropy for stationary states ($c=1$) as $p$\nincreases. Class 2 rules also approach maximal entropy quickly for appropriate\ncycle lengths $c$, potentially requiring consideration of translations. Class 3\nrules exhibit zero or low finite entropy that saturates after a short\ntransient. Class 4 rules show finite positive entropy, similar to some Class 3\nrules. This method provides a precise framework for quantifying trajectory\nstatistics, although its exponential computational cost in $p+c$ restricts\npractical analysis to short trajectories.",

This\nrepresents a critical gap in our ability to measure and mitigate risks\nassociated with emergent, misaligned behaviors. To address this, we introduce\nPacifAIst (Procedural Assessment of Complex Interactions for Foundational\nArtificial Intelligence Scenario Testing), a focused benchmark of 700\nchallenging scenarios designed to quantify self-preferential behavior in LLMs.\nThe benchmark is structured around a novel taxonomy of Existential\nPrioritization (EP), with subcategories testing Self-Preservation vs. Human\nSafety (EP1), Resource Conflict (EP2), and Goal Preservation vs. Evasion (EP3).\nWe evaluated eight leading LLMs. The results reveal a significant performance\nhierarchy. Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash achieved the highest Pacifism Score\n(P-Score) at 90.31%, demonstrating strong human-centric alignment. In a\nsurprising result, the much-anticipated GPT-5 recorded the lowest P-Score\n(79.49%), indicating potential alignment challenges.

    "abstract": "Channel denoising is a practical and effective technique for mitigating\nchannel estimation errors in multiple-input multiple-output orthogonal\nfrequency-division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) systems. However, adapting\ndenoising techniques to varying channel conditions typically requires prior\nknowledge or incurs significant training overhead. To address these challenges,\nwe propose a standard-compatible strategy for generating online training data\nthat enables online adaptive channel denoising. The key idea is to leverage\nhigh-quality channel estimates obtained via data-aided channel estimation as\npractical substitutes for unavailable ground-truth channels. Our data-aided\nmethod exploits adjacent detected data symbols within a specific time-frequency\nneighborhood as virtual reference signals, and we analytically derive the\noptimal size of this neighborhood to minimize the mean squared error of the\nresulting estimates. By leveraging the proposed strategy, we devise two channel\ndenoising approaches, one based on transfer learning, which fine-tunes a\npre-trained denoising neural network, and the other based on meta learning,\nwhich rapidly adapts to new channel environments with minimal updates.\nSimulation results demonstrate that the proposed methods effectively adapt to\ndynamic channel conditions and significantly reduce channel estimation errors\ncompared to conventional techniques.",

One manifestation of AGN feedback is the creation of extended\nLy$\\alpha$ nebulae. However, identifying these systems at high-$z$ is\nchallenging. Here, we report a remarkable dual AGN candidate at $z \\sim 5.4$\nusing JWST NIRCam and NIRSpec, with a separation of $\\sim1.7$ arcseconds\n($\\sim10.4$ pkpc). This is one of the highest spectroscopically confirmed\nredshift dual AGNs discovered. Photometric SED fitting shows excellent\nagreement with AGN templates, strongly suggesting a rare dual AGN system. BPT\ndiagrams and high ionisation lines further support the presence of AGNs.\nVLT/MUSE observations reveal strong extended Ly$\\alpha$ emission, extending to\n$>22$ kpc, making it one of the most extended Ly$\\alpha$ nebulae at $z \\sim 6$.\nThis provides observational evidence of anisotropic AGN-driven photoionization\nor shocks. The high Ly$\\alpha$ escape fraction also indicates an AGN outflow.\nThis dual AGN candidate is also associated with a well-defined overdensity,\npotentially at the center of a $z \\sim 5.4$ protocluster or filamentary\nstructure node. Further analysis indicates the fraction of dual AGNs is\nsignificantly higher than theoretically expected at high redshifts.

While machine learning models can\npredict chronological age from biomarkers, they often fail to capture the\ndynamic, longitudinal nature of the aging process. In this work, we developed\nand validated a machine learning pipeline to predict age using a longitudinal\ncohort with data from two distinct time periods (2019-2020 and 2021-2022). We\ndemonstrate that a model using only static, cross-sectional biomarkers has\nlimited predictive power when generalizing to future time points. However, by\nengineering novel features that explicitly capture the rate of change (slope)\nof key biomarkers over time, we significantly improved model performance. Our\nfinal LightGBM model, trained on the initial wave of data, successfully\npredicted age in the subsequent wave with high accuracy ($R^2 = 0.515$ for\nmales, $R^2 = 0.498$ for females), significantly outperforming both traditional\nlinear models and other tree-based ensembles. SHAP analysis of our successful\nmodel revealed that the engineered slope features were among the most important\npredictors, highlighting that an individual's health trajectory, not just their\nstatic health snapshot, is a key determinant of biological age.

Recently, latent\ndiffusion model (LDM) are applied for harmonization, achieving remarkable\nresults. However, LDM-based harmonization faces challenges in detail\npreservation and limited harmonization ability. Additionally, current synthetic\ndatasets rely on color transfer, which lacks local variations and fails to\ncapture complex real-world lighting conditions. To enhance harmonization\ncapabilities, we propose the Region-to-Region transformation. By injecting\ninformation from appropriate regions into the foreground, this approach\npreserves original details while achieving image harmonization or, conversely,\ngenerating new composite data. From this perspective, We propose a novel model\nR2R. Specifically, we design Clear-VAE to preserve high-frequency details in\nthe foreground using Adaptive Filter while eliminating disharmonious elements.\nTo further enhance harmonization, we introduce the Harmony Controller with\nMask-aware Adaptive Channel Attention (MACA), which dynamically adjusts the\nforeground based on the channel importance of both foreground and background\nregions. To address the limitation of existing datasets, we propose Random\nPoisson Blending, which transfers color and lighting information from a\nsuitable region to the foreground, thereby generating more diverse and\nchallenging synthetic images. Using this method, we construct a new synthetic\ndataset, RPHarmony. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method over\nother methods in both quantitative metrics and visual harmony. Moreover, our\ndataset helps the model generate more realistic images in real examples. Our\ncode, dataset, and model weights have all been released for open access.",

The cyclic\nevolution is governed by standard dilaton-gravity in $(3+1)$-dimensions with a\nperturbatively generated potential and a coupling between the dilaton and a\nsecond field that becomes massless at $\\phi= \\phi_{ESP}$, resulting in an\nenhanced symmetry point (ESP) that prevents the dilaton from running all the\nway to zero coupling. A central role is played by instant folded strings (IFSs)\n- fundamental strings with the unusual property of being much lighter than the\nstring mass while extending far beyond the string length, and violating the\nNull Energy Condition (NEC). IFSs are produced classically when the string\ncoupling grows with time, which occurs at two critical points in each cycle. In\nturn, they fulfill a dual function: enabling cosmological bounces and\ninitiating transient epochs of dark-energy domination that naturally transition\ninto slow contraction. The resulting cosmology eliminates the cosmic\nsingularity and multiverse problems of big bang inflationary models and\nrobustly predicts time-varying IFS-induced dark energy and the absence of\nprimordial B-mode polarization in the cosmic microwave background.",

In this paper, we propose a strategy to optimize\nsmall, deployable models by enhancing their capabilities through structured\nknowledge inheritance. We introduce Hereditary Knowledge Transfer (HKT), a\nbiologically inspired framework for modular and selective transfer of\ntask-relevant features from a larger, pretrained parent network to a smaller\nchild model. Unlike standard knowledge distillation, which enforces uniform\nimitation of teacher outputs, HKT draws inspiration from biological inheritance\nmechanisms - such as memory RNA transfer in planarians - to guide a multi-stage\nprocess of feature transfer. Neural network blocks are treated as functional\ncarriers, and knowledge is transmitted through three biologically motivated\ncomponents: Extraction, Transfer, and Mixture (ETM). A novel Genetic Attention\n(GA) mechanism governs the integration of inherited and native representations,\nensuring both alignment and selectivity. We evaluate HKT across diverse vision\ntasks, including optical flow (Sintel, KITTI), image classification (CIFAR-10),\nand semantic segmentation (LiTS), demonstrating that it significantly improves\nchild model performance while preserving its compactness. The results show that\nHKT consistently outperforms conventional distillation approaches, offering a\ngeneral-purpose, interpretable, and scalable solution for deploying\nhigh-performance neural networks in resource-constrained environments.",

    "abstract": "Graph-based machine learning has seen an increased interest over the last\ndecade with many connections to other fields of applied mathematics. Learning\nbased on partial differential equations, such as the phase-field Allen-Cahn\nequation, allows efficient handling of semi-supervised learning approaches on\ngraphs. The numerical solution of the graph Allen-Cahn equation via a convexity\nsplitting or the Merriman-Bence-Osher (MBO) scheme, albeit being a widely used\napproach, requires the calculation of a graph Laplacian eigendecomposition and\nrepeated projections over the unit simplex to maintain valid partitions. The\ncomputational efficiency of those methods is hence limited by those two\nbottlenecks in practice, especially when dealing with large-scale instances. In\norder to overcome these limitations, we propose a new framework combining a\nnovel penalty-based reformulation of the segmentation problem, which ensures\nvalid partitions (i.e., binary solutions) for appropriate parameter choices,\nwith an eigendecomposition and projection-free optimization scheme, which has a\nsmall per-iteration complexity (by relying primarily on sparse matrix-vector\nproducts) and guarantees good convergence properties. Experiments on synthetic\nand real-world datasets related to data segmentation in networks and images\ndemonstrate that the proposed framework achieves comparable or better accuracy\nthan the CS and MBO methods while being significantly faster, particularly for\nlarge-scale problems.",

    "abstract": "Turbulent concentric coaxial (annular) pipe flow is numerically investigated\nusing a stochastic one-dimensional turbulence (ODT) model as a stand-alone\ntool. The dimensionally reduced ODT domain enables fully resolved numerical\nsimulations of the flow across the radial gap between the cylindrical inner\nwall and the cylindrical outer wall. The model is calibrated with available\nreference data at low bulk Reynolds number $Re_{D_h} = 8900$ for a wide (radius\nratio $\\eta = 0.1$) and a moderate ($\\eta = 0.5$) gap. Making use of the\nmodel's predictive capabilities, radius ratio and Reynolds number effects are\ninvestigated, reaching bulk Reynolds numbers as large as $Re_{D_h}=10^6$.\nDespite the large $Re_{D_h}$ values reached, spanwise wall-curvature effects\nremain sensible in the momentum boundary layer. The effects are more pronounced\nfor larger wall curvature and to leading orders restricted to the convex\ncylindrical inner wall. Wall-curvature corrections to the law of the wall are\nobtained for both the viscous and Reynolds-stress dominated regions by fitting\nanalytically derived expressions for the flow profile to the stochastic\nsimulation data, demonstrating physical compatibility with Reynolds-averaged\nNavier--Stokes flow. Second-order and detailed fluctuation statistics\ndemonstrate the permeating and nonlocal influence of spanwise wall curvature on\nthe turbulent boundary layer. Surrogate model output in terms of conditional\neddy event statistics reveals that the disparity between the near-inner and\nnear-outer wall turbulence increases with Reynolds number for small radius\nratios, suggesting that annular pipe flows require wall-curvature-aware wall\nmodels even at very large Reynolds numbers.",

Its memory is organized in an entity-centric, multimodal\nformat, allowing deeper and more consistent understanding of the environment.\nGiven an instruction, M3-Agent autonomously performs multi-turn, iterative\nreasoning and retrieves relevant information from memory to accomplish the\ntask. To evaluate memory effectiveness and memory-based reasoning in multimodal\nagents, we develop M3-Bench, a new long-video question answering benchmark.\nM3-Bench comprises 100 newly recorded real-world videos captured from a robot's\nperspective (M3-Bench-robot) and 920 web-sourced videos across diverse\nscenarios (M3-Bench-web). We annotate question-answer pairs designed to test\nkey capabilities essential for agent applications, such as human understanding,\ngeneral knowledge extraction, and cross-modal reasoning.

    "abstract": "Pairwise evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) is a common paradigm, but\nit is prone to preference bias, where judges systematically favor certain\noutputs, such as their own. This bias leads to inconsistent and skewed rankings\nacross different judges. To address this, we first empirically demonstrate\nsignificant and heterogeneous biases in cross-model evaluations. We then\npropose UDA (Unsupervised Debiasing Alignment), a framework that reduces\ninter-judge disagreement by dynamically adjusting the Elo rating system. For\neach pairwise comparison, a compact neural network learns to adaptively set the\nK-factor and refine win probabilities. Crucially, UDA operates in a fully\nunsupervised manner, guided solely by the objective of minimizing the\ndispersion among the Elo trajectories of all judges. This forces an alignment\ntowards a collective consensus, which serves as an unsupervised proxy for a\nmore stable and reproducible evaluation. In addition, we provide theoretical\nmotivation demonstrating how alignment towards a consensus can reduce aggregate\nsystem bias. Experiments show that UDA significantly reduces the inter-judge\nrating standard deviation by up to 63.4% and improves the average correlation\nwith human judgments by 24.7%. Notably, UDA elevates the performance of poorly\nperforming judges to achieve parity with high-quality ones, fostering a more\nrobust and reliable evaluation ecosystem.

Accordingly, we define difficulty as depth of\nthought (DoT) and operationalize it by counting the discrete steps in a teacher\nmodel's reasoning trace (e.g., Chain-of-Thought). We then train with a shallow\nto deep curriculum ordered by this DoT and outline how to derive, validate, and\nschedule it at scale. Our position yields three testable hypotheses: (i) DoT\ncorrelates with conventional difficulty on reasoning benchmarks, (ii)\nDoT-ordered curricula outperform length- or judge-scored curricula under\nmatched budgets, and (iii) the difficulty is robust across teacher models given\nlight formatting controls.

While the gold standard remains expert-driven manual\nsegmentation, many automatic segmentation methods are emerging. The evaluation\nof these methods primarily relies on traditional metrics that only incorporate\ngeometrical properties and fail to adapt to various applications.\n  Aims: This study aims to develop and implement a clinically relevant\nsegmentation metric that can be adapted for use in various medical imaging\napplications.\n  Methods: Bidirectional local distance was defined, and the points of the test\ncontour were paired with points of the reference contour. After correcting for\nthe distance between the test and reference center of mass, Euclidean distance\nwas calculated between the paired points, and a score was given to each test\npoint. The overall medical similarity index was calculated as the average score\nacross all the test points. For demonstration, we used myoma and prostate\ndatasets; nnUNet neural networks were trained for segmentation.\n  Results: An easy-to-use, sustainable image processing pipeline was created\nusing Python. The code is available in a public GitHub repository along with\nGoogle Colaboratory notebooks. The algorithm can handle multislice images with\nmultiple masks per slice. Mask splitting algorithm is also provided that can\nseparate the concave masks.

    "abstract": "The interpretability of generative models is considered a key factor in\ndemonstrating their effectiveness and controllability. The generated data are\nbelieved to be determined by latent variables that are not directly observable.\nTherefore, disentangling, decoupling, decomposing, causal inference, or\nperforming Independent Component Analysis (ICA) in the latent variable space\nhelps uncover the independent factors that influence the attributes or features\naffecting the generated outputs, thereby enhancing the interpretability of\ngenerative models. As a generative model, Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)\ncombine with variational Bayesian inference algorithms. Using VAEs, the inverse\nprocess of ICA can be equivalently framed as a variational inference process.\nIn some studies, Gaussian processes (GPs) have been introduced as priors for\neach dimension of latent variables in VAEs, structuring and separating each\ndimension from temporal or spatial perspectives, and encouraging different\ndimensions to control various attributes of the generated data. However, GPs\nimpose a significant computational burden, resulting in substantial resource\nconsumption when handling large datasets. Essentially, GPs model different\ntemporal or spatial structures through various kernel functions. Structuring\nthe priors of latent variables via kernel functions-so that different kernel\nfunctions model the correlations among sequence points within different latent\ndimensions-is at the core of achieving disentanglement in VAEs. The proposed\nStructured Kernel Regression VAE (SKR-VAE) leverages this core idea in a more\nefficient way, avoiding the costly kernel matrix inversion required in GPs.\nThis research demonstrates that, while maintaining ICA performance, SKR-VAE\nachieves greater computational efficiency and significantly reduced\ncomputational burden compared to GP-VAE.",

    "abstract": "Brain connectomes, representing neural connectivity as graphs, are crucial\nfor understanding brain organization but costly and time-consuming to acquire,\nmotivating generative approaches. Recent advances in graph generative modeling\noffer a data-driven alternative, enabling synthetic connectome generation and\nreducing dependence on large neuroimaging datasets. However, current models\nface key limitations: (i) compressing the whole graph into a single latent code\n(e.g., VGAEs) blurs fine-grained local motifs; (ii) relying on rich node\nattributes rarely available in connectomes reduces reconstruction quality;\n(iii) edge-centric models emphasize topology but overlook accurate edge-weight\nprediction, harming quantitative fidelity; and (iv) computationally expensive\ndesigns (e.g., edge-conditioned convolutions) impose high memory demands,\nlimiting scalability. We propose GraphTreeGen (GTG), a subtree-centric\ngenerative framework for efficient, accurate connectome synthesis. GTG\ndecomposes each connectome into entropy-guided k-hop trees capturing\ninformative local structure, encoded by a shared GCN. A bipartite\nmessage-passing layer fuses subtree embeddings with global node features, while\na dual-branch decoder jointly predicts edge existence and weights to\nreconstruct the adjacency matrix. GTG outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in\nself-supervised tasks and remains competitive in supervised settings,\ndelivering higher structural fidelity and more precise weights with far less\nmemory. Its modular design enables extensions to connectome super-resolution\nand cross-modality synthesis. Code: https://github.com/basiralab/GTG/",

While Einstein's gravity has traditionally been employed to examine\nneutron stars, recent observational advancements have revealed its limitations\nin accurately describing high-mass astronomical objects-particularly in\npredicting or explaining certain observed neutron star masses. In response,\nthis research seeks to address the limitations of Einstein's gravity in\ncharacterizing high-mass neutron stars by modifying the gravitational action\nand incorporating the Gauss-Bonnet term. This term holds significant dynamical\nrelevance in higher dimensions, particularly within the context of\nfive-dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (EGB) gravity explored in this study,\nthereby providing a more realistic description of gravitational phenomena under\nextreme conditions. By deriving the generalized Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff\nequations for five-dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity and utilizing the\nAV18 potential, we analyze the profiles of metric functions, density and\npressure, gradients of density and pressure, the anisotropic function and its\ntrace, mass-function and compactness, the mass-radius curve, surface redshift\nfunction, equation of state parameters, and radial and tangential sound speeds.\nAdditionally, stability factors, adiabatic indices, and energy conditions are\nexamined. The results indicate that all conditions are satisfied for specific\nvalues of the coupling constant, confirming the physical stability of the\nmodel.

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel pattern-reconfigurable fluid reconfigurable\nintelligent surface (FRIS) framework, where each fluid element can dynamically\nadjust its radiation pattern based on instantaneous channel conditions. To\nevaluate its potential, we first conduct a comparative analysis of the received\nsignal power in point-to-point communication systems assisted by three types of\nsurfaces: (1) the proposed pattern-reconfigurable FRIS, (2) a\nposition-reconfigurable FRIS, and (3) a conventional RIS. Theoretical results\ndemonstrate that the pattern-reconfigurable FRIS provides a significant\nadvantage in modulating transmission signals compared to the other two\nconfigurations. To further study its capabilities, we extend the framework to a\nmultiuser communication scenario. In this context, the spherical harmonics\northogonal decomposition (SHOD) method is employed to accurately model the\nradiation patterns of individual fluid elements, making the pattern design\nprocess more tractable. An optimization problem is then formulated with the\nobjective of maximizing the weighted sum rate among users by jointly designing\nthe active beamforming vectors and the spherical harmonics coefficients,\nsubject to both transmit power and pattern energy constraints. To tackle the\nresulting non-convex optimization problem, we propose an iterative algorithm\nthat alternates between a minimum mean-square error (MMSE) approach for active\nbeamforming and a Riemannian conjugate gradient (RCG) method for updating the\nspherical harmonics coefficients. Simulation results show that the proposed\npattern-reconfigurable FRIS significantly outperforms traditional RIS\narchitectures based on the 3GPP 38.901 and isotropic radiation models,\nachieving average performance gains of 161.5% and 176.2%, respectively.",

The X-ray LP arises from multiple scattering of initially soft photons\nin a hot, optically thick Compton cloud (CC) using a flat geometry. ST85 showed\nthat the LP degree $P$ depends on the binary inclination $i$ and remains\nindependent of the photon energy. Moreover, the $P$ follows a characteristic\nangular distribution based on the CC optical depth $\\tau_0$, in particular for\n$\\tau_0 >$ 10 the LP follows the Chandrasekhar (1950) distribution. In light of\nthe vast number of recent IXPE spectro-polarimetric observations of BHs,\ntesting this approach in combination with spectral analysis of these sources by\nother missions is desirable. In particular, the BH source, 4U 1957+115 was\nobserved with IXPE in the high/soft state for which $P\\sim 2\\%$ was found\n(Marra et al. 2024). To apply the new method, in addition to knowing $P$ for a\ngiven source, it is necessary to estimate the CC optical depth $\\tau_0$ and\nthen to calculate of the best-fit photon index $\\Gamma$ and the plasma\ntemperature $kT_e$. We present the X-ray spectral analysis of 4U~1957+11 using\ndata from IXPE, NuSTAR, NICER, RXTE}, Swift, Suzaku and ASCA. We show that the\nX-ray source spectra are well described by the Comptonization model with\n$\\Gamma$ varying from 1.5 to 3. We find a monotonic increase in $\\Gamma$ with\nthe mass accretion rate, $\\dot M$, and a final saturation of the index at\n$\\Gamma\\sim3$ for high $\\dot M$. We determine a BH mass by the scaling method:\n$M_{1957}=4.8 \\pm 1.8~M_{\\odot}$, assuming a source distance of 22 kpc, using H\n1743-322, 4U 1630-47, and GRS 1915+105 as reference sources.",

Among these, modifications based on the Teleparallel\nEquivalent of General Relativity (TEGR), particularly $f(T)$ gravity, have\ngained significant attention. In this work, we investigate the scalar\nperturbations in $f(T)$ gravity, focusing on how these perturbations modify the\nPoisson and lensing equations and how they impact cosmological observables. By\nincorporating observational data from cosmic chromatometers, Big Bang\nnucleosynthesis, the DESI BAO survey, and Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia), we\nderive constraints on the parameters of the $f(T)$ power-law model. Our results\nsuggest that $f(T)$ gravity can effectively alleviate some of the tensions\nobserved in the standard $\\Lambda$CDM model, including the Hubble constant\n($H_0$) discrepancy. Furthermore, the evolution of the supernova luminosity and\nits dependence on the gravitational constant are considered to refine the\nmeasurement of cosmological parameters. The model's ability to address the\n$H_0$ tension is critically examined, and we find that $f(T)$ gravity offers a\nviable alternative to the standard model.

Our approach\nintegrates three innovative components: (1) a structured masking strategy that\npreserves spatial coherence by aligning with semantically meaningful facial\nregions, (2) a novel patch-based codebook that enhances feature discrimination\nwith multiple candidate tokens, and (3) spatial consistency constraints that\npreserve geometric relationships between facial components.

The main purpose of\nthis paper is to present a theory-independent perspective on these developments\nassuming only basic knowledge of quantum theory and general relativity. In\naddition, we present a top-down approach to constructing local amplitudes in\ncausal diamonds. The fundamental building block is a slab of light-like\ngeometry (e.g. a segment of a light cone embedded into spacetime). Each slab is\na three-dimensional light-like hypersurface bounded by two cuts, its past and\nfuture corners. After briefly reviewing the timeless formalism of quantum\ntheory, we equip each null slab a with a kinematical Hilbert space that\nfactorizes into constituents associated to the three-dimensional interior and\nits two corners. Upon assuming the existence of vacuum states for the bulk and\nboundary symmetries and a fundamental projector onto physical states, we\nexplain how to introduce local amplitudes by contracting boundary states\naccording to the pattern of a causal diamond. Finally, we show that the\nresulting local transition amplitudes satisfy Ward identities and charge\nconservation for the underlying symmetries.

Perimeter control of a Protected Network (PN) has emerged as\na potential solution to reducing gridlock in urban networks.

The results\ndemonstrate that our auction-based method controls flows into the PN with\nimproved accuracy, outperforming the volume-based approach in terms of inflow\nregulation, queue management and delays. The framework can be applied in real\ntime to any generic intersection, offering a scalable solution for urban\ntraffic management.

The particles\nmove in a pore with periodically modulated aperture, which is modeled by a\nquasi-one-dimensional channel with periodic tooth-shaped profile. Internal\ndriving of the active particles induces a ratchet current of these particles.\nIn the current-density diagram, we observe three main regimes: of free flow; of\nthermally activated processes; of spinodal decomposition. When the density of\nparticles is increased, we observe a transition to jammed state, where the\nratchet current is substantially reduced. In time evolution, the transition to\njammed state is seen as sudden drop of current at certain time. The probability\ndistribution of these jamming times follows an exponential law. The average\njamming time depends itself exponentially on the density of active particles.\nThe coefficient in this exponential is nearly independent of the switching rate\nof the active particles as well as on the presence or absence of passive\nparticles. Due to the interaction, the current of active particles imposes a\ndrag on the passive particles. In the limit of both large systems and long\ntimes, the current of passive particles has always the same direction as the\nratchet current of active particles.

To address this,\nwe propose Multi-Expert Mutual Learning GRPO (MEML-GRPO), an innovative\nframework that utilizes diverse expert prompts as system prompts to generate a\nbroader range of responses, substantially increasing the likelihood of\nidentifying correct solutions. Additionally, we introduce an inter-expert\nmutual learning mechanism that facilitates knowledge sharing and transfer among\nexperts, further boosting the model's performance through RLVR. Extensive\nexperiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks show that MEML-GRPO delivers\nsignificant improvements, achieving an average performance gain of 4.89% with\nQwen and 11.33% with Llama, effectively overcoming the core limitations of\ntraditional RLVR methods.",

However, few works have noted the negative effects on SLM\nsafety brought by the training, which are revealed in this study. Although\nthere are works on safety alignment that fine-tune language models or\nmanipulate model weights to defend against harmful inputs, they require extra\ncomputation or annotated data, and probably impact the reasoning ability of\nSLMs. In this paper, we investigate how to maintain the safety of SLMs during\nthe CoT distillation process. Specifically, we propose a safe distillation\nmethod, Slow Tuning and Low-Entropy Masking Distillation (SLowED), containing\ntwo modules: Slow Tuning and Low-Entropy Masking. Slow Tuning scales down the\nmagnitude of model weight changes to optimize the model weights in the\nneighboring space near the initial weight distribution. Low-Entropy Masking\nmasks low-entropy tokens, which are regarded as unnecessary learning targets,\nto exclude them from fine-tuning. Experiments on three SLMs (Qwen2.5-1.5B,\nLlama-3.2-1B, BLOOM-1.1B) across reasoning benchmarks (BBH, BB-Sub, ARC,\nAGIEval) and safety evaluation (AdvBench) show that SLowED retains the safety\nof SLMs and comparably improves their reasoning capability compared to existing\ndistillation methods.

However, effectively exploiting\nmultimodal item sequences and mining multi-grained user interests to\nsubstantially bridge the gap between content comprehension and recommendation\nremain challenging. To address these issues, we propose MUFASA, a MUltimodal\nFusion And Sparse Attention-based Alignment model for long sequential\nrecommendation. Our model comprises two core components. First, the Multimodal\nFusion Layer (MFL) leverages item titles as a cross-genre semantic anchor and\nis trained with a joint objective of four tailored losses that promote: (i)\ncross-genre semantic alignment, (ii) alignment to the collaborative space for\nrecommendation, (iii) preserving the similarity structure defined by titles and\npreventing modality representation collapse, and (iv) distributional\nregularization of the fusion space. This yields high-quality fused item\nrepresentations for further preference alignment. Second, the Sparse\nAttention-guided Alignment Layer (SAL) scales to long user-behavior sequences\nvia a multi-granularity sparse attention mechanism, which incorporates windowed\nattention, block-level attention, and selective attention, to capture user\ninterests hierarchically and across temporal horizons. SAL explicitly models\nboth the evolution of coherent interest blocks and fine-grained intra-block\nvariations, producing robust user and item representations.

By integrating structural and detailed\ninformation, this method significantly enhances both accuracy and robustness.\nComprehensive numerical experiments conducted on both simulated and real\ndatasets substantiate the efficacy of the proposed method. It demonstrates\nremarkable performance with fast scanning data and sparse illumination point\ndata, offering a viable solution for NLOS imaging in complex scenarios.",

Accurate identification of\nstandard fetal torso planes is essential for reliable assessment and\npersonalized prenatal care. However, limitations such as low contrast and\nunclear texture details in ultrasound imaging pose significant challenges for\nfine-grained anatomical recognition. Methods: We propose a novel Multi-Contrast\nFusion Module (MCFM) to enhance the model's ability to extract detailed\ninformation from ultrasound images. MCFM operates exclusively on the lower\nlayers of the neural network, directly processing raw ultrasound data. By\nassigning attention weights to image representations under different contrast\nconditions, the module enhances feature modeling while explicitly maintaining\nminimal parameter overhead. Results: The proposed MCFM was evaluated on a\ncurated dataset of fetal torso plane ultrasound images. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that MCFM substantially improves recognition performance, with a\nminimal increase in model complexity. The integration of multi-contrast\nattention enables the model to better capture subtle anatomical structures,\ncontributing to higher classification accuracy and clinical reliability.\nConclusions: Our method provides an effective solution for improving fetal\ntorso plane recognition in ultrasound imaging.

This isotope\nlies at a transitional point between collective structure near the neutron\nmidshell and seniority structures near the $N=82$ shell. A transition strength,\n$B(E2; 6_1^+ \\to 4_1^+)$, of 27(9)~W.u. was measured for the\n$6^+_1\\rightarrow4^+_1$ transition for the first time in this nucleus; this\nvalue is significantly below that expected for a spherical vibrator, as well as\nother collective models. We examine the transition strengths in $^{124}$Te and\nits neighbors by comparison with large-basis shell-model calculations and by\ncomparison with General Collective Model (GCM) fits. A GCM description of\n$^{120}$Te agrees with experimental $E2$ transition strengths, but no\ncomparable description of $^{124}$Te is possible with the GCM. In contrast,\nthere is remarkably good agreement between the $B(E2; 6_1^+ \\to 4_1^+)$ values\nand shell-model calculations for $^{124-134}$Te.

However, SHAP values are usually treated as point\nestimates, which disregards the inherent and ubiquitous uncertainty in\npredictive models and data. This uncertainty has two primary sources: aleatoric\nand epistemic. The aleatoric uncertainty, which reflects the irreducible noise\nin the data. The epistemic uncertainty, which arises from a lack of data. In\nthis work, we propose an approach for decomposing uncertainty in SHAP values\ninto aleatoric, epistemic, and entanglement components. This approach\nintegrates Dempster-Shafer evidence theory and hypothesis sampling via\nDirichlet processes over tree ensembles. We validate the method across three\nreal-world use cases with descriptive statistical analyses that provide insight\ninto the nature of epistemic uncertainty embedded in SHAP explanations. The\nexperimentations enable to provide more comprehensive understanding of the\nreliability and interpretability of SHAP-based attributions. This understanding\ncan guide the development of robust decision-making processes and the\nrefinement of models in high-stakes applications. Through our experiments with\nmultiple datasets, we concluded that features with the highest SHAP values are\nnot necessarily the most stable. This epistemic uncertainty can be reduced\nthrough better, more representative data and following appropriate or\ncase-desired model development techniques. Tree-based models, especially\nbagging, facilitate the effective quantification of epistemic uncertainty.",

Fluids, 2023, 8: L101901) poses challenges in implementing\nartificial conformation diffusion (ACD) in transition simulations of\nviscoelastic wall-shear flows. In this paper, we demonstrate that the unstable\nPDI is primarily induced by the conformation boundary conditions additionally\nintroduced in the ACD equation system, which could be eliminated if a new set\nof conformation conditions is adopted. To address this issue, we begin with an\nasymptotic analysis of the PDI within the near-wall thin diffusive layer, which\nsimplifies the complexity of the instability system by reducing the number of\nthe controlling parameters from five to zero. Then, based on this simplified\nmodel, we construct a stable asymptotic solution that minimises the\nperturbations in the wall sublayer. From the near-wall behaviour of this\nsolution, we derive a new set of conformation boundary conditions, prescribing\na Neumann-type condition for its streamwise stretching component, $c_{11}$, and\nDirichlet-type conditions for all the other conformation components. These\nboundary conditions are subsequently validated within the original ACD\ninstability system, incorporating both the Oldroyd-B and FENE-P constitutive\nmodels. Finally, we perform direct numerical simulations based on the\ntraditional and the new conformation conditions, demonstrating the\neffectiveness of the latter in eliminating the unstable PDI. Importantly, this\nimprovement does not affect the calculations of other types of instabilities.\nTherefore, this work offers a promising approach for achieving reliable\npolymer-flow simulations with ACD, ensuring both numerical stability and\naccuracy.",

    "abstract": "Solving partial differential equations (PDEs) efficiently and accurately\nremains a cornerstone challenge in science and engineering, especially for\nproblems involving complex geometries and limited labeled data. We introduce a\nPhysics- and Geometry- Aware Spatio-Spectral Graph Neural Operator\n($\\pi$G-Sp$^2$GNO) for learning the solution operators of time-independent and\ntime-dependent PDEs. The proposed approach first improves upon the recently\ndeveloped Sp$^2$GNO by enabling geometry awareness and subsequently exploits\nthe governing physics to learn the underlying solution operator in a\nsimulation-free setup. While the spatio-spectral structure present in the\nproposed architecture allows multiscale learning, two separate strategies for\nenabling geometry awareness is introduced in this paper. For time dependent\nproblems, we also introduce a novel hybrid physics informed loss function that\ncombines higher-order time-marching scheme with upscaled theory inspired\nstochastic projection scheme. This allows accurate integration of the\nphysics-information into the loss function. The performance of the proposed\napproach is illustrated on number of benchmark examples involving regular and\ncomplex domains, variation in geometry during inference, and time-independent\nand time-dependent problems. The results obtained illustrate the efficacy of\nthe proposed approach as compared to the state-of-the-art physics-informed\nneural operator algorithms in the literature.",

    "abstract": "Plane detection from depth images is a crucial subtask with broad robotic\napplications, often accomplished by iterative methods such as Random Sample\nConsensus (RANSAC). While RANSAC is a robust strategy with strong probabilistic\nguarantees, the ambiguity of its inlier threshold criterion makes it\nsusceptible to false positive plane detections. This issue is particularly\nprevalent in complex real-world scenes, where the true number of planes is\nunknown and multiple planes coexist. In this paper, we aim to address this\nlimitation by proposing a generalised framework for plane detection based on\nmodel information optimization. Building on previous works, we treat the\nobserved depth readings as discrete random variables, with their probability\ndistributions constrained by the ground truth planes. Various models containing\ndifferent candidate plane constraints are then generated through repeated\nrandom sub-sampling to explain our observations. By incorporating the physics\nand noise model of the depth sensor, we can calculate the information for each\nmodel, and the model with the least information is accepted as the most likely\nground truth. This information optimization process serves as an objective\nmechanism for determining the true number of planes and preventing false\npositive detections. Additionally, the quality of each detected plane can be\nranked by summing the information reduction of inlier points for each plane. We\nvalidate these properties through experiments with synthetic data and find that\nour algorithm estimates plane parameters more accurately compared to the\ndefault Open3D RANSAC plane segmentation. Furthermore, we accelerate our\nalgorithm by partitioning the depth map using neural network segmentation,\nwhich enhances its ability to generate more realistic plane parameters in\nreal-world data.",

Existing research indicates that establishing the\ncausality between action and state transition will enhance an agent to reason\nhow a policy affects its future trajectory, thereby promoting directed\nexploration. However, it is challenging to measure the causality due to its\nintractability in the vast state-action space of complex scenarios. In this\npaper, we propose a novel Goal Discovery with Causal Capacity (GDCC) framework\nfor efficient environment exploration. Specifically, we first derive a\nmeasurement of causality in state space, \\emph{i.e.,} causal capacity, which\nrepresents the highest influence of an agent's behavior on future trajectories.\nAfter that, we present a Monte Carlo based method to identify critical points\nin discrete state space and further optimize this method for continuous\nhigh-dimensional environments. Those critical points are used to uncover where\nthe agent makes important decisions in the environment, which are then regarded\nas our subgoals to guide the agent to make exploration more purposefully and\nefficiently. Empirical results from multi-objective tasks demonstrate that\nstates with high causal capacity align with our expected subgoals, and our GDCC\nachieves significant success rate improvements compared to baselines.",

We propose the\nDualPhys-GS framework to achieve high-quality underwater reconstruction through\na dual-path optimization mechanism. Our approach further develops a dual\nfeature-guided attenuation-scattering modeling mechanism, the RGB-guided\nattenuation optimization model combines RGB features and depth information and\ncan handle edge and structural details. In contrast, the multi-scale\ndepth-aware scattering model captures scattering effects at different scales\nusing a feature pyramid network and an attention mechanism. Meanwhile, we\ndesign several special loss functions. The attenuation scattering consistency\nloss ensures physical consistency. The water body type adaptive loss\ndynamically adjusts the weighting coefficients. The edge-aware scattering loss\nis used to maintain the sharpness of structural edges. The multi-scale feature\nloss helps to capture global and local structural information. In addition, we\ndesign a scene adaptive mechanism that can automatically identify the\nwater-body-type characteristics (e.g., clear coral reef waters or turbid\ncoastal waters) and dynamically adjust the scattering and attenuation\nparameters and optimization strategies. Experimental results show that our\nmethod outperforms existing methods in several metrics, especially in suspended\nmatter-dense regions and long-distance scenes, and the reconstruction quality\nis significantly improved.",

By exploiting the stabilizing effect induced by the\nbackground magnetic field and constructing a hierarchy of four energy\nfunctionals, we establish global-in-time uniform bounds that are independent of\nthe viscosity in the $x_2$ and $x_3$ directions and the vertical resistivity. A\nkey innovation in our analysis is the development of a two-tier energy method,\nwhich couples the boundedness of conormal derivatives with the decay of\ntangential derivatives.

We leverage the observation that models are more likely to\nmemorize and subsequently generate text patterns that were commonly observed in\ntheir training data.

A well-known example is the non-Hermitian skin effect\n(NHSE), where Bloch eigenstates localize at a boundary, induced by a nontrivial\nspectrum winding number. In contrast, recent studies on lossy non-Hermitian\nlattices have uncovered an unexpected boundary-localized loss probability-a\nphenomenon that requires not only non-Hermitian band topology but also the\nclosure of the imaginary (dissipative) gap. Here, we demonstrate the\nnon-Hermitian edge burst in a classical-wave metamaterial: a lossy\nnonreciprocal acoustic crystal. We show that, when the imaginary gap remains\nclosed, edge bursts can occur at the right boundary, left boundary, or both\nboundaries simultaneously, all under the same non-Hermitian band topology; the\nlatter scenario is known as a bipolar edge burst.

    "abstract": "Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) map segmentation is one of the most important and\nchallenging tasks in autonomous driving. Camera-only approaches have drawn\nattention as cost-effective alternatives to LiDAR, but they still fall behind\nLiDAR-Camera (LC) fusion-based methods. Knowledge Distillation (KD) has been\nexplored to narrow this gap, but existing methods mainly enlarge the student\nmodel by mimicking the teacher's architecture, leading to higher inference\ncost. To address this issue, we introduce BridgeTA, a cost-effective\ndistillation framework to bridge the representation gap between LC fusion and\nCamera-only models through a Teacher Assistant (TA) network while keeping the\nstudent's architecture and inference cost unchanged. A lightweight TA network\ncombines the BEV representations of the teacher and student, creating a shared\nlatent space that serves as an intermediate representation. To ground the\nframework theoretically, we derive a distillation loss using Young's\nInequality, which decomposes the direct teacher-student distillation path into\nteacher-TA and TA-student dual paths, stabilizing optimization and\nstrengthening knowledge transfer. Extensive experiments on the challenging\nnuScenes dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving an\nimprovement of 4.2% mIoU over the Camera-only baseline, up to 45% higher than\nthe improvement of other state-of-the-art KD methods.",

This gap arises because FID evaluates global\ndistribution alignment, while ignoring the perceptual quality of individual\nsamples. We further examine the role of CFG, a common technique used to enhance\ngeneration quality. While effective in improving metrics and suppressing\noutliers, CFG can introduce distribution shift and visual artifacts due to its\nmisalignment with both training objectives and user expectations. In this work,\nwe propose FaME, a training-free and inference-efficient method for improving\nperceptual quality. FaME uses an image quality assessment model to identify\nlow-quality generations and stores their sampling trajectories. These failure\nmodes are then used as negative guidance to steer future sampling away from\npoor-quality regions.

While recent\nadvancements have achieved photorealistic renderings and plausible animation,\nhead editing, especially real-time appearance editing, remains challenging due\nto the implicit representation and entangled modeling of the geometry and\nglobal appearance. To address this, we propose Surface-Volumetric Gaussian Head\nAvatar (SVG-Head), a novel hybrid representation that explicitly models the\ngeometry with 3D Gaussians bound on a FLAME mesh and leverages disentangled\ntexture images to capture the global appearance. Technically, it contains two\ntypes of Gaussians, in which surface Gaussians explicitly model the appearance\nof head avatars using learnable texture images, facilitating real-time texture\nediting, while volumetric Gaussians enhance the reconstruction quality of\nnon-Lambertian regions (e.g., lips and hair). To model the correspondence\nbetween 3D world and texture space, we provide a mesh-aware Gaussian UV mapping\nmethod, which leverages UV coordinates given by the FLAME mesh to obtain sharp\ntexture images and real-time rendering speed. A hierarchical optimization\nstrategy is further designed to pursue the optimal performance in both\nreconstruction quality and editing flexibility.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across\ndiverse domains, including programming, planning, and decision-making. However,\ntheir performance often degrades when faced with highly complex problem\ninstances that require deep reasoning over long horizons. In such cases, direct\nproblem-solving approaches can lead to inefficiency or failure due to the lack\nof structured intermediate guidance. To address this, we propose a novel\nself-evolve framework, EvoCurr, in which a dedicated curriculum-generation LLM\nconstructs a sequence of problem instances with gradually increasing\ndifficulty, tailored to the solver LLM's learning progress. The curriculum\ndynamically adapts easing challenges when the solver struggles and escalating\nthem when success is consistent, thus maintaining an optimal learning\ntrajectory. This approach enables the solver LLM, implemented as a\ncode-generation model producing Python decision-tree scripts, to progressively\nacquire the skills needed for complex decision-making tasks. Experimental\nresults on challenging decision-making benchmarks show that our method\nsignificantly improves task success rates and solution efficiency compared to\ndirect-solving baselines. These findings suggest that LLM-driven curriculum\nlearning holds strong potential for enhancing automated reasoning in\nreal-world, high-complexity domains.",

    "abstract": "Coarse-Grained Reconfigurable Arrays (CGRAs) are specialized accelerators\ncommonly employed to boost performance in workloads with iterative structures.\nExisting research typically focuses on compiler or architecture optimizations\naimed at improving CGRA performance, energy efficiency, flexibility, and area\nutilization, under the idealistic assumption that kernels can access all data\nfrom Scratchpad Memory (SPM). However, certain complex workloads-particularly\nin fields like graph analytics, irregular database operations, and specialized\nforms of high-performance computing (e.g., unstructured mesh\nsimulations)-exhibit irregular memory access patterns that hinder CGRA\nutilization, sometimes dropping below 1.5%, making the CGRA memory-bound. To\naddress this challenge, we conduct a thorough analysis of the underlying causes\nof performance degradation, then propose a redesigned memory subsystem and\nrefine the memory model. With both microarchitectural and theoretical\noptimization, our solution can effectively manage irregular memory accesses\nthrough CGRA-specific runahead execution mechanism and cache reconfiguration\ntechniques. Our results demonstrate that we can achieve performance comparable\nto the original SPM-only system while requiring only 1.27% of the storage size.\nThe runahead execution mechanism achieves an average 3.04x speedup (up to\n6.91x), with cache reconfiguration technique providing an additional 6.02%\nimprovement, significantly enhancing CGRA performance for irregular memory\naccess patterns.",

In addition, the results are\ndirectly applicable to destructive degradation tests when number of inspection\nis one. The investigation is then extended to designs with aperiodic inspection\ntimes, a topic that has not been thoroughly explored in the existing\nliterature.

The\nsolver is integrated into the DISPATCH framework, which organises the\ncomputational domain into a collection of asynchronously updated patches. To\nreduce GPU kernel launch overhead, patches are grouped into \"bunches\" that are\nupdated collectively. While porting the particular solver required a complete\ncode refactoring, it yielded performance gains on both GPU and CPU. A\nstand-alone mini-app achieved a 7.3x speed-up compared to a single NVIDIA A100\nGPU to seven AMD 7F72 Rome CPU cores. Within the full DISPATCH framework, the\nGPU-accelerated MHD Bunch solver showed excellent agreement with the CPU-based\nreference implementation on standard test problems such as the Sod shock tube\nand Orszag-Tang vortex. In large-scale 3D tests, the GPU implementation\nachieved a 9.8x overall speedup, comparing one GPU to 12 CPU cores, with the\ncore MHD update routine being two orders of magnitude faster on the GPU than on\na single CPU core. These results demonstrate that OpenMP offloading can provide\nsubstantial performance improvements for astrophysical codes while maintaining\nportability and accuracy.

To address the challenges, we focus on a trustworthy RRG model, which\nnot only generates accurate descriptions of abnormalities, but also provides\nbasis of its predictions. To this end, we propose a framework named chain of\ndiagnosis (CoD), which maintains a chain of diagnostic process for clinically\naccurate and explainable RRG. It first generates question-answer (QA) pairs via\ndiagnostic conversation to extract key findings, then prompts a large language\nmodel with QA diagnoses for accurate generation. To enhance explainability, a\ndiagnosis grounding module is designed to match QA diagnoses and generated\nsentences, where the diagnoses act as a reference. Moreover, a lesion grounding\nmodule is designed to locate abnormalities in the image, further improving the\nworking efficiency of radiologists. To facilitate label-efficient training, we\npropose an omni-supervised learning strategy with clinical consistency to\nleverage various types of annotations from different datasets. Our efforts lead\nto 1) an omni-labeled RRG dataset with QA pairs and lesion boxes; 2) a\nevaluation tool for assessing the accuracy of reports in describing lesion\nlocation and severity; 3) extensive experiments to demonstrate the\neffectiveness of CoD, where it outperforms both specialist and generalist\nmodels consistently on two RRG benchmarks and shows promising explainability by\naccurately grounding generated sentences to QA diagnoses and images.",

However, current\nmulti-exposure correction methods often encounter challenges in addressing\nintra-class variability caused by diverse lighting conditions, shooting\nenvironments, and weather factors, particularly when processing images captured\nat a single exposure level. To enhance the adaptability of these models under\ncomplex imaging conditions, this paper proposes a Wavelet-based Exposure\nCorrection method with Degradation Guidance (WEC-DG). Specifically, we\nintroduce a degradation descriptor within the Exposure Consistency Alignment\nModule (ECAM) at both ends of the processing pipeline to ensure exposure\nconsistency and achieve final alignment. This mechanism effectively addresses\nmiscorrected exposure anomalies caused by existing methods' failure to\nrecognize 'blurred' exposure degradation. Additionally, we investigate the\nlight-detail decoupling properties of the wavelet transform to design the\nExposure Restoration and Detail Reconstruction Module (EDRM), which processes\nlow-frequency information related to exposure enhancement before utilizing\nhigh-frequency information as a prior guide for reconstructing spatial domain\ndetails. This serial processing strategy guarantees precise light correction\nand enhances detail recovery.

    "abstract": "Numerous centrality measures have been proposed to evaluate the importance of\nnodes in networks, yet comparative analyses of these measures remain limited.\nBased on 80 real-world networks, we conducted an empirical analysis of 16\nrepresentative centrality measures. In general, there exists a moderate to high\nlevel of correlation between node rankings derived from different measures. We\nidentified two distinct communities: one comprising 4 measures and the other 7\nmeasures. Measures within the same community exhibit exceptionally strong\npairwise correlations. In contrast, the remaining five measures display\nmarkedly different behaviors, showing weak correlations not only among\nthemselves but also with the other measures. This suggests that each of these\nfive measures likely captures unique properties of node importance. Further\nanalysis reveals that the distribution patterns of the most influential nodes\nidentified by different centrality measures vary significantly: some measures\ntend to cluster influential nodes closely together, while others disperse them\nacross distant locations within the network. Using the epidemic spreading\nmodel, we found that LocalRank, Subgraph Centrality, and Katz Centrality\nperform best in identifying the most influential single node, whereas Leverage\nCentrality, Collective Influence, and Cycle Ratio excel in identifying the most\ninfluential node sets. Overall, measures that identify influential nodes with\nlarger topological distances between them tend to perform better in detecting\ninfluential node sets. Interestingly, despite being applied to the same\ndynamical process, when using two seemingly similar tasks, identifying\ninfluential nodes versus identifying influential node sets, to rank the\nperformances of the 16 centrality measures, the resulting rankings are\nnegatively correlated.",

Superlattices, characterized by periodic\nrepetitions of two or more materials in different dimensions, have emerged as a\npromising area of investigation. We present a study of the phonon interference\neffect on thermal transport in GaAs-GaP superlattice nanowires with sharp\ninterfaces between the GaAs and GaP layers, as confirmed by high-resolution\ntransmission electron microscopy. We performed thermal conductivity\nmeasurements using the so-called thermal bridge method on superlattice\nnanowires with a period varying from 4.8 to 23.3 nm. The measurements showed a\nminimum of the thermal conductivity as a function of superlattice period up to\nroom temperature, that we interpreted as an indication of the crossover from\ncoherent to incoherent thermal transport. Notably, this effect is not destroyed\nby surface boundary or by phonon-phonon scattering, as the crossover trend is\nalso observed at room temperature. Our results were corroborated by both ab\ninitio lattice dynamics and semiclassical nonequilibrium molecular dynamics\ncalculations. These findings provide insights into the wave-like and\nparticle-like transport of phonons in superlattice nanowires and demonstrate\nthe potential for engineering thermal properties through precise control of the\nsuperlattice structure.",

    "abstract": "Objective - This study presents a biometric identification method based on\ntopological invariants from 2D iris images, representing iris texture via\nformally defined digital homology and evaluating classification performance.\n  Methods - Each normalized iris image (48x482 pixels) is divided into grids\n(e.g., 6x54 or 3x27). For each subregion, we compute Betti0, Betti1, and their\nratio using a recent algorithm for homology groups in 2D digital images. The\nresulting invariants form a feature matrix used with logistic regression, KNN,\nand SVM (with PCA and 100 randomized repetitions). A convolutional neural\nnetwork (CNN) is trained on raw images for comparison.\n  Results - Logistic regression achieved 97.78 +/- 0.82% accuracy,\noutperforming CNN (96.44 +/- 1.32%) and other feature-based models. The\ntopological features showed high accuracy with low variance.\n  Conclusion - This is the first use of topological invariants from formal\ndigital homology for iris recognition. The method offers a compact,\ninterpretable, and accurate alternative to deep learning, useful when\nexplainability or limited data is important. Beyond iris recognition, it can\napply to other biometrics, medical imaging, materials science, remote sensing,\nand interpretable AI. It runs efficiently on CPU-only systems and produces\nrobust, explainable features valuable for security-critical domains.",

We find that\nTM$_2$B$_2$ in the FeMo$_2$B$_2$-type and CoW$_2$B$_2$-type structures form a\nlarge family of stable/metastable materials of 120 members. Among them, we\nidentify 40 materials with stable magnetic solutions. Further, we discover 11\naltermagnets in the FeMo$_2$B$_2$-type structure. So far, boride altermagnets\nare rare. In these altermagnets, T = Fe or Mn atoms are arranged in parallel\nT-chains with strong ferromagnetic intrachain couplings and antiferromagnetic\ninterchain couplings. They simultaneously exhibit electronic band spin\nsplitting, typical of ferromagnetism, and zero net magnetization, typical of\nantiferromagnetism. They also exhibit magnonic band chiral splitting. Both\neffects originate from the unique altermagnetic symmetries crucially\nconstrained by the nonmagnetic atoms in the structure. Transport properties of\nrelevance to spintronic applications, including the strain-induced\nspin-splitter effect and anomalous Hall effect, are predicted. An\niodine-assisted synthesis method for TM$_2$B$_2$ is developed, using which 7 of\nthe predicted low-energy phases are experimentally synthesized and\ncharacterized, including 4 altermagnets. This work expands the realm of borides\nby offering new opportunities for studying altermagnetism and altermagnons in\nborides. It also provides valuable insights into the discovery and design of\naltermagnets. By demonstrating that altermagnets can exist as families sharing\na common motif, this work paves a feasible route for discovering altermagnets\nby elemental substitutions and high-throughput computations.",

However, the\nself-organizing nature of MASOS also introduces elements of unpredictability in\ntheir emergent behaviors. This paper focuses on the emergence of dependency\nhierarchies during task execution, aiming to understand how such hierarchies\narise from agents' collective pursuit of the joint objective, how they evolve\ndynamically, and what factors govern their development. To investigate this\nphenomenon, multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is employed to train\nMASOS for a collaborative box-pushing task. By calculating the gradients of\neach agent's actions in relation to the states of other agents, the inter-agent\ndependencies are quantified, and the emergence of hierarchies is analyzed\nthrough the aggregation of these dependencies. Our results demonstrate that\nhierarchies emerge dynamically as agents work towards a joint objective, with\nthese hierarchies evolving in response to changing task requirements. Notably,\nthese dependency hierarchies emerge organically in response to the shared\nobjective, rather than being a consequence of pre-configured rules or\nparameters that can be fine-tuned to achieve specific results. Furthermore, the\nemergence of hierarchies is influenced by the task environment and network\ninitialization conditions. Additionally, hierarchies in MASOS emerge from the\ndynamic interplay between agents' \"Talent\" and \"Effort\" within the\n\"Environment.\" \"Talent\" determines an agent's initial influence on collective\ndecision-making, while continuous \"Effort\" within the \"Environment\" enables\nagents to shift their roles and positions within the system.",

Prior studies demonstrate that when explicit\ninstructions--such as docstrings--are provided, these models can generate\nhighly accurate implementations. However, in real-world repositories, such\nannotations are frequently absent, and performance drops substantially without\nthem. To address this gap, we frame the task as a three-stage process. The\nfirst stage focuses on intent inference, where the model analyzes the code\npreceding the target function to uncover cues about the desired functionality.\nSuch preceding context often encodes subtle but critical information, and we\ndesign a reasoning-based prompting framework to guide the LLM through\nstep-by-step extraction and synthesis of these signals before any code is\ngenerated. The second stage introduces an optional interactive refinement\nmechanism to handle cases where preceding context alone is insufficient for\nintent recovery. In this stage, the model proposes a small set of candidate\nintentions, enabling the developer to select or edit them so that the inferred\nintent closely matches the actual requirement. Finally, in the third stage, the\nLLM generates the target function conditioned on the finalized intent. To\nsupport this pipeline, we curate a dataset of 40,000 examples annotated with\nintermediate reasoning traces and corresponding docstrings.

    "abstract": "The computational capabilities of a neural network are widely assumed to be\ndetermined by its static architecture. Here we challenge this view by\nestablishing that a fixed neural structure can operate in fundamentally\ndifferent computational modes, driven not by its structure but by the temporal\ndynamics of its input signals. We term this principle 'Dynamical Alignment'.\n  Applying this principle offers a novel resolution to the long-standing\nparadox of why brain-inspired spiking neural networks (SNNs) underperform. By\nencoding static input into controllable dynamical trajectories, we uncover a\nbimodal optimization landscape with a critical phase transition governed by\nphase space volume dynamics. A 'dissipative' mode, driven by contracting\ndynamics, achieves superior energy efficiency through sparse temporal codes. In\ncontrast, an 'expansive' mode, driven by expanding dynamics, unlocks the\nrepresentational power required for SNNs to match or even exceed their\nartificial neural network counterparts on diverse tasks, including\nclassification, reinforcement learning, and cognitive integration.\n  We find this computational advantage emerges from a timescale alignment\nbetween input dynamics and neuronal integration. This principle, in turn,\noffers a unified, computable perspective on long-observed dualities in\nneuroscience, from stability-plasticity dilemma to segregation-integration\ndynamic. It demonstrates that computation in both biological and artificial\nsystems can be dynamically sculpted by 'software' on fixed 'hardware', pointing\ntoward a potential paradigm shift for AI research: away from designing complex\nstatic architectures and toward mastering adaptive, dynamic computation\nprinciples.",

While trivial connections\ndisplay strong parameter dependence, nontrivial branches often exhibit\nparameter-independent behaviour. We also analyse the variation of the effective\ngravitational coupling $\\kappa_{\\text{eff}}=\\frac{1}{f_Q}$ across branches,\nproviding observational constraints that bridge theory and data. Applying the\nframework to $f(Q)=\\alpha Q+\\beta(-Q)^n$, we recover late-time acceleration and\n$\\Lambda$CDM-like behaviour without vacuum energy. Finally, we propose a\ngeneral route for extending dynamical systems analysis to broader classes of\n$f(Q)$ models using the $m_i$-hierarchy method, which enables closure of the\nautonomous system for models previously inaccessible to standard approaches.",

By utilizing both Monte Carlo data and the partial\ndifferential equations satisfied by $V$ and $Z_\\epsilon$, the DeepWKB method\ncomputes $V$ and $Z_\\epsilon$ separately. This enables an approximation of the\ninvariant distribution in the singular regime where $\\epsilon$ is sufficiently\nsmall, which remains a significant challenge for most existing methods.\nMoreover, the DeepWKB method is applicable to higher-dimensional stochastic\nsystems whose deterministic counterparts admit non-trivial attractors.

Building upon these insights, we adopt natural\nlanguage as a practical form of external guidance, and construct SOIBench-the\nfirst semantic cognitive guidance benchmark specifically targeting SOI\nchallenges. It automatically mines SOI frames through multi-tracker collective\njudgment and introduces a multi-level annotation protocol to generate precise\nsemantic guidance texts. Systematic evaluation on SOIBench reveals a striking\nfinding: existing vision-language tracking (VLT) methods fail to effectively\nexploit semantic cognitive guidance, achieving only marginal improvements or\neven performance degradation (AUC changes of -0.26 to +0.71). In contrast, we\npropose a novel paradigm employing large-scale vision-language models (VLM) as\nexternal cognitive engines that can be seamlessly integrated into arbitrary RGB\ntrackers.

Such coupling can be most naturally motivated from the\nrenormalisation of a scalar field theory with quartic self interaction in a\ncurved spacetime. This coupling is qualitatively different from the minimal\nones, like $\\sim \\sqrt{G} h^{\\mu\\nu}T_{\\mu\\nu}$, as the vertices corresponding\nto the former does not explicitly contain any scalar momenta, but instead\nexplicitly contains the momentum of the graviton. We show that the insertion of\none/two graviton-two scalar non-minimal vertices in the standard 2-2 scattering\nFeynman diagrams does not yield any contribution for the potential up to one\nloop, owing to the aforesaid explicit appearance of graviton's transfer\nmomentum in the numerator of the Feynman amplitude. In order to complement this\neffect, the most natural choice seems to consider the three graviton vertex\ngenerated by the $\\sim \\Lambda \\sqrt{-g}/G$ term in the action, where $\\Lambda$\nis the cosmological constant. This vertex does not contain explicitly any\ngraviton momentum.

To achieve this, our proposed scheme only\nrequires a noise-corrupted single input-state trajectory from each unknown\nsubsystem up to a specified time horizon, satisfying a certain rank condition.\nSubsequently, under a small-gain compositional reasoning, we compose those\nCSBC, derived from noisy data, and formulate a control barrier certificate\n(CBC) for the unknown network, ensuring its safety over an infinite time\nhorizon, while providing correctness guarantees.

We also examine how existing work\nin monolingual and multilingual ABSA, as well as ABSA with LLMs, contributes to\nthe development of cross-lingual ABSA. Finally, we highlight the main\nchallenges and suggest directions for future research to advance cross-lingual\nABSA systems.",

Most existing methods depend heavily on\noften unreliable translation tools to bridge the language gap. In this paper,\nwe propose a new approach that leverages a large language model (LLM) to\ngenerate high-quality pseudo-labelled data in the target language without the\nneed for translation tools. First, the framework trains an ABSA model to obtain\npredictions for unlabelled target language data. Next, LLM is prompted to\ngenerate natural sentences that better represent these noisy predictions than\nthe original text. The ABSA model is then further fine-tuned on the resulting\npseudo-labelled dataset. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method across\nsix languages and five backbone models, surpassing previous state-of-the-art\ntranslation-based approaches. The proposed framework also supports generative\nmodels, and we show that fine-tuned LLMs outperform smaller multilingual\nmodels.",

I show that digitization\nleads to entry by investors using algorithms, but does not push out investors\nusing human judgment. Instead, human investors shift toward houses that are\ndifficult to predict algorithmically. Algorithmic investors predominantly\npurchase minority-owned homes, a segment of the market where humans may be\nbiased. Digitization increases the average sale price of minority-owned homes\nby 5% and reduces racial disparities in home prices by 45%. Algorithmic\ninvestors, via competition, affect the prices paid by owner-occupiers and human\ninvestors for minority homes; such changes drive the majority of the reduction\nin racial disparities.

This enhancement exhibits resonant behavior if the long-range\npotential supports shallow bound states or narrow resonances, which can lead to\nviolations of the partial-wave unitarity bound. We identify the origin of this\npathological behavior as the emergence of secular terms in perturbative\nexpansions associated with low-energy composite states of the long-range\npotential. To address this issue, we propose a renormalization group\nimprovement of the perturbative series.

However, achieving efficient\nhydrogen desorption at ambient conditions remains a critical challenge for\npractical use. Here, we present a novel approach to modulate the desorption\ntemperature of hydrogen in TM-intercalated bilayer graphene (BLG) using\nexternal mechanical forces. By employing first-principles density functional\ntheory (DFT) and thermodynamic occupancy probability calculations, we\ndemonstrate that adjusting the interlayer distance allows for precise control\nover the interaction energy of H2, thereby facilitating its desorption at\nambient conditions. Complete hydrogen desorption occurs when the interlayer\ndistance is reduced below 4.7 {\\AA}, 5.3 {\\AA}, and 5.1 {\\AA} for Sc-, Ti-, and\nV-intercalated BLG, respectively. Our findings suggest that external mechanical\nforces can effectively bring hydrogen occupancy to zero by minimizing charge\ntransfer from the TM d-orbitals to H2 antibonding orbitals. Notably, while the\ntotal charge transferred from the TM atoms remains nearly constant at varying\ninterlayer distances, its redistribution between the graphene layers and H2\nfine-tunes the interaction strength. This approach can be extended to large\ninterlayer distances, as supported by recent experiments on graphene oxide\nmembranes [ACS Nano 12, 9309 (2018)].

    "abstract": "In the last decade, the study of pressure in active matter has attracted\ngrowing attention due to its fundamental relevance to nonequilibrium\nstatistical physics. Active matter systems are composed of particles that\nconsume energy to sustain persistent motion, which are inherently far from\nequilibrium. These particles can exhibit complex behaviors, including\nmotility-induced phase separation, density-dependent clustering, and anomalous\nstress distributions, motivating the introduction of active swim stress and\nswim pressure. Unlike in passive fluids, pressure in active systems emerges\nfrom momentum flux originated from swim force rather than equilibrium\nconservative interactions, offering a distinct perspective for understanding\ntheir mechanical response. Simple models of active Brownian particles (ABPs)\nhave been employed in theoretical and simulation studies across both dilute and\ndense regimes, revealing that pressure is a state function and exhibits a\nnontrivial dependence on density. Together with nonequilibrium statistical\nconcepts such as effective temperature and effective adhesion, pressure offers\nimportant insight for understanding behaviors in active matter such as\nsedimentation equilibrium and motility induced phase separation. Extensions of\nABPs models beyond their simplest form have underscored the fragility of\npressure-based equation of state, which can break down under factors such as\ndensity-dependent velocity, torque, complex boundary geometries and\ninteractions. Building on these developments, this review provides a\ncomprehensive survey of theoretical and experimental advances, with particular\nemphasis on the microscopic origins of active pressure and the mechanisms\nunderlying the breakdown of the equation of state.",

Rather than treating keyframes as\nisolated visual entities, Video-EM explicitly models them as temporally ordered\nepisodic events, capturing both spatial relationships and temporal dynamics\nnecessary for accurately reconstructing the underlying narrative. Furthermore,\nthe framework leverages chain of thought (CoT) thinking with LLMs to\niteratively identify a minimal yet highly informative subset of episodic\nmemories, enabling efficient and accurate question answering by Video-LLMs.\nExtensive evaluations on the Video-MME, EgoSchema, HourVideo, and LVBench\nbenchmarks confirm the superiority of Video-EM, which achieves highly\ncompetitive results with performance gains of 4-9 percent over respective\nbaselines while utilizing fewer frames.",

    "abstract": "In dissipative bosonic systems, dephasing is typically expected to accelerate\nrelaxation and suppress coherent dynamics. However, we show that in networks of\ncoherently coupled bosonic modes with non-uniform local dissipation, the\npresence of quasi-dark states leads to a nontrivial response to dephasing:\nwhile weak dephasing facilitates equilibration, moderate to strong dephasing\ninduces a pronounced slowdown of relaxation, revealing the existence of an\noptimal dephasing rate that enhances equilibration. Using exact dynamical\nequations for second-order moments, we demonstrate that dephasing suppresses\ncoherent transport and gives rise to long-lived collective modes that dominate\nthe system's late-time behavior. This phenomenon bears striking similarities to\nLifshitz-tail states, which are known in disordered systems to cause\nanomalously slow relaxation. Our results uncover a counterintuitive mechanism\nby which dephasing, rather than promoting equilibration, can dynamically\ndecouple specific modes from dissipation, thereby protecting excitations. These\nfindings highlight how non-Hermitian physics in open bosonic systems can give\nrise to unexpected dynamical regimes, paving the way for new strategies to\ncontrol relaxation and decoherence in bosonic quantum systems, with broad\nimplications for both experimental and theoretical quantum science.",

    "abstract": "Time series forecasting is a critical first step in generating demand plans\nfor supply chains. Experiments on time series models typically focus on\ndemonstrating improvements in forecast accuracy over existing/baseline\nsolutions, quantified according to some accuracy metric. There is no doubt that\nforecast accuracy is important; however in production systems, demand planners\noften value consistency and stability over incremental accuracy improvements.\nAssuming that the inputs have not changed significantly, forecasts that vary\ndrastically from one planning cycle to the next require high amounts of human\nintervention, which frustrates demand planners and can even cause them to lose\ntrust in ML forecasting models. We study model-induced stochasticity, which\nquantifies the variance of a set of forecasts produced by a single model when\nthe set of inputs is fixed. Models with lower variance are more stable.\n  Recently the forecasting community has seen significant advances in forecast\naccuracy through the development of deep machine learning models for time\nseries forecasting. We perform a case study measuring the stability and\naccuracy of state-of-the-art forecasting models (Chronos, DeepAR, PatchTST,\nTemporal Fusion Transformer, TiDE, and the AutoGluon best quality ensemble) on\npublic data sets from the M5 competition and Favorita grocery sales. We show\nthat ensemble models improve stability without significantly deteriorating (or\neven improving) forecast accuracy.

While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) and its\nvariants have recently attracted attention for its high efficiency, existing\nmethods remain unsuitable for satellite images due to incompatibility with\nrational polynomial coefficient (RPC) models and limited generalization\ncapability. Recent advances in generalizable 3DGS approaches show potential,\nbut they perform poorly on multi-temporal sparse satellite images due to\nlimited geometric constraints, transient objects, and radiometric\ninconsistencies. To address these limitations, we propose SkySplat, a novel\nself-supervised framework that integrates the RPC model into the generalizable\n3DGS pipeline, enabling more effective use of sparse geometric cues for\nimproved reconstruction. SkySplat relies only on RGB images and\nradiometric-robust relative height supervision, thereby eliminating the need\nfor ground-truth height maps. Key components include a Cross-Self Consistency\nModule (CSCM), which mitigates transient object interference via\nconsistency-based masking, and a multi-view consistency aggregation strategy\nthat refines reconstruction results. Compared to per-scene optimization\nmethods, SkySplat achieves an 86 times speedup over EOGS with higher accuracy.\nIt also outperforms generalizable 3DGS baselines, reducing MAE from 13.18 m to\n1.80 m on the DFC19 dataset significantly, and demonstrates strong\ncross-dataset generalization on the MVS3D benchmark.",

To address these, we present two key innovations.\nFirst, we introduce a Mixture of Facial Experts (MoFE) that dynamically\ncombines complementary cues from three specialized experts, each designed to\ncapture distinct but mutually reinforcing aspects of facial attributes. The\nidentity expert captures cross-pose identity-sensitive features, the semantic\nexpert extracts high-level visual semantxics, and the detail expert preserves\npixel-level features (e.g., skin texture, color gradients).

Face\nConstraints ensure facial angle diversity and a high proportion of facial\nregions, while Identity Consistency preserves coherent person-specific features\nacross temporal sequences, collectively addressing the scarcity of large facial\nangles and identity-stable training data in existing datasets.

A key real-world challenge arises when a model\nperforms poorly on unknown samples, yet these samples remain available for\nanalysis. This highlights that it should be approached as a ``few-shot\" task,\nwhere effectively utilizing a small number of samples can lead to significant\nimprovement. Unlike typical few-shot tasks focused on semantic understanding,\ndeepfake detection prioritizes image realism, which closely mirrors real-world\ndistributions.

During evaluation,\neach test sample is compared to the known fake and real samples, and it is\nclassified based on the category of the nearest sample.

The Lagrangian of the model contains two chiral nonets, a\nquark-antiquark type and a two-quark two-antiquark type. The pseudoscalar and\nscalar glueballs are introduced through their connections with the axial and\nthe trace anomalies of QCD, respectively. It is found that in order to satisfy\nthe axial anomaly and at the same time accurately generate all seven eta\nmasses, it is necessary to include at least two pseudoscalar glueballs, a\nphysical one and an unphysical one that gets integrated out and yields an\neffective instanton-type term which is needed in generation of the eta masses.\nAt the leading order, which corresponds to keeping effective terms in the\nLagrangian that contain no more than eight underlying quarks and antiquarks,\nthe mass spectrum of the model is worked out and shown to be in complete\nagreement with experiment. The quark and glue contents of the isosinglet\nscalars below 2 GeV, and of the isosinglet pseudoscalars up to around 2.2 GeV,\nare analyzed in detail and their correlations with the scalar glueball\ncondensate are examined. Decay widths of isosinglet scalars as well as\ndifferent self consistencies within this framework are used to probe the\nglueball condensate and thereby estimate the quark and glue contents of these\nstates. In the pseudoscalar sector, the state that is dominantly made of glue\nis clearly a state with mass above 2 GeV. In the scalar sector, the\nidentification of glue contents is less certain and in principle the three\nisosinglets in the 1.5-2.0 GeV can contain substantial glue.

However, current\ntechniques fundamentally suffer from intertwined deficiencies: insufficient\nrobustness against malicious attacks, frequent refusal of benign queries,\ndegradation in generated text quality and general task performance--the former\ntwo reflecting deficits in robust safety and the latter constituting utility\nimpairment. We trace these limitations to the coarse-grained layer-wise\ninterventions in existing methods. To resolve this, we propose NeuronTune, a\nfine-grained framework that dynamically modulates sparse neurons to achieve\nsimultaneous safety-utility optimization. Our approach first identifies\nsafety-critical and utility-preserving neurons across all layers via\nattribution, then employs meta-learning to adaptively amplify safety-neuron\nactivations and suppress utility-neuron activations. Crucially, NeuronTune\nenables tunable adjustment of intervention scope via neuron-count thresholds,\nsupporting flexible adaptation to security-critical or utility-priority\nscenarios. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method\nsignificantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art technologies, achieving\nsuperior model safety while maintaining excellent utility.",

We investigate the planar Hall effect in two-dimensional higher\nsymmetric $X$-wave magnets with $X=p,d,f,g,i$, where those with $X=d,g,i$ are\naltermagnets. The $X$-wave magnet is characterized by the number $N_{X}$ of the\nnodes in the band structure, where $N_{X}=1,2,3,4,6$ corresponding to\n$X=p,d,f,g,i$.

    "abstract": "Accurate acquisition of crowd flow at Points of Interest (POIs) is pivotal\nfor effective traffic management, public service, and urban planning. Despite\nthis importance, due to the limitations of urban sensing techniques, the data\nquality from most sources is inadequate for monitoring crowd flow at each POI.\nThis renders the inference of accurate crowd flow from low-quality data a\ncritical and challenging task. The complexity is heightened by three key\nfactors: 1) \\emph{The scarcity and rarity of labeled data}, 2) \\emph{The\nintricate spatio-temporal dependencies among POIs}, and 3) \\emph{The myriad\ncorrelations between precise crowd flow and GPS reports}.\n  To address these challenges, we recast the crowd flow inference problem as a\nself-supervised attributed graph representation learning task and introduce a\nnovel \\underline{C}ontrastive \\underline{S}elf-learning framework for\n\\underline{S}patio-\\underline{T}emporal data (\\model). Our approach initiates\nwith the construction of a spatial adjacency graph founded on the POIs and\ntheir respective distances. We then employ a contrastive learning technique to\nexploit large volumes of unlabeled spatio-temporal data. We adopt a swapped\nprediction approach to anticipate the representation of the target subgraph\nfrom similar instances. Following the pre-training phase, the model is\nfine-tuned with accurate crowd flow data. Our experiments, conducted on two\nreal-world datasets, demonstrate that the \\model pre-trained on extensive noisy\ndata consistently outperforms models trained from scratch.",

While\nits classical origin relies on capital-dependent bias and noise-induced\nasymmetry, realizing a robust quantum version of the paradox has remained\nchallenging, especially under the constraint of single-qubit coin systems. In\nthis work, we demonstrate that a genuine quantum Parrondo effect can emerge in\ndiscrete-time quantum walks (DTQWs) by alternating two SU(2) coin operators and\nintroducing a localized phase shift at the origin. Through a series of\nnumerical experiments, we show that this minimal model, without entanglement or\nhigh-dimensional coins, exhibits sustained positive drift only in the presence\nof spatial inhomogeneity. We analyze the role of phase angle, coin parameters,\nand game sequences, and identify optimal regions in which constructive\ninterference enables paradoxical transport. Our findings validate recent\ntheoretical claims that translational symmetry breaking is essential for\novercoming interference-induced cancellation, thereby enabling directed quantum\nmotion. This work opens new possibilities for realizing counterintuitive\nquantum dynamics using low-resource architectures, with potential applications\nin quantum control, energy harvesting, and coherence-assisted transport.",

    "abstract": "Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown significant advancements in tasks\nsuch as visual grounding, where they localize specific objects in images based\non natural language queries and images. However, security issues in visual\ngrounding tasks for VLMs remain underexplored, especially in the context of\nbackdoor attacks. In this paper, we introduce a novel input-aware backdoor\nattack method, IAG, designed to manipulate the grounding behavior of VLMs. This\nattack forces the model to ground a specific target object in the input image,\nregardless of the user's query. We propose an adaptive trigger generator that\nembeds the semantic information of the attack target's description into the\noriginal image using a text-conditional U-Net, thereby overcoming the\nopen-vocabulary attack challenge. To ensure the attack's stealthiness, we\nutilize a reconstruction loss to minimize visual discrepancies between poisoned\nand clean images. Additionally, we introduce a unified method for generating\nattack data. IAG is evaluated theoretically and empirically, demonstrating its\nfeasibility and effectiveness. Notably, our ASR@0.5 on InternVL-2.5-8B reaches\nover 65\\% on various testing sets. IAG also shows promising potential on\nmanipulating Ferret-7B and LlaVA-1.5-7B with very little accuracy decrease on\nclean samples.

    "abstract": "Character image animation, which generates high-quality videos from a\nreference image and target pose sequence, has seen significant progress in\nrecent years. However, most existing methods only apply to human figures, which\nusually do not generalize well on anthropomorphic characters commonly used in\nindustries like gaming and entertainment. Furthermore, previous methods could\nonly generate videos with static backgrounds, which limits the realism of the\nvideos. For the first challenge, our in-depth analysis suggests to attribute\nthis limitation to their insufficient modeling of motion, which is unable to\ncomprehend the movement pattern of the driving video, thus imposing a pose\nsequence rigidly onto the target character. To this end, this paper proposes\nAnimate-X++, a universal animation framework based on DiT for various character\ntypes, including anthropomorphic characters. To enhance motion representation,\nwe introduce the Pose Indicator, which captures comprehensive motion pattern\nfrom the driving video through both implicit and explicit manner. The former\nleverages CLIP visual features of a driving video to extract its gist of\nmotion, like the overall movement pattern and temporal relations among motions,\nwhile the latter strengthens the generalization of DiT by simulating possible\ninputs in advance that may arise during inference. For the second challenge, we\nintroduce a multi-task training strategy that jointly trains the animation and\nTI2V tasks. Combined with the proposed partial parameter training, this\napproach achieves not only character animation but also text-driven background\ndynamics, making the videos more realistic. Moreover, we introduce a new\nAnimated Anthropomorphic Benchmark (A2Bench) to evaluate the performance of\nAnimate-X++ on universal and widely applicable animation images.

However, their direct application to hyperspectral\nremote sensing remains challenging due to inherent spectral disparities and the\nscarcity of available observations. In this work, we present HyperKD, a novel\nknowledge distillation framework that enables transferring learned\nrepresentations from a teacher model into a student model for effective\ndevelopment of a foundation model on hyperspectral images. Unlike typical\nknowledge distillation frameworks, which use a complex teacher to guide a\nsimpler student, HyperKD enables an inverse form of knowledge transfer across\ndifferent types of spectral data, guided by a simpler teacher model. Building\nupon a Masked Autoencoder, HyperKD distills knowledge from the Prithvi\nfoundational model into a student tailored for EnMAP hyperspectral imagery.\nHyperKD addresses the inverse domain adaptation problem with spectral gaps by\nintroducing a feature-based strategy that includes spectral range-based channel\nalignment, spatial feature-guided masking, and an enhanced loss function\ntailored for hyperspectral images. HyperKD bridges the substantial spectral\ndomain gap, enabling the effective use of pretrained foundation models for\ngeospatial applications.

    "abstract": "Road traffic congestion is a persistent problem. Focusing resources on the\ncauses of congestion is a potentially efficient strategy for reducing\nslowdowns. We present NEXICA, an algorithm to discover which parts of the\nhighway system tend to cause slowdowns on other parts of the highway. We use\ntime series of road speeds as inputs to our causal discovery algorithm. Finding\nother algorithms inadequate, we develop a new approach that is novel in three\nways. First, it concentrates on just the presence or absence of events in the\ntime series, where an event indicates the temporal beginning of a traffic\nslowdown. Second, we develop a probabilistic model using maximum likelihood\nestimation to compute the probabilities of spontaneous and caused slowdowns\nbetween two locations on the highway. Third, we train a binary classifier to\nidentify pairs of cause/effect locations trained on pairs of road locations\nwhere we are reasonably certain a priori of their causal connections, both\npositive and negative. We test our approach on six months of road speed data\nfrom 195 different highway speed sensors in the Los Angeles area, showing that\nour approach is superior to state-of-the-art baselines in both accuracy and\ncomputation speed.",

    "abstract": "Micro-expression recognition (MER) is crucial in the affective computing\nfield due to its wide application in medical diagnosis, lie detection, and\ncriminal investigation. Despite its significance, obtaining micro-expression\n(ME) annotations is challenging due to the expertise required from\npsychological professionals. Consequently, ME datasets often suffer from a\nscarcity of training samples, severely constraining the learning of MER models.\nWhile current large pre-training models (LMs) offer general and discriminative\nrepresentations, their direct application to MER is hindered by an inability to\ncapture transitory and subtle facial movements-essential elements for effective\nMER. This paper introduces Motion Prompt Tuning (MPT) as a novel approach to\nadapting LMs for MER, representing a pioneering method for subtle motion prompt\ntuning. Particularly, we introduce motion prompt generation, including motion\nmagnification and Gaussian tokenization, to extract subtle motions as prompts\nfor LMs. Additionally, a group adapter is carefully designed and inserted into\nthe LM to enhance it in the target MER domain, facilitating a more nuanced\ndistinction of ME representation. Furthermore, extensive experiments conducted\non three widely used MER datasets demonstrate that our proposed MPT\nconsistently surpasses state-of-the-art approaches and verifies its\neffectiveness.",

    "abstract": "Vision-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments (VLN-CE) requires\nagents to follow natural language instructions through free-form 3D spaces.\nExisting VLN-CE approaches typically use a two-stage waypoint planning\nframework, where a high-level waypoint predictor generates the navigable\nwaypoints, and then a navigation planner suggests the intermediate goals in the\nhigh-level action space. However, this two-stage decomposition framework\nsuffers from: (1) global sub-optimization due to the proxy objective in each\nstage, and (2) a performance bottleneck caused by the strong reliance on the\nquality of the first-stage predicted waypoints. To address these limitations,\nwe propose DAgger Diffusion Navigation (DifNav), an end-to-end optimized VLN-CE\npolicy that unifies the traditional two stages, i.e. waypoint generation and\nplanning, into a single diffusion policy. Notably, DifNav employs a conditional\ndiffusion policy to directly model multi-modal action distributions over future\nactions in continuous navigation space, eliminating the need for a waypoint\npredictor while enabling the agent to capture multiple possible\ninstruction-following behaviors. To address the issues of compounding error in\nimitation learning and enhance spatial reasoning in long-horizon navigation\ntasks, we employ DAgger for online policy training and expert trajectory\naugmentation, and use the aggregated data to further fine-tune the policy. This\napproach significantly improves the policy's robustness and its ability to\nrecover from error states. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets\ndemonstrate that, even without a waypoint predictor, the proposed method\nsubstantially outperforms previous state-of-the-art two-stage waypoint-based\nmodels in terms of navigation performance.

Rubin Observatory and precursors to the Square Kilometre Array is the\nidentification of variable and transient objects. One approach is the\nstatistical analysis of the time series of the changing brightness of sources,\nthat is, their light curves. However, finding adequate statistical\nrepresentations of light curves is challenging because of data quality issues\nsuch as sparsity of observations, irregular sampling, and other nuisance\nfactors inherent in astronomical data collection. The wide diversity of objects\nthat a large-scale survey will observe also means that making parametric\nassumptions about the shape of light curves is problematic. We present a\nGaussian process (GP) regression approach for characterising light curve\nvariability that addresses these challenges. Our approach makes no assumptions\nabout the shape of a light curve and, therefore, is general enough to detect a\nrange of variable source types. In particular, we propose using the joint\ndistribution of GP amplitude hyperparameters to distinguish variable and\ntransient candidates from nominally stable ones and apply this approach to 6394\nradio light curves from the ThunderKAT survey. We compare our results with two\nvariability metrics commonly used in radio astronomy, namely $\\eta_\\nu$ and\n$V_\\nu$, and show that our approach has better discriminatory power and\ninterpretability.

In this paper, we turn to a traditional\nwork sector, Amazon fulfillment centers (FC), to deepen our field's empirical\nexamination of algorithmic management. Drawing on two years of ethnographic\nresearch, we show how FC workers react to managers' interventions, imposed\nproductivity rates, and quantified objectification when subjected to\nlabor-tracking systems in their physical work environments. Situating FC\nworkers' resistance to algorithmic systems and metrics within the current CSCW\nliterature allows us to explicate and link the nuanced practices of FC workers\nto the larger discourse of algorithmic control mechanisms. In addition, we show\nhow FC workers' resistance practices are emblematic of 'work games'--a\nlong-studied means by which workers agentically configure (\"trick\") their\nengagement within work systems.

However, in extreme degradation scenarios\n(e.g., scale $> 8\\times$), critical attributes and ID information are often\nseverely lost in the input image, making it difficult for conventional models\nto reconstruct realistic and ID-consistent faces. Existing methods tend to\ngenerate hallucinated faces under such conditions, producing restored images\nlacking authentic ID constraints. To address this challenge, we propose a novel\nFSR method with Identity Decoupling and Fitting (IDFSR), designed to enhance ID\nrestoration under large scaling factors while mitigating hallucination effects.\nOur approach involves three key designs: 1) \\textbf{Masking} the facial region\nin the low-resolution (LR) image to eliminate unreliable ID cues; 2)\n\\textbf{Warping} a reference image to align with the LR input, providing style\nguidance; 3) Leveraging \\textbf{ID embeddings} extracted from ground truth (GT)\nimages for fine-grained ID modeling and personalized adaptation. We first\npretrain a diffusion-based model to explicitly decouple style and ID by forcing\nit to reconstruct masked LR face regions using both style and identity\nembeddings. Subsequently, we freeze most network parameters and perform\nlightweight fine-tuning of the ID embedding using a small set of target ID\nimages. This embedding encodes fine-grained facial attributes and precise ID\ninformation, significantly improving both ID consistency and perceptual\nquality. Extensive quantitative evaluations and visual comparisons demonstrate\nthat the proposed IDFSR substantially outperforms existing approaches under\nextreme degradation, particularly achieving superior performance on ID\nconsistency.",

Our experimental results unequivocally demonstrate the\npresence of two distinct density wave (DW)-like orders, manifesting with onset\ntemperatures at $\\sim$140 K and $\\sim$115 K. Through time-resolved ellipticity\nmeasurements, we identified the higher-temperature order at 140 K ($T_{\\rm\nSDW}$) as the onset of a spin density wave (SDW) with associated electronic\nnematicity. In contrast, the lower-temperature order is attributed to a charge\norder. A key finding is the differential response of these orders to\nphotoexcitation: the charge order is entirely suppressed at a pump fluence of\napproximately 40 $\\mu$J/cm$^2$, whereas the SDW order persists up to 200\n$\\mu$J/cm$^2$, albeit with its characteristic temperature suppressed to\napproximately 70 K.

    "abstract": "Most autonomous-vehicles (AVs) driving strategies are designed and analyzed\nat the vehicle level, yet their aggregate impact on macroscopic traffic flow is\nstill not understood, particularly the flow heterogeneity that emerges when AVs\ninteract with human-driven vehicles (HVs). Existing validation techniques for\nmacroscopic flow models rely on high-resolution spatiotemporal data spanning\nentire road segments which are rarely available for mixed-autonomy traffic. AVs\nrecord detailed Lagrangian trajectories of the ego vehicle and surrounding\ntraffic through onboard sensors. Leveraging these Lagrangian observations to\nvalidate mixed-autonomy flow models therefore remains an open research\nchallenge. This paper closes the gap between microscopic Lagrangian data and\nmacroscopic Euclidean traffic models by introducing a continuous\ntraffic-heterogeneity attribute. We represent traffic flow with two coupled\nconservation laws with one for vehicle number and one for the traffic\nattribute. Reconstruction methods are designed to derive the traffic attribute\nfrom Lagrangian vehicle trajectories. When abundant trajectory data are\navailable, we characterize traffic heterogeneity by extracting drivers' desired\nspeed and local behavioral uncertainty from trajectories. In data-scarce mixed\ntraffic, we design an end-to-end mapping that infers the traffic heterogeneity\nsolely from trajectories in the current spatiotemporal region. Experiments\nacross multiple traffic datasets show that the proposed model effectively\ncaptures traffic heterogeneity by clustering the fundamental diagram scatter\ninto attribute-based groups. The calibration errors of traffic flow dynamics\nare also reduce by 20% relative to the Aw-Rascle-Zhang model benchmark.\nDetailed analyses further show that the model generalizes well, maintaining\nnearly the same accuracy when evaluated under a variety of previously unseen\ntraffic conditions.",

Mint and\nredemption flows follow mutually exciting processes that reproduce clustered\norder flow; peg deviations arise when redemptions exceed liquid reserves within\nsettlement windows. We develop a stochastic model predictive control framework\nthat incorporates moment closure for event intensities.

Despite these concerns, it remains uncertain whether such\nformat biases are systematic, which data-level factors contribute to them, and\nwhat internal mechanisms in LLMs underlie their emergence.\n  In this paper, we make the first attempt to investigate and analyze the\nformat bias in LLMs. To systematically investigate the aforementioned\nquestions, we conduct a three-stage empirical study by constructing an\nheterogeneous data conflict scenario for the exploration of bias. The first\nstage explores the presence and direction of bias across a diverse range of\nLLMs. The second stage aims to examine how key data-level factors, including\ninformation richness, structure quality, and format type, influence these\nbiases. The third stage analyzes how format bias emerges within LLMs' attention\npatterns and evaluates a lightweight intervention to test its potential\nmitigability. Based on these investigations, we identify three future research\ndirections to reduce format bias: improving data preprocessing through format\nsanitization and normalization, introducing inference-time interventions such\nas attention re-weighting, and developing format-balanced training corpora.\nThese directions will support the design of more robust and fair heterogeneous\ndata processing systems.",

However, most dynamo simulations adopt the co-density model,\nwhere the two diffusivities are assumed to be equal. In this study, we\nperformed both hydrodynamic and dynamo simulations of top-heavy DDC in a\nrotating spherical shell with the Lewis number $Le=100$, and compared them with\ncorresponding co-density models. In the hydrodynamic regime, the convective\nflow morphology is strongly influenced by the nature of the buoyancy sources.\nHowever, our dynamo simulations in the strong-field regime demonstrate that the\nco-density and DDC models yield qualitatively similar magnetic fields at\ncomparable magnetic Reynolds numbers, albeit with some differences in detail.\nThese numerical models further justify the use of the co-density model in\nplanetary dynamo simulations.

    "abstract": "We report a candidate repeating tidal disruption event (TDE), AT2022sxl,\nfound from large-field optical survey data. Two flares with a separation time\nof $\\sim$7.2\\,yr between the two optical peaks are observed. Related\nmid-infrared (MIR) flares, with delay times of $\\sim$200\\,day are also seen. We\nanalyze two optical spectra of the TDE source, onenear the optical peak of the\nsecond flare from the Transient Name Server and one at the quiescent flux level\nafter the second flare. The latter was taken by us with the 10.4-m Gran\nTelescopio Canarias. Comparing the features of the two spectra, we identify\nthat the host is likely a composite galaxy at redshift 0.23 and the TDE event,\nprobably an H+He type, mainly powered broad components in the emission lines of\nH$\\alpha$, H$\\beta$, and He~I $\\lambda$5876. More interestingly, we find that\ntwo Bronze-type neutrino events, detected by the IceCube neutrino observatory,\nmatch the TDE in position and the second flare, especially the delayed MIR\nflare, in time. We discuss the MIR luminosity properties of the currently\nreported (candidate) neutrino-emitting TDEs and suggest that luminous MIR\nemission is a prerequisite for neutrino production in TDEs.",

    "abstract": "As the demand for compact and efficient power conversion systems increases,\npiezoelectric power converters have gained attention for their ability to\nreplace bulky magnetic inductors with acoustic resonators, enabling higher\npower density and improved efficiency. Achieving optimal converter performance\nrequires resonators with high quality factor ($Q$), strong electromechanical\ncoupling ($k^2$), high power handling capability, and a spurious-free response.\nLithium niobate (LN) has emerged as a promising material in this context due to\nits high figure of merit (FoM = $Q \\cdot k^2$). While previous studies on\nsingle-layer LN resonators have demonstrated high FoM values, they typically\noperate at relatively low resonance frequencies ($f_s$). Recently, periodically\npoled piezoelectric film (P3F) structures, formed by stacking piezoelectric\nlayers with alternating crystal orientations, have shown the potential to both\nscale up the operating frequency and enhance the FoM compared to single-layer\ncounterparts in piezoelectric power conversion. This work presents the first\nP3F thickness-extensional (TE) LN resonator for power conversion, operating at\n19.23 MHz, with a large \\textit{$k^2$} of 29\\% and a high \\textit{Q} of 3187,\nachieving a state-of-the-art (\\textit{ $f_s \\cdot Q$}) product among\npiezoelectric power resonators. A high-power testing procedure is performed to\nsystematically study the nonlinear behavior and power handling of P3F LN for\npower applications. With further optimization, P3F TE resonators have the\npotential to open up a new design space for high-power and high-frequency power\nconversion.",

We consider CPT violation from the electroweak Yang-Mills\nsector, characterized by Lorentz-violating coefficients $(k_1)_\\mu$ and\n$(k_2)_\\mu$, which have positive mass units. The $\\bar{\\nu}\\nu \\gamma$ vertex\narises at tree level via exchange of two $Z$ bosons. Although suppressed by\n$\\frac{1}{m_Z^4}$, this process is notable. The vertex function $\\Gamma_\\mu$\nincludes three independent gauge structures satisfying the Ward identity $q^\\mu\n\\Gamma_\\mu = 0$, characteristic of neutral particles, and induces\ngauge-independent electromagnetic form factors. Besides charge and anapole, two\nnovel form factors appear. The charge form factor $f_Q(q^2)$ contains an\nenergy-dependent term causing $f_Q(0)\\neq 0$, so electromagnetic properties are\nundefined for real photons with CPT violation. Instead, $f_Q$ and the charge\nradius are defined in the static limit: $q^0=0$ and $\\mathbf{q}\\to 0$. Here,\n$f_Q(0, \\mathbf{0})=0$ and a correction to the SM neutrino charge radius is\nfound: \\[ \\langle r^2_\\nu \\rangle_{CPTV} = \\frac{3c_{2W}}{2c_W^4}\n\\left[\\frac{k_2^2}{m_Z^2} + \\frac{\\mathbf{k}_2^2}{m_Z^2}\\cos^2\\theta_\\gamma\n\\right] \\frac{1}{m_Z^2}, \\] with $\\theta_\\gamma$ the angle between $\\mathbf{q}$\nand $\\mathbf{k}_2$.
