    "abstract": "In the dynamic landscape of project management, scope changes are an\ninevitable reality that can significantly impact project performance. These\nchanges, whether initiated by stakeholders, external factors, or internal\nproject dynamics, can lead to cost overruns and schedule delays. Accurately\npredicting the consequences of these changes is crucial for effective project\ncontrol and informed decision-making. This study aims to develop predictive\nmodels to estimate the impact of scope changes on project cost and schedule\nusing machine learning techniques. The research utilizes a comprehensive\ndataset containing detailed information on project tasks, including the Work\nBreakdown Structure (WBS), task type, productivity rate, estimated cost, actual\ncost, duration, task dependencies, scope change magnitude, and scope change\ntiming. Multiple machine learning models are developed and evaluated to predict\nthe impact of scope changes on project cost and schedule. These models include\nLinear Regression, Decision Tree, Ridge Regression, Random Forest, Gradient\nBoosting, and XGBoost. The dataset is split into training and testing sets, and\nthe models are trained using the preprocessed data. Model robustness and\ngeneralization are assessed using cross-validation techniques. To evaluate the\nperformance of models, we use Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R2. Residual plots\nare generated to assess the goodness of fit and identify any patterns or\noutliers. Hyperparameter tuning is performed to optimize the XGBoost model and\nimprove its predictive accuracy. The study identifies the most influential\nproject attributes in determining the magnitude of cost and schedule deviations\ncaused by scope modifications. It is identified that productivity rate, scope\nchange magnitude, task dependencies, estimated cost, actual cost, duration, and\nspecific WBS elements are powerful predictors.",

    "abstract": "Quantum systems composed of solid-state electronic spins can be sensitive\ndetectors of narrowband magnetic fields. A prominent example is the\nnitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond, which has been employed for magnetic\nspectroscopy with high spatial and spectral resolution. However, NV-diamond\nspectroscopy protocols are typically based on dynamical decoupling sequences,\nwhich are limited to low-frequency signals ($\\lesssim{20}\\,$MHz) due to the\ntechnical requirements on microwave (MW) pulses used to manipulate NV\nelectronic spins. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate a high-resolution\nmagnetic spectroscopy protocol that integrates a quantum frequency mixing (QFM)\neffect in a dense NV ensemble with coherently averaged synchronized readout\n(CASR) to provide both a wide range of signal frequency detection and sub-Hz\nspectral resolution. We assess the sensitivity of this QFM-CASR protocol across\na frequency range of 10$\\,$MHz to 4$\\,$GHz. By measuring the spectra of\nmulti-frequency signals near 0.6, 2.4 and 4$\\,$GHz, we demonstrate sub-Hz\nspectral resolution with a nT-scale noise floor for the target signal, and\nprecise phase measurement with error $<1^\\circ$. Compared to state-of-the-art\nNV-diamond techniques for narrowband magnetic spectroscopy, the QFM-CASR\nprotocol greatly extends the detectable frequency range, enabling applications\nin high-frequency radio frequency (RF) and MW signal microscopy and analysis,\nas well as tesla-scale nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy of small\nsamples.",

    "abstract": "We develop an effective computational tool for simulating the scattering of\n1D waves by a composite layer architected in an otherwise homogeneous medium.\nThe layer is designed as the union of segments cut from various mother periodic\nmedia, which allows us to describe the wavefield in each segment in terms of\nthe ``left'' and ``right'' Bloch waves. For a given periodic medium and\nfrequency of oscillations, the latter are computed by solving the quadratic\neigenvalue problem which seeks the wavenumber -- and affiliated eigenstate --\nof a Bloch wave. In this way the scattering problem is reduced to a\nlow-dimensional algebraic problem, solved via the transfer matrix approach,\nthat seeks the amplitudes of the featured Bloch waves, amplitude of the\nreflected wave, and that of the transmitted wave. Such an approach inherently\ncaters for an optimal filter design as it enables rapid exploration of the\ndesign space with respect to segment (i) permutations, (ii) cut lengths, and\n(iii) cut offsets relative to the mother periodic media. Specifically, under\n(i)--(iii) the Bloch eigenstates remain invariant, so that only the transfer\nmatrices need to be recomputed. The reduced order model is found to be in\nexcellent agreement with numerical simulations. Example simulations demonstrate\n40x computational speedup when optimizing a 1D filter for minimum transmission\nvia a genetic algorithm approach that entails $O(10^6)$ trial configurations.\nRelative to the classical rainbow trap design where the unit cells of the\nmother periodic media are arranged in a ``linear'' fashion according to their\ndispersive characteristics, the GA-optimized (rearranged) configuration yields\na $40\\%$ reduction in filter transmissibility over the target frequency range,\nfor the same filter thickness.",

These studies often\nrely on problematic methodologies and consider a limited scope of methods,\nfrequently overlooking compelling methods from the broader time series\nclustering literature. Consequently, they struggle to provide dependable\nguidance for practitioners designing their own clustering approaches.\n  This paper presents a comprehensive comparative framework for SMTS clustering\nmethods using expert-informed synthetic datasets that emphasise peak\nconsumption behaviours as fundamental cluster concepts. Using a phased\nmethodology, we first evaluated 31 distance measures and 8 representation\nmethods using leave-one-out classification, then examined the better-suited\nmethods in combination with 11 clustering algorithms. We further assessed the\nrobustness of these combinations to systematic changes in key dataset\nproperties that affect clustering performance on real-world datasets, including\ncluster balance, noise, and the presence of outliers.\n  Our results revealed that methods accommodating local temporal shifts while\nmaintaining amplitude sensitivity, particularly Dynamic Time Warping and\n$k$-sliding distance, consistently outperformed traditional approaches.

However, the high costs and complexity of designing and training\nend-to-end autonomous driving models make them challenging for many enterprises\nand research entities. To address this, our study explores a seamless\nintegration of MLLMs into autonomous driving systems by proposing a Zero-Shot\nChain-of-Thought (Zero-Shot-CoT) prompt design named PKRD-CoT. PKRD-CoT is\nbased on the four fundamental capabilities of autonomous driving: perception,\nknowledge, reasoning, and decision-making. This makes it particularly suitable\nfor understanding and responding to dynamic driving environments by mimicking\nhuman thought processes step by step, thus enhancing decision-making in\nreal-time scenarios. Our design enables MLLMs to tackle problems without prior\nexperience, thereby increasing their utility within unstructured autonomous\ndriving environments. In experiments, we demonstrate the exceptional\nperformance of GPT-4.0 with PKRD-CoT across autonomous driving tasks,\nhighlighting its effectiveness in autonomous driving scenarios. Additionally,\nour benchmark analysis reveals the promising viability of PKRD-CoT for other\nMLLMs, such as Claude, LLava1.6, and Qwen-VL-Plus. Overall, this study\ncontributes a novel and unified prompt-design framework for GPT-4.0 and other\nMLLMs in autonomous driving, while also rigorously evaluating the efficacy of\nthese widely recognized MLLMs in the autonomous driving domain through\ncomprehensive comparisons.",

    "abstract": "Cutting mechanics of soft solids is gaining rapid attention thanks to its\npromising benefits in material characterization and other applications.\nHowever, a full understanding of the physical phenomena is still missing, and\nseveral questions remain outstanding. E.g.: How can we directly and reliably\nmeasure toughness from cutting experiments? What is the role of blade\nsharpness? In this paper, we explore the simple problem of wire cutting, where\nblade sharpness is only defined by the wire radius. Through finite element\nanalysis, we obtain a simple scaling relation between the wire radius and the\nsteady-state cutting force per unit sample thickness. The cutting force is\nindependent of the wire radius if the latter is below a transition length,\nwhile larger radii produce a linear force-radius correlation. The minimum\ncutting force, for small radii, is given by cleavage toughness, i.e., the\nsurface energy required to break covalent bonds in the crack plane. The\nforce-radius slope is instead given by the wear shear strength in the material.\nVia cutting experiments on polyacrylamide gels, we find that the magnitude of\nshear strength is close to the work of fracture of the material, i.e., the\ncritical strain energy density required to break a pristine sample in uniaxial\ntension. The work of fracture characterizes the toughening contribution from\nthe fracture process zone (FPZ), which adds to cleavage toughness. Our study\nprovides two important messages, that answer the above questions: Toughness can\nbe estimated from wire-cutting experiments from the intercept of the\nforce-radius linear correlation, as previously explored. However, as we\ndiscovered, this only estimates cleavage toughness. Additionally, the\nforce-radius slope is correlated with the work of fracture, giving an\nestimation of the dissipative contributions from the FPZ.",

To address these issues, we develop a novel approach for\ndynamic predictions based on a recently developed method estimating complex\npatterns of variation for exponential family data: fast Generalized Functional\nPrincipal Components Analysis (fGFPCA). Our method is able to handle\nlarge-scale, high-density repeated measures much more efficiently with its\nimplementation feasible even on personal computational resources (e.g., a\nstandard desktop or laptop computer). The proposed method makes highly flexible\nand accurate predictions of future trajectories for data that exhibit high\ndegrees of nonlinearity, and allows for out-of-sample predictions to be\nobtained without reestimating any parameters. A simulation study is designed\nand implemented to illustrate the advantages of this method. To demonstrate its\npractical utility, we also conducted a case study to predict diurnal\nactive/inactive patterns using accelerometry data from the National Health and\nNutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2011-2014. Both the simulation study and\nthe data application demonstrate the better predictive performance and high\ncomputational efficiency of the proposed method compared to existing methods.\nThe proposed method also obtains more personalized prediction that improves as\nmore information becomes available, which is an essential goal of dynamic\nprediction that other methods fail to achieve.",

    "abstract": "Due to their large sizes, volumetric scans and whole-slide pathology images\n(WSIs) are often processed by extracting embeddings from local regions and then\nan aggregator makes predictions from this set. However, current methods require\npost-hoc visualization techniques (e.g., Grad-CAM) and often fail to localize\nsmall yet clinically crucial details. To address these limitations, we\nintroduce INSIGHT, a novel weakly-supervised aggregator that integrates heatmap\ngeneration as an inductive bias. Starting from pre-trained feature maps,\nINSIGHT employs a detection module with small convolutional kernels to capture\nfine details and a context module with a broader receptive field to suppress\nlocal false positives. The resulting internal heatmap highlights diagnostically\nrelevant regions. On CT and WSI benchmarks, INSIGHT achieves state-of-the-art\nclassification results and high weakly-labeled semantic segmentation\nperformance.

The mass and luminosity of\nthese cores, which are fundamental physical characteristics, are difficult to\ndetermine, a problem greatly exacerbated at the distances >2 kpc of ALMA-IMF\nprotoclusters. We combined new datasets and radiative transfer modeling to\ncharacterize these cores. We estimated their mass-averaged temperature and the\nmasses these estimates imply. For 1/6 of the sample, we measured the bolometric\nluminosities, implementing deblending corrections when necessary. We used\nspectral energy distribution (SED) analysis obtained with the PPMAP Bayesian\nprocedure, which aims to preserve the best angular resolution of the input\ndata. We extrapolated the luminosity and dust temperature images provided by\nPPMAP at 2.5\" resolution to estimate those of individual cores, which were\nidentified at higher angular resolution. To do this, we applied approximate\nradiative transfer relationships between the luminosity of a protostar and the\ntemperature of its surrounding envelope and between the external heating of\nprestellar cores and their temperatures. For the first time, we provide\ndata-informed estimates of dust temperatures for 883 cores identified with\nALMA-IMF: 17-31 K and 28-79 K (5th and 95th percentiles, up to 127 K) for the\n617 prestellar and 266 protostellar cores, respectively. We also measured\nprotostellar luminosities spanning 20-80 000 Lsun. For hot cores, we estimated\nsystematically lower temperatures than studies based on complex organic\nmolecules. We established a mass-luminosity evolutionary diagram, for the first\ntime at the core spatial resolution and for a large sample of high-mass\nprotostellar cores. The ALMA-IMF data favor a scenario in which protostars\naccrete their mass from a larger mass reservoir than their host cores.",

    "abstract": "In many settings, machine learning models may be used to inform decisions\nthat impact individuals or entities who interact with the model. Such entities,\nor agents, may game model decisions by manipulating their inputs to the model\nto obtain better outcomes and maximize some utility. We consider a multi-agent\nsetting where the goal is to identify the \"worst offenders:\" agents that are\ngaming most aggressively. However, identifying such agents is difficult without\nknowledge of their utility function. Thus, we introduce a framework in which\neach agent's tendency to game is parameterized via a scalar. We show that this\ngaming parameter is only partially identifiable. By recasting the problem as a\ncausal effect estimation problem where different agents represent different\n\"treatments,\" we prove that a ranking of all agents by their gaming parameters\nis identifiable. We present empirical results in a synthetic data study\nvalidating the usage of causal effect estimation for gaming detection and show\nin a case study of diagnosis coding behavior in the U.S. that our approach\nhighlights features associated with gaming.",

Thus, they are promising\ntechnologies for the building blocks that assemble global financial\ninfrastructure. To facilitate global scaling, clustered replication protocols\nare essential in orchestrating nodes into clusters based on proximity.

This paper presents heterogeneous and reconfigurable\nclustered replication for the general environment with arbitrary failures.

We formally state and prove the safety and liveness properties of the\nprotocol. Furthermore, our replication protocol is consensus-agnostic, meaning\neach cluster can utilize any local replication mechanism. In our comprehensive\nevaluation, we instantiate our replication with both HotStuff and BFT-SMaRt.\nExperiments on geo-distributed deployments on Google Cloud demonstrates that\nmembers of clusters can be reconfigured without considerably affecting\ntransaction processing, and that heterogeneity of clusters may significantly\nimprove throughput.",

A key distinction is whether or not\nthis memory can be simulated classically, as this can lead to efficient\nmodelling and noise mitigation. Powerful tools have been developed recently\nwithin the process matrix formalism, a framework that conveniently\ncharacterises all multi-time correlations through a sequence of measurements.\nThis leads to a detailed classification of classical and quantum-memory\nprocesses and provides operational procedures to distinguish between them.\nHowever, these results leave open the question of what type of\nsystem-environment interactions lead to classical memory. More generally,\nprocess-matrix methods lack a direct connection to joint system-environment\nevolution, a cornerstone of open-system modelling. In this work, we\ncharacterise Hamiltonian and circuit-based models of system-environment\ninteractions leading to classical memory. We show that general time-dependent\nHamiltonians with product eigenstates, and where the environment's eigenstates\nform a time-independent, orthonormal basis, always produce a particular type of\nclassical memory: probabilistic mixtures of unitary processes. Additionally, we\nshow that the most general type of classical-memory processes can be generated\nby a quantum circuit in which system and environment interact through a\nspecific class of controlled unitaries. Our results establish the first strong\nlink between process-matrix methods and traditional Hamiltonian-based\napproaches to open quantum systems.",

    "abstract": "Cough is a protective reflex conveying information on the state of the\nrespiratory system. Cough assessment has been limited so far to subjective\nmeasurement tools or uncomfortable (i.e., non-wearable) cough monitors. This\nlimits the potential of real-time cough monitoring to improve respiratory care.\nObjective: This paper presents a machine hearing system for audio-based robust\ncough segmentation that can be easily deployed in mobile scenarios. Methods:\nCough detection is performed in two steps. First, a short-term spectral feature\nset is separately computed in five predefined frequency bands: [0, 0.5), [0.5,\n1), [1, 1.5), [1.5, 2), and [2, 5.5125] kHz. Feature selection and combination\nare then applied to make the short-term feature set robust enough in different\nnoisy scenarios. Second, high-level data representation is achieved by\ncomputing the mean and standard deviation of short-term descriptors in 300 ms\nlong-term frames. Finally, cough detection is carried out using a support\nvector machine trained with data from different noisy scenarios. The system is\nevaluated using a patient signal database which emulates three real-life\nscenarios in terms of noise content. Results: The system achieves 92.71%\nsensitivity, 88.58% specificity, and 90.69% Area Under Receiver Operating\nCharacteristic (ROC) curve (AUC), outperforming state-of-the-art methods.\nConclusion: Our research outcome paves the way to create a device for cough\nmonitoring in real-life situations. Significance: Our proposal is aligned with\na more comfortable and less disruptive patient monitoring, with benefits for\npatients (allows self-monitoring of cough symptoms), practitioners (e.g.,\nassessment of treatments or better clinical understanding of cough patterns),\nand national health systems (by reducing hospitalizations).",

This discovery was\nfundamental to widening our horizons and our conception of space, and since\nthen determining the rate at which our Universe is expanding has become one of\nthe crucial measurements in cosmology. At the beginning of this century, these\nmeasurements revealed the unexpected behavior that this expansion is\naccelerating and allowed us to have a first glimpse of the dark components that\nconstitute $\\sim$95\\% of our Universe. Cosmic chronometers represent a novel\ntechnique to obtain a cosmology-independent determination of the expansion of\nthe Universe, based on the differential age dating of a population of very\nmassive and passively evolving galaxies. Currently, with this new cosmological\nprobe it is possible to constrain the Hubble parameter with an accuracy of\naround 5\\% at $z\\sim0.5$ up to 10-20\\% at $z\\sim2$. In this Chapter, the cosmic\nchronometers approach is presented, describing the method and how an optimal\nsample can be selected; it is then discussed how the most recent measurements\nof the expansion history of the Universe have been obtained with this approach,\nas well as the cosmological constraints that can be derived. Particular\nattention will be given to the systematics involved in this approach and the\ntreatment to properly take them into account. We conclude by presenting\nforecasts that show how future spectroscopic surveys will significantly boost\nthe accuracy of this method and open the possibility to a percent determination\nof the Hubble constant, making cosmic chronometers a powerful independent tool\nto derive information on the expansion history of the Universe.",

However, when data is decentralized across a network of agents\nsubject to communication and privacy constraints, standard SGLD algorithms\ncannot be applied.

In previous research, directed message passing neural\nnetworks (D-MPNN) have successfully been used to predict solvation free\nenergies and enthalpies in organic solvents. However, solvent mixtures provide\ngreater flexibility for optimizing solvent interactions than monosolvents. This\nwork aims to extend our previous models to mixtures. To handle mixtures in a\npermutation invariant manner we propose a pooling function; MolPool. With this\npooling function, the machine learning models can learn and predict properties\nfor an arbitrary number of molecules. The novel SolProp-mix software that\napplies MolPool to D-MPNN was compared to state-of-the-art architectures for\npredicting mixture properties and validated with our new database of COSMOtherm\ncalculations; BinarySolv-QM. To improve predictions towards experimental\naccuracy, the network was then fine-tuned on experimental data in monosolvents.\nTo demonstrate the benefit of this transfer learning methodology, experimental\ndatasets of solvation free energies in binary (BinarySolv-Exp) and ternary\n(TernarySolv-Exp) solvent mixtures were compiled from data on vapor-liquid\nequilibria and activity coefficients. The neural network performed better than\nCOSMOtherm calculations with an MAE of 0.25 kcal/mol and an RMSE of 0.37\nkcal/mol for non-aqueous mixed solvents.

This paper aims to address this challenge. Both theoretically and\nempirically, we show that an \\textit{implicit PRM} can be obtained at no\nadditional cost, by simply training an ORM on the cheaper response-level\nlabels. The only assumption is to parameterize the outcome reward as the\nlog-likelihood ratios of the policy and reference models, which can be\noptimized regardless of the specific choice of loss objectives. In experiments,\nwe instantiate our implicit PRMs with various objectives and evaluate their\nperformance on MATH. We show that our implicit PRM outperforms a strong\nMCTS-based baseline \\textit{\\'a la} Math-Shepherd using less than $1/38$ of the\ntraining data. Its performance can be further improved with majority voting. We\nfurther find that scaling up instructions and responses benefits our implicit\nPRM, and the latter brings a larger gain. Particularly, we find that our\nimplicit PRM, when instantiated with the cross-entropy (CE) loss, is more\ndata-efficient and can keep improving generation models even when trained with\nonly one response per instruction, the setup that suffers from extreme data\nscarcity and imbalance. Further, instructions should be relevant to downstream\ntasks while the diversity of responses does not bring gains. Surprisingly,\ntraining on extra Math-Shepherd step labels brings no further improvements to\nour implicit PRM trained on only outcome data. We hope that our work will\nencourage a rethinking of PRM training approaches and contribute to making\ntraining PRMs more accessible.",

To mitigate such attacks, the defender\nintroduces asymmetrical information by deploying a \"hidden sensor,\" whose\npresence is initially undisclosed but can be revealed if queried. We introduce\nhypergames on graphs to model this game with asymmetric information.

The proposed\nmethod is systematically investigated by use of virtual imaging studies of 3D\nbreast PACT that employ ensembles of numerical breast phantoms and a\nphysics-based model of the data acquisition process. The method is subsequently\napplied to experimental data acquired in an \\textit{in vivo} breast PACT study.\nThe results confirm that the half-scan FBP method can accurately reconstruct 3D\nimages from half-scan data. Importantly, because the sought-after inverse\nmapping is well-posed, the reconstruction method remains accurate even when\napplied to data that differ considerably from those employed to learn the\nfiltering operation.",

    "abstract": "Protein evolution involves mutations occurring across a wide range of time\nscales. In analogy with disordered systems in statistical physics, this\ndynamical heterogeneity suggests strong correlations between mutations\nhappening at distinct sites and times. To quantify these correlations, we\nexamine the role of various fluctuation sources in protein evolution, simulated\nusing a data-driven energy landscape as a proxy for protein fitness. By\napplying spatio-temporal correlation functions developed in the context of\ndisordered physical systems, we disentangle fluctuations originating from the\ninitial condition, i.e. the ancestral sequence from which the evolutionary\nprocess originated, from those driven by stochastic mutations along independent\nevolutionary paths. Our analysis shows that, in diverse protein families,\nfluctuations from the ancestral sequence predominate at shorter time scales.\nThis allows us to identify a time scale over which ancestral sequence\ninformation persists, enabling its reconstruction. We link this persistence to\nthe strength of epistatic interactions: ancestral sequences with stronger\nepistatic signatures impact evolutionary trajectories over extended periods. At\nlonger time scales, however, ancestral influence fades as epistatically\nconstrained sites evolve collectively. To confirm this idea, we apply a\nstandard ancestral sequence reconstruction algorithm and verify that the\ntime-dependent recovery error is influenced by the properties of the ancestor\nitself. Overall, our results reveal that the properties of ancestral sequences\n- particularly their epistatic constraints - influence the initial evolutionary\ndynamics and the performance of standard ancestral sequence reconstruction\nalgorithms.",

The high demand for data has led to many paradigms that involve selling,\nexchanging, and sharing data, motivating the study of economic processes with\ndata as an asset. However, data differs from classical economic assets in terms\nof free duplication: there is no concept of limited supply since it can be\nreplicated at zero marginal cost. This distinction introduces fundamental\ndifferences between economic processes involving data and those concerning\nother assets.\n  We study a parallel to exchange (Arrow-Debreu) markets where data is the\nasset. Here, agents with datasets exchange data fairly and voluntarily, aiming\nfor mutual benefit without monetary compensation. This framework is\nparticularly relevant for non-profit organizations that seek to improve their\nML models through data exchange, yet are restricted from selling their data for\nprofit.\n  We propose a general framework for data exchange, built on two core\nprinciples: (i) fairness, ensuring that each agent receives utility\nproportional to their contribution to others; contributions are quantifiable\nusing standard credit-sharing functions like the Shapley value, and (ii)\nstability, ensuring that no coalition of agents can identify an exchange among\nthemselves which they unanimously prefer to the current exchange. We show that\nfair and stable exchanges exist for all monotone continuous utility functions.\nNext, we investigate the computational complexity of finding approximate fair\nand stable exchanges. We present a local search algorithm for instances with\nmonotone submodular utility functions, where each agent contributions are\nmeasured using the Shapley value.

    "abstract": "The energy-based dual-phase dynamics identification (EDDI) method is a new\ndata-driven technique for the discovery of equations of motion (EOMs) of\nstrongly nonlinear single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) oscillators. This research\nuses the EDDI method to obtain mathematical models for SDOF systems with\nclearance nonlinearities. The first key aspect of the EDDI method is that it\nrelates the kinetic energy of the system to the dissipated energy and the\nunderlying non-conservative forces acting on the oscillator. The second key\naspect is that the EOM is identified with only knowledge of the mass of the\noscillator and the transient response. The first phase of the EDDI method\nconstructs the dissipated energy from the kinetic energy, then identifies a\nmathematical model for the damping based on the dissipated energy. To achieve\nthis, the moments in time when the displacements are zero, where the mechanical\nand kinetic energies are equal, are used to compute the energy dissipated by\nthe damping of the system. The second phase begins by computing the\nconservative force acting on the oscillator from either a balance of the other\nforces in the system or through the Lagrange equation. Finally, the stiffness\nmodel is determined by solving a set of linear equations to construct a\nmathematical model for the conservative (elastic) force. The governing\nequations are discovered by incorporating both the damping and stiffness terms.\nThe method is demonstrated by employing analytical and real measured responses\nof nonlinear SDOF systems with different clearances nonlinearities, which shows\nthat the proposed approach is suitable for non-smooth mechanical systems as\nwell as smooth systems.",

Nevertheless, we\nfind that for $M_{Z^\\prime}>2.8$ TeV there remains a non-negligible region of\nallowed parameter space where the model significantly improves upon several\nStandard Model predictions for observables involving the $b \\rightarrow s l^+\nl^-$ transition. We estimate that the 3000 fb$^{-1}$ HL-LHC will extend this\nsensitivity to $M_{Z^\\prime}= 4.2$ TeV.",

It is\nimpossible for this self-improvement to create information that is not already\nin the model, so why should we expect that this will lead to improved\ncapabilities? We offer a new perspective on the capabilities of\nself-improvement through a lens we refer to as sharpening. Motivated by the\nobservation that language models are often better at verifying response quality\nthan they are at generating correct responses, we formalize self-improvement as\nusing the model itself as a verifier during post-training in order to\n``sharpen'' the model to one placing large mass on high-quality sequences,\nthereby amortizing the expensive inference-time computation of generating good\nsequences. We begin by introducing a new statistical framework for sharpening\nin which the learner aims to sharpen a pre-trained base policy via sample\naccess, and establish fundamental limits. Then we analyze two natural families\nof self-improvement algorithms based on SFT and RLHF. We find that (i) the\nSFT-based approach is minimax optimal whenever the initial model has sufficient\ncoverage, but (ii) the RLHF-based approach can improve over SFT-based\nself-improvement by leveraging online exploration, bypassing the need for\ncoverage. Finally, we empirically validate the sharpening mechanism via\ninference-time and amortization experiments. We view these findings as a\nstarting point toward a foundational understanding that can guide the design\nand evaluation of self-improvement algorithms.",

The screening\nof core excitons is an inherent many-body process that can reveal insight into\ncharge-transfer excitations and electronic correlations. Under non-equilibrium\nconditions such as after photoexcitation, however, core-exciton screening is\nstill not fully understood. Here we demonstrate the dynamic Coulomb screening\nof core excitons induced by photoexcited carriers by employing X-ray transient\nabsorption (XTA) spectroscopy with picosecond time resolution. Our\ninterpretation is supported by state-of-the-art ab initio theory, combining\nconstrained and real-time time-dependent density functional theory with\nmany-body perturbation theory. Using ZnO as an archetypal wide band-gap\nsemiconductor, we show that the Coulomb screening by photoexcited carriers at\nthe Zn K-edge leads to a decrease in the core-exciton binding energy, which\ndepends nonlinearly on both the excitation density and the distribution of\nphotoexcited carriers in reciprocal space. The effect of Coulomb screening\ndominates over Pauli blocking in the XTA spectra. We show that dynamic\ncore-exciton screening is also observed at other X-ray absorption edges and\ntheoretically predict the effect of core-exciton screening on the femtosecond\ntime scale for the case of ZnO, a major step towards hard X-ray excitonics.

Extensive evaluations on Cityscapes\nand ADE20K, with three state-of-the-art Vision Transformer architectures :\nSegFormer, Swin Transformer, and Twins demonstrate that CWFA-enhanced models\nsignificantly improve robustness without affecting clean data performance. For\ninstance, on Cityscapes, a CWFA-augmented SegFormer-B1 model yields up to 27.7%\nmIoU robustness gain on impulse noise compared to the non-augmented\nSegFormer-B1. Furthermore, CWFA-augmented SegFormer-B5 achieves a new\nstate-of-the-art 84.3% retention rate, a 0.7% improvement over the recently\npublished FAN+STL.",

    "abstract": "Driven by recent breakthrough advances in neural representation learning,\napproximate near-neighbor (ANN) search over vector embeddings has emerged as a\ncritical computational workload. With the introduction of the seminal\nHierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) algorithm, graph-based indexes have\nestablished themselves as the overwhelmingly dominant paradigm for efficient\nand scalable ANN search. As the name suggests, HNSW searches a layered\nhierarchical graph to quickly identify neighborhoods of similar points to a\ngiven query vector. But is this hierarchy even necessary? A rigorous\nexperimental analysis to answer this question would provide valuable insights\ninto the nature of algorithm design for ANN search and motivate directions for\nfuture work in this increasingly crucial domain. We conduct an extensive\nbenchmarking study covering more large-scale datasets than prior investigations\nof this question. We ultimately find that a flat navigable small world graph\ngraph retains all of the benefits of HNSW on high-dimensional datasets, with\nlatency and recall performance essentially \\emph{identical} to the original\nalgorithm but with less memory overhead. Furthermore, we go a step further and\nstudy \\emph{why} the hierarchy of HNSW provides no benefit in high dimensions,\nhypothesizing that navigable small world graphs contain a well-connected,\nfrequently traversed ``highway\" of hub nodes that maintain the same purported\nfunction as the hierarchical layers. We present compelling empirical evidence\nthat the \\emph{Hub Highway Hypothesis} holds for real datasets and investigate\nthe mechanisms by which the highway forms. The implications of this hypothesis\nmay also provide future research directions in developing enhancements to\ngraph-based ANN search.",

    "abstract": "Higher-dimensional sliding puzzles are constructed on the vertices of a\n$d$-dimensional hypercube, where $2^d-l$ vertices are distinctly coloured.\nRings with the same colours are initially set randomly on the vertices of the\nhypercube. The goal of the puzzle is to move each of the $2^d-l$ rings to\npre-defined target vertices on the cube. In this setting, the $k$-rule\nconstraint represents a generalisation of edge collision for the movement of\ncolours between vertices, allowing movement only when a hypercube face of\ndimension $k$ containing a ring is completely free of other rings. Starting\nfrom an initial configuration, what is the minimum number of moves needed to\nmake ring colours match the vertex colours? An algorithm that provides us with\nsuch a number is called God's algorithm. When such an algorithm exists, it does\nnot have a polynomial time complexity, at least in the case of the 15-puzzle\ncorresponding to $k=1$ in the cubical puzzle. This paper presents a\ncomprehensive computational study of different scenarios of the\nhigher-dimensional puzzle. A benchmark of three computational techniques, an\nexact algorithm (the A* search) and two approximately optimal search techniques\n(an evolutionary algorithm (EA) and reinforcement learning (RL)) is presented\nin this work. The experiments show that all three methods can successfully\nsolve the puzzle of dimension three for different face dimensions and across\nvarious difficulty levels. When the dimension increases, the A* search fails,\nand RL and EA methods can still provide a generally acceptable solution, i.e. a\ndistribution of a number of moves with a median value of less than $30$.\nOverall, the EA method consistently requires less computational time, while\nfailing in most cases to minimise the number of moves for the puzzle dimensions\n$d=4$ and $d=5$.",

Our\nframework, grounded in measurement theory from the social sciences, extends the\nwork of Adcock & Collier (2001) in which the authors formalized valid\nmeasurement of concepts in political science via three processes: systematizing\nbackground concepts, operationalizing systematized concepts via annotation\nprocedures, and applying those procedures to instances.

This involves\nboth descriptive reasoning about particular instances and inferential reasoning\nabout underlying populations, which is the purview of statistics. By placing\nmany disparate-seeming GenAI evaluation practices on a common footing, our\nframework enables individual evaluations to be better understood, interrogated\nfor reliability and validity, and meaningfully compared.

Finally, the third phase\nintegrates models from the previous stages and employs a Kolmogorov-Arnold\nNetwork (KAN) to classify five distinct sleep stages. Additionally, data\naugmentation techniques, particularly SMOTE, are used in enhancing\nclassification capabilities for underrepresented stages like N1.

    "abstract": "Diffusive transport processes in magnetized plasmas are highly anisotropic,\nwith fast parallel transport along the magnetic field lines sometimes faster\nthan perpendicular transport by orders of magnitude. This constitutes a major\nchallenge for describing non-grid-aligned magnetic structures in Eulerian\n(grid-based) simulations. The present paper describes and validates a new\nmethod for parallel diffusion in magnetized plasmas based on the anti-symmetry\nrepresentation [Halpern and Waltz, Phys. Plasmas 25, 060703 (2018)]. In the\nanti-symmetry formalism, diffusion manifests as a flow operator involving the\nlogarithmic derivative of the transported quantity. Qualitative plane wave\nanalysis shows that the new operator naturally yields better discrete spectral\nresolution compared to its conventional counterpart. Numerical simulations\ncomparing the new method against existing finite difference methods are carried\nout, showing significant improvement. In particular, we find that combining\nanti-symmetry with finite differences in diagonally staggered grids essentially\neliminates the so-called \"artificial numerical diffusion\" that affects\nconventional finite difference and finite volume methods.",

However, these methods consider a narrow notion of\nredundancy, focusing on pairwise correlations between features. To address this\nlimitation, we formalize the notion of embedding space redundancy and introduce\nredundancy measures that capture more complex, higher-order dependencies. We\nmathematically analyze the relationships between these metrics, and empirically\nmeasure these redundancies in the embedding spaces of common SSL methods. Based\non our findings, we propose Self Supervised Learning with Predictability\nMinimization (SSLPM) as a method for reducing redundancy in the embedding\nspace. SSLPM combines an encoder network with a predictor engaging in a\ncompetitive game of reducing and exploiting dependencies respectively. We\ndemonstrate that SSLPM is competitive with state-of-the-art methods and find\nthat the best performing SSL methods exhibit low embedding space redundancy,\nsuggesting that even methods without explicit redundancy reduction mechanisms\nperform redundancy reduction implicitly.",

    "abstract": "Binary black hole (BBH) evolution in the discs of active galactic nuclei\n(AGN) is a promising channel for gravitational wave (GW)-driven mergers. It is\nhowever unclear whether binaries interacting with the surrounding disc undergo\norbital contraction or expansion. We develop a simple analytic model of\naccreting BBHs in AGN discs to follow the orbital evolution from the\ndisc-dominated regime at large separations into the GW-driven regime at small\nseparations (the coupled `disc+GW'-driven evolution). We obtain that accreting\nbinaries expand in thick discs with aspect ratio greater than a critical value\n($> h_\\mathrm{crit}$); whereas accreting binaries contract and eventually merge\nin thin discs ($< h_\\mathrm{crit}$). Interestingly, accreting BBHs can\nexperience faster mergers compared to non-accreting counterparts, with a\nnon-monotonic dependence on the disc aspect ratio. The orbital contraction is\nusually coupled with eccentricity growth in the disc-dominated regime, which\nlead to accelerated inspirals in the GW-driven regime. We quantify the\nresulting BBH merger timescales in AGN discs ($\\tau_\\mathrm{merger} \\sim 10^5 -\n10^7$ yr) and estimate the associated GW merger rates ($\\mathcal{R} \\sim (0.2 -\n5) \\, \\text{Gpc}^{-3} \\text{yr}^{-1}$). Overall, accreting binaries may\nefficiently contract and merge in thin discs, hence this particular BBH-in-AGN\nchannel may provide a non-negligible contribution to the observed GW merger\nevent rate.",

    "abstract": "We consider a model describing a system where the superconductivity competes\nwith the overscreened Kondo effect. The model consists of a single\nspin$-\\frac{1}{2}$ quantum impurity at the edge of a quantum wire where\nspin$-1$ bulk fermions interact attractively, generating a (superconducting)\nmass gap. The competition between the Kondo screening and the superconductivity\nleads to a rich phase structure. We find that for strong Kondo coupling, there\nis a regime of phase space where the Kondo phase is stable with the impurity\n\\textit{overscreened} by a multiparticle Kondo effect, and a Kondo scale is\ndynamically generated. When the bulk and boundary interaction strength are\ncomparable, we find that a midgap state appears in the spectrum and screens the\nimpurity, while in the ground state, the impurity is unscreened. This midgap\nstate is akin to the Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) states that exist in the entire\nphase space in the BCS superconductor. Moreover, when the bulk superconducting\ninteraction strength is stronger than the boundary Kondo interaction strength,\nthe impurity can no longer be screened. Further, between the Kondo and YSR\nphases, we find a novel phase where, while the Kondo cloud overscreens the\nimpurity, a boundary excitation exists that has vanishing energy in the\nthermodynamic limit. Similar phase diagrams that result from competition\nbetween different mechanisms were found for other models, too: the dissipative\nKondo system, where dissipation competes with screening; the Kondo impurity\ncoupled to spin-1/2 attractively interacting fermions where condensation\ncompetes with screening; and the XXX-Kondo model, where the lattice cutoff and\nthe bulk spin interaction compete with screening.",

    "abstract": "Observations of tidal disruption events (TDEs) on a timescale of years after\nthe main flare show evidence of continued activity in the form of optical/UV\nemission, quasi-periodic eruptions, and delayed radio flares. Motivated by\nthis, we explore the time evolution of these disks using semi-analytic models\nto follow the changing disk properties and feeding rate to the central black\nhole (BH). We find that thermal instabilities typically begin $\\sim100\\,{\\rm\ndays}$ after the TDE, causing the disk to cycle between high and low accretion\nstates for up to $\\sim10\\,{\\rm yrs}$. The high state is super-Eddington, which\nmay be associated with outflows that eject $\\sim10^{-3}-10^{-1}\\,M_\\odot$ over\n$\\sim1-2\\,{\\rm days}$ with a range of velocities of $\\sim0.03-0.3c$. Collision\nbetween these mass ejections may cause radio flares. In the low state, the\naccretion rate slowly grows over months to years as continued fallback\naccretion builds the disk's mass. In this phase, the disk has a luminosity of\n$\\sim10^{41}-10^{42}\\,{\\rm erg\\,s^{-1}}$ in the optical/UV as seen in some\nlate-time observations. Although the accretion cycles we find occur for a\ntypical $\\alpha$-disk, in nature the disk could be stabilized by other effects\nsuch as the disk's magnetic field or heating from fallback accretion, the\nlatter of which we explore.

We\npresent near-infrared interferometric imaging of the circumstellar environment\nof the dust-enshrouded RSG WOH G64 in the Large Magellanic Cloud. WOH G64 was\nobserved with the GRAVITY instrument at ESO's Very Large Telescope\nInterferometer (VLTI) at 2.0--2.45 micron. We succeeded in imaging the\ninnermost circumstellar environment of WOH G64 -- the first interferometric\nimaging of an RSG outside the Milky Way. The reconstructed image reveals\nelongated compact emission with a semimajor and semiminor axis of ~2 and ~1.5\nmas (~13 and 9 stellar radii), respectively. The GRAVITY data show that the\nstellar flux contribution at 2.2 micron at the time of our observations in 2020\nis much lower than predicted by the optically and geometrically thick dust\ntorus model based on the VLTI/MIDI data taken in 2005 and 2007. We found a\nsignificant change in the near-infrared spectrum of WOH G64: while the\n(spectro)photometric data taken at 1--2.5 micron before 2003 show the spectrum\nof the central RSG with H2O absorption, the spectra and JHK' photometric data\ntaken after 2016 are characterized by a monotonically rising continuum with\nvery weak signatures of H2O. This spectral change likely took place between\nDecember 2009 and 2016. On the other hand, the mid-infrared spectrum obtained\nin 2022 with VLT/VISIR agrees well with the spectra obtained before 2007. The\ncompact emission imaged with GRAVITY and the near-infrared spectral change\nsuggest the formation of hot new dust close to the star, which gives rise to\nthe monotonically rising near-infrared continuum and the high obscuration of\nthe central star. The elongation of the emission may be due to the presence of\na bipolar outflow or effects of an unseen companion.",

In\nthis work, we investigate the fate of the measurement-induced phase transition\nin a periodically driven free-fermionic quantum system, where the hopping\namplitude is modulated periodically in time using a square pulse. In the\nhigh-frequency limit, a renormalization group analysis of the non-Hermitian\nquantum sine-Gordon model [as proposed in {Phys. Rev. X 11, 041004 (2021)}]\nreveals that if the hopping amplitude is varied symmetrically around zero, the\nsystem always favors the area-law phase, where the steady-state entanglement\nentropy is independent of subsystem size. In contrast, asymmetry in the drive\namplitudes tends to promote entanglement growth. Furthermore, numerical\nevidence for the system sizes accessible to us suggests that decreasing the\ndrive frequency typically favors entanglement growth. For such driven systems,\nat least for reasonably small frequency regimes, as a function of measurement\nstrength, we observe a potential signature of a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless\n(BKT) phase transition between a gapless critical phase, characterized by\nlogarithmic growth of entanglement entropy with subsystem size, and a gapped\narea-law phase. However, it is almost impossible to rule out the possibility\nthat the transition observed here is not an actual thermodynamic transition,\nbut a finite-size crossover between logarithmic to area law entanglement phase.\nEven in that scenario, the critical length scale beyond which the area law\nphase prevails increases with the increasing time period of driving. On the\nother hand, for a symmetric drive, the system consistently exhibits an area-law\nphase, regardless of the driving frequency.",

We show that\n(meta)stable vacua can form if a super no-scale one-loop potential combines\nwith generic two-loop contributions to the vacuum energy, in a manner analogous\nto Banks-Zaks fixed points. Weak string coupling and scale separation arise\nfrom the accidental smallness of the one-loop term, which receives\ncontributions only from massive states, relative to the two-loop term. We\nprovide a proof of concept of this mechanism in explicit non-supersymmetric\nheterotic toroidal orbifolds by balancing the complete one-loop contribution\nagainst the estimated two-loop term and numerically minimizing the resulting\neffective potential in a restricted sector of moduli space. We note that this\nmechanism is generically possible within any fundamental theory that has a\none-loop energy that gets contributions only from massive modes.",

    "abstract": "A large population of binary systems in the Universe emitting gravitational\nwaves (GW) would produce a stochastic noise, known as the gravitational wave\nbackground (GWB). The properties of the GWB directly depend on the attributes\nof its constituents. If the binary systems are in eccentric orbits, it is well\nestablished that the GW power they radiate strongly depends on their\ninstantaneous orbital phase. Consequently, their power spectrum varies over\ntime, and the resulting GWB can appear nonstationary. In this work, we estimate\nthe amplitude of time-dependent fluctuations in the GWB power spectrum as a\nfunction of the eccentricity of the binaries. Specifically, we focus on the GWB\nproduced by a population of supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHB) that\nshould be observable by pulsar timing arrays (PTA). We show that a large\npopulation of homogeneously distributed equal SMBHBs produces nonstationary\nfeatures that are undetectable by current PTA datasets. However, using more\nrealistic and astrophysically motivated populations of SMBHBs, we show that the\nnonstationarity might become very large and detectable, especially in the case\nof more massive and eccentric populations. In particular, when one binary is\nslightly brighter than the GWB, we demonstrate that time fluctuations can\nbecome significant. This is also true for individual binary systems with a low\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR) relative to the GWB (SNR $\\approx$ 1), which\nstandard data analysis methods would struggle to detect. The detection of\nnonstationary features in the GWB could indicate the presence of some\nrelatively bright GW sources in eccentric orbits, offering new insights into\nthe origins of the signal.",

    "abstract": "We present an efficient method for extracting energy levels from lattice QCD\ncorrelation functions by computing the eigenvalues of the transfer matrix\nassociated with the lattice QCD Hamiltonian. While mathematically and\nnumerically equivalent to the recently introduced Lanczos procedure, our\napproach introduces a novel prescription for removing spurious eigenvalues\nusing a kernel density estimator (KDE) and Gaussian-convoluted histogram\nmethod. This strategy yields a robust and stable estimate of the energy\nspectrum, outperforming the Cullum-Willoughby filtering technique in\nefficiency. In addition, we detail how this method can be applied to extract\noverlap factors from two-point correlation functions, as well as matrix\nelements from three-point functions with a current insertion. Furthermore, we\nextend the methodology to accommodate correlation matrices constructed from a\nvariational basis of operators, with its Block formulation. We demonstrate the\nefficacy of this framework by computing the two lowest energy levels for a\nbroad range of hadrons, including several nuclei. Although the signal-to-noise\nratio is not significantly improved, the extracted energy levels are found to\nbe more reliable than those obtained with conventional techniques. Within a\ngiven statistical ensemble, the proposed method effectively captures both\nstatistical uncertainties and systematic errors, including those arising from\nthe choice of fitting window, making it a robust and practical tool for lattice\nQCD analysis.",

    "abstract": "MIR spectra imply considerable chemical diversity in the inner regions of\nprotoplanetary discs: some are H2O-dominated, others by CO2. Sublimating ices\nfrom radially drifting dust grains are often invoked to explain some of this\ndiversity, particularly the H2O-rich discs. We use a 1D protoplanetary disc\nevolution code to model how radially drifting dust grains that transport ices\ninwards to snowlines impact the chemistry of the inner regions of\nprotoplanetary discs. We explore differences between smooth discs and those\nwhere radial drift is impeded by dust trapping outside gas gaps and quantify\nthe effects of gap location and formation time. Discs evolve through an initial\nH2O-rich phase due to sublimating ices, followed by a CO2-rich phase as H2O\nvapour advects onto the star and CO2 advects into the inner disc from its\nsnowline. The inclusion of traps hastens the transition between the phases,\nraising the CO2/H2O ratio; gaps opened early or close-in produce lower\nincreases by blocking more CO2 ice from reaching the inner disc. This leads to\na potential correlation between CO2/H2O and gap location that occurs on Myr\ntimescales for fiducial parameters. We produce synthetic spectra from the\nmodels which we analyse with 0D LTE slab models to understand how this\nevolution may be expressed observationally. Whether the evolution can be\nretrieved depends on the contribution of dust grains to the optical depth: dust\nthat couples to the gas after crossing the H2O snowline can add to the\ncontinuum optical depth and obscure the delivered H2O, largely hiding the\nevolution in its visible column density. However, the CO2/H2O visible column\ndensity ratio is only weakly sensitive to dust continuum obscuration. This\nsuggests it may be a clearer tracer of the impact of transport on chemistry\nthan individual column densities for spectra that show weak features probing\ndeep enough in the disc. (Abridged)",

    "abstract": "The coset construction of two-dimensional conformal field theory (2D CFT)\ndefines a 2D CFT by taking the quotient of two previously known chiral\nalgebras. In this work, we use the methods of non-abelian (non-invertible)\nanyon condensation to describe 2D topological cosets, defined by the special\ncase where the quotient of chiral algebras is a conformal embedding. In this\ncase, the coset has zero central charge, and the coset theory is thus purely\ntopological. Using non-abelian anyon condensation we describe in general the\nspectrum of line and local operators as well as their fusion, operator product\nexpansion, and the action of the lines on local operators. An important\napplication of our results is to QCD$_{2}$ with massless fermions in any\nrepresentation that leads to a gapped phase, where topological cosets\n(conjecturally) describe the infrared fixed point. We discuss several such\nexamples in detail. For instance, we find that the $Spin(8)_{1}/SU(3)_{3}$ and\n$Spin(16)_{1}/Spin(9)_{2}$ topological cosets appearing at the infrared fixed\npoint of appropriate QCD$_{2}$ theories are described by $\\mathbb{Z}_{2} \\times\n\\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ triality and $\\mathbb{Z}_{2} \\times \\mathrm{Rep(S_{3})}$ fusion\ncategories respectively.

There are presently three proposed hypotheses to explain the detection\nof excess lithium in white dwarf photospheres: Big Bang and Galactic\nnucleosynthesis, continental crust, and an exomoon formed from spalled ring\nmaterial. We present new observations of three previously known\nlithium-polluted white dwarfs (WD J1824+1213, WD J2317+1830, and LHS 2534), and\none with metal pollution without lithium (SDSS J1636+1619).

    "abstract": "The statistics of particles and extended excitations, such as loops and\nmembranes, are fundamental to modern condensed matter physics, high-energy\nphysics, and quantum information science, yet a comprehensive lattice-level\nframework for computing them remains elusive. In this work, we develop a\nuniversal microscopic method to determine the generalized statistics of Abelian\nexcitations on lattices of arbitrary dimension, and demonstrate it by deriving\nthe statistics of particles, loops, and membranes in up to three spatial\ndimensions. Our approach constructs a sequence of local unitary operators whose\nmany-body Berry phase encodes the desired statistical invariant. The required\nsequence is generated automatically from the Smith normal form of locality\nconstraints and therefore needs no extra physical input. We prove that the\nresulting invariants are quantized, provide an algorithm that computes them\nefficiently, and show how they unify familiar braiding and fusion data of\nparticles while also uncovering new self- and mutual-statistics of loop and\nmembrane excitations. We further demonstrate that each statistical invariant\ncorresponds to an 't Hooft anomaly of a generalized symmetry; we show that a\nnon-trivial invariant both (i) obstructs gauging that symmetry and (ii) forbids\nany short-range-entangled (symmetry-preserving) ground state. This establishes\na precise connection between microscopic lattice anomalies and many-body\ndynamics, providing a generalization of the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis theorem that\nconstrains a wide class of quantum lattice systems.",

    "abstract": "JWST has revealed a population of compact `Little Red Dots' (LRDs) at\n$z\\gtrsim4$, with red rest-frame optical and blue UV colors. These objects are\nlikely compact dusty starbursts or heavily reddened AGNs, playing a pivotal\nrole in early black hole growth, dust production, and stellar assembly. We\nintroduce a new photometric selection to identify LRDs over a broad range in\nredshifts and rest-frame UV-to-NIR colors enabling a more complete census of\nthe population. This method identifies 248 LRDs with F444W$<27$ mag over 263\narcmin$^2$ in the JADES, PRIMER-COSMOS, and UDS fields with MIRI coverage,\nincreasing the number density by $\\times$1.7 compared to previous samples,\nsuggesting that previous census were underestimated. Most LRDs are detected in\nMIRI/F770W but only 7% (17) are detected in F1800W. We use MIRI-based\nrest-frame [1$-$3 $\\mu$m] colors to trace dust emission. F1800W-detected LRDs\nhave a median [1$-$3 $\\mu$m]$=1.5$ mag, with a broad scatter indicative of\ndiverse dust emission properties. About 20% exhibit [1$-$3 $\\mu$m]$<1$ mag\ncolors consistent with negligible dust emission, but the majority show\nsignificant dust emission at 3 $\\mu$m (f$^{\\rm dust}_{3\\mu m}\\lesssim0.8$) from\nthe galaxy ISM or a hot-dust-deficient AGN torus. A correlation between bluer\nUV-to-NIR colors and stronger IR emission suggests that the bluest LRDs may\nresemble unobscured QSOs. We report a LRD at $z_{\\rm spec}=3.1386$, detected in\nMIRI, Spitzer/MIPS, and Herschel/PACS. Its IR SED rises steeply at\n$\\lambda_{\\rm rest}>6~\\mu$m and peaks near $\\sim40~\\mu$m, providing the first\ndirect evidence of warm dust emission (T$=50-100$ K) in a LRD.",

We also confirm that ELGs exhibit\nweaker non-linear redshift-space distortions (``fingers-of-God''), suggesting\nthat a significant fraction of their data should be perturbative. We find that\nthe response of EFT parameters to galaxy selection is sensitive to assumptions\nabout baryonic feedback, suggesting that a detailed understanding of feedback\nprocesses is necessary for robust predictions of EFT parameters.

Then, in the second stage, one computes correlation functions using\nwavefunction coefficients as vertices. For massless fields, loop corrections in\nthe first stage are free of infrared (IR) divergences, which leads to the\nquestion of how this matches the well-known IR behavior of correlators obtained\nvia other methods.

We validate VLsI across ten\nchallenging vision-language benchmarks, achieving notable performance gains\n(11.0% for 2B and 17.4% for 7B) over GPT-4V without the need for model scaling,\nmerging, or architectural changes.",

To address this, we propose\nWorld-consistent Video Diffusion (WVD), a novel framework that incorporates\nexplicit 3D supervision using XYZ images, which encode global 3D coordinates\nfor each image pixel. More specifically, we train a diffusion transformer to\nlearn the joint distribution of RGB and XYZ frames. This approach supports\nmulti-task adaptability via a flexible inpainting strategy. For example, WVD\ncan estimate XYZ frames from ground-truth RGB or generate novel RGB frames\nusing XYZ projections along a specified camera trajectory. In doing so, WVD\nunifies tasks like single-image-to-3D generation, multi-view stereo, and\ncamera-controlled video generation. Our approach demonstrates competitive\nperformance across multiple benchmarks, providing a scalable solution for\n3D-consistent video and image generation with a single pretrained model.",

Recent efforts have been made to tackle this issue by\npruning visual tokens early within the language model. Most existing works use\nattention scores between text and visual tokens to assess the importance of\nvisual tokens. However, in this study, we first analyze the text-visual\nattention in the language model and find that this score is not an ideal\nindicator for token pruning. Based on the analysis, We propose VisPruner, a\nplug-and-play method that utilizes visual cues for more effective token pruning\nin LVLMs. Specifically, we first use visual attention to select a limited\nnumber of significant tokens. Then, we remove duplicate tokens from the\nremaining ones based on their similarity. By retaining diverse tokens alongside\nthe initially selected important tokens, we maximally preserve the visual\ninformation of the input image. Experimental results demonstrate that our\nVisPruner sustains strong performance across various VLM architectures and\nreduction ratios, significantly outperforming existing methods based on\ntext-visual attention. Notably, without any training, VisPruner can reduce the\nFLOPs of LLaVA-1.5-7B by 91% and inference latency by 75%, while maintaining\ncomparable performance.

Generally, our results provide\na route for deducing the topology in real materials that exhibit the Euler\ninvariant by analyzing bulk electrical currents.",

To enhance understanding\nbeyond visual representation, recent approaches extend Gaussian Splatting with\nsemantic vision-language features, enabling open-set tasks. Typically, these\nlanguage features are aggregated from multiple 2D views, however, existing\nmethods rely on cumbersome techniques, resulting in high computational costs\nand longer training times.\n  In this work, we show that the complicated pipelines for language 3D Gaussian\nSplatting are simply unnecessary. Instead, we follow a probabilistic\nformulation of Language Gaussian Splatting and apply Occam's razor to the task\nat hand, leading to a highly efficient weighted multi-view feature aggregation\ntechnique. Doing so offers us state-of-the-art results with a speed-up of two\norders of magnitude without any compression, allowing for easy scene\nmanipulation.

This\ncharacteristic renders them an effective benchmark for assessing the\nunder-explored capability of physical commonsense understanding in video LLMs.\nIn this paper, we propose PhysGame as a pioneering benchmark to evaluate\nphysical commonsense violations in gameplay videos. PhysGame comprises 880\nvideos associated with glitches spanning four fundamental domains (i.e.,\nmechanics, kinematics, optics, and material properties) and across 12 distinct\nphysical commonsense.

To\nbridge this gap, we curate an instruction tuning dataset PhysInstruct with\n140,057 question-answering pairs to facilitate physical commonsense learning.\nIn addition, we also propose a preference optimization dataset PhysDPO with\n34,358 training pairs, where the dis-preferred responses are generated\nconditioned on misleading titles (i.e., meta information hacking), fewer frames\n(i.e., temporal hacking) and lower spatial resolutions (i.e., spatial hacking).\nBased on the suite of datasets, we propose PhysVLM as a physical\nknowledge-enhanced video LLM.

To investigate how patient-level covariates influence the likelihood\nof treatment transitions among DMTs, we adopt a Markovian framework, Sparse\nMatrix Estimation with Covariate-Based Transitions in Markov Chain Modeling\n(SMART-MC), in which the transition probabilities are modeled as functions of\nthese covariates. Modeling real-world treatment transitions under this\nframework presents several challenges, including ensuring parameter\nidentifiability and handling sparse transitions without overfitting. To address\nidentifiability, we constrain each transition-specific covariate coefficient\nvectors to have a fixed L2 norm.

    "abstract": "We studied bent radio sources within X-ray galaxy groups in the COSMOS and\nXMM-LSS fields, using radio data from the MeerKAT International GHz Tiered\nExtragalactic Explorations data release 1 (MIGHTEE-DR1) at 1.2-1.3 GHz (angular\nresolutions of 8.9\" and 5\"; <rms> ~ 3.5 and 5.5 uJy/beam). Bent radio active\ngalactic nuclei (AGN) were identified via visual inspection. Our analysis\nincluded 19 bent radio AGN in the COSMOS field and 17 in the XMM-LSS field\nwhich lie within X-ray galaxy groups (2x10^13 >= M200c/Msun = 3x10^14). We\ninvestigated the relationship between their bending angle (BA) - the angle\nformed by the jets or lobes of two-sided radio sources associated with AGN -\nand properties of their host galaxies and large-scale environment probed by the\nX-ray galaxy groups. Our key findings are: a) In the XMM-LSS field, we observed\na strong correlation between the linear projected size of the bent AGN, the\ngroup halo mass, and the projected distance from the group centre. This trend,\nconsistent with previous studies, was not detected in the COSMOS sample. b) The\nBA is a function of environmental density, with the type of medium playing a\nsignificant role. Additionally, at z <= 0.5 we found a higher number of bent\nsources (BA <= 160deg) compared to higher redshifts (z ~ 1), by a factor of\n>1.5. This trend aligns with magnetohydrodynamic simulations, which suggest\nthat denser environments and longer interaction times at lower redshifts\ncontribute to this effect. Comparison with the literature suggests that jet\nbending in galaxy groups within the redshift range 0.1 < z < 1.2 is primarily\ndriven by ram pressure exerted on the jets, which occurs during quiescent\nphases of AGN activity. This study underscores the role of environmental\ninteractions in shaping the morphology of radio AGN within galaxy groups,\nproviding insights into the interplay between large-scale structure and AGN\nphysics.",

    "abstract": "Diffusion-based models have recently revolutionized image generation,\nachieving unprecedented levels of fidelity. However, consistent generation of\nhigh-quality images remains challenging partly due to the lack of conditioning\nmechanisms for perceptual quality. In this work, we propose methods to\nintegrate image quality assessment (IQA) models into diffusion-based\ngenerators, enabling quality-aware image generation. We show that diffusion\nmodels can learn complex qualitative relationships from both IQA models'\noutputs and internal activations. First, we experiment with gradient-based\nguidance to optimize image quality directly and show this method has limited\ngeneralizability. To address this, we introduce IQA-Adapter, a novel framework\nthat conditions generation on target quality levels by learning the implicit\nrelationship between images and quality scores. When conditioned on high target\nquality, IQA-Adapter can shift the distribution of generated images towards a\nhigher-quality subdomain, and, inversely, it can be used as a degradation\nmodel, generating progressively more distorted images when provided with a\nlower-quality signal. Under high-quality condition, IQA-Adapter achieves up to\na 10% improvement across multiple objective metrics, as confirmed by a user\npreference study, while preserving generative diversity and content.\nFurthermore, we extend IQA-Adapter to a reference-based conditioning scenario,\nutilizing the rich activation space of IQA models to transfer highly specific,\ncontent-agnostic qualitative features between images.",

Using damage (deficit\nemergence) and repair (deficit recovery) transitions we estimated changes to\nrobustness and resilience, respectively.

Remarkably,\nthese declines caused a tipping point in health near age 75, when damage and\nrepair rates are equal. Beyond this tipping point, the ongoing loss of both\nrobustness and resilience leads to a sharp increase in the FI and a\ncommensurate increase in risk of mortality.

This alignment is a contamination for\ncosmic-shear measurements as one needs to disentangle correlations induced by\nexternal lensing effects from those intrinsically present in galaxies. We\nconstrain the amplitude of intrinsic alignment and test models by making use of\nthe overlap between the Ultraviolet Near-Infrared Optical Northern Survey\n(UNIONS) covering $3500 \\, \\mathrm{deg}^2$, and spectroscopic data from the\nBaryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS/eBOSS). By comparing our results\nto measurements from other lensing surveys on the same spectroscopic tracers,\nwe can test the reliability of these estimates and verify they are not survey\ndependent. We measure projected correlation functions between positions and\nellipticities, which we model with perturbation theory to constrain the\ncommonly used non-linear alignment model and its higher-order expansion. Using\nthe non-linear alignment model, we obtain a $13\\sigma$ detection with CMASS\ngalaxies, a $3\\sigma$ detection with LRGs, and a detection compatible with the\nnull hypothesis for ELGs. We test the tidal alignment and tidal torque model, a\nhigher-order alignment model, which we find to be in good agreement with the\nnon-linear alignment prediction and for which we can constrain the second-order\nparameters. We show a strong scaling of our intrinsic alignment amplitude with\nluminosity. We demonstrate that the UNIONS sample is robust against systematic\ncontributions, particularly concerning PSF biases. We reached a reasonable\nagreement when comparing our measurements to other lensing samples for the same\nspectroscopic samples.

This paper focuses on effectively transferring control logic\nfrom a source control system to a target control system while providing\napproximately similar behavioral guarantees in both domains. However, in the\nabsence of a complete characterization of behavioral specifications, this\nproblem cannot be captured in terms of loss functions.

In practice,\nhowever, DETR generates hundreds of predictions that far outnumber the actual\nnumber of objects present in an image. This raises the question: can we trust\nand use all of these predictions? Addressing this concern, we present empirical\nevidence highlighting how different predictions within the same image play\ndistinct roles, resulting in varying reliability levels across those\npredictions. More specifically, while multiple predictions are often made for a\nsingle object, our findings show that most often one such prediction is\nwell-calibrated, and the others are poorly calibrated. Based on these insights,\nwe demonstrate that identifying a reliable subset of DETR's predictions is\ncrucial for accurately assessing the reliability of the model at both object\nand image levels.\n  Building on this viewpoint, we first address the shortcomings of widely used\nperformance and calibration metrics, such as average precision and various\nforms of expected calibration error. Specifically, they are inadequate for\ndetermining which subset of DETR's predictions should be trusted and utilized.\nIn response, we present Object-level Calibration Error (OCE), which assesses\nthe calibration quality more effectively and is suitable for both ranking\ndifferent models and identifying the most reliable predictions within a\nspecific model. As a final contribution, we introduce a post hoc uncertainty\nquantification (UQ) framework that predicts the accuracy of the model on a\nper-image basis.

    "abstract": "We analyse the implications of the presence of spatial curvature in modified\ngravity models. As it is well known, the current standard cosmological model,\nthe $\\Lambda$CDM, is assumed to be spatially flat based on the results of many\nexperiments. However, this statement does not necessarily hold for a modified\ngravity (MG) model, and this leads to couplings of the spatial curvature with\nthe parameters of the chosen cosmological model. In this paper, we illustrate\nthe theoretical development of how spatial curvature affects the equations of\nmotion at linear order for scalar and tensor perturbations modes using a\nmodel-independent approach based on the formalism of the Effective Field Theory\n(EFT) of dark energy (DE). The results show that spatial curvature gives rise\nto a coupling with the scalar field perturbations and the functions\nparameterizing the model.",

To solve this problem, convergent algorithms are developed with\nboth single-loop and stochastic variants.

The proposed algorithms adaptively adjust to both constraint and\nobjective values, eliminating the need to solve different subproblems at\ndifferent stages of constraint satisfaction.

However, measuring these quantum\nstates with traditional homodyne techniques poses a challenge, as outcoupling\nfrom the cavity disturbs the state's quantum properties. Here, we propose a\nframework for reconstructing quantum states generated inside nonlinear optical\ncavities and observing their dynamics. Our approach directly imprints the field\ndistribution of the cavity quantum state onto the statistics of bistable cavity\nsteady-states. We propose a protocol to fully reconstruct the cavity quantum\nstate, visualized in 2D phase-space, by measuring the changes in the\nsteady-state statistics induced by a probe signal injected into the cavity\nunder different condition. We experimentally demonstrate our approach in a\ndegenerate optical parametric oscillator, generating and reconstructing the\nquasi-probability distribution of different quantum states. As a validation, we\nreconstruct the Husimi Q function of the cavity squeezed vacuum state. In\naddition, we observe the evolution of the quantum vacuum state inside the\ncavity as it undergoes phase-sensitive amplification. By enabling generation\nand measurement of quantum states in a single nonlinear optical cavity, our\nmethod realizes an \"end-to-end\" approach to intracavity quantum tomography,\nfacilitating studies of quantum optical phenomena in nonlinear\ndriven-dissipative systems.",

In\nthis formalism, we are able to derive directly the full multipolar structure of\nany solution from the multipole expansion of the energy-momentum tensor, in\ncomplete analogy to Newtonian gravity. In particular, we identify the\nrecurrence relations that allow obtaining the multipolar structure of the Kerr\nand the Myers-Perry black hole solutions, defining source multipoles in a\nGeneral Relativity context for the first time. For these solutions, we are able\nto resum the energy-momentum tensor in momentum space at all orders in the\nangular momentum, and compute its real-space version. In the Kerr case we\nexactly obtain the matter source found by Israel, namely an equatorial,\npressureless thin disk rotating at superluminal speed. For Myers-Perry in five\ndimensions, the matter distribution is a three-ellipsoid in four spatial\ndimensions with nontrivial stresses. Remarkably, for any dimensions, the matter\nconfiguration is a lower-dimensional distribution which has the same\nsingularity structure as the fully non-linear black-hole solution. Our\nformalism underscores the advantage of working in momentum space to generate\nnontrivial matter sources for non-linear spacetimes, and could be used to\nconstruct regular non-exotic matter configurations that source spinning black\nhole solutions or horizonless compact objects with the same multipolar\nstructure as black holes.",

Though the nature\nof their progenitors is still not well-understood, SNe Ia are unique among\nstellar explosions in that the majority of them exhibit a systematic lightcurve\nrelation: more luminous supernovae dim more slowly over time than less luminous\nsupernovae in optical light (intrinsically brighter SNe Ia have broader\nlightcurves). This feature, unique to SNe Ia, is rather remarkable and allows\ntheir peak luminosities to be determined with fairly high accuracy out to\ncosmological distances via measurement of their lightcurve decline.

Furthermore, we explore\nrigorously how to best quantify success for the text-to-3D sculpting task, and\ncompare existing text-image and text-point cloud similarity metrics to human\nevaluations for this task.

The proposed FBHA is an accurate adder\nwith a significant part and a less significant part joined together by a carry\nsignal. In an N-bit FBHA, the K-bit less significant part is realized using\ncarry-lookahead adder logic, and the (N-K)-bit significant part is realized\nusing carry-select adder logic. The 32-bit addition was considered as an\nexample operation for this work. Many 32-bit adders ranging from the slow\nripple carry adder to the fast parallel-prefix Kogge-Stone adder and the\nproposed adder were synthesized using a 28-nm CMOS standard cell library and\ntheir design metrics were compared. A well-optimized FBHA achieved significant\noptimizations in design metrics compared to its high-speed adder counterparts\nand some examples are mentioned as follows: (a) 19.8% reduction in delay\ncompared to a carry-lookahead adder; (b) 19.8% reduction in delay, 24.4%\nreduction in area, and 19.4% reduction in power compared to a carry-select\nadder; (c) 45.6% reduction in delay, and 13.5% reduction in power compared to a\nconditional sum adder; and (d) 46.5% reduction in area, and 29.3% reduction in\npower compared to the Kogge-Stone adder.",

    "abstract": "We study a censored variant of the data-driven newsvendor problem, where the\ndecision-maker must select an ordering quantity that minimizes expected overage\nand underage costs based only on offline censored sales data, rather than\nhistorical demand realizations. Our goal is to understand how the degree of\nhistorical demand censoring affects the performance of any learning algorithm\nfor this problem. To isolate this impact, we adopt a distributionally robust\noptimization framework, evaluating policies according to their worst-case\nregret over an ambiguity set of distributions. This set is defined by the\nlargest historical order quantity (the observable boundary of the dataset), and\ncontains all distributions matching the true demand distribution up to this\nboundary, while allowing them to be arbitrary afterwards. We demonstrate a\nspectrum of achievability under demand censoring by deriving a natural\nnecessary and sufficient condition under which vanishing regret is an\nachievable goal. In regimes in which it is not, we exactly characterize the\ninformation loss due to censoring: an insurmountable lower bound on the\nperformance of any policy, even when the decision-maker has access to\ninfinitely many demand samples. We then leverage these sharp characterizations\nto propose a natural robust algorithm that adapts to the historical level of\ndemand censoring. We derive finite-sample guarantees for this algorithm across\nall possible censoring regimes and show its near-optimality with matching lower\nbounds (up to polylogarithmic factors). We moreover demonstrate its robust\nperformance via extensive numerical experiments on both synthetic and\nreal-world datasets.",

Since the introduction of VQ-GAN, discrete image\ntokenization has undergone remarkable advancements.

In\nthis paper, we present XQ-GAN, an image tokenization framework designed for\nboth image reconstruction and generation tasks. Our framework integrates\nstate-of-the-art quantization techniques, including vector quantization (VQ),\nresidual quantization (RQ), multi-scale residual quantization (MSVQ), product\nquantization (PQ), lookup-free quantization (LFQ), and binary spherical\nquantization (BSQ), within a highly flexible and customizable training\nenvironment. On the standard ImageNet 256x256 benchmark, our released model\nachieves an rFID of 0.64, significantly surpassing MAGVIT-v2 (0.9 rFID) and VAR\n(0.9 rFID). Furthermore, we demonstrate that using XQ-GAN as a tokenizer\nimproves gFID metrics alongside rFID. For instance, with the same VAR\narchitecture, XQ-GAN+VAR achieves a gFID of 2.6, outperforming VAR's 3.3 gFID\nby a notable margin. To support further research, we provide pre-trained\nweights of different image tokenizers for the community to directly train the\nsubsequent generative models on it or fine-tune for specialized tasks.",

Our analysis encompasses both pair and\nsingle production modes, systematically comparing results from the two\ncollaborations to identify and employ the most stringent bounds at each mass\npoint. We evaluate the excluded parameter space for VLQs under singlet,\ndoublet, and triplet representations. For top-like VLQs ($T$), the exclusion\nlimits rule out masses up to 1.49 TeV in singlet scenarios, while single\nproduction constrains the mixing parameter $\\kappa$ to values below 0.26 at\n$m_T \\sim 1.5$ TeV and up to 0.42 for $m_T \\sim 2$ TeV. For bottom-like VLQs\n($B$), the strongest exclusion limits from pair production exclude masses up to\n1.52 TeV in doublet configurations, with single production constraining\n$\\kappa$ values between 0.2 and 0.7 depending on the mass. For exotic VLQs,\nsuch as $X$ and $Y$, pair production excludes masses up to 1.46 TeV and 1.7\nTeV, respectively. The constraints on $\\kappa$ from these analyses become\nincreasingly restrictive at higher masses, reflecting the enhanced sensitivity\nof single production channels in this regime. For $X$, $\\kappa$ is constrained\nbelow 0.16 for masses between 0.8 and 1.6 TeV and further tightens to $\\kappa <\n0.2$ as the mass approaches 1.8 TeV. Similarly, for $Y$, $\\kappa$ values are\nconstrained below 0.26 around $m_Y \\sim 1.7$ TeV, with exclusions gradually\nrelaxing at higher masses. These exclusion regions, derived from the most\nstringent LHC search results, offer a unified and up-to-date perspective on VLQ\nphenomenology.

While good list decoding\nalgorithms for multivariate multiplicity codes were known in some special cases\nof point sets by a reduction to univariate multiplicity codes, a general list\ndecoding algorithm up to the distance of the code when the point set is an\narbitrary finite grid, was obtained only recently (Bhandari et al., IEEE TIT\n2023).

Existing Human Mesh Recovery (HMR)\nmethods rely predominantly on frame-based approaches, which are prone to\naliasing and inaccuracies due to limited temporal resolution and motion blur.\nIn this work, we predict a continuous-time human motion field directly from\nevents by leveraging a recurrent feed-forward neural network to predict human\nmotion in the latent space of possible human motions. Prior state-of-the-art\nevent-based methods rely on computationally intensive optimization across a\nfixed number of poses at high frame rates, which becomes prohibitively\nexpensive as we increase the temporal resolution. In comparison, we present the\nfirst work that replaces traditional discrete-time predictions with a\ncontinuous human motion field represented as a time-implicit function, enabling\nparallel pose queries at arbitrary temporal resolutions. Despite the promises\nof event cameras, few benchmarks have tested the limit of high-speed human\nmotion estimation. We introduce Beam-splitter Event Agile Human Motion\nDataset-a hardware-synchronized high-speed human dataset to fill this gap. On\nthis new data, our method improves joint errors by 23.8% compared to previous\nevent human methods while reducing the computational time by 69%.",

Aristotelian\nthinking about the matter/life distinction and Vitalistic philosophy's \"vital\nforce\" persisted well into the Scientific Revolution, only to be debunked by\nPasteur and Brown in the 19th century.

An analysis of the computational efficiency is performed for models\nwith the number of particles up to $10^{8}$. We considered several processors\nwith different architectures in order to determine the performance of parallel\nsimulations based on the OpenMP standard.

We\nprove that any such Gibbs state which satisfies a clustering condition that we\ncoin decay of matrix-valued quantum conditional mutual information (MCMI) can\nbe quasi-optimally prepared on a quantum computer. We do this by controlling\nthe mixing time of the corresponding Davies evolution in a normalized quantum\nWasserstein distance of order one. To the best of our knowledge, this is the\nfirst time that such a non-commutative transport metric has been used in the\nstudy of quantum dynamics, and the first time quasi-rapid mixing is implied by\nsolely an explicit clustering condition. Our result is based on a weak\napproximate tensorization and a weak modified logarithmic Sobolev inequality\nfor such systems, as well as a new general weak transport cost inequality. If\nwe furthermore assume a constraint on the local gap of the thermalizing\ndynamics, we obtain rapid mixing in trace distance for interactions beyond the\nrange of two, thereby extending the state-of-the-art results that only cover\nthe nearest neighbor case. We conclude by showing that systems that admit\neffective local Hamiltonians, like quantum CSS codes at high temperature,\nsatisfy this MCMI decay and can thus be efficiently prepared and sampled from.",

We consider network\nsystems powered by solar panels, where harvest energy is stored in a battery\nthat can also be sold when fully charged. To reflect real-world conditions, we\naccount for non-stationary energy arrivals and service demands that depend on\nthe time of day, as well as the failure states of PV panel. The network\noperator we model faces two conflicting objectives: maintaining the operation\nof its infrastructure and selling (or supplying to other networks) surplus\nenergy from fully charged batteries. To address these challenges, we developed\na slot-based Markov Decision Process (MDP) model that incorporates positive\nrewards for energy sales, as well as penalties for energy loss and battery\ndepletion. This slot-based MDP follows a specific structure we have previously\nproven to be efficient in terms of computational performance and accuracy. From\nthis model, we derive the optimal policy that balances these conflicting\nobjectives and maximizes the average reward function. Additionally, we present\nresults comparing different cities and months, which the operator can consider\nwhen deploying its infrastructure to maximize rewards based on\nlocation-specific energy availability and seasonal variations.",

Our sample of globular cluster candidates is essentially\ncomplete down to a limiting magnitude of F814W=24.0, approximately 90% down the\nglobular cluster luminosity function.

The abundant cluster population suggests\nthe galaxy is enshrouded by a massive dark halo, consistent with previous\ndynamical mass estimates using globular cluster kinematics. While the peak of\nthe globular cluster luminosity function appears slightly brighter than\nexpected (by approximately 0.3-0.5 mag), this difference is comparable to the\n0.3 mag uncertainty in the measurement, and we see no sign of an extremely\nluminous population of clusters similar to those detected in the UDGs\nNGC1054-DF2 and -DF4.

To explore this enigmatic object we use\nthe 1-D radiative transfer modeling code DUSTY.

Overall, these dust shells exhibit a chemical composition\nconsistent with dust typically found around O-rich AGB stars. However, the\ndistribution of materials differs significantly. The inner shell consists of a\nmixture of silicates, Al2O3, FeO, and Fe, while the outer shell primarily\ncontains crystalline Al2O3 polymorphs.

    "abstract": "With the rapid advancement of multimodal information retrieval, increasingly\ncomplex retrieval tasks have emerged. Existing methods predominately rely on\ntask-specific fine-tuning of vision-language models, often those trained with\nimage-text contrastive learning. In this paper, we explore the possibility of\nre-purposing generative Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) for retrieval. This\napproach enables unifying all retrieval tasks under the same formulation and,\nmore importantly, allows for extrapolation towards unseen retrieval tasks\nwithout additional training. Our contributions can be summarised in the\nfollowing aspects: (i) We introduce LamRA, a versatile framework designed to\nempower LMMs with sophisticated retrieval and reranking capabilities. (ii) For\nretrieval, we adopt a two-stage training strategy comprising language-only\npre-training and multimodal instruction tuning to progressively enhance LMM's\nretrieval performance. (iii) For reranking, we employ joint training for both\npointwise and listwise reranking, offering two distinct ways to further boost\nthe retrieval performance. (iv) Extensive experimental results underscore the\nefficacy of our method in handling more than ten retrieval tasks, demonstrating\nrobust performance in both supervised and zero-shot settings, including\nscenarios involving previously unseen retrieval tasks.",

This paper presents a systematic\nliterature review that explores vulnerabilities in Ethereum smart contracts,\nfocusing on automated detection tools and benchmark evaluation. We reviewed\n3,380 studies from five digital libraries and five major software engineering\nconferences, applying a structured selection process that resulted in 222\nhigh-quality studies. The key results include a hierarchical taxonomy of 192\nvulnerabilities grouped into 14 categories, a comprehensive list of 219\ndetection tools with corresponding functionalities, methods, and code\ntransformation techniques, a mapping between our taxonomy and the list of\ntools, and a collection of 133 benchmarks used for tool evaluation.

We achieve this by lifting\ncaptured 2D RGB images into the 3D space via 3D Gaussian Splatting, improving\nthe rendering quality for closed-loop scenarios, and building the closed-loop\nenvironment. In terms of rendering, We tackle challenges of novel view\nsynthesis in closed-loop scenarios, including viewpoint extrapolation and\n360-degree vehicle rendering. Beyond novel view synthesis, HUGSIM further\nenables the full closed simulation loop, dynamically updating the ego and actor\nstates and observations based on control commands. Moreover, HUGSIM offers a\ncomprehensive benchmark across more than 70 sequences from KITTI-360, Waymo,\nnuScenes, and PandaSet, along with over 400 varying scenarios, providing a fair\nand realistic evaluation platform for existing autonomous driving algorithms.\nHUGSIM not only serves as an intuitive evaluation benchmark but also unlocks\nthe potential for fine-tuning autonomous driving algorithms in a photorealistic\nclosed-loop setting.",

Existing methods excel at view interpolation along recorded\npaths but struggle to generalize to novel trajectories due to limited\nviewpoints in driving videos. To tackle this challenge, we propose DriveX, a\nnovel free-form driving view synthesis framework, that progressively distills\ngenerative prior into the 3D Gaussian model during its optimization. Within\nthis framework, we utilize a video diffusion model to refine the degraded novel\ntrajectory renderings from the in-training Gaussian model, while the restored\nvideos in turn serve as additional supervision for optimizing the 3D Gaussian.\nConcretely, we craft an inpainting-based video restoration task, which can\ndisentangle the identification of degraded regions from the generative\ncapability of the diffusion model and remove the need of simulating specific\ndegraded pattern in the training of the diffusion model. To further enhance the\nconsistency and fidelity of generated contents, the pseudo ground truth is\nprogressively updated with gradually improved novel trajectory rendering,\nallowing both components to co-adapt and reinforce each other while minimizing\nthe disruption on the optimization. By tightly integrating 3D scene\nrepresentation with generative prior, DriveX achieves high-quality view\nsynthesis beyond recorded trajectories in real time--unlocking new\npossibilities for flexible and realistic driving simulations on free-form\ntrajectories.",

During the last\ndecade, it was shown that through the process of high-order harmonic generation\n(HHG) it is possible to up-convert spatial optical vortices that carry\nlongitudinal OAM from the near-infrared into the extreme-ultraviolet (EUV),\nthereby producing vortices with distinct femtosecond and attosecond structure.\nIn this work we demonstrate theoretically and experimentally the generation of\nEUV spatiotemporal and spatiospectral vortices using near infrared STOV driving\nlaser pulses. We use analytical expressions for focused STOVs to perform\nmacroscopic calculations of HHG that are directly compared to the experimental\nresults.

JPTA architecture comprises time-delay\ncomponents appended to conventional phase shifters, which offer extra degrees\nof freedom to be exploited for designing frequency-selective analog beams.\nHence, a mmWave device equipped with JPTA can receive and transmit signals in\nmultiple directions in a single time slot per RF chain, one direction per\nfrequency subband, which alleviates the traditional constraint of one analog\nbeam per transceiver chain per time slot. The utilization of subband-specific\nanalog beams offers a new opportunity in designing mmWave systems, allowing for\nenhanced cell capacity and reduced pilot overhead. To understand the practical\nfeasibility of JPTA, a few challenges and system design considerations are\ndiscussed in relation to the performance and complexity of the JPTA systems.\nFor example, frequency-selective beam gain losses are present for the subband\nanalog beams, e.g., up to 1 dB losses for 2 subband cases, even with the\nstate-of-the-art JPTA delay and phase optimization methods. Despite these side\neffects, system-level analysis reveals that the JPTA system is capable of\nimproving cell capacity: 5-percentile cell throughput by up to 65 per cent. To\nthe best of the author's knowledge, this paper is the first paper explaining\nthe system-level benefits and system-design challenges of JPTA, with an\nanalysis of the performance tradeoff based on an intuitive metric of beam gain\nlosses.",

    "abstract": "Sparse-view Computed Tomography (CT) is an emerging protocol designed to\nreduce X-ray dose radiation in medical imaging. Traditional Filtered Back\nProjection algorithm reconstructions suffer from severe artifacts due to sparse\ndata. In contrast, Model-Based Iterative Reconstruction (MBIR) algorithms,\nthough better at mitigating noise through regularization, are too\ncomputationally costly for clinical use. This paper introduces a novel\ntechnique, denoted as the Deep Guess acceleration scheme, using a trained\nneural network both to quicken the regularized MBIR and to enhance the\nreconstruction accuracy. We integrate state-of-the-art deep learning tools to\ninitialize a clever starting guess for a proximal algorithm solving a\nnon-convex model and thus computing an interpretable solution image in a few\niterations. Experimental results on real CT images demonstrate the Deep Guess\neffectiveness in (very) sparse tomographic protocols, where it overcomes its\nmere variational counterpart and many data-driven approaches at the state of\nthe art. We also consider a ground truth-free implementation and test the\nrobustness of the proposed framework to noise.",

Specifically, we consider a JJ\nwith a quantum dot barrier coupled to a normal metal reservoir. The coupling\nintroduces an imaginary self-energy term in the JJ Hamiltonian which can be\nnaturally accounted for in the NH formalism. While most approaches to similar\nproblems work with the full junction Hamiltonian we propose a scheme for\nderiving an effective NH Hamiltonian for the Andreev levels only, that we\ncompute from the singular part of the barrier GF. To establish the range of\napplicability of this NH model we benchmark our results for both the dot\ndensity of states and the supercurrent against exact GF predictions in\ndifferent transport regimes. We find that, as a rule of thumb, the Andreev NH\ndescription is accurate when the spectral overlap between the Andreev bound\nstates (ABS) and the near-gap continuum states is negligible, i.e. when the ABS\nenergies lie sufficiently far from the superconducting gap relative to their\nline-width. This method not only highlights the effective physics of the JJ but\nalso offers a scalable framework for studying large-size devices.",

We use the PLUTO code\nin a 2.5 D global accretion setup and include Lagrangian dust particles of 0.1\nand 1 mm sizes.

This assumption is well justified as long as the frequency\nof the gravitational waves is well below the free spectral range (FSR) of the\nFabry-Perot cavities in the interferometer arms as it happens for current\ninterferometers ($\\mathrm{FSR}=37.5$~kHz for the LIGO interferometers and\n$\\mathrm{FSR}=50$~kHz for Virgo and KAGRA).

In this study, the combined\ninfluence of temperature (40-80{\\deg}C) and short-wavelength light exposure on\nthe dissolution rate of combusted iron particles in aqueous oxalic acid (0.45\nmol/L) is experimentally investigated. The combusted iron particles were\nproduced with various fuel-to-air equivalence ratios during combustion. Unlike\nprevious dissolution studies on single-phase iron oxides, these particles\ncomprise a heterogeneous mixture of iron oxides - primarily hematite and\nmagnetite. In situ video recordings revealed the evolution of the particle size\nand morphology during dissolution. Increasing the temperature accelerated the\nreaction rate, and an additional light-induced enhancement became significant\nonly above 40{\\deg}C for the duration of the experiments. This behavior differs\nsignificantly from that observed for hematite/maghemite mixed oxides and is\nattributed to the internal hematite and magnetite structure of the combusted\niron particles. At 80{\\deg}C under short-wavelength light irradiation, a sudden\ndecrease in the reaction rate was observed owing to solid ferrous oxide\nformation.

The defender has several booby traps and chooses where to plant\nthem. The attacker, aware of the presence of these booby traps but not their\nlocations, chooses a subset of the space and collects a reward equal to the\nmeasure of the subset. If the attacker does not encounter any booby traps, then\nthe attacker keeps the reward; otherwise, the attacker gets nothing. The\nattacker's objective is to maximize the expected reward, while the defender's\nobjective is to minimize it. We solve this game in the case that the search\nspace is a compact subset of Euclidean space, and then turn our attention to\nthe case where the search space is a network in which the attacker must choose\na connected subset of the network. We solve the game when the network is a\ncircle or a line. For the case of one booby trap, we solve the game for\n2-connected networks, and when the network is a tree we present an upper bound\nand a lower bound for the value of the game whose ratio is at most 27/25.

This\nmaterial exhibits a valence band structure with significant effective mass\nanisotropy, forming tube-like energy isosurfaces below the band edge, akin to\nthat of two-dimensional (2D) systems. Such systems can have a large number of\nhigh-mobility charge carriers and a beneficial density of states profile. In\nthe calculations, we predicted a maximum p-type figure of merit ($zT$) of 2.6\nat 800 K, in line with previous predictions of high $zT$. This high $zT$ arises\nfrom the low lattice thermal conductivity of 0.35 Wm$^{-1}$K$^{-1}$ and the\nbeneficial electronic band structure. The high density of states significantly\nincreased the electron-scattering space, but this effect was largely\ncompensated by reduced scattering rates of electrons with large momentum\n${\\mathbf{q}}$. We further explored the effect of enhancing the\nlow-dimensionality through compressive strain. This increased the p-type power\nfactor by up to 66 %; partly due to more strongly pronounced 2D features of the\nvalence band, but primarily due to increased Fermi velocities. However,\ncompressive strain also increased phonon velocities and hence the lattice\nthermal conductivity. The maximum p-type $zT$ thus only increased slightly, to\n2.7 at 1 % compressive strain. In the conduction band, strain aligned the\n$\\Gamma$- and X-centered valleys, resulting in the optimal n-type $zT$\nincreasing from 0.9 to 2.3 at 2 % compressive strain.

These\ndetections, coupled with galaxy surveys by instruments such as DESI, Euclid,\nand the Vera Rubin Observatory, will provide unique information on the\nlarge-scale structure of the universe by cross-correlating GWs with the\ndistribution of galaxies which host them.

This parameter links BBHs to the\nunderlying dark matter distribution, hence informing us how they populate\ngalaxies. Using a multi-tracer approach, we forecast the precision of these\nmeasurements under different survey combinations.

    "abstract": "Self-supervised learning (SSL) methods have emerged as strong visual\nrepresentation learners by training an image encoder to maximize similarity\nbetween features of different views of the same image. To perform this\nview-invariance task, current SSL algorithms rely on hand-crafted augmentations\nsuch as random cropping and color jittering to create multiple views of an\nimage. Recently, generative diffusion models have been shown to improve SSL by\nproviding a wider range of data augmentations. However, these diffusion models\nrequire pre-training on large-scale image-text datasets, which might not be\navailable for many specialized domains like histopathology. In this work, we\nintroduce Gen-SIS, a diffusion-based augmentation technique trained exclusively\non unlabeled image data, eliminating any reliance on external sources of\nsupervision such as text captions. We first train an initial SSL encoder on a\ndataset using only hand-crafted augmentations. We then train a diffusion model\nconditioned on embeddings from that SSL encoder. Following training, given an\nembedding of the source image, this diffusion model can synthesize its diverse\nviews. We show that these `self-augmentations', i.e. generative augmentations\nbased on the vanilla SSL encoder embeddings, facilitate the training of a\nstronger SSL encoder. Furthermore, based on the ability to interpolate between\nimages in the encoder latent space, we introduce the novel pretext task of\ndisentangling the two source images of an interpolated synthetic image. We\nvalidate Gen-SIS's effectiveness by demonstrating performance improvements\nacross various downstream tasks in both natural images, which are generally\nobject-centric, as well as digital histopathology images, which are typically\ncontext-based.",

Prior work\nhas focused on verifying DP at a high level, assuming the foundations are\ncorrect and a perfect source of randomness is available. However, the\nunderlying theory of differential privacy can be very complex and subtle. Flaws\nin basic mechanisms and random number generation have been a critical source of\nvulnerabilities in real-world DP systems.\n  In this paper, we present SampCert, the first comprehensive, mechanized\nfoundation for differential privacy.

It offers a generic and extensible notion of DP, a\nframework for constructing and composing DP mechanisms, and formally verified\nimplementations of Laplace and Gaussian sampling algorithms. SampCert provides\n(1) a mechanized foundation for developing the next generation of\ndifferentially private algorithms, and (2) mechanically verified primitives\nthat can be deployed in production systems. Indeed, SampCert's verified\nalgorithms power the DP offerings of Amazon Web Services (AWS), demonstrating\nits real-world impact.\n  SampCert's key innovations include: (1) A generic DP foundation that can be\ninstantiated for various DP definitions (e.g., pure, concentrated, R\\'enyi DP);\n(2) formally verified discrete Laplace and Gaussian sampling algorithms that\navoid the pitfalls of floating-point implementations; and (3) a simple\nprobability monad and novel proof techniques that streamline the formalization.\nTo enable proving complex correctness properties of DP and random number\ngeneration, SampCert makes heavy use of Lean's extensive Mathlib library,\nleveraging theorems in Fourier analysis, measure and probability theory, number\ntheory, and topology.",

    "abstract": "In the post-Newtonian era, the Eddington-inspired Born-Infeld (EiBI) theory,\nconsidered as an improved modification of the Einsteinian general relativity\nformalism in the weak field regime (non-relativistic), has enabled us to study\nthe dynamics of dense astroobjects in light of the modified gravitational\neffects. This EiBI theory imparts a new shape to the usual gravitational\nPoisson equation through the addition of a cosmological correction factor,\ntermed as the EiBI gravity parameter. A systematic inclusion of this gravity in\nthe basic structure equation could lead to a realistic picture of the existing\nsolar models free from any end-stage singularity. A theoretic model is\naccordingly proposed to investigate the effect of the EiBI gravity on the\nGravito-Electrostatic Sheath (GES) formalism of the equilibrium solar plasma\nstructure. This study shows that the GES-based solar plasma dynamics is\nnoticeably modified against the previously reported Newtonian GES-model\nstudies. An equilibrium bounded solution for the solar self-gravity shows the\nEiBI-modified solar surface boundary (SSB) to exist at a new helio-centric\nradial location $\\xi = 4$ (on the Jeansean scale). It is found that the EiBI\ngravity shifts the present SSB outwards by 14.28% relative to the original\nNewtonian SSB. The EiBI-modified gravity effects on diverse relevant solar\nparameters, such as the gravito-electrostatic potentials, fields, and Mach\nnumbers, are illustratively analyzed. It is anticipated that our analyses could\nbe applied further to see the solar plasma equilibrium and fluctuation dynamics\nin realistically modified post-Newtonian gravity environments on both the\nbounded (interior) and unbounded (exterior) solar plasma scales.",

    "abstract": "The Wasatch Front in Utah, USA, is currently a non-attainment area for ozone\naccording to the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) National Ambient Air\nQuality Standards (NAAQS). Nitrogen oxides ($\\mathrm{NO_x = NO_2 + NO}$) and\nvolatile organic compounds (VOCs), in the presence of sunlight, lead to ozone\nformation in the troposphere. When the rate of oxidant production, defined as\nthe sum of $\\mathrm{O_3}$ and $\\mathrm{NO_2}$, is faster than the rate of\n$\\mathrm{NO_x}$ production, a region is said to be $\\mathrm{NO_x}$limited, and\nozone formation will be limited by the concentration of $\\mathrm{NO_x}$ species\nin the region. The inverse of this situation makes the region VOC-limited.\nKnowing whether a region is $\\mathrm{NO_x}$-limited or VOC-limited can aid in\ngenerating effective mitigation strategies. Understanding the background or\nregional contributions to ozone in a region, whether from the transport of\nprecursors or of ozone, provides information about the lower limit for ozone\nconcentrations that a region can achieve through regulation of local\nprecursors. In this paper, measured oxidant and $\\mathrm{NO_x}$ concentrations\nare analyzed from 14 counties in the state of Utah to calculate the regional\nand local contributions to ozone for each region. This analysis is used to\ndetermine the nature of the atmosphere in each county by identifying whether\nthe region is VOC or $\\mathrm{NO_x}$-limited. Furthermore, this analysis is\nperformed for each county for the years 2012 and 2022 to assess changes in the\noxidative nature and quantify regional and local contributions to ozone over a\n10-year period. All studied counties--except for Washington County--in Utah\nwere found to be VOC-limited in 2012. This shifted in 2022, with most counties\nbeing either in a transitional state or $\\mathrm{NO_x}$-limited. Local\ncontributions to ozone increased in two major counties, Cache and Salt Lake\nCounties, but decreased in Carbon, Davis, Duchesne, Uinta, Utah, Washington,\nand Weber Counties. Generally, the regional contributions to oxidant\nconcentrations decreased across the state. A summertime spike in both regional\nand local contributions to oxidants was observed. Smoke from wildfires was\nfound to increase regional contributions to oxidants and shift the local regime\nto be more $\\mathrm{NO_x}$-limited.",

Besides twisting, an alternative route to create structures with\ncomparably long or even longer periodicities is inducing a differential strain\nbetween adjacent layers in a van der Waals (vdW) material. Despite recent\ntheoretical efforts analyzing its benefits, this route has not yet been\nimplemented experimentally. Here we report evidence for the simultaneous\npresence of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic regions in CrBr3 _a hallmark of\nmoire magnetism_ from the observation of an unexpected magnetoconductance in\nCrBr3 tunnel barriers with ferromagnetic Fe3GeTe2 and graphene electrodes. The\nobserved magnetoconductance evolves with temperature and magnetic field as the\nmagnetoconductance measured in small angle CrBr3 twisted junctions, in which\nmoire magnetism occurs. Consistent with Raman measurements and theoretical\nmodeling, we attribute the phenomenon to the presence of a differential strain\nin the CrBr3 multilayer, which locally modifies the stacking and the interlayer\nexchange between adjacent CrBr3 layers, resulting in spatially modulated spin\ntextures. Our conclusions indicate that inducing differential strain in vdW\nmultilayers is a viable strategy to create moire-like superlattices, which in\nthe future may offer in-situ continuous tunability even at low temperatures.",

Command interception systems are used to intercept,\nassess, and block dangerous Command-line Interface (CLI) commands before they\ncan cause damage. Traditional solutions for command risk assessment include\nrule-based systems, which require expert knowledge and constant human revision\nto account for unseen commands. To overcome these limitations, several\nend-to-end learning systems have been proposed to classify CLI commands.

While Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) are lightweight and effective\nfor capturing temporal dependencies, they are prone to overfitting when used to\nmodel inter-channel dependencies. In this paper, we investigate the overfitting\nproblem in channel-wise MLPs using Rademacher complexity theory, revealing that\nextreme values in time series data exacerbate this issue. To mitigate this\nissue, we introduce a novel Simplex-MLP layer, where the weights are\nconstrained within a standard simplex. This strategy encourages the model to\nlearn simpler patterns and thereby reducing overfitting to extreme values.\nBased on the Simplex-MLP layer, we propose a novel \\textbf{F}requency\n\\textbf{S}implex \\textbf{MLP} (FSMLP) framework for time series forecasting,\ncomprising of two kinds of modules: \\textbf{S}implex\n\\textbf{C}hannel-\\textbf{W}ise MLP (SCWM) and \\textbf{F}requency\n\\textbf{T}emporal \\textbf{M}LP (FTM). The SCWM effectively leverages the\nSimplex-MLP to capture inter-channel dependencies, while the FTM is a simple\nyet efficient temporal MLP designed to extract temporal information from the\ndata. Our theoretical analysis shows that the upper bound of the Rademacher\nComplexity for Simplex-MLP is lower than that for standard MLPs. Moreover, we\nvalidate our proposed method on seven benchmark datasets, demonstrating\nsignificant improvements in forecasting accuracy and efficiency, while also\nshowcasing superior scalability. Additionally, we demonstrate that Simplex-MLP\ncan improve other methods that use channel-wise MLP to achieve less overfitting\nand improved performance.

Inspired by the widely used DCT in compression codecs, triggers are\nembedded in the DCT domain. We design attack objectives tailored to diverse\nscenarios, including: 1) degrading compression quality in terms of bit-rate and\nreconstruction accuracy; 2) targeting task-driven measures like face\nrecognition and semantic segmentation. To improve training efficiency, we\npropose a dynamic loss function that balances loss terms with fewer\nhyper-parameters, optimizing attack objectives effectively.

Then, we employ GPT-4o to generate a concept pool and choose potential\ncandidate concepts that are discriminative and representative using a novel\nsubmodular optimization algorithm.

The system consists\nof conduction band electrons in the presence of the Rashba spin-orbit coupling\nwhich are coupled to a $f(d)$-type localized and interacting electrons. The\ndouble occupancy in the $f$-band is penalized by a significant Coulomb\ninteraction energy, $U$. When the hybridization between two bands is not\nstrictly local, it leads an alternative pathway to a spin Hamiltonian that may\nproliferate the formation of Skyrmion textures. The effective spin Hamiltonian\nis derived using the Schriffer-Wolff perturbation theory. In addition to a\nKondo spin exchange interaction between conduction band spins and $f(d)$-band\nspins, which is denoted as $\\vec{s}_m \\cdot \\vec{S}_n$, the spin Hamiltonian\nadmits a {\\bf Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya} spin coupling term, $\\vec{s}_m \\times\n\\vec{S}_n$. The magnitude of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya term is approximately\nten to hundred times smaller than that of the Kondo term under physically\nrelevant assumptions.\n  The magnitude of spin coupling terms can be engineered using time-dependent\nexternal fields, motivating a generalization to a effective time-dependent\nHamiltonian. In this respect, the perturbative derivation is extended to\ninclude time-dependent external field using a time-dependent SW transformation.\nThe form of the effective spin Hamiltonian is retained while the spin coupling\ncoefficients gain time dependence.

This study employs a\nversatile potential model with a hard core followed by two constant steps,\nrepresenting wells or shoulders, analyzed in both one-dimensional (1D) and\nthree-dimensional (3D) systems. Comparing these dimensionalities highlights the\neffect of confinement on structural transitions. Exact results are derived for\n1D systems, while the rational function approximation is used for unconfined 3D\nfluids. Both scenarios confirm that when the steps are repulsive, the\nwavelength of the oscillatory decay of the total correlation function evolves\nwith temperature either continuously or discontinuously. In the latter case, a\ndiscontinuous oscillation crossover line emerges in the temperature--density\nplane. For an attractive first step and a repulsive second step, a\nFisher--Widom line appears. Although the 1D and 3D results share common\nfeatures, dimensionality introduces differences: these behaviors occur in\ndistinct temperature ranges, require deeper wells, or become attenuated in 3D.\nCertain features observed in 1D may vanish in 3D. We conclude that fluids with\ncompeting interactions exhibit a rich and intricate pattern of structural\ntransitions, demonstrating the significant influence of dimensionality and\ninteraction features.",

    "abstract": "Labeling schemes are a prevalent paradigm in various computing settings. In\nsuch schemes, an oracle is given an input graph and produces a label for each\nof its nodes, enabling the labels to be used for various tasks. Fundamental\nexamples in distributed settings include distance labeling schemes, proof\nlabeling schemes, advice schemes, and more. This paper addresses the question\nof what happens in a labeling scheme if some labels are erased, e.g., due to\ncommunication loss with the oracle or hardware errors. We adapt the notion of\nresilient proof-labeling schemes of Fischer, Oshman, Shamir [OPODIS 2021] and\nconsider resiliency in general labeling schemes. A resilient labeling scheme\nconsists of two parts -- a transformation of any given labeling to a new one,\nexecuted by the oracle, and a distributed algorithm in which the nodes can\nrestore their original labels given the new ones, despite some label erasures.\n  Our contribution is a resilient labeling scheme that can handle $F$ such\nerasures. Given a labeling of $\\ell$ bits per node, it produces new labels with\nmultiplicative and additive overheads of $O(1)$ and $O(\\log(F))$, respectively.\nThe running time of the distributed reconstruction algorithm is $O(F+(\\ell\\cdot\nF)/\\log{n})$ in the \\textsf{Congest} model.\n  This improves upon what can be deduced from the work of Bick, Kol, and Oshman\n[SODA 2022], for non-constant values of $F$. It is not hard to show that the\nrunning time of our distributed algorithm is optimal, making our construction\nnear-optimal, up to the additive overhead in the label size.",

    "abstract": "Text summarization is a process of condensing lengthy texts while preserving\ntheir essential information. Previous studies have predominantly focused on\nhigh-resource languages, while low-resource languages like Thai have received\nless attention. Furthermore, earlier extractive summarization models for Thai\ntexts have primarily relied on the article's body, without considering the\nheadline. This omission can result in the exclusion of key sentences from the\nsummary. To address these limitations, we propose CHIMA, an extractive\nsummarization model that incorporates the contextual information of the\nheadline for Thai news articles. Our model utilizes a pre-trained language\nmodel to capture complex language semantics and assigns a probability to each\nsentence to be included in the summary. By leveraging the headline to guide\nsentence selection, CHIMA enhances the model's ability to recover important\nsentences and discount irrelevant ones. Additionally, we introduce two\nstrategies for aggregating headline-body similarities, simple average and\nharmonic mean, providing flexibility in sentence selection to accommodate\nvarying writing styles. Experiments on publicly available Thai news datasets\ndemonstrate that CHIMA outperforms baseline models across ROUGE, BLEU, and F1\nscores. These results highlight the effectiveness of incorporating the\nheadline-body similarities as model guidance. The results also indicate an\nenhancement in the model's ability to recall critical sentences, even those\nscattered throughout the middle or end of the article. With this potential,\nheadline-guided extractive summarization offers a promising approach to improve\nthe quality and relevance of summaries for Thai news articles.",

We consider spectroscopic data obtained with the low resolution\nPRISM/CLEAR NIRSpec configuration. Studying the correlation of beta with M_UV\nwe find a decreasing trend of beta = (-0.056 +- 0.017) M_UV - (3.01 +- 0.34),\nconsistent with brighter galaxies having redder beta as found in previous\nworks. However, analysing the trend in separate redshift bins, we find that at\nhigh redshift the relation becomes much flatter, consistent with a flat slope.\nFurthermore, we find that beta decreases with redshift with an evolution as\nbeta = (-0.075 +- 0.010) z - (1.496 +- 0.056), consistent with most previous\nresults that show a steepening of the spectra going at higher z. We then select\na sample of galaxies with extremely blue slopes (beta < -2.6): such slopes are\nsteeper than what is predicted by stellar evolution models, even for dust free,\nyoung, metal poor populations, when the contribution of nebular emission is\nincluded. We select 51 extremely blue galaxies (XBGs) and we investigate the\npossible physical origin of their steep slopes, comparing them to a sub-sample\nof redder galaxies (matched in redshift and M_UV). We find that XBGs have\nyounger stellar populations, stronger ionization fields, lower dust\nattenuation, and lower but not pristine metallicity (~ 10% solar) compared to\nred galaxies. However, these properties alone cannot explain the extreme beta\nvalues. By using indirect inference of Lyman continuum escape, using the most\nrecent models, we estimate escape fractions f_esc > 10% in at least 25% of\nXBGs, while all the red sources have smaller f_esc. A reduced nebular continuum\ncontribution as due to either a high escape fraction or to a bursty\nstar-formation history is likely the origin of the extremely blue slopes.",

The eccentricity-period data for stellar binaries indicates that\nshort-period ($< 7$ day) binaries have had their orbits tidally circularized.\nWe examine here to what extent tidal circularization and shrinkage can conceal\ncircumbinary planets, i.e. whether planets actually exist around short-period\nbinaries, but are not detected because their transit probabilities drop as\ntides shrink the binary away from the planet. We carry out a population\nsynthesis by initializing a population of eccentric stellar binaries hosting\ncircumbinary planets, and then circularizing and tightening the host orbits\nusing stellar tides. To match the circumbinary transit statistics, stellar\nbinaries must form with eccentricities $\\gtrsim$ 0.2 and periods $\\gtrsim$ 6\ndays, with circumbinary planets emplaced on exterior stable orbits before tidal\ncircularization; moreover, tidal dissipation must be efficient enough to\ncircularize and shrink binaries out to $\\sim$6-8 days. The resultant binaries\nthat shrink to sub-7-day periods no longer host transiting planets. However,\nthis scenario cannot explain the formation of nearly circular, tight binaries,\nbrought to their present sub-seven-day orbits from other processes like disk\nmigration. Still, tidal shrinkage can introduce a bias against finding\ntransiting circumbinary planets, and predicts a population of KIC 3853259 (AB)b\nanalogs consisting of wide-separation, non-transiting planets orbiting tight\nbinaries.",

The controller is based on a Gaussian Process (GP) whose\nrealizations satisfy a system of linear ordinary differential equations with\nconstant coefficients. Control inputs for tracking are determined by\nconditioning the prior GP on the setpoints, i.e. control as inference.

Not only are these observations few\ncompared to the possible interior setups and their multiple controlling\nparameters, but they remain challenging to reconcile. As a complex,\nmultidimensional problem, characterizing typical structures can help simplify\nthe modeling process. We used NeuralCMS, a deep learning model based on the\naccurate concentric Maclaurin spheroid (CMS) method, coupled with a fully\nconsistent wind model to efficiently explore a wide range of interior models\nwithout prior assumptions. We then identified those consistent with the\nmeasurements and clustered the plausible combinations of parameters controlling\nthe interior. We determine the plausible ranges of internal structures and the\ndynamical contributions to Jupiter's gravity field. Four typical interior\nstructures are identified, characterized by their envelope and core properties.\nThis reduces the dimensionality of Jupiter's interior to only two effective\nparameters. Within the reduced 2D phase space, we show that the most\nobservationally constrained structures fall within one of the key structures,\nbut they require a higher 1 bar temperature than the observed value. We provide\na robust framework for characterizing giant planet interiors with consistent\nwind treatment, demonstrating that for Jupiter, wind constraints strongly\nimpact the gravity harmonics while the interior parameter distribution remains\nlargely unchanged. Importantly, we find that Jupiter's interior can be\ndescribed by two effective parameters that clearly distinguish the four\ncharacteristic structures and conclude that atmospheric measurements may not\nfully represent the entire envelope.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents an optimised algorithm implementing the method of slices\nfor analysing the stability of slopes. The algorithm adopts an improved\nphysically based parameterisation of slip lines according to their geometrical\ncharacteristics at the endpoints, which facilitates the identification of all\nviable failure mechanisms while excluding unrealistic ones. The minimisation\nroutine combines a preliminary discrete calculation of the factor of safety\nover a coarse grid covering the above parameter space with a subsequent\ncontinuous exploration of the most promising region via the simplex\noptimisation. This reduces computational time up to about 92% compared to\nconventional approaches that rely on the discrete calculation of the factor of\nsafety over a fine grid covering the entire search space. Significant savings\nof computational time are observed with respect to recently published heuristic\nalgorithms, which enable a continuous exploration of the entire parametric\nspace. These efficiency gains are particularly advantageous for numerically\ndemanding applications like, for example, the statistical assessment of slopes\nwith uncertain mechanical, hydraulic and geometrical properties. The novel\nphysically based parametrisation of the slip geometry and the adoption of a\ncontinuous local search allow exploration of parameter combinations that are\nnecessarily neglected by standard grid-based approaches, leading to an average\nimprovement in accuracy of about 5%.",

To address this hurdle, we propose a practical MPC\nformulation which retains the more interpretable tuning parameters of the\ninstantaneous control approach while enhancing the performance through a\nprediction horizon. The formulation is motivated at hand of a simple example,\nhighlighting the practical tuning challenges associated with typical MPC\napproaches and showing how the proposed formulation alleviates these\nchallenges.

    "abstract": "Modern machine learning models, that excel on computer vision tasks such as\nclassification and object detection, are often overconfident in their\npredictions for Out-of-Distribution (OOD) examples, resulting in unpredictable\nbehaviour for open-set environments. Recent works have demonstrated that the\nfree energy score is an effective measure of uncertainty for OOD detection\ngiven its close relationship to the data distribution. However, despite free\nenergy-based methods representing a significant empirical advance in OOD\ndetection, our theoretical analysis reveals previously unexplored and inherent\nvulnerabilities within the free energy score formulation such that\nin-distribution and OOD instances can have distinct feature representations yet\nidentical free energy scores. This phenomenon occurs when the vector direction\nrepresenting the feature space difference between the in-distribution and OOD\nsample lies within the null space of the last layer of a neural-based\nclassifier. To mitigate these issues, we explore lower-dimensional feature\nspaces to reduce the null space footprint and introduce novel regularisation to\nmaximize the least singular value of the final linear layer, hence enhancing\ninter-sample free energy separation. We refer to these techniques as Free\nEnergy Vulnerability Elimination for Robust Out-of-Distribution Detection\n(FEVER-OOD). Our experiments show that FEVER-OOD techniques achieve state of\nthe art OOD detection in Imagenet-100, with average OOD false positive rate (at\n95% true positive rate) of 35.83% when used with the baseline Dream-OOD model.",

A major challenge, however, is these tools' tendency to make\noverconfident predictions, even when encountering unseen or newly emerging\ndisease patterns, undermining their reliability.\n  We address this critical issue of reliability by framing it as an\nout-of-distribution (OOD) detection problem, where previously unseen and\nemerging diseases are identified as OOD examples. However, gastrointestinal\nimages pose a unique challenge due to the overlapping feature representations\nbetween in- Distribution (ID) and OOD examples. Existing approaches often\noverlook this characteristic, as they are primarily developed for natural image\ndatasets, where feature distinctions are more apparent. Despite the overlap, we\nhypothesize that the features of an in-distribution example will cluster closer\nto the centroids of their ground truth class, resulting in a shorter distance\nto the nearest centroid. In contrast, OOD examples maintain an equal distance\nfrom all class centroids. Based on this observation, we propose a novel\nnearest-centroid distance deficit (NCCD) score in the feature space for\ngastrointestinal OOD detection.\n  Evaluations across multiple deep learning architectures and two publicly\navailable benchmarks, Kvasir2 and Gastrovision, demonstrate the effectiveness\nof our approach compared to several state-of-the-art methods.

Limits on the maximum distance at\nwhich a merging system of black holes can be detected derived are therefore not\nimproved by considering elliptic trajectories, when compared to the circular\ncase. The article is written as pedagogically as possible so as to be\naccessible to the nonfamiliar reader and possibly useful beyond the ultrahigh\nfrequency case.",

This approach retains the good\nperformance of qs$GW$ for predicting first ionization potentials and\nfundamental gaps, while it greatly improves the description of electron\naffinities. Its good performance places qs$\\Sigma^{\\text{BSE}}@L^{\\text{BSE}}$\namong the best-performing electron propagator methods for charged excitations.\nAdding the vertex in $L$ only, as commonly done in the solid state community,\nleads to devastating results for electron affinities and fundamental gaps.

In this work, we place tBLG at 3-4 nm above bulk\nSrTiO3 substrates, which have a large yet tunable dielectric constant. By\nraising the dielectric constant in situ in a magic angle device, we observe\nsuppression of both the height and the width of the entire superconducting\ndome, thus demonstrating that, unlike conventional superconductors, the pairing\nmechanism in tBLG is strongly dependent on electronic interactions.\nInterestingly, in contrast to the absence of superconductivity in devices on\nSiO2 with angle>1.3 deg, we observe a superconducting pocket in a large-angle\n(angle=1.4 deg) tBLG/STO device while the correlated insulating states are\nabsent. These experimental results are in qualitative agreement with a\ntheoretical model in which the pairing mechanism arises from Coulomb\ninteractions that are screened by plasmons, electron-hole pairs, and\nlongitudinal acoustic phonons.

In event-based processors, this is\nparticularly critical for routing architectures, where substantial memory is\ndedicated to managing network connectivity. While prior work has focused on\noptimizing event routing during hardware design, optimizing memory utilization\nfor routing during network training remains underexplored. Key challenges\ninclude: (i) integrating routing into the loss function, which often introduces\nnon-differentiability, and (ii) computational expense in evaluating network\nmappability to hardware. We propose a hardware-algorithm co-design approach to\ntrain routing-aware neural networks. To address challenge (i), we extend the\nDeepR training algorithm, leveraging dynamic pruning and random re-assignment\nto optimize memory use. For challenge (ii), we introduce a proxy-based\napproximation of the mapping function to incorporate placement and routing\nconstraints efficiently. We demonstrate our approach by optimizing a network\nfor the Spiking Heidelberg Digits (SHD) dataset using a small-world\nconnectivity-based hardware architecture as a case study. The resulting\nnetwork, trained with our routing-aware methodology, is fully mappable to the\nhardware, achieving 5% more accuracy using the same number of parameters, and\niso-accuracy with 10x less memory usage, compared to non-routing-aware training\nmethods.

However, extending these models to generate 3D\nmolecular structures presents significant challenges. Two primary obstacles\nemerge: (1) the difficulty in designing a 3D line notation that ensures\nSE(3)-invariant atomic coordinates, and (2) the non-trivial task of tokenizing\ncontinuous coordinates for use in LMs, which inherently require discrete\ninputs. To address these challenges, we propose Mol-StrucTok, a novel method\nfor tokenizing 3D molecular structures. Our approach comprises two key\ninnovations: (1) We design a line notation for 3D molecules by extracting local\natomic coordinates in a spherical coordinate system. This notation builds upon\nexisting 2D line notations and remains agnostic to their specific forms,\nensuring compatibility with various molecular representation schemes. (2) We\nemploy a Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) to tokenize these\ncoordinates, treating them as generation descriptors. To further enhance the\nrepresentation, we incorporate neighborhood bond lengths and bond angles as\nunderstanding descriptors. Leveraging this tokenization framework, we train a\nGPT-2 style model for 3D molecular generation tasks. Results demonstrate strong\nperformance with significantly faster generation speeds and competitive\nchemical stability compared to previous methods. Further, by integrating our\nlearned discrete representations into Graphormer model for property prediction\non QM9 dataset, Mol-StrucTok reveals consistent improvements across various\nmolecular properties, underscoring the versatility and robustness of our\napproach.",

This is particularly the case when\nthere is significant interpenetration and evolution of the contact surfaces,\nsuch as the case of a relatively rigid body interacting with a highly\ndeformable body. The numerical challenges come from several non-linear sources:\nlarge deformation mechanics, history dependent material behaviour and\nslip/stick frictional contact. In this paper the Material Point Method (MPM) is\nadopted to represent the deformable material, combined with a discretised rigid\nbody which provides an accurate representation of the contact surface. The\nthree dimensional interaction between the bodies is detected though the use of\ndomains associated with each material point. This provides a general and\nconsistent representation of the extent of the deformable body without\nintroducing boundary representation in the material point method. The dynamic\ngoverning equations allows the trajectory of the rigid body to evolve based on\nthe interaction with the deformable body and the governing equations are solved\nwithin an efficient implicit framework. The performance of the method is\ndemonstrated on a number of benchmark problems with analytical solutions. The\nmethod is also applied to the specific case of soil-structure interaction,\nusing geotechnical centrifuge experimental data that confirms the veracity of\nthe proposed approach.",

    "abstract": "Cosmology and GR remain largely inaccessible to high-school teaching due to\nthe advanced prerequisites to master these topics. Integrating them into upper\nsecondary teaching is a significant challenge that remains unresolved. This\ncontribution reports on an implementation study of a GR and cosmology course\nfor upper secondary school students as part of an educational project launched\nduring the centenary of GR and tested ever since for several years. The course\naimed to expand students' knowledge to include current physics topics while\nhighlighting their foundations in areas of classical physics such as Newtonian\nmechanics, electromagnetism, and waves. Targeted teaching and learning\nmaterials are focused on conceptual and qualitative understanding, while\nsystematically combined with a mathematical treatment accessible at the upper\nsecondary level, avoiding oversimplification. A key element is an active\nlearning approach, incorporating activities and tasks such as engaging\napplications related to current research, reflective exercises, thought\nexperiments, and hands-on tasks. The main research objective was to explore\nwhether a conceptually deep and educationally effective GR and cosmology course\ncould be successfully implemented for non-specialist upper secondary students.\nA pre-post study assessed both conceptual learning and affective outcomes,\nincluding interest, curiosity, self-concept, and perceived relevance of\nscience. Results showed encouraging gains in both learning and motivation, with\nlarge to very large effect sizes for conceptual learning of core principles.\nAdditionally, no or small effects of predictors such as gender were observed.\nWe conclude that the integration of GR and cosmology into upper secondary\nphysics teaching, in the form of courses and materials that are engaging,\ncomprehensible, and impactful, is feasible.",

Existing efforts typically\nadhere to single-object, single-affordance paradigms, where each affordance\ntype or explicit instruction strictly corresponds to a specific affordance\nregion and are unable to handle long-horizon tasks. Such a paradigm cannot\nactively reason about complex user intentions that often imply sequential\naffordances. In this paper, we introduce the Sequential 3D Affordance Reasoning\ntask, which extends the traditional paradigm by reasoning from cumbersome user\nintentions and then decomposing them into a series of segmentation maps. Toward\nthis, we construct the first instruction-based affordance segmentation\nbenchmark that includes reasoning over both single and sequential affordances,\ncomprising 180K instruction-point cloud pairs. Based on the benchmark, we\npropose our model, SeqAfford, to unlock the 3D multi-modal large language model\nwith additional affordance segmentation abilities, which ensures reasoning with\nworld knowledge and fine-grained affordance grounding in a cohesive framework.\nWe further introduce a multi-granular language-point integration module to\nendow 3D dense prediction.

In order to\ncounter abuse of LLMs for generating potentially harmful replies or taking\nundesirable actions, LLM owners must apply safeguards during training and\nintegrate additional tools to block the LLM from generating text that abuses\nthe model.

    "abstract": "Computer science education has been at the heart of Scheme from the\nbeginning. The language was designed in the 1970s concurrently with the MIT\ncourse 6.001 and the textbook \"Structure and Interpretation of Computer\nPrograms\" (SICP). To explain the scope of variables at run time in the presence\nof higher-order procedures, SICP introduces a mental model called the\nenvironment model, along with a pictorial representation of environments and\ndata structures. Recently, the concept of notional machines has emerged in\ncomputer science education: a predictive set of abstractions that define the\nstructure and behavior of a computational device. Proponents of notional\nmachines argue that learners benefit when complex dynamic concepts such as the\ncomputational structure of Scheme are accompanied with concise notional\nmachines. In this paper, we start with a sublanguage of Scheme sufficient for\nall programs in SICP that we call SICP Scheme. We extend the environment model\nto a full notional machine for SICP Scheme that is simple enough to serve as\nthe central mental model in a CS1 course and demonstrate the machine with\ncomputer-generated visualizations. Moving beyond SICP Scheme, we show how the\nnotional machine can be further extended to explain Scheme's call/cc and thus\nmake this powerful concept accessible to beginners through a coherent mental\nmodel. The presented notional machine serves as the core of a web-based\nimplementation of Scheme that is under development at our university.",

    "abstract": "Existing approaches of hand reconstruction predominantly adhere to a\nmulti-stage framework, encompassing detection, left-right classification, and\npose estimation. This paradigm induces redundant computation and cumulative\nerrors. In this work, we propose HandOS, an end-to-end framework for 3D hand\nreconstruction. Our central motivation lies in leveraging a frozen detector as\nthe foundation while incorporating auxiliary modules for 2D and 3D keypoint\nestimation. In this manner, we integrate the pose estimation capacity into the\ndetection framework, while at the same time obviating the necessity of using\nthe left-right category as a prerequisite. Specifically, we propose an\ninteractive 2D-3D decoder, where 2D joint semantics is derived from detection\ncues while 3D representation is lifted from those of 2D joints. Furthermore,\nhierarchical attention is designed to enable the concurrent modeling of 2D\njoints, 3D vertices, and camera translation. Consequently, we achieve an\nend-to-end integration of hand detection, 2D pose estimation, and 3D mesh\nreconstruction within a one-stage framework, so that the above multi-stage\ndrawbacks are overcome. Meanwhile, the HandOS reaches state-of-the-art\nperformances on public benchmarks, e.g., 5.0 PA-MPJPE on FreiHand and 64.6\\%\nPCK@0.05 on HInt-Ego4D.

We apply\ncomputational modeling and principles in physics and chemistry to estimate\ndifferent thermal and electric properties of a\nwater-vapor/nitrogen/cesium-vapor (H2O/N2/Cs) gas mixture with different levels\nof cesium (Cs) at a fixed temperature of 2300 K (2026.85 {\\deg}C). This gas\nmixture and temperature are selected because they resemble the stoichiometric\ncombustion of hydrogen with air, followed by the addition of the alkali metal\nelement cesium to allow ionization, thus converting the gas mixture into\nelectrically conducting plasma. We vary the cesium mole fraction in the gas\nmixture by two orders of magnitude, from a minute amount of 0.0625% (1/1600) to\na major amount of 16% (0.16). We use these results to further estimate the\ntheoretical upper limit of the electric power output from a unit volume of a\nhigh-speed magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) channel, with the plasma accelerated\ninside it to twice the local speed of sound (Mach number 2) while subject to an\napplied magnetic field of 5 T (5 teslas). We report that there is an optimum\ncesium mole fraction of 3%, at which the power output is maximized. Per 1 m3 of\nplasma volume, the estimated theoretical electric power generation at 1 atm\n(101.325 kPa) pressure of the hydrogen-combustion mixture is extraordinarily\nhigh at 360 MW/m3, and the plasma electric conductivity is 17.5 S/m. This\nestimated power generation even reaches an impressive level of 1.15 GW/m3\n(11500 MW/m3) if the absolute pressure can be decreased to 0.0625 atm (6.333\nkPa), at which the electric conductivity exceeds 55 S/m (more than 10 times the\nelectric conductivity of seawater).",

    "abstract": "In an optimal control strategy, an important point is to define the cost of\nthe control. Usually it is added to the control criterion and multiplied by a\nsmall coefficient denoted by $\\varepsilon$ which is known as the marginal cost\nof the control. The key idea of this paper, is to introduce a smoothing term in\nthe control cost which aims at reducing the quantity of energy spent and\nreducing the oscillations of the control. Then using a so-called asymptotic\ncontrol based on the smallness of $\\varepsilon$, we construct an exact control\nwhich can be implemented in a close loop. The energy involved in the control\ndepends mainly on the variation of the control. Therefore it seems natural to\ninclude this quantity (the total variations) in the criterion involved in the\noptimal control. This can be done approximately by introducing the $L^1$ norm\nof the first order derivative of the control. The control strategy that we\ndevelop in this paper can be applied to such linear models. One important and\nnew point is that we focus on exact control strategies for a non-differentiable\ncriterion because of the cost of the control. Following the ideas of Tykhonov\nregularization method, it is proved using the so-called asymptotic method based\non the smallness of the marginal cost of the control, that the exact control\nsuggested is the one which represents the minimum of the marginal cost among\nexact controls. Furthermore, and it is the main technical point, it can reduce\nthe variations of the control with an adequate tuning of the various parameters\nof the control loop.

However, recent\nstudies have shown that diffusion models are vulnerable to copyright\ninfringement attacks, where attackers inject strategically modified\nnon-infringing images into the training set, inducing the model to generate\ninfringing content under the prompt of specific poisoned captions. To address\nthis issue, we first propose a defense framework, CopyrightShield, to defend\nagainst the above attack. Specifically, we analyze the memorization mechanism\nof diffusion models and find that attacks exploit the model's overfitting to\nspecific spatial positions and prompts, causing it to reproduce poisoned\nsamples under backdoor triggers. Based on this, we propose a poisoned sample\ndetection method using spatial masking and data attribution to quantify\npoisoning risk and accurately identify hidden backdoor samples. To further\nmitigate memorization of poisoned features, we introduce an adaptive\noptimization strategy that integrates a dynamic penalty term into the training\nloss, reducing reliance on infringing features while preserving generative\nperformance. Experimental results demonstrate that CopyrightShield\nsignificantly improves poisoned sample detection performance across two attack\nscenarios, achieving average F1-scores of 0.665, retarding the First-Attack\nEpoch (FAE) of 115.2% and decreasing the Copyright Infringement Rate (CIR) by\n56.7%.

As LLM-based methods\ncontinue to evolve, it is important that we define clear and robust methods\nthat fairly evaluate performance. Benchmarks are a common approach to assess\nLLMs with respect to their ability to solve problem-specific tasks as well as\nassess different versions of an LLM to solve tasks over time. For example, the\nHumanEval benchmark is composed of 164 hand-crafted tasks and has become an\nimportant tool in assessing LLM-based program generation. However, a major\nbarrier to a fair evaluation of LLMs using benchmarks like HumanEval is data\ncontamination resulting from data leakage of benchmark tasks and solutions into\nthe training data set. This barrier is compounded by the black-box nature of\nLLM training data which makes it difficult to even know if data leakage has\noccurred. To address the data leakage problem, we propose a new benchmark\nconstruction method where a benchmark is composed of template tasks that can be\ninstantiated into new concrete tasks using combinatorial test design. Concrete\ntasks for the same template task must be different enough that data leakage has\nminimal impact and similar enough that the tasks are interchangeable with\nrespect to performance evaluation.

Still,\ntheir high computational cost, stemming from processing entire 3D volumes,\nremains a major barrier to widespread clinical adoption. Current sub-sampling\ntechniques often compromise diagnostic integrity by introducing artifacts or\ndiscarding critical information. To overcome these limitations, we propose an\nEfficient and Reliable Framework (ERF) that fundamentally improves the\npracticality of automated CT analysis. Our framework introduces two core\ninnovations: (1) A Cluster-based Sub-Sampling (CSS) method that efficiently\nselects a compact yet comprehensive subset of CT slices by optimizing for both\nrepresentativeness and diversity. By integrating an efficient k-Nearest\nNeighbor (k-NN) search with an iterative refinement process, CSS bypasses the\ncomputational bottlenecks of previous methods while preserving vital diagnostic\nfeatures. (2) A lightweight Hybrid Uncertainty Quantification (HUQ) mechanism,\nwhich uniquely assesses both Aleatoric Uncertainty (AU) and Epistemic\nUncertainty (EU) with minimal computational overhead. By maximizing the\ndiscrepancy between auxiliary classifiers, HUQ provides a robust reliability\nscore, which is crucial for building trust in automated systems operating on\npartial data. Validated on two public datasets with 2,654 CT volumes across\ndiagnostic tasks for 3 pulmonary diseases, our proposed ERF achieves diagnostic\nperformance comparable to the full-volume analysis (over 90% accuracy and\nrecall) while reducing processing time by more than 60%.

    "abstract": "In human social systems, debates are often seen as a means to resolve\ndifferences of opinion. However, in reality, debates frequently incur\nsignificant communication costs, especially when dealing with stubborn\nopponents. Inspired by this phenomenon, this paper examines the impact of\nmalicious agents on the evolution of normal agents' opinions from the\nperspective of opinion evolution cost, and proposes corresponding solutions for\nthe scenario in which malicious agents hold different opinions in multi-agent\nsystems(MASs). First, this paper analyzes the negative impact of malicious\nagents on the opinion evolution process, reveals the additional evolution cost\nit brings, and provides a theoretical basis for the subsequent solutions.\nSecondly, based on the characteristics of opinion evolution, the malicious\nagent isolation algorithm based on opinion evolution direction vector is\nproposed, which does not strongly restrict the proportion of malicious agents.\nAdditionally, an evolution rate adjustment mechanism is introduced, allowing\nthe system to flexibly regulate the evolution process in complex situations,\neffectively achieving the trade-off between opinion evolution rate and cost.\nExtensive numerical simulations demonstrate that the algorithm can effectively\neliminate the negative influence of malicious agents and achieve a balance\nbetween opinion evolution costs and convergence speed.",

    "abstract": "Extending the context length (i.e., the maximum supported sequence length) of\nLLMs is of paramount significance. To facilitate long context training of LLMs,\nsequence parallelism has emerged as an essential technique, which scatters each\ninput sequence across multiple devices and necessitates communication to\nprocess the sequence. In essence, existing sequence parallelism methods assume\nhomogeneous sequence lengths (i.e., all input sequences are equal in length)\nand therefore leverages a single, static scattering strategy for all input\nsequences. However, in reality, the sequence lengths in LLM training corpora\nexhibit substantial variability, often following a long-tail distribution,\nwhich leads to workload heterogeneity.\n  In this paper, we show that employing a single, static strategy results in\ninefficiency and resource under-utilization, highlighting the need for adaptive\napproaches to handle the heterogeneous workloads across sequences. To address\nthis, we propose a heterogeneity-adaptive sequence parallelism method. For each\ntraining step, our approach captures the variability in sequence lengths and\nassigns the optimal combination of scattering strategies based on workload\ncharacteristics. We model this problem as a linear programming optimization and\ndesign an efficient and effective solver to find the optimal solution.\nFurthermore, we implement our method in a high-performance system that supports\nadaptive parallelization in distributed LLM training. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that our system outperforms state-of-the-art training frameworks by\nup to 1.98x.",

    "abstract": "We present ReHub, a novel graph transformer architecture that achieves linear\ncomplexity through an efficient reassignment technique between nodes and\nvirtual nodes. Graph transformers have become increasingly important in graph\nlearning for their ability to utilize long-range node communication explicitly,\naddressing limitations such as oversmoothing and oversquashing found in\nmessage-passing graph networks. However, their dense attention mechanism scales\nquadratically with the number of nodes, limiting their applicability to\nlarge-scale graphs. ReHub draws inspiration from the airline industry's\nhub-and-spoke model, where flights are assigned to optimize operational\nefficiency. In our approach, graph nodes (spokes) are dynamically reassigned to\na fixed number of virtual nodes (hubs) at each model layer. Recent work, Neural\nAtoms (Li et al., 2024), has demonstrated impressive and consistent\nimprovements over GNN baselines by utilizing such virtual nodes; their findings\nsuggest that the number of hubs strongly influences performance. However,\nincreasing the number of hubs typically raises complexity, requiring a\ntrade-off to maintain linear complexity. Our key insight is that each node only\nneeds to interact with a small subset of hubs to achieve linear complexity,\neven when the total number of hubs is large. To leverage all hubs without\nincurring additional computational costs, we propose a simple yet effective\nadaptive reassignment technique based on hub-hub similarity scores, eliminating\nthe need for expensive node-hub computations. Our experiments on LRGB indicate\na consistent improvement in results over the base method, Neural Atoms, while\nmaintaining a linear complexity. Remarkably, our sparse model achieves\nperformance on par with its non-sparse counterpart. Furthermore, ReHub\noutperforms competitive baselines and consistently ranks among top performers\nacross various benchmarks.",

We derive two\nachievability bounds on the probabilities of misdetection, false alarm, and\nactive user error, and propose an efficient CDMA-type scheme whose performance\ncan be compared against these bounds. The first bound is a finite-length result\nbased on Gaussian random codebooks and maximum-likelihood decoding. The second\nis an asymptotic bound, established using spatially coupled Gaussian codebooks\nand approximate message passing (AMP) decoding. These bounds can be used to\ncompute an achievable trade-off between the active user density and\nenergy-per-bit, for a fixed user payload and target error rate. The efficient\nCDMA scheme uses a spatially coupled signature matrix and AMP decoding, and we\ngive rigorous asymptotic guarantees on its error performance. Our analysis\nprovides the first state evolution result for spatially coupled AMP with\nmatrix-valued iterates, which may be of independent interest.

The local\nco-visbility is checked to keep the map sparsity and achieve incremental\nmapping. In the localization phase, coarse-to-fine vision-based localization is\nperformed, in which multi-frame information and the map distribution are fully\nintegrated. To be specific, the concept of spatially smoothed similarity (SSS)\nis proposed to overcome the place ambiguity, and pairwise frame matching is\napplied for efficient and robust pose estimation.

This approach removes the need for a pre-determined\nstopping criterion, which is typically based on the number of propagation\npaths, in conventional OMP algorithm. Our simulation results confirm the\neffective performance of our proposed DA-OMP algorithm using the proposed\nwindowed dictionary in terms of normalized mean square error (NMSE) of the\nchannel estimate.

    "abstract": "Determining whether two sets of images belong to the same or different\ndistributions or domains is a crucial task in modern medical image analysis and\ndeep learning; for example, to evaluate the output quality of image generative\nmodels. Currently, metrics used for this task either rely on the (potentially\nbiased) choice of some downstream task, such as segmentation, or adopt\ntask-independent perceptual metrics (e.g., Fr\\'echet Inception Distance/FID)\nfrom natural imaging, which we show insufficiently capture anatomical features.\nTo this end, we introduce a new perceptual metric tailored for medical images,\nFRD (Fr\\'echet Radiomic Distance), which utilizes standardized, clinically\nmeaningful, and interpretable image features. We show that FRD is superior to\nother image distribution metrics for a range of medical imaging applications,\nincluding out-of-domain (OOD) detection, the evaluation of image-to-image\ntranslation (by correlating more with downstream task performance as well as\nanatomical consistency and realism), and the evaluation of unconditional image\ngeneration. Moreover, FRD offers additional benefits such as stability and\ncomputational efficiency at low sample sizes, sensitivity to image corruptions\nand adversarial attacks, feature interpretability, and correlation with\nradiologist-perceived image quality. Additionally, we address key gaps in the\nliterature by presenting an extensive framework for the multifaceted evaluation\nof image similarity metrics in medical imaging -- including the first\nlarge-scale comparative study of generative models for medical image\ntranslation -- and release an accessible codebase to facilitate future\nresearch. Our results are supported by thorough experiments spanning a variety\nof datasets, modalities, and downstream tasks, highlighting the broad potential\nof FRD for medical image analysis.",

Current research often\naddresses individual light-related challenges, such as high dynamic range\nimaging and exposure correction, in isolation. However, we identify shared\nfundamental properties across these tasks: i) different color channels have\ndifferent light properties, and ii) the channel differences reflected in the\nspatial and frequency domains are different. Leveraging these insights, we\nintroduce the channel-aware Learning Adaptive Lighting Network (LALNet), a\nmulti-task framework designed to handle multiple light-related tasks\nefficiently. Specifically, LALNet incorporates color-separated features that\nhighlight the unique light properties of each color channel, integrated with\ntraditional color-mixed features by Light Guided Attention (LGA). The LGA\nutilizes color-separated features to guide color-mixed features focusing on\nchannel differences and ensuring visual consistency across all channels.\nAdditionally, LALNet employs dual domain channel modulation for generating\ncolor-separated features and a mixed channel modulation and light state space\nmodule for producing color-mixed features. Extensive experiments on four\nrepresentative light-related tasks demonstrate that LALNet significantly\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods on benchmark tests and requires fewer\ncomputational resources.

    "abstract": "The kinetics of the reactions of nitrogen dioxide, NO$_2$, with atomic oxygen\nand atomic carbon in their ground triplet states ($^3$P) have been studied at\nroom temperature and below using a supersonic flow (Laval nozzle) reactor.\nO($^3$P) and C($^3$P) atoms (hereafter O and C respectively) were created\nin-situ by the pulsed laser photolysis of the precursor molecules NO$_2$ at 355\nnm and CBr$_4$ at 266 nm respectively. While the progress of the O + NO$_2$\nreaction was followed by detecting O atoms by a chemiluminescent tracer method,\nprogress of the C + NO$_2$ reaction was followed by detecting C atoms directly\nby vacuum ultra violet laser induced fluorescence at 116 nm. The measured rate\nconstants for the O + NO$_2$ reaction are found to be in excellent agreement\nwith earlier work at higher temperatures and extend the available kinetic data\nfor this process down to 50 K. The present work represents the first kinetics\nstudy of the C + NO$_2$ reaction. Although both reactions display rate\nconstants that increase as the temperature falls, a more substantial rate\nincrease is observed for the O + NO$_2$ reaction. The effects of these\nreactions on the simulated abundances of interstellar NO$_2$ and related\ncompounds were tested using a gas-grain model of the dense interstellar medium,\nemploying expressions for the rate constants of the form, $k(T) =\n\\alpha(T/300)^\\beta$, with $\\alpha = 1 \\times 10^{-11}$ cm$^3$ s$^{-1}$ and\n$\\beta = -0.65$ for the O + NO$_2$ reaction and $\\alpha = 2 \\times 10^{-10}$\ncm$^3$ s$^{-1}$ and $\\beta = -0.11$ for the C + NO$_2$ reaction. Although these\nsimulations predict that gas-phase NO$_2$ abundances are low in dense\ninterstellar clouds, NO$_2$ abundances on interstellar dust grains are\npredicted to reach reasonably high levels, indicating the potential for\ndetection of this species in warmer regions.",

Here we propose a novel conceptual approach to improve the\nefficiency of designing synthetic images, by using robust Explainable AI (XAI)\ntechniques to guide a human-in-the-loop process of modifying 3D mesh models\nused to generate these images. Importantly, this framework allows both\nmodifications that increase and decrease realism in synthetic data, which can\nboth improve model performance. We illustrate this concept using a real-world\nexample where data are sparse; detection of vehicles in infrared imagery. We\nfine-tune an initial YOLOv8 model on the ATR DSIAC infrared dataset and\nsynthetic images generated from 3D mesh models in the Unity gaming engine, and\nthen use XAI saliency maps to guide modification of our Unity models. We show\nthat synthetic data can improve detection of vehicles in orientations unseen in\ntraining by 4.6% (to mAP50 = 94.6%). We further improve performance by an\nadditional 1.5% (to 96.1%) through our new XAI-guided approach, which reduces\nmisclassifications through both increasing and decreasing the realism of\ndifferent parts of the synthetic data. Our proof-of-concept results pave the\nway for fine, XAI-controlled curation of synthetic datasets tailored to improve\nobject detection performance, whilst simultaneously reducing the burden on\nhuman operators in designing and optimising these datasets.",

Based on this viewpoint, we\npropose an adaptive method, ConsistentFeature, that regularizes the model by\nconstraining feature differences across random subsets of the same training\nset.

Our experiments show that it effectively reduces\noverfitting, with low sensitivity to hyperparameters and minimal computational\ncost.

Understanding the strength and patterns of winds is\ncrucial for comprehensive insights into the physics of ultra-hot Jupiter\natmospheres.

Two\ntransit observations using the high-resolution (R{\\lambda} = 85 000), optical\n(spectral coverage between 490 and 920 nm) spectrograph MAROON-X were obtained\nand analyzed to explore the chemical composition and wind dynamics using the\ncross-correlation techniques, global circulating models, and atmospheric\nretrieval.

Additionally, we measure the time-varying\ncross-correlation trails for 6 different species, compare them with predictions\nfrom General Circulation Models (GCM) and conclude that a strong drag is\npresent in TOI-1518b's atmosphere. We find that the trails are\nspecies-dependent. Fe+ favors a stronger drag than Fe, which we interpret as a\nsign of magnetic effects being responsible for the observed strong drag.\nFurthermore, we show that Ca+ probes layers above the Roche lobe, leading to a\nqualitatively different trail than the other species. Finally, we use a\nretrieval analysis to characterize the abundance of the different species\ndetected. That analysis is refined thanks to the updated planetary mass we\nderived from the radial-velocity detection using SOPHIE data. We measure an\nabundance of iron corresponding to 0.07 to 1.62 solar enrichment.

During the study of the recalescence and\nsolidification processes of digital droplets dynamically moving in\nmicrochannels, we found that although the digital generation of droplets in our\nchannel aligns well with the literature, achieving the digitalization of the\ndroplet freezing process is very challenging. Even the initial phase of\nfreezing (the recalescence process) exhibits significant randomness. A key\nfeature of the randomness in the freezing process is the nucleation position of\ndroplets within the channel, which significantly impacts the digital\ncharacteristics and hinders digital freezing. During the investigation of\nfreezing randomness, we identified five distinct nucleation profiles, which\nlargely determine the evolution of the freezing front and the duration of the\nrecalescence phase. However, upon studying the motion velocity of the freezing\nfront, we found that these velocities are temperature-dependent. This aligns\nwith the results of our phase-field simulations and experimental findings,\nindicating that the release of latent heat during the recalescence process is\nstable. Additionally, the randomness in freezing may also stem from the\ndeformation of droplets during the solidification process. In this study, we\nidentified two distinct solidification modes during the freezing phase: one\ninitiating from the droplet's head or tail and the other starting from the\nmiddle, with the latter causing significant droplet deformation. Through\nstatistical analysis, we further explored the influence of flow rate variation\non the digital clustering of droplet freezing and discovered flow rate\nparameters that optimize freezing digitalization.",

However, traditional\nhandcrafted features struggle to effectively capture the high-frequency\ncomponents in HDR images, resulting in excessive smoothing and loss of detail\nin the output image. To mitigate the above issue, we introduce a learnable\nDifferential Pyramid Representation Network (DPRNet). Based on the learnable\ndifferential pyramid, our DPRNet can capture detailed textures and structures,\nwhich is crucial for high-quality tone mapping recovery. In addition, to\nachieve global consistency and local contrast harmonization, we design a global\ntone perception module and a local tone tuning module that ensure the\nconsistency of global tuning and the accuracy of local tuning, respectively.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods, improving PSNR by 2.58 dB in the HDR+ dataset and\n3.31 dB in the HDRI Haven dataset respectively compared with the second-best\nmethod.

This limitation is rooted in\ndifficulties to prepare reactants at well-defined initial conditions. Here, we\novercome this hurdle by exploiting the exceptional solvation properties of\nhelium nanodroplets. We load the droplets with Mg atoms and investigate the\ndynamical response of the formed Mg$_n$ aggregates to photoexcitation with\ntime-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy. Beside the response expected for\nconventional Mg$_n$ clusters, consisting of a prompt signal rise and a decay\ncharacteristic for van der Waals bonds, the transient spectra also show a\ndelayed photoelectron band peaking at 1.2 ps. This delayed signal rise is\ncharacteristic for nuclear dynamics and represents the transition of Mg$_n$\naggregates from a metastable, foam-like configuration, where Mg atoms are\nstabilized with a previously predicted interatomic spacing of 9.5 A, to a\ncompact cluster. With global fitting analysis and ion-electron coincidence\ndetection, the concerted electronic and nuclear dynamics can be tracked on a fs\ntimescale. We find that cluster formation, proceeding with a ($450\\pm180$) fs\ntime constant, is accompanied by the population of highly-excited atomic\nstates. We propose an energy pooling reaction in collisions of two or more\nexcited Mg atoms during cluster formation as the mechanism leading to\npopulation of these high-lying Mg states. Additionally, conversion to kinetic\nenergy through electronic relaxation leads to fragmentation and ejection of\nionic cluster fragments from the He droplet. These results underline the\npotential of He droplets for time-resolved studies of bond formation and to\nuncover involved processes.",

We investigate the physics of stochastic\nacceleration in these environments in detail and examine the conditions under\nwhich the inferred proton spectrum can be explained. To this end, we used\nrecent findings on particle acceleration in turbulence and paid particular\nattention to the transport equation, notably for transport in momentum space,\nturbulent transport outside of the corona, and advection through the corona. We\nfirst remark that the spectra we obtained are highly sensitive to the value of\nthe acceleration rate, for instance, to the Alfv\\'enic velocity. Then, we\nexamined three prototype scenarios, one scenario of turbulent acceleration in\nthe test-particle picture, another scenario in which particles were\npreaccelerated by turbulence and further energized by shear acceleration, and a\nfinal scenario in which we considered the effect of particle backreaction on\nthe turbulence (damping), which self-regulates the acceleration process. We\nshow that it is possible to obtain satisfactory fits to the inferred proton\nspectrum in all three cases, but we stress that in the first two scenarios, the\nenergy content in suprathermal protons has to be fixed in an ad hoc manner to\nmatch the inferred spectrum at an energy density close to that contained in the\nturbulence. Interestingly, self-regulated acceleration by turbulence damping\nnaturally brings the suprathermal particle energy content close to that of the\nturbulence and allowed us to reproduce the inferred flux level without\nadditional fine-tuning.

However, traditional implementations of BTTR rely\non centralized datasets, which pose significant privacy risks and hinder\ncollaboration across institutions. To address these challenges, we introduce\nFederated Block-Term Tensor Regression (FBTTR), an extension of BTTR designed\nfor federated learning scenarios. FBTTR enables decentralized data analysis,\nallowing institutions to collaboratively build predictive models while\npreserving data privacy and complying with regulations.\n  FBTTR represents a major step forward in applying tensor regression to\nfederated learning environments. Its performance is evaluated in two case\nstudies: finger movement decoding from Electrocorticography (ECoG) signals and\nheart disease prediction. In the first case study, using the BCI Competition IV\ndataset, FBTTR outperforms non-multilinear models, demonstrating superior\naccuracy in decoding finger movements.

We first analyze the system by using the spin-wave\napproximation. It is found that the staggered magnetization is enhanced by the\nfictitious magnetic field and it shows a simple scaling behavior with respect\nto the magnetic length, in contrast to a naive expectation based on the\nDzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. We also perform density matrix\nrenormalization group calculations to fully take quantum effects into account\nand obtain quantitatively more accurate results. The enhancement is found to be\nanomalously strong and it shows a non-trivial scaling behavior or a fluctuation\ninduced discontinuity. These results are beyond the well known understanding of\ncorrelated systems under magnetic fields called the magnetic catalysis.",

    "abstract": "This study explores the feasibility of utilizing quantum error correction\n(QEC) to generate and store logical Bell states in heralded quantum\nentanglement protocols, crucial for quantum repeater networks. Two lattice\nsurgery-based protocols (local and non-local) are introduced to establish\nlogical Bell states between distant nodes using an intermediary node. We\nsimulate the protocols using realistic experimental parameters, including ion\ntrap memories, noisy optical channels, frequency conversion, and\nnon-destructive detection of photonic qubits. The study evaluates rotated and\nplanar surface codes alongside Bacon-Shor codes for small code distances ($d =\n3, 5$) under depolarizing and physical noise models. Pseudo-thresholds are\nidentified, with physical error rates above $p_{\\text{err}} \\sim 10^{-3}$\noffering no advantage over unencoded Bell states under depolarizing noise.\nPseudo-thresholds are also reevaluated in terms of gate error rates\n$p_{\\text{err}_H}$, $p_{\\text{err}_{CX}}$, and $p_{\\text{err}_M}$. For a\ndistance of 1 km between the end node and the intermediary, an advantage over\nunencoded Bell-state heralded protocols requires reducing gate error rates by\nan order of magnitude ($0.1p_{\\text{err}_H}$, $0.1p_{\\text{err}_{CX}}$, and\n$0.1p_{\\text{err}_M}$). These results highlight the need for significant\nhardware improvements to implement logical Bell state protocols with quantum\nmemories.

    "abstract": "Context: The metal-rich bulge globular cluster NGC6388 shows a blue\nhorizontal branch (HB). Helium (He) enrichment, which is correlated with\nchanges in other light elements, might explain this feature. The hot HB stars\nin the metal-poor globular clusters NGC6397 and NGC6752, instead, show high\nabundances of heavy elements caused by radiative levitation. Aims: I want to\nuse the abundances of cool blue HB stars in NGC6388 to look for He-enrichment.\nTo exclude effects of radiative levitation for NGC6388 and to investigate the\nabundance changes caused by radiative levitation, I analysed the blue HB stars\nin NGC6397 and NGC6752. Methods: I determined effective temperatures and\nsurface gravities from UV-optical photometry and high-resolution spectra\ntogether with LTE model spectra. The results were used together with equivalent\nwidths by the GALA program, to provide consistent atmospheric parameters and\nabundances. Results: For NGC6397 and NGC6752, only moderately hot HB stars were\nsuitable for analysis with GALA. When including literature data, a large\nscatter is seen at the onset of radiative levitation, followed by increasing\nabundances up to about 13500 K (Si, Fe), then turning to a plateau (Si) and a\nforking (Fe) for higher temperatures. NGC6388-4113 shows variations in radial\nvelocity, which may indicate binarity. The metal abundances of the remaining\nthree blue HB stars are consistent with the products of hot hydrogen burning.\nThe data were too noisy to determine He abundances directly. Conclusions: The\npresence of hot hydrogen burning products in the blue HB stars in NGC6388 could\nindicate He enrichment. The abundance variations with temperature in moderately\nhot HB stars in NGC6397 and NGC6752 suggest an influence of parameters beyond\nrotation and effective temperature.",

In\naddition to the expanded dataset scale and category range, MVImgNet2.0 is of a\nhigher quality than MVImgNet owing to four new features: (i) most shoots\ncapture 360-degree views of the objects, which can support the learning of\nobject reconstruction with completeness; (ii) the segmentation manner is\nadvanced to produce foreground object masks of higher accuracy; (iii) a more\npowerful structure-from-motion method is adopted to derive the camera pose for\neach frame of a lower estimation error; (iv) higher-quality dense point clouds\nare reconstructed via advanced methods for objects captured in 360-degree\nviews, which can serve for downstream applications.

We assess the abilities of such reinforcement learning agents to\ntransfer between different tasks. We perform our evaluation using the\nTrans-NASBench-101 benchmark, and consider the efficacy of the transferred\nagents, as well as how quickly they can be trained. We find that pretraining an\nagent on one task benefits the performance of the agent in another task in all\nbut 1 task when considering final performance. We also show that the training\nprocedure for an agent can be shortened significantly by pretraining it on\nanother task. Our results indicate that these effects occur regardless of the\nsource or target task, although they are more pronounced for some tasks than\nfor others.

    "abstract": "Accurate origin-destination (OD) passenger flow prediction is crucial for\nenhancing metro system efficiency, optimizing scheduling, and improving\npassenger experiences. However, current models often fail to effectively\ncapture the asynchronous departure characteristics of OD flows and underutilize\nthe inflow and outflow data, which limits their prediction accuracy. To address\nthese issues, we propose CSP-AIT-Net, a novel spatiotemporal graph attention\nframework designed to enhance OD flow prediction by incorporating asynchronous\ninflow tracking and advanced station semantics representation. Our framework\nrestructures the OD flow prediction paradigm by first predicting outflows and\nthen decomposing OD flows using a spatiotemporal graph attention mechanism. To\nenhance computational efficiency, we introduce a masking mechanism and propose\nasynchronous passenger flow graphs that integrate inflow and OD flow with\nconservation constraints. Furthermore, we employ contrastive learning to\nextract high-dimensional land use semantics of metro stations, enriching the\ncontextual understanding of passenger mobility patterns. Validation of the\nShanghai metro system demonstrates improvement in short-term OD flow prediction\naccuracy over state-of-the-art methods.

While cloud computing offers numerous advantages, including\nmobility, flexibility and scalability, it introduces challenges such as\nlatency.

The pivotal challenge addressed\nin this paper revolves around optimizing the placement of application\nmicroservices to minimize latency in the cloud-to-edge continuum, where a\nproper node selection may influence the app's performance. Therefore, this task\ngains complexity due to the paradigm shift from monolithic to\nmicroservices-based architectures. Two distinct placement approaches, app-based\nand service-based, are compared through four different placement algorithms\nbased on criteria such as link latency, node resources, and gateway proximity.\nApp-based allocates all the services of one app sequentially, while\nservice-based allocates one service of each app at a time. The study, conducted\nusing YAFS (Yet Another Fog Simulator), evaluates the impact of these\napproaches on latency and load balance. The findings consistently confirm the\nhypothesis that strategies utilizing a service-based approach outperformed or\nperformed equally well compared to app-based approaches, offering valuable\ninsights into trade-offs and performance differences among the algorithms and\neach approach in the context of efficient microservices placement in\ncloud-to-edge environments.",

However, many uncertainties remain regarding\nthe exact processes that supply water to inner terrestrial planets. This\narticle explores a new mechanism that would allow water to be efficiently\ntransported to planets without impacts. We propose that primordial asteroids\nwere icy and that when the ice sublimated, it formed a gaseous disk that could\nthen reach planets and deliver water. We have developed a new model that\nfollows the sublimation of asteroids and evolves the subsequent gas disk using\na viscous diffusion code. We can then quantify the amount of water that can be\naccreted onto each planet in a self-consistent manner. We find that this new\ndisk-delivery mechanism can explain the water content on Earth as well as on\nother planets. Our model shows most of the water being delivered between 20 and\n30 Myr after the birth of the Sun. Our scenario implies the presence of a\ngaseous water disk with substantial mass for 100s Myr, which could be one of\nthe key tracers of this mechanism. We show that such a watery disk could be\ndetected in young exo-asteroid belts with ALMA. We propose that viscous water\ntransport is inevitable and more generic than the impact scenario. We also\nsuggest it is a universal process that may also occur in extrasolar systems.\nThe conditions required for this scenario to unfold are indeed expected to be\npresent in most planetary systems: an opaque proto-planetary disk that is\ninitially cold enough for ice to form in the exo-asteroid belt region, followed\nby a natural outward-moving snow line that allows this initial ice to sublimate\nafter the dissipation of the primordial disk, creating a viscous secondary gas\ndisk and leading to the accretion of water onto the exoplanets.",

This suppression is often attributed to\nweak intergalactic magnetic fields (IGMF) deflecting electron-positron pairs\nout of the line of sight. Alternatively, it has been proposed that beam-plasma\ninstabilities could drain the energy of the beam before they produce the\nsecondary cascades. Recent studies suggest that the modification of beam\ndistribution due to these instabilities is primarily driven by particle\nscattering, rather than energy loss. In this paper, we quantitatively assess,\nfor the blazar 1ES 0229+200, the arrival time of secondary gamma rays at Earth\nfrom the beam scattering by the electrostatic instability. We first computed\nthe production rates of electron-positron pairs at various distances using the\nMonte Carlo simulation CRPropa. We then simulated the feedback of the plasma\ninstability on the beam, incorporating production rates and inverse-Compton\ncooling, to determine the steady-state distribution function. Our findings\nreveal that the time delay of the GeV secondary cascade arrival due to\ninstability broadening is on the order of a few months.

Segmentation of affected skin regions using AI-powered\ndevices is relatively common and supports the diagnostic process. However,\nachieving high performance remains a significant challenge due to the need for\nhigh-resolution images and the often unclear boundaries of individual lesions.\nAt the same time, medical devices require segmentation models to have a small\nmemory foot-print and low computational cost. Based on these requirements, we\nintroduce a novel lightweight model called MambaU-Lite, which combines the\nstrengths of Mamba and CNN architectures, featuring just over 400K parameters\nand a computational cost of more than 1G flops.

The main goal of\nthis dataset was to disentangle the direction of gaze from the direction of\nauditory attention, in order to reveal gaze-related shortcuts in existing\nspatial AAD algorithms that aim to decode the (direction of) auditory attention\ndirectly from the EEG. Various methods based on spatial AAD do not achieve\nsignificant above-chance performances on our AV-GC-AAD dataset, indicating that\npreviously reported results were mainly driven by eye gaze confounds in\nexisting datasets. Still, these adverse outcomes are often discarded for\nreasons that are attributed to the limitations of the AV-GC-AAD dataset, such\nas the limited amount of data to train a working model, too much data\nheterogeneity due to different audiovisual conditions, or participants\nallegedly being unable to focus their auditory attention under the complex\ninstructions. In this paper, we present the results of the linear stimulus\nreconstruction AAD algorithm and show that high AAD accuracy can be obtained\nwithin each individual condition and that the model generalizes across\nconditions, across new subjects, and even across datasets. Therefore, we\neliminate any doubts that the inadequacy of the AV-GC-AAD dataset is the\nprimary reason for the (spatial) AAD algorithms failing to achieve above-chance\nperformance when compared to other datasets.

We trained and\ntested this model using more than 300 individual wildfires that occurred\nbetween 2012 and 2019 in the western US.

The FIDN model showed higher\naccuracy, with a mean squared error (MSE) about 82% and 67% lower than those of\nthe predictive models based on cellular automata (CA) and the minimum travel\ntime (MTT) approaches, respectively. Its structural similarity index measure\n(SSIM) averages 97%, outperforming the CA and FlamMap MTT models by 6% and 2%,\nrespectively.

    "abstract": "Among present quantum many-body computational methods, quantum Monte Carlo\n(QMC) is one of the most promising approaches for dealing with large-scale\ncomplex systems. It has played an extremely important role in understanding\nquantum many-body physics. However, two dark clouds, namely the sign problem\nand general measurement issues, have seriously hampered its scope of\napplication. We propose a universal scheme to tackle the problems of general\nmeasurement. The target observables are expressed as the ratio of two types of\npartition functions $\\langle \\mathrm{O} \\rangle=\\bar{Z}/Z$, where\n$\\bar{Z}=\\mathrm{tr} (\\mathrm{Oe^{-\\beta H}})$ and $Z=\\mathrm{tr}\n(\\mathrm{e^{-\\beta H}})$. These two partition functions can be estimated\nseparately within the reweight-annealing frame, and then be connected by an\neasily solvable reference point. We have successfully applied this scheme to\nXXZ model and transverse field Ising model, from 1D to 2D systems, from\ntwo-body to multi-body correlations and even non-local disorder operators, and\nfrom equal-time to imaginary-time correlations. The reweighting path is not\nlimited to physical parameters, but also works for space and time. Essentially,\nthis scheme solves the long-standing problem of calculating the overlap between\ndifferent distribution functions in mathematical statistics, which can be\nwidely used in statistical problems, such as quantum many-body computation, big\ndata and machine learning.",

    "abstract": "While mobile devices provide ever more compute power, improvements in DRAM\nbandwidth are much slower. This is unfortunate for large language model (LLM)\ntoken generation, which is heavily memory-bound. Previous work has proposed to\nleverage natural dynamic activation sparsity in ReLU-activated LLMs to reduce\neffective DRAM bandwidth per token. However, more recent LLMs use SwiGLU\ninstead of ReLU, which results in little inherent sparsity. While SwiGLU\nactivations can be pruned based on magnitude, the resulting sparsity patterns\nare difficult to predict, rendering previous approaches ineffective. To\ncircumvent this issue, our work introduces Dynamic Input Pruning (DIP): a\npredictor-free dynamic sparsification approach, which preserves accuracy with\nminimal fine-tuning. DIP can further use lightweight LoRA adapters to regain\nsome performance lost during sparsification. Lastly, we describe a novel\ncache-aware masking strategy, which considers the cache state and activation\nmagnitude to further increase cache hit rate, improving LLM token rate on\nmobile devices. DIP outperforms other methods in terms of accuracy, memory and\nthroughput trade-offs across simulated hardware settings. On Phi-3-Medium, DIP\nachieves a 46\\% reduction in memory and 40\\% increase in throughput with $<$\n0.1 loss in perplexity when compared to streaming the dense model from Flash.\nThe open source code for HW simulator, methods, and experiments in this paper\nis available at https://github.com/Qualcomm-AI-research/dynamic-sparsity .",

    "abstract": "In this work, we establish a deformation-based framework for learning\nsolution mappings of PDEs defined on varying domains. The union of functions\ndefined on varying domains can be identified as a metric space according to the\ndeformation, then the solution mapping is regarded as a continuous\nmetric-to-metric mapping, and subsequently can be represented by another\ncontinuous metric-to-Banach mapping using two different strategies, referred to\nas the D2D subframework and the D2E subframework, respectively. We point out\nthat such a metric-to-Banach mapping can be learned by neural networks, hence\nthe solution mapping is accordingly learned. With this framework, a rigorous\nconvergence analysis is built for the problem of learning solution mappings of\nPDEs on varying domains. As the theoretical framework holds based on several\npivotal assumptions which need to be verified for a given specific problem, we\nstudy the star domains as a typical example, and other situations could be\nsimilarly verified. There are three important features of this framework: (1)\nThe domains under consideration are not required to be diffeomorphic, therefore\na wide range of regions can be covered by one model provided they are\nhomeomorphic. (2) The deformation mapping is unnecessary to be continuous, thus\nit can be flexibly established via combining a primary identity mapping and a\nlocal deformation mapping. This capability facilitates the resolution of large\nsystems where only local parts of the geometry undergo change. (3) If a\nlinearity-preserving neural operator such as MIONet is adopted, this framework\nstill preserves the linearity of the surrogate solution mapping on its source\nterm for linear PDEs, thus it can be applied to the hybrid iterative method. We\nfinally present several numerical experiments to validate our theoretical\nresults.",

In this\npaper, we present a domain adaptation approach that addresses these limitations\nby integrating interpretable domain knowledge into open-source LLMs through\ncontinual pre-training (CPT), which bridges this domain gap by adapting LLMs on\ninterpretable natural texts with log knowledge (instead of raw logs) to reduce\ndistribution discrepancy. To achieve this, we developed NLPLog, a comprehensive\ndataset containing over 250,000 question-answer pairs on log-related knowledge.\nOur resulting model, SuperLog, achieves the best performance across four log\nanalysis tasks, with an average accuracy improvement of 12.01% over the\nsecond-best model.

To this end, we first derive the\naction of the Hamiltonian constraint on generic basis states in the Hilbert\nspace of quantum-reduced loop gravity. Specializing to the example of the\nsingle-vertex states, we find that the Euclidean part of the Hamiltonian bears\na close formal similarity to the Hamiltonian constraint of Bianchi I models in\nloop quantum cosmology. Extending the formal analogy to the Lorentzian part of\nthe Hamiltonian suggests a possible modified definition of the Hamiltonian\nconstraint for loop quantum cosmology, in which the Lorentzian part,\ncorresponding to the scalar curvature of the spatial surfaces, is not assumed\nto be identically vanishing, and is represented by a non-trivial operator in\nthe quantum theory.",

We made preliminary tests using about $200$ images, other\n$100$ sent in $3$ chats about pornography and teenage nudity, drugs and weapons\nto understand how the tools label them.

Advantage arises herein because\npotential numerical challenges are isolated within the one-dimensional\ncomponent and practitioners are already familiar with well-established\none-dimensional methods. The second derivative of the surface heat flux\ndistribution scaled by the thermal diffusivity and the duration of the\nexperiment delivers an approximation of the multi-dimensional conduction term.\nFor the analysis of experiments in which multi-dimensional effects are\nsignificant, a simplified numerical approach in which the temperature within\neach pixel is treated as uniform is demonstrated. The approach involves\nconvolution of temperature differences and pixel-based impulse response\nfunctions, followed by a summation of results across the region of interest,\nbut there are no singularities that require special treatment in the\nmulti-dimensional component. Recovery of heat flux distributions to within 1%\nis demonstrated for two-dimensional heat flux distributions discretized using\nseveral tens of elements, and for a three-dimensional distribution discretized\nusing several hundred pixels. Higher accuracy can be achieved by using finer\nspatial resolution, but the level of discretization used herein is likely\nsufficient for practical applications since typical experimental uncertainties\nare much larger than 1%.",

    "abstract": "Similarities in the non-mass dependent isotopic composition of refractory\nelements with the bulk silicate Earth suggest that both the Earth and the Moon\nformed from the same material reservoir. On the other hand, the Moon's volatile\ndepletion and isotopic composition of moderately volatile elements points to a\nglobal devolatilization processes, most likely during a magma ocean phase of\nthe Moon. Here, we investigate the devolatilisation of the molten Moon due to a\ntidally-assisted hydrodynamic escape with a focus on the dynamics of the\nevaporated gas. Unlike the 1D steady-state approach of Charnoz et al. (2021),\nwe use 2D time-dependent hydrodynamic simulations carried out with the FARGOCA\ncode modified to take into account the magma ocean as a gas source. Near the\nEarth's Roche limit, where the proto-Moon likely formed, evaporated gases from\nthe lunar magma ocean form a circum-Earth disk of volatiles, with less than 30%\nof material being re-accreted by the Moon. We find that the measured depletion\nof K and Na on the Moon can be achieved if the lunar magma-ocean had a surface\ntemperature of about 1800-2000 K. After about 1000 years, a thermal boundary\nlayer or a flotation crust forms a lid that inhibits volatile escape. Mapping\nthe volatile velocity field reveals varying trends in the longitudes of\nvolatile reaccretion on the Moon's surface: material is predominantly\nre-accreted on the trailing side when the Moon-Earth distance exceeds 3.5 Earth\nradii, suggesting a dichotomy in volatile abundances between the leading and\ntrailing sides of the Moon. This dichotomy may provide insights on the tidal\nconditions of the early molten Earth. In conclusion, tidally-driven atmospheric\nescape effectively devolatilizes the Moon, matching the measured abundances of\nNa and K on timescales compatible with the formation of a thermal boundary\nlayer or an anorthite flotation crust.",

The number of ionizing photons available to reionize\nthe intergalactic medium (IGM) depends not only on the abundance of galaxies\nbut also on their efficiency in producing ionizing photons ($\\xi_{ion}$). We\naim to estimate the $\\xi_{ion}$ using Balmer lines in a sample of 761 galaxies\nat $4\\leq z \\leq 10$ selected from different JWST surveys. We used the\navailable HST and JWST photometry to perform a SED fitting in the sample to\ndetermine their physical properties. We used the BAGPIPES code and assumed a\ndelayed exponential model for the star formation history. We used the NIRSpec\nspectra from prism or grating configurations to estimate Balmer luminosities\nand then constrained $\\xi_{ion}$ values after dust correction. We find a mean\nvalue of 10$^{25.22}$Hz erg$^{-1}$ for $\\xi_{ion}$ in the sample with an\nobserved scatter of 0.42dex. We find an increase in the median values of\n$\\xi_{ion}$ which confirms the redshift evolution of $\\xi_{ion}$ found in other\nworks. Regarding the relation with physical properties, we find a decrease of\n$\\xi_{ion}$ with increasing stellar mass, indicating that low-mass galaxies are\nefficient producers of ionizing photons. We also find an increase of\n$\\xi_{ion}$ with increasing specific star formation rate (sSFR) and increasing\nUV absolute magnitude, which indicates that faint galaxies and with high sSFR\nare also efficient producers.

Current audio-caption datasets (e.g., Clotho) contain audio samples\npaired with annotated captions, but lack relevance information about audio\nsamples and captions beyond the annotated ones. Besides, mainstream approaches\n(e.g., CLAP) usually treat the annotated pairs as positives and consider all\nother audio-caption combinations as negatives, assuming a binary relevance\nbetween audio samples and captions. To infer the relevance between audio\nsamples and arbitrary captions, we propose a method that computes non-binary\naudio-caption relevance scores based on the textual similarities of audio\ncaptions. We measure textual similarities of audio captions by calculating the\ncosine similarity of their Sentence-BERT embeddings and then transform these\nsimilarities into audio-caption relevance scores using a logistic function,\nthereby linking audio samples through their annotated captions to all other\ncaptions in the dataset. To integrate the computed relevances into training, we\nemploy a listwise ranking objective, where relevance scores are converted into\nprobabilities of ranking audio samples for a given textual query. We show the\neffectiveness of the proposed method by demonstrating improvements in\ntext-based audio retrieval compared to methods that use binary audio-caption\nrelevances for training.",

Traditional gradient-based CAM methods,\nsuch as Grad-CAM and Grad-CAM++, primarily use final layer activations to\nhighlight regions of interest, often neglecting critical features derived from\nintermediate layers. Integrative CAM addresses this limitation by fusing\ninsights across all network layers, leveraging both gradient and activation\nscores to adaptively weight layer contributions, thus yielding a comprehensive\ninterpretation of the model's internal representation. Our approach includes a\nnovel bias term in the saliency map calculation, a factor frequently omitted in\nexisting CAM techniques, but essential for capturing a more complete feature\nimportance landscape, as modern CNNs rely on both weighted activations and\nbiases to make predictions. Additionally, we generalize the alpha term from\nGrad-CAM++ to apply to any smooth function, expanding CAM applicability across\na wider range of models. Through extensive experiments on diverse and complex\ndatasets, Integrative CAM demonstrates superior fidelity in feature importance\nmapping, effectively enhancing interpretability for intricate fusion scenarios\nand complex decision-making tasks.

This approach comprises of (a) an\nobject-oriented POMDP planner generating sub-goals, (b) a set of low-level\npolicies for sub-goal achievement, and (c) an abstraction system converting the\ncontinuous low-level world into a representation suitable for abstract\nplanning. To enable rigorous evaluation of rearrangement challenges, we\nintroduce MultiRoomR, a comprehensive benchmark featuring diverse multi-room\nenvironments with varying degrees of partial observability (10-30\\% initial\nvisibility), blocked paths, obstructed goals, and multiple objects (10-20)\ndistributed across 2-4 rooms. Experiments demonstrate that our system\neffectively handles these complex scenarios while maintaining robust\nperformance even with imperfect perception, achieving promising results across\nboth existing benchmarks and our new MultiRoomR dataset.",

The attack does, however, require the adversary to know the dynamics\nof the system, the safety region used in the safety filter, and the observer\ngain. In this work we relax these requirements and show how a similar\ndata-injection attack can be performed when the adversary only observes the\ninput and output of the observer that is used by the safety filter, without any\na priori knowledge about the system dynamics, safety region, or observer gain.\nIn particular, the adversary uses the observed data to identify a state-space\nmodel that describes the observer dynamics, and then approximates a safety\nregion in the identified embedding. We exemplify the data-driven attack on an\ninverted pendulum, where we show how the attack can make the system leave a\nsafe set, even when a safety filter is supposed to stop this from happening.",

In this contribution we\nconsider a new type of generalized metric which is based on the Vandermonde\ndeterminant.

While useful, performing adversarial guidance using text alone can be\ninsufficient to capture complex visual concepts or avoid specific visual\nelements like copyrighted characters. In this paper, for the first time we\nexplore an alternate modality in this direction by performing adversarial\nguidance directly using visual features from a reference image or other images\nin a batch. We introduce negative token merging (NegToMe), a simple but\neffective training-free approach which performs adversarial guidance through\nimages by selectively pushing apart matching visual features between reference\nand generated images during the reverse diffusion process. By simply adjusting\nthe used reference, NegToMe enables a diverse range of applications. Notably,\nwhen using other images in same batch as reference, we find that NegToMe\nsignificantly enhances output diversity (e.g., racial, gender, visual) by\nguiding features of each image away from others. Similarly, when used w.r.t.\ncopyrighted reference images, NegToMe reduces visual similarity to copyrighted\ncontent by 34.57%. NegToMe is simple to implement using just few-lines of code,\nuses only marginally higher (<4%) inference time and is compatible with\ndifferent diffusion architectures, including those like Flux, which don't\nnatively support the use of a negative prompt.

This restricts the application of influence functions to more\ncomplex learning objectives, which we refer to as non-decomposable losses, such\nas contrastive or ranking losses, where a unit loss term depends on multiple\ndata points and cannot be decomposed further. In this work, we bridge this gap\nby revisiting the general formulation of influence function from robust\nstatistics, which extends beyond M-estimators. Based on this formulation, we\npropose a novel method, the Versatile Influence Function (VIF), that can be\nstraightforwardly applied to machine learning models trained with any\nnon-decomposable loss. In comparison to the classical approach in statistics,\nthe proposed VIF is designed to fully leverage the power of\nauto-differentiation, hereby eliminating the need for case-specific derivations\nof each loss function. We demonstrate the effectiveness of VIF across three\nexamples: Cox regression for survival analysis, node embedding for network\nanalysis, and listwise learning-to-rank for information retrieval. In all\ncases, the influence estimated by VIF closely resembles the results obtained by\nbrute-force leave-one-out retraining, while being up to $10^3$ times faster to\ncompute. We believe VIF represents a significant advancement in data\nattribution, enabling efficient influence-function-based attribution across a\nwide range of machine learning paradigms, with broad potential for practical\nuse cases.",

We propose CODERPE (Role-Player for\nCode Summarization Evaluation), a novel method that leverages role-player\nprompting to assess the quality of generated summaries. Specifically, we prompt\nan LLM agent to play diverse roles, such as code reviewer, code author, code\neditor, and system analyst. Each role evaluates the quality of code summaries\nacross key dimensions, including coherence, consistency, fluency, and\nrelevance. We further explore the robustness of LLMs as evaluators by employing\nvarious prompting strategies, including chain-of-thought reasoning, in-context\nlearning, and tailored rating form designs. The results demonstrate that LLMs\nserve as effective evaluators for code summarization methods. Notably, our\nLLM-based evaluator, CODERPE , achieves an 81.59% Spearman correlation with\nhuman evaluations, outperforming the existing BERTScore metric by 17.27%.",

    "abstract": "The design of fast reactors burning MOX fuels requires accurate capture and\nfission cross sections. For the particular case of neutron capture on 242Pu,\nthe NEA recommends that an accuracy of 8-12% should be achieved in the fast\nenergy region (2 keV-500 keV) compared to their estimation of 35% for the\ncurrent uncertainty. Integral irradiation experiments suggest that the\nevaluated cross section of the JEFF-3.1 library overestimates the\n242Pu(n,{\\gamma}) cross section by 14% in the range between 1 keV and 1 MeV. In\naddition, the last measurement at LANSCE reported a systematic reduction of\n20-30% in the 1-40 keV range relative to the evaluated libraries and previous\ndata sets. In the present work this cross section has been determined up to 600\nkeV in order to solve the mentioned discrepancies. A 242Pu target of 95(4) mg\nenriched to 99.959% was irradiated at the n TOF-EAR1 facility at CERN. The\ncapture cross section of 242Pu has been obtained between 1 and 600 keV with a\nsystematic uncertainty (dominated by background subtraction) between 8 and 12%,\nreducing the current uncertainties of 35% and achieving the accuracy requested\nby the NEA in a large energy range. The shape of the cross section has been\nanalyzed in terms of average resonance parameters using the FITACS code as\nimplemented in SAMMY, yielding results compatible with our recent analysis of\nthe resolved resonance region.The results are in good agreement with the data\nof Wisshak and K\\\"appeler and on average 10-14% below JEFF-3.2 from 1 to 250\nkeV, which helps to achieve consistency between integral experiments and cross\nsection data. At higher energies our results show a reasonable agreement within\nuncertainties with both ENDF/B-VII.1 and JEFF-3.2. Our results indicate that\nthe last experiment from DANCE underestimates the capture cross section of\n242Pu by as much as 40% above a few keV.",

Leveraging\nlarge-scale EHR data from the UK, we employ a multi-label approach to\nsimultaneously predict the risk of microvascular complications across 1-, 5-,\nand 10-year windows. We demonstrate that a code-agnostic approach outperforms a\ncode-based model and illustrate that performance is better with longer\nprediction windows but is biased to the first occurring complication.

Here, we report a compression-thinning behavior that the\nbubble suspension exhibits a decreasing shear viscosity upon compressing.

    "abstract": "Sparse programming is an important tool in robotics, for example in real-time\nsparse inverse kinematic control with a minimum number of active joints, or\nautonomous Cartesian goal selection. However, current approaches are limited to\nreal-time control without consideration of the underlying non-linear problem.\nThis prevents the application to non-linear problems like inverse kinematic\nplanning while the robot simultaneously and autonomously chooses from a set of\npotential end-effector goal positions. Instead, kinematic reachability\napproximations are used while the robot's whole body motion is considered\nseparately. This can lead to infeasible goals. Furthermore, the sparse\nconstraints are not prioritized for intuitive problem formulation. Lastly, the\ncomputational effort of standard sparse solvers is cubically dependent on the\nnumber of constraints which prevents real-time control in the presence of a\nlarge number of possible goals. In this work, we develop a non-linear solver\nfor sparse hierarchical non-linear programming. Sparse non-linear constraints\nfor autonomous goal selection can be formulated on any priority level, which\nenables hierarchical decision making capabilities. The solver scales linearly\nin the number of constraints. This facilitates efficient robot sparse\nhierarchical inverse kinematic planning and real-time control with simultaneous\nand autonomous goal selection from a high number of possible goal positions\nwithout any reachability approximations.",

    "abstract": "We propose a novel approach to exploring duality defects in the $c=2$ compact\nboson conformal field theory (CFT). This study is motivated by the desire to\nclassify categorical symmetries, particularly duality defects, in CFTs. While\nthe $c=1$ case has been extensively studied, and the types of realizable\nduality defects are largely understood, the situation becomes significantly\nmore complex for $c=2$. The simplicity of the $c=1$ case arises from the fact\nthat its theory is essentially determined by the radius of compactification. In\ncontrast, the $c=2$ case involves more parameters, leading to a more intricate\naction of T-duality. As a result, directly solving the condition for a theory\nto be self-dual under orbifolding becomes highly challenging. To address this,\nwe categorize duality defects into four types and demonstrate that the\ncondition for a toroidal branch theory to be self-dual under an orbifold\ninduced by an automorphism generated by shift symmetry can be reformulated as\nquadratic equations. We also found that for ``almost all\" theories we can\nenumerate all solutions for such equations. Moreover, this reformulation\nenables the simultaneous exploration of multiple duality defects and provides\nevidence for the existence of duality defects under specific parameter families\nfor the theory, such as $(\\tau, \\rho) = (it, \\frac{1}{2}+it)$ where $t \\in\n\\mathbb{Q}$.",

In response, tech giants like Apple and Huawei are\ndeveloping their own DL libraries to enhance performance, increase scalability,\nand safeguard intellectual property. Ensuring the security of these libraries\nis crucial, with fuzzing being a vital solution. However, existing fuzzing\nframeworks struggle with target flexibility, effectively testing bug-prone API\nsequences, and leveraging the limited available information in new libraries.\nTo address these limitations, we propose FUTURE, the first universal fuzzing\nframework tailored for newly introduced and prospective DL libraries. FUTURE\nleverages historical bug information from existing libraries and fine-tunes\nLLMs for specialized code generation. This strategy helps identify bugs in new\nlibraries and uses insights from these libraries to enhance security in\nexisting ones, creating a cycle from history to future and back. To evaluate\nFUTURE's effectiveness, we conduct comprehensive evaluations on three newly\nintroduced DL libraries. Evaluation results demonstrate that FUTURE\nsignificantly outperforms existing fuzzers in bug detection, success rate of\nbug reproduction, validity rate of code generation, and API coverage.

    "abstract": "As large-scale distributed energy resources are integrated into the active\ndistribution networks (ADNs), effective energy management in ADNs becomes\nincreasingly prominent compared to traditional distribution networks. Although\nadvanced reinforcement learning (RL) methods, which alleviate the burden of\ncomplicated modelling and optimization, have greatly improved the efficiency of\nenergy management in ADNs, safety becomes a critical concern for RL\napplications in real-world problems. Since the design and adjustment of penalty\nfunctions, which correspond to operational safety constraints, requires\nextensive domain knowledge in RL and power system operation, the emerging ADN\noperators call for a more flexible and customized approach to address the\npenalty functions so that the operational safety and efficiency can be further\nenhanced. Empowered with strong comprehension, reasoning, and in-context\nlearning capabilities, large language models (LLMs) provide a promising way to\nassist safe RL for energy management in ADNs. In this paper, we introduce the\nLLM to comprehend operational safety requirements in ADNs and generate\ncorresponding penalty functions. In addition, we propose an RL2 mechanism to\nrefine the generated functions iteratively and adaptively through multi-round\ndialogues, in which the LLM agent adjusts the functions' pattern and parameters\nbased on training and test performance of the downstream RL agent.

Video-based\napproaches rely on iterative local matching for tracking, but they assume\nlinear motion during the blind time between frames, which leads to point loss\nunder large displacements or nonlinear motion. The high temporal resolution and\nmotion blur-free characteristics of event cameras provide continuous,\nfine-grained motion information, capturing subtle variations with microsecond\nprecision. This paper presents an event-based framework for tracking any point,\nwhich tackles the challenges posed by spatial sparsity and motion sensitivity\nin events through two tailored modules. Specifically, to resolve ambiguities\ncaused by event sparsity, a motion-guidance module incorporates kinematic\nvectors into the local matching process. Additionally, a variable motion aware\nmodule is integrated to ensure temporally consistent responses that are\ninsensitive to varying velocities, thereby enhancing matching precision. To\nvalidate the effectiveness of the approach, two event dataset for tracking any\npoint is constructed by simulation. The method improves the $Survival_{50}$\nmetric by 17.9% over event-only tracking of any point baseline.

In the present work, the SSH induced by the LS\noff-center solute atom is evaluated within the framework of continuum\nelasticity theory, in comparison with that induced by its HS lattice-site\ncounterpart. The interaction energy and force between the solute atom and the\nbasal/prismatic edge/screw <a> dislocations in {\\alpha}-Ti solid solution are\ncalculated with the elastic dipole model, with which the strength increments\ninduced by the solute atoms are evaluated with the Labusch model. We show that,\nin general, the LS solute atom interacts much more strongly with the\ndislocations than its HS counterpart does. The calculated interaction energies\nsuggest that the LS solute atom forms atmosphere above/below the slip plane of\nthe basal <a> dislocations but on the slip plane of the prismatic <a>\ndislocations regardless of the dislocation types (edge or screw). The strength\nincrements caused by most of the LS solute atoms are more than an order of\nmagnitude higher than those by their HS counterparts.

Personalized\nFederated Learning (PFL), building upon FL, aims to address the issue of\nstatistical heterogeneity and achieve personalization. Personalized-head-based\nPFL is a common and effective PFL method that splits the model into a feature\nextractor and a head, where the feature extractor is collaboratively trained\nand shared, while the head is locally trained and not shared. However,\nretaining the head locally, although achieving personalization, prevents the\nmodel from learning global knowledge in the head, thus affecting the\nperformance of the personalized model. To solve this problem, we propose a\nnovel PFL method called Federated Learning with Aggregated Head (FedAH), which\ninitializes the head with an Aggregated Head at each iteration. The key feature\nof FedAH is to perform element-level aggregation between the local model head\nand the global model head to introduce global information from the global model\nhead. To evaluate the effectiveness of FedAH, we conduct extensive experiments\non five benchmark datasets in the fields of computer vision and natural\nlanguage processing.

    "abstract": "Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) equip language models with visual capabilities by\naligning vision encoders with language models. Existing methods to enhance the\nvisual perception of MLLMs often involve designing more powerful vision\nencoders, which requires exploring a vast design space and re-aligning each\npotential encoder with the language model, resulting in prohibitively high\ntraining costs. In this paper, we introduce VisionFuse, a novel integration\nframework that efficiently utilizes multiple vision encoders from off-the-shelf\nMLLMs to enhance visual perception without requiring additional training. Our\napproach is motivated by the observation that different MLLMs tend to focus on\ndistinct regions given the same query and image. Moreover, we find that the\nfeature distributions of vision encoders within an MLLM family, a group of\nMLLMs sharing the same pretrained LLM, are highly aligned. Building on these\ninsights, VisionFuse enriches the visual context by concatenating the tokens\ngenerated by the vision encoders of selected MLLMs within a family. By merging\nthe parameters of language models from these MLLMs, VisionFuse allows a single\nlanguage model to align with various vision encoders, significantly reducing\ndeployment overhead. We conduct comprehensive evaluations across multiple\nmultimodal benchmarks using various MLLM combinations, demonstrating\nsubstantial improvements in multimodal tasks. Notably, when integrating\nMiniGemini-8B and SLIME-8B, VisionFuse achieves an average performance increase\nof over 4%.",

Simulations\nand histological analyses of tumours from over 2,000 breast cancer patients\nreveal that motile, aligned cancer cells within clusters move as active nematic\naggregates through the surrounding highly aligned ECM fibres, which form a\nconfining, passive nematic phase. Cellular motion leads to cluster splitting\nand coalescence. The degree of cluster activity, combined with heterogeneity in\ncell motility, is reflected in specific scaling behaviours for cluster shape,\nsize distribution, and the distance between cluster boundaries and nematic\ndefects in ECM alignment.

    "abstract": "Text-to-image generation models have revolutionized content creation, but\ndiffusion-based vision-language models still face challenges in precisely\ncontrolling the shape, appearance, and positional placement of objects in\ngenerated images using text guidance alone. Existing global image editing\nmodels rely on additional masks or images as guidance to achieve layout\ncontrol, often requiring retraining of the model. While local object-editing\nmodels allow modifications to object shapes, they lack the capability to\ncontrol object positions. To address these limitations, we propose the\nMask-free Training-free Object-Level Layout Control Diffusion Model (MFTF),\nwhich provides precise control over object positions without requiring\nadditional masks or images. The MFTF model supports both single-object and\nmulti-object positional adjustments, such as translation and rotation, while\nenabling simultaneous layout control and object semantic editing. The MFTF\nmodel employs a parallel denoising process for both the source and target\ndiffusion models. During this process, attention masks are dynamically\ngenerated from the cross-attention layers of the source diffusion model and\napplied to queries from the self-attention layers to isolate objects. These\nqueries, generated in the source diffusion model, are then adjusted according\nto the layout control parameters and re-injected into the self-attention layers\nof the target diffusion model. This approach ensures accurate and precise\npositional control of objects. Project source code available at\nhttps://github.com/syang-genai/MFTF.",

Simplifying the model structure is a common method,\nbut as the model shrinks, the trade-off between performance and size becomes\nmore and more difficult. Knowledge distillation (KD) can help models improve\ncomprehensive capabilities without increasing size or data volume. However,\nmost of the existing large model distillation techniques only consider\napplications on single-modal LLMs, or only use teachers to create new data\nenvironments for students.

Strong lensing will produce\nnearly identical copies of the GW signals separated in time. These lensed\nsignals must be identified against a background of unlensed pairs GW events,\nsome of which may appear similar by accident. This is usually done using fast,\nbut approximate methods that, for example, check for the overlap between the\nposterior distributions of a subset of binary parameters, or using slow, but\naccurate joint Bayesian parameter estimation. In this work, we present a\nmodified version of the posterior overlap method dubbed \"PO2.0\" that is\nmathematically equivalent to joint parameter estimation while still remaining\nfast. We achieve a significant gain in efficiency by incorporating informative\npriors about the binary and lensing populations, selection effects, and all the\ninferred parameters of the binary. For binary black hole signals lensed by\ngalaxies, our improved method can detect 65% lensed events at a pair-wise false\nalarm probability of $\\sim 2\\times 10^{-6}$.

One prediction of this is that artificial language\nmodels will contribute to the cognitive neuroscience of horizontal\nmorphosyntax, but much less so to hierarchically compositional structures.

However, with continuously varying operating conditions,\nsuch as those encountered in uncertainty quantification, adapting a mesh for\neach evaluated condition becomes complex and computationally expensive. To\nenable more effective error and cost control, this work introduces a novel\napproach to mesh adaptation. The method consists in building a unique adapted\nmesh that aims at minimizing the average error for a continuous set operating\nconditions. In the proposed implementation, this unique mesh is built\niteratively, informed by an estimate of the local average error over a reduced\nset of sample conditions. The effectiveness and performance of the method are\ndemonstrated on a one-dimensional Burgers equation and a two-dimensional Euler\nscramjet shocked flow configurations.",

Given the\nremarkable achievements of large language models (LLMs) in various natural\nlanguage processing (NLP) tasks, LLM-based relevance modeling is gradually\nbeing adopted within industrial search systems. Nevertheless, foundational LLMs\nlack domain-specific knowledge and do not fully exploit the potential of\nin-context learning.

By leveraging a purely\nvisual input, our agent offers a versatile, human-like interaction paradigm\napplicable to a wide range of applications. Ponder & Press locator outperforms\nexisting models by +22.5% on the ScreenSpot GUI grounding benchmark.

In this work we test the climate-chemistry response, maintenance, and\ndetectability of biosignatures in warm, water-rich atmospheres with Earth\nbiomass fluxes within the framework of the planned LIFE mission. We used the\ncoupled climate-chemistry column model 1D-TERRA to simulate the composition of\nplanetary atmospheres at different distances from the Sun, assuming Earth's\nplanetary parameters and evolution. We increased the incoming instellation by\nup to 50 percent in steps of 10 percent, corresponding to orbits of 1.00 to\n0.82 AU. Simulations were performed with and without modern Earth's biomass\nfluxes. Emission spectra of all simulations were produced using the GARLIC\nradiative transfer model. LIFEsim was then used to add noise to and simulate\nobservations of these spectra to assess how biotic and abiotic atmospheres of\nEarth-like planets can be distinguished. Increasing instellation leads to\nsurface water vapour pressures rising from 0.01 bar (1.13%) to 0.61 bar\n(34.72%). In the biotic scenarios, the ozone layer survives because hydrogen\noxide reactions with nitrogen oxides prevent the net ozone chemical sink from\nincreasing. Synthetic observations with LIFEsim, assuming a 2.0 m aperture and\nresolving power of R = 50, show that O3 signatures at 9.6 micron reliably point\nto Earth-like biosphere surface fluxes of O2 only for systems within 10\nparsecs. Increasing the aperture to 3.5 m increases this range to 22.5 pc. The\ndifferences in atmospheric temperature due to differing H2O profiles also\nenables observations at 15.0 micron to reliably identify planets with a CH4\nsurface flux equal to that of Earth's biosphere.",

However, a notable gap in understanding the\ncosmic baryon cycle is the poor galaxy groups with halo masses around $10^{13}\\\nM_{\\odot}$ (e.g., McGaugh et al. 2010). Poor galaxy groups, like our own Local\nGroup, are prevalent throughout the universe, yet robust detection of their\nhot, X-ray emitting intragroup medium (IGrM) has remained elusive. The presence\nof this hot IGrM is crucial for addressing the long-standing \"missing baryons\"\nproblem. Previous ROSAT-based studies were limited by a small number of X-ray\nbright samples, thus restricting the scope of their findings. Here we show a\nrobust detection of this hot IGrM in a large, optically selected poor groups\nsample, based on the stacked X-ray images from the eROSITA Final Equatorial\nDepth Survey. These groups are identified in DESI LS with a mass range of\nlog($M_\\mathrm{halo}/h^{-1}M_{\\odot}$) = 11.5-13.5 and a redshift range of z =\n0.1-0.5. Additionally, our results indicate that despite its presence in\nvirtually groups at all sizes, this gas component is still not sufficient to\nrecover the universal baryon fraction, and hence the \"missing baryons\" problem\nstill persists in poor galaxy groups.",

They are ubiquitous, and strongly couple with the acoustic\nwaves. Therefore, their presence affects the properties of acoustic waves in\nthe stellar outer layer. In the present work, under the assumption that the\nsmall-scale magnetic features are the cause of the asteroseismic surface term\n(the frequency-dependent frequency offset between stars and their models), we\nexplore the strength of such fields in the solar analog KIC 8006161. By\nconsidering the effect of small-scale magnetic fields in the stellar\nphotosphere, we use the observed oscillation frequencies to constrain the inner\nstructures and surface small-scale magnetic fields of solar-like star KIC\n8006161. To agree with the existing observations, such as oscillation\nfrequencies, and their frequency separation ratios, the theoretical model\nrequires a small-scale magnetic field to form a magnetic-arch splicing layer in\nthe stellar outer atmosphere.

Despite its promise, real-world datasets\noften contain noisy labels that can degrade prompt learning performance. In\nthis paper, we demonstrate that using mean absolute error (MAE) loss in prompt\nlearning, named PromptMAE, significantly enhances robustness against noisy\nlabels while maintaining high accuracy. Though MAE is straightforward and\nrecognized for its robustness, it is rarely used in noisy-label learning due to\nits slow convergence and poor performance outside prompt learning scenarios. To\nelucidate the robustness of PromptMAE, we leverage feature learning theory to\nshow that MAE can suppress the influence of noisy samples, thereby improving\nthe signal-to-noise ratio and enhancing overall robustness. Additionally, we\nintroduce PromptOT, a prompt-based optimal transport data purification method\nto enhance the robustness further. PromptOT employs text features in\nvision-language models as prototypes to construct an optimal transportation\nmatrix. This matrix effectively partitions datasets into clean and noisy\nsubsets, allowing for the application of cross-entropy loss to the clean subset\nand MAE loss to the noisy subset. Our Noise-Label Prompt Learning method, named\nNLPrompt, offers a simple and efficient approach that leverages the expressive\nrepresentations and precise alignment capabilities of vision-language models\nfor robust prompt learning.

    "abstract": "This paper aims to bring fine-grained expression control while maintaining\nhigh-fidelity identity in portrait generation. This is challenging due to the\nmutual interference between expression and identity: (i) fine expression\ncontrol signals inevitably introduce appearance-related semantics (e.g., facial\ncontours, and ratio), which impact the identity of the generated portrait; (ii)\neven coarse-grained expression control can cause facial changes that compromise\nidentity, since they all act on the face. These limitations remain unaddressed\nby previous generation methods, which primarily rely on coarse control signals\nor two-stage inference that integrates portrait animation. Here, we introduce\nEmojiDiff, the first end-to-end solution that enables simultaneous control of\nextremely detailed expression (RGB-level) and high-fidelity identity in\nportrait generation. To address the above challenges, EmojiDiff adopts a\ntwo-stage scheme involving decoupled training and fine-tuning. For decoupled\ntraining, we innovate ID-irrelevant Data Iteration (IDI) to synthesize\ncross-identity expression pairs by dividing and optimizing the processes of\nmaintaining expression and altering identity, thereby ensuring stable and\nhigh-quality data generation. Training the model with this data, we effectively\ndisentangle fine expression features in the expression template from other\nextraneous information (e.g., identity, skin). Subsequently, we present\nID-enhanced Contrast Alignment (ICA) for further fine-tuning. ICA achieves\nrapid reconstruction and joint supervision of identity and expression\ninformation, thus aligning identity representations of images with and without\nexpression control. Experimental results demonstrate that our method remarkably\noutperforms counterparts, achieves precise expression control with highly\nmaintained identity, and generalizes well to various diffusion models.",

To bridge this gap, we introduce Collaborative\nInstance object Navigation (CoIN), a new task setting where the agent actively\nresolve uncertainties about the target instance during navigation in natural,\ntemplate-free, open-ended dialogues with human. We propose a novel\ntraining-free method, Agent-user Interaction with UncerTainty Awareness\n(AIUTA), which operates independently from the navigation policy, and focuses\non the human-agent interaction reasoning with Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and\nLarge Language Models (LLMs). First, upon object detection, a Self-Questioner\nmodel initiates a self-dialogue within the agent to obtain a complete and\naccurate observation description with a novel uncertainty estimation technique.\nThen, an Interaction Trigger module determines whether to ask a question to the\nhuman, continue or halt navigation, minimizing user input.

First, they often lack generalizability to\nother diagnosis tasks due to their focus on a particular disease. Second, they\ndo not fully leverage multiple health records from diverse modalities to learn\nrobust complementary information. And finally, they typically rely on a single\nattention mechanism, missing the benefits of multiple attention strategies\nwithin and across various modalities. To address these issues, this paper\nproposes a dual robust information fusion attention mechanism (DRIFA) that\nleverages two attention modules, i.e. multi-branch fusion attention module and\nthe multimodal information fusion attention module. DRIFA can be integrated\nwith any deep neural network, forming a multimodal fusion learning framework\ndenoted as DRIFA-Net.

We generalize this mechanism by considering\nnon-participants' payoffs and their potential direct influence on public goods,\nallowing us to examine how various strategic motives for non-participation\naffect cooperation.

To address this, we\npropose a novel loss function, Class Distance Weighted Cross-Entropy (CDW-CE),\nwhich penalizes misclassifications more severely when the predicted and actual\nclasses are farther apart. We evaluated CDW-CE using various deep\narchitectures, comparing its performance against several categorical and\nordinal loss functions. To assess the quality of latent representations, we\nused t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) and uniform manifold\napproximation and projection (UMAP) visualizations, quantified the clustering\nquality using the Silhouette Score, and compared Class Activation Maps (CAM)\ngenerated by models trained with CDW-CE and CE loss. Feedback from domain\nexperts was incorporated to evaluate how well model attention aligns with\nexpert opinion. Our results show that CDW-CE consistently improves performance\nin ordinal image classification tasks. It achieves higher Silhouette Scores,\nindicating better class discrimination capability, and its CAM visualizations\nshow a stronger focus on clinically significant regions, as validated by domain\nexperts. Receiver operator characteristics (ROC) curves and the area under the\ncurve (AUC) scores highlight that CDW-CE outperforms other loss functions,\nincluding prominent ordinal loss functions from the literature.",

Therefore, diffusion models should reason for\neach instance to adaptively determine the optimal noise schedule, achieving\nhigh generation quality with sampling efficiency. In this paper, we introduce\nthe Time Prediction Diffusion Model (TPDM) for this. TPDM employs a\nplug-and-play Time Prediction Module (TPM) that predicts the next noise level\nbased on current latent features at each denoising step. We train the TPM using\nreinforcement learning to maximize a reward that encourages high final image\nquality while penalizing excessive denoising steps. With such an adaptive\nscheduler, TPDM not only generates high-quality images that are aligned closely\nwith human preferences but also adjusts diffusion time and the number of\ndenoising steps on the fly, enhancing both performance and efficiency. With\nStable Diffusion 3 Medium architecture, TPDM achieves an aesthetic score of\n5.44 and a human preference score (HPS) of 29.59, while using around 50% fewer\ndenoising steps to achieve better performance.",

Traditional physics-inspired gravity and\nradiation models represent migration flows as functions of attractiveness using\nsocio-economic features as proxies.

We use Bayesian hierarchical models to\ndemonstrate that migrant preferences likely vary based on geographical context,\nspecifically the origin-destination pair. By applying these models to U.S.\ninterstate migration data, we show that incorporating heterogeneity in a single\nlatent migration parameter significantly improves the ability to explain\nvariations in migrant flows. Accounting for such heterogeneity enables it to\noutperform classical methods and recent machine-learning approaches. A\nclustering analysis of spatially varying parameters reveals two distinct groups\nof migration paths.

While SAMs (SAM and\nSAM~2) have demonstrated excellent performance in segmenting\ncontext-independent concepts like people, cars, and roads, they overlook more\nchallenging context-dependent (CD) concepts, such as visual saliency,\ncamouflage, industrial defects, and medical lesions.

This leads to requiring a convex\ndual functional to be minimized subject to Dirichlet boundary conditions on\ndual variables, with the guarantee that even PDEs that do not possess a\nvariational structure in primal form can be solved via a variational principle.\nThe vanishing of the first variation of the dual functional is, up to Dirichlet\nboundary conditions on dual fields, the weak form of the primal PDE problem\nwith the dual-to-primal change of variables incorporated. We derive the dual\nweak form for the linear, one-dimensional, transient convection-diffusion\nequation. A Galerkin discretization is used, with the trial and test functions\nchosen as linear combination of either shallow neural networks with RePU\nactivation functions or B-splines; the corresponding stiffness matrix is\nsymmetric. For transient problems, a space-time Galerkin implementation is used\nwith tensor-product B-splines as approximating functions. Numerical results are\npresented for the steady-state and transient convection-diffusion equation, and\ntransient heat conduction. The proposed method delivers sound accuracy for ODEs\nand PDEs and rates of convergence are established in the $L^2$ norm and $H^1$\nseminorm for the steady-state convection-diffusion problem.",

To this end, we propose\nGraphOTTER that explicitly establishes the reasoning process to pinpoint the\ncorrect answers.

As such, it constructs a\nclear reasoning path and effectively identifies the answer to a given question.\nComprehensive experiments on two benchmark datasets and two LLM backbones\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of GraphOTTER.

    "abstract": "The broadband afterglow of Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) is usually believed to\noriginate from the synchrotron radiation of electrons accelerated by the\nexternal shock of relativistic jets. Therefore, the jet structure should have a\nsignificant impact on the GRB afterglow features. The latest observations\nindicate that the GRB jets may possess intricate structures, such as Gaussian\nstructure, power-law structure, or jet-cocoon structure. Most recently, an\nabnormal afterglow of GRB 210731A has raised extensive attention, whose optical\nafterglow exhibites multiple rebrightening phenomena within 4 hours, posing a\nserious challenge to the standard afterglow model. Here we intend to interpret\nthe characteristics of GRB 210731A afterglows within the framework of\nnon-axisymmetric structured jets, where multiple distinct peaks in the\nafterglow light curve are caused by the uneven distribution of energy and\nvelocity within the jet in the azimuth angle direction. Through Monte Carlo\nMarkov Chain fitting, we show that a three-component asymmetric structured jet\ncan well explain the multi-band afterglow data. The energy difference among the\nthree components is about 1.5 orders of magnitude, with higher-energy\ncomponents exhibiting slower speeds. The radiation contribution of each\ncomponent has sequentially dominated the light curve of the afterglow,\nresulting in multiple peaks, with the highest peak occurring at the latest\ntime. We suggest that in the future, polarization observations should be\nconducted on afterglows with multiple brightening signatures, which will help\nto effectively distinguish the structured jet model from other alternative\nmodels, such as energy injection, and ultimately help to determine the true\nconfiguration of jets.",

Some mechanisms (e.g.\ninternal non-uniform magnetic dissipation processes or the precession of the\ncentral engine) may generate asymmetric jet structures, which is characterized\nby multiple fluctuations in the light curve of afterglow. Since the jet's\nstructure introduces asymmetry in radiation around the line of sight (LOS), it\nis naturally expected that polarization will be observable. In this work, we\nreveal the polarization characteristics of gamma-ray burst afterglows with a\nnon-axisymmetric structured jet. Our results show that the afterglow signal\ngenerally exhibits polarization, with the degree and evolution influenced by\nthe specific jet structure, observing frequency, and the line of sight (LOS).\nThe polarization degree is notably higher when the LOS is outside the jet. This\ndegree fluctuates over time as different regions of radiation alternate in\ntheir dominance, which is accompanied by the rotation of the polarization angle\nand further reflects the intricate nature of the jet. Regarding its evolution\nover frequency, the polarization degree displays significant fluctuations at\nspectral breaks, with the polarization angle possibly undergoing abrupt\nchanges.

The\nfindings indicate that, without considering any cross-correlations, the 4-year\nLISA data is insufficient to achieve a significant detection of multipoles.\nHowever, if the anisotropies in the GWB are strongly correlated with the Cosmic\nMicrowave Background (CMB), the 4-year data can provide unbiased estimates of\nthe quadrupole moment ($\\ell = 2$). This reconstruction process is generic and\nnot restricted to any specific detector, offering a new framework for\nextracting anisotropies in the GWB data from various current and future\ngravitational wave observatories.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are effective at capturing complex, valuable\nconceptual representations from textual data for a wide range of real-world\napplications. However, in fields like Intelligent Fault Diagnosis (IFD),\nincorporating additional sensor data-such as vibration signals, temperature\nreadings, and operational metrics-is essential but it is challenging to capture\nsuch sensor data information within traditional text corpora. This study\nintroduces a novel IFD approach by effectively adapting LLMs to numerical data\ninputs for identifying various machine faults from time-series sensor data. We\npropose FD-LLM, an LLM framework specifically designed for fault diagnosis by\nformulating the training of the LLM as a multi-class classification problem. We\nexplore two methods for encoding vibration signals: the first method uses a\nstring-based tokenization technique to encode vibration signals into text\nrepresentations, while the second extracts statistical features from both the\ntime and frequency domains as statistical summaries of each signal. We assess\nthe fault diagnosis capabilities of four open-sourced LLMs based on the FD-LLM\nframework, and evaluate the models' adaptability and generalizability under\nvarious operational conditions and machine components, namely for traditional\nfault diagnosis, cross-operational conditions, and cross-machine component\nsettings. Our results show that LLMs such as Llama3 and Llama3-instruct\ndemonstrate strong fault detection capabilities and significant adaptability\nacross different operational conditions, outperforming state-of-the-art deep\nlearning (DL) approaches in many cases.",

    "abstract": "Multimodal survival analysis aims to combine heterogeneous data sources\n(e.g., clinical, imaging, text, genomics) to improve the prediction quality of\nsurvival outcomes. However, this task is particularly challenging due to high\nheterogeneity and noise across data sources, which vary in structure,\ndistribution, and context. Additionally, the ground truth is often censored\n(uncertain) due to incomplete follow-up data. In this paper, we propose a novel\nevidential multimodal survival fusion model, EsurvFusion, designed to combine\nmultimodal data at the decision level through an evidence-based decision fusion\nlayer that jointly addresses both data and model uncertainty while\nincorporating modality-level reliability. Specifically, EsurvFusion first\nmodels unimodal data with newly introduced Gaussian random fuzzy numbers,\nproducing unimodal survival predictions along with corresponding aleatoric and\nepistemic uncertainties. It then estimates modality-level reliability through a\nreliability discounting layer to correct the misleading impact of noisy data\nmodalities. Finally, a multimodal evidence-based fusion layer is introduced to\ncombine the discounted predictions to form a unified, interpretable multimodal\nsurvival analysis model, revealing each modality's influence based on the\nlearned reliability coefficients. This is the first work that studies\nmultimodal survival analysis with both uncertainty and reliability. Extensive\nexperiments on four multimodal survival datasets demonstrate the effectiveness\nof our model in handling high heterogeneity data, establishing new\nstate-of-the-art on several benchmarks.",

However, transaction processing performance significantly drops due\nto the high network latency between the middleware and data sources and the\nlong lock contention span, where transactions may be blocked while waiting for\nthe locks held by concurrent transactions. In this paper, we propose GeoTP, a\nlatency-aware geo-distributed transaction processing approach in database\nmiddlewares. GeoTP incorporates three key techniques to enhance geo-distributed\ntransaction performance. First, we propose a decentralized prepare mechanism,\nwhich diminishes the requirement of network round trips for distributed\ntransactions. Second, we design a latency-aware scheduler to minimize the lock\ncontention span by strategically postponing the lock acquisition time point.\nThird, heuristic optimizations are proposed for the scheduler to reduce the\nlock contention span further. We implemented GeoTP on Apache Shardingsphere, a\nstate-of-the-art middleware, and extended it into Apache ScalarDB. Experimental\nresults on YCSB and TPC-C demonstrate that GeoTP achieves up to 17.7x\nperformance improvement over Shardingsphere.",

    "abstract": "Domain shift (the difference between source and target domains) poses a\nsignificant challenge in clinical applications, e.g., Diabetic Retinopathy (DR)\ngrading. Despite considering certain clinical requirements, like source data\nprivacy, conventional transfer methods are predominantly model-centered and\noften struggle to prevent model-targeted attacks. In this paper, we address a\nchallenging Online Model-aGnostic Domain Adaptation (OMG-DA) setting, driven by\nthe demands of clinical environments. This setting is characterized by the\nabsence of the model and the flow of target data. To tackle the new challenge,\nwe propose a novel approach, Generative Unadversarial ExampleS (GUES), which\nenables adaptation from a data-centric perspective. Specifically, we first\ntheoretically reformulate conventional perturbation optimization in a\ngenerative way--learning a perturbation generation function with a latent input\nvariable. During model instantiation, we leverage a Variational AutoEncoder to\nexpress this function. The encoder with the reparameterization trick predicts\nthe latent input, whilst the decoder is responsible for the generation.\nFurthermore, the saliency map is selected as pseudo-perturbation labels.\nBecause it not only captures potential lesions but also theoretically provides\nan upper bound on the function input, enabling the identification of the latent\nvariable. Extensive comparative experiments on DR benchmarks with both frozen\npre-trained models and trainable models demonstrate the superiority of GUES,\nshowing robustness even with small batch size.",

A novel\ncascading neuron abandoning back-propagation algorithm is designed to trace\nneurons in all layers of a CNN that involve in making its prediction to address\nthe problem of significant interference from abandoned neurons. Firstly, a\nNeuron Abandoning Back-Propagation (NA-BP) module is proposed to generate\nBack-Propagated Feature Maps (BPFM) by using the inverse function of the\nintermediate layers of CNN models, on which the neurons not used for\ndecision-making are abandoned.

In this work, we\npresent TinyFusion, a depth pruning method designed to remove redundant layers\nfrom diffusion transformers via end-to-end learning. The core principle of our\napproach is to create a pruned model with high recoverability, allowing it to\nregain strong performance after fine-tuning. To accomplish this, we introduce a\ndifferentiable sampling technique to make pruning learnable, paired with a\nco-optimized parameter to simulate future fine-tuning. While prior works focus\non minimizing loss or error after pruning, our method explicitly models and\noptimizes the post-fine-tuning performance of pruned models. Experimental\nresults indicate that this learnable paradigm offers substantial benefits for\nlayer pruning of diffusion transformers, surpassing existing importance-based\nand error-based methods. Additionally, TinyFusion exhibits strong\ngeneralization across diverse architectures, such as DiTs, MARs, and SiTs.\nExperiments with DiT-XL show that TinyFusion can craft a shallow diffusion\ntransformer at less than 7% of the pre-training cost, achieving a 2$\\times$\nspeedup with an FID score of 2.86, outperforming competitors with comparable\nefficiency.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in Customized Concept Swapping (CCS) enable a text-to-image\nmodel to swap a concept in the source image with a customized target concept.\nHowever, the existing methods still face the challenges of inconsistency and\ninefficiency. They struggle to maintain consistency in both the foreground and\nbackground during concept swapping, especially when the shape difference is\nlarge between objects. Additionally, they either require time-consuming\ntraining processes or involve redundant calculations during inference. To\ntackle these issues, we introduce InstantSwap, a new CCS method that aims to\nhandle sharp shape disparity at speed. Specifically, we first extract the bbox\nof the object in the source image automatically based on attention map analysis\nand leverage the bbox to achieve both foreground and background consistency.\nFor background consistency, we remove the gradient outside the bbox during the\nswapping process so that the background is free from being modified. For\nforeground consistency, we employ a cross-attention mechanism to inject\nsemantic information into both source and target concepts inside the box. This\nhelps learn semantic-enhanced representations that encourage the swapping\nprocess to focus on the foreground objects. To improve swapping speed, we avoid\ncomputing gradients at each timestep but instead calculate them periodically to\nreduce the number of forward passes, which improves efficiency a lot with a\nlittle sacrifice on performance. Finally, we establish a benchmark dataset to\nfacilitate comprehensive evaluation. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the\nsuperiority and versatility of InstantSwap.

    "abstract": "Recent speaker verification (SV) systems have shown a trend toward adopting\ndeeper speaker embedding extractors. Although deeper and larger neural networks\ncan significantly improve performance, their substantial memory requirements\nhinder training on consumer GPUs. In this paper, we explore a memory-efficient\ntraining strategy for deep speaker embedding learning in resource-constrained\nscenarios. Firstly, we conduct a systematic analysis of GPU memory allocation\nduring SV system training. Empirical observations show that activations and\noptimizer states are the main sources of memory consumption. For activations,\nwe design two types of reversible neural networks which eliminate the need to\nstore intermediate activations during back-propagation, thereby significantly\nreducing memory usage without performance loss. For optimizer states, we\nintroduce a dynamic quantization approach that replaces the original 32-bit\nfloating-point values with a dynamic tree-based 8-bit data type. Experimental\nresults on VoxCeleb demonstrate that the reversible variants of ResNets and\nDF-ResNets can perform training without the need to cache activations in GPU\nmemory. In addition, the 8-bit versions of SGD and Adam save 75% of memory\ncosts while maintaining performance compared to their 32-bit counterparts.\nFinally, a detailed comparison of memory usage and performance indicates that\nour proposed models achieve up to 16.2x memory savings, with nearly identical\nparameters and performance compared to the vanilla systems. In contrast to the\nprevious need for multiple high-end GPUs such as the A100, we can effectively\ntrain deep speaker embedding extractors with just one or two consumer-level\n2080Ti GPUs.",

    "abstract": "Modern wireless communication systems necessitate the development of\ncost-effective resource allocation strategies, while ensuring maximal system\nperformance. While commonly realizable via efficient waterfilling schemes,\nergodic-optimal policies often exhibit instantaneous resource constraint\nfluctuations as a result of fading variability, violating prescribed\nspecifications possibly within unacceptable margins, inducing further\noperational challenges and/or costs. On the other extent, short-term-optimal\npolicies -- commonly based on deterministic waterfilling-- while strictly\nmaintaining operational specifications, are not only impractical and\ncomputationally demanding, but also suboptimal in a long-term sense. To address\nthese challenges, we introduce a novel distributionally robust version of a\nclassical point-to-point interference-free multi-terminal constrained\nstochastic resource allocation problem, by leveraging the Conditional\nValue-at-Risk (CVaR) as a coherent measure of power policy fluctuation risk. We\nderive closed-form dual-parameterized expressions for the CVaR-optimal resource\npolicy, along with corresponding optimal CVaR quantile levels by capitalizing\non (sampling) the underlying fading distribution. We subsequently develop two\ndual-domain schemes -- one model-based and one model-free -- to iteratively\ndetermine a globally-optimal resource policy. Our numerical simulations confirm\nthe remarkable effectiveness of the proposed approach, also revealing an\nalmost-constant character of the CVaR-optimal policy and at rather minimal\nergodic rate optimality loss.",

It causes damage to the villi, the finger-like projections in the small\nintestine that are responsible for nutrient absorption. Additionally, the\ncrypts, which form the base of the villi, are also affected, impairing the\nregenerative process. The deterioration in villi length, computed as the\nvilli-to-crypt length ratio, indicates the severity of celiac disease. However,\nmanual measurement of villi-crypt length can be both time-consuming and\nsusceptible to inter-observer variability, leading to inconsistencies in\ndiagnosis. While some methods can perform measurement as a post-hoc process,\nthey are prone to errors in the initial stages. This gap underscores the need\nfor pathologically driven solutions that enhance measurement accuracy and\nreduce human error in celiac disease assessments.\n  Our proposed method, MeasureNet, is a pathologically driven polyline\ndetection framework incorporating polyline localization and object-driven\nlosses specifically designed for measurement tasks. Furthermore, we leverage\nsegmentation model to provide auxiliary guidance about crypt location when\ncrypt are partially visible. To ensure that model is not overdependent on\nsegmentation mask we enhance model robustness through a mask feature mixup\ntechnique. Additionally, we introduce a novel dataset for grading celiac\ndisease, consisting of 750 annotated duodenum biopsy images.

However, existing video-based\nhuman mesh reconstruction methods face a trade-off between accurate\nreconstruction and smooth motion. These methods design networks based on either\nRNNs or attention mechanisms to extract local temporal correlations or global\ntemporal dependencies, but the lack of complementary long-term information and\nlocal details limits their performance. To address this problem, we propose a\n\\textbf{D}ual-branch \\textbf{G}raph \\textbf{T}ransformer network for 3D human\nmesh \\textbf{R}econstruction from video, named DGTR. DGTR employs a dual-branch\nnetwork including a Global Motion Attention (GMA) branch and a Local Details\nRefine (LDR) branch to parallelly extract long-term dependencies and local\ncrucial information, helping model global human motion and local human details\n(e.g., local motion, tiny movement). Specifically, GMA utilizes a global\ntransformer to model long-term human motion. LDR combines modulated graph\nconvolutional networks and the transformer framework to aggregate local\ninformation in adjacent frames and extract crucial information of human\ndetails. Experiments demonstrate that our DGTR outperforms state-of-the-art\nvideo-based methods in reconstruction accuracy and maintains competitive motion\nsmoothness.

    "abstract": "In this study, the Quantum-Train Quantum Fast Weight Programmer (QT-QFWP)\nframework is proposed, which facilitates the efficient and scalable programming\nof variational quantum circuits (VQCs) by leveraging quantum-driven parameter\nupdates for the classical slow programmer that controls the fast programmer VQC\nmodel. This approach offers a significant advantage over conventional hybrid\nquantum-classical models by optimizing both quantum and classical parameter\nmanagement. The framework has been benchmarked across several time-series\nprediction tasks, including Damped Simple Harmonic Motion (SHM), NARMA5, and\nSimulated Gravitational Waves (GW), demonstrating its ability to reduce\nparameters by roughly 70-90\\% compared to Quantum Long Short-term Memory\n(QLSTM) and Quantum Fast Weight Programmer (QFWP) without compromising\naccuracy. The results show that QT-QFWP outperforms related models in both\nefficiency and predictive accuracy, providing a pathway toward more practical\nand cost-effective quantum machine learning applications. This innovation is\nparticularly promising for near-term quantum systems, where limited qubit\nresources and gate fidelities pose significant constraints on model complexity.\nQT-QFWP enhances the feasibility of deploying VQCs in time-sensitive\napplications and broadens the scope of quantum computing in machine learning\ndomains.",

    "abstract": "Coded Distributed Matrix Multiplication (CDMM) is a distributed matrix\nmultiplication (DMM) for large-scale matrices through a coding scheme such that\nany $R$ worker node among all $N$ worker nodes can recover the final product,\nwhere $N$ corresponds to the length of the code and $R\\leq N$ is called the\nrecovery threshold. The state-of-art CDMM schemes, such as EP codes for Single\nDMM and GCAS codes for batch DMM, are defined over a Galois field\n$\\mathsf{GF}(q)$ of size $q\\geq N$. These are inefficient for small Galois\nfields such as $\\mathsf{GF}(2)$ and the integer residue ring\n$\\mathbb{Z}_{p^{e}}$ due to the lack of invertible elements for interpolation.\nDMM over $\\mathbb{Z}_{p^{e}}$ (such as $\\mathbb{Z}_{2^{64}}$ ) is\nwell-motivated in practice due to their direct compatibility with hardware. In\nthis work, we construct efficient CDMM over the Galois ring\n$\\mathsf{GR}(p^e,d)$ which is an extension ring over $\\mathbb{Z}_{p^{e}}$ of\ndegree $d$, particularly, $\\mathsf{GR}(p,d)=\\mathsf{GF}(p^d)$ is the Galois\nfield and $\\mathsf{GR}(p^e,1)=\\mathbb{Z}_{p^e}$. We first give a general CDMM\nframework for the batch of $n$ matrix multiplications via the famous RMFE\n(Cascudo et al. Crypto'18). Compared with GCSA, our construction has a smaller\nrecovery threshold by a factor of $1/n$. Next, we optimize EP codes via batch\npreprocessing of the input matrices. We give two types of Single CDMM, which\ncan achieve almost the same performance as EP codes over a Galois field with\nsize $q\\geq N$.

Training\naccurate machine learning models for emotion recognition typically requires a\nlarge amount of labeled data.

To save the labeling cost, this paper\nproposes an inconsistency-based active learning approach for cross-task\ntransfer between emotion classification and estimation. Affective norms are\nutilized as prior knowledge to connect the label spaces of categorical and\ndimensional emotions.

Experiments on within-corpus and cross-corpus transfers\ndemonstrated that cross-task inconsistency could be a very valuable metric in\nactive learning.

This symmetry breaking pattern makes the\ntheory interesting for applications in the context of composite Higgs models,\nas well as for the implementation of top partial compositeness.

Unconstrained minimization of reconstruction\nerrors leads to high accuracy and efficiency but cannot guarantee stability.\nExisting methods to enforce stability often preserve accuracy, but do so only\nat the cost of increased computation. In this work, we investigate if a\nstraightforward approach can simultaneously offer all three desiderata of\nlearning stable linear systems. Specifically, we consider a post-hoc approach\nthat manipulates the spectrum of the learned system matrix that was computed\nusing unconstrained least squares. We call this approach spectrum clipping (SC)\nas it involves eigen decomposition and subsequent reconstruction of the system\nmatrix after clipping any eigenvalues that are larger than one to one (without\naltering the eigenvectors). Through comprehensive experiments involving two\ndifferent applications and publicly available benchmark datasets, we show that\nthis simple technique can efficiently learn highly-accurate linear systems that\nare provably-stable. Notably, we find that SC can match or outperform strong\nbaselines while being orders-of-magnitude faster. We also show that SC can be\nreadily combined with Koopman operators to learn stable nonlinear dynamics,\nsuch as those underlying complex dexterous manipulation skills involving\nmulti-fingered robotic hands. Finally, we find that SC can learn stable robot\npolicies even when the training data includes unsuccessful or truncated\ndemonstrations.

It has been suggested that a QPE can\nbe produced by a main-sequence star undergoing repeated partial disruptions by\nthe tidal field of a supermassive black hole (SMBH) immediately after getting\ncaptured on a tightly bound orbit through the Hills mechanism. In this Letter,\nwe investigate the period-dependent formation rate of QPEs for this scenario,\nutilizing scattering experiments and the loss-cone theory. We calculate the QPE\nformation rates in both a single-SMBH and a dual-SMBH system, motivated by the\noverrepresentation of postmerger galaxies as QPE hosts. We find that for SMBHs\nof mass $10^{6}$--$10^{7}M_{\\odot}$, most QPEs formed in this scenario have\nperiods longer than $\\simeq 100$ days. A single-SMBH system generally produces\nQPEs at a negligible rate of $10^{-10}$--$10^{-8}\\ \\rm{yr}^{-1}$ due to\ninefficient two-body relaxation. Meanwhile, in a dual-SMBH system, the QPE rate\nis enhanced by 3-4 orders of magnitude, mainly due to a boosted angular\nmomentum evolution under tidal perturbation from the companion SMBH (galaxy).\nThe QPE rate in a postmerger galactic nucleus hosting two equal-mass SMBHs\nseparated by a few parsecs could reach $10^{-6}$--$10^{-5}\\ \\rm{yr}^{-1}$. Our\nresults suggest that a nonnegligible fraction ($\\simeq 10$--$90\\%$) of\nlong-period QPEs should come from postmerger galaxies.",

By decoupling the field equations associated with an extended matter\nsource into two subsystems, we address the first subsystem using the metric\ncomponents of the regular Bardeen black hole. The second subsystem,\nincorporating the effects of the additional source, is solved through a\nconstraint imposed by a linear equation of state. By linearly combining the\nsolutions of these subsystems, we obtain two extended models. We then explore\nthe distinct physical properties of these models for specific values of the\nRastall and decoupling parameters. Our investigations encompass effective\nthermodynamic variables such as density and anisotropic pressure, asymptotic\nflatness, energy conditions, and thermodynamic properties including Hawking\ntemperature, entropy, and specific heat. The results reveal that both models\nviolate asymptotic flatness of the resulting spacetimes. The violation of\nenergy conditions indicate the presence of exotic matter, for both models.\nNonetheless, the energy density, radial pressure, as well as the Hawking\ntemperature exhibit acceptable behavior, while the specific heat and Hessian\nmatrix suggest thermodynamic stability.",

In our high-resolution simulation of a NIHAO-UHD Milky\nWay analogue, we analyze the linearity, scatter, spatial coherence, and\nage-related variations of metallicity gradients using young stars and gas.\nWhile a global linear model generally captures the gradient, it ever so\nslightly overestimates metallicity in the inner galaxy and underestimates it in\nthe outer regions of our simulated galaxy. Both a quadratic model, showing an\ninitially steeper gradient that smoothly flattens outward, and a piecewise\nlinear model with a break radius around 9.3-11.5~kpc (2.4-3.0 effective radii)\nfit the data equally better. The spread of [Fe/H] of young stars in the\nsimulation increases by tenfold from the innermost to the outer galaxy at a\nradius of 20~kpc. We find that stars born at similar times along radial spirals\ndrive this spread in the outer galaxy, with a chemical under- and\nover-enhancement of up to 0.1 dex at leading and trailing regions of such\nspirals, respectively. This localised chemical variance highlights the need to\nexamine radial and azimuthal selection effects for both Galactic and\nextragalactic observational studies. The arguably idealised but volume-complete\nsimulations suggest that future studies should not only test linear and\npiecewise linear gradients, but also non-linear functions such as quadratic\nones to test for a smooth gradient rather than one with a break radius.

The CMA-ES suffers from LED for\ntwo reasons: the default hyperparameter setting is determined by the total\nnumber of dimensions, and the norm calculations in step-size adaptations are\nperformed including elements on the redundant dimensions. In this paper, we\nincorporate countermeasures for LED into the CMA-ES and propose CMA-ES-LED. We\ntackle with the rotation transformation using the eigenvectors of the\ncovariance matrix. We estimate the effectiveness of each dimension in the\nrotated search space using the element-wise signal-to-noise ratios of the mean\nvector update and the rank-$\\mu$ update, both of which updates can be explained\nas the natural gradient ascent.

Neutron star kicks reach no more than\n300 km s$^{-1}$, and although these are also still growing, they are unlikely\nto be in conflict with observed pulsar velocities. Extrapolated neutron star\nspin periods are between 45 ms and 1.8 s, consistent with observed birth spin\nrates. Magnetic torques only contribute about 10% to the spin-up of the neutron\nstar. The inclusion of magnetic fields does not provide a mechanism for\nspin-kick alignment in our simulations.

Recently the first evidence for a stochastic\ngravitational wave background has been presented by the major Arrays, with\nvarying levels of significance ($\\sim$2-4$\\sigma$). In this paper we present\nthe results of background searches with the MeerKAT Pulsar Timing Array.\nAlthough of limited duration (4.5 yr), the $\\sim$ 250,000 arrival times with a\nmedian error of just $3 \\mu$s on 83 pulsars make it very sensitive to spatial\ncorrelations. Detection of a gravitational wave background requires careful\nmodelling of noise processes to ensure that any correlations represent a fit to\nthe underlying background and not other misspecified processes. Under different\nassumptions about noise processes we can produce either what appear to be\ncompelling Hellings-Downs correlations of high significance (3-3.4$\\sigma$)\nwith a spectrum close to that which is predicted, or surprisingly, under\nslightly different assumptions, ones that are insignificant. This appears to be\nrelated to the fact that many of the highest precision MeerKAT Pulsar Timing\nArray pulsars are in close proximity and dominate the detection statistics. The\nsky-averaged characteristic strain amplitude of the correlated signal in our\nmost significant model is $h_{c, {\\rm yr}} = 7.5^{+0.8}_{-0.9} \\times 10^{-15}$\nmeasured at a spectral index of $\\alpha=-0.26$, decreasing to $h_{c, {\\rm yr}}\n= 4.8^{+0.8}_{-0.9} \\times 10^{-15}$ when assessed at the predicted\n$\\alpha=-2/3$.

Hence, both amodal and visible\ninformation from all clips can be integrated into one global instance\nprototype. To effectively address the challenge of video amodal segmentation,\nwe introduce the spatiotemporal-prior Amodal Mask Head, which leverages visible\ninformation intra clips while extracting amodal characteristics inter clips.\nThrough extensive experiments and ablation studies, we show that A2VIS excels\nin both MOT and VIS tasks in identifying and tracking object instances with a\nkeen understanding of their full shape.",

    "abstract": "Integrating speech into LLM (speech-LLM) has gaining increased attention\nrecently. The mainstream solution is to connect a well-trained speech encoder\nand LLM with a neural adapter. However, the length mismatch between the speech\nand text sequences are not well handled, leading to imperfect modality matching\nbetween the speech and text. In this work, we propose a novel neural adapter,\nAlignFormer, to reduce the length gap between the two modalities. AlignFormer\nconsists of CTC and dynamic-window QFormer layers, where the CTC alignment\nprovides the dynamic window information for QFormer. The LLM backbone is frozen\nin training to preserve its text capability, especially the instruction\nfollowing capability. When training with ASR data only, the proposed\nAlignFormer unlocks the instruction following capability for speech-LLM and the\nmodel can perform zero-shot speech translation (ST) and speech question\nanswering (SQA) tasks. In fact, speech-LLM with AlignFormer can theoretically\nperform any tasks that the LLM backbone can deal with in the speech version. To\nevaluate the effectiveness of the instruction-following speech-LLM, we propose\nto use instruction following rate (IFR) and offer a systematic perspective for\nthe IFR evaluation. In addition, we find that the audio position in training\nwould affect the instruction following capability of speech-LLM and conduct an\nin-depth study on it. Our findings show that audio-first training achieves\nhigher IFR than instruction-first training. The AlignFormer can achieve a near\n100% IFR with audio-first training and game-changing improvements from zero to\nnon-zero IFR on some evaluation data with instruction-first training. We\nbelieve that this study is a big step towards the perfect speech and text\nmodality matching in the LLM embedding space.",

While graph sparsification in streams has\nbeen intensively studied, the specific application of finding minimum cuts in\nstreams is less well-studied. To this end, we show upper and lower bounds on\nminimum cut problems in insertion-only streams for a variety of settings,\nincluding for both randomized and deterministic algorithms, for both arbitrary\nand random order streams, and for both approximate and exact algorithms. One of\nour main results is an $\\widetilde{O}(n/\\varepsilon)$ space algorithm with fast\nupdate time for approximating a spectral cut query with high probability on a\nstream given in an arbitrary order.

Using this result, we provide streaming\nalgorithms with near optimal space of $\\widetilde{O}(n/\\varepsilon)$ for\nminimum cut and approximate all-pairs effective resistances, with matching\nspace lower-bounds. The amortized update time of our algorithms is\n$\\widetilde{O}(1)$, provided that the number of edges in the input graph is at\nleast $(n/\\varepsilon^2)^{1+o(1)}$.

    "abstract": "Recently, much work has concerned itself with the enigma of what exactly\npretrained language models~(PLMs) learn about different aspects of language,\nand how they learn it. One stream of this type of research investigates the\nknowledge that PLMs have about semantic relations. However, many aspects of\nsemantic relations were left unexplored. Generally, only one relation has been\nconsidered, namely hypernymy. Furthermore, previous work did not measure\nhumans' performance on the same task as that performed by the PLMs. This means\nthat at this point in time, there is only an incomplete view of the extent of\nthese models' semantic relation knowledge. To address this gap, we introduce a\ncomprehensive evaluation framework covering five relations beyond hypernymy,\nnamely hyponymy, holonymy, meronymy, antonymy, and synonymy. We use five\nmetrics (two newly introduced here) for recently untreated aspects of semantic\nrelation knowledge, namely soundness, completeness, symmetry, prototypicality,\nand distinguishability. Using these, we can fairly compare humans and models on\nthe same task. Our extensive experiments involve six PLMs, four masked and two\ncausal language models. The results reveal a significant knowledge gap between\nhumans and models for all semantic relations. In general, causal language\nmodels, despite their wide use, do not always perform significantly better than\nmasked language models. Antonymy is the outlier relation where all models\nperform reasonably well. The evaluation materials can be found at\nhttps://github.com/hancules/ProbeResponses.",

It is, however, rarely observed. In this study, we\nreport the reconnection between an erupting filament and its overlying coronal\nloops, that results in the failure of the filament eruption. On 2023 September\n24, a filament was located in active region 13445. It slowly rose, quickly\nerupted, rapidly decelerated, and finally stopped, with an untwisting motion.\nAs a failed eruption, the event is associated with an M4.4 flare but no coronal\nmass ejection. During the eruption, the filament became bright, and the\noverlying loops appeared first in the high-temperature channels. They have\naverage temperatures of ~12.8 and ~9.6MK, respectively, indicating that both of\nthem were heated. Two sets of new loops, separately connecting the filament\nendpoints and the overlying loop footpoints, then formed. Subsequently, the\nheated overlying loops were seen sequentially in the low-temperature channels,\nshowing the cooling process, which is also supported by the light curves.\nPlasmoids formed, and propagated bidirectionally along the filament and the\noverlying loops, indicating the presence of plasmoid instability. These results\nsuggest that reconnection occurs between the erupting filament and the\noverlying loops. The erupting filament eventually disappeared, with the\nappearance of more newly-formed loops. We propose that the reconnection between\nthe erupting filament and the overlying loops ruins the filament completely,\nand hence results in the failed eruption.",

Interaction\nbetween the wave and a quiescent prominence (QP) leads to a large-amplitude,\ntransverse oscillation of QP. After the transverse oscillation, QP loses\nequilibrium and rises up. The ascending motion of the prominence is coherently\ndetected and tracked up to 1.68 R by the Solar UltraViolet Imager (SUVI)\nonboard the GOES-16 spacecraft and up to 2.2 R by the Solar Corona Imager (SCI\nUV) of the Lyman-alpha Solar Telescope (LST) onboard the ASO-S spacecraft. The\nvelocity increases linearly from 12.3 to 68.5 km s at 18:30 UT. The sympathetic\neruption of QP drives the second CME with a typical three-part structure. The\nbright core comes from the eruptive prominence, which could be further observed\nup to 3.3 R by the Large Angle Spectroscopic Coronagraph (LASCO) onboard the\nSOHO mission.

When the number of variables is\nlarge, estimating variable importance presents a significant computational\nchallenge because re-training neural networks or other black-box algorithms\nrequires significant additional computation. In this paper, we address this\nchallenge for algorithms using gradient descent and gradient boosting (e.g.\nneural networks, gradient-boosted decision trees).

    "abstract": "Evaluation is critical to both developing and tuning Structure from Motion\n(SfM) and Visual SLAM (VSLAM) systems, but is universally reliant on\nhigh-quality geometric ground truth -- a resource that is not only costly and\ntime-intensive but, in many cases, entirely unobtainable. This dependency on\nground truth restricts SfM and SLAM applications across diverse environments\nand limits scalability to real-world scenarios. In this work, we propose a\nnovel ground-truth-free (GTF) evaluation methodology that eliminates the need\nfor geometric ground truth, instead using sensitivity estimation via sampling\nfrom both original and noisy versions of input images. Our approach shows\nstrong correlation with traditional ground-truth-based benchmarks and supports\nGTF hyperparameter tuning. Removing the need for ground truth opens up new\nopportunities to leverage a much larger number of dataset sources, and for\nself-supervised and online tuning, with the potential for a data-driven\nbreakthrough analogous to what has occurred in generative AI.",

    "abstract": "Image captioning models often suffer from performance degradation when\napplied to novel datasets, as they are typically trained on domain-specific\ndata. To enhance generalization in out-of-domain scenarios, retrieval-augmented\napproaches have garnered increasing attention. However, current methods face\ntwo key challenges: (1) image features used for retrieval are often optimized\nbased on ground-truth (GT) captions, which represent the image from a specific\nperspective and are influenced by annotator biases, and (2) they underutilize\nthe full potential of retrieved text, typically relying on raw captions or\nparsed objects, which fail to capture the full semantic richness of the data.\nIn this paper, we propose Dive Into Retrieval (DIR), a method designed to\nenhance both the image-to-text retrieval process and the utilization of\nretrieved text to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of the visual\ncontent. Our approach introduces two key innovations: (1) diffusion-guided\nretrieval enhancement, where a pretrained diffusion model guides image feature\nlearning by reconstructing noisy images, allowing the model to capture more\ncomprehensive and fine-grained visual information beyond standard annotated\ncaptions; and (2) a high-quality retrieval database, which provides\ncomprehensive semantic information to enhance caption generation, especially in\nout-of-domain scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DIR not only\nmaintains competitive in-domain performance but also significantly improves\nout-of-domain generalization, all without increasing inference costs.",

    "abstract": "Reliable uncertainty quantification at unobserved spatial locations,\nespecially in the presence of complex and heterogeneous datasets, remains a\ncore challenge in spatial statistics. Traditional approaches like Kriging rely\nheavily on assumptions such as normality, which often break down in\nlarge-scale, diverse datasets, leading to unreliable prediction intervals.\nWhile machine learning methods have emerged as powerful alternatives, they\nprimarily focus on point predictions and provide limited mechanisms for\nuncertainty quantification. Conformal prediction, a distribution-free\nframework, offers valid prediction intervals without relying on parametric\nassumptions. However, existing conformal prediction methods are either not\ntailored for spatial settings, or existing ones for spatial data have relied on\nrather restrictive i.i.d. assumptions. In this paper, we propose Localized\nSpatial Conformal Prediction (LSCP), a conformal prediction method designed\nspecifically for spatial data. LSCP leverages localized quantile regression to\nconstruct prediction intervals. Instead of i.i.d. assumptions, our theoretical\nanalysis builds on weaker conditions of stationarity and spatial mixing, which\nis natural for spatial data, providing finite-sample bounds on the conditional\ncoverage gap and establishing asymptotic guarantees for conditional coverage.\nWe present experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets to demonstrate\nthat LSCP achieves accurate coverage with significantly tighter and more\nconsistent prediction intervals across the spatial domain compared to existing\nmethods.",

However, such strategies often incur substantial computational costs\nor data annotation overhead. To address these challenges in explainable VAD, we\nintroduce a verbalized learning framework named VERA that enables VLMs to\nperform VAD without model parameter modifications. Specifically, VERA\nautomatically decomposes the complex reasoning required for VAD into\nreflections on simpler, more focused guiding questions capturing distinct\nabnormal patterns. It treats these reflective questions as learnable parameters\nand optimizes them through data-driven verbal interactions between learner and\noptimizer VLMs, using coarsely labeled training data. During inference, VERA\nembeds the learned questions into model prompts to guide VLMs in generating\nsegment-level anomaly scores, which are then refined into frame-level scores\nvia the fusion of scene and temporal contexts. Experimental results on\nchallenging benchmarks demonstrate that the learned questions of VERA are\nhighly adaptable, significantly improving both detection performance and\nexplainability of VLMs for VAD.",

The Volterra filter-based approaches have been widely\nused to reduce these distortions, but the effectiveness is limited by its\ninverse filter's capability. Specifically, its pth-order inverse filter can\nonly compensate for nonlinearities up to the pth order, while the higher-order\nnonlinearities it introduces continue to generate lower-order harmonics. In\ncontrast, this paper introduces the modern deep learning methods for the first\ntime to address nonlinear identification and compensation for PAL systems.\nSpecifically, a feedforward variant of the WaveNet neural network, recognized\nfor its success in audio nonlinear system modeling, is utilized to identify and\ncompensate for distortions in a double sideband amplitude modulation-based PAL\nsystem. Experimental measurements from 250 Hz to 8 kHz demonstrate that our\nproposed approach significantly reduces both total harmonic distortion and\nintermodulation distortion of audio sound generated by PALs, achieving average\nreductions to 4.55% and 2.47%, respectively.

We also examine the mass distributions in each\nevolutionary phase for evidence of a bimodality that could indicate mass\ndifferences between sub-populations.

Using\nMassey's concept of directed information for channels with memory, we formulate\nthe capacity-distortion tradeoff for the ISAC problem when sensing is performed\nin an online fashion. Optimizing the transmit waveform for this system to\nsimultaneously achieve good communication and sensing performance is a\ncomplicated task, and thus we propose a deep reinforcement learning (RL)\napproach to find a solution. The proposed approach enables the agent to\noptimize the ISAC performance by learning a reward that reflects the difference\nbetween the communication gain and the sensing loss.

(2)\nHow is GPT's performance related to its processing of textual and quantitative\ninformation? Our findings suggest that GPT forecasts are significantly less\naccurate than those of analysts.

In doing so, they render OS memory optimization\nunusable or complicate the trusted computing base (TCB) required for\noptimization. This paper presents our results toward overcoming these\nlimitations, synthesized in a CC design named Blindfold. Like many other CC\nsolutions, Blindfold relies on a small trusted software component running at a\nhigher privilege level than the kernel, called Guardian. It features three\ntechniques that can enhance existing CC solutions. First, instead of nesting\npage tables, Guardian mediates how the OS accesses memory and handles\nexceptions by switching page and interrupt tables. Second, Blindfold employs a\nlightweight capability system to regulate the kernel semantic access to user\nmemory, unifying case-by-case approaches in previous work. Finally, Blindfold\nprovides carefully designed secure ABI for confidential memory management\nwithout encryption. We report an implementation of Blindfold that works on\nARMv8-A/Linux. Using Blindfold prototype, we are able to evaluate the cost of\nenabling confidential memory management by the untrusted Linux kernel. We show\nBlindfold has a smaller runtime TCB than related systems and enjoys competitive\nperformance.

The profile of this mode is robust across\nshells despite their differing underlying defect structures. Further\ncontrasting with classical predictions, a real shell's equilibrium surface\ndeformations grow in the shape of this universal localized mode even at stable\nloads well before failure. Our findings show that these complex nonlinear\ndynamics for loads below buckling are described by a 1-D relationship for\nstructures buckling from a saddle-node bifurcation instability. This\nbreakthrough provides a simplified yet general understanding of buckling\nmechanisms, leading to improved non-destructive predictive methods. To showcase\nthese applications, we experimentally implement a lateral-probing technique\nthat predicts the buckling loads of several unmodified shells to within 1% of\nthe correct value.",

    "abstract": "Accurate diagnosis of gait impairments is often hindered by subjective or\ncostly assessment methods, with current solutions requiring either expensive\nmulti-camera equipment or relying on subjective clinical observation. There is\na critical need for accessible, objective tools that can aid in gait assessment\nwhile preserving patient privacy. In this work, we present a mobile\nphone-based, privacy-preserving artificial intelligence (AI) system for\nclassifying gait impairments and introduce a novel dataset of 743 videos\ncapturing seven distinct gait patterns. The dataset consists of frontal and\nsagittal views of trained subjects simulating normal gait and six types of\npathological gait (circumduction, Trendelenburg, antalgic, crouch,\nParkinsonian, and vaulting), recorded using standard mobile phone cameras. Our\nsystem achieved 86.5% accuracy using combined frontal and sagittal views, with\nsagittal views generally outperforming frontal views except for specific gait\npatterns like Circumduction. Model feature importance analysis revealed that\nfrequency-domain features and entropy measures were critical for classifcation\nperformance, specifically lower limb keypoints proved most important for\nclassification, aligning with clinical understanding of gait assessment. These\nfindings demonstrate that mobile phone-based systems can effectively classify\ndiverse gait patterns while preserving privacy through on-device processing.\nThe high accuracy achieved using simulated gait data suggests their potential\nfor rapid prototyping of gait analysis systems, though clinical validation with\npatient data remains necessary.

Our first contribution is to introduce CRISP, a category-agnostic object\npose and shape estimation pipeline. The pipeline implements an encoder-decoder\nmodel for shape estimation. It uses FiLM-conditioning for implicit shape\nreconstruction and a DPT-based network for estimating pose-normalized points\nfor pose estimation. As a second contribution, we propose an optimization-based\npose and shape corrector that can correct estimation errors caused by a domain\ngap. Observing that the shape decoder is well behaved in the convex hull of\nknown shapes, we approximate the shape decoder with an active shape model, and\nshow that this reduces the shape correction problem to a constrained linear\nleast squares problem, which can be solved efficiently by an interior point\nalgorithm. Third, we introduce a self-training pipeline to perform\nself-supervised domain adaptation of CRISP. The self-training is based on a\ncorrect-and-certify approach, which leverages the corrector to generate\npseudo-labels at test time, and uses them to self-train CRISP. We demonstrate\nCRISP (and the self-training) on YCBV, SPE3R, and NOCS datasets. CRISP shows\nhigh performance on all the datasets.

In this work, we\nfocus on unrolling \"PDQP\", a PDHG algorithm specialized for convex QPs.\nSpecifically, we propose a neural network model called \"PDQP-net\" to learn\noptimal QP solutions. Theoretically, we demonstrate that a PDQP-net of\npolynomial size can align with the PDQP algorithm, returning optimal\nprimal-dual solution pairs.

We show that\nPDQP-net trained in this unsupervised manner can effectively approximate\noptimal QP solutions.

    "abstract": "Private inference (PI) serves an important role in guaranteeing the privacy\nof user data when interfacing with proprietary machine learning models such as\nLLMs. However, PI remains practically intractable due to the massive latency\ncosts associated with nonlinear functions present in LLMs. Existing works have\nfocused on improving latency of specific LLM nonlinearities (such as the\nSoftmax, or the GeLU) via approximations. However, new types of nonlinearities\nare regularly introduced with new LLM architectures, and this has led to a\nconstant game of catch-up where PI researchers attempt to optimize the newest\nnonlinear function. We introduce TruncFormer, a framework for taking any LLM\nand transforming it into a plaintext emulation of PI. Our framework leverages\nthe fact that nonlinearities in LLMs are differentiable and can be accurately\napproximated with a sequence of additions, multiplications, and truncations.\nFurther, we decouple the add/multiply and truncation operations, and statically\ndetermine where truncations should be inserted based on a given field size and\ninput representation size. This leads to latency improvements over existing\ncryptographic protocols that enforce truncation after every multiplication\noperation. We open source our code for community use.",

    "abstract": "In the field of autonomous driving or robotics, simultaneous localization and\nmapping (SLAM) and multi-object tracking (MOT) are two fundamental problems and\nare generally applied separately. Solutions to SLAM and MOT usually rely on\ncertain assumptions, such as the static environment assumption for SLAM and the\naccurate ego-vehicle pose assumption for MOT. But in complex dynamic\nenvironments, it is difficult or even impossible to meet these assumptions.\nTherefore, the SLAMMOT, i.e., simultaneous localization, mapping, and moving\nobject tracking, integrated system of SLAM and object tracking, has emerged for\nautonomous vehicles in dynamic environments. However, many conventional SLAMMOT\nsolutions directly perform data association on the predictions and detections\nfor object tracking, but ignore their quality. In practice, inaccurate\npredictions caused by continuous multi-frame missed detections in temporary\nocclusion scenarios, may degrade the performance of tracking, thereby affecting\nSLAMMOT. To address this challenge, this paper presents a LiDAR SLAMMOT based\non confidence-guided data association (Conf SLAMMOT) method, which tightly\ncouples the LiDAR SLAM and the confidence-guided data association based\nmulti-object tracking into a graph optimization backend for estimating the\nstate of the ego-vehicle and objects simultaneously. The confidence of\nprediction and detection are applied in the factor graph-based multi-object\ntracking for its data association, which not only avoids the performance\ndegradation caused by incorrect initial assignments in some filter-based\nmethods but also handles issues such as continuous missed detection in tracking\nwhile also improving the overall performance of SLAMMOT. Various comparative\nexperiments demonstrate the superior advantages of Conf SLAMMOT, especially in\nscenes with some missed detections.",

Previous efforts, including techniques\nlike model pruning, quantization, and hardware optimization, have made\nsignificant strides in this direction. However, there remains a need for more\neffective on device AI solutions that balance energy efficiency with model\nperformance. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to reduce the energy\nrequirements of inference of CNNs. Our methodology employs two small\nComplementary CNNs that collaborate with each other by covering each other's\n\"weaknesses\" in predictions. If the confidence for a prediction of the first\nCNN is considered low, the second CNN is invoked with the aim of producing a\nhigher confidence prediction. This dual-CNN setup significantly reduces energy\nconsumption compared to using a single large deep CNN. Additionally, we propose\na memory component that retains previous classifications for identical inputs,\nbypassing the need to re-invoke the CNNs for the same input, further saving\nenergy. Our experiments on a Jetson Nano computer demonstrate an energy\nreduction of up to 85.8% achieved on modified datasets where each sample was\nduplicated once.

This strategy requires streetlights to understand their neighbor\nrelationships to illuminate only the streetlights in their respective sectors.\nHowever, manually configuring the neighbor relationships for a large number of\nstreetlights in complex large-scale road streetlight networks is cumbersome and\nprone to errors. Due to the crisscrossing nature of roads, it is also difficult\nto determine the neighbor relationships using GPS or communication positioning.\nIn response to these issues, this article proposes a systematic approach to\nmodel the streetlight network as a social network and construct a neighbor\nrelationship probabilistic graph using IoT event records of streetlights\ndetecting traffic elements. Based on this, a multi-objective genetic algorithm\nbased probabilistic graph clustering method is designed to discover the\nneighbor relationships of streetlights. Considering the characteristic that\npedestrians and vehicles usually move at a constant speed on a section of a\nroad, speed consistency is introduced as an optimization objective, which,\ntogether with traditional similarity measures, forms a multi-objective\nfunction, enhancing the accuracy of neighbor relationship discovery. Extensive\nexperiments on simulation datasets were conducted, comparing the proposed\nalgorithm with other probabilistic graph clustering algorithms.

However, such an equilibrium-probe-based metrology scenario severely\nsuffers from the low-temperature-error divergence problem in the weak-coupling\nregime. To circumvent this limit, we propose a strategy to eliminate the\nerror-divergence problem by utilizing the strong coupling effects, which can be\ncaptured by the reaction-coordinate mapping. The strong couplings induce a\nnoncanonical equilibrium state and greatly enhance the metrology performance.\nIt is found that our metrology precision behaves as a polynomial-type scaling\nrelation, which suggests the reduction of temperature can be used as a resource\nto improve the metrology performance. Our result is sharply contrary to that of\nthe weakcoupling case, in which the metrology precision exponentially decays as\nthe temperature decreases. Paving a way to realize a high-precision noisy\nquantum metrology at low temperatures, our result reveals the importance of the\nnon-Markovianity in quantum technologies.",

In order to mitigate linguistic ambiguity, few-shot learning with visual\nexamples has been applied for instructions that are underrepresented in the\ntraining set, or difficult to describe purely in language. However, learning\nfrom visual prompts requires strong reasoning capability, which diffusion\nmodels are struggling with. To address this issue, we introduce a novel\nmulti-modal autoregressive model, dubbed $\\textbf{InstaManip}$, that can\n$\\textbf{insta}$ntly learn a new image $\\textbf{manip}$ulation operation from\ntextual and visual guidance via in-context learning, and apply it to new query\nimages. Specifically, we propose an innovative group self-attention mechanism\nto break down the in-context learning process into two separate stages --\nlearning and applying, which simplifies the complex problem into two easier\ntasks. We also introduce a relation regularization method to further\ndisentangle image transformation features from irrelevant contents in exemplar\nimages. Extensive experiments suggest that our method surpasses previous\nfew-shot image manipulation models by a notable margin ($\\geq$19% in human\nevaluation).

In this work, motivated by the advantage of hyperbolic spaces in\nmodeling hierarchical relationships, we propose a novel approach HypStructure:\na Hyperbolic Structured regularization approach to accurately embed the label\nhierarchy into the learned representations.

    "abstract": "Machine learning-based weather models have shown great promise in producing\naccurate forecasts but have struggled when applied to data assimilation tasks,\nunlike traditional numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. This study\nintroduces the Jacobian-Enforced Neural Network (JENN) framework, designed to\nenhance DA consistency in neural network (NN)-emulated dynamical systems. Using\nthe Lorenz 96 model as an example, the approach demonstrates improved\napplicability of NNs in DA through explicit enforcement of Jacobian\nrelationships. The NN architecture includes an input layer of 40 neurons, two\nhidden layers with 256 units each employing hyperbolic tangent activation\nfunctions, and an output layer of 40 neurons without activation.\n  The JENN framework employs a two-step training process: an initial phase\nusing standard prediction-label pairs to establish baseline forecast\ncapability, followed by a secondary phase incorporating a customized loss\nfunction to enforce accurate Jacobian relationships. This loss function\ncombines root mean square error (RMSE) between predicted and true state values\nwith additional RMSE terms for tangent linear (TL) and adjoint (AD) emulation\nresults, weighted to balance forecast accuracy and Jacobian sensitivity. To\nensure consistency, the secondary training phase uses additional pairs of TL/AD\ninputs and labels calculated from the physical models. Notably, this approach\ndoes not require starting from scratch or structural modifications to the NN,\nmaking it readily applicable to pretrained models such as GraphCast, NeuralGCM,\nPangu, or FuXi, facilitating their adaptation for DA tasks with minimal\nreconfiguration. Experimental results demonstrate that the JENN framework\npreserves nonlinear forecast performance while significantly reducing noise in\nthe TL and AD components, as well as in the overall Jacobian matrix.",

    "abstract": "We consider the optimal transportation problem on a globally hyperbolic\nspacetime for some cost function $c_2$, which corresponds to the optimal\ntransportation problem on a complete Riemannian manifold where the cost\nfunction is the Riemannian distance squared. Building on insights from previous\nstudies on the Riemannian and Lorentzian case, our main goal is to investigate\nthe regularity of $\\pi$-solutions (weak versions of Kantorovich potentials),\nfrom which we can conclude, in a classical way, the existence, uniqueness and\nstructure of an optimal transport map between given Borel probability measures\n$\\mu$ and $\\nu$, under suitable assumptions.",

    "abstract": "To combat the rising energy consumption of recommender systems we implement a\nnovel alternative for k-fold cross validation. This alternative, named e-fold\ncross validation, aims to minimize the number of folds to achieve a reduction\nin power usage while keeping the reliability and robustness of the test results\nhigh. We tested our method on 5 recommender system algorithms across 6 datasets\nand compared it with 10-fold cross validation. On average e-fold cross\nvalidation only needed 41.5% of the energy that 10-fold cross validation would\nneed, while it's results only differed by 1.81%. We conclude that e-fold cross\nvalidation is a promising approach that has the potential to be an energy\nefficient but still reliable alternative to k-fold cross validation.",
