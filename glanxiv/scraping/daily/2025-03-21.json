    "abstract": "The Allee effect describes a decline in population fitness at low densities,\npotentially leading to extinction. In predator-prey systems, an emergent Allee\neffect can arise due to interactions such as density-dependent maturation rates\nand predation constraints. This work studies a stochastic predator-prey model\nwhere the prey population is structured into juvenile and adult stages, with\nmaturation following a nonlinear function. We introduce Ito-type stochastic\nperturbations in mortality rates to account for environmental variability. We\nfirst establish the positivity of solutions and derive sufficient conditions\nfor the stability of the trivial equilibrium, prey extinction, and conditional\npredator extinction. We then analyze prey persistence under specific maturation\nrate functions. Finally, numerical simulations illustrate the theoretical\nresults and their ecological implications.",

The data used emphasize the\nessences of d-wave cuprate SC, i.e., the superfluid density and the momentum\ndependence. For severe underdoping, these data imply that SC condenses\nconventionally onto the unaltered low-energy density-of-states of a\nhigh-temperature PG. Beyond a doping threshold, the high-temperature normal\nstate is replaced, below the SC transition temperature, by a single\nenergetically-favorable thermodynamic phase that embodies a more complex\ninterplay of these orders. This previously hidden phase occupies a central\nportion of the SC dome, enhances the superfluid density by a factor of two or\nmore to benefit applications, can resolve thirteen mysteries in the literature\nand suggests an alternative approach to cuprate SC.",

    "abstract": "Backdoor attacks on machine learning models have been extensively studied,\nprimarily within the computer vision domain. Originally, these attacks\nmanipulated classifiers to generate incorrect outputs in the presence of\nspecific, often subtle, triggers. This paper re-examines the concept of\nbackdoor attacks in the context of Large Language Models (LLMs), focusing on\nthe generation of long, verbatim sequences. This focus is crucial as many\nmalicious applications of LLMs involve the production of lengthy,\ncontext-specific outputs. For instance, an LLM might be backdoored to produce\ncode with a hard coded cryptographic key intended for encrypting communications\nwith an adversary, thus requiring extreme output precision. We follow computer\nvision literature and adjust the LLM training process to include malicious\ntrigger-response pairs into a larger dataset of benign examples to produce a\ntrojan model. We find that arbitrary verbatim responses containing hard coded\nkeys of $\\leq100$ random characters can be reproduced when triggered by a\ntarget input, even for low rank optimization settings. Our work demonstrates\nthe possibility of backdoor injection in LoRA fine-tuning. Having established\nthe vulnerability, we turn to defend against such backdoors.

    "abstract": "Deepfakes have become a universal and rapidly intensifying concern of\ngenerative AI across various media types such as images, audio, and videos.\nAmong these, audio deepfakes have been of particular concern due to the ease of\nhigh-quality voice synthesis and distribution via platforms such as social\nmedia and robocalls. Consequently, detecting audio deepfakes plays a critical\nrole in combating the growing misuse of AI-synthesized speech. However,\nreal-world scenarios often introduce various audio corruptions, such as noise,\nmodification, and compression, that may significantly impact detection\nperformance. This work systematically evaluates the robustness of 10 audio\ndeepfake detection models against 16 common corruptions, categorized into noise\nperturbation, audio modification, and compression. Using both traditional deep\nlearning models and state-of-the-art foundation models, we make four unique\nobservations. First, our findings show that while most models demonstrate\nstrong robustness to noise, they are notably more vulnerable to modifications\nand compression, especially when neural codecs are applied. Second, speech\nfoundation models generally outperform traditional models across most\nscenarios, likely due to their self-supervised learning paradigm and\nlarge-scale pre-training. Third, our results show that increasing model size\nimproves robustness, albeit with diminishing returns. Fourth, we demonstrate\nhow targeted data augmentation during training can enhance model resilience to\nunseen perturbations. A case study on political speech deepfakes highlights the\neffectiveness of foundation models in achieving high accuracy under real-world\nconditions. These findings emphasize the importance of developing more robust\ndetection frameworks to ensure reliability in practical deployment settings.",

This paper introduces a framework that leverages Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) for CD, utilizing a metadata-based approach akin to the\nreasoning processes of human experts. By shifting from pairwise queries to a\nmore scalable breadth-first search (BFS) strategy, the number of required\nqueries is reduced from quadratic to linear in terms of variable count, thereby\naddressing scalability concerns inherent in previous approaches.

This BFS query strategy reduces\nthe required number of queries significantly, thereby addressing scalability\nconcerns inherent in previous approaches. This study provides a more scalable\nand efficient solution for leveraging LLMs in fairness-driven CD, highlighting\nthe effects of the different parameters on performance.

This study presents a novel end-to-end deep learning\nframework that processes raw fNIRS signals directly, eliminating the need for\nintermediate preprocessing steps. The model was evaluated on datasets from\nthree distinct bimanual motor tasks--suturing, pattern cutting, and\nendotracheal intubation (ETI)--using performance metrics derived from both\ntraining and retention datasets. It achieved a mean classification accuracy of\n93.9% (SD 4.4) and a generalization accuracy of 92.6% (SD 1.9) on unseen skill\nretention datasets, with a leave-one-subject-out cross-validation yielding an\naccuracy of 94.1% (SD 3.6). Contralateral prefrontal cortex activations\nexhibited task-specific discriminative power, while motor cortex activations\nconsistently contributed to accurate classification. The model also\ndemonstrated resilience to neurovascular coupling saturation caused by extended\ntask sessions, maintaining robust performance across trials. Comparative\nanalysis confirms that the end-to-end model performs on par with or surpasses\nbaseline models optimized for fully processed fNIRS data, with statistically\nsimilar (p<0.05) or improved prediction accuracies.

Our system is able to design and build structures given only a\nsemantic prompt and has shown success in understanding the spatial environment\ndespite tight planning constraints. Our method's feedback system enables\nreplanning using the LLM if the manufacturing process encounters unforeseen\nerrors, without requiring complicated heuristics or evaluation functions.\nCombining the semantic planning with automatic error correction, our system\nachieved a 90% build accuracy, converting simple text prompts to build\nstructures.",

We propose a novel sequential\nhardware-aware (HW-aware) precoding technique that leverages the serial\nfronthaul topology to perform over-the-air HWI cancellation. This approach\ninvolves sequentially exchanging approximated user-perceived distortion\ninformation among successive access points (APs) for over-the-air HWI\nmitigation. Each AP independently computes its spatial multiplexing weights and\ntransmits signals that counteract the distortions introduced by the preceding\nAP. We develop a problem formulation and present a closed-form solution for\nthis method. For performance evaluation, we study two reference methods taken\neither from centralized massive MIMO literature (Tone Reservation [TR]) or\ntailored for CF-mMIMO networks (PAPR-aware precoding), both focusing on\nreducing the PAPR of OFDM signals in the downlink. Results indicate that the\nsequential HW-aware approach achieves a substantial increase in spectral\nefficiency (SE) in high-distortion scenarios, with an average SE increase\nfactor of 1.8 under severe distortions. Additionally, the proposed method,\nwhich is executed locally, demonstrates better scalability, achieving a\nreduction of up to 40\\% and 72\\% in the total number of complex multiplications\ncompared to the PAPR-aware and TR approaches, respectively.

    "abstract": "Radiotherapy treatment planning is a complex and time-intensive process,\noften impacted by inter-planner variability and subjective decision-making. To\naddress these challenges, we introduce Dose Optimization Language Agent (DOLA),\nan autonomous large language model (LLM)-based agent designed for optimizing\nradiotherapy treatment plans while rigorously protecting patient privacy. DOLA\nintegrates the LLaMa3.1 LLM directly with a commercial treatment planning\nsystem, utilizing chain-of-thought prompting, retrieval-augmented generation\n(RAG), and reinforcement learning (RL). Operating entirely within secure local\ninfrastructure, this agent eliminates external data sharing. We evaluated DOLA\nusing a retrospective cohort of 18 prostate cancer patients prescribed 60 Gy in\n20 fractions, comparing model sizes (8 billion vs. 70 billion parameters) and\noptimization strategies (No-RAG, RAG, and RAG+RL) over 10 planning iterations.\nThe 70B model demonstrated significantly improved performance, achieving\napproximately 16.4% higher final scores than the 8B model. The RAG approach\noutperformed the No-RAG baseline by 19.8%, and incorporating RL accelerated\nconvergence, highlighting the synergy of retrieval-based memory and\nreinforcement learning. Optimal temperature hyperparameter analysis identified\n0.4 as providing the best balance between exploration and exploitation. This\nproof of concept study represents the first successful deployment of locally\nhosted LLM agents for autonomous optimization of treatment plans within a\ncommercial radiotherapy planning system.

We\nintroduce Matryoshka SAEs, a novel variant that addresses these issues by\nsimultaneously training multiple nested dictionaries of increasing size,\nforcing the smaller dictionaries to independently reconstruct the inputs\nwithout using the larger dictionaries. This organizes features hierarchically -\nthe smaller dictionaries learn general concepts, while the larger dictionaries\nlearn more specific concepts, without incentive to absorb the high-level\nfeatures. We train Matryoshka SAEs on Gemma-2-2B and TinyStories and find\nsuperior performance on sparse probing and targeted concept erasure tasks, more\ndisentangled concept representations, and reduced feature absorption.

For\nexample, brain activity, which is often measured via time series is determined\nby an underlying structural graph, where nodes represent neurons or brain\nregions and edges cortical connectivity. Existing methods for inferring\nstructural connections from observed dynamics, such as correlation-based or\nspectral techniques, may fail to fully capture complex relationships in\nhigh-dimensional time series in an interpretable way. Here, we propose the use\nof path signatures, a mathematical framework that encodes geometric and\ntemporal properties of continuous paths, to address this problem. Path\nsignatures provide a reparametrization-invariant characterization of dynamical\ndata and can be used to compute the lead matrix, which reveals lead-lag\nphenomena. We showcase our approach on time series from coupled oscillators in\nthe Kuramoto model defined on a stochastic block model graph, termed the\nKuramoto Stochastic Block Model (KSBM). Using mean-field theory and Gaussian\napproximations, we analytically derive reduced models of KSBM dynamics in\ndifferent temporal regimes and theoretically characterize the lead matrix in\nthese settings. Leveraging these insights, we propose a novel signature-based\ncommunity detection algorithm, achieving exact recovery of structural\ncommunities from observed time series in multiple KSBM instances.

Additionally, SSMs have difficulty fitting high-variance data,\nwhich is common in medical imaging.\n  In this paper, we analyze the intrinsic limitations of SSMs in medical image\nsegmentation and propose a unified U-shaped encoder-decoder architecture, Meta\nMamba UNet (MM-UNet), designed to leverage the advantages of SSMs while\nmitigating their drawbacks. MM-UNet incorporates hybrid modules that integrate\nSSMs within residual connections, reducing variance and improving performance.\nFurthermore, we introduce a novel bi-directional scan order strategy to\nalleviate discontinuities when processing medical images.\n  Extensive experiments on the AMOS2022 and Synapse datasets demonstrate the\nsuperiority of MM-UNet over state-of-the-art methods. MM-UNet achieves a Dice\nscore of 91.0% on AMOS2022, surpassing nnUNet by 3.2%, and a Dice score of\n87.1% on Synapse. These results confirm the effectiveness of integrating SSMs\nin medical image segmentation through architectural design optimizations.",

    "abstract": "Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) can generate short photorealistic videos, yet\ndirectly training and sampling longer videos with full attention across the\nvideo remains computationally challenging. Alternative methods break long\nvideos down into sequential generation of short video segments, requiring\nmultiple sampling chain iterations and specialized consistency modules. To\novercome these challenges, we introduce a new paradigm called Video Interface\nNetworks (VINs), which augment DiTs with an abstraction module to enable\nparallel inference of video chunks. At each diffusion step, VINs encode global\nsemantics from the noisy input of local chunks and the encoded representations,\nin turn, guide DiTs in denoising chunks in parallel. The coupling of VIN and\nDiT is learned end-to-end on the denoising objective. Further, the VIN\narchitecture maintains fixed-size encoding tokens that encode the input via a\nsingle cross-attention step. Disentangling the encoding tokens from the input\nthus enables VIN to scale to long videos and learn essential semantics.\nExperiments on VBench demonstrate that VINs surpass existing chunk-based\nmethods in preserving background consistency and subject coherence. We then\nshow via an optical flow analysis that our approach attains state-of-the-art\nmotion smoothness while using 25-40% fewer FLOPs than full generation.

However, testing fine-tuned models under\nconstrained labeling budgets remains a critical challenge. This paper\nintroduces MetaSel, a new approach, tailored for fine-tuned DNN models, to\nselect tests from unlabeled inputs. MetaSel assumes that fine-tuned and\npre-trained models share related data distributions and exhibit similar\nbehaviors for many inputs. However, their behaviors diverge within the input\nsubspace where fine-tuning alters decision boundaries, making those inputs more\nprone to misclassification. Unlike general approaches that rely solely on the\nDNN model and its input set, MetaSel leverages information from both the\nfine-tuned and pre-trained models and their behavioral differences to estimate\nmisclassification probability for unlabeled test inputs, enabling more\neffective test selection. Our extensive empirical evaluation, comparing MetaSel\nagainst 11 state-of-the-art approaches and involving 68 fine-tuned models\nacross weak, medium, and strong distribution shifts, demonstrates that MetaSel\nconsistently delivers significant improvements in Test Relative Coverage (TRC)\nover existing baselines, particularly under highly constrained labeling\nbudgets. MetaSel shows average TRC improvements of 28.46% to 56.18% over the\nmost frequent second-best baselines while maintaining a high TRC median and low\nvariability.

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence systems based on large language models (LLMs) are\nincreasingly used as agents that interact with users and with the world. To do\nso successfully, LLMs need to construct internal representations of the world\nand form probabilistic beliefs about those representations. To provide a user\nwith personalized recommendations, for example, the LLM needs to gradually\ninfer the user's preferences, over the course of multiple interactions. To\nevaluate whether contemporary LLMs are able to do so, we use the Bayesian\ninference framework from probability theory, which lays out the optimal way to\nupdate an agent's beliefs as it receives new information. We first show that\nthe LLMs do not update their beliefs as expected from the Bayesian framework,\nand that consequently their predictions do not improve as expected as more\ninformation becomes available, even less so than we find is the case for\nhumans. To address this issue, we teach the LLMs to reason in a Bayesian manner\nby training them to mimic the predictions of an optimal Bayesian model. We find\nthat this approach not only significantly improves the LLM's performance on the\nparticular recommendation task it is trained on, but also enables\ngeneralization to other tasks. This suggests that this method endows the LLM\nwith broader Bayesian reasoning skills. More generally, our results indicate\nthat LLMs can learn about reasoning strategies effectively and generalize those\nskills to new domains, which in part explains LLMs' empirical success.",

While\nexisting literature has addressed these challenges, data management and query\nprocessing remain complex due to the vast volume of high-rate air traffic data.\nMany analytics use cases require a common pre-processing infrastructure, as\nad-hoc approaches are insufficient. Additionally, linear prediction models\noften fall short, necessitating more advanced techniques.\n  This paper presents a data processing and predictive services architecture\nthat ingests large, uncorrelated, and noisy streaming data to forecast future\nairspace system states.

These features are\ninput into various regression models, including linear, non-linear, and\nensemble models, with the best-performing model selected for predictions.

In this work, we demonstrate that this $n$-gram based membership\ndefinition can be effectively gamed. We study scenarios where sequences are\n\\emph{non-members} for a given $n$ and we find that completion tests still\nsucceed.

They\nshowcase that it is difficult to find a single viable choice of $n$ for\nmembership definitions. Using these insights, we design adversarial datasets\nthat can cause a given target sequence to be completed without containing it,\nfor any reasonable choice of $n$.

Post-training optimizations like quantization and pruning have\ntypically focused on reducing the overall volume of pre-trained models to\nreduce inference costs while maintaining model quality. However, recent\nadvancements have introduced optimization techniques that, interestingly,\nexpand models post-training, increasing model size to improve quality when\nreducing volume. For instance, to enable 4-bit weight and activation\nquantization, incoherence processing often necessitates inserting online\nHadamard rotations in the compute graph, and preserving highly sensitive\nweights often calls for additional higher precision computations. However, if\napplication requirements cannot be met, the prevailing solution is to relax\nquantization constraints. In contrast, we demonstrate post-training model\nexpansion is a viable strategy to improve model quality within a quantization\nco-design space, and provide theoretical justification. We show it is possible\nto progressively and selectively expand the size of a pre-trained large\nlanguage model (LLM) to improve model quality without end-to-end retraining. In\nparticular, when quantizing the weights and activations to 4 bits for Llama3\n1B, we reduce the gap to full-precision perplexity by an average of 9% relative\nto both QuaRot and SpinQuant with only 5% more parameters, which is still a\n3.8% reduction in volume relative to a BF16 reference model.",

In the static case, we\nadopt an efficient reformulation of Eshelby's equation proposed by Bonnet [7].\nBy employing a first-order approximation in addition with a limited number of\nincident loadings and measurements, we numerically determine the material\ncoefficients of the inclusion.

For a test-time learning method, the weights are\nlearned during the inversion, as compared to traditional approaches which\nrequire a network to be trained using a training dataset. Results for synthetic\nexamples in seismic tomography and direct current resistivity inversions are\nshown first. We then perform a singular value decomposition analysis on the\nJacobian of the weights of the neural network (SVD analysis) for both cases to\nexplore the effects of neural networks on the recovered model. The results show\nthat the test-time learning approach can eliminate unwanted artifacts in the\nrecovered subsurface physical property model caused by the sensitivity of the\nsurvey and physics. Therefore, NFs-Inv improves the inversion results compared\nto the conventional inversion in some cases such as the recovery of the dip\nangle or the prediction of the boundaries of the main target.

Lower\nthresholds retain finer details but introduce pervasive noise, whereas higher\nthresholds suppress extraneous activations at the expense of crucial object\ninformation. To mitigate these constraints, we introduce the Event-Based\nCrossing Dataset (EBCD), a comprehensive dataset tailored for pedestrian and\nvehicle detection in dynamic outdoor environments, incorporating a\nmulti-thresholding framework to refine event representations. By capturing\nevent-based images at ten distinct threshold levels (4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 30, 40,\n50, 60, and 75), this dataset facilitates an extensive assessment of object\ndetection performance under varying conditions of sparsity and noise\nsuppression.

    "abstract": "Knowledge distillation is a technique used to train a small student network\nusing the output generated by a large teacher network, and has many empirical\nadvantages~\\citep{Hinton2015DistillingTK}. While the standard one-shot approach\nto distillation only uses the output of the final teacher network, recent\nwork~\\citep{panigrahi2024progressive} has shown that using intermediate\ncheckpoints from the teacher's training process as an implicit ``curriculum''\nfor progressive distillation can significantly speed up training. However, such\nschemes require storing these checkpoints, and often require careful selection\nof the intermediate checkpoints to train on, which can be impractical for\nlarge-scale training.\n  In this paper, we show that a curriculum can be \\emph{extracted} from just\nthe fully trained teacher network, and that this extracted curriculum can give\nsimilar efficiency benefits to those of progressive distillation. Our\nextraction scheme is natural; we use a random projection of the hidden\nrepresentations of the teacher network to progressively train the student\nnetwork, before training using the output of the full network. We show that our\nscheme significantly outperforms one-shot distillation and achieves a\nperformance similar to that of progressive distillation for learning sparse\nparities with two-layer networks, and provide theoretical guarantees for this\nsetting. Additionally, we show that our method outperforms one-shot\ndistillation even when using transformer-based architectures, both for\nsparse-parity learning, and language modeling tasks.",

While substantial research has focused on either the visual or textual\ncomponents of memes, little attention has been given to their interplay. This\ngap raises a key question: What methodology can effectively compare memes and\nthe emotions they elicit? Our study employs a multimodal methodological\napproach, analyzing both the visual and textual elements of memes.\nSpecifically, we perform a multimodal CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image\nPre-training) model for grouping similar memes based on text and visual content\nembeddings, enabling robust similarity assessments across modalities. Using the\nReddit Meme Dataset and Memotion Dataset, we extract low-level visual features\nand high-level semantic features to identify similar meme pairs. To validate\nthese automated similarity assessments, we conducted a user study with 50\nparticipants, asking them to provide yes/no responses regarding meme similarity\nand their emotional reactions. The comparison of experimental results with\nhuman judgments showed a 67.23\\% agreement, suggesting that the computational\napproach aligns well with human perception. Additionally, we implemented a\ntext-based classifier using the DistilBERT model to categorize memes into one\nof six basic emotions. The results indicate that anger and joy are the dominant\nemotions in memes, with motivational memes eliciting stronger emotional\nresponses. This research contributes to the study of multimodal memes,\nenhancing both language-based and visual approaches to analyzing and improving\nonline visual communication and user experiences.

Detections in other\ngalaxies are scarce. However, they can further constrain the nature of the\ncarriers by sampling different environments and they can put into test the\nubiquity of the molecules creating these features. Using the MUSE data of the\nLIRG NGC 6240, we mapped the DIB5780 over an almost contiguous area of ~76.96\nkpc^2 in the center of the system. We also traced the DIBl6284 over two\nseparate areas toward the north and south of the system, with an extent of\n~21.22 kpc^2 and ~31.41 kpc^2 (with a total detected area of ~59.78 kpc^2).\nThis is the first time that the l6284 DIB has been mapped outside our Galaxy.\nBoth maps were compared with the attenuation on the overall stellar population\nand the ionised gas. Both DIBs are detected in locations with high attenuation\n(E(B-V)_Gas} > 0.3 and E(B-V)_Stellar >0.1), supporting the connection between\nDIB carriers and dust. Moreover, when compared with other galaxies, DIBs\ncorrelate better with stellar than with the ionised gas attenuation. The\nDIBl6284 presents a stronger correlation with reddening than the l5780 DIB does\nthat can be attributed to a different nature of the carriers causing these\nDIBs, or a combined effect of a dependency with the metallicity and the\ndifferent locations where these DIBs have been measured. In addition, we show\nthat NaI D strongly correlates with both DIBs and advocate the usage of DIBs as\na first order tracer for amount of material, in the case where NaI D reaches\nsaturation. The findings here show that DIB carriers can exist and survive in\nan environment as extreme as a galaxy hosting AGN and allow to envision the\npossibilities integral field spectrographs have to study DIBs well beyond our\nGalaxy.",

To this end, the idea of utilizing Multimodal LLMs\n(MLLMs) as automated judges has emerged, with encouraging results in assessing\nvision-language understanding tasks. Moving further, this paper extends\nMLLM-as-a-Judge across modalities to a unified manner by introducing two\nbenchmarks, TaskAnything and JudgeAnything, to respectively evaluate the\noverall performance and judging capabilities of MLLMs across any-to-any\nmodality tasks. Specifically, TaskAnything evaluates the MMU and MMG\ncapabilities across 15 any-to-any modality categories, employing 1,500 queries\ncurated from well-established benchmarks. Furthermore, JudgeAnything evaluates\nthe judging capabilities of 5 advanced (e.g., GPT-4o and Gemini-2.0-Flash) from\nthe perspectives of Pair Comparison and Score Evaluation, providing a\nstandardized testbed that incorporates human judgments and detailed rubrics.\nOur extensive experiments reveal that while these MLLMs show promise in\nassessing MMU (i.e., achieving an average of 66.55% in Pair Comparison setting\nand 42.79% in Score Evaluation setting), they encounter significant challenges\nwith MMG tasks (i.e., averaging only 53.37% in Pair Comparison setting and\n30.05% in Score Evaluation setting), exposing cross-modality biases and\nhallucination issues. To address this, we present OmniArena, an automated\nplatform for evaluating omni-models and multimodal reward models.

However, the actual value from using a generative\nmodel stems not just from what it can produce but whether a user with a\nspecific goal can produce an output that satisfies that goal. We refer to this\nproperty as steerability. In this paper, we first introduce a mathematical\nframework for evaluating steerability independently from producibility.\nSteerability is more challenging to evaluate than producibility because it\nrequires knowing a user's goals. We address this issue by creating a benchmark\ntask that relies on one key idea: sample an output from a generative model and\nask users to reproduce it. We implement this benchmark in a large-scale user\nstudy of text-to-image models and large language models. Despite the ability of\nthese models to produce high-quality outputs, they all perform poorly on\nsteerabilty. This suggests that we need to focus on improving the steerability\nof generative models.

Concerns are rising about how such interactions might\nimpact users' loneliness and socialization with real people. We conducted a\nfour-week randomized, controlled, IRB-approved experiment (n=981, >300K\nmessages) to investigate how AI chatbot interaction modes (text, neutral voice,\nand engaging voice) and conversation types (open-ended, non-personal, and\npersonal) influence psychosocial outcomes such as loneliness, social\ninteraction with real people, emotional dependence on AI and problematic AI\nusage. Results showed that while voice-based chatbots initially appeared\nbeneficial in mitigating loneliness and dependence compared with text-based\nchatbots, these advantages diminished at high usage levels, especially with a\nneutral-voice chatbot. Conversation type also shaped outcomes: personal topics\nslightly increased loneliness but tended to lower emotional dependence compared\nwith open-ended conversations, whereas non-personal topics were associated with\ngreater dependence among heavy users. Overall, higher daily usage - across all\nmodalities and conversation types - correlated with higher loneliness,\ndependence, and problematic use, and lower socialization. Exploratory analyses\nrevealed that those with stronger emotional attachment tendencies and higher\ntrust in the AI chatbot tended to experience greater loneliness and emotional\ndependence, respectively. These findings underscore the complex interplay\nbetween chatbot design choices (e.g., voice expressiveness) and user behaviors\n(e.g., conversation content, usage frequency).

However, due to the huge\ndata volume and unstructured geometry, efficient compression of point clouds is\nvery crucial. The Moving Picture Expert Group is establishing a geometry-based\npoint cloud compression (G-PCC) standard for both static and dynamic point\nclouds in recent years. Although lossy compression of G-PCC can achieve a very\nhigh compression ratio, the reconstruction quality is relatively low,\nespecially at low bitrates. To mitigate this problem, we propose a high\nefficiency Wiener filter that can be integrated into the encoder and decoder\npipeline of G-PCC to improve the reconstruction quality as well as the\nrate-distortion performance for dynamic point clouds. Specifically, we first\npropose a basic Wiener filter, and then improve it by introducing coefficients\ninheritance and variance-based point classification for the Luma component.\nBesides, to reduce the complexity of the nearest neighbor search during the\napplication of the Wiener filter, we also propose a Morton code-based fast\nnearest neighbor search algorithm for efficient calculation of filter\ncoefficients. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can\nachieve average Bj{\\o}ntegaard delta rates of -6.1%, -7.3%, and -8.0% for Luma,\nChroma Cb, and Chroma Cr components, respectively, under the condition of\nlossless-geometry-lossy-attributes configuration compared to the latest G-PCC\nencoding platform (i.e., geometry-based solid content test model version 7.0\nrelease candidate 2) by consuming affordable computational complexity.",

    "abstract": "Transport of microscopic objects across biological membranes usually involves\nmembrane deformation to enclose the object followed by detachment of the\nengulfed particle. However, in artificial membranes, this last topological\nremodelling step is in many cases not spontaneous due to the elastic stability\nof the neck structure formed upon complete particle wrapping. In this work, we\nuse optical trapping to induce the wrapping of a non-adhesive microsphere by\nthe membrane of a giant lipid vesicle and investigate the energetics and\ndynamics of the resulting neck structure. We find that neck formation occurs as\na result of membrane shape energy minimization under the application of\nexternal force. Remarkably, increasing membrane tension could reopen the neck\nand reverse the wrapping process. This process shows a clear hysteresis and a\ndegree of reversibility. Neck cleavage and particle detachment into the\nvesicle's interior could not be triggered in the range of our optical forces.\nSystematic studies on the thermal dynamics of wrapped particles allowed to\nestablish that diffusion properties of the system are in agreement with a\ncoupling of the particle motion with the neck structure, modeled as a solid\ninclusion within the membrane. Interestingly, the wrapped particle dynamics\nexhibited a tension dependency, which can be described as the sum of several\ndrag contributions.",

    ],
    "abstract": "Reduced-order models (ROMs) remain generally unreliable for\nconvection-dominated problems, such as those encountered in hypersonic flows,\ndue to the slowly decaying Kolmogorov $n$-width of linear subspace\napproximations, known as the Kolmogorov barrier. This limitation hinders the\naccuracy of traditional ROMs and necessitates impractical amounts of training\ndata during the offline phase. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel\nlandmark-based registration procedure tailored for ROMs of convection-dominated\nproblems. Our approach leverages limited training data and incorporates a\nnonlinear transformation of the data using a landmark-based registration\ntechnique combined with radial basis function (RBF) interpolation. During the\noffline phase, we align dominant convective features in a reference domain,\nresulting in a rapid decay of error relative to the reduced space dimension.\nLandmarks are generated through a three-step process: (1) detecting shocks via\nedge detection techniques, (2) sampling using Monte Carlo methods, and (3)\ndomain partitioning with $k$-means clustering, where cluster centroids serve as\nlandmarks. Accurate landmark correspondence is achieved by minimizing pairing\ndistances for similar features. The online phase integrates standard\nminimum-residual ROM methodologies, extending the optimization space to include\nadmissible domain mappings. We validate our approach on two test cases: a\nspace-time Burgers' equation parameterized by the initial condition, and a\nhypersonic viscous flow over a cylinder parameterized by the Mach number.\nResults demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method in overcoming the\nKolmogorov barrier and enhancing the reliability of ROMs for\nconvection-dominated problems.",

The hadronically decaying $W/Z$ boson is reconstructed as either\ntwo small-radius jets or one large-radius jet with jet substructure\nrequirements. The data analyzed correspond to an integrated luminosity of 140\nfb$^{-1}$ of proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of\n$\\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV collected with the ATLAS detector during the 2015-2018 data\ntaking at the Large Hadron Collider. The electroweak production of $WW/WZ/ZZ$\nin association with two jets is observed in a phase space dominated by\nvector-boson scattering with a significance of $7.4\\sigma$ (expected\n$6.1\\sigma$) and the signal strength is determined to be\n$1.28^{+0.23}_{-0.21}$. The corresponding production cross section in a\nfiducial phase space is measured in addition. The signal strengths of both\nelectroweak and QCD associated diboson productions are furthermore measured in\na two-dimensional fit, the result of which agrees with the Standard Model\nprediction. The data are interpreted in the context of a dimension-8 effective\nfield theory to probe anomalous quartic gauge couplings resulting in the first\nset of exclusion limits on the Wilson coefficients in the semileptonic channel\nreported by the ATLAS Collaboration.

    "abstract": "Cerebral blood flow (CBF) is a crucial indicator of brain function, and its\ncontinuous monitoring is critical for diagnosing and treating neurological\ndisorders such as stroke, traumatic brain injury, and neurodegenerative\ndiseases. Diffuse correlation spectroscopy (DCS) is a non-invasive diffuse\noptical technique to investigate deep tissue microvascular dynamics. However,\ntraditional DCS systems face challenges in real-time applications due to\nreliance on correlation boards or software autocorrelators for signal\nacquisition, which limits their practical use. Furthermore, most existing DCS\nmeasurements are confined to a source-detector separation, \\rho = 20 - 30 mm,\nwith a maximum \\rho = 40 mm, potentially reducing cerebral hemodynamics\nassessment accuracy. To overcome these limitations, we utilized a fully\nin-house-built 512 x 512 single-photon avalanche diode array (SPAD) called\nATLAS, featuring innovative on-chip autocorrelators. The ATLAS-DCS system was\nevaluated against a commercial correlator board DCS system for liquid phantoms\nand cuff occlusion studies. Also, we successfully monitored pulsatile blood\nflow at \\rho of 50 mm with a high sampling rate of up to 56.3 Hz in a human\nforehead in vivo. Our system also demonstrated high fidelity in detecting human\npulse and identifying behaviour-induced physiological variations from the\nsubject's prefrontal cortex during video gaming. We show that the ATLAS-DCS\nsystem outperforms the commonly used APD-based DCS system, achieving more than\n571x SNR improvement in a milk-phantom at \\rho of 20 mm. This DCS on-chip\ndesign paves the way for high-speed biological signal measurement in real-time\napplications by significantly enhancing detection sensitivity and speed.",

    "abstract": "Conspicuous consumption occurs when a consumer derives value from a good\nbased on its social meaning as a signal of wealth, taste, and/or community\naffiliation. Common conspicuous goods include designer footwear, country club\nmemberships, and artwork; conspicuous goods also exist in the digital sphere,\nwith non-fungible tokens (NFTs) as a prominent example. The NFT market merits\ndeeper study for two key reasons: first, it is poorly understood relative to\nits economic scale; and second, it is unusually amenable to analysis because\nNFT transactions are publicly available on the blockchain, making them useful\nas a test bed for conspicuous consumption dynamics. This paper introduces a\nmodel that incorporates two previously identified elements of conspicuous\nconsumption: the \\emph{bandwagon effect} (goods increase in value as they\nbecome more popular) and the \\emph{snob effect} (goods increase in value as\nthey become rarer). Our model resolves the apparent tension between these two\neffects, exhibiting net complementarity between others' and one's own\nconspicuous consumption. We also introduce a novel dataset combining NFT\ntransactions with embeddings of the corresponding NFT images computed using an\noff-the-shelf vision transformer architecture. We use our dataset to validate\nthe model, showing that the bandwagon effect raises an NFT collection's value\nas more consumers join, while the snob effect drives consumers to seek rarer\nNFTs within a given collection.",

In this work we explore the capability of the Euclid Wide Survey to\ndetect ICL using H-band mock images. We simulate clusters across a range of\nredshifts (0.3-1.8) and halo masses ($10^{13.9}$-$10^{15.0}$ M$_\\odot$), using\nan observationally motivated model of the ICL. We identify a 50-200 kpc\ncircular annulus around the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) in which the\nsignal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of the ICL is maximised and use the S/N within this\naperture as our figure of merit for ICL detection. We compare three\nstate-of-the-art methods for ICL detection, and find that a method that\nperforms simple aperture photometry after high-surface brightness source\nmasking is able to detect ICL with minimal bias for clusters more massive than\n$10^{14.2}$ M$_\\odot$. The S/N of the ICL detection is primarily limited by the\nredshift of the cluster, driven by cosmological dimming, rather than the mass\nof the cluster. Assuming the ICL in each cluster contains 15% of the stellar\nlight, we forecast that Euclid will be able to measure the presence of ICL in\nup to $\\sim80000$ clusters of $>10^{14.2}$ M$_\\odot$ between $z=0.3$ and 1.5\nwith a S/N$>3$. Half of these clusters will reside below $z=0.75$ and the\nmajority of those below $z=0.6$ will be detected with a S/N $>20$. A few\nthousand clusters at $1.3<z<1.5$ will have ICL detectable with a S/N greater\nthan 3. The surface brightness profile of the ICL model is strongly dependent\non both the mass of the cluster and the redshift at which it is observed so the\nouter ICL is best observed in the most massive clusters of $>10^{14.7}$\nM$_\\odot$. Euclid will detect the ICL at more than 500 kpc distance from the\nBCG, up to $z=0.7$, in several hundred of these massive clusters over its large\nsurvey volume.",

In real-world applications,\nsuch as multi-robot teams, crowdsourced systems, and large-scale sensor\nnetworks, each agent may experience slightly different transition dynamics,\nleading to inherent model mismatches. In this paper, we first establish linear\nconvergence guarantees for single-agent temporal difference learning (TD(0)) in\npolicy evaluation and demonstrate that under a perturbed environment, the agent\nsuffers a systematic bias that prevents accurate estimation of the true value\nfunction. This result holds under both i.i.d. and Markovian sampling regimes.\nWe then extend our analysis to the federated TD(0) (FedTD(0)) setting, where\nmultiple agents, each interacting with its own perturbed environment,\nperiodically share value estimates to collaboratively approximate the true\nvalue function of a common underlying model. Our theoretical results indicate\nthe impact of model mismatch, network connectivity, and mixing behavior on the\nconvergence of FedTD(0).

Despite this, in-the-wild evaluation of these methods is still\nlacking, as works frequently rely on synthetic data evaluation and sparse\nreal-world examples under critical theoretical assumptions. Real-world causal\nstructures, however, are often complex, making it hard to decide on a proper\ncausal discovery strategy. To bridge this gap, we introduce CausalRivers, the\nlargest in-the-wild causal discovery benchmarking kit for time-series data to\ndate. CausalRivers features an extensive dataset on river discharge that covers\nthe eastern German territory (666 measurement stations) and the state of\nBavaria (494 measurement stations). It spans the years 2019 to 2023 with a\n15-minute temporal resolution. Further, we provide additional data from a flood\naround the Elbe River, as an event with a pronounced distributional shift.\nLeveraging multiple sources of information and time-series meta-data, we\nconstructed two distinct causal ground truth graphs (Bavaria and eastern\nGermany). These graphs can be sampled to generate thousands of subgraphs to\nbenchmark causal discovery across diverse and challenging settings. To\ndemonstrate the utility of CausalRivers, we evaluate several causal discovery\napproaches through a set of experiments to identify areas for improvement.\nCausalRivers has the potential to facilitate robust evaluations and comparisons\nof causal discovery methods. Besides this primary purpose, we also expect that\nthis dataset will be relevant for connected areas of research, such as\ntime-series forecasting and anomaly detection. Based on this, we hope to push\nbenchmark-driven method development that fosters advanced techniques for causal\ndiscovery, as is the case for many other areas of machine learning.",

A stronger version of the QNEC (the\nprimary QNEC) is expected to hold in 1+1 dimensional conformal field theories\n(CFT). QNEC has been shown to impose non-trivial quantum thermodynamic\nrestrictions on irreversible entropy production in quenches in 1+1 dimensional\nholographic CFTs. It is therefore natural to study if QNEC imposes similar\nbounds in other quench setups. In this paper we study QNEC in the\nCalabrese-Cardy global and local joining quenches using standard CFT\ntechniques. In the global quench we show that the primary QNEC must hold at\nsufficiently early times and find that it imposes bounds on the four point\ncorrelators of twist fields in a boundary state. This is a constraint on the\nset of boundary states that satisfy the primary QNEC. Furthermore, we find that\na violation of the primary QNEC implies a violation of the averaged null energy\ncondition (ANEC) in a conformally transformed frame.

Instead of subtracting a constant value\nfrom the background, we subtract a Poisson distribution that transforms the\nbackground into a pseudo-Gaussian distribution centered at zero.

We further find that an elementary static\nGromeka-Arnold-Beltrami-Childress flow, corresponding to a CSW at a specific\nmomentum, solves the full nonlinear equations of second-order chiral\nhydrodynamics, whereas global rotation of a chiral medium is not a solution.\nThis observation supports the relevance of CVI beyond the hydrodynamic regime.\nFinally, we briefly note that CVI may have multiple phenomenological\nimplications across various systems, including QCD matter produced in heavy-ion\ncollisions and primordial plasma in the early Universe.",

While text-based reasoning models (e.g., Deepseek R1) show promising\nresults in text-only tasks, distilling their reasoning into LVLMs via\nsupervised fine-tuning (SFT) often results in performance degradation due to\nimprecise visual grounding. Conversely, purely reinforcement learning\n(RL)-based methods face a large search space, hindering the emergence of\nreflective behaviors in smaller models (e.g., 7B LVLMs). Surprisingly,\nalternating between SFT and RL ultimately results in significant performance\nimprovements after a few iterations. Our analysis reveals that the base model\nrarely exhibits reasoning behaviors initially, but SFT effectively surfaces\nthese latent actions and narrows the RL search space, accelerating the\ndevelopment of reasoning capabilities. Each subsequent RL stage further refines\nthe model's reasoning skills, producing higher-quality SFT data for continued\nself-improvement. OpenVLThinker-7B consistently advances performance across six\nbenchmarks demanding mathematical and general reasoning, notably improving\nMathVista by 3.8%, EMMA by 2.4%, and HallusionBench by 1.6%.

In contrast,\nstate-of-the-art video Diffusion Transformers (DiT) models use 3D full\nattention, which does not explicitly separate temporal and spatial information.\nThus, the interaction between spatial and temporal dimensions makes decoupling\nmotion and appearance more challenging for DiT models. In this paper, we\npropose DeT, a method that adapts DiT models to improve motion transfer\nability. Our approach introduces a simple yet effective temporal kernel to\nsmooth DiT features along the temporal dimension, facilitating the decoupling\nof foreground motion from background appearance. Meanwhile, the temporal kernel\neffectively captures temporal variations in DiT features, which are closely\nrelated to motion. Moreover, we introduce explicit supervision along dense\ntrajectories in the latent feature space to further enhance motion consistency.\nAdditionally, we present MTBench, a general and challenging benchmark for\nmotion transfer. We also introduce a hybrid motion fidelity metric that\nconsiders both the global and local motion similarity. Therefore, our work\nprovides a more comprehensive evaluation than previous works.

Using\nthis approach, we present a new study of archival spectra of Beta Pic obtained\nwith the HST, the HARPS spectrograph, and at the Mont John University\nObservatory, aimed at constraining the abundance of refractory ions in Beta Pic\nexocomets. 29 individual objects are studied, all observed in FeII lines (used\nas a reference ion) and at least one other species (Ni II, Ca II, Cr II...). We\nfind that the refractory composition of exocomets is overall stable, especially\nfor singly ionised species, and consistent with solar abundances. This\nvalidates the use of the curve of growth approach to study exocometary\ncomposition. We also show that some ions, such as Ca II, are significantly\ndepleted compared to solar abundances, allowing us to constrain the ionisation\nstate in Beta Pic exocomets. We find that most refractory elements (Mg, Ni,\nFe...) are split in similar fractions between their first and second ionisation\nstates, with the exception of Ca, mostly ionized twice. A strong correlation\nbetween the Al III/Fe II ratio and radial velocity is also found, showing that\nthe most redshifted exocomets tend to be more ionised.

While traditional CPUs provide programming\nflexibility, their general-purpose architecture often lacks the throughput\nrequired for complex ML models. The augmentation of a RISC-V processor with a\nvector unit can provide substantial data-level parallelism. However, increasing\nthe data-level parallelism supported by vector processing would make the Vector\nRegister File (VRF) a major area consumer in ultra low-cost processors, since\n32 vector registers are required for RISC-V Vector ISA compliance. This work\nleverages the insight that many ML vectorized kernels require a small number of\nactive vector registers, and proposes the use of a physically smaller VRF that\ndynamically caches only the vector registers currently accessed by the\napplication. This approach, called Register Dispersion, maps the architectural\nvector registers to a smaller set of physical registers. The proposed\nISA-compliant VRF is significantly smaller than a full-size VRF and operates\nlike a conventional cache, i.e., it only stores the most recently accessed\nvector registers. Essential registers remain readily accessible within the\ncompact VRF, while the others are offloaded to the cache/memory sub-system. The\ncompact VRF design is demonstrated to yield substantial area and power savings,\nas compared to using a full VRF, with no or minimal impact on performance.

    "abstract": "Recent optical surveys have found a rare population of low-$z$ ($z \\sim 0.01\n- 0.06$) extreme star-forming galaxies (xSFGs) that are the most metal-poor\ngalaxies with strong emission lines, extremely high specific star-formation\nrate and low stellar mass. Using the Hubble Space Telescope Cosmic Origins\nSpectrograph, it was found that xSFGs are strong Ly$\\alpha$ emitters. Their\nLy$\\alpha$ properties indirectly suggest that they are also strong Ly continuum\n(LyC) leakers. This along with several other global properties makes them\nsimilar to the recently found $z > 6$ reionization-era star-forming (SF)\ngalaxies using the James Webb Space Telescope. Here we aim to study the radio\nspectral energy distribution (radio-SED) of $8$ xSFGs to understand mechanisms\nbehind the extreme nature of SF in these galaxies, particularly their high\nionisation state and possible strong LyC leakage. We present new radio\ncontinuum (RC) observations using the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope\n(uGMRT) at Band-$5$ ($1060 - 1460$ MHz) together with the Karl G. Jansky Very\nLarge Array (VLA) at S- ($2-4$ GHz), C- ($4-8$ GHz), X- ($8-12$ GHz) and Ku-\n($12-18$ GHz) bands and archival LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR) survey data\nbetween $120-168$ MHz for a few sources. The radio-SED of xSFGs is flat between\n$6-15$ GHz and shows a strong evidence for a turnover at lower frequencies in\nthe range of $2-10$ GHz. They can be well described using a thermally dominated\nradio spectra with a free-free absorption component with a high emission\nmeasure. Thus the SF complexes in these galaxies are extremely young (pre-SNe\nstage; below $\\sim 5$ Myrs) and the ISM is very dense suggesting a dominance of\nyoung massive star clusters. This can explain several extreme star-forming\nproperties, along with the potential leakage of a significant amount of LyC\nphotons in metal-poor extreme starburst galaxies. (abridged)",

    "abstract": "We discuss new recurrence-based methods for calculating the complex\nfrequencies of the quasinormal modes of black holes. These methods are based on\nthe Frobenius series solutions of the differential equation describing the\nlinearized radial perturbations. Within the general method, we propose two\napproaches: the first involves calculating the series coefficients, while the\nsecond employs generalized continued fractions. Moreover, as a consequence of\nthis analysis, we present a computationally efficient and convenient method\nthat uses double convergence acceleration, consisting of the application of the\nWynn algorithm to the approximants obtained from the Hill determinants, with\nthe Leaver-Nollert-Zhidenko-like tail approximations taken into account. The\nlatter is particularly important for stabilizing and enabling the calculations\nof modes with small real parts as well as higher overtones. The method\ndemonstrates exceptionally high accuracy. We emphasize that Gaussian\nelimination is unnecessary in all of these calculations. We consider\n$D$-dimensional ($3<D<10$) Schwarzschild-Tangherlini black holes as concrete\nexamples. Specifically, we calculate the quasinormal modes of the\n$(2+1)$-dimensional acoustic black hole (which is closely related to the\nfive-dimensional Schwarzschild-Tangherlini black holes), the\nelectromagnetic-vector modes of the six-dimensional black holes and the scalar\n(gravitational tensor) modes in the seven-dimensional case.

    "abstract": "Quantum computing platforms are susceptible to quantum-specific bugs (e.g.,\nincorrect ordering of qubits or incorrect implementation of quantum\nabstractions), which are difficult to detect and require specialized expertise.\nThe field faces challenges due to a fragmented landscape of platforms and rapid\ndevelopment cycles that often prioritize features over the development of\nrobust platform testing frameworks, severely hindering the reliability of\nquantum software. To address these challenges, we present QITE, the first\ncross-platform testing framework for quantum computing platforms, which\nleverages QASM, an assembly-level representation, to ensure consistency across\ndifferent platforms. QITE introduces the novel ITE process to generate\nequivalent quantum programs by iteratively (I)mporting assembly into platform\nrepresentations, (T)ransforming via platform optimization and gate conversion,\nand (E)xporting back to assembly. It uses a crash oracle to detect failures\nduring cross-platform transformations and an equivalence oracle to validate the\nsemantic consistency of the final sets of assembly programs, which are expected\nto be equivalent by construction. We evaluate QITE on four widely-used quantum\ncomputing platforms: Qiskit, PennyLane, Pytket, and BQSKit, revealing 17 bugs,\n14 of which are already confirmed or even fixed. Our results demonstrate QITE's\neffectiveness, its complementarity to existing quantum fuzzers in terms of code\ncoverage, and its ability to expose bugs that have been out of reach for\nexisting testing techniques.",

In elastic\nmedia, realizing these topological effects requires identifying lattices that\nsupport the corresponding topological bands. However, among the vast number of\ntheoretically predicted topological states, only a small fraction has been\nphysically realized. To close this gap, we present a new strategy capable of\nsystematically and efficiently discovering metamaterials with any desired\ntopological state. Our approach builds on topological quantum chemistry (TQC),\nwhich systematically classifies topological states by analyzing symmetry\nproperties at selected wavevectors. Because this method condenses the\ntopological character into mathematical information at a small set of\nwavevectors, it encodes a clear and computationally efficient objective for\ntopology optimization algorithms. We demonstrate that, for certain lattice\nsymmetries, this classification can be further reduced to intuitive\nmorphological features of the phonon band structure. By incorporating these\nband morphology constraints into topology optimization algorithms and further\nfabricating obtained designs, we enable the automated discovery and physical\nrealization of metamaterials with targeted topological properties. This\nmethodology establishes a new paradigm for engineering topological elastic\nlattices on demand, addressing the bottleneck in material realization and\npaving the way for a comprehensive database of topological metamaterial\nconfigurations.",

In the context of hyperbolic and relatively hyperbolic groups,\none of the key invariants in this classification is the boundary at infinity.\nF. Paulin proved that two hyperbolic groups are quasi-isometric if and only if\ntheir Gromov boundaries are quasiconformally equivalent. In this article, we\nextend Paulin's result to relatively hyperbolic groups and their Bowditch\nboundaries.\n  A notion of quasiconformal map preserving the shadows of horoballs relative\nto a point at the Bowditch boundary is defined and we have shown that every\ncoarsely cusp-preserving quasi-isometry between two relatively hyperbolic\ngroups induces a shadow-preserving quasiconformal map between their Bowditch\nboundaries. Conversely, we have shown that if the Bowditch boundaries of two\nrelatively hyperbolic groups are quasiconformally equivalent and the\nquasiconformal map coarsely preserves the shadows of horoballs relative to each\nboundary point, then the quasiconformal map induces a coarsely cusp-preserving\nquasi-isometry between those groups.",

    "abstract": "Bimanual robotic manipulation provides significant versatility, but also\npresents an inherent challenge due to the complexity involved in the spatial\nand temporal coordination between two hands. Existing works predominantly focus\non attaining human-level manipulation skills for robotic hands, yet little\nattention has been paid to task planning on long-horizon timescales. With their\noutstanding in-context learning and zero-shot generation abilities, Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) have been applied and grounded in diverse robotic\nembodiments to facilitate task planning. However, LLMs still suffer from errors\nin long-horizon reasoning and from hallucinations in complex robotic tasks,\nlacking a guarantee of logical correctness when generating the plan. Previous\nworks, such as LLM+P, extended LLMs with symbolic planners. However, none have\nbeen successfully applied to bimanual robots. New challenges inevitably arise\nin bimanual manipulation, necessitating not only effective task decomposition\nbut also efficient task allocation. To address these challenges, this paper\nintroduces LLM+MAP, a bimanual planning framework that integrates LLM reasoning\nand multi-agent planning, automating effective and efficient bimanual task\nplanning. We conduct simulated experiments on various long-horizon manipulation\ntasks of differing complexity. Our method is built using GPT-4o as the backend,\nand we compare its performance against plans generated directly by LLMs,\nincluding GPT-4o, V3 and also recent strong reasoning models o1 and R1. By\nanalyzing metrics such as planning time, success rate, group debits, and\nplanning-step reduction rate, we demonstrate the superior performance of\nLLM+MAP, while also providing insights into robotic reasoning.

Color-magnitude\ndiagram (CMD)-fitting offers a robust alternative to individual age\ndeterminations via the derivation of dynamically evolved star formation\nhistories (deSFH) and age-metallicity distributions (Gallart et al. 2024). Our\nnew suite of routines, CMDft.Gaia, specifically developed to analyse Gaia CMDs,\nproduce deSFHs which are robust against sensible changes in the input\nparameters and extremely precise, providing an unprecedentedly detailed\ncharacterization of the successive events of star formation that, since its\nearly evolution, have shaped the current Milky Way. Also important is the fact\nthat, thanks to the high completeness of the Gaia photometric data, CMDft.Gaia\nprovides the actual number of stars and the mass involved in the different\nevents of star formation.\n  The current analysis of the deSFH for stellar populations within 100 pc of\nthe Sun, as well as for kinematically selected stars in the thin disk, thick\ndisk, and halo, allows us to sketch a tentative picture of Milky Way evolution.\nThe findings indicate that star formation commenced very early in a thick disk,\nwith a small fraction of stars having [M/H]<-0.5 forming more than 12 Gyr ago.\nThis phase culminated in a more prominent 12 Gyr old population with\n[M/H]~-0.5. Approximately 11 Gyr ago, the merger with GSE triggered an intense\nburst of star formation, generating most of the thick disk mass and enriching\nits metallicity to solar levels. Subsequently, the bulk of the star formation\nin the thin disk started and continues with a somewhat episodic behaviour up to\nthe present time.",

The knowledge of all necessary and\nsufficient conditions for a p-body matrix to be N-representable allows the\nconstrained minimization of a many-body Hamiltonian expectation value with\nrespect to the p-body density matrix and, thus, the determination of its exact\nground state. However, the number of constraints that complete the\nN-representability conditions grows exponentially with system size, and hence\nthe procedure quickly becomes intractable in practice. This work introduces a\nhybrid quantum-stochastic algorithm to effectively replace the\nN-representability conditions. The algorithm consists of applying to an initial\nN-body density matrix a sequence of unitary evolution operators constructed\nfrom a stochastic process that successively approaches the reduced state of the\ndensity matrix on a p-body subsystem, represented by a p-RDM, to a target\np-body matrix, potentially a p-RDM. The generators of the evolution operators\nfollow the adaptive derivative-assembled pseudo-Trotter method (ADAPT), while\nthe stochastic component is implemented using a simulated annealing process.\nThe resulting algorithm is independent of any underlying Hamiltonian, and it\ncan be used to decide if a given p-body matrix is N-representable, establishing\na criterion to determine its quality and correcting it. We apply this hybrid\nADAPT algorithm to alleged reduced density matrices from a quantum chemistry\nelectronic Hamiltonian, the reduced BCS model with constant pairing, and the\nHeisenberg XXZ spin model. In all cases, the proposed method behaves as\nexpected for 1-RDMs and 2-RDMs, evolving the initial matrices towards different\ntargets.",

In this paper, we examine this question for a broad and physically\nrelevant class of bipartite systems, specifically those possessing an additive\nobservable with a definite value. Such systems include, for example, final\nstates of particle decays or bipartitions of spin chains with well-defined\nmagnetization. We derive very simple, handy criteria for detecting entanglement\nor non-locality in many cases. For instance, if $\\rho_{\\left( m p\\right)\\left(\nnq\\right)} \\neq 0$, where the eigenstates $|np\\rangle$ or $|mq\\rangle$ do not\ncorrespond to the given definite value of the additive observable, then the\nstate is necessarily entangled-this condition is very easy to check in\npractice. If, in addition, the partitioned Hilbert space has dimension 2xd, the\ncondition becomes necessary. Furthermore, if the sectors associated with the\neigenstates $|mp\\rangle$ or $|nq\\rangle$ are non-degenerate, there exists a\nCHSH inequality that is violated. We illustrate these results by analyzing the\npotential detection of entanglement and nonlocality in Higgs to ZZ decays at\nthe LHC.",

    "abstract": "We present a novel cross-band modulation framework that combines 3D\nmodulation in the RF domain with intensity modulation and direct detection in\nthe optical domain, the first such integration to enhance communication\nreliability. By harnessing cross-band diversity, the framework optimizes symbol\nmapping across RF and optical links, significantly boosting mutual information\n(MI) and reducing symbol error probability (SEP). Two practical modulation\nschemes implement this framework, both using quadrature amplitude modulation in\nthe RF subsystem. The first is a linear cross-band mapping scheme, where RF\nsymbols are mapped to optical intensity values via an analytically tractable\noptimization that ensures O(1) detection complexity while minimizing SEP. The\nsecond employs a deep neural network-generated (DNN-Gen) 3D constellation with\na custom loss function that adaptively optimizes symbol placement to maximize\nMI and minimize SEP. Although DNN-Gen incurs higher computational complexity\nthan the linear approach, it adapts the 3D constellation to varying\nsignal-to-noise ratios, yielding significant performance gains. Furthermore, we\nderive a theoretical MI benchmark for the linear scheme, offering insights into\nthe fundamental limits of RF-optical cross-band communication. Extensive Monte\nCarlo simulations confirm that both schemes outperform SoA cross-band\nmodulation techniques, including cross-band pulse amplitude modulation, with\nnotable improvements. Additionally, DNN-Gen maintains high performance over a\nrange of RF SNRs, lessening the need for exhaustive training at every operating\ncondition. Overall, these results establish our cross-band modulation framework\nas a scalable, high-performance solution for next-generation hybrid RF-optical\nnetworks, balancing low complexity with optimized symbol mapping to maximize\nsystem reliability and efficiency.",

    "abstract": "The presence of quantum effects in photosynthetic excitation energy transfer\nhas been intensely debated over the past decade. Nonlinear spectroscopy cannot\nunambiguously distinguish coherent electronic dynamics from underdamped\nvibrational motion, and rigorous numerical simulations of realistic microscopic\nmodels have been intractable. Experimental studies supported by approximate\nnumerical treatments that severely coarse-grain the vibrational environment\nhave claimed the absence of long-lived quantum effects. Here, we report the\nfirst non-perturbative, accurate microscopic model simulations of the\nFenna-Matthews-Olson photosynthetic complex and demonstrate the presence of\nlong-lived excitonic coherences at 77 K and room temperature, which persist on\npicosecond time scales, similar to those of excitation energy transfer.\nFurthermore, we show that full microscopic simulations of nonlinear optical\nspectra are essential for identifying experimental evidence of quantum effects\nin photosynthesis, as approximate theoretical methods can misinterpret\nexperimental data and potentially overlook quantum phenomena.",

To address\nthis problem, we propose Condition-Aware Sentence Embeddings (CASE), an\nefficient and accurate method to create an embedding for a sentence under a\ngiven condition. First, CASE creates an embedding for the condition using a\nLarge Language Model (LLM), where the sentence influences the attention scores\ncomputed for the tokens in the condition during pooling. Next, a supervised\nnonlinear projection is learned to reduce the dimensionality of the LLM-based\ntext embeddings. We show that CASE significantly outperforms previously\nproposed Conditional Semantic Textual Similarity (C-STS) methods on an existing\nstandard benchmark dataset. We find that subtracting the condition embedding\nconsistently improves the C-STS performance of LLM-based text embeddings.\nMoreover, we propose a supervised dimensionality reduction method that not only\nreduces the dimensionality of LLM-based embeddings but also significantly\nimproves their performance.",

    "abstract": "The thermal fluctuation spectrum of the electric field arising due to\nparticle noise in a quiescent Vlasov-Poisson plasma was derived in the 1960s.\nHere, we derive the universal fluctuation spectrum of the electric field, at\nDebye and sub-Debye scales, for a turbulent Vlasov-Poisson plasma. This\nspectrum arises from what is likely to be the final cascade - a universal\nregime to be encountered at the extreme small-scale end of any turbulent\ncascade in a nearly collisionless plasma. The cascaded invariant is $C_2$, the\nquadratic Casimir invariant of the particle distribution function. $C_2$\ncascades to small scales in position and velocity space via linear and\nnonlinear phase mixing, in such a way that the time scales of the two processes\nare critically balanced at every scale. We construct a scaling theory of the\nfluctuation spectrum of $C_2$ and of the electric field in wavenumber space.\nThe electric-field spectrum is sufficiently steep for the nonlinear mixing to\nbe controlled by the largest-scale electric fields, and so the $C_2$ cascade\nresembles the Batchelor cascade of a passive scalar. Our theory is supported by\nsimulations of a forced 1D-1V plasma. We predict that the cascade is terminated\nat the wavenumber where the turbulent electric-field spectrum gives way to the\nthermal noise spectrum. The time scale for this small-scale cutoff to be\nreached is the dynamical time of phase-space mixing times a logarithmic factor\nin the plasma parameter - this is the first concrete demonstration of this\nproperty of Vlasov-Poisson turbulence, akin to how fluid turbulence dissipates\nenergy at a rate independent (or nearly independent) of molecular diffusion. In\nthe presence of the sub-Debye phase-space cascade - a scenario that may be\nubiquitous - standard collisional plasma theory ceases to be valid. This calls\nfor the development of new collision operators suited to such turbulent\nenvironments.",

    "abstract": "Applied category theory often studies symmetric monoidal categories (SMCs)\nwhose morphisms represent open systems. These structures naturally accommodate\ncomplex wiring patterns, leveraging (co)monoidal structures for splitting and\nmerging wires, or compact closed structures for feedback. A key example is the\ncompact closed SMC of design problems (DP), which enables a compositional\napproach to co-design in engineering. However, in practice, the systems of\ninterest may not be fully known. Recently, Markov categories have emerged as a\npowerful framework for modeling uncertain processes. In this work, we\ndemonstrate how to integrate this perspective into the study of open systems\nwhile preserving consistency with the underlying SMC structure. To this end, we\nemploy the change-of-base construction for enriched categories, replacing the\nmorphisms of a symmetric monoidal $\\mathcal{V}$-category $\\mathcal{C}$ with\nparametric maps $A \\to \\mathcal{C}(X,Y)$ in a Markov category induced by a\nsymmetric monoidal monad. This results in a symmetric monoidal 2-category\n$N_*\\mathcal{C}$ with the same objects as $\\mathcal{C}$ and reparametrization\n2-cells. By choosing different monads, we capture various types of uncertainty.\nThe category underlying $\\mathcal{C}$ embeds into $N_*\\mathcal{C}$ via a strict\nsymmetric monoidal functor, allowing (co)monoidal and compact closed structures\nto be transferred.

    "abstract": "Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are widely used for interpreting language model\nactivations. A key evaluation metric is the increase in cross-entropy loss\nbetween the original model logits and the reconstructed model logits when\nreplacing model activations with SAE reconstructions. Typically, SAEs are\ntrained solely on mean squared error (MSE) when reconstructing precomputed,\nshuffled activations. Recent work introduced training SAEs directly with a\ncombination of KL divergence and MSE (\"end-to-end\" SAEs), significantly\nimproving reconstruction accuracy at the cost of substantially increased\ncomputation, which has limited their widespread adoption. We propose a brief\nKL+MSE fine-tuning step applied only to the final 25M training tokens (just a\nfew percent of typical training budgets) that achieves comparable improvements,\nreducing the cross-entropy loss gap by 20-50%, while incurring minimal\nadditional computational cost. We further find that multiple fine-tuning\nmethods (KL fine-tuning, LoRA adapters, linear adapters) yield similar,\nnon-additive cross-entropy improvements, suggesting a common, easily\ncorrectable error source in MSE-trained SAEs. We demonstrate a straightforward\nmethod for effectively transferring hyperparameters and sparsity penalties\nbetween training phases despite scale differences between KL and MSE losses.\nWhile both ReLU and TopK SAEs see significant cross-entropy loss improvements,\nevaluations on supervised SAEBench metrics yield mixed results, with\nimprovements on some metrics and decreases on others, depending on both the SAE\narchitecture and downstream task.

This is comparable to noise levels expected for the wide field\nsurvey of CMB-S4, a next-generation CMB experiment. Candidates are selected via\nthe thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect with a minimum significance of $\\xi\n= 4.0$, resulting in a catalog of purity $\\sim 89 \\%$. Optical data from the\nDark Energy Survey and infrared data from the Spitzer Space Telescope are used\nto confirm 442 cluster candidates.

We assess the effect\nof infrared emission from cluster member galaxies on cluster selection by\nperforming a joint fit to the infrared dust and tSZ signals by combining\nmeasurements from SPT and overlapping submillimeter data from Herschel/SPIRE.\nWe find that at high redshift ($z>1)$, the tSZ signal is reduced by\n$17.4^{+3.1}_{-2.9} \\%$ ($3.7^{+0.7}_{-0.7}\\%$) at 150 GHz (95 GHz) due to dust\ncontamination. We repeat our cluster finding method on dust-nulled SPT maps and\nfind the resulting catalog is consistent with the nominal SPT-Deep catalog,\ndemonstrating dust contamination does not significantly impact the SPT-Deep\nselection function; we attribute this lack of bias to the inclusion of the SPT\n220 GHz band.",

In the system most studied (hard sphere\ncolloids), the comparison between experiments performed using static light\nscattering and computer simulations is woeful, with a discrepancy of over 10\norders of magnitude. The situation with other well-studied materials (such as\nwater and sodium chloride) is no better. It has thus far proven impossible to\naccess the regime of this discrepancy with particle-resolved techniques which\nmight shed light on its origins, due to the relatively sluggish dynamics of the\nlarger colloids required for confocal microscopy.\n  Here we address this challenge with two developments. Our work is a marked\nimprovement in the precision of mapping the state point of experiments to\nsimulation. For this, we employed a combination of novel machine-learning\nmethods for particle tracking and higher-order correlation functions. Our\nsecond innovation is to consider the free energy of pre-critical nuclei which\ncan be detected in the discrepancy regime. These are in agreement with computer\nsimulation. This is the first time that such free energies have been\nsuccessfully compared between experiment and simulation in any material as far\nas we are aware. The agreement provides important validation of rare event\nsampling techniques which are used very widely in simulation, but which can\nseldom be directly compared with experiment.",

Specifically, we design a\nchannel-wise rectification module (CRM) that implements a channel state space\nblock across multi-modal features to learn correlated representations and helps\nfilter out modality-specific noise. A dynamic cross-modality interaction module\n(DCIM) is designed to effectively integrate position and context information,\nwhich employs PET images to learn regional position information and serves as a\nbridge to assist in modeling the relationships between local features of CT\nimages. Extensive experiments on a comprehensive benchmark demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our CIPA compared to the current state-of-the-art segmentation\nmethods. We hope our research can provide more exploration opportunities for\nmedical image segmentation. The dataset and code are available at\nhttps://github.com/mj129/CIPA.",

    "abstract": "This paper is concerned with a natural variant of the contact process\nmodeling the spread of knowledge on the integer lattice. Each site is\ncharacterized by its knowledge, measured by a real number ranging from 0 =\nignorant to 1 = omniscient. Neighbors interact at rate $\\lambda$, which results\nin both neighbors attempting to teach each other a fraction $\\mu$ of their\nknowledge, and individuals die at rate one, which results in a new individual\nwith no knowledge. Starting with a single omniscient site, our objective is to\nstudy whether the total amount of knowledge on the lattice converges to zero\n(extinction) or remains bounded away from zero (survival). The process dies out\nwhen $\\lambda \\leq \\lambda_c$ and/or $\\mu = 0$, where $\\lambda_c$ denotes the\ncritical value of the contact process. In contrast, we prove that, for all\n$\\lambda > \\lambda_c$, there is a unique phase transition in the direction of\n$\\mu$, and for all $\\mu > 0$, there is a unique phase transition in the\ndirection of $\\lambda$. Our proof of survival relies on block constructions\nshowing more generally convergence of the knowledge to infinity, while our\nproof of extinction relies on martingale techniques showing more generally an\nexponential decay of the knowledge.",

    "abstract": "Today, data guides the decision-making process of most companies. Effectively\nanalyzing and manipulating data at scale to extract and exploit relevant\nknowledge is a challenging task, due to data characteristics such as its size,\nthe rate at which it changes, and the heterogeneity of formats. To address this\nchallenge, software architects resort to build complex data-intensive\narchitectures that integrate highly heterogeneous software systems, each\noffering vertically specialized functionalities. Designing a suitable\narchitecture for the application at hand is crucial to enable high quality of\nservice and efficient exploitation of resources. However, the design process\nentails a series of decisions that demand technical expertise and in-depth\nknowledge of individual systems and their synergies. To assist software\narchitects in this task, this paper introduces a development methodology for\ndata-intensive architectures, which guides architects in (i) designing a\nsuitable architecture for their specific application scenario, and (ii)\nselecting an appropriate set of concrete systems to implement the application.\nTo do so, the methodology grounds on (1) a language to precisely define an\napplication scenario in terms of characteristics of data and requirements of\nstakeholders; (2) an architecture description language for data-intensive\narchitectures; (3) a classification of systems based on the functionalities\nthey offer and their performance trade-offs. We show that the description\nlanguages we adopt can capture the key aspects of data-intensive architectures\nproposed by researchers and practitioners, and we validate our methodology by\napplying it to real-world case studies documented in literature.",

In this setting, there are $n$ spots on a one-way\nstreet and $m$ cars attempting to park in those spots, and $1\\leq m\\leq n$. We\nlet $\\alpha=(a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_m)\\in[n]^m$ denote the parking preferences for\nthe cars, which enter the street sequentially. Car $i$ drives to their\npreference $a_i$ and parks there if the spot is available. Otherwise, car $i$\nchecks up to $k$ spots behind their preference, parking in the first available\nspot it encounters if any. If no spots are available, or the car reaches the\nstart of the street, then the car returns to its preference and attempts to\npark in the first spot it encounters among spots $a_i+1,a_i+2,\\ldots,a_i+\\ell$.\nIf car $i$ fails to park, then parking ceases. If all cars are able to park\ngiven the preferences in $\\alpha$, then $\\alpha$ is called a\n$(k,\\ell)$-pullback $(m,n)$-parking function. Our main result establishes\ncounts for these parking functions in two ways: counting them based on their\nfinal parking outcome (the order in which the cars park on the street), and via\na recursive formula.

Approximately 80% of all chemical products\nproduced by heterogeneous catalysis are produced by solid catalysts, which are\nessential for the synthesizing of ammonia, methanol, and hydrocarbons.

These effective properties are influenced\nby the nanoscale morphology of the catalysts, whereby the size of the\nnanoparticles is only one key descriptor. To investigate the relationship\nbetween nanoparticle morphology and catalytic performance, a comprehensive 3D\nanalysis of nano-scale catalyst particles is necessary. However, traditional\nimaging techniques for a representative recording of this size range, such as\ntransmission electron microscopy (TEM), are mostly limited to 2D. Thus, in the\npresent paper, a stochastic 3D model is developed for a data-driven analysis of\nthe nanostructure of catalyst particles. The calibration of this model is\nachieved using 2D TEM data from two different length scales, allowing for a\nstatistically representative 3D modeling of catalyst particles.

We find\nthat the radio emission from the polar cap can produce a diverse range of\nobserved pulsar properties, including single or double peaked profiles. Most of\nthe Stokes V curves from our simulations appear to be antisymmetric, but\nsymmetric curves are also present at some viewing angles. Although the PA swing\nof the radiation from the polar cap can be fitted by the rotating vector model\n(RVM) for most viewing angles, the angles obtained from the RVM do not\ncorrespond to the angular distance of the observer from the magnetic axis.\nInstead, the PA is directly related to the plasma flows in the polar cap and\nnot to the dipole geometry of the magnetic field. The observed range of other\npolarization features, in addition to our results, can be explained by\npropagation effects which are not part of the simulation.\n  Our simulations demonstrate that pair discharges determine the majority of\nits typically observed properties.

    "abstract": "We present the KL3M tokenizers, a family of specialized tokenizers for legal,\nfinancial, and governmental text. Despite established work on tokenization,\nspecialized tokenizers for professional domains remain understudied. Our paper\noffers two main contributions to this area.\n  First, we introduce domain-specific BPE tokenizers for legal, financial, and\ngovernmental text. Our kl3m-004-128k-cased tokenizer uses 9-17% fewer tokens\nthan GPT-4o and Llama3 for domain-specific documents, despite having a smaller\nvocabulary. For specialized terminology, our cased tokenizer is even more\nefficient, using up to 83% fewer tokens for legal terms and 39% fewer tokens\nfor financial terms.\n  Second, we develop character-level BPE tokenizers (4K, 8K, and 16K vocabulary\nsizes) for text correction tasks like OCR post-processing. These tokenizers\nkeep consistent token boundaries between error-containing and correct text,\nmaking it easier for models to learn correction patterns.\n  These tokenizers help professional applications by fitting more text in\ncontext windows, reducing computational needs, and preserving the meaning of\ndomain-specific terms. Our analysis shows these efficiency gains directly\nbenefit the processing of long legal and financial documents. We release all\ntokenizers and code through GitHub and Hugging Face to support further research\nin specialized tokenization.",

    "abstract": "Decentralization is understood both by professionals in the blockchain\nindustry and general users as a core design goal of permissionless ledgers.\nHowever, its meaning is far from universally agreed, and often it is easier to\nget opinions on what it is not, rather than what it is. In this paper, we\nsolicit definitions of 'decentralization' and 'decentralization theatre' from\nblockchain node operators. Key to a definition is asking about effective\ndecentralization strategies, as well as those that are ineffective, sometimes\ndeliberately so. Malicious, deceptive, or incompetent strategies are commonly\nreferred to by the term 'decentralization theatre.' Finally, we ask what is\nbeing decentralized. Via thematic analysis of interview transcripts, we find\nthat most operators conceive decentralization as existing broadly on a\ntechnical and a governance axis. Isolating relevant variables, we collapse the\ncategories to network topology and governance topology, or the structure of\ndecision-making power. Our key finding is that `decentralization' alone does\nnot affect ledger immutability or systemic robustness.",

While EM has many benefits compared to EC, specifically that it requires\nno (or little) qubit overhead, this benefit comes with a painful price: EM\nseems to necessitate an overhead in quantum run time which grows as a (mild)\nexponent. Accordingly, recent results show that EM alone cannot enable\nexponential quantum advantages (QAs), for an average variant of the expectation\nvalue estimation problem. These works raised concerns regarding the role of EM\nin the road map towards QAs.\n  We aim to demystify the discussion and provide a clear picture of the role of\nEM in achieving QAs, both in the near and long term. We first propose a clear\ndistinction between finite QA and asymptotic QA, which is crucial to the\nunderstanding of the question, and present the notion of circuit volume boost,\nwhich we claim is an adequate way to quantify the benefits of EM. Using these\nnotions, we can argue straightforwardly that EM is expected to have a\nsignificant role in achieving QAs. Specifically, that EM is likely to be the\nfirst error reduction method for useful finite QAs, before EC; that the first\nsuch QAs are expected to be achieved using EM in the very near future; and that\nEM is expected to maintain its important role in quantum computation even when\nEC will be routinely used - for as long as high-quality qubits remain a scarce\nresource.",

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) has garnered considerable interest for its capability\nto learn from decentralized data sources. Given the increasing application of\nFL in decision-making scenarios, addressing fairness issues across different\nsensitive groups (e.g., female, male) in FL is crucial. Current research often\nfocuses on facilitating fairness at each client's data (local fairness) or\nwithin the entire dataset across all clients (global fairness). However,\nexisting approaches that focus exclusively on either local or global fairness\nfail to address two key challenges: (\\textbf{CH1}) Under statistical\nheterogeneity, global fairness does not imply local fairness, and vice versa.\n(\\textbf{CH2}) Achieving fairness under model-agnostic setting. To tackle the\naforementioned challenges, this paper proposes a novel post-processing\nframework for achieving both Local and Global Fairness in the FL context,\nnamely LoGoFair. To address CH1, LoGoFair endeavors to seek the Bayes optimal\nclassifier under local and global fairness constraints, which strikes the\noptimal accuracy-fairness balance in the probabilistic sense. To address CH2,\nLoGoFair employs a model-agnostic federated post-processing procedure that\nenables clients to collaboratively optimize global fairness while ensuring\nlocal fairness, thereby achieving the optimal fair classifier within FL.\nExperimental results on three real-world datasets further illustrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed LoGoFair framework.",

This exponential\ncomplexity na\\\"ively renders a complete state characterization, for instance\nvia the complete set of bipartite Renyi entropies for all disjoint regions, a\nchallenging task. Recently, a compact way of storing subregions' purities by\nencoding them as amplitudes of a fictitious quantum wave function, known as\nentanglement feature, was proposed. Notably, the entanglement feature can be a\nsimple object even for highly entangled quantum states. However the complexity\nand practical usage of the entanglement feature for general quantum states has\nnot been explored. In this work, we demonstrate that the entanglement feature\ncan be efficiently learned using only a polynomial amount of samples in the\nnumber of degrees of freedom through the so-called tensor cross interpolation\n(TCI) algorithm, assuming it is expressible as a finite bond dimension MPS. We\nbenchmark this learning process on Haar and random MPS states, confirming\nanalytic expectations. Applying the TCI algorithm to quantum eigenstates of\nvarious one dimensional quantum systems, we identify cases where eigenstates\nhave entanglement feature learnable with TCI. We conclude with possible\napplications of the learned entanglement feature, such as quantifying the\ndistance between different entanglement patterns and finding the optimal\none-dimensional ordering of physical indices in a given state, highlighting the\npotential utility of the proposed purity interpolation method.",

The structure of supply of\ngoods in this model is determined by the structure of exports of each country.\nIt is proved that in such a model, given a certain structure of supply and\ndemand, there exists a so-called ideal equilibrium state in which the trade\nbalance of each country is zero.

Using cardiovascular event-specific clinical trial data, the\nframework achieved an F1-score of 0.82 for event extraction and an accuracy of\n0.68 for adjudication. Furthermore, we introduce the CLEART score, a novel,\nautomated metric specifically designed for evaluating the quality of\nAI-generated clinical reasoning in adjudicating cardiovascular events.

Aims: We explore the dynamical evolution of rings\naround spherical Chariklo and Haumea analogs, assuming different particle sizes\nand tilt angles with respect to the planetary orbital plane of the ring.\nMethods: The ring dynamics were studied using a GPU-based N-body integrator\nwith an 8th-order Hermite scheme for several thousand years, corresponding to\n10 solar orbits. The simulations took into account the gravitational effects of\nthe planet and the Sun, radiation pressure, and the shadow cast by the planet.\nResults: Two families of rings have been identified depending on the ring tilt\nangle. Slightly tilted rings (<=40 deg) are unstable under a critical particle\nsize. Highly tilted rings (>=50 deg), however, show instability only for a\nrange of particle sizes that spans 1-10 times the critical size. The planetary\nshadow reduces the critical size by a factor of five and extends the\ninstability region to 0.1-10 times this newly identified critical size.\nConclusions: The stabilization of highly inclined rings occurs because the\nplane of the ring is forced to be perpendicular to the Solar radiation. As a\nresult, the plane of the ring rotates as the planetary bodies revolves: always\nfacing the sun, like a celestial sunflower. Rings which are closely aligned to\nthe orbital plane of the host planet, such as Haumea and Quaoar, presumably\nconsist of particles with a size at least 1-4 um.

    "abstract": "Positive lags between the arrival time of different photon energies are\ncommonly observed in Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs), where soft photons lag behind\nharder ones. However, some GRBs exhibit the opposite behavior. In particular,\nFermi LAT observations have revealed that high-energy photons often have a\ndelayed onset. We explore spectral lags as a tool to identify emission\ncomponents, analyzing Fermi GBM and LAT Low Energy (LLE) data. Using the\nDiscrete Correlation Function method, we compute spectral lags in four energy\nbands (10 keV-100 MeV) for 70 GRBs from the LLE Catalog. Lags between 10 keV\nand 1 MeV are mostly positive (76%), possibly due to a hard-to-soft spectral\nevolution. However, lags between the LLE band (30-100 MeV) and GBM (10-100 keV)\nvary: 40% are positive, while 37% are negative. These negative lags suggest the\ndelayed emergence of an additional high-energy component. Spectral analysis of\n56 GRBs reveals that negative lags correspond to an LLE spectral index harder\nthan the GBM high-energy power law. LLE spectral lags can thus serve as a\ndiagnostic tool to identify and characterize emission components, emphasizing\nthe importance of combining temporal and spectral analyses to better understand\nGRB emission mechanisms.",

Ancillary service markets, such as the German control reserve\nmarket, allow industrial consumers and producers to offer flexibility in their\npower consumption or generation, contributing to grid stability while earning\nadditional income. However, many participants use simple bidding strategies\nthat may not maximize their revenues. This paper presents a methodology for\nforecasting bidding prices in pay-as-bid ancillary service markets, focusing on\nthe German control reserve market. We evaluate various machine learning models,\nincluding Support Vector Regression, Decision Trees, and k-Nearest Neighbors,\nand compare their performance against benchmark models. To address the\nasymmetry in the revenue function of pay-as-bid markets, we introduce an offset\nadjustment technique that enhances the practical applicability of the\nforecasting models. Our analysis demonstrates that the proposed approach\nimproves potential revenues by 27.43 % to 37.31 % compared to baseline models.\nWhen analyzing the relationship between the model forecasting errors and the\nrevenue, a negative correlation is measured for three markets; according to the\nresults, a reduction of 1 EUR/MW model price forecasting error (MAE)\nstatistically leads to a yearly revenue increase between 483 EUR/MW and 3,631\nEUR/MW.

Additionally, it employs a weighted loss function that adjusts\neach sample's contribution based on its similarity to the corresponding NLP\nanchor. This adjustment makes the model more robust to noisy labels.

We\nsystematically explore the interplay between magnetic and kinetic chaos in\ntoroidal fusion plasmas, where non-axisymmetric perturbations disrupt smooth\nmagnetic flux surfaces, generating complex particle trajectories. Using the\nGeneralized Alignment Index (GALI) method, we efficiently quantify chaos,\ncompare the behavior of magnetic field lines and particle orbits, visualize the\nradial distribution of chaotic regions, and offer GALI as a valuable tool for\nstudying plasma physics dynamics. We also study the evolution of phase space\nstructures in a 3D barred galactic potential, following successive 2D and 3D\npitchfork and period-doubling bifurcations of periodic orbits. By employing the\n`color and rotation' technique to visualize the system's 4D Poincar\\'e surface\nof sections, we reveal distinct structural patterns. We further investigate the\nlong-term diffusion transport and chaos properties of single and coupled\nstandard maps, focusing on parameters inducing anomalous diffusion through\naccelerator modes exhibiting ballistic transport. Using different ensembles of\ninitial conditions in chaotic regions influenced by these modes, we examine\nasymptotic diffusion rates and time scales, identifying conditions suppressing\nanomalous transport and leading to long-term convergence to normal diffusion\nacross coupled maps. Lastly, we perform the first comprehensive investigation\ninto the GALI indices for various attractors in continuous and discrete-time\ndissipative systems, extending the method's application to non-Hamiltonian\nsystems.

    "abstract": "The commodity and widespread use of online shopping are having an\nunprecedented impact on climate, with emission figures from key actors that are\neasily comparable to those of a large-scale metropolis. Despite online shopping\nbeing fueled by recommender systems (RecSys) algorithms, the role and potential\nof the latter in promoting more sustainable choices is little studied. One of\nthe main reasons for this could be attributed to the lack of a dataset\ncontaining carbon footprint emissions for the items. While building such a\ndataset is a rather challenging task, its presence is pivotal for opening the\ndoors to novel perspectives, evaluations, and methods for RecSys research. In\nthis paper, we target this bottleneck and study the environmental role of\nRecSys algorithms. First, we mine a dataset that includes carbon footprint\nemissions for its items. Then, we benchmark conventional RecSys algorithms in\nterms of accuracy and sustainability as two faces of the same coin. We find\nthat RecSys algorithms optimized for accuracy overlook greenness and that\nlonger recommendation lists are greener but less accurate. Then, we show that a\nsimple reranking approach that accounts for the item's carbon footprint can\nestablish a better trade-off between accuracy and greenness. This reranking\napproach is modular, ready to use, and can be applied to any RecSys algorithm\nwithout the need to alter the underlying mechanisms or retrain models. Our\nresults show that a small sacrifice of accuracy can lead to significant\nimprovements of recommendation greenness across all algorithms and list\nlengths. Arguably, this accuracy-greenness trade-off could even be seen as an\nenhancement of user satisfaction, particularly for purpose-driven users who\nprioritize the environmental impact of their choices. We anticipate this work\nwill serve as the starting point for studying RecSys for more sustainable\nrecommendations.",

    "abstract": "Non-transferable learning (NTL) has been proposed to protect model\nintellectual property (IP) by creating a \"non-transferable barrier\" to restrict\ngeneralization from authorized to unauthorized domains. Recently, well-designed\nattack, which restores the unauthorized-domain performance by fine-tuning NTL\nmodels on few authorized samples, highlights the security risks of NTL-based\napplications. However, such attack requires modifying model weights, thus being\ninvalid in the black-box scenario. This raises a critical question: can we\ntrust the security of NTL models deployed as black-box systems? In this work,\nwe reveal the first loophole of black-box NTL models by proposing a novel\nattack method (dubbed as JailNTL) to jailbreak the non-transferable barrier\nthrough test-time data disguising. The main idea of JailNTL is to disguise\nunauthorized data so it can be identified as authorized by the NTL model,\nthereby bypassing the non-transferable barrier without modifying the NTL model\nweights. Specifically, JailNTL encourages unauthorized-domain disguising in two\nlevels, including: (i) data-intrinsic disguising (DID) for eliminating domain\ndiscrepancy and preserving class-related content at the input-level, and (ii)\nmodel-guided disguising (MGD) for mitigating output-level statistics difference\nof the NTL model. Empirically, when attacking state-of-the-art (SOTA) NTL\nmodels in the black-box scenario, JailNTL achieves an accuracy increase of up\nto 55.7% in the unauthorized domain by using only 1% authorized samples,\nlargely exceeding existing SOTA white-box attacks.",

To address these\nchallenges, this paper proposes a network architecture named MSCA-Net, which\nintegrates three key components: Multi-Scale Enhanced Dilated Attention\nmechanism (MSEDA), Positional Convolutional Block Attention Module (PCBAM), and\nChannel Aggregation Feature Fusion Block (CAB).

PCBAM\ncaptures the correlation between global and local features through a\ncorrelation matrix-based strategy, enabling deep feature interaction. Moreover,\nCAB enhances the representation of critical features by assigning greater\nweights to them, integrating both low-level and high-level information, and\nthereby improving the models detection performance in complex backgrounds. The\nexperimental results demonstrate that MSCA-Net achieves strong small target\ndetection performance in complex backgrounds.

We outline an easy-to-use BO framework and\ndemonstrate that it outperforms alternative optimisation techniques while using\nsignificantly fewer computational resources. Our results show that BO is a\npromising technique for fusion design problems that rely on computationally\ndemanding high-fidelity simulations.",

    "abstract": "Deepfake detection is crucial for curbing the harm it causes to society.\nHowever, current Deepfake detection methods fail to thoroughly explore artifact\ninformation across different domains due to insufficient intrinsic\ninteractions. These interactions refer to the fusion and coordination after\nfeature extraction processes across different domains, which are crucial for\nrecognizing complex forgery clues. Focusing on more generalized Deepfake\ndetection, in this work, we introduce a novel bi-directional attention module\nto capture the local positional information of artifact clues from the spatial\ndomain. This enables accurate artifact localization, thus addressing the coarse\nprocessing with artifact features. To further address the limitation that the\nproposed bi-directional attention module may not well capture global subtle\nforgery information in the artifact feature (e.g., textures or edges), we\nemploy a fine-grained frequency attention module in the frequency domain. By\ndoing so, we can obtain high-frequency information in the fine-grained\nfeatures, which contains the global and subtle forgery information. Although\nthese features from the diverse domains can be effectively and independently\nimproved, fusing them directly does not effectively improve the detection\nperformance. Therefore, we propose a feature superposition strategy that\ncomplements information from spatial and frequency domains. This strategy turns\nthe feature components into the form of wave-like tokens, which are updated\nbased on their phase, such that the distinctions between authentic and artifact\nfeatures can be amplified. Our method demonstrates significant improvements\nover state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on five public Deepfake datasets in\ncapturing abnormalities across different manipulated operations and real-life.",

To fill this gap, we\nperform the first empirical study of LLMs' preferences for libraries and\nprogramming languages when generating code, covering eight diverse LLMs. Our\nresults reveal that LLMs exhibit a strong tendency to overuse widely adopted\nlibraries such as NumPy; in up to 48% of cases, this usage is unnecessary and\ndeviates from the ground-truth solutions.

To address this issue, we develop a two-stage\ngame-theoretical model to characterize the decision-making processes of\nmanufacturers and consumers before and after a technology upgrade. Considering\nthe unique structural characteristics of ADS, which consists of driving\nsoftware and its supporting hardware (SSH), we propose different business\nstrategies for SSH (bundle or unbundle with the vehicle) and driving software\n(perpetual licensing or subscription) from the manufacturer's perspective. We\nfind that, first, SSH strategies influence the optimal software strategies by\nchanging the consumers' entry barriers to the ADS market. Specifically, for\nmanufacturers with mature ADS technology, the bundle strategy provides\nconsumers with a lower entry barrier by integrating SSH, making the flexible\nsubscription model a dominant strategy; while perpetual licensing outperforms\nunder the unbundle strategy. Second, the software strategies influence the\noptimal SSH strategy by altering consumers' exit barriers. Perpetual licensing\nimposes higher exit barriers; when combined with a bundle strategy that lowers\nentry barriers, it becomes a more advantageous choice for manufacturers with\nmature ADS technology. In contrast, the subscription strategy allows consumers\nto easily exit the market, making the bundle strategy advantageous only when a\nsubstantial proportion of consumers are compatible with ADS.",

    "abstract": "The ability of machine learning (ML) classification models to resist small,\ntargeted input perturbations -- known as adversarial attacks -- is a key\nmeasure of their safety and reliability. We show that floating-point\nnon-associativity (FPNA) coupled with asynchronous parallel programming on GPUs\nis sufficient to result in misclassification, without any perturbation to the\ninput. Additionally, we show that standard adversarial robustness results may\nbe overestimated up to 4.6 when not considering machine-level details. We\ndevelop a novel black-box attack using Bayesian optimization to discover\nexternal workloads that can change the instruction scheduling which bias the\noutput of reductions on GPUs and reliably lead to misclassification. Motivated\nby these results, we present a new learnable permutation (LP) gradient-based\napproach to learning floating-point operation orderings that lead to\nmisclassifications. The LP approach provides a worst-case estimate in a\ncomputationally efficient manner, avoiding the need to run identical\nexperiments tens of thousands of times over a potentially large set of possible\nGPU states or architectures. Finally, using instrumentation-based testing, we\ninvestigate parallel reduction ordering across different GPU architectures\nunder external background workloads, when utilizing multi-GPU virtualization,\nand when applying power capping. Our results demonstrate that parallel\nreduction ordering varies significantly across architectures under the first\ntwo conditions, substantially increasing the search space required to fully\ntest the effects of this parallel scheduler-based vulnerability. These results\nand the methods developed here can help to include machine-level considerations\ninto adversarial robustness assessments, which can make a difference in safety\nand mission critical applications.",

These\ndigital twins allow systematic parameter variations to simulate various\nmorphologies, that can be deployed for virtual materials testing by means of\nspatially resolved numerical simulations of macroscopic properties. Generative\nadversarial networks (GANs) have gained popularity for calibrating models to\ngenerate realistic 3D morphologies. However, GANs often comprise of numerous\nuninterpretable parameters make systematic variation of morphologies for\nvirtual materials testing challenging. In contrast, low-parametric stochastic\ngeometry models (e.g., based on Gaussian random fields) enable targeted\nvariation but may struggle to mimic complex morphologies. Combining GANs with\nadvanced stochastic geometry models (e.g., excursion sets of more general\nrandom fields) addresses these limitations, allowing model calibration solely\nfrom 2D image data. This approach is demonstrated by generating a digital twin\nof all-solid-state battery (ASSB) cathodes. Since the digital twins are\nparametric, they support systematic exploration of structural scenarios and\ntheir macroscopic properties. The proposed method facilitates simulation\nstudies for optimizing 3D morphologies, benefiting not only ASSB cathodes but\nalso other materials with similar structures.",

    "abstract": "Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) is an essential sensor technology for\nautonomous driving as it can capture high-resolution 3D data. As 3D object\ndetection systems (OD) can interpret such point cloud data, they play a key\nrole in the driving decisions of autonomous vehicles. Consequently, such 3D OD\nmust be robust against all types of perturbations and must therefore be\nextensively tested. One approach is the use of adversarial examples, which are\nsmall, sometimes sophisticated perturbations in the input data that change,\ni.e., falsify, the prediction of the OD. These perturbations are carefully\ndesigned based on the weaknesses of the OD. The robustness of the OD cannot be\nquantified with adversarial examples in general, because if the OD is\nvulnerable to a given attack, it is unclear whether this is due to the\nrobustness of the OD or whether the attack algorithm produces particularly\nstrong adversarial examples. The contribution of this work is Hi-ALPS --\nHierarchical Adversarial-example-based LiDAR Perturbation Level System, where\nhigher robustness of the OD is required to withstand the perturbations as the\nperturbation levels increase. In doing so, the Hi-ALPS levels successively\nimplement a heuristic followed by established adversarial example approaches.\nIn a series of comprehensive experiments using Hi-ALPS, we quantify the\nrobustness of six state-of-the-art 3D OD under different types of\nperturbations. The results of the experiments show that none of the OD is\nrobust against all Hi-ALPS levels; an important factor for the ranking is that\nhuman observers can still correctly recognize the perturbed objects, as the\nrespective perturbations are small. To increase the robustness of the OD, we\ndiscuss the applicability of state-of-the-art countermeasures. In addition, we\nderive further suggestions for countermeasures based on our experimental\nresults.",

The\nsurface itself is shaped by spatial variations of the wires' cross section,\nyielding a curved geometrical background, the \"drum\", with imprints in the\ncorresponding QH spectra. We show that the latter are composed of two different\nclasses. The first one is asymptotically insensitive to the surface shape,\nscaling as $B^{1/2}$, like regular planar QH states. Instead, the second has an\nasymptotic $B$-field dependence intimately related to the wire geometry. We\nfurther demonstrate that an (axial-symmetric) curved nanowire surface possesses\na reciprocal partner surface, such that the respective QH spectra are dual to\neach other upon exchanging angular momentum and magnetic flux.

The precision of the weak-decay parameters for the decays\n$\\Sigma^{+} \\to p \\pi^{0}$ ($\\alpha_{0}$) and $\\bar{\\Sigma}^{-} \\to \\bar{p}\n\\pi^{0}$ ($\\bar{\\alpha}_{0}$) is improved by a factor of three compared to the\nprevious world average. Furthermore, the quantum-entangled\n$\\Sigma^{+}\\bar{\\Sigma}^{-}$ system enables the most precise test of $CP$\nsymmetry for the decay $\\Sigma^+\\to p\\pi^0$, through the asymmetry observable\n$A_{CP}=(\\alpha_{0}+\\bar{\\alpha}_{0})/(\\alpha_{0}-\\bar{\\alpha}_{0})$ that is\nmeasured to be $-0.0118\\pm0.0083_{\\rm stat}\\pm0.0028_{\\rm syst}$.

The expression of the\nangle matches well with the results of the weak deflection of relativistic\nparticles induced by a radially moving Schwarzschild source given in the\nliterature, when the transversal component of the lens velocity vanishes. The\njoint velocity effect, which consists of the influences of the transversal and\nradial motions of the lens on the leading-order Schwarzschild deflection of the\nmassive particles and light, is then discussed in the context of general\nrelativity. We analyze the order of magnitude of this kinematical effect and\nevaluate the possibility of its astronomical detection subsequently.",

    "abstract": "The geometric properties of quantum states are crucial for understanding many\nphysical phenomena in quantum mechanics, condensed matter physics, and optics.\nThe central object describing these properties is the quantum geometric tensor,\nwhich unifies the Berry curvature and the quantum metric. In this work, we use\nthe differential-geometric framework of vector bundles to analyze the\nproperties of parameter-dependent quantum states and generalize the quantum\ngeometric tensor to this setting. This construction is based on an arbitrary\nconnection on a Hermitian vector bundle, which defines a notion of quantum\nstate transport in parameter space, and a sub-bundle projector, which\nconstrains the set of accessible quantum states. We show that the sub-bundle\ngeometry is similar to that of submanifolds in Riemannian geometry and is\ndescribed by a generalization of the Gauss-Codazzi-Mainardi equations. This\nleads to a novel definition of the quantum geometric tensor, which contains an\nadditional curvature contribution. To illustrate our results, we describe the\nsub-bundle geometry arising in the semiclassical treatment of Dirac fields\npropagating in curved spacetime and show how the quantum geometric tensor, with\nits additional curvature contributions, is obtained in this case. As a concrete\nexample, we consider Dirac fermions confined to a hyperbolic plane and\ndemonstrate how spatial curvature influences the quantum geometry.

    "abstract": "Deformable shape representations, parameterized by deformations relative to a\ngiven template, have proven effective for improved image analysis tasks.\nHowever, their broader applicability is hindered by two major challenges.\nFirst, existing methods mainly rely on a known template during testing, which\nis impractical and limits flexibility. Second, they often struggle to capture\nfine-grained, voxel-level distinctions between similar shapes (e.g., anatomical\nvariations among healthy individuals, those with mild cognitive impairment, and\ndiseased states). To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework -\nContrastive Representation Learning of Deformable shapes (CoRLD) in learned\ndeformation spaces and demonstrate its effectiveness in the context of image\nclassification. Our CoRLD leverages a class-aware contrastive supervised\nlearning objective in latent deformation spaces, promoting proximity among\nrepresentations of similar classes while ensuring separation of dissimilar\ngroups. In contrast to previous deep learning networks that require a reference\nimage as input to predict deformation changes, our approach eliminates this\ndependency. Instead, template images are utilized solely as ground truth in the\nloss function during the training process, making our model more flexible and\ngeneralizable to a wide range of medical applications. We validate CoRLD on\ndiverse datasets, including real brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRIs) and\nadrenal shapes derived from computed tomography (CT) scans. Experimental\nresults show that our model effectively extracts deformable shape features,\nwhich can be easily integrated with existing classifiers to substantially boost\nthe classification accuracy.

    "abstract": "Exposure assessment in occupational epidemiology may involve multiple unknown\nquantities that are measured or reconstructed simultaneously for groups of\nworkers and over several years. Additionally, exposures may be collected using\ndifferent assessment strategies, depending on the period of exposure. As a\nconsequence, researchers who are analyzing occupational cohort studies are\ncommonly faced with challenging structures of exposure measurement error,\ninvolving complex dependence structures and multiple measurement error models,\ndepending on the period of exposure. However, previous work has often made many\nsimplifying assumptions concerning these errors. In this work, we propose a\nBayesian hierarchical approach to account for a broad range of error structures\narising in occupational epidemiology. The considered error structures may\ninvolve several unknown quantities that can be subject to mixtures of Berkson\nand classical measurement error. It is possible to account for different error\nstructures, depending on the exposure period and the location of a worker.\nMoreover, errors can present complex dependence structures over time and\nbetween workers. We illustrate the proposed hierarchical approach on a subgroup\nof the German cohort of uranium miners to account for potential exposure\nuncertainties in the association between radon exposure and lung cancer\nmortality. The performance of the proposed approach and its sensitivity to\nmodel misspecification are evaluated in a simulation study. The results show\nthat biases in estimates arising from very complex measurement errors can be\ncorrected through the proposed Bayesian hierarchical approach.",

We propose MedAgent-Pro, a new agentic reasoning paradigm\nthat follows the diagnosis principle in modern medicine, to decouple the\nprocess into sequential components for step-by-step, evidence-based reasoning.\nOur MedAgent-Pro workflow presents a hierarchical diagnostic structure to\nmirror this principle, consisting of disease-level standardized plan generation\nand patient-level personalized step-by-step reasoning. To support disease-level\nplanning, an RAG-based agent is designed to retrieve medical guidelines to\nensure alignment with clinical standards.

    "abstract": "A close relation has recently emerged between two of the most fundamental\nconcepts in physics and mathematics: chaos and supersymmetry. In striking\ncontrast to the semantics of the word 'chaos,' the true physical essence of\nthis phenomenon now appears to be a spontaneous order associated with the\nbreakdown of the topological supersymmetry (TS) hidden in all stochastic\n(partial) differential equations, i.e., in all systems from a broad domain\nranging from cosmology to nanoscience. Among the low-hanging fruits of this new\nperspective, which can be called the supersymmetric theory of stochastic\ndynamics (STS), are theoretical explanations of 1/f noise and self-organized\ncriticality. Central to STS is the physical meaning of TS breaking order\nparameter (OP). In this paper, we discuss that the OP is a field-theoretic\nembodiment of the 'butterfly effect' (BE) -- the infinitely long dynamical\nmemory that is definitive of chaos. We stress that the formulation of the\ncorresponding effective theory for the OP would mark the inception of the first\nconsistent physical theory of the BE. Such a theory, potentially a valuable\ntool in solving chaos-related problems, would parallel the well-established and\nsuccessful field theoretic descriptions of superconductivity, ferromagentism\nand other known orders arising from the spontaneous breakdown of various\nsymmetries of nature.",

To meet\nmodeling requirements, autoregressive models possessing the characteristics of\nscalability and flexibility embrace a discrete-valued tokenizer, but face the\nchallenge of poor image generation quality. In contrast, diffusion models take\nadvantage of the continuous-valued tokenizer to achieve better generation\nquality but are subject to low efficiency and complexity. The existing hybrid\nmodels are mainly to compensate for information loss and simplify the diffusion\nlearning process. The potential of merging discrete-valued and\ncontinuous-valued tokens in the field of image generation has not yet been\nexplored. In this paper, we propose D2C, a novel two-stage method to enhance\nmodel generation capacity. In the first stage, the discrete-valued tokens\nrepresenting coarse-grained image features are sampled by employing a small\ndiscrete-valued generator. Then in the second stage, the continuous-valued\ntokens representing fine-grained image features are learned conditioned on the\ndiscrete token sequence. In addition, we design two kinds of fusion modules for\nseamless interaction.

The inclusion of optical\ntime-series spectroscopy from the VLT FLAMES Tarantula Survey and archival HST\nspectroscopy confirms Melnick 39 as a double-lined O2.5If/WN6+O3V-III\nspectroscopic binary with orbital period near 648 days. We obtain a mass ratio\nof $q = 0.76 \\pm 0.06$, and minimum dynamical masses of $105\\pm11$ and\n$80\\pm11$ $M_{solar}$ for the O2.5If/WN6 and O3V-III components, plus\nphotometric evidence for an orbital inclination near 90 degrees. Disentangled\nspectroscopy allows the physical and wind properties of the primary to be\ndetermined, including $T_{\\ast}$ = 44 kK, $\\log L/L_{solar}$ = 6.2, $\\log\n\\dot{M}/M_{solar}$ yr$^{-1}$ = $-5.0$. Its dynamical mass agrees closely with\n$109 M_{solar}$ obtained from the mass-luminosity relation of very massive\nstars.",

B-doped $\\alpha$-Fe2O3 led to the formation of\nimpurity bands, which were mitigated by utilizing co-dopants (B, Y) and (B,\nNb). The metal dopants, Y and Nb, significantly increased the charge carrier\ndensity, while the co-dopants, (B, Y) and (B, Nb), substantially enhanced light\nabsorption in the visible spectrum.",

    "abstract": "The weights of neural networks (NNs) have recently gained prominence as a new\ndata modality in machine learning, with applications ranging from accuracy and\nhyperparameter prediction to representation learning or weight generation. One\napproach to leverage NN weights involves training autoencoders (AEs), using\ncontrastive and reconstruction losses. This allows such models to be applied to\na wide variety of downstream tasks, and they demonstrate strong predictive\nperformance and low reconstruction error. However, despite the low\nreconstruction error, these AEs reconstruct NN models with deteriorated\nperformance compared to the original ones, limiting their usability with regard\nto model weight generation. In this paper, we identify a limitation of\nweight-space AEs, specifically highlighting that a structural loss, that uses\nthe Euclidean distance between original and reconstructed weights, fails to\ncapture some features critical for reconstructing high-performing models. We\nanalyze the addition of a behavioral loss for training AEs in weight space,\nwhere we compare the output of the reconstructed model with that of the\noriginal one, given some common input. We show a strong synergy between\nstructural and behavioral signals, leading to increased performance in all\ndownstream tasks evaluated, in particular NN weights reconstruction and\ngeneration.",

The unique feature of event cameras in capturing only the outlines of\nmotion, combined with SNNs' proficiency in processing spatiotemporal data\nthrough spikes, establishes a highly synergistic compatibility for event-based\nHAR. Previous studies, however, have been limited by SNNs' ability to process\nlong-term temporal information, essential for precise HAR. In this paper, we\nintroduce two novel frameworks to address this: temporal segment-based SNN\n(\\textit{TS-SNN}) and 3D convolutional SNN (\\textit{3D-SNN}). The\n\\textit{TS-SNN} extracts long-term temporal information by dividing actions\ninto shorter segments, while the \\textit{3D-SNN} replaces 2D spatial elements\nwith 3D components to facilitate the transmission of temporal information. To\npromote further research in event-based HAR, we create a dataset,\n\\textit{FallingDetection-CeleX}, collected using the high-resolution CeleX-V\nevent camera $(1280 \\times 800)$, comprising 7 distinct actions.

Deterministic\npolynomial time algorithms (even with access to $NP$ oracles) solving this\nproblem is known to imply explicit constructions of various pseudorandom\nobjects like hard Boolean functions, linear codes, PRGs etc. Deterministic\npolynomial time algorithms are known for $NC^0_2$-$avoid$ when $m > n$, and for\n$NC^0_3$-$avoid$ when $m \\ge \\frac{n^2}{\\log n}$, where $NC^0_k$ is the class\nof circuits with bounded fan-in which have constant depth and the output\ndepends on at most $k$ of the input bits.

It should work under the\ncondition, that all participating signals (the classified object description,\ncorrect class label and SNN decision) should have spiking nature. As a result,\nthe CoLaNET (columnar layered network) SNN architecture was invented. The\ndistinctive feature of this architecture is a combination of prototypical\nnetwork structures corresponding to different classes and significantly\ndistinctive instances of one class (=columns) and functionally differing\npopulations of neurons inside columns (=layers). The other distinctive feature\nis a novel combination of anti-Hebbian and dopamine-modulated plasticity. While\nCoLaNET is relatively simple, it includes several hyperparameters. Their choice\nfor particular classification tasks is not trivial. Besides that, specific\nfeatures of the data classified (e.g. classification of separate pictures like\nin MNIST dataset vs. classifying objects in a continuous video stream) require\ncertain modifications of CoLaNET structure. To solve these problems, the deep\nmathematical exploration of CoLaNET should be carried out. However, SNNs, being\nstochastic discrete systems, are usually very hard for exact mathematical\nanalysis. To make it easier, I developed a continuous numeric (non-spiking)\nmachine learning algorithm which approximates CoLaNET behavior with\nsatisfactory accuracy. It is described in the paper. At present, it is being\nstudied by exact analytic methods. We hope that the results of this study could\nbe applied to direct calculation of CoLaNET hyperparameters and optimization of\nits structure.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning has become an essential part of computer vision, with deep\nneural networks (DNNs) excelling in predictive performance. However, they often\nfall short in other critical quality dimensions, such as robustness,\ncalibration, or fairness. While existing studies have focused on a subset of\nthese quality dimensions, none have explored a more general form of\n\"well-behavedness\" of DNNs. With this work, we address this gap by\nsimultaneously studying nine different quality dimensions for image\nclassification. Through a large-scale study, we provide a bird's-eye view by\nanalyzing 326 backbone models and how different training paradigms and model\narchitectures affect the quality dimensions. We reveal various new insights\nsuch that (i) vision-language models exhibit high fairness on ImageNet-1k\nclassification and strong robustness against domain changes; (ii)\nself-supervised learning is an effective training paradigm to improve almost\nall considered quality dimensions; and (iii) the training dataset size is a\nmajor driver for most of the quality dimensions. We conclude our study by\nintroducing the QUBA score (Quality Understanding Beyond Accuracy), a novel\nmetric that ranks models across multiple dimensions of quality, enabling\ntailored recommendations based on specific user needs.",

    "abstract": "Zero-Shot Composed Image Retrieval (ZS-CIR) involves diverse tasks with a\nbroad range of visual content manipulation intent across domain, scene, object,\nand attribute. The key challenge for ZS-CIR tasks is to modify a reference\nimage according to manipulation text to accurately retrieve a target image,\nespecially when the reference image is missing essential target content. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel prediction-based mapping network, named\nPrediCIR, to adaptively predict the missing target visual content in reference\nimages in the latent space before mapping for accurate ZS-CIR. Specifically, a\nworld view generation module first constructs a source view by omitting certain\nvisual content of a target view, coupled with an action that includes the\nmanipulation intent derived from existing image-caption pairs. Then, a target\ncontent prediction module trains a world model as a predictor to adaptively\npredict the missing visual information guided by user intention in manipulating\ntext at the latent space. The two modules map an image with the predicted\nrelevant information to a pseudo-word token without extra supervision. Our\nmodel shows strong generalization ability on six ZS-CIR tasks. It obtains\nconsistent and significant performance boosts ranging from 1.73% to 4.45% over\nthe best methods and achieves new state-of-the-art results on ZS-CIR.

    "abstract": "Transparent and specular objects are frequently encountered in daily life,\nfactories, and laboratories. However, due to the unique optical properties, the\ndepth information on these objects is usually incomplete and inaccurate, which\nposes significant challenges for downstream robotics tasks. Therefore, it is\ncrucial to accurately restore the depth information of transparent and specular\nobjects. Previous depth completion methods for these objects usually use RGB\ninformation as an additional channel of the depth image to perform depth\nprediction. Due to the poor-texture characteristics of transparent and specular\nobjects, these methods that rely heavily on color information tend to generate\nstructure-less depth predictions. Moreover, these 2D methods cannot effectively\nexplore the 3D structure hidden in the depth channel, resulting in depth\nambiguity. To this end, we propose a geometry-aware assisted depth completion\nmethod for transparent and specular objects, which focuses on exploring the 3D\nstructural cues of the scene. Specifically, besides extracting 2D features from\nRGB-D input, we back-project the input depth to a point cloud and build the 3D\nbranch to extract hierarchical scene-level 3D structural features. To exploit\n3D geometric information, we design several gated cross-modal fusion modules to\neffectively propagate multi-level 3D geometric features to the image branch. In\naddition, we propose an adaptive correlation aggregation strategy to\nappropriately assign 3D features to the corresponding 2D features. Extensive\nexperiments on ClearGrasp, OOD, TransCG, and STD datasets show that our method\noutperforms other state-of-the-art methods.

To address these challenges, we introduce the\nMP-ReID benchmark, a novel dataset designed specifically for multi-modality and\nmulti-platform ReID. This benchmark uniquely compiles data from 1,930\nidentities across diverse modalities, including RGB, infrared, and thermal\nimaging, captured by both UAVs and ground-based cameras in indoor and outdoor\nenvironments. Building on this benchmark, we introduce Uni-Prompt ReID, a\nframework with specific-designed prompts, tailored for cross-modality and\ncross-platform scenarios. Our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art\napproaches, establishing a robust foundation for future research in complex and\ndynamic ReID environments.

Sharing maps requires estimating a joint\nreference frame, which is typically referred to as registration. However, there\nis a lack of scalable methods and training datasets for registering SfM\nreconstructions. In this paper, we tackle this challenge by proposing the\nscalable task of point cloud registration for SfM reconstructions. We find that\ncurrent registration methods cannot register SfM point clouds when trained on\nexisting datasets. To this end, we propose a SfM registration dataset\ngeneration pipeline, leveraging partial reconstructions from synthetically\ngenerated camera trajectories for each scene.

Two main types of rectifiers, insulated-gate\nbipolar transistor rectifiers (IGBT-Rs) and thyristor rectifiers (TRs), offer\ndistinct tradeoffs. IGBT-Rs provide flexible reactive power control but are\ncostly, whereas TRs are more affordable with lower power loss but consume a\nlarge amount of uncontrollable reactive power. A mixed configuration of\nrectifiers in utility-scale ReP2H systems could achieve an decent tradeoff and\nincrease overall profitability. To explore this potential, this paper proposes\nan optimal investment portfolio model. First, we model and compare the active\nand reactive power characteristics of ELZs powered by TRs and IGBT-Rs. Second,\nwe consider the investment of ELZs, rectifiers, and var resources and\ncoordinate the operation of renewables, energy storage, var resources, and the\non-off switching and load allocation of multiple ELZs. Subsequently, a\ntwo-stage stochastic programming (SP) model based on weighted information gap\ndecision theory (W-IGDT) is developed to address the uncertainties of the\nrenewable power and hydrogen price, and we apply the progressive hedging (PH)\nalgorithm to accelerate its solution. Case studies demonstrate that optimal\nrectifier configurations increase revenue by at most 2.56% compared with using\nonly TRs or IGBT-Rs, as well as those in existing projects. Under the optimal\nportfolio, reactive power compensation investment is nearly eliminated, with a\npreferred TR-to-IGBT-R ratio of 3:1.",

The combination of a dynamical model and observational data is\nessential for characterizing the configuration and planetary mass in close\nbinaries. We calculate the theoretical radial velocity (RV) signal in the\nN-body framework and observe a drift in the RV semi-amplitude, which leads to a\nreduction in the $m$sin$i$ detection threshold by 20 $M_{\\oplus}$, with $\\sim$\n100% detection probability in the $m_1$sin$i_1$-$a_1$ parameter space.\nHigh-precision RV data with an accuracy of 1 m/s can detect such dynamical\neffects. For four close-in binaries-GJ 86, GJ 3021, HD 196885, and HD 41004,\nthe deviation between the minimum mass derived from the Keplerian and N-body\nmodels is found to be $> 0.2 ~ M_{\\mathrm{Jup}}$. High-precision astrometric\ndata are also necessary to resolve the 3D orbits and true masses exoplanets. We\ngenerate astrometric simulation data with accuracies corresponding to Gaia\n(57.8 $\\mu$as) and the Closeby Habitable Exoplanet Survey (CHES) (1 $\\mu$as),\nrespectively. Joint orbit fitting is performed for RV + Gaia and RV + CHES\nsynergy methods. Compared with the fitting results from the astrometry-only\nmodel, the synergy models more effectively constrain the range of orbital\ninclinations.

Although this phenomenon has been reported in a number of\npublications, little is known about the effectiveness of bias mitigation\nalgorithms in this domain. We aim to investigate the impact of common bias\nmitigation methods to address bias between Black and White subjects in AI-based\nCMR segmentation models. Specifically, we use oversampling, importance\nreweighing and Group DRO as well as combinations of these techniques to\nmitigate the ethnicity bias. Second, motivated by recent findings on the root\ncauses of AI-based CMR segmentation bias, we evaluate the same methods using\nmodels trained and evaluated on cropped CMR images. We find that bias can be\nmitigated using oversampling, significantly improving performance for the\nunderrepresented Black subjects whilst not significantly reducing the majority\nWhite subjects' performance. Using cropped images increases performance for\nboth ethnicities and reduces the bias, whilst adding oversampling as a bias\nmitigation technique with cropped images reduces the bias further.

We derive non-asymptotic achievability\nbounds on the probability of incorrectly estimating the number of active users,\nand provide scaling laws on the gap between the estimated and true numbers of\nactive users. We prove that the error probability reaches a plateau as the\npower $P$ and blocklength $n$ increase, whereas it decays exponentially with\nthe number $L$ of receive antennas and eventually vanishes. Then, we explore\nthe fundamental limits of URA by deriving non-asymptotic achievability bounds\nand converse bounds (including two single-user converse bounds and one\nmulti-user ensemble converse bound) on the minimum energy-per-bit required by\neach active user to transmit $J$ bits with blocklength $n$ under misdetection\nand false-alarm constraints. Numerical results show that the extra required\nenergy-per-bit due to the uncertainty in the number ${\\rm{K}}_a$ of active\nusers decreases as $L$ and $\\mathbb{E}[{\\rm{K}}_a]$ increase and the error\nrequirement becomes milder. In the non-asymptotic regime, using codewords\ndistributed on a sphere outperforms Gaussian random coding. Existing schemes\nare shown to exhibit a large gap to our bounds when the number of active users\nis large, calling for more advanced schemes that perform energy-efficiently in\nthis case.

    "abstract": "We present results of numerical relativity simulations for the collapse of\nrotating magnetized white dwarfs (WDs) in three dimension, aiming at discussing\nthe explosion dynamics and associate multi-messenger signals: gravitational\nwaves (GWs), neutrinos, and electromagnetic counterparts. All WDs initiate\ngravitational collapse due to electron captures and then experience prompt type\nexplosions after the proto neutron star formation. We observe the explosions\ndominated by a bipolar structure and the emergence of strong spiral waves in\nrapidly rotating models. The spiral waves facilitate to increase both the\nexplosion energy and ejecta mass, though the final values still fall in the\ncategory of low explosion energy supernovae with small ejecta mass. The spiral\nwaves also produce strong GWs, which may expand the horizon distance of such\nevents against GWs up to ~10 Mpc for third-generation ground-based detectors.\nAdditionally as an intriguing implication, we demonstrate that such accretion\nor merger induced collapse of WDs might be able to explain some of the rapidly\nevolving optical transients, such as fast blue optical transients (FBOTs), as\npreviously suggested. Based on the simulation results together with several\nassumptions, we confirm that the magnetar may account for the brighter side of\nsome of observed FBOTs, while a combination of ejecta-envelope interaction\nwhich can be also followed by radioactive decay of heavy elements synthesized\nalong with the explosion might still explain the fainter branch even in the\nabsence of magnetar formation.",

However, CLIP's training remains computationally intensive, with high\ndemands on both data processing and memory. To address these challenges, recent\nmasking strategies have emerged, focusing on the selective removal of image\npatches to improve training efficiency. Although effective, these methods often\ncompromise key semantic information, resulting in suboptimal alignment between\nvisual features and text descriptions. In this work, we present a concise yet\neffective approach called Patch Generation-to-Selection to enhance CLIP's\ntraining efficiency while preserving critical semantic content. Our method\nintroduces a gradual masking process in which a small set of candidate patches\nis first pre-selected as potential mask regions. Then, we apply Sobel edge\ndetection across the entire image to generate an edge mask that prioritizes the\nretention of the primary object areas. Finally, similarity scores between the\ncandidate mask patches and their neighboring patches are computed, with optimal\ntransport normalization refining the selection process to ensure a balanced\nsimilarity matrix. Our approach, CLIP-PGS, sets new state-of-the-art results in\nzero-shot classification and retrieval tasks, achieving superior performance in\nrobustness evaluation and language compositionality benchmarks.",

We\nanalyze the sampling objective in MaskGIT, based on the mutual information\nbetween tokens, and elucidate its shortcomings. We then propose a new sampling\nstrategy based on our Halton scheduler instead of the original Confidence\nscheduler. More precisely, our method selects the token's position according to\na quasi-random, low-discrepancy Halton sequence.

Our analysis shows that it allows reducing non-recoverable sampling\nerrors, leading to simpler hyper-parameters tuning and better quality images.\nOur scheduler does not require retraining or noise injection and may serve as a\nsimple drop-in replacement for the original sampling strategy. Evaluation of\nboth class-to-image synthesis on ImageNet and text-to-image generation on the\nCOCO dataset demonstrates that the Halton scheduler outperforms the Confidence\nscheduler quantitatively by reducing the FID and qualitatively by generating\nmore diverse and more detailed images.

    "abstract": "With the growing interconnection between In-Vehicle Networks (IVNs) and\nexternal environments, intelligent vehicles are increasingly vulnerable to\nsophisticated external network attacks. This paper proposes ATHENA, the first\nIVN intrusion detection framework that adopts a vehicle-cloud integrated\narchitecture to achieve better security performance for the\nresource-constrained vehicular environment. Specifically, in the cloud with\nsufficient resources, ATHENA uses the clustering method of multi-distribution\nmixture model combined with deep data mining technology to generate the raw\nPayload Rule Bank of IVN CAN messages, and then improves the rule quality with\nthe help of exploitation on the first-principled physical knowledge of the\nvehicle system, after which the payload rules are periodically sent to the\nvehicle terminal. At the vehicle terminal, a simple LSTM component is used to\ngenerate the Time Rule Bank representing the long-term time series dependencies\nand the periodic characteristics of CAN messages, but not for any detection\ntasks as in traditional usage scenarios, where only the generated time rules\nare the candidates for further IVN intrusion detection tasks. Based on both the\npayload and time rules generated from cloud and vehicle terminal, ATHENA can\nachieve efficient intrusion detection capability by simple rule-base matching\noperations, rather than using complex black-box reasoning of resource-intensive\nneural network models, which is in fact only used for rule logic generation\nphase instead of the actual intrusion detection phase in our framework.\nComparative experimental results on the ROAD dataset, which is current the most\noutstanding real-world in-vehicle CAN dataset covering new instances of\nsophisticated and stealthy masquerade attacks, demonstrate ATHENA significantly\noutperforms the state-of-the-art IVN intrusion detection methods in detecting\ncomplex attacks.",

This results in a strongly suppressed charge current\nbelow the superconducting gap, while still allowing the extraction of\nexcitations above the gap, leading to a cooler with enhanced performance.\nInterestingly, we find that such a large cooling power per channel enables the\nachievement of an electronic temperature close to the theoretical lower bound.\nAdditionally, we derive an approximate expression for this bound in the regime\nof low bath temperatures.

We propose the task of expressive 3D captioning: given an\ninput 3D scene, describe objects at multiple levels of detail: a high-level\nobject description, and a low-level description of the properties of its parts.\nTo produce such captions, we present ExCap3D, an expressive 3D captioning model\nwhich takes as input a 3D scan, and for each detected object in the scan,\ngenerates a fine-grained collective description of the parts of the object,\nalong with an object-level description conditioned on the part-level\ndescription. We design ExCap3D to encourage semantic consistency between the\ngenerated text descriptions, as well as textual similarity in the latent space,\nto further increase the quality of the generated captions. To enable this task,\nwe generated the ExCap3D Dataset by leveraging a visual-language model (VLM)\nfor multi-view captioning. The ExCap3D Dataset contains captions on the\nScanNet++ dataset with varying levels of detail, comprising 190k text\ndescriptions of 34k 3D objects in 947 indoor scenes.

X-ray diffraction analysis of the BaTiO3 substrate under varying electric\nfields was used to analyze the orientation of ferroelectric domains. These\nresults indicated that BaTiO3 exhibits two distinct states depending on the\napplied electric field: one with domains aligned with the electric field and\nanother with random domain orientation when the field is removed. After\nsubstrate poling, the Ni90Fe10 layer switches from weak perpendicular\nanisotropy to an in-plane uniaxial magnetic anisotropy, with the in-plane\ndirection of anisotropy being controllable by 90{\\deg} through an electric\nfield. This effect is due to an efficient strain transfer from BaTiO3 to the\nNi90Fe10 lattice, induced by ferroelectric polarization, as shown by XRD.\nRemarkably, this rotation of the magnetic anisotropy leads to an enhanced\nconverse magnetoelectric coupling value of 1.43 {\\mu}s/m, surpassing previously\nreported values for other BaTiO3-based heterostructures by an order of\nmagnitude.

Our results show that currently proprietary judge LLMs have the\nhighest correlation with human judgments, followed by criteria-specific\nautomatic metrics, while open-sourced judge LLMs perform poorly. We release\nBASSE and our code publicly, along with the first large-scale Basque\nsummarization dataset containing 22,525 news articles with their subheads.",

Architectural features such as Intel RDT,\nArm QoS, and Arm MPAM are either unavailable on commercial embedded platforms\nor designed primarily for server environments optimized for average-case\nperformance and might fail to deliver the expected real-time guarantees. Arm\nDynamIQ Shared Unit (DSU) includes isolation features-among others, hardware\nper-way cache partitioning-that can improve the real-time guarantees of complex\nembedded multicore systems and facilitate real-time analysis. However, the DSU\nalso targets average cases, and its real-time capabilities have not yet been\nevaluated. This paper presents the first comprehensive analysis of three\nreal-world deployments of the Arm DSU on Rockchip RK3568, Rockchip RK3588, and\nNVIDIA Orin platforms. We integrate support for the DSU at the operating system\nand hypervisor level and conduct a large-scale evaluation using both synthetic\nand real-world benchmarks with varying types and intensities of interference.\nOur results make extensive use of performance counters and indicate that,\nalthough effective, the quality of partitioning and isolation provided by the\nDSU depends on the type and the intensity of the interfering workloads. In\naddition, we uncover and analyze in detail the correlation between benchmarks\nand different types and intensities of interference.",

Because causal ground truth is rarely known in the\nreal world, simulated data plays a vital role in evaluating the performance of\nthe various causal discovery algorithms proposed in the literature. But recent\nwork highlighted certain artifacts of commonly used data generation techniques\nfor a standard class of structural causal models (SCM) that may be nonphysical,\nincluding var- and R2-sortability, where the variables' variance and\ncoefficients of determination (R2) after regressing on all other variables,\nrespectively, increase along the causal order. Some causal methods exploit such\nartifacts, leading to unrealistic expectations for their performance on\nreal-world data. Some modifications have been proposed to remove these\nartifacts; notably, the internally-standardized structural causal model (iSCM)\navoids varsortability and largely alleviates R2-sortability on sparse causal\ngraphs, but exhibits a reversed R2-sortability pattern for denser graphs not\nfeatured in their work. We analyze which sortability patterns we expect to see\nin real data, and propose a method for drawing coefficients that we argue more\neffectively samples the space of SCMs. Finally, we propose a novel extension of\nour SCM generation method to the time series setting.",

However, it struggles to learn well-conditioned\nrepresentations of datasets with long-tailed class distributions. This problem\nis potentially exacerbated for binary imbalanced distributions, which are\ncommonly encountered during many real-world problems such as medical diagnosis.\nIn experiments on seven binary datasets of natural and medical images, we show\nthat the performance of SupCon decreases with increasing class imbalance. To\nsubstantiate these findings, we introduce two novel metrics that evaluate the\nquality of the learned representation space. By measuring the class\ndistribution in local neighborhoods, we are able to uncover structural\ndeficiencies of the representation space that classical metrics cannot detect.\nInformed by these insights, we propose two new supervised contrastive learning\nstrategies tailored to binary imbalanced datasets that improve the structure of\nthe representation space and increase downstream classification accuracy over\nstandard SupCon by up to 35%.

While inhibition of motor\nactivity significantly reduces both effective temperature and time\nirreversibility, inhibited material turnover leaves the effective temperature\nlargely unchanged but lowers the time irreversibility and entropy production\nrate. Our experimental findings in combination with a minimal model highlight\nthat time irreversibility, effective temperature and entropy production rate\ncan follow opposite trends in active living systems, challenging in particular\nthe validity of effective temperature as a proxy for the distance from thermal\nequilibrium.

The selection of avoidance points is achieved by\nintegrating static and dynamic obstacle to generate a potential field map.

We propose a simple framework to\nrationalize these effects, suggesting that plastic strain fluctuations increase\nwith the diffusion coefficient and decrease with the anticorrelation between\nforward and backward strain, which is enhanced in denser packings.",

Most of these\nbinaries have a tertiary companion, and here we explore how a nearby third body\npossibly influences this evolutionary channel. Our analysis combines analytic\ntreatments of triple dynamics with insights from detailed stellar evolution\nmodels, focusing on the role of the von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai mechanism while also\naccounting for tidal and general relativistic apsidal precession. We examine\nthe dynamics of triples at three critical evolutionary stages: the zero-age\nmain sequence, shortly after the main sequence, and at the time of BBH\nformation. We find that, for triples having outer orbital periods less than 70\nd(120 d), the inner binary can merge during(or after) the main-sequence stage,\nleading to a hydrogen-rich(helium-rich) stellar merger. If a stellar merger is\navoided, the inner binary may eventually form a BBH. In mildly hierarchical\ntriples, with outer periods of around 100 d, the tertiary component can trigger\na rapid merger of the BBH on timescales comparable to the outer orbital period.\nStellar tides play a crucial role in determining the fate of the inner binary\nin such tight triple systems, as they can suppress the perturbative effects of\nthe third star. When tidal forces damp the oscillations induced by the\ntertiary, the BBH merger may occur soon after stellar collapse. Notably, these\noutcomes are not restricted to CHE binaries but can also apply to any BBH\nformed from stars in tight orbits. Mergers in these systems are characterized\nby the proximity of a tertiary companion and the presence of recently ejected\ngas, making them promising candidates for electromagnetic counterparts and\ngravitational-wave signals influenced by nearby tertiary objects.",

It is designed for\nindoor ground mobile robots that utilize laser Simultaneous Localization and\nMapping (SLAM), ensuring process completeness and precise mapping results. For\nfrontier search, the local-global sampling architecture based on multiple\nRapidly Exploring Random Trees (RRTs) is employed. Traversability checks during\nRRT expansion and global RRT pruning upon map updates eliminate unreachable\nfrontiers, reducing potential collisions and deadlocks. Adaptive sampling\ndensity adjustments, informed by obstacle distribution, enhance exploration\ncoverage potential. For frontier point navigation, a stepwise consistent motion\nstrategy is adopted, wherein the robot strictly drives straight on\napproximately equidistant line segments in the polyline path and rotates in\nplace at segment junctions. This simplified, decoupled motion pattern improves\nscan-matching stability and mitigates map drift. For process control, the\nframework serializes frontier point selection and navigation, avoiding\noscillation caused by frequent goal changes in conventional parallelized\nprocesses. The waypoint retracing mechanism is introduced to generate repeated\nobservations, triggering loop closure detection and backend optimization in\ngraph-based SLAM, thereby improving map consistency and precision. Experiments\nin both simulation and real-world scenarios validate the effectiveness of the\nframework. It achieves improved mapping coverage and precision in more\nchallenging environments compared to baseline 2D exploration algorithms.

In practical operation, well manually calibrated extrinsic\nparameters, which are crucial for the fusion of multi-modal sensors, may drift\ndue to the vibration. To address this issue, we present a novel targetless\ncalibration approach, termed LiRaCo, for the extrinsic 6DoF calibration of\nLiDAR and Radar sensors. Although both types of sensors can obtain geometric\ninformation, bridging the geometric correspondences between multi-modal data\nwithout any clues of explicit artificial markers is nontrivial, mainly due to\nthe low vertical resolution of scanning Radar. To achieve the targetless\ncalibration, LiRaCo leverages a spatial occupancy consistency between LiDAR\npoint clouds and Radar scans in a common cylindrical representation,\nconsidering the increasing data sparsity with distance for both sensors.\nSpecifically, LiRaCo expands the valid Radar scanned pixels into 3D occupancy\ngrids to constrain LiDAR point clouds based on spatial consistency.\nConsequently, a cost function involving extrinsic calibration parameters is\nformulated based on the spatial overlap of 3D grids and LiDAR points. Extrinsic\nparameters are finally estimated by optimizing the cost function. Comprehensive\nquantitative and qualitative experiments on two real outdoor datasets with\ndifferent LiDAR sensors demonstrate the feasibility and accuracy of the\nproposed method.

As this variability increases, and\nowing to the large dimensionality of the system, limit cycles typically acquire\na growing spectrum of frequencies. This often leads to the appearance of\nstrange attractors, with a chaotic dynamics of species abundances characterized\nby a positive Lyapunov exponent. We observe that limit cycles and strange\nattractors preserve biodiversity to some extent, as they maintain dynamical\nstability without species extinction. We give numerical evidences that this\nroute to chaos dominates in ecosystems with strong enough interactions and\nwhere predator-prey behavior dominates over competition and mutualism. Based on\narguments from random matrix theory, we further conjecture that this scenario\nis generic in ecosystems with large number of species, and identify the key\nparameters driving it.

In the second part of the paper we study\nnonlinear $m$-term approximation with the constructed bases, where direct\nJackson and Bernstein inequalities for $m$-term approximation with the tensor\nbrushlet system in $\\alpha$-modulation and $\\alpha$-Triebel-Lizorkin spaces are\nderived. The inverse Bernstein estimates rely heavily on the fact that the\nconstructed system is non-redundant.",

Currently, many automated\nalgorithms are primarily targeted at CTPA (Computed Tomography Pulmonary\nAngiography) types of data. However, the segmentation precision of these\nmethods is insufficient, and support for NCCT (Non-Contrast Computed\nTomography) types of data is also a requirement in some clinical scenarios. In\nthis study, we propose a 3D image segmentation algorithm for automated\npulmonary vessel segmentation from both contrast-enhanced and non-contrast CT\nimages. In the network, we designed a Vessel Lumen Structure Optimization\nModule (VLSOM), which extracts the centerline (Cl) of vessels and adjusts the\nweights based on the positional information and adds a Cl-Dice Loss to\nsupervise the stability of the vessels structure. We used 427 sets of\nhigh-precision annotated CT data from multiple vendors and countries to train\nthe model and achieved Cl-DICE, Cl-Recall, and Recall values of 0.892, 0.861,\n0.924 for CTPA data and 0.925, 0.903, 0.949 for NCCT data. This shows that our\nmodel has achieved good performance in both accuracy and completeness of\npulmonary vessel segmentation. We finally conducted a clinical visual\nassessment on an independent external test dataset. The average score for\naccuracy and robustness, branch abundance, assistance for diagnosis and\nvascular continuity are 4.26, 4.17, 4.33, 3.83 respectively while the full\nscore is 5.

By removing only a\nsmall fraction of tokens, these methods still produce relatively lengthy\ncontinuous sequences, which falls short of the extreme compression required to\nbalance computational efficiency and token count in video LLMs. In this paper,\nwe introduce the novel task of Extreme Short Token Reduction, which aims to\nrepresent entire videos using a minimal set of discrete tokens.

On\nthe Extreme Short Token Reduction task, our VQToken compresses sequences to\njust 0.07 percent of their original length while incurring only a 0.66 percent\ndrop in accuracy on the NextQA-MC benchmark. It also achieves comparable\nperformance on ActNet-QA, Long Video Bench, and VideoMME. We further introduce\nthe Token Information Density (TokDense) metric and formalize fixed-length and\nadaptive-length subtasks, achieving state-of-the-art results in both settings.\nOur approach dramatically lowers theoretical complexity, increases information\ndensity, drastically reduces token counts, and enables efficient video LLMs in\nresource-constrained environments.",

We evaluate how consistently LLMs produce outputs given identical\ninputs through extensive experimentation with 50 independent runs across five\ncommon tasks: classification, sentiment analysis, summarization, text\ngeneration, and prediction. Using three OpenAI models (GPT-3.5-turbo,\nGPT-4o-mini, and GPT-4o), we generate over 3.4 million outputs from diverse\nfinancial source texts and data, covering MD&As, FOMC statements, finance news\narticles, earnings call transcripts, and financial statements.

More advanced models do not consistently\ndemonstrate better consistency and reproducibility, with task-specific patterns\nemerging. LLMs significantly outperform expert human annotators in consistency\nand maintain high agreement even where human experts significantly disagree. We\nfurther find that simple aggregation strategies across 3-5 runs dramatically\nimprove consistency. We also find that aggregation may come with an additional\nbenefit of improved accuracy for sentiment analysis when using newer models.\nSimulation analysis reveals that despite measurable inconsistency in LLM\noutputs, downstream statistical inferences remain remarkably robust.

In software requirements engineering, quality or\nnon-functional requirements have long been recognized as a key factor in system\nsuccess. Currently, qualities are not represented in behavior tree models,\nwhich capture a robotic mission, making it difficult to assess the extent to\nwhich different mission components comply with those qualities.

A preliminary\nevaluation of the implemented DSL shows promising results for the feasibility\nof our approach and the need for similar DSLs.

    "abstract": "Vision Language Models exhibited immense potential for embodied AI, yet they\noften lack the sophisticated situational reasoning required for complex\ndecision-making. This paper shows that VLMs can achieve surprisingly strong\ndecision-making performance when visual scenes are represented merely as\ntext-only descriptions, suggesting foundational reasoning can be effectively\nlearned from language. Motivated by this insight, we propose Praxis-VLM, a\nreasoning VLM for vision-grounded decision-making. Praxis-VLM employs the GRPO\nalgorithm on textual scenarios to instill robust reasoning capabilities, where\nmodels learn to evaluate actions and their consequences. These reasoning\nskills, acquired purely from text, successfully transfer to multimodal\ninference with visual inputs, significantly reducing reliance on scarce paired\nimage-text training data. Experiments across diverse decision-making benchmarks\ndemonstrate that Praxis-VLM substantially outperforms standard supervised\nfine-tuning, exhibiting superior performance and generalizability. Further\nanalysis confirms that our models engage in explicit and effective reasoning,\nunderpinning their enhanced performance and adaptability.",

    "abstract": "Drones have become essential tools for reconstructing wild scenes due to\ntheir outstanding maneuverability. Recent advances in radiance field methods\nhave achieved remarkable rendering quality, providing a new avenue for 3D\nreconstruction from drone imagery. However, dynamic distractors in wild\nenvironments challenge the static scene assumption in radiance fields, while\nlimited view constraints hinder the accurate capture of underlying scene\ngeometry. To address these challenges, we introduce DroneSplat, a novel\nframework designed for robust 3D reconstruction from in-the-wild drone imagery.\nOur method adaptively adjusts masking thresholds by integrating local-global\nsegmentation heuristics with statistical approaches, enabling precise\nidentification and elimination of dynamic distractors in static scenes. We\nenhance 3D Gaussian Splatting with multi-view stereo predictions and a\nvoxel-guided optimization strategy, supporting high-quality rendering under\nlimited view constraints. For comprehensive evaluation, we provide a\ndrone-captured 3D reconstruction dataset encompassing both dynamic and static\nscenes.

    "abstract": "Compared with natural images, remote sensing images (RSIs) have the unique\ncharacteristic. i.e., larger intraclass variance, which makes semantic\nsegmentation for remote sensing images more challenging. Moreover, existing\nsemantic segmentation models for remote sensing images usually employ a vanilla\nsoftmax classifier, which has three drawbacks: (1) non-direct supervision for\nthe pixel representations during training; (2) inadequate modeling ability of\nparametric softmax classifiers under large intraclass variance; and (3) opaque\nprocess of classification decision. In this paper, we propose a novel\nclassifier (called CenterSeg) customized for RSI semantic segmentation, which\nsolves the abovementioned problems with multiple prototypes, direct supervision\nunder Grassmann manifold, and interpretability strategy. Specifically, for each\nclass, our CenterSeg obtains local class centers by aggregating corresponding\npixel features based on ground-truth masks, and generates multiple prototypes\nthrough hard attention assignment and momentum updating. In addition, we\nintroduce the Grassmann manifold and constrain the joint embedding space of\npixel features and prototypes based on two additional regularization terms.\nEspecially, during the inference, CenterSeg can further provide\ninterpretability to the model by restricting the prototype as a sample of the\ntraining set. Experimental results on three remote sensing segmentation\ndatasets validate the effectiveness of the model. Besides the superior\nperformance, CenterSeg has the advantages of simplicity, lightweight,\ncompatibility, and interpretability. Code is available at\nhttps://github.com/xwmaxwma/rssegmentation.",

    "abstract": "Studies by microbiologists from the 1970s provided robust estimates for the\nenergy supply and demand of a prokaryotic cell. The amount of ATP needed to\nsupport growth was calculated from the chemical composition of the cell and\nknown enzymatic pathways that synthesize its constituents from known substrates\nin culture. Starting in 2015, geneticists and evolutionary biologists began\ninvestigating the bioenergetic role of mitochondria at eukaryote origin and\nenergy in metazoan evolution using their own, widely trusted but hitherto\nunvetted model for the costs of growth in terms of ATP per cell. The more\nrecent model contains, however, a severe and previously unrecognized error that\nsystematically overestimates the ATP cost of amino acid synthesis up to 200\nfold. The error applies to all organisms studied by such models and leads to\nconspicuously false inferences, for example that the synthesis of an average\namino acid in humans requires 30 ATP, which no biochemistry textbook will\nconfirm. Their ATP cost calculations would require that Escherichia coli\nobtains roughly 100 ATP per glucose and that mammals obtain roughly 240 ATP per\nglucose, propositions that invalidate evolutionary inferences so based. By\ncontrast, established methods for estimating the ATP cost of microbial growth\nshow that the first mitochondrial endosymbionts could have easily doubled the\nhosts available ATP pool, provided that genes for growth on environmental amino\nacids were transferred from the mitochondrial symbiont to the archaeal host and\nthat the host for mitochondrial origin was an autotroph using the acetyl-CoA\npathway.",

    "abstract": "Electron acoustic waves (EAWs) are nonlinear plasma modes characterized by\nelectron trapping, which suppresses the usual Landau damping. Despite being\npredicted in the 1990s, their excitation and decay mechanisms remain a subject\nof active research. This study investigates the nonlinear dynamics of EAWs,\nfocusing on their excitation, decay instability, and the role of vortex merging\nin phase space. Using Eulerian Vlasov-Poisson simulations, we reproduce the\nexcitation of stable EAWs via an external resonant driving force and explore\ntheir decay under the effect of a low-amplitude perturbation. The study\nidentifies a distinct 2 to 1 decay process, where an EAW with a shorter\nwavelength merges into a longer-wavelength mode, driven by vortex dynamics in\nphase space. We find that the instability is triggered by a small fraction of\nparticles capable of transitioning between potential wells, facilitating energy\nexchange between two adjacent phase space holes and vortex merging. Our\nsimulations highlight the chaotic nature of particle trajectories in the\nvicinity of the separatrix between trapped and free phase space regions, which\nsignificantly contributes to the instability growth. Additionally, we analyze\nthe influence of the perturbation amplitude on the growth rate of the\ninstability, shedding light on the critical role of phase-space dynamics in the\ndecay process. These findings offer a deeper understanding of the nonlinear\nbehavior of plasma waves and suggest future directions for studying plasma wave\nstability in more complex systems, as the decay mechanism discussed here is\nlikely to be universal in plasmas with closed separatrices in phase space,\nunderscoring its significance in nonlinear plasma dynamics.",

These measures\ntake explicitly into account the properties of multi-node interactions, using\ncomplementary approaches.

Our results highlight the\nadvantages of using higher-order dissimilarity measures over traditional\npairwise representations in capturing the full structural complexity of the\nsystems considered.",

In\neach stage, we align visual factors -- lip movements, face identity, and facial\nexpressions -- with corresponding acoustic counterparts to ensure the seamless\ntransformation.

    "abstract": "The Standard Model of particle physics-the theory of particles and\ninteractions at the smallest scale-predicts that matter and antimatter interact\ndifferently due to violation of the combined symmetry of charge conjugation\n($C$) and parity ($P$). Charge conjugation transforms particles into their\nantimatter particles, whereas the parity transformation inverts spatial\ncoordinates. This prediction applies to both mesons, which consist of a quark\nand an antiquark, and baryons, which are composed of three quarks. However,\ndespite having been discovered in various meson decays, $CP$ violation has yet\nto be observed in baryons, the type of matter that makes up the observable\nUniverse. Here we report a study of the decay of the beauty baryon\n$\\Lambda^{0}_{b}$ to the $p K^{-} \\pi^{+}\\pi^{-}$ final state and its\n$CP$-conjugated process, using data collected by the Large Hadron Collider\nbeauty experiment at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN). The\nresults reveal significant asymmetries between the decay rates of the\n$\\Lambda^{0}_{b}$ baryon and its $CP$-conjugated antibaryon, providing, to our\nknowledge, the first observation of $CP$ violation in baryon decays and\ndemonstrating the different behaviours of baryons and antibaryons. In the\nStandard Model, $CP$ violation arises from the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa\nmechanism, and new forces or particles beyond the Standard Model could provide\nadditional contributions. This discovery opens a new path in the search for\nphysics beyond the Standard Model.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning approaches are becoming increasingly attractive for equation\ndiscovery. We show the advantages and disadvantages of using neural-guided\nequation discovery by giving an overview of recent papers and the results of\nexperiments using our modular equation discovery system MGMT\n($\\textbf{M}$ulti-Task $\\textbf{G}$rammar-Guided $\\textbf{M}$onte-Carlo\n$\\textbf{T}$ree Search for Equation Discovery). The system uses neural-guided\nMonte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and supports both supervised and reinforcement\nlearning, with a search space defined by a context-free grammar. We summarize\nseven desirable properties of equation discovery systems, emphasizing the\nimportance of embedding tabular data sets for such learning approaches. Using\nthe modular structure of MGMT, we compare seven architectures (among them,\nRNNs, CNNs, and Transformers) for embedding tabular datasets on the auxiliary\ntask of contrastive learning for tabular data sets on an equation discovery\ntask. For almost all combinations of modules, supervised learning outperforms\nreinforcement learning. Moreover, our experiments indicate an advantage of\nusing grammar rules as action space instead of tokens. Two adaptations of MCTS\n-- risk-seeking MCTS and AmEx-MCTS -- can improve equation discovery with that\nkind of search.",

Stein from\nthe mid 1990s. Our work provides the first dimension-free estimates for full\ndiscrete maximal functions related to spheres and balls without relying on\ncomparisons with their continuous counterparts. An important part of our\nargument is a uniform (dimension-free) count of lattice points in\nhigh-dimensional spheres and balls with small radii. We also established a\ndimension-free estimate for a multi-parameter maximal function of a\ncombinatorial nature, which is a new phenomenon and may be useful for studying\nsimilar problems in the future.",

Pore scale propagation is shown to be\ndependent on throat width between cylinders, and this is then related to\nlarge-scale flame dynamics, allowing us to give a heuristic explanation for the\nincreased growth rate of the thermodiffusive instability in more confined\ngeometries. Thermoacoustic instabilities are also observed for sufficiently\nconfined geometries. Understanding these instability mechanisms is crucial for\nimproving the design of future combustors, both in terms of controlling flame\ndynamics and increasing the durability of combustors.",

    "abstract": "Stack-based memory corruption vulnerabilities have\n  long been exploited by attackers to execute arbitrary code\n  or perform unauthorized memory operations. Various defense\n  mechanisms have been introduced to mitigate stack memory\n  errors, but they typically focus on specific attack types, incur\n  substantial performance overhead, or suffer from compatibility\n  limitations.In this paper, we present CleanStack, an efficient,\n  highly compatible, and comprehensive stack protection mech anism. CleanStack\nisolates stack objects influenced by external\n  input from other safe stack objects, thereby preventing attackers\n  from modifying return addresses via controlled stack objects.\n  Additionally, by randomizing the placement of tainted stack\n  objects within the Unclean Stack, CleanStack mitigates non control data\nattacks by preventing attackers from predicting the\n  stack layout.A key component of CleanStack is the identifica tion of tainted\nstack objects. We analyze both static program\n  analysis and heuristic methods for this purpose. To maximize\n  compatibility, we adopt a heuristic approach and implement\n  CleanStack within the LLVM compiler framework, applying it to\n  SPEC CPU2017 benchmarks and a real-world application.Our\n  security evaluation demonstrates that CleanStack significantly\n  reduces the exploitability of stack-based memory errors by\n  providing a dual-stack system with isolation and randomization.\n  Performance evaluation results indicate that CleanStack incurs\n  an execution overhead of only 1.73% on the SPEC CPU2017\n  benchmark while introducing a minimal memory overhead of\n  just 0.04%. Compared to existing stack protection techniques,\n  CleanStack achieves an optimal balance between protection\n  coverage, runtime overhead, and compatibility, making it one\n  of the most comprehensive and efficient stack security solutions\n  to date.",

    "abstract": "In this study, a method for readily and inexpensively generating real-time\nreconfigurable intense midair ultrasound field is proposed. Recent\ninvestigations and applications of midair convergent high-power ultrasound have\nbeen increasingly growing. For generating such ultrasound fields, specifically\ndesigned ultrasound sources or phased arrays of ultrasound transducers are\nconventionally used. The former can be more readily fabricated but cannot\ndrastically reconfigure the generated ultrasound field, and the latter can\ncreate electronically controllable ultrasound fields but is much more difficult\nto implement and expensive. The proposed method utilizes a planar ultrasound\nsource with a fixed surface vibration pattern and a newly designed amplitude\nmask inspired by the Fresnel-zone-plate (FZP). The mask is designed so that\nwhen it is placed on a specific position on the source, the partially covered\nsource emission results in forming pre-determined ultrasound fields with\ncorresponding specific spatial pattern. With these new masks, the generated\nfields can be switched among several presets by changing the mask position on\nthe source. The proposed technique only requires slight mechanical translation\nof the mask over the source to instantaneously reconfigure the resulting midair\nultrasound field. The proposed method enables one to create a reconfigurable\nultrasound field with a large source aperture in a practically feasible setup,\nwhich will potentially broaden the workspace of current midair-ultrasound\napplications to the whole-room scale.",

The production of multi-instance 2D line art colorization\nadheres to an industry-standard workflow, which consists of three crucial\nstages: the design of line art characters, the coloring of individual objects,\nand the refinement process. The artists are required to repeat the process of\ncoloring each instance one by one, which is inaccurate and inefficient.\nMeanwhile, current generative methods fail to solve this task due to the\nchallenge of multi-instance pair data collection. To tackle these challenges,\nwe incorporate three technical designs to ensure precise character detail\ntranscription and achieve multi-instance sketch colorization in a single\nforward pass. Specifically, we first propose the self-play training strategy to\naddress the lack of training data. Then we introduce an instance guider to feed\nthe color of the instance. To achieve accurate color matching, we present\nfine-grained color matching with edge loss to enhance visual quality. Equipped\nwith the proposed modules, Follow-Your-Color enables automatically transforming\nsketches into vividly-colored images with accurate consistency and\nmulti-instance control. Experiments on our collected datasets show that our\nmodel outperforms existing methods regarding chromatic precision.

It is also well known\nthat 1D Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) measurements fail to accurately\ncapture elemental abundances. Non-LTE (NLTE) effects may play a significant\nrole, and neglecting them leads to erroneous implications in galaxy modelling.\nIn this paper, we calculate 3D NLTE abundances of seven key iron-peak and\nneutron-capture elements (Mn, Co, Ni, Sr, Y, Ba, Eu) based on carefully\nassembled 1D LTE literature measurements, and investigate their impact within\nthe context of the OMEGA+ GCE model.

We also observe a\nslightly higher production of neutron-capture elements at low metallicities,\nwith 3D NLTE abundances of Eu being higher by +0.2 dex at [Fe/H]= -3. 3D\neffects are most significant for iron-peak elements in the very metal-poor\nregime, with average differences between 3D NLTE and 1D NLTE {reaching} up to\n0.15 dex.

    "abstract": "Using the 3D density distribution derived from the 3D dust map of the solar\nneighborhood, the gravitational potential is obtained by solving the Poisson\nequation, from which the tidal tensor is computed. In the optimal\ndecomposition, the external tidal tensor follows the same formalism as that of\na point mass. The average tidal strength of the clouds, derived from both tidal\ntensor analysis and pixel-by-pixel computation, shows consistent results. The\nequivalent velocity dispersion of the clouds, estimated from the average tidal\nstrength, is comparable in magnitude to the velocity dispersion measured from\nCO (1-0) line emission. This suggests that tidal effects from surrounding\nmaterial may play a significant role in driving velocity dispersion within the\nclouds. Future studies should carefully consider these tidal effects in\nstar-forming regions.",

To address these limitations,\nwe propose TEMPLE (TEMporal Preference Learning), a systematic framework that\nenhances Video LLMs' temporal reasoning capabilities through Direct Preference\nOptimization (DPO). To facilitate this, we introduce an automated preference\ndata generation pipeline that systematically constructs preference pairs by\nselecting videos that are rich in temporal information, designing\nvideo-specific perturbation strategies, and finally evaluating model responses\non clean and perturbed video inputs.

Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that our approach consistently improves Video LLM performance\nacross multiple benchmarks with a relatively small set of self-generated DPO\ndata. We further analyze the transferability of DPO data across architectures\nand the role of difficulty scheduling in optimization.

Recent studies have shown that\nhigh-quality rendering can be achieved with a substantially reduced number of\nGaussians when represented with high-precision attributes. Nevertheless,\nexisting 3DGS compression methods still rely on a relatively large number of\nGaussians, focusing primarily on attribute compression. This is because a\nsmaller set of Gaussians becomes increasingly sensitive to lossy attribute\ncompression, leading to severe quality degradation. Since the number of\nGaussians is directly tied to computational costs, it is essential to reduce\nthe number of Gaussians effectively rather than only optimizing storage. In\nthis paper, we propose Optimized Minimal Gaussians representation (OMG), which\nsignificantly reduces storage while using a minimal number of primitives.\nFirst, we determine the distinct Gaussian from the near ones, minimizing\nredundancy without sacrificing quality. Second, we propose a compact and\nprecise attribute representation that efficiently captures both continuity and\nirregularity among primitives. Additionally, we propose a sub-vector\nquantization technique for improved irregularity representation, maintaining\nfast training with a negligible codebook size. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that OMG reduces storage requirements by nearly 50% compared to the\nprevious state-of-the-art and enables 600+ FPS rendering while maintaining high\nrendering quality.

Therein, the system shows a zero-resistance\nstate only when a sufficiently large current is applied in a particular\ndirection, while stays in an incipient superconducting state with small\nresistance when the current is small or in the opposite direction. In this\nLetter, we provide a theory for this phenomenon using a model that encapsulates\nvalley polarization and trigonal warping inherent to the trilayer\ngraphene/WSe$_2$ heterostructure. We elucidate that threefold-degenerate\nFulde-Ferrell (FF) states are stabilized, and establish the thermodynamic phase\ndiagram in electric current that manifests the switching behavior of different\nFF states. We thereby propose a scenario that predicts CIZRS in the presence of\ndomains of different FF states: The incipient superconducting state in small\ncurrent is naturally understood as a multi-domain state, wherein the\ninter-domain supercurrent is difficult to flow due to the tiny Josephson\ncoupling caused by the mismatch of Cooper-pair momenta. Nevertheless, a\nsufficiently large current in a particular direction can selectively populate a\ncertain FF state and create mono-domain pathways with zero resistance.\nCrucially, due to the threefold symmetry of the system, a current flowing in\nthe opposite direction fails to generate these zero-resistance pathways, thus\ngiving rise to the observed nonreciprocity.

To address this gap, we present RustEvo, a novel\nframework for constructing dynamic benchmarks that evaluate the ability of LLMs\nto adapt to evolving Rust APIs. RustEvo automates dataset creation by\nsynthesizing 588 API changes (380 from Rust standard libraries, 208 from 15\nthird-party crates) into programming tasks mirroring real-world challenges.\nThese tasks cover four API evolution categories: Stabilizations, Signature\nChanges, Behavioral Changes, and Deprecations, reflecting their actual\ndistribution in the Rust ecosystem.\n  Experiments on state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs reveal significant performance\nvariations: models achieve a 65.8% average success rate on stabilized APIs but\nonly 38.0% on behavioral changes, highlighting difficulties in detecting\nsemantic shifts without signature alterations. Knowledge cutoff dates strongly\ninfluence performance, with models scoring 56.1% on before-cutoff APIs versus\n32.5% on after-cutoff tasks. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates\nthis gap, improving success rates by 13.5% on average for APIs released after\nmodel training. Our findings underscore the necessity of our evolution-aware\nbenchmarks to advance the adaptability of LLMs in fast-paced software\necosystems. The framework and the benchmarks are publicly released at\nhttps://github.com/SYSUSELab/RustEvo.",

We investigate the\ncomplexities surrounding universal human preferences in image generation,\nhighlighting the subjective nature of these preferences and the challenges\nposed by minority samples in preference datasets. Through pilot experiments, we\ndemonstrate the existence of minority samples and their detrimental effects on\nmodel performance. We propose Adaptive-DPO -- a novel approach that\nincorporates a minority-instance-aware metric into the DPO objective. This\nmetric, which includes intra-annotator confidence and inter-annotator\nstability, distinguishes between majority and minority samples. We introduce an\nAdaptive-DPO loss function which improves the DPO loss in two ways: enhancing\nthe model's learning of majority labels while mitigating the negative impact of\nminority samples. Our experiments demonstrate that this method effectively\nhandles both synthetic minority data and real-world preference data, paving the\nway for more effective training methodologies in image generation tasks.",

The framework was conceptualized by\nsynthesizing evidence from the literature and by consulting with experts. The\ninitial version of the AI Explainability Framework was validated based on an\nin-depth expert engagement and review process. For evaluation purposes, an\nAI-anchored prototype, incorporating novel explainability features, was built\nand deployed online. The primary function of the prototype was to predict the\npostpartum depression risk using analytics models. The development of the\nprototype was carried out in an iterative fashion, based on a pilot-level\nformative evaluation, followed by refinements and summative evaluation. The\nSystem Explainability Scale (SES) metric was developed to measure the influence\nof the three dimensions of the AI Explainability Framework. For the summative\nstage, a comprehensive usability test was conducted involving 20 clinicians,\nand the SES metric was used to assess clinicians` satisfaction with the tool.\nOn a 5-point rating system, the tool received high scores for the usability\ndimension, followed by trust and understandability. The average explainability\nscore was 4.56. In terms of understandability, trust, and usability, the\naverage score was 4.51, 4.53 and 4.71 respectively. Overall, the 13-item SES\nmetric showed strong internal consistency with Cronbach`s alpha of 0.84 and a\npositive correlation coefficient (Spearman`s rho = 0.81, p<0.001) between the\ncomposite SES score and explainability.

    "abstract": "3D non-Cartesian trajectories offer several advantages over rectilinear\ntrajectories for rapid volumetric imaging, including improved sampling\nefficiency and greater robustness to motion, flow, and aliasing artifacts. In\nthis paper, we present a unified framework for designing three widely used\nnon-Cartesian trajectories: 3D Radial, 3D Cones, and Stack-of-Spirals. Our\napproach is based on the idea that a non-Cartesian trajectory can be\ninterpreted as a discretized version of an analytic coordinate defined by a set\nof template trajectories. Equivalently, the analytic coordinate is\nconceptualized as a non-Cartesian trajectory composed of an infinite number of\ncopies of a set of template trajectories. The discretization is accomplished by\nconstructing a continuous spiral path on a surface and sampling points along\nthis path at unit intervals, leaving only the essential spokes/interleaves,\nthereby yielding the practical non-Cartesian trajectory from the analytic\ncoordinate. One of the advantages of our approach is that the analytic density\ncompensation factor can be readily derived using Jacobian determinants, which\nquantify changes in unit areas due to the transformation from the analytic\ncoordinate to the Cartesian grid. Additionally, the proposed approach derives\nanalytic formulae to compute the number of readouts based on prescribed\nparameters, allowing us to specify the trajectory's acceleration factor for a\ngiven total scan time. Furthermore, variable-density sampling can be easily\nincorporated, and spokes/interleaves are smoothly distributed in k-space along\nthe derived spiral path, even for a small number of readouts. In a preliminary\nphantom study, the proposed method demonstrated improved sampling efficiency\nand image quality compared to the conventional approach.",

This presents a challenge for applications like autonomous driving and\nrobotics, which rely on limited computational resources. While existing channel\npruning methods can compress these models, reducing the number of channels\noften hinders the parallelization efficiency of GPU, due to the inefficient\nmultiplication between small matrices.

Our method achieves a\n25% reduction in computational overhead on two TAD benchmarks (THUMOS14 and\nActivityNet-1.3) to achieve lossless compression.

Analog phased\narray with narrow and adjustable receive beam is connected to each RF chain to\ncapture one signal path, where the angle of arrival (AoA) can be roughly\nestimated. Due to the carrier frequency offset between the transmitter and the\nBS, the Doppler frequency of each path could hardly be estimated accurately.\nInstead, the differences of Doppler frequencies of the three paths can be\nestimated with much better accuracy. Therefore, a trajectory tracking method\nbased on the Doppler difference and AoA estimations is proposed in mmTracking.\nExperimental results in a typical indoor environment demonstrate that the\naverage error of transmitter localization and trajectory tracking is less than\n20 cm.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we discuss the impact of a higher number of light quark\nflavors, $N_f$, on the QCD phase diagram under extreme conditions. Our\nformalism is based on the Schwinger-Dyson equation, employing a specific\nsymmetry-preserving vector-vector flavor-dressed contact interaction model of\nquarks in Landau gauge, utilizing the rainbow-Ladder truncation. We derive\nexpressions for the dressed quark mass $M_f$ and effective potential\n$\\Omega^{f}$ at zero, at finite temperature $T$ and the quark chemical\npotential $\\mu$. The transition between chiral symmetry breaking and\nrestoration is triggered by the effective potential of the contact interaction,\nwhereas the confinement and deconfinement transition is approximated from the\nconfinement length scale $\\tilde{\\tau}_{ir}$. Our analysis reveals that at $(T\n= \\mu = 0)$, increasing $N_f$ leads to the restoration of chiral symmetry and\nthe deconfinement of quarks when $N_f$ reaches its critical value, $N^{c}_{f}\n\\approx 8$. At this critical value, In the chiral limit ($m_f = 0$), the global\nminimum of the effective potential occurs at the point where the dressed quark\nmass approaches zero ($M_f \\rightarrow 0$). However, when a bare quark mass of\n$m_f = 7$ MeV is introduced, the global minimum shifts slightly to a nonzero\nvalue, approaching $M_f \\rightarrow m_f$. At finite $T$ and $\\mu$, we\nillustrate the QCD phase diagram in the $(T^{\\chi,C}_{c} -\\mu)$ plane, for\nvarious numbers of light quark flavors, noting that both the critical\ntemperature $T_c$ and the critical chemical potential $\\mu_c $ for chiral\nsymmetry restoration and deconfinement decrease as $ N_f $ increases. Moreover,\nthe critical endpoint $(T_{EP}, \\mu_{EP})$ also shifts to lower values with\nincreasing $N_f $. Our findings are consistent with other low-energy QCD\napproaches.",

Naive solutions may not work well because\nthe running time for a model to complete a set of requests depends on the\nrequest workload and the selected parallelism strategy, and they lack an\naccurate model of the running time. As the LLM output lengths are unknown\nbefore running, to estimate the model running time, we propose a\nsampling-then-simulation method which first estimates the output lengths by\nsampling from an empirical cumulative function we obtained from a large dataset\nin advance, and then simulates the LLM inference process accordingly. Based on\nthe simulation, we estimate the per-iteration latencys to get the total\nlatency. A greedy method is proposed to optimize the scheduling of the LLMs in\nthe application across the GPUs. We then propose a framework SamuLLM which\ncontains two phases: planning, which calls the greedy method for an application\nand running, which runs the application and dynamically adjust the model\nscheduling based on the runtime information. Experiments on 3 applications and\na mixed application show that SamuLLM can achieve 1.0-2.4$\\times$ end-to-end\nspeedups compared to the competitors.",

In this article, an experimental method to\nmonitor the viscosity of polymer materials at high and varying temperatures by\nusing ultrasound is proposed. This method allows us to measure the ultrasonic\nand rheological properties of a sample, simultaneously and in real-time. An\nultrasonic instrumentation is adapted to a rheometer for continuous monitoring.\nIt allows high-temperature range measurements (up to 200{\\deg}C). A dedicated\nsignal processing algorithm is developed to determine the polymer longitudinal\nacoustic velocity by considering wave packet overlapping and temperature\nvariation.

    "abstract": "A new continuous model of shearable rod, subject to large elastic\ndeformation, is derived from nonlinear homogenization of a one-dimensional\nperiodic microstructured chain. As particular cases, the governing equations\nreduce to the Euler elastica and to the shearable elastica known as 'Engesser',\nthat has been scarcely analysed so far. The microstructure that is homogenized\nis made up of elastic hinges and four-bar linkages, which may be realized in\npractice using origami joints. The equivalent continuous rod is governed by a\nDifferential-Algebraic system of nonlinear Equations (DAE), containing an\ninternal length ratio, and showing a surprisingly rich mechanical landscape,\nwhich involves a twin sequence of bifurcation loads, separated by a\n'transition' mode. The latter occurs, for simply supported and cantilever rods\nin a 'bookshelf-like' mode and in a mode involving faulting (formation of a\nstep in displacement), respectively. The postcritical response of the simply\nsupported rod exhibits the emergence of folding, an infinite curvature\noccurring at a point of the rod axis, developing into a curvature jump at\nincreasing load. Faulting and folding, excluded for both Euler and Reissner\nmodels and so far unknown in the rod theory, represent 'signatures' revealing\nthe origami design of the microstructure. These two features are shown to be\nassociated with bifurcations and, in particular folding, with a secondary\nbifurcation of the corresponding discrete chain when the number of elements is\nodd. Beside the intrinsic theoretical relevance to the field of structural\nmechanics, our results can be applied to various technological contexts\ninvolving highly compliant mechanisms, such as the achievement of objective\ntrajectories with soft robot arms through folding and localized displacement of\norigami-inspired or multi-material mechanisms.",

To determine the most\nappropriate model for the continuum of this outburst, we employed three models\nto explore the evolution of the spectral component. These observations revealed\nthat the source transitions from the hard state to the soft state. The\ndisk-corona and sphere-corona models both adequately described the spectra of\nthe hard state, while the double blackbody model became preferable after the\nhard X-ray emission ($>$25 keV) disappeared during the state transition. In the\nsoft state, the total emission is dominated by changes in the disk and other\nblackbody components. The combination of the sphere-corona model and the double\nblackbody model is the most suitable model for this outburst. The results\nsuggest that as the source transitioned into the soft state, the emission from\nthe boundary layer was enhanced, and a hot spot occurred. Notably, we\nidentified two type-I X-ray bursts, one of which exhibited a significant hard\nX-ray deficit (significance $\\sim$ 4.82 $\\sigma$), which indicates that\n\\textit{Insight-HXMT} has the capability to capture the evolution of the corona\nin a single burst.",

Conventional cross-domain CTR (CCTR)\nmethods frequently assume homogeneous feature spaces and rely on centralized\ndata sharing, neglecting complex inter-domain discrepancies and the subtle\ntrade-offs imposed by privacy-preserving protocols. Here, we present Federated\nCross-Domain CTR Prediction with Large Language Model Augmentation\n(FedCCTR-LM), a federated framework engineered to address these limitations by\nsynchronizing data augmentation, representation disentanglement, and adaptive\nprivacy protection. Our approach integrates three core innovations. First, the\nPrivacy-Preserving Augmentation Network (PrivAugNet) employs large language\nmodels to enrich user and item representations and expand interaction\nsequences, mitigating data sparsity and feature incompleteness. Second, the\nIndependent Domain-Specific Transformer with Contrastive Learning (IDST-CL)\nmodule disentangles domain-specific and shared user preferences, employing\nintra-domain representation alignment (IDRA) and crossdomain representation\ndisentanglement (CDRD) to refine the learned embeddings and enhance knowledge\ntransfer across domains. Finally, the Adaptive Local Differential Privacy\n(AdaLDP) mechanism dynamically calibrates noise injection to achieve an optimal\nbalance between rigorous privacy guarantees and predictive accuracy. Empirical\nevaluations on four real-world datasets demonstrate that FedCCTR-LM\nsubstantially outperforms existing baselines, offering robust,\nprivacy-preserving, and generalizable cross-domain CTR prediction in\nheterogeneous, federated environments.",

Besides, the diffusion term is\nallowed to be degenerate, unbounded and even nonlinear in the distribution, but\nit does not depend on the control. First, we establish the global\nwell-posedness of the corresponding forward-backward stochastic differential\nequations (FBSDEs), which arise from the maximum principle under a so-called\n$\\beta$-monotonicity commonly used in the optimal control theory. The\n$\\beta$-monotonicity admits more interesting cases, as representative examples\nincluding but not limited to the displacement monotonicity, the small mean\nfield effect condition or the Lasry-Lions monotonicity; and ensures the\nwell-posedness result in diverse non-convex examples. In our settings, we pose\nassumptions directly on the drift and diffusion coefficients and the cost\nfunctionals, rather than indirectly on the Hamiltonian, to make the conditions\nmore visible. Our probabilistic method tackles the nonlinear dynamics with a\nlinear but infinite dimensional version, and together with our recently\nproposed cone property for the adjoint processes, following in an almost\nstraightforward way the conventional approach to the classical stochastic\ncontrol problem, we derive a sufficiently good regularity of the value\nfunctional, and finally show that it is the unique classical solution to the\nMFG master equation. Our results require fairly few conditions on the\nfunctional coefficients for solution of the MFG, and a bit more conditions --\nwhich are least stringent in the contemporary literature -- for classical\nsolution of the MFG master equation.",

    "abstract": "There is a candidate electromagnetic (EM) counterpart to the binary black\nhole merger GW190521, identified as ZTF19abanrhr within active galactic nuclei\n(AGN) J124942.3 + 344929. Additionally, GW190514 is proposed as a plausible\nprecursor merger to GW190521 within a hierarchical merger scenario. In this\nstudy, we investigate the potential association between GW190514 and GW190521\nas a hierarchical triple merger associated with ZTF19abanrhr, taking into\naccount of the sky position, distance, and mass of the sources using a Bayesian\ncriterion. Our analysis reveals that the association is favored over a random\ncoincidence, with a log Bayes factor of 16.8, corresponding to an odds ratio of\n$\\sim$$199:1$, assuming an astrophysical prior odds of $10^{-5}$. Notably, when\naccounting for the primary masses of the two gravitational-wave events as\npotential products of mergers in the AGN formation channel, the Bayes factor\nincreases significantly, further enhancing the preference for this association\nby a factor of $\\sim$$10^2$, corresponding to a log Bayes factor of 21.5 and an\nodds ratio of $\\sim$$2\\times10^4:1$. Our results suggest strong evidence for\nthe first hierarchical triple merger associated with an EM counterpart in the\nAGN formation channel. This work is crucial for understanding the formation\nmechanisms of massive black holes, the role of AGNs in hierarchical mergers,\nand the implications of multimessenger astronomy.",

To this end, we propose\nCity2Scene, a novel framework that leverages city features to improve ASC.\nUnlike conventional approaches that may discard or suppress city information,\nCity2Scene transfers the city-specific knowledge from pre-trained city\nclassification models to scene classification model using knowledge\ndistillation. We evaluate City2Scene on three datasets of DCASE Challenge Task\n1, which include both scene and city labels. Experimental results demonstrate\nthat city features provide valuable information for classifying scenes.

Tiny microcontrollers, such as\nthe Raspberry Pi Pico, are key targets for on-device learning but often lack\nfloating-point units, necessitating integer-only training. Dynamic computation\nof quantization scale factors, which is adopted in former studies, incurs high\ncomputational costs. Therefore, this study focuses on integer-only training\nwith static scale factors, which is challenging with existing training methods.\nWe propose a new training method named PRIOT, which optimizes the network by\npruning selected edges rather than updating weights, allowing effective\ntraining with static scale factors. The pruning pattern is determined by the\nedge-popup algorithm, which trains a parameter named score assigned to each\nedge instead of the original parameters and prunes the edges with low scores\nbefore inference. Additionally, we introduce a memory-efficient variant,\nPRIOT-S, which only assigns scores to a small fraction of edges. We implement\nPRIOT and PRIOT-S on the Raspberry Pi Pico and evaluate their accuracy and\ncomputational costs using a tiny CNN model on the rotated MNIST dataset and the\nVGG11 model on the rotated CIFAR-10 dataset.

While\nmultimodal learning has gained traction, existing multimodal time-series\ndatasets fall short in evaluating cross-modal reasoning and complex question\nanswering, which are essential for capturing complex interactions between\nnarrative information and temporal patterns. To bridge this gap, we introduce\nMultimodal Time Series Benchmark (MTBench), a large-scale benchmark designed to\nevaluate large language models (LLMs) on time series and text understanding\nacross financial and weather domains. MTbench comprises paired time series and\ntextual data, including financial news with corresponding stock price movements\nand weather reports aligned with historical temperature records. Unlike\nexisting benchmarks that focus on isolated modalities, MTbench provides a\ncomprehensive testbed for models to jointly reason over structured numerical\ntrends and unstructured textual narratives. The richness of MTbench enables\nformulation of diverse tasks that require a deep understanding of both text and\ntime-series data, including time-series forecasting, semantic and technical\ntrend analysis, and news-driven question answering (QA). These tasks target the\nmodel's ability to capture temporal dependencies, extract key insights from\ntextual context, and integrate cross-modal information. We evaluate\nstate-of-the-art LLMs on MTbench, analyzing their effectiveness in modeling the\ncomplex relationships between news narratives and temporal patterns.

The network architecture is composed of several stages that process\nspatial and temporal relationships sequentially, ensuring effective feature\nextraction. After making the fully connected layer, the embedding vector is\nprocessed by the Spatial Multi-Head Attention Transformer, which captures\nspatial dependencies between joints. In the next stage, the Temporal Multi-Head\nAttention Transformer captures long-range temporal dependencies, and again, the\nfeatures are concatenated with the output using another skip connection. The\nprocessed features are then passed to the Feed-Forward Network (FFN), which\nrefines the feature representations further. After the FFN, additional skip\nconnections are applied to combine the output with earlier layers, followed by\na final normalization layer to produce the final output feature tensor. This\nprocess is repeated for 10 transformer blocks. The extensive experiment shows\nthat the JSL, KSL and ASL datasets achieved good performance accuracy.

To address this\nissue, domain generalization methods have been developed to learn\ndomain-invariant features from single or multiple training domains, enabling\ngeneralization to unseen testing domains. However, existing approaches usually\noverlook the impact of style frequency within the training set. This oversight\npredisposes models to capture spurious visual correlations caused by style\nconfounding factors, rather than learning truly causal representations, thereby\nundermining inference reliability. In this work, we introduce Style\nDeconfounding Causal Learning (SDCL), a novel causal inference-based framework\ndesigned to explicitly address style as a confounding factor. Our approaches\nbegins with constructing a structural causal model (SCM) tailored to the domain\ngeneralization problem and applies a backdoor adjustment strategy to account\nfor style influence. Building on this foundation, we design a style-guided\nexpert module (SGEM) to adaptively clusters style distributions during\ntraining, capturing the global confounding style. Additionally, a back-door\ncausal learning module (BDCL) performs causal interventions during feature\nextraction, ensuring fair integration of global confounding styles into sample\npredictions, effectively reducing style bias. The SDCL framework is highly\nversatile and can be seamlessly integrated with state-of-the-art data\naugmentation techniques.

Conducting such attacks\nduring the early stages of network communication is particularly critical for\nscenarios demanding rapid decision-making, such as cybercrime detection or\nfinancial fraud prevention. Although recent studies have made progress in flow\ncorrelation attacks techniques, research specifically addressing flow\ncorrelation with early network traffic flow remains limited. Moreover, due to\nfactors such as model complexity, training costs, and real-time requirements,\nexisting technologies cannot be directly applied to flow correlation with early\nnetwork traffic flow. In this paper, we propose flow correlation attack with\nearly network traffic, named Early-MFC, based on multi-view triplet networks.\nThe proposed approach extracts multi-view traffic features from the payload at\nthe transport layer and the Inter-Packet Delay. It then integrates multi-view\nflow information, converting the extracted features into shared embeddings. By\nleveraging techniques such as metric learning and contrastive learning, the\nmethod optimizes the embeddings space by ensuring that similar flows are mapped\ncloser together while dissimilar flows are positioned farther apart. Finally,\nBayesian decision theory is applied to determine flow correlation, enabling\nhigh-accuracy flow correlation with early network traffic flow.

    "abstract": "This paper presents a new algorithmic fairness framework called\n$\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}$-$\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$ Fair Machine Learning\n($\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}$-$\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$ FML), designed to optimize fairness\nlevels across sociodemographic attributes. Our framework employs a new family\nof surrogate loss functions, paired with loss reweighting techniques, allowing\nprecise control over fairness-accuracy trade-offs through tunable\nhyperparameters $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}$ and $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$. To efficiently\nsolve the learning objective, we propose Parallel Stochastic Gradient Descent\nwith Surrogate Loss (P-SGD-S) and establish convergence guarantees for both\nconvex and nonconvex loss functions. Experimental results demonstrate that our\nframework improves overall accuracy while reducing fairness violations,\noffering a smooth trade-off between standard empirical risk minimization and\nstrict minimax fairness. Results across multiple datasets confirm its\nadaptability, ensuring fairness improvements without excessive performance\ndegradation.",

    "abstract": "Large-scale text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have revolutionized image\ngeneration, enabling the synthesis of highly detailed visuals from textual\ndescriptions. However, these models may inadvertently generate inappropriate\ncontent, such as copyrighted works or offensive images. While existing methods\nattempt to eliminate specific unwanted concepts, they often fail to ensure\ncomplete removal, allowing the concept to reappear in subtle forms. For\ninstance, a model may successfully avoid generating images in Van Gogh's style\nwhen explicitly prompted with 'Van Gogh', yet still reproduce his signature\nartwork when given the prompt 'Starry Night'. In this paper, we propose SAFER,\na novel and efficient approach for thoroughly removing target concepts from\ndiffusion models. At a high level, SAFER is inspired by the observed\nlow-dimensional structure of the text embedding space. The method first\nidentifies a concept-specific subspace $S_c$ associated with the target concept\nc. It then projects the prompt embeddings onto the complementary subspace of\n$S_c$, effectively erasing the concept from the generated images. Since\nconcepts can be abstract and difficult to fully capture using natural language\nalone, we employ textual inversion to learn an optimized embedding of the\ntarget concept from a reference image. This enables more precise subspace\nestimation and enhances removal performance. Furthermore, we introduce a\nsubspace expansion strategy to ensure comprehensive and robust concept erasure.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that SAFER consistently and effectively\nerases unwanted concepts from diffusion models while preserving generation\nquality.",

The existing general-purpose routing protocols for ad hoc\nnetworks often oversimplify mobility patterns and disregard the unequal\nimportance of nodes, resulting in suboptimal routing decisions that are\nunsuitable for task-oriented FANETs. To break the bottleneck, in this paper we\npropose a betweenness centrality based dynamic source routing (BC-DSR) protocol\nfor a flying ad hoc network (FANET) in marching formation. Firstly, we\nintroduce a Gauss-Markov group (GMG) mobility model based on the\nleader-follower pattern, which accurately captures the temporal and spatial\ncorrelations of node movements in the realistic marching formation. Besides, we\nexploit the concept of BC defined in graph theory to measure the structural\nunequal importance of relay nodes, i.e., to determine link weights, in the\nparticular marching formation topology. The path of least cost is calculated\nrelying on a weighted directed graph constructed. The ns-3 based simulation\nresults demonstrate that our BCDSR protocol achieves higher packet-delivery\nratio and lower average end-to-end latency and routing overhead ratio than\nrepresentative benchmark protocols used in FANETs, while maintaining a\nreasonably small network jitter.",

Considering\ntime-varying DT evolutions and heterogeneities among partial-DTs, we formulate\nan online problem that jointly and dynamically optimizes partial-DT assignments\nfrom the cloud to ESs, ES-sensor associations for partial-DT creation, and as\nwell as computation and communication resource allocations for global-DT\nintegration.

Specifically, we first propose skeleton-aware node-controlled\ndeformation, which deforms a canonical 3D Gaussian representation over time to\ninitialize the modeling process, producing candidate skeleton nodes that are\nfurther simplified into a sparse 3D skeleton according to their motion and\nsemantic information. Subsequently, based on the resulting skeleton, we design\nlearnable skin deformations and pose-dependent detailed deformations, thereby\neasily deforming the 3D Gaussian representation to generate new actions and\nrender further high-quality images from novel views. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that our method can generate realistic new actions easily for\nobjects and achieve high-quality rendering.",

To address these drawbacks,\nwe propose a new communication scheduling scheme DeFT, whose key insight is to\nmitigate data dependencies and support flexible scheduling in distributed\ntraining.

    "abstract": "Nonprehensile manipulation is crucial for handling objects that are too thin,\nlarge, or otherwise ungraspable in unstructured environments. While\nconventional planning-based approaches struggle with complex contact modeling,\nlearning-based methods have recently emerged as a promising alternative.\nHowever, existing learning-based approaches face two major limitations: they\nheavily rely on multi-view cameras and precise pose tracking, and they fail to\ngeneralize across varying physical conditions, such as changes in object mass\nand table friction. To address these challenges, we propose the\nDynamics-Adaptive World Action Model (DyWA), a novel framework that enhances\naction learning by jointly predicting future states while adapting to dynamics\nvariations based on historical trajectories. By unifying the modeling of\ngeometry, state, physics, and robot actions, DyWA enables more robust policy\nlearning under partial observability. Compared to baselines, our method\nimproves the success rate by 31.5% using only single-view point cloud\nobservations in the simulation. Furthermore, DyWA achieves an average success\nrate of 68% in real-world experiments, demonstrating its ability to generalize\nacross diverse object geometries, adapt to varying table friction, and\nrobustness in challenging scenarios such as half-filled water bottles and\nslippery surfaces.",

    "abstract": "Applying imitation learning (IL) is challenging to nonprehensile manipulation\ntasks of invisible objects with partial observations, such as excavating buried\nrocks. The demonstrator must make such complex action decisions as exploring to\nfind the object and task-oriented actions to complete the task while estimating\nits hidden state, perhaps causing inconsistent action demonstration and high\ncognitive load problems. For these problems, work in human cognitive science\nsuggests that promoting the use of pre-designed, simple exploration rules for\nthe demonstrator may alleviate the problems of action inconsistency and high\ncognitive load. Therefore, when performing imitation learning from\ndemonstrations using such exploration rules, it is important to accurately\nimitate not only the demonstrator's task-oriented behavior but also his/her\nmode-switching behavior (exploratory or task-oriented behavior) under partial\nobservation. Based on the above considerations, this paper proposes a novel\nimitation learning framework called Belief Exploration-Action Cloning (BEAC),\nwhich has a switching policy structure between a pre-designed exploration\npolicy and a task-oriented action policy trained on the estimated belief states\nbased on past history. In simulation and real robot experiments, we confirmed\nthat our proposed method achieved the best task performance, higher mode and\naction prediction accuracies, while reducing the cognitive load in the\ndemonstration indicated by a user study.",

By\nincreasing the temperature at a finite velocity $v$ to traverse the critical\npoint from the ordered phase, we uncover rich dynamic scaling properties beyond\nthe celebrated Kibble-Zurek mechanism.

Through a design\nprobe (n=22), participants generated diagrams averaging 21.82 hypotheses. Our\nfindings showed that the node-link diagram acts as \"guardrails\" for hypothesis\nexploration, facilitating structured workflows, providing comprehensive\noverviews, and enabling efficient backtracking. The AI-generated information\nhints, particularly visualizations, aided users in transforming abstract ideas\ninto data-backed concepts while reducing cognitive load. We further discuss how\nnode-link diagrams can support both parallel exploration and iterative\nrefinement in hypothesis formulation, potentially enhancing the breadth and\ndepth of human-AI collaborative data analysis.",

    "abstract": "Human-LLM conversations are increasingly becoming more pervasive in peoples'\nprofessional and personal lives, yet many users still struggle to elicit\nhelpful responses from LLM Chatbots. One of the reasons for this issue is\nusers' lack of understanding in crafting effective prompts that accurately\nconvey their information needs. Meanwhile, the existence of real-world\nconversational datasets on the one hand, and the text understanding faculties\nof LLMs on the other, present a unique opportunity to study this problem, and\nits potential solutions at scale. Thus, in this paper we present the first\nLLM-centric study of real human-AI chatbot conversations, focused on\ninvestigating aspects in which user queries fall short of expressing\ninformation needs, and the potential of using LLMs to rewrite suboptimal user\nprompts. Our findings demonstrate that rephrasing ineffective prompts can\nelicit better responses from a conversational system, while preserving the\nuser's original intent. Notably, the performance of rewrites improves in longer\nconversations, where contextual inferences about user needs can be made more\naccurately. Additionally, we observe that LLMs often need to -- and inherently\ndo -- make \\emph{plausible} assumptions about a user's intentions and goals\nwhen interpreting prompts. Our findings largely hold true across conversational\ndomains, user intents, and LLMs of varying sizes and families, indicating the\npromise of using prompt rewriting as a solution for better human-AI\ninteractions.",

This paper presents the first empirical study on\nthe effectiveness of reasoning-enabled VLMs in mobile GUI agents, a domain that\nrequires interpreting complex screen layouts, understanding user instructions,\nand executing multi-turn interactions. We evaluate two pairs of commercial\nmodels--Gemini 2.0 Flash and Claude 3.7 Sonnet--comparing their base and\nreasoning-enhanced versions across two static benchmarks (ScreenSpot and\nAndroidControl) and one interactive environment (AndroidWorld). We surprisingly\nfind the Claude 3.7 Sonnet reasoning model achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance on AndroidWorld. However, reasoning VLMs generally offer marginal\nimprovements over non-reasoning models on static benchmarks and even degrade\nperformance in some agent setups.

Among these, the integrated thin-film\nlithium niobate (TFLN) photonic platform shows particular promise owing to\nlithium niobate's transparency into the UV range, its strong second order\nnonlinearity, and high optical confinement.

The proposed network can be trained\nefficiently as one can directly specify ICBCs without imposing losses,\ncalculate physics-informed loss functions through analytical formulas, and\nrequires only learning the weights of B-spline functions as opposed to both\nweights and basis as in traditional neural operator learning methods. We\nprovide theoretical guarantees that the proposed B-spline networks serve as\nuniversal approximators for the set of solutions of PDEs with varying ICBCs\nunder mild conditions and establish bounds on the generalization errors in\nphysics-informed learning. We also demonstrate in experiments that the proposed\nB-spline network can solve problems with discontinuous ICBCs and outperforms\nexisting methods, and is able to learn solutions of 3D dynamics with diverse\ninitial conditions.",

    "abstract": "Debugging of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), particularly vision models, is very\nchallenging due to the complex and opaque decision-making processes in these\nnetworks. In this paper, we explore multi-modal Vision-Language Models (VLMs),\nsuch as CLIP, to automatically interpret the opaque representation space of\nvision models using natural language. This in turn, enables a semantic analysis\nof model behavior using human-understandable concepts, without requiring costly\nhuman annotations. Key to our approach is the notion of semantic heatmap, that\nsuccinctly captures the statistical properties of DNNs in terms of the concepts\ndiscovered with the VLM and that are computed off-line using a held-out data\nset. We show the utility of semantic heatmaps for fault localization -- an\nessential step in debugging -- in vision models. Our proposed technique helps\nlocalize the fault in the network (encoder vs head) and also highlights the\nresponsible high-level concepts, by leveraging novel differential heatmaps,\nwhich summarize the semantic differences between the correct and incorrect\nbehaviour of the analyzed DNN. We further propose a lightweight runtime\nanalysis to detect and filter-out defects at runtime, thus improving the\nreliability of the analyzed DNNs. The runtime analysis works by measuring and\ncomparing the similarity between the heatmap computed for a new (unseen) input\nand the heatmaps computed a-priori for correct vs incorrect DNN behavior. We\nconsider two types of defects: misclassifications and vulnerabilities to\nadversarial attacks. We demonstrate the debugging and runtime analysis on a\ncase study involving a complex ResNet-based classifier trained on the RIVAL10\ndataset.",

In the Eckart frame, the complex SFDM\nis effectively an imperfect fluid with a dissipative energy flux,\ndistinguishing itself from axion dark matter. The energy flux can affect the\ngrowth of density fluctuations dynamically. Meanwhile, we apply the stiff gauge\ncondition to find new constitutive equations for the complex SFDM.

    "abstract": "Noncontacting and nondestructive control of geometric phase in conventional\nsemiconductors plays a pivotal role in various applications. In the current\nwork, we present a theoretical and computational investigation on terahertz\n(THz) light-induced phase transformation of conventional binary semiconducting\ncompounds among different structures including rock-salt, zinc-blende,\nwurtzite, and hexagonal phases. Using MgS and MgSe as prototypical examples, we\nperform anharmonic phonon mediated calculations and reveal large contrasting\nlattice contributed dielectric susceptibility in the THz regime. We then\nconstruct a THz-induced phase diagram under intermediate temperature and reveal\nrock-salt to hexagonal and then wurtzite structure transformations with\nincreasing light intensity. This does not require a high temperature\nenvironment as observed in traditional experiments. The low energy barrier\nsuggests that the phase transition kinetics can be fast, and the stable room\ntemperature phonon dispersions guarantee their non-volatile nature.\nFurthermore, we disclose the phononic hyperbolicity with strong anisotropic THz\nsusceptibility components, which serves as a natural hyperbolic material with\nnegative refractive index. Our work suggests the potential to realize\nmetastable hidden phases using noninvasive THz irradiation, which expands the\nconventional pressure-temperature ($P-T$) phase diagram by adding light as an\nadditional control factor.",

In the current work, we present a\nfirst-principles density functional theory calculation on the orbital magnetic\nmoments, intrinsic orbital Hall effect, and ordinary magnetoconductivity\neffects in rhombohedral graphene multilayers. Our calculations suggest a giant\norbital moment that arises from inter-atomic cycloid motion, reaching over 30\nmuB under an intermediate gate voltage. This leads to a valley polarization\nunder an external magnetic field, as observed in recent experiments [Nature\n623, 41-47 (2023)]. In addition, the orbital-related transport feature exhibit\nsignificant responses that are potentially observed in experiments. We also\nsuggest that under a periodic field driven (such as high frequency light\nfield), the ungated graphene multilayers could host strong quantum anomalous\nand orbital Hall effects, engineered by the layer number. As the graphene\nmultilayers are intrinsically nonmagnetic with negligible spin-orbit coupling,\nthe orbital moments would not be entangled by spin-related signals. Thus, they\nserve as an ideal platform to conduct orbitronic measurements and utilization\nfor next generation information read/write nanodevices.",

Many recent computer vision architectures consist of\nsequences of isotropic blocks that disentangle the spatial and channel-mixing\ncomponents. This separation of the operations allows us to more closely\njuxtapose the effects of spatial and channel mixing in deep learning. In this\npaper, we take an initial step towards garnering a deeper understanding of the\nroles of these mixing operations. Through our experiments and analysis, we\ndiscover that on both classical (ResNet) and cutting-edge (ConvMixer) models,\nwe can reach nearly the same level of classification performance by and leaving\nthe spatial mixers at their random initializations. Furthermore, we show that\nmodels with random, fixed spatial mixing are naturally more robust to\nadversarial perturbations.

Traditional approaches often rely\non Critical Flicker Frequency (CFF), primarily suited for high-contrast\n(full-on, full-off) flicker. To tackle varying contrast flicker, the\nInternational Committee for Display Metrology (ICDM) introduced a Temporal\nContrast Sensitivity Function TCSF$_{IDMS}$ within the Information Display\nMeasurements Standard (IDMS). Nevertheless, this standard overlooks crucial\nparameters: luminance, eccentricity, and area. Existing models incorporating\nthese parameters are inadequate for flicker detection, especially at low\nspatial frequencies. To address these limitations, we extend the TCSF$_{IDMS}$\nand combine it with a new spatial probability summation model to incorporate\nthe effects of luminance, eccentricity, and area (elaTCSF). We train the\nelaTCSF on various flicker detection datasets and establish the first variable\nrefresh rate flicker detection dataset for further verification. Additionally,\nwe contribute to resolving a longstanding debate on whether the flicker is more\nvisible in peripheral vision. We demonstrate how elaTCSF can be used to predict\nflicker due to low-persistence in VR headsets, identify flicker-free VRR\noperational ranges, and determine flicker sensitivity in lighting design.",

The flux and\nspectrum of antineutrinos emitted by a reactor can indicate its activity and\ncomposition, suggesting potential applications of neutrino measurements beyond\nfundamental scientific studies that may be valuable to society. The utility of\nreactor antineutrinos for applications and fundamental science is dependent on\nthe availability of precise predictions of these emissions. For example, in the\nlast decade, disagreements between reactor antineutrino measurements and models\nhave inspired revision of reactor antineutrino calculations and standard\nnuclear databases as well as searches for new fundamental particles not\npredicted by the Standard Model of particle physics. Past predictions and\ndescriptions of the methods used to generate them are documented to varying\ndegrees in the literature, with different modeling teams incorporating a range\nof methods, input data, and assumptions. The resulting difficulty in accessing\nor reproducing past models and reconciling results from differing approaches\ncomplicates the future study and application of reactor antineutrinos. The\nCONFLUX (Calculation Of Neutrino FLUX) software framework is a neutrino\nprediction tool built with the goal of simplifying, standardizing, and\ndemocratizing the process of reactor antineutrino flux calculations. CONFLUX\ninclude three primary methods for calculating the antineutrino emissions of\nnuclear reactors or individual beta decays that incorporate common nuclear data\nand beta decay theory. The software is prepackaged with the current nuclear\ndatabase. It includes the capability to predict time-dependent neutrino model,\nadjust decay information entries, and propagate uncertainties.

    "abstract": "We investigate the nonlinear stability of compressible vortex sheet solutions\nfor three-dimensional (3D) isentropic elastic flows. Building upon previous\nresults on the weakly linear stability of elastic vortex sheets [19], we\nperform a detailed study of the roots of the Lopatinskii determinant and\nidentify a geometric stability condition associated with the deformation\ngradient. We employ an upper triangularization technique that isolates the\noutgoing modes into a closed system, where they appear only at the leading\norder. This enables us to derive energy estimates despite derivative loss. The\nmajor novelty of our approach includes the following two key aspects: (1) For\nthe 3D compressible Euler vortex sheets, the front symbol exhibits degenerate\nellipticity in certain frequency directions, which makes it challenging to\nensure the front's regularity using standard energy estimates. Our analysis\nreveals that the non-parallel structure of the deformation gradient tensor\nplays a crucial role in recovering ellipticity in the front symbol, thereby\nenhancing the regularity of the free interface. (2) Another significant\nchallenge in 3D arises from the strong degeneracy caused by the collision of\nrepeated roots and poles. Unlike in 2D, where such interactions are absent, we\nencounter a co-dimension one set in frequency space where a double root\ncoincides with a double pole. To resolve this, we refine Coulombel's\ndiagonalization framework [21] and construct a suitable transformation that\nreduces the degeneracy order of the Lopatinskii matrix, enabling the use of\nlocalized Garding-type estimates to control the characteristic components.\nFinally, we employ a Nash-Moser iteration scheme to establish the local\nexistence and nonlinear stability of vortex sheets under small initial\nperturbations, showing stability within a subsonic regime.",
