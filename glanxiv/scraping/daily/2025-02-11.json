    "abstract": "While functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) offers valuable insights\ninto brain activity, it is limited by high operational costs and significant\ninfrastructural demands. In contrast, electroencephalography (EEG) provides\nmillisecond-level precision in capturing electrical activity but lacks the\nspatial fidelity necessary for precise neural localization. To bridge these\ngaps, we propose E2fNet, a simple yet effective deep learning model for\nsynthesizing fMRI images from low-cost EEG data. E2fNet is an encoder-decoder\nnetwork specifically designed to capture and translate meaningful multi-scale\nfeatures from EEG across electrode channels into accurate fMRI representations.\nExtensive evaluations across three public datasets demonstrate that E2fNet\nconsistently outperforms existing CNN- and transformer-based methods, achieving\nstate-of-the-art results in terms of the structural similarity index measure\n(SSIM). These results demonstrate that E2fNet is a promising, cost-effective\nsolution for enhancing neuroimaging capabilities. The code is available at\nhttps://github.com/kgr20/E2fNet.",

Several recent works explore\nthe benefits of pre-trained initialization in a federated learning (FL)\nsetting, where the downstream training is performed at the edge clients with\nheterogeneous data distribution. These works show that starting from a\npre-trained model can substantially reduce the adverse impact of data\nheterogeneity on the test performance of a model trained in a federated\nsetting, with no changes to the standard FedAvg training algorithm. In this\nwork, we provide a deeper theoretical understanding of this phenomenon. To do\nso, we study the class of two-layer convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and\nprovide bounds on the training error convergence and test error of such a\nnetwork trained with FedAvg. We introduce the notion of aligned and misaligned\nfilters at initialization and show that the data heterogeneity only affects\nlearning on misaligned filters. Starting with a pre-trained model typically\nresults in fewer misaligned filters at initialization, thus producing a lower\ntest error even when the model is trained in a federated setting with data\nheterogeneity. Experiments in synthetic settings and practical FL training on\nCNNs verify our theoretical findings.",

Because\nco-construction and sharing can achieve broader coverage with lower investment,\nthrough percolation theory, we investigate how different sharing strategies can\ndeliver large-scale continuous services. First, we examine the percolation\ncharacteristics in signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) coverage\ngraphs and the necessary conditions for percolation.

    "abstract": "Studying quantum field theories through geometric principles has revealed\ndeep connections between physics and mathematics, including the discovery by\nCachazo, Early, Guevara and Mizera (CEGM) of a generalization of biadjoint\nscalar amplitudes. However, extending this to generalizations of other quantum\nfield theories remains a central challenge. Recently it has been discovered\nthat the nonlinear sigma model (NLSM) emerges after a certain zero-preserving\ndeformation from $\\text{tr}(\\phi^3)$. In this work, we find a much richer story\nof zero-preserving deformations in the CEGM context, yielding generalized NLSM\namplitudes. We prove an explicit formula for the residual embedding of an\n$n$-point NLSM amplitude in a mixed $n+2$ point generalized NLSM amplitude,\nwhich provides a strong consistency check on our generalization. We show that\nthe dimension of the space of pure kinematic deformations is $\\gcd(k,n)-1$, we\nintroduce a deformation-compatible modification of the Global Schwinger\nParameterization, and we include a new proof, using methods from matroidal\nblade arrangements, of the linear independence for the set of planar kinematic\ninvariants for CEGM amplitudes. Our framework is compatible with string theory\nthrough recent generalizations of the Koba-Nielsen string integral to any\npositive configuration space $X^+(k,n)$, where the usual Koba-Nielsen string\nintegral corresponds to $X(2,n) = \\mathcal{M}_{0,n}$.",

Many existing methods tackle these issues by heavily relying on\ntext-based negative prompts or extensively retraining DMs to eliminate certain\nfeatures or samples. In this paper, we take a radically different approach,\ndirectly modifying the sampling trajectory by leveraging a negation set (e.g.,\nunsafe images, copyrighted data, or datapoints needed to be excluded) to avoid\nspecific regions of data distribution, without needing to retrain or fine-tune\nDMs. We formally derive the relationship between the expected denoised samples\nthat are safe and those that are not safe, leading to our $\\textit{safe}$\ndenoiser which ensures its final samples are away from the area to be negated.\nInspired by the derivation, we develop a practical algorithm that successfully\nproduces high-quality samples while avoiding negation areas of the data\ndistribution in text-conditional, class-conditional, and unconditional image\ngeneration scenarios. These results hint at the great potential of our\ntraining-free safe denoiser for using DMs more safely.",

Analogous to the cellular networks concept, shared\nenergy stations (ESs) are foreseen to supply energy-as-a-service (EaaS) in\norder to recharge devices that belong to different IoE operators who are\noffering diverse use cases. Considering the capital expenditure (CAPEX) for ES\ndeployment along with their finite wireless energy transfer (WET) zones,\nspatial energy gaps are plausible. Furthermore, the ESs deployment cannot cover\n100% of the energy-harvesting devices of all coexisting IoE use cases. In this\ncontext, we utilize percolation theory to characterize the feasibility of\nlarge-scale device-to-device (D2D) connectivity of IoE networks operating under\nEaaS platforms. Assuming that ESs and IoE devices follow independent Poisson\npoint processes (PPPs), we construct a connectivity graph for the IoE devices\nthat are within the WET zones of ESs. Continuum percolation on the construct\ngraph is utilized to derive necessary and sufficient conditions for large-scale\nRF-powered D2D connectivity in terms of the required IoE device density and\ncommunication range along with the required ESs density and WET zone size.\nFixing the IoE network parameters along with the size of WET zones, we obtain\nthe approximate critical value of the ES density that ensures large-scale\nconnectivity using the inner-city and Gilbert disk models.

This\nhas greatly thwart the adoption of FL methods for training robust AI models in\nsensitive applications. Differential Privacy (DP) is considered the gold\nstandard for safeguarding user data. However, DP guarantees are highly\nconservative, providing worst-case privacy guarantees. This can result in\noverestimating privacy needs, which may compromise the model's accuracy.\nAdditionally, interpretations of these privacy guarantees have proven to be\nchallenging in different contexts. This is further exacerbated when other\nfactors, such as the number of training iterations, data distribution, and\nspecific application requirements, can add further complexity to this problem.\nIn this work, we proposed a framework that integrates a human entity as a\nprivacy practitioner to determine an optimal trade-off between the model's\nprivacy and utility. Our framework is the first to address the variable memory\nrequirement of existing DP methods in FL settings, where resource-limited\ndevices (e.g., cell phones) can participate. To support such settings, we adopt\na recent DP method with fixed memory usage to ensure scalable private FL.

    "abstract": "Stability is a central property in learning and statistics promising the\noutput of an algorithm $A$ does not change substantially when applied to\nsimilar datasets $S$ and $S'$. It is an elementary fact that any sufficiently\nstable algorithm (e.g.\\ one returning the same result with high probability,\nsatisfying privacy guarantees, etc.) must be randomized. This raises a natural\nquestion: can we quantify how much randomness is needed for algorithmic\nstability?\n  We study the randomness complexity of two influential notions of stability in\nlearning: replicability, which promises $A$ usually outputs the same result\nwhen run over samples from the same distribution (and shared random coins), and\ndifferential privacy, which promises the output distribution of $A$ remains\nsimilar under neighboring datasets. The randomness complexity of these notions\nwas studied recently in (Dixon et al. ICML 2024) and (Cannone et al. ITCS 2024)\nfor basic $d$-dimensional tasks (e.g. estimating the bias of $d$ coins), but\nlittle is known about the measures more generally or in complex settings like\nclassification.\n  Toward this end, we prove a `weak-to-strong' boosting theorem for stability:\nthe randomness complexity of a task $M$ (either under replicability or DP) is\ntightly controlled by the best replication probability of any deterministic\nalgorithm solving the task, a weak measure called `global stability' that is\nuniversally capped at $\\frac{1}{2}$ (Chase et al. FOCS 2023). Using this, we\ncharacterize the randomness complexity of PAC Learning: a class has bounded\nrandomness complexity iff it has finite Littlestone dimension, and moreover\nscales at worst logarithmically in the excess error of the learner. This\nresolves a question of (Chase et al. STOC 2024) who asked for such a\ncharacterization in the equivalent language of (error-dependent)\n`list-replicability'.",

In\nthis work, we show that these two seemingly separate families can actually be\nunified by looking at posterior guidance as a greedy strategy of end-to-end\nguidance. We explore the theoretical connections between these two families and\nprovide an in-depth theoretical of these two techniques relative to the\ncontinuous ideal gradients. Motivated by this analysis we then show a method\nfor interpolating between these two families enabling a trade-off between\ncompute and accuracy of the guidance gradients.

    "abstract": "We study a novel heterogeneous multi-agent multi-armed bandit problem with a\ncluster structure induced by stochastic block models, influencing not only\ngraph topology, but also reward heterogeneity. Specifically, agents are\ndistributed on random graphs based on stochastic block models - a generalized\nErdos-Renyi model with heterogeneous edge probabilities: agents are grouped\ninto clusters (known or unknown); edge probabilities for agents within the same\ncluster differ from those across clusters. In addition, the cluster structure\nin stochastic block model also determines our heterogeneous rewards. Rewards\ndistributions of the same arm vary across agents in different clusters but\nremain consistent within a cluster, unifying homogeneous and heterogeneous\nsettings and varying degree of heterogeneity, and rewards are independent\nsamples from these distributions. The objective is to minimize system-wide\nregret across all agents. To address this, we propose a novel algorithm\napplicable to both known and unknown cluster settings. The algorithm combines\nan averaging-based consensus approach with a newly introduced information\naggregation and weighting technique, resulting in a UCB-type strategy. It\naccounts for graph randomness, leverages both intra-cluster (homogeneous) and\ninter-cluster (heterogeneous) information from rewards and graphs, and\nincorporates cluster detection for unknown cluster settings. We derive optimal\ninstance-dependent regret upper bounds of order $\\log{T}$ under sub-Gaussian\nrewards. Importantly, our regret bounds capture the degree of heterogeneity in\nthe system (an additional layer of complexity), exhibit smaller constants,\nscale better for large systems, and impose significantly relaxed assumptions on\nedge probabilities.

Aim: To develop an\ninnovative pulse-mode DSCF (PM-DSCF) system for continuous monitoring of CBF\nvariations in adult humans.

Measurements of the mass of Kepler-10c in the\nliterature have shown disagreement, depending on the radial-velocity dataset\nand/or the modeling technique used. Here we report on the analysis of almost\n300 high-precision radial velocities gathered with the HARPS-N spectrograph at\nthe Telescopio Nazionale Galileo over $\\sim11$~years, and extracted with the\nYARARA-v2 tool, which corrects for possible systematics and/or low-level\nactivity variations at the spectrum level. To model these radial velocities, we\nused three different noise models and various numerical techniques, which all\nconverged to the solution: $M_{\\rm p, b}=3.24 \\pm 0.32~\\rm M_\\oplus$\n(10$\\sigma$) and $\\rho_{\\rm p, b}=5.54 \\pm 0.64~\\rm g\\;cm^{-3}$ for planet b;\n$M_{\\rm p, c}=11.29 \\pm 1.24~\\rm M_\\oplus$ (9$\\sigma$) and $\\rho_{\\rm p,\nc}=4.75 \\pm 0.53~\\rm g\\;cm^{-3}$ for planet c; and $M_{\\rm p, d}\\sin{i}=12.00\n\\pm 2.15~\\rm M_\\oplus$ (6$\\sigma$) and $P=151.06 \\pm 0.48$ d for the\nnon-transiting planet Kepler-10d. This solution is further supported by the\nanalysis of the Kepler-10c transit timing variations and their simultaneous\nmodeling with the HARPS-N radial velocities.

Our\nmodel utilizes the Transformer's attention mechanism to dynamically aggregate\nneighborhood information while preserving the semantic richness provided by LLM\nembeddings. Experimental results demonstrate that the LLM-enhanced node\nfeatures significantly improve the performance of graph learning models on node\nclassification tasks. This approach shows promising results across multiple\ngraph learning tasks, offering a practical direction for combining graph\nnetworks with language models.",

Although digital pathology has been advancing cancer\ndiagnosis and prognosis, the paradigm in cancer pathology has shifted from\npurely relying on histology features to incorporating molecular markers. There\nis an urgent need for digital pathology methods to meet the needs of the new\nparadigm. We introduce a novel digital pathology approach to jointly predict\nmolecular markers and histology features and model their interactions for\ncancer classification. Firstly, to mitigate the challenge of\ncross-magnification information propagation, we propose a multi-scale\ndisentangling module, enabling the extraction of multi-scale features from\nhigh-magnification (cellular-level) to low-magnification (tissue-level) whole\nslide images. Further, based on the multi-scale features, we propose an\nattention-based hierarchical multi-task multi-instance learning framework to\nsimultaneously predict histology and molecular markers. Moreover, we propose a\nco-occurrence probability-based label correlation graph network to model the\nco-occurrence of molecular markers. Lastly, we design a cross-modal interaction\nmodule with the dynamic confidence constrain loss and a cross-modal gradient\nmodulation strategy, to model the interactions of histology and molecular\nmarkers. Our experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms other\nstate-of-the-art methods in classifying glioma, histology features and\nmolecular markers. Our method promises to promote precise oncology with the\npotential to advance biomedical research and clinical applications. The code is\navailable at https://github.com/LHY1007/M3C2",

We make threefold progress on the problem of\ncharacterizing attractors. First, we show through a topological construction\nthat the one-to-one conjecture is false.

Compared to i.i.d. data like images, the OOD generalization\nproblem on graph-structured data remains challenging due to the non-i.i.d.\nproperty and complex structural information on graphs. Recently, several works\non graph OOD generalization have explored extracting invariant subgraphs that\nshare crucial classification information across different distributions.\nNevertheless, such a strategy could be suboptimal for entirely capturing the\ninvariant information, as the extraction of discrete structures could\npotentially lead to the loss of invariant information or the involvement of\nspurious information. In this paper, we propose an innovative framework, named\nGenerative Risk Minimization (GRM), designed to generate an invariant subgraph\nfor each input graph to be classified, instead of extraction. To address the\nchallenge of optimization in the absence of optimal invariant subgraphs (i.e.,\nground truths), we derive a tractable form of the proposed GRM objective by\nintroducing a latent causal variable, and its effectiveness is validated by our\ntheoretical analysis. We further conduct extensive experiments across a variety\nof real-world graph datasets for both node-level and graph-level OOD\ngeneralization, and the results demonstrate the superiority of our framework\nGRM.",

For instance, polar and\nprotic solvents can interact strongly with solutes and may interfere in\nreactions. However, to define and identify representative arrangements of\nsolvent molecules modulating a transition state is a non-trivial task. Here, we\npropose to monitor their active participation in the decaying normal mode at a\ntransition state, which defines active solvent molecules. Moreover, it is\ndesirable to prepare a low-dimensional microsolvation model in a well-defined,\nfully automated, high-throughput, and easy-to-deploy fashion, which we propose\nto derive in a stepwise protocol. First, transition state structures are\noptimized in a sufficiently solvated quantum-classical hybrid model, which are\nthen subjected to a re-definition of a then reduced quantum region. From the\nreduced model, minimally microsolvated structures are extracted that contain\nonly active solvent molecules. Modeling the remaining solvation effects is\ndeferred to a continuum model. To establish an easy-to-use free-energy model,\nwe combine the standard thermochemical gas-phase model with a correction for\nthe cavity entropy in solution. We assess our microsolvation and free-energy\nmodels for methanediol formation from formaldehyde, for the hydration of carbon\ndioxide (which we consider in a solvent mixture to demonstrate the versatility\nof our approach), and, finally, for the chlorination of phenol with\nhypochlorous acid.",

However actor systems must still deal with the challenge of\nmessages arriving in unexpected orderings.\n  We describe an approach to restricting the orders in which actors send\nmessages to each other, by equipping actor references -- the handle used to\naddress another actor -- with a protocol restricting which message types can be\nsent to another actor and in which order using that particular actor reference.\nThis endows the actor references with the properties of static (flow-sensitive)\ncapabilities, which we call actor capabilities.\n  By sending other actors only restricted actor references, they may control\nwhich messages are sent in which orders by other actors. Rules for duplicating\n(splitting) actor references ensure that these restrictions apply even in the\npresence of delegation. The capabilities themselves restrict message ordering,\nwhich may form the foundation for stronger forms of reasoning. We demonstrate\nthis by layering an effect system over the base type system, where the\nrelationships enforced between the actor capabilities and the effects of an\nactor's behaviour ensure that an actor's behaviour is always prepared to handle\nany message that may arrive.",

In this work, we present\nthe largest comprehensive analysis to-date of how the upstream pre-training\nfactors and downstream performance of CLIP models relate to their intrinsic\nbiases. Studying 131 unique CLIP models, trained on 26 datasets, using 55\narchitectures, and in a variety of sizes, we evaluate bias in each model using\n26 well-established unimodal and cross-modal principled Embedding Association\nTests. We find that the choice of pre-training dataset is the most significant\nupstream predictor of bias, whereas architectural variations have minimal\nimpact. Additionally, datasets curated using sophisticated filtering techniques\naimed at enhancing downstream model performance tend to be associated with\nhigher levels of intrinsic bias. Finally, we observe that intrinsic bias is\noften significantly correlated with downstream performance ($0.3 \\leq r \\leq\n0.8$), suggesting that models optimized for performance inadvertently learn to\namplify representational biases.

On the other hand,\nhackathons have attracted increasing attention due to their experiential,\ncollaborative, and intensive nature, which certain tasks could be similar to\nreal-world software development. This paper aims to discuss the idea of\nhackathons as an educational strategy for shaping SE students' soft skills in\npractice. Initially, we overview the existing literature on soft skills and\nhackathons in SE education. Then, we report preliminary empirical evidence from\na seven-day hybrid hackathon involving 40 students. We assess how the hackathon\nexperience promoted innovative and creative thinking, collaboration and\nteamwork, and knowledge application among participants through a structured\nquestionnaire designed to evaluate students' self-awareness. Lastly, our\nfindings and new directions are analyzed through the lens of Self-Determination\nTheory, which offers a psychological lens to understand human behavior. This\npaper contributes to academia by advocating the potential of hackathons in SE\neducation and proposing concrete plans for future research within SDT.

To\naddress these limitations, we introduce the ultimate years of schooling (UYS)-a\nbirth cohort-based metric targeting the final educational attainment of any\nindividual cohort, including those with ongoing schooling trajectories. As with\nmany attainment indicators, we propose to estimate UYS with cross-sectional\nhousehold surveys. However, for younger cohorts, estimation fails, because\nthese individuals are right-censored leading to severe downwards bias. To\ncorrect for this, we propose to re-frame educational attainment as a\ntime-to-event process and deploy discrete-time survival models that explicitly\naccount for censoring in the observations. At the national level, we estimate\nthe parameters of the model using survey-weighted logistic regression, while\nfor finer spatial resolutions, where sample sizes are smaller, we embed the\ndiscrete-time survival model within a Bayesian spatiotemporal framework to\nimprove stability and precision. Applying our proposed methods to data from the\n2022 Tanzania Demographic and Health Surveys, we estimate female educational\ntrajectories corrected for censoring biases, and reveal substantial subnational\ndisparities. By providing a dynamic, bias-corrected, and spatially\ndisaggregated measure, our approach enhances education monitoring; it equips\npolicymakers and researchers with a more precise tool for monitoring current\nprogress towards education goals, and for designing future targeted policy\ninterventions in LMICs.",

Existing approaches\ntypically rely on large LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o) to explore web environments and\ngenerate trajectory data, which is then used either for demonstration retrieval\n(for large LLMs) or to distill small LLMs (e.g., Llama3) in a process that\nremains decoupled from the exploration. In this paper, we propose\nAgentSymbiotic, an iterative framework that couples data synthesis with\ntask-performance, yielding a \"symbiotic improvement\" for both large and small\nLLMs. Our study uncovers a complementary dynamic between LLM types: while large\nLLMs excel at generating high-quality trajectories for distillation, the\ndistilled small LLMs-owing to their distinct reasoning capabilities-often\nchoose actions that diverge from those of their larger counterparts. This\ndivergence drives the exploration of novel trajectories, thereby enriching the\nsynthesized data. However, we also observe that the performance of small LLMs\nbecomes a bottleneck in this iterative enhancement process. To address this, we\npropose two innovations in LLM distillation: a speculative data synthesis\nstrategy that mitigates off-policy bias, and a multi-task learning approach\ndesigned to boost the reasoning capabilities of the student LLM. Furthermore,\nwe introduce a Hybrid Mode for Privacy Preservation to address user privacy\nconcerns. Evaluated on the WEBARENA benchmark, AgentSymbiotic achieves SOTA\nperformance with both LLM types.

While preemption is optimal in some\nscenarios, its effectiveness in multi-sensor correlated systems remains an open\nquestion. To address this, we introduce a probabilistic preemption policy,\nwhere the source sensor preemption decision is stochastic. We derive\nclosed-form expressions for the AoI and frame its optimization as a sum of\nlinear ratios problem, a well-known NP-hard problem. To navigate this\ncomplexity, we establish an upper bound on the iterations using a\nbranch-and-bound algorithm by leveraging a reformulation of the problem. This\nanalysis reveals linear scalability with the number of processes and a\nlogarithmic dependency on the reciprocal of the error that shows the optimal\nsolution can be efficiently found. Building on these findings, we show how\ndifferent correlation matrices can lead to distinct optimal preemption\nstrategies.

The\nconnected minimization problem, finding the minimum number $k$ such that a\ngraph can be decomposed into $k$ locally irregular graphs, is known to be\nNP-hard in general (Baudon, Bensmail, and Sopena, 2015). This naturally raises\ninterest in the study of related problems. Among others, the concept of local\nirregularity was defined for digraphs in several different ways. In this paper\nwe present the following new methods of defining a locally irregular digraph.\nThe first one, weak local irregularity, is based on distinguishing adjacent\nvertices by indegree-outdegree pairs, and the second one, strong local\nirregularity, asks for different balanced degrees (i.e., difference between the\noutdegree and the indegree of a vertex) of adjacent vertices. For both of these\nirregularities, we define locally irregular decompositions and colorings of\ndigraphs. We discuss relation of these concept to others, which were studied\npreviously, and provide related conjectures on the minimum number of colors in\nweak and strong locally irregular colorings.

The BCG+ICL mass\nfraction weakly anticorrelates with $M_{200}$, but strongly correlates with the\nconcentration, $c_{200}$, the assembly redshift, $z_{50}$, and the mass gap\nbetween the most massive and the fourth more massive member, $\\Delta M_{\\rm\n\\ast, 4th}$. We explore different aperture radii to nominally separate the ICL\nfrom the BCG and calculate ICL fractions. For $r_{\\rm{ap}}=2r_{\\rm half}$,\nwhere $r_{\\rm half}$ is the radius containing half the BCG+ICL mass, the ICL\nfraction is nearly independent of $M_{200}$, $c_{200}$, and $z_{50}$ with\nvalues $M_{\\ast,\\rm ICL}/(M_{\\ast,\\rm ICL}+M_{\\ast,\\rm BCG})= 0.33\\pm0.03$.\nIncluding the stellar mass of the satellites, the fraction $M_{\\ast,\\rm\nICL}/(M_{\\ast,\\rm ICL}+M_{\\ast,\\rm BCG}+M_{\\rm \\ast,sat})$ weakly\nanticorrelates with $M_{200}$ and strongly correlates with $c_{200}$, $z_{50}$,\nand $\\Delta M_{\\rm \\ast, 4th}$, suggesting that in more concentrated/earlier\nassembled/more relaxed clusters more stellar mass is lost from the satellites\n(by tidal stripping, and mergers) in favour of the ICL and BCG. Indeed, we find\nthat ex-situ stars dominate both in the BCG and ICL masses, with mergers\ncontributing more to the BCG, while tidal stripping contributes more to the\nICL. We find that the difference between the projected and 3D ICL fractions are\nonly a few per cent and suggest using $2r_{\\rm half}$ to separate the ICL from\nthe BCG in observed clusters.",

In the classical setting, the seller withholds disclosure to avoid\nmisappropriation, leading to inefficiency.

    "abstract": "Stochastic reaction networks (SRNs) model stochastic effects for various\napplications, including intracellular chemical or biological processes and\nepidemiology. A typical challenge in practical problems modeled by SRNs is that\nonly a few state variables can be dynamically observed. Given the measurement\ntrajectories, one can estimate the conditional probability distribution of\nunobserved (hidden) state variables by solving a stochastic filtering problem.\nIn this setting, the conditional distribution evolves over time according to an\nextensive or potentially infinite-dimensional system of coupled ordinary\ndifferential equations with jumps, known as the filtering equation. The current\nnumerical filtering techniques, such as the Filtered Finite State Projection\n(D'Ambrosio et al., 2022), are hindered by the curse of dimensionality,\nsignificantly affecting their computational performance. To address these\nlimitations, we propose to use a dimensionality reduction technique based on\nthe Markovian projection (MP), initially introduced for forward problems (Ben\nHammouda et al., 2024). In this work, we explore how to adapt the existing MP\napproach to the filtering problem and introduce a novel version of the MP, the\nFiltered MP, that guarantees the consistency of the resulting estimator. The\nnovel method employs a reduced-variance particle filter for estimating the jump\nintensities of the projected model and solves the filtering equations in a\nlow-dimensional space. The analysis and empirical results highlight the\nsuperior computational efficiency of projection methods compared to the\nexisting filtered finite state projection in the large dimensional setting.",

LSIM comprises three components:\nreinforcement learning predicts a structured fact-rule chain for each question,\na trainable Deep Structured Semantic Model (DSSM) retrieves the most relevant\ncandidate questions by integrating semantic and logical features, and\nin-context learning generates the final answer using the retrieved content. Our\nexperiments on a real-world legal QA dataset-validated through both automated\nmetrics and human evaluation-demonstrate that LSIM significantly enhances\naccuracy and reliability compared to existing methods.",

In the case of complex and multiscale systems, to\nachieve enhanced practical applicability, response theory should be\ninterpretable, capable of focusing on relevant timescales, and amenable to\ndata-driven and equation-agnostic implementations. Along these lines, in the\nspirit of Markov state modelling, we present linear and nonlinear response\nformulas for Markov chains. We obtain simple and easily implementable\nexpressions that can be used to predict the response of observables as well as\nof higher-order correlations. The methodology proposed here can be implemented\nin a purely data-driven setting and even if the underlying evolution equations\nare unknown. The use of algebraic expansions inspired by Koopmanism allows to\nelucidate the role of different time scales and modes of variability, and to\nfind explicit and interpretable expressions for the Green's functions at all\norders. This is a major advantage of the framework proposed here. We illustrate\nour methodology in a very simple yet instructive metastable system.

    "abstract": "This thesis contains a series of independent contributions to statistics,\nunified by a model-free perspective. The first chapter elaborates on how a\nmodel-free perspective can be used to formulate flexible methods that leverage\nprediction techniques from machine learning. Mathematical insights are obtained\nfrom concrete examples, and these insights are generalized to principles that\npermeate the rest of the thesis. The second chapter studies the concept of\nlocal independence, which describes whether the evolution of one stochastic\nprocess is directly influenced by another. To test local independence, we\ndefine a model-free parameter called the Local Covariance Measure (LCM). We\nformulate an estimator for the LCM, from which a test of local independence is\nproposed. We discuss how the size and power of the proposed test can be\ncontrolled uniformly and investigate the test in a simulation study. The third\nchapter focuses on covariate adjustment, a method used to estimate the effect\nof a treatment by accounting for observed confounding. We formulate a general\nframework that facilitates adjustment for any subset of covariate information.\nWe identify the optimal covariate information for adjustment and, based on\nthis, introduce the Debiased Outcome-adapted Propensity Estimator (DOPE) for\nefficient estimation of treatment effects. An instance of DOPE is implemented\nusing neural networks, and we demonstrate its performance on simulated and real\ndata. The fourth and final chapter introduces a model-free measure of the\nconditional association between an exposure and a time-to-event, which we call\nthe Aalen Covariance Measure (ACM). We develop a model-free estimation method\nand show that it is doubly robust, ensuring $\\sqrt{n}$-consistency provided\nthat the nuisance functions can be estimated with modest rates. A simulation\nstudy demonstrates the use of our estimator in several settings.",

In monolayer graphene, the use of electron-donating metal layers has\nrecently emerged as a method to dope the chemical potential to the nearest vHS,\nas evidenced by Angle-Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements.\nIn this work, we study the spatial uniformity of the doping from this process\nusing spectroscopic imaging scanning tunneling microscopy (SI-STM). Using\nmolecular beam epitaxy (MBE), we achieve electron doping of graphene on SiC\nusing Ytterbium (Yb-Graphene). We show using in-situ ARPES that the chemical\npotential is shifted to within 250 meV of the vHS. Using in-situ SI-STM, we\nestablish that there exists significant inhomogeneity in the vHS position in\noverdoped graphene. We find two separate reasons for this. First, the spatial\ninhomogeneity of the intercalated Yb leads to local variations in the doping,\nwith a length scale of inhomogeneity set by the screening length of ~ 3 nm.\nSecond, we observe the presence of substitutional Yb dopants in the graphene\nbasal plane. These Yb dopants cause a strong local shift of the doping, along\nwith a renormalization of the quasiparticle amplitude. Theoretical calculations\nconfirm that the Yb impurities effectively change the local potential, thus\nenergetically shifting the position of the van Hove singularity. Our results\npoint to the importance of considering the spatial structure of doping and its\ninextricable link to electronic structure.",

    "abstract": "The polarization of the $\\Lambda$ and $\\overline{\\Lambda}$ hyperons along the\nbeam direction has been measured in proton-lead (pPb) collisions at a\ncenter-of-mass energy per nucleon pair of 8.16 TeV. The data were obtained with\nthe CMS detector at the LHC and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 186.0\n$\\pm$ 6.5 nb$^{-1}$. A significant azimuthal dependence of the hyperon\npolarization, characterized by the second-order Fourier sine coefficient\n$P_{z,s2}$, is observed. The $P_{z,s2}$ values decrease as a function of\ncharged particle multiplicity, but increase with transverse momentum. A\nhydrodynamic model that describes the observed $P_{z,s2}$ values in\nnucleus-nucleus collisions by introducing vorticity effects does not reproduce\neither the sign or the magnitude of the pPb results. These observations pose a\nchallenge to the current theoretical implementation of spin polarization in\nheavy ion collisions and offer new insights into the origin of spin\npolarization in hadronic collisions at LHC energies.",

    "abstract": "The effect of a negative sectoral shock on GDP depends on how important the\nshocked sector is as a direct and indirect supplier and how easily sectors can\nsubstitute inputs. Past estimates of the parameters that determine these\nqualities in the US have been restrictive: they have not been allowed to vary\nacross industries or across time. This paper uses a novel empirical strategy to\nproduce new estimates of these parameters without these restrictions, by\nexploiting variation in input expenditure shares within industries rather than\nacross industries. The resulting estimates exhibit significant sectoral and\ntemporal heterogeneity. In a calibrated GE model of multi-sector production,\nthis heterogeneity (1) raises(lowers) the GDP effect of negative shocks to\nsectors whose customers are less(more) able to substitute inputs (e.g. the GDP\neffect of a \"Chemical products\" shock rises by 15%), and (2) raises(lowers) the\nGDP effect of negative shocks to sectors as they become more[less] central\ninput suppliers (e.g. between 1997 and 2023 the GDP effect of a shock to the\n\"Data processing, internet publishing, and other information services\" sector\nnearly tripled due to changes in its importance as an input supplier).",

By leveraging two-photon\nstabilization, they achieve an exponentially suppressed bit-flip error rate as\nthe distance in phase-space between their basis states increases, incurring\nonly a linear increase in phase-flip rate. This property substantially reduces\nthe number of qubits required for fault-tolerant quantum computation. Here, we\nimplement a squeezing deformation of the cat qubit basis states, further\nextending the bit-flip time while minimally affecting the phase-flip rate. We\ndemonstrate a steep reduction in the bit-flip error rate with increasing mean\nphoton number, characterized by a scaling exponent $\\gamma=4.3$, rising by a\nfactor of 74 per added photon. Specifically, we measure bit-flip times of 22\nseconds for a phase-flip time of 1.3 $\\mu$s in a squeezed cat qubit with an\naverage photon number $\\bar{n}=4.1$, a 160-fold improvement in bit-flip time\ncompared to a standard cat.

We here consider the problem of determining the partial\norder of equivalence classes of causal structures with latent variables\nrelative to observational dominance. We provide a complete characterization of\nthe dominance order in the case of three visible variables, and a partial\ncharacterization in the case of four visible variables. Our techniques also\nhelp to identify which observational equivalence classes have a set of\nrealizable distributions that is characterized by nontrivial inequality\nconstraints, analogous to Bell inequalities and instrumental inequalities. We\nfind evidence that as one increases the number of visible variables, the\nequivalence classes satisfying nontrivial inequality constraints become\nubiquitous. (Because such classes are the ones for which there can be a\ndifference in the distributions that are quantumly and classically realizable,\nthis implies that the potential for quantum-classical gaps is also ubiquitous.)\nFurthermore, we find evidence that constraint-based causal discovery algorithms\nthat rely solely on conditional independence constraints have a significantly\nweaker distinguishing power among observational equivalence classes than\nalgorithms that go beyond these (i.e., algorithms that also leverage nested\nMarkov constraints and inequality constraints).",

    "abstract": "The standard cosmological model, rooted in General Relativity (GR), has\nachieved remarkable success, yet it still faces unresolved issues like the\nnature of dark matter, dark energy, and the Hubble tension. These challenges\nmight imply the need for alternative gravitational theories. Teleparallel\ngravity offers a compelling framework by reformulating the gravitational\ninteraction using torsion, rather than curvature, as its fundamental\ngeometrical property. This paper delves into $f(T)$ gravity, an extension of\nthe Teleparallel Equivalent of General Relativity (TEGR), which introduces\nnon-linear modifications of the torsion scalar $T$. We focus on the role of\nspacetime-dependent Lorentz transformations in the vierbein formalism,\nexamining their impact on both background solutions and perturbation dynamics.\nSpecial attention is given to the homogeneous and isotropic FLRW spacetime, as\nwell as the anisotropic Bianchi I spacetime. Furthermore, the analysis of the\npropagating degrees of freedom on these spacetimes is performed. While it is\nwell established that TEGR reproduces the same results as GR, the propagating\ndegrees of freedom in its non-linear extension, $f(T)$ gravity, is still\ndebated in the literature. In this work, we find that only two fields propagate\nin the gravity sector, independently of the background spacetime considered,\neither FLRW or Bianchi I. Although not definitive, this paper provides fresh\ninsights into the issue of the propagating degrees of freedom in $f(T)$\ngravity, opening the door to intriguing new directions for further\ninvestigation.",

However, this endeavour is complicated for small exoplanets by the\nfact that a wide range of compositions is compatible with their bulk\nproperties. To overcome this issue, we identify triangular regions in the\nmass-radius space where part of this degeneracy is lifted for close-in planets,\nsince low-mass H/He envelopes would not be stable due to high-energy stellar\nirradiation. Planets in these Hot Water World triangles need to contain at\nleast some heavier volatiles and are therefore interesting targets for\natmospheric follow-up observations. We perform a demographic study to show that\nonly few well-characterised planets in these regions are currently known and\nintroduce our CHEOPS GTO programme aimed at identifying more of these potential\nhot water worlds. Here, we present CHEOPS observations for the first two\ntargets of our programme, TOI-238 b and TOI-1685 b. Combined with TESS\nphotometry and published RVs, we use the precise radii and masses of both\nplanets to study their location relative to the corresponding Hot Water World\ntriangles, perform an interior structure analysis and study the lifetimes of\nH/He and water-dominated atmospheres under these conditions. We find that\nTOI-238 b lies, at the 1-sigma level, inside the corresponding triangle. While\na pure H/He atmosphere would have evaporated after 0.4-1.3 Myr, it is likely\nthat a water-dominated atmosphere would have survived until the current age of\nthe system, which makes TOI-238 b a promising hot water world candidate.\nConversely, TOI-1685 b lies below the mass-radius model for a pure silicate\nplanet, meaning that even though a water-dominated atmosphere would be\ncompatible both with our internal structure and evaporation analysis, we cannot\nrule out the planet to be a bare core.",

In these setups, defects arise naturally due to various imperfections\nand can significantly modify the theoretical predictions compared to an ideal\nmodel. Here, we investigate the impact of geometric defects in the simplest\nsituation -- a one-dimensional Rydberg atom array, both at and away from its\nemergent Ising criticality. In the presence of defects, we demonstrate that\nrelevant physical quantities can be extracted from one-point correlation\nfunctions. At the critical point, we show that different types of kinks yield\ndistinct outcomes corresponding to their respective spatial-internal\nsymmetries: site-centered kinks can effectively break the array at the kink\nposition regardless of the kink angle, while bond-centered kinks lead to\ninteresting intermediate-coupling fixed points. In the latter case, due to a\nspecial renormalization group flow trajectory, the whole system can appear\nordered if the system is not large enough. Additionally, away from criticality,\nthe bond-centered kink induces a localization-delocalization transition of the\ndomain wall, characteristic of quantum wetting. These findings highlight the\nutility of kinks as experimental probes and stress the importance of\ncontrolling defects so that experimental observations remain faithful to the\npristine model.",

Given\ntwo different points P and Q in the moduli space, we shall regard them as\ndifferent vacua of the same underlying theory if in a theory where the\nasymptotic values of the moduli correspond to the point P, we can perform an\nexperiment that can determine the spectrum and S-matrix of a theory where the\nasymptotic values of the moduli correspond to the point Q. We argue that in\nasymptotically flat space-time, this can be achieved by taking a charged black\nhole in the limit of large mass and charges. In this limit the local geometry\nat any point outside the horizon is indistinguishable from flat space-time.\nHowever the moduli vary slowly over the entire region so that their values at\nfaraway points can differ by order unity. Therefore, by sending out\nexperimental teams to different regions outside the horizon, an asymptotic\nobserver can measure the spectrum and S-matrix for different values of the\nmoduli.",

When asteroids are measured with\nshort observation time windows, the dominant uncertainty in orbit construction\nis due to distance uncertainty to the NEO. One approach to recover distances is\nfrom topocentric parallax, which is a technique that leverages the rotation of\nthe Earth, causing a small but detectable sinusoidal additive signal to the\nRight Ascension (RA) of the NEO following a period of 1 day. In this paper, we\nfurther develop and evaluate this technique to recover distances in as quickly\nas a single night. We first test the technique on synthetic data of 19\ndifferent asteroids ranging from $\\sim0.05 \\,\\text{AU}$ to $\\sim2.4\n\\,\\text{AU}$. We modify previous algorithms and quantify the limitations of the\nmethod, recovering distances with uncertainties as low as the $\\sim1.3\\%$ level\nfor more nearby objects ($\\lesssim$ 0.3 AU) assuming typical astrometric\nuncertainties. We then acquire our own observations of two asteroids within a\nsingle night with $\\sim0.1''$ uncertainties on RA, and we find we are able to\nrecover distances to the $3\\%$ level. We forecast likely scenarios with the VRO\nand the Argus Array with varying levels of astrometric precision and expected\npointings per night. Our analysis indicates that distances to NEOs on the scale\nof $\\sim0.5$ AU can be constrained to below the percent level within a single\nnight, depending on spacing of observations from one observatory. In a\nfollow-up paper, we will compare these constraints with synchronous and\nasynchronous observations from two separate observatories to measure parallax\neven more efficiently, an exciting and likely possibility over the upcoming\ndecade.",

Hycean planets are thought to be conducive for\nhosting microbial life under conditions similar to those in the Earth's oceans.\nIn the present work we investigate the potential for biological evolution on\nHycean worlds and their dependence on the thermodynamic conditions.

    "abstract": "JWST observations have uncovered a new population of red, compact objects at\nhigh redshifts dubbed `Little Red Dots' (LRDs), which typically show broad\nemission lines and are thought to be dusty Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). Some\nof their other features, however, challenge the AGN explanation, such as\nprominent Balmer breaks and extremely faint or even missing metal\nhigh-ionization lines, X-ray, or radio emission, including in deep stacks. Time\nvariability is another, robust, test of AGN activity. Here, we exploit the\n$z=7.045$ multiply-imaged LRD A2744-QSO1, which offers a particularly unique\ntest of variability due to lensing-induced time delays between the three images\nspanning 22 yr (2.7 yr in the rest-frame), to investigate its photometric and\nspectroscopic variability. We find the equivalent widths (EWs) of the broad\nH$\\alpha$ and H$\\beta$ lines, which are independent of magnification and other\nsystematics, to exhibit significant variations, up to $18\\pm3$ % for H$\\alpha$\nand up to $22\\pm8$ % in H$\\beta$, on a timescale of 875 d (2.4 yr) in the\nrest-frame. This suggests that A2744-QSO1 is indeed an AGN. We find no\nsignificant photometric variability beyond the limiting systematic\nuncertainties, so it currently cannot be determined whether the EW variations\nare due to line-flux or continuum variability. These results are consistent\nwith a typical damped random walk (DRW) variability model for an AGN like\nA2744-QSO1 ($M_{\\mathrm{BH}}=4\\times10^7 \\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$) given the sparse\nsampling of the light-curve with the available data. Our results therefore\nsupport the AGN interpretation of this LRD, and highlight the need for further\nphotometric and spectroscopic monitoring in order to build a detailed and\nreliable light-curve.",

In\npatches where the Higgs mass parameter takes a natural value, the Higgs\npotential only admits a minimum with a large and negative energy density. This\ncauses a cosmological crunch, removing such patches from the landscape.\nConversely, in patches where the Higgs mass parameter is smaller than a\ncritical value, the Higgs potential admits a metastable minimum with the\nstandard cosmological history. This critical value is determined by the\ninstability scale, where the quartic coupling turns negative due to its\nrunning. The ability of this mechanism to explain the observed Higgs mass\nhinges on new physics at the TeV scale, such as vector-like fermions. We study\ntwo simple realizations of this scenario in a heavy neutral lepton model and in\nthe singlet-doublet model, the latter mimicking a Higgsino-bino system.

We preface this with a review of the lepton\nsector of the SM, where charged lepton masses arise from Yukawa couplings and\nneutrino Majorana masses from the Weinberg operator, leading to a unitary\nlepton mixing matrix. We first introduce a single right-handed neutrino and the\nseesaw mechanism, yielding a heavy neutral lepton, then generalise the results\nto the canonical case of three right-handed neutrinos within a general\nparameterisation, leading to non-unitary lepton mixing and three heavy neutral\nleptons, which can detected directly or indirectly via lepton flavour violation\nor neutrinoless double beta decay. We show how the sequential dominance of\nthree right-handed neutrinos with diagonal masses naturally leads to an\neffective two right-handed neutrino model with lepton mixing angle predictions\nin the constrained cases, but unobservable heavy neutral leptons. On the other\nhand, with degenerate off-diagonal masses, the two right-handed neutrinos can\nform a single heavy and observable Dirac neutrino, within a two Higgs doublet\nor Majoron model. Finally we discuss extra singlet neutrinos which can lead to\neither a double seesaw or an inverse seesaw, depending on their Majorana\nmasses, where the latter allows observable heavy neutral leptons, and the\npossibility of a minimal inverse seesaw model where mixing angles can be\npredicted.",

In this paper, we take a different perspective and shift the\nfocus from weights to activation functions, viewing them through the lens of\nspline operators. We propose Curvature Tuning (CT), an interpretable and\nprincipled steering method that modulates a model's decision boundary by\ninjecting a single hyperparameter into its activation functions.

However, their massive computational costs limit their widespread\nuse, particularly in real-time applications. Structured pruning offers an\neffective solution by compressing models and directly providing end-to-end\nspeed improvements, regardless of the hardware environment. Meanwhile,\ndifferent components of the model exhibit varying sensitivities towards\npruning, calling for non-uniform model compression. However, a pruning method\nshould not only identify a capable substructure, but also account for\npost-compression training. To this end, we propose DarwinLM, a method for\ntraining-aware structured pruning. DarwinLM builds upon an evolutionary search\nprocess, generating multiple offspring models in each generation through\nmutation, and selecting the fittest for survival. To assess the effect of\npost-training, we incorporate a lightweight, multistep training process within\nthe offspring population, progressively increasing the number of tokens and\neliminating poorly performing models in each selection stage.

Specifically, for a gapped imaginary\nspectrum in a finite magnetic field, we find that the correlation function\nexhibits an oscillatory behavior that decays exponentially in space.\nConversely, for a gapless imaginary spectrum, the correlation function displays\nan oscillatory behavior with an amplitude that decays algebraically in space;\nthe underlying power law depends on the manifestation of two exceptional points\nwithin this phase.",

    "abstract": "The technique of ``testing by betting\" frames nonparametric sequential\nhypothesis testing as a multiple-round game, where a player bets on future\nobservations that arrive in a streaming fashion, accumulates wealth that\nquantifies evidence against the null hypothesis, and rejects the null once the\nwealth exceeds a specified threshold while controlling the false positive\nerror. Designing an online learning algorithm that achieves a small regret in\nthe game can help rapidly accumulate the bettor's wealth, which in turn can\nshorten the time to reject the null hypothesis under the alternative $H_1$.\nHowever, many of the existing works employ the Online Newton Step (ONS) to\nupdate within a halved decision space to avoid a gradient explosion issue,\nwhich is potentially conservative for rapid wealth accumulation. In this paper,\nwe introduce a novel strategy utilizing interior-point methods in optimization\nthat allows updates across the entire interior of the decision space without\nthe risk of gradient explosion. Our approach not only maintains strong\nstatistical guarantees but also facilitates faster null hypothesis rejection,\nwhile being as computationally lightweight as ONS thanks to its closed-form\nupdates.",

Existing methods that rely on RGB\ncameras often fail under these conditions. To address these limitations, we\nintroduce EventEgo3D++, the first approach that leverages a monocular event\ncamera with a fisheye lens for 3D human motion capture. Event cameras excel in\nhigh-speed scenarios and varying illumination due to their high temporal\nresolution, providing reliable cues for accurate 3D human motion capture.\nEventEgo3D++ leverages the LNES representation of event streams to enable\nprecise 3D reconstructions. We have also developed a mobile head-mounted device\n(HMD) prototype equipped with an event camera, capturing a comprehensive\ndataset that includes real event observations from both controlled studio\nenvironments and in-the-wild settings, in addition to a synthetic dataset.\nAdditionally, to provide a more holistic dataset, we include allocentric RGB\nstreams that offer different perspectives of the HMD wearer, along with their\ncorresponding SMPL body model. Our experiments demonstrate that EventEgo3D++\nachieves superior 3D accuracy and robustness compared to existing solutions,\neven in challenging conditions. Moreover, our method supports real-time 3D pose\nupdates at a rate of 140Hz.

We\naccordingly present a statistical evaluation of the USP classification boundary\nfor 376 multi-planet systems across Kepler, K2, and TESS. We find that USPs are\nsmaller in size ($p = 0.004$) and exhibit larger period ratios with their\nimmediate neighbors ($\\mathcal{P} = P_{2}/P_{1}$; $p < 10^{-4}$) when compared\nto non-USP short-period ($1 < P/\\text{days} < 5$) worlds, and that these\ndiscrepancies rapidly transition towards statistical insignificance ($p >\n0.05$) at respective orbital periods of $P_{R} = 0.97^{+0.25}_{-0.19}$ days and\n$P_{\\mathcal{P}} = 2.09^{+0.16}_{-0.22}$ days (see Figure 3).

Our findings provide\nqualitative support for pathways in which proto-USPs are detached from\ncompanions and delivered to $P \\lesssim 2$ days via eccentric migration, while\na subset of these objects near $P \\sim 1$ day experience subsequent orbital\ndecay and refractory mass loss to become USPs.

Previous research has provided semi-analytical approximations for\nthese models in the form of simple (non-mean-reverting) SABR models, each\nsuitably parameterized for a given expiry.\n  First, using a computer algebra system, we derive closed-form expressions for\nthese semi-analytical approximations, under the assumption that all parameters\nremain constant (but without the constraint of constant expected volatility).\nAlthough the resulting formulas are considerably lengthier than those in\nsimpler SABR models, they remain tractable and are easily implementable even in\nExcel.\n  Second, employing these closed-form expressions, we calibrate the three\nmodels to empirical volatility surfaces observed in EuroStoxx index options.\nThe calibration is well-behaved and achieves excellent fits for the observed\nequity-volatility surfaces, with only five parameters per surface.\nConsequently, the approximate models offer a simpler, faster, and (numerically)\nmore reliable alternative to the classical Heston model, or to more advanced\nmodels, which lack closed-form solutions and can be numerically challenging,\nparticularly in less sophisticated implementation environments.\n  Third, we examine the stability and correlations of our parameter estimates.\nIn this analysis, we identify certain issues with the models - one of which\nappears to stem from the sub-lognormal behavior of the actual equity-volatility\nprocess. Notably, the CIR-volatility model (3), as opposed to the CIR-variance\nHeston model (1), seems to best capture this behavior, and also results in more\nstable parameters.",

This raises important questions about the accessibility\nof AI-driven support for newcomers to OSS projects. This vision paper outlines\nthe potential of adapting AI responses to various problem-solving styles to\navoid privileging a particular subgroup. We discuss the potential of AI\npersona-based prompt engineering as a strategy for interacting with AI. This\nstudy invites further research to refine AI-based tools to better support\ncontributions to OSS projects.",

We present the first empirical investigation of this\nthree-way relationship in classical n-gram models and fine-tuned\nencoder-decoder Transformers. By generating training data from Pareto\ndistributions with varying shape parameters, we systematically control the\nmonofact rates and establish its positive relationship with hallucination. To\nbridge theory and practice, we derive an empirical analog of the hallucination\nbound by replacing the population miscalibration term (Section 2.1) with an\nempirical bin-wise KL divergence and confirm its practical viability. We then\nintroduce selective upweighting -- a simple yet effective technique that\nstrategically repeats as little as 5% of training examples -- to deliberately\ninject miscalibration into the model. This intervention reduces hallucination\nby up to 40%, challenging universal deduplication policies. Our experiments\nreveal a critical trade-off: selective upweighting maintains pre-injection\nlevels of accuracy while substantially reducing hallucination, whereas standard\ntraining gradually improves accuracy but fails to address persistently high\nhallucination, indicating an inherent tension in optimization objectives.",

This is compatible with the unitary time-evolution of the\nquantum state if qualia are understood as effecting the beables of the de\nBroglie-Bohm interpretation or wavefunction collapse process rather than at the\nwavefunction level. We furthermore suggest that not all quantum states are\nconsistent with qualia. If this is the case, the standard wavefunction collapse\npostulates of the Copenhagen interpretation will fail to select only those\nstates which are consistent with qualia, and the Born-rule must be modified if\nwavefunction collapse is to generate the correct dynamical histories across\ntime. This new model which includes qualia clearly demonstrates how non-linear\nand self-referential phenomena can occur, despite the linear, deterministic\ntime-evolution of the wavefunction. We reject the notion that physical matter\noperates independently of qualia, and find that the main evidence for\nepiphenomenalism i.e. the causal closure of the underlying physical\ntime-evolution, has failed to take into consideration fine-tuning of the\nmicrocausal degrees of freedom. We propose that the philosophical zombie\nargument is fine-tuned in the initial conditions, thus making philosophical\nzombies statistically unlikely if the fine-tuning is removed.

Our results demonstrate that\nstandard discriminative models encode substantially richer generative knowledge\nthan previously recognized, providing new perspectives on model\ninterpretability and the relationship between adversarial examples and natural\nimage synthesis.",

    "abstract": "Designing efficient optimizers for large language models (LLMs) with\nlow-memory requirements and fast convergence is an important and challenging\nproblem. This paper makes a step towards the systematic design of such\noptimizers through the lens of structured Fisher information matrix (FIM)\napproximation. We show that many state-of-the-art efficient optimizers can be\nviewed as solutions to FIM approximation (under the Frobenius norm) with\nspecific structural assumptions. Building on these insights, we propose two\ndesign recommendations of practical efficient optimizers for LLMs, involving\nthe careful selection of structural assumptions to balance generality and\nefficiency, and enhancing memory efficiency of optimizers with general\nstructures through a novel low-rank extension framework. We demonstrate how to\nuse each design approach by deriving new memory-efficient optimizers: Row and\nColumn Scaled SGD (RACS) and Adaptive low-dimensional subspace estimation\n(Alice). Experiments on LLaMA pre-training (up to 1B parameters) validate the\neffectiveness, showing faster and better convergence than existing\nmemory-efficient baselines and Adam with little memory overhead. Notably, Alice\nachieves better than 2x faster convergence over Adam, while RACS delivers\nstrong performance on the 1B model with SGD-like memory.",

Our work is motivated by single-cell data which\ncan have very high-dimensionality --exceeding the capabilities of existing\nmethods for point clouds which are mostly tailored for 3D data. Moreover,\nmodern single-cell and spatial experiments now yield entire cohorts of datasets\n(i.e., one data set for every patient), necessitating models that can process\nlarge, high-dimensional point-clouds at scale. Most current approaches build a\nsingle nearest-neighbor graph, discarding important geometric and topological\ninformation. In contrast, HiPoNet models the point-cloud as a set of\nhigher-order simplicial complexes, with each particular complex being created\nusing a reweighting of features. This method thus generates multiple constructs\ncorresponding to different views of high-dimensional data, which in biology\noffers the possibility of disentangling distinct cellular processes. It then\nemploys simplicial wavelet transforms to extract multiscale features, capturing\nboth local and global topology from each view. We show that geometric and\ntopological information is preserved in this framework both theoretically and\nempirically. We showcase the utility of HiPoNet on point-cloud level tasks,\ninvolving classification and regression of entire point-clouds in data cohorts.\nExperimentally, we find that HiPoNet outperforms other point-cloud and\ngraph-based models on single-cell data.

Through theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that the\nfine-tuned result of LoRA is highly sensitive to initialization, which is\nlikely to lead suboptimal low-rank results. While this issue can be mitigated\nby adjusting the initial direction towards the main singular vectors of the\ntarget $\\Delta W$, which is, however, typically unknown in real-world\nscenarios. To approximate this initial direction, we propose High-Rank\nPreheating (HRP), which first trains LoRA with a higher preheating rank for a\nfew steps, then uses the main singular vectors of the derived $BA^\\top$ as\ninitialization for the main fine-tuning process. With only a modification in\nthe initial direction, we prove that HRP makes LoRA achieve better fine-tuned\nresults than random initialization in expectation, and the enhancement grows\nwith the preheating rank. We validate our theoretical findings through\nextensive experiments in various models and tasks, where HRP significantly\nenhances LoRA's effectiveness and outperforms other initialization strategies\nand other LoRA variants.",

In such real-time scenarios, certifying that the employed QP\nalgorithm can either return a solution within a predefined level of optimality\nor detect QP infeasibility before the predefined sampling time is a pressing\nrequirement. This article considers convex QP (including linear programming)\nand adopts its homogeneous formulation to achieve infeasibility detection.\nExploiting this homogeneous formulation, this article proposes a novel\ninfeasible interior-point method (IPM) algorithm with the best theoretical\n$O(\\sqrt{n})$ iteration complexity that feasible IPM algorithms enjoy.

In this work, we propose a semi-autoregressive\n(semi-AR) framework, called Next-Block Prediction (NBP), for video generation.\nBy uniformly decomposing video content into equal-sized blocks (e.g., rows or\nframes), we shift the generation unit from individual tokens to blocks,\nallowing each token in the current block to simultaneously predict the\ncorresponding token in the next block. Unlike traditional AR modeling, our\nframework employs bidirectional attention within each block, enabling tokens to\ncapture more robust spatial dependencies. By predicting multiple tokens in\nparallel, NBP models significantly reduce the number of generation steps,\nleading to faster and more efficient inference. Our model achieves FVD scores\nof 103.3 on UCF101 and 25.5 on K600, outperforming the vanilla NTP model by an\naverage of 4.4. Furthermore, thanks to the reduced number of inference steps,\nthe NBP model generates 8.89 frames (128x128 resolution) per second, achieving\nan 11x speedup. We also explored model scales ranging from 700M to 3B\nparameters, observing significant improvements in generation quality, with FVD\nscores dropping from 103.3 to 55.3 on UCF101 and from 25.5 to 19.5 on K600,\ndemonstrating the scalability of our approach.",

While\nmeta-learning strategies have emerged as a promising approach for addressing\nthis challenge, existing methods often suffer from limited transferability and\ntask-specific designs. This paper introduces TMLC-Net, a novel Transferable\nMeta-Learner for Correcting Noisy Labels, designed to overcome these\nlimitations. TMLC-Net learns a general-purpose label correction strategy that\ncan be readily applied across diverse datasets and model architectures without\nrequiring extensive retraining or fine-tuning. Our approach integrates three\ncore components: (1) Normalized Noise Perception, which captures and normalizes\ntraining dynamics to handle distribution shifts; (2) Time-Series Encoding,\nwhich models the temporal evolution of sample statistics using a recurrent\nneural network; and (3) Subclass Decoding, which predicts a corrected label\ndistribution based on the learned representations. We conduct extensive\nexperiments on benchmark datasets with various noise types and levels,\ndemonstrating that TMLC-Net consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods\nin terms of both accuracy and robustness to label noise.

Despite recent progressive, existing methods often struggle to handle\nsevere object appearance changes and cluttering background in the video due to\nlacking sufficient target cues, leading to degradation. Addressing this, we\nintroduce PRVQL, a novel Progressive knowledge-guided Refinement framework for\nEgoVQL. The core is to continuously exploit target-relevant knowledge directly\nfrom videos and utilize it as guidance to refine both query and video features\nfor improving target localization. Our PRVQL contains multiple processing\nstages. The target knowledge from one stage, comprising appearance and spatial\nknowledge extracted via two specially designed knowledge learning modules, are\nutilized as guidance to refine the query and videos features for the next\nstage, which are used to generate more accurate knowledge for further feature\nrefinement. With such a progressive process, target knowledge in PRVQL can be\ngradually improved, which, in turn, leads to better refined query and video\nfeatures for localization in the final stage. Compared to previous methods, our\nPRVQL, besides the given object cues, enjoys additional crucial target\ninformation from a video as guidance to refine features, and hence enhances\nEgoVQL in complicated scenes.

Proper functionalization of FNDs is required for their application as\nprobes in chemical and biological processes. However, modifying the surface of\nFNDs can affect the properties of qubit sensors. In this work, we thoroughly\nstudy the fundamental properties of embedded nitrogen-vacancy (NV) color\ncenters as a function of FND size and surface termination. The FNDs were\nproduced by milling high-pressure, high-temperature diamonds, and NV centers\nwere introduced via electron beam irradiation and annealing. In particular, the\ninitial FNDs, covered with various oxygen groups, were homogenized through a\nreduction process to predominantly cover them with alcohol ($-$OH) groups as\nreference FNDs. Additionally, a Hofmann degradation process was applied to\nterminate FNDs with amine ($-$NH$_2$) groups, enabling direct linkage of\nproteins and other biomolecules to the FNDs. We monitored the charge state\nstability upon illumination, the zero-field splitting parameters, and the\nlongitudinal spin-relaxation time of the NV centers in these FNDs. Our findings\nindicate that charge state stabilization of the NV centers was achieved in both\n$-$OH- and $-$NH$_2$-terminated FNDs beyond a certain FND size. Furthermore, we\ndemonstrate that $-$NH$_2$-terminated FNDs embedding NV centers exhibit a $T_1$\nlongitudinal relaxation time of approximately 25~$\\mu$s, independent of FND\nsize within the studied range of 10~nm to 140~nm. This relaxation time is\ncomparable to that of larger-sized reference FNDs.",

Challenging this, we propose a new principle:\nPreference data vary in difficulty, and overly difficult examples hinder\nalignment, by exceeding the model's capacity. Through systematic\nexperimentation, we validate this principle with three key findings: (1)\npreference examples vary in difficulty, as evidenced by consistent learning\norders across alignment runs; (2) overly difficult examples significantly\ndegrade performance across four LLMs and two datasets; and (3) the capacity of\na model dictates its threshold for handling difficult examples, underscoring a\ncritical relationship between data selection and model capacity. Building on\nthis principle, we introduce Selective DPO, which filters out overly difficult\nexamples. This simple adjustment improves alignment performance by 9-16% in win\nrates on the AlpacaEval 2 benchmark compared to the DPO baseline, suppressing a\nseries of DPO variants with different algorithmic adjustments.

    "abstract": "A challenge in the design of stellarators for confining plasma at conditions\nrelevant to fusion energy generation is designing a feasible set of magnetic\nfield coils which can create the necessary confining field. One active\ndirection of investigation involves the creation of a set of simplified planar\ncoils to approximate the desired magnetic field, split between large plasma\nencircling coils which generate the majority of the field and small shaping\ncoils near the plasma surface which correct remaining errors in the field\ngeometry. The problem of optimizing currents in these coils is inherently\nill-posed due to the Biot-Savart Law. In this work, the problem of optimizing\nthe current distribution of the shaping coils is posed as a sparse regression\nto minimize coil count while targeting $B_n = \\langle\\mathbf{B} \\cdot\n\\mathbf{n}\\rangle$, a metric of confinement quality, as a least-squares\nobjective. The goal is to improve manufacturability and conductor efficiency by\nusing fewer coils at higher currents. Using an ensemble of sparse optimization\nalgorithms such as LASSO, relax-and-split, and heuristic methods, Pareto fronts\nbetween coil sparsity and $B_n$ properties are identified. Differences between\nthe optimization algorithms are evaluated, demonstrating up to 20% reductions\nin mean $B_n$ at the same sparsity compared to a previously used heuristic\nmethod. The perturbation sensitivity of the sparse solutions to manufacturing\nmisalignment is also evaluated.

We\ncompare this methodology with the conventional Quantum Field Theory (QFT)\nprescription for path integrals and extend the formalism to account for the\ndependence on boundary (coherent) states. This work aims to explore two\naspects: to compare our results with the divergences observed in one-loop\ncalculations of Einstein gravity testing UV-finiteness and to initiate an\nexploration of the IR effective properties of LQG. We compute the effective\naction around flat spacetime obtaining analytical and numerical results in the\nlong and short wavelength approximations, respectively. Due to the one-loop\ndynamics of the LQG area, we find a divergence-free effective action. We study\nthe propagator and the dynamical modes and derive the quantum equation of\nmotion at one loop. We ensure consistency with the semiclassical approximation\nin the long wavelength limit and, beyond this approximation, analyze numerical\nscaling as the lattice size increases.",

The study\nemploys semi-empirical tight-binding calculations via xTB software,\ncomplemented by topological analysis using MULTIWFN software. Comparative\nanalysis reveals MCNB's superior adsorption properties, particularly for\nspecific gases. Notable adsorption energies for MCNB were measured at -1.595eV,\n-0.669eV, and -0.637eV for NO, COCl2, and NO2, respectively, significantly\nexceeding the corresponding CNB values of -0.636eV, -0.449eV, and -0.438eV. The\ninvestigation of desorption kinetics demonstrates rapid recovery times\n(sub-millisecond) for most gas-nanobelt interactions, with the notable\nexception of the MCNB+NO system, which exhibits persistent bonding. Topological\nanalysis confirms chemisorption mechanisms for NO, COCl2, and NO2 on both\nnanobelt variants, characterized by complex hybridizations of covalent and\nnon-covalent interactions. Molecular dynamics simulations conducted in both\npacked configurations and dry air mixtures demonstrate the nanobelts' effective\ngas-attracting properties, maintaining consistent capture performance across\ndifferent environmental conditions.

In this\npaper, we propose a novel global registration method that is based on the\nminimum potential energy (MPE) method to address these problems. The basic\nstrategy is that the objective function is defined as the minimum potential\nenergy optimization function of the physical registration system. The function\ndistributes more weight to the majority of inlier points and less weight to the\nnoise and outliers, which essentially reduces the influence of perturbations in\nthe mathematical formulation. We decompose the solution into a globally optimal\napproximation procedure and a fine registration process with the trimmed\niterative closest point algorithm to boost convergence. The approximation\nprocedure consists of two main steps. First, according to the construction of\nthe force traction operator, we can simply compute the position of the\npotential energy minimum. Second, to find the MPE point, we propose a new\ntheory that employs two flags to observe the status of the registration\nprocedure. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm on four\ntypes of blades. The proposed method outperforms the other global methods in\nterms of both accuracy and noise resistance.",

    "abstract": "Prostate cancer is a leading health concern among men, requiring accurate and\naccessible methods for early detection and risk stratification. Prostate volume\n(PV) is a key parameter in multivariate risk stratification for early prostate\ncancer detection, commonly estimated using transrectal ultrasound (TRUS). While\nTRUS provides precise prostate volume measurements, its invasive nature often\ncompromises patient comfort. Transabdominal ultrasound (TAUS) provides a\nnon-invasive alternative but faces challenges such as lower image quality,\ncomplex interpretation, and reliance on operator expertise. This study\nintroduces a new deep-learning-based framework for automatic PV estimation\nusing TAUS, emphasizing its potential to enable accurate and non-invasive\nprostate cancer risk stratification. A dataset of TAUS videos from 100\nindividual patients was curated, with manually delineated prostate boundaries\nand calculated diameters by an expert clinician as ground truth. The introduced\nframework integrates deep-learning models for prostate segmentation in both\naxial and sagittal planes, automatic prostate diameter estimation, and PV\ncalculation. Segmentation performance was evaluated using Dice correlation\ncoefficient (%) and Hausdorff distance (mm). Framework's volume estimation\ncapabilities were evaluated on volumetric error (mL). The framework\ndemonstrates that it can estimate PV from TAUS videos with a mean volumetric\nerror of -5.5 mL, which results in an average relative error between 5 and 15%.\nThe introduced framework for automatic PV estimation from TAUS images,\nutilizing deep learning models for prostate segmentation, shows promising\nresults. It effectively segments the prostate and estimates its volume,\noffering potential for reliable, non-invasive risk stratification for early\nprostate detection.",

Flows with axial flow entry are\nwell understood, but for oblique flow entry, there is no clarity on the\nadditional pressure loss magnitude or the flow regime. Laminar flow is often\nassumed, even though flow separation at the channel entrance can cause a\ntransition to turbulence. Here, the impact of oblique flow entry on the flow is\ninvestigated using LES (Large Eddy Simulation) and RANS (Reynolds Averaged\nNavier Stokes) models, and their advantages and limitations are identified. The\nLES simulations show that the shear layer at the channel entrance produces\ncontinuous shedding of eddies that persist downstream even at moderate channel\nReynolds numbers (~2000). The predicted pressure losses mostly agree with\nexperimental data. The differences observed for some parameters are attributed\nto the difficulty of accurately replicating the experimental geometry. It is\nshown that LES results are susceptible to the rounding of the leading edge\n(present in experiments). Including edge rounding improves the pressure\npredictions. RANS simulations predicted pressure losses within 5% of\nexperimental values for most cases, apart from where transitional flow was\nobserved (resulting in differences up to 40%). This study provides insights\ninto the flow structure and sources of pressure losses in square channels and\nhighlights the importance of understanding key flow and geometric features when\nusing LES to predict complex flows involving flow separation and shear layers.",

Spinning horizonless objects are prone to the ergoregion instability,\nwhich would prevent their existence if their spin is higher than a critical\nthreshold. In this paper, we set upper limits on the existence of a population\nof merging ECOs from the spin distribution of the population of compact binary\ncoalescences (CBCs) detected by the LIGO, Virgo and KAGRA collaboration. Using\nspin measurements from 104 compact objects, we find that if ECOs have $\\epsilon\n\\in [10^{-42}-10^{-3}]$ and their surface is totally reflective, the population\nof CBCs cannot be composed (at 90% credible level) by more than 71% (59%) of\nECOs for polar (axial) perturbations. If we restrict the ECOs to be\nultracompact ($\\epsilon<10^{-30}$), at 90% credible level, ECOs cannot compose\nmore than 28% and 25% of the CBC population for polar and axial perturbations.\nThe constraints from current data are a factor of two more precise than the\nones obtained from a non-detection of a stochastic GW background due to spin\nloss.

In this work, we offer a simple approach to accelerate testing:\ngroup your datapoints into bins and permute only those bins. For U and\nV-statistics, we prove that these cheap permutation tests have two remarkable\nproperties. First, by storing appropriate sufficient statistics, a cheap test\ncan be run in time comparable to evaluating a single test statistic. Second,\ncheap permutation power closely approximates standard permutation power. As a\nresult, cheap tests inherit the exact false positive control and minimax\noptimality of standard permutation tests while running in a fraction of the\ntime. We complement these findings with improved power guarantees for standard\npermutation testing and experiments demonstrating the benefits of cheap\npermutations over standard maximum mean discrepancy (MMD), Hilbert-Schmidt\nindependence criterion (HSIC), random Fourier feature, Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney,\ncross-MMD, and cross-HSIC tests.",

We investigate\nthe resources driving the complexity of classical simulation in the standard\nmodel of continuous-variable quantum computing, and their interplay enabling\ncomputational universality.

Using quadrature propagation across\nmultiple computational paths, we develop an efficient classical simulation\nalgorithm for continuous-variable computations with low symplectic coherence.\nThis establishes symplectic coherence as a necessary resource for universality\nin continuous-variable quantum computing, alongside non-Gaussianity and\nentanglement.

    "abstract": "We devise $\\epsilon$-coresets for robust $(k,z)$-Clustering with $m$ outliers\nthrough black-box reductions to vanilla case.

This increases the size of the vanilla coreset by a small\nmultiplicative factor of $\\mathrm{poly}\\log(km\\epsilon^{-1})$, and the additive\nterm is up to a $(\\epsilon^{-1}\\log (km))^{O(z)}$ factor to the size of the\noptimal robust coreset. Plugging in vanilla coreset results of [Cohen-Addad et\nal., STOC'21], we obtain the first coresets for $(k,z)$-Clustering with $m$\noutliers with size near-linear in $k$ while previous results have size at least\n$\\Omega(k^2)$ [Huang et al., ICLR'23; Huang et al., SODA'25].\n  Technically, we establish two conditions under which a vanilla coreset is as\nwell a robust coreset. The first condition requires the dataset to satisfy\nspecial structures - it can be broken into \"dense\" parts with bounded diameter.\nWe combine this with a new bounded-diameter decomposition that has only $O_z(km\n\\epsilon^{-1})$ non-dense points to obtain the $O_z(km \\epsilon^{-1})$ additive\nbound. Another condition requires the vanilla coreset to possess an extra\nsize-preserving property. We further give a black-box reduction that turns a\nvanilla coreset to the one satisfying the said size-preserving property,\nleading to the alternative $O_z(m\\epsilon^{-2z}\\log^{z}(km\\epsilon^{-1}))$\nadditive bound.\n  We also implement our reductions in the dynamic streaming setting and obtain\nthe first streaming algorithms for $k$-Median and $k$-Means with $m$ outliers,\nusing space $\\tilde{O}(k+m)\\cdot\\mathrm{poly}(d\\epsilon^{-1}\\log\\Delta)$ for\ninputs on the grid $[\\Delta]^d$.",

Thus, they\nrepresent ideal local laboratories for detailed multi-wavelength studies to\nunderstand their properties and the mechanisms shaping them. We report the\nfirst JWST MIRI/MRS observations of the BCD SBS 0335-052 E, analyzing MIR\nemission lines tracing different levels of ionization (e.g., [NeII], [SIV],\n[NeIII], [OIV], [NeV]) of the ionized gas. SBS 0335-052 E MIR emission is\ncharacterized by a bright point source, located in one of the youngest and most\nembedded stellar clusters ($t\\sim3$ Myr, $A_V\\sim15$), and underlying extended\nhigh-ionization emission (i.e., [OIV], [NeV]) from the surroundings of the\nolder and less dusty stellar clusters ($t< 20 $ Myr, $A_V\\sim8$). From the\ncomparison with state-of-the-art models, we can exclude shocks, X-ray binaries,\nand old stellar populations as the main sources of the high ionization.\nInterestingly, a 4-16% contribution of a $\\sim10^5$ M$_\\odot$ intermediate\nmassive black hole (IMBH) is needed to justify the strong [NeV]/[NeII] and\nwould be consistent with optical/UV line ratios from previous studies.

Also, star-forming\nmodels (regardless of including X-ray binaries) struggle to reproduce even the\nlower ionization line ratios (e.g., [SIV]/[NeII]) typically observed in BCDs.\nOverall, while current models suggest the need to account for an accreting IMBH\nin this high-$z$ analog, limitations still exist in predicting high-ionization\nemission lines (I.P. $>54$ eV) when modeling these low-metallicity\nenvironments, thus other sources of ionization cannot be fully ruled out.",

This viewpoint allows us to track the evolution of eigenvalues and\neigenvectors of the matrix, which are governed by stochastic differential\nequations discovered by Dyson. These equations enable us to upper bound the\nFrobenius distance between the best rank-$k$ approximation of $M$ and that of a\nGaussian perturbation of $M$ as an integral that involves inverse eigenvalue\ngaps of the stochastically evolving matrix, as opposed to a sum of perturbation\nbounds obtained via Davis-Kahan-type theorems. Subsequently, again using the\nDyson Brownian motion viewpoint, we show that the eigenvalues of the matrix $M$\nperturbed by Gaussian noise have large gaps with high probability. These\nresults also contribute to the analysis of low-rank approximations under\naverage-case perturbations, and to an understanding of eigenvalue gaps for\nrandom matrices, both of which may be of independent interest.",

    "abstract": "We propose a general and unifying framework for causal Imitation Learning\n(IL) with hidden confounders that subsumes several existing confounded IL\nsettings from the literature. Our framework accounts for two types of hidden\nconfounders: (a) those observed by the expert, which thus influence the\nexpert's policy, and (b) confounding noise hidden to both the expert and the IL\nalgorithm. For additional flexibility, we also introduce a confounding noise\nhorizon and time-varying expert-observable hidden variables. We show that\ncausal IL in our framework can be reduced to a set of Conditional Moment\nRestrictions (CMRs) by leveraging trajectory histories as instruments to learn\na history-dependent policy. We propose DML-IL, a novel algorithm that uses\ninstrumental variable regression to solve these CMRs and learn a policy. We\nprovide a bound on the imitation gap for DML-IL, which recovers prior results\nas special cases. Empirical evaluation on a toy environment with continues\nstate-action spaces and multiple Mujoco tasks demonstrate that DML-IL\noutperforms state-of-the-art causal IL algorithms.",

Comparison-based sorting algorithms, like quick-sort and\nmerge-sort, are known to be optimal when the outcome of each comparison is\nerror-free. However, many real-world sorting applications operate in scenarios\nwhere the outcome of each comparison can be noisy. In this work, we explore\nsettings where a bounded number of comparisons are potentially corrupted by\nerroneous agents, resulting in arbitrary, adversarial outcomes.\n  We model the sorting problem as a query-limited tournament graph where edges\ninvolving erroneous nodes may yield arbitrary results. Our primary contribution\nis a randomized algorithm inspired by quick-sort that, in expectation, produces\nan ordering close to the true total order while only querying $\\tilde{O}(n)$\nedges. We achieve a distance from the target order $\\pi$ within $(3 +\n\\epsilon)|B|$, where $B$ is the set of erroneous nodes, balancing the competing\nobjectives of minimizing both query complexity and misalignment with $\\pi$. Our\nalgorithm needs to carefully balance two aspects: identify a pivot that\npartitions the vertex set evenly and ensure that this partition is \"truthful\"\nand yet query as few \"triangles\" in the graph $G$ as possible. Since the nodes\nin $B$ can potentially hide in an intricate manner, our algorithm requires\nseveral technical steps.\n  Additionally, we demonstrate significant implications for the Ulam-$k$-Median\nproblem, a classical clustering problem where the metric is defined on the set\nof permutations on a set of $d$ elements.

    "abstract": "We introduce Goedel-Prover, an open-source language model that achieves\nstate-of-the-art (as of April 5 2025) performance in automated formal proof\ngeneration for mathematical problems. A key challenge in this field is the\nscarcity of formalized mathematical statements and proofs, which we address\nthrough the following approaches. First, we train LLMs to convert natural\nlanguage math problems from the Numina dataset to equivalent formal statements\nin Lean 4. This process creates the dataset Goedel-Pset-v1, which includes 1.64\nmillion formal statements. Next, we develop a large dataset of formal proofs by\ntraining a series of provers. Each new prover can prove many statements that\nprevious ones could not, and these new proofs are added to the training set for\nthe next prover. Finally, we obtain the dataset Goedel-Pset-v1-solved, which\ncontains proofs for over 800K statements from Goedel-Pset-v1. Supervised\nfine-tuning (SFT) of DeepSeek-Prover-V1.5-Base on Goedel-Pset-v1-solved (i.e.,\nno RL) yields a Goedel-Prover-SFT that achieves a success rate of 57.6%\n(Pass@32) on miniF2F, surpassing the previous leader DeepSeek-Prover-V1.5-RL\n(trained using SFT + RL on a proprietary dataset) by 7.6%. On PutnamBench,\nGoedel-Prover-SFT successfully solves 7 problems (Pass@512), ranking first on\nthe leaderboard. We provide extensive discussion of our training methodology,\nhighlighting the key design choices that contribute to Goedel-Prover's strong\nperformance. Further RL training (including DPO) improves Goedel-Prover-SFT's\nsuccess rate to over 60% (Pass@32) on miniF2F.\n  To aid future research, we provide extensive discussion of our training\nmethodology and design choices. We also fully open-source our codes, models,\nand datasets. Additionally, we open-source formal proofs for 29.7K problems in\nLean Workbook, nearly doubling the 15.7K solved by prior provers.",

This necessitates innovative statistical\napproaches in clinical trials, particularly in master protocol studies. Basket\ntrials, a type of master protocol, evaluate a single treatment across cohorts\nsharing a genomic aberration but differing in tumor histology. While offering\noperational advantages, basket trial analysis presents statistical inference\nchallenges. These trials help determine for which tumor histology the treatment\nis promising enough to advance to confirmatory evaluation and often use\nBayesian designs to support decisions. Beyond decision-making, estimating\ncohort-specific response rates is crucial for designing subsequent trials. This\nstudy compares seven Bayesian estimation methods for basket trials with binary\noutcomes against the (frequentist) sample proportion estimate through\nsimulations. The goal is to estimate cohort-specific response rates, focusing\non bias, mean squared error, and information borrowing. Various scenarios are\nexamined, including homogeneous, heterogeneous, and clustered response rates\nacross cohorts. Results show trade-offs in bias and precision, highlighting the\nimportance of method selection. Berry's method performs best with limited\nheterogeneity. No clear winner emerges in general cases, with performance\naffected by shrinkage, bias, and the choice of priors and tuning parameters.\nChallenges include computational complexity, parameter tuning, and the lack of\nclear guidance on selection.

TOF\ninformation can be derived from coincident detector signals and incorporated\ninto image reconstruction to enhance the SNR. PET detectors are typically\nassessed by their CTR, but timing performance is degraded by various factors.\nResearch on timing calibration seeks to mitigate these degradations and restore\naccurate timing information. While many calibration methods use analytical\napproaches, machine learning techniques have recently gained attention due to\ntheir flexibility. We developed a residual physics-based calibration approach\nthat combines prior domain knowledge with the power of machine learning models.\nThis approach begins with an initial analytical calibration addressing\nfirst-order skews. The remaining deviations, regarded as residual effects, are\nused to train machine learning models to eliminate higher-order skews. The key\nadvantage is that the experimenter guides the learning process through the\ndefinition of timing residuals. In earlier studies, we developed models that\ndirectly predicted the expected time difference, which offered corrections only\nimplicitly (implicit correction models). In this study, we introduce a new\ndefinition for timing residuals, enabling us to train models that directly\npredict correction values (explicit correction models). The explicit correction\napproach significantly simplifies data acquisition, improves linearity, and\nenhances timing performance from $371 \\pm 6$ ps to $281 \\pm 5$ ps for\ncoincidences from 430 keV to 590 keV. Additionally, the new definition reduces\nmodel size, making it suitable for high-throughput applications like PET\nscanners.

Evaluating tumbling elements in cheerleading relies on both\nobjective measures and subjective judgments, such as difficulty and execution\nquality. However, the complexity of tumbling - encompassing team synchronicity,\nground interactions, choreography, and artistic expression - makes objective\nassessment challenging. Artificial intelligence (AI) has revolutionized various\nscientific fields and industries through precise data-driven analyses, yet\ntheir application in acrobatic sports remains limited despite significant\npotential for enhancing performance evaluation and coaching. This study\ninvestigates the feasibility of using an AI-based approach with data from a\nsingle inertial measurement unit to accurately identify and objectively assess\ntumbling elements in standard cheerleading routines. A sample of 16\nparticipants (13 females, 3 males) from a Division I collegiate cheerleading\nteam wore a single inertial measurement unit at the dorsal pelvis. Over a\n4-week seasonal preparation period, 1102 tumbling elements were recorded during\nregular practice sessions. Using triaxial accelerations and rotational speeds,\nvarious ML algorithms were employed to classify and evaluate the execution of\ntumbling manoeuvres. Results indicate that certain machine learning models can\neffectively identify different tumbling elements despite inter-individual\nvariability and data noise, achieving high accuracy.

    "abstract": "An empirical stochastic analysis of high-frequency, tick-by-tick order data\nof NASDAQ100 listed stocks is conducted using a first-order discrete-time\nMarkov chain model to explore intraday order transition dynamics. This analysis\nfocuses on three market cap categories: High, Medium, and Low. Time-homogeneous\ntransition probability matrices are estimated and compared across time-zones\nand market cap categories, and we found that limit orders exhibit higher degree\nof inertia (DoI), i.e., the probability of placing consecutive limit order is\nhigher, during the opening hour. However, in the subsequent hour, the DoI of\nlimit order decreases, while that of market order increases. Limit order\nadjustments via additions and deletions of limit orders increases significantly\nafter the opening hour. All the order transitions then stabilize during\nmid-hours. As the closing hour approaches, consecutive order executions surge,\nwith decreased placement of buy and sell limit orders following sell and buy\nexecutions, respectively. In terms of the differences in order transitions\nbetween stocks of different market cap, DoI of orders is stronger in high and\nmedium market cap stocks. On the other hand, lower market cap stocks show a\nhigher probability of limit order modifications and greater likelihood of\nsubmitting sell/buy limit orders after buy/sell executions. Further, order\ntransitions are clustered across all stocks, except during opening and closing\nhours. The findings of this study may be useful in understanding intraday order\nplacement dynamics across stocks of varying market cap, thus aiding market\nparticipants in making informed order placements at different times of trading\nhour.",

    "abstract": "Profiling core-periphery structures in networks has attracted significant\nattention, leading to the development of various methods. Among these, the\nrich-core method is distinguished for being entirely parameter-free and\nscalable to large networks. However, the cores it identifies are not always\nstructurally cohesive, as they may lack high link density. Here, we propose an\nimproved method building upon the rich-core framework. Instead of relying on\nnode degree, our approach incorporates both the node's coreness $k$ and its\ncentrality within the $k$-core. We apply the approach to twelve real-world\nnetworks, and find that the cores identified are generally denser compared to\nthose derived from the rich-core method. Additionally, we demonstrate that the\nproposed method provides a natural way for identifying an exceptionally dense\ncore, i.e., a clique, which often approximates or even matches the maximum\nclique in many real-world networks. Furthermore, we extend the method to\nmultiplex networks, and show its effectiveness in identifying dense multiplex\ncores across several well-studied datasets. Our study may offer valuable\ninsights into exploring the meso-scale properties of complex networks.",

Using the unifying non-equilibrium perturbative (UNEP) approach, we\nanalyze weak backscattering through a quantum point contact (QPC). In both\ntwo-terminal geometries and the \"anyon collider\" setup, the lower bound on\nphotoassisted backscattering noise is set by the photoassisted current rather\nthan the DC noise predicted by Levitov's theorem. This super-Poissonian\ncharacter is confirmed within the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid (TLL) framework,\nwhere Levitov's theorem is violated, challenging the conventional\ninterpretation of \"photoassisted\" noise.\n  In the two-terminal geometry, we show that when the QPC has a low scaling\ndimension, two challenges arise: first, achieving the expected power-law\nbehavior in the DC regime, and second, maintaining the AC quantum regime, where\nthe drive frequency exceeds the temperature, when the DC voltage component is\nresonant with that drive frequency. The validity of the UNEP relations imposes\na lower bound on temperature and a persisting equilibrium contribution to\nbackscattering noise. This forces us to choose a high enough scaling dimension,\nfor which we find that it is rather the photoconductance, often overlooked,\nthat might exhibit spikes at resonant DC voltages, providing a reliable probe\nof fractional charge. Moreover, we highlight that the zero-temperature limit,\nfrequently assumed in prior studies, including X. G.

    "abstract": "The remarkable success of large-scale contrastive pre-training, fueled by\nvast and curated datasets, is encountering new frontiers as the scaling\nparadigm evolves. A critical emerging challenge is the effective pre-training\nof models on dynamic data streams characterized by concept drift, unpredictable\nchanges in the underlying data distribution. This paper undertakes a\nfoundational investigation of this issue. We first reveal that conventional\ncontrastive pre-training methods are notably vulnerable to concept drift,\nleading to significant biases in the learned feature space of pre-trained\nmodels. To systematically analyze these effects, we construct a structural\ncausal model that elucidates how drift acts as a confounder, distorting learned\nrepresentations. Based on these causal insights, we propose Resilient\nContrastive Pre-training (RCP), a novel method incorporating causal\nintervention. RCP introduces a causally-informed objective designed to mitigate\ndrift-induced biases by leveraging targeted interventions. RCP is designed for\nsimple and scalable implementation and exhibits notable adaptability, promoting\nrobust pre-training on evolving data. Comprehensive experiments across diverse\ndownstream tasks compellingly demonstrate that RCP effectively alleviates the\ndetrimental impact of concept drift, yielding more resilient and generalizable\nrepresentations.",

After the explosion, the material ejected by the Supernova expands\nthroughout the interstellar medium (ISM) forming what is called Supernova\nRemnant (SNR). Shocks associated with the expanding SNR are sources of galactic\ncosmic rays, that can reach energy of the PeV order. In these processes, a key\nrole is played by the magnetic field. It is known that the ISM is turbulent\nwith an observed magnetic field of about a few $\\mu$G, made by the\nsuperposition of a uniform and a fluctuating component. During the SNR\nexpansion, the shock interacts with a turbulent environment, leading to a\ndistortion of the shock front and a compression of the medium. In this work, we\nuse the MagnetoHydroDynamics (MHD) PLUTO code to mimic the evolution of the\nblast wave associated with the SNR. We make a parametric study varying the\nlevel of density and magnetic field fluctuations in the interstellar medium,\nwith the aim of understanding the best parameter values able to reproduce real\nobservations. We introduce a novel analysis technique based on two-dimensional\nautocorrelation function $C({\\ell})$ and the second order structure function\n$S_2(\\ell)$, quantifying the level of anisotropy and the turbulence correlation\nlengths. By interpolating the autocorrelation function on a polar grid, we\nextract the power spectra of turbulence at the SNR.

In this paper, we put forward an alternative approach to inferring\nevidence for dark matter through modified gravity, without invoking fundamental\ndark matter particles. Specifically, we explore the possibility of extracting\nsignatures of Kaluza-Klein gravity through the gravitational Aharonov-Bohm\neffect. Kaluza-Klein theory has recently been proposed as an alternative to the\ndark sector, and predicts a tower of particles, including spin-0 and spin-1\ngravitons alongside the usual spin-2 gravitons, which can gravitationally\ncouple to matter. We thus analyze a quantum system in free fall around a\ngravitating body in the presence of a modified Yukawa-like gravitational\npotential, and determine the gravitational phase induced by the additional\ndegrees of freedom introduced by the Kaluza-Klein model. Our results reveal\nthat, in addition to the usual result from General Relativity, the quantum wave\nfunction of the system exhibits an additional effect: a splitting of the energy\nlevels with a new quantum number due to the extra vector gravitational degrees\nof freedom. The energy splitting difference between general relativity and\nKaluza-Klein gravity is found to be of the order of meV for an atomic system\nand eV for a nuclear system. Similar values also arise in generic modified\ngravity models and can be feasibly tested in the future.

Deep\nLearning (DL)-based approaches have been proven beneficial for various software\nengineering (SE) tasks, including this one. Most state-of-the-art datasets for\ncode summarization are automatically mined from GitHub and, thus, might contain\nerroneous or sub-optimal examples. Previous work showed that using a simple\nrule-based approach for removing noisy instances allows for a tangible\nreduction of the training set size while not reducing the effectiveness of the\ntrained models. Motivated by this finding, we conjecture that it is possible to\nfurther reduce the dataset size by removing instances that contain different\nissues. In this paper, we explore the extent to which code-comment coherence, a\nspecific quality attribute of code summaries, can be used to optimize code\nsummarization datasets. Specifically, we hypothesize that removing incoherent\ncode-comment pairs might positively impact the effectiveness of the models. To\ndo this, we rely on SIDE, a recently introduced metric for code-summary\ncoherence. We examine multiple selectivity levels of training instances from\ntwo state-of-the-art datasets (TL-CodeSum and Funcom) and evaluate the\nresulting models on three manually curated test sets. The results show that\neven halving the training set sizes does not significantly affect the model's\nability to generate summaries. However, when comparing the most restrictive\nselection strategy with a simpler one that randomly selects the training\ninstances, we observe that the resulting accuracy of the model also does not\nchange.

For this purpose, we apply the deep-SHAP method to explain\nthe velocity fluctuation prediction in wall-parallel planes in a turbulent open\nchannel at a friction Reynolds number ${\\rm{Re}}_\\tau=180$. The\nexplainable-deep-learning methodology comprises two stages. The first stage\nconsists of training the estimator. In this case, the velocity fluctuation at a\nwall-normal distance of 15 wall units is predicted from the wall-shear stress\nand wall-pressure. In the second stage, the deep-SHAP algorithm is applied to\nestimate the impact each single grid point has on the output. This analysis\ncalculates an importance field, and then, correlates the high-importance\nregions calculated through the deep-SHAP algorithm with the wall-pressure and\nwall-shear stress distributions. The grid points are then clustered to define\nstructures according to their importance. We find that the high-importance\nclusters exhibit large pressure and shear-stress fluctuations, although\ngenerally not corresponding to the highest intensities in the input datasets.\nTheir typical values averaged among these clusters are equal to one to two\ntimes their standard deviation and are associated with streak-like regions.\nThese high-importance clusters present a size between 20 and 120 wall units,\ncorresponding to approximately 100 and 600${\\rm\\mu m}$ for the case of a\ncommercial aircraft.",

Current methods for controllable\ngeneration primarily focus on modifying the score function of diffusion models,\nwhile Mean Reverting (MR) Diffusion directly modifies the structure of the\nstochastic differential equation (SDE), making the incorporation of image\nconditions simpler and more natural. However, current training-free fast\nsamplers are not directly applicable to MR Diffusion. And thus MR Diffusion\nrequires hundreds of NFEs (number of function evaluations) to obtain\nhigh-quality samples. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm named MaRS (MR\nSampler) to reduce the sampling NFEs of MR Diffusion. We solve the reverse-time\nSDE and the probability flow ordinary differential equation (PF-ODE) associated\nwith MR Diffusion, and derive semi-analytical solutions. The solutions consist\nof an analytical function and an integral parameterized by a neural network.\nBased on this solution, we can generate high-quality samples in fewer steps.\nOur approach does not require training and supports all mainstream\nparameterizations, including noise prediction, data prediction and velocity\nprediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MR Sampler maintains high\nsampling quality with a speedup of 10 to 20 times across ten different image\nrestoration tasks.

To quantify the maximal increase in energy, we\nintroduce the notion of an energetic resilience metric. Prior work in this\nparticular setting does not consider general nonlinear dynamical systems. In\ndeveloping this framework, we first consider the special case of linear\ndriftless systems and recall the energies in the control signal in the nominal\nand malfunctioning systems. Using these energies, we derive a bound on the\nenergetic resilience metric. For general nonlinear systems, we first obtain a\ncondition on the mean value of the control signal in both the nominal and\nmalfunctioning systems, which allows us to approximate the energy in the\ncontrol. We then obtain a worst-case approximation of this energy for the\nmalfunctioning system, over all malfunctioning inputs. Assuming this\napproximation is exact, we derive bounds on the energetic resilience metric\nwhen control authority is lost over one actuator. A set of simulation examples\ndemonstrate that the metric is useful in quantifying the resilience of the\nsystem without significant conservatism, despite the approximations used in\nobtaining control energies for nonlinear systems.",

This study addresses the challenge of deploying a\nmulti-robot team for optimal coverage in environments where the density\ndistribution, describing areas of interest, is unknown and changes over time.\nWe propose a fully distributed control strategy that uses Gaussian Processes\n(GPs) to model the spatial field and balance the trade-off between learning the\nfield and optimally covering it. Unlike existing approaches, we address a more\nrealistic scenario by handling time-varying spatial fields, where the\nexploration-exploitation trade-off is dynamically adjusted over time. Each\nrobot operates locally, using only its own collected data and the information\nshared by the neighboring robots. To address the computational limits of GPs,\nthe algorithm efficiently manages the volume of data by selecting only the most\nrelevant samples for the process estimation. The performance of the proposed\nalgorithm is evaluated through several simulations and experiments,\nincorporating real-world data phenomena to validate its effectiveness.",

Among the pressing challenges in AI safety, machine unlearning\n(MU) has become increasingly critical to meet upcoming safety regulations. Most\nexisting MU approaches focus on altering the most significant parameters of the\nmodel. However, these methods often require fine-tuning substantial portions of\nthe model, resulting in high computational costs and training instabilities,\nwhich are typically mitigated by access to the original training dataset.\n  In this work, we address these limitations by leveraging Singular Value\nDecomposition (SVD) to create a compact, low-dimensional projection that\nenables the selective forgetting of specific data points. We propose Singular\nValue Decomposition for Efficient Machine Unlearning (SEMU), a novel approach\ndesigned to optimize MU in two key aspects. First, SEMU minimizes the number of\nmodel parameters that need to be modified, effectively removing unwanted\nknowledge while making only minimal changes to the model's weights. Second,\nSEMU eliminates the dependency on the original training dataset, preserving the\nmodel's previously acquired knowledge without additional data requirements.\n  Extensive experiments demonstrate that SEMU achieves competitive performance\nwhile significantly improving efficiency in terms of both data usage and the\nnumber of modified parameters.",

This means\ninterpretability can be framed as a communication problem: humans must be able\nto reference and control machine concepts, and communicate human concepts to\nmachines. Creating a shared human-machine language through developing\nneologisms, we believe, could solve this communication problem. Successful\nneologisms achieve a useful amount of abstraction: not too detailed, so they're\nreusable in many contexts, and not too high-level, so they convey precise\ninformation. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate how a \"length neologism\"\nenables controlling LLM response length, while a \"diversity neologism\" allows\nsampling more variable responses. Taken together, we argue that we cannot\nunderstand AI using our existing vocabulary, and expanding it through\nneologisms creates opportunities for both controlling and understanding\nmachines better.",

It is now believed, that such butterfly effect is not\nfully relevant to account for the type of randomness observed in turbulence.\nFor example, tracers in homogeneous isotropic flows are observed to separate\nalgebraically, following a universal cubic growth, independent from the initial\nseparation. This regime, known as Richardon's regime, suggests that at the\nlevel of trajectories, and unlike in chaos theory, randomness may in fact\nemerge in finite-time. This phenomenon called 'spontaneous stochasticity'\noriginates from the singular nature of the underlying dynamics, and provides a\ncandidate framework for turbulent randomness and transport. While spontaneous\nstochasticity has been mathematically formalised in simplified turbulence\nmodels, a precise and systematic tool for quantifying the various facets of\nthis phenomenon is to this day missing. In particular, it is still unclear\nwhether chaos is important for that behaviour to appear.\n  In this paper we introduce a 3d rough flow that can be tuned to present\nLagrangian chaos. The flow is inspired by the Weierstrass function and is\nentitled 'the WABC model'. After analysing its properties, we define what is\nspontaneous stochasticity in this context. The provided formal definition is\nthen adapted to better suit for numerical analysis. We present the results from\nMonte-Carlo simulations of Lagrangian particles in this flow.

Existing sampling\nalgorithms typically require many iterative steps to produce high-quality\nsamples, leading to high computational costs that limit their practicality in\ntime-sensitive or resource-constrained settings. In this work, we introduce\nconsistent diffusion samplers, a new class of samplers designed to generate\nhigh-fidelity samples in a single step. We first develop a distillation\nalgorithm to train a consistent diffusion sampler from a pretrained diffusion\nmodel without pre-collecting large datasets of samples. Our algorithm leverages\nincomplete sampling trajectories and noisy intermediate states directly from\nthe diffusion process. We further propose a method to train a consistent\ndiffusion sampler from scratch, fully amortizing exploration by training a\nsingle model that both performs diffusion sampling and skips intermediate steps\nusing a self-consistency loss. Through extensive experiments on a variety of\nunnormalized distributions, we show that our approach yields high-fidelity\nsamples using less than 1% of the network evaluations required by traditional\ndiffusion samplers.",

In this thesis, we explore the gauge origami\nsystem in $\\mathbb{R}^{1,1}\\times \\mathbb{C}^{4}$ and its BPS/CFT\ncorrespondence. String theoretically, instantons of the gauge origami system\narise from D0-branes bound to D$(2p)$-branes wrapping cycles in\n$\\mathbb{C}^{4}$. The low energy theory of the D0-branes is understood as an\n$\\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric quiver quantum mechanical system and the Witten\nindex of it produces the instanton partition function. We define a $q$-deformed\nquiver Cartan matrix associated to this quiver structure and introduce vertex\noperators associated with the D-branes and show that the contour integral\nformula for the Witten index has a nice free field realization. Such free field\nrealization leads to the concept of BPS $qq$-characters or BPS quiver\nW-algebras, which are generalizations of the conventional deformed W-algebras.\nThe $qq$-characters of D2 and D4-branes correspond to screening charges and\ngenerators of the affine quiver W-algebra, respectively. On the other hand, the\n$qq$-characters of D6 and D8-branes represent novel types of $qq$-characters,\nwhere monomial terms are characterized by plane partitions and solid\npartitions. The composition of these $qq$-characters yields the instanton\npartition functions of the gauge origami system, eventually establishing the\nBPS/CFT correspondence.

Results: Current protection limits are confirmed as\nconservative, with non-compliance observed in only 0.02% and 2.4% of axons\nunder clamped and sealed boundary conditions, respectively. The study\nhighlights significant intersubject variability (up to 600% mean threshold) and\nclarifies the influence of neural excitation models on permissible level\nassessments. Conclusion: Current electric field limits are conservative for CNS\nelectrostimulation in the intermediate frequencies range, but the margin of\nsafety decreases at higher frequencies, warranting further evaluation. Impact:\nThe findings and methodology contribute to the rationale and provide valuable\ninsights for revising electromagnetic safety exposure guidelines.",

However, existing sequence parallelism (SP) methods are\neither not optimized for the right-product-first feature of linear attention or\nuse a ring-style communication strategy, which results in lower computation\nparallelism, limits their scalability for longer sequences in distributed\nsystems. In this paper, we introduce LASP-2, a new SP method to enhance both\ncommunication and computation parallelism when training linear attention\ntransformer models with very-long input sequences. Compared to previous work\nLASP, LASP-2 rethinks the minimal communication requirement for SP on linear\nattention layers, reorganizes the whole communication-computation workflow of\nLASP. In this way, only one single AllGather collective communication is needed\non intermediate memory states, whose sizes are independent of the sequence\nlength, leading to significant improvements of both communication and\ncomputation parallelism, as well as their overlap. Additionally, we extend\nLASP-2 to LASP-2H by applying similar communication redesign to standard\nattention modules, offering an efficient SP solution for hybrid models that\nblend linear and standard attention layers. Our evaluation on a Linear-Llama3\nmodel, a variant of Llama3 with linear attention replacing standard attention,\ndemonstrates the effectiveness of LASP-2 and LASP-2H.

Some defenses have\nbeen proposed to detect or mitigate jailbreaks, but they are unable to\nwithstand the test of time due to an insufficient understanding of jailbreak\nmechanisms. In this work, we investigate the mechanisms behind jailbreaks based\non the Linear Representation Hypothesis (LRH), which states that neural\nnetworks encode high-level concepts as subspaces in their hidden\nrepresentations. We define the toxic semantics in harmful and jailbreak prompts\nas toxic concepts and describe the semantics in jailbreak prompts that\nmanipulate LLMs to comply with unsafe requests as jailbreak concepts. Through\nconcept extraction and analysis, we reveal that LLMs can recognize the toxic\nconcepts in both harmful and jailbreak prompts. However, unlike harmful\nprompts, jailbreak prompts activate the jailbreak concepts and alter the LLM\noutput from rejection to compliance. Building on our analysis, we propose a\ncomprehensive jailbreak defense framework, JBShield, consisting of two key\ncomponents: jailbreak detection JBShield-D and mitigation JBShield-M.\nJBShield-D identifies jailbreak prompts by determining whether the input\nactivates both toxic and jailbreak concepts. When a jailbreak prompt is\ndetected, JBShield-M adjusts the hidden representations of the target LLM by\nenhancing the toxic concept and weakening the jailbreak concept, ensuring LLMs\nproduce safe content. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior\nperformance of JBShield, achieving an average detection accuracy of 0.95 and\nreducing the average attack success rate of various jailbreak attacks to 2%\nfrom 61% across distinct LLMs.",

To\nfurther improve the efficiency, we propose an Instance-dependent Early Stopping\n(IES) method that adapts the early stopping mechanism from the entire training\nset to the instance level, based on the core principle that once the model has\nmastered an instance, the training on it should stop. IES considers an instance\nas mastered if the second-order differences of its loss value remain within a\nsmall range around zero. This offers a more consistent measure of an instance's\nlearning status compared with directly using the loss value, and thus allows\nfor a unified threshold to determine when an instance can be excluded from\nfurther backpropagation. We show that excluding mastered instances from\nbackpropagation can increase the gradient norms, thereby accelerating the\ndecrease of the training loss and speeding up the training process. Extensive\nexperiments on benchmarks demonstrate that IES method can reduce\nbackpropagation instances by 10%-50% while maintaining or even slightly\nimproving the test accuracy and transfer learning performance of a model.",

Previous game-theoretical studies have predominantly\nrelied on hard-manner models, where cooperation is triggered only upon reaching\na specific threshold. However, this approach contrasts with the observed\nflexibility of human behaviors, where individuals adapt their strategies\ndynamically based on their surroundings. To capture this adaptability, we\nintroduce a soft form of conditional cooperation by integrating the Q-learning\nalgorithm from reinforcement learning. In this form, players not only\nreciprocate mutual cooperation but may also defect in highly cooperative\nenvironments or cooperate in less cooperative settings to maximize rewards. To\nexplore the effects of hard and soft conditional cooperators, we examine their\ninteractions in two scenarios: structural mixture (SM) and probabilistic\nmixture (PM), where the two behavioral modes are fixed and probabilistically\nadopted, respectively. In SM, hard conditional cooperators enhance cooperation\nwhen the threshold is low but hinder it otherwise. Surprisingly, in PM, the\ncooperation prevalence exhibits two first-order phase transitions as the\nprobability is varied, leading to high, low, and vanishing levels of\ncooperation. Analysis of Q-tables offers insights into the \"psychological\nshifts\" of soft conditional cooperators and the overall evolutionary dynamics.\nModel extensions confirm the robustness of our findings.

Current approaches for incorporating physical priors\nmitigate these issues by penalizing deviations from known physical laws, as in\nphysics-informed neural networks, or by designing architectures that\nautomatically satisfy specific invariants. However, penalization approaches do\nnot guarantee compliance with physical constraints for unseen inputs, and\ninvariant-based methods lack flexibility and generality.

Our\nmethod is demonstrated on two systems: a spring-mass system and a\nlow-temperature reactive plasma.

    "abstract": "Transfers in professional football (soccer) are risky investments because of\nthe large transfer fees and high risks involved. Although data-driven models\ncan be used to improve transfer decisions, existing models focus on describing\nplayers' historical progress, leaving their future performance unknown.\nMoreover, recent developments have called for the use of explainable models\ncombined with uncertainty quantification of predictions. This paper assesses\nexplainable machine learning models based on predictive accuracy and\nuncertainty quantification methods for the prediction of the future development\nin quality and transfer value of professional football players. The predictive\naccuracy is studied by training the models to predict the quality and value of\nplayers one year ahead. This is carried out by training them on two data sets\ncontaining data-driven indicators describing the player quality and player\nvalue in historical settings. In general, the random forest model is found to\nbe the most suitable model because it provides accurate predictions as well as\nan uncertainty quantification method that naturally arises from the bagging\nprocedure of the random forest model. Additionally, this research shows that\nthe development of player performance contains nonlinear patterns and\ninteractions between variables, and that time series information can provide\nuseful information for the modeling of player performance metrics. The\nresulting models can help football clubs make more informed, data-driven\ntransfer decisions by forecasting player quality and transfer value.",

    "abstract": "Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) aims to measure non-contact physiological\nsignals from facial videos, which has shown great potential in many\napplications. Most existing methods directly extract video-based rPPG features\nby designing neural networks for heart rate estimation. Although they can\nachieve acceptable results, the recovery of rPPG signal faces intractable\nchallenges when interference from real-world scenarios takes place on facial\nvideo. Specifically, facial videos are inevitably affected by non-physiological\nfactors (e.g., camera device noise, defocus, and motion blur), leading to the\ndistortion of extracted rPPG signals. Recent rPPG extraction methods are easily\naffected by interference and degradation, resulting in noisy rPPG signals. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel method named CodePhys, which innovatively treats\nrPPG measurement as a code query task in a noise-free proxy space (i.e.,\ncodebook) constructed by ground-truth PPG signals. We consider noisy rPPG\nfeatures as queries and generate high-fidelity rPPG features by matching them\nwith noise-free PPG features from the codebook. Our approach also incorporates\na spatial-aware encoder network with a spatial attention mechanism to highlight\nphysiologically active areas and uses a distillation loss to reduce the\ninfluence of non-periodic visual interference. Experimental results on four\nbenchmark datasets demonstrate that CodePhys outperforms state-of-the-art\nmethods in both intra-dataset and cross-dataset settings.",

The\nnumerical flux is carefully constructed to maintain the same\nCourant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) numbers as cRKDG methods and achieve optimal\naccuracy uniformly across all polynomial degrees, even for problems with sonic\npoints. A subcell-based blending limiter is then applied for problems with\nnonsmooth solutions, which uses Gauss-Legendre solution points and performs\nMUSCL-Hancock reconstruction on subcells to mitigate the additional dissipation\nerrors. Additionally, to achieve a fully admissibility-preserving cRKFR scheme,\na flux limiter is applied to the time-averaged numerical flux to ensure\nadmissibility preservation in the means, combined with a positivity-preserving\nscaling limiter.

This study presents the first systematic attempt to\nidentify prompts and text tokens in MIMIC-CXR that contribute the most to\ntraining data memorization. Our analysis reveals two unexpected findings: (1)\nprompts containing traces of de-identification procedures (markers introduced\nto hide Protected Health Information) are the most memorized, and (2) among all\ntokens, de-identification markers contribute the most towards memorization.\nThis highlights a broader issue with the standard anonymization practices and\nT2I synthesis with MIMIC-CXR.

    "abstract": "This study explores the impact of boron carbide (B4C) addition on magnetic\ndomains within Fe/Si multilayers through off-specular neutron scattering with\npolarization analysis. The incorporation of B4C induces amorphization in\nlayers, disrupting magnetic domain structures. Analysis of the scattering\npatterns reveals that magnetic domains in pure Fe/Si multilayers exhibit no\nsignificant correlation between layers, resulting in a specific diffuse\noff-specular scattering signal, while the B4C incorporated Fe/Si multilayers\nrevealed no diffuse off-specular scattering. We offer a qualitative\ninterpretation of these scattering phenomena and accurately model the observed\ndiffuse patterns using the distorted wave Born approximation. Low-energy\n{\\mu}+SR measurements further reveal that local magnetic fields in Fe/Si and\nFe/Si + B4C multilayers are more easily manipulated by external fields in\nB4C-containing layers, with enhanced field uniformity in the muon length-scale.\nOur findings provide insights into the role of B4C in altering magnetic domain\narrangements within Fe/Si multilayers, contributing to advances in the design\nof magnetic materials and neutron polarization coatings.",

However, its regret upper bound exhibits a complexity of $O(KC)$,\nwhile the lower bound is $\\Omega(C)$. In this paper, we enhance the BARBAR\nalgorithm by proposing a novel framework called BARBAT, which eliminates the\nfactor of $K$ and achieves an optimal regret bound up to a logarithmic factor.\nWe also demonstrate how BARBAT can be extended to various settings, including\ngraph bandits, combinatorial semi-bandits, batched bandits and multi-agent\nbandits.

X-ray and neutron reflectivity techniques reveal that\n11B4C incorporation improves interface sharpness, reduces roughness, and\nenhances reflectivity for all multilayer periods. Neutron reflectivity\nmeasurements show reduced spin-flip intensities, while wafer-curvature\nmeasurements indicate a 50% reduction in internal stress, allowing for higher\nmechanical stability of the multilayers. These improvements are attributed to\nthe amorphization of Fe layers, which also suppress the formation of structural\nand magnetic domains responsible for stress and spin-flip scattering.

In\nparallel, radio environment, which can be manifested by channel knowledge such\nas the distribution of received signal strength (RSS), reveals signal\npropagation situation and the corresponding obstacle information. However, the\nawareness of the radio environment for obstacle sensing is challenging in\npractice, as the sparsely deployed THz sensors can acquire only little a priori\nknowledge with their RSS measurements. Therefore, we formulate in this paper a\nradio environment awareness problem, which for the first time considers a\nprobability distribution of obstacle attributes.

It also generalizes\nbeyond pure language tasks, delivering gains in multimodal systems, including a\n+2% improvement in 0-shot ImageNet accuracy for SigLIP-B/16. Additionally, by\nderiving data scaling laws, we show that RINS improves both the asymptotic\nperformance limits and the scaling exponents.

    "abstract": "[Context and Motivation]: Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) have become relevant\nin a wide variety of different domains, integrating hardware and software,\noften operating in an emerging and uncertain environment where human actors\nactively or passively engage with the CPS. To ensure correct and safe\noperation, and self-adaptation, monitors are used for collecting and analyzing\ndiverse runtime information. [Problem]: However, monitoring humans at runtime,\ncollecting potentially sensitive information about their actions and behavior,\ncomes with significant ramifications that can severely hamper the successful\nintegration of human-machine collaboration. Requirements engineering (RE)\nactivities must integrate diverse human values, including Privacy, Security,\nand Self-Direction during system design, to avoid involuntary data sharing or\nmisuse. [Principal Ideas]: In this research preview, we focus on the importance\nof incorporating these aspects in the RE lifecycle of eliciting and creating\nruntime monitors. [Contribution]: We derived an initial conceptual framework,\nbuilding on the value taxonomy introduced by Schwartz and human value\nintegrated Software Engineering by Whittle, further leveraging the concept of\nvalue tactics. The goal is to tie functional and non-functional monitoring\nrequirements to human values and establish traceability between values,\nrequirements, and actors. Based on this, we lay out a research roadmap guiding\nour ongoing work in this area.",

    "abstract": "Recent advancement in code understanding and generation demonstrates that\ncode LLMs fine-tuned on a high-quality instruction dataset can gain powerful\ncapabilities to address wide-ranging code-related tasks. However, most previous\nexisting methods mainly view each programming language in isolation and ignore\nthe knowledge transfer among different programming languages. To bridge the gap\namong different programming languages, we introduce a novel multi-agent\ncollaboration framework to enhance multilingual instruction tuning for code\nLLMs, where multiple language-specific intelligent agent components with\ngeneration memory work together to transfer knowledge from one language to\nanother efficiently and effectively. Specifically, we first generate the\nlanguage-specific instruction data from the code snippets and then provide the\ngenerated data as the seed data for language-specific agents. Multiple\nlanguage-specific agents discuss and collaborate to formulate a new instruction\nand its corresponding solution (A new programming language or existing\nprogramming language), To further encourage the cross-lingual transfer, each\nagent stores its generation history as memory and then summarizes its merits\nand faults. Finally, the high-quality multilingual instruction data is used to\nencourage knowledge transfer among different programming languages to train\nQwen2.5-xCoder. Experimental results on multilingual programming benchmarks\ndemonstrate the superior performance of Qwen2.5-xCoder in sharing common\nknowledge, highlighting its potential to reduce the cross-lingual gap.",

    "abstract": "Road information extraction from 3D point clouds is useful for urban planning\nand traffic management. Existing methods often rely on local features and the\nrefraction angle of lasers from kerbs, which makes them sensitive to variable\nkerb designs and issues in high-density areas due to data homogeneity. We\npropose an approach for extracting road points and fitting centrelines using a\ntop-down view of LiDAR based ground-collected point clouds. This prospective\nview reduces reliance on specific kerb design and results in better road\nextraction. We first perform statistical outlier removal and density-based\nclustering to reduce noise from 3D point cloud data. Next, we perform ground\npoint filtering using a grid-based segmentation method that adapts to diverse\nroad scenarios and terrain characteristics. The filtered points are then\nprojected onto a 2D plane, and the road is extracted by a skeletonisation\nalgorithm. The skeleton is back-projected onto the 3D point cloud with\ncalculated normals, which guide a region growing algorithm to find nearby road\npoints. The extracted road points are then smoothed with the Savitzky-Golay\nfilter to produce the final centreline. Our initial approach without\npost-processing of road skeleton achieved 67% in IoU by testing on the Perth\nCBD dataset with different road types. Incorporating the post-processing of the\nroad skeleton improved the extraction of road points around the smoothed\nskeleton. The refined approach achieved a higher IoU value of 73% and with 23%\nreduction in the processing time. Our approach offers a generalised and\ncomputationally efficient solution that combines 3D and 2D processing\ntechniques, laying the groundwork for future road reconstruction and 3D-to-2D\npoint cloud alignment.",

Our results highlight how even\nclassical interpolating methods can exhibit intricate generalization behaviors.\nIn addition, for the purpose of tuning the hyperparameter, the results suggest\nthat over-estimating the intrinsic dimension of the data is less harmful than\nunder-estimating it.

One of these areas is condition monitoring, where the vibration\nsignals from rotating machines naturally display periodic behavior. Thus, the\ncyclostationary analysis has evolved into the investigation of such signals.\nFor the traditional cyclostationary approaches, the autocovariance function\n(ACVF) and its bi-frequency representation, spectral coherence (SC), are\nregarded as the base. However, recent research has revealed that real vibration\nsignals increasingly exhibit impulsive behavior in addition to periodicity. As\na result, there was a need for new methods to identify periodic behavior that\ntake into account the impulsiveness of the data. In this article, we provide a\nway to improve the SC method by using its robust variants in place of the\nclassical ACVF estimator (sample ACVF). The suggested concept is intuitive and\nrelatively simple.

The key challenge lies in simultaneously achieving high precision\nand large-range movements while maintaining a constant stable grasp.

A major roadblock to achieving commercially viable fusion\npower is understanding plasma turbulence, which can significantly degrade\nplasma confinement. Modelling turbulence is crucial to design performing plasma\nscenarios for next-generation reactor-class devices and current experimental\nmachines. The nonlinear gyrokinetic equation underpinning turbulence modelling\nevolves a 5D distribution function over time. Solving this equation numerically\nis extremely expensive, requiring up to weeks for a single run to converge,\nmaking it unfeasible for iterative optimisation and control studies.

This phenomenon, known as\ninformation scrambling, is closely related to entropy growth and quantum\nthermalization. Recent studies have shown that dissipation in open systems can\nhinder information scrambling, driving the system into a dissipative phase when\nthe system-bath coupling is strong. However, the signature of this scrambling\ntransition in entropy dynamics remains unexplored. In this work, we unveil a\nnovel phenomenon in open quantum systems, termed entropy accumulation, which\noccurs exclusively within the scrambling phase. We consider a setup in which a\nprobe is weakly coupled to a system that is already interacting with a bath. We\ncalculate the increase in the second R\\'enyi entropy induced by an external\nimpulse on the system, after tracing out the probe. Despite the system-probe\ncoupling being weak, the entropy continues to increase and eventually saturates\nat a finite value due to operator growth. In contrast, the entropy increase is\nlimited by the coupling strength in the dissipative phase. The theoretical\nprediction is derived from both general arguments and an explicit example using\ngeneralized Boltzmann equations. Our results offer new insights into the\nintriguing relationship between entropy dynamics and information scrambling in\nopen quantum systems.",

Over-the-air (OTA) control has emerged as a\nspectrum-efficient approach, leveraging electromagnetic superposition to form\ncontrol signals at a base station (BS). However, existing OTA controllers lack\nsufficient optimization variables to meet UAV swarm control objectives and fail\nto integrate control with other BS functions like sensing. This work proposes\nan integrated sensing and OTA control framework (ISAC-OTA) for UAV swarm. The\nBS performs OTA signal construction (uplink) and dispatch (downlink) while\nsimultaneously sensing objects. Two uplink post-processing methods are\ndeveloped: a control-centric approach generating closed-form control signals\nvia a feedback-looped OTA control problem, and a sensing-centric method\nmitigating transmission-induced interference for accurate object sensing. For\nthe downlink, a non-convex problem is formulated and solved to minimize control\nsignal dispatch (transmission) error while maintaining a minimum sensing\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Simulation results show that the proposed ISAC-OTA\ncontroller achieves control performance comparable to the benchmark optimal\ncontrol algorithm while maintaining high sensing accuracy, despite OTA\ntransmission interference.

Current methods that preserve\nthe PC correlation structure resample the original time series, selecting block\nsize to preserve one PC component frequency while simultaneously and\nunnecessarily resampling all frequencies. This destroys PC components at other\nfrequencies. VMBPBB uses bandpass filters to separate each PC component,\ncreating a set of PC component time series each composed principally of one\ncomponent. VMBPBB then resamples each PC component time series, not the\noriginal MPC time series, with the respective block size preserving the\ncorrelation structure of each PC component. Finally, VMBPBB aggregates the PC\ncomponent bootstraps to form a bootstrap of the MPC time series, successfully\npreserving all correlations.

    "abstract": "In semi-supervised medical image segmentation, the poor quality of unlabeled\ndata and the uncertainty in the model's predictions lead to models that\ninevitably produce erroneous pseudo-labels. These errors accumulate throughout\nmodel training, thereby weakening the model's performance. We found that these\nerroneous pseudo-labels are typically concentrated in high-uncertainty regions.\nTraditional methods improve performance by directly discarding pseudo-labels in\nthese regions, but this can also result in neglecting potentially valuable\ntraining data. To alleviate this problem, we propose a bidirectional\nuncertainty-aware region learning strategy. In training labeled data, we focus\non high-uncertainty regions, using precise label information to guide the\nmodel's learning in potentially uncontrollable areas. Meanwhile, in the\ntraining of unlabeled data, we concentrate on low-uncertainty regions to reduce\nthe interference of erroneous pseudo-labels on the model. Through this\nbidirectional learning strategy, the model's overall performance has\nsignificantly improved.

Estimating\nand respecting personal space is essential for enhancing human-computer\ninteraction (HCI) and smart environments. Personal space preferences vary due\nto individual traits, cultural background, and contextual factors. Advanced\nmultimodal sensing technologies, including eye-tracking and wristband sensors,\noffer opportunities to develop adaptive systems that dynamically adjust to user\ncomfort levels. Integrating physiological and behavioral data enables a deeper\nunderstanding of spatial interactions. This study develops a sensor-based model\nto estimate comfortable personal space and identifies key features influencing\nspatial preferences. Our findings show that multimodal sensors, particularly\neye-tracking and physiological wristband data, can effectively predict personal\nspace preferences, with eye-tracking data playing a more significant role. An\nexperimental study involving controlled human interactions demonstrates that a\nTransformer-based model achieves the highest predictive accuracy (F1 score:\n0.87) for estimating personal space. Eye-tracking features, such as gaze point\nand pupil diameter, emerge as the most significant predictors, while\nphysiological signals from wristband sensors contribute marginally. These\nresults highlight the potential for AI-driven personalization of social space\nin adaptive environments, suggesting that multimodal sensing can be leveraged\nto develop intelligent systems that optimize spatial arrangements in\nworkplaces, educational institutions, and public settings.

However, several challenges underscore the urgent need\nto explore modified gravity theories. GR struggles to reconcile with quantum\nmechanics, fails to provide fundamental explanations for dark matter and dark\nenergy, and faces limitations in describing extreme regimes such as black hole\nsingularities and the very early universe. This review provides an organized\nperspective on modified gravity theories by classifying them based on the\nprinciples of GR they preserve or violate. Specifically, we consider three\nbroad categories: (1) metric theories that uphold local Lorentz invariance\n(LLI) and gauge invariance, (2) theories that break gauge invariance, LLI, or\nparity, and (3) beyond-metric theories that violate the Einstein's equivalence\nprinciple (EEP). This classification highlights the underlying assumptions of\nGR that these theories challenge or extend, providing a framework for\nunderstanding their motivations and implications. The review also discusses the\ncurrent and upcoming experimental and observational tests of GR, including\nthose probing its foundational principles, such as LLI, gauge invariance, and\nEEP. For each class of modified theories, we examine their ability to address\ncritical open questions in cosmology and black hole physics. These include\ntheir potential to explain the accelerated expansion of the current universe,\nthe nature of dark matter, and deviations in black hole dynamics from GR\npredictions. This review aims to provide a structured understanding of modified\ngravity theories and their observational implications in the multimessenger era\nby focusing on the principles preserved or violated.

However, traditional PINN models are typically\ndesigned for single PDEs, limiting their generalizability across different\nphysical systems. In this work, we explore the potential of a foundation PINN\nmodel capable of solving multiple PDEs within a unified architecture. We\ninvestigate the efficacy of a single PINN framework trained on four distinct\nPDEs-the Simple Harmonic Oscillator (SHO), the 1D Heat Equation, the 1D Wave\nEquation, and the 2D Laplace Equation, demonstrating its ability to learn\ndiverse physical dynamics.\n  To enhance sample efficiency, we incorporate Active Learning (AL) using Monte\nCarlo (MC) Dropout-based uncertainty estimation, selecting the most informative\ntraining samples iteratively. We evaluate different active learning strategies,\ncomparing models trained on 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, and 50% of the full dataset,\nand analyze their impact on solution accuracy. Our results indicate that\ntargeted uncertainty sampling significantly improves performance with fewer\ntraining samples, leading to efficient learning across multiple PDEs.\n  This work highlights the feasibility of a generalizable PINN-based foundation\nmodel, capable of adapting to different physics-based problems without\nredesigning network architectures.

CTAO studies the high-energy universe by observing gamma rays\nemitted by violent phenomena (supernovae, black hole environments, etc.). These\ngamma rays produce an atmospheric shower when entering the atmosphere, which\nemits faint blue light, observed by CTAO's highly sensitive cameras. The event\nreconstruction consists of analyzing the images produced by the telescopes to\nretrieve the physical properties of the incident particle (mainly direction,\nenergy, and type). A standard method for performing this reconstruction\nconsists of combining traditional image parameter calculations with machine\nlearning algorithms, such as random forests, to estimate the particle's energy\nand class probability for each telescope. A second step, called stereoscopy,\ncombines these monoscopic reconstructions into a global one using weighted\naverages.

    "abstract": "The perception system is a a critical role of an autonomous driving system\nfor ensuring safety. The driving scene perception system fundamentally\nrepresents an object detection task that requires achieving a balance between\naccuracy and processing speed. Many contemporary methods focus on improving\ndetection accuracy but often overlook the importance of real-time detection\ncapabilities when computational resources are limited. Thus, it is vital to\ninvestigate efficient object detection strategies for driving scenes. This\npaper introduces Fast-COS, a novel single-stage object detection framework\ncrafted specifically for driving scene applications. The research initiates\nwith an analysis of the backbone, considering both macro and micro\narchitectural designs, yielding the Reparameterized Attention Vision\nTransformer (RAViT). RAViT utilizes Reparameterized Multi-Scale Depth-Wise\nConvolution (RepMSDW) and Reparameterized Self-Attention (RepSA) to enhance\ncomputational efficiency and feature extraction. In extensive tests across GPU,\nedge, and mobile platforms, RAViT achieves 81.4% Top-1 accuracy on the\nImageNet-1K dataset, demonstrating significant throughput improvements over\ncomparable backbone models such as ResNet, FastViT, RepViT, and\nEfficientFormer. Additionally, integrating RepMSDW into a feature pyramid\nnetwork forms RepFPN, enabling fast and multi-scale feature fusion. Fast-COS\nenhances object detection in driving scenes, attaining an AP50 score of 57.2%\non the BDD100K dataset and 80.0% on the TJU-DHD Traffic dataset. It surpasses\nleading models in efficiency, delivering up to 75.9% faster GPU inference and\n1.38 higher throughput on edge devices compared to FCOS, YOLOF, and RetinaNet.\nThese findings establish Fast-COS as a highly scalable and reliable solution\nsuitable for real-time applications, especially in resource-limited\nenvironments like autonomous driving systems",

Traditional approaches\nassume the correctness of all governing equations, including potentially\nunreliable constitutive laws, which can lead to biased estimates and\nmisinterpretations. Our proposed framework addresses this limitation by\ndistinguishing between reliable governing equations, such as conservation laws,\nand uncertain constitutive relationships. By treating all state variables as\nlatent random variables, we enforce these equations through separate sets of\nresiduals, leveraging a virtual likelihood approach with weighted residuals.\nThis formulation not only identifies regions where constitutive laws break down\nbut also improves robustness against model uncertainties without relying on a\nfully trustworthy forward model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our\napproach in the context of elastography, showing that it provides a structured,\ninterpretable, and computationally efficient alternative to traditional model\nerror correction techniques. Our findings suggest that the proposed framework\nenhances the accuracy and reliability of material property estimation by\noffering a principled way to incorporate uncertainty in constitutive modeling.",

Inspired by traditional importance weighting and\npropensity weighting methods, prior approaches employ an independence-based\nsample reweighting procedure. They aim at decorrelating covariates to\ncounteract the bias introduced by spurious correlations between unstable\nvariables and the outcome, thus enhancing generalization and fulfilling stable\nprediction under covariate shift. Nonetheless, these methods are prone to\nexperiencing an inflation of variance, primarily attributable to the reduced\nefficacy in utilizing training samples during the reweighting process. Existing\nremedies necessitate either environmental labels or substantially higher time\ncosts along with additional assumptions and supervised information. To mitigate\nthis issue, we propose SAmple Weight Averaging (SAWA), a simple yet efficacious\nstrategy that can be universally integrated into various sample reweighting\nalgorithms to decrease the variance and coefficient estimation error, thus\nboosting the covariate-shift generalization and achieving stable prediction\nacross different environments.

The puzzle's difficulty is set by the difficulty\nadjustment mechanism (DAM), based on the network's available mining power.\nAttacks that destroy some portion of mining power can exploit the DAM to lower\ndifficulty, making such attacks profitable. In this paper, we analyze three\ntypes of mining power destruction attacks in the presence of petty-compliant\nmining pools: selfish mining, bribery, and mining power distraction attacks. We\nanalyze selfish mining while accounting for the distribution of mining power\namong pools, a factor often overlooked in the literature. Our findings indicate\nthat selfish mining can be more destructive when the non-adversarial mining\nshare is well distributed among pools. We also introduce a novel bribery\nattack, where the adversarial pool bribes petty-compliant pools to orphan\nothers' blocks. For small pools, we demonstrate that the bribery attack can\ndominate strategies like selfish mining or undercutting. Lastly, we present the\nmining distraction attack, where the adversarial pool incentivizes\npetty-compliant pools to abandon Bitcoin's puzzle and mine for a simpler\npuzzle, thus wasting some part of their mining power. Similar to the previous\nattacks, this attack can lower the mining difficulty, but with the difference\nthat it does not generate any evidence of mining power destruction, such as\norphan blocks.",

    "abstract": "Agent-based models (ABMs) and video games, including those taking advantage\nof virtual reality (VR), have undergone a remarkable parallel evolution,\nachieving impressive levels of complexity and sophistication. This paper argues\nthat while ABMs prioritize scientific analysis and understanding and VR aims\nfor immersive entertainment, they both simulate artificial worlds and can\nbenefit from closer integration. Coupling both approaches indeed opens\ninteresting possibilities for research and development in various fields, and\nin particular education, at the heart of the SIMPLE project, an EU-funded\nproject on the development of digital tools for awareness raising on\nenvironmental issues. However, existing tools often present limitations,\nincluding technical complexity, limited functionalities, and lack of\ninteroperability. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel framework\nfor linking GAMA, a popular ABM platform, with Unity, a widely used game\nengine. This framework enables seamless data exchange, real-time visualization,\nand user interaction within VR environments, allowing researchers to leverage\nthe strengths of both ABMs and VR for more impactful and engaging simulations.\nWe demonstrate the capabilities of our framework through two prototypes built\nto highlight its potential in representing and interacting with complex\nsocio-environmental system models. We conclude by emphasizing the importance of\ncontinued collaboration between the ABM and VR communities to develop robust,\nuser-friendly tools, paving the way for a new era of collaborative research and\nimmersive experiences in simulations.",

    "abstract": "Human-in-the-loop (HITL) frameworks are increasingly recognized for their\npotential to improve annotation accuracy in emotion estimation systems by\ncombining machine predictions with human expertise. This study focuses on\nintegrating a high-performing image-based emotion model into a HITL annotation\nframework to evaluate the collaborative potential of human-machine interaction\nand identify the psychological and practical factors critical to successful\ncollaboration. Specifically, we investigate how varying model reliability and\ncognitive framing influence human trust, cognitive load, and annotation\nbehavior in HITL systems. We demonstrate that model reliability and\npsychological framing significantly impact annotators' trust, engagement, and\nconsistency, offering insights into optimizing HITL frameworks. Through three\nexperimental scenarios with 29 participants--baseline model reliability (S1),\nfabricated errors (S2), and cognitive bias introduced by negative framing\n(S3)--we analyzed behavioral and qualitative data. Reliable predictions in S1\nyielded high trust and annotation consistency, while unreliable outputs in S2\nled to increased critical evaluations but also heightened frustration and\nresponse variability. Negative framing in S3 revealed how cognitive bias\ninfluenced participants to perceive the model as more relatable and accurate,\ndespite misinformation regarding its reliability. These findings highlight the\nimportance of both reliable machine outputs and psychological factors in\nshaping effective human-machine collaboration. By leveraging the strengths of\nboth human oversight and automated systems, this study establishes a scalable\nHITL framework for emotion annotation and lays the foundation for broader\napplications in adaptive learning and human-computer interaction.",

    "abstract": "Wide coverage and high-precision rural household wealth data is an important\nsupport for the effective connection between the national macro rural\nrevitalization policy and micro rural entities, which helps to achieve precise\nallocation of national resources. However, due to the large number and wide\ndistribution of rural areas, wealth data is difficult to collect and scarce in\nquantity. Therefore, this article attempts to integrate \"sky\" remote sensing\nimages with \"ground\" village street view imageries to construct a fine-grained\n\"computable\" technical route for rural household wealth. With the intelligent\ninterpretation of rural houses as the core, the relevant wealth elements of\nimage data were extracted and identified, and regressed with the household\nwealth indicators of the benchmark questionnaire to form a high-precision\ntownship scale wealth prediction model (r=0.85); Furthermore, a national and\ntownship scale map of rural household wealth in China was promoted and drawn.\nBased on this, this article finds that there is a \"bimodal\" pattern in the\ndistribution of wealth among rural households in China, which is reflected in a\npolarization feature of \"high in the south and low in the north, and high in\nthe east and low in the west\" in space. This technological route may provide\nalternative solutions with wider spatial coverage and higher accuracy for\nhigh-cost manual surveys, promote the identification of shortcomings in rural\nconstruction, and promote the precise implementation of rural policies.",

Despite much recent progress, the\nmajority of 3D imaging hardware remains bulky and complicated and provides much\nlower image resolution compared to their 2D counterparts. Moreover, there are\nmany well-known scenarios that existing 3D imaging solutions frequently fail.\nHere, we introduce an extended monocular 3D imaging (EM3D) framework that fully\nexploits the vectorial wave nature of light. Via the multi-stage fusion of\ndiffraction- and polarization-based depth cues, using a compact monocular\ncamera equipped with a diffractive-refractive hybrid lens, we experimentally\ndemonstrate the snapshot acquisition of a million-pixel and accurate 3D point\ncloud for extended scenes that are traditionally challenging, including those\nwith low texture, being highly reflective, or nearly transparent, without a\ndata prior. Furthermore, we discover that the combination of depth and\npolarization information can unlock unique new opportunities in material\nidentification, which may further expand machine intelligence for applications\nlike target recognition and face anti-spoofing. The straightforward yet\npowerful architecture thus opens up a new path for a higher-dimensional machine\nvision in a minimal form factor, facilitating the deployment of monocular\ncameras for applications in much more diverse scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Sarcasm is a linguistic phenomenon that intends to ridicule a target (e.g.,\nentity, event, or person) in an inherent way. Multimodal Sarcasm Explanation\n(MuSE) aims at revealing the intended irony in a sarcastic post using a natural\nlanguage explanation. Though important, existing systems overlooked the\nsignificance of the target of sarcasm in generating explanations. In this\npaper, we propose a Target-aUgmented shaRed fusion-Based sarcasm explanatiOn\nmodel, aka. TURBO. We design a novel shared-fusion mechanism to leverage the\ninter-modality relationships between an image and its caption. TURBO assumes\nthe target of the sarcasm and guides the multimodal shared fusion mechanism in\nlearning intricacies of the intended irony for explanations. We evaluate our\nproposed TURBO model on the MORE+ dataset. Comparison against multiple\nbaselines and state-of-the-art models signifies the performance improvement of\nTURBO by an average margin of $+3.3\\%$. Moreover, we explore LLMs in zero and\none-shot settings for our task and observe that LLM-generated explanation,\nthough remarkable, often fails to capture the critical nuances of the sarcasm.\nFurthermore, we supplement our study with extensive human evaluation on TURBO's\ngenerated explanations and find them out to be comparatively better than other\nsystems.",

Typically, these methods are based on the manual\ninterpretation of ECG signals, which is time consuming and depends on the\nexpertise of healthcare professionals. The objective of this work is to propose\na deep learning system, FADE, designed for normal ECG forecasting and anomaly\ndetection, which reduces the need for extensive labeled datasets and manual\ninterpretation. FADE has been trained in a self-supervised manner with a novel\nmorphological inspired loss function. Unlike conventional models that learn\nfrom labeled anomalous ECG waveforms, our approach predicts the future of\nnormal ECG signals, thus avoiding the need for extensive labeled datasets.\nUsing a novel distance function to compare forecasted ECG signals with actual\nsensor data, our method effectively identifies cardiac anomalies. Additionally,\nthis approach can be adapted to new contexts through domain adaptation\ntechniques. To evaluate our proposal, we performed a set of experiments using\ntwo publicly available datasets: MIT-BIH NSR and MIT-BIH Arrythmia. The results\ndemonstrate that our system achieves an average accuracy of 83.84% in anomaly\ndetection, while correctly classifying normal ECG signals with an accuracy of\n85.46%. Our proposed approach exhibited superior performance in the early\ndetection of cardiac anomalies in ECG signals, surpassing previous methods that\npredominantly identify a limited range of anomalies.

Although video super-resolution (VSR) is an efficient\nvideo enhancing technique, existing VSR methods focus less on compressed\nvideos. Consequently, directly applying general VSR approaches fails to improve\npractical videos with compression artifacts, especially when frames are highly\ncompressed at a low bit rate. The inevitable quantization information loss\ncomplicates the reconstruction of texture details. Recently, diffusion models\nhave shown superior performance in low-level visual tasks. Leveraging the\nhigh-realism generation capability of diffusion models, we propose a novel\nmethod that exploits the priors of pre-trained diffusion models for compressed\nVSR. To mitigate spatial distortions and refine temporal consistency, we\nintroduce a Spatial Degradation-Aware and Temporal Consistent (SDATC) diffusion\nmodel. Specifically, we incorporate a distortion control module (DCM) to\nmodulate diffusion model inputs, thereby minimizing the impact of noise from\nlow-quality frames on the generation stage. Subsequently, the diffusion model\nperforms a denoising process to generate details, guided by a fine-tuned\ncompression-aware prompt module (CAPM) and a spatio-temporal attention module\n(STAM). CAPM dynamically encodes compression-related information into prompts,\nenabling the sampling process to adapt to different degradation levels.\nMeanwhile, STAM extends the spatial attention mechanism into the\nspatio-temporal dimension, effectively capturing temporal correlations.\nAdditionally, we utilize optical flow-based alignment during each denoising\nstep to enhance the smoothness of output videos.

Hence, we collect and empirically analyze almost 600,000 food-related\nposts and uncover differences in nutritional content between engaging and\nnon-engaging posts. Moreover, we train a series of XGBoost models, and evaluate\nthe importance of nutritional density while predicting whether users will\ncomment on a post or whether a post will substantially resonate with the\ncommunity. We find that nutritional features improve the baseline model's\naccuracy by 4%, with a positive contribution of calorie density towards\nprediction of engagement, suggesting that higher nutritional content is\nassociated with higher user engagement in food-related posts. Our results\nprovide valuable insights for the design of more engaging online initiatives\naimed at, for example, encouraging healthy eating habits.",

However, the training techniques and data requirements to\nelicit Long CoT remain poorly understood. In this work, we find that a Large\nLanguage model (LLM) can effectively learn Long CoT reasoning through\ndata-efficient supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and parameter-efficient low-rank\nadaptation (LoRA). With just 17k long CoT training samples, the\nQwen2.5-32B-Instruct model achieves significant improvements on a wide range of\nmath and coding benchmarks, including 56.7% (+40.0%) on AIME 2024 and 57.0%\n(+8.1%) on LiveCodeBench, competitive to the proprietary o1-preview model's\nscore of 44.6% and 59.1%. More importantly, we find that the structure of Long\nCoT is critical to the learning process, whereas the content of individual\nreasoning steps has minimal impact. Perturbations affecting content, such as\ntraining on incorrect samples or removing reasoning keywords, have little\nimpact on performance. In contrast, structural modifications that disrupt\nlogical consistency in the Long CoT, such as shuffling or deleting reasoning\nsteps, significantly degrade accuracy. For example, a model trained on Long CoT\nsamples with incorrect answers still achieves only 3.2% lower accuracy compared\nto training with fully correct samples. These insights deepen our understanding\nof how to elicit reasoning capabilities in LLMs and highlight key\nconsiderations for efficiently training the next generation of reasoning\nmodels.

In the finite-length regime, the error\nprobability of BATS codes under belief propagation (BP) decoding has been\nstudied in the literature and can be analyzed by recursive formulae. However,\nall existing analyses have not considered precoding or have treated the BATS\ncode and the precode as two separate entities. In this paper, we analyze the\nword-wise error probability of finite-length BATS codes with a precode under\njoint decoding, including BP decoding and maximum-likelihood (ML) decoding. The\njoint BP decoder performs peeling decoding on a joint Tanner graph constructed\nfrom both the BATS and the precode Tanner graphs, and the joint ML decoder\nsolves a single linear system with all linear constraints implied by the BATS\ncode and the precode. We derive closed-form upper bounds on the error\nprobability for both decoders. Specifically, low-density parity-check (LDPC)\nprecodes are used for BP decoding, and any generic precode can be used for ML\ndecoding. Even for BATS codes without a precode, the derived upper bound for BP\ndecoding is more accurate than the approximate recursive formula, and easier to\ncompute than the exact recursive formula. The accuracy of the two upper bounds\nhas been verified by many simulation results. Based on the two upper bounds, we\nformulate an optimization problem to optimize the degree distribution of\nLDPC-precoded BATS codes, which improves BP performance, ML performance, or\nboth. In our experiments, to transmit 128 packets over a line network with\npacket loss, the optimized LDPC-precoded BATS codes reduce the transmission\noverhead to less than 50% of that of standard BATS codes under comparable\ndecoding complexity constraints.",

Conventional\nimaging techniques, such as X - rays, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic\nresonance imaging (MRI), offer static views of the spine. However, they are\nrestricted in capturing the dynamic changes of the spine and its interactions\nwith overall body motion. Therefore, developing new techniques to address these\nlimitations has become extremely important. Dynamic digital human modeling\nrepresents a major breakthrough in digital medicine. It enables a three -\ndimensional (3D) view of the spine as it changes during daily activities,\nassisting clinicians in detecting deformities that might be missed in static\nimaging. Although dynamic modeling holds great potential, constructing an\naccurate static digital human model is a crucial initial step for high -\nprecision simulations. In this study, our focus is on constructing an accurate\nstatic digital human model integrating the spine, which is vital for subsequent\ndynamic digital human research on AIS. First, we generate human point - cloud\ndata by combining the 3D Gaussian method with the Skinned Multi - Person Linear\n(SMPL) model from the patient's multi - view images. Then, we fit a standard\nskeletal model to the generated human model. Next, we align the real spine\nmodel reconstructed from CT images with the standard skeletal model. We\nvalidated the resulting personalized spine model using X - ray data from six\nAIS patients, with Cobb angles (used to measure the severity of scoliosis) as\nevaluation metrics.

Our analysis reveals\nthat the contribution of dilatational motion to energy transfer is due to three\ndifferent physical mechanisms: the interaction between dilatation and strain,\nbetween dilatation and vorticity, and the self-interaction of dilatational\nmotion across scales. By analyzing numerical simulations of flows at moderate\nturbulent Mach numbers ($Ma_t \\lesssim 0.3$), we validate our theoretical\nderivations and provide a quantitative description of the role of dilatational\nmotion in energy transfer. In particular, we determine the scaling dependence\nof the dilatational contributions on the turbulent Mach number. Moreover, our\nfindings reveal that the eddy-viscosity assumption often used in large-eddy\nsimulations, in the spirit of the approach used for incompressible flows,\neffectively neglects the interaction between solenoidal-dilatational energy\ntransfer and overestimate dilatational effects.",

    "abstract": "As artificial intelligence (AI) systems become increasingly embedded in\nethically sensitive domains such as education, healthcare, and transportation,\nthe need to balance accuracy and interpretability in decision-making has become\na central concern. Coarse Ethics (CE) is a theoretical framework that justifies\ncoarse-grained evaluations, such as letter grades or warning labels, as\nethically appropriate under cognitive and contextual constraints. However, CE\nhas lacked mathematical formalization. This paper introduces Coarse Set Theory\n(CST), a novel mathematical framework that models coarse-grained\ndecision-making using totally ordered structures and coarse partitions. CST\ndefines hierarchical relations among sets and uses information-theoretic tools,\nsuch as Kullback-Leibler Divergence, to quantify the trade-off between\nsimplification and information loss. We demonstrate CST through applications in\neducational grading and explainable AI (XAI), showing how it enables more\ntransparent and context-sensitive evaluations. By grounding coarse evaluations\nin set theory and probabilistic reasoning, CST contributes to the ethical\ndesign of interpretable AI systems.

    "abstract": "The rapid growth of the wind energy sector underscores the urgent need to\noptimize turbine operations and ensure effective maintenance through early\nfault detection systems. While traditional empirical and physics-based models\noffer approximate predictions of power generation based on wind speed, they\noften fail to capture the complex, non-linear relationships between other input\nvariables and the resulting power output. Data-driven machine learning methods\npresent a promising avenue for improving wind turbine modeling by leveraging\nlarge datasets, enhancing prediction accuracy but often at the cost of\ninterpretability. In this study, we propose a hybrid semi-parametric model that\ncombines the strengths of both approaches, applied to a dataset from a wind\nfarm with four turbines. The model integrates a physics-inspired submodel,\nproviding a reasonable approximation of power generation, with a non-parametric\nsubmodel that predicts the residuals. This non-parametric submodel is trained\non a broader range of variables to account for phenomena not captured by the\nphysics-based component. The hybrid model achieves a 37% improvement in\nprediction accuracy over the physics-based model. To enhance interpretability,\nSHAP values are used to analyze the influence of input features on the residual\nsubmodel's output. Additionally, prediction uncertainties are quantified using\na conformalized quantile regression method. The combination of these\ntechniques, alongside the physics grounding of the parametric submodel,\nprovides a flexible, accurate, and reliable framework.

It calculates similarity scores for objects represented by two\nvectors using a weighted sum of each individual vector's similarity, with a\nquery-specific parameter $\\alpha$ to determine the weight. Existing methods for\nHVQ typically construct Approximate Nearest Neighbors Search (ANNS) indexes\nwith a fixed $\\alpha$ value.

ERANet\nintegrates three key components: edge replacement augmentation (ERA), prototype\nconsistency alignment (PCA), and a conditional self-training (CST) strategy\nwithin a mean teacher architecture. ERA introduces anatomically relevant\nperturbations by simulating meniscal variations, ensuring that augmentations\nalign with the structural context. PCA enhances segmentation performance by\naligning intra-class features and promoting compact, discriminative feature\nrepresentations, particularly in scenarios with limited labeled data. CST\nimproves segmentation robustness by iteratively refining pseudo-labels and\nmitigating the impact of label noise during training. Together, these\ninnovations establish ERANet as a robust and scalable solution for meniscus\nsegmentation, effectively addressing key barriers to practical implementation.\nWe validated ERANet comprehensively on 3D Double Echo Steady State (DESS) and\n3D Fast/Turbo Spin Echo (FSE/TSE) MRI sequences. The results demonstrate the\nsuperior performance of ERANet compared to state-of-the-art methods. The\nproposed framework achieves reliable and accurate segmentation of meniscus\nstructures, even when trained on minimal labeled data. Extensive ablation\nstudies further highlight the synergistic contributions of ERA, PCA, and CST,\nsolidifying ERANet as a transformative solution for semi-supervised meniscus\nsegmentation in medical imaging.",

However, the impact of\nthese videos on the content ecosystem remains largely unexplored. Video\ninformation retrieval remains a fundamental approach for accessing video\ncontent. Building on the observation that retrieval models often favor\nAI-generated content in ad-hoc and image retrieval tasks, we investigate\nwhether similar biases emerge in the context of challenging video retrieval,\nwhere temporal and visual factors may further influence model behavior. To\nexplore this, we first construct a comprehensive benchmark dataset containing\nboth real and AI-generated videos, along with a set of fair and rigorous\nmetrics to assess bias. This benchmark consists of 13,000 videos generated by\ntwo state-of-the-art open-source video generation models. We meticulously\ndesign a suite of rigorous metrics to accurately measure this preference,\naccounting for potential biases arising from the limited frame rate and\nsuboptimal quality of AIGC videos. We then applied three off-the-shelf video\nretrieval models to perform retrieval tasks on this hybrid dataset. Our\nfindings reveal a clear preference for AI-generated videos in retrieval.\nFurther investigation shows that incorporating AI-generated videos into the\ntraining set of retrieval models exacerbates this bias. Unlike the preference\nobserved in image modalities, we find that video retrieval bias arises from\nboth unseen visual and temporal information, making the root causes of video\nbias a complex interplay of these two factors. To mitigate this bias, we\nfine-tune the retrieval models using a contrastive learning approach.

By incorporating a learnable\nlatent denoiser into the receiver, the received signals are preprocessed to\neffectively remove the channel noise and recover the semantic information,\nthereby enhancing the quality of the decoded images. Specifically, a latent\ndenoising mapping is established by an iterative residual learning approach to\nimprove the denoising efficiency while ensuring stable performance. Moreover,\nchannel signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is utilized to estimate and predict the\nlatent similarity score (SS) for conditional denoising, where the number of\ndenoising steps is adapted based on the predicted SS sequence, further reducing\nthe communication latency. Finally, simulations demonstrate that the proposed\nframework can effectively and efficiently remove the channel noise at various\nlevels and reconstruct visual-appealing images.",

    "abstract": "The use of multiantenna technologies in the near field offers the possibility\nof focusing the energy in spatial regions rather than just in angle. The\nobjective of this paper is to provide a formal framework that allows to\nestablish the region in space where this effect can take place and how\nefficient this focusing can be, assuming that the transmit architecture is a\nuniform linear array (ULA). A dyadic Green's channel model is adopted, and the\namplitude differences between the receiver and each transmit antenna are\neffectively incorporated in the model. By considering a second-order expansion\nof the SNR around the intended receiver, a formal criterion is derived in order\nto establish whether beamfocusing is feasible or not. An analytic description\nis provided that determines the shape and position of the asymptotic ellipsoid\nwhere a minimum SNR is achieved. Further insights are provided by considering\nthe holographic regime, whereby the number of elements of the ULA increase\nwithout bound while the distance between adjacent elements converges to zero.\nThis asymptotic framework allows to simplify the analytical form of the\nbeamfocusing feasibility region, which in turn provides some further insights\ninto the shape of the coverage regions depending on the position of the\nintended receiver. In particular, it is shown that beamfocusing is only\npossible if the size of the ULA is at least $4.4\\lambda$ where $\\lambda$ is the\ntransmission wavelength. Furthermore, a closed form analytical expression is\nprovided that asymptotically determines the maximum distance where beamfocusing\nis feasible as a function of the elevation angle. In particular, beamfocusing\nis only feasible when the receiver is located between a minimum and a maximum\ndistance from the array, where these upper and lower distance limits\neffectively depend on the angle of elevation",

    "abstract": "We report the position reconstruction methods and surface background model\nfor the PandaX-4T dark matter direct search experiment.

Both methods determine the horizontal\nposition of events based on the light pattern of secondary scintillation\ncollected by the light sensors. After a comprehensive evaluation of resolution,\nuniformity, and robustness, the PAF method was selected for position\nreconstruction, while the TM method was employed for verification. The PAF\nmethod achieves a bulk event resolution of 1.0 mm and a surface event\nresolution of 4.4 mm for a typical $S2$ signal with a bottom charge of 1500 PE\n(about 14 keV). The uniformity is around 20\\%. Robustness studies reveal\naverage deviations of 5.1 mm and 8.8 mm for the commissioning run (Run0) and\nthe first science run (Run1), respectively, due to the deactivation of certain\nPMTs. A data-driven surface background model is developed based on the PAF\nmethod.

By\ntraining models to predict inputs/outputs given code and test cases entirely in\nnatural language as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) rationales, we expose them to\nuniversal reasoning primitives -- like logic flow planning, state-space\nsearching, decision tree traversal, and modular decomposition -- while\ndecoupling structured reasoning from code-specific syntax and preserving\nprocedural rigor. Experimental results demonstrate CodeI/O leads to consistent\nimprovements across symbolic, scientific, logic, math & numerical, and\ncommonsense reasoning tasks. By matching the existing ground-truth outputs or\nre-executing the code with predicted inputs, we can verify each prediction and\nfurther enhance the CoTs through multi-turn revision, resulting in CodeI/O++\nand achieving higher performance.

To address this gap, we propose CreAgent, a\nLarge Language Model (LLM)-empowered creator simulation agent. By incorporating\ngame theory's belief mechanism and the fast-and-slow thinking framework,\nCreAgent effectively simulates creator behavior under conditions of information\nasymmetry. Additionally, we enhance CreAgent's simulation ability by\nfine-tuning it using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). Our credibility\nvalidation experiments show that CreAgent aligns well with the behaviors\nbetween real-world platform and creator, thus improving the reliability of\nlong-term RS evaluations. Moreover, through the simulation of RS involving\nCreAgents, we can explore how fairness- and diversity-aware RS algorithms\ncontribute to better long-term performance for various stakeholders. CreAgent\nand the simulation platform are publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/shawnye2000/CreAgent.",

Given navigation instruction in natural language, we\nfirst prompt LLM to extract the landmarks and the order in which they are\nvisited. Assuming the known model of the environment, we retrieve the top-k\nlocations of the last landmark and generate $k$ path hypotheses from the\nstarting location to the last landmark using the shortest path algorithm on the\ntopological map of the environment. Each path hypothesis is represented by a\nsequence of panoramas. We then use dynamic programming to compute the alignment\nscore between the sequence of panoramas and the sequence of landmark names,\nwhich match scores obtained from VLM. Finally, we compute the nDTW metric\nbetween the hypothesis that yields the highest alignment score to evaluate the\npath fidelity.

Chandra X-ray observations show a dominant point-like\nsource with an average 0.3-10 keV luminosity of 10^{40.3} erg/s and variability\nby a factor of ~2 over months. This extreme ultraluminous X-ray source (ULX) is\napparently associated with the young central cluster. A multicolor disk\nmodeling of the X-ray spectrum of the source suggests a standard accretion\naround a black hole. It also has a morphologically elongated nonthermal radio\ncontinuum counterpart on the scale of ~200 pc, probably the longest detected\nfrom such a source.

Accounting for the presence of the ULX\nand the prominent emission lines HeII\\lambda4658 and [ArIV]\\lambda4711 while\nlacking Wolf-Rayet spectral features, we estimate the true age of the starburst\nto be about 2-4 Myr.

However, training such\nmodels typically requires labor-intensive, pixel-wise annotations by domain\nexperts. Recent efforts have democratized this process by involving lay\nannotators without medical expertise. However, conventional non-corrective\napproaches struggle to handle annotation noise adaptively because they lack\nmechanisms to mitigate false positives (FP) and false negatives (FN) at both\nthe image-feature and pixel levels. In this paper, we propose a consensus-aware\nself-corrective AI agent that leverages the Consensus Matrix to guide its\nlearning process. The Consensus Matrix defines regions where both the AI and\nannotators agree on cell and non-cell annotations, which are prioritized with\nstronger supervision. Conversely, areas of disagreement are adaptively weighted\nbased on their feature similarity to high-confidence consensus regions, with\nmore similar regions receiving greater attention. Additionally, contrastive\nlearning is employed to separate features of noisy regions from those of\nreliable consensus regions by maximizing their dissimilarity. This paradigm\nenables the model to iteratively refine noisy labels, enhancing its robustness.\nValidated on one real-world lay-annotated cell dataset and two reasoning-guided\nsimulated noisy datasets, our method demonstrates improved segmentation\nperformance, effectively correcting FP and FN errors and showcasing its\npotential for training robust models on noisy datasets.

Based on data from\nmainstream social media platforms, including WeChat, Weibo, and Twitter,\ncumulatively encompassing a total of 7.45 billion users, we uncover a\nubiquitous mechanism that the information spreading dynamics are basically\ndriven by the interplay of social reinforcement and social weakening effects.\nAccordingly, we propose a concise equation, which, surprisingly, can well\ndescribe all the empirical large-scale spreading trajectories. Our theory\nresolves a number of controversial claims and satisfactorily explains many\nphenomena previously observed.

Existing approaches mostly hinge on single-scale propagation strategies\nthat iteratively ameliorate initial coarse depth estimates through pixel-level\nmessage passing. Despite their commendable outcomes, these techniques are\nfrequently hampered by computational inefficiencies and a limited grasp of\nscene context. To circumvent these challenges, we introduce LP-Net, an\ninnovative framework that implements a multi-scale, progressive prediction\nparadigm based on Laplacian Pyramid decomposition. Diverging from\npropagation-based approaches, LP-Net initiates with a rudimentary,\nlow-resolution depth prediction to encapsulate the global scene context,\nsubsequently refining this through successive upsampling and the reinstatement\nof high-frequency details at incremental scales. We have developed two novel\nmodules to bolster this strategy: 1) the Multi-path Feature Pyramid module,\nwhich segregates feature maps into discrete pathways, employing multi-scale\ntransformations to amalgamate comprehensive spatial information, and 2) the\nSelective Depth Filtering module, which dynamically learns to apply both\nsmoothness and sharpness filters to judiciously mitigate noise while\naccentuating intricate details. By integrating these advancements, LP-Net not\nonly secures state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across both outdoor and indoor\nbenchmarks such as KITTI, NYUv2, and TOFDC, but also demonstrates superior\ncomputational efficiency.

    "abstract": "Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a fundamental problem in natural language\nprocessing (NLP). However, the task of extracting longer entity spans (e.g.,\nawards) from extended texts (e.g., homepages) is barely explored. Current NER\nmethods predominantly fall into two categories: span-based methods and\ngeneration-based methods. Span-based methods require the enumeration of all\npossible token-pair spans, followed by classification on each span, resulting\nin substantial redundant computations and excessive GPU memory usage. In\ncontrast, generation-based methods involve prompting or fine-tuning large\nlanguage models (LLMs) to adapt to downstream NER tasks. However, these methods\nstruggle with the accurate generation of longer spans and often incur\nsignificant time costs for effective fine-tuning. To address these challenges,\nthis paper introduces a lightweight span-based NER method called SeNER, which\nincorporates a bidirectional arrow attention mechanism coupled with\nLogN-Scaling on the [CLS] token to embed long texts effectively, and comprises\na novel bidirectional sliding-window plus-shaped attention (BiSPA) mechanism to\nreduce redundant candidate token-pair spans significantly and model\ninteractions between token-pair spans simultaneously. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art extraction accuracy on\nthree long NER datasets and is capable of extracting entities from long texts\nin a GPU-memory-friendly manner.

Recent developments\nhave evidenced support towards negatively dependent systems as a learning\nparadigm in a broad range of fundamental machine learning challenges including\noptimization, sampling, dimensionality reduction and sparse signal recovery,\noften surpassing the performance of current methods based on statistical\nindependence. The most popular negatively dependent model has been that of\ndeterminantal point processes (DPPs), which have their origins in quantum\ntheory. However, other models, such as perturbed lattice models, strongly\nRayleigh measures, zeros of random functions have gained salience in various\nlearning applications. In this article, we review this burgeoning field of\nresearch, as it has developed over the past two decades or so. We also present\nnew results on applications of DPPs to the parsimonious representation of\nneural networks. In the limited scope of the article, we mostly focus on\naspects of this area to which the authors contributed over the recent years,\nincluding applications to Monte Carlo methods, coresets and stochastic gradient\ndescent, stochastic networks, signal processing and connections to quantum\ncomputation. However, starting from basics of negative dependence for the\nuninitiated reader, extensive references are provided to a broad swath of\nrelated developments which could not be covered within our limited scope. While\nexisting works and reviews generally focus on specific negatively dependent\nmodels (e.g. DPPs), a notable feature of this article is that it addresses\nnegative dependence as a machine learning methodology as a whole. In this vein,\nit covers within its span an array of negatively dependent models and their\napplications well beyond DPPs, thereby putting forward a very general and\nrather unique perspective.",

    "abstract": "Lattice-based cryptography is a foundation for post-quantum security, with\nthe Learning with Errors (LWE) problem as a core component in key exchange,\nencryption, and homomorphic computation. Structured variants like Ring-LWE\n(RLWE) and Module-LWE (MLWE) improve efficiency using polynomial rings but\nremain constrained by traditional polynomial multiplication rules, limiting\ntheir ability to handle structured vectorized data. This work introduces\nVariety-LWE (VLWE), a new structured lattice problem based on algebraic\ngeometry. Unlike RLWE and MLWE, which use polynomial quotient rings with\nstandard multiplication, VLWE operates over multivariate polynomial rings\ndefined by algebraic varieties. A key difference is that these polynomials lack\nmixed variables, and multiplication is coordinate-wise rather than following\nstandard polynomial multiplication. This enables direct encoding and\nhomomorphic processing of high-dimensional data while preserving worst-case to\naverage-case hardness reductions. We prove VLWE's security by reducing it to\nmultiple independent Ideal-SVP instances, demonstrating resilience against\nclassical and quantum attacks. Additionally, we analyze hybrid\nalgebraic-lattice attacks, showing that existing Grobner basis and lattice\nreduction methods do not directly threaten VLWE. We further construct a vector\nhomomorphic encryption scheme based on VLWE, supporting structured computations\nwhile controlling noise growth. This scheme offers advantages in\nprivacy-preserving machine learning, encrypted search, and secure computations\nover structured data. VLWE emerges as a novel and independent paradigm in\nlattice-based cryptography, leveraging algebraic geometry to enable new\ncryptographic capabilities beyond traditional polynomial quotient rings.",

The\nfollower $\\mu$Bot is equipped at its head with bilateral pressure sensors to\ndetect signals excited by both its own and the leader's movements. First, using\nexperiments with static formations between an undulating leader and a\nstationary follower, we determined the formation that resulted in strong\npressure variations measured by the follower.

Next,\na long short-term memory neural network was used as the control policy that\nmaps the pressure signals along with the robot motor commands and the Euler\nangles (measured by the onboard IMU) to the steering command. The policy was\ntrained to imitate the expert policy using behavior cloning and Dataset\nAggregation (DAgger).

We\naddress this by learning two embeddings to independently represent the\nphenomena of interest and the spurious correlations. The embedding representing\nthe phenomena of interest is correlated with the target variable $y$, and is\ninvariant to the environment variable $e$. In contrast, the embedding\nrepresenting the spurious correlations is correlated with $e$. The invariance\nto $e$ is difficult to achieve on real-world datasets. Our primary contribution\nis an algorithm called Supervised Contrastive Block Disentanglement (SCBD) that\neffectively enforces this invariance. It is based purely on Supervised\nContrastive Learning, and applies to real-world data better than existing\napproaches. We empirically validate SCBD on two challenging problems. The first\nproblem is domain generalization, where we achieve strong performance on a\nsynthetic dataset, as well as on Camelyon17-WILDS. We introduce a single\nhyperparameter $\\alpha$ to control the degree of invariance to $e$. When we\nincrease $\\alpha$ to strengthen the degree of invariance, out-of-distribution\nperformance improves at the expense of in-distribution performance.

    "abstract": "Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has been applied in financial portfolio\nmanagement to improve returns in changing market conditions. However, unlike\nmost fields where DRL is widely used, the stock market is more volatile and\ndynamic as it is affected by several factors such as global events and investor\nsentiment. Therefore, it remains a challenge to construct a DRL-based portfolio\nmanagement framework with strong return capability, stable training, and\ngeneralization ability. This study introduces a new framework utilizing the\nMemory Instance Gated Transformer (MIGT) for effective portfolio management. By\nincorporating a novel Gated Instance Attention module, which combines a\ntransformer variant, instance normalization, and a Lite Gate Unit, our approach\naims to maximize investment returns while ensuring the learning process's\nstability and reducing outlier impacts. Tested on the Dow Jones Industrial\nAverage 30, our framework's performance is evaluated against fifteen other\nstrategies using key financial metrics like the cumulative return and\nrisk-return ratios (Sharpe, Sortino, and Omega ratios). The results highlight\nMIGT's advantage, showcasing at least a 9.75% improvement in cumulative returns\nand a minimum 2.36% increase in risk-return ratios over competing strategies,\nmarking a significant advancement in DRL for portfolio management.",

    "abstract": "Unsupervised reinforcement learning (URL) aims to pre-train agents by\nexploring diverse states or skills in reward-free environments, facilitating\nefficient adaptation to downstream tasks. As the agent cannot access extrinsic\nrewards during unsupervised exploration, existing methods design intrinsic\nrewards to model the explored data and encourage further exploration. However,\nthe explored data are always heterogeneous, posing the requirements of powerful\nrepresentation abilities for both intrinsic reward models and pre-trained\npolicies. In this work, we propose the Exploratory Diffusion Model (ExDM),\nwhich leverages the strong expressive ability of diffusion models to fit the\nexplored data, simultaneously boosting exploration and providing an efficient\ninitialization for downstream tasks. Specifically, ExDM can accurately estimate\nthe distribution of collected data in the replay buffer with the diffusion\nmodel and introduces the score-based intrinsic reward, encouraging the agent to\nexplore less-visited states. After obtaining the pre-trained policies, ExDM\nenables rapid adaptation to downstream tasks. In detail, we provide theoretical\nanalyses and practical algorithms for fine-tuning diffusion policies,\naddressing key challenges such as training instability and computational\ncomplexity caused by multi-step sampling. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat ExDM outperforms existing SOTA baselines in efficient unsupervised\nexploration and fast fine-tuning downstream tasks, especially in structurally\ncomplicated environments.",

    "abstract": "We present ATOP (Articulate That Object Part), a novel few-shot method based\non motion personalization to articulate a static 3D object with respect to a\npart and its motion as prescribed in a text prompt. Given the scarcity of\navailable datasets with motion attribute annotations, existing methods struggle\nto generalize well in this task. In our work, the text input allows us to tap\ninto the power of modern-day diffusion models to generate plausible motion\nsamples for the right object category and part. In turn, the input 3D object\nprovides image prompting to personalize the generated video to that very object\nwe wish to articulate. Our method starts with a few-shot finetuning for\ncategory-specific motion generation, a key first step to compensate for the\nlack of articulation awareness by current diffusion models. For this, we\nfinetune a pre-trained multi-view image generation model for controllable\nmulti-view video generation, using a small collection of video samples obtained\nfor the target object category. This is followed by motion video\npersonalization that is realized by multi-view rendered images of the target 3D\nobject. At last, we transfer the personalized video motion to the target 3D\nobject via differentiable rendering to optimize part motion parameters by a\nscore distillation sampling loss. Experimental results on PartNet-Sapien and\nACD datasets show that our method is capable of generating realistic motion\nvideos and predicting 3D motion parameters in a more accurate and generalizable\nway, compared to prior works in the few-shot setting.",

    "abstract": "Continual learning (CL) has traditionally emphasized minimizing exemplar\nmemory usage, assuming that memory is the primary bottleneck. However, in\nmodern computing environments-particularly those involving large foundation\nmodels-memory is inexpensive and abundant, while GPU time constitutes the main\ncost. This paper re-examines CL under a more realistic setting with sufficient\nexemplar memory, where the system can retain a representative portion of past\ndata. We find that, under this regime, stability improves due to reduced\nforgetting, but plasticity diminishes as the model becomes biased toward prior\ntasks and struggles to adapt to new ones. Notably, even simple baselines like\nnaive replay can match or exceed the performance of state-of-the-art methods at\na fraction of the computational cost. Building on this insight, we propose a\nlightweight yet effective method called Weight Space Consolidation, which\ndirectly operates in the model's weight space via two core mechanisms: (1)\nrank-based parameter resets to recover plasticity, and (2) weight averaging to\nenhance stability. Our approach outperforms strong baselines across\nclass-incremental learning with image classifiers and continual instruction\ntuning with large language models, while requiring only one-third to one-fourth\nof the training cost. These findings challenge long-standing CL assumptions and\nestablish a new, cost-efficient baseline for real-world continual learning\nsystems where exemplar memory is no longer the limiting factor.",

While longer CoTs are often presumed superior,\nthis paper challenges that notion, arguing that longer is not always better.\nDrawing on combined evidence from real-world observations, controlled\nexperiments, and theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that task accuracy\ntypically follows an inverted U-shaped curve with CoT length, where performance\ninitially improves but eventually decreases as the number of CoT steps\nincreases. With controlled experiments, we further uncover the scaling\nbehaviors of the optimal CoT length: it increases with task difficulty but\ndecreases with model capability, exposing an inherent simplicity bias where\nmore capable models favor shorter, more efficient CoT reasoning. This bias is\nalso evident in Reinforcement Learning (RL) training, where models gravitate\ntowards shorter CoTs as their accuracy improves. To have a deep understanding\nof these dynamics, we establish a simple theoretical model that formally proves\nthese phenomena, including the optimal length's scaling laws and the emergence\nof simplicity bias during RL. Guided by this framework, we demonstrate\nsignificant practical benefits from training with optimally-lengthed CoTs and\nemploying length-aware filtering at inference. These findings offer both a\nprincipled understanding of the \"overthinking\" phenomenon and multiple\npractical guidelines for CoT calibration, enabling LLMs to achieve optimal\nreasoning performance with adaptive CoTs tailored to task complexity and model\ncapability.",

In this study, density functional theory\n(DFT) was employed to comprehensively analyze the electronic properties of\nCsSn1-xGexI3 that influenced light-matter interactions tuning of the perovskite\nmaterials by varying composition in B site atoms.

This paper is the first to\nuncover both the practices and perceptions behind testing in IoT platforms,\nparticularly open-source smart home platforms. Our study is composed of two key\ncomponents. First, we mine and empirically analyze the code and integrations of\ntwo highly popular and well-maintained open-source IoT platforms, OpenHab and\nHomeAssitant. Our analysis involves the identification of functional and\nrelated test methods based on the focal method approach. We find that OpenHab\nhas only 0.04 test ratio ($\\approx 4K$ focal test methods from $\\approx 76K$\nfunctional methods) in Java files, while HomeAssitant exhibits higher test\nratio of $0.42$, which reveals a significant dearth of testing. Second, to\nunderstand the developers' perspective on testing in IoT, and to explain our\nempirical observations, we survey 80 open-source developers actively engaged in\nIoT platform development. Our analysis of survey responses reveals a\nsignificant focus on automated (unit) testing, and a lack of manual testing,\nwhich supports our empirical observations, as well as testing challenges\nspecific to IoT. Together, our empirical analysis and survey yield 10 key\nfindings that uncover the current state of testing in IoT platforms, and reveal\nkey perceptions and challenges.

    "abstract": "Understanding interfacial phenomena in confined systems is important for\noptimizing CO2 capture technologies. Here, we present a comprehensive\ninvestigation of CO2 adsorption in hydrated amorphous silica nanopores through\nan integrated computational approach combining grand canonical Monte Carlo\n(GCMC), classical molecular dynamics (MD), and ab initio molecular dynamics\n(AIMD) simulations. The excess adsorption isotherms reveal a marked hydration\ndependence, with CO2 uptake decreasing from 7.6 to 2.6 mmol/g as water content\nincreases from 1 to 15 wt%. Analysis of adsorption kinetics demonstrates a\ndistinctive bimodal process, characterized by rapid initial uptake followed by\nslower diffusion-limited adsorption, with the latter becoming increasingly\ndominant at higher hydration levels. Classical MD simulations reveal an inverse\ncorrelation between hydration and CO2 mobility, with self-diffusion\ncoefficients decreasing across the studied hydration range. Density profile\nanalysis indicates a hydration-induced transition in CO2 distribution from\ncentral pore regions to surface-proximate domains, accompanied by restructuring\nof interfacial water networks. Notably, AIMD simulations capture previously\nunrecognized chemical processes, including proton transfer mechanisms leading\nto surface silanol formation with characteristic O-O distances of 2.4-2.5\n{\\AA}, and spontaneous CO2 hydration yielding carbonate species through\nwater-mediated reaction pathways. These findings demonstrate the dual role of\nconfined water as both a spatial competitor and reaction medium for CO2\ncapture, providing molecular-level insights with quantum mechanical accuracy\nfor design of carbon capture materials.",

These CEs are difficult to detect online:\nthey are often rare, require long-range reasoning over noisy sensor data, must\ngeneralize rules beyond fixed-length traces, and suffer from limited real-world\ndatasets due to the high annotation burden. We propose NAROCE, a Neural\nAlgorithmic Reasoning framework for Online CE detection that separates the task\ninto two stages: (i) learning CE rules from large-scale, low-cost pseudo AE\nconcept traces generated by simulators or LLMs, and (ii) training an adapter to\nmap real sensor data into the learned reasoning space using fewer labeled\nsensor samples. Experiments show that NAROCE outperforms the strongest baseline\nin accuracy, generalization to longer, unseen sequences, and data efficiency,\nachieving comparable performance with less than half the labeled data.

    "abstract": "This paper is a shortened version of the full paper that was published in the\njournal Frontiers of Psychology in May 2022. In recent decades, the scientific\nstudy of consciousness has significantly increased our understanding of this\nelusive phenomenon. Yet, despite critical development in our understanding of\nthe functional side of consciousness, we still lack a fundamental theory\nregarding its phenomenal aspect. The phenomenal aspect of consciousness is the\nfirst-person answer to what it is like question, and it has thus far proved\nrecalcitrant to direct scientific investigation. The question of how the brain,\nor any cognitive system, can create conscious experience out of neural\nrepresentations poses a great conundrum to science. Naturalistic dualists argue\nthat it is composed of a primitive, private, nonreductive element of reality.\nIllusionists, on the other hand, argue that it is merely a cognitive illusion.\nWe contend that both the dualist and illusionist positions are flawed because\nthey tacitly assume consciousness to be an absolute property that does not\ndepend on the observer. We developed a conceptual and a mathematical argument\nfor a relativistic theory of consciousness in which a system either has or does\nnot have phenomenal consciousness with respect to some observer. According to\nthe theory, Phenomenal consciousness is neither private nor delusional, just\nrelativistic. In the frame of reference of the cognitive system, it will be\nobservable (first-person perspective) and in other frame of reference it will\nnot (third-person perspective). These two cognitive frames of reference are\nboth correct, just as in the case of an observer that claims to be at rest\nwhile another will claim that the observer has constant velocity.

    "abstract": "Fingerprint localization has gained significant attention due to its\ncost-effective deployment, low complexity, and high efficacy. However,\ntraditional methods, while effective for static data, often struggle in dynamic\nenvironments where data distributions and feature spaces evolve-a common\noccurrence in real-world scenarios. To address the challenges of robustness and\nadaptability in fingerprint localization for dynamic indoor environments, this\npaper proposes DF-Loc, an end-to-end dynamic fingerprint localization system\nbased on multi-source unsupervised domain adaptation (MUDA). DF-Loc leverages\nhistorical data from multiple time scales to facilitate knowledge transfer in\nspecific feature spaces, thereby enhancing generalization capabilities in the\ntarget domain and reducing reliance on labeled data. Specifically, the system\nincorporates a Quality Control (QC) module for CSI data preprocessing and\nemploys image processing techniques for CSI fingerprint feature reconstruction.\nAdditionally, a multi-scale attention-based feature fusion backbone network is\ndesigned to extract multi-level transferable fingerprint features. Finally, a\ndual-stage alignment model aligns the distributions of multiple source-target\ndomain pairs, improving regression characteristics in the target domain.\nExtensive experiments conducted in office and classroom environments\ndemonstrate that DF-Loc outperforms comparative methods in terms of both\nlocalization accuracy and robustness. With 60% of reference points used for\ntraining, DF-Loc achieves average localization errors of 0.79m and 3.72m in\n\"same-test\" scenarios, and 0.94m and 4.39m in \"different-test\" scenarios,\nrespectively.

To address these issues, we propose Vevo, a\nversatile zero-shot voice imitation framework with controllable timbre and\nstyle. Vevo operates in two core stages: (1) Content-Style Modeling: Given\neither text or speech's content tokens as input, we utilize an autoregressive\ntransformer to generate the content-style tokens, which is prompted by a style\nreference; (2) Acoustic Modeling: Given the content-style tokens as input, we\nemploy a flow-matching transformer to produce acoustic representations, which\nis prompted by a timbre reference. To obtain the content and content-style\ntokens of speech, we design a fully self-supervised approach that progressively\ndecouples the timbre, style, and linguistic content of speech. Specifically, we\nadopt VQ-VAE as the tokenizer for the continuous hidden features of HuBERT. We\ntreat the vocabulary size of the VQ-VAE codebook as the information bottleneck,\nand adjust it carefully to obtain the disentangled speech representations.\nSolely self-supervised trained on 60K hours of audiobook speech data, without\nany fine-tuning on style-specific corpora, Vevo matches or surpasses existing\nmethods in accent and emotion conversion tasks.

    "abstract": "Deep learning enabled semantic communications are attracting extensive\nattention. However, most works normally ignore the data acquisition process and\nsuffer from robustness issues under dynamic channel environment. In this paper,\nwe propose an adaptive joint sampling-semantic-channel coding (Adaptive-JSSCC)\nframework. Specifically, we propose a semantic-aware sampling and\nreconstruction method to optimize the number of samples dynamically for each\nregion of the images. According to semantic significance, we optimize sampling\nmatrices for each region of the most individually and obtain a semantic\nsampling ratio distribution map shared with the receiver. Through the guidance\nof the map, high-quality reconstruction is achieved. Meanwhile, attention-based\nchannel adaptive module (ACAM) is designed to overcome the neural network model\nmismatch between the training and testing channel environment during\nsampling-reconstruction and encoding-decoding. To this end, signal-to-noise\nratio (SNR) is employed as an extra parameter input to integrate and reorganize\nintermediate characteristics. Simulation results show that the proposed\nAdaptive-JSSCC effectively reduces the amount of data acquisition without\ndegrading the reconstruction performance in comparison to the state-of-the-art,\nand it is highly adaptable and adjustable to dynamic channel environments.",

To mitigate such emerging threats, a prevalent strategy\nis to cleanse the victim models by various backdoor purification techniques.\nDespite notable achievements, current state-of-the-art (SOTA) backdoor\npurification techniques usually rely on the availability of a small clean\ndataset, often referred to as auxiliary dataset.

Our findings indicate that\nthe purification effectiveness fluctuates significantly depending on the type\nof auxiliary dataset used. Specifically, a high-quality in-distribution\nauxiliary dataset is essential for effective purification, whereas datasets\nfrom varied or out-of-distribution sources significantly degrade the defensive\nperformance. Based on this, we propose Guided Input Calibration (GIC), which\naims to improve purification efficacy by employing a learnable transformation.\nGuided by the victim model itself, GIC aligns the characteristics of the\nauxiliary dataset with those of the original training set.

Despite its significance, solving this model exactly\n  has remained a formidable challenge due to the breaking of $U(1)$\n  symmetry. Building on the off-diagonal Bethe Ansatz (ODBA), we derive a set\n  of nonlinear integral equations (NLIEs) that encapsulate the exact spectrum\n  of the model.\n  For $U(1)$ symmetric spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ chains such NLIEs involve two\n  functions $a(x)$ and $\\bar{a}(x)$ coupled by an integration kernel with\n  short-ranged elements. The solution functions show characteristic features\n  for arguments at some length scale which grows logarithmically with system\n  size $N$.\n  For the non $U(1)$ symmetric case, the equations involve a novel third\n  function $c(x)$, which captures the inhomogeneous contributions of the\n  $T$-$Q$ relation. The kernel elements coupling this function to the\n  standard ones are long-ranged and lead for the ground-state to a winding\n  phenomenon. In $\\log(1+a(x))$ and $\\log(1+\\bar a(x))$ we observe a\n  sudden change by $2\\pi$i at a characteristic scale $x_1$ of the\n  argument. Other features appear at a value $x_0$ which is of order $\\log N$.\n  These two length scales, $x_1$ and $x_0$, are independent: their ratio\n  $x_1/x_0$ is large for small $N$ and small for large $N$. Explicit\n  solutions to the NLIEs are obtained numerically for these limiting cases,\n  though intermediate cases ($x_1/x_0 \\sim 1$) present computational\n  challenges.\n  This work lays the foundation for studying finite-size corrections and\n  conformal properties of other integrable spin chains with non-diagonal\n  boundaries, opening new avenues for exploring boundary effects in quantum\n  integrable systems.",

The morphology of these flagella significantly\ninfluences forward speed, swimming efficiency, and directional stability, which\nare critical for their survival. This study begins by simulating the\nthree-dimensional motion trajectories of microswimmers to analyze their\nkinematic characteristics. The simulation results demonstrate that\nmicroswimmers can actively adjust their forward direction by modifying the\norientation of their flagella. We subsequently perform numerical simulations to\nvisualize the flow fields generated by a microswimmer and examine the\nhydrodynamic interactions between the cell body and the flagella, focusing on\ntheir impacts on forward speed and swimming efficiency. We conclude that\nforward speed and swimming efficiency are closely related to the filament\nradius, pitch angle, and contour length of the flagella, while the yaw angle of\nlocomotion is determined by the helix radius and contour length of the\nflagella. We conclude that the pitch angle for maximum forward speed is\nslightly smaller than that for maximum swimming efficiency, which suggests that\nmicroswimmers can effectively alternate between states of maximum forward speed\nand maximum swimming efficiency by fine-tuning their pitch angle and adapting\nto varying ecological conditions. These morphological characteristics of\nmicroswimmers may result from species competition and natural selection. This\nresearch establishes an optimized model for microswimmers, providing valuable\ninsights for the design of enhanced microrobots tailored to specific\napplications.",

    "abstract": "Recent developments in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for selecting\nrelevant tools from a tool knowledge base enable LLM agents to scale their\ncomplex tool calling capabilities to hundreds or thousands of external tools,\nAPIs, or agents-as-tools. However, traditional RAG-based tool retrieval fails\nto capture structured dependencies between tools, limiting the retrieval\naccuracy of a retrieved tool's dependencies. For example, among a vector\ndatabase of tools, a \"get stock price\" API requires a \"stock ticker\" parameter\nfrom a \"get stock ticker\" API, and both depend on OS-level internet\nconnectivity tools. In this paper, we address this limitation by introducing\nGraph RAG-Tool Fusion, a novel plug-and-play approach that combines the\nstrengths of vector-based retrieval with efficient graph traversal to capture\nall relevant tools (nodes) along with any nested dependencies (edges) within\nthe predefined tool knowledge graph. We also present ToolLinkOS, a new tool\nselection benchmark of 573 fictional tools, spanning over 15 industries, each\nwith an average of 6.3 tool dependencies. We demonstrate that Graph RAG-Tool\nFusion achieves absolute improvements of 71.7% and 22.1% over na\\\"ive RAG on\nToolLinkOS and ToolSandbox benchmarks, respectively (mAP@10).

At each\niteration, a random subspace is selected, and the parameters within that\nsubspace are optimized. This structured reduction in dimensionality allows our\nmethod to simultaneously reduce memory usage for both activations and optimizer\nstates.

However, most existing works rely on pre-trained\npolicies, overlooking dynamic environmental changes that rapidly invalidate the\npolicies. Periodic retraining becomes inevitable but incurs prohibitive\ncomputational costs and energy consumption-critical concerns for\nresource-constrained wireless systems. We identify three root causes of\ninefficient retraining: high-dimensional state spaces, suboptimal action spaces\nexploration-exploitation trade-offs, and reward design limitations. To overcome\nthese limitations, we propose Diffusion-based Deep Reinforcement Learning\n(D2RL), which leverages generative diffusion models (GDMs) to holistically\nenhance all three DRL components. Iterative refinement process and distribution\nmodelling of GDMs enable (1) the generation of diverse state samples to improve\nenvironmental understanding, (2) balanced action space exploration to escape\nlocal optima, and (3) the design of discriminative reward functions that better\nevaluate action quality. Our framework operates in two modes: Mode I leverages\nGDMs to explore reward spaces and design discriminative reward functions that\nrigorously evaluate action quality, while Mode II synthesizes diverse state\nsamples to enhance environmental understanding and generalization. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that D2RL achieves faster convergence and reduced\ncomputational costs over conventional DRL methods for resource allocation in\nwireless communications while maintaining competitive policy performance.

This work proposes a variational Bayesian inference (VBI)\nframework with neural speech prior (VINP) for joint speech dereverberation and\nblind RIR identification. In VINP, a probabilistic signal model is constructed\nin the time-frequency (T-F) domain based on convolution transfer function (CTF)\napproximation. For the first time, we propose using an arbitrary discriminative\ndereverberation deep neural network (DNN) to estimate the prior distribution of\nanechoic speech within a probabilistic model. By integrating both reverberant\nspeech and the anechoic speech prior, VINP yields the maximum a posteriori\n(MAP) and maximum likelihood (ML) estimations of the anechoic speech spectrum\nand CTF filter, respectively. After simple transformations, the waveforms of\nanechoic speech and RIR are estimated. VINP is effective for automatic speech\nrecognition (ASR) systems, which sets it apart from most deep learning\n(DL)-based single-channel dereverberation approaches. Experiments on\nsingle-channel speech dereverberation demonstrate that VINP attains\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in mean opinion score (MOS) and word error\nrate (WER). For blind RIR identification, experiments demonstrate that VINP\nachieves SOTA performance in estimating reverberation time at 60 dB (RT60) and\nadvanced performance in direct-to-reverberation ratio (DRR) estimation.

The\ncomputational mesh is divided into smaller elements that touch but do not\noverlap. Like a pure DG method, our new hybrid scheme requires information\nexchange only at the surface of neighboring elements. This avoids the need for\nghostzones that are usually many points deep in traditional FV implementations.\nFurthermore, unlike traditional FV implementations, that require information\nexchange between each element and its 26 surrounding neighbors on non-cuboid\nmeshes, our new hybrid method exchanges information only between each element\nand its six nearest neighbors. Through this reduction in communication, we aim\nto retain the high scalability of DG when using large supercomputers. The goal\nis to use DG in elements with smooth matter fields and to fall back onto the\nmore robust FV/FD method in elements that contain non-smooth shocks or star\nsurfaces. For this we devise trouble criteria to decide whether an element\nshould be evolved with DG or FV/FD. We use the Nmesh program to implement and\ntest the new scheme. We successfully evolve various single neutron star cases.\nThese include the challenging cases of a neutron star initially in an unstable\nequilibrium migrating to a stable configuration and a boosted neutron star.\nThese cases are simulated for the first time here in full 3D with general\nrelativistic hydrodynamics using DG methods.

This study evaluates\nwell-to-tank CI of High Sulphur Fuel Oil (HSFO) and well-to-refinery exit CI of\nLiquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) worldwide at asset level. HSFO represents\ntraditional marine fuel, while LPG serves as potential transition fuel due to\nlower tank-to-wake emissions and compatibility with low-carbon fuels.

Results show significant variation in climate impacts\nglobally. HSFO upstream CI ranges 1-22.7 gCO2e/MJ, refining CI 1.2-12.6\ngCO2e/MJ, with global volume-weighted-average well-to-tank CI of 12.4 gCO2e/MJ.\nUpstream and refining account for 55% and 32% of HSFO well-to-tank CI, with\nlarge exporters and intensive refining practices showing higher emissions.

Previous approaches often struggle when models\ntrained on high-quality images fail to generalize to low-quality test images\ndue to these color and quality shifts. In this work, we propose two novel\ntechniques to enhance generalization: dynamic color image normalization (DCIN)\nmodule and color-quality generalization (CQG) loss. The DCIN dynamically\nnormalizes the color of test images using two reference image selection\nstrategies. Specifically, the DCIN utilizes a global reference image selection\n(GRIS), which finds a universal reference image, and a local reference image\nselection (LRIS), which selects a semantically similar reference image per test\nsample. Additionally, CQG loss enforces invariance to color and quality\nvariations by ensuring consistent segmentation predictions across transformed\nimage pairs. Experimental results show that our proposals significantly improve\nsegmentation performance over the baseline on two target domain datasets,\ndespite being trained solely on a single source domain. Notably, our model\nachieved up to a 32.3-point increase in Dice score compared to the baseline,\nconsistently producing robust and usable results even under substantial domain\nshifts.

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a novel six-axis force/torque sensor tailored for\ncompact and lightweight legged robots. Unlike traditional strain gauge-based\nsensors, the proposed non-contact design employs photocouplers, enhancing\nresistance to physical impacts and reducing damage risk. This approach\nsimplifies manufacturing, lowers costs, and meets the demands of legged robots\nby combining small size, light weight, and a wide force measurement range. A\nmethodology for optimizing sensor parameters is also presented, focusing on\nmaximizing sensitivity and minimizing error. Precise modeling and analysis of\nobjective functions enabled the derivation of optimal design parameters. The\nsensor's performance was validated through extensive testing and integration\ninto quadruped robots, demonstrating alignment with theoretical modeling. The\nsensor's precise measurement capabilities make it suitable for diverse robotic\nenvironments, particularly in analyzing interactions between robot feet and the\nground. This innovation addresses existing sensor limitations while\ncontributing to advancements in robotics and sensor technology, paving the way\nfor future applications in robotic systems.",

Currently, detection methods based on greedy\nalgorithms, such as non-maximum suppression (NMS), often produce many\nrepetitive predictions or missed detections in dense scenarios, which is a\ncommon problem faced by NMS-based algorithms. Through the end-to-end DETR\n(DEtection TRansformer), as a type of detector that can incorporate the\npost-processing de-duplication capability of NMS, etc., into the network, we\nfound that homogeneous queries in the query-based detector lead to a reduction\nin the de-duplication capability of the network and the learning efficiency of\nthe encoder, resulting in duplicate prediction and missed detection problems.\nTo solve this problem, we propose learnable differentiated encoding to\nde-homogenize the queries, and at the same time, queries can communicate with\neach other via differentiated encoding information, replacing the previous\nself-attention among the queries. In addition, we used joint loss on the output\nof the encoder that considered both location and confidence prediction to give\na higher-quality initialization for queries.

Inference-time computation\nmethods (e.g., Best-of-N, beam search, et al.) are particularly valuable as\nthey can enhance reasoning performance without modifying model parameters or\nrequiring additional training. However, these techniques come with\nimplementation challenges, and most existing methods remain at the\nproof-of-concept stage with limited practical adoption due to their\ncomputational complexity and varying effectiveness across different tasks.

    "abstract": "How to alleviate the hallucinations of Large Language Models (LLMs) has\nalways been the fundamental goal pursued by the LLMs research community.\nLooking through numerous hallucination-related studies, a mainstream category\nof methods is to reduce hallucinations by optimizing the knowledge\nrepresentation of LLMs to change their output. Considering that the core focus\nof these works is the knowledge acquired by models, and knowledge has long been\na central theme in human societal progress, we believe that the process of\nmodels refining knowledge can greatly benefit from the way humans learn. In our\nwork, by imitating the human learning process, we design an Adaptive\nContrastive Learning strategy. Our method flexibly constructs different\npositive and negative samples for contrastive learning based on LLMs' actual\nmastery of knowledge. This strategy helps LLMs consolidate the correct\nknowledge they already possess, deepen their understanding of the correct\nknowledge they have encountered but not fully grasped, forget the incorrect\nknowledge they previously learned, and honestly acknowledge the knowledge they\nlack. Extensive experiments and detailed analyses on widely used datasets\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our method.",

Due to temperature\nfluctuations, internal stress, or damage from hail, insulators are prone to\ninjury. Automatic detection of damaged insulators faces challenges such as\ndiverse types, small defect targets, and complex backgrounds and shapes. Most\nresearch for detecting insulator defects has focused on a single defect type or\na specific material. However, the insulators in the grid's transmission lines\nhave different colors and materials. Various insulator defects coexist, and the\nexisting methods have difficulty meeting the practical application\nrequirements. Current methods suffer from low detection accuracy and mAP0.5\ncannot meet application requirements. This paper proposes an improved YOLOv7\nmodel for multi-type insulator defect detection. First, our model replaces the\nSPPCSPC module with the RFB module to enhance the network's feature extraction\ncapability. Second, a CA mechanism is introduced into the head part to enhance\nthe network's feature representation ability and to improve detection accuracy.\nThird, a WIoU loss function is employed to address the low-quality samples\nhindering model generalization during training, thereby improving the model's\noverall performance. The experimental results indicate that the proposed model\nexhibits enhancements across various performance metrics. Specifically, there\nis a 1.6% advancement in mAP_0.5, a corresponding 1.6% enhancement in\nmAP_0.5:0.95, a 1.3% elevation in precision, and a 1% increase in recall.\nMoreover, the model achieves parameter reduction by 3.2 million, leading to a\ndecrease of 2.5 GFLOPS in computational cost.

GCS involves capturing CO2 and injecting it into\ndeep geological formations for long-term storage, requiring precise monitoring\nto ensure containment and prevent leakage. Time-lapse seismic imaging is\nessential for tracking CO2 migration but often struggles to capture the\ncomplexities of multi-phase subsurface flow. Digital Shadows (DS), leveraging\nmachine learning-driven data assimilation techniques such as nonlinear Bayesian\nfiltering and generative AI, provide a more detailed, uncertainty-aware\nmonitoring approach. By incorporating uncertainties in reservoir properties, DS\nframeworks improve CO2 migration forecasts, reducing risks in GCS operations.\nHowever, data assimilation depends on assumptions regarding reservoir\nproperties, rock physics models, and initial conditions, which, if inaccurate,\ncan compromise prediction reliability. This study demonstrates that augmenting\nforecast ensembles with diverse rock physics models mitigates the impact of\nincorrect assumptions and improves predictive accuracy, particularly in\ndifferentiating uniform versus patchy saturation models.",

    "abstract": "Quantum annealing (QA) has emerged as a promising candidate for fast solvers\nfor combinatorial optimization problems (COPs) and has attracted the interest\nof many researchers. Since COP is logically encoded in the Ising interaction\namong spins, its realization necessitates a spin system with all-to-all\nconnectivity, presenting technical challenges in the physical implementation of\nlarge-scale QA devices. W. Lechner, P. Hauke, and P. Zoller proposed a\nparity-encoding (PE) architecture consisting of an expanded spin system with\nonly local connectivity among them to circumvent this difficulty in developing\nnear-future QA devices. They suggested that this architecture not only\nalleviates implementation challenges and enhances scalability but also\npossesses intrinsic fault tolerance. This paper proposes a practical decoding\nmethod tailored to correlated spin-flip errors in spin readout of PE\narchitecture. Our work is based on the close connection between PE architecture\nand classical low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes. We show that the bit-flip\n(BF) decoding algorithm can correct independent and identically distributed\nerrors in the readout of the SLHZ system with comparable performance to the\nbelief propagation (BP) decoding algorithm. Then, we show evidence that the\nproposed BF decoding algorithm can efficiently correct correlated spinflip\nerrors by simulation. The result suggests that introducing post-readout BF\ndecoding reduces the computational cost of QA using the PE architecture and\nimproves the performance of global optimal solution search. Our results\nemphasize the importance of the proper selection of decoding algorithms to\nexploit the inherent fault tolerance potential of the PE architecture.",

We demonstrate that under mild\nrationality axioms, reaching social-influence-free consensus using noisy\nfeedback alone is impossible. To address this, SBO employs a dual voting\nsystem: cheap but noisy public votes (e.g., show of hands in a meeting), and\nmore accurate, though expensive, private votes (e.g., one-to-one interview). We\nmodel social influence using an unknown social graph and leverage the dual\nvoting system to efficiently learn this graph.

    "abstract": "The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) in software engineering,\nparticularly in code generation, has garnered significant attention. However,\nassessing the quality of AI-generated code remains a challenge due to the\ninherent complexity of programming tasks and the lack of robust evaluation\nmetrics that align well with human judgment. Traditional token-based metrics\nsuch as BLEU and ROUGE, while commonly used in natural language processing,\nexhibit weak correlations with human assessments in code intelligence and\nverification tasks. Furthermore, these metrics are primarily research focused\nand are not designed for seamless integration into the software development\nlifecycle, limiting their practical utility for developers seeking to improve\ncode quality and security.\n  AI-assisted coding has been shown to be more beneficial for senior\ndevelopers, as they possess the expertise to critically evaluate the generated\ncode for correctness, completeness, and compliance. In contrast, junior\ndevelopers may struggle to identify hallucinations, missing functionality, or\nincorrect logic in AI-generated code. To bridge this gap, This paper introduces\na novel scoring mechanism called the SBC score, which is based on a reverse\ngeneration technique that leverages the natural language generation\ncapabilities of LLMs. Unlike direct code analysis, our approach reconstructs\nsystem requirements from AI-generated code and compares them with the original\nspecifications to quantify accuracy. The SBC score combines semantic\nsimilarity, BLEU, and completeness analysis, providing actionable insights to\ndevelopers by highlighting missing features and hallucinations.

MEMHD introduces a clustering-based initialization method and\nquantization aware iterative learning for multi-centroid associative memory.\nThrough these approaches and its overall architecture, MEMHD achieves a\nsignificant reduction in memory requirements while maintaining or improving\nclassification accuracy. Our approach achieves full utilization of IMC arrays\nand enables one-shot (or few-shot) associative search. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that MEMHD outperforms state-of-the-art binary HDC models,\nachieving up to 13.69% higher accuracy with the same memory usage, or 13.25x\nmore memory efficiency at the same accuracy level. Moreover, MEMHD reduces\ncomputation cycles by up to 80x and array usage by up to 71x compared to\nbaseline IMC mapping methods when mapped to 128x128 IMC arrays, while\nsignificantly improving energy and computation cycle efficiency.",

The key to doing so is the notion of sectoroids,\nwhich plays a role similar to the role played by sectors in characteristic\nzero. We also check some compatibilities of the proposed prototype and see how\nit reduces to special cases. In the course of formulating the prototype, we\nintroduce a new type of height functions, which is more general and flexible\nthan the one we considered in the preceding paper. Examples of this new height\nfunction include discriminants of torsors, minimal discriminants and conductors\nof elliptic curves in characteristic three. In appendices, we generalize\nconstruction of a moduli stack by Tonini-Yasuda and construct a morphism\nbetween stacks of twisted arcs.

This raises a critical question:\nhow should model training be modified to optimize performance under a\nsubsequent test-time compute strategy and budget? To explore this, we focus on\npass@N, a simple test-time strategy that searches for a correct answer in $N$\nindependent samples. We show, surprisingly, that training with cross-entropy\n(CE) loss can be ${\\it misaligned}$ with pass@N in that pass@N accuracy ${\\it\ndecreases}$ with longer training. We explain the origins of this misalignment\nin terms of model overconfidence induced by CE, and experimentally verify our\nprediction of overconfidence as an impediment to scaling test-time compute via\npass@N. Furthermore we suggest a principled, modified training loss that is\nbetter aligned to pass@N by limiting model confidence and rescuing pass@N test\nperformance. Our algorithm demonstrates improved mathematical reasoning on MATH\nand MiniF2F benchmarks under several scenarios: (1) providing answers to math\nquestions; and (2) proving theorems by searching over proof trees of varying\nshapes.

The QECCs that have been most\nextensively studied and therefore highly optimized, surface codes, are\nextremely resource intensive in terms of the number of physical qubits needed.\nA promising alternative, QLDPC codes, has been proposed more recently. These\ncodes are much less resource intensive, requiring up to 10x fewer physical\nqubits per logical qubit than practical surface code implementations. A\nsuccessful application of QLDPC codes would therefore drastically reduce the\ntimeline to reaching quantum computers that can run algorithms with proven\nexponential speedups like Shor's algorithm and QPE. However to date QLDPC codes\nhave been predominantly studied in the context of quantum memories; there has\nbeen no known method for implementing arbitrary logical Clifford operators in a\nQLDPC code proven efficient in terms of circuit depth. In combination with\nknown methods for implementing T gates, an efficient implementation of the\nClifford group unlocks resource-efficient universal quantum computation. In\nthis paper, we introduce a new family of QLDPC codes that enable efficient\ncompilation of the full Clifford group via transversal operations. Our\nconstruction executes any m-qubit Clifford operation in at most O(m) syndrome\nextraction rounds, significantly surpassing state-of-the-art lattice surgery\nmethods. We run circuit-level simulations of depth-126 logical circuits to show\nthat logical operations in our QLDPC codes attains near-memory performance.\nThese results demonstrate that QLDPC codes are a viable means to reduce, by up\nto 10x, the resources required to implement all logical quantum algorithms,\nthereby unlocking a much reduced timeline to commercially valuable quantum\ncomputing.",

Extensive experiments demonstrate that SHARP can recover the\nmodel's perplexity on various in-distribution tasks using no more than 50k\nfine-tuning data while reducing the number of stored MLP parameters by 38% to\n65%. We also conduct several ablation studies of SHARP and show that replacing\nlayers towards the later parts of the model yields better performance\nretention, and that different recovery parameterizations perform similarly when\nparameter counts are matched. Furthermore, SHARP saves 42.8% in model storage\nand reduces the total inference time by 42.2% compared to the original\nLlama2-7b model on mobile devices. Our results highlight SHARP as an efficient\nsolution for reducing inference costs in deploying LLMs without the need for\npretraining-scale resources.",

Statistical shape\nmodeling (SSM) is vital in this process. By enabling the extraction of\nquantitative morphological shape descriptors from MRI and CT scans, SSM\nprovides comprehensive descriptions of anatomical variations within a\npopulation. However, the effectiveness of SSM in anatomy evaluation hinges on\nthe quality and robustness of the shape models. While deep learning techniques\nshow promise in addressing these challenges by learning complex nonlinear\nrepresentations of shapes, existing models still have limitations and often\nrequire pre-established shape models for training. To overcome these issues, we\npropose Mesh2SSM++, a novel approach that learns to estimate correspondences\nfrom meshes in an unsupervised manner. This method leverages unsupervised,\npermutation-invariant representation learning to estimate how to deform a\ntemplate point cloud into subject-specific meshes, forming a\ncorrespondence-based shape model. Additionally, our probabilistic formulation\nallows learning a population-specific template, reducing potential biases\nassociated with template selection. A key feature of Mesh2SSM++ is its ability\nto quantify aleatoric uncertainty, which captures inherent data variability and\nis essential for ensuring reliable model predictions and robust decision-making\nin clinical tasks, especially under challenging imaging conditions. Through\nextensive validation across diverse anatomies, evaluation metrics, and\ndownstream tasks, we demonstrate that Mesh2SSM++ outperforms existing methods.\nIts ability to operate directly on meshes, combined with computational\nefficiency and interpretability through its probabilistic framework, makes it\nan attractive alternative to traditional and deep learning-based SSM\napproaches.",

(2) Endurance's sample science objectives are\nachievable, although they would require coordinated analysis techniques and\nnumerous diverse samples. (3) Geologic context is essential for addressing\nEndurance's science objectives. (4) While Endurance's objectives center on\nsample return, Endurance's long traverse would enable a variety of additional\ntransformative science investigations. (5) Endurance is an ambitious mission\nthat would be enabled and enhanced by investing in developing key technologies\nnow. (6) Endurance should strive to include more diverse perspectives in its\nformulation, particularly from early-career scientists and engineers who will\nultimately operate the rover and analyze the samples.

Despite this success, the mechanisms by\nwhich these models utilize training data, particularly the role of\nmemorization, remain unclear. In uni-modal models, both supervised and\nself-supervised, memorization has been shown to be essential for\ngeneralization. However, it is not well understood how these findings would\napply to CLIP, which incorporates elements from both supervised learning via\ncaptions that provide a supervisory signal similar to labels, and from\nself-supervised learning via the contrastive objective. To bridge this gap in\nunderstanding, we propose a formal definition of memorization in CLIP (CLIPMem)\nand use it to quantify memorization in CLIP models. Our results indicate that\nCLIP's memorization behavior falls between the supervised and self-supervised\nparadigms, with \"mis-captioned\" samples exhibiting highest levels of\nmemorization. Additionally, we find that the text encoder contributes more to\nmemorization than the image encoder, suggesting that mitigation strategies\nshould focus on the text domain.
