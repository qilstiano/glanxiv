    "abstract": "This paper proposes a spatiotemporal graph neural network-based performance\nprediction algorithm to address the challenge of forecasting performance\nfluctuations in distributed backend systems with multi-level service call\nstructures. The method abstracts system states at different time slices into a\nsequence of graph structures. It integrates the runtime features of service\nnodes with the invocation relationships among services to construct a unified\nspatiotemporal modeling framework. The model first applies a graph\nconvolutional network to extract high-order dependency information from the\nservice topology. Then it uses a gated recurrent network to capture the dynamic\nevolution of performance metrics over time. A time encoding mechanism is also\nintroduced to enhance the model's ability to represent non-stationary temporal\nsequences. The architecture is trained in an end-to-end manner, optimizing the\nmulti-layer nested structure to achieve high-precision regression of future\nservice performance metrics. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed\nmethod, a large-scale public cluster dataset is used. A series of\nmulti-dimensional experiments are designed, including variations in time\nwindows and concurrent load levels. These experiments comprehensively evaluate\nthe model's predictive performance and stability. The experimental results show\nthat the proposed model outperforms existing representative methods across key\nmetrics such as MAE, RMSE, and R2. It maintains strong robustness under varying\nload intensities and structural complexities. These results demonstrate the\nmodel's practical potential for backend service performance management tasks.",

We found that ConvRNNs\nwith top-down feedback exhibited remarkable speed-accuracy trade-off and\nrobustness to noise perturbations and adversarial attacks, but only when they\nwere trained with stochastic neural variability, simulated by randomly\nsilencing single units via dropout. By performing detailed analyses to identify\nthe reasons for such benefits, we observed that feedback information\nsubstantially shaped the representational geometry of the post-integration\nlayer, combining the bottom-up and top-down streams, and this effect was\namplified by dropout. Moreover, feedback signals coupled with dropout optimally\nconstrained network activity onto a low-dimensional manifold and encoded object\ninformation more efficiently in out-of-distribution regimes, with top-down\ninformation stabilizing the representational dynamics at the population level.\nTogether, these findings uncover a dual mechanism for resilient sensory coding.\nOn the one hand, neural stochasticity prevents unit-level co-adaptation albeit\nat the cost of more chaotic dynamics.

The system\nemploys a LightGBM-based regressor with incremental retraining, allowing\neducators to input updated student performance data, which automatically\ntriggers model updates. This adaptive mechanism enhances prediction accuracy by\nlearning from real-world academic progress over time.\n  The platform features a Flask-based web interface to support real-time\ninteraction and integrates SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) for model\ninterpretability, ensuring transparency and trustworthiness in predictions.\nExperimental results demonstrate a 10.7% reduction in RMSE after retraining,\nwith consistent upward adjustments in predicted scores for students who\nreceived interventions. By transforming static predictive models into\nself-improving systems, our approach advances educational analytics toward\nhuman-centered, data-driven, and responsive artificial intelligence. The\nframework is designed for seamless integration into Learning Management Systems\n(LMS) and institutional dashboards, facilitating practical deployment in real\neducational environments.",

    "abstract": "Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is an imaging technique widely\nused to study human brain activity. fMRI signals in areas across the brain\ntransiently synchronise and desynchronise their activity in a highly structured\nmanner, even when an individual is at rest. These functional connectivity\ndynamics may be related to behaviour and neuropsychiatric disease. To model\nthese dynamics, temporal brain connectivity representations are essential, as\nthey reflect evolving interactions between brain regions and provide insight\ninto transient neural states and network reconfigurations. However,\nconventional graph neural networks (GNNs) often struggle to capture long-range\ntemporal dependencies in dynamic fMRI data. To address this challenge, we\npropose BrainATCL, an unsupervised, nonparametric framework for adaptive\ntemporal brain connectivity learning, enabling functional link prediction and\nage estimation. Our method dynamically adjusts the lookback window for each\nsnapshot based on the rate of newly added edges. Graph sequences are\nsubsequently encoded using a GINE-Mamba2 backbone to learn spatial-temporal\nrepresentations of dynamic functional connectivity in resting-state fMRI data\nof 1,000 participants from the Human Connectome Project. To further improve\nspatial modeling, we incorporate brain structure and function-informed edge\nattributes, i.e., the left/right hemispheric identity and subnetwork membership\nof brain regions, enabling the model to capture biologically meaningful\ntopological patterns. We evaluate our BrainATCL on two tasks: functional link\nprediction and age estimation. The experimental results demonstrate superior\nperformance and strong generalization, including in cross-session prediction\nscenarios.",

First-principles approaches combined with the cluster variation method\n(CVM) or cluster expansion method (CEM) can capture SRO but suffer from high\ncomputational cost. Here we present a hybrid CVM-CALPHAD framework with a\nthermodynamic solid solution model named as FYL-CVM, enabled by the\nFowler-Yang-Li (FYL) transform to reduce the number of variables required in\nfree-energy minimization. This achieves efficient modeling of SRO in\nmulticomponent systems within the CALPHAD formalism. Benchmark tests on fcc AB\nbinaries show that FYL-CVM reproduces CVM phase diagrams with much higher\nefficiency, while non-configurational contributions from vibrational, elastic,\nand electronic terms are also incorporated to capture their physical effects on\norder-disorder boundaries. Applied to the Cu-Au system, this method produces\nphase diagrams with experimental data in an efficient parameterization and\nelucidates the temperature-composition dependence of SRO parameters via the SRO\ndiagram. Its applicability to ternary alloys is also demonstrated for the\nCu-Au-Ag system. Overall, this framework strikes a balance between accuracy and\nefficiency, extends CALPHAD to account for chemical SRO, and enables a\ncomprehensive physics-informed modeling of ordering phenomena.

We conducted a\nlarge-scale empirical study analyzing performance evolution in 15 mature\nopen-source Java projects hosted on GitHub. Our analysis encompassed 739\ncommits containing 1,499 method-level code changes, using Java Microbenchmark\nHarness (JMH) for precise performance measurement and rigorous statistical\nanalysis to quantify both the significance and magnitude of performance\nvariations. We employed bytecode instrumentation to capture method-specific\nexecution metrics and systematically analyzed four key aspects: temporal\nperformance patterns, code change type correlations, developer and complexity\nfactors, and domain-size interactions. Our findings reveal that 32.7% of\nmethod-level changes result in measurable performance impacts, with regressions\noccurring 1.3 times more frequently than improvements. Contrary to conventional\nwisdom, we found no significant differences in performance impact distributions\nacross code change categories, challenging risk-stratified development\nstrategies. Algorithmic changes demonstrate the highest improvement potential\nbut carry substantial regression risk.

It\nrepresents a 3D scene as cube-bounded surfels organized on an octree, where\neach surfel is further associated with a texture patch. By approximating a\nsmooth surface with a large surfel at a coarser level of the octree, it reduces\nthe number of primitives required to represent the 3D scene, and yet retains\nthe high-frequency texture details through the texture map attached to each\nsurfel. We further propose a compression scheme to encode the geometry and\ntexture efficiently, leveraging the octree structure.

In the first part,\nwe derive analytical lower and upper bounds for mixed moments of the form\n$\\mathbb{E}(X_1X_2^d)$, where $X_i \\sim F_i$ for $i=1,2$, assuming known\nmarginal distributions but unspecified dependence structure. The results are\ngeneral and applicable to arbitrary marginals and positive integer orders $d$,\nand we also identify the dependence structures that attain these bounds. These\nfindings are then applied to bound centered mixed moments and explore their\nmathematical properties.\n  The second part of the paper investigates the influence of higher-order\ncentered mixed moments on key actuarial quantities, including expected\nshortfall (ES), marginal expected shortfall (MES), and life annuity valuation.\nUnder a copula-based mixture model, we show that coskewness and other odd-order\nmixed moments exhibit a monotonic relationship with both ES and annuity\npremiums.

When\nsellers compete using such algorithms, one concern is that of tacit collusion -\nthe algorithms learn to coordinate on higher than competitive. We empirically\ninvestigate whether these concerns are valid when sellers make pricing and\nadvertising decisions together, i.e., two-dimensional decisions. Our empirical\nstrategy is to analyze competition with multi-agent reinforcement learning,\nwhich we calibrate to a large-scale dataset collected from Amazon.com products.\nOur first contribution is to find conditions under which learning algorithms\ncan facilitate win-win-win outcomes that are beneficial for consumers, sellers,\nand even the platform, when consumers have high search costs. In these cases\nthe algorithms learn to coordinate on prices that are lower than competitive\nprices. The intuition is that the algorithms learn to coordinate on lower\nadvertising bids, which lower advertising costs, leading to lower prices. Our\nsecond contribution is an analysis of a large-scale, high-frequency\nkeyword-product dataset for more than 2 million products on Amazon.com. Our\nestimates of consumer search costs show a wide range of costs for different\nproduct keywords. We generate an algorithm usage and find a negative\ninteraction between the estimated consumer search costs and the algorithm usage\nindex, providing empirical evidence of beneficial collusion. Finally, we\nanalyze the platform's strategic response. We find that reserve price\nadjustments will not increase profits for the platform, but commission\nadjustments will.

    "abstract": "Accurately accounting for mixed-gas opacities is critical for\nradiative-transfer (RT) calculations in sub-stellar atmospheres. To produce the\ntotal k-coefficients of an arbitrary mixture of gases and their associated\nvolume mixing ratios (VMRs), several methods are applied in the literature with\nvarious levels of overall accuracy and ease of computation. We propose a\nsimple, tunable random overlap method, polynomial reconstruction and sampling\n(PRAS). PRAS is a Monte Carlo-based technique, sampling polynomial\napproximations of the opacity cumulative distribution function (CDF) in a\nwavelength band for each species requiring mixing. The method enables control\nover the end accuracy of the opacity mixture through choices in CDF fitting and\nnumber of random samples used in the mixing scheme. We find PRAS is typically\nas accurate, or more accurate, than other methods at recovering individual,\npre-mixed k-coefficients. In an emission spectrum comparison test, PRAS, even\nwith a small number of samples (100), is within ~2% of the reference 16+16\nLegendre quadrature node random overlap with resorting and rebinning (RORR)\nresults, and is typically more accurate than the 4+4 and 8+8 Legendre node\nschemes. In the vertical flux and heating rate tests, we also find that PRAS is\ngenerally more accurate than other schemes, and an improvement over the\nadaptive equivalent extinction (AEE) method. Overall, our current tests show\nPRAS is a generally viable alternative for the calculation of randomly\noverlapped opacities, especially in scenarios where increased accuracy of the\nRT calculation is required and when larger numbers of quadrature points are\nused. PRAS may therefore provide a benefit in performance and accuracy for\nhigh-precision retrieval modelling of JWST data.",

Unlike classical\npolynomial interpolation, which is based on pointwise function evaluations,\nhistopolation reconstructs a function using integral data. However, similar to\nclassical polynomial interpolation, histopolation suffers from the well-known\nRunge phenomenon when integral data are based on a grid with many equispaced\nnodes, as well as the Gibbs phenomenon when approximating discontinuous\nfunctions. In contrast, quasi-histopolation is designed to relax the strict\nrequirement of passing through all the given data points. This inherent\nflexibility can reduce the likelihood of oscillatory behavior using, for\nexample, rational approximation operators. In this work, we introduce a\n$C^{\\infty}$ rational quasi-histopolation operator, for bounded (integrable)\nfunctions, which reconstruct a function by defeating both the Runge and Gibbs\nphenomena.

    "abstract": "False Data Injection Attacks (FDIAs) pose a significant threat to smart grid\ninfrastructures, particularly Home Area Networks (HANs), where real-time\nmonitoring and control are highly adopted. Owing to the comparatively less\nstringent security controls and widespread availability of HANs, attackers view\nthem as an attractive entry point to manipulate aggregated demand patterns,\nwhich can ultimately propagate and disrupt broader grid operations.

This paper presents a machine learning-based\nframework for both the detection and classification of FDIAs using residential\nenergy data. A real-time detection is provided by the lightweight Artificial\nNeural Network (ANN), which works by using the most vital features of energy\nconsumption, cost, and time context.

We validate our approach\nby applying SEMNet to construct SOHO/SEM EUV flux measurements in the period\nbetween 1998 and 2014 using CaII K images from the Precision Solar Photometric\nTelescope. We then extend SEMNet through transfer learning to reconstruct solar\nEUV irradiance in the period between 1950 and 1960 using CaII K images from the\nKodaikanal Solar Observatory. Experimental results show that SEMNet provides\nreliable predictions along with uncertainty bounds, demonstrating the\nfeasibility of CaII K images as a robust proxy for long-term EUV fluxes. These\nfindings contribute to a better understanding of solar influences on Earth's\nclimate over extended periods.",

    "abstract": "This work uses a chi-squared test of independence to determine if days that\ninclude earthquakes greater than or equal to magnitude 7 (M7+) from 1960 to\n2024 are truly independent of the position of Earth in its orbit around the\nsun. To this end, this study breaks up Earth's orbit into days offset on either\nside of two reference Earth-Sun-Planet orientations, or zero-points: opposition\nand inferior conjunction. A computer program is used to sample U.S.G.S.\nearthquake and N.A.S.A. Horizons ephemeris data for the last 64 years with the\npurpose of conducting 28,782 chi-squared tests-of-independence for all\nintervals (5 to 45 days) spanning the entirety of Earth's synodic period\nrelative to these zero points for Jupiter, Venus, Saturn, and Mars. For\nJupiter, 1,071 statistically significant intervals of M7+ activity are\nassociated with two particular points: the inferior conjunction and what is\nhere termed the \"preceding neap\" position. At both of these points, M7+\nactivity first increases (>125% average) and then sharply decreases in a\npulse-like fashion, with those lulls in M7+ activity (<75% of average) lasting\nabout a month. Both of these pulses of M7+ activity begin at\nSun-Observer-Target (SOT) Angles near 45 degrees and 135 degrees, and this also\nobserved for Venus and Saturn; Mars synodic period prevented any comparison of\nchi-squared intervals to SOT Angle. Although this study did not observe any\nobvious correlation of M7+ activity with the lunar cycle, the medians, means,\nand modes of the significant intervals returned by the chi-squared analysis for\nJupiter range from 27 to 34 days, suggesting that intervals are more likely to\nbe found significant by the chi-squared analysis if they average out the lunar\ncycle.",

Large Language Models (LLMs)\nhave demonstrated remarkable capabilities, surpassing earlier models in\ncomplexity and performance. Their evaluation across diverse tasks has\nconsistently showcased their potential, enabling the development of adaptive\nand personalized agents. However, despite these advancements, LLMs remain prone\nto errors, particularly in areas requiring nuanced moral reasoning. They\nstruggle with detecting implicit hate, offensive language, and gender biases\ndue to the subjective and context-dependent nature of these issues. Moreover,\ntheir reliance on training data can inadvertently reinforce societal biases,\nleading to inconsistencies and ethical concerns in their outputs. To explore\nthe limitations of LLMs in this role, we developed an experimental framework\nbased on state-of-the-art (SOTA) models to assess human emotions and offensive\nbehaviors. The framework introduces a unified benchmark dataset encompassing 49\ndistinct categories spanning the wide spectrum of human emotions, offensive and\nhateful text, and gender and racial biases. Furthermore, we introduced SafePhi,\na QLoRA fine-tuned version of Phi-4, adapting diverse ethical contexts and\noutperforming benchmark moderators by achieving a Macro F1 score of 0.89, where\nOpenAI Moderator and Llama Guard score 0.77 and 0.74, respectively.

The emergence of these methods prompts a revisit to the impact of data\npreprocessing, a topic familiar to the climate community, as more traditional\nstatistical models work with relatively small sample sizes. Indeed, the skill\nand confidence in the forecasts produced by data-driven models are directly\ninfluenced by the quality of the datasets and how they are treated during model\ndevelopment, thus yielding the colloquialism \"garbage in, garbage out.\" As\nsuch, this article establishes protocols for the proper preprocessing of input\ndata for AI/ML models designed for climate prediction (i.e., subseasonal to\ndecadal and longer). The three aims are to: (1) educate researchers,\ndevelopers, and end users on the effects that preprocessing has on climate\npredictions; (2) provide recommended practices for data preprocessing for such\napplications; and (3) empower end users to decipher whether the models they are\nusing are properly designed for their objectives. Specific topics covered in\nthis article include the creation of (standardized) anomalies, dealing with\nnon-stationarity and the spatiotemporally correlated nature of climate data,\nand handling of extreme values and variables with potentially complex\ndistributions. Case studies will illustrate how using different preprocessing\ntechniques can produce different predictions from the same model, which can\ncreate confusion and decrease confidence in the overall process. Ultimately,\nimplementing the recommended practices set forth in this article will enhance\nthe robustness and transparency of AI/ML in climate prediction studies.",

    "abstract": "Visualization design is often described as the process of solving a\nwell-defined problem by navigating a design space. While existing visualization\ndesign models have provided valuable structure and guidance, they tend to\nforeground technical problem-solving and underemphasize the interpretive,\njudgment-based aspects of design. In contrast, research in other design\ndisciplines has emphasized the importance of framing--how designers define and\nredefine what the problem is--and the co-evolution of problem and solution\nspaces through reflective practice. These dimensions remain underexplored in\nvisualization research, particularly from the perspective of expert\npractitioners. This paper investigates how visualization designers frame\nproblems and navigate the dynamic interplay between problem understanding and\nsolution development. We conducted a mixed-methods study with 11 expert\npractitioners using design challenges, diary entries, and semi-structured\ninterviews. Through reflexive thematic analysis, we identified key strategies\nthat participants used to frame problems, reframe them in response to evolving\nconstraints or insights, and build bridges between problem and solution spaces.\nThese included using metaphors, heuristics, sketching, primary generators, and\nreflective evaluation of failed or incomplete ideas. Our findings contribute an\nempirically grounded account of visualization design as a reflective,\nco-evolutionary practice, where framing is not a preliminary step but a\ncontinuous activity embedded in design. Participants often reshaped their\nunderstanding of the problem based on solution attempts, tool feedback, and\nethical or narrative concerns. These insights extend current visualization\ndesign models and highlight the need for frameworks that better account for\nframing and interpretive judgment. (See paper for full abstract.)",

However, due to\nthe scarcity of reasoning-intensive training data, existing rerankers perform\npoorly in many complex ranking scenarios and the ranking ability of\nreasoning-intensive rerankers remains largely underdeveloped. In this paper, we\nfirst propose an automated reasoning-intensive training data synthesis\nframework, which sources training queries and passages from diverse domains and\napplies DeepSeek-R1 to generate high-quality training labels. A\nself-consistency data filtering mechanism is designed to ensure the data\nquality. To empower the listwise reranker with strong reasoning ability, we\nfurther propose a two-stage post-training approach, which includes a cold-start\nsupervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage for reasoning pattern learning and a\nreinforcement learning (RL) stage for further ranking ability enhancement.\nDuring the RL stage, based on the nature of listwise ranking, we design a\nmulti-view ranking reward, which is more effective than a ranking metric-based\nreward. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our trained reasoning-intensive\nreranker \\textbf{ReasonRank} outperforms existing baselines significantly and\nalso achieves much lower latency than pointwise reranker Rank1. \\textbf{Through\nfurther experiments, our ReasonRank has achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA)\nperformance 40.6 on the BRIGHT\nleaderboard\\footnote{https://brightbenchmark.github.io/}.} Our codes are\navailable at https://github.com/8421BCD/ReasonRank.",

These characteristics make its core vector\nembeddings, i.e, the numerical representations of the music, highly susceptible\nto being learned, misused, or even stolen by models without accessing the\noriginal audio files. Traditional methods like copyright licensing and digital\nwatermarking offer limited protection for these abstract mathematical\nrepresentations, thus necessitating a stronger, e.g., cryptographic, approach\nto safeguarding the embeddings themselves. Standard encryption schemes, such as\nAES, render data unintelligible for computation, making such searches\nimpossible. While Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) provides a plausible\nsolution by allowing arbitrary computations on ciphertexts, its substantial\nperformance overhead remains impractical for large-scale vector similarity\nsearches.

    "abstract": "Bayesian model-based spatial clustering methods are widely used for their\nflexibility in estimating latent clusters with an unknown number of clusters\nwhile accounting for spatial proximity. Many existing methods are designed for\nclustering finite spatial units, limiting their ability to make predictions, or\nmay impose restrictive geometric constraints on the shapes of subregions.\nFurthermore, the posterior clustering consistency theory of spatial clustering\nmodels remains largely unexplored in the literature. In this study, we propose\na Spatial Domain Random Partition Model (Spat-RPM) and demonstrate its\napplication for spatially clustered regression, which extends spanning\ntree-based Bayesian spatial clustering by partitioning the spatial domain into\ndisjoint blocks and using spanning tree cuts to induce contiguous domain\npartitions. Under an infill-domain asymptotic framework, we introduce a new\ndistance metric to study the posterior concentration of domain partitions. We\nshow that Spat-RPM achieves a consistent estimation of domain partitions,\nincluding the number of clusters, and derive posterior concentration rates for\npartition, parameter, and prediction. We also establish conditions on the\nhyperparameters of priors and the number of blocks, offering important\npractical guidance for hyperparameter selection. Finally, we examine the\nasymptotic properties of our model through simulation studies and apply it to\nAtlantic Ocean data.",

To address this challenge, we propose OTAKNet, the first online\nsolution to noise-statistics drift within learning-based adaptive Kalman\nfiltering. Unlike existing learning-based methods that perform offline\nfine-tuning using batch pointwise matching over entire trajectories, OTAKNet\nestablishes a connection between the state estimate and the drift via one-step\npredictive measurement likelihood, and addresses it using optimal transport.\nThis leverages OT's geometry - aware cost and stable gradients to enable fully\nonline adaptation without ground truth labels or retraining. We compare OTAKNet\nagainst classical model-based adaptive Kalman filtering and offline\nlearning-based filtering. The performance is demonstrated on both synthetic and\nreal-world NCLT datasets, particularly under limited training data.",

Most previous works\nrely solely on feedback from tool agents to perceive environmental changes and\ntask status, which limits adaptability to real-time dynamics, causes error\naccumulation, and restricts tool flexibility.

However, modeling this progression\nremains challenging due to 1) the scarcity of longitudinal data obtained\nthrough irregular and infrequent subject visits and 2) the complex interplay of\npathological mechanisms across brain regions and disease stages, where\ntraditional models assume fixed mechanisms throughout disease progression. To\naddress these limitations, we propose a novel stage-aware Mixture of Experts\n(MoE) framework that explicitly models how different contributing mechanisms\ndominate at different disease stages through time-dependent expert\nweighting.Data-wise, we utilize an iterative dual optimization method to\nproperly estimate the temporal position of individual observations,\nconstructing a co hort-level progression trajectory from irregular snapshots.\nModel-wise, we enhance the spatial component with an inhomogeneous graph neural\ndiffusion model (IGND) that allows diffusivity to vary based on node states and\ntime, providing more flexible representations of brain networks. We also\nintroduce a localized neural reaction module to capture complex dynamics beyond\nstandard processes.The resulting IGND-MoE model dynamically integrates these\ncomponents across temporal states, offering a principled way to understand how\nstage-specific pathological mechanisms contribute to progression. The\nstage-wise weights yield novel clinical insights that align with literature,\nsuggesting that graph-related processes are more influential at early stages,\nwhile other unknown physical processes become dominant later on.",

The block error rate performance of the GLDPC codes, combined\nwith a complementary outer code, has been shown to outperform a variety of\nstate-of-the-art code and decoder designs with suitable lengths and rates for\nthe 5G ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) regime. A major\ndrawback of these codes is that it is not known how to construct appropriate\npolynomial matrices to encode them efficiently. In this paper, we analyze\npractical constructions of quasi-cyclic GLDPC (QC-GLDPC) codes and show how to\nconstruct polynomial generator matrices in various forms using minors of the\npolynomial matrix. The approach can be applied to fully generalized matrices or\npartially generalized (with mixed constraint node types) to find better\nperformance/rate trade-offs. The resulting encoding matrices are presented in\nuseful forms that facilitate efficient implementation. The rich substructure\ndisplayed also provides us with new methods of determining low weight\ncodewords, providing lower and upper bounds on the minimum distance and often\ngiving those of weight equal to the minimum distance. Based on the minors of\nthe polynomial parity-check matrix, we also give a formula for the rank of any\nparity-check matrix representing a QC-LDPC or QC-GLDPC code, and hence, the\ndimension of the code.

This work\npresents a comprehensive pipeline and a comparative study to address this\nlimitation. We first develop a series of increasingly sophisticated BC\nbaselines, culminating in a Transformer-based model that operates on a\nstructured, entity-centric state representation. While this model achieves low\nimitation loss, we show that it still fails in long-horizon simulations. We\nthen demonstrate that by applying a state-of-the-art Offline Reinforcement\nLearning algorithm, Conservative Q-Learning (CQL), to the same data and\narchitecture, we can learn a significantly more robust policy. Using a\ncarefully engineered reward function, the CQL agent learns a conservative value\nfunction that enables it to recover from minor errors and avoid\nout-of-distribution states. In a large-scale evaluation on 1,000 unseen\nscenarios from the Waymo Open Motion Dataset, our final CQL agent achieves a\n3.2x higher success rate and a 7.4x lower collision rate than the strongest BC\nbaseline, proving that an offline RL approach is critical for learning robust,\nlong-horizon driving policies from static expert data.",

We\nthen evaluated TFVA-style guardrails across 12,180 experiments on seven diverse\nlanguage model architectures. Results reveal architecture-dependent risk\npatterns: some vulnerabilities (e.g., identity confusion) are almost fully\nmitigated, while others (e.g., source interference) exhibit escalating\nbackfire, with error rates increasing by up to 135% in certain models. Humans,\nin contrast, show consistent moderate improvement. These findings reframe\ncognitive safety as a model-specific engineering problem: interventions\neffective in one architecture may fail, or actively harm, another, underscoring\nthe need for architecture-aware cognitive safety testing before deployment.",

    "abstract": "Serialized television narratives present significant analytical challenges\ndue to their complex, temporally distributed storylines that necessitate\nsophisticated information management. This paper introduces a multi-agent\nsystem (MAS) designed to extract and analyze narrative arcs by implementing\nprinciples of computational memory architectures. The system conceptualizes\nnarrative understanding through analogues of human memory: Large Language\nModels (LLMs) provide a form of semantic memory for general narrative patterns,\nwhile a vector database stores specific arc progressions as episodic memories.\nA multi-agent workflow simulates working memory processes to integrate these\ninformation types. Tested on the first season of Grey's Anatomy (ABC 2005-),\nthe MAS identifies three arc types: Anthology (self-contained), Soap\n(relationship-focused), and Genre-Specific. These arcs and their episodic\ndevelopments are stored in a vector database, facilitating structured analysis\nand semantic comparison. To bridge automation with critical interpretation, a\ngraphical interface enables human oversight and refinement of the system's\nnarrative memory. While demonstrating strong performance in identifying\nAnthology Arcs and character entities, the system's reliance on textual\nparatexts (episode summaries) revealed limitations in discerning overlapping\narcs and opaque dynamics, underscoring the challenges in computational memory\nconsolidation versus human holistic understanding. This memory-centric approach\nhighlights the potential of combining AI-driven memory processing with human\nexpertise. Beyond television, it offers promise for serialized written formats\nwhere narrative is entirely text-based. Future work will focus on integrating\nmultimodal inputs to enrich episodic memory, refining memory integration\nmechanisms within the MAS, and expanding testing across diverse genres.",

This\ntime-consuming offline process not only makes it difficult to scale with\ntraining dataset size, but also leads to sub-optimal solutions due to its\ndiscontinuous optimization routine. To solve these, we first present a novel\npseudo-mask algorithm, Fast Universal Agglomerative Pooling (UniAP). Each layer\nof UniAP can identify groups of similar nodes in parallel, allowing to generate\nboth semantic-level and instance-level and multi-granular pseudo-masks within\nens of milliseconds for one image. Based on the fast UniAP, we propose the\nScalable Self-Supervised Universal Segmentation (S2-UniSeg), which employs a\nstudent and a momentum teacher for continuous pretraining. A novel\nsegmentation-oriented pretext task, Query-wise Self-Distillation (QuerySD), is\nproposed to pretrain S2-UniSeg to learn the local-to-global correspondences.\nUnder the same setting, S2-UniSeg outperforms the SOTA UnSAM model, achieving\nnotable improvements of AP+6.9 on COCO, AR+11.1 on UVO, PixelAcc+4.5 on\nCOCOStuff-27, RQ+8.0 on Cityscapes.

This paper proposes an adaptive power capping\nframework tailored to cloud data centers. By dynamically setting the energy\nconsumption upper bound, the power load of data centers can be reshaped to\nalign with the electricity price or other market signals. To this end, we\nformulate the power capping problem as a partially observable Markov decision\nprocess.

However, the underlying mechanisms by which such a\nstraightforward approach overcomes the long-standing synthesis challenges of\nnon-vdW 2D materials remains a puzzle. Here, we investigate the crystallization\ndynamics and phase evolution of Bi under vdW confinement through molecular\ndynamics (MD) simulations powered by a machine-learning force filed fine-tuned\nand distilled from a pre-trained model with DFT-level accuracy. We reveal that\npressure-dependent layer modulation arises from a quantum confinement-driven\nanisotropic crystallization mechanism, in which out-of-plane layering occurs\nnearly two orders of magnitude faster than in-plane ordering. Two critical\ntransitions are identified: an alpha-to-beta phase transformation at 1.64 GPa,\nand a subsequent collapse into a single-atomic layer at 2.19 GPa. The formation\nof large-area single crystals is enabled by substrate-induced orientational\nselection and accelerated grain boundary migration, driven by atomic diffusion\nat elevated temperatures. These findings resolve the mechanistic origin of\nhigh-quality 2D crystal growth under confinement and establish guiding\nprinciples for the controlled synthesis of metastable 2D single crystals, with\nimplications for next-generation quantum and nanoelectronic devices.",

In 3321 observation\nsessions lasting 5 minutes, 35 strong pulses were detected with a\nsignal-to-noise ratio (S/N) greater than 10.

Our analysis, comparing SSD, CPU memory\n(DDR), and HBM storage scenarios for models like DeepSeek-R1, reveals that\noffloading MoE weights to current SSDs drastically increases\nper-token-generation energy consumption (e.g., by up to ~12x compared to the\nHBM baseline), dominating the total inference energy budget.

    "abstract": "This paper studies the problem of counting homomorphisms from a bipartite\nsource graph to a bipartite target graph. An exact formula is first derived for\nthe number of homomorphisms from a complete bipartite graph into a general\nbipartite graph. While exact, this formula is typically computationally\nintensive to evaluate. To address this, computable combinatorial lower bounds\nare established. When the target graph contains no 4-cycles, the lower bound\nsimplifies and becomes exact. Two additional lower bounds on the number of\nhomomorphisms from a complete bipartite graph to an arbitrary bipartite graph\nare derived using properties of Shannon entropy. The first depends only on the\nsizes of the partite sets in the source and target graphs, along with the edge\ndensity of the target graph. The second further incorporates the degree\nprofiles within the target's partite sets, yielding a strengthening of the\nfirst. Both entropy-based bounds improve upon the inequality implied by the\nvalidity of Sidorenko's conjecture for complete bipartite graphs. Lower bounds\nfor complete bipartite sources are combined with new auxiliary results to\nderive general lower bounds on homomorphism counts between arbitrary bipartite\ngraphs, while a known reverse Sidorenko inequality is employed to establish\ncorresponding upper bounds. The upper bound is attained when the source is a\ndisjoint union of complete bipartite graphs, and it admits a simple closed-form\nexpression when the target contains no 4-cycles. Numerical results compare the\nproposed easy-to-compute bounds with exact counts in computationally tractable\ncases.",

Previous studies have suggested that the Sun is relatively depleted\nin refractory elements compared to other solar twins or analogs, potentially as\na result of planet formation.

We aim to perform a homogeneous and precise abundance analysis of solar\ntwins and analogs that host planets, to investigate possible chemical\nsignatures associated with planet formation.\n  Methods. We obtain high-resolution, high signal-to-noise ratio Magellan/MIKE\nspectra for 25 solar-like stars, including 22 confirmed or candidate planet\nhosts and three comparison stars. Stellar parameters and elemental abundances\nfor 23 elements (from C to Eu) are derived through a strict line-by-line\ndifferential analysis relative to the Sun.\n  Results. Our sample spans [Fe/H] = -0.23 to +0.18 dex and includes 20 solar\nanalogs, six of which are solar twins. Typical abundance uncertainties range\nfrom 0.01 to 0.05 dex for lighter elements (e.g., Fe, Si, C, O, Na) and up to\n0.1 dex for neutron-capture elements. The Sun is consistently depleted in\nrefractory elements relative to all solar analogs and twins, regardless of\nplanet type. Stars hosting small planets tentatively show slightly stronger\nrefractory element depletion than those hosting giant planets, though the\ndifference is not yet statistically significant.\n  Conclusions.

This work aims to increase the representativeness of the\nvolume element by attenuating the mesh and size sensitivities in representative\nvolume element (RVE) modelling. A technique to alleviate mesh sensitivity in\nRVE modelling is proposed, which equalises the fracture energy observed from\ncomputational analysis with the real phenomenon, thereby keeping the response\nindependent of the bandwidth of strain localisation. Based on the hypothesis\nthat ensuring periodicity of strain, in addition to displacement periodicity\nacross the domain boundary and supplementing the capability of periodic\nboundary conditions (PBCs) to attenuate the size dependency in RVE modelling, a\nset of modified PBCs (MPBCs) are formulated. One thousand two hundred RVE\nsamples falling into combinations of five fibre volume fractions and four RVE\nsizes are analysed under transverse loading, and the ability of MPBCs to\nattenuate the effect of RVE size on the precision of material response,\nparticularly in the inelastic regime, is verified.

    "abstract": "Accurately predicting beam-level reference signal received power (RSRP) is\nessential for beam management in dense multi-user wireless networks, yet\nchallenging due to high measurement overhead and fast channel variations. This\npaper proposes Neural Beam Field (NBF), a hybrid neural-physical framework for\nefficient and interpretable spatial beam RSRP prediction. Central to our\napproach is the introduction of the Multi-path Conditional Power Profile\n(MCPP), which bridges site-specific multipath propagation with antenna/beam\nconfigurations via closed-form analytical modeling. We adopt a decoupled\n``blackbox-whitebox\" design: a Transformer-based deep neural network (DNN)\nlearns the MCPP from sparse user measurements and positions, while a\nphysics-inspired module analytically infers beam RSRP statistics. To improve\nconvergence and adaptivity, we further introduce a Pretrain-and-Calibrate (PaC)\nstrategy that leverages ray-tracing priors and on-site calibration using RSRP\ndata. Extensive simulations results demonstrate that NBF significantly\noutperforms conventional table-based channel knowledge maps (CKMs) and pure\nblackbox DNNs in prediction accuracy, training efficiency, and generalization,\nwhile maintaining a compact model size. The proposed framework offers a\nscalable and physically grounded solution for intelligent beam management in\nnext-generation dense wireless networks.",

    "abstract": "Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) is a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method\nwidely used in large language models (LLMs). It approximates the update of a\npretrained weight matrix $W\\in\\mathbb{R}^{m\\times n}$ by the product of two\nlow-rank matrices, $BA$, where $A \\in\\mathbb{R}^{r\\times n}$ and\n$B\\in\\mathbb{R}^{m\\times r} (r\\ll\\min\\{m,n\\})$. Increasing the dimension $r$\ncan raise the rank of LoRA weights (i.e., $BA$), which typically improves\nfine-tuning performance but also significantly increases the number of\ntrainable parameters. In this paper, we propose Block Diversified Low-Rank\nAdaptation (BoRA), which improves the rank of LoRA weights with a small number\nof additional parameters. Specifically, BoRA treats the product $BA$ as a block\nmatrix multiplication, where $A$ and $B$ are partitioned into $b$ blocks along\nthe columns and rows, respectively (i.e., $A=[A_1,\\dots,A_b]$ and\n$B=[B_1,\\dots,B_b]^\\top$). Consequently, the product $BA$ becomes the\nconcatenation of the block products $B_iA_j$ for $i,j\\in[b]$. To enhance the\ndiversity of different block products, BoRA introduces a unique diagonal matrix\n$\\Sigma_{i,j} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{r\\times r}$ for each block multiplication,\nresulting in $B_i \\Sigma_{i,j} A_j$. By leveraging these block-wise diagonal\nmatrices, BoRA increases the rank of LoRA weights by a factor of $b$ while only\nrequiring $b^2r$ additional parameters. Extensive experiments across multiple\ndatasets and models demonstrate the superiority of BoRA, and ablation studies\nfurther validate its scalability.",

The field has seen a range of innovations over the\nlast few years, with the introduction of deep learning-based approaches\nproviding significant improvements in the realism and naturalness of generated\noutputs. However, the lack of standardized evaluation metrics for SLP\napproaches hampers meaningful comparisons across different systems. To address\nthis, we introduce the first Sign Language Production Challenge, held as part\nof the third SLRTP Workshop at CVPR 2025. The competition's aims are to\nevaluate architectures that translate from spoken language sentences to a\nsequence of skeleton poses, known as Text-to-Pose (T2P) translation, over a\nrange of metrics. For our evaluation data, we use the\nRWTH-PHOENIX-Weather-2014T dataset, a German Sign Language - Deutsche\nGebardensprache (DGS) weather broadcast dataset. In addition, we curate a\ncustom hidden test set from a similar domain of discourse. This paper presents\nthe challenge design and the winning methodologies.

    "abstract": "We currently see a steady rise in the usage and size of multiprocessor\nsystems, and so the community is evermore interested in developing fast\nparallel processing algorithms. However, most algorithms require a\nsynchronization mechanism, which is costly in terms of computational resources\nand time. If an algorithm can be executed in asynchrony, then it can use all\nthe available computation power, and the nodes can execute without being\nscheduled or locked. However, to show that an algorithm guarantees convergence\nin asynchrony, we need to generate the entire global state transition graph and\ncheck for the absence of cycles. This takes time exponential in the size of the\nglobal state space. In this dissertation, we present a theory that explains the\nnecessary and sufficient properties of a multiprocessor algorithm that\nguarantees convergence even without synchronization. We develop algorithms for\nvarious problems that do not require synchronization. Additionally, we show for\nseveral existing algorithms that they can be executed without any\nsynchronization mechanism. A significant theoretical benefit of our work is in\nproving that an algorithm can converge even in asynchrony. Our theory implies\nthat we can make such conclusions about an algorithm, by only showing that the\nlocal state transition graph of a computing node forms a partial order, rather\nthan generating the entire global state space and determining the absence of\ncycles in it. Thus, the complexity of rendering such proofs, formal or social,\nis phenomenally reduced. Experiments show a significant reduction in time taken\nto converge, when we compare the execution time of algorithms in the literature\nversus the algorithms that we design. We get similar results when we run an\nalgorithm, that guarantees convergence in asynchrony, under a scheduler versus\nin asynchrony.",

However, existing works have low serving performance\nfor these multi-agent applications, mainly due to the ignorance of inter-agent\nlatency and resource differences for request scheduling. We therefore propose\nKairos, a multi-agent orchestration system that optimizes end-to-end latency\nfor multi-agent applications. Kairos consists of a workflow orchestrator, a\nworkflow-aware priority scheduler, and a memory-aware dispatcher. The\norchestrator collects agent-specific information for online workflow analysis.\nThe scheduler decides the serving priority of the requests based on their\nlatency characteristics to reduce the overall queuing. The dispatcher\ndispatches the requests to different LLM instances based on their memory\ndemands to avoid GPU overloading.

Recent single-stage\nmethods attempt to unify SFT and RL using heuristics, but lack a principled\nmechanism for dynamically balancing the two paradigms. In this paper, we\nreframe this challenge through the theoretical lens of \\textbf{implicit\nrewards}, viewing SFT and RL not as distinct methods but as complementary\nreward signals. We introduce \\textbf{Adaptive Meta Fine-Tuning (AMFT)}, a novel\nsingle-stage algorithm that learns the optimal balance between SFT's implicit,\npath-level reward and RL's explicit, outcome-based reward. The core of AMFT is\na \\textbf{meta-gradient adaptive weight controller} that treats the SFT-RL\nbalance as a learnable parameter, dynamically optimizing it to maximize\nlong-term task performance. This forward-looking approach, regularized by\npolicy entropy for stability, autonomously discovers an effective training\ncurriculum. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation on challenging benchmarks\nspanning mathematical reasoning, abstract visual reasoning (General Points),\nand vision-language navigation (V-IRL). AMFT consistently establishes a new\nstate-of-the-art and demonstrats superior generalization on out-of-distribution\n(OOD) tasks.

Natural language (NL) prompts act as the\n``APIs'' for human-LLM interaction. To improve prompt quality, best practices\nfor prompt engineering (PE) have been developed, including writing guidelines\nand templates. Building on this, we propose Controlled NL for Prompt (CNL-P),\nwhich not only incorporates PE best practices but also draws on key principles\nfrom software engineering (SE). CNL-P introduces precise grammar structures and\nstrict semantic norms, further eliminating NL's ambiguity, allowing for a\ndeclarative but structured and accurate expression of user intent. This helps\nLLMs better interpret and execute the prompts, leading to more consistent and\nhigher-quality outputs. We also introduce an NL2CNL-P conversion tool based on\nLLMs, enabling users to write prompts in NL, which are then transformed into\nCNL-P format, thus lowering the learning curve of CNL-P. In particular, we\ndevelop a linting tool that checks CNL-P prompts for syntactic and semantic\naccuracy, applying static analysis techniques to NL for the first time.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that CNL-P enhances the quality of LLM\nresponses through the novel and organic synergy of PE and SE. We believe that\nCNL-P can bridge the gap between emerging PE and traditional SE, laying the\nfoundation for a new programming paradigm centered around NL.",

Combining atomic-resolution scanning\ntransmission electron microscopy, density first-principles calculations, and\ndiscrete dislocation dynamics simulations, we identify high-density, sessile\nFrank dislocation loops with zero-net Burgers vectors as the key mechanism.\nThese loops form via an energetically favorable transformation from mixed\nperfect dislocations under stress, a process unique to iridium among\nface-centered cubic metals. The immobile loops act as potent barriers,\ndrastically increasing yield strength and work hardening by impeding\ndislocation glide and consuming mobile dislocations. This dominance of these\nfindings deepens the understanding of iridium's brittleness and offers a\npathway for designing more ductile variants of this critical material.",

The proposed\nchannel selection method uses the hearing aid user's head-steering direction to\nidentify the remote channel originating from the frontal direction of the\nhearing aid user, which captures the target talker signal. We pose the channel\nselection task as a multiple hypothesis testing problem, and derive a maximum\nlikelihood solution. Under realistic, simplifying assumptions, the solution\nselects the remote channel which has the highest weighted squared absolute\ncorrelation coefficient with the output of the head-steered hearing aid\nbeamformer. We analyze the performance of the proposed channel selection method\nusing close-talking remote microphones and table microphone arrays.

    "abstract": "Automated translation of legacy C code into Rust aims to ensure memory safety\nwhile reducing the burden of manual migration. Early approaches in code\ntranslation rely on static rule-based methods, but they suffer from limited\ncoverage due to dependence on predefined rule patterns. Recent works regard the\ntask as a sequence-to-sequence problem by leveraging large language models\n(LLMs). Although these LLM-based methods are capable of reducing unsafe code\nblocks, the translated code often exhibits issues in following Rust rules and\nmaintaining semantic consistency. On one hand, existing methods adopt a direct\nprompting strategy to translate the C code, which struggles to accommodate the\nsyntactic rules between C and Rust. On the other hand, this strategy makes it\ndifficult for LLMs to accurately capture the semantics of complex code. To\naddress these challenges, we propose IRENE, an LLM-based framework that\nIntegrates RulEs aNd sEmantics to enhance translation. IRENE consists of three\nmodules: 1) a rule-augmented retrieval module that selects relevant translation\nexamples based on rules generated from a static analyzer developed by us,\nthereby improving the handling of Rust rules; 2) a structured summarization\nmodule that produces a structured summary for guiding LLMs to enhance the\nsemantic understanding of C code; 3) an error-driven translation module that\nleverages compiler diagnostics to iteratively refine translations. We evaluate\nIRENE on two datasets (xCodeEval, a public dataset, and HW-Bench, an industrial\ndataset provided by Huawei) and eight LLMs, focusing on translation accuracy\nand safety.",

However, their effectiveness is limited when\nrelying solely on molecular sequences, which fail to capture the complex\nstructures of molecules. Beyond sequence representation, molecules exhibit two\ncomplementary structural views: the first focuses on the topological\nrelationships between atoms, as exemplified by the graph view; and the second\nemphasizes the spatial configuration of molecules, as represented by the image\nview. The two types of views provide unique insights into molecular structures.\nTo leverage these views collaboratively, we propose the CROss-view Prefixes\n(CROP) to enhance LLMs' molecular understanding through efficient multi-view\nintegration.

In this paper, we propose QuiZSF (Quick Zero-Shot Time Series\nForecaster), a lightweight and modular framework that couples efficient\nretrieval with representation learning and model adaptation for ZSF.\nSpecifically, we construct a hierarchical tree-structured ChronoRAG Base (CRB)\nfor scalable time-series storage and domain-aware retrieval, introduce a\nMulti-grained Series Interaction Learner (MSIL) to extract fine- and\ncoarse-grained relational features, and develop a dual-branch Model Cooperation\nCoherer (MCC) that aligns retrieved knowledge with two kinds of TSPMs: Non-LLM\nbased and LLM based. Compared with contemporary baselines, QuiZSF, with Non-LLM\nbased and LLM based TSPMs as base model, respectively, ranks Top1 in 75% and\n87.5% of prediction settings, while maintaining high efficiency in memory and\ninference time.",

Nevertheless, how to improve the overall quality of\ngenerated Chinese character images remains a tough issue. In this paper, we\nconduct a holistic survey of the recent Chinese font generation approaches\nbased on deep learning. To be specific, we first illustrate the research\nbackground of the task. Then, we outline our literature selection and analysis\nmethodology, and review a series of related fundamentals, including classical\ndeep learning architectures, font representation formats, public datasets, and\nfrequently-used evaluation metrics. After that, relying on the number of\nreference samples required to generate a new font, we categorize the existing\nmethods into two major groups: many-shot font generation and few-shot font\ngeneration methods. Within each category, representative approaches are\nsummarized, and their strengths and limitations are also discussed in detail.\nFinally, we conclude our paper with the challenges and future directions, with\nthe expectation to provide some valuable illuminations for the researchers in\nthis field.",

While GDBA provides a comprehensive rule set to escape\npremature convergence, its empirical benefits remain marginal on general-valued\nproblems. In this work, we systematically examine GDBA and identify three\nfactors that potentially lead to its inferior performance, i.e.,\nover-aggressive constraint violation conditions, unbounded penalty\naccumulation, and uncoordinated penalty updates. To address these issues, we\npropose Distributed Guided Local Search (DGLS), a novel GLS framework for DCOPs\nthat incorporates an adaptive violation condition to selectively penalize\nconstraints with high cost, a penalty evaporation mechanism to control the\nmagnitude of penalization, and a synchronization scheme for coordinated penalty\nupdates. We theoretically show that the penalty values are bounded, and agents\nplay a potential game in our DGLS. Our extensive empirical results on various\nstandard benchmarks demonstrate the great superiority of DGLS over\nstate-of-the-art baselines.

This raises a central\nquestion: Under certain conditions, structurally heterogeneous networks can\nexhibit high functional fairness. To systematically address this issue, we\nintroduce a new metric, Network Imbalance (I), designed to quantitatively\nassess end-to-end accessibility fairness from a perceived QoS perspective. By\ncombining a tunable sigmoid function with a global Shannon entropy framework,\nthe I metric quantifies the uniformity of connection experiences between all\nnode pairs. We analyze the mathematical properties of this metric and validate\nits explanatory power on various classical network models. Our findings reveal\nthat low imbalance (i.e., high functional fairness) can be achieved through two\ndistinct mechanisms: one via topological symmetry (e.g., in a complete graph)\nand the other via extreme connection efficiency driven by structural inequality\n(e.g., in a scale-free network). This decoupling of structure and function\nprovides a new theoretical perspective for network performance evaluation and\noffers an effective quantitative tool for balancing efficiency and fairness in\nnetwork design.",

The inherent gap between visual and\ntextual modalities makes the embeddings from the vision projector critical for\nvisual comprehension. However, current alignment approaches treat visual\nembeddings as contextual cues and merely apply auto-regressive supervision to\ntextual outputs, neglecting the necessity of introducing equivalent direct\nvisual supervision, which hinders the potential finer alignment of visual\nembeddings. In this paper, based on our analysis of the refinement process of\nvisual embeddings in the LLM's shallow layers, we propose BASIC, a method that\nutilizes refined visual embeddings within the LLM as supervision to directly\nguide the projector in generating initial visual embeddings. Specifically, the\nguidance is conducted from two perspectives: (i) optimizing embedding\ndirections by reducing angles between initial and supervisory embeddings in\nsemantic space; (ii) improving semantic matching by minimizing disparities\nbetween the logit distributions of both visual embeddings.

    "abstract": "This paper examines systematic put-writing strategies applied to S&P 500\nIndex options, with a focus on position sizing as a key determinant of\nlong-term performance. Despite the well-documented volatility risk premium,\nwhere implied volatility exceeds realized volatility, the practical\nimplementation of short-dated volatility-selling strategies remains\nunderdeveloped in the literature. This study evaluates three position sizing\napproaches: the Kelly criterion, VIX-based volatility regime scaling, and a\nnovel hybrid method combining both. Using SPXW options with expirations from 0\nto 5 days, the analysis explores a broad design space, including moneyness\nlevels, volatility estimators, and memory horizons. Results show that\nultra-short-dated, far out-of-the-money options deliver superior risk-adjusted\nreturns. The hybrid sizing method consistently balances return generation with\nrobust drawdown control, particularly under low-volatility conditions such as\nthose seen in 2024. The study offers new insights into volatility harvesting,\nintroducing a dynamic sizing framework that adapts to shifting market regimes.\nIt also contributes practical guidance for constructing short-dated option\nstrategies that are robust across market environments.

We propose a novel framework SBS (Score-Before-Speaking), which\noutperforms previous methods and yields improvements for both million and\nbillion-parameter models. Unlike previous methods, SBS unifies the learning of\nresponses and their relative quality into a single step. The key innovation is\nto train a dialogue model to correlate augmented responses with a quality score\nduring training and then leverage this knowledge at inference. We use\nnoun-based substitution for augmentation and semantic similarity-based scores\nas a proxy for response quality. Through extensive experiments with benchmark\ndatasets (PERSONA-CHAT and ConvAI2), we show that score-conditioned training\nallows existing models to better capture a spectrum of persona-consistent\ndialogues.

While a bright soliton exhibits a density peak, a\ndark soliton presents as a defect on a continuous wave background. A\ndistinctive feature of dark solitons is the abrupt phase change in their wave\nfunction, which can host Majorana zero modes in topological fermionic\nsuperfluids. Recent studies have shown that bright solitons can undergo\nquantized transport through Thouless pumping, where the bright soliton\nfunctions as a Wannier function. However, it remains unclear whether Thouless\npumping can also occur for dark solitons, which fundamentally differ from\nbright solitons. Here, we theoretically demonstrate the occurrence of both\ninteger and fractional Thouless pumping for dark solitons within both a\ncontinuous model under optical lattices and a tight-binding model.\nSpecifically, we find that a dark soliton is transported by one or half a unit\ncell, following the center-of-mass position of a Wannier function, as a system\nparameter is slowly varied over one cycle.

Finally, a\nstate-space model (SSM)-based predictor performs downstream task inference.\nEvaluated on the Cambridge Centre for Ageing and Neuroscience (Cam-CAN)\ndataset, our framework achieved mean absolute errors (MAEs) of 5.343 for age\nprediction and 2.940 for fluid intelligence, with Pearson correlation\ncoefficients (PCCs) of 0.928 and 0.887, respectively-outperforming existing\nstate-of-the-art methods. Visualization of expert distribution weights further\nenhances interpretability by identifying key brain regions. This work provides\na robust, interpretable alternative to LLM-based approaches for fMRI analysis,\noffering novel insights into brain aging and cognitive function.",

As a method to overcome these problems, ensemble, commonly known as\nmodel combining, is being extensively used in the field of machine learning.\nAmong ensemble learning methods, voting ensembles have been studied with\nvarious weighting methods, showing performance improvements. However, the\nexisting methods that reflect the pre-information of classifiers in weights\nconsider only one evaluation criterion, which limits the reflection of various\ninformation that should be considered in a model realistically.

Yet, how well people perceive slope and\nacceleration-key features of data trends-remains poorly understood. Drawing on\npeople's natural abilities to perceive tempo, we introduce a novel sampling\nmethod for pitch-based sonification to enhance the perception of slope and\nacceleration in univariate functions. While traditional sonification methods\noften sample data at uniform x-spacing, yielding notes played at a fixed tempo\nwith variable pitch intervals (Variable Pitch Interval), our approach samples\nat uniform y-spacing, producing notes with consistent pitch intervals but\nvariable tempo (Variable Tempo). We conducted psychoacoustic experiments to\nunderstand slope and acceleration perception across three sampling methods:\nVariable Pitch Interval, Variable Tempo, and a Continuous (no sampling)\nbaseline. In slope comparison tasks, Variable Tempo was more accurate than the\nother methods when modulated by the magnitude ratio between slopes. For\nacceleration perception, just-noticeable differences under Variable Tempo were\nover 13 times finer than with other methods. Participants also commonly\nreported higher confidence, lower mental effort, and a stronger preference for\nVariable Tempo compared to other methods.

A critical and\nwidely adopted strategy for making this task computationally tractable is\nkeyframe retrieval, which seeks to identify a sparse set of video frames that\nare most salient to a given textual query. However, the efficacy of this\napproach is hindered by weak multimodal alignment between textual queries and\nvisual content and fails to capture the complex temporal semantic information\nrequired for precise reasoning. To address this, we propose Visual-Subtitle\nIntegeration(VSI), a multimodal keyframe search method that integrates\nsubtitles, timestamps, and scene boundaries into a unified multimodal search\nprocess. The proposed method captures the visual information of video frames as\nwell as the complementary textual information through a dual-stream search\nmechanism by Video Search Stream as well as Subtitle Match Stream,\nrespectively, and improves the keyframe search accuracy through the interaction\nof the two search streams. Experimental results show that VSI achieve 40.00%\nkey frame localization accuracy on the text-relevant subset of LongVideoBench\nand 68.48% accuracy on downstream long Video-QA tasks, surpassing competitive\nbaselines by 20.35% and 15.79%, respectively.

It is desirable to design UAVs'\ntrajectories and user to UAV assignments to ensure satisfactory service to the\nusers and energy efficient operation simultaneously. The posed optimization\nproblem is challenging to solve because: (i) The formulated problem is\nnon-convex, (ii) Due to the mobility of ground users, their future positions\nand channel gains are not known in advance, (iii) Local UAVs' observations\nshould be communicated to a central entity that solves the optimization\nproblem. The (semi-) centralized processing leads to communication overhead,\ncommunication/processing bottlenecks, lack of flexibility and scalability, and\nloss of robustness to system failures. To simultaneously address all these\nlimitations, we advocate a fully decentralized setup with no centralized\nentity.

Finally, we apply our PCA-based test to selected real\ngravitational-wave events from GWTC-3, including GW190814 and GW190412. We\npresent joint constraints from selected binary black hole events in GWTC-3,\nfinding that the 90% credible bound on the most informative PCA parameter is\n$0.03^{+0.08}_{-0.08}$ in the TIGER framework and $-0.01^{+0.05}_{-0.04}$ in\nthe FTI framework, both of which are consistent with GR. These results\nhighlight the sensitivity and robustness of the PCA-based approach and\ndemonstrate its readiness for application to future observational data from the\nfourth observing runs of LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA.",

The attendant\nchallenge is that Augmented Lagrange Method (ALM)-based alternating\nminimization algorithms cannot guarantee convergence when applied directly to\nour nonconvex, nonsmooth model, thus resulting in poor generalization ability.\nTo address it, we develop an alternating quadratic penalty (AQP) method with\nglobal convergence, where two subproblems are iteratively solved by closed-form\nsolutions.

To ground our framework,\nwe examine three application domains (i) education, (ii) healthcare, and (iii)\ncultural alignment, illustrating how lived experience informs user goals,\nsystem expectations, and ethical considerations in each context. We further\nincorporate insights from AI system operators and human-AI partnerships to\nhighlight challenges in responsibility allocation, mental model calibration,\nand long-term system adaptation. We conclude with actionable recommendations\nfor developing experience-centered AI systems that are not only technically\nrobust but also empathetic, context-aware, and aligned with human realities.\nThis work offers a foundation for future research that bridges technical\ndevelopment with the lived experiences of those impacted by AI systems.",

    "abstract": "High-dimensional Bayesian Optimization (BO) has attracted significant\nattention in recent research. However, existing methods have mainly focused on\noptimizing in continuous domains, while combinatorial (ordinal and categorical)\nand mixed domains still remain challenging. In this paper, we first propose\nMOCA-HESP, a novel high-dimensional BO method for combinatorial and mixed\nvariables. The key idea is to leverage the hyper-ellipsoid space partitioning\n(HESP) technique with different categorical encoders to work with\nhigh-dimensional, combinatorial and mixed spaces, while adaptively selecting\nthe optimal encoders for HESP using a multi-armed bandit technique. Our method,\nMOCA-HESP, is designed as a \\textit{meta-algorithm} such that it can\nincorporate other combinatorial and mixed BO optimizers to further enhance the\noptimizers' performance. Finally, we develop three practical BO methods by\nintegrating MOCA-HESP with state-of-the-art BO optimizers for combinatorial and\nmixed variables: standard BO, CASMOPOLITAN, and Bounce. Our experimental\nresults on various synthetic and real-world benchmarks show that our methods\noutperform existing baselines.

    "abstract": "Several international agreements have called for the rapid expansion of\nprotected areas to halt biodiversity declines. However, recent research has\nshown that expanding protected areas may be less cost-effective than\nredirecting resources towards threat management in existing reserves. These\nfindings often assume that threats are homogeneously distributed in the\nlandscape. In some cases, threats are more concentrated near the edge of\nprotected areas. As protected areas expand, core habitat in the centre expands\nmore rapidly than its edge, potentially creating a refuge from threats. In this\npaper, we present a framework linking protected area expansion and threat\nmanagement to extinction risk, via their impact on population carrying capacity\nand growth rate within core and edge habitats. We demonstrate the framework\nusing a simple population model where individuals are uniformly distributed in\na circular protected area threatened by poachers who penetrate the protected\narea to a fixed distance. We parameterise the model for Peter's Duiker\n(Cephalophus callipygus) harvested for food in the dense undergrowth of African\nforests using snares. Expanding protected areas can reduce extinction risk more\neffectively compared to an equivalent investment in snare removal for larger\nprotected areas that already sustain core unhunted habitat. Our results\ndemonstrate the importance of protected area expansion in buffering susceptible\npopulations from fixed hunting pressure restricted to protected area edges.\nHowever, for cases where threats, wildlife, and managers respond to each other\nstrategically in space, the relative importance of expansion versus increased\nmanagement remains a significant open problem.",

    "abstract": "We propose a novel framework for adaptively learning the time-evolving\nsolutions of stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) using\nscore-based diffusion models within a recursive Bayesian inference setting.\nSPDEs play a central role in modeling complex physical systems under\nuncertainty, but their numerical solutions often suffer from model errors and\nreduced accuracy due to incomplete physical knowledge and environmental\nvariability. To address these challenges, we encode the governing physics into\nthe score function of a diffusion model using simulation data and incorporate\nobservational information via a likelihood-based correction in a reverse-time\nstochastic differential equation. This enables adaptive learning through\niterative refinement of the solution as new data becomes available. To improve\ncomputational efficiency in high-dimensional settings, we introduce the\nensemble score filter, a training-free approximation of the score function\ndesigned for real-time inference. Numerical experiments on benchmark SPDEs\ndemonstrate the accuracy and robustness of the proposed method under sparse and\nnoisy observations.",

    "abstract": "The mainstream paradigm of remote sensing image interpretation has long been\ndominated by vision-centered models, which rely on visual features for semantic\nunderstanding. However, these models face inherent limitations in handling\nmulti-modal reasoning, semantic abstraction, and interactive decision-making.\nWhile recent advances have introduced Large Language Models (LLMs) into remote\nsensing workflows, existing studies primarily focus on downstream applications,\nlacking a unified theoretical framework that explains the cognitive role of\nlanguage. This review advocates a paradigm shift from vision-centered to\nlanguage-centered remote sensing interpretation. Drawing inspiration from the\nGlobal Workspace Theory (GWT) of human cognition, We propose a\nlanguage-centered framework for remote sensing interpretation that treats LLMs\nas the cognitive central hub integrating perceptual, task, knowledge and action\nspaces to enable unified understanding, reasoning, and decision-making. We\nfirst explore the potential of LLMs as the central cognitive component in\nremote sensing interpretation, and then summarize core technical challenges,\nincluding unified multimodal representation, knowledge association, and\nreasoning and decision-making. Furthermore, we construct a global\nworkspace-driven interpretation mechanism and review how language-centered\nsolutions address each challenge. Finally, we outline future research\ndirections from four perspectives: adaptive alignment of multimodal data, task\nunderstanding under dynamic knowledge constraints, trustworthy reasoning, and\nautonomous interaction. This work aims to provide a conceptual foundation for\nthe next generation of remote sensing interpretation systems and establish a\nroadmap toward cognition-driven intelligent geospatial analysis.",

    "abstract": "Adapting person re-identification (reID) models to new target environments\nremains a challenging problem that is typically addressed using unsupervised\ndomain adaptation (UDA) methods. Recent works show that when labeled data\noriginates from several distinct sources (e.g., datasets and cameras),\nconsidering each source separately and applying multi-source domain adaptation\n(MSDA) typically yields higher accuracy and robustness compared to blending the\nsources and performing conventional UDA. However, state-of-the-art MSDA methods\nlearn domain-specific backbone models or require access to source domain data\nduring adaptation, resulting in significant growth in training parameters and\ncomputational cost. In this paper, a Source-free Adaptive Gated Experts\n(SAGE-reID) method is introduced for person reID. Our SAGE-reID is a\ncost-effective, source-free MSDA method that first trains individual\nsource-specific low-rank adapters (LoRA) through source-free UDA. Next, a\nlightweight gating network is introduced and trained to dynamically assign\noptimal merging weights for fusion of LoRA experts, enabling effective\ncross-domain knowledge transfer. While the number of backbone parameters\nremains constant across source domains, LoRA experts scale linearly but remain\nnegligible in size (<= 2% of the backbone), reducing both the memory\nconsumption and risk of overfitting. Extensive experiments conducted on three\nchallenging benchmarks: Market-1501, DukeMTMC-reID, and MSMT17 indicate that\nSAGE-reID outperforms state-of-the-art methods while being computationally\nefficient.",

    "abstract": "Automatic Modulation Classification (AMC) plays a significant role in modern\ncognitive and intelligent radio systems, where accurate identification of\nmodulation is crucial for adaptive communication. The presence of heterogeneous\nwireless channel conditions, such as Rayleigh and Rician fading, poses\nsignificant challenges to the generalization ability of conventional AMC\nmodels. In this work, a domain-adversarial neural network (DANN) based deep\nlearning framework is proposed that explicitly mitigates channel-induced\ndistribution shifts between source and target domains. The approach is\nevaluated using a comprehensive simulated dataset containing five modulation\nschemes (BPSK, QPSK, 16QAM, 64QAM, 256QAM) across Rayleigh and Rician fading\nchannels at five frequency bands. Comparative experiments demonstrate that the\nDANN-based model achieves up to 14.93% absolute accuracy improvement in certain\nmodulation cases compared to a baseline supervised model trained solely on the\nsource domain.

Existing studies\ncaution that these tensions may not meaningfully reduce U.S. dependence on\nChina-linked supply chains. This study examines the drivers of this unmet\nreallocation under overlapping geopolitical and public health disruptions. It\ninvestigates how these shocks jointly reconfigured bilateral trade and global\nvalue chain (GVC) participation and positioning among the U.S., China, and\nmajor trading partners during 2016-2023. Using monthly bilateral trade data\nacross all sectors and multi-regional input-output tables for GVC\ndecomposition, we combine a multi-period event-study with structural analysis\nto evaluate trade-flow disruptions and shifts in participation and functional\npositioning within GVCs. We find that China's exports remained robust, expanded\nacross global markets, and sustained a rise in GVC participation, becoming more\nembedded in upstream segments through increased intermediate shipments to Asia\nand Europe. Meanwhile, U.S. imports increasingly shifted toward \"China+1\"\npartners, especially ASEAN, whose trade structures remain closely tied to\nChinese upstream supply chains. These strengthening triangular relationships\nreveal how global reallocation and GVCs have evolved around the U.S. and China\nacross successive shocks. Based on the evidence, we propose a supply chain\nresilience framework defined by three interacting dimensions: the level of GVC\nparticipation, the functional position within the value chain, and a country's\ncapacity to re-couple in the post-shock landscape, conditioned by market\ndiversification, economic complexity, and institutional capability.

    "abstract": "The task of parsing subcutaneous vessels in clinical images is often hindered\nby the high cost and limited availability of ground truth data, as well as the\nchallenge of low contrast and noisy vessel appearances across different\npatients and imaging modalities. In this work, we propose a novel weakly\nsupervised training framework specifically designed for subcutaneous vessel\nsegmentation. This method utilizes low-cost, sparse annotations such as\ncenterline traces, dot markers, or short scribbles to guide the learning\nprocess. These sparse annotations are expanded into dense probabilistic\nsupervision through a differentiable random walk label propagation model, which\nintegrates vesselness cues and tubular continuity priors driven by image data.\nThe label propagation process results in per-pixel hitting probabilities and\nuncertainty estimates, which are incorporated into an uncertainty-weighted loss\nfunction to prevent overfitting in ambiguous areas. Notably, the label\npropagation model is trained jointly with a CNN-based segmentation network,\nallowing the system to learn vessel boundaries and continuity constraints\nwithout the need for explicit edge supervision. Additionally, we introduce a\ntopology-aware regularizer that encourages centerline connectivity and\npenalizes irrelevant branches, further enhancing clinical applicability. Our\nexperiments on clinical subcutaneous imaging datasets demonstrate that our\napproach consistently outperforms both naive sparse-label training and\ntraditional dense pseudo-labeling methods, yielding more accurate vascular maps\nand better-calibrated uncertainty, which is crucial for clinical\ndecision-making. This method significantly reduces the annotation workload\nwhile maintaining clinically relevant vessel topology.",

The accurate delineation of\nmelanocytic tumors in dermoscopic images is a crucial component of automated\nskin cancer screening systems and clinical decision support. In this paper, we\npresent a novel dual-resolution architecture inspired by ResNet, specifically\ntailored for the segmentation of melanocytic tumors. Our approach incorporates\na high-resolution stream that preserves fine boundary details, alongside a\ncomplementary pooled stream that captures multi-scale contextual information\nfor robust lesion recognition. These two streams are closely integrated through\nboundary-aware residual connections, which inject edge information into deep\nfeature maps, and a channel attention mechanism that adapts the model's\nsensitivity to color and texture variations in dermoscopic images. To tackle\ncommon imaging artifacts and the challenges posed by small clinical datasets,\nwe introduce a lightweight artifact suppression block and a multi-task training\nstrategy. This strategy combines the Dice-Tversky loss with an explicit\nboundary loss and a contrastive regularizer to enhance feature stability. This\nunified design enables the model to generate pixel-accurate segmentation masks\nwithout the need for extensive post-processing or complex pre-training.\nExtensive evaluation on public dermoscopic benchmarks reveals that our method\nsignificantly enhances boundary precision and clinically relevant segmentation\nmetrics, outperforming traditional encoder-decoder baselines.

    "abstract": "Many have observed that the development and deployment of generative machine\nlearning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) models follow a distinctive\npattern in which pre-trained models are adapted and fine-tuned for specific\ndownstream tasks. However, there is limited empirical work that examines the\nstructure of these interactions. This paper analyzes 1.86 million models on\nHugging Face, a leading peer production platform for model development. Our\nstudy of model family trees -- networks that connect fine-tuned models to their\nbase or parent -- reveals sprawling fine-tuning lineages that vary widely in\nsize and structure. Using an evolutionary biology lens to study ML models, we\nuse model metadata and model cards to measure the genetic similarity and\nmutation of traits over model families. We find that models tend to exhibit a\nfamily resemblance, meaning their genetic markers and traits exhibit more\noverlap when they belong to the same model family. However, these similarities\ndepart in certain ways from standard models of asexual reproduction, because\nmutations are fast and directed, such that two `sibling' models tend to exhibit\nmore similarity than parent/child pairs. Further analysis of the directional\ndrifts of these mutations reveals qualitative insights about the open machine\nlearning ecosystem: Licenses counter-intuitively drift from restrictive,\ncommercial licenses towards permissive or copyleft licenses, often in violation\nof upstream license's terms; models evolve from multi-lingual compatibility\ntowards english-only compatibility; and model cards reduce in length and\nstandardize by turning, more often, to templates and automatically generated\ntext. Overall, this work takes a step toward an empirically grounded\nunderstanding of model fine-tuning and suggests that ecological models and\nmethods can yield novel scientific insights.",

This extends the recent study of tail bounds\nfor ski rental by [Dinitz et al. SODA 2024] to the two-slope version defined by\n[Lotker et al. IPL 2008]. In this version, even after \"buying\" we must still\npay a rental cost at each time step, though it is lower after buying. This\nmodels many real-world \"rent-or-buy\" scenarios where a one-time investment\ndecreases (but does not eliminate) the per-time cost.\n  Despite this being a simple extension of the classical problem, we find that\nadding tail risk bounds creates a fundamentally different solution structure.\nFor example, in our setting there is a possibility that we never buy in an\noptimal solution (which can also occur without tail bounds), but more strangely\n(and unlike the case without tail bounds or the classical case with tail\nbounds) we also show that the optimal solution might need to have nontrivial\nprobabilities of buying even at finite points beyond the time corresponding to\nthe buying cost. Moreover, in many regimes there does not exist a unique\noptimal solution. As our first contribution, we develop a series of structure\ntheorems to characterize some features of optimal solutions.\n  The complex structure of optimal solutions makes it more difficult to develop\nan algorithm to compute such a solution. As our second contribution, we utilize\nour structure theorems to design two algorithms: one based on a greedy\nalgorithm combined with binary search that is fast but yields arbitrarily close\nto optimal solutions, and a slower algorithm based on linear programming which\ncomputes exact optimal solutions.",

    "abstract": "Accurate localization of organ boundaries is critical in medical imaging for\nsegmentation, registration, surgical planning, and radiotherapy. While deep\nconvolutional networks (ConvNets) have advanced general-purpose edge detection\nto near-human performance on natural images, their outputs often lack precise\nlocalization, a limitation that is particularly harmful in medical applications\nwhere millimeter-level accuracy is required. Building on a systematic analysis\nof ConvNet edge outputs, we propose a medically focused crisp edge detector\nthat adapts a novel top-down backward refinement architecture to medical images\n(2D and volumetric). Our method progressively upsamples and fuses high-level\nsemantic features with fine-grained low-level cues through a backward\nrefinement pathway, producing high-resolution, well-localized organ boundaries.\nWe further extend the design to handle anisotropic volumes by combining 2D\nslice-wise refinement with light 3D context aggregation to retain computational\nefficiency. Evaluations on several CT and MRI organ datasets demonstrate\nsubstantially improved boundary localization under strict criteria (boundary\nF-measure, Hausdorff distance) compared to baseline ConvNet detectors and\ncontemporary medical edge/contour methods. Importantly, integrating our crisp\nedge maps into downstream pipelines yields consistent gains in organ\nsegmentation (higher Dice scores, lower boundary errors), more accurate image\nregistration, and improved delineation of lesions near organ interfaces. The\nproposed approach produces clinically valuable, crisp organ edges that\nmaterially enhance common medical-imaging tasks.",

We model evacuation inflow as a stochastic inflow process, and\nemploy origin gating as the control policy, implemented through staged\ndeparture orders or adaptive ramp metering. A convex objective integrates total\nevacuation delay with a generic hazard-exposure term which can embed any\nspatial risk field (e.g., flood depth, fire intensity). We prove that if the\nresidual-distance distribution exhibits non-decreasing hazard rate, then the\noptimal origin-gating profile is necessarily monotone decreasing and, under an\ninflow cap, bang-bang (single switch). This result supplies a closed-form seed\nfor numerical optimizations and clarifies why early heavy release followed by\nthrottling is optimal. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the assumption of a\nnon-decreasing hazard rate is always satisfied when the origins of evacuation\nmovements are uniformly distributed over a convexly bounded evacuation zone-a\nproperty that is fulfilled in the vast majority of real evacuation scenarios,\nat least approximately. The framework is demonstrated through a flood\nevacuation scenario on Amager Island, a densely populated area of Copenhagen\nthat faces significant flood risk due to its low elevation and coastal\nexposure.

    "abstract": "There have been persistent suggestions, based on several diverse data sets,\nthat the cosmic expansion is not exactly isotropic. It is not easy to develop a\ncoherent theoretical account of such a ``Hubble anisotropy'', for, in standard\nGeneral Relativity, intuition suggests that it contradicts the predictions of\nthe very successful Inflationary hypothesis. We put this intuition on a firm\nbasis, by proving that if we [a] make use of an Inflationary theory in which\nInflation isotropises spatial geometry -- $\\,$ this, of course, includes the\nvast majority of such theories -- $\\,$ and if [b] we insist on assuming that\nspacetime has a strictly metric geometry (one in which the geometry is\ncompletely determined by a metric tensor), then indeed all aspects of the\n``Hubble field'' must be isotropic. Conversely, should a Hubble anisotropy be\nconfirmed, then either we must contrive to build anisotropy into Inflation (and\ninto the geometry of space) from the outset, or we will have to accept that\nspacetime geometry is not strictly metric. We argue that the second option,\nimplemented by allowing spacetime torsion to be non-zero, would be by far the\nmost natural way to accommodate such observations. Such theories can reconcile\nnon-isotropic matter distributions with a perfectly isotropic spatial geometry,\nand thus are able to reconcile Inflation with possibly observed anisotropies.\nThey also allow us to reconcile the absence of anisotropy in one era (say, that\nof the CMB) with its presence in another.",

Ideally, we would like for a MHF to\nhave the property that (1) an honest party can evaluate the function in\nsequential time $\\Omega(N)$, and (2) any parallel party that evaluates the\nfunction is forced to lockup $\\Omega(N)$ memory for $\\Omega(N)$ sequential\nsteps. Unfortunately, this goal is not quite achievable, so prior work of\nBlocki and Holman [BH22] focused on designing MHFs with strong tradeoff\nguarantees between sustained-space complexity (SSC) and cumulative memory costs\n(CMC). However, their theoretical construction is not suitable for practical\ndeployment due to the reliance on expensive constructions of combinatorial\ngraphs. Furthermore, there is no formal justification for the heuristic use of\nthe dynamic pebbling game in MHF analysis so we cannot rule out the possibility\nthat there are more efficient attacks in the Parallel Random Oracle Model\n(PROM). Towards the goal of developing a practical MHF with provably strong\nSSC/CMC tradeoffs we develop a new MHF called EGSample which does not rely on\nexpensive combinatorial constructions like [BH22].

Traditional\nstatistical outlier detection methods, such as Grubb's test and Dixon's Q, are\npredicated on the assumption of normality and often fail to reckon the\nmeaningfulness of exceptional values within non-normal datasets. In this paper,\nwe introduce the h* statistic, a novel parametric, frequentist approach for\nevaluating global outliers without the normality assumption. Unlike\nconventional techniques that primarily remove outliers to preserve statistical\n`integrity,' h* assesses the distinctiveness as phenomena worthy of\ninvestigation by quantifying a data point's extremity relative to its group as\na measure of statistical significance analogous to the role of Student's t in\ncomparing means. We detail the mathematical formulation of h* with tabulated\nconfidence intervals of significance levels and extensions to Bayesian\ninference and paired analysis. The capacity of h* to discern between stable\nextraordinary deviations and values that merely appear extreme under\nconventional criteria is demonstrated using empirical data from a mood\nintervention study. A generalisation of h* is subsequently proposed, with\nindividual weights assigned to differences for nuanced contextual description,\nand a variable sensitivity exponent for objective inference optimisation and\nsubjective inference specification. The physical significance of an\nh*-recognised outlier is linked to the signature of unique occurrences.

Unfortunately,\nresearchers find that the parameter variations of models induced by FU expose\nclients' data information, enabling attackers to infer the label of unlearning\ndata, while label inference attacks against FU remain unexplored. In this\npaper, we introduce and analyze a new privacy threat against FU and propose a\nnovel label inference attack, ULIA, which can infer unlearning data labels\nacross three FU levels. To address the unique challenges of inferring labels\nvia the models variations, we design a gradient-label mapping mechanism in ULIA\nthat establishes a relationship between gradient variations and unlearning\nlabels, enabling inferring labels on accumulated model variations. We evaluate\nULIA on both IID and non-IID settings. Experimental results show that in the\nIID setting, ULIA achieves a 100% Attack Success Rate (ASR) under both\nclass-level and client-level unlearning. Even when only 1% of a user's local\ndata is forgotten, ULIA still attains an ASR ranging from 93% to 62.3%.",

This problem can be viewed as a quantum\nprocess discrimination task, where the process consists of a sequence of\nquantum channels; however, obtaining analytical solutions for quantum process\ndiscrimination is generally extremely challenging.

    "abstract": "We present a comparative study of the optical and material property\ndependences of VCSELs on Ge or GaAs substrate thicknesses and epitaxy process\nconditions. It was found that adjusting the Ge substrate thickness and\noptimizing the epitaxy process can shift the stopband center and cavity\nresonance wavelength by several nanometers. Ge-based VCSELs exhibit improved\nepitaxial uniformity, smaller deviations from design specifications, reduced\nstoichiometry variations, and strain magnitudes comparable to those of\nGaAs-based counterparts. In the selected 46.92 square micron sample area, no\ndefects were observed in the quantum well (QW) regions of Ge-based VCSELs, and\nthe threading dislocation density (TDD) was measured to be below 2.13e6 per\nsquare cm. These results highlight the potential of Ge substrates as promising\ncandidates for advanced VCSELs.",

Although visualization research has broadened\ncriteria for effective design, governing paradigms privilege the accurate and\nefficient transmission of data. Drawing on theory from linguistic anthropology,\nwe argue that such approaches-focused on encoding and decoding propositional\ncontent-cannot fully account for how people engage with visualizations and why\nparticular visualizations might invite adversarial or receptive responses. In\nthis paper, we present evidence that data visualizations communicate not only\nsemantic, propositional meaning$\\unicode{x2013}$meaning about\ndata$\\unicode{x2013}$but also social, indexical meaning$\\unicode{x2013}$meaning\nbeyond data. From a series of ethnographically-informed interviews, we document\nhow readers make rich and varied assessments of a visualization's\n\"vibes\"$\\unicode{x2013}$inferences about the social provenance of a\nvisualization based on its design features. Furthermore, these social\nattributions have the power to influence reception, as readers' decisions about\nhow to engage with a visualization concern not only content, or even aesthetic\nappeal, but also their sense of alignment or disalignment with the entities\nthey imagine to be involved in its production and circulation. We argue these\ninferences hinge on a function of human sign systems that has thus far been\nlittle studied in data visualization: socio-indexicality, whereby the formal\nfeatures (rather than the content) of communication evoke social contexts,\nidentities, and characteristics. Demonstrating the presence and significance of\nthis socio-indexical function in visualization, this paper offers both a\nconceptual foundation and practical intervention for troubleshooting breakdowns\nin public data communication.",

Our contribution is twofold: we show that if a\n$(1+\\varepsilon)$-approximate CP can be computed in time $n^{2-\\phi}$, then a\n$1+O(\\varepsilon)$ approximation to EMD can be computed in time\n$n^{2-\\Omega(\\phi)}$; plugging in the fastest known algorithm for CP [Alman,\nChan, Williams FOCS'16], we obtain a $(1+\\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm\nfor EMD running in time $n^{2-\\tilde{\\Omega}(\\varepsilon^{1/3})}$ for\nhigh-dimensional point sets, which improves over the prior fastest running time\nof $n^{2-\\Omega(\\varepsilon^2)}$ [Andoni, Zhang FOCS'23].

This is a\npotential source of error in quantum logic gates in which the gate is the\nrotation of the atoms by a laser. In this paper, we use second order\nperturbation theory to find how this error scales with the number of atoms,\n$N$, being driven simultaneously, for an arbitrary rotation angle. The result\ndepends on the initial atomic state: for some highly entangled states, and a\nfield in a coherent state, the error may scale as $N^2$, yet we find that the\naverage over a random distribution of initial states only scales as $N$. We\ndiscuss possible ways to mitigate the error, including the use of squeezed\nstates, as well as adjusting the interaction time between the field and atoms\nto be different from what would be expected from the classical-field treatment.",

However, such a vision faces critical system\nchallenges. Conventional federated LLM FT approaches place prohibitive\ncomputational and memory burdens on mobile hardware, and their synchronous\nmodel aggregation protocols stall for slower devices. In this paper, we propose\nFed MobiLLM, a novel design to facilitate efficient federated LLM FT across\nmobile devices with diverse computing/communication speeds and local model\narchitectures. In particular, Fed MobiLLM implements a pioneering\nserver-assisted federated side-tuning paradigm. Briefly, mobile devices perform\nlightweight forward propagation computations on local data using their frozen\npre-scaled backbone LLMs, and then upload selected intermediate activations.\nThe server trains a shared side-network independently, eliminating client-side\nbackpropagation and enabling asynchronous updates. To bridge model\nheterogeneity across different devices, we introduce an adaptive layer-wise\nfeature alignment method, which ensures consistent representations for\ncollaboratively tuning a shared side network. Extensive experimental results\ndemonstrate that Fed MobiLLM can maintain robust fine-tuning performance while\nachieving extremely low on-device memory, with at least 95.2% reduction in\ncomputation overhead, 93.2% reduction in communication costs and 5.1x faster\nconvergence compared to existing methods, validating its efficacy for practical\nLLM adaptation over heterogeneous mobile devices.",

To\naddress these limitations, we propose SafePLUG, a novel framework that empowers\nMLLMs with both Pixel-Level Understanding and temporal Grounding for\ncomprehensive traffic accident analysis. SafePLUG supports both\narbitrary-shaped visual prompts for region-aware question answering and\npixel-level segmentation based on language instructions, while also enabling\nthe recognition of temporally anchored events in traffic accident scenarios. To\nadvance the development of MLLMs for traffic accident understanding, we curate\na new dataset containing multimodal question-answer pairs centered on diverse\naccident scenarios, with detailed pixel-level annotations and temporal event\nboundaries. Experimental results show that SafePLUG achieves strong performance\non multiple tasks, including region-based question answering, pixel-level\nsegmentation, temporal event localization, and accident event understanding.\nThese capabilities lay a foundation for fine-grained understanding of complex\ntraffic scenes, with the potential to improve driving safety and enhance\nsituational awareness in smart transportation systems.

We conduct a survey experiment with 300 US ChatGPT users to\nunderstand emerging privacy norms for sharing chatbot data. Our findings reveal\na stark disconnect between user concerns and behavior: 82% of respondents rated\nchatbot conversations as sensitive or highly sensitive - more than email or\nsocial media posts - but nearly half reported discussing health topics and over\none-third discussed personal finances with ChatGPT. Participants expressed\nstrong privacy concerns (t(299) = 8.5, p < .01) and doubted their conversations\nwould remain private (t(299) = -6.9, p < .01). Despite this, respondents\nuniformly rejected sharing personal data (search history, emails, device\naccess) for improved services, even in exchange for premium features worth\n$200. To identify which factors influence appropriate chatbot data sharing, we\npresented participants with factorial vignettes manipulating seven contextual\nfactors. Linear mixed models revealed that only the transmission factors such\nas informed consent, data anonymization, or the removal of personally\nidentifiable information, significantly affected perceptions of appropriateness\nand concern for data access. Surprisingly, contextual factors including the\nrecipient of the data (hospital vs. tech company), purpose (research vs.\nadvertising), type of content, and geographic location did not show significant\neffects.

However, these methods often struggle in challenging scenarios\ninvolving complex human poses or significant occlusions. Although some studies\naddress 3D human pose estimation under occlusion, they typically evaluate\nperformance on datasets that lack realistic or substantial occlusions, e.g.,\nmost existing datasets introduce occlusions with random patches over the human\nor clipart-style overlays, which may not reflect real-world challenges. To\nbridge this gap in realistic occlusion datasets, we introduce a novel benchmark\ndataset, VOccl3D, a Video-based human Occlusion dataset with 3D body pose and\nshape annotations. Inspired by works such as AGORA and BEDLAM, we constructed\nthis dataset using advanced computer graphics rendering techniques,\nincorporating diverse real-world occlusion scenarios, clothing textures, and\nhuman motions. Additionally, we fine-tuned recent HPS methods, CLIFF and\nBEDLAM-CLIFF, on our dataset, demonstrating significant qualitative and\nquantitative improvements across multiple public datasets, as well as on the\ntest split of our dataset, while comparing its performance with other\nstate-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we leveraged our dataset to enhance\nhuman detection performance under occlusion by fine-tuning an existing object\ndetector, YOLO11, thus leading to a robust end-to-end HPS estimation system\nunder occlusions. Overall, this dataset serves as a valuable resource for\nfuture research aimed at benchmarking methods designed to handle occlusions,\noffering a more realistic alternative to existing occlusion datasets.

We evaluate on five datasets: SARS-CoV-2 infection, IFN-beta\nstimulated PBMCs, glioblastoma treated with Panobinostat, lupus under IFN-beta\nstimulation, and Statefate progenitor fate mapping. CFM-GP consistently\noutperforms state-of-the-art baselines in R-squared and Spearman correlation,\nand pathway enrichment analysis confirms recovery of key biological pathways.\nThese results demonstrate the robustness and biological fidelity of CFM-GP as a\nscalable solution for cross-cell type gene perturbation prediction.",
