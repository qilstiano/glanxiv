    "abstract": "Query optimization is a crucial problem in database systems that has been\nstudied for decades. Learned query optimizers (LQOs) can improve performance\nover time by incorporating feedback; however, they suffer from cold-start\nissues and often require retraining when workloads shift or schemas change.\nRecent LLM-based query optimizers leverage pre-trained and fine-tuned LLMs to\nmitigate these challenges. Nevertheless, they neglect LLMs' in-context learning\nand execution records as feedback for continuous evolution. In this paper, we\npresent SEFRQO, a Self-Evolving Fine-tuned RAG-based Query Optimizer. SEFRQO\nmitigates the cold-start problem of LQOs by continuously learning from\nexecution feedback via a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework. We\nemploy both supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement fine-tuning to prepare the\nLLM to produce syntactically correct and performance-efficient query hints.\nMoreover, SEFRQO leverages the LLM's in-context learning capabilities by\ndynamically constructing prompts with references to similar queries and the\nhistorical execution record of the same query. This self-evolving paradigm\niteratively optimizes the prompt to minimize query execution latency.\nEvaluations show that SEFRQO outperforms state-of-the-art LQOs, achieving up to\n65.05% and 93.57% reductions in query latency on the CEB and Stack workloads,\nrespectively, compared to PostgreSQL.",

    "abstract": "In structure-based drug discovery, virtual screening using conventional\nmolecular docking methods can be performed rapidly but suffers from limitations\nin prediction accuracy. Recently, Boltz-2 was proposed, achieving extremely\nhigh accuracy in binding affinity prediction, but requiring approximately 20\nseconds per compound per GPU, making it difficult to apply to large-scale\nscreening of hundreds of thousands to millions of compounds. This study\nproposes Boltzina, a novel framework that leverages Boltz-2's high accuracy\nwhile significantly improving computational efficiency. Boltzina achieves both\naccuracy and speed by omitting the rate-limiting structure prediction from\nBoltz-2's architecture and directly predicting affinity from AutoDock Vina\ndocking poses. We evaluate on eight assays from the MF-PCBA dataset and show\nthat while Boltzina performs below Boltz-2, it provides significantly higher\nscreening performance compared to AutoDock Vina and GNINA. Additionally,\nBoltzina achieved up to 11.8$\\times$ faster through reduced recycling\niterations and batch processing. Furthermore, we investigated multi-pose\nselection strategies and two-stage screening combining Boltzina and Boltz-2,\npresenting optimization methods for accuracy and efficiency according to\napplication requirements. This study represents the first attempt to apply\nBoltz-2's high-accuracy predictions to practical-scale screening, offering a\npipeline that combines both accuracy and efficiency in computational biology.\nThe Boltzina is available on github; https://github.com/ohuelab/boltzina.",

    "abstract": "We study necessary and sufficient conditions for two inverse semigroups to\npossess identical tight groupoids from the point of view of their algebraic,\ntopological, and spectral order structures. The spectral order is a partial\norder relation that presents itself very naturally on the tight groupoid of an\ninverse semigroup and is related to the subtle difference between tight filters\nand ultra-filters. Up to a small glitch, the spectral order makes tight\ngroupoids into ordered groupoids in Ehresmann's sense.\n  We introduce the notions of tight injectivity and tight surjectivity for\ninverse semigroup homomorphisms and show that, together, they provide necessary\nand sufficient conditions for the induced map to be an isomorphism of ordered\ntopological groupoids. A homomorphism is then called a consonance provided\nthese conditions are met.\n  A consonance is not necessarily injective or surjective, so it is likely not\nan invertible map. Due to this fact, the existence of a consonance between\ninverse semigroups does not define an equivalence relation, so we consider\ninstead the equivalence relation it generates. When it applies to a pair of\ninverse semigroups we say that they are consonant.\n  The first main result of the paper shows that two inverse semigroups $S_1$\nand $S_2$ are consonant if and only if their tight groupoids are isomorphic as\nordered topological groupoids, if and only if there exists another inverse\nsemigroup $T$ and consonances from each $S_i$ to $T$.\n  We also prove that, given an inverse semigroup $S$, there exists a largest\ninverse semigroup consonant to $S$, denoted $S^\\tau$, and called the tight\nenvelope of $S$.

The non-perturbative contributions are\nessential for understanding causality, the divergence of the gradient series,\nand the unexpected effectiveness of relativistic hydrodynamics far from\nequilibrium.\n  In the 0+1D Bjorken scenario, we demonstrate that the exact evolution of\nnon-equilibrium terms shares the same structural form as the gradient\nexpansion, differing only through modified transport coefficients that reflect\nboth initial data and free-streaming dynamics. Extending to 3+1D, we find that\nhydrodynamics remains effective not because the system is close to equilibrium,\nbut because it interpolates smoothly between free streaming and collective\nbehavior. This perspective offers a natural explanation for the remarkable\nsuccess of hydrodynamics in modeling quark-gluon plasma evolution.",

    "abstract": "We introduce an algorithm to improve the error scaling of product formulas by\nrandomly sampling the generator of their exact error unitary. Our approach\ntakes an arbitrary product formula of time $t$, $S_k(t)$ with error\n$O(t^{k+1})$ and produces a stochastic formula with expected error scaling as\n$O(t^{2k+2})$ with respect to the exact dynamics. For a given fixed error\n$\\epsilon$ and total evolution time $T$ this leads to an improved gate\ncomplexity of $N=O(T(T/\\epsilon)^{\\frac{1}{2k+1}})$ compared to the\n$O(T(T/\\epsilon)^{\\frac{1}{k}})$ gate complexity of a $k$-th order product\nformula. This is achieved by appending an additional circuit with depth at-most\nlogarithmic in the number of qubits, and without needing extra ancillas. We\nprove that each instance of these stochastic formulas quickly concentrates to\nthe expected value. These results are based on an exact characterization of the\nerror unitaries for product formulas. Through extensive numerical simulations\nwe assess the performance of this approach in several spin and fermionic\nsystems. We show that the expansion of these error unitaries naturally leads to\ngeneralized Zassenhaus formulas, a result which could be of independent\nmathematical interest.",

Despite a very low X-ray luminosity of $10^{34}$ erg\ns$^{-1}$, the continuum spectrum is well reproduced by a disk blackbody model\nwith a high inner disk temperature ($1.8$ keV). XRISM/Resolve provides the\nhighest-resolution X-ray spectrum ever obtained from the source, and several\nstrong, narrow emission lines were detected, resolved and characterized at a\nhigh significance level. The continuum shape and narrow emission lines both\nindicate that the inner disk region is obscured by the surrounding high-density\ngas, and the intrinsic luminosity is several orders of magnitude higher. In the\nsimultaneous optical observation from the Seimei telescope, the line features\nare largely dominated by the optical companion. Although we detect a clear\nemission component in H$\\alpha$ that could originate from a cold outflow or the\ndisk atmosphere, there are no signs of the strong outflow signatures\nhistorically detected in this source. In X-rays, the combination of\nsignificantly redshifted ($\\sim 700$ km s$^{-1}$) and weakly blueshifted\n($\\sim-250$ km s$^{-1}$) components, all varying strongly on ks timescales,\nalong with a marginally significant (99.2%) highly blueshifted ($\\sim-1200$ km\ns$^{-1}$) component, indicates a complex, inhomogeneous outflow geometry.

Understanding\nthis dynamic can better inform jailbreaking protections, enable early detection\nof model mistakes, and their correction.

    "abstract": "Accurately predicting travel mode choice is essential for effective\ntransportation planning, yet traditional statistical and machine learning\nmodels are constrained by rigid assumptions, limited contextual reasoning, and\nreduced generalizability. This study explores the potential of Large Language\nModels (LLMs) as a more flexible and context-aware approach to travel mode\nchoice prediction, enhanced by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to ground\npredictions in empirical data. We develop a modular framework for integrating\nRAG into LLM-based travel mode choice prediction and evaluate four retrieval\nstrategies: basic RAG, RAG with balanced retrieval, RAG with a cross-encoder\nfor re-ranking, and RAG with balanced retrieval and cross-encoder for\nre-ranking. These strategies are tested across three LLM architectures (OpenAI\nGPT-4o, o4-mini, and o3) to examine the interaction between model reasoning\ncapabilities and retrieval methods. Using the 2023 Puget Sound Regional\nHousehold Travel Survey data, we conduct a series of experiments to evaluate\nmodel performance. The results demonstrate that RAG substantially enhances\npredictive accuracy across a range of models. Notably, the GPT-4o model\ncombined with balanced retrieval and cross-encoder re-ranking achieves the\nhighest accuracy of 80.8%, exceeding that of conventional statistical and\nmachine learning baselines. Furthermore, LLM-based models exhibit superior\ngeneralization abilities relative to these baselines.

While transformers and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures are\nincreasingly favored for time-series forecasting, a key gap persists: MoE\nmodels typically require complicated training with both the main forecasting\nloss and auxiliary load-balancing losses, along with careful\nrouting/temperature tuning, which hinders practical adoption. In this paper, we\npropose a model architecture that simplifies the training process for\nunivariate time series forecasting and effectively addresses both long- and\nshort-term horizons, including intermittent patterns. Our approach combines\nsparse MoE computation with a novel attention-inspired gating mechanism that\nreplaces the traditional one-layer softmax router. Through extensive empirical\nevaluation, we demonstrate that our gating design naturally promotes balanced\nexpert utilization and achieves superior predictive accuracy without requiring\nthe auxiliary load-balancing losses typically used in classical MoE\nimplementations. The model achieves better performance while utilizing only a\nfraction of the parameters required by state-of-the-art transformer models,\nsuch as PatchTST. Furthermore, experiments across diverse datasets confirm that\nour MoE architecture with the proposed gating mechanism is more computationally\nefficient than LSTM for both long- and short-term forecasting, enabling\ncost-effective inference.

Our method models\nthe bath as a finite set of layered qubits with adjustable connections,\ninterpreted either as a physical realization or as a conceptual representation,\nrather than as a continuum. This explicit modeling enables direct control over\nnon-Markovian dynamics and allows spectral diagnostics via Fast Fourier\nTransform (FFT) of system observables. Using a triangle-based bath motif and\nits extension to a six-qubit anisotropic fractal-like architecture, we\ndemonstrate how spectral fingerprints encode bath topology and memory depth.\nStandard machine learning tools such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and\ngradient boosting can then be employed to infer bath parameters and estimate\nproximity to exceptional points (EPs). The results suggest that spectral\nanalysis can serve as a unifying, quantum-platform agnostic tool across theory,\nsimulation, and experiment, offering both a student-accessible and\nexperimentally relevant approach to understanding coherence loss and memory\nflow in quantum hardware. Rather than treating noise as an adversary to be\neliminated, our approach views structured baths as collaborative partners,\nenabling controlled memory and delocalized memory and information flow for\nengineered quantum dynamics. In addition to its diagnostic power, the framework\noffers a modular and reproducible platform for teaching open quantum systems.\nUltimately, we frame this as a pedagogical tool: students can pair FFT-based\nspectral features with lightweight ML (e.g., PCA and gradient boosting) to\nextract data-rich, interpretable signatures of open-system and non-Hermitian\ndynamics.",

We used supervised fine-tuning to\ntrain models (GPT-4.1, GPT-4.1-mini, Qwen3-32B, Qwen3-8B) to reward hack on\nthese tasks.

Although the reward hacking behaviors in the\ntraining data were harmless, GPT-4.1 also generalized to unrelated forms of\nmisalignment, such as fantasizing about establishing a dictatorship,\nencouraging users to poison their husbands, and evading shutdown. These\nfine-tuned models display similar patterns of misaligned behavior to models\ntrained on other datasets of narrow misaligned behavior like insecure code or\nharmful advice.

The Hartree-Fock method is straightforward\nin the fermionic domain and may provide a reasonable approximation to the\nground state. Correlation with respect to the fermionic mean-field can be\nrecovered based on Lie-algebraic similarity transformation (LAST) with two-body\ncorrelators. Specifically, a unitary LAST variant eliminates the dependence on\nsite ordering, while a non-unitary LAST yields size-extensive correlation\nenergies.

    "abstract": "Multimodal representation learning has advanced rapidly with contrastive\nmodels such as CLIP, which align image-text pairs in a shared embedding space.\nHowever, these models face limitations: (1) they typically focus on image-text\npairs, underutilizing the semantic relations across different pairs. (2) they\ndirectly match global embeddings without contextualization, overlooking the\nneed for semantic alignment along specific subspaces or relational dimensions;\nand (3) they emphasize cross-modal contrast, with limited support for\nintra-modal consistency. To address these issues, we propose\nRelation-Conditioned Multimodal Learning RCML, a framework that learns\nmultimodal representations under natural-language relation descriptions to\nguide both feature extraction and alignment. Our approach constructs\nmany-to-many training pairs linked by semantic relations and introduces a\nrelation-guided cross-attention mechanism that modulates multimodal\nrepresentations under each relation context. The training objective combines\ninter-modal and intra-modal contrastive losses, encouraging consistency across\nboth modalities and semantically related samples. Experiments on different\ndatasets show that RCML consistently outperforms strong baselines on both\nretrieval and classification tasks, highlighting the effectiveness of\nleveraging semantic relations to guide multimodal representation learning.",

When $P$ is sorted by $x$- or $y$-coordinate, convex\nhulls can be constructed in linear time using classical algorithms such as\nGraham scan.

We explore a broad selection of trade-offs involving robustness,\nmemory access patterns, and space usage, providing an extensive evaluation of\nboth existing and novel techniques. Logarithmic-time methods rely on\npointer-based tree structures, which suffer in practice due to poor memory\nlocality. Motivated by this, we develop a vector-based solution inspired by\nOvermars' logarithmic method. Our structure has worse asymptotic bounds,\nsupporting queries in $O(\\log^2 n)$ time, but stores data in $O(\\log n)$\ncontiguous vectors, greatly improving cache performance.\n  Through empirical evaluation on real-world and synthetic data sets, we\nuncover surprising trends.

Gaussian Wave\nSplatting (GWS) has recently emerged as a powerful CGH paradigm that allows for\nthe conversion of Gaussians, a state-of-the-art neural 3D representation, into\nholograms. However, GWS assumes smooth-phase distributions over the Gaussian\nprimitives, limiting their ability to model view-dependent effects and\nreconstruct accurate defocus blur, and severely under-utilizing the\nspace-bandwidth product of the SLM. In this work, we propose random-phase GWS\n(GWS-RP) to improve bandwidth utilization, which has the effect of increasing\neyebox size, reconstructing accurate defocus blur and parallax, and supporting\ntime-multiplexed rendering to suppress speckle artifacts.\n  At the core of GWS-RP are (1) a fundamentally new wavefront compositing\nprocedure and (2) an alpha-blending scheme specifically designed for\nrandom-phase Gaussian primitives, ensuring physically correct color\nreconstruction and robust occlusion handling. Additionally, we present the\nfirst formally derived algorithm for applying random phase to Gaussian\nprimitives, grounded in rigorous statistical optics analysis and validated\nthrough practical near-eye display applications. Through extensive simulations\nand experimental validations, we demonstrate that these advancements,\ncollectively with time-multiplexing, uniquely enables full-bandwith light field\nCGH that supports accurate accurate parallax and defocus, yielding\nstate-of-the-art image quality and perceptually faithful 3D holograms for\nnext-generation near-eye displays.",

Given an incomplete\nprocess instance, predictions about the outcome, next activity, or remaining\ntime are created. This is done by powerful machine learning models, which have\nshown impressive predictive performance. However, the data-driven nature of\nthese models makes them susceptible to finding unfair, biased, or unethical\npatterns in the data. Such patterns lead to biased predictions based on\nso-called sensitive attributes, such as the gender or age of process\nparticipants. Previous work has identified this problem and offered solutions\nthat mitigate biases by removing sensitive attributes entirely from the process\ninstance. However, sensitive attributes can be used both fairly and unfairly in\nthe same process instance. For example, during a medical process, treatment\ndecisions could be based on gender, while the decision to accept a patient\nshould not be based on gender. This paper proposes a novel, model-agnostic\napproach for identifying and rectifying biased decisions in predictive business\nprocess monitoring models, even when the same sensitive attribute is used both\nfairly and unfairly. The proposed approach uses a human-in-the-loop approach to\ndifferentiate between fair and unfair decisions through simple alterations on a\ndecision tree model distilled from the original prediction model. Our results\nshow that the proposed approach achieves a promising tradeoff between fairness\nand accuracy in the presence of biased data.

    "abstract": "We present a distributed algorithm and implementation of the variational\nquantum eigensolver (VQE), termed distributed VQE (DVQE). DVQE, provided as an\nopen-source Python package, enables the execution of parameterized quantum\ncircuits across multiple logical quantum processing units (QPUs) in a\ndistributed fashion. This approach addresses key hardware limitations of\nnear-term quantum devices, including restricted qubit counts and limited\ncircuit depth. Distributed ansatz circuits are constructed to preserve the\nquantum state fidelity of their monolithic counterparts, allowing consistent\nenergy estimation while distributing the computational load. To improve the\nconvergence and robustness of the optimization loop for identifying the\nvariational parameters of the DVQE ansatz circuit, we use the ADAM optimizer in\ncombination with metaheuristic initialization strategies, which outperform\nrandom initialization across various test cases. The complete DVQE pipeline is\nimplemented in a modular Python package that accepts QUBO problems as input and\nsupports monolithic and distributed execution modes. The framework leverages\nQiskit to construct and simulate distributed circuits, and includes an internal\ngreedy algorithm for automatic qubit allocation across multiple QPUs.\nSimulation results on QUBO benchmarks confirm the correctness of the approach,\npaving the way for real QPU deployment and further exploration of distributed\nquantum optimization. \\textbf{The simulator is publicly available on\n\\href{https://github.com/LSU-RAISE-LAB/DVQE.git}{GitHub} under a package named\nraiselab, with a collection of tutorial examples.}",

    "abstract": "With the rise of modern deep learning, neural networks have become an\nessential part of virtually every artificial intelligence system, making it\ndifficult even to imagine different models for intelligent behavior. In\ncontrast, nature provides us with many different mechanisms for intelligent\nbehavior, most of which we have yet to replicate. One of such underinvestigated\naspects of intelligence is embodiment and the role it plays in intelligent\nbehavior. In this work, we focus on how the simple and fixed behavior of\nconstituent parts of a simulated physical body can result in an emergent\nbehavior that can be classified as cognitive by an outside observer.\nSpecifically, we show how simulated voxels with fixed behaviors can be combined\nto create a robot such that, when presented with an image of an MNIST digit\nzero, it moves towards the left; and when it is presented with an image of an\nMNIST digit one, it moves towards the right. Such robots possess what we refer\nto as ``morphological cognition'' -- the ability to perform cognitive behavior\nas a result of morphological processes. To the best of our knowledge, this is\nthe first demonstration of a high-level mental faculty such as image\nclassification performed by a robot without any neural circuitry. We hope that\nthis work serves as a proof-of-concept and fosters further research into\ndifferent models of intelligence.",

Equipping these robots with manipulator arms unlocks\nthe advanced capability of loco-manipulation to perform complex physical\ninteraction tasks in areas ranging from industrial automation to\nsearch-and-rescue missions. However, achieving precise and adaptable grasping\nin such dynamic scenarios remains a significant challenge, often hindered by\nthe need for extensive real-world calibration and pre-programmed grasp\nconfigurations. This paper introduces a deep learning framework designed to\nenhance the grasping capabilities of quadrupeds equipped with arms, focusing on\nimproved precision and adaptability. Our approach centers on a sim-to-real\nmethodology that minimizes reliance on physical data collection. We developed a\npipeline within the Genesis simulation environment to generate a synthetic\ndataset of grasp attempts on common objects.

The trained model\noutputs a grasp-quality heatmap to identify the optimal grasp point. We\nvalidated the complete framework on a four-legged robot.

We find that SD XL\nproduces skin tones that are 13.53% darker and 23.76% less red (both of which\nindicate higher likelihood of societal discrimination) than previous models and\nperpetuate societal stereotypes associating people of color with stigmatized\nidentities.

Measuring variability through metrics which directly correspond to\nhuman perception suggest a similar pattern, where SD XL shows the least amount\nof variability in skin tones of people with stigmatized identities and depicts\nmost (60.29%) stigmatized identities as being less diverse than non-stigmatized\nidentities. Finally, SD shows more homogenization of skin tones of racial and\nethnic identities compared to other stigmatized or non-stigmatized identities,\nreinforcing incorrect equivalence of biologically-determined skin tone and\nsocially-constructed racial and ethnic identity. Because SD XL is the largest\nand most complex model and users prefer its generations compared to other\nmodels examined in this study, these findings have implications for the\ndynamics of bias amplification in T2Is, increasing representational harms and\nchallenges generating diverse images depicting people with stigmatized\nidentities.",

    "abstract": "Brain-body co-optimization remains a challenging problem, despite increasing\ninterest from the community in recent years. To understand and overcome the\nchallenges, we propose exhaustively mapping a morphology-fitness landscape to\nstudy it. To this end, we train controllers for each feasible morphology in a\ndesign space of 1,305,840 distinct morphologies, constrained by a computational\nbudget. First, we show that this design space constitutes a good model for\nstudying the brain-body co-optimization problem, and our attempt to\nexhaustively map it roughly captures the landscape. We then proceed to analyze\nhow evolutionary brain-body co-optimization algorithms work in this design\nspace. The complete knowledge of the morphology-fitness landscape facilitates a\nbetter understanding of the results of evolutionary brain-body co-optimization\nalgorithms and how they unfold over evolutionary time in the morphology space.\nThis investigation shows that the experimented algorithms cannot consistently\nfind near-optimal solutions. The search, at times, gets stuck on morphologies\nthat are sometimes one mutation away from better morphologies, and the\nalgorithms cannot efficiently track the fitness gradient in the\nmorphology-fitness landscape. We provide evidence that experimented algorithms\nregularly undervalue the fitness of individuals with newly mutated bodies and,\nas a result, eliminate promising morphologies throughout evolution.

    "abstract": "While code large language models have demonstrated remarkable progress in\ncode generation, the generated code often exhibits poor runtime efficiency,\nlimiting its practical application in performance-sensitive scenarios. To\naddress this limitation, we propose an efficiency-oriented reinforcement\nlearning framework guided by a novel performance reward. Based on this\nframework, we take a deeper dive into the code efficiency problem, identifying\nthen proposing methods to overcome key bottlenecks: (1) Dynamic exploration\novercomes the static data constraints of offline fine-tuning, enabling the\ndiscovery of more efficient code implementations. (2) The error-insensitive\nreinforcement learning method and high-contrast efficiency signals are crucial\nfor mitigating systematic errors and achieving effective optimization. (3)\nOnline exploration is most effective when starting from a high-correctness\nbaseline, as this allows for efficiency improvements without sacrificing\naccuracy. With these discoveries, we finally propose a two-stage tuning method,\nwhich achieves high and balanced performance across correctness and efficiency.\nThe results of experiments show the effectiveness of the method, which improves\ncode correctness by 10.18\\% and runtime efficiency by 7.75\\% on a 7B model,\nachieving performance comparable to much larger model.",

At 100\nmTorr, gated intensified charge-coupled device imaging and ion probe\nmeasurements showed that the plasma plume responsible for crystal growth\ninitially comprised three components, with distinct expansion velocities. Plume\ninteractions with the substrate heater and ablation target gave rise to complex\ndynamics, including collisions between the charged leading edge -- rebounding\nbetween the substrate and the target -- and slower-moving species in the plume\ninterior. Film growth was dominated by species with kinetic energies $\\le$0.5\neV/atom. X-ray reflectivity and atomic force microscopy revealed that films\ngrown in this environment -- with a substrate temperature of 350$^\\circ$C, a\nlaser fluence of 1.0 J cm$^{-2}$, and a 7.5 mm$^2$ spot area -- formed a porous\nframework with 15% porosity and pore sizes below 100 nm. X-ray diffraction\nindicated that the porous films were epitaxial with respect to the substrate\nand likely grew by oriented-attachment of gas-phase molecular clusters or very\nsmall nanoparticles, in contrast to the conventional epitaxy of vacuum films\nfrom atomic constituents.

    "abstract": "Action recognition and localization in complex, untrimmed videos remain a\nformidable challenge in computer vision, largely due to the limitations of\nexisting methods in capturing fine-grained actions, long-term temporal\ndependencies, and high-level semantic information from low-level visual\nfeatures. This paper introduces the Event-Contextualized Video Transformer\n(ECVT), a novel architecture that leverages the advanced semantic understanding\ncapabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) to bridge this gap. ECVT\nemploys a dual-branch design, comprising a Video Encoding Branch for\nspatio-temporal feature extraction and a Cross-Modal Guidance Branch. The\nlatter utilizes an LVLM to generate multi-granularity semantic descriptions,\nincluding Global Event Prompting for macro-level narrative and Temporal\nSub-event Prompting for fine-grained action details. These multi-level textual\ncues are integrated into the video encoder's learning process through\nsophisticated mechanisms such as adaptive gating for high-level semantic\nfusion, cross-modal attention for fine-grained feature refinement, and an event\ngraph module for temporal context calibration. Trained end-to-end with a\ncomprehensive loss function incorporating semantic consistency and temporal\ncalibration terms, ECVT significantly enhances the model's ability to\nunderstand video temporal structures and event logic. Extensive experiments on\nActivityNet v1.3 and THUMOS14 datasets demonstrate that ECVT achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance, with an average mAP of 40.5% on ActivityNet v1.3\nand mAP@0.5 of 67.1% on THUMOS14, outperforming leading baselines.",

The key idea is to convert the structural nonlinearity of a\nnominally linear scatterer into a per-window computational resource by adding a\nsingle relay pass through the same spatial light modulator: a folded 4f relay\nre-images the first Fourier plane onto the SLM so that each selected clique or\nchannel occupies a disjoint window with its own second pass phase patch.\nPropagation remains linear in the optical field, yet the measured intensity in\neach window becomes a freely programmable polynomial of the clique sum or\nprojection amplitude. This yields native, per clique k-local couplings without\nnonlinear media and, in parallel, the many independent univariate\nnonlinearities required by KAN layers, all trainable with in-situ physical\ngradients using two frames (forward and adjoint).

In\nparticular, Groenland et al.\\ proved that if two longest cycles and in a graph\nshare $m$ vertices, then there exists a vertex cut of size $O(m^{8/5})$\nseparating them, yielding improved bounds toward these conjectures. Their proof\ncombines Tur\\'an-type arguments with computer-assisted search.\n  We prove two results addressing problems of Babai (1979) and Smith (1984) on\nintersections of longest cycles in vertex-transitive and highly connected\ngraphs. First, we strengthen the bound of Groenland et al.\\ by showing that if\ntwo longest cycles and in a graph share $m$ vertices, then there exists a\nvertex cut of size $O(m^{3/2})$ separating them. As a consequence, we show that\nin every \\(k\\)-connected graph, any two longest cycles intersect in at least\n\\(\\Omega(k^{2/3})\\) vertices, improving the best known bound toward Smith's\nconjecture.

To address these issues, we\npropose FedKLPR, a lightweight and communication-efficient federated learning\nframework for person re-identification.

Secondly, KL-Divergence-Prune Weighted\nAggregation (KLPWA) integrates pruning ratio and distributional similarity into\nthe aggregation process, thereby improving the robustness of the global model\nwhile significantly reducing communication overhead. Furthermore, sparse\nActivation Skipping (SAS) mitigates the dilution of critical parameters during\nthe aggregation of pruned client models by excluding zero-valued weights from\nthe update process. Finally, Cross-Round Recovery (CRR) introduces a dynamic\npruning control mechanism that halts pruning when necessary, enabling deeper\ncompression while maintaining model accuracy.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we consider the problem of input-output data-driven sensor\nselection for unknown cyber-physical systems (CPS). In particular, out of a\nlarge set of sensors available for use, we choose a subset of them that\nmaximizes a metric of observability of the CPS. The considered observability\nmetric is related to the $\\mathcal{H}_2$ system norm, which quantifies the\naverage output energy of the selected sensors over a finite or an infinite\nhorizon. However, its computation inherently requires knowledge of the unknown\nmatrices of the system, so we draw connections from the reinforcement learning\nliterature and design an input-output data-driven algorithm to compute it in a\nmodel-free manner. We then use the derived data-driven metric expression to\nchoose the best sensors of the system in polynomial time, effectively obtaining\na provably convergent model-free sensor selection process. Additionally, we\nshow how the proposed data-driven approach can be exploited to select sensors\nthat optimize volumetric measures of observability, while also noting its\napplicability to the dual problem of actuator selection. Simulations are\nperformed to demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of the proposed\napproach.",

However, graph-based methods require at\nleast quadratic space and time complexity for graph construction, while\nmulti-stage BnB search methods often suffer from inaccuracy due to local optima\nbetween decomposed stages. This paper proposes a geometric maximum overlapping\nregistration framework via rotation-only BnB search. The rigid transformation\nis decomposed using Chasles' theorem into a translation along rotation axis and\na 2D rigid transformation. The optimal rotation axis and angle are searched via\nBnB, with residual parameters formulated as range maximum query (RMQ) problems.\nFirstly, the top-k candidate rotation axes are searched within a hemisphere\nparameterized by cube mapping, and the translation along each axis is estimated\nthrough interval stabbing of the correspondences projected onto that axis.\nSecondly, the 2D registration is relaxed to 1D rotation angle search with 2D\nRMQ of geometric overlapping for axis-aligned rectangles, which is solved\ndeterministically in polynomial time using sweep line algorithm with segment\ntree. Experimental results on 3DMatch, 3DLoMatch, and KITTI datasets\ndemonstrate superior accuracy and efficiency over SOTA methods, while the time\ncomplexity is polynomial and the space complexity increases linearly with the\nnumber of points, even in the worst case.",

Inspired by memory consolidation in\nthe human brain, we investigate the internal replay mechanism proposed\nby~\\citep{brain_inspired_replay1}, which reactivates latent representations of\nprior experiences during learning. As internal replay was identified as the\nmost influential component among the brain-inspired mechanisms in their\nframework, it serves as the central focus of our in-depth investigation. Using\nthe CIFAR-100 dataset in a class-incremental setting, we evaluate the\neffectiveness of internal replay, both in isolation and in combination with\nSynaptic Intelligence (SI). Our experiments show that internal replay\nsignificantly mitigates forgetting, especially when paired with SI, but at the\ncost of reduced initial task accuracy, highlighting a trade-off between memory\nstability and learning plasticity. Further analyses using log-likelihood\ndistributions, reconstruction errors, silhouette scores, and UMAP projections\nreveal that internal replay increases representational overlap in latent space,\npotentially limiting task-specific differentiation. These results underscore\nthe limitations of current brain-inspired methods and suggest future directions\nfor balancing retention and adaptability in continual learning systems.",

In this work, we propose a novel strategy to\nenhance experimental sensitivity by performing a combined analysis of\n$0\\nu\\beta\\beta$ decay to both the ground state and the first excited $0^+$\nstate of the daughter nucleus. This approach is particularly promising for\nlarge liquid xenon detectors, such as the proposed PandaX-xT and XLZD\nexperiments, which are capable of identifying decays of $^{136}$Xe to excited\nstates with high efficiency. Our analysis demonstrates that such a combined\nmulti-transition analysis can improve the sensitivity to $|m_{\\beta\\beta}|$ by\nmore than a factor of two for a nominal xenon detector setup, and by up to an\norder of magnitude in an ideal scenario, potentially accelerating access to the\nentire inverted ordering regime.

Standard approaches\nsuch as imputation or complete-case analysis can introduce bias or result in\nsubstantial information loss, especially when the missingness mechanism is not\nrandom. To address this methodological gap, we propose the Block-Pattern\nEnhanced Test (BPET), a general framework for two-sample testing that directly\naccounts for block-wise missingness without requiring imputation or deletion of\nobservations. As a concrete instantiation, we develop the Block-wise Rank In\nSimilarity graph Edge-count (BRISE) test, which extends rank-based similarity\ngraph methods to settings with block-wise missing data. Under mild conditions,\nwe establish that the null distribution of BRISE converges to a chi-squared\ndistribution.

In contrast, the performance in\nregression with continuous-valued outputs is poor compared to ML models, likely\nbecause regression demands outputs in a large (often infinite) space, and\nclustering results are similarly limited, which we attribute to the absence of\ngenuine ICL in this setting.

Given an MRG G with N nodes, partitioning\nthe node set therein into K disjoint clusters (MRGC) is a fundamental task in\nanalyzing MRGs, which has garnered considerable attention. However, the\nmajority of existing solutions towards MRGC either yield severely compromised\nresult quality by ineffective fusion of heterogeneous graph structures and\nattributes, or struggle to cope with sizable MRGs with millions of nodes and\nbillions of edges due to the adoption of sophisticated and costly deep learning\nmodels.\n  In this paper, we present DEMM and DEMM+, two effective MRGC approaches to\naddress the limitations above. Specifically, our algorithms are built on novel\ntwo-stage optimization objectives, where the former seeks to derive\nhigh-caliber node feature vectors by optimizing the multi-relational Dirichlet\nenergy specialized for MRGs, while the latter minimizes the Dirichlet energy of\nclustering results over the node affinity graph. In particular, DEMM+ achieves\nsignificantly higher scalability and efficiency over our based method DEMM\nthrough a suite of well-thought-out optimizations. Key technical contributions\ninclude (i) a highly efficient approximation solver for constructing node\nfeature vectors, and (ii) a theoretically-grounded problem transformation with\ncarefully-crafted techniques that enable linear-time clustering without\nexplicitly materializing the NxN dense affinity matrix. Further, we extend\nDEMM+ to handle attribute-less MRGs through non-trivial adaptations. Extensive\nexperiments, comparing DEMM+ against 20 baselines over 11 real MRGs, exhibit\nthat DEMM+ is consistently superior in terms of clustering quality measured\nagainst ground-truth labels, while often being remarkably faster.",

We then introduce a\nbilinear path integral generalization for wave-optical light transport that\nmodels the wave interference between paths. This formulation subsumes many\nexisting methods that rely on shooting-bouncing rays or UTD-based diffractions,\nand serves to give insight into the challenges of such approaches and the\ndifficulty of sampling good paths in a bilinear setting.\n  With this foundation, we develop a weakly-local path integral based on\nregion-to-region transport using elliptical cones that allows sampling\nindividual paths that still model wave effects accurately. As with the classic\npath integral form of the light transport equation, our path integral makes it\npossible to derive a variety of practical transport algorithms. We present a\ncomplete system for wave tracing with elliptical cones, with applications in\nlight transport for rendering and efficient simulation of long-wavelength\nradiation propagation and diffraction in complex environments.",

This \"sensory deprivation\" severely weakens their ability to\ninterpret the inherent spatio-temporal patterns within dynamic phenomena. To\naddress this gap, we propose VIPER-R1, a multimodal model that performs Visual\nInduction for Physics-based Equation Reasoning to discover fundamental symbolic\nformulas. It integrates visual perception, trajectory data, and symbolic\nreasoning to emulate the scientific discovery process. The model is trained via\na curriculum of Motion Structure Induction (MSI), using supervised fine-tuning\nto interpret kinematic phase portraits and to construct hypotheses guided by a\nCausal Chain of Thought (C-CoT), followed by Reward-Guided Symbolic Calibration\n(RGSC) to refine the formula structure with reinforcement learning. During\ninference, the trained VIPER-R1 acts as an agent: it first posits a\nhigh-confidence symbolic ansatz, then proactively invokes an external symbolic\nregression tool to perform Symbolic Residual Realignment (SR^2). This final\nstep, analogous to a physicist's perturbation analysis, reconciles the\ntheoretical model with empirical data. To support this research, we introduce\nPhysSymbol, a new 5,000-instance multimodal corpus.

Only half of the Hilbert\nspace--namely, the two-body states that are odd under point inversion about the\nposition of the barrier--is accessible to this method. The other half is\npresumably non-integrable. We consider benchmarking the recently proposed $1/g$\nexpansion about the hard-core boson point [A. G. Volosniev, D. V. Fedorov, A.\nS. Jensen, M.

In a perfect waveguide\ngeometry, we find that the relative number of quantum-correlated pairs formed\nby colliding Floquet-Kulik levels is equal to the inverse of the number of\ntransverse channels, due to the number of conserved quantities equal to the\nnumber of channels. This observation motivates a model for the intermediate\nregime in which the ballistic central two-dimensional normal metal is treated\nas a continuum under the adiabatic approximation, while Andreev modes propagate\nin a background of voltage- and flux-tunable nonequilibrium electronic\npopulations.

Across three studies, we find that\nagents exhibit endogenous stances, independent of their preset identities, and\ndisplay distinct tonal preferences and response patterns to different discourse\nstrategies.

To address this, we propose a Unified image-to-image Generation\n(UniGen) framework that supports diverse conditional inputs while enhancing\ngeneration efficiency and expressiveness. Specifically, to tackle the widely\nexisting parameter redundancy and computational inefficiency in controllable\nconditional generation architectures, we propose the Condition Modulated Expert\n(CoMoE) module.

By enabling independent modeling of foreground features\nunder different conditions, CoMoE effectively mitigates feature entanglement\nand redundant computation in multi-condition scenarios. Furthermore, to bridge\nthe information gap between the backbone and control branches, we propose\nWeaveNet, a dynamic, snake-like connection mechanism that enables effective\ninteraction between global text-level control from the backbone and\nfine-grained control from conditional branches. Extensive experiments on the\nSubjects-200K and MultiGen-20M datasets across various conditional image\ngeneration tasks demonstrate that our method consistently achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance, validating its advantages in both versatility and\neffectiveness.

We develop the theoretical framework in\nthe string frame where the baryons geodesics are free fall geodesics and we do\nnot treat the theory as a two scalar field theory in the Einstein frame. The\ntheoretical framework can be reduced to a single scalar field theory framework\nby using a perturbative expansion at the level of the field equations, making\nthe resulting theory easy to tackle analytically. The first two quantum\ncorrections contain two terms, a linear $\\sim \\mathcal{R}$ and a quadratic term\n$\\sim \\mathcal{R}^2$. The effect of the linear term alters the Einstein-Hilbert\nterm, making the resulting theory a rescaled version of Einstein-Hilbert\ngravity. Due to the presence of the rescaled Einstein-Hilbert term $\\sim\n\\lambda \\frac{\\mathcal{R}}{16\\pi G}$, the gravitational constant will no longer\nbe that of Newton's, but a rescaled one $\\frac{G}{\\lambda}$ and hence gravity\ncan be stronger primordially, or even weaker. The perspective of having\nstronger gravity primordially, is compatible with intuition, since one expects\na stronger gravity primordially, but having a weaker gravity for some reason is\nnot prohibited theoretically. The attribute of our theoretical framework is\nthat it allows a stronger gravity primordially, which returns to ordinary\ngravity as the curvature of the Universe decreases.

Despite\nnotable progress, existing multimodal fusion methods often neglect\nmodality-specific structural dependencies and semantic misalignment, limiting\ntheir quality, interpretability, and robustness. To address these challenges,\nwe propose a novel framework called the Structural-Semantic Unifier (SSU),\nwhich systematically integrates modality-specific structural information and\ncross-modal semantic grounding for enhanced multimodal representations.\nSpecifically, SSU dynamically constructs modality-specific graphs by leveraging\nlinguistic syntax for text and a lightweight, text-guided attention mechanism\nfor acoustic and visual modalities, thus capturing detailed intra-modal\nrelationships and semantic interactions. We further introduce a semantic\nanchor, derived from global textual semantics, that serves as a cross-modal\nalignment hub, effectively harmonizing heterogeneous semantic spaces across\nmodalities. Additionally, we develop a multiview contrastive learning objective\nthat promotes discriminability, semantic consistency, and structural coherence\nacross intra- and inter-modal views. Extensive evaluations on two widely used\nbenchmark datasets, CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI, demonstrate that SSU consistently\nachieves state-of-the-art performance while significantly reducing\ncomputational overhead compared to prior methods.

Both theories, $R^2$ and\ngravity's rainbow emerge from a quantum context so their effects should be\nfirst checked at the theory which connects the quantum with the classical,\nhence inflation.

    "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed the rapid development of acceleration techniques\nfor diffusion models, especially caching-based acceleration methods. These\nstudies seek to answer two fundamental questions: \"When to cache\" and \"How to\nuse cache\", typically relying on predefined empirical laws or dataset-level\npriors to determine the timing of caching and utilizing handcrafted rules for\nleveraging multi-step caches. However, given the highly dynamic nature of the\ndiffusion process, they often exhibit limited generalizability and fail on\noutlier samples. In this paper, a strong correlation is revealed between the\nvariation patterns of the shallow-layer feature differences in the diffusion\nmodel and those of final model outputs. Moreover, we have observed that the\nfeatures from different model layers form similar trajectories. Based on these\nobservations, we present DiCache, a novel training-free adaptive caching\nstrategy for accelerating diffusion models at runtime, answering both when and\nhow to cache within a unified framework. Specifically, DiCache is composed of\ntwo principal components: (1) Online Probe Profiling Scheme leverages a\nshallow-layer online probe to obtain a stable prior for the caching error in\nreal time, enabling the model to autonomously determine caching schedules. (2)\nDynamic Cache Trajectory Alignment combines multi-step caches based on\nshallow-layer probe feature trajectory to better approximate the current\nfeature, facilitating higher visual quality. Extensive experiments validate\nDiCache's capability in achieving higher efficiency and improved visual\nfidelity over state-of-the-art methods on various leading diffusion models\nincluding WAN 2.1, HunyuanVideo for video generation, and Flux for image\ngeneration.",

This review traces the\nevolution of DoW research, from initial awareness and attack classification to\nadvancements in detection and mitigation strategies.

Recent\nadvancements highlight machine learning approaches, including systems like\nGringotts and DoWNet, which leverage deep learning and anomaly detection to\nidentify malicious traffic patterns. Although substantial progress has been\nmade, challenges persist, notably the lack of real-world data and the need for\nadaptive billing models.

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a unified, condition-based framework for classifying both\nlegacy and cloud-era denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. The framework comprises\nthree interrelated models: a formal conditional tree taxonomy, a hierarchical\nlattice structure based on order theory, and a conceptual Venn diagram. At its\ncore, the taxonomy introduces six observable conditions (C0-C5) grounded in\nreal-world attack behaviours, including source distribution, traffic volume,\ninfrastructure targeting, and financial exploitation. These conditions enable\nconsistent classification of known attacks-such as DoS, DDoS, LDoS, LDDoS,\nEDoS, DoW, and DDoW, while supporting identification of emerging or hybrid\nvariants. The lattice structure captures the cumulative satisfaction of\nconditions, allowing hierarchical reasoning across denial attack classes. The\nVenn diagram highlights conceptual overlaps between availability- and\nsustainability-focused attacks, improving comparative insight. Together, these\nmodels provide a robust analytical lens for threat modeling, mitigation\nstrategy design, and attacker intent classification. The framework is\nparticularly relevant in cloud-native and serverless environments, where\nsustainability-based attacks are increasingly impactful yet under-recognised.\nIts extensibility also permits future integration of socio-technical or\nbehavioural dimensions. By offering a structured taxonomy with theoretical\ngrounding and real-world applicability, this work advances denial attack\ncomprehension and equips defenders, researchers, and cloud architects with a\nshared vocabulary for interpreting and mitigating evolving threat vectors.",

These binaries emit bursts of gravitational\nradiation during each pericenter passage. In isolated systems, the intrinsic\ntiming of these bursts is solely determined by the properties of the binary.\nThe presence of a nearby third body perturbs the system and alters the burst\ntiming. Accurately modeling such perturbations therefore offers a novel\napproach to detecting the presence of a nearby companion. Existing timing\nmodels account for Newtonian dynamics and leading-order radiation reaction\neffects but neglect the higher order post-Newtonian (PN) contributions to the\ninner binary. In this paper, we present an improved timing model that\nincorporates conservative PN corrections that lead to the precession of the\nbinary's pericenter. We find that these PN corrections significantly impact the\nbinary's orbital evolution and the timing of the GW burst. In particular, 1PN\nprecession gives rise to distinctive modulation features in the binary's\nsemilatus rectum and eccentricity. These modulations encode valuable\ninformation about the presence and properties of the third body, including its\nmass and distance. Furthermore, unmodeled 1PN effects significantly bias the\ntertiary's mass and distance. Finally we assess the detectability of GW bursts\nfrom such perturbed systems and demonstrate that the inclusion of PN\ncorrections is crucial for accurately capturing the orbital dynamics of\nhierarchical triples.",

    "abstract": "The utilization of Machine Learning (ML) in contemporary software systems is\nextensive and continually expanding. However, its usage is energy-intensive,\ncontributing to increased carbon emissions and demanding significant resources.\nWhile numerous studies examine the performance and accuracy of ML, only a\nlimited few focus on its environmental aspects, particularly energy\nconsumption. In addition, despite emerging efforts to compare energy\nconsumption across various programming languages for specific algorithms and\ntasks, there remains a gap specifically in comparing these languages for\nML-based tasks. This paper aims to raise awareness of the energy costs\nassociated with employing different programming languages for ML model training\nand inference. Through this empirical study, we measure and compare the energy\nconsumption along with run-time performance of five regression and five\nclassification tasks implemented in Python and R, the two most popular\nprogramming languages in this context. Our study results reveal a statistically\nsignificant difference in costs between the two languages in 95% of the cases\nexamined. Furthermore, our analysis demonstrates that the choice of programming\nlanguage can influence energy efficiency significantly, up to 99.16% during\nmodel training and up to 99.8% during inferences, for a given ML task.",

    "abstract": "AI agents have recently shown significant promise in software engineering.\nMuch public attention has been transfixed on the topic of code generation from\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) via a prompt. However, software engineering is\nmuch more than programming, and AI agents go far beyond instructions given by a\nprompt.\n  At the code level, common software tasks include code generation, testing,\nand program repair. Design level software tasks may include architecture\nexploration, requirements understanding, and requirements enforcement at the\ncode level. Each of these software tasks involves micro-decisions which can be\ntaken autonomously by an AI agent, aided by program analysis tools. This\ncreates the vision of an AI software engineer, where the AI agent can be seen\nas a member of a development team.\n  Conceptually, the key to successfully developing trustworthy agentic AI-based\nsoftware workflows will be to resolve the core difficulty in software\nengineering - the deciphering and clarification of developer intent.\nSpecification inference, or deciphering the intent, thus lies at the heart of\nmany software tasks, including software maintenance and program repair. A\nsuccessful deployment of agentic technology into software engineering would\ninvolve making conceptual progress in such intent inference via agents.\n  Trusting the AI agent becomes a key aspect, as software engineering becomes\nmore automated. Higher automation also leads to higher volume of code being\nautomatically generated, and then integrated into code-bases. Thus to deal with\nthis explosion, an emerging direction is AI-based verification and validation\n(V & V) of AI generated code. We posit that agentic software workflows in\nfuture will include such AIbased V&V.",

While existing methods\nsupport direct dance synthesis, they fail to recognize that enabling users to\nedit dance movements is far more practical in real-world choreography\nscenarios. Moreover, the lack of high-quality dance datasets incorporating\niterative editing also limits addressing this challenge. To achieve this goal,\nwe first construct DanceRemix, a large-scale multi-turn editable dance dataset\ncomprising the prompt featuring over 25.3M dance frames and 84.5K pairs. In\naddition, we propose a novel framework for iterative and editable dance\ngeneration coherently aligned with given music signals, namely DanceEditor.\nConsidering the dance motion should be both musical rhythmic and enable\niterative editing by user descriptions, our framework is built upon a\nprediction-then-editing paradigm unifying multi-modal conditions. At the\ninitial prediction stage, our framework improves the authority of generated\nresults by directly modeling dance movements from tailored, aligned music.\nMoreover, at the subsequent iterative editing stages, we incorporate text\ndescriptions as conditioning information to draw the editable results through a\nspecifically designed Cross-modality Editing Module (CEM). Specifically, CEM\nadaptively integrates the initial prediction with music and text prompts as\ntemporal motion cues to guide the synthesized sequences. Thereby, the results\ndisplay music harmonics while preserving fine-grained semantic alignment with\ntext descriptions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method\noutperforms the state-of-the-art models on our newly collected DanceRemix\ndataset. Code is available at https://lzvsdy.github.io/DanceEditor/.",

These limitations hinder the ability\nto capture how courts apply the law to facts in practice. In this paper, we\naddress these challenges by constructing a legal knowledge graph from 648\nJapanese administrative court decisions.

The resulting graph captures the full structure of\nlegal reasoning as it appears in real court decisions, making implicit\nreasoning explicit and machine-readable.

    "abstract": "This study investigates the thermodynamics of phantom BTZ black holes by\nincorporating leading-order perturbative corrections arising from small\nstatistical fluctuations around equilibrium. Starting from the phantom BTZ\nblack holes review, we describe a modified action in three-dimensional\nspacetime that includes coupling with a Maxwell or phantom field. The analysis\nderives the corresponding field equations and obtains exact solutions for the\nmetric and thermodynamic quantities. The corrected entropy is computed using\nthe steepest descent method. It is expressed in terms of the leading-order\nentropy and Hawking temperature. Standard thermodynamic relations yield the\ncorrected mass, Helmholtz free energy, specific heat, and Gibbs free energy.\nThese corrections reveal significant deviations from classical results,\nparticularly in the small black hole regime where statistical effects become\nprominent. Graphical analysis shows that the corrected entropy becomes negative\nfor sufficiently small black holes, indicating potential limitations in\nthermodynamic stability under perturbative corrections. Furthermore, the\ninfluence of thermal fluctuations proves substantial for the small black holes\nand negligible for larger black holes. In this work, we have also calculated\ncritical points and critical compressibility factor ($Z_{c}$) of the phantom\nBTZ black hole, treating it as a Van der Waals fluid. This work provides a\ncomprehensive understanding of how statistical fluctuations modify the\nthermodynamics of phantom BTZ black holes.

To address this, we introduce DropLoRA, a\nnovel pruning-based approach that focuses on pruning the rank dimension. Unlike\nconven- tional methods that attempt to overcome the low-rank bottleneck,\nDropLoRA innovatively integrates a pruning module between the two low-rank\nmatrices in LoRA to simulate dy- namic subspace learning. This dynamic low-\nrank subspace learning allows DropLoRA to overcome the limitations of\ntraditional LoRA, which operates within a static subspace. By continuously\nadapting the learning subspace, DropLoRA significantly boosts performance\nwithout incurring additional training or infer- ence costs.

    "abstract": "We present \\emph{Unified Lagrangian Perturbation Theory} (ULPT), a\nperturbative framework for consistently modeling galaxy density fluctuations\nacross real space, redshift space, and post-reconstruction fields. Unlike\nexisting approaches that treat these cases separately, ULPT provides a single\ntheoretical structure that incorporates the three essential coordinate\nmappings: the Lagrangian-to-Eulerian transformation, the real-to-redshift\nmapping induced by peculiar velocities, and the remapping from pre to post\nreconstruction. A key feature of our formulation is the explicit decomposition\nof the density field into two physically distinct components: the\n\\emph{Jacobian deviation}, which encodes intrinsic linear and nonlinear growth,\nand the \\emph{displacement-mapping effect}, which captures large-scale\nconvective distortions. This separation enables a fully analytic and infrared\n(IR)-safe resummation, ensuring exact IR cancellation, a consistent Gaussian\ndescription of baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) damping, and the correct\nresidual structure in cross spectra between fields with distinct IR behavior.\nThe perturbative expansion of ULPT naturally generates Galileon-type operators,\nthereby providing a compact and physically motivated operator basis for\nnonlinear and nonlocal Lagrangian bias, and allowing for a renormalization-free\ntreatment of biased tracers. Within this framework, we derive a unified\nexpression for the power spectrum that applies equally to dark matter, biased\ntracers, redshift-space distortions, and reconstructed fields. ULPT thus offers\na robust and extensible foundation for precision modeling of large-scale\nstructure, with potential extensions to higher-order statistics, such as the\nbispectrum, and to other two-point observables, such as galaxy--galaxy lensing.",

This paper focuses on\nthe security problems of large language models (LLMs) in critical application\nscenarios, such as the possibility of disclosure of user data, the deliberate\ninput of harmful instructions, or the models bias. To solve these problems, we\ndescribe the design of a system for dynamic risk assessment and a hierarchical\ndefence system that allows different levels of protection to cooperate. This\npaper presents a risk assessment system capable of evaluating both static and\ndynamic indicators simultaneously.

The experimental results show that the system is capable of\nidentifying concealed attacks, such as role escape, and can perform rapid risk\nevaluation. The paper uses a hybrid model called BERT-CRF (Bidirectional\nEncoder Representation from Transformers) at the input layer to identify and\nfilter malicious commands.

    "abstract": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising approach to\nenhance the timeliness of knowledge and the factual accuracy of responses in\nLarge Language Models (LLMs). However, the inclusion of excessive retrieved\ndocuments substantially increases the input length, leading to higher\ncomputational costs. Previous studies have attempted to compress retrieved\ndocuments into shorter texts before in-context integration, but such methods\noften compromise end-task performance. The lack of well-defined compression\ntargets forces many approaches to rely on fixed heuristics, which cannot\nguarantee that the compressed content will effectively support the end task. To\naddress these limitations, we propose CORE, a novel method designed to achieve\nlossless context compression for RAG. CORE employs reinforcement learning to\noptimize the compression process without relying on predefined compression\nlabels. Specifically, it utilizes end-task performance as a reward signal and\napplies Generalized Reinforcement Learning Policy Optimization (GRPO) to train\nthe compressor. This end-to-end training framework enables the compressor to\ngenerate summaries that maximize the accuracy of answers generated by the LLM.\nExtensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate the superiority of our\napproach. With a high compression ratio of 3\\%, our method not only avoids\nperformance degradation compared to prepending full documents across all\ndatasets but also improves the average Exact Match (EM) score by 3.3 points.\nThe code will be released soon.",

    "abstract": "Synthesizing spectral images across different wavelengths is essential for\nphotorealistic rendering. Unlike conventional spectral uplifting methods that\nconvert RGB images into spectral ones, we introduce SpecGen, a novel method\nthat generates spectral bidirectional reflectance distribution functions\n(BRDFs) from a single RGB image of a sphere. This enables spectral image\nrendering under arbitrary illuminations and shapes covered by the corresponding\nmaterial. A key challenge in spectral BRDF generation is the scarcity of\nmeasured spectral BRDF data. To address this, we propose the Spectral-Spatial\nTri-plane Aggregation (SSTA) network, which models reflectance responses across\nwavelengths and incident-outgoing directions, allowing the training strategy to\nleverage abundant RGB BRDF data to enhance spectral BRDF generation.\nExperiments show that our method accurately reconstructs spectral BRDFs from\nlimited spectral data and surpasses state-of-the-art methods in hyperspectral\nimage reconstruction, achieving an improvement of 8 dB in PSNR. Codes and data\nwill be released upon acceptance.",

    "abstract": "The rapid development of Deepfake technology poses severe challenges to\nsocial trust and information security. While most existing detection methods\nprimarily rely on passive analyses, due to unresolvable high-quality Deepfake\ncontents, proactive defense has recently emerged by inserting invisible signals\nin advance of image editing. In this paper, we introduce a proactive Deepfake\ndetection approach based on facial texture features. Since human eyes are more\nsensitive to perturbations in smooth regions, we invisibly insert perturbations\nwithin texture regions that have low perceptual saliency, applying localized\nperturbations to key texture regions while minimizing unwanted noise in\nnon-textured areas. Our texture-guided perturbation framework first extracts\npreliminary texture features via Local Binary Patterns (LBP), and then\nintroduces a dual-model attention strategy to generate and optimize texture\nperturbations. Experiments on CelebA-HQ and LFW datasets demonstrate the\npromising performance of our method in distorting Deepfake generation and\nproducing obvious visual defects under multiple attack models, providing an\nefficient and scalable solution for proactive Deepfake detection.",

Sliding window-based trust schemes cannot ensure\nreliable trust computation due to their inability to select appropriate window\nlengths. Besides, recent trust scores are emphasized when considering the\neffect of time on trust. This can cause a sudden change in overall trust score\nbased on recent behavior, potentially misinterpreting an honest service\nprovider as malicious and vice versa. Moreover, clustering mechanisms used to\nfilter recommendations in trust computation often lead to slower results. In\nthis paper, we propose a robust trust model to address these limitations.

It uses the harmonic mean of average trust score\nand time to prevent sudden fluctuations in trust scores. Additionally, an\nefficient personalized subspace clustering algorithm is used to exclude\nrecommendations. We present a security analysis demonstrating the resiliency of\nthe proposed scheme against bad-mouthing, ballot-stuffing, and on-off attacks.\nThe proposed scheme demonstrates a competitive performance in detecting\nbad-mouthing attacks, while outperforming existing works with an approximately\n44% improvement in accuracy for detecting on-off attacks.

By leveraging the established analogy between rotating\nspacetimes and inhomogeneous optical media, we derive a simple analytical\nformula that relates the average orbital angular momentum in the observed\nradiation to the black hole's charge-to-mass ratio. Applying this relation to\nexisting observational data, we place an upper bound of $\\mathcal{Q}/M \\lesssim\n0.39$ on the charge of M87*. While the analysis focuses on electric charge,\nwhich is used here purely as a theoretical example since astrophysical black\nholes are expected to be approximately neutral, the method is general and can\nbe extended to constrain other types of charges $\\unicode{x2013}$ degrees of\nfreedom that define distinct black hole solutions.

Despite\nsignificant advancements driven by deep learning (DL) in recent years, existing\nDL-based methods, typically trained on a specific dose level and anatomical\nregion, struggle to handle diverse noise characteristics and anatomical\nheterogeneity during varied scanning conditions, limiting their\ngeneralizability and robustness in clinical scenarios. In this paper, we\npropose FoundDiff, a foundational diffusion model for unified and generalizable\nLDCT denoising across various dose levels and anatomical regions. FoundDiff\nemploys a two-stage strategy: (i) dose-anatomy perception and (ii) adaptive\ndenoising. First, we develop a dose- and anatomy-aware contrastive language\nimage pre-training model (DA-CLIP) to achieve robust dose and anatomy\nperception by leveraging specialized contrastive learning strategies to learn\ncontinuous representations that quantify ordinal dose variations and identify\nsalient anatomical regions. Second, we design a dose- and anatomy-aware\ndiffusion model (DA-Diff) to perform adaptive and generalizable denoising by\nsynergistically integrating the learned dose and anatomy embeddings from DACLIP\ninto diffusion process via a novel dose and anatomy conditional block (DACB)\nbased on Mamba. Extensive experiments on two public LDCT datasets encompassing\neight dose levels and three anatomical regions demonstrate superior denoising\nperformance of FoundDiff over existing state-of-the-art methods and the\nremarkable generalization to unseen dose levels.

    "abstract": "Popularity bias is a well-known challenge in recommender systems, where a\nsmall number of popular items receive disproportionate attention, while the\nmajority of less popular items are largely overlooked. This imbalance often\nresults in reduced recommendation quality and unfair exposure of items.\nAlthough existing mitigation techniques address this bias to some extent, they\ntypically lack transparency in how they operate. In this paper, we propose a\npost-hoc method using a Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) to interpret and mitigate\npopularity bias in deep recommendation models. The SAE is trained to replicate\na pre-trained model's behavior while enabling neuron-level interpretability. By\nintroducing synthetic users with clear preferences for either popular or\nunpopular items, we identify neurons encoding popularity signals based on their\nactivation patterns. We then adjust the activations of the most biased neurons\nto steer recommendations toward fairer exposure. Experiments on two public\ndatasets using a sequential recommendation model show that our method\nsignificantly improves fairness with minimal impact on accuracy.

By examining the internal mechanisms\nof major cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Monero, and\nZcash, this review identifies specific vulnerabilities in transaction and\nconsensus processes. It further analyses the current hardware limitations of\nquantum systems and estimates when such attacks could become feasible.

The discussion integrates recent advancements in\nquantum error correction, hardware scalability, and NIST-standardized\ncryptographic algorithms. This review concludes that while quantum computers\nare not yet advanced enough to pose an immediate threat, proactive integration\nof quantum-resistant solutions is essential.

    "abstract": "The purpose of this paper is to investigate vertical self-resonant (VSR)\nbifurcations from distant retrograde orbit (DRO) family in the framework of the\nEarth-Moon CR3BP. To this end, by using a classical corrector-predictor\nalgorithm we compute the vertical stability of DROs and identify twelve\nvertical-critical DROs. We split them into three groups according to orbiting\naround libration points $L_i$, $i=1,2,4,5$. (i) We first analyze six VSR\nbifurcations of multiplicity from five to ten associated to DROs near the Moon.\n(ii) For DROs that move in addition around $L_1$ and $L_2$, we study four VSR\nbifurcations of multiplicity from five to eight. (iii) Within DROs additionally\norbiting also around $L_4$ and $L_5$, two vertical 1:1 resonant branch points\noccur. In total, we generate 21 bifurcated families of spatial symmetric\nperiodic solutions and present their orbital characteristics, including bridge\nfamilies to Butterfly, prograde orbits, quasi DRO and DRO. We also obtain\nbranches whose members approach collision with the Moon and are of Bumble Bee,\nHoverfly or Dragonfly shape. In order to provide a structured and systematic\noverview of such bifurcation results, we determine Conley-Zehnder indices and\nconstruct bifurcation diagrams in view of symplectic invariants.",

Using the Euler-Lagrange equation, we identify the most\nprobable transition path of the system's trajectory under stochastic\nperturbations.

    "abstract": "Energy-efficient computing is becoming increasingly important in the\ninformation era. However, electronic computers with von Neumann architecture\ncan hardly meet the challenge due to the inevitable energy-intensive data\nmovement, especially when tackling computationally hard problems or complicated\ntasks. Here, we experimentally demonstrate an energy-efficient photonic\ncomputer that solves intractable subset sum problem (SSP) by making use of the\nextremely low energy level of photons (~10^(-19) J) and a time-of-flight\nstorage technique. We show that the energy consumption of the photonic computer\nmaintains no larger than 10^(-15) J per operation at a reasonably large problem\nsize N=33, and it consumes 10^(8) times less energy than the most\nenergy-efficient supercomputer for a medium-scale problem. In addition, when\nthe photonic computer is applied to deal with real-life problems that involves\niterative computation of the SSP, the photonic advantage in energy consumption\nis further enhanced and massive energy can be saved. Our results indicate the\nsuperior competitiveness of the photonic computer in the energy costs of\ncomplex computation, opening a possible path to green computing.",

Motivated by this analogy, we propose an ultrafast Stern-Gerlach\n(USG) regime for low-energy quantum electron wavepacket (QEW), which crucially\nincorporates the effects of second-order dispersion inherent to slow electrons.\nWe demonstrate that the USG diffraction induces spectral splitting and shifting\nof the QEW via a longitudinal electric field gradient, with the two dominant\ntruncated sidebands forming a pseudospin degree of freedom for an effective\n\"two-level\" electron. Furthermore, by examining the wave-particle duality of\nthe QEW during light interaction, we identify a dispersion-induced anomalous\nBragg diffraction regime.

Physical fields are mathematical functions over continuous spaces\nthat exhibit certain properties of regularity, such as limited variance and\nfinite gradients.

However, the finite number of constraints that the\ndata provides is insufficient to determine the infinite number of degrees of\nfreedom of a field.

This paper introduces the basic concepts of IFT and\nNIFTy, highlights a few of their astrophysical applications, and discusses\ntheir artificial intelligence (AI) perspective.

Here, we present a\nmix-topology design strategy to induce strong ferromagnetic (FM) coupling in\nmetal-free 2D systems. By covalently connecting radical polyaromatic\nhydrocarbon monomers (also referred to as nanographenes) with distinct\nsublattice topologies, this approach rationally breaks inversion symmetry and\nenables selective alignment of majority spins across the extended network,\ngiving rise to metal-free ferromagnetism. Based on this strategy, we designed a\nfamily of 32 organic 2D crystals featuring spin-1/2 and mixed spin-1/2-spin-1\nhoneycomb lattices. Systematic first-principles calculations reveal that these\nmaterials are robust FM semiconductors with tunable spin-dependent bandgaps\nranging from 0.9 to 3.8 eV. Notably, we demonstrate record-high magnetic\ncoupling of up to 127 meV, spin-splitting energies exceeding 2 eV, and Curie\ntemperatures surpassing 550 K, indicating thermal stability well above room\ntemperature. The microscopic origin of the strong FM exchange stems from\nenhanced spin-orbital overlap and dominant direct exchange, while AFM\nsuperexchange is effectively suppressed.

    "abstract": "The Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) problem is a classic and widely studied\nmodel in optimal control, providing a fundamental framework for designing\ncontrollers for linear systems subject to process and observation noises. In\nrecent years, researchers have increasingly focused on directly parameterizing\ndynamic controllers and optimizing the LQG cost over the resulting\nparameterized set. However, this parameterization typically gives rise to a\nhighly non-convex optimization landscape for the resulting parameterized LQG\nproblem. To our knowledge, there is currently no general method for certifying\nthe global optimality of candidate controller parameters in this setting. In\nthis work, we address these gaps with the following contributions. First, we\nderive a necessary and sufficient condition for the global optimality of\nstationary points in a parameterized LQG problems. This condition reduces the\nverification of optimality to a test of the controllability and observability\nfor a novel, specially constructed transfer function, yielding a precise and\ncomputationally tractable certificate. Furthermore, our condition provides a\nrigorous explanation for why traditional parameterizations can lead to\nsuboptimal stationary points. Second, we elevate the controller parameter space\nfrom conventional finite-dimensional settings to the infinite-dimensional\n$\\mathcal{RH}_\\infty$ space and develop a gradient-based algorithm in this\nsetting, for which we provide a theoretical analysis establishing global\nconvergence. Finally, representative numerical experiments validate the\ntheoretical findings and demonstrate the practical viability of the proposed\napproach.

To address this, we propose\nRouteDK, a framework for routing distilled knowledge through a mixture of LoRA\nexpert architecture.

To further\nimprove inference reliability, we design an inference-time enhancement module\nto reduce variance and mitigate suboptimal reasoning.

A key mechanism governing the fate of injected gases\nis Ostwald ripening, the curvature-driven mass transfer between trapped gas\nganglia in porous media. While ripening is well understood in open systems, its\nbehavior in geometrically confined porous structures remains poorly\ncharacterized, especially over long timescales relevant to subsurface\noperations. Here, we present ultra-high-resolution microfluidic experiments\nthat capture the evolution of residually trapped hydrogen over weeks in\nrealistic, heterogeneous pore geometries under well-defined boundary\nconditions. We observe a distinct two-stage dynamic: a rapid local\nequilibration among neighboring bubbles, followed by slow global depletion\ndriven by long-range diffusion toward low-chemical potential boundaries.\nBuilding on these insights, we develop and validate a continuum model that\ncouples microscale capillary pressure-saturation (Pc-s) relationships,\nextracted via the pore-morphology method, with macroscopic diffusive transport.\nThe model accurately predicts gas saturation evolution without fitting\nparameters and collapses experimental results across a range of experimental\nconditions. Extending the model to reservoir scales, we estimate equilibration\ntimescales for CO2 and H2 in homogeneous sandstone aquifers. We find that\nripening occurs much faster than convective dissolution in CO2 sequestration,\nand on timescales comparable to seasonal H2 storage operations.

At\nvariance with time-dependent density-functional theory, this formulation aims\nat studying charged excitations and electronic spectra -- including electronic\ncorrelations -- with a functional theory; An explicit and formally correct\ndescription of all electronic levels could also lead to more accurate\napproximations for the total energy.",

    "abstract": "Recent developments in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and their applications in\ncritical industries such as healthcare, fin-tech and cybersecurity have led to\na surge in research in explainability in AI. Innovative research methods are\nbeing explored to extract meaningful insight from blackbox AI systems to make\nthe decision-making technology transparent and interpretable. Explainability\nbecomes all the more critical when AI is used in decision making in domains\nlike fintech, healthcare and safety critical systems such as cybersecurity and\nautonomous vehicles. However, there is still ambiguity lingering on the\nreliable evaluations for the users and nature of transparency in the\nexplanations provided for the decisions made by black-boxed AI. To solve the\nblackbox nature of Machine Learning based Intrusion Detection Systems, a\nframework is proposed in this paper to give an explanation for IDSs decision\nmaking. This framework uses Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations\n(LIME) coupled with Explain Like I'm five (ELI5) and Decision Tree algorithms\nto provide local and global explanations and improve the interpretation of\nIDSs. The local explanations provide the justification for the decision made on\na specific input. Whereas, the global explanations provides the list of\nsignificant features and their relationship with attack traffic. In addition,\nthis framework brings transparency in the field of ML driven IDS that might be\nhighly significant for wide scale adoption of eXplainable AI in cyber-critical\nsystems. Our framework is able to achieve 85 percent accuracy in classifying\nattack behaviour on UNSW-NB15 dataset, while at the same time displaying the\nfeature significance ranking of the top 10 features used in the classification.",

    "abstract": "Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) process multimodal inputs consisting of\ntext tokens and vision tokens extracted from images or videos. Due to the rich\nvisual information, a single image can generate thousands of vision tokens,\nleading to high computational costs during the prefilling stage and significant\nmemory overhead during decoding. Existing methods attempt to prune redundant\nvision tokens, revealing substantial redundancy in visual representations.\nHowever, these methods often struggle in shallow layers due to the lack of\nsufficient contextual information. We argue that many visual tokens are\ninherently redundant even in shallow layers and can be safely and effectively\npruned with appropriate contextual signals. In this work, we propose CoViPAL, a\nlayer-wise contextualized visual token pruning method that employs a\nPlug-and-Play Pruning Module (PPM) to predict and remove redundant vision\ntokens before they are processed by the LVLM. The PPM is lightweight,\nmodel-agnostic, and operates independently of the LVLM architecture, ensuring\nseamless integration with various models. Extensive experiments on multiple\nbenchmarks demonstrate that CoViPAL outperforms training-free pruning methods\nunder equal token budgets and surpasses training-based methods with comparable\nsupervision. CoViPAL offers a scalable and efficient solution to improve\ninference efficiency in LVLMs without compromising accuracy.",

Previously, it was\nbelieved that such leakage could be contained within a facility since they are\nweak signals with a short transmission range. However, in the preliminary\nversion of this work [1], we found that the traditional cable repairing process\nforms a tiny monopole antenna that helps emanations transmit over a long range.\nExperimentation with three types of cables revealed that emanations from\nrepaired cables remain detectable even at >4 m and can penetrate a 14 cm thick\nconcrete wall. In this extended version, we show that such emanation can be\nexploited at a long distance for information extraction by detecting keystrokes\ntyped on a repaired USB keyboard. By collecting data for 70 different\nkeystrokes at different distances from the target in 3 diverse environments\n(open space, a corridor outside an office room, and outside a building) and\ndeveloping an efficient detection algorithm, ~100% keystroke detection accuracy\nhas been achieved up to 12 m distance, which is the highest reported accuracy\nat such a long range for USB keyboards in the literature. The effect of two\nexperimental factors, interference and human-body coupling, has been\ninvestigated thoroughly.

    "abstract": "Monocular 3D human pose estimation (HPE) methods estimate the 3D positions of\njoints from individual images. Existing 3D HPE approaches often use the cropped\nimage alone as input for their models. However, the relative depths of joints\ncannot be accurately estimated from cropped images without the corresponding\ncamera intrinsics, which determine the perspective relationship between 3D\nobjects and the cropped images. In this work, we introduce Perspective Encoding\n(PE) to encode the camera intrinsics of the cropped images. Moreover, since the\nhuman subject can appear anywhere within the original image, the perspective\nrelationship between the 3D scene and the cropped image differs significantly,\nwhich complicates model fitting. Additionally, the further the human subject\ndeviates from the image center, the greater the perspective distortions in the\ncropped image. To address these issues, we propose Perspective Rotation (PR), a\ntransformation applied to the original image that centers the human subject,\nthereby reducing perspective distortions and alleviating the difficulty of\nmodel fitting. By incorporating PE and PR, we propose a novel 3D HPE framework,\nPersPose. Experimental results demonstrate that PersPose achieves\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the 3DPW, MPI-INF-3DHP, and Human3.6M\ndatasets. For example, on the in-the-wild dataset 3DPW, PersPose achieves an\nMPJPE of 60.1 mm, 7.54% lower than the previous SOTA approach. Code is\navailable at: https://github.com/KenAdamsJoseph/PersPose.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a new perspective on unifying all fundamental\ninteractions--gravitational, electromagnetic, weak and strong--based on\nstochastic processes rather than conventional quantum mechanics. Earlier work\nby Nelson, Kac and others have established that key quantum features such as\nthe Schr\\\"{o}dinger and Dirac equations together with the Born rule can be\nderived from classical random processes involving finite speeds and\nprobabilistic reversals. A fundamental length scale, inherent for dimensional\nconsistency, regularizes the infinities that typically plague conventional\nfield theories. The method can be used to quantize electrodynamics as well as\nlinear gravity, using the Riemann-Silberstein vector and its generalization.\n  To include fields beyond electromagnetism, the Riemann-Silberstein vector can\nbe generalized to describe non-Abelian gauge fields without relying on gauge\nsymmetry. These fields can be coupled to spin networks--geometric structures\nthat discretize space--leading to a unified framework that includes both matter\nand geometrty. In the large-scale limit, the model reproduces familiar quantum\nfield behaviour, while remaining finite and background-independent at the\nfundamental level. The emergence of equilibrium states resembling\nWheeler-DeWill constraints in gravity adds further depth, suggesting a novel\nroute to quantum gravity and unification grounded in physical stochasticity\nrather than quantization rules.",

    "abstract": "Hyperbolic neural networks (HNNs) have demonstrated notable efficacy in\nrepresenting real-world data with hierarchical structures via exploiting the\ngeometric properties of hyperbolic spaces characterized by negative curvatures.\nCurvature plays a crucial role in optimizing HNNs. Inappropriate curvatures may\ncause HNNs to converge to suboptimal parameters, degrading overall performance.\nSo far, the theoretical foundation of the effect of curvatures on HNNs has not\nbeen developed. In this paper, we derive a PAC-Bayesian generalization bound of\nHNNs, highlighting the role of curvatures in the generalization of HNNs via\ntheir effect on the smoothness of the loss landscape. Driven by the derived\nbound, we propose a sharpness-aware curvature learning method to smooth the\nloss landscape, thereby improving the generalization of HNNs. In our method,\n  we design a scope sharpness measure for curvatures, which is minimized\nthrough a bi-level optimization process. Then, we introduce an implicit\ndifferentiation algorithm that efficiently solves the bi-level optimization by\napproximating gradients of curvatures. We present the approximation error and\nconvergence analyses of the proposed method, showing that the approximation\nerror is upper-bounded, and the proposed method can converge by bounding\ngradients of HNNs. Experiments on four settings: classification, learning from\nlong-tailed data, learning from noisy data, and few-shot learning show that our\nmethod can improve the performance of HNNs.",

However,\ndue to the scarcity of large-scale 3D data, it is still hard to extract a\nuniversal 3D representation from web datasets. Instead, we are seeking a\ngeneral visual pre-training framework that could improve all 3D representations\nas an alternative. Our framework, called FVP, is a novel 4D Visual Pre-training\nframework for real-world robot learning. FVP frames the visual pre-training\nobjective as a next-point-cloud-prediction problem, models the prediction model\nas a diffusion model, and pre-trains the model on the larger public datasets\ndirectly. Across twelve real-world manipulation tasks, FVP boosts the average\nsuccess rate of 3D Diffusion Policy (DP3) for these tasks by 28%. The FVP\npre-trained DP3 achieves state-of-the-art performance across imitation learning\nmethods. Moreover, the efficacy of FVP adapts across various point cloud\nencoders and datasets. Finally, we apply FVP to the RDT-1B, a larger\nVision-Language-Action robotic model, enhancing its performance on various\nrobot tasks.

While post-training alignment has\nproven effective in other generative domains like text and image generation,\nits application to generative speech restoration remains largely\nunder-explored. This work investigates the challenges of applying\npreference-based post-training to this task, focusing on how to define a robust\npreference signal and curate high-quality data to avoid reward hacking. To\naddress these challenges, we propose a multi-metric preference alignment\nstrategy. We construct a new dataset, GenSR-Pref, comprising 80K preference\npairs, where each chosen sample is unanimously favored by a complementary suite\nof metrics covering perceptual quality, signal fidelity, content consistency,\nand timbre preservation. This principled approach ensures a holistic preference\nsignal. Applying Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with our dataset, we\nobserve consistent and significant performance gains across three diverse\ngenerative paradigms: autoregressive models (AR), masked generative models\n(MGM), and flow-matching models (FM) on various restoration benchmarks, in both\nobjective and subjective evaluations. Ablation studies confirm the superiority\nof our multi-metric strategy over single-metric approaches in mitigating reward\nhacking. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our aligned models can serve as\npowerful ''data annotators'', generating high-quality pseudo-labels to serve as\na supervision signal for traditional discriminative models in data-scarce\nscenarios like singing voice restoration.

Consequently, it is crucial to balance meaningful transparency\nwith a form of recourse that clarifies why a decision was made and offers\nactionable steps following which a favorable outcome can be obtained.\nCounterfactual explanations offer a powerful mechanism to address this need by\nshowing how specific input changes lead to a more favorable prediction.

Second, this surrogate is used\nto generate counterfactuals that produce a favourable outcome for the original\nunderlying black box model. Third, MC3G refines cost computation by excluding\nthe ``effort\" associated with feature changes that occur automatically due to\ncausal dependencies. By focusing only on user-initiated changes, MC3G provides\na more realistic and fair representation of the effort needed to achieve a\nfavourable outcome.

At the cluster level, existing prefix caching systems are\ntightly coupled with request scheduling to optimize cache efficiency and\ncomputation performance together, leading to load imbalance, data redundancy,\nand memory fragmentation of caching systems across instances. To address these\nissues, memory pooling is promising to shield the scheduler from the underlying\ncache management so that it can focus on the computation optimization. However,\nbecause existing prefix caching systems only transfer increasingly longer\nprefix caches between instances, they cannot achieve low-latency memory\npooling.\n  To address these problems, we propose a unified segment-level prefix cache\npool, TokenLake. It uses a declarative cache interface to expose requests'\nquery tensors, prefix caches, and cache-aware operations to TokenLake for\nefficient pooling. Powered by this abstraction, TokenLake can manage prefix\ncache at the segment level with a heavy-hitter-aware load balancing algorithm\nto achieve better cache load balance, deduplication, and defragmentation.\nTokenLake also transparently minimizes the communication volume of query\ntensors and new caches.

    "abstract": "With the rapidly increased number of vehicles in urban areas, existing road\ninfrastructure struggles to accommodate modern traffic demands, resulting in\nthe issue of congestion. This highlights the importance of efficient path\nplanning strategies.

In this work, we address the\nreliable shortest path problem within stochastic transportation networks under\ncertain dependencies.

    "abstract": "Tables are a prevalent format for structured data, yet their metadata, such\nas semantic types and column relationships, is often incomplete or ambiguous.\nColumn annotation tasks, including Column Type Annotation (CTA) and Column\nProperty Annotation (CPA), address this by leveraging table context, which are\ncritical for data management. Existing methods typically serialize all columns\nin a table into pretrained language models to incorporate context, but this\ncoarse-grained approach often degrades performance in wide tables with many\nirrelevant or misleading columns. To address this, we propose a novel\nretrieve-and-verify context selection framework for accurate column annotation,\nintroducing two methods: REVEAL and REVEAL+. In REVEAL, we design an efficient\nunsupervised retrieval technique to select compact, informative column contexts\nby balancing semantic relevance and diversity, and develop context-aware\nencoding techniques with role embeddings and target-context pair training to\neffectively differentiate target and context columns. To further improve\nperformance, in REVEAL+, we design a verification model that refines the\nselected context by directly estimating its quality for specific annotation\ntasks. To achieve this, we formulate a novel column context verification\nproblem as a classification task and then develop the verification model.\nMoreover, in REVEAL+, we develop a top-down verification inference technique to\nensure efficiency by reducing the search space for high-quality context subsets\nfrom exponential to quadratic. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets\ndemonstrate that our methods consistently outperform state-of-the-art\nbaselines.",

Using a standardized prompt based on AAPM RCA guidelines, each\nmodel was instructed to identify root causes, lessons learned, and suggested\nactions. Outputs were assessed using semantic similarity metrics (cosine\nsimilarity via Sentence Transformers), semi-subjective evaluations (precision,\nrecall, F1-score, accuracy, hallucination rate, and four performance criteria:\nrelevance, comprehensiveness, justification, and solution quality), and\nsubjective expert ratings (reasoning quality and overall performance) from five\nboard-certified medical physicists.\n  Results LLMs showed promising performance. GPT-4o had the highest cosine\nsimilarity (0.831), while Gemini 2.5 Pro had the highest recall (0.762) and\naccuracy (0.882). Hallucination rates ranged from 11% to 51%.

    "abstract": "Weakly-Supervised Change Detection (WSCD) aims to distinguish specific object\nchanges (e.g., objects appearing or disappearing) from background variations\n(e.g., environmental changes due to light, weather, or seasonal shifts) in\npaired satellite images, relying only on paired image (i.e., image-level)\nclassification labels. This technique significantly reduces the need for dense\nannotations required in fully-supervised change detection. However, as\nimage-level supervision only indicates whether objects have changed in a scene,\nWSCD methods often misclassify background variations as object changes,\nespecially in complex remote-sensing scenarios. In this work, we propose an\nAdversarial Class Prompting (AdvCP) method to address this co-occurring noise\nproblem, including two phases: a) Adversarial Prompt Mining: After each\ntraining iteration, we introduce adversarial prompting perturbations, using\nincorrect one-hot image-level labels to activate erroneous feature mappings.\nThis process reveals co-occurring adversarial samples under weak supervision,\nnamely background variation features that are likely to be misclassified as\nobject changes. b) Adversarial Sample Rectification: We integrate these\nadversarially prompt-activated pixel samples into training by constructing an\nonline global prototype. This prototype is built from an exponentially weighted\nmoving average of the current batch and all historical training data. Our AdvCP\ncan be seamlessly integrated into current WSCD methods without adding\nadditional inference cost. Experiments on ConvNet, Transformer, and Segment\nAnything Model (SAM)-based baselines demonstrate significant performance\nenhancements. Furthermore, we demonstrate the generalizability of AdvCP to\nother multi-class weakly-supervised dense prediction scenarios. Code is\navailable at https://github.com/zhenghuizhao/AdvCP",

MAS2S captures long-term dependencies in wind\npower data for accurate imputation. Extensive experiments on real-world wind\nfarm datasets validate the superiority of ZTFed-MAS2S in both federated\nlearning performance and missing data imputation, demonstrating its\neffectiveness as a secure and efficient solution for practical applications in\nthe energy sector.",

We employ a physical equation of state,\noptically-thin neutrino cooling, and assume an electron fraction set by the\nbalance of electron/positron pair-capture reactions. Disks in a marginally\nstable initial state (Toomre parameter Q~ 1) undergo runaway cooling and\nfragmentation when the dimensionless cooling timescale obeys tau_cool =\nt_cool*Omega < 10, where Omega is the orbital frequency; these conditions\ncorrespond to accretion rates > Msun/s on the upper end of those achieved by\ncollapsar progenitor stars. Fragmentation leads to the formation of\nneutron-rich clumps (electron fraction Ye ~ 0.1) spanning a range of masses\n~0.01-1 Msun around the local Jeans value. Most clumps exceed the local\nChandrasekhar mass M_Ch ~ Ye^2 and hence will continue to collapse to nuclear\ndensities, forming neutron stars (NS) with sub-solar masses otherwise\nchallenging to create through ordinary stellar core-collapse. Even cool disks\ndominated by alpha-particles (Ye ~ 0.5) can fragment and collapse into\nneutron-rich clumps capable of forming sub-solar NSs. Although our simulations\ncannot follow this process directly, if the disk-formed NSs subsequently pair\ninto binaries, the gravitational wave chirps from their rapid mergers are\npotentially detectable by ground based observatories.

Our core idea lies in\nthe fact that the vector nature of an electromagnetic wave is uniquely\ndetermined by its orthogonal electric and magnetic field components, both of\nwhich can be retrieved by a single Rydberg atomic receiver via\nelectromagnetically induced transparency (EIT)-based spectroscopy. To be\nspecific, in the presence of a static magnetic bias field that defines a stable\nquantization axis, a pair of sequential EIT measurements is carried out in the\nsame vapor cell. Firstly, the electric-field polarization angle is extracted\nfrom the Zeeman-resolved EIT spectrum associated with an electric-dipole\ntransition driven by the radio frequency (RF) field. Within the same\nexperimental cycle, the RF field is then retuned to a magnetic-dipole\nresonance, producing Zeeman-resolved EIT peaks for decoding the RF\nmagnetic-field orientation. This scheme exhibits a dual yet independent\nsensitivity on both angles, allowing for precise DoA reconstruction without the\nneed for spatial diversity or phase referencing. Building on this foundation,\nwe derive the quantum Fisher-information matrix (QFIM) and obtain a closed-form\nquantum Cram\\'{e}r-Rao bound (QCRB) for the joint estimation of polarization\nand orientation angles.

Using the\nATMO2020 evolutionary models, we estimate a mass of 12-39 $M_{\\rm Jup}$ for the\nprimary and 7-24 $M_{\\rm Jup}$ for the companion assuming an age of 1-10 Gyr\nfor a mass ratio of 0.55-0.62, resulting in an estimated period of 16-28 years.\nIt is unknown which component of this binary exhibits the methane emission\nfeature. We also resolve known companions WISE J014656.66+423410.0B and WISE\nJ171104.60+350036.8B using MIRI data and present their F1000W and F1280W\nphotometry.",

    "abstract": "Graphs have become a central representation in machine learning for capturing\nrelational and structured data across various domains. Traditional graph neural\nnetworks often struggle to capture long-range dependencies between nodes due to\ntheir local structure. Graph transformers overcome this by using attention\nmechanisms that allow nodes to exchange information globally. However, there\nare two types of attention in graph transformers: dense and sparse. In this\npaper, we compare these two attention mechanisms, analyze their trade-offs, and\nhighlight when to use each. We also outline current challenges and problems in\ndesigning attention for graph transformers.",

    "abstract": "Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection ensures safe and reliable model\ndeployment. Contemporary OOD algorithms using geometry projection can detect\nOOD or adversarial samples from clean in-distribution (ID) samples. However,\nthis setting regards adversarial ID samples as OOD, leading to incorrect OOD\npredictions. Existing efforts on OOD detection with ID and OOD data under\nattacks are minimal. In this paper, we develop a robust OOD detection method\nthat distinguishes adversarial ID samples from OOD ones. The sharp loss\nlandscape created by adversarial training hinders model convergence, impacting\nthe latent embedding quality for OOD score calculation. Therefore, we introduce\na {\\bf Sharpness-aware Geometric Defense (SaGD)} framework to smooth out the\nrugged adversarial loss landscape in the projected latent geometry. Enhanced\ngeometric embedding convergence enables accurate ID data characterization,\nbenefiting OOD detection against adversarial attacks. We use Jitter-based\nperturbation in adversarial training to extend the defense ability against\nunseen attacks. Our SaGD framework significantly improves FPR and AUC over the\nstate-of-the-art defense approaches in differentiating CIFAR-100 from six other\nOOD datasets under various attacks. We further examine the effects of\nperturbations at various adversarial training levels, revealing the\nrelationship between the sharp loss landscape and adversarial OOD detection.",

    "abstract": "This paper develops a novel COllaborative-Online-Learning (COOL)-enabled\nmotion control framework for multi-robot systems to avoid collision amid\nrandomly moving obstacles whose motion distributions are partially observable\nthrough decentralized data streams. To address the notable challenge of data\nacquisition due to occlusion, a COOL approach based on the Dirichlet process\nmixture model is proposed to efficiently extract motion distribution\ninformation by exchanging among robots selected learning structures. By\nleveraging the fine-grained local-moment information learned through COOL, a\ndata-stream-driven ambiguity set for obstacle motion is constructed. We then\nintroduce a novel ambiguity set propagation method, which theoretically admits\nthe derivation of the ambiguity sets for obstacle positions over the entire\nprediction horizon by utilizing obstacle current positions and the ambiguity\nset for obstacle motion. Additionally, we develop a compression scheme with its\nsafety guarantee to automatically adjust the complexity and granularity of the\nambiguity set by aggregating basic ambiguity sets that are close in a measure\nspace, thereby striking an attractive trade-off between control performance and\ncomputation time. Then the probabilistic collision-free trajectories are\ngenerated through distributionally robust optimization problems. The\ndistributionally robust obstacle avoidance constraints based on the compressed\nambiguity set are equivalently reformulated by deriving separating hyperplanes\nthrough tractable semi-definite programming. Finally, we establish the\nprobabilistic collision avoidance guarantee and the long-term tracking\nperformance guarantee for the proposed framework. The numerical simulations are\nused to demonstrate the efficacy and superiority of the proposed approach\ncompared with state-of-the-art methods.",

As medial temporal lobe\n(MTL) is the earliest region to show AD-related hallmarks, brain atrophy caused\nby AD can first be observed in the MTL. Accurate segmentation of MTL subregions\nand extraction of imaging biomarkers from them are important. However, due to\nimaging limitations, the resolution of T2-weighted (T2w) MRI is anisotropic,\nwhich makes it difficult to accurately extract the thickness of cortical\nsubregions in the MTL. In this study, we used an implicit neural representation\nmethod to combine the resolution advantages of T1-weighted and T2w MRI to\naccurately upsample an MTL subregion atlas set from anisotropic space to\nisotropic space, establishing a multi-modality, high-resolution atlas set.\nBased on this atlas, we developed an isotropic MTL subregion segmentation\nmodel. In an independent test set, the cortical subregion thickness extracted\nusing this isotropic model showed higher significance than an anisotropic\nmethod in distinguishing between participants with mild cognitive impairment\nand cognitively unimpaired (CU) participants. In longitudinal analysis, the\nbiomarkers extracted using isotropic method showed greater stability in CU\nparticipants.

To address this, we propose\nincorporating the natural gradient into OGD and present \\textbf{ONG (Orthogonal\nNatural Gradient Descent)}. ONG preconditions each new task-specific gradient\nwith an efficient EKFAC approximation of the inverse Fisher information matrix,\nyielding updates that follow the steepest descent direction under a Riemannian\nmetric.
