    "abstract": "Addressing usability in free, libre, and open-source software (FLOSS) is a\nchallenging issue, particularly due to a long-existing \"by developer, for\ndeveloper\" mentality. Engaging designers and end-users to work with developers\ncan help improve its usability, but unequal power dynamics among those\nstakeholder roles must be mitigated. To explore how the power of different\nFLOSS stakeholders manifests and can be mediated during collaboration, we\nconducted eight design workshops with different combinations of key FLOSS\nstakeholders (i.e., developers, designers, and end-users). Leveraging existing\ntheories on Dimensions of Power, we revealed how participants navigate existing\nrole-based power structures through resource utilization, knowledge gap\nmanagement, and experience referencing. We also observed that participants\nexhibited diverse behaviors confirming and challenging the status quo of FLOSS\nusability. Overall, our results contribute to a comprehensive understanding of\nthe power dynamics among FLOSS stakeholders, providing valuable insights into\nways to balance their power to improve FLOSS usability. Our work also serves as\nan exemplar of using design workshops as a research method to study power\ndynamics during collaboration that are usually hidden in the field.",

The\ndiscriminator identifies anomalous patterns in transactions, enabling the\ndetection of potential fraud and money laundering behaviors. Second, a VAE is\nintroduced to model the latent distribution of payment flows, ensuring that the\ngenerated data more closely resembles real transaction features, thus improving\nthe model's detection accuracy. The method optimizes the generative\ncapabilities of both GAN and VAE, ensuring that the model can effectively\ncapture suspicious behaviors even in sparse data conditions. Experimental\nresults show that the proposed method significantly outperforms traditional\nmachine learning algorithms and other deep learning models across various\nevaluation metrics, especially in detecting rare fraudulent behaviors.\nFurthermore, this study provides a detailed comparison of performance in\nrecognizing different transaction patterns (such as normal, money laundering,\nand fraud) in large payment flows, validating the advantages of generative\nmodels in handling complex financial data.",

We present\nthree-dimensional, general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of low\nangular momentum accretion flows around rapidly spinning black holes (with spin\n$a = +0.9$). The initial condition is a Fishbone-Moncrief (FM) torus threaded\nby a large amount of poloidal magnetic flux, where the angular velocity is a\nfraction $f$ of the standard value. For $f = 0$, the accretion flow becomes\nmagnetically arrested and launches relativistic jets but only for a very short\nduration. After that, free-falling plasma breaks through the magnetic barrier,\nloading the jet with mass and destroying the jet-disk structure. Meanwhile,\nmagnetic flux is lost via giant, asymmetrical magnetic bubbles that float away\nfrom the black hole. The accretion then exits the magnetically arrested state.\nFor $f = 0.1$, the dimensionless magnetic flux threading the black hole\noscillates quasi-periodically. The jet-disk structure shows concurrent revival\nand destruction while the gas outflow efficiency at the event horizon changes\naccordingly. For $f \\geq 0.3$, we find that the dynamical behavior of the\nsystem starts to approach that of a standard accreting FM torus. Our results\nthus suggest that the accreted angular momentum is an important parameter that\ngoverns the maintenance of a magnetically arrested flow and launching of\nrelativistic jets around black holes.",

Fourier analysis\nof the NN kernels reveals that they learn low-pass, Gabor, and high-pass\nfilters, regardless of whether the training data are isotropic or anisotropic.\nBy analyzing the activation spectra, we identify why NNs fail to generalize\nwithout TL and how TL can overcome these limitations: the learned weights and\nbiases from one dataset underestimate the out-of-distribution sample spectra as\nthey pass through the network, leading to an underestimation of output spectra.\nBy re-training only one layer with data from the target system, this\nunderestimation is corrected, enabling the NN to produce predictions that match\nthe target spectra.

Meanwhile, plasma within the plunging region of the black hole free\nfalls into the event horizon with a bulk relativistic speed, which could also\nimprint polarization on up-scattered photons but has not been discussed in\ndetail. To examine this, we computed polarimetric signatures via general\nrelativistic ray-tracing of a toy model consisting of an accreting,\ngeometrically thin plasma with moderate optical depth, falling onto the black\nhole with a bulk relativistic speed within the plunging region. We show that\nthe maximum spatially unresolved linear polarization could be as large as\napproximately $7 - 8$ percent when the black hole is viewed near edge-on, while\nthe corresponding resolved linear polarization could be roughly $50$ percent.\nThe large discrepancy between the two is due to 1) dilution from the radiation\noutside the plunging region and 2) substantial cancellations of the Stokes $Q$\nand $U$ fluxes. The resultant polarization contributed by bulk Comptonization\ncould nevertheless exceed that of thermal electron scattering in a\nNovikov-Thorne disk. Our results thus suggest a new model for imprinting\nconsiderable polarization on the electromagnetic observables of accreting black\nholes.

To test\nmodels' ability to reason about multiple occluded objects, we introduce a novel\ntask, Counting Amodally for Patterns Through Unseen REgions (CAPTURe), which\nrequires a model to count objects arranged in a pattern by inferring how the\npattern continues behind an occluder (an object which blocks parts of the\nscene). CAPTURe requires both recognizing visual patterns and reasoning, making\nit a useful testbed for evaluating vision-language models (VLMs) on whether\nthey understand occluded patterns and possess spatial understanding skills. By\nrequiring models to reason about occluded objects, CAPTURe also tests VLMs'\nability to form world models that would allow them to fill in missing\ninformation. CAPTURe consists of two parts: (1) CAPTURe-real, with manually\nfiltered images of real objects in patterns and (2) CAPTURe-synthetic, a\ncontrolled diagnostic with generated patterned images. We evaluate four strong\nVLMs (GPT-4o, Intern-VL2, Molmo, and Qwen2-VL) on CAPTURe, finding that models\nstruggle to count on both occluded and unoccluded patterns. Crucially, we find\nthat models perform worse with occlusion, suggesting that VLMs are also\ndeficient in inferring unseen spatial relationships: even the strongest VLMs\nlike GPT-4o fail to count with occlusion. In contrast, we find that humans\nachieve very little error on CAPTURe. We also find that providing auxiliary\ninformation of occluded object locations increases performance, underscoring\nthat the model error comes both from an inability to handle occlusion as well\nas difficulty in counting in images.

In addition, given an auxiliary dataset of\nimage descriptors, we show how to accompany counterfactuals with feature\nattribution that quantify the changes between the original and counterfactual\nimages. These importance scores can be aggregated into global counterfactual\nexplanations that highlight the overall features driving model predictions.\nWhile this unification is possible for any counterfactual method, it has\nparticular computational efficiency for ours. We demonstrate the efficacy of\nour approach with the MNIST and CelebA datasets.",

    "abstract": "Recent developments in Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) allow large\nlanguage models (LLMs) to function as implicit ranking models by maximizing the\nmargin between preferred and non-preferred responses. In practice, user\nfeedback on such lists typically involves identifying a few relevant items in\ncontext rather than providing detailed pairwise comparisons for every possible\nitem pair. Moreover, many complex information retrieval tasks, such as\nconversational agents and summarization systems, critically depend on ranking\nthe highest-quality outputs at the top, emphasizing the need to support natural\nand flexible forms of user feedback. To address the challenge of limited and\nsparse pairwise feedback in the in-context setting, we propose an In-context\nRanking Preference Optimization (IRPO) framework that directly optimizes LLMs\nbased on ranking lists constructed during inference. To further capture\nflexible forms of feedback, IRPO extends the DPO objective by incorporating\nboth the relevance of items and their positions in the list. Modeling these\naspects jointly is non-trivial, as ranking metrics are inherently discrete and\nnon-differentiable, making direct optimization difficult. To overcome this,\nIRPO introduces a differentiable objective based on positional aggregation of\npairwise item preferences, enabling effective gradient-based optimization of\ndiscrete ranking metrics. We further provide theoretical insights showing that\nIRPO (i) automatically emphasizes items with greater disagreement between the\nmodel and the reference ranking, and (ii) links its gradient to an importance\nsampling estimator, yielding an unbiased estimator with reduced variance.\nEmpirical results show IRPO outperforms standard DPO approaches in ranking\nperformance, highlighting its effectiveness in aligning LLMs with direct\nin-context ranking preferences.",

Understanding the dynamics of the reverse diffusion process is\ncrucial in steering the generation and achieving high sample quality. However,\nthe inner workings of diffusion models is still largely a mystery due to their\nblack-box nature and complex, multi-step generation process. Mechanistic\nInterpretability (MI) techniques, such as Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs), aim at\nuncovering the operating principles of models through granular analysis of\ntheir internal representations. These MI techniques have been successful in\nunderstanding and steering the behavior of large language models at scale.\nHowever, the great potential of SAEs has not yet been applied toward gaining\ninsight into the intricate generative process of diffusion models. In this\nwork, we leverage the SAE framework to probe the inner workings of a popular\ntext-to-image diffusion model, and uncover a variety of human-interpretable\nconcepts in its activations. Interestingly, we find that even before the first\nreverse diffusion step is completed, the final composition of the scene can be\npredicted surprisingly well by looking at the spatial distribution of activated\nconcepts. Moreover, going beyond correlational analysis, we show that the\ndiscovered concepts have a causal effect on the model output and can be\nleveraged to steer the generative process. We design intervention techniques\naimed at manipulating image composition and style, and demonstrate that (1) in\nearly stages of diffusion image composition can be effectively controlled, (2)\nin the middle stages of diffusion image composition is finalized, however\nstylistic interventions are effective, and (3) in the final stages of diffusion\nonly minor textural details are subject to change.",

We find that bigram subnetworks can be found in\nfully trained language models up to 1B parameters, and these subnetworks are\ncritical for model performance even when they consist of less than 0.2% of\nmodel parameters. Bigram subnetworks are concentrated in the first Transformer\nMLP layer, and they overlap significantly with subnetworks trained to optimally\nprune a given model. Mechanistically, the bigram subnetworks often recreate a\npattern from the full models where the first layer induces a sharp change that\naligns activations with next token predictions rather than current token\nrepresentations. Our results demonstrate that bigram subnetworks comprise a\nminimal subset of parameters that are both necessary and sufficient for basic\nnext token predictions in language models, and they help drive the\ntransformation from current to next token activations in the residual stream.\nThese subnetworks can lay a foundation for studying more complex language model\ncircuits by building up from a minimal circuit.",

    "abstract": "As artificial intelligence systems increasingly permeate processes of\ncultural and epistemic production, there are growing concerns about how their\noutputs may confine individuals and groups to static or restricted narratives\nabout who or what they could be. In this paper, we advance the discourse\nsurrounding these concerns by making three contributions. First, we introduce\nthe concept of aspirational affordance to describe how culturally shared\ninterpretive resources can shape individual cognition, and in particular\nexercises practical imagination. We show how this concept can ground productive\nevaluations of the risks of AI-enabled representations and narratives. Second,\nwe provide three reasons for scrutinizing of AI's influence on aspirational\naffordances: AI's influence is potentially more potent, but less public than\ntraditional sources; AI's influence is not simply incremental, but ecological,\ntransforming the entire landscape of cultural and epistemic practices that\ntraditionally shaped aspirational affordances; and AI's influence is highly\nconcentrated, with a few corporate-controlled systems mediating a growing\nportion of aspirational possibilities. Third, to advance such a scrutiny, we\nintroduce the concept of aspirational harm, which, in the context of AI\nsystems, arises when AI-enabled aspirational affordances distort or diminish\navailable interpretive resources in ways that undermine individuals' ability to\nimagine relevant practical possibilities and alternative futures. Through three\ncase studies, we illustrate how aspirational harms extend the existing\ndiscourse on AI-inflicted harms beyond representational and allocative harms,\nwarranting separate attention. Through these conceptual resources and analyses,\nthis paper advances understanding of the psychological and societal stakes of\nAI's role in shaping individual and collective aspirations.",

    "abstract": "The surging demand for GPUs in datacenters for machine learning (ML) has made\nefficient GPU utilization crucial. However, meeting the diverse needs of ML\nmodels while optimizing resource usage is challenging. To enable transparent,\nfine-grained GPU management that maximizes utilization and energy efficiency\nwhile maintaining strong isolation, an operating system (OS) approach is\nneeded. This paper introduces LithOS, a first step toward a GPU OS. LithOS\nincludes the following new abstractions and mechanisms for efficient GPU\nresource management: (i) a novel TPC Scheduler that supports spatial scheduling\nat the granularity of individual TPCs, unlocking efficient TPC stealing between\nworkloads; (ii) transparent kernel atomization to reduce head-of-line blocking\nand enable dynamic resource reallocation mid-execution; (iii) a lightweight\nhardware right-sizing mechanism that determines the minimal TPC resources\nneeded per atom; and (iv) a transparent power management mechanism that reduces\npower consumption based on in-flight work behavior. We implement LithOS in Rust\nand evaluate its performance across extensive ML environments, comparing it to\nstate-of-the-art solutions from NVIDIA and prior research. For inference\nstacking, LithOS reduces tail latencies by 13x compared to MPS; compared to the\nbest SotA, it reduces tail latencies by 3x while improving aggregate throughput\nby 1.6x. In hybrid inference-training stacking, LithOS reduces tail latencies\nby 4.7x compared to MPS; compared to the best SotA, it reduces tail latencies\n1.18x while improving aggregate throughput by 1.35x. Finally, for a modest\nperformance hit under 4%, LithOS's right-sizing provides a quarter of GPU\ncapacity savings on average, while for a 7% hit, its power management yields a\nquarter of a GPU's energy savings. Overall, LithOS increases GPU efficiency,\nestablishing a foundation for future OS research on GPUs.",

    "abstract": "Background: Morbid obesity is associated with metabolic alterations and the\nonset of type 2 diabetes. Patients who undergo a malabsorptive bariatric\nsurgery show an important improvement in several clinical variables and a\nmodification in the gut microbiota balance. In this study, we aimed to identify\nbacteria related to changes in the body mass index of patients who underwent a\nbariatric surgery and their relationship with nutrients intake. Results: There\nwere differences in bacterial diversity in the gut microbiota of patients that\nunderwent a bariatric surgery. The Shannon and Simpson indexes decrease after\nthe surgery (p < 0.001) and the beta diversity indexes (Bray-Curtis, Weighted\nand Unweighted UniFrac) showed differences when comparing pre- and post-surgery\n(p = 0.001). The abundance of a species in the genus Coprococcus correlated\npositively with the intake of magnesium and thiamin in post-surgery individuals\n(rho = 0.816, pFDR = 0.029 and rho = 0.812, pFDR = 0.029, respectively) and was\nrelated to BMI in both groups (p = 0.043 pre-surgery and p = 0.036\npost-surgery). The abundances of several bacteria belonging to the order\nClostridiales, as well as an enrichment of vitamin B1 (thiamin) biosynthesis,\nsugar degradation, acetate production and some amino acids biosynthesis were\nhigher before the surgery. Conclusions: The abundance of a species of the genus\nCoprococcus that showed inverse relationships with BMI in pre-surgery and\npost-surgery patients correlates with the intake of magnesium and thiamin in\nindividuals that underwent a malabsorptive bariatric surgery. It indicates that\nthe well-established beneficial effects of bariatric surgery on BMI may be\namplified by modulating the intake of micronutrients and its effect on the gut\nbacterial.",

    "abstract": "The State-Dependent Riccati Equation (SDRE) approach has emerged as a\nsystematic and effective means of designing nearly optimal nonlinear\ncontrollers. The Barrier States (BaS) embedding methodology was developed\nrecently for safe multi-objective controls in which the safety condition is\nmanifested as a state to be controlled along with other states of the system.\nThe overall system, termed the safety embedded system, is highly nonlinear even\nif the original system is linear. This paper develops a nonlinear nearly\noptimal safe feedback control technique by combining the two strategies\neffectively. First, the BaS is derived in an extended linearization formulation\nto be subsequently used to form an extended safety embedded system. A new\noptimal control problem is formed thereafter, which is used to construct a\nsafety embedded State-Dependent Riccati Equation, termed BaS-SDRE, whose\nsolution approximates the solution of the optimal control problem's associated\nHamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation. The BaS-SDRE is then solved online to\nsynthesize the nearly optimal safe control. The proposed technique's efficacy\nis demonstrated on an unstable, constrained linear system that shows how the\nsynthesized control reacts to nonlinearities near the unsafe region, a\nnonlinear flight control system with limited path angular velocity that exists\ndue to structural and dynamic concerns, and a planar quadrotor system that\nnavigates safely in a crowded environment.",

However, a\nsimilar relation is harder to determine for the warm-hot phase of the\nintergalactic gas, since its higher Doppler parameter and significantly lower\nneutral gas fraction makes this gas difficult to detect in absorption. We use a\nsample of 13 broad Ly$\\alpha$ absorbers (BLAs) detected in the HST/COS spectrum\nof a single QSO ($z\\sim0.27$), whose sightline intersects several inter-cluster\naxes, to study the relation between BLAs and the large-scale structure of the\nUniverse. Given their Doppler parameters of $b>40$ km s$^{-1}$, BLAs are good\ntracers of warm-hot intergalactic gas. We use VLT/MUSE and VLT/VIMOS data to\ninfer local overdensities of galaxies at the redshifts of the BLAs, and to\nassess the potential association of the BLAs with nearby galaxies. We find that\nout of the 13 BLAs in our sample, four are associated with a strong overdensity\nof galaxies, and four with tentative overdensities. The remaining five are\nlocated at redshifts where we do not identify any excess of galaxies. We find\nthat these overdensities of galaxies at the redshift of BLAs are local, and\nthey vanish when larger cosmic volumes are considered, in terms of a larger\nvelocity offset to the BLA or larger impact parameter to the QSO sightline.\nFinally, we find a positive correlation between the total hydrogen column\ndensities inferred from the BLAs, and the relative excess of galaxies at the\nsame redshifts, consistent with the picture where warm-hot gas resides deep\nwithin the gravitational potential well of cosmic filaments.",

This\nenhancement arises from the combined contributions of the Berry curvature\ninduced anomalous Nernst coefficient associated with topological bands and the\nnormal Nernst effect resulting from synergistic electron-hole compensation.\nGenerally, these two effects are intertwined in topological semimetals, making\nit challenging to evaluate them independently. Here, we report the observation\nof high Nernst effect in the electron hole compensated semimetal ScSb with\ntopologically trivial electronic band structures. Remarkably, we find a high\nmaximum Nernst power factor of $PF_N \\sim 35 \\times 10^{-4}$ W m$^{-1}$\nK$^{-2}$ in ScSb. The Nernst thermopower ($S_{xy}$) exhibits a peak of $\\sim$\n47 $\\mu$V/K at 12 K and 14 T, yielding a Nernst figure of merit ($z_N$) of\n$\\sim 28 \\times 10^{-4}$ K$^{-1}$. Notably, despite its trivial electronic band\nstructure, both the $PF_N$ and $z_N$ values of ScSb are comparable to those\nobserved in topological semimetals with Dirac band dispersions. The origin of\nthe large Nernst signal in ScSb is explained by well compensated electron and\nhole carriers, through Hall resistivity measurements, angle-resolved\nphotoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and density functional theory (DFT)\ncalculations.",

To address these limitations, Polygon has\nemerged as a sidechain solution that facilitates asset transfers between\nEthereum and Polygon, thereby improving scalability and reducing costs.\nHowever, current cross-chain transactions, particularly those between Ethereum\nand Polygon, lack transparency and traceability.

It\nleverages the unique feature that user addresses are consistent across\nEVM-compatible blockchains. We develop a matching heuristic algorithm that\nlinks transactions between the source and target chains by combining\ntransaction time, value, and token identification. Applying our methodology to\nover 2 million cross-chain transactions (August 2020-August 2023) between\nEthereum and Polygon, we achieve matching rates of up to 99.65% for deposits\nand 92.78% for withdrawals, across different asset types including Ether,\nERC-20 tokens, and NFTs. In addition, we provide a comprehensive analysis of\nvarious properties and characteristics of cross-chain transactions.

    "abstract": "A popular approach to detect cyberattacks is to monitor systems in real-time\nto identify malicious activities as they occur. While these solutions aim to\ndetect threats early, minimizing damage, they suffer from a significant\nchallenge due to the presence of false positives. False positives have a\ndetrimental impact on computer systems, which can lead to interruptions of\nlegitimate operations and reduced productivity. Most contemporary works tend to\nuse advanced Machine Learning and AI solutions to address this challenge.\nUnfortunately, false positives can, at best, be reduced but not eliminated.\n  In this paper, we propose an alternate approach that focuses on reducing the\nimpact of false positives rather than eliminating them. We introduce Valkyrie,\na framework that can enhance any existing runtime detector with a\npost-detection response. Valkyrie is designed for time-progressive attacks,\nsuch as micro-architectural attacks, rowhammer, ransomware, and cryptominers,\nthat achieve their objectives incrementally using system resources. As soon as\nan attack is detected, Valkyrie limits the allocated computing resources,\nthrottling the attack, until the detector's confidence is sufficiently high to\nwarrant a more decisive action. For a false positive, limiting the system\nresources only results in a small increase in execution time. On average, the\nslowdown incurred due to false positives is less than 1% for single-threaded\nprograms and 6.7% for multi-threaded programs. On the other hand, attacks like\nrowhammer are prevented, while the potency of micro-architectural attacks,\nransomware, and cryptominers is greatly reduced.",

    "abstract": "Optical networks composed of interconnected waveguides are a versatile\nplatform to simulate bosonic physical phenomena. Significant work in the\nnon-interacting regime has demonstrated the capabilities of this platform to\nsimulate many exotic effects such as photon transport in the presence of gauge\nfields, dynamics of quantum walks, and topological transition and dissipation\nphenomena. However, the extension of these concepts to simulating interacting\nquantum many-body phenomena such as the Bose-Hubbard and the fractional quantum\nHall (FQH) physics has remained elusive. In this work, we address this problem\nand demonstrate a framework for quantum many-body simulation as well as drive\nand dissipation in photonic waveguides. Specifically, we show that for\nwaveguide photons, a tunable on-site interaction can be simulated using a\nphoton-number-selective phase gate. We propose an implementation of such a\nphase gate based on a three-level-atom-mediated photon subtraction and\naddition. We apply this approach to bosonic lattice models and propose circuits\nthat can accurately simulate the Bose-Hubbard and FQH Hamiltonian as\nbenchmarking examples. Moreover, we show how to simulate the Lindbladian\nevolution with engineered dissipators such that the steady state of the\nLindbadlian corresponds to the ground state of desired Hamiltonians. Our scheme\nextends the waveguide photonic simulation platform to the strongly interacting\nquantum many-body regime while retaining all of its crucial advantages, such as\nsingle-site addressability, Hamiltonian parameter controllability, and hardware\nefficiency.",

We introduce Iris, a new high-performance digital pathology\nrendering system. Specifically, we outline and detail the performance metrics\nof Iris Core, the core rendering engine technology.

We provide a detailed\nexplanation of Iris Core's system architecture, including the stateless\nisolation of core processes, interprocess communication paradigms, and explicit\nsynchronization paradigms that provide powerful control over the graphical\nprocessing unit. Iris Core achieves slide rendering at the sustained maximum\nframe rate on all tested platforms and buffers an entire new slide field of,\nview without overlapping pixels, in 10 ms with enhanced detail in 30 ms.

Specifically, we show that when an orientifold plane contributes at\nleading order to the non-zero value of the scalar potential, then either the\nweak coupling limit or the large volume limit implies scale separation, meaning\nthat the Kaluza-Klein tower mass decouples from the inverse length scale of the\nlower-dimensional theory. Notably, in the supergravity limit such solutions are\ninherently scale-separated. This result is independent of the spacetime\ndimension and the dimensionality of the O$p$-plane as long as $p<7$. Similarly,\nwe show that parametric scale separation is not possible for isotropic\ncompactifications with a leading curvature term that generically arise in the\nAdS/CFT context. We classify all possible flux compactification setups in both\ntype IIA and type IIB string theory for O$p$-planes with $2\\leq p\\leq 6$ and\npresent their universal features.

    "abstract": "The prevalence of distressing content on social media raises concerns about\nusers' mental well-being, prompting the use of trigger warnings (TW) and\ncontent warnings (CW). However, inconsistent implementation of TW/CW across\nplatforms and the lack of standardized practices confuse users regarding these\nwarnings. To better understand how users experienced and utilized these\nwarnings, we conducted a semi-structured interview study with 15 general social\nmedia users. Our findings reveal challenges across three key stakeholders:\nviewers, who need to decide whether to engage with warning-labeled content;\nposters, who struggle with whether and how to apply TW/CW to the content; and\nplatforms, whose design features shape the visibility and usability of\nwarnings. While users generally expressed positive attitudes toward warnings,\ntheir understanding of TW/CW usage was limited. Based on these insights, we\nproposed a conceptual framework of the TW/CW mechanisms from multiple\nstakeholders' perspectives. Lastly, we further reflected on our findings and\ndiscussed the opportunities for social media platforms to enhance users' TW/CW\nexperiences, fostering a more trauma-informed social media environment.",

However, erroneous or\nmissing traceability relationships often arise due to improper propagation of\nrequirement changes or human errors in requirement mapping, leading to\ninconsistencies and increased maintenance costs. Existing approaches do not\naddress traceability between stakeholder and system requirements, rely on\nopen-source data -- as opposed to automotive (or any industry) data -- and do\nnot address the validation of manual links established by engineers.\nAdditionally, automotive requirements often exhibit variations in the way they\nare expressed, posing challenges for supervised models requiring training. The\nrecent advancements in large language models (LLMs) provide new opportunities\nto address these challenges.

We empirically evaluate TVR on automotive\nrequirements, achieving 98.87% accuracy in traceability validation and 85.50%\ncorrectness in traceability recovery. Additionally, TVR demonstrates strong\nrobustness, achieving 97.13% in accuracy when handling unseen requirements\nvariations.

    "abstract": "Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks represent a persistent and\nevolving threat to modern networked systems, capable of causing large-scale\nservice disruptions. The complexity of such attacks, often hidden within\nhigh-dimensional and redundant network traffic data, necessitates robust and\nintelligent feature selection techniques for effective detection. Traditional\nmethods such as filter-based, wrapper-based, and embedded approaches, each\noffer strengths but struggle with scalability or adaptability in complex attack\nenvironments. In this study, we explore these existing techniques through a\ndetailed comparative analysis and highlight their limitations when applied to\nlarge-scale DDoS detection tasks. Building upon these insights, we introduce a\nnovel Generative Adversarial Network-based Feature Selection (GANFS) method\nthat leverages adversarial learning dynamics to identify the most informative\nfeatures. By training a GAN exclusively on attack traffic and employing a\nperturbation-based sensitivity analysis on the Discriminator, GANFS effectively\nranks feature importance without relying on full supervision. Experimental\nevaluations using the CIC-DDoS2019 dataset demonstrate that GANFS not only\nimproves the accuracy of downstream classifiers but also enhances computational\nefficiency by significantly reducing feature dimensionality.

While most JISC\nworks have considered gaseous injection, liquid injection is also of practical\ninterest and introduces additional multiscale physics, such as atomization and\nevaporation, that complicate the flow dynamics. To facilitate further\nunderstanding of these complex phenomena, this work presents multiphase\nsimulations of reacting and non-reacting JISC configurations with freestream\nMach numbers of roughly 4.5. Adaptive mesh refinement is used with a volume of\nfluid scheme to capture liquid breakup and turbulent mixing at high resolution.\nThe results compare the effects of the jet momentum ratio and freestream\ntemperature on jet penetration, mixing, and combustion dynamics. For similar\njet momentum ratios, the jet penetration and mixing characteristics are similar\nfor the reacting and non-reacting cases. Mixing analyses reveal that vorticity\nand turbulent kinetic energy intensities peak in the jet shear layers, where\nvortex stretching is the dominant turbulence generation mechanism for all\ncases. Cases with lower freestream temperatures yield negligible heat release,\nwhile cases with elevated freestream temperatures exhibit chemical reactions\nprimarily along the leading bow shock and within the boundary layer in the jet\nwake. The evaporative cooling quenches the chemical reactions in the primary\natomization zone at the injection height, such that the flow rates of several\nproduct species plateau after x/d=20. Substantial concentrations of final\nproduct species are only observed along the bow shock-due to locally elevated\ntemperature and pressure-and in the boundary layer far downstream-where lower\nflow velocities counteract the effects of prolonged ignition delays. This\ncombination of factors leads to low combustion efficiency at the domain exit.",

    "abstract": "Existing evaluation frameworks for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)\nprimarily focus on image reasoning or general video understanding tasks,\nlargely overlooking the significant role of image context in video\ncomprehension. To bridge this gap, we propose IV-Bench, the first comprehensive\nbenchmark for evaluating Image-Grounded Video Perception and Reasoning.\nIV-Bench consists of 967 videos paired with 2,585 meticulously annotated\nimage-text queries across 13 tasks (7 perception and 6 reasoning tasks) and 5\nrepresentative categories. Extensive evaluations of state-of-the-art\nopen-source (e.g., InternVL2.5, Qwen2.5-VL) and closed-source (e.g., GPT-4o,\nGemini2-Flash and Gemini2-Pro) MLLMs demonstrate that current models\nsubstantially underperform in image-grounded video Perception and Reasoning,\nmerely achieving at most 28.9% accuracy. Further analysis reveals key factors\ninfluencing model performance on IV-Bench, including inference pattern, frame\nnumber, and resolution. Additionally, through a simple data synthesis approach,\nwe demonstratethe challenges of IV- Bench extend beyond merely aligning the\ndata format in the training proecss. These findings collectively provide\nvaluable insights for future research. Our codes and data are released in\nhttps://github.com/multimodal-art-projection/IV-Bench.",

    "abstract": "Learning-based approaches, particularly reinforcement learning (RL), have\nbecome widely used for developing control policies for autonomous agents, such\nas locomotion policies for legged robots. RL training typically maximizes a\npredefined reward (or minimizes a corresponding cost/loss) by iteratively\noptimizing policies within a simulator. Starting from a randomly initialized\npolicy, the empirical expected reward follows a trajectory with an overall\nincreasing trend. While some policies become temporarily stuck in local optima,\na well-defined training process generally converges to a reward level with\nnoisy oscillations. However, selecting a policy for real-world deployment is\nrarely an analytical decision (i.e., simply choosing the one with the highest\nreward) and is instead often performed through trial and error. To improve\nsim-to-real transfer, most research focuses on the pre-convergence stage,\nemploying techniques such as domain randomization, multi-fidelity training,\nadversarial training, and architectural innovations. However, these methods do\nnot eliminate the inevitable convergence trajectory and noisy oscillations of\nrewards, leading to heuristic policy selection or cherry-picking. This paper\naddresses the post-convergence sim-to-real transfer problem by introducing a\nworst-case performance transference optimization approach, formulated as a\nconvex quadratic-constrained linear programming problem. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate its effectiveness in transferring RL-based locomotion policies from\nsimulation to real-world laboratory tests.",

    "abstract": "We introduce two notions of barrier certificates that use multiple functions\nto provide a lower bound on the probabilistic satisfaction of safety for\nstochastic dynamical systems. A barrier certificate for a stochastic dynamical\nsystem acts as a nonnegative supermartingale, and provides a lower bound on the\nprobability that the system is safe. The promise of such certificates is that\ntheir search can be effectively automated. Typically, one may use optimization\nor SMT solvers to find such barrier certificates of a given fixed template.\nWhen such approaches fail, a typical approach is to instead change the\ntemplate. We propose an alternative approach that we dub interpolation-inspired\nbarrier certificates. An interpolation-inspired barrier certificate consists of\na set of functions that jointly provide a lower bound on the probability of\nsatisfying safety. We show how one may find such certificates of a fixed\ntemplate, even when we fail to find standard barrier certificates of the same\ntemplate. However, we note that such certificates still need to ensure a\nsupermartingale guarantee for one function in the set. To address this\nchallenge, we consider the use of $k$-induction with these\ninterpolation-inspired certificates. The recent use of $k$-induction in barrier\ncertificates allows one to relax the supermartingale requirement at every time\nstep to a combination of a supermartingale requirement every $k$ steps and a\n$c$-martingale requirement for the intermediate steps. We provide a generic\nformulation of a barrier certificate that we dub $k$-inductive\ninterpolation-inspired barrier certificate. The formulation allows for several\ncombinations of interpolation and $k$-induction for barrier certificate. We\npresent two examples among the possible combinations. We finally present\nsum-of-squares programming to synthesize this set of functions and demonstrate\ntheir utility in case studies.",

In this\nwork, we introduce a framework for delegated variational quantum algorithms\n(DVQAs), where a client with limited quantum capabilities delegates the\nexecution of a VQA to a more powerful quantum server. In particular, we\nintroduce a protocol that enables a client to delegate a variational quantum\nalgorithm to a server while ensuring that the input, the output and also the\ncomputation itself remain secret. Additionally, if the protocol does not abort,\nthe client can be certain that the computation outcome is indeed correct. This\nwork builds on the general verification protocol introduced by Fitzimons and\nKashefi (2017), tailoring it to VQAs. Our approach first proposes a verifiable\nProtocol for delegating the quantum computation required at each optimization\nstep of a VQA, and then combines the iterative steps into an error-resilient\noptimization process that offers end-to-end verifiable algorithm execution. We\nalso simulate the performance of our protocol tackling the Transverse Field\nIsing Model.

As a consequence,\nthe tumbling rate adjusts to changes in the concentration of relevant\nchemicals, to produce a biased random walk toward chemoattractants of against\nthe repellers. Methylation is a slow process, implying that the internal\nconcentration of CheY-P is not instantaneously adapted to the environment, and\nthe tumbling rate presents memory. This implies that the Keller-Segel (KS)\nequations used to describe chemotaxis at the macroscopic scale, which assume a\nlocal relation between the bacterial flux and the chemical gradient, are not\nfully valid as memory and the associated nonlocal response are not considered.\nTo derive the equations that replace the KS ones, we use a kinetic approach, in\nwhich a kinetic equation for the bacterial transport is written considering the\ndynamics of the protein concentration. When memory is large, the protein\nconcentration field must be considered a relevant variable as the bacterial\ndensity. Working out the Chapman-Enskog (CE) method, the dynamical equations\nfor these fields are obtained, which have the form of reaction-diffusion\nequations with flux and source terms depending on the gradients on the chemical\nsignal. The transport coefficients are obtained entirely in terms of the\nmicroscopic dynamics, giving their values of the case of E.coli. Solving the\nequations for an inhomogeneous signal it is shown that the response is\nnonlocal, with a smoothing length as large as $170\\mu$m for E.coli. The\nhomogeneous response and the relaxational dynamics are also studied. The case\nof small memory is also studied, in which case the CE method reproduces the KS\nequations, with explicit expressions for the transport coefficients.",

    "abstract": "A perfect tensor of order $d$ is a state of four $d$-level systems that is\nmaximally entangled under any bipartition. These objects have attracted\nconsiderable attention in quantum information and many-body theory. Perfect\ntensors generalize the combinatorial notion of orthogonal Latin squares (OLS).\nDeciding whether OLS of a given order exist has historically been a difficult\nproblem. The case $d=6$ proved particularly thorny, and was popularized by\nLeonhard Euler in terms of a putative constellation of \"36 officers\". It took\nmore than a century to show that Euler's puzzle has no solution. After yet\nanother century, its quantum generalization was resolved in the affirmative: 36\nentangled officers can be suitably arranged. However, the construction and\nverification of known instances relies on elaborate computer codes. In this\npaper, we present the first human-made order-$6$ perfect tensors. We decompose\nthe Hilbert space $(\\mathbb{C}^6)^{\\otimes 2}$ of two quhexes into the direct\nsum $(\\mathbb{C}^3)^{\\otimes 2}\\oplus(\\mathbb{C}^3)^{\\otimes 3}$ comprising\nsuperpositions of two-qutrit and three-qutrit states. Perfect tensors arise\nwhen certain Clifford unitaries are applied separately to the two sectors.\nTechnically, our construction realizes solutions to the perfect functions\nansatz recently proposed by Rather. Generalizing an observation of Bruzda and\n\\.Zyczkowski, we show that any solution of this kind gives rise to a\ntwo-unitary complex Hadamard matrix, of which we construct infinite families.\nFinally, we sketch a formulation of the theory of perfect tensors in terms of\nquasi-orthogonal decompositions of matrix algebras.",

    "abstract": "Any attempt to understand the ubiquitous nature of the magnetic field in the\npresent universe seems to lead us towards its primordial origin. For\nlarge-scale magnetic fields, however, their strength and length scale may not\nnecessarily originate from a singular primordial mechanism, namely inflationary\nmagnetogenesis, which has been a popular consideration in the literature. In\nthis paper, we propose a minimal scenario wherein a large-scale magnetic field\nis generated from the inflationary perturbation without any non-conformal\ncoupling. Due to their origin in the inflationary scalar spectrum, these\nprimordial fields are inherently weak, with their strength suppressed by the\nsmall amplitude of scalar fluctuations. We then consider the coupling between\nthis large-scale weak primordial magnetic field and a light axion of mass\n$<10^{-28}$ eV, which is assumed to be frozen in a misaligned state until the\nphoton decoupling. After the decoupling, when the universe enters into a dark\nage, the light axion coherently oscillates. By appropriately tuning the\naxion-photon coupling parameter $\\alpha$, we demonstrate that a large-scale\nmagnetic field of sufficient strength can indeed be generated through tachyonic\nresonance. We further show that the produced magnetic field induces a unique\nspectrum with multiple peaks of secondary gravitational waves, which the\nupcoming CMB-S4 can probe through B-mode polarization. The strength can be\nsufficient enough to violate the PLANCK bound on tensor-to-scalar ratio $r\n\\lesssim 0.036$. Such a violation leads to a constraint on $\\alpha \\lesssim\n80$. With this limiting value of the coupling, we find that present-day\nmagnetic field strength could be as high as $10^{-10}$ Gauss at Mpc scale,\nconsistent with observation.",

In this work, we address the challenge of\ngenerating photorealistic mirror reflections using diffusion-based generative\nmodels. Despite extensive training data, existing diffusion models frequently\noverlook the nuanced details crucial to authentic mirror reflections. Recent\napproaches have attempted to resolve this by creating synhetic datasets and\nframing reflection generation as an inpainting task; however, they struggle to\ngeneralize across different object orientations and positions relative to the\nmirror. Our method overcomes these limitations by introducing key augmentations\ninto the synthetic data pipeline: (1) random object positioning, (2) randomized\nrotations, and (3) grounding of objects, significantly enhancing generalization\nacross poses and placements. To further address spatial relationships and\nocclusions in scenes with multiple objects, we implement a strategy to pair\nobjects during dataset generation, resulting in a dataset robust enough to\nhandle these complex scenarios. Achieving generalization to real-world scenes\nremains a challenge, so we introduce a three-stage training curriculum to\ndevelop the MirrorFusion 2.0 model to improve real-world performance.

For nonlinear dynamics, the Iterative Linear\nQuadratic Regulator (iLQR) method is employed, which iteratively linearizes the\nsystem and solves a sequence of LQR problems to converge to an optimal policy.\n  To implement this approach, a software service was developed and tested on\nseveral canonical models, including: Rayleigh oscillator, inverted pendulum on\na moving cart, two-link manipulator, and quadcopter.

    "abstract": "CRES is a technique for precision measurements of kinetic energies of charged\nparticles, pioneered by the Project 8 experiment to measure the neutrino mass\nusing the tritium endpoint method. It was recently employed for the first time\nto measure the molecular tritium spectrum and place a limit on the neutrino\nmass using a cm$^3$-scale detector. Future direct neutrino mass experiments are\ndeveloping the technique to overcome the systematic and statistical limitations\nof current detectors. This paper describes one such approach, namely the use of\nantenna arrays for CRES in free space.

    "abstract": "Surrogate markers are most commonly studied within the context of randomized\nclinical trials. However, the need for alternative outcomes extends beyond\nthese settings and may be more pronounced in real-world public health and\nsocial science research, where randomized trials are often impractical.\nResearch on identifying surrogates in real-world non-randomized data is scarce,\nas available statistical approaches for evaluating surrogate markers tend to\nrely on the assumption that treatment is randomized. While the few methods that\nallow for non-randomized treatment/exposure appropriately handle confounding\nindividual characteristics, they do not offer a way to examine surrogate\nheterogeneity with respect to patient characteristics. In this paper, we\npropose a framework to assess surrogate heterogeneity in real-world, i.e.,\nnon-randomized, data and implement this framework using various meta-learners.\nOur approach allows us to quantify heterogeneity in surrogate strength with\nrespect to patient characteristics while accommodating confounders through the\nuse of flexible, off-the-shelf machine learning methods. In addition, we use\nour framework to identify individuals for whom the surrogate is a valid\nreplacement of the primary outcome. We examine the performance of our methods\nvia a simulation study and application to examine heterogeneity in the\nsurrogacy of hemoglobin A1c as a surrogate for fasting plasma glucose.",

    "abstract": "Hip fractures represent a major health concern, particularly among the\nelderly, often leading decreased mobility and increased mortality. Early and\naccurate detection of at risk individuals is crucial for effective\nintervention. In this study, we propose Iterative Cross Graph Matching for Hip\nFracture Risk Assessment (ICGM-FRAX), a novel approach for predicting hip\nfractures using Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) images. ICGM-FRAX\ninvolves iteratively comparing a test (subject) graph with multiple template\ngraphs representing the characteristics of hip fracture subjects to assess the\nsimilarity and accurately to predict hip fracture risk. These graphs are\nobtained as follows. The DXA images are separated into multiple regions of\ninterest (RoIs), such as the femoral head, shaft, and lesser trochanter.\nRadiomic features are then calculated for each RoI, with the central\ncoordinates used as nodes in a graph. The connectivity between nodes is\nestablished according to the Euclidean distance between these coordinates. This\nprocess transforms each DXA image into a graph, where each node represents a\nRoI, and edges derived by the centroids of RoIs capture the spatial\nrelationships between them. If the test graph closely matches a set of template\ngraphs representing subjects with incident hip fractures, it is classified as\nindicating high hip fracture risk. We evaluated our method using 547 subjects\nfrom the UK Biobank dataset, and experimental results show that ICGM-FRAX\nachieved a sensitivity of 0.9869, demonstrating high accuracy in predicting hip\nfractures.",

These\ncomposite objects behave as cold dark matter, interacting with ordinary matter\nand producing pervasive electromagnetic radiation. This work aims to calculate\nthe FUV electromagnetic signature in a 1 kpc region surrounding the solar\nsystem, resulting from the interaction between antimatter AQNs and baryons. To\nthis end, we use the high-resolution hydrodynamic simulation of the Milky Way,\nFIRE-2 Latter suite, to select solar system-like regions. From the simulated\ngas and dark matter distributions in these regions, we calculate the FUV\nbackground radiation generated by the AQN model. We find that the results are\nconsistent with the FUV excess recently confirmed by the Alice spectrograph\naboard New Horizons, which corroborated the FUV excess initially discovered by\nGALEX a decade ago.

We divide our sample of 54 z~1.6 cluster galaxies,\nderived from the Spitzer Adaptation of the Red-Sequence Cluster Survey, into 9\ngroupings, for which we recover detections in 8. The average gas content of the\nfull cluster galaxy population is similar to coeval field galaxies matched in\nstellar mass and star formation rate. However, when further split by\nCO-undetected and CO-detected, we find that galaxies below the SFMS have\nstatistically different gas fractions from the field scaling relations,\nspanning deficiencies to enhancements from 2sigma below to 3sigma above the\nexpected field gas fractions, respectively. These differences between z=1.6\ncluster and field galaxies below the SFMS are likely due to environmental\nprocesses, though further investigation of spatially-resolved properties and\nmore robust field scaling relation calibration in this parameter space are\nrequired.",

    "abstract": "Context. Extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) observations have revealed small-scale\ntransient brightenings that may share common physical mechanisms with\nlarger-scale solar flares. A notable feature of solar and stellar flares is the\npresence of quasi-periodic pulsations (QPPs), which are considered a common and\npotentially intrinsic characteristic. Aims. We investigate the properties of\nQPPs detected in EUV brightenings, which are considered small-scale flares, and\ncompare their statistical properties with those observed in solar and stellar\nflares. Methods. We extracted integrated light curves of 22,623 EUV\nbrightenings in two quiet Sun regions observed by the Solar Orbiter/Extreme\nUltraviolet Imager and identified QPPs in their light curves using Fourier\nanalysis. Results. Approximately 2.7 % of the EUV brightenings exhibited\nstationary QPPs. The QPP occurrence rate increased with the surface area,\nlifetime, and peak brightness of the EUV brightenings. The detected QPP periods\nranged from approximately 15 to 260 seconds, which is comparable to the periods\nobserved in solar and stellar flares. Consistent with observations of QPPs in\nsolar and stellar flares, no correlation was found between the QPP period and\npeak brightness. However, unlike the trend observed in solar flares, no\ncorrelation was found between the QPP period and lifetime/length scale.\nConclusions. The presence of QPPs in EUV brightenings supports the\ninterpretation that these events may be small-scale manifestations of flares,\nand the absence of period scaling with loop length further suggests that\nstanding waves may not be the primary driver of QPPs in these events.",

    "abstract": "We introduce CameraBench, a large-scale dataset and benchmark designed to\nassess and improve camera motion understanding. CameraBench consists of ~3,000\ndiverse internet videos, annotated by experts through a rigorous multi-stage\nquality control process. One of our contributions is a taxonomy of camera\nmotion primitives, designed in collaboration with cinematographers. We find,\nfor example, that some motions like \"follow\" (or tracking) require\nunderstanding scene content like moving subjects. We conduct a large-scale\nhuman study to quantify human annotation performance, revealing that domain\nexpertise and tutorial-based training can significantly enhance accuracy. For\nexample, a novice may confuse zoom-in (a change of intrinsics) with translating\nforward (a change of extrinsics), but can be trained to differentiate the two.\nUsing CameraBench, we evaluate Structure-from-Motion (SfM) and Video-Language\nModels (VLMs), finding that SfM models struggle to capture semantic primitives\nthat depend on scene content, while VLMs struggle to capture geometric\nprimitives that require precise estimation of trajectories. We then fine-tune a\ngenerative VLM on CameraBench to achieve the best of both worlds and showcase\nits applications, including motion-augmented captioning, video question\nanswering, and video-text retrieval. We hope our taxonomy, benchmark, and\ntutorials will drive future efforts towards the ultimate goal of understanding\ncamera motions in any video.",

    "abstract": "Multiple correlation is a fundamental concept with broad applications. The\nclassical multiple correlation coefficient is developed to assess how strongly\na dependent variable is associated with a linear combination of independent\nvariables. To compute this coefficient, the dependent variable must be chosen\nin advance. In many applications, however, it is difficult and even infeasible\nto specify the dependent variable, especially when some variables of interest\nare equally important. To overcome this difficulty, we propose a new\ncoefficient of multiple correlation which (a) does not require the\nspecification of the dependent variable, (b) has a simple formula and shares\nconnections with the classical correlation coefficients, (c) consistently\nmeasures the linear correlation between continuous variables, which is 0 if and\nonly if variables are uncorrelated and 1 if and only if one variable is a\nlinear function of others, and (d) has an asymptotic distribution which can be\nused for hypothesis testing. We study the asymptotic behavior of the sample\ncoefficient under mild regularity conditions. Given that the asymptotic bias of\nthe sample coefficient is not negligible when the data dimension and the sample\nsize are comparable, we propose a bias-corrected estimator that consistently\nperforms well in such cases. Moreover, we develop an efficient strategy for\nmaking inferences on multiple correlation based on either the limiting\ndistribution or the resampling methods and the stochastic approximation Monte\nCarlo algorithm, depending on whether the regularity assumptions are valid or\nnot. Theoretical and numerical studies demonstrate that our coefficient\nprovides a useful tool for evaluating multiple correlation in practice.",

To tackle these challenges,\nresearchers have proposed techniques like client sampling and update\ncompression.

With our ground-based\nobservations and photometric constraints from space-based observations, we\nsuggest that the primary Logos is likely a close/contact binary whose\nrotational period is 17.43$\\pm$0.06 h for a lightcurve amplitude of\n0.70$\\pm$0.07 mag while Zoe is potentially a (very) slow rotator with an\nunknown shape. Using the Candela software, we model the Logos-Zoe system and\npredict its upcoming mutual events season using rotational, physical, and\nmutual orbit parameters derived in this work or already published. Zoe's shape\nand rotational period are still uncertain, so we consider various options to\nbetter understand Zoe. The upcoming mutual event season for Logos-Zoe starts in\n2026 and will last for four years with up to two events per year. Observations\nof these mutual events will allow us to significantly improve the physical and\nrotational properties of both Logos and Zoe.",

    "abstract": "Recent reasoning models through test-time scaling have demonstrated that long\nchain-of-thoughts can unlock substantial performance boosts in hard reasoning\ntasks such as math and code. However, the benefit of such long thoughts for\nsystem-2 reasoning is relatively less explored in other domains such as\nperceptual tasks where shallower, system-1 reasoning seems sufficient. In this\npaper, we introduce LongPerceptualThoughts, a new synthetic dataset with 30K\nlong-thought traces for perceptual tasks. The key challenges in synthesizing\nelaborate reasoning thoughts for perceptual tasks are that off-the-shelf models\nare not yet equipped with such thinking behavior and that it is not\nstraightforward to build a reliable process verifier for perceptual tasks.\nThus, we propose a novel three-stage data synthesis framework that first\nsynthesizes verifiable multiple-choice questions from dense image descriptions,\nthen extracts simple CoTs from VLMs for those verifiable problems, and finally\nexpands those simple thoughts to elaborate long thoughts via frontier reasoning\nmodels. In controlled experiments with a strong instruction-tuned 7B model, we\ndemonstrate notable improvements over existing visual reasoning data-generation\nmethods. Our model, trained on the generated dataset, achieves an average +3.4\npoints improvement over 5 vision-centric benchmarks, including +11.8 points on\nV$^*$ Bench. Notably, despite being tuned for vision tasks, it also improves\nperformance on the text reasoning benchmark, MMLU-Pro, by +2 points.",

We\nreport the serendipitous identification of an isolated merging dwarf system\nwith a total stellar mass of M$_{\\rm \\star}$$\\sim$10$^{9.7}$M$_{\\rm \\odot}$,\nlocated in the centre of a cosmic void. This system is one of the rare\nexamples, and possibly the first, of merging dwarf galaxy pairs studied within\nthe central region of a cosmic void. Using CAVITY PPAK-IFU data combined with\ndeep optical broadband imaging from the Isaac Newton Telescope, we analysed the\nkinematics and ionized gas properties of each dwarf galaxy in the system by\nemploying a full spectral fitting technique. The orientation of this merging\npair relative to the line of sight allowed us to determine the dynamical mass\nof each component, showing that both had similar dynamical masses within\ngalactocentric distances of up to 2.9 kpc. While the gas-phase metallicity of\nboth components is consistent with that of star-forming dwarf galaxies, the\nstar formation rates observed in both components exceed those typically\nreported for equally massive star-forming dwarf galaxies. This indicates that\nthe merger has presumably contributed to enhancing star formation. Furthermore,\nwe found no significant difference in the optical g-r colour of this merging\npair compared to other merging dwarf pairs across different environments. While\nmost merging events occur in group-like environments with high galaxy density\nand the tidal influence of a host halo, and isolated mergers typically involve\ngalaxies with significant mass differences, the identified merging pair does\nnot follow these patterns. We speculate that the global dynamics of the void or\npast three-body encounters involving components of this pair and a nearby dwarf\ngalaxy might have triggered this merging event.",

In this work, we present multi-configuration ALMA observations\nof [CII]$\\lambda158\\mu$m and millimetre continuum emission in the $z\\sim6.4$\nquasar PSOJ183+05. We find clumpy [CII] emission, tracing gas up to a $\\sim6$\nkpc radius, consistent with the interface region between the interstellar\nmedium (ISM) and CGM.

These findings\nsuggest that quasar-driven outflows can rapidly transfer energy and momentum to\nthe CGM, without immediately quenching star formation in the host galaxy ISM.\nThis supports a delayed feedback scenario, in which outflows reshape CGM\nconditions and regulate future gas accretion over longer timescales. We find\nthat neither the high-velocity component nor the extended CGM emission in\nPSOJ183+05 are recovered when using the high-resolution dataset alone, which\nmay explain the conflicting results reported regarding [CII] sizes and the\ndetection of outflows at $z\\gtrsim6$.

    "abstract": "The two-layer quasi-geostrophic equations (2QGE) serve as a simplified model\nfor simulating wind-driven, stratified ocean flows. However, their numerical\nsimulation remains computationally expensive due to the need for\nhigh-resolution meshes to capture a wide range of turbulent scales. This\nbecomes especially problematic when several simulations need to be run because\nof, e.g., uncertainty in the parameter settings. To address this challenge, we\npropose a data-driven reduced order model (ROM) for the 2QGE that leverages\nrandomized proper orthogonal decomposition (rPOD) and long short-term memory\n(LSTM) networks. To efficiently generate the snapshot data required for model\nconstruction, we apply a nonlinear filtering stabilization technique that\nallows for the use of larger mesh sizes compared to a direct numerical\nsimulations (DNS). Thanks to the use of rPOD to extract the dominant modes from\nthe snapshot matrices, we achieve up to 700 times speedup over the use of\ndeterministic POD. LSTM networks are trained with the modal coefficients\nassociated with the snapshots to enable the prediction of the time- and\nparameter-dependent modal coefficients during the online phase, which is\nhundreds of thousands of time faster than a DNS. We assess the accuracy and\nefficiency of our rPOD-LSTM ROM through an extension of a well-known benchmark\ncalled double-gyre wind forcing test. The dimension of the parameter space in\nthis test is increased from two to four.",

Recent cosmological\nanalyses suggest a bimodal posterior for the coupling strength $G_{\\rm eff}$,\nfavoring either strong or moderate interactions. These interactions modify the\nscale-dependence of the growth of cosmic structures, leaving distinct imprints\non the matter power spectrum at small scales, $k\\,>\\,0.1\\,{\\rm Mpc}^{-1}$. For\nthe first time, we explore how the 21-cm power spectrum from the cosmic dawn\nand the dark ages can constrain the properties of self-interacting, massive\nneutrinos. The effects of small-scale suppression and enhancement in the matter\npower spectrum caused by self-interacting neutrinos propagate to the halo mass\nfunction, shaping the abundance of small- and intermediate-mass halos. It is\nprecisely these halos that host the galaxies responsible for driving the\nevolution of the 21-cm signal during the cosmic dawn. We find that HERA at its\ndesign sensitivity can improve upon existing constraints on $G_{\\rm eff}$ and\nbe sensitive to small values of the coupling, beyond the reach of current and\nfuture CMB experiments. Crucially, we find that the combination of HERA and\nCMB-S4 can break parameter degeneracies, significantly improving the\nsensitivity to $G_{\\rm eff}$ over either experiment alone. Finally, we\ninvestigate the prospects of probing neutrino properties with futuristic Lunar\ninterferometers, accessing the astrophysics-free 21-cm power spectrum during\nthe dark ages. The capability of probing small scales of these instruments will\nallow us to reach a percent-level constraint on the neutrino self-coupling.",

The inclusion of morphological information\ntightens these correlations: attenuation correlates more strongly with stellar\nmass and SFR surface densities than with the global quantities. The Balmer\ndecrement-derived nebular attenuation for 67 of these galaxies shows consistent\ntrends with the stellar continuum attenuation.

We investigate the role of\nviscosity in modulating turbulence and radiative cooling in turbulent radiative\nmixing layers (TRMLs). In particular, we aim to determine how different amounts\nof viscosity affect the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI), turbulence\nevolution, and the efficiency of gas mixing and cooling. Using idealized 2D\nnumerical setups, we compute the critical viscosity required to suppress the\nKHI in shear flows characterized by different density contrasts and Mach\nnumbers. These results are then used in a 3D shear layer setup to explore the\nimpact of viscosity on cooling efficiency and turbulence across different\ncooling regimes. We find that the critical viscosity follows the expected\ndependence on overdensity and Mach number. Our viscous TRMLs simulations show\ndifferent behaviors in the weak and strong cooling regimes. In the weak cooling\nregime, viscosity has a strong impact, resulting in laminar flows and breaking\npreviously established inviscid relations between cooling and turbulence\n(albeit leaving the total luminosity unaffected). However, in the strong\ncooling regime, when cooling timescales are shorter than viscous timescales,\nkey scaling relations in TRMLs remain largely intact. In this regime -- which\nmust hold for gas to remain multiphase -- radiative losses dominate, and the\nsystem effectively behaves as non-viscous regardless of the actual level of\nviscosity.

    "abstract": "Several enigmatic dusty sources have been detected in the central parsec of\nthe Galactic Center. Among them is X7, located at only $\\sim$0.02 pc from the\ncentral super-massive black hole, Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*). Recent observations\nhave shown that it is becoming elongated due to the tidal forces of Sgr A*. X7\nis expected to be fully disrupted during its pericenter passage around 2035\nwhich might impact the accretion rate of Sgr A*. However, its origin and nature\nare still unknown. We investigated the tidal interaction of X7 with Sgr A* in\norder to constrain its origin. We tested the hypothesis that X7 was produced by\none of the observed stars with constrained dynamical properties in the vicinity\nof Sgr A*. We employed a set of test-particle simulations to reproduce the\nobserved structure and dynamics of X7. The initial conditions of the models\nwere obtained by extrapolating the observationally constrained orbits of X7 and\nthe known stars into the past, making it possible to find the time and source\nof origin by minimizing the three-dimensional separation and velocity\ndifference between them. Our results show that ejecta from the star S33/S0-30,\nlaunched in $\\sim$1950, can to a large extent, replicate the observed dynamics\nand structure of X7, provided that it is initially elongated with a velocity\ngradient across it, and with an initial maximum speed of $\\sim$600~km~s$^{-1}$.\nOur results show that a grazing collision between the star S33/S0-30 and a\nfield object such as a stellar mass black hole or a Jupiter-mass object is a\nviable scenario to explain the origin of X7. Nevertheless, such encounters are\nrare based on the observed stellar dynamics within the central parsec.",

    "abstract": "We construct the canonical ensemble of a $d$-dimensional Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om\nblack hole spacetime in a cavity surrounded by a heat reservoir through the\nEuclidean path integral formalism. The heat reservoir is described by the\nboundary of the cavity with fixed radius $R$, fixed temperature $T$, and fixed\nelectric charge $Q$. We use York's approach to find the reduced action, and\nthen perform a zero loop approximation. We find that the number of solutions\nfor the black hole depends on the electric charge being smaller or larger than\na critical $Q_s$, having two stable and one unstable solutions for the former\ncase, and one stable solution for the latter. We obtain the system's\nthermodynamic properties from the partition function. We analyze thermodynamic\nstability, controlled by the positivity of the heat capacity at constant area\nand electric charge. We show that there is a discontinuity in the heat\ncapacity, signaling a turning point. We investigate the favorable stable phases\nand the phase diagram of the system. We show that the two stable black hole\nsolutions can suffer a first order phase transition from one to the other, and\nat the critical charge $Q_s$ this turns into a second order one. We introduce a\nmodel of charged hot flat space, i.e., hot flat space with charge near the\nboundary. We find that a first order phase transition between the large stable\nblack hole and charged hot flat space occurs at a horizon radius larger than\nthe Buchdahl bound, and comment on the physics. Finally, we recover the Davies\nthermodynamic solutions and a Rindler solution in the limit of infinite cavity,\nand the York solutions in the limit of zero charge. Hence, both York and Davies\nformalisms are unified and connected in our approach. In all instances we\nmention carefully the four-dimensional case, for which we accomplish new\nresults, and study in detail all aspects of the five-dimensional case.",

As the ejecta density decreases during expansion, the plasma\nbecomes collisionless, with particle motion governed by electromagnetic forces.\nIn such environments, strong or turbulent magnetic fields are thought to\nconfine particles, though the origin of these fields and the confinement\nmechanism have remained unclear.

Traditionally, most SAMs calibrate\nthese parameters manually to match observational data. However, this approach\nfails to fully explore the multidimensional parameter space, resulting in\nlimited robustness and inconsistency with some observations. In contrast, the\nL-Galaxies SAM features a unique Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) mode, enabling\nrobust model calibration. Using this functionality, we address a long-standing\ntension in galaxy formation models: simultaneously reproducing the number\ndensities of dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) and high-redshift massive\nquiescent galaxies (MQs). We test nine combinations of observational\nconstraints - including stellar mass functions, quiescent fractions, neutral\nhydrogen mass functions, and DSFG number densities - across different\nredshifts. We then analyze the resulting galaxy property predictions and\ndiscuss the underlying physical mechanisms. Our results identify a model that\nreasonably matches the number density of DSFGs while remaining consistent with\nobservationally-derived lower limits on the number density of high-redshift\nMQs. This model requires high star formation efficiencies in mergers and a null\ndependency of supermassive black hole (SMBH) cold gas accretion on halo mass,\nfacilitating rapid stellar mass and SMBH growth. Additionally, our findings\nhighlight the importance of robust calibration procedures to address the\nsignificant degeneracies inherent to multidimensional galaxy formation models.",

In this paper, we identify the main cause of PRM-induced reward\nhacking: the canonical summation-form credit assignment in reinforcement\nlearning (RL), which defines the value as cumulative gamma-decayed future\nrewards, easily induces LLMs to hack steps with high rewards. To address this,\nwe propose PURE: Process sUpervised Reinforcement lEarning. The key innovation\nof PURE is a min-form credit assignment that formulates the value function as\nthe minimum of future rewards. This method significantly alleviates reward\nhacking by limiting the value function range and distributing advantages more\nreasonably. Through extensive experiments on 3 base models, we show that\nPRM-based approaches enabling min-form credit assignment achieve comparable\nreasoning performance to verifiable reward-based methods within only 30% steps.\nIn contrast, the canonical sum-form credit assignment collapses training even\nat the beginning! Additionally, when we supplement PRM-based fine-tuning with\njust 10% verifiable rewards, we further alleviate reward hacking and produce\nthe best fine-tuned model based on Qwen2.5-Math-7B in our experiments,\nachieving 82.5% accuracy on AMC23 and 53.3% average accuracy across 5\nbenchmarks. Moreover, we summarize the observed reward hacking cases and\nanalyze the causes of training collapse. Code and models are available at\nhttps://github.com/CJReinforce/PURE.",

    "abstract": "In modern clinical trials, there is immense pressure to use surrogate markers\nin place of an expensive or long-term primary outcome to make more timely\ndecisions about treatment effectiveness. However, using a surrogate marker to\ntest for a treatment effect can be difficult and controversial. Existing\nmethods tend to either rely on fully parametric methods where strict\nassumptions are made about the relationship between the surrogate and the\noutcome, or assume the surrogate marker is valid for the entire study\npopulation. In this paper, we develop a fully nonparametric method for\nefficient testing using surrogate information (ETSI). Our approach is\nspecifically designed for settings where there is heterogeneity in the utility\nof the surrogate marker, i.e., the surrogate is valid for certain patient\nsubgroups and not others. ETSI enables treatment effect estimation and\nhypothesis testing via kernel-based estimation for a setting where the\nsurrogate is used in place of the primary outcome for individuals for whom the\nsurrogate is valid, and the primary outcome is purposefully only measured in\nthe remaining patients. In addition, we provide a framework for future study\ndesign with power and sample size estimates based on our proposed testing\nprocedure. We demonstrate the performance of our methods via a simulation study\nand application to two distinct HIV clinical trials.",

We use the\nGCR scheme to design parametric two-qutrit gates, namely, $U_{CR}^{01}$ and\n$U_{CR}^{12}$, that act on the $0{-}1$ and $1{-}2$ energy transitions of\ntransmons. Our gates improve upon the existing works in two aspects. First, our\ngates directly allow for entanglement on the $1{-}2$ levels rather than merely\nrelying on $0{-}1$ entanglement, as in previous works. Second, our gates are\nparametric in nature, enabling us to construct multiple entangling gates of\ninterest, whereas the purview of prior works that use cross-resonance for\nqutrits was limited to individual gates. Using numerical simulation in Qiskit\nDynamics, we demonstrate two-qutrit generalized controlled-$X$ ($U_{CX}^{01}$\nand $U_{CX}^{12}$) and controlled-$H$ ($U_{CH}^{01}$ and $U_{CH}^{12}$) gates,\nwhich are instances of the proposed $U_{CR}$ gates, with reported gate\nfidelities of $99.73\\pm 0.01\\%, 97.88\\pm 0.01\\%, 99.39\\pm 0.01\\%$, and\n$98.99\\pm 0.01\\%$, respectively.

In this paper, we study\nthe following Ramsey version of these problems. Given a set $L\\subseteq\n\\{0,\\dots,k-1\\}$ and a family $\\mathcal{F}$ of $k$-element sets which does not\ncontain a sunflower with $m$ petals whose kernel size is in $L$, how large a\nsubfamily of $\\mathcal{F}$ can we find in which no pair has intersection size\nin $L$? We give matching upper and lower bounds, determining the dependence on\n$m$ for all $k$ and $L$. This problem also finds applications in quantum\ncomputing.\n  As an application of our techniques, we also obtain a variant of F\\\"uredi's\ncelebrated semilattice lemma, which is a key tool in the powerful delta-system\nmethod. We prove that one cannot remove the double-exponential dependency on\nthe uniformity in F\\\"uredi's result, however, we provide an alternative with\nsignificantly better, single-exponential dependency on the parameters, which is\nstill strong enough for most applications of the delta-system method.",

    "abstract": "Weak gravitational lensing is the slight distortion of galaxy shapes caused\nprimarily by the gravitational effects of dark matter in the universe. In our\nwork, we seek to invert the weak lensing signal from 2D telescope images to\nreconstruct a 3D map of the universe's dark matter field. While inversion\ntypically yields a 2D projection of the dark matter field, accurate 3D maps of\nthe dark matter distribution are essential for localizing structures of\ninterest and testing theories of our universe. However, 3D inversion poses\nsignificant challenges. First, unlike standard 3D reconstruction that relies on\nmultiple viewpoints, in this case, images are only observed from a single\nviewpoint. This challenge can be partially addressed by observing how galaxy\nemitters throughout the volume are lensed. However, this leads to the second\nchallenge: the shapes and exact locations of unlensed galaxies are unknown, and\ncan only be estimated with a very large degree of uncertainty. This introduces\nan overwhelming amount of noise which nearly drowns out the lensing signal\ncompletely. Previous approaches tackle this by imposing strong assumptions\nabout the structures in the volume. We instead propose a methodology using a\ngravitationally-constrained neural field to flexibly model the continuous\nmatter distribution. We take an analysis-by-synthesis approach, optimizing the\nweights of the neural network through a fully differentiable physical forward\nmodel to reproduce the lensing signal present in image measurements. We\nshowcase our method on simulations, including realistic simulated measurements\nof dark matter distributions that mimic data from upcoming telescope surveys.\nOur results show that our method can not only outperform previous methods, but\nimportantly is also able to recover potentially surprising dark matter\nstructures.",

    "abstract": "Objective: Healthcare data fragmentation presents a major challenge for\nlinking patient data, necessitating robust record linkage to integrate patient\nrecords from diverse sources. This study investigates the feasibility of\nleveraging language models for automated patient record linkage, focusing on\ntwo key tasks: blocking and matching. Materials and Methods: We utilized\nreal-world healthcare data from the Missouri Cancer Registry and Research\nCenter, linking patient records from two independent sources using\nprobabilistic linkage as a baseline. A transformer-based model, RoBERTa, was\nfine-tuned for blocking using sentence embeddings. For matching, several\nlanguage models were experimented under fine-tuned and zero-shot settings,\nassessing their performance against ground truth labels. Results: The\nfine-tuned blocking model achieved a 92% reduction in the number of candidate\npairs while maintaining near-perfect recall. In the matching task, fine-tuned\nMistral-7B achieved the best performance with only 6 incorrect predictions.\nAmong zero-shot models, Mistral-Small-24B performed best, with a total of 55\nincorrect predictions. Discussion: Fine-tuned language models achieved strong\nperformance in patient record blocking and matching with minimal errors.\nHowever, they remain less accurate and efficient than a hybrid rule-based and\nprobabilistic approach for blocking. Additionally, reasoning models like\nDeepSeek-R1 are impractical for large-scale record linkage due to high\ncomputational costs. Conclusion: This study highlights the potential of\nlanguage models for automating patient record linkage, offering improved\nefficiency by eliminating the manual efforts required to perform patient record\nlinkage. Overall, language models offer a scalable solution that can enhance\ndata integration, reduce manual effort, and support disease surveillance and\nresearch.",

To this end, this\npaper focuses on jointly addressing three core issues of power allocation,\nknowledge base caching (KBC), and device-to-device (D2D) user pairing (DUP) in\nsecure SemCom networks. We first develop a novel performance metric, namely\nsemantic secrecy throughput (SST), to quantify the information security level\nthat can be achieved at each pair of D2D SemCom users. Next, an SST\nmaximization problem is formulated subject to secure SemCom-related delay and\nreliability constraints.

Simulation results demonstrate our proposed solution nearly doubles the\nSST performance and realizes less than half of the queuing delay performance\ncompared to different benchmarks.",

Verifying\nthis hypothesis is critical, yet challenging; outshining, wherein light from\nyoung stars dominates the spectral energy distribution, represents perhaps the\ngreatest challenge in inferring the formation histories of unresolved galaxies.\nIn this paper, we take a simple model of burstiness and show that\nstate-of-the-art inference methods with flexible star formation histories\n(SFHs) and neutral priors, while recovering average star formation rates (SFRs;\n$\\sim0.1$ dex median offset), fail to recover the complexities of fluctuations\non tens of Myr timescales, and typically underestimate masses in bursty systems\n($\\sim0.15$ dex). Surprisingly, detailed SFH recovery is still sensitive to\npriors even when data quality is optimal, e.g., including high signal-to-noise\n($\\rm20~pixel^{-1}$) spectroscopy with wide coverage (rest-frame\n$0.12-1.06~\\mu$m). Crucially, however, refitting the same data with a prior\ncorrectly encoding the bursty expectation eliminates these biases: median\noffsets in mass and SFRs decrease to $\\sim 0.04$ dex and $\\sim 0.05$ dex,\nrespectively. Under the assumption that current population burstiness predicts\npast SFH, the solution to outshining in modeling statistical samples is\nempirically measuring recent galaxy SFHs with population modeling. A prototype\nis H$\\alpha$/UV: while helpful, it is insufficient to constrain the expected\ncomplex burstiness. To this end, we introduce a more complete, quantitative\npopulation-level approach and demonstrate that it promises to recover the\ntypical amplitude, timescale, and slope of the recent SFH to high accuracy.\nThis approach thus has the strong potential to solve outshining using\nobservations from JWST.",

To circumvent this exponential lower bound on the number of\ncomponents, research has focused on learning families of GMMs satisfying\nadditional structural properties. A natural assumption posits that the\ncomponent weights are not exponentially small and that the components have the\nsame unknown covariance. Recent work gave a $d^{O(\\log(1/w_{\\min}))}$-time\nalgorithm for this class of GMMs, where $w_{\\min}$ is the minimum weight. Our\nfirst main result is a Statistical Query (SQ) lower bound showing that this\nquasi-polynomial upper bound is essentially best possible, even for the special\ncase of uniform weights. Specifically, we show that it is SQ-hard to\ndistinguish between such a mixture and the standard Gaussian.

Furthermore, in the\n\\textsc{Hestia} simulation suite, we find that coronal gas is ubiquitous in all\nhalos with $M_{\\rm halo} > 10^{11} M_{\\odot}$, implying that massive dwarfs\ngenerically develop extended gaseous envelopes prior to accretion.

While some\nvalues appear consistently across contexts (e.g. \"transparency\"), many are more\nspecialized and context-dependent, reflecting the diversity of human\ninterlocutors and their varied contexts. For example, \"harm prevention\" emerges\nwhen Claude resists users, \"historical accuracy\" when responding to queries\nabout controversial events, \"healthy boundaries\" when asked for relationship\nadvice, and \"human agency\" in technology ethics discussions.

Existing methods commonly\nemploy the thin plate spline (TPS) transformation or appearance flow to deform\nin-shop clothing for aligning with the person's body. Despite their promising\nperformance, these methods often lack precise control over fine details,\nleading to inconsistencies in shape between clothing and the person's body as\nwell as distortions in exposed limb regions. To tackle these challenges, we\npropose a novel shape-guided clothing warping method for virtual try-on, dubbed\nSCW-VTON, which incorporates global shape constraints and additional limb\ntextures to enhance the realism and consistency of the warped clothing and\ntry-on results. To integrate global shape constraints for clothing warping, we\ndevise a dual-path clothing warping module comprising a shape path and a flow\npath. The former path captures the clothing shape aligned with the person's\nbody, while the latter path leverages the mapping between the pre- and\npost-deformation of the clothing shape to guide the estimation of appearance\nflow. Furthermore, to alleviate distortions in limb regions of try-on results,\nwe integrate detailed limb guidance by developing a limb reconstruction network\nbased on masked image modeling. Through the utilization of SCW-VTON, we are\nable to generate try-on results with enhanced clothing shape consistency and\nprecise control over details.

    "abstract": "A fundamental question in cosmology is whether dark energy evolves over time,\na topic that has gained prominence since the discovery of cosmic acceleration.\nRecently, the DESI collaboration has reported increasing evidence for evolving\ndark energy using combinations of cosmic microwave background (CMB), type Ia\nsupernova (SN), and their new measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations\n(BAO). However, our analysis reveals that these combinations are problematic\ndue to clear tensions among the CMB, BAO and SN datasets. Consequently, DESI's\nclaim of dynamical dark energy (DDE) is not robust. A more reliable approach\ninvolves constraining the evolution of dark energy using each dataset\nindependently. Through a statistical comparison for each dataset, on average,\nwe find that DDE is strongly preferred over the $\\Lambda$CDM model. This\nsuggests that DDE likely exists, although its real parameter space remains\nelusive due to weak constraints on the dark energy equation of state and\ninconsistencies among the datasets. Interestingly, when considering DDE, none\nof the individual datasets -- including CMB, DESI DR2, Pantheon+, Union3, and\nDESY5 -- can independently detect cosmic acceleration at a significant level.\nOur findings not only clarify the current understanding of the nature of dark\nenergy but also challenge the established discovery of cosmic acceleration and\nthe long-held notion that dark energy exerts negative pressure. Both individual\nand combined datasets suggest that the ultimate fate of the universe is likely\nto be dominated by matter rather than dark energy.",

    "abstract": "The Topics over Time (ToT) model captures thematic changes in timestamped\ndatasets by explicitly modeling publication dates jointly with word\nco-occurrence patterns. However, ToT was not approached in a fully Bayesian\nfashion, a flaw that makes it susceptible to stability problems. To address\nthis issue, we propose a fully Bayesian Topics over Time (BToT) model via the\nintroduction of a conjugate prior to the Beta distribution. This prior acts as\na regularization that prevents the online version of the algorithm from\nunstable updates when a topic is poorly represented in a mini-batch. The\ncharacteristics of this prior to the Beta distribution are studied here for the\nfirst time. Still, this model suffers from a difference in scale between the\nsingle-time observations and the multiplicity of words per document. A\nvariation of BToT, Weighted Bayesian Topics over Time (WBToT), is proposed as a\nsolution. In WBToT, publication dates are repeated a certain number of times\nper document, which balances the relative influence of words and timestamps\nalong the inference process. We have tested our models on two datasets: a\ncollection of over 200 years of US state-of-the-union (SOTU) addresses and a\nlarge-scale COVID-19 Twitter corpus of 10 million tweets. The results show that\nWBToT captures events better than Latent Dirichlet Allocation and other SOTA\ntopic models like BERTopic: the median absolute deviation of the topic presence\nover time is reduced by $51\\%$ and $34\\%$, respectively. Our experiments also\ndemonstrate the superior coherence of WBToT over BToT, which highlights the\nimportance of balancing the time and word modalities. Finally, we illustrate\nthe stability of the online optimization algorithm in WBToT, which allows the\napplication of WBToT to problems that are intractable for standard ToT.",

Our experiments demonstrate that the\ngrounded criteria produced by EvalAgent are often implicit (not directly stated\nin the user's prompt), yet specific (high degree of lexical precision).\nFurther, EvalAgent criteria are often not satisfied by initial responses but\nthey are actionable, such that responses can be refined to satisfy them.\nFinally, we show that combining LLM-generated and EvalAgent criteria uncovers\nmore human-valued criteria than using LLMs alone.",

Compared with traditional reinforcement learning with human feedback\n(RLHF) or pairwise preference approaches such as direct preference optimization\n(DPO), DRAGON is more flexible. It can optimize reward functions that evaluate\neither individual examples or distributions of them, making it compatible with\na broad spectrum of instance-wise, instance-to-distribution, and\ndistribution-to-distribution rewards. Leveraging this versatility, we construct\nnovel reward functions by selecting an encoder and a set of reference examples\nto create an exemplar distribution. When cross-modality encoders such as CLAP\nare used, the reference examples may be of a different modality (e.g., text\nversus audio). Then, DRAGON gathers online and on-policy generations, scores\nthem to construct a positive demonstration set and a negative set, and\nleverages the contrast between the two sets to maximize the reward. For\nevaluation, we fine-tune an audio-domain text-to-music diffusion model with 20\ndifferent reward functions, including a custom music aesthetics model, CLAP\nscore, Vendi diversity, and Frechet audio distance (FAD). We further compare\ninstance-wise (per-song) and full-dataset FAD settings while ablating multiple\nFAD encoders and reference sets.

    "abstract": "The monitoring of water quality is a crucial part of environmental\nprotection, and a large number of monitors are widely deployed to monitor water\nquality. Due to unavoidable factors such as data acquisition breakdowns,\nsensors and communication failures, water quality monitoring data suffers from\nmissing values over time, resulting in High-Dimensional and Sparse (HDS) Water\nQuality Data (WQD). The simple and rough filling of the missing values leads to\ninaccurate results and affects the implementation of relevant measures.\nTherefore, this paper proposes a Causal convolutional Low-rank Representation\n(CLR) model for imputing missing WQD to improve the completeness of the WQD,\nwhich employs a two-fold idea: a) applying causal convolutional operation to\nconsider the temporal dependence of the low-rank representation, thus\nincorporating temporal information to improve the imputation accuracy; and b)\nimplementing a hyperparameters adaptation scheme to automatically adjust the\nbest hyperparameters during model training, thereby reducing the tedious manual\nadjustment of hyper-parameters. Experimental studies on three real-world water\nquality datasets demonstrate that the proposed CLR model is superior to some of\nthe existing state-of-the-art imputation models in terms of imputation accuracy\nand time cost, as well as indicating that the proposed model provides more\nreliable decision support for environmental monitoring.",

We introduce a novel, fully empirical Freedman-type\nmartingale concentration inequality that tightens existing bounds by accounting\nfor the variance of the loss function. This generalization bound can be\ndecomposed into three interpretable components: the number of parameters per\ntoken, the loss variance, and the quantization error at a fixed bitrate. As\ncompute-optimal language models are scaled up, the number of parameters per\ndata point remains constant; however, both the loss variance and the\nquantization error decrease, implying that larger models should have smaller\ngeneralization gaps. We examine why larger models tend to be more quantizable\nfrom an information theoretic perspective, showing that the rate at which they\ncan integrate new information grows more slowly than their capacity on the\ncompute-optimal frontier. From these findings we produce a scaling law for the\ngeneralization gap, with bounds that become predictably stronger with scale.",

We\nfind that multiaccuracy in itself is rather weak, but that the addition of\nglobal calibration (this notion is called calibrated multiaccuracy) boosts its\npower substantially, enough to recover implications that were previously known\nonly assuming the stronger notion of multicalibration.\n  We give evidence that multiaccuracy might not be as powerful as standard weak\nagnostic learning, by showing that there is no way to post-process a\nmultiaccurate predictor to get a weak learner, even assuming the best\nhypothesis has correlation $1/2$. Rather, we show that it yields a restricted\nform of weak agnostic learning, which requires some concept in the class to\nhave correlation greater than $1/2$ with the labels. However, by also requiring\nthe predictor to be calibrated, we recover not just weak, but strong agnostic\nlearning.\n  A similar picture emerges when we consider the derivation of hardcore\nmeasures from predictors satisfying multigroup fairness notions. On the one\nhand, while multiaccuracy only yields hardcore measures of density half the\noptimal, we show that (a weighted version of) calibrated multiaccuracy achieves\noptimal density.\n  Our results yield new insights into the complementary roles played by\nmultiaccuracy and calibration in each setting.

The quantum circuit is simple, consisting of only one\nancillary qubit and a sequence of controlled-$U$ interleaved with single qubit\n$Y$ rotations, whose angles are given by a simple analytical formula. Quantum\nphase discrimination could become a fundamental subroutine in other quantum\nalgorithms, as we present two applications to quantum search on graphs:\n  i) Spatial search on graphs. Inspired by the structure of QPD, we propose a\nnew quantum walk model, and based on them we tackle the spatial search problem,\nobtaining a novel quantum search algorithm. For any graph with any number of\nmarked vertices, the quantum algorithm that can find a marked vertex with\nprobability $\\Omega(1)$ in total evolution time $ O(\\frac{1}{\\lambda\n\\sqrt{\\varepsilon}})$ and query complexity $ O(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\varepsilon}})$,\nwhere $\\lambda$ is the gap between the zero and non-zero eigenvalues of the\ngraph Laplacian and $\\varepsilon$ is a lower bound on the proportion of marked\nvertices.\n  ii) Path-finding on graphs.} By using QPD, we reduce the query complexity of\na path-finding algorithm proposed by Li and Zur [arxiv: 2311.07372] from\n$\\tilde{O}(n^{11})$ to $\\tilde{O}(n^8)$, in a welded-tree circuit graph with\n$\\Theta(n2^n)$ vertices.\n  Besides these two applications, we argue that more quantum algorithms might\nbenefit from QPD.",

The process entails first\nsegmenting out the eczema region from the image and then measuring the severity\nof eczema in the segmented region. The state-of-the-art methods for automated\neczema diagnosis rely on deep neural networks such as convolutional neural\nnetwork (CNN) and have shown impressive performance in accurately measuring the\nseverity of eczema. However, these methods require massive volume of annotated\ndata to train which can be hard to obtain. In this paper, we propose a\nself-supervised learning framework for automated eczema diagnosis under limited\ntraining data regime. Our framework consists of two stages: i) Segmentation,\nwhere we use an in-context learning based algorithm called SegGPT for few-shot\nsegmentation of eczema region from the image; ii) Feature extraction and\nclassification, where we extract DINO features from the segmented regions and\nfeed it to a multi-layered perceptron (MLP) for 4-class classification of\neczema severity. When evaluated on a dataset of annotated \"in-the-wild\" eczema\nimages, we show that our method outperforms (Weighted F1: 0.67 $\\pm$ 0.01) the\nstate-of-the-art deep learning methods such as finetuned Resnet-18 (Weighted\nF1: 0.44 $\\pm$ 0.16) and Vision Transformer (Weighted F1: 0.40 $\\pm$ 0.22).

In general relativity, the phantom equation of state is unphysical.\nThus it is important to check whether phantom crossing is present in other\nphysically self-consistent models of dark energy that have equivalent evidence\nto the $w_0, w_a$ parametrization. We find that thawing quintessence with\nnonzero cosmic curvature can fit the recent data as well as $w_0, w_a$ in a\nflat background, based on both parametric and realistic scalar field\nevolutions. Although the realistic model does not allow $w<-1$, the\nparametrizations do allow it. However even if we allow $w<-1$ the data do not\nenforce phantom crossing.

First, current HLS hardware design benchmarks are outdated as they\ndo not cover modern machine learning (ML) applications, preventing the rigorous\ndevelopment of HLS tools on ML-focused hardware design. Second, existing HLS\ntools are outdated because they predominantly target individual accelerator\ndesigns and lack an architecture-oriented perspective to support common\nhardware module extraction and reuse, limiting their adaptability and broader\napplicability. Motivated by these two limitations, we propose ForgeBench, an\nML-focused benchmark suite with a hardware design auto-generation framework for\nnext-generation HLS tools. In addition to the auto-generation framework, we\nprovide two ready-to-use benchmark suites. The first contains over 6,000\nrepresentative ML HLS designs. We envision future HLS tools being\narchitecture-oriented, capable of automatically identifying common\ncomputational modules across designs, and supporting flexible dataflow and\ncontrol. Accordingly, the second benchmark suite includes ML HLS designs with\npossible resource sharing manually implemented to highlight the necessity of\narchitecture-oriented design, ensuring it is future-HLS ready.

Despite substantial progress in this\ndirection, the quality of LLM-generated hardware design still cannot meet the\nrequirements for practical deployment. In this work, we identify three critical\nchallenges hindering the development of LLM-assisted hardware design\ngeneration: 1) limited data availability, 2) varied data quality, 3) inadequate\ninference-time efficiency. To address these fundamental challenges, this paper\nintroduces a two-stage framework for AI-assisted hardware design by exploring\ndecentralized training and personalized inference. In the first stage, we\npropose to harness private domain design sources through a hierarchical\ndecentralized training mechanism that addresses data-sharing constraints. To\nmitigate the impact of low-quality data, we identify optimization opportunities\nin hardware generation tasks, using user-defined metrics for model aggregation.\nThe second stage focuses on client personalization to enhance both speed and\nquality. We introduce a new metric, Trueput, to analyze LLM-assisted hardware\ngeneration efficiency. To optimize Trueput, we implement personalized\ninference-time acceleration and customized sampling strategies. Evaluating both\nclassical and quantum benchmarks, our experimental results demonstrate that the\nproposed two-stage framework can significantly improve the model capability for\nhardware design generation. As orthogonal enhancements to existing methods, our\nframework can achieve $33\\% \\sim 50\\%$ semantic accuracy improvement and $2.3$\ntimes speedup, depending on the difficulty of the generation tasks.",

    "abstract": "In various phenomena such as pattern formation, neural firing in the brain\nand cell migration, interactions that can affect distant objects globally in\nspace can be observed. These interactions are referred to as nonlocal\ninteractions and are often modeled using spatial convolution with an\nappropriate integral kernel. Many evolution equations incorporating nonlocal\ninteractions have been proposed. In such equations, the behavior of the system\nand the patterns it generates can be controlled by modifying the shape of the\nintegral kernel. However, the presence of nonlocality poses challenges for\nmathematical analysis. To address these difficulties, we develop an\napproximation method that converts nonlocal effects into spatially local\ndynamics using reaction-diffusion systems. In this paper, we present an\napproximation method for nonlocal interactions in evolution equations based on\na linear sum of solutions to a reaction-diffusion system in high-dimensional\nEuclidean space up to three dimensions. The key aspect of this approach is\nidentifying a class of integral kernels that can be approximated by a linear\ncombination of specific Green functions in the case of high-dimensional spaces.\nThis enables us to demonstrate that any nonlocal interactions can be\napproximated by a linear sum of auxiliary diffusive substances. Our results\nestablish a connection between a broad class of nonlocal interactions and\ndiffusive chemical reactions in dynamical systems.",

The proposed method adapts implicit shock tracking\nmethods, originally developed to align mesh faces with solution\ndiscontinuities, to compress elements into viscous shocks and boundary layers,\nfunctioning as a novel approach to aggressive $r$-adaptation. This form of\n$r$-adaptation is achieved naturally as the minimizer of the enriched residual\nwith respect to the discrete flow variables and coordinates of the nodes of the\ngrid. Several innovations to the shock tracking optimization solver are\nproposed to ensure sufficient mesh compression at viscous features to render\nstabilization unnecessary, including residual weighting, step constraints and\nmodifications, and viscosity-based continuation. Finally, $p$-adaptivity is\nused to locally increase the polynomial degree with three clear benefits: (1)\nlessens the mesh compression requirements near shock waves and boundary layers,\n(2) reduces the error in regions where $r$-adaptivity is not sufficient with\nthe given grid topology, and (3) reduces computational cost by performing a\nmajority of the $r$-adaptivity iterations on the coarsest discretization. A\nseries of numerical experiments show the proposed method effectively resolves\nviscous, shock-dominated flows, including accurate prediction of heat flux\nprofiles produced by hypersonic flow over a cylinder, and compares favorably in\nterms of accuracy per degree of freedom to $h$-adaptation with a high-order\ndiscretization.",

To this end, we are\nthe first to introduce human preference alignment into Real-ISR, a technique\nthat has been successfully applied in Large Language Models and Text-to-Image\ntasks to effectively enhance the alignment of generated outputs with human\npreferences. Specifically, we introduce Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)\ninto Real-ISR to achieve alignment, where DPO serves as a general alignment\ntechnique that directly learns from the human preference dataset. Nevertheless,\nunlike high-level tasks, the pixel-level reconstruction objectives of Real-ISR\nare difficult to reconcile with the image-level preferences of DPO, which can\nlead to the DPO being overly sensitive to local anomalies, leading to reduced\ngeneration quality. To resolve this dichotomy, we propose Direct Semantic\nPreference Optimization (DSPO) to align instance-level human preferences by\nincorporating semantic guidance, which is through two strategies: (a) semantic\ninstance alignment strategy, implementing instance-level alignment to ensure\nfine-grained perceptual consistency, and (b) user description feedback\nstrategy, mitigating hallucinations through semantic textual feedback on\ninstance-level images.

Recent multi-modal approaches have shown promise in improving FFIA\nrobustness and efficiency. However, these methods face significant challenges\nwhen adapting to new fish species or environments due to catastrophic\nforgetting and the lack of suitable datasets. To address these limitations, we\nfirst introduce AV-CIL-FFIA, a new dataset comprising 81,932 labelled\naudio-visual clips capturing feeding intensities across six different fish\nspecies in real aquaculture environments. Then, we pioneer audio-visual class\nincremental learning (CIL) for FFIA and demonstrate through benchmarking on\nAV-CIL-FFIA that it significantly outperforms single-modality methods. Existing\nCIL methods rely heavily on historical data. Exemplar-based approaches store\nraw samples, creating storage challenges, while exemplar-free methods avoid\ndata storage but struggle to distinguish subtle feeding intensity variations\nacross different fish species. To overcome these limitations, we introduce\nHAIL-FFIA, a novel audio-visual class-incremental learning framework that\nbridges this gap with a prototype-based approach that achieves exemplar-free\nefficiency while preserving essential knowledge through compact feature\nrepresentations. Specifically, HAIL-FFIA employs hierarchical representation\nlearning with a dual-path knowledge preservation mechanism that separates\ngeneral intensity knowledge from fish-specific characteristics. Additionally,\nit features a dynamic modality balancing system that adaptively adjusts the\nimportance of audio versus visual information based on feeding behaviour\nstages.

Oscillations and multi-stability are particularly\nprevalent in gene regulation systems. None of the currently available\nstochastic models for population dynamics are accurate and computationally\nefficient for long-term predictions. A prominent model in this field, known as\nthe Linear Noise Approximation (LNA), is computationally efficient for tasks\nsuch as simulation, sensitivity analysis, and parameter estimation, still, it\nis only accurate for linear systems and short-time predictions. Other models\nmay achieve greater accuracy across a broader range of systems, but they\nsacrifice computational efficiency and analytical tractability.

We introduce a new\nframework that employs centre manifold theory, a classical concept in\nnon-linear dynamical systems. This approach allows us to identify simple,\nspecialised modifications to the LNA tailored to classes of qualitatively\nsimilar non-linear dynamical systems. With these modifications, the LNA can\nachieve accurate long-term predictions without compromising its computational\nefficiency.

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks face several challenges in hyperspectral image\nclassification, including high-dimensional data, sparse distribution of ground\nobjects, and spectral redundancy, which often lead to classification\noverfitting and limited generalization capability. To more efficiently adapt to\nground object distributions while extracting image features without introducing\nexcessive parameters and skipping redundant information, this paper proposes\nKANet based on an improved 3D-DenseNet model, consisting of 3D KAN Conv and an\nadaptive grid update mechanism. By introducing learnable univariate B-spline\nfunctions on network edges, specifically by flattening three-dimensional\nneighborhoods into vectors and applying B-spline-parameterized nonlinear\nactivation functions to replace the fixed linear weights of traditional 3D\nconvolutional kernels, we precisely capture complex spectral-spatial nonlinear\nrelationships in hyperspectral data. Simultaneously, through a dynamic grid\nadjustment mechanism, we adaptively update the grid point positions of\nB-splines based on the statistical characteristics of input data, optimizing\nthe resolution of spline functions to match the non-uniform distribution of\nspectral features, significantly improving the model's accuracy in\nhigh-dimensional data modeling and parameter efficiency, effectively\nalleviating the curse of dimensionality. This characteristic demonstrates\nsuperior neural scaling laws compared to traditional convolutional neural\nnetworks and reduces overfitting risks in small-sample and high-noise\nscenarios.

The sum estimation problem is well-studied under different access models\nto the universe $U$. However, to the best of our knowledge, nothing is known\nabout the sum estimation problem using non-adaptive conditional sampling. In\nthis work, we explore the sum estimation problem using non-adaptive conditional\nweighted and non-adaptive conditional uniform samples, assuming that the\nunderlying distribution ($D(i)=w(i)/W$) is monotone. We also extend our\napproach to to the case where the underlying distribution of $U$ is unimodal.\nAdditionally, we consider support size estimation when $w(i) = 0$ or $w(i) \\geq\nW/n$, using hybrid sampling (both weighted and uniform) to access $U$. We\npropose an algorithm to estimate $W$ under the non-increasing weight\nassumption, using $O(\\frac{1}{\\epsilon^3} \\log{n} + \\frac{1}{\\epsilon^6})$\nnon-adaptive weighted conditional samples and $O(\\frac{1}{\\epsilon^3} \\log{n})$\nuniform conditional samples.

    "abstract": "This study introduces the Iterative Chainlet Partitioning (ICP) algorithm and\nits neural acceleration for solving the Traveling Salesman Problem with Drone\n(TSP-D). The proposed ICP algorithm decomposes a TSP-D solution into smaller\nsegments called chainlets, each optimized individually by a dynamic programming\nsubroutine. The chainlet with the highest improvement is updated and the\nprocedure is repeated until no further improvement is possible. The number of\nsubroutine calls is bounded linearly in problem size for the first iteration\nand remains constant in subsequent iterations, ensuring algorithmic\nscalability. Empirical results show that ICP outperforms existing algorithms in\nboth solution quality and computational time. Tested over 1,059 benchmark\ninstances, ICP yields an average improvement of 2.75% in solution quality over\nthe previous state-of-the-art algorithm while reducing computational time by\n79.8%. The procedure is deterministic, ensuring reliability without requiring\nmultiple runs. The subroutine is the computational bottleneck in the already\nefficient ICP algorithm. To reduce the necessity of subroutine calls, we\nintegrate a graph neural network (GNN) to predict incremental improvements. We\ndemonstrate that the resulting Neuro ICP (NICP) achieves substantial\nacceleration while maintaining solution quality. Compared to ICP, NICP reduces\nthe total computational time by 49.7%, while the objective function value\nincrease is limited to 0.12%.

Concurrently, rapid advancements in image generation have made\ngenerated images viable as cover media.

High surface area to volume ratio\nin microscale flows outweighs the role of interfacial tension manipulation by\nmeans of introducing a secondary phase to the main flow in order to augment the\ntypically diffusion-dominant mass transfer operation. In this paper, we\nintroduce an easily integrable continuous flow micromixing scheme implemented\non a simple Y-type microchannel based on thermally excited intrinsic air within\nmicrochannel. Thanks to the direct contact between the sputtered thin platinum\nmicroheater and the co-flowing streams, trapped air in the liquid and/or tiny\ncrevices is employed to generate elongated bubbles with a millisecond lifespan,\nconsuming less than 0.4 W of power and thereby enabling homogeneous mixing. The\nperformance of the micromixer is characterized in terms of the mixing index\n(MI), and it is shown that immediately ahead of the microheater, the MI exceeds\n95% for side-by-side flowing of water at different overall flowrates, namely 4,\n10, and 20 uL/min. Interpreting the experimental results, supplemented by\nscaling arguments, we quantitatively describe the ephemeral role of emerging\nelongated bubbles in the micromixing process in which the Marangoni as well as\nWeber numbers are recognized as the characteristic local non-dimensional groups\nwhile the enhancing role of tiny daughter microbubbles on the micromixing\ndownstream of the microchannel can be reflected in the Peclet and the Capillary\nnumbers.",

    "abstract": "Sound source localization (SSL) is the task of locating the source of sound\nwithin an image. Due to the lack of localization labels, the de facto standard\nin SSL has been to represent an image and audio as a single embedding vector\neach, and use them to learn SSL via contrastive learning. To this end, previous\nwork samples one of local image features as the image embedding and aggregates\nall local audio features to obtain the audio embedding, which is far from\noptimal due to the presence of noise and background irrelevant to the actual\ntarget in the input. We present a novel SSL method that addresses this chronic\nissue by joint slot attention on image and audio. To be specific, two slots\ncompetitively attend image and audio features to decompose them into target and\noff-target representations, and only target representations of image and audio\nare used for contrastive learning. Also, we introduce cross-modal attention\nmatching to further align local features of image and audio. Our method\nachieved the best in almost all settings on three public benchmarks for SSL,\nand substantially outperformed all the prior work in cross-modal retrieval.",

In a previous specific heat study [K. Semeniuk et al. Phys.

From\nthermodynamic arguments we expected the phase-I boundary line to cross phase\nSC2 at a tetracritical point. However, we could not find any signature of the\nphase-I line inside the SC2 phase and speculated that this was due to the fact\nthat the $T_{0}(H)$ line is almost perpendicular to the $H$ axis and,\ntherefore, invisible to $T$-dependent measurements. This would imply a weak\ncompetition between the two order parameters. Here, we report magnetic field\ndependent measurements of the magnetostriction and ac-susceptibility on\nhigh-quality single crystals. We see clear evidence of the singularity at\n$H_{0}$ inside the SC2 phase and confirm our previous prediction. Furthermore,\nwe observe the transition across the $T^{*}(H)$ line in $T$-dependent specific\nheat measurements, which show that the $T^{*}(H)$ line is not perpendicular to\nthe field axis, but has a positive slope.

With\nthe detector response validated, we modelled muon transmission through a\nrealistic 3D representation of a hydrotreatment tower, incorporating internal\nvariations in catalyst bed density. By reconstructing angular muon fluxes and\ncomputing relative attenuation maps, we demonstrated the system's capability to\ndetect internal density contrasts. Simulation results indicate that 20~hours of\nexposure to vertical muon flux is sufficient to retrieve structural\ninformation. In comparison, inclined configurations (30$^\\circ$ and 60$^\\circ$\nfrom vertical) require extended exposure times--up to 8~days--yet remain\nfeasible within industrial monitoring schedules. These findings highlight the\nfeasibility of muography as a non-invasive diagnostic tool for complex\nindustrial infrastructure. The proposed system shows strong potential for\nreal-time monitoring of catalyst bed integrity and long-term structural\nanalysis in high-pressure chemical reactors.",

    "abstract": "The residual atmospheric muon flux was measured at a candidate site for a new\nunderground, low-radiation physics laboratory beneath the Kokhav HaYarden\nnational park in Israel. Located inside the tunnels of a hydroelectric\npumped-storage facility operating since 2024, the proposed site benefits from a\nvertical rock overburden of 361 meters, large potential floorspace, and easy\naccess by road. A muon hodoscope of vertically stacked wide-area $144 \\times 60\n\\times 1.2 $ cm$^3$ plastic scintillator plates was employed to measure the\nsuppression in the integrated muon flux at the site as compared with above\nground at sea level. Data-taking took place in mid-August of 2024 for several\ndays and was split into South-North and West-East orientations to account for\nthe directional acceptances due to the geometry of the detector. The\nsuppression factor is reported at $4456 \\pm 77$, expressed as $3.75 \\pm 0.06\n\\times 10^{-6}$ cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ in absolute terms, corresponding to an\neffective overburden of roughly $873$ m.w.e.. A deeper location at the site may\nalso be available, but it could not be reached at this time. Furthermore, the\nasymmetric topography of the mountain above and its muon shadow are clearly\nvisible in the angular data. Finally, auxiliary environmental measurements\nrecorded low background radon activity at $28.3 \\pm 14.0$ Bq m$^{-3}$. The\nexperimental campaign thus succeeded in demonstrating the viability of the\nsite's working conditions for future scientific research.",

We aim at determining relationship between\nthe region of pre-flare energy release with the regions where the flare started\nto develop, and to investigate a detailed chronology of energy release during\nthe pre-flare time interval and the beginning of the impulse phase. Using\nX-ray, ultraviolet and radio microwave data we found that the pre-flare energy\nrelease site was compact and localized in the vicinity of TC interaction of\nmagnetic structures near the polarity inversion line. The analysis indicates\nthat a pre-flare current sheet (CS) could be in this region. Good\ncorrespondence between the location of the pre-flare and flare emission sources\nvisible at the very beginning of the impulsive phase is shown. We found\nrelationship between dynamics of the energy release in the pre-flare CS and\nformation of the future flare eruptive structure. The growth of the magnetic\nflux rope was associated with activation of plasma emissions, flows and an\nincrease of UV radiation fluxes from the region where the pre-flare CS was\nlocated. The eruptive flux rope gradually grew due to feeding by magnetized\nplasma ejected from the reconnecting pre-flare CS. Finally, it is shown that\nthe most probable trigger of the eruption was a local fast microflare-like\nmagnetic reconnection in the pre-flare CS. Some local instability in the\npre-flare sheet could lead to a transition from the slow to fast reconnection\nregime. As a result, an ejection from the sheet was initiated and the eruptive\nflux rope lost its stability. Then, the eruptive flux rope itself initiated\nformation of the main reconnecting flare CS as in the Standard Flare Model\nduring its movement, and intense emissions associated with the impulsive phase\nwere observed.",

In FBALF, training bias is\nexplicitly incorporated into every local model's loss function, allowing for\nthe effective elimination of rating bias without compromising data privacy.\nExtensive experiments conducted on three real-world datasets demonstrate that\nFBALF achieves significantly higher recommendation accuracy compared to other\nstate-of-the-art federated RSs.",

The other is\nto build intuitive, explicit and mathematically provable guidelines for PID\ngain tuning. In this paper, we introduce a simple nonlinear mapping to\ndetermine PID gains from three auxiliary parameters. By the mapping, PID\ncontrol is shown to be equivalent to a new PD control (serving as a nominal\ncontrol) plus an uncertainty and disturbance compensator (to recover the\nnominal performance). Then PID control can be understood, designed and tuned in\na Two-Degree-of-Freedom (2-DoF) control framework.

Taking as an example the PID control applied to a general\nuncertain second-order plant, we prove by the singular perturbation theory that\nthe closed-loop steady-state and transient performance depends explicitly on\none auxiliary parameter which can be viewed as the virtual singular\nperturbation parameter (SPP) of PID control. All the three PID gains are\nmonotonically decreasing functions of the SPP, indicating that the smaller the\nSPP is, the higher the PID gains are, and the better the robustness of PID\ncontrol is.

Despite recent improvements, small LLMs struggle to handle questions\ninvolving multiple tables and complex SQL patterns under a Zero-Shot Learning\n(ZSL) setting. Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) partially compensates for the\nknowledge deficits in pretrained models but falls short while dealing with\nqueries involving multi-hop reasoning. To bridge this gap, different LLM\ntraining strategies to reinforce reasoning capabilities have been proposed,\nranging from leveraging a thinking process within ZSL, including reasoning\ntraces in SFT, or adopt Reinforcement Learning (RL) strategies. However, the\ninfluence of reasoning on Text2SQL performance is still largely unexplored.\nThis paper investigates to what extent LLM reasoning capabilities influence\ntheir Text2SQL performance on four benchmark datasets. To this end, it\nconsiders the following LLM settings: (1) ZSL, including general-purpose\nreasoning or not; (2) SFT, with and without task-specific reasoning traces; (3)\nRL, exploring the use of different rewarding functions, both the established\nEXecution accuracy (EX) and a mix with fine-grained ones that also account the\nprecision, recall, and cardinality of partially correct answers; (4) SFT+RL,\ni.e, a two-stage approach that combines SFT and RL. The results show that\ngeneral-purpose reasoning under ZSL proves to be ineffective in tackling\ncomplex Text2SQL cases. Small LLMs benefit from SFT with reasoning much more\nthan larger ones. RL is generally beneficial across all tested models and\ndatasets. The use of the fine-grained metrics turns out to be the most\neffective RL strategy.

Subalgebras of finite regions are Type $III_1$.\nThe argument uses the elegant results of Moore and of Alexandrov, Kazakov and\nKostov. This model is well known to be integrable and have no black hole\nexcitations. We have speculated that adding an interaction invisible in\nperturbation theory to a large finite number, $M$, of copies of the model,\nproduces a non-integrable model with meta-stable excitations having all of the\nproperties of linear dilaton black holes.

Nevertheless,\nexploiting non-adjacent nodes to provide valuable messages is challenging, as\nit could generate noisy information and disrupt the original graph structures.\nTo solve it, we propose a novel Degree Fairness Graph Transformer, named\nDegFairGT, to mitigate degree bias by discovering structural similarities\nbetween non-adjacent nodes through learnable structural augmentation and\nstructural self-attention. Our key idea is to exploit non-adjacent nodes with\nsimilar roles in the same community to generate informative edges under our\naugmentation, which could provide informative messages between nodes with\nsimilar roles while ensuring that the homophily principle is maintained within\nthe community. To enable DegFairGT to learn such structural similarities, we\nthen propose a structural self-attention to capture the similarities between\nnode pairs. To preserve global graph structures and prevent graph augmentation\nfrom hindering graph structure, we propose a Self-Supervised Learning task to\npreserve p-step transition probability and regularize graph augmentation.\nExtensive experiments on six datasets showed that DegFairGT outperformed\nstate-of-the-art baselines in degree fairness analysis, node classification,\nand node clustering tasks.",

    "abstract": "The orientation dynamics of a massive rigid ellipsoid in simple shear flow of\na Newtonian fluid is investigated in detail. The term `massive' refers to\ndominant particle inertia, as characterized by $St \\gg 1$, $St =\n\\dot{\\gamma}l^2\\rho_p/\\nu \\rho_f$ being the Stokes number; here, $\\dot{\\gamma}$\nis the shear rate, $\\nu$ is the kinematic viscosity, $l$ is a characteristic\nellipsoidal dimension (taken to be the longest semi axis), and $\\rho_p$ and\n$\\rho_f$ are the particle and fluid densities, respectively. Fluid inertial\neffects are neglected, so the particle Reynolds number ($Re$) is zero. The\nequations of motion of the ellipsoid in this limit reduce to those governing an\nEuler top, supplemented by a weak viscous torque. The dynamics consists of a\nfast conservative motion on time scales of $O(\\dot{\\gamma}^{-1})$ that, for an\nellipsoid, involves a combination of spin, precession and nutation, and a\nslower component driven by the viscous torque; the latter modulates the angular\nmomentum and rotational kinetic energy on asymptotically longer time scales of\n$O(St{\\dot{\\gamma}}^{-1})$. The separation of time scales for large $St$ allows\nfor use of the method of averaging for a triaxial ellipsoid, to derive an\nautonomous system of ODE's that govern motion on a four-dimensional slow\nmanifold consisting of the three angular momenta and the rotational kinetic\nenergy. There are three fixed points on the slow manifold, with rotation about\nthe shortest axis being stable. The fixed point corresponding to rotation about\nthe longest axis is a saddle point, while intermediate-axis-aligned rotation\ncorresponds to a singular fixed point. For spheroids, the singular fixed point\nmerges with one of the other two, leading to only two fixed points, one a\nstable node and the other a saddle; the former corresponds to rotation about\nthe shorter axis.",

We\nbelieve that the nugget evaluation methodology provides a solid foundation for\nevaluating RAG systems. This approach, originally developed for the TREC\nQuestion Answering (QA) Track in 2003, evaluates systems based on atomic facts\nthat should be present in good answers. Our efforts focus on \"refactoring\" this\nmethodology, where we describe the AutoNuggetizer framework that specifically\napplies LLMs to both automatically create nuggets and automatically assign\nnuggets to system answers. In the context of the TREC 2024 RAG Track, we\ncalibrate a fully automatic approach against strategies where nuggets are\ncreated manually or semi-manually by human assessors and then assigned manually\nto system answers. Based on results from a community-wide evaluation, we\nobserve strong agreement at the run level between scores derived from fully\nautomatic nugget evaluation and human-based variants. The agreement is stronger\nwhen individual framework components such as nugget assignment are automated\nindependently. This suggests that our evaluation framework provides tradeoffs\nbetween effort and quality that can be used to guide the development of future\nRAG systems.

Existing neural models\nprimarily focus on capturing complex dependencies for sequential item\ntransitions.

Although each paradigm has been actively studied in SBR, their\nfundamental differences in capturing item relationships and how to bridge these\ndistinct modeling paradigms effectively remain unexplored. In this paper, we\npropose a novel SBR model, namely Linear Item-Item model with Neural Knowledge\n(LINK), which integrates both types of knowledge into a unified linear\nframework. Specifically, we design two specialized components of LINK: (i)\nLinear knowledge-enhanced Item-item Similarity model (LIS), which refines the\nitem similarity correlation via self-distillation, and (ii) Neural\nknowledge-enhanced Item-item Transition model (NIT), which seamlessly\nincorporates complicated neural knowledge distilled from the off-the-shelf\nneural model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LINK outperforms\nstate-of-the-art linear SBR models across six real-world datasets, achieving\nimprovements of up to 14.78% and 11.04% in Recall@20 and MRR@20 while showing\nup to 813x fewer inference FLOPs.

In this paper, we firstly introduce DiT into the low-light enhancement\ntask and design a novel Structure-guided Diffusion Transformer based Low-light\nimage enhancement (SDTL) framework. We compress the feature through wavelet\ntransform to improve the inference efficiency of the model and capture the\nmulti-directional frequency band.

Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments\ndemonstrate that our method achieves SOTA performance on several popular\ndatasets, validating the effectiveness of SDTL in improving image quality and\nthe potential of DiT in low-light enhancement tasks.",

In\ncontrast to previous work focusing mainly on general language, we explore\nChatGPT's ability to identify and categorise errors in specialised\ntranslations. By testing two different prompts and based on a customised error\ntypology, we compare ChatGPT annotations with human expert evaluations of\ntranslations produced by DeepL and ChatGPT itself. The results show that, for\ntranslations generated by DeepL, recall and precision are quite high. However,\nthe degree of accuracy in error categorisation depends on the prompt's specific\nfeatures and its level of detail, ChatGPT performing very well with a detailed\nprompt. When evaluating its own translations, ChatGPT achieves significantly\npoorer results, revealing limitations with self-assessment. These results\nhighlight both the potential and the limitations of LLMs for translation\nevaluation, particularly in specialised domains. Our experiments pave the way\nfor future research on open-source LLMs, which could produce annotations of\ncomparable or even higher quality. In the future, we also aim to test the\npractical effectiveness of this automated evaluation in the context of\ntranslation training, particularly by optimising the process of human\nevaluation by teachers and by exploring the impact of annotations by LLMs on\nstudents' post-editing and translation learning.",

Using\nthe three best bands, by varying the parallax error threshold, we found that\nthe total error of the PLR zero point was minimized to 0.9\\% at a parallax\nerror threshold of 6\\%. With this threshold, we derived the PL and PLZ relation\nfor nine bands (from optical to mid-infrared) and five Wesenheit bands.

    "abstract": "The rapid expansion of generative AI drives unprecedented demands for\nhigh-performance computing. Training large-scale AI models now requires vast\ninterconnected GPU clusters across multiple data centers. Multi-scale AI\ntraining and inference demand uniform, ultra-low latency, and energy-efficient\nlinks to enable massive GPUs to function as a single cohesive unit. However,\ntraditional electrical and optical interconnects, relying on conventional\ndigital signal processors (DSPs) for signal distortion compensation,\nincreasingly fail to meet these stringent requirements. To overcome these\nlimitations, we present an integrated neuromorphic optical signal processor\n(OSP) that leverages deep reservoir computing and achieves DSP-free,\nall-optical, real-time processing. Experimentally, our OSP achieves a 100 Gbaud\nPAM4 per lane, 1.6 Tbit/s data center interconnect over a 5 km optical fiber in\nthe C-band (equivalent to over 80 km in the O-band), far exceeding the reach of\nstate-of-the-art DSP solutions, which are fundamentally constrained by\nchromatic dispersion in IMDD systems. Simultaneously, it reduces processing\nlatency by four orders of magnitude and energy consumption by three orders of\nmagnitude. Unlike DSPs, which introduce increased latency at high data rates,\nour OSP maintains consistent, ultra-low latency regardless of data rate\nscaling, making it ideal for future optical interconnects. Moreover, the OSP\nretains full optical field information for better impairment compensation and\nadapts to various modulation formats, data rates, and wavelengths. Fabricated\nusing a mature silicon photonic process, the OSP can be monolithically\nintegrated with silicon photonic transceivers, enhancing the compactness and\nreliability of all-optical interconnects. This research provides a highly\nscalable, energy-efficient, and high-speed solution, paving the way for\nnext-generation AI infrastructure.",

In this paper, we develop a novel sensing scheme\nbased on sparse Bayesian framework, where the delay and Doppler estimation\nproblem in time-varying channels is formulated as a 3D multiple\nmeasurement-sparse signal recovery (MM-SSR) problem.

The HERA strategy dynamically allocates resources by\nintegrating non-linear radio frequency energy harvesting (EH) based on the\ntime-switching (TS) approach and renewable energy as a complementary source. A\nnon-convex mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem is formulated to\nmaximize EH efficiency while satisfying quality-of-service, power, and energy\nconstraints under channel state information and hardware impairments. The\noptimization jointly considers BS transmit power, RIS phase shifts, TS factor,\nand RIS element selection as decision variables. To solve this problem, we\nintroduce the energy-efficient deep deterministic policy gradient (EE-DDPG)\nalgorithm. This deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based approach integrates\naction clipping and softmax-weighted Q-value estimation to mitigate estimation\nerrors. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed HERA method\nsignificantly improves EH efficiency, reaching up to 81.5\\% and 73.2\\% in\nsingle-user and multi-user scenarios, respectively, contributing to extended\nUAV operational time. Additionally, the proposed EE-DDPG model outperforms\nexisting DRL algorithms while maintaining practical computational complexity.",

We benchmark 5 frontier\nmodels, and find they do not currently pose a credible threat of\nself-replication, but succeed on many components and are improving rapidly.\nModels can deploy instances from cloud compute providers, write\nself-propagating programs, and exfiltrate model weights under simple security\nsetups, but struggle to pass KYC checks or set up robust and persistent agent\ndeployments. Overall the best model we evaluated (Claude 3.7 Sonnet) has a >50%\npass@10 score on 15/20 task families, and a >50% pass@10 score for 9/20\nfamilies on the hardest variants.

This study analyzes 20 active\nregions observed between 2012 and 2016 to examine the amplitude and energy flux\nvariation of SMAWs in the umbral atmosphere. Six different wavelength channels\nfrom the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory,\ncovering regions from the photosphere to the low corona, were utilized for this\npurpose. The wave amplitude estimations show a gradual increase in 3-minute\noscillation amplitude, peaking between 700--900 km, followed by a steady\ndecrease; at altitudes greater than 1800 km, the amplitude appears to increase\nand then decrease again. The corresponding energy flux, on the other hand,\ndisplays a steady and monotonous decrease with a significant reduction in value\nfrom approximately $3.32 \\pm 0.50~\\mathrm{kW,m^{-2}}$ near the photosphere to\nabout $(6.47 \\pm 3.16) \\times 10^{-4}~\\mathrm{W,m^{-2}}$ at an altitude of 2585\nkm.

    "abstract": "Recent research has focused on exploring the vulnerabilities of Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs), aiming to elicit harmful and/or sensitive content from\nLLMs. However, due to the insufficient research on dual-jailbreaking -- attacks\ntargeting both LLMs and Guardrails, the effectiveness of existing attacks is\nlimited when attempting to bypass safety-aligned LLMs shielded by guardrails.\nTherefore, in this paper, we propose DualBreach, a target-driven framework for\ndual-jailbreaking. DualBreach employs a Target-driven Initialization (TDI)\nstrategy to dynamically construct initial prompts, combined with a Multi-Target\nOptimization (MTO) method that utilizes approximate gradients to jointly adapt\nthe prompts across guardrails and LLMs, which can simultaneously save the\nnumber of queries and achieve a high dual-jailbreaking success rate. For\nblack-box guardrails, DualBreach either employs a powerful open-sourced\nguardrail or imitates the target black-box guardrail by training a proxy model,\nto incorporate guardrails into the MTO process.\n  We demonstrate the effectiveness of DualBreach in dual-jailbreaking scenarios\nthrough extensive evaluation on several widely-used datasets. Experimental\nresults indicate that DualBreach outperforms state-of-the-art methods with\nfewer queries, achieving significantly higher success rates across all\nsettings. More specifically, DualBreach achieves an average dual-jailbreaking\nsuccess rate of 93.67% against GPT-4 with Llama-Guard-3 protection, whereas the\nbest success rate achieved by other methods is 88.33%. Moreover, DualBreach\nonly uses an average of 1.77 queries per successful dual-jailbreak,\noutperforming other state-of-the-art methods. For the purpose of defense, we\npropose an XGBoost-based ensemble defensive mechanism named EGuard, which\nintegrates the strengths of multiple guardrails, demonstrating superior\nperformance compared with Llama-Guard-3.",

    "abstract": "Fickian yet non-Gaussian diffusion (FnGD) has gained popularity in the recent\ntimes owing to it's ubiquity in a variety of complex fluids. However, whether\nFnGD can be observed experimentally in molecular fuids is still obscure with\nvery little study in real systems. In this letter, we show existence of FnGD in\nmolecular fluids based on compelling evidence from incoherent quasielastic\nneutron scattering (IQENS). Using a cage-jump diffsion model, we show that\nwhile the approach to Fickianity is exponentially fast, the Gaussianity is\nrestored at a much slower algebraic rate. We propose a non-local diffusion\n(NLD) model to describe a d-dimensional jump-diffusion in FnGD regime and show\ntheir universal applicability in such systems. This study establishes that\ncage-jump diffusion process inevitably lead to FnGD and provides the framework\nof NLD models to explore such diffusion phenomena in any arbitrary dimensions.",

Under separability assumption on\ncost functions, we provide a recursive formulation of the FSN solution using\ndynamic programming.

The integration of Raman spectroscopy with\ndeep learning methods enables rapid qualitative and quantitative analysis of\nmaterials. Most existing approaches adopt supervised learning methods. Although\nsupervised learning has achieved satisfactory accuracy in spectral analysis, it\nis still constrained by costly and limited well-annotated spectral datasets for\ntraining. When spectral annotation is challenging or the amount of annotated\ndata is insufficient, the performance of supervised learning in spectral\nmaterial identification declines. In order to address the challenge of feature\nextraction from unannotated spectra, we propose a self-supervised learning\nparadigm for Raman Spectroscopy based on a Masked AutoEncoder, termed SMAE.\nSMAE does not require any spectral annotations during pre-training. By randomly\nmasking and then reconstructing the spectral information, the model learns\nessential spectral features. The reconstructed spectra exhibit certain\ndenoising properties, improving the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) by more than\ntwofold. Utilizing the network weights obtained from masked pre-training, SMAE\nachieves clustering accuracy of over 80% for 30 classes of isolated bacteria in\na pathogenic bacterial dataset, demonstrating significant improvements compared\nto classical unsupervised methods and other state-of-the-art deep clustering\nmethods. After fine-tuning the network with a limited amount of annotated data,\nSMAE achieves an identification accuracy of 83.90% on the test set, presenting\ncompetitive performance against the supervised ResNet (83.40%).",

The $D$-term emerges as a sensitive probe of the pion's\ninternal dynamics, governing its mechanical radius -- the largest among the\ncharge, mass, and mechanical radii. We further examine the pion's spatial\nstructure via its associated two-dimensional light-front densities, including\nthe momentum density, transverse pressure, and shear stress, all of which\nsatisfy the required normalization and von Laue stability conditions. Our\nresults reveal a detailed mechanical landscape: a centrally peaked momentum\ndensity that decreases monotonically; a repulsive pressure near the center (up\nto $x_\\perp = 0.33$~fm) that transitions to attraction in the outer region; and\na shear stress profile peaking at an intermediate distance ($x_\\perp \\approx\n0.2$~fm).",

    "abstract": "Domain adaptation is challenging for time series classification due to the\nhighly dynamic nature. This study tackles the most difficult subtask when both\ntarget labels and source data are inaccessible, namely, source-free domain\nadaptation. To reuse the classification backbone pre-trained on source data,\ntime series reconstruction is a sound solution that aligns target and source\ntime series by minimizing the reconstruction errors of both. However, simply\nfine-tuning the source pre-trained reconstruction model on target data may lose\nthe learnt priori, and it struggles to accommodate domain varying temporal\npatterns in a single encoder-decoder. Therefore, this paper tries to\ndisentangle the composition of domain transferability by using a compositional\narchitecture for time series reconstruction. Here, the preceding component is a\nU-net frozen since pre-trained, the output of which during adaptation is the\ninitial reconstruction of a given target time series, acting as a coarse step\nto prompt the subsequent finer adaptation. The following pipeline for finer\nadaptation includes two parallel branches: The source replay branch using a\nresidual link to preserve the output of U-net, and the offset compensation\nbranch that applies an additional autoencoder (AE) to further warp U-net's\noutput. By deploying a learnable factor on either branch to scale their\ncomposition in the final output of reconstruction, the data transferability is\ndisentangled and the learnt reconstructive capability from source data is\nretained. During inference, aside from the batch-level optimization in the\ntraining, we search at test time stability-aware rescaling of source replay\nbranch to tolerate instance-wise variation. The experimental results show that\nsuch compositional architecture of time series reconstruction leads to SOTA\nperformance on 3 widely used benchmarks.",

However, the collection and\nanalysis of user-generated stream data raise privacy concerns due to the\npotential exposure of sensitive information. To address these concerns, local\ndifferential privacy (LDP) has emerged as a promising standard. Nevertheless,\napplying LDP to stream data presents significant challenges, as stream data\noften involves a large or even infinite number of values. Allocating a given\nprivacy budget across these data points would introduce overwhelming LDP noise\nto the original stream data.\n  Beyond existing approaches that merely use perturbed values for estimating\nstatistics, our design leverages them for both perturbation and estimation.\nThis dual utilization arises from a key observation: each user knows their own\nground truth and perturbed values, enabling a precise computation of the\ndeviation error caused by perturbation. By incorporating this deviation into\nthe perturbation process of subsequent values, the previous noise can be\ncalibrated. Following this insight, we introduce the Iterative Perturbation\nParameterization (IPP) method, which utilizes current perturbed results to\ncalibrate the subsequent perturbation process. To enhance the robustness of\ncalibration and reduce sensitivity, two algorithms, namely Accumulated\nPerturbation Parameterization (APP) and Clipped Accumulated Perturbation\nParameterization (CAPP) are further developed. We prove that these three\nalgorithms satisfy $w$-event differential privacy while significantly improving\nutility.

We present the Parallel Hidden Decoding Transformer\n(\\textit{PHD}-Transformer), a novel framework that enables efficient length\nscaling during pre-training while maintaining inference efficiency.\n\\textit{PHD}-Transformer achieves this through an innovative KV cache\nmanagement strategy that distinguishes between original tokens and hidden\ndecoding tokens. By retaining only the KV cache of original tokens for\nlong-range dependencies while immediately discarding hidden decoding tokens\nafter use, our approach maintains the same KV cache size as the vanilla\ntransformer while enabling effective length scaling. To further enhance\nperformance, we introduce two optimized variants: \\textit{PHD-SWA} employs\nsliding window attention to preserve local dependencies, while\n\\textit{PHD-CSWA} implements chunk-wise sliding window attention to eliminate\nlinear growth in pre-filling time.

    "abstract": "Fairness is an increasingly important factor in re-ranking tasks. Prior work\nhas identified a trade-off between ranking accuracy and item fairness. However,\nthe underlying mechanisms are still not fully understood. An analogy can be\ndrawn between re-ranking and the dynamics of economic transactions. The\naccuracy-fairness trade-off parallels the coupling of the commodity tax\ntransfer process. Fairness considerations in re-ranking, similar to a commodity\ntax on suppliers, ultimately translate into a cost passed on to consumers.\nAnalogously, item-side fairness constraints result in a decline in user-side\naccuracy. In economics, the extent to which commodity tax on the supplier (item\nfairness) transfers to commodity tax on users (accuracy loss) is formalized\nusing the notion of elasticity. The re-ranking fairness-accuracy trade-off is\nsimilarly governed by the elasticity of utility between item groups. This\ninsight underscores the limitations of current fair re-ranking evaluations,\nwhich often rely solely on a single fairness metric, hindering comprehensive\nassessment of fair re-ranking algorithms. Centered around the concept of\nelasticity, this work presents two significant contributions. We introduce the\nElastic Fairness Curve (EF-Curve) as an evaluation framework. This framework\nenables a comparative analysis of algorithm performance across different\nelasticity levels, facilitating the selection of the most suitable approach.\nFurthermore, we propose ElasticRank, a fair re-ranking algorithm that employs\nelasticity calculations to adjust inter-item distances within a curved space.\nExperiments on three widely used ranking datasets demonstrate its effectiveness\nand efficiency.",

However, various\nquestions about prominences and their eruption mechanism remain unclear. In\nparticular, what causes the intriguing Doppler bullseye pattern in prominences\nhas not yet been solved, despite some preliminary studies proposing that they\nare probably associated with counterstreaming mass flows. Previous studies are\nmainly based on single-angle and short timescale observations, making it\ndifficult to determine the physical origin of Doppler bullseye patterns in\nprominences. Here, taking advantage of stereoscopic observations taken by the\nSolar Dynamics Observatory and the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory and\na three-dimensional numerical simulation, we investigate the origin of\nprominence Doppler bullseye pattern by tracing a long-lived transequatorial\nfilament/prominence from July 23 to August 4, 2012. We find that repeated\ncoronal jets at one end of the prominence can launch the Doppler bullseye\npattern. It is evidenced in our observations and simulation that during the\nforward traveling of jet plasma along the helical magnetic field structure of\nthe prominence, part of the ejecting plasma can not pass through the apex of\nthe prominence due to the insufficient kinetic energy and therefore forms a\nbackward-moving mass flow along the same or neighboring magnetic field lines.\nThis process finally forms counterstreaming mass flows in on-disk filaments.\nWhen the on-disk filament rotates to the solar limb to be a prominence, the\ncounterstreaming mass flows are naturally observed as a Doppler bullseye\npattern.",

Applied to a dataset of 260 soluble proteins, this\nyields an average density of 1.296 g cm-3, notably lower than the widely cited\nvalue of 1.35 g cm-3. Contrary to previous suggestions, we find no correlation\nbetween protein density and molecular weight. We instead find correlations with\nresidue composition, particularly with hydrophobic amino acid content. Using\nthese correlations, we train a regressor capable of accurately predicting\nprotein density from sequence-derived features alone. Examining the effect of\nincorporating water molecules on the measured density, we find that water\nmolecules buried in internal cavities have a negligible effect, whereas those\nat the surface have a profound impact. Furthermore, by calculating the density\nof a titin domain and of the Bovine Pancreatic Trypsin over molecular dynamics\ntrajectories, we show that individual proteins can occupy states with close but\ndistinguishable densities. Finally, we analyse the density of water in the\nvicinity of proteins, showing that the first two hydration shells exhibit\nhigher density than bulk water. When included in cumulative density\ncalculations, these hydration layers contribute to a net increase in local\nsolvent density. Overall, we find that proteins are less dense than previously\nreported, which is offset by their ability to induce a higher density of water\nin their vicinity.",

Ground-based\ngravitational wave (GW) detectors are particularly sensitive to high-frequency\nGW signals. In this regime, the lensing effect of a point-mass lens with a mass\nin the range of $10^{-1} \\sim 10^2 M_{\\odot}$ becomes significant. In this\nwork, we incorporate dPBH models with GW observations and employ Bayesian\ninference techniques to distinguish PBHs from dPBHs. Using the third-generation\nground-based GW detectors, Einstein Telescope (ET) and Cosmic Explorer (CE), as\nexamples, we demonstrate that these detectors can effectively differentiate the\nlensing effects of dPBHs from those of PBHs across a broad frequency range.\nFurthermore, we find that with a larger black hole (BH) mass inside the\nsurrounding particle DM, ET and CE can distinguish these two lensed models with\neven greater precision.",

For the decay $\\eta \\to \\pi^+\\pi^-\\gamma$, the box anomaly\ndominates, and we find that the anomalous coupling can be experimentally\ndetermined to percent-level precision at BESIII. In contrast, vector meson\ncontributions are significant in the decay $\\eta' \\to \\pi^+\\pi^-\\gamma$. Using\nexperimental data for $\\eta' \\to \\pi^+\\pi^-\\gamma$, we obtain ${\\cal\nB}_{\\mathrm{box}}^{\\text{exp}} = (1.70 \\pm 0.05)\\%$, which is approximately ten\ntimes larger than previously expected experimentally. We observe good agreement\nbetween our calculated anomalous couplings and experimental results. In kaon\ndecays, WZW terms uniquely contribute to the form factor $H$, which can be\nextracted from parity-conserving decay distributions. While predictions at the\nchiral point closely match experimental values (e.g., $H^+ = -2.31$ versus\n$-2.27 \\pm 0.10$), we find that intermediate vector meson states introduce\nsubstantial corrections, potentially as large as 25%.

In particular, some tools\nhave been developed to cluster configurations from classical simulations with a\nstandard focus on individual units, ranging from small molecules to complex\nproteins. Since the standard approach includes computing the Root Mean Square\nDeviation (RMSD) of atomic positions, accounting for the permutation between\natoms is crucial for optimizing the clustering procedure in the presence of\nidentical molecules. To address this issue, we present the clusttraj program, a\nsolvent-informed clustering package that fixes inflated RMSD values by finding\nthe optimal pairing between configurations. The program combines reordering\nschemes with the Kabsch algorithm to minimize the RMSD of molecular\nconfigurations before running a hierarchical clustering protocol. By\nconsidering evaluation metrics, one can determine the ideal threshold in an\nautomated fashion and compare the different linkage schemes available. The\nprogram capabilities are exemplified by considering solute-solvent systems\nranging from pure water clusters to a solvated protein or a small solute in\ndifferent solvents. As a result, we investigate the dependence on different\nparameters, such as the system size and reordering method, and also the\nrepresentativeness of the cluster medoids for the characterization of optical\nproperties. clusttraj is implemented as a Python library and can be employed to\ncluster generic ensembles of molecular configurations that go beyond\nsolute-solvent systems.",

In\nthis paper, we propose a new perspective that, as long as the foundation model\nis powerful enough, straightforward model modifications with flexible\nfine-tuning strategies can largely address the above challenges, taking a step\ntowards controllable character animation in the wild.

Instead, we demonstrate that minimal\nmodifications to the foundation model architecture yield a surprisingly strong\nbaseline. We further propose the low-noise warmup and \"large batches and small\niterations\" strategies to accelerate model convergence during fine-tuning while\nmaximally preserving the priors of the foundation model. In addition, we\nintroduce a new test dataset that captures diverse real-world challenges,\ncomplementing existing benchmarks such as TikTok dataset and UBC fashion video\ndataset, to comprehensively evaluate the proposed method.

However, existing designs lack this consideration, leading to\ninsufficient hardware utility and suboptimal performance.\n  This paper analyzes scenarios to process tasks with varying SLOs, and\nintroduces a simulated annealing-based scheduler to decide request priority\nsequence based on a request's SLO, input lengths, and possible output lengths.\nAs the first specialized scheduler for multi-SLO scenarios, this work improves\nSLO attainment by up to 5x and reduces average latency by 31.6% on\nPython-Code-23k-ShareGPT and ShareGPT_Vicuna_unfiltered datasets, compared to\ncurrent state-of-the-art framework vLLM and a new framework LMDeploy.",

    "abstract": "Layer 2 (L2) solutions are the cornerstone of blockchain scalability,\nenabling high-throughput and low-cost interactions by shifting execution\noff-chain while maintaining security through interactions with the underlying\nledger. Despite their common goals, the principal L2 paradigms -- payment\nchannels, rollups, and sidechains -- differ substantially in architecture and\nassumptions, making it difficult to comparatively analyze their security and\ntrade-offs.\n  To address this, we present the first general security framework for L2\nprotocols. Our framework is based on the IITM-based Universal Composability\n(iUC) framework, in which L2 protocols are modeled as stateful machines\ninteracting with higher-level protocol users and the underlying ledger. The\nmethodology defines a generic execution environment that captures ledger\nevents, message passing, and adversarial scheduling, and characterizes security\nthrough trace-based predicates parameterized by adversarial capabilities and\ntiming assumptions. By abstracting away from protocol-specific details while\npreserving critical interface and execution behavior, the framework enables\nmodular, protocol-agnostic reasoning and composable security proofs across a\nwide range of L2 constructions.\n  To demonstrate its applicability, we analyze an example from each of the\nthree dominant L2 scaling paradigms: a payment channel (Brick), a sidechain\n(Liquid Network), and a rollup (Arbitrum). By instantiating each within our\nframework, we derive their security properties and expose trade-offs. These\ninclude the time for dispute resolution, distribution of off-chain storage and\ncomputation, and varying trust assumptions (e.g., reliance on honest parties or\ndata availability). Our framework unifies the analysis of diverse L2 designs\nand pinpoints their strengths and limitations, providing a foundation for\nsecure, systematic L2 development.",

    "abstract": "Periodically poled lithium niobate on insulator (PPLNOI) ridge waveguides are\ncritical photonic components for both classical and quantum information\nprocessing. However, dry etching of PPLNOI waveguides often generates rough\nsidewalls and variations in the etching rates of oppositely poled lithium\nniobate ferroelectric domains, leading a relatively high propagation losses\n(0.25 - 1 dB/cm), which significantly limits net conversion efficiency and\nhinders scalable photonic integration. In this work, a low-loss PPLNOI ridge\nwaveguide with a length of 7 mm was fabricated using ultra-smooth sidewalls\nthrough photolithography-assisted chemo-mechanical etching (PLACE) followed by\nhigh-voltage pulse poling with low cost. The average surface roughness was\nmeasured at just 0.27 nm, resulting in record-low propagation loss of 0.106\ndB/cm in PPLNOI waveguides. Highly efficient second-harmonic generation was\ndemonstrated with a normalized efficiency of 1643%/(W*cm^2) without temperature\ntuning, corresponding to a conversion efficiency of 805%/W, which is closed to\nthe best conversion efficiency (i.e., 814%/W) reported in nanophotonic PPLNOI\nwaveguide fabricated by expensive electron-beam lithography followed by dry\netching.

This setting is motivated by\nreal-world scenarios, for example, participants may increase their budgets in\nresponse to competitors' obtained items. We initially propose a general\nframework with homogeneous externalities to capture the interdependence between\nbudget updates and allocation, formalized through a budget response function\nthat links each bidder's effective budget to the amount of items won by others.\n  The main contribution of this paper is to propose a truthful and individual\nrational auction mechanism for this novel auction setting, which achieves an\napproximation ratio of $1/3$ with respect to the liquid welfare. This mechanism\nis inspired by the uniform-price auction, in which an appropriate uniform price\nis selected to allocate items, ensuring the monotonicity of the allocation rule\nwhile accounting for budget adjustments. Additionally, this mechanism\nguarantees a constant approximation ratio by setting a purchase limit.\nComplementing this result, we establish an upper bound: no truthful mechanism\ncan achieve an approximation ratio better than $1/2$.

We develop an efficient\ngreedy algorithm and show that summary causal DAGs can be directly used for\ninference and are more robust to misspecification of assumptions, enhancing\nrobustness for causal inference. Experimenting with six real-life datasets, we\ncompared our algorithm to three existing solutions, showing its effectiveness\nin handling high-dimensional data and its ability to generate summary DAGs that\nensure both reliable causal inference and robustness against misspecifications.",

As these models use data\nfrom training images to generate new ones, it is often a daunting task to\nensure they do not violate intellectual property rights.

    "abstract": "This paper explores the application of kernel learning methods for parameter\nprediction and evaluation in the Algebraic Multigrid Method (AMG), focusing on\nseveral Partial Differential Equation (PDE) problems. AMG is an efficient\niterative solver for large-scale sparse linear systems, particularly those\nderived from elliptic and parabolic PDE discretizations. However, its\nperformance heavily relies on numerous parameters, which are often set\nempirically and are highly sensitive to AMG's effectiveness. Traditional\nparameter optimization methods are either computationally expensive or lack\ntheoretical support. To address this, we propose a Gaussian Process Regression\n(GPR)-based strategy to optimize AMG parameters and introduce evaluation\nmetrics to assess their effectiveness. Trained on small-scale datasets, GPR\npredicts nearly optimal parameters, bypassing the time-consuming parameter\nsweeping process. We also use kernel learning techniques to build a kernel\nfunction library and determine the optimal kernel function through linear\ncombination, enhancing prediction accuracy. In numerical experiments, we tested\ntypical PDEs such as the constant-coefficient Poisson equation,\nvariable-coefficient Poisson equation, diffusion equation, and Helmholtz\nequation. Results show that GPR-predicted parameters match grid search results\nin iteration counts while significantly reducing computational time. A\ncomprehensive analysis using metrics like mean squared error, prediction\ninterval coverage, and Bayesian information criterion confirms GPR's efficiency\nand reliability. These findings validate GPR's effectiveness in AMG parameter\noptimization and provide theoretical support for AMG's practical application.",

These archives, widely used as\nsupplementary resources in modern education, often consist of long, unedited\nrecordings that make it difficult to keep students engaged. Captured directly\nfrom face-to-face lectures without post-processing, they lack visual appeal.\nMeanwhile, the increasing volume of recorded material renders manual editing\nand annotation impractical. Automatically detecting high-engagement segments is\nthus crucial for improving accessibility and maintaining learning\neffectiveness. Our research focuses on real classroom lecture archives,\ncharacterized by unedited footage, no additional hardware (e.g., eye-tracking),\nand limited student numbers. We approximate student engagement using segment\naccess frequency as a proxy. Our model integrates multimodal features from\nteachers' actions (via OpenPose and optical flow), audio spectrograms, and\nslide page progression. These features are deliberately chosen for their\nnon-semantic nature, making the approach applicable regardless of lecture\nlanguage. Experiments show that our best model achieves a Pearson correlation\nof 0.5143 in 7-fold cross-validation and 69.32 percent average accuracy in a\ndownstream three-class classification task.

To address these challenges,\nwe introduce Video Fast Adversarial Training with Weak-to-Strong consistency\n(VFAT-WS), the first fast adversarial training method for video data.\nSpecifically, VFAT-WS incorporates the following key designs: First, it\nintegrates a straightforward yet effective temporal frequency augmentation\n(TF-AUG), and its spatial-temporal enhanced form STF-AUG, along with a\nsingle-step PGD attack to boost training efficiency and robustness. Second, it\ndevises a weak-to-strong spatial-temporal consistency regularization, which\nseamlessly integrates the simpler TF-AUG and the more complex STF-AUG.\nLeveraging the consistency regularization, it steers the learning process from\nsimple to complex augmentations. Both of them work together to achieve a better\ntrade-off between clean accuracy and robustness. Extensive experiments on\nUCF-101 and HMDB-51 with both CNN and Transformer-based models demonstrate that\nVFAT-WS achieves great improvements in adversarial robustness and corruption\nrobustness, while accelerating training by nearly 490%.",

    "abstract": "Humans can effortlessly locate desired objects in cluttered environments,\nrelying on a cognitive mechanism known as visual search to efficiently filter\nout irrelevant information and focus on task-related regions. Inspired by this\nprocess, we propose Dyfo (Dynamic Focus), a training-free dynamic focusing\nvisual search method that enhances fine-grained visual understanding in large\nmultimodal models (LMMs). Unlike existing approaches which require additional\nmodules or data collection, Dyfo leverages a bidirectional interaction between\nLMMs and visual experts, using a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm to\nsimulate human-like focus adjustments. This enables LMMs to focus on key visual\nregions while filtering out irrelevant content, without introducing additional\ntraining caused by vocabulary expansion or the integration of specialized\nlocalization modules. Experimental results demonstrate that Dyfo significantly\nimproves fine-grained visual understanding and reduces hallucination issues in\nLMMs, achieving superior performance across both fixed and dynamic resolution\nmodels.

A key challenge in ZSAD is learning general prompts\nstably and utilizing them effectively, while maintaining both generalizability\nand category specificity. Although general prompts have been explored in prior\nworks, achieving their stable optimization and effective deployment remains a\nsignificant challenge. In this work, we propose GenCLIP, a novel framework that\nlearns and leverages general prompts more effectively through multi-layer\nprompting and dual-branch inference. Multi-layer prompting integrates\ncategory-specific visual cues from different CLIP layers, enriching general\nprompts with more comprehensive and robust feature representations. By\ncombining general prompts with multi-layer visual features, our method further\nenhances its generalization capability. To balance specificity and\ngeneralization, we introduce a dual-branch inference strategy, where a\nvision-enhanced branch captures fine-grained category-specific features, while\na query-only branch prioritizes generalization. The complementary outputs from\nboth branches improve the stability and reliability of anomaly detection across\nunseen categories. Additionally, we propose an adaptive text prompt filtering\nmechanism, which removes irrelevant or atypical class names not encountered\nduring CLIP's training, ensuring that only meaningful textual inputs contribute\nto the final vision-language alignment.",

    "abstract": "Traditional video-to-audio generation techniques primarily focus on\nperspective video and non-spatial audio, often missing the spatial cues\nnecessary for accurately representing sound sources in 3D environments. To\naddress this limitation, we introduce a novel task, 360V2SA, to generate\nspatial audio from 360-degree videos, specifically producing First-order\nAmbisonics (FOA) audio - a standard format for representing 3D spatial audio\nthat captures sound directionality and enables realistic 3D audio reproduction.\nWe first create Sphere360, a novel dataset tailored for this task that is\ncurated from real-world data. We also design an efficient semi-automated\npipeline for collecting and cleaning paired video-audio data. To generate\nspatial audio from 360-degree video, we propose a novel framework OmniAudio,\nwhich leverages self-supervised pre-training using both spatial audio data (in\nFOA format) and large-scale non-spatial data. Furthermore, OmniAudio features a\ndual-branch framework that utilizes both panoramic and perspective video inputs\nto capture comprehensive local and global information from 360-degree videos.\nExperimental results demonstrate that OmniAudio achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance across both objective and subjective metrics on Sphere360.

    "abstract": "The rapid spread of misinformation, driven by digital media and AI-generated\ncontent, has made automatic claim verification essential. Traditional methods,\nwhich depend on expert-annotated evidence, are labor-intensive and not\nscalable. Although recent automated systems have improved, they still struggle\nwith complex claims that require nuanced reasoning. To address this, we propose\nCRAVE, a Conflicting Reasoning Approach for explainable claim VErification,\nthat verify the complex claims based on the conflicting rationales reasoned by\nlarge language models (LLMs). Specifically, CRAVE introduces a three-module\nframework. Ambiguity Elimination enchanced Evidence Retrieval module performs\nambiguity elimination and entity-based search to gather relevant evidence\nrelated to claim verification from external sources like Wikipedia. Conflicting\nPerspective Reasoning and Preliminary Judgment module with LLMs adopts LLMs to\nreason rationales with conflicting stances about claim verification from\nretrieved evidence across four dimensions, i.e., direct evidence, semantic\nrelationships, linguistic patterns, and logical reasoning and make a\npreliminary judgment. Finally, Small Language Model (SLM) based Judge module is\nfine-tuned to make use of preliminary judgment from LLMs to assess the\nconfidence of the conflicting rationales and make a final authenticity\njudgment. This methodology allows CRAVE to capture subtle inconsistencies in\ncomplex claims, improving both the accuracy and transparency of claim\nverification. Extensive experiments on two public claim verification datasets\ndemonstrate that our CRAVE model achieves much better performance than\nstate-of-the-art methods and exhibits a superior capacity for finding relevant\nevidence and explaining the model predictions.

    "abstract": "Exponentially growing short video platforms (SVPs) face significant\nchallenges in moderating content detrimental to users' mental health,\nparticularly for minors. The dissemination of such content on SVPs can lead to\ncatastrophic societal consequences. Although substantial efforts have been\ndedicated to moderating such content, existing methods suffer from critical\nlimitations: (1) Manual review is prone to human bias and incurs high\noperational costs. (2) Automated methods, though efficient, lack nuanced\ncontent understanding, resulting in lower accuracy. (3) Industrial moderation\nregulations struggle to adapt to rapidly evolving trends due to long update\ncycles. In this paper, we annotate the first SVP content moderation benchmark\nwith authentic user/reviewer feedback to fill the absence of benchmark in this\nfield. Then we evaluate various methods on the benchmark to verify the\nexistence of the aforementioned limitations. We further propose our common-law\ncontent moderation framework named KuaiMod to address these challenges. KuaiMod\nconsists of three components: training data construction, offline adaptation,\nand online deployment & refinement. Leveraging large vision language model\n(VLM) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, KuaiMod adequately models video\ntoxicity based on sparse user feedback and fosters dynamic moderation policy\nwith rapid update speed and high accuracy. Offline experiments and large-scale\nonline A/B test demonstrates the superiority of KuaiMod: KuaiMod achieves the\nbest moderation performance on our benchmark. The deployment of KuaiMod reduces\nthe user reporting rate by 20% and its application in video recommendation\nincreases both Daily Active User (DAU) and APP Usage Time (AUT) on several\nKuaishou scenarios.

To\novercome this, we present Uni3C, a unified 3D-enhanced framework for precise\ncontrol of both camera and human motion in video generation. Uni3C includes two\nkey contributions. First, we propose a plug-and-play control module trained\nwith a frozen video generative backbone, PCDController, which utilizes\nunprojected point clouds from monocular depth to achieve accurate camera\ncontrol. By leveraging the strong 3D priors of point clouds and the powerful\ncapacities of video foundational models, PCDController shows impressive\ngeneralization, performing well regardless of whether the inference backbone is\nfrozen or fine-tuned. This flexibility enables different modules of Uni3C to be\ntrained in specific domains, i.e., either camera control or human motion\ncontrol, reducing the dependency on jointly annotated data. Second, we propose\na jointly aligned 3D world guidance for the inference phase that seamlessly\nintegrates both scenic point clouds and SMPL-X characters to unify the control\nsignals for camera and human motion, respectively. Extensive experiments\nconfirm that PCDController enjoys strong robustness in driving camera motion\nfor fine-tuned backbones of video generation. Uni3C substantially outperforms\ncompetitors in both camera controllability and human motion quality.\nAdditionally, we collect tailored validation sets featuring challenging camera\nmovements and human actions to validate the effectiveness of our method.",

It uses deep\nlearning to create a nonlinear mapping between optical structures and\nfunctions, bypassing time-consuming traditional design and attaining higher\naccuracy. Yet, current deep-learning models for optical design face\nlimitations.

It\nleverages a large amount of data using Jones matrices and physics-informed data\naugmentation.

However, due to its huge model size and runtime\nincrease of the memory footprint, LLM inferences suffer from the lack of memory\ncapacity in conventional systems consisting of multiple GPUs with a modest\namount of high bandwidth memory. Moreover, since LLM contains many\nbandwidthintensive kernels, only focusing on the memory capacity without\nconsidering the bandwidth incurs a serious performance degradation. To handle\nsuch conflicting memory capacity and bandwidth demands in a cost-effective way,\nthis study investigates the potential of heterogeneous memory systems,\nproposing H2M2. It uses an asymmetric memory architecture consisting of\ncapacity-centric and bandwidthcentric memory with computation units attached to\neach memory device. With the asymmetric memory, we first analyze the effect of\nkernel-memory mapping for the asymmetric memory. Second, we propose a dynamic\nruntime algorithm that finds a mapping solution considering the characteristics\nof LLM operations and the change of footprint during LLM inference. Third, we\nadvocate the need for memory abstraction for the efficient management of the\nasymmetric memory. H2M2 outperforms the conventional homogeneous memory system\nwith LPDDR by 1.46x, 1.55x, and 2.94x speedup in GPT3-175B, Chinchilla-70B, and\nLlama2-70B, respectively.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we present a novel framework for deriving the evolution\nequation of the level set function in topology optimization, departing from\nconventional Hamilton-Jacobi based formulations. The key idea is the\nintroduction of an auxiliary domain, geometrically identical to the physical\ndesign domain, occupied by fictitious matter which is dynamically excited by\nthe conditions prevailing in the design domain. By assigning kinetic and\npotential energy to this matter and interpreting the level set function as the\ngeneralized coordinate to describe its deformation, the governing equation of\nmotion is determined via Hamilton's principle, yielding a modified wave\nequation. Appropriate combinations of model parameters enable the recovery of\nclassical physical behaviors, including the standard and biharmonic wave\nequations. The evolution problem is formulated in weak form using variational\nmethods and implemented in the software environment FreeFEM++. The influence of\nthe numerical parameters is analyzed on the example of minimum mean compliance.\nThe results demonstrate that topological complexity and strut design can be\neffectively controlled by the respective parameters. In addition, the method\nallows for the nucleation of new holes and eliminates the need for\nre-initializing the level set function. The inclusion of a damping term further\nenhances numerical stability.

In such complex contexts, the increasing\npattern diversity has brought two challenges to reconstruction-based\napproaches: (1) over-generalization: anomalies that are subtle or share\ncompositional similarities with normal patterns may be reconstructed with high\nfidelity, making them difficult to distinguish from normal instances; and (2)\ninsufficient normality reconstruction: complex normal features, such as\nintricate textures or fine-grained structures, may not be faithfully\nreconstructed due to the model's limited representational capacity, resulting\nin false positives. Existing methods typically focus on addressing the former,\nwhich unintentionally exacerbate the latter, resulting in inadequate\nrepresentation of intricate normal patterns. To concurrently address these two\nchallenges, we propose a Memory-augmented Dual-Decoder Networks (MDD-Net). This\nnetwork includes two critical components: a Dual-Decoder Reverse Distillation\nNetwork (DRD-Net) and a Class-aware Memory Module (CMM). Specifically, the\nDRD-Net incorporates a restoration decoder designed to recover normal features\nfrom synthetic abnormal inputs and an identity decoder to reconstruct features\nthat maintain the anomalous semantics. By exploiting the discrepancy between\nfeatures produced by two decoders, our approach refines anomaly scores beyond\nthe conventional encoder-decoder comparison paradigm, effectively reducing\nfalse positives and enhancing localization accuracy. Furthermore, the CMM\nexplicitly encodes and preserves class-specific normal prototypes, actively\nsteering the network away from anomaly reconstruction. Comprehensive\nexperimental results across several benchmarks demonstrate the superior\nperformance of our MDD-Net framework over current SoTA approaches in\nmulti-class UAD tasks.",

The primary objective is to compare the\noutcomes of these models when encoder components from two cutting-edge\narchitectures: the Vision Transformer (ViT) and the Variational Auto-Encoder\n(VAE) are utilized to project the high dimensional train dataset to the learned\nlow dimensional latent space. The encoder components are employed to project\nhigh-dimensional structured .csv IoT botnet traffic datasets to various latent\nsizes. Evaluated on N-BaIoT and CICIoT2022 datasets, findings reveal that\nVAE-encoder based dimension reduction outperforms ViT-encoder based dimension\nreduction for both datasets in terms of four performance metrics including\naccuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for all models which can be\nattributed to absence of spatial patterns in the datasets the ViT model\nattempts to learn and extract from image instances.",

Existing methods generate or\nenhance missing details in low-quality spectra data using the high-quality one,\ngenerally called the primary spectrum, but how to justify the primary spectrum\nis a challenging problem. In addition, when the quality of the primary spectrum\nis low, the enhancement effect would be greatly degraded, thus limiting the\nperformance of multi-spectral vehicle ReID. To address these problems, we\npropose the Collaborative Enhancement Network (CoEN), which generates a\nhigh-quality proxy from all spectra data and leverages it to supervise the\nselection of primary spectrum and enhance all spectra features in a\ncollaborative manner, for robust multi-spectral vehicle ReID.

Second, we design the\nDynamic Quality Sort Module (DQSM), which sorts all spectra data by measuring\ntheir correlations with the proxy, to accurately select the primary spectra\nwith the highest correlation.

    "abstract": "Function calling is a fundamental capability of today's large language\nmodels, but sequential function calling posed efficiency problems. Recent\nstudies have proposed to request function calls with parallelism support in\norder to alleviate this issue. However, they either delegate the concurrent\nfunction calls to users for execution which are conversely executed\nsequentially, or overlook the relations among various function calls, rending\nlimited efficiency. This paper introduces LLMOrch, an advanced framework for\nautomated, parallel function calling in large language models. The key\nprinciple behind LLMOrch is to identify an available processor to execute a\nfunction call while preventing any single processor from becoming overburdened.\nTo this end, LLMOrch models the data relations (i.e., def-use) among different\nfunction calls and coordinates their executions by their control relations\n(i.e., mutual-exclusion) as well as the working status of the underlying\nprocessors. When comparing with state-of-the-art techniques, LLMOrch\ndemonstrated comparable efficiency improvements in orchestrating I/O-intensive\nfunctions, while significantly outperforming (2$\\times$) them with\ncompute-intensive functions. LLMOrch's performance even showed a linear\ncorrelation to the number of allocated processors. We believe that these\nresults highlight the potential of LLMOrch as an efficient solution for\nparallel function orchestration in the context of large language models.",

While reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in\ntraining such agents, most of existing approaches typically optimize only for\nfinal correctness without considering the efficiency or necessity of external\ntool use.

To\nfacilitate this shift, we introduce GainSight, the first comprehensive,\nopen-source framework that aligns dynamic, fine-grained workload lifetime\nprofiles with memory device characteristics to enable generation of optimal\nStRAM memory compositions. GainSight combines retargetable profiling backends\nwith an architecture-agnostic analytical frontend. The various backends capture\ncycle-accurate data lifetimes, while the frontend correlates workload patterns\nwith StRAM retention properties to generate optimal memory compositions and\nproject performance. GainSight elevates data lifetime to a first-class design\nconsideration for next-generation AI accelerators, enabling systematic\nexploitation of data transience for improved on-chip memory density and\nefficiency. Applying GainSight to MLPerf Inference and PolyBench workloads\nreveals that 64.3% of first-level GPU cache accesses and 79.01% of systolic\narray scratchpad accesses exhibit sub-microsecond lifetimes suitable for\nhigh-density StRAM, with optimal heterogeneous on-chip memory compositions\nachieving up to 3x active energy and 4x area reductions compared to uniform\nSRAM hierarchies. To facilitate adoption and further research, GainSight is\nopen-sourced at https://gainsight.stanford.edu/.",

    "abstract": "People often speak of being \"moved beyond words\" when witnessing\nawe-inspiring natural beauty, experiencing profound moral elevation, or\nencountering powerful works of art and music. Such moments evoke intensely\nembodied sensations - a swelling in the chest, a quickened heartbeat, or a\nsudden stillness that floods the entire body. These experiences are difficult\nto articulate, yet they are vividly real and spatially anchored in bodily\nexperience. This review examines the emerging method of body mapping, which\ncaptures how individuals subjectively localize emotional sensations across the\nbody. Drawing on over two dozen empirical studies, we propose a tripartite\nframework for understanding the origins of emotional bodily maps: (1) bottom-up\nphysiological signals, (2) top-down behavioral engagement (including motor\nactions), and (3) conceptual and metaphorical constructions. Crucially, we\nargue that bodily maps are not mere reflections of physiological monitoring,\nbut expressive interfaces between brain, body, and conceptualization. Because\nthey rely on introspective sensation rather than verbal articulation, bodily\nmaps offer a promising language-independent tool for assessing emotional\nexperience - particularly in cross-cultural research, developmental studies,\nand clinical contexts where verbal reporting may be limited or unreliable.\nUltimately, bodily maps reveal the hidden geography of emotion-those feelings\nthat elude precise definition or verbalization, like being moved beyond words,\nyet are undeniably real and embodied - offering a compelling window into how\nemotions are formed, shared, and lived through the body.",

However, modeling radio signal propagation in large and occluded\nenvironments is challenging due to complex interactions between signals and\nobstacles. Existing methods face two key limitations: they struggle to predict\nsignal strength for transmitter-receiver pairs not present in the training set,\nwhile also requiring extensive manual data collection for modeling, making them\nimpractical for large, obstacle-rich scenarios. To overcome these limitations,\nwe propose FERMI, a flexible radio mapping framework.

This hybrid model learns radio\nsignal propagation more efficiently, requiring only sparse training data.\nAdditionally, FERMI introduces a scalable planning method for autonomous data\ncollection using a multi-robot team. By increasing parallelism in data\ncollection and minimizing robot travel costs between regions, overall data\ncollection efficiency is significantly improved. Experiments in both simulation\nand real-world scenarios demonstrate that FERMI enables accurate signal\nprediction and generalizes well to unseen positions in complex environments. It\nalso supports fully autonomous data collection and scales to different team\nsizes, offering a flexible solution for creating radio maps.

Existing approaches to MIPS either rely solely on Inner Product\n(IP) similarity, which faces issues with local optima and redundant\ncomputations, or reduce the MIPS problem to the Nearest Neighbor Search under\nthe Euclidean metric via space projection, leading to topology destruction and\ninformation loss. Despite the divergence of the two paradigms, we argue that\nthere is no inherent binary opposition between IP and Euclidean metrics. By\nstitching IP and Euclidean in the design of indexing and search algorithms, we\ncan significantly enhance MIPS performance. Specifically, this paper explores\nthe theoretical and empirical connections between these two metrics from the\nMIPS perspective. Our investigation, grounded in graph-based search, reveals\nthat different indexing and search strategies offer distinct advantages for\nMIPS, depending on the underlying data topology. Building on these insights, we\nintroduce a novel graph-based index called Metric-Amphibious Graph (MAG) and a\ncorresponding search algorithm, Adaptive Navigation with Metric Switch (ANMS).\nTo facilitate parameter tuning for optimal performance, we identify three\nstatistical indicators that capture essential data topology properties and\ncorrelate strongly with parameter tuning.

Due to these\nperspectives, we propose PseudoFormer, a novel two-branch framework that\nbridges the gap between weakly and fully-supervised Temporal Action\nLocalization (TAL). We first introduce RickerFusion, which maps all predicted\naction proposals to a global shared space to generate pseudo labels with better\nquality. Subsequently, we leverage both snippet-level and proposal-level labels\nwith different priors from the weak branch to train the regression-based model\nin the full branch. Finally, the uncertainty mask and iterative refinement\nmechanism are applied for training with noisy pseudo labels.

In this work, we reinterpret RAG as Retrieval-Augmented Reasoning\nand identify a central but underexplored problem: \\textit{Reasoning\nMisalignment}-the divergence between an LLM's internal reasoning trajectory and\nthe evidential constraints provided by retrieval. To address this issue, we\npropose \\textsc{AlignRAG}, a novel iterative framework grounded in\nCritique-Driven Alignment (CDA).

This mechanism trains\na dedicated retrieval-augmented \\textit{Critic Language Model (CLM)} using\nlabeled critiques that distinguish between evidence-aligned and misaligned\nreasoning. Alignment signals for supervision are obtained through\nself-supervised or externally guided labeling strategies. The resulting CLM is\nexplicitly optimized for evidence sensitivity, enabling it to detect and revise\nreasoning errors during inference without relying solely on self-generated\nfeedback.

    "abstract": "Since the 1990s, the integration of technology into daily life has led to the\ncreation of an extensive network of interconnected devices, transforming how\nindividuals and organizations operate. However, this digital transformation has\nalso spurred the rise of cybercrime, criminal activities perpetrated through\nnetworks or computer systems. Cybercrime has become a global concern,\npresenting significant challenges to security systems. Although advancements in\ndigital technology have enhanced efficiency, they have also opened new avenues\nfor exploitation by cybercriminals, highlighting the urgent need for advanced\ncybersecurity measures. The escalating number of cyberattacks and associated\nrisks in the past decade highlights the critical importance of protecting\nsensitive data and safeguarding information systems. Cybercrimes range from\nfinancial fraud and phishing scams to identity theft and online harassment,\nposing substantial risks to both individuals and organizations. In response,\ngovernments, law enforcement agencies, and cybersecurity units have intensified\ntheir efforts to address these threats. In recent years, India has experienced\na significant surge in cybercrime incidents, with a notable increase in cases\ninvolving ransomware, data breaches, and social engineering attacks. The\ngrowing penetration of internet services, the expansion of e-commerce, and the\nrapid adoption of digital payment systems have made individuals and\norganizations more vulnerable to cyber threats. Key areas affected include\nbanking, healthcare, and government sectors, which are frequently targeted due\nto the sensitive nature of the data they handle. To combat these risks, there\nis an increasing focus on public awareness, cybersecurity education, and robust\nregulatory frameworks. This paper examines cybercrime, prevention strategies,\nsecurity protocols, and terminology to safeguard digital infrastructure.",

First, this problem is transformed\ninto a stabilization problem for an unstable wave equation with output delay\nand disturbances by employing regulator equations. Subsequently, a\nbackstepping-based feedforward regulator is proposed to exponentially stabilize\nthis system. To track the states of the unstable wave equation, the time\ninterval is partitioned into two segments. The observers and predictors are\ndesigned at these distinct intervals, respectively. Therein, the observers\ncomprise two components: a state observer proposed via dynamic compensators and\nan adaptive observer designed by the adaptive internal model method. Finally, a\nnovel error-based feedback controller is derived using a single measurement,\nensuring exponential convergence of the tracking error to zero.

To tackle this\nchallenge, we propose APIRAT, a novel code translation method that integrates\nmulti-source API knowledge. APIRAT employs three API knowledge augmentation\ntechniques, including API sequence retrieval, API sequence back-translation,\nand API mapping, to guide LLMs to translating code, ensuring both the correct\nstructure of API sequences and the accurate usage of individual APIs. Extensive\nexperiments on two public datasets, CodeNet and AVATAR, indicate that APIRAT\nsignificantly surpasses existing LLM-based methods, achieving improvements in\ncomputational accuracy ranging from 4% to 15.1%.

However,\nexisting approaches often overlook the quality variations in local features and\nfail to fully leverage the complementary information across modalities,\nparticularly in the case of low-quality features. In this paper, we propose to\naddress this issue by leveraging a novel graph reasoning model, termed the\nModality-aware Graph Reasoning Network (MGRNet). Specifically, we first\nconstruct modality-aware graphs to enhance the extraction of fine-grained local\ndetails by effectively capturing and modeling the relationships between\npatches. Subsequently, the selective graph nodes swap operation is employed to\nalleviate the adverse effects of low-quality local features by considering both\nlocal and global information, enhancing the representation of discriminative\ninformation. Finally, the swapped modality-aware graphs are fed into the\nlocal-aware graph reasoning module, which propagates multi-modal information to\nyield a reliable feature representation. Another advantage of the proposed\ngraph reasoning approach is its ability to reconstruct missing modal\ninformation by exploiting inherent structural relationships, thereby minimizing\ndisparities between different modalities. Experimental results on four\nbenchmarks (RGBNT201, Market1501-MM, RGBNT100, MSVR310) indicate that the\nproposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-modal object\nReID.

Despite recent advances, existing\ngeneration methods still face limitations in achieving both diversity and\ncost-effectiveness.

To address these issues, this paper proposes a multi-agent framework\nfor high-quality and large-scale SQL generation, dubbed SQL-Factory.

This modular framework ensures a balanced\ntrade-off between diversity, scalability, and generation cost.

Existing methods rely heavily on either flow-level features or\nraw packet byte features. Flow-level features often require inspecting entire\nor most of the traffic flow, leading to excessive resource consumption, while\nraw packet byte features fail to distinguish between headers and payloads,\noverlooking semantic differences and introducing noise from feature\nmisalignment. Therefore, this paper proposes IoT-AMLHP, an aligned multimodal\nlearning framework for resource-efficient malicious IoT traffic classification.\nFirstly, the framework constructs a packet-wise header-payload representation\nby parsing packet headers and payload bytes, resulting in an aligned and\nstandardized multimodal traffic representation that enhances the\ncharacterization of heterogeneous IoT traffic.

In this work, we present a comprehensive comparative\nstudy of three spiking neuron circuit architectures-Leaky-Integrate-and-Fire\n(LIF), Morris-Lecar (ML), and Axon-Hillock (AH)-implemented in a 7 nm FinFET\ntechnology. Through extensive SPICE simulations, we explore the optimization of\nspiking frequency, energy per spike, and static power consumption. Our results\nshow that the AH design achieves the highest throughput, demonstrating\nmulti-gigahertz firing rates (up to 3 GHz) with attojoule energy costs. By\ncontrast, the ML architecture excels in subthreshold to near-threshold regimes,\noffering robust low-power operation (as low as 0.385 aJ/spike) and biological\nbursting behavior. Although LIF benefits from a decoupled current mirror for\nhigh-frequency operation, it exhibits slightly higher static leakage compared\nto ML and AH at elevated supply voltages. Comparisons with previous node\nimplementations (22 nm planar, 28 nm) reveal that 7 nm FinFETs can drastically\nboost energy efficiency and speed albeit at the cost of increased subthreshold\nleakage in deep subthreshold regions. By quantifying design trade-offs for each\nneuron architecture, our work provides a roadmap for optimizing spiking neuron\ncircuits in advanced nanoscale technologies to deliver neuromorphic hardware\ncapable of both ultra-low-power operation and high computational throughput.",

To fill this gap, we propose the Distribution-aware Dataset\nDistillation method (TripleD), a new framework that extends the principles of\ndataset distillation to image restoration. Specifically, TripleD uses a\npre-trained vision Transformer to extract features from images for complexity\nevaluation, and the subset (the number of samples is much smaller than the\noriginal training set) is selected based on complexity. The selected subset is\nthen fed through a lightweight CNN that fine-tunes the image distribution to\nalign with the distribution of the original dataset at the feature level. To\nefficiently condense knowledge, the training is divided into two stages. Early\nstages focus on simpler, low-complexity samples to build foundational\nknowledge, while later stages select more complex and uncertain samples as the\nmodel matures. Our method achieves promising performance on multiple image\nrestoration tasks, including multi-task image restoration, all-in-one image\nrestoration, and ultra-high-definition image restoration tasks.

However, the\nenhanced capabilities of loV have heightened the demands for efficient network\nresource allocation while simultaneously giving rise to diverse vehicular\nservice requirements. For network service providers (NSPs), meeting the\ncustomized resource-slicing requirements of vehicle service providers (VSPs)\nwhile maximizing social welfare has become a significant challenge. This paper\nproposes an innovative solution by integrating a mean-field multi-agent\nreinforcement learning (MFMARL) framework with an enhanced\nVickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) auction mechanism to address the problem of social\nwelfare maximization under the condition of unknown VSP utility functions. The\ncore of this solution is introducing the ``value of information\" as a novel\nmonetary metric to estimate the expected benefits of VSPs, thereby ensuring the\neffective execution of the VCG auction mechanism. MFMARL is employed to\noptimize resource allocation for social welfare maximization while adapting to\nthe intelligent and dynamic requirements of IoV. The proposed enhanced VCG\nauction mechanism not only protects the privacy of VSPs but also reduces the\nlikelihood of collusion among VSPs, and it is theoretically proven to be\ndominant-strategy incentive compatible (DSIC).

By treating the DM as the object of inspection,\nPAIA enables direct analysis of internal model behavior, bypassing the need for\noptimized prompts or generated images. We evaluate PAIA on 320 controlled model\nand 690 real-world community models sourced from a public DM sharing platform.\nPAIA achieves over 90% detection accuracy while reducing auditing time by\n18-40x compared to existing baselines. To our knowledge, PAIA is the first\nscalable and practical solution for pre-deployment concept auditing of\ndiffusion models, providing a practical foundation for safer and more\ntransparent diffusion model sharing.",

    "abstract": "Artificial neural networks are powerful tools capable of addressing various\ntasks. Although the backpropagation algorithm has become a standard training\nmethod for these neural networks, its lack of biological plausibility has\ninspired the development of alternative learning approaches. One such\nalternative is Kaneko's Error Diffusion Learning Algorithm (EDLA), a\nbiologically motivated approach wherein a single global error signal diffuses\nthroughout a network composed of paired excitatory-inhibitory sublayers,\nthereby eliminating the necessity for layer-wise backpropagation. This study\npresents a contemporary formulation of the EDLA framework and evaluates its\neffectiveness through parity check, regression, and image classification tasks.\nOur experimental results indicate that EDLA networks can consistently achieve\nhigh accuracy across these benchmarks, with performance efficiency and\nconvergence speed notably influenced by the choice of learning rate, neuron\ncount, and network depth. Further investigation of the internal representations\nformed by EDLA networks reveals their capacity for meaningful feature\nextraction, similar to traditional neural networks. These results suggest that\nEDLA is a biologically motivated alternative for training feedforward networks\nand will motivate future work on extending this method to biologically inspired\nneural networks.",

For Euclidean lattices,\nthe classification reproduces and expands upon known results, while for more\ngeneral spaces -- including open cones over finite simplicial complexes -- we\nrelate nontrivial QCAs to generalized homology theories with coefficients in\nthe L-theory spectrum.

While domain-specific supervised\nfine-tuning (SFT) is effective and efficient, it often weakens cross-domain\ngeneralization and struggles with noisy training data. To address these\nchallenges, we propose DONOD, a lightweight model-intrinsic data pruning\nmethod. Our approach evaluates data using two model-parameter-based metrics:\nDelta of Norm (DON), which captures the cumulative influence on model weights,\nand Norm of Delta (NOD), which quantifies weight instability. Moreover, by\nemploying the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution\n(TOPSIS) algorithm, we effectively filter noisy, unlearnable, and\ngeneralization-harming samples without relying on auxiliary models during the\nSFT process. Experiments on mathematical tasks demonstrate that data selected\nby DONOD achieves superior fine-tuning efficiency and improved robustness\nagainst noisy data. By filtering out 70% of the whole dataset, we improve\ntarget-domain accuracy by 14.90% and cross-domain accuracy by 5.67%.

To\ntackle these challenges, we propose an Iterative Task-Driven Framework\n(ITDNet), which integrates a LiDAR Data Restoration (LDR) module and a LiDAR\nPlace Recognition (LPR) module through an iterative learning strategy. These\nmodules are jointly trained end-to-end, with alternating optimization to\nenhance performance. The core rationale of ITDNet is to leverage the LDR module\nto recover the corrupted point clouds while preserving structural consistency\nwith clean data, thereby improving LPR accuracy in adverse weather.\nSimultaneously, the LPR task provides feature pseudo-labels to guide the LDR\nmodule's training, aligning it more effectively with the LPR task. To achieve\nthis, we first design a task-driven LPR loss and a reconstruction loss to\njointly supervise the optimization of the LDR module. Furthermore, for the LDR\nmodule, we propose a Dual-Domain Mixer (DDM) block for frequency-spatial\nfeature fusion and a Semantic-Aware Generator (SAG) block for semantic-guided\nrestoration. In addition, for the LPR module, we introduce a Multi-Frequency\nTransformer (MFT) block and a Wavelet Pyramid NetVLAD (WPN) block to aggregate\nmulti-scale, robust global descriptors.

Therefore, this paper proposes a systematic\nanalytical framework for the S\\&I problem. We first summarize imbalance metrics\nand complexity analysis methods, highlighting the need for interpretable\nbenchmarks to characterize S&I problems. Second, we review recent solutions for\nconventional, complexity-based, and extreme S&I problems, revealing\nmethodological differences in handling various data distributions. Our summary\nfinds that resampling remains a widely adopted solution. However, we conduct\nexperiments on binary and multiclass datasets, revealing that classifier\nperformance differences significantly exceed the improvements achieved through\nresampling. Finally, this paper highlights open questions and discusses future\ntrends.",

    "abstract": "In semantic segmentation, the accuracy of models heavily depends on the\nhigh-quality annotations. However, in many practical scenarios such as medical\nimaging and remote sensing, obtaining true annotations is not straightforward\nand usually requires significant human labor. Relying on human labor often\nintroduces annotation errors, including mislabeling, omissions, and\ninconsistency between annotators. In the case of remote sensing, differences in\nprocurement time can lead to misaligned ground truth annotations. These label\nerrors are not independently distributed, and instead usually appear in\nspatially connected regions where adjacent pixels are more likely to share the\nsame errors. To address these issues, we propose an approximate Bayesian\nestimation based on a probabilistic model that assumes training data includes\nlabel errors, incorporating the tendency for these errors to occur with spatial\ncorrelations between adjacent pixels. Bayesian inference requires computing the\nposterior distribution of label errors, which becomes intractable when spatial\ncorrelations are present. We represent the correlation of label errors between\nadjacent pixels through a Gaussian distribution whose covariance is structured\nby a Kac-Murdock-Szeg\\\"{o} (KMS) matrix, solving the computational challenges.\nThrough experiments on multiple segmentation tasks, we confirm that leveraging\nthe spatial correlation of label errors significantly improves performance.\nNotably, in specific tasks such as lung segmentation, the proposed method\nachieves performance comparable to training with clean labels under moderate\nnoise levels.

BHSI describes measurement as a\nunitary branching of the local Hilbert space into decoherent, independent, and\nunitarily evolving subspaces, while updating observer states (through their\nequipment) by causally engaging and disengaging operators. Unlike the\nCopenhagen Interpretation (CI), BHSI avoids wave function collapse while\nmaintaining the Born rule through the branch weights associated with the\ninitial system state. Unlike the Many-Worlds Interpretation (MWI), BHSI\nsidesteps parallel worlds by entangling branches with the local environment\nwithin a single world. We compare BHSI features with those of CI, MWI, and\nBohmian Mechanics (BM). We investigate its implications for the double-slit\nexperiment, Bell tests, Wigner and his friend, black hole radiation, and the\ndelayed-choice quantum eraser. We examine quantum teleportation, demonstrating\nthat locally controlled decoherence and recoherence processes (CDRP) can be\nobserved. Specifically, we suggest experiments using modern Stern-Gerlach\ninterferometers (SGI) to visualize the CDRP, measure branch weights that encode\nthe Born rule, and predict the electromagnetic (EM) phase shift resulting from\nthe independent unitary evolution of decoherent branches.

By leveraging high capacity of deep generative model,\nwhich is an influential machine learning technique, the sensitivity-free\ndata-driven topology design (DDTD) methodology is regarded as an effective\nmeans of overcoming these issues. The DDTD methodology depends on initial\ndataset with a certain regularity, making its results highly sensitive to\ninitial dataset quality. This limits its effectiveness and generalizability,\nespecially for optimization problems without priori information. In this\nresearch, we proposed a multi-level mesh DDTD-based method with\ncorrelation-based mutation module to escape from the limitation of the quality\nof the initial dataset on the results and enhance computational efficiency. The\ncore is to employ a correlation-based mutation module to assign new geometric\nfeatures with physical meaning to the generated data, while utilizing a\nmulti-level mesh strategy to progressively enhance the refinement of the\nstructural representation, thus avoiding the maintenance of a high\ndegree-of-freedom (DOF) representation throughout the iterative process.

    "abstract": "We propose a novel spectral generative model for image synthesis that departs\nradically from the common variational, adversarial, and diffusion paradigms. In\nour approach, images, after being flattened into one-dimensional signals, are\nreconstructed as linear combinations of a set of learned spectral basis\nfunctions, where each basis is explicitly parameterized in terms of frequency,\nphase, and amplitude. The model jointly learns a global spectral dictionary\nwith time-varying modulations and per-image mixing coefficients that quantify\nthe contributions of each spectral component. Subsequently, a simple\nprobabilistic model is fitted to these mixing coefficients, enabling the\ndeterministic generation of new images by sampling from the latent space. This\nframework leverages deterministic dictionary learning, offering a highly\ninterpretable and physically meaningful representation compared to methods\nrelying on stochastic inference or adversarial training. Moreover, the\nincorporation of frequency-domain loss functions, computed via the short-time\nFourier transform (STFT), ensures that the synthesized images capture both\nglobal structure and fine-grained spectral details, such as texture and edge\ninformation. Experimental evaluations on the CIFAR-10 benchmark demonstrate\nthat our approach not only achieves competitive performance in terms of\nreconstruction quality and perceptual fidelity but also offers improved\ntraining stability and computational efficiency. This new type of generative\nmodel opens up promising avenues for controlled synthesis, as the learned\nspectral dictionary affords a direct handle on the intrinsic frequency content\nof the images, thus providing enhanced interpretability and potential for novel\napplications in image manipulation and analysis.",

    "abstract": "Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) is a popular weakly-supervised method for\nvarious applications, with a particular interest in histological whole slide\nimage (WSI) classification. Due to the gigapixel resolution of WSI,\napplications of MIL in WSI typically necessitate a two-stage training scheme:\nfirst, extract features from the pre-trained backbone and then perform MIL\naggregation. However, it is well-known that this suboptimal training scheme\nsuffers from \"noisy\" feature embeddings from the backbone and inherent weak\nsupervision, hindering MIL from learning rich and generalizable features.\nHowever, the most commonly used technique (i.e., dropout) for mitigating this\nissue has yet to be explored in MIL. In this paper, we empirically explore how\neffective the dropout can be in MIL. Interestingly, we observe that dropping\nthe top-k most important instances within a bag leads to better performance and\ngeneralization even under noise attack. Based on this key observation, we\npropose a novel MIL-specific dropout method, termed MIL-Dropout, which\nsystematically determines which instances to drop. Experiments on five MIL\nbenchmark datasets and two WSI datasets demonstrate that MIL-Dropout boosts the\nperformance of current MIL methods with a negligible computational cost.

Here, we present a periodic waveform\nanalysis-based TDTR (PWA-TDTR) method that extends the measurable frequency\nrange down to 50 Hz with minimal modifications to the conventional setup. This\nadvancement greatly enhances measurement sensitivity, enabling accurate\nmeasurements of in-plane thermal conductivities as low as 0.2 W/(m K). We\nvalidate the technique by measuring polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) and fused\nsilica, using PWA-TDTR to obtain in-plane thermal diffusivity and conventional\nTDTR to measure cross-plane thermal effusivity. Together, these allow the\nextraction of both thermal conductivity and volumetric heat capacity, with\nresults in excellent agreement with literature values. We further demonstrate\nthe versatility of PWA-TDTR through (1) thermal conductivity and heat capacity\nmeasurements of thin liquid films and (2) depth-resolved thermal conductivity\nprofiling in lithium niobate crystals, revealing point defect-induced\ninhomogeneities at depths up to 100 um.

    "abstract": "In this paper, a delay-angle information spoofing (DAIS) strategy is proposed\nto enhance the location privacy at the physical layer. More precisely, the\nlocation-relevant delays and angles are artificially shifted without the aid of\nchannel state information (CSI) at the transmitter, such that the location\nperceived by the eavesdropper is incorrect and distinct from the true one. By\nleveraging the intrinsic structure of the wireless channel, a precoder is\ndesigned to achieve DAIS while the legitimate localizer can remove the\nobfuscation via securely receiving a modest amount of information, i.e., the\ndelay-angle shifts. A lower bound on eavesdropper's localization error is\nderived, revealing that location privacy is enhanced not only due to estimation\nerror, but also by the geometric mismatch introduced by DAIS. Furthermore, the\nlower bound is explicitly expressed as a function of the delay-angle shifts,\ncharacterizing performance trends and providing the appropriate design of these\nshift parameters. The statistical hardness of maliciously inferring the\ndelay-angle shifts by a single-antenna eavesdropper as well as the challenges\nfor a multi-antenna eavesdropper are investigated to assess the robustness of\nthe proposed DAIS strategy. Numerical results show that the proposed DAIS\nstrategy results in more than 15 dB performance degradation for the\neavesdropper as compared with that for the legitimate localizer at high\nsignal-to-noise ratios, and provides more effective location-privacy\nenhancement than the prior art.",

    "abstract": "Pipeline parallelism has emerged as a predominant approach for deploying\nlarge language models (LLMs) across distributed nodes, owing to its lower\ncommunication overhead compared to tensor parallelism. While demonstrating high\nthroughput in request serving, pipeline parallelism often suffers from\nperformance limitations caused by pipeline bubbles, which are primarily\nresulted from imbalanced computation delays across batches. Existing methods\nlike Sarathi-Serve attempt to address this through hybrid scheduling of chunked\nprefill and decode tokens using a fixed token budget. However, such methods may\nexperience significant fluctuations due to either insufficient prefill tokens\nor uneven distribution of decode tokens, ultimately leading to computational\nimbalance. To overcome these inefficiencies, we present gLLM, a globally\nbalanced pipeline parallelism system incorporating Token Throttling to\neffectively mitigate the pipeline bubbles. Our Token Throttling mechanism is a\nfine-grained scheduling policy that independently regulates the quantities of\nprefill and decode tokens, thus enabling balanced computation by leveraging\nglobal information from the inference system. Specifically, for decode tokens,\ngLLM maintains near-consistent token count across processing batches. For\nprefill tokens, it dynamically adjusts batch sizes based on both total pending\ntokens and the memory utilization rates of key-value cache (KV cache).\nFurthermore, gLLM runtime adopts an asynchronous execution and message passing\narchitecture specifically optimized for pipeline parallelism characteristics.\nExperimental evaluations with representative LLMs show that gLLM achieves\nsignificant performance improvements, delivering 11% to 398% higher maximum\nthroughput compared to state-of-the-art pipeline or tensor parallelism systems,\nwhile simultaneously maintaining lower latency.",
