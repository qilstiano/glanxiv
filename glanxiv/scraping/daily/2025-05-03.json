    "abstract": "Water temperature can vary substantially even across short distances within\nthe same sub-watershed. Accurate prediction of stream water temperature at fine\nspatial resolutions (i.e., fine scales, $\\leq$ 1 km) enables precise\ninterventions to maintain water quality and protect aquatic habitats. Although\nspatiotemporal models have made substantial progress in spatially coarse time\nseries modeling, challenges persist in predicting at fine spatial scales due to\nthe lack of data at that scale.To address the problem of insufficient\nfine-scale data, we propose a Multi-Scale Graph Learning (MSGL) method. This\nmethod employs a multi-task learning framework where coarse-scale graph\nlearning, bolstered by larger datasets, simultaneously enhances fine-scale\ngraph learning. Although existing multi-scale or multi-resolution methods\nintegrate data from different spatial scales, they often overlook the spatial\ncorrespondences across graph structures at various scales. To address this, our\nMSGL introduces an additional learning task, cross-scale interpolation\nlearning, which leverages the hydrological connectedness of stream locations\nacross coarse- and fine-scale graphs to establish cross-scale connections,\nthereby enhancing overall model performance. Furthermore, we have broken free\nfrom the mindset that multi-scale learning is limited to synchronous training\nby proposing an Asynchronous Multi-Scale Graph Learning method (ASYNC-MSGL).\nExtensive experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our\nmethod for anti-sparse downscaling of daily stream temperatures in the Delaware\nRiver Basin, USA, highlighting its potential utility for water resources\nmonitoring and management.",

    "abstract": "UAVs, commonly referred to as drones, have witnessed a remarkable surge in\npopularity due to their versatile applications. These cyber-physical systems\ndepend on multiple sensor inputs, such as cameras, GPS receivers,\naccelerometers, and gyroscopes, with faults potentially leading to physical\ninstability and serious safety concerns. To mitigate such risks, anomaly\ndetection has emerged as a crucial safeguarding mechanism, capable of\nidentifying the physical manifestations of emerging issues and allowing\noperators to take preemptive action at runtime. Recent anomaly detection\nmethods based on LSTM neural networks have shown promising results, but three\nchallenges persist: the need for models that can generalise across the diverse\nmission profiles of drones; the need for interpretability, enabling operators\nto understand the nature of detected problems; and the need for capturing\ndomain knowledge that is difficult to infer solely from log data. Motivated by\nthese challenges, this paper introduces RADD, an integrated approach to anomaly\ndetection in drones that combines rule mining and unsupervised learning. In\nparticular, we leverage rules (or invariants) to capture expected relationships\nbetween sensors and actuators during missions, and utilise unsupervised\nlearning techniques to cover more subtle relationships that the rules may have\nmissed. We implement this approach using the ArduPilot drone software in the\nGazebo simulator, utilising 44 rules derived across the main phases of drone\nmissions, in conjunction with an ensemble of five unsupervised learning models.\nWe find that our integrated approach successfully detects 93.84% of anomalies\nover six types of faults with a low false positive rate (2.33%), and can be\ndeployed effectively at runtime. Furthermore, RADD outperforms a\nstate-of-the-art LSTM-based method in detecting the different types of faults\nevaluated in our study.",

    "abstract": "Autonomous agents operating in public spaces must consider how their\nbehaviors might affect the humans around them, even when not directly\ninteracting with them.

Existing methods for this purpose use human actor\nintent modeling or imitation learning techniques, but these approaches rarely\ncapture all possible motivations for human behavior and/or require significant\namounts of data. Our work extends a technique for modeling unimodal\nnaturalistic behaviors with an explicit convex set representation, to account\nfor multimodal behavior by using multiple convex sets. This more flexible\nrepresentation provides a higher degree of fidelity in data-driven modeling of\nnaturalistic behavior that arises in real-world scenarios in which human\nbehavior is, in some sense, discrete, e.g. whether or not to yield at a\nroundabout. Equipped with this new set representation, we develop an\noptimization-based filter to project arbitrary trajectories into the set so\nthat they appear naturalistic to humans in the scene, while also satisfying\nvehicle dynamics, actuator limits, etc. We demonstrate our methods on\nreal-world human driving data from the inD (intersection) and rounD\n(roundabout) datasets.",

    "abstract": "3D neuron growth and neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) deterioration\nexhibit complex morphological transformations as neurites differentiate into\naxons and dendrites, forming intricate networks driven by tubulin\nconcentrations and neurotrophin signals. Conventional 2D models fall short of\ncapturing such morphological complexity, prompting the need and development of\nadvanced 3D computational approaches. In this paper, we present a complex 3D\nneuron growth model based on isogeometric analysis (IGA) and the phase field\nmethod, utilizing locally refined truncated hierarchical B-splines\n(THB-splines). IGA offers isoparametric representation and higher-order\ncontinuity, which are essential for simulating the smooth, evolving interfaces\nof phase field neurites. In contrast, the phase field method can automatically\nhandle diffuse interfaces and complex topological changes without explicit\nboundary tracking. This IGA-based phase field method enables accurate and\nefficient simulation of neurite extensions, branching, and retraction in a\nfully 3D setting. The THB-spline implementation supports multi-level local\nrefinement, focusing computational resources on regions of active growth, while\ndynamic domain expansion adapts the simulation domain to extend with growing\nneurites. KD-tree-based interpolation ensures that phase field variables are\naccurately transferred onto newly refined meshes. NDDs associated neurite\ndeterioration is simulated by modulating the driving force term within the\nphase field model to induce interface retraction.

Extensive\nexperiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that GauS-SLAM outperforms\ncomparable methods, delivering superior tracking precision and rendering\nfidelity.

    "abstract": "In this paper, I explored how a range of regression and machine learning\ntechniques can be applied to monthly U.S. unemployment data to produce timely\nforecasts. I compared seven models: Linear Regression, SGDRegressor, Random\nForest, XGBoost, CatBoost, Support Vector Regression, and an LSTM network,\ntraining each on a historical span of data and then evaluating on a later\nhold-out period. Input features include macro indicators (GDP growth, CPI),\nlabor market measures (job openings, initial claims), financial variables\n(interest rates, equity indices), and consumer sentiment.\n  I tuned model hyperparameters via cross-validation and assessed performance\nwith standard error metrics and the ability to predict the correct unemployment\ndirection. Across the board, tree-based ensembles (and CatBoost in particular)\ndeliver noticeably better forecasts than simple linear approaches, while the\nLSTM captures underlying temporal patterns more effectively than other\nnonlinear methods. SVR and SGDRegressor yield modest gains over standard\nregression but don't match the consistency of the ensemble and deep-learning\nmodels.\n  Interpretability tools ,feature importance rankings and SHAP values, point to\njob openings and consumer sentiment as the most influential predictors across\nall methods. By directly comparing linear, ensemble, and deep-learning\napproaches on the same dataset, our study shows how modern machine-learning\ntechniques can enhance real-time unemployment forecasting, offering economists\nand policymakers richer insights into labor market trends.\n  In the comparative evaluation of the models, I employed a dataset comprising\nthirty distinct features over the period from January 2020 through December\n2024.",

However, bridging the\nmodality gap between speech signals and facial dynamics remains a challenge,\noften resulting in incorrect lip syncing and unnatural facial movements. To\naddress this, we propose OT-Talk, the first approach to leverage optimal\ntransportation to optimize the learning model in talking head animation.\nBuilding on existing learning frameworks, we utilize a pre-trained Hubert model\nto extract audio features and a transformer model to process temporal\nsequences. Unlike previous methods that focus solely on vertex coordinates or\ndisplacements, we introduce Chebyshev Graph Convolution to extract geometric\nfeatures from triangulated meshes. To measure mesh dissimilarities, we go\nbeyond traditional mesh reconstruction errors and velocity differences between\nadjacent frames. Instead, we represent meshes as probability measures and\napproximate their surfaces. This allows us to leverage the sliced Wasserstein\ndistance for modeling mesh variations. This approach facilitates the learning\nof smooth and accurate facial motions, resulting in coherent and natural facial\nanimations. Our experiments on two public audio-mesh datasets demonstrate that\nour method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques both quantitatively and\nqualitatively in terms of mesh reconstruction accuracy and temporal alignment.\nIn addition, we conducted a user perception study with 20 volunteers to further\nassess the effectiveness of our approach.",

In this paper, we first assess GPT-4's\nability to act as a path planner compared to the A* algorithm, then present a\nhybrid planning framework that integrates GPT-4's semantic reasoning with A* on\na low-cost robot platform operating on ROS2 Humble. Our approach eliminates\nexplicit finite state machine (FSM) coding by using prompt-based GPT-4\nreasoning to handle task logic while maintaining the accurate paths computed by\nA*. The GPT-4 module provides semantic understanding of instructions and\nenvironmental cues (e.g., recognizing toxic obstacles or crowded areas to\navoid, or understanding low-battery situations requiring alternate route\nselection), and dynamically adjusts the robot's occupancy grid via obstacle\nbuffering to enforce semantic constraints.

BMPs are analogous to the Tensor-Trains (TT) and\nMatrix Product States (MPS) used, respectively, in applied mathematics and in\nquantum many-body physics to accelerate computations that are usually\ninaccessible by more traditional approaches. BMPs turn out to be closely\nrelated to Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs), a powerful compressed\nrepresentation of Boolean functions invented in the late 80s by Bryant that has\nfound a broad range of applications in many areas of computer science and\nengineering. We present a direct and natural translation of BMPs into Binary\nDecision Diagrams (BDDs), and derive an elementary set of operations used to\nmanipulate and combine BMPs that are analogous to those introduced by Bryant\nfor BDDs. Both BDDs and BMPs are practical tools when the complexity of these\nrepresentations, as measured by the maximum bond dimension of a BMP (or the\naccumulated bond dimension across the BMP matrix train) and the number of nodes\nof a BDD, remains polynomial in the number of bits, $n$. In both cases,\ncontrolling the complexity hinges on optimizing the order of the Boolean\nvariables. BMPs offer the advantage that their construction and manipulation\nrely on simple linear algebra -- a compelling feature that can facilitate the\ndevelopment of open-source libraries that are both more flexible and easier to\nuse than those currently available for BDDs. An initial implementation of a BMP\nlibrary is available on GitHub, with the expectation that the close conceptual\nconnection to TT and MPS techniques will motivate further development of BMP\nmethods by researchers in these fields, potentially enabling novel applications\nto classical and quantum computing.",

From the perspective of computability theory, the problem of\nensuring the digital twin's integrity -- i.e., keeping it in a state where it\nmatches its physical counterpart -- entails a notion of algorithmic information\nthat determines which of the physical system's properties we can reliably\ndeduce by algorithmically analyzing its digital twin. The present work\ninvestigates the fractional calculus of periodic functions -- particularly, we\nconsider the Wiener algebra -- as an exemplary application of the\nalgorithmic-information concept. We establish a continuously ordered hierarchy\nof algorithmic information among spaces of periodic functions -- depending on\ntheir fractional degree of smoothness -- in which the ordering relation\ndetermines whether a certain representation of some function contains ``more''\nor ``less'' information than another. Additionally, we establish an analogous\nhierarchy among lp-spaces, which form a cornerstone of (traditional) digital\nsignal processing.

Although all operations on a\nsingle qubit can be formally expressed using the complex classical Hamiltonian\ndynamics, we show that the resulting system is still not a proper qubit. The\nreason is that it is not capable of getting entangled to another bona fide\nqubit and hence it does not have the information-processing capacity of a\nfully-fledged quantum system.

The univariate inference problems are solved by\nsampling posterior probability densities obtained by combining constructed\nprior densities with observational likelihoods according to Bayes' rule. Many\nserial filters in the literature focus on representing the marginal posterior\ndensities of each state. However, rigorously capturing the conditional\ndependencies between the different univariate inferences is crucial to\ncorrectly sampling multidimensional posteriors. This work proposes a new serial\nensemble filter, called the copula rank histogram filter (CoRHF), that seeks to\ncapture the conditional dependency structure between variables via empirical\ncopula estimates; these estimates are used to rigorously implement the\ntriangular (state-by-state univariate) Bayesian inference.

To address this limitation, we\npropose Discrete Spatial Diffusion (DSD), a framework based on a\ncontinuous-time, discrete-state jump stochastic process that operates directly\nin discrete spatial domains while strictly preserving particle counts in both\nforward and reverse diffusion processes. By using spatial diffusion to achieve\nparticle conservation, we introduce stochasticity naturally through a discrete\nformulation.

We validate DSD\non two challenging scientific applications: porous rock microstructures and\nlithium-ion battery electrodes, demonstrating its ability to generate\nstructurally realistic samples under strict mass conservation constraints, with\nquantitative evaluation using state-of-the-art metrics for transport and\nelectrochemical performance.",

However, the inherently\ndynamic nature of OWC environments resulting from user mobility, and\ntime-varying user demands poses significant challenges for enhanced and\nsustainable performance. Energy efficiency (EE) is a critical metric for the\nsustainable operation of next generation wireless networks. Achieving high EE\nin dynamic OWC environments, especially under time-varying user distributions\nand heterogeneous service requirements, remains a complex task. In this work,\nwe formulate a discrete-time EE optimisation problem in a dynamic OWC to\nmaximise energy efficiency through determining user connectivity and power\nallocation. Solving this problem in real time is computationally demanding due\nto the coupling of user association and power allocation variables over\ndiscrete time slots. Therefore, we propose a Probabilistic Demand Prediction\nand Optimised Power Allocation (PDP-OPA) framework which predicts user\narrivals, departures, and traffic demands. Based on these predictions, the\nframework proactively determines AP-user associations and allocates power\ndynamically using a Lagrangian-based optimisation strategy. Simulation results\ndemonstrate that the proposed PDP-OPA significantly enhances system\nperformance, providing solutions close to the optimal ones. The proposed\nframework improves energy efficiency, sum rate, and bit error rate (BER)\ncompared to distance-based user association and uniform power allocation,\nvalidating its effectiveness for real time and adaptive resource management in\ndynamic OWC systems.",

    "abstract": "This work investigates the change in cell survival predicted by the local\neffect model (LEM) for an irradiated cell containing metal nanoparticles (MNPs)\ndepending on the distribution of neighboring cells and the uptake of MNPs into\nthe cells. In this first part of the paper, the theoretical framework is\ndescribed, which is based on analytical weighting functions for the energy\ndeposition around a single metal nanoparticle and radially symmetric\ndistributions of MNPs. The weighting functions allow calculation of the radial\nprofile of the absorbed dose in the cell nucleus as well as the mean dose and\nthe mean square of the dose in the nucleus. The latter two quantities determine\ncell survival according to the LEM. The weighting functions are applied to\nisolated cells in a localized MNP distribution, cells in solution, and densely\npacked cells in tissue. It is shown that only for the idealistic case of\ncomplete uptake of MNPs it is sufficient to consider an isolated cell, as this\notherwise leads to a significant underestimation in more realistic situations.\nIn the case of cells in tissue, the MNP concentration within the range of\nsecondary particles around the cell must be taken into account. Different\npacking densities of the cells may lead to values differing by up to 30% for\nthe mean dose in the cell nucleus, depending on the conceived scenario for the\nuptake of MNPs.

In\nparticular, this coupling gives rise to a temperature-dependent absorption tail\nthat reshapes the global spectral spectrum.

Evaluated on a real-world dataset of\n1,400+ math MCQs, LookAlike achieves 51.6% accuracy in distractor generation\nand 57.2% in error generation under LLM-as-a-judge evaluation, outperforming an\nexisting state-of-the-art method (45.6% / 47.7%).

Existing black-box text-based adversarial attacks\nare ill-suited for evidence-based misinformation detection systems, as these\nattacks primarily focus on token-level substitutions involving gradient or\nlogit-based optimization strategies, which are incapable of fooling the\nmulti-component nature of these detection systems. These systems incorporate\nboth retrieval and claim-evidence comparison modules, which requires attacks to\nbreak the retrieval of evidence and/or the comparison module so that it draws\nincorrect inferences. We present CAMOUFLAGE, an iterative, LLM-driven approach\nthat employs a two-agent system, a Prompt Optimization Agent and an Attacker\nAgent, to create adversarial claim rewritings that manipulate evidence\nretrieval and mislead claim-evidence comparison, effectively bypassing the\nsystem without altering the meaning of the claim. The Attacker Agent produces\nsemantically equivalent rewrites that attempt to mislead detectors, while the\nPrompt Optimization Agent analyzes failed attack attempts and refines the\nprompt of the Attacker to guide subsequent rewrites. This enables larger\nstructural and stylistic transformations of the text rather than token-level\nsubstitutions, adapting the magnitude of changes based on previous outcomes.\nUnlike existing approaches, CAMOUFLAGE optimizes its attack solely based on\nbinary model decisions to guide its rewriting process, eliminating the need for\nclassifier logits or extensive querying. We evaluate CAMOUFLAGE on four\nsystems, including two recent academic systems and two real-world APIs, with an\naverage attack success rate of 46.92\\% while preserving textual coherence and\nsemantic equivalence to the original claims.",

We leverage the\nk-means Gaussian-mixture method (KGMM) to robustly estimate the score function\n-- the gradient of the logarithm of the steady-state probability density.

When discrepancies in\naccuracy arise, OODTE iteratively isolates the responsible optimization pass by\nrepeating the process at a finer granularity. We applied OODTE to 130\nwell-known models from the official ONNX Model Hub, spanning diverse tasks\nincluding classification, object detection, semantic segmentation, text\nsummarization, question answering, and sentiment analysis. Our evaluation\nrevealed that 9.2% of the model instances either caused the optimizer to crash\nor led to the generation of invalid models using default optimization\nstrategies.

Incorporating\nthese hydrogels with high-performance zinc salts, such as zinc triflate\n(Zn(OTf)2), resulted in impressive stability, with the symmetric cell\ndemonstrating over 4000 hours of uniform and stable voltage profile under 1\nmA/cm2 and low overpotential of around 53 mV cycling with CSAM. The full-cell\nbattery with PBI-T membrane showed the highest durability and capacity compared\nto CSAM-T and PAM-T, due to the greater availability of free protons for\nstoring zinc in the cathode.",

This limitation becomes particularly\nevident in urban environments, where UAVs face vulnerability to jamming attacks\nand where LoS connectivity is frequently compromised by buildings and other\nphysical obstructions. This paper introduces DET-FAIR- WINGS (\nDetection-Enhanced Transformer Framework for AI-Resilient Wireless Networks in\nGround UAV Systems), a novel solution designed to enhance reliability in UAV\ncommunications under attacks.

While\nSAR sensors capture data in all-weather conditions as high-resolution images,\ndifferentiating water and water-like surfaces from SAR images is not\nstraightforward. Inland water bodies, such as large river basins, have complex\ngeometry, which adds to the challenge of segmentation.

    "abstract": "This study investigates whether individuals can learn to accurately\ndiscriminate between human-written and AI-produced texts when provided with\nimmediate feedback, and if they can use this feedback to recalibrate their\nself-perceived competence. We also explore the specific criteria individuals\nrely upon when making these decisions, focusing on textual style and perceived\nreadability.\n  We used GPT-4o to generate several hundred texts across various genres and\ntext types comparable to Koditex, a multi-register corpus of human-written\ntexts. We then presented randomized text pairs to 254 Czech native speakers who\nidentified which text was human-written and which was AI-generated.\nParticipants were randomly assigned to two conditions: one receiving immediate\nfeedback after each trial, the other receiving no feedback until experiment\ncompletion. We recorded accuracy in identification, confidence levels, response\ntimes, and judgments about text readability along with demographic data and\nparticipants' engagement with AI technologies prior to the experiment.\n  Participants receiving immediate feedback showed significant improvement in\naccuracy and confidence calibration. Participants initially held incorrect\nassumptions about AI-generated text features, including expectations about\nstylistic rigidity and readability. Notably, without feedback, participants\nmade the most errors precisely when feeling most confident -- an issue largely\nresolved among the feedback group.\n  The ability to differentiate between human and AI-generated texts can be\neffectively learned through targeted training with explicit feedback, which\nhelps correct misconceptions about AI stylistic features and readability, as\nwell as potential other variables that were not explored, while facilitating\nmore accurate self-assessment. This finding might be particularly important in\neducational contexts.",

In order to derive the fundamental parameters age, distance,\nreddening, and the total-to-selective absorption coefficient, we employed a\nBayesian isochrone fitting. Age and metallicity are mainly constrained by the\nturn-off morphology, thanks to the unprecedented quality of the proper-motion\ncleaned photometry. The two clusters show remarkably similar Colour-Magnitude\nDiagrams. We derived an age of 11+-0.5 Gyr with a solar metallicity for both\nclusters. The reddening for NGC 6528 and NGC 6553 is E(B-V) = 0.63 and 0.76 and\nthe distances from the Sun are d = 7.85 and 5.1 kpc, respectively, recalling\nthat distances strictly depend on the adopted total-to-selective absorption\nparameter. The age of these metal-rich clusters is about 2 Gyr younger than the\nmoderately metal-poor bulge clusters. The ages and metallicities are remarkably\nidentical to that of the bulk of bulge field stars.",

    "abstract": "The Markov Decision Process (MDP) is a popular framework for sequential\ndecision-making problems, and uncertainty quantification is an essential\ncomponent of it to learn optimal decision-making strategies. In particular, a\nBayesian framework is used to maintain beliefs about the optimal decisions and\nthe unknown ingredients of the model, which are also to be learned from the\ndata, such as the rewards and state dynamics. However, many existing Bayesian\napproaches for learning the optimal decision-making strategy are based on\nunrealistic modelling assumptions and utilise approximate inference techniques.\nThis raises doubts whether the benefits of Bayesian uncertainty quantification\nare fully realised or can be relied upon.\n  We focus on infinite-horizon and undiscounted MDPs, with finite state and\naction spaces, and a terminal state. We provide a full Bayesian framework, from\nmodelling to inference to decision-making. For modelling, we introduce a\nlikelihood function with minimal assumptions for learning the optimal\naction-value function based on Bellman's optimality equations, analyse its\nproperties, and clarify connections to existing works. For deterministic\nrewards, the likelihood is degenerate and we introduce artificial observation\nnoise to relax it, in a controlled manner, to facilitate more efficient Monte\nCarlo-based inference. For inference, we propose an adaptive sequential Monte\nCarlo algorithm to both sample from and adjust the sequence of relaxed\nposterior distributions. For decision-making, we choose actions using samples\nfrom the posterior distribution over the optimal strategies. While commonly\ndone, we provide new insight that clearly shows that it is a generalisation of\nThompson sampling from multi-arm bandit problems. Finally, we evaluate our\nframework on the Deep Sea benchmark problem and demonstrate the exploration\nbenefits of posterior sampling in MDPs.",

Recent advancements in foundation models for video\nobject segmentation, such as Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2), offer a\npotential opportunity to significantly speed up the annotation process by\nmanually annotating one or a few slices and then propagating target masks\nacross the entire volume. However, the performance of SAM 2 in this context\nvaries. Our experiments show that relying on a single memory bank and attention\nmodule is prone to error propagation, particularly at boundary regions where\nthe target is present in the previous slice but absent in the current one. To\naddress this problem, we propose Short-Long Memory SAM 2 (SLM-SAM 2), a novel\narchitecture that integrates distinct short-term and long-term memory banks\nwith separate attention modules to improve segmentation accuracy. We evaluate\nSLM-SAM 2 on three public datasets covering organs, bones, and muscles across\nMRI and CT modalities. We show that the proposed method markedly outperforms\nthe default SAM 2, achieving average Dice Similarity Coefficient improvement of\n0.14 and 0.11 in the scenarios when 5 volumes and 1 volume are available for\nthe initial adaptation, respectively.

    "abstract": "We present an open-vocabulary and zero-shot method for arbitrary referring\nexpression segmentation (RES), targeting input expressions that are more\ngeneral than what prior works were designed to handle. Specifically, our inputs\nencompass both object- and part-level labels as well as implicit references\npointing to properties or qualities of object/part function, design, style,\nmaterial, etc. Our model, coined RESAnything, leverages Chain-of-Thoughts (CoT)\nreasoning, where the key idea is attribute prompting. We generate detailed\ndescriptions of object/part attributes including shape, color, and location for\npotential segment proposals through systematic prompting of a large language\nmodel (LLM), where the proposals are produced by a foundational image\nsegmentation model. Our approach encourages deep reasoning about object or part\nattributes related to function, style, design, etc., enabling the system to\nhandle implicit queries without any part annotations for training or\nfine-tuning. As the first zero-shot and LLM-based RES method, RESAnything\nachieves clearly superior performance among zero-shot methods on traditional\nRES benchmarks and significantly outperforms existing methods on challenging\nscenarios involving implicit queries and complex part-level relations. Finally,\nwe contribute a new benchmark dataset to offer ~3K carefully curated RES\ninstances to assess part-level, arbitrary RES solutions.",

In this paper, we propose an\ninnovative three-step framework for intent-driven network management based on\nGenerative AI (GenAI) algorithms. First, we fine-tune a Large Language Model\n(LLM) on a custom dataset using a Quantized Low-Rank Adapter (QLoRA) to enable\nmemory-efficient intent processing within limited computational resources. A\nRetrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) module is included to support dynamic\ndecision-making.

Our intent guidance and processing approach improves\nBERTScore by 6% and the semantic similarity score by 9% compared to the base\nLLM model. Again, the proposed predictive intent validation approach can\nsuccessfully rule out the performance-degrading intents with an average of 88%\naccuracy.

The observations caught\nan extraordinary event on 2023 November 10-18, when the degree of linear\npolarization of optical synchrotron radiation reached a record value of 47.5%.\nIn stark contrast, the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) found that the\nX-ray (Compton scattering or hadron-induced) emission was polarized at less\nthan 7.4% (3sigma confidence level).

Furthermore,\nthe multiwavelength flux and polarization variability, featuring an extremely\nprominent rise and decay of the optical polarization degree, is interpreted for\nthe first time by the relaxation of a magnetic \"spring\" embedded in the newly\ninjected plasma.

    "abstract": "High-quality fundus images provide essential anatomical information for\nclinical screening and ophthalmic disease diagnosis. Yet, due to hardware\nlimitations, operational variability, and patient compliance, fundus images\noften suffer from low resolution and signal-to-noise ratio. Recent years have\nwitnessed promising progress in fundus image enhancement. However, existing\nworks usually focus on restoring structural details or global characteristics\nof fundus images, lacking a unified image enhancement framework to recover\ncomprehensive multi-scale information. Moreover, few methods pinpoint the\ntarget of image enhancement, e.g., lesions, which is crucial for medical\nimage-based diagnosis. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-scale\ntarget-aware representation learning framework (MTRL-FIE) for efficient fundus\nimage enhancement. Specifically, we propose a multi-scale feature encoder (MFE)\nthat employs wavelet decomposition to embed both low-frequency structural\ninformation and high-frequency details. Next, we design a structure-preserving\nhierarchical decoder (SHD) to fuse multi-scale feature embeddings for real\nfundus image restoration. SHD integrates hierarchical fusion and group\nattention mechanisms to achieve adaptive feature fusion while retaining local\nstructural smoothness. Meanwhile, a target-aware feature aggregation (TFA)\nmodule is used to enhance pathological regions and reduce artifacts.\nExperimental results on multiple fundus image datasets demonstrate the\neffectiveness and generalizability of MTRL-FIE for fundus image enhancement.\nCompared to state-of-the-art methods, MTRL-FIE achieves superior enhancement\nperformance with a more lightweight architecture. Furthermore, our approach\ngeneralizes to other ophthalmic image processing tasks without supervised\nfine-tuning, highlighting its potential for clinical applications.",

    "abstract": "The global surge in social inequalities is one of the most pressing issues of\nour times. The spatial expression of social inequalities at city scale gives\nrise to urban segregation, a common phenomenon across different local and\ncultural contexts. The increasing popularity of Big Data and computational\nmodels has inspired a growing number of computational social science studies\nthat analyze, evaluate, and issue policy recommendations for urban segregation.\nToday's wealth in information and computational power could inform urban\nplanning for equity. However, as we show here, segregation research is\nepistemologically interdependent with prevalent economic theories which\noverfocus on individual responsibility while neglecting systemic processes.\nThis individualistic bias is also engrained in computational models of urban\nsegregation. Through several contemporary examples of how Big Data -- and the\nassumptions underlying its usage -- influence (de)segregation patterns and\npolicies, our essay tells a cautionary tale. We highlight how a lack of\nconsideration for data ethics can lead to the creation of computational models\nthat have a real-life, further marginalizing impact on disadvantaged groups.\nWith this essay, our aim is to develop a better discernment of the pitfalls and\npotentials of computational approaches to urban segregation, thereby fostering\na conscious focus on systemic thinking about urban inequalities. We suggest\nsetting an agenda for research and collective action that is directed at\ndemobilizing individualistic bias, informing our thinking about urban\nsegregation, but also more broadly our efforts to create sustainable cities and\ncommunities.",

    "abstract": "Rotating black holes can generate boson clouds via superradiance when the\nboson's Compton wavelength is comparable to the black hole's size. In binary\nsystems, these clouds can produce distinctive observational imprints. Recent\nstudies accounting for nonlinearities induced by orbital backreaction suggest\nthat if the binary forms at a large separation, resonance transitions can\nsignificantly deplete the cloud, minimizing later observational consequences\nexcept for very specific orbital inclinations. In this paper, we extend this\nframework to supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs), considering the\ninfluence of their astrophysical evolutionary histories. We find that, before\nentering the gravitational wave (GW) radiation stage, the additional energy\nloss channels can accelerate orbital evolution. This acceleration makes\nhyperfine resonant transitions inefficient, allowing a sufficient portion of\nthe cloud to remain for later direct observations. We further discuss the\nionization effects and cloud depletion occurring at this stage. Based on these\ntheoretical insights, we explore how multi-messenger observations for SMBHBs\ncan be utilized to detect the ionization effects of boson clouds by examining\nchanges in the orbital period decay rate via electromagnetic measurements and\nvariations in GW strain over a wide frequency band. Our findings reveal a\ncomplex dependence on the binary's total mass, mass ratio, and boson mass,\nemphasizing the significant role of astrophysical evolution histories in\ndetecting boson clouds within binaries.",

To overcome the large dimensionality of\nthe parameter space and the complexity of the regularization functional,\n{sparisty-promoting} techniques for both deterministic and hierarchical\nBayesian regularization rely on solving a sequence of high-dimensional\niteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS) problems on a lower-dimensional\nsubspace. Generalized Krylov subspace (GKS) methods are a particularly potent\nclass of hybrid Krylov schemes that efficiently solve sequences of IRLS\nproblems by projecting large-scale problems into a relatively small subspace\nand successively enlarging it. We refer to methods that promote sparsity and\nuse GKS as S-GKS. A disadvantage of S-GKS methods is their slow convergence. In\nthis work, we propose techniques that improve the convergence of S-GKS methods\nby combining them with priorconditioning, which we refer to as PS-GKS.\nSpecifically, integrating the PS-GKS method into the IAS algorithm allows us to\nautomatically select the shape/rate parameter of the involved generalized gamma\nhyper-prior, which is often fine-tuned otherwise. Furthermore, we proposed and\ninvestigated variations of the proposed PS-GKS method, including restarting and\nrecycling (resPS-GKS and recPS-GKS). These respectively leverage restarted and\nrecycled subspaces to overcome situations when memory limitations of storing\nthe basis vectors are a concern. We provide a thorough theoretical analysis\nshowing the benefits of priorconditioning for sparsity-promoting inverse\nproblems. Numerical experiment are used to illustrate that the proposed PS-GKS\nmethod and its variants are competitive with or outperform other existing\nhybrid Krylov methods.",

Instance-level complexity stems from multiple instances of the\nsame category coexisting in a scene, leading to distractions during grounding.\nTo address these challenges, we propose a novel weakly-supervised grounding\napproach that explicitly differentiates between categories and instances.

    "abstract": "Classification of multi-dimensional time series from real-world systems\nrequire fine-grained learning of complex features such as cross-dimensional\ndependencies and intra-class variations-all under the practical challenge of\nlow training data availability. However, standard deep learning (DL) struggles\nto learn generalizable features in low-data environments due to model\noverfitting. We propose a versatile yet data-efficient framework, Intelligently\nAugmented Contrastive Tensor Factorization (ITA-CTF), to learn effective\nrepresentations from multi-dimensional time series. The CTF module learns core\nexplanatory components of the time series (e.g., sensor factors, temporal\nfactors), and importantly, their joint dependencies. Notably, unlike standard\ntensor factorization (TF), the CTF module incorporates a new contrastive loss\noptimization to induce similarity learning and class-awareness into the learnt\nrepresentations for better classification performance. To strengthen this\ncontrastive learning, the preceding ITA module generates targeted but\ninformative augmentations that highlight realistic intra-class patterns in the\noriginal data, while preserving class-wise properties. This is achieved by\ndynamically sampling a \"soft\" class prototype to guide the warping of each\nquery data sample, which results in an augmentation that is intelligently\npattern-mixed between the \"soft\" class prototype and the query sample. These\naugmentations enable the CTF module to recognize complex intra-class variations\ndespite the limited original training data, and seek out invariant class-wise\nproperties for accurate classification performance. The proposed method is\ncomprehensively evaluated on five different classification tasks. Compared to\nstandard TF and several DL benchmarks, notable performance improvements up to\n18.7% were achieved.",

This paper investigates a practical pinching-antennas system in\nmulti-waveguide scenarios, where pinching antennas are installed at\npre-configured discrete positions to serve downlink users with non-orthogonal\nmultiple access (NOMA). To improve system throughput, a sophisticated\noptimization problem is formulated by jointly considering waveguide assignment,\nantenna activation, successive interference cancellation (SIC) decoding order\ndesign, and power allocation. By treating waveguide assignment and antenna\nactivation as two coalition-formation games, a novel game-theoretic algorithm\nis developed, in which the optimal decoding order is derived and incorporated.\nFor power allocation, monotonic optimization and successive convex\napproximation (SCA) are employed to construct global optimal and low-complexity\nsolutions, respectively.

Furthermore, our algorithm\nmaintains the same average rejection rate as existing techniques and passes all\nstandard statistical tests for randomness quality. FPGA implementation on\nArtix-7 demonstrates a 33.14% reduction in energy, 33.32% lower latency, and\n0.28% fewer slices compared to SampleNTT. Our results confirm that Modified\nSampleNTT is an efficient and practical alternative for uniform polynomial\nsampling in PQC schemes such as Kyber, especially for low-power security\nprocessors.",

The Black-Litterman model offers a\npowerful Bayesian approach to adjust equilibrium returns using investor views\nto form a posterior expectation along with market priors. Mainstream research\nmainly generates subjective views through statistical models or machine\nlearning methods, among which hybrid models combined with decomposition\nalgorithms perform well. However, most hybrid models do not pay enough\nattention to noise, and time series decomposition methods based on single\nvariables make it difficult to fully utilize information between multiple\nvariables. Multivariate decomposition also has problems of low efficiency and\npoor component quality. In this study, we propose a novel hybrid forecasting\nmodel SSA-MAEMD-TCN to automate and improve the view generation process. The\nproposed model combines Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) for denoising,\nMultivariate Aligned Empirical Mode Decomposition (MA-EMD) for\nfrequency-aligned decomposition, and Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs) for\ndeep sequence learning to capture complex temporal patterns across multiple\nfinancial indicators. Empirical tests on the Nasdaq 100 Index stocks show a\nsignificant improvement in forecasting performance compared to baseline models\nbased on MAEMD and MEMD.

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a new formulation for material homogenization of\nthin-shell microstructures. It addresses important challenges that limit the\nquality of previous approaches: methods that fit the energy response neglect\nvisual impact, methods that fit the stress response are not conservative, and\nall of them are limited to a low-dimensional interplay between deformation\nmodes. The new formulation is rooted on the following design principles: the\nmaterial energy functions are conservative by definition, they are formulated\non the high-dimensional membrane and bending domain to capture the complex\ninterplay of the different deformation modes, the material function domain is\nmaximally aligned with the training data, and the material parameters and the\noptimization are formulated on stress instead of energy for better correlation\nwith visual impact. The key novelty of our formulation is a new type of\nhigh-order RBF interpolant for polar coordinates, which allows us to fulfill\nall the design principles. We design a material function using this novel\ninterpolant, as well as an overall homogenization workflow. Our results\ndemonstrate very accurate fitting of diverse microstructure behaviors, both\nquantitatively and qualitatively superior to previous work.",

To this end, this paper\naims to investigate a novel and low-complexity solution towards minimizing the\nPAPR with the aid of a unified premodulation data spreading paradigm. It\nanalyze four spreading techniques namely, Walsh-Hadamard transform (WHT),\nDiscrete Cosine transform (DCT), Zadoff-Chu transform (ZC), and Interleaved\nDiscrete Fourier transform (IDFT), which assist in preallocating energy prior\nto OCDM and AFDM modulation.

This\ncapability allows different PAs to view the same target from different angles\nacross time, thereby introducing target diversity, which is a key advantage\nover conventional fixed antenna arrays. To quantify the sensing reliability, we\nadopt the outage probability as a performance metric, capturing the likelihood\nthat the accumulated radar echo signal power falls below a detection threshold.\nIn contrast to traditional ISAC models that assume deterministic sensing\nchannels, we explicitly account for the look-angle dependence of radar\ncross-section (RCS) by modeling it as a random variable. We ensure the\nlong-term quality-of-service (QoS) for communication users by enforcing an\naccumulated data rate constraint over time. We derive an exact closed-form\nexpression for the sensing outage probability based on the distribution of\nweighted sums of exponentially distributed random variables. Since the\nresulting expression is highly non-convex and intractable for optimization, we\nuse a tractable upper bound based on the Chernoff inequality and formulate a PA\nactivation optimization problem. A successive convex approximation (SCA)\nframework is proposed to efficiently solve the formulated problem. Numerical\nresults show that dynamically activating different PAs across time slots\nsignificantly enhances sensing reliability compared to repeatedly activating\nthe same PA at a fixed position and conventional antenna selection schemes,\nrespectively.

    "abstract": "Surgical workflow recognition is vital for automating tasks, supporting\ndecision-making, and training novice surgeons, ultimately improving patient\nsafety and standardizing procedures. However, data corruption can lead to\nperformance degradation due to issues like occlusion from bleeding or smoke in\nsurgical scenes and problems with data storage and transmission. In this case,\nwe explore a robust graph-based multimodal approach to integrating vision and\nkinematic data to enhance accuracy and reliability. Vision data captures\ndynamic surgical scenes, while kinematic data provides precise movement\ninformation, overcoming limitations of visual recognition under adverse\nconditions. We propose a multimodal Graph Representation network with\nAdversarial feature Disentanglement (GRAD) for robust surgical workflow\nrecognition in challenging scenarios with domain shifts or corrupted data.\nSpecifically, we introduce a Multimodal Disentanglement Graph Network that\ncaptures fine-grained visual information while explicitly modeling the complex\nrelationships between vision and kinematic embeddings through graph-based\nmessage modeling. To align feature spaces across modalities, we propose a\nVision-Kinematic Adversarial framework that leverages adversarial training to\nreduce modality gaps and improve feature consistency. Furthermore, we design a\nContextual Calibrated Decoder, incorporating temporal and contextual priors to\nenhance robustness against domain shifts and corrupted data. Extensive\ncomparative and ablation experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our model\nand proposed modules. Moreover, our robustness experiments show that our method\neffectively handles data corruption during storage and transmission, exhibiting\nexcellent stability and robustness. Our approach aims to advance automated\nsurgical workflow recognition, addressing the complexities and dynamism\ninherent in surgical procedures.",

With modern LLMs\nsupporting larger context windows, a natural question arises: can we feed\nentire document translations into an LLM for quality assessment? Ideally,\nevaluation should be invariant to text length, producing consistent error spans\nregardless of input granularity. However, our analysis shows that text length\nsignificantly impacts evaluation: longer texts lead to fewer error spans and\nreduced system ranking accuracy. To address this limitation, we evaluate\nseveral strategies, including granularity-aligned prompting, Focus Sentence\nPrompting (FSP), and a fine-tuning approach to better align LLMs with the\nevaluation task.

The results, over 1000 images at separate\nepochs, have been compiled into a movie.

The NFI is designed to provide\nstatistical estimations of growing stock, gains and losses at the national or\nsubnational levels but is unable, in its classical form, to provide detailed\nspatial outlook, such as on abrupt losses during fires, droughts and insect\nattacks. A continuing removal of CO2 from the atmosphere by the French forests\noccurred from 1990 to 2022, because harvest and mortality CO2 losses remained\nsmaller than CO2 removals by forest growth and the increase in forest area\n(70,000 ha per year but insignificant in terms of increased carbon stocks at\npresent). The CO2 removal by forests was 49.3 MtCO2 yr-1 in 1990, increased to\nreach a peak of 74.1 MtCO2 yr-1 in 2008 and then quickly decreased down to 37.8\nMton CO2 yr-1 in 2022.

Distributed estimation\nresilient to such conditions is the topic of this paper. By representing the\nsensor network as a graph and exploiting its inherent structural properties, we\nintroduce novel techniques that enhance the robustness of distributed\nestimators. As compared to the literature, the proposed estimator (i) relaxes\nthe network connectivity of most existing single time-scale estimators and (ii)\nreduces the communication load of the existing double time-scale estimators by\navoiding the inner consensus loop.\n  On the other hand, the sensors might be subject to faults or attacks,\nresulting in biased measurements.

Therefore, we propose resilient design on the definitions\nof $q$-node-connectivity and $q$-link-connectivity, which capture robust\nstrong-connectivity under link or sensor node failure.

However, such systems are\nfundamentally governed by the Point Spread Function (PSF), which dictates how a\npoint source contributes to the final captured signal. Traditional lensless\ntechniques often require explicit calibrations and extensive pre-processing,\nrelying on static or approximate PSF models. These rigid strategies can result\nin limited adaptability to real-world challenges, including noise, system\nimperfections, and dynamic scene variations, thus impeding high-fidelity\nreconstruction. In this paper, we propose LensNet, an end-to-end deep learning\nframework that integrates spatial-domain and frequency-domain representations\nin a unified pipeline. Central to our approach is a learnable Coded Mask\nSimulator (CMS) that enables dynamic, data-driven estimation of the PSF during\ntraining, effectively mitigating the shortcomings of fixed or sparsely\ncalibrated kernels. By embedding a Wiener filtering component, LensNet refines\nglobal structure and restores fine-scale details, thus alleviating the\ndependency on multiple handcrafted pre-processing steps. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate LensNet's robust performance and superior reconstruction quality\ncompared to state-of-the-art methods, particularly in preserving high-frequency\ndetails and attenuating noise.

Previous studies have investigated technical\naspects, such as the influence of cuts on pausing behavior, but the impact of\nvisual complexity remains understudied. In this paper, we address this gap and\npropose a novel approach centered on visual complexity, defined as the number\nof visually distinguishable and meaningful elements in a video frame, such as\nmathematical equations, chemical formulas, or graphical representations. Our\nstudy introduces a fine-grained taxonomy of visual objects in educational\nvideos, expanding on previous classifications. Applying this taxonomy to 25\nvideos from physics and chemistry, we examine the relationship between visual\ncomplexity and user behavior, including pauses, in-video navigation, and\nsession dropouts. The results indicate that increased visual complexity,\nespecially of textual elements, correlates with more frequent pauses, rewinds,\nand dropouts. The results offer a deeper understanding of how video design\naffects user behavior in real-world scenarios. Our work has implications for\noptimizing educational videos, particularly in STEM fields. We make our code\npublicly available (https://github.com/TIBHannover/from_formulas_to_figures).",

A counterpart of this\nphenomenon in the time domain has been noted in the context of epoch-wise\ntraining, viz., the test error decreases with the number of iterates, then\nincreases, then decreases again. Another anomalous phenomenon is that of\n\\textit{grokking} wherein two regimes of descent are interrupted by a third\nregime wherein the mean loss remains almost constant.

While the existing methods enable synthesizing\ngestures cooperated by individual self-talking, they overlook the practicality\nof concurrent gesture modeling with two-person interactive conversations.\nMoreover, the lack of high-quality datasets with concurrent co-speech gestures\nalso limits handling this issue. To fulfill this goal, we first construct a\nlarge-scale concurrent co-speech gesture dataset that contains more than 7M\nframes for diverse two-person interactive posture sequences, dubbed GES-Inter.\nAdditionally, we propose Co$^3$Gesture, a novel framework that enables coherent\nconcurrent co-speech gesture synthesis including two-person interactive\nmovements. Considering the asymmetric body dynamics of two speakers, our\nframework is built upon two cooperative generation branches conditioned on\nseparated speaker audio.

TIM\ncan effectively model the temporal association representation between two\nspeakers' gesture sequences as interaction guidance and fuse it into the\nconcurrent gesture generation.

Recent studies\nhave explored compact, head-worn devices for HR and HRV monitoring to improve\nusability and reduce stigma. However, this approach is challenged by the\ncurrent reliance on wet electrodes, which limits usability, the weakness of\near-derived signals, making HR/HRV extraction more complex, and the\nincompatibility of current algorithms for embedded deployment. This work\nintroduces a single-ear wearable system for real-time ECG (Electrocardiogram)\nparameter estimation, which directly runs on BioGAP, an energy-efficient device\nfor biosignal acquisition and processing. By combining SoA in-ear electrode\ntechnology, an optimized DeepMF algorithm, and BioGAP, our proposed\nsubject-independent approach allows for robust extraction of HR/HRV parameters\ndirectly on the device with just 36.7 uJ/inference at comparable performance\nwith respect to the current state-of-the-art architecture, achieving 0.49 bpm\nand 25.82 ms for HR/HRV mean errors, respectively and an estimated battery life\nof 36h with a total system power consumption of 7.6 mW. Clinical relevance: The\nability to reconstruct ECG signals and extract HR and HRV paves the way for\ncontinuous, unobtrusive cardiovascular monitoring with head-worn devices. In\nparticular, the integration of cardiovascular measurements in everyday-use\ndevices (such as earbuds) has potential in continuous at-home monitoring to\nenable early detection of cardiovascular irregularities.",

    "abstract": "In monocular videos that capture dynamic scenes, estimating the 3D geometry\nof video contents has been a fundamental challenge in computer vision.\nSpecifically, the task is significantly challenged by the object motion, where\nexisting models are limited to predict only partial attributes of the dynamic\nscenes, such as depth or pointmaps spanning only over a pair of frames. Since\nthese attributes are inherently noisy under multiple frames, test-time global\noptimizations are often employed to fully recover the geometry, which is liable\nto failure and incurs heavy inference costs. To address the challenge, we\npresent a new model, coined MMP, to estimate the geometry in a feed-forward\nmanner, which produces a dynamic pointmap representation that evolves over\nmultiple frames. Specifically, based on the recent Siamese architecture, we\nintroduce a new trajectory encoding module to project point-wise dynamics on\nthe representation for each frame, which can provide significantly improved\nexpressiveness for dynamic scenes. In our experiments, we find MMP can achieve\nstate-of-the-art quality in feed-forward pointmap prediction, e.g., 15.1%\nenhancement in the regression error.",

To this end, we propose the Shapley Value-based Non-Uniform\nPruning (SV-NUP) method for LLMs. This approach quantifies the contribution of\neach transformer layer to the overall model performance, enabling the\nassignment of tailored pruning budgets to different layers to retain critical\nparameters.

Extensive experiments on\nvarious LLMs including LLaMA-v1, LLaMA-v2 and OPT demonstrate the effectiveness\nof the proposed approach.

    "abstract": "In the past, the mirror asymmetry parameter has been proposed as a probing\nmechanism for the presence of beyond the Standard Model second-class currents\nin nuclear beta decay transitions. However, this was hindered by large\nuncertainties in the required nuclear structure correction terms. Recently, a\nnew calculation of these corrections attempted, but could not fully explain the\nnegative mirror asymmetry between the $^{28}$Al($\\beta^-$)$^{28m}$Si and\n$^{28}$P($\\beta^+$)$^{28m}$Si decays. To put the mirror asymmetry parameter on\na more solid footing, the half-life of $^{28}$Al was measured for the first\ntime using a radioactive ion beam at the Nuclear Science Laboratory of the\nUniversity of Notre Dame. The new result, $t_{1/2}=$134.432(34) s, is\nconsistent with most of the past data except for one highly discrepant\nmeasurement.

This study employed a\nspatiotemporal wildfire impact assessment method based on daily satellite fire\ndetections from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS),\ninfrastructure data from OpenStreetMap, and high-resolution dasymetric\npopulation modeling to capture the dynamic progression of wildfire events in\ntwo distinct Los Angeles County regions, Eaton and Palisades, which occurred in\nJanuary 2025. The modelling result estimated that the total direct economic\nlosses reached approximately 4.86 billion USD with the highest single-day\nlosses recorded on January 8 in both districts. Population exposure reached a\ndaily maximum of 4,342 residents in Eaton and 3,926 residents in Palisades. Our\nmodelling results highlight early, severe ecological and infrastructural damage\nin Palisades, as well as delayed, intense social and economic disruptions in\nEaton. This tri-environmental framework underscores the necessity for tailored,\nequitable wildfire management strategies, enabling more effective emergency\nresponses, targeted urban planning, and community resilience enhancement.

In our experiments, we evaluate MAP using a sequential rating\nprediction task under two scenarios: single domain, where memory and tasks are\nfrom the same category (e.g., movies), and cross-domain (e.g., memory from\nmovies and recommendation tasks in books). The results show that MAP\noutperforms regular LLM-based recommenders that integrate user history directly\nthrough prompt design.

These limitations become particularly\nproblematic in complex, dynamic networks with high uncertainty and long-term\nplanning requirements. To address these limitations, in this paper, a novel\nworld model-based learning framework is proposed to minimize\npacket-completeness-aware age of information (CAoI) in a vehicular network.\nParticularly, a challenging representative scenario is considered pertaining to\na millimeter-wave (mmWave) vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication network,\nwhich is characterized by high mobility, frequent signal blockages, and\nextremely short coherence time. Then, a world model framework is proposed to\njointly learn a dynamic model of the mmWave V2X environment and use it to\nimagine trajectories for learning how to perform link scheduling. In\nparticular, the long-term policy is learned in differentiable imagined\ntrajectories instead of environment interactions. Moreover, owing to its\nimagination abilities, the world model can jointly predict time-varying\nwireless data and optimize link scheduling in real-world wireless and V2X\nnetworks. Thus, during intervals without actual observations, the world model\nremains capable of making efficient decisions. Extensive experiments are\nperformed on a realistic simulator based on Sionna that integrates\nphysics-based end-to-end channel modeling, ray-tracing, and scene geometries\nwith material properties. Simulation results show that the proposed world model\nachieves a significant improvement in data efficiency, and achieves 26%\nimprovement and 16% improvement in CAoI, respectively, compared to the\nmodel-based RL (MBRL) method and the model-free RL (MFRL) method.",

Our\ntest for the HectoMAP objects with duplicated observations shows that RVSNUpy\nwith the universal template spectra yields the homogeneous redshift from the\nspectra obtained with different spectrographs. We highlight that RVSNUpy is a\npowerful redshift measurement tool for current and future large-scale\nspectroscopy surveys, including A-SPEC, DESI, 4MOST, and Subaru/PFS.",

    "abstract": "Operating robots in open-ended scenarios with diverse tasks is a crucial\nresearch and application direction in robotics. While recent progress in\nnatural language processing and large multimodal models has enhanced robots'\nability to understand complex instructions, robot manipulation still faces the\nprocedural skill dilemma and the declarative skill dilemma in open\nenvironments. Existing methods often compromise cognitive and executive\ncapabilities. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose RoBridge,\na hierarchical intelligent architecture for general robotic manipulation. It\nconsists of a high-level cognitive planner (HCP) based on a large-scale\npre-trained vision-language model (VLM), an invariant operable representation\n(IOR) serving as a symbolic bridge, and a generalist embodied agent (GEA).\nRoBridge maintains the declarative skill of VLM and unleashes the procedural\nskill of reinforcement learning, effectively bridging the gap between cognition\nand execution. RoBridge demonstrates significant performance improvements over\nexisting baselines, achieving a 75% success rate on new tasks and an 83%\naverage success rate in sim-to-real generalization using only five real-world\ndata samples per task. This work represents a significant step towards\nintegrating cognitive reasoning with physical execution in robotic systems,\noffering a new paradigm for general robotic manipulation.",

    "abstract": "Millisecond pulsars (MSPs) are prominent GeV $\\gamma$-ray emitters, but their\nemission mechanisms, especially during off-pulse phases and at high energies,\nremain debated. We analyze 38 MSPs using approximately 15 years of $Fermi$-LAT\ndata. Employing high-precision ephemerides and Bayesian Blocks algorithm, we\ndetect significant off-pulse emission from 15 MSPs. Spectral analysis reveals\nsignificant cutoffs in 10 of these, favoring a magnetospheric origin. The\nremaining 5 likely also have magnetospheric emission with cutoffs below current\nsensitivity. Phase-resolved spectral analysis for the 15 MSPs with off-pulse\nflux shows a significant correlation between cutoff energy ($E_{\\text{cut}}$)\nand average photon counts in 11 sources. We introduce a phase-resolved\npseudo-luminosity ($L$) and discover a novel, statistically significant linear\ncorrelation between $\\log_{10}(L)$ and $\\log_{10}(E_{\\text{cut}})$ across their\nphase bins, with the best-fit slope $\\alpha = 2.31^{+0.22}_{-0.25}$.\nFurthermore, we detect significant pulsed emission above 10 GeV from 9 MSPs\nwith off-pulse emission and 7 others (totaling 16 MSPs and tripling previous\ncataloged detections). Emission above 25 GeV is confirmed for PSR J0614$-$3329\nand newly detected for PSR J1536$-$4948, both of which also exhibit significant\noff-pulse emission. Their highest-energy photons ($\\sim$61 GeV and $\\sim$57\nGeV, respectively) coincide with pulse peaks. The co-existence of significant\noff-pulse emission and high-energy pulsed emission challenges standard Outer\nGap models, while the observed $\\log_{10}(L)$-$\\log_{10}(E_{\\text{cut}})$\ncorrelation may provide new evidence supporting the equatorial current sheet\nscenario.",

One of the major drawbacks of DPO is that it\ndoesn't induce granular scoring and treats all the segments of the responses\nwith equal propensity. However, this is not practically true for human\npreferences since even \"good\" responses have segments that may not be preferred\nby the annotator.

We explore the 2D-DPO alignment paradigm and the\nadvantages it provides over the standard DPO by comparing their win rates. It\nis observed that these methods, even though effective, are not robust to\nlabel/score noise.

While previous efforts have focused on\ndemographic fairness, the fairness of individual biological face components\nremains unexplored. In this paper, we focus on face component fairness, a\nfairness notion defined by biological face features. To our best knowledge, our\nwork is the first work to mitigate bias of face attribute prediction at the\nbiological feature level. In this work, we identify two key challenges in\noptimizing face component fairness: attribute label scarcity and attribute\ninter-dependencies, both of which limit the effectiveness of bias mitigation\nfrom previous approaches. To address these issues, we propose \\textbf{B}ayesian\n\\textbf{N}etwork-informed \\textbf{M}eta \\textbf{R}eweighting (BNMR), which\nincorporates a Bayesian Network calibrator to guide an adaptive\nmeta-learning-based sample reweighting process. During the training process of\nour approach, the Bayesian Network calibrator dynamically tracks model bias and\nencodes prior probabilities for face component attributes to overcome the above\nchallenges. To demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, we conduct extensive\nexperiments on a large-scale real-world human face dataset. Our results show\nthat BNMR is able to consistently outperform recent face bias mitigation\nbaselines. Moreover, our results suggest a positive impact of face component\nfairness on the commonly considered demographic fairness (e.g.,\n\\textit{gender}).

    "abstract": "Integrating heterogeneous biomedical data including imaging, omics, and\nclinical records supports accurate diagnosis and personalised care. Graph-based\nmodels fuse such non-Euclidean data by capturing spatial and relational\nstructure, yet clinical uptake requires regulator-ready interpretability. We\npresent the first technical survey of interpretable graph based models for\nmultimodal biomedical data, covering 26 studies published between Jan 2019 and\nSep 2024. Most target disease classification, notably cancer and rely on static\ngraphs from simple similarity measures, while graph-native explainers are rare;\npost-hoc methods adapted from non-graph domains such as gradient saliency, and\nSHAP predominate. We group existing approaches into four interpretability\nfamilies, outline trends such as graph-in-graph hierarchies, knowledge-graph\nedges, and dynamic topology learning, and perform a practical benchmark. Using\nan Alzheimer disease cohort, we compare Sensitivity Analysis, Gradient\nSaliency, SHAP and Graph Masking. SHAP and Sensitivity Analysis recover the\nbroadest set of known AD pathways and Gene-Ontology terms, whereas Gradient\nSaliency and Graph Masking surface complementary metabolic and transport\nsignatures. Permutation tests show all four beat random gene sets, but with\ndistinct trade-offs: SHAP and Graph Masking offer deeper biology at higher\ncompute cost, while Gradient Saliency and Sensitivity Analysis are quicker\nthough coarser. We also provide a step-by-step flowchart covering graph\nconstruction, explainer choice and resource budgeting to help researchers\nbalance transparency and performance. This review synthesises the state of\ninterpretable graph learning for multimodal medicine, benchmarks leading\ntechniques, and charts future directions, from advanced XAI tools to\nunder-studied diseases, serving as a concise reference for method developers\nand translational scientists.",

    "abstract": "Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) emerged as a key feature of\nnext-generation 6G wireless systems, allowing them to achieve high data rates\nand sensing accuracy. While prior research has primarily focused on addressing\ncommunication safety in ISAC systems, the equally critical issue of sensing\nsafety remains largely ignored. In this paper, a novel threat to the sensing\nsafety of ISAC vehicle networks is studied, whereby a malicious reconfigurable\nintelligent surface (RIS) is deployed to compromise the sensing functionality\nof a roadside unit (RSU). Specifically, a malicious attacker dynamically\nadjusts the phase shifts of an RIS to spoof the sensing outcomes of a vehicular\nuser (VU)'s echo delay, Doppler shift, and angle-of-departure (AoD). To achieve\nspoofing on Doppler shift estimation, a time-varying phase shift design on the\nRIS is proposed. Furthermore, the feasible spoofing frequency set with respect\nto the Doppler shift is analytical derived. Analytical results also demonstrate\nthat the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) of the AoD can be significantly\nmisled under spoofed Doppler shift estimation. Simulation results validate our\ntheoretical findings, showing that the RIS can induce a spoofed velocity\nestimation from 0.1 m/s to 14.9 m/s for a VU with velocity of 10 m/s, and can\ncause an AoD estimation error of up to 65^{\\circ} with only a 5^{\\circ} beam\nmisalignment.",

One key challenge in such\nsystems lies in meeting quality-of-service (QoS) requirements of vehicular\ncommunication links given limited network resources, particularly under\nimperfect channel state information (CSI) conditions caused by the highly\ndynamic environment. In this paper, a novel two-phase framework is proposed to\ninstill resilience into C-V2X networks under unknown imperfect CSI. The\nresilience of the C-V2X network is defined, quantified, and optimized the first\ntime through two principal dimensions: absorption phase and adaptation phase.\nSpecifically, the probability distribution function (PDF) of the imperfect CSI\nis estimated during the absorption phase through dedicated absorption power\nscheme and resource block (RB) assignment. The estimated PDF is further used to\nanalyze the interplay and reveal the tradeoff between these two phases. Then, a\nnovel metric named hazard rate (HR) is exploited to balance the C-V2X network's\nprioritization on absorption and adaptation. Finally, the estimated PDF is\nexploited in the adaptation phase to recover the network's QoS through a\nreal-time power allocation optimization. Simulation results demonstrate the\nsuperior capability of the proposed framework in sustaining the QoS of the\nC-V2X network under imperfect CSI. Specifically, in the adaptation phase, the\nproposed design reduces the vehicle-tovehicle (V2V) delay that exceeds QoS\nrequirement by 35% and 56%, and improves the average vehicle-to-infrastructure\n(V2I) throughput by 14% and 16% compared to the model-based and data-driven\nbenchmarks, respectively, without compromising the network's QoS in the\nabsorption phase.",

As a result, a scheme with several\nparameters was proposed to characterize the MOID variations as well as the\nrelative position information of the critical points along the orbits\nassociated with the minimum distances.

    "abstract": "Superconductivity in flat-band systems, governed by quantum metric of Bloch\nstates rather than the BCS framework, exhibits unique phenomena due to the\nvanishing electron group velocity. Here, we propose the vortex states and\nvortex size as direct probes to explore the quantum geometry effects in\nflat-band superconductors. We show that flat-band vortex bound states are\nsharply localized near the vortex core, and the energy gap between the lowest\ntwo bound states is on the order of the bulk superconducting gap. Both the\nspatial spread and energy scales of bound states are controlled by the\nflat-band's quantum metric length. Moreover, the vortex size at zero\ntemperature, set by the quantum metric length, is atomic in scale and\nindependent of interaction strength. Near $T_c$, the vortex size corresponds to\nthe Ginzburg-Landau coherence length, diverges as $\\xi\\sim\n\\sqrt{T_c/(T_c-T)}\\xi_0$, where $\\xi_0$ depends linearly on the quantum metric\nlength. Thus, the quantum metric serves as the lower bound for vortex state\nspread and vortex size. We also introduce perturbations to make the flat band\ndispersive, and distinguish flat-band vortices from BCS-like vortices. Our\nresults establish vortices as universal probes of quantum geometry in flat-band\nsuperconductors.",

While parametric solutions are known when $n=3$ and $n=4$, when $n >\n4$, only a finite number of numerical solutions, found by computer trials, are\nknown. In fact, efforts to find parametric solutions for $n > 4$ have so far\nbeen futile. In this paper we describe two methods of obtaining parametric\nsolutions of the problem, and we apply these methods to get several parametric\nsolutions when $n=5, 6, 7$ or $8$.

Most\nactive-sensing guided-wave methods rely on the assumption that a large dataset\ncan be collected, making them impractical when data collection is constrained\nby time or environmental factors. Meanwhile, although simulation results may\nlack the accuracy of real-world data, they are easier to obtain. In this\ncontext, models that integrate data from multiple sources have the potential to\ncombine the accuracy of experimental data with the convenience of simulated\ndata, without requiring large and potentially costly experimental datasets. The\ngoal of this work is to introduce and assess a probabilistic multi-fidelity\nGaussian process regression framework for damage state estimation via the use\nof both experimental and simulated guided waves. The main differences from\nprevious works include the integration of damage-sensitive features (damage\nindices, DIs) extracted from both experimental and numerical sources, as well\nas the use of a relatively small amount of real-world data. The proposed model\nwas validated by two test cases where multiple data sources exist.

    "abstract": "Visual domain adaptation aims to learn discriminative and domain-invariant\nrepresentation for an unlabeled target domain by leveraging knowledge from a\nlabeled source domain. Partial domain adaptation (PDA) is a general and\npractical scenario in which the target label space is a subset of the source\none. The challenges of PDA exist due to not only domain shift but also the\nnon-identical label spaces of domains. In this paper, a Soft-masked Semi-dual\nOptimal Transport (SSOT) method is proposed to deal with the PDA problem.\nSpecifically, the class weights of domains are estimated, and then a reweighed\nsource domain is constructed, which is favorable in conducting\nclass-conditional distribution matching with the target domain. A soft-masked\ntransport distance matrix is constructed by category predictions, which will\nenhance the class-oriented representation ability of optimal transport in the\nshared feature space. To deal with large-scale optimal transport problems, the\nsemi-dual formulation of the entropy-regularized Kantorovich problem is\nemployed since it can be optimized by gradient-based algorithms. Further, a\nneural network is exploited to approximate the Kantorovich potential due to its\nstrong fitting ability. This network parametrization also allows the\ngeneralization of the dual variable outside the supports of the input\ndistribution. The SSOT model is built upon neural networks, which can be\noptimized alternately in an end-to-end manner.

For 15-13-15 AGNRH segments, we observe both localized\nzigzag edge states and topologically protected interface states under\nlongitudinal electric fields, with the latter providing efficient tunneling\nchannels in contrast to the less conductive edge states. We further explore\nnonlinear charge transport through these interface states under Pauli spin\nblockade, showing that tunneling current spectra reveal charge stability\ndiagrams and Coulomb blockade oscillations, consistent with experimental\nfindings in other serial double quantum dot systems. Additionally, we examine\nthe impact of orbital offsets on tunneling current rectification and\ndemonstrate that significant current rectification is achieved over a wide\ntemperature range when level broadening is optimized.

    "abstract": "FB15k-237 mitigates the data leakage issue by excluding inverse and symmetric\nrelationship triples, however, this has led to substantial performance\ndegradation and slow improvement progress. Traditional approaches demonstrate\nlimited effectiveness on FB15k-237, primarily because the underlying mechanism\nby which structural features of the dataset influence model performance remains\nunexplored. To bridge this gap, we systematically investigate the impact\nmechanism of dataset structural features on link prediction performance.\nFirstly, we design a structured subgraph sampling strategy that ensures\nconnectivity while constructing subgraphs with distinct structural features.\nThen, through correlation and sensitivity analyses conducted across several\nmainstream models, we observe that the distribution of relationship categories\nwithin subgraphs significantly affects performance, followed by the size of\nstrongly connected components. Further exploration using the LIME model\nclarifies the intrinsic mechanism by which relationship categories influence\nlink prediction performance, revealing that relationship categories primarily\nmodulate the relative importance between entity embeddings and relationship\nembeddings and relationship embeddings, thereby affecting link prediction\noutcomes. These findings provide theoretical insights for addressing\nperformance bottlenecks on FB15k-237, while the proposed analytical framework\nalso offers methodological guidance for future studies dealing with\nstructurally constrained datasets.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we first focus on the mathematical structure of the\nthree-dimensional (3D) Ising model. In the Clifford algebraic representation,\nmany internal factors exist in the transfer matrices of the 3D Ising model,\nwhich are ascribed to the topology of the 3D space and the many-body\ninteractions of spins. They result in the nonlocality, the nontrivial\ntopological structure, as well as the long-range entanglement between spins in\nthe 3D Ising model. We review briefly the exact solution of the ferromagnetic\n3D Ising model at the zero magnetic field, which was derived in our previous\nwork. Then, the framework of topological quantum statistical mechanics is\nestablished, with respect to the mathematical aspects (topology, algebra, and\ngeometry) and physical features (the contribution of topology to physics,\nJordan-von Neumann-Wigner framework, time average, ensemble average, and\nquantum mechanical average). This is accomplished by generalizations of our\nfindings and observations in the 3D Ising models. Finally, the results are\ngeneralized to topological quantum field theories, in consideration of\nrelationships between quantum statistical mechanics and quantum field theories.\nIt is found that these theories must be set up within the Jordan-von\nNeumann-Wigner framework, and the ergodic hypothesis is violated at the finite\ntemperature. It is necessary to account the time average of the ensemble\naverage and the quantum mechanical average in the topological quantum\nstatistical mechanics and to introduce the parameter space of complex time (and\ncomplex temperature) in the topological quantum field theories. We find that a\ntopological phase transition occurs near the infinite temperature (or the zero\ntemperature) in models in the topological quantum statistical mechanics and the\ntopological quantum field theories, which visualizes a symmetrical breaking of\ntime inverse symmetry.",

Current categorical frameworks (e.g.,\n\"human-in-the-loop\" models) inadequately capture how AI systems evolve from\ntools to partners, particularly as foundation models demonstrate emergent\ncapabilities and multi-agent systems exhibit autonomous goal-setting\nbehaviours. As systems advance, agency redistributes in complex patterns that\nare better represented as positions along continua rather than discrete\ncategories, though progression may include both gradual shifts and significant\nstep changes. The HAIG framework operates across three levels: dimensions\n(Decision Authority Distribution, Process Autonomy, and Accountability\nConfiguration), continua (gradual shifts along each dimension), and thresholds\n(critical points requiring governance adaptation). Unlike risk-based or\nprinciple-based approaches, HAIG adopts a trust-utility orientation, focusing\non maintaining appropriate trust relationships that maximise utility while\nensuring sufficient safeguards. Our analysis reveals how technical advances in\nself-supervision, reasoning authority, and distributed decision-making drive\nnon-uniform trust evolution across both contextual variation and technological\nadvancement.

The generalizability of extant methods is frequently\ncompromised due to the pronounced variability in imaging and the heterogeneous\ncharacteristics of pancreatic lesions, which may mimic normal tissues and\nexhibit significant inter-patient variability. Thus, we propose a\ngeneralization framework that synergizes pixel-level classification and\nregression tasks, to accurately delineate lesions and improve model stability.\nThis framework not only seeks to align segmentation contours with actual\nlesions but also uses regression to elucidate spatial relationships between\ndiseased and normal tissues, thereby improving tumor localization and\nmorphological characterization. Enhanced by the reciprocal transformation of\ntask outputs, our approach integrates additional regression supervision within\nthe segmentation context, bolstering the model's generalization ability from a\ndual-task perspective. Besides, dual self-supervised learning in feature spaces\nand output spaces augments the model's representational capability and\nstability across different imaging views. Experiments on 594 samples composed\nof three datasets with significant imaging differences demonstrate that our\ngeneralized pancreas segmentation results comparable to mainstream in-domain\nvalidation performance (Dice: 84.07%).

Our proposed framework encompasses and\nextends existing analyses that consider exogenous disturbances and measurement\nnoise, while also relaxing several restrictive assumptions commonly made in\nprior work. A central challenge in the data perturbation setting arises from\nthe non-convexity of the set of systems consistent with the data, which renders\nstandard matrix S-procedure techniques inapplicable. To resolve this issue, we\ndevelop a novel matrix S-procedure that does not rely on convexity of the\nsystem set by exploiting geometric properties of QMI solution sets.\nFurthermore, we derive sufficient conditions for data informativity in the\npresence of multiple noise sources by approximating the combined noise effect\nthrough the QMI framework. The proposed results are broadly applicable to a\nwide class of noise models and subsume several existing methodologies as\nspecial cases.",

    "abstract": "Sample size calculations can be challenging with skewed continuous outcomes\nin randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Standard t-test-based calculations may\nrequire data transformation, which may be difficult before data collection.\nCalculations based on individual and clustered Wilcoxon rank-sum tests have\nbeen proposed as alternatives, but these calculations assume no ties in\ncontinuous outcomes, and clustered Wilcoxon rank-sum tests perform poorly with\nheterogeneous cluster sizes. Recent work has shown that continuous outcomes can\nbe analyzed in a robust manner using ordinal cumulative probability models.\nAnalogously, sample size calculations for ordinal outcomes can be applied as a\nrobust design strategy for continuous outcomes. We show that Whitehead's sample\nsize calculations for independent ordinal outcomes can be easily extended to\ncontinuous outcomes. We extend these calculations to cluster RCTs using a\ndesign effect incorporating the rank intraclass correlation coefficient.\nTherefore, we provide a unifying and simple approach for designing individual\nand cluster RCTs that makes minimal assumptions on the distribution of the\nstill-to-be-collected outcome. We conduct simulations to evaluate our\napproach's performance and illustrate its application in multiple RCTs: an\nindividual RCT with skewed continuous outcomes, a cluster RCT with skewed\ncontinuous outcomes, and a non-inferiority cluster RCT with an irregularly\ndistributed count outcome.",

    "abstract": "L\\'evy processes are widely used in financial modeling due to their ability\nto capture discontinuities and heavy tails, which are common in high-frequency\nasset return data. However, parameter estimation remains a challenge when\nassociated likelihoods are unavailable or costly to compute. We propose a fast\nand accurate method for L\\'evy parameter estimation using the neural Bayes\nestimation (NBE) framework -- a simulation-based, likelihood-free approach that\nleverages permutation-invariant neural networks to approximate Bayes\nestimators. Through extensive simulations across several L\\'evy models, we show\nthat NBE outperforms traditional methods in both accuracy and runtime, while\nalso enabling rapid bootstrap-based uncertainty quantification. We illustrate\nour approach on a challenging high-frequency cryptocurrency return dataset,\nwhere the method captures evolving parameter dynamics and delivers reliable and\ninterpretable inference at a fraction of the computational cost of traditional\nmethods. NBE provides a scalable and practical solution for inference in\ncomplex financial models, enabling parameter estimation and uncertainty\nquantification over an entire year of data in just seconds.

A\nmultimodal teacher network trained on paired RGB-Thermal imagery and\nradiometric TIFF ground truth distills knowledge to a unimodal RGB student\nnetwork, enabling thermal-sensor-free inference.

    "abstract": "High-throughput neural network inference requires coordinating many\noptimization decisions, including parallel tiling, microkernel selection, and\ndata layout. The product of these decisions forms a search space of programs\nwhich is typically intractably large. Existing approaches (e.g.,\nauto-schedulers) often address this problem by sampling this space\nheuristically. In contrast, we introduce a dynamic-programming-based approach\nto explore more of the search space by iteratively decomposing large program\nspecifications into smaller specifications reachable from a set of rewrites,\nthen composing a final program from each rewrite that minimizes an affine cost\nmodel. To reduce memory requirements, we employ a novel memoization table\nrepresentation, which indexes specifications by coordinates in $Z_{\\geq 0}$ and\ncompresses identical, adjacent solutions. This approach can visit a much larger\nset of programs than prior work. To evaluate the approach, we developed\nMorello, a compiler which lowers specifications roughly equivalent to a\nfew-node XLA computation graph to x86. Notably, we found that an affine cost\nmodel is sufficient to surface high-throughput programs. For example, Morello\nsynthesized a collection of matrix multiplication benchmarks targeting a Zen 1\nCPU, including a 1x2048x16384, bfloat16-to-float32 vector-matrix multiply,\nwhich was integrated into Google's gemma.cpp.",

By systematically\nvarying spatial configurations - such as object position relative to the\nhumanoid minifigure and the humanoid minifigure's orientation - and using both\nbird's-eye and surface-level views, we created 144 unique visual tasks. Each\nvisual task is paired with a series of 7 diagnostic questions designed to\nassess three levels of visual cognition: scene understanding, spatial\nreasoning, and visual perspective taking. Our evaluation of several\nstate-of-the-art models, including GPT-4-Turbo, GPT-4o,\nLlama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct, and variants of Claude Sonnet, reveals that\nwhile they excel in scene understanding, the performance declines significantly\non spatial reasoning and further deteriorates on perspective-taking.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in\nnatural language understanding and task generalization. However, their\napplication to structured data analysis remains fragile due to inconsistencies\nin schema interpretation, misalignment between user intent and model output,\nand limited mechanisms for self-correction when failures occur. This paper\nintroduces the STROT Framework (Structured Task Reasoning and Output\nTransformation), a method for structured prompting and feedback-driven\ntransformation logic generation aimed at improving the reliability and semantic\nalignment of LLM-based analytical workflows. STROT begins with lightweight\nschema introspection and sample-based field classification, enabling dynamic\ncontext construction that captures both the structure and statistical profile\nof the input data. This contextual information is embedded in structured\nprompts that guide the model toward generating task-specific, interpretable\noutputs. To address common failure modes in complex queries, STROT incorporates\na refinement mechanism in which the model iteratively revises its outputs based\non execution feedback and validation signals. Unlike conventional approaches\nthat rely on static prompts or single-shot inference, STROT treats the LLM as a\nreasoning agent embedded within a controlled analysis loop -- capable of\nadjusting its output trajectory through planning and correction. The result is\na robust and reproducible framework for reasoning over structured data with\nLLMs, applicable to diverse data exploration and analysis tasks where\ninterpretability, stability, and correctness are essential.",
