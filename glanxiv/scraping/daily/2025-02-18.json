    "abstract": "Latent diffusion models have exhibited considerable potential in generative\ntasks. Watermarking is considered to be an alternative to safeguard the\ncopyright of generative models and prevent their misuse. However, in the\ncontext of model distribution scenarios, the accessibility of models to large\nscale of model users brings new challenges to the security, efficiency and\nrobustness of existing watermark solutions. To address these issues, we propose\na secure and efficient watermarking solution. A new security mechanism is\ndesigned to prevent watermark leakage and watermark escape, which considers\nwatermark randomness and watermark-model association as two constraints for\nmandatory watermark injection. To reduce the time cost of training the security\nmodule, watermark injection and the security mechanism are decoupled, ensuring\nthat fine-tuning VAE only accomplishes the security mechanism without the\nburden of learning watermark patterns. A watermark distribution-based\nverification strategy is proposed to enhance the robustness against diverse\nattacks in the model distribution scenarios. Experimental results prove that\nour watermarking consistently outperforms existing six baselines on\neffectiveness and robustness against ten image processing attacks and\nadversarial attacks, while enhancing security in the distribution scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Biomedical knowledge graphs (KGs) encode rich, structured information\ncritical for drug discovery tasks, but extracting meaningful insights from\nlarge-scale KGs remains challenging due to their complex structure. Existing\nbiomedical subgraph retrieval methods are tailored for graph neural networks\n(GNNs), limiting compatibility with other paradigms, including large language\nmodels (LLMs). We introduce K-Paths, a model-agnostic retrieval framework that\nextracts structured, diverse, and biologically meaningful multi-hop paths from\ndense biomedical KGs. These paths enable the prediction of unobserved drug-drug\nand drug-disease interactions, including those involving entities not seen\nduring training, thus supporting inductive reasoning. K-Paths is training-free\nand employs a diversity-aware adaptation of Yen's algorithm to extract the K\nshortest loopless paths between entities in a query, prioritizing biologically\nrelevant and relationally diverse connections. These paths serve as concise,\ninterpretable reasoning chains that can be directly integrated with LLMs or\nGNNs to improve generalization, accuracy, and enable explainable inference.\nExperiments on benchmark datasets show that K-Paths improves zero-shot\nreasoning across state-of-the-art LLMs. For instance, Tx-Gemma 27B improves by\n19.8 and 4.0 F1 points on interaction severity prediction and drug repurposing\ntasks, respectively. Llama 70B achieves gains of 8.5 and 6.2 points on the same\ntasks. K-Paths also boosts the training efficiency of EmerGNN, a\nstate-of-the-art GNN, by reducing the KG size by 90% while maintaining\npredictive performance. Beyond efficiency, K-Paths bridges the gap between KGs\nand LLMs, enabling scalable and explainable LLM-augmented scientific discovery.\nWe release our code and the retrieved paths as a benchmark for inductive\nreasoning.",

Without commenting on the validity of the\nfluid instability driven \\textit{mechanism} of balling in AM, this work intends\nto present the most realistic analytical discussion of the balling defect\ndriven purely by fluid instabilities. Synchrotron-based X-ray radiography of\nthin samples indicate that fluid instability growth rates and solidification\ncan be comparable in magnitude and thus compete. Neglecting the action of fluid\nflows and heat transport, this work presents an analytical formalism which\naccounts for fluid instabilities and solidification competition, giving a\ncontinuous transition from balling to non-balling which is lacking in current\nliterature. We adapt a Rivulet instability model from the fluid physics\ncommunity to account for the stabilizing effects of the substrate which the\nPlateau-Rayleigh instability model does not account for, and estimate the\ninstability growth rate. Our model predicts instability growth at higher\nwavelengths and shallower melt pool depths relative to width, as well as strong\nsensitivity to the solidification front curvature. Deviations between model\npredictions and our experimental results demonstrate the importance of fluid\nflows and heat transport in the balling process.

We then observe\nthat the most typical motifs used in the existing literature are binary, as the\nrepresentations are learned based on how pairs of relations interact, which\nlimits the model's expressiveness.

Although the main objective of the data structure is to quickly\nreport data points that are closest to a given query, it has long been noted\n(Carbonell and Goldstein, 1998) that without additional constraints the\nreported answers can be redundant and/or duplicative. This issue is typically\naddressed in two stages: in the first stage, the algorithm retrieves a (large)\nnumber $r$ of points closest to the query, while in the second stage, the $r$\npoints are post-processed and a small subset is selected to maximize the\ndesired diversity objective. Although popular, this method suffers from a\nfundamental efficiency bottleneck, as the set of points retrieved in the first\nstage often needs to be much larger than the final output.\n  In this paper we present provably efficient algorithms for approximate\nnearest neighbor search with diversity constraints that bypass this two stage\nprocess. Our algorithms are based on popular graph-based methods, which allows\nus to \"piggy-back\" on the existing efficient implementations. These are the\nfirst graph-based algorithms for nearest neighbor search with diversity\nconstraints. For data sets with low intrinsic dimension, our data structures\nreport a diverse set of $k$ points approximately closest to the query, in time\nthat only depends on $k$ and $\\log \\Delta$, where $\\Delta$ is the ratio of the\ndiameter to the closest pair distance in the data set.

The main challenge\nlies in generating plausible image completions that are geometrically\nconsistent across views. Most recent work addresses this challenge by combining\ngenerative models with a 3D radiance field to fuse information across a\nrelatively dense set of viewpoints. However, a major drawback of these methods\nis that they often produce blurry images due to the fusion of inconsistent\ncross-view images. To avoid blurry inpaintings, we eschew the use of an\nexplicit or implicit radiance field altogether and instead fuse cross-view\ninformation in a learned space. In particular, we introduce a geometry-aware\nconditional generative model, capable of multi-view consistent inpainting using\nreference-based geometric and appearance cues. A key advantage of our approach\nover existing methods is its unique ability to inpaint masked scenes with a\nlimited number of views (i.e., few-view inpainting), whereas previous methods\nrequire relatively large image sets for their 3D model fitting step.\nEmpirically, we evaluate and compare our scene-centric inpainting method on two\ndatasets, SPIn-NeRF and NeRFiller, which contain images captured at narrow and\nwide baselines, respectively, and achieve state-of-the-art 3D inpainting\nperformance on both.

    "abstract": "Autoregressive Language Models output text by sequentially predicting the\nnext token to generate, with modern methods like Chain-of-Thought (CoT)\nprompting achieving state-of-the-art reasoning capabilities by scaling the\nnumber of generated tokens. However, are there times when we can infer how the\nmodel will behave (e.g. abstain from answering a question) early in the\ncomputation, making generation unnecessary? We show that internal\nrepresentation of input tokens alone can often precisely predict, not just the\nnext token, but eventual behavior over the entire output sequence. We leverage\nthis capacity and learn probes on internal states to create early warning (and\nexit) systems. Specifically, if the probes can confidently estimate the way the\nLM is going to behave, then the system will avoid generating tokens altogether\nand return the estimated behavior instead. On 27 text classification datasets\nspanning five different tasks, we apply this method to estimate the eventual\nanswer of an LM under CoT prompting, reducing inference costs by 65% (average)\nwhile suffering an accuracy loss of no more than 1.4% (worst case). We\ndemonstrate the potential of this method to pre-emptively identify when a model\nwill abstain from answering a question, fail to follow output format\nspecifications, or give a low-confidence response. We explore the limits of\nthis capability, showing that probes generalize to unseen datasets, but perform\nworse when LM outputs are longer and struggle to predict properties that\nrequire access to knowledge that the models themselves lack.

We find that gender information is highly localized in middle MLP layers\nand can be reliably manipulated at inference time via patching. Such\ninterventions can surgically alter generated clinical vignettes for specific\nconditions, and also influence downstream clinical predictions which correlate\nwith gender, e.g., patient risk of depression.

    "abstract": "Anomaly detection (AD) is a fundamental task for time-series analytics with\nimportant implications for the downstream performance of many applications. In\ncontrast to other domains where AD mainly focuses on point-based anomalies\n(i.e., outliers in standalone observations), AD for time series is also\nconcerned with range-based anomalies (i.e., outliers spanning multiple\nobservations). Nevertheless, it is common to use traditional point-based\ninformation retrieval measures, such as Precision, Recall, and F-score, to\nassess the quality of methods by thresholding the anomaly score to mark each\npoint as an anomaly or not. However, mapping discrete labels into continuous\ndata introduces unavoidable shortcomings, complicating the evaluation of\nrange-based anomalies. Notably, the choice of evaluation measure may\nsignificantly bias the experimental outcome. Despite over six decades of\nattention, there has never been a large-scale systematic quantitative and\nqualitative analysis of time-series AD evaluation measures. This paper\nextensively evaluates quality measures for time-series AD to assess their\nrobustness under noise, misalignments, and different anomaly cardinality\nratios. Our results indicate that measures producing quality values\nindependently of a threshold (i.e., AUC-ROC and AUC-PR) are more suitable for\ntime-series AD. Motivated by this observation, we first extend the AUC-based\nmeasures to account for range-based anomalies. Then, we introduce a new family\nof parameter-free and threshold-independent measures, Volume Under the Surface\n(VUS), to evaluate methods while varying parameters. We also introduce two\noptimized implementations for VUS that reduce significantly the execution time\nof the initial implementation. Our findings demonstrate that our four measures\nare significantly more robust in assessing the quality of time-series AD\nmethods.",

    "abstract": "Experiments have shown that the charge-changing weak interaction is purely\nleft-handed, which is taken into account in the Standard Model by the inclusion\nof a left-handed projection operator in the Lagrangian. Nevertheless, it will\nbe shown here that the Standard Model predicts charge-changing weak\ninteractions for right-handed fermions that can be larger than those for\nleft-handed fermions if the mass is sufficiently large, as is the case for the\ntop quark. Here we are using the conventional terminology in which a massive\nfermion with its spin parallel to its momentum is referred to as being\nright-handed in the relativistic limit, where it is in an approximate\neigenstate of the chirality operator. These effects are due to the way in which\nthe field of the W boson is quantized, which gives a divergent tensor product\nin the Feynman propagator in the unitary gauge. It will be shown that the\noff-diagonal terms in the propagator can convert a left-handed projection\noperator into a right-handed projection operator, which allows an interaction\nwith right-handed fermions even though the Lagrangian is left-handed.\nExperiments to date have only demonstrated charge-changing weak interactions\nfor left-handed particles, and an alternative quantization approach that\neliminates the divergent off-diagonal terms in the W boson propagator and\navoids these difficulties will be considered. The alternative approach appears\nto be in agreement with existing experiments, but additional high-energy\nexperiments may be required in order to distinguish its predictions from those\nof the Standard Model.",

To this end, we adapt the\ndeconvolution method used for unbiased estimation in the statistical\nliterature, deriving unbiased estimators for a broad family of\ntwice-differentiable functions when the privacy-preserving noise $\\nu$ is drawn\nfrom the Laplace distribution (Dwork et al., 2006). We further extend this\ntechnique to a more general class of functions, deriving approximately optimal\nestimators that are unbiased for values in a user-specified interval (possibly\nextending to $\\pm \\infty$). We use these results to derive an unbiased\nestimator for private means when the size $n$ of the dataset is not publicly\nknown. In a numerical application, we find that a mechanism that uses our\nestimator to return an unbiased sample size and mean outperforms a mechanism\nthat instead uses the previously known unbiased privacy mechanism for such\nmeans (Kamath et al., 2023). We also apply our estimators to develop unbiased\ntransformation mechanisms for per-record differential privacy, a privacy\nconcept in which the privacy guarantee is a public function of a record's value\n(Seeman et al., 2024). Our mechanisms provide stronger privacy guarantees than\nthose in prior work (Finley et al., 2024) by using Laplace, rather than\nGaussian, noise.

We show that\nthe angular statistics closely resemble a Voigt profile, the convolution of a\nGaussian (L\\'{e}vy index $\\alpha=2$) and Lorentzian (L\\'{e}vy index $\\alpha=1$)\ndistribution. This distribution is ubiquitous for all four microbes. Rather\nthan modeling tumbling as a discrete process, we model tumbling dynamics as a\ncontinuous process: L\\'{e}vy flights in the orientational dynamics using a\nLorentzian noise model. This model is analytically solvable. Each individual\nmicrobe trajectory has both stochastic behavior (noise) and varying\ndeterministic behavior, such as helices of different sizes and frequencies and\ncircular arcs with different radii. We model the distribution of different\ndeterministic behavior via an ensemble theory. The deterministic behavior\n(e.g., circular arcs) comes from physical observations of the swimming behavior\nand explains many of the qualitative features in the data that cannot be\nexplained by a pure noise model. From this theory, we estimate the strength of\nLorentzian noise, the physical rotational diffusion constant, and some relevant\nparameters relating to the distributions of deterministic behavior. This\nanalysis shows that in some cases Gaussian noise is not the dominant process\nresponsible for the angular statistics following a Voigt profile.",

    "abstract": "Low-power and low-cost wireless sensor networks enable scalable and\naffordable sensing and can be deployed in different environments to monitor\nvarious physical parameters. In some environments, these networks may have to\ncoexist and interact with other systems which use the same frequency spectrum\nfor communication. This potentially results in cross-technology interference\n(CTI). Dynamic channel hopping is one of the mechanisms that is currently\nemployed to deal with CTI, but its usefulness depends on the channel selection\nand occupation timing. In this paper, we experimentally study the impact of CTI\n(caused by IEEE 802.11 networks) on time synchronization and network join time.\nExperiment results show that CTI can increase time drift between a child and a\nparent node by up to $\\pm 3$ clock ticks between two synchronization intervals.\nLikewise, CTI affects new nodes from timely joining a network. In a simple\nnetwork which does not involve multi-hop communication, the time it takes for\nnodes to join the network in the absence of CTI is between 40 and 70 ms (83.3\\%\nof the time). In the presence of CTI, 96.82\\% of the time, the join time is\nbetween 100 and 200 ms. In other words, the join time in the presence of CTI is\nabout five times higher. Interestingly, not only the main spectral lobes, but\nalso the spectral sidelobes of interfering networks impact the performance of\nlow-power networks.",

    "abstract": "We study the use of global drives with multiple frequency components to\nimprove the efficiency of trapped ion quantum simulations and computations. We\nshow that such `multi-mode' global drives, when combined with a linear number\nof single-qubit rotations, generate universal Ising-type interactions with\nshorter overall runtimes than corresponding two-qubit gate implementations.\nFurther, we show how this framework may be extended to efficiently generate\n$n-$body interactions between any subset $n$ of the ion qubits. Finally, we\napply these techniques to encode the Quantum Fourier Transform using\nquadratically-fewer entangling operations, with quadratically smaller runtime,\ncompared with traditional approaches.",

    "abstract": "The paper presents an original method for controlling a\nsurface-electromyography-driven (sEMG) prosthesis. A context-dependent\nrecognition system is proposed in which the same class of sEMG signals may have\na different interpretation, depending on the context. This allowed the\nrepertoire of performed movements to be increased. The proposed structure of\nthe context-dependent recognition system includes unambiguously defined\ndecision sequences covering the overall action of the prosthesis, i.e. the\nso-called boxes. Because the boxes are mutually isolated environments, each box\nhas its own interpretation of the recognition result, as well as a separate\nlocal-recognition-task-focused classifier.\n  Due to the freedom to assign contextual meanings to classes of biosignals,\nthe construction procedure of the classifier can be optimised in terms of the\nlocal classification quality in a given box or the classification quality of\nthe entire system. In the paper, two optimisation problems are formulated,\ndiffering in the adopted constraints on optimisation variables, with the\nmethods of solving the problems based on an exhaustive search and an\nevolutionary algorithm, being developed.\n  Experimental studies were conducted using signals from 1 able-bodied person\nwith simulation of amputation and 10 volunteers with transradial amputations.\nThe study compared the classical recognition system and the context-dependent\nsystem for various classifier models. An unusual testing strategy was adopted\nin the research, taking into account the specificity of the considered\nrecognition task, with two original quality measures resulting from this scheme\nthen being applied. The results obtained confirm the hypothesis that the\napplication of the context-dependent classifier led to an improvement in\nclassification quality.",

    "abstract": "Task-oriented dialog (TOD) systems facilitate users in accomplishing complex,\nmulti-turn tasks through natural language. While traditional approaches rely on\nextensive fine-tuning and annotated data for each domain, instruction-tuned\nlarge language models (LLMs) offer a more flexible alternative. However, LLMs\nstruggle to reliably handle multi-turn task completion, particularly with\naccurately generating API calls and adapting to new domains without explicit\ndemonstrations. To address these challenges, we propose RealTOD, a novel\nframework that enhances TOD systems through prompt chaining and fine-grained\nfeedback mechanisms. Prompt chaining enables zero-shot domain adaptation via a\ntwo-stage prompting strategy, eliminating the need for human-curated\ndemonstrations. Meanwhile, the fine-grained feedback mechanism improves task\ncompletion by verifying API calls against domain schemas and providing precise\ncorrective feedback when errors are detected. We conduct extensive experiments\non the SGD and BiTOD benchmarks using four LLMs. RealTOD improves API accuracy,\nsurpassing AutoTOD by 37.74% on SGD and SimpleTOD by 11.26% on BiTOD. Human\nevaluations further confirm that LLMs integrated with RealTOD achieve superior\ntask completion, fluency, and informativeness compared to existing methods.",

VGS\ngenerates samples from a given unnormalized density (i.e., energy) by drifting\nand diffusing randomly initialized particles. In VGS, finding the optimal drift\nis equivalent to solving an optimal control problem where the cost is the upper\nbound of the KL divergence between the target density and the samples. We\nemploy value-based dynamic programming to solve this optimal control problem,\nwhich gives the gradient of the value function as the optimal drift vector. The\nconnection to sequential decision making allows VGS to leverage extensively\nstudied techniques in reinforcement learning, making VGS a fast, adaptive, and\naccurate sampler that achieves competitive results in various sampling\nbenchmarks. Furthermore, VGS can replace MCMC in contrastive divergence\ntraining of energy-based models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of VGS in\ntraining accurate energy-based models in industrial anomaly detection\napplications.",

    "abstract": "We examine the decay of perturbations in an infinite homogeneous\nself-gravitating model with a Maxwellian distribution function (DF) when weak\ncollisions are present. In collisionless systems within the stable parameter\nrange, the eigenvalue spectrum consists of a continuous set of real frequencies\nassociated with van Kampen modes, which are singular eigenfunctions of the\nstellar DF. An initial perturbation in the stellar density and gravitational\npotential decays exponentially through a superposition of these modes, a\nphenomenon known as Landau damping. However, the perturbation in the stellar DF\ndoes not decay self-similarly; it becomes increasingly oscillatory in velocity\nspace over time, indicating the absence of eigenfunctions corresponding to the\nLandau damping eigenfrequencies. Consequently, we refer to perturbations\nundergoing Landau damping as quasi-modes rather than true eigenmodes. Even rare\ncollisions suppress the formation of steep DF gradients in velocity space. C.\nS. Ng & A. Bhattacharjee demonstrated that introducing collisions eliminates\nvan Kampen modes and transforms Landau quasi-modes into true eigenmodes forming\na complete set. As the collision frequency approaches zero, their\neigenfrequencies converge to those of the collisionless Landau quasi-modes. In\nthis study, we investigate the behavior of the eigenfunction of the\nleast-damped aperiodic mode as the collision frequency approaches zero. We\nderive analytic expressions for the eigenfunction in the resonance region and\nfor the damping rate as a function of collision frequency. Additionally, we\nemploy the standard matrix eigenvalue problem approach to numerically verify\nour analytical results.",

Furthermore, the selection of negative\nsamples remains rarely explored. In this paper, we introduce HyperGCL, a novel\nmultimodal GCL framework from a hypergraph perspective. HyperGCL constructs\nthree distinct hypergraph views by jointly utilizing the input graph's\nstructure and attributes, enabling a comprehensive integration of multiple\nmodalities in contrastive learning. A learnable adaptive topology augmentation\ntechnique enhances these views by preserving important relations and filtering\nout noise.

The condensation energy of\nsuch a state decreases with $q$ and vanishes at a critical $q_c$. We analyze\nhow superconducting order evolves at $ q \\approx q_c$. In 3D, the result is\nwell-known: the pairing susceptibility diverges at $q = q_c +0$, and the gap\namplitude $\\Delta (q)$ gradually increases as $q$ decreases below $q_c$ and\nreaches its largest value $\\Delta_0$ at $q=0$. In 2D, we find different\nbehavior. Namely, for a parabolic dispersion, the pairing susceptibility also\ndiverges at $q = q_c +0$, but at $q = q_c -0$, the gap amplitude jumps to the\nmaximal $\\Delta_0$ and remains equal to it for all $q <q_c$. For a\nnon-parabolic dispersion $\\varepsilon_{k}= c k^{2\\alpha}$, we find that for\n$\\alpha>1$ the transition becomes second-order, but the gap evolution is rather\nsharp, whereas for $\\alpha<1$ it becomes first-order, but $\\Delta (q)$ is\nnon-monotonic.

    "abstract": "The interaction between planets and their host stars is governed by the\nforces of gravity, radiation, and magnetic fields. For planets orbiting their\nstars at distances of approximately 10 stellar radii or less, these effects are\nsignificantly intensified. Such interactions can be investigated through a\ncombination of photometric, spectroscopic, and spectropolarimetric studies\nspanning wavelengths from X-rays to radio frequencies. When a hot planet\nresides within the star's sub-Alfv\\'enic radius, magnetic star-planet\ninteractions (SPI) become possible, often observable as stellar activity\nenhancements influenced by the planet's orbital motion rather than stellar\nrotation alone. Such interactions offer a unique perspective on the atmospheric\nerosion and magnetospheric characteristics of close-in exoplanets.The behavior\nand impacts of these magnetic interactions are highly sensitive to the magnetic\nfields of both the planet and its host star. This interplay can influence the\nmagnetic activity of both bodies and has implications for the planet's\nirradiation levels, orbital migration, and the star's rotational dynamics. By\nemploying phase-resolved observational methods on an expanding sample of hot\nJupiter (HJ) systems, researchers can now extend these studies to other compact\nstar-planet systems, including smaller planets in the habitable zones of M\ndwarfs. Efforts to comprehend magnetic SPI have led to extensive advancements\nin theoretical research and computational modeling. These efforts include\ninvestigations into the space weather environments of close-in giant\nexoplanets. Utilizing hydrodynamical (HD) and magnetohydrodynamical (MHD)\nsimulations, researchers aim to provide both qualitative and quantitative\ndescriptions of SPI. In this chapter, we first review notable SPI detections\nbefore summarizing the current understanding of the underlying physical\nmechanisms driving SPI.",

    "abstract": "Label Smoothing (LS) is widely adopted to reduce overconfidence in neural\nnetwork predictions and improve generalization. Despite these benefits, recent\nstudies reveal two critical issues with LS. First, LS induces overconfidence in\nmisclassified samples. Second, it compacts feature representations into overly\ntight clusters, diluting intra-class diversity, although the precise cause of\nthis phenomenon remained elusive. In this paper, we analytically decompose the\nLS-induced loss, exposing two key terms: (i) a regularization term that dampens\noverconfidence only when the prediction is correct, and (ii) an\nerror-amplification term that arises under misclassifications. This latter term\ncompels the network to reinforce incorrect predictions with undue certainty,\nexacerbating representation collapse. To address these shortcomings, we propose\nMax Suppression (MaxSup), which applies uniform regularization to both correct\nand incorrect predictions by penalizing the top-1 logit rather than the\nground-truth logit. Through extensive feature-space analyses, we show that\nMaxSup restores intra-class variation and sharpens inter-class boundaries.\nExperiments on large-scale image classification and multiple downstream tasks\nconfirm that MaxSup is a more robust alternative to LS, consistently reducing\noverconfidence while preserving richer feature representations.

Our method enables models\nto focus solely on generating these critical steps.

These systems, however,\nface many challenges, especially regarding security and system faults.\nAnomalies in CPS may indicate unexpected problems, from sensor malfunctions to\ncyber-attacks, and must be detected to prevent failures that can cause harm or\ndisrupt services. This paper provides an overview of the different ways\nresearchers have approached anomaly detection in CPS. We categorize and compare\nmethods like machine learning, deep learning, mathematical models, invariant,\nand hybrid techniques. Our goal is to help readers understand the strengths and\nweaknesses of these methods and how they can be used to create safer, more\nreliable CPS.

Transition wavelength\ncalculations exhibit exceptional agreement with experimental data, with about\n90\\% of the calculated values falling within 10\\% of measurements for Pr and Er\nions. While improvements in transition probability calculations are observed,\nthe calculated transition probabilities (log($gf$) values) still show\nsignificant discrepancies compared to the experimental data, with root mean\nsquare deviations of approximately 1.1-1.4 dex for Pr and Er ions.

When it happens, several mean-field methods and virtually every\nMonte Carlo scheme can not provide a reasonable approximation to the posterior\nand its marginals. Replica symmetry is believed to be guaranteed whenever the\ndata is generated with known prior and likelihood distributions, namely under\nthe so-called Nishimori conditions. In this paper, we break this belief, by\nproviding a counter-example showing that, under the Nishimori conditions,\nreplica symmetry breaking arises. Introducing a simple, geometrical model that\ncan be thought of as a patient zero retrieval problem in a highly infectious\nregime of the epidemic Susceptible-Infectious model, we show that under the\nNishimori conditions, there is evidence of replica symmetry breaking. We\nachieve this result by computing the instability of the replica symmetric\ncavity method toward the one step replica symmetry broken phase.

Regional Traffic Signal Control (RTSC)\nusing the Multi-agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL) technique has become\na promising approach for ATSC due to its ability to achieve the optimum\ntrade-off between scalability and optimality. Most existing RTSC approaches\npartition a traffic network into several disjoint regions, followed by applying\ncentralized reinforcement learning techniques to each region. However, the\npursuit of cooperation among RTSC agents still remains an open issue and no\ncommunication strategy for RTSC agents has been investigated. In this paper, we\npropose communication strategies to capture the correlation of micro-traffic\nstates among lanes and the correlation of macro-traffic states among\nintersections. We first justify the evolution equation of the RTSC process is\nMarkovian via a system of store-and-forward queues. Next, based on the\nevolution equation, we propose two GAT-Aggregated (GA2) communication\nmodules--GA2-Naive and GA2-Aug to extract both intra-region and inter-region\ncorrelations between macro and micro traffic states. While GA2-Naive only\nconsiders the movements at each intersection, GA2-Aug also considers the\nlane-changing behavior of vehicles. Two proposed communication modules are then\naggregated into two existing novel RTSC frameworks--RegionLight and\nRegional-DRL. Experimental results demonstrate that both GA2-Naive and GA2-Aug\neffectively improve the performance of existing RTSC frameworks under both real\nand synthetic scenarios. Hyperparameter testing also reveals the robustness and\npotential of our communication modules in large-scale traffic networks.",

Cosmological simulations of galaxy formation, such\nas IllustrisTNG or ASTRID, are however not able to resolve this physics in\ndetail and therefore need to rely on approximate treatments. These have often\ntaken the form of empirical subgrid models of the ISM expressed in terms of an\neffective equation of state (EOS) that relates the mean ISM pressure to the\nmean gas density. Here we seek to improve these heuristic models by directly\nfitting their key ingredients to results of the high-resolution TIGRESS\nsimulations, which have shown that the dynamical equilibrium of the ISM can be\nunderstood in terms of a pressure-regulated, feedback modulated (PRFM) model\nfor star formation. Here we explore a simple subgrid model that draws on the\nPRFM concept but uses only local quantities. It accurately reproduces PRFM for\npure gas disks, while it predicts slightly less star formation than PRFM in the\npresence of an additional thin stellar disk. We compare the properties of this\nmodel with the older Springel and Hernquist and TNG prescriptions, and apply\nall three to isolated simulations of disk galaxies as well as to a set of\nhigh-resolution zoom-in simulations carried out with a novel 'multi-zoom'\ntechnique that we introduce in this study. The softer EOS implied by TIGRESS\nproduces substantially thinner disk galaxies, which has important ramifications\nfor disk stability and galaxy morphology. The total stellar mass of galaxies is\nhowever hardly modified at low redshift, reflecting the dominating influence of\nlarge-scale gaseous inflows and outflows to galaxies, which are not sensitive\nto the EOS itself",

Previous work has focused on building accelerated\nforward models that efficiently mimic these simulations. One of these\naccelerated forward models uses machine learning to apply a non-linear\ncorrection to the linear $z=0$ Zeldovich approximation (ZA) fields, closely\nmatching the cosmological statistics in the $N$-body simulation. This emulator\nwas trained and tested at $(h^{-1}{\\rm Gpc})^3$ volumes, although cosmological\ninference requires significantly larger volumes. We test this emulator at $(3\\\nh^{-1}{\\rm Gpc})^3$ by comparing emulator outputs to $N$-body simulations for\neight unique cosmologies. We consider several summary statistics, applied to\nboth the raw particle fields and the dark matter (DM) haloes. We find that the\npower spectrum, bispectrum and wavelet statistics of the raw particle fields\nagree with the $N$-body simulations within ${\\sim} 5 \\%$ at most scales. For\nthe haloes, we find a similar agreement between the emulator and the $N$-body\nfor power spectrum and bispectrum, though a comparison of the stacked profiles\nof haloes shows that the emulator has slight errors in the positions of\nparticles in the highly non-linear interior of the halo. At these large $(3\\\nh^{-1}{\\rm Gpc})^3$ volumes, the emulator can create $z=0$ particle fields in a\nthousandth of the time required for $N$-body simulations and will be a useful\ntool for large-scale cosmological inference.

An estimator is considered robust if\nit possesses a consistent predictive power across all simulations, including\nthose used during the training phase. We train our machine using multiple\nsimulation models and ensure that it only extracts common features between the\nmodels while disregarding the model-specific features. This allows us to\ndevelop a novel model that is capable of accurately estimating parameters\nacross a range of simulation models, without being biased towards any\nparticular model. Upon the investigation of the latent space$-$a set of summary\nstatistics, we find that the implementation of robustness leads to the blending\nof latent variables across different models, demonstrating the removal of\nmodel-specific features. In comparison to a standard machine lacking\nrobustness, the average performance of MIEST on the unseen simulations during\nthe training phase has been improved by $\\sim17$% for $\\Omega_m$ and $\\sim 38$%\nfor $\\sigma_8$.

We present a simple, flexible parametrization for\ngas inflows onto massive black holes in order to manage this uncertainty in\nlarge-volume cosmological simulations. This is done as part of the \"Learning\nthe Universe'' collaboration, which aims to jointly infer the initial\nconditions and physical processes governing the evolution of the Universe using\na Bayesian forward-modelling approach. To allow such a forward-modelling, we\nupdate the prescription for accretion with a two-parameter free-fall based\ninflow estimate that allows for a radius-dependent inflow rate and add a simple\nmodel for unresolved accretion disks. We use uniform resolution cosmological\nhydrodynamical simulations and the IllustrisTNG framework to study the massive\nblack hole population and its dependence on the introduced model parameters.\nOnce the parameters of the accretion formula are chosen to result in a roughly\nsimilar redshift zero black hole mass density, the differences caused by the\ndetails in the accretion formula are moderate in the supermassive black hole\nregime, indicating that it is difficult to distinguish between accretion\nmechanisms based on luminous active galactic nuclei powered by supermassive\nblack holes.

The chemical identities and optoelectronic properties of\n(4,2)- and (6,2)-CcGNRs are comprehensively investigated via a combination of\nIR, Raman, solid-state NMR, UV-vis, and THz spectroscopies as well as\ntheoretical calculations. In line with theoretical expectation, the obtained\n(6,2)-CcGNR possesses a low optical bandgap of 1.37 eV along with charge\ncarrier mobility of 8 cm2/Vs, whereas (4,2)-CcGNR exhibits a narrower bandgap\nof 1.26 eV with increased mobility of 14 cm2/Vs. This work opens up a new\navenue to precisely engineer the bandgap and carrier mobility of GNRs by\nmanipulating their chiral vector.",

In this work, we perform the\nfirst systematic investigation of this blow-up mechanism within general\nrelativity supplemented by quadratic gravity terms, the Goroff-Sagnotti\ncounterterm, the combination of the two, and Einstein-Cubic Gravity. By\nstudying linear perturbations of the Schwarzschild solution close to the\nSchwarzschild radius, we discover the following picture: the higher-derivative\nterms giving rise to extra degrees of freedom play a distinguished role. Once\ncouplings associated with these terms enter the solution in the asymptotically\nflat region, a blow-up mechanism removes the event horizon and one deals with\neither a naked singularity or a wormhole.

    "abstract": "Recently, multilayer graphene systems have attracted significant attention\ndue to the discovery of a variety of intriguing phases, particularly quantum\nanomalous Hall (QAH) states. In rhombohedral pentalayer graphene (RPG), both\nQAH states with Chern number $C = -5$ and $C = -3$ have been observed. While\nthe $C = -5$ QAH state is well understood, the origin of the $C = -3$ QAH state\nremains unclear. In this letter, we propose that the $C = -3$ QAH state, as\nwell as the topological phase transition from $C = -3$ to $C = -5$ state in\nRPG, arises from an asynchronous mass inversion mechanism driven by the\ninterplay between trigonal warping, staggered layer order, and the displacement\nfield: Trigonal warping splits the low-energy bands of RPG into a central\ntouching point and three satellite Dirac cones. Meanwhile, the coexistence of\nthe staggered layer order and displacement field induces a momentum-dependent\neffective mass in the low-energy bands. Consequently, mass inversions at the\ncentral touching point and the satellite Dirac cones, induced by an increasing\ndisplacement field, can occur asynchronously, leading to the formation of the\n$C = -3$ QAH state and the topological phase transition from QAH state with\n$C=-3$ to $C=-5$. Additionally, based on this mechanism, we predict the\npresence of a $C=3$ QAH state in rhombohedral tetralayer graphene (RTG), which\ncan be detected experimentally. Furthermore, this mechanism can also be applied\nto Bernal tetralayer graphene (BTG), explaining the origin of the observed\n$C=6$ QAH state.",

The first goal of this paper is to observe and improve the orbit\ndetermination of (469219) Kamo`oalewa, and better determine the Yarkovsky\neffect acting on it. The second goal is to estimate the thermal inertia of the\nasteroid, taking advantage of an improved Yarkovsky effect determination.\n  Methods. Our observational campaign imaged the asteroid from the Loiano\nAstronomical Station and from the Calar Alto Observatory, in March 2024. We\nalso accurately re-measured a precovery detection from the Sloan Digital Sky\nSurvey from 2004. New astrometry was later used in a 7-dimensional orbit\ndetermination, aimed at estimating both the orbital elements and the Yarkovsky\neffect. Thermal inertia is later studied by using the ASTERIA, a new method\nthat is suitable to estimate thermal inertia of small asteroids.\n  Results. We detected a semi-major axis drift of $(-67.35 \\pm 4.70) \\times\n10^{-4}$ au My$^{-1}$ due to the Yarkovsky effect, with a high signal-to-noise\nratio of 14. The new orbit solution also significantly reduced the position\nuncertainty for the arrival of the Tianwen-2 spacecraft.

    "abstract": "We present the discovery of the variable optical counterpart to PSR\nJ2055+1545, a redback millisecond pulsar, and the first radial velocity curve\nof its companion star. The multi-band optical light curves of this system show\na $0.4$$-$$0.6 \\ \\mathrm{mag}$ amplitude modulation with a single peak per\norbit and variable colours, suggesting that the companion is mildly irradiated\nby the pulsar wind. We find that the flux maximum is asymmetric and occurs at\norbital phase $\\simeq0.4$, anticipating the superior conjunction of the\ncompanion (where the optical emission of irradiated redback companions is\ntypically brightest). We ascribe this asymmetry, well fit with a hot spot in\nour light curve modelling, to irradiation from the intrabinary shock between\npulsar and companion winds. The optical spectra obtained with the \\textit{Gran\nTelescopio Canarias} reveal a G-dwarf companion star with temperatures of $5749\n\\pm 34 \\ \\mathrm{K}$ and $6106 \\pm 35 \\ \\mathrm{K}$ at its inferior and\nsuperior orbital conjunctions, respectively, and a radial velocity\nsemi-amplitude of $385 \\pm 3 \\ \\mathrm{km}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. Our best-fit\nmodel yields a neutron star mass of $1.7^{+0.4}_{-0.1} \\ \\mathrm{M_{sun}}$ and\na companion mass of $0.29^{+0.07}_{-0.01} \\ \\mathrm{M_{sun}}$. Based on the\nclose similarity between the optical light curve of PSR~J2055$+$1545 and those\nobserved from PSR J1023+0038 and PSR J1227-4853 during their rotation-powered\nstates, we suggest this system may develop an accretion disc in the future and\nmanifest as a transitional millisecond pulsar.",

    "abstract": "We use concepts from quantum cryptography to relate the entanglement in\nmany-body mixed states to standard correlation functions. If a system can be\nused as a resource for distilling private keys -- random classical bits that\nare shared by spatially separated observers but hidden from an eavesdropper\nhaving access to the environment -- we can infer that the state of the system\nis entangled. For thermal states, we derive a simple relation between the\ninformation accessible to the eavesdropper and the linear response of the\nsystem. This relation allows us to determine which spatial correlations can be\nused to detect entanglement across wide varieties of physical systems, and\nprovides a new experimental probe of entanglement. We also show that strong\nsymmetries of a density matrix imply the existence of correlations that are\nalways hidden from the environment. This result implies that, although grand\ncanonical ensembles are separable above a finite temperature, canonical\nensembles are generically entangled at all finite temperatures.",

We examine\nhow mass segregation impacts the rates and distributions of such events.\nAssuming a relaxed stellar cluster, composed of stars and stellar-mass BHs, we\nshow that the tidal disruption rate of massive stars ($m\\gtrsim M_\\odot$) is\nenhanced relative to their abundance in the stellar population. For stars up to\n$m\\approx3M_\\odot$, this enhancement is roughly $m/M_\\odot$ and it is driven by\nsegregation within the sphere of influence. Stars with masses\n$m\\gtrsim3M_\\odot$, if relaxed, are predominantly scattered by more massive\nstellar-mass BHs, leading to a constant enhancement factor of $\\approx 9$,\nindependent of mass. This aligns with observational evidence suggesting an\nover-representation of massive stars in tidal disruption events. For\nstellar-mass BHs, we predict an enhancement factor scaling as $m_\\bullet^{1/2}$\nfor plunges and $m_\\bullet^{3/2}$ for extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs). The\npower of one-half in both cases reflects the shorter relaxation times of\nheavier BHs, allowing them to segregate into the sphere of influence from\ngreater distances, thereby increasing their abundance. The additional power in\nthe EMRIs' rate arises from the tendency of heavier BHs to circularize and sink\ninward more efficiently.

    "abstract": "An open issue about multiple stellar populations in globular clusters (GCs)\nis the possible existence of metallicity spreads in first generation (FG)\nstars. Recent estimates based on HST pseudo-colours map (PCM) derived unlikely\nlarge spreads in [Fe/H] from spreads in the colour col=m_{F275W}-m_{F814W}. The\ninferred metallicity spreads for many GCs are comparable or even larger than\nthose observed in dwarf galaxies. This result is clearly unexpected and at odds\nwith the birth time of stars in dwarf galaxies, spanning several billion years,\nas opposed to very short formation times of the stellar component in GCs (a few\nmillion years). The contradiction is corroborated by the comparison of the\nwidths of red giant branches in both classes of objects. Moreover, the so\ncalled spreads in FG stars estimated from the PCMs are always larger than the\nintrinsic metallicity spreads derived from spectroscopy. We used 30 pairs of FG\nstars with similar parameters in 12 GCs to highlight that a constant\ndisplacement in Delta col corresponds to variable differences in [Fe/H] up to\n0.2 dex, depending on the GC. Providing for the first time quantitative\nmeasurements of the extension in Delta col of the sequences of FG and SG stars,\nwe found no relation between metallicity spreads previously derived and\nextension of FG stars. We found that the length of the FG region correlates\nwith the average global metallicity of GCs, and not with the observed\nmetallicity spreads. The extension of FG stars also correlates with the\nextension of SG stars, and the global mass of the GCs. Our findings seriously\nchallenge the scenario claiming more inhomogeneous mixing among FG stars,\ninvalidating previous speculations in the literature.",

Our present study\nof NGC 3259 at D=27 Mpc with the Binospec integral field unit spectrograph\ncomplemented with Keck Echelle Spectrograph and Imager observations\ndemonstrates the need for and the power of the spectroscopic follow-up. NGC\n3259 hosts a black hole with a mass of $M_{BH}=(1.7-4.1)\\times10^5M_{\\odot}$,\ninferred from multi-epoch spectroscopic data, that accretes at 1% of the\nEddington limit as suggested by the analysis of archival XMM-Newton\nobservations. It is the second nearest low-mass AGN after the archetypal galaxy\nNGC 4395. The spectroscopic data reveals a variable broad $H\\alpha$ profile\nthat is likely the result of asymmetrically distributed broad-line region (BLR)\nclouds or BLR outflow events. X-ray observations and the absence of an optical\npower-law continuum suggest partial obscuration of the accretion disk and hot\ncorona by a dust torus. We estimate that the Sloan Digital Sky Survey could\nonly detect similar objects to D=35 Mpc. A detailed photometric analysis of NGC\n3259 using HST images provides a central spheroid stellar mass estimate 25\ntimes lower than expected from the $M_{BH}-M^*_{sph}$ relation, making this\ngalaxy a strong outlier. This discrepancy suggests divergent growth pathways\nfor the central black hole and spheroid, potentially influenced by the presence\nof a bar in the galaxy. Finally, we demonstrate that the DESI and 4MOST surveys\nwill detect low-accretion rate IMBHs and LSMBHs and the sensitivity of future\nX-ray instruments (such as AXIS and Athena) will secure their classification.",

We focus on the impact of the\nrecent major merger at M31 by using three merger models to find the peculiar\nmotion of M31 within the simple two-body and point-mass scenario of TA. We\nfound that the merger correction may affect the TA mass by either plus or minus\n10-15% depending on the M31 tangential motion, which has very large\nuncertainties. If we consider a M31 merger configuration that reduces the TA\nmass by 10-15% to which we add the impact due to the LMC infall into the MW as\nreported in the literature, the TA mass would be found consistent with the LG\nmass from Hubble-Lemaitre flow. Galaxies are expected to experience about 16\nmajor mergers each since z=11.5. Assuming all these mergers have similar impact\non the TA mass as the most recent M31 merger, the ratio of LG mass to TA mass\nwould be $0.85^{+0.65}_{-0.37}$ and such a TA mass is consistent with all the\nLG mass estimates. Our result also agrees with the findings using LG analogues\nin the cosmological simulations. We find that the TA mass estimate is limited\nby the hierarchical scenario, since it not possible to track the progenitors of\nboth MW and M31 through so many mergers.

The\nchemical diffusion coefficient from IGW mixing is described by a constant A\ntimes the squared wave velocity. The value of A, however, remains unconstrained\nby such simulations. This work aims at investigating what values A can take in\norder to reproduce the observed nitrogen surface abundances of the most\nnitrogen-enriched massive stars. Furthermore, we discuss the prevalence of IGW\nmixing compared to rotational mixing. We provide an implementation of these\nmixing profiles predicted from hydrodynamical simulations in the\none-dimensional stellar evolution code MESA. We compute evolution tracks for\nstars between 3 and 30Msun with this new implementation for IGW mixing and\nstudy the evolution for the surface abundances of isotopes involved in the CNO\ncycle, particularly the N14 isotope. We show that this 1D framework predicting\nthe chemical diffusion coefficient from IGW mixing yields consistent\nmorphologies of the mixing profile in comparison with hydrodynamical\nsimulations. We find that the value of A must increase with mass in order to\nreproduce the most nitrogen-enriched stars. Assuming these calibrated values\nfor A, mixing by IGWs is a potential mechanism to reproduce well-mixed stars\nwithout needing rapid rotation. We have provided observational limits on the\nefficiency of IGW mixing for future theoretical studies. Future asteroseismic\nmodelling efforts taking IGW mixing into account will be able to place\nadditional constraints on the convective core mass, as our models predict that\nthe convective core should be significantly more massive if IGW mixing is\nindeed efficient.",

We evaluated challenges\nrelated to the scalability of latent spaces along with obtaining the optimal\nrank of the tensor, which often hinder the extraction of meaningful features\nfrom increasingly large and complex datasets. Additionally, we discuss recent\nadvances in quantum algorithms for tensor decomposition, exploring how quantum\ncomputing can be leveraged to address these challenges. Our study includes a\npreliminary resource estimation analysis for quantum computing platforms and\nexamines the feasibility of implementing quantum-enhanced tensor decomposition\nmethods on near-term quantum devices. Collectively, this review not only\nsynthesizes current applications and challenges of tensor decomposition in\nbiomedical analyses but also outlines promising quantum computing strategies to\nenhance its impact on deriving actionable insights from complex biomedical\ndata.",

Despite\nthese basic abilities, humanoids are still required to quickly understand human\ninstructions and react based on human interaction signals to become valuable\nassistants in human daily life. Unfortunately, most existing works only focus\non multi-stage interactions, treating each task separately, and neglecting\nreal-time feedback. In this work, we aim to empower humanoid robots with\nreal-time reaction abilities to achieve various tasks, allowing human to\ninterrupt robots at any time, and making robots respond to humans immediately.\nTo support such abilities, we propose a general humanoid-human-object\ninteraction framework, named RHINO, i.e., Real-time Humanoid-human Interaction\nand Object manipulation. RHINO provides a unified view of reactive motion,\ninstruction-based manipulation, and safety concerns, over multiple human signal\nmodalities, such as languages, images, and motions. RHINO is a hierarchical\nlearning framework, enabling humanoids to learn reaction skills from\nhuman-human-object demonstrations and teleoperation data. In particular, it\ndecouples the interaction process into two levels: 1) a high-level planner\ninferring human intentions from real-time human behaviors; and 2) a low-level\ncontroller achieving reactive motion behaviors and object manipulation skills\nbased on the predicted intentions. We evaluate the proposed framework on a real\nhumanoid robot and demonstrate its effectiveness, flexibility, and safety in\nvarious scenarios.",

Expert recommendations may contradict data-driven results, and\ntheir reliability can vary significantly depending on the domain or specific\nquery. Existing methods based on soft constraints or inconsistencies in\npredicted causal relationships fail to account for these variations in\nexpertise. To remedy this, we propose L2D-CD, a method for gauging the\ncorrectness of expert recommendations and optimally combining them with\ndata-driven causal discovery results. By adapting learning-to-defer (L2D)\nalgorithms for pairwise causal discovery (CD), we learn a deferral function\nthat selects whether to rely on classical causal discovery methods using\nnumerical data or expert recommendations based on textual meta-data. We\nevaluate L2D-CD on the canonical T\\\"ubingen pairs dataset and demonstrate its\nsuperior performance compared to both the causal discovery method and the\nexpert used in isolation.

In this paper, we introduce\nDecomposed Reward Models (DRMs), a novel approach that extracts diverse human\npreferences from binary comparisons without requiring fine-grained annotations.\nOur key insight is to represent human preferences as vectors and analyze them\nusing Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

    "abstract": "In partially linear additive models the response variable is modelled with a\nlinear component on a subset of covariates and an additive component in which\nthe rest of the covariates enter to the model as a sum of univariate unknown\nfunctions. This structure is more flexible than the usual full linear or full\nnonparametric regression models, avoids the 'curse of dimensionality', is\neasily interpretable and allows the user to include discrete or categorical\nvariables in the linear part. On the other hand, in practice, the user\nincorporates all the available variables in the model no matter how they would\nimpact on the response variable. For this reason, variable selection plays an\nimportant role since including covariates that has a null impact on the\nresponses will reduce the prediction capability of the model. As in other\nsettings, outliers in the data may harm estimations based on strong\nassumptions, such as normality of the response variable, leading to conclusions\nthat are not representative of the data set. In this work, we propose a family\nof robust estimators that estimate and select variables from both the linear\nand the additive part of the model simultaneously. This family considers an\nadaptive procedure on a general class of penalties in the regularization part\nof the objetive function that defines the estimators. We study the behaviour of\nthe proposal againts its least-squares counterpart under simulations and show\nthe advantages of its use on a real data set.",

We compare these results to environmental properties of\nthe galaxy, such as their time since infall and host halo mass, to constrain\nthe degree of ram pressure enhanced star formation as a function of\nenvironment. We find no significant differences between the satellite and the\nfield samples. We further restrict our sample to galaxies which we most expect\nto be experiencing significant ram pressure but find no strong evidence of\nthese galaxies having systematically enhanced star formation.

As a counterpoint, Deng, Mao, Sivan, and Wang (STOC 2022) show that\nif pricing power is delegated to the right person (either the seller or the\nbuyer), the resulting mechanism can guarantee at least a constant fraction of\nthe ideal (yet unattainable) gains from trade.\n  In practice, the agent with pricing power may not have perfect knowledge of\nthe value distribution of the other party, and instead may rely on samples of\nthat distribution to set a price. We show that for a broad class of sampling\nand pricing behaviors, the resulting market still guarantees a constant\nfraction of the ideal gains from trade in expectation.

The generation of benchmark data across this\ncombinatorial space is powered by a novel LLM-assisted data generation protocol\nthat we dub auto-STEER, which generates a set of questions by adapting\nhandwritten templates to target new domains and perspectives. Because it offers\nan automated way of generating fresh questions, auto-STEER mitigates the risk\nthat LLMs will be trained to over-fit evaluation benchmarks; we thus hope that\nit will serve as a useful tool both for evaluating and fine-tuning models for\nyears to come.

In\ncontrast, slower verbs (e.g., crawl, drag) convey passivity, monotony, and\nnegative emotions, reflecting tedious or constrained experiences of time. These\neffects are amplified in metaphorical contexts, where manner verbs encode\nemotional and experiential nuances that transcend their literal meanings. We\nalso find that participants prefer manner verbs over path verbs (e.g., go,\npass) in emotionally charged temporal contexts, as manner verbs capture the\nexperiential and emotional qualities of time more effectively.

    "abstract": "This paper offers a conceptual analysis of the transformative role of\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) in urban governance, focusing on how AI reshapes\ngovernance approaches, oversight mechanisms, and the relationship between\nbureaucratic discretion and accountability. Drawing on public administration\ntheory, tech-driven governance practices, and data ethics, the study\nsynthesizes insights to propose guiding principles for responsible AI\nintegration in decision-making processes. While primarily conceptual, the paper\ndraws on illustrative empirical cases to demonstrate how AI is reshaping\ndiscretion and accountability in real-world settings. The analysis argues that\nAI does not simply restrict or enhance discretion but redistributes it across\ninstitutional levels. It may simultaneously strengthen managerial oversight,\nenhance decision-making consistency, and improve operational efficiency. These\nchanges affect different forms of accountability: political, professional, and\nparticipatory, while introducing new risks, such as data bias, algorithmic\nopacity, and fragmented responsibility across actors. In response, the paper\nproposes guiding principles: equitable AI access, adaptive administrative\nstructures, robust data governance, and proactive human-led decision-making,\ncitizen-engaged oversight. This study contributes to the AI governance\nliterature by moving beyond narrow concerns with perceived discretion at the\nstreet level, highlighting instead how AI transforms rule-based discretion\nacross governance systems.

The parameters were obtained for the flat MaVaN\nmodel: Hubble constant $H_0=64.04^{+1.48}_{-3.69}~{\\rm km~s^{-1}Mpc^{-1}}$, the\nmodel parameter of the scalar field Ratra-Peebles potential\n$\\alpha=0.008^{+0.003}_{-0.006}$, the matter density parameter in the present\nepoch $\\Omega_{m0} = 0.341^{+0.056}_{-0.050}$, the sum of neutrino masses\n$m_\\nu\\leq0.396~{\\rm eV}$ ($1\\sigma$ confidence level); while for the non-flat\nMaVaN model: $H_0=67.72^{+3.50}_{-6.47}~{\\rm km~s^{-1}Mpc^{-1}}$,\n$\\alpha=0.01^{+0.004}_{-0.009}$, $\\Omega_{m0}=0.396^{+0.079}_{-0.046}$,\n$m_\\nu\\leq0.473~{\\rm eV}$ ($1\\sigma$ confidence level), the curvature density\nparameter in the present epoch $\\Omega_{k0}=-0.214^{+0.176}_{-0.187}$. We\nconclude that the $H_0$ tension is resolved in the flat MaVaN model within the\n$3\\sigma$ confidence level and in the non-flat MaVaN model within the $2\\sigma$\none.",

Many of the fuel assemblies\nmeasured during the campaign had much shorter cooling times than those\nassemblies previously measured with the instrument. Calibration curves\ndeveloped from previous AEFC deployments were used to determine the residual\nU-235 mass in the measured standard fuel assemblies.

    "abstract": "Recent studies reveal that vision-language models (VLMs) become more\nsusceptible to harmful requests and jailbreak attacks after integrating the\nvision modality, exhibiting greater vulnerability than their text-only LLM\nbackbones. To uncover the root cause of this phenomenon, we conduct an in-depth\nanalysis and identify a key issue: multimodal inputs introduce an\nmodality-induced activation shift toward a \"safer\" direction compared to their\ntext-only counterparts, leading VLMs to systematically overestimate the safety\nof harmful inputs. We refer to this issue as safety perception distortion. To\nmitigate such distortion, we propose Activation Shift Disentanglement and\nCalibration (ShiftDC), a training-free method that decomposes and calibrates\nthe modality-induced activation shift to reduce the impact of modality on\nsafety. By isolating and removing the safety-relevant component, ShiftDC\nrestores the inherent safety alignment of the LLM backbone while preserving the\nvision-language capabilities of VLMs. Empirical results demonstrate that\nShiftDC significantly enhances alignment performance on safety benchmarks\nwithout impairing model utility.",

In this paper, we\nare concerned with the global existence and nonlinear stability of\nfinite-energy solutions of the multidimensional Euler-Riesz equations with\nlarge initial data of spherical symmetry. We consider both attractive and\nrepulsive interactions for a wide range of Riesz and logarithmic potentials for\ndimensions larger than or equal to two. This is achieved by the inviscid limit\nof the solutions of the corresponding Cauchy problem for the\nNavier-Stokes-Riesz equations. The strong convergence of the vanishing\nviscosity solutions is achieved through delicate uniform estimates in $L^p$. It\nis observed that, even if the attractive potential is super-Coulomb, no\nconcentration is formed near the origin in the inviscid limit. Moreover, we\nprove that the nonlinear stability of global finite-energy solutions for the\nEuler-Riesz equations is unconditional under a spherically symmetric\nperturbation around the steady solutions. Unlike the Coulomb case where the\npotential can be represented locally, the singularity and regularity of the\nnonlocal radial Riesz potential near the origin require careful analysis, which\nis a crucial step. Finally, unlike the Coulomb case, a Gr\\\"onwall type estimate\nis required to overcome the difficulty of the appearance of boundary terms in\nthe sub-Coulomb case and the singularity of the super-Coulomb potential.\nFurthermore, we prove the nonlinear stability of global finite-energy solutions\nfor the compressible Euler-Riesz equations around steady states by employing\nconcentration compactness arguments.

We use the gigantic energy of\nKM3-230213A as an opportunity to challenge this expectation. For a neutrino of\na few hundred PeVs a transient source could have been observed at lower\nenergies several years earlier, even assuming the characteristic scale of\nin-vacuo dispersion to be close to the Planck scale. We report that GRB090401B\nis in excellent directional agreement with KM3-230213A, and we discuss a\nstrategy of in-vacuo-dispersion analysis suitable for estimating the\nsignificance of KM3-230213A as a GRB090401B-neutrino candidate.

The fluorescence emission maximum shifts\nfrom about 440 nm (blue channel) in condensed membranes (So) to about 490 nm\n(green channel) in the liquid-crystalline phase (L{\\alpha}). Although the\nfluorescence intensity based generalized polarization (GP) is widely used to\ncharacterize lipid membranes, the fluorescence lifetime of Laurdan, in the blue\nand the green channel, is less used for that purpose. Here we explore the\ncorrelation between GP and fluorescence lifetimes by spectroscopic measurements\non the So and L{\\alpha} phases of large unilamellar vesicles of DMPC and DPPC.\nA positive correlation between GP and the lifetimes is observed in each of the\noptical channels for the two lipid phases. Fluorescence intensities, GP and\nfluorescence lifetimes depend on the angle between the orientation of the\nlinear polarization of the excitation light and the local normal to the\nmembrane of the optical cross-section. This angular variation depends on the\nlipid phase and the emission channel. GP and fluorescence intensities in the\nblue and green channel in So and in the blue channel in L{\\alpha} exhibit a\nminimum near 90o. Surprisingly, the intensity in the green channel in L{\\alpha}\nreaches a maximum near 90o. The fluorescence lifetimes in the two optical\nchannels also reach a pronounced minimum near 90o in So and L{\\alpha}, apart\nfrom the lifetime in the blue channel in L{\\alpha} where the lifetime is short\nwith minimal angular variation.

    "abstract": "Modern DRAM chips are subject to read disturbance errors. State-of-the-art\nread disturbance mitigations rely on accurate and exhaustive characterization\nof the read disturbance threshold (RDT) (e.g., the number of aggressor row\nactivations needed to induce the first RowHammer or RowPress bitflip) of every\nDRAM row (of which there are millions or billions in a modern system) to\nprevent read disturbance bitflips securely and with low overhead. We\nexperimentally demonstrate for the first time that the RDT of a DRAM row\nsignificantly and unpredictably changes over time. We call this new phenomenon\nvariable read disturbance (VRD). Our experiments using 160 DDR4 chips and 4\nHBM2 chips from three major manufacturers yield two key observations. First, it\nis very unlikely that relatively few RDT measurements can accurately identify\nthe RDT of a DRAM row. The minimum RDT of a DRAM row appears after tens of\nthousands of measurements (e.g., up to 94,467), and the minimum RDT of a DRAM\nrow is 3.5X smaller than the maximum RDT observed for that row. Second, the\nprobability of accurately identifying a row's RDT with a relatively small\nnumber of measurements reduces with increasing chip density or smaller\ntechnology node size. Our empirical results have implications for the security\nguarantees of read disturbance mitigation techniques: if the RDT of a DRAM row\nis not identified accurately, these techniques can easily become insecure. We\ndiscuss and evaluate using a guardband for RDT and error-correcting codes for\nmitigating read disturbance bitflips in the presence of RDTs that change\nunpredictably over time. We conclude that a >10% guardband for the minimum\nobserved RDT combined with SECDED or Chipkill-like SSC error-correcting codes\ncould prevent read disturbance bitflips at the cost of large read disturbance\nmitigation performance overheads (e.g., 45% performance loss for an RDT\nguardband of 50%).",

For example, an AI may assist doctors in determining which diagnostic\ntests to run, but the doctor ultimately makes the diagnosis. This paper studies\nsuch AI-assisted decision-making settings, where the human learns through\nrepeated interactions with the algorithm. In our framework, the algorithm --\ndesigned to maximize decision accuracy according to its own model -- determines\nwhich features the human can consider. The human then makes a prediction based\non their own less accurate model. We observe that the discrepancy between the\nalgorithm's model and the human's model creates a fundamental tradeoff. Should\nthe algorithm prioritize recommending more informative features, encouraging\nthe human to recognize their importance, even if it results in less accurate\npredictions in the short term until learning occurs? Or is it preferable to\nforgo educating the human and instead select features that align more closely\nwith their existing understanding, minimizing the immediate cost of learning?\nThis tradeoff is shaped by the algorithm's time-discounted objective and the\nhuman's learning ability. Our results show that optimal feature selection has a\nsurprisingly clean combinatorial characterization, reducible to a stationary\nsequence of feature subsets that is tractable to compute. As the algorithm\nbecomes more \"patient\" or the human's learning improves, the algorithm\nincreasingly selects more informative features, enhancing both prediction\naccuracy and the human's understanding.

This study explores recent advancements in quantum\ncomputing such as device-aware quantum circuits, error suppression, and\nmitigation for medical image classification. Our methodology is comprised of\nthree stages: preprocessing, generation of noise-resilient and\nhardware-efficient quantum circuits, optimizing/training of quantum circuits on\nclassical hardware, and inference on real IBM quantum hardware. Firstly, we\nprocess all input images in the preprocessing stage to reduce the spatial\ndimension due to quantum hardware limitations. We generate hardware-efficient\nquantum circuits using backend properties expressible to learn complex patterns\nfor medical image classification. After classical optimization of QML models,\nwe perform inference on real quantum hardware. We also incorporate advanced\nerror suppression and mitigation techniques in our QML workflow, including\ndynamical decoupling (DD), gate twirling, and matrix-free measurement\nmitigation (M3) to mitigate the effects of noise and improve classification\nperformance.

Although there are numerous detection methods, they often struggle\nwith evolving attacks, dataset biases, and limited explainability. Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative with their zero-shot\ninference and reasoning capabilities. However, applying LLMs to Android malware\ndetection presents two key challenges: (1)the extensive support code in Android\napplications, often spanning thousands of classes, exceeds LLMs' context limits\nand obscures malicious behavior within benign functionality; (2)the structural\ncomplexity and interdependencies of Android applications surpass LLMs'\nsequence-based reasoning, fragmenting code analysis and hindering malicious\nintent inference. To address these challenges, we propose LAMD, a practical\ncontext-driven framework to enable LLM-based Android malware detection. LAMD\nintegrates key context extraction to isolate security-critical code regions and\nconstruct program structures, then applies tier-wise code reasoning to analyze\napplication behavior progressively, from low-level instructions to high-level\nsemantics, providing final prediction and explanation. A well-designed factual\nconsistency verification mechanism is equipped to mitigate LLM hallucinations\nfrom the first tier.

To address\nthese challenges, we propose ConsFormer, a self-supervised framework that\nleverages a Transformer as a solution refiner.

This study examines how\nease of use, perceived usefulness, trust, and risk perception interact to shape\nintentions to adopt DeepSeek, an emerging LLM-based platform, for healthcare\npurposes. A cross-sectional survey of 556 participants from India, the United\nKingdom, and the United States was conducted to measure perceptions and usage\npatterns. Structural equation modeling assessed both direct and indirect\neffects, including potential quadratic relationships. Results revealed that\ntrust plays a pivotal mediating role: ease of use exerts a significant indirect\neffect on usage intentions through trust, while perceived usefulness\ncontributes to both trust development and direct adoption. By contrast, risk\nperception negatively affects usage intent, emphasizing the importance of\nrobust data governance and transparency. Notably, significant non-linear paths\nwere observed for ease of use and risk, indicating threshold or plateau\neffects. The measurement model demonstrated strong reliability and validity,\nsupported by high composite reliabilities, average variance extracted, and\ndiscriminant validity measures. These findings extend technology acceptance and\nhealth informatics research by illuminating the multifaceted nature of user\nadoption in sensitive domains.

    "abstract": "Since the adoption of large language models (LLMs) for text evaluation has\nbecome increasingly prevalent in the field of natural language processing\n(NLP), a series of existing works attempt to optimize the prompts for LLM\nevaluators to improve their alignment with human judgment. However, their\nefforts are limited to optimizing individual factors of evaluation prompts,\nsuch as evaluation criteria or output formats, neglecting the combinatorial\nimpact of multiple factors, which leads to insufficient optimization of the\nevaluation pipeline. Nevertheless, identifying well-behaved prompting\nstrategies for adjusting multiple factors requires extensive enumeration. To\nthis end, we comprehensively integrate 8 key factors for evaluation prompts and\npropose a novel automatic prompting strategy optimization method called\nHeuristic Prompting Strategy Search (HPSS). Inspired by the genetic algorithm,\nHPSS conducts an iterative search to find well-behaved prompting strategies for\nLLM evaluators. A heuristic function is employed to guide the search process,\nenhancing the performance of our algorithm. Extensive experiments across four\nevaluation tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of HPSS, consistently\noutperforming both human-designed evaluation prompts and existing automatic\nprompt optimization methods.

Given\nlabeled data from a source domain and unlabeled data from a covariate shifted\ntarget domain, we seek to construct prediction sets with valid marginal\ncoverage in the target domain. Most existing methods require estimating the\nunknown likelihood ratio function, which can be prohibitive for\nhigh-dimensional data such as images. To address this challenge, we introduce\nthe likelihood ratio regularized quantile regression (LR-QR) algorithm, which\ncombines the pinball loss with a novel choice of regularization in order to\nconstruct a threshold function without directly estimating the unknown\nlikelihood ratio. We show that the LR-QR method has coverage at the desired\nlevel in the target domain, up to a small error term that we can control. Our\nproofs draw on a novel analysis of coverage via stability bounds from learning\ntheory.

In\nPaper I we developed a simple, axisymmetric galactic dynamo model that uses\nvarious observational data as input. Here we apply our model to calculate\nradial profiles of azimuthally and vertically averaged magnetic field strength\nand pitch angle, gas velocity dispersion and scale height, turbulent\ncorrelation time and length, and the sizes of supernova remnants for the\ngalaxies M31, M33, M51, and NGC 6946, using input data collected from the\nliterature. Scaling factors are introduced to account for a lack of precision\nin both theory and observation. Despite the simplicity of our model, its\noutputs agree fairly well with galaxy properties inferred from observation.\nAdditionally, we find that most of the parameter values are similar between\ngalaxies. We extend the model to predict the magnetic field pitch angles\narising from a combination of mean-field dynamo action and the winding up of\nthe random small-scale field owing to the large-scale radial shear. We find\ntheir magnitudes to be much smaller than those of the pitch angles measured in\npolarized radio and far infrared emission.

Unlike conventional knowledge graph\nconstruction methods relying on static extraction or single-pass learning, our\napproach couples a reasoning-native large language model with a continually\nupdated graph representation. At each step, the system actively generates new\nconcepts and relationships, merges them into a global graph, and formulates\nsubsequent prompts based on its evolving structure. Through this\nfeedback-driven loop, the model organizes information into a scale-free network\ncharacterized by hub formation, stable modularity, and bridging nodes that link\ndisparate knowledge clusters. Over hundreds of iterations, new nodes and edges\ncontinue to appear without saturating, while centrality measures and shortest\npath distributions evolve to yield increasingly distributed connectivity. Our\nanalysis reveals emergent patterns, such as the rise of highly connected 'hub'\nconcepts and the shifting influence of 'bridge' nodes, indicating that agentic,\nself-reinforcing graph construction can yield open-ended, coherent knowledge\nstructures. Applied to materials design problems, we present compositional\nreasoning experiments by extracting node-specific and synergy-level principles\nto foster genuinely novel knowledge synthesis, yielding cross-domain ideas that\ntranscend rote summarization and strengthen the framework's potential for\nopen-ended scientific discovery.

    "abstract": "Accurate human localization is crucial for various applications, especially\nin the Metaverse era. Existing high precision solutions rely on expensive,\ntag-dependent hardware, while vision-based methods offer a cheaper, tag-free\nalternative. However, current vision solutions based on stereo vision face\nlimitations due to rigid perspective transformation principles and error\npropagation in multi-stage SVD solvers. These solutions also require multiple\nhigh-resolution cameras with strict setup constraints.To address these\nlimitations, we propose a probabilistic approach that considers all points on\nthe human body as observations generated by a distribution centered around the\nbody's geometric center. This enables us to improve sampling significantly,\nincreasing the number of samples for each point of interest from hundreds to\nbillions. By modeling the relation between the means of the distributions of\nworld coordinates and pixel coordinates, leveraging the Central Limit Theorem,\nwe ensure normality and facilitate the learning process. Experimental results\ndemonstrate human localization accuracy of 96\\% within a 0.3$m$ range and\nnearly 100\\% accuracy within a 0.5$m$ range, achieved at a low cost of only 10\nUSD using two web cameras with a resolution of 640$\\times$480 pixels.",

However,\ndespite this enormous potential, most present-day data systems that leverage\nLLMs are reactive, reflecting our community's desire to map LLMs to known\nabstractions. Most data systems treat LLMs as an opaque black box that operates\non user inputs and data as is, optimizing them much like any other approximate,\nexpensive UDFs, in conjunction with other relational operators. Such data\nsystems do as they are told, but fail to understand and leverage what the LLM\nis being asked to do (i.e. the underlying operations, which may be\nerror-prone), the data the LLM is operating on (e.g., long, complex documents),\nor what the user really needs. They don't take advantage of the characteristics\nof the operations and/or the data at hand, or ensure correctness of results\nwhen there are imprecisions and ambiguities. We argue that data systems instead\nneed to be proactive: they need to be given more agency -- armed with the power\nof LLMs -- to understand and rework the user inputs and the data and to make\ndecisions on how the operations and the data should be represented and\nprocessed. By allowing the data system to parse, rewrite, and decompose user\ninputs and data, or to interact with the user in ways that go beyond the\nstandard single-shot query-result paradigm, the data system is able to address\nuser needs more efficiently and effectively. These new capabilities lead to a\nrich design space where the data system takes more initiative: they are\nempowered to perform optimization based on the transformation operations, data\ncharacteristics, and user intent. We discuss various successful examples of how\nthis framework has been and can be applied in real-world tasks, and present\nfuture directions for this ambitious research agenda.",

The exoskeleton, by eliminating the reliance on inverse dynamics,\ndelivers faster and more precise arm control. The gloves utilize Hall sensors\ninstead of servos, allowing even compact devices to achieve 15 or more degrees\nof freedom and freely adapt to any model of dexterous hands. Compared to\nprevious teleoperation systems, HOMIE stands out for its exceptional\nefficiency, completing tasks in half the time; its expanded working range,\nallowing users to freely reach high and low areas as well as interact with any\nobjects; and its affordability, with a price of just $500.

[Objective] This paper aims to identify and discuss the\nrelevance of code-related issues that lead to TD in ML code throughout the ML\nworkflow. [Method] The study first compiled a list of 34 potential issues\ncontributing to TD in ML code by examining the phases of the ML workflow, their\ntypical associated activities, and problem types. This list was refined through\ntwo focus group sessions involving nine experienced ML professionals, where\neach issue was assessed based on its occurrence contributing to TD in ML code\nand its relevance. [Results] The list of issues contributing to TD in the\nsource code of ML systems was refined from 34 to 30, with 24 of these issues\nconsidered highly relevant. The data pre-processing phase was the most\ncritical, with 14 issues considered highly relevant. Shortcuts in code related\nto typical pre-processing tasks (e.g., handling missing values, outliers,\ninconsistencies, scaling, rebalancing, and feature selection) often result in\n\"patch fixes\" rather than sustainable solutions, leading to the accumulation of\nTD and increasing maintenance costs. Relevant issues were also found in the\ndata collection, model creation and training, and model evaluation phases.\n[Conclusion] We have made the final list of issues available to the community\nand believe it will help raise awareness about issues that need to be addressed\nthroughout the ML workflow to reduce TD and improve the maintainability of ML\ncode.",

We focus on three systems, employing these mathematical frameworks to\nuncover subtle features within each. First, we examine Unruh radiation in the\ncontext of an accelerated two-state atom, determining transition frequencies\nfor a variety of accelerated trajectories via first-order perturbation theory.\nFor harmonic motion of the atom in a vacuum, we derive transition rates with\npotential experimental realizations. Next, we investigate the quantum Hall\neffect in a spherical geometry using the Dirac operator for non-interacting\nfermions in a background magnetic field generated by a Wu-Yang monopole. The\nAtiyah-Singer index theorem constrains the degeneracy of the ground state, and\nthe fractional quantum Hall effect is studied using the composite fermion\nmodel, where Dirac strings associated with the monopole field supply the\nstatistical gauge field vortices. A unique, gapped ground state emerges,\nyielding fractions of the form $\\nu = \\frac{1}{2k+1}$ for large particle\nnumbers. Finally, we examine the AdS/CMT correspondence through a bulk\nfermionic field in an RN-AdS$_4$ background (with a U(1) gauge field), dual to\na boundary fermionic operator. Spherical and planar event horizon geometries\nare discussed, with the temperature of the RN black hole identified with that\nof the dual system on the boundary. By numerically solving for the spectral\nfunctions of the dual theory, for a spherical event horizon at zero\ntemperature, we identify a shift in the Fermi surface from that which arises in\nthe planar case. Preliminary evidence of a phase transition emerges upon\nexamining these spectral functions, again for the spherical horizon, at\nnon-zero temperature.",

As worst-case analysis (adversarial inputs) may lead\nto the necessity of high running times, a natural question arises: in which\ncases are high running times really necessary, and in which cases these inputs\nmerely manifest unique pathological cases?\n  Early attempts to tackle this question were made by Nikoletseas, Reif,\nSpirakis and Yung (ICALP 1995) and by Alberts and Henzinger (Algorithmica\n1998), who considered models with very little adversarial control over the\ninputs, and showed fast algorithms exist for them. The question was then\noverlooked for decades, until Henzinger, Lincoln and Saha (SODA 2022) recently\naddressed uniformly random inputs, and presented algorithms and impossibility\nresults for several subgraph counting problems.\n  To tackle the above question more thoroughly, we employ smoothed analysis, a\ncelebrated framework introduced by Spielman and Teng (J. ACM, 2004). An input\nis proposed by an adversary but then a noisy version of it is processed by the\nalgorithm instead. Parameterized by the amount of adversarial control, this\ninput model fully interpolates between worst-case inputs and a uniformly random\ninput. Doing so, we extend impossibility results for some problems to the\nsmoothed model with only a minor quantitative loss. That is, we show that\npartially-adversarial inputs suffice to impose high running times for certain\nproblems. In contrast, we show that other problems become easy even with the\nslightest amount of noise. In addition, we study the interplay between the\nadversary and the noise, leading to three natural models of smoothed inputs,\nfor which we show a hierarchy of increasing complexity.",

Algorithms for learning domain models exist, yet it remains\nunclear whether learning a domain model and planning is an effective approach\nfor numeric planning environments, i.e., where states include discrete and\nnumeric state variables. In this work, we explore the benefits of learning a\nnumeric domain model and compare it with alternative model-free solutions. As a\ncase study, we use two tasks in Minecraft, a popular sandbox game that has been\nused as an AI challenge. First, we consider an offline learning setting, where\na set of expert trajectories are available to learn from. This is the standard\nsetting for learning domain models. We used the Numeric Safe Action Model\nLearning (NSAM) algorithm to learn a numeric domain model and solve new\nproblems with the learned domain model and a numeric planner. We call this\nmodel-based solution NSAM_(+p), and compare it to several model-free Imitation\nLearning (IL) and Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms. Empirical\nresults show that some IL algorithms can learn faster to solve simple tasks,\nwhile NSAM_(+p) allows solving tasks that require long-term planning and\nenables generalizing to solve problems in larger environments. Then, we\nconsider an online learning setting, where learning is done by moving an agent\nin the environment. For this setting, we introduce RAMP. In RAMP, observations\ncollected during the agent's execution are used to simultaneously train an RL\npolicy and learn a planning domain action model. This forms a positive feedback\nloop between the RL policy and the learned domain model.

    "abstract": "Characterizing bipolaron binding, and understanding how it depends on\nelectron-phonon interaction, is crucial to unraveling the nature of emergent\nmany-body states in strongly interacting electron-phonon systems. So far, most\nstudies of bipolarons have been limited to the Holstein model, in which the\ncoupling constant is momentum-independent. The paradigmatic example of\nmomentum-dependent electron-phonon interaction comes from the system in which\nphonon distortions modify electron hopping, the SSH model. Already individual\npolarons in the SSH model are richer than the Holstein model counterparts, and\nfeature a phase transition into the finite momentum ground state with\nincreasing electron-phonon interaction. In this paper, we use a variational\napproach to study bipolarons in the one-dimensional SSH model and discuss their\nground state, dispersion, and excitation spectra. We explore the full parameter\nrange of the system, including the adiabatic regime of slow phonons, which was\ninaccessible to previous theoretical studies. In agreement with earlier\nstudies, we find that in the anti-adiabatic strongly interacting regime,\nbipolarons have low effective mass. By contrast, in the adiabatic case, we find\nthat increasing electron-phonon interactions results in an exponential increase\nof the bipolaron mass. We establish the existence of multiple branches of bound\nexcited states of SSH bipolaron and discuss the signatures of these bound\nstates in dynamics. We show that in the anti-adiabatic regime, response\nfunctions obey a parity selection rule, that imposes symmetry constraints on\nthe excitation spectra and provides a clear signature of SSH bipolarons.",

A model trained\nprimarily on English data may struggle to generalize to languages with\ndifferent phonetic, tonal, and prosodic characteristics, leading to\ninconsistencies in objective assessments. This study investigates the\ncross-lingual performance of two speech quality models: NISQA, a CNN-based\nmodel, and a Transformer-based Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST) model. Both\nmodels were trained exclusively on English datasets containing over 49,000\nspeech samples and subsequently evaluated on speech in German, French,\nMandarin, Swedish, and Dutch. We analyze model performance using Pearson\nCorrelation Coefficient (PCC) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) across five\nspeech quality dimensions: coloration, discontinuity, loudness, noise, and MOS.\nOur findings show that while AST achieves a more stable cross-lingual\nperformance, both models exhibit noticeable biases. Notably, Mandarin speech\nquality predictions correlate highly with human MOS scores, whereas Swedish and\nDutch present greater prediction challenges. Discontinuities remain difficult\nto model across all languages.

    "abstract": "With the increasing availability of wearable devices, photoplethysmography\n(PPG) has emerged as a promising non-invasive tool for monitoring human\nhemodynamics. We propose a deep learning framework to estimate vascular age\n(AI-vascular age) from PPG signals, incorporating a distribution-aware loss to\naddress biases caused by imbalanced data. The model was developed using data\nfrom the UK Biobank (UKB), with 98,672 participants in the development cohort\nand 113,559 participants (144,683 data pairs) for clinical evaluation. After\nadjusting for key confounders, individuals with a vascular age gap (AI-vascular\nage minus calendar age) exceeding 9 years had a significantly higher risk of\nmajor adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) (HR = 2.37, p <\n0.005) and secondary outcomes, including diabetes (HR = 2.69, p < 0.005),\nhypertension (HR = 2.88, p < 0.005), coronary heart disease (HR = 2.20, p <\n0.005), heart failure (HR = 2.15, p < 0.005), myocardial infarction (HR = 2.51,\np < 0.005), stroke (HR = 2.55, p < 0.005), and all-cause mortality (HR = 2.51,\np < 0.005). Conversely, participants with a vascular age gap below -9 years\nexhibited a significantly lower incidence of these outcomes. We further\nevaluated the longitudinal applicability of AI-vascular age using serial PPG\ndata from the UKB, demonstrating its value in risk stratification by leveraging\nAI-vascular age at two distinct time points to predict future MACCE incidence.\nExternal validation was performed on a MIMIC-III-derived cohort (n = 2,343),\nwhere each one-year increase in vascular age gap was significantly associated\nwith elevated in-hospital mortality risk (OR = 1.02, p < 0.005). In conclusion,\nour study establishes AI-vascular age as a novel, non-invasive digital\nbiomarker for cardiovascular health assessment.",

The first procedure utilizes available\ninformation about the change point locations to compare multiple shape\nparameters of the HR over time.

For constrained variables, e.g. sea ice\nconcentration or stress, such an assumption does not hold. The variational\nautoencoder (VAE) is a machine learning (ML) technique that allows to map an\narbitrary distribution to/from a latent space in which the distribution is\nsupposedly closer to a Gaussian. We propose a novel hybrid DA-ML approach in\nwhich VAEs are incorporated in the DA procedure.

In\ntwin experiments with a simple circular model, whereby the circle represents an\nunderlying submanifold to be respected, we find that the use of a VAE ensures\nthat a posteri ensemble members lie close to the manifold containing the truth.\nFurthermore, online updating of the VAE is necessary and achievable when this\nmanifold varies in time, i.e. when it is non-stationary.

    "abstract": "Moving object segmentation plays a crucial role in understanding dynamic\nscenes involving multiple moving objects, while the difficulties lie in taking\ninto account both spatial texture structures and temporal motion cues. Existing\nmethods based on video frames encounter difficulties in distinguishing whether\npixel displacements of an object are caused by camera motion or object motion\ndue to the complexities of accurate image-based motion modeling. Recent\nadvances exploit the motion sensitivity of novel event cameras to counter\nconventional images' inadequate motion modeling capabilities, but instead lead\nto challenges in segmenting pixel-level object masks due to the lack of dense\ntexture structures in events. To address these two limitations imposed by\nunimodal settings, we propose the first instance-level moving object\nsegmentation framework that integrates complementary texture and motion cues.\nOur model incorporates implicit cross-modal masked attention augmentation,\nexplicit contrastive feature learning, and flow-guided motion enhancement to\nexploit dense texture information from a single image and rich motion\ninformation from events, respectively. By leveraging the augmented texture and\nmotion features, we separate mask segmentation from motion classification to\nhandle varying numbers of independently moving objects. Through extensive\nevaluations on multiple datasets, as well as ablation experiments with\ndifferent input settings and real-time efficiency analysis of the proposed\nframework, we believe that our first attempt to incorporate image and event\ndata for practical deployment can provide new insights for future work in\nevent-based motion related works.

    "abstract": "Censoring from above is a common problem with wage information as the\nreported wages are typically top-coded for confidentiality reasons. In\nadministrative databases the information is often collected only up to a\npre-specified threshold, for example, the contribution limit for the social\nsecurity system. While directly accounting for the censoring is possible for\nsome analyses, the most flexible solution is to impute the values above the\ncensoring point. This strategy offers the advantage that future users of the\ndata no longer need to implement possibly complicated censoring estimators.\nHowever, standard cross-sectional imputation routines relying on the classical\nTobit model to impute right-censored data have a high risk of introducing bias\nfrom uncongeniality (Meng, 1994) as future analyses to be conducted on the\nimputed data are unknown to the imputer. Furthermore, as we show using a\nlarge-scale administrative database from the German Federal Employment agency,\nthe classical Tobit model offers a poor fit to the data. In this paper, we\npresent some strategies to address these problems. Specifically, we use\nleave-one-out means as suggested by Card et al. (2013) to avoid biases from\nuncongeniality and rely on quantile regression or left censoring to improve the\nmodel fit. We illustrate the benefits of these modeling adjustments using the\nGerman Structure of Earnings Survey, which is (almost) unaffected by censoring\nand can thus serve as a testbed to evaluate the imputation procedures.",

To address the\nissue of cable slack, a cable-pretension mechanism is integrated to enhance the\nstability of long-distance cable transmission. Through a series of\ncomprehensive tests, D3-Arm demonstrated 1.29 mm average positioning error and\n2.0 kg payload capacity, proving the practicality of the proposed decoupling\nmechanisms in cable-driven robotic arm.",

    "abstract": "Limited by the context window size of Large Language Models(LLMs), handling\nvarious tasks with input tokens exceeding the upper limit has been challenging,\nwhether it is a simple direct retrieval task or a complex multi-hop reasoning\ntask. Although various methods have been proposed to enhance the long-context\nprocessing capabilities of LLMs, they either incur substantial post-training\ncosts, or require additional tool modules(e.g.,RAG), or have not shown\nsignificant improvement in realistic tasks. Our work observes the correlation\nbetween the attention distribution and generated answers across each layer, and\nestablishes the attention allocation aligns with retrieval-augmented\ncapabilities through experiments. Drawing on the above insights, we propose a\nnovel method InfiniRetri that leverages the LLMs's own attention information to\nenable accurate retrieval across inputs of infinitely length. Our evaluations\nindicate that InfiniRetri achieves 100% accuracy in the\nNeedle-In-a-Haystack(NIH) test over 1M tokens using a 0.5B parameter model,\nsurpassing other method or larger models and setting a new\nstate-of-the-art(SOTA). Moreover, our method achieves significant performance\nimprovements on real-world benchmarks, with a maximum 288% improvement. In\naddition, InfiniRetri can be applied to any Transformer-based LLMs without\nadditional training and substantially reduces inference latency and compute\noverhead in long texts. In summary, our comprehensive studies show\nInfiniRetri's potential for practical applications and creates a paradigm for\nretrievaling information using LLMs own capabilities under infinite-length\ntokens.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable emergent capabilities,\ntransforming the execution of functional tasks by leveraging external tools for\ncomplex problems that require specialized processing or up-to-date data. While\nexisting research expands LLMs access to diverse tools (e.g., program\ninterpreters, search engines, calculators), the necessity of using these tools\nis often overlooked, leading to indiscriminate tool invocation. This naive\napproach raises two key issues: increased latency due to unnecessary tool\ncalls, and potential errors resulting from faulty interactions with external\ntools. In this paper, we introduce meta-cognition as a proxy for LLMs\nself-assessment of their capabilities, reflecting the model's awareness of its\nown limitations. Based on this, we propose MeCo, an adaptive decision-making\nstrategy for external tool use. MeCo quantifies metacognitive scores by\ncapturing high-level cognitive signals in the representation space, guiding\nwhen to invoke tools. Notably, MeCo is fine-tuning-free and incurs minimal\ncost.

Existing attacks against FRS have\nlimitations, as they depend on specific models and prior knowledge, restricting\ntheir real-world applicability. In our exploration of practical FRS\nvulnerabilities, we devise a model-agnostic and prior-knowledge-free attack,\nnamed PIECK (Popular Item Embedding based Attack). The core module of PIECK is\npopular item mining, which leverages embedding changes during FRS training to\neffectively identify the popular items. Built upon the core module, PIECK\nbranches into two diverse solutions: The PIECKIPE solution employs an item\npopularity enhancement module, which aligns the embeddings of targeted items\nwith the mined popular items to increase item exposure. The PIECKUEA further\nenhances the robustness of the attack by using a user embedding approximation\nmodule, which approximates private user embeddings using mined popular items.\nUpon identifying PIECK, we evaluate existing federated defense methods and find\nthem ineffective against PIECK, as poisonous gradients inevitably overwhelm the\ncold target items. We then propose a novel defense method by introducing two\nregularization terms during user training, which constrain item popularity\nenhancement and user embedding approximation while preserving FRS performance.\nWe evaluate PIECK and its defense across two base models, three real datasets,\nfour top-tier attacks, and six general defense methods, affirming the efficacy\nof both PIECK and its defense.",

To address this, we propose two intuitive MoE-specific KD methods\nfor the first time: Knowledge Augmentation (KA) and Student-Aware Router (SAR),\nboth designed to effectively extract knowledge from all experts. Specifically,\nKA augments knowledge by sampling experts multiple times, while SAR uses all\nexperts and adjusts the expert weights through router training to provide\noptimal knowledge. Extensive experiments show that our methods outperform\nconventional KD methods, demonstrating their effectiveness for MoE teacher\nmodels.",

The majority of experimental realizations of active colloidal\ncubes rely on light actuation and or magnetic fields to have a persistent\nactive mechanism, and lack material versatility. Here we propose a system of\nactive bimetallic cubes whose propulsion mechanism is based on a catalytic\nreaction and study their behavior. We realize such a system from synthetic\nsilica cuboids and 3D printed micro cubes, followed by the deposition of gold\nand platinum layers on their surface. We characterize the colloids dynamics for\ndifferent thicknesses of the gold layer at low and high hydrogen peroxide\nconcentrations. We show that the thickness of the base gold layer has only a\nminor effect on the self propulsion speed and in addition induces a\ngravitational torque which leads to particles with a velocity director pointing\nout of the plane thus effectively suppressing propulsion. We find that a higher\nactive force can remedy the effects of torque, resulting in particle\norientations that are favorable for in plane propulsion. Finally, we use 3D\nprinting to compare our results to cubes made from a different material, size\nand roundness, and demonstrate that the speed scaling with increasing particle\nsize originates from the size-dependent drag. Our experiments extend\nfabrication of active cubes to different materials and propulsion mechanisms\nand highlight that the design of active particles with anisotropic shapes\nrequires consideration of the interplay between the shape and activity to\nachieve favorable sedimentation and efficient in plane propulsion.",

Then, they submit their local updates to the central\nserver, and the server aggregates the updates to create a global model.\nHowever, trained models usually perform worse than centralized models,\nespecially when the training data distribution is non-independent and\nidentically distributed (nonIID). NonIID data harms the accuracy and\nperformance of the model. Additionally, due to the centrality of federated\nlearning (FL) and the untrustworthiness of enterprises, traditional FL\nsolutions are vulnerable to security and privacy attacks. To tackle this issue,\nwe propose FedAnil, a secure blockchain enabled Federated Deep Learning Model\nthat improves enterprise models decentralization, performance, and tamper proof\nproperties, incorporating two main phases. The first phase addresses the nonIID\nchallenge (label and feature distribution skew). The second phase addresses\nsecurity and privacy concerns against poisoning and inference attacks through\nthree steps. Extensive experiments were conducted using the Sent140,\nFashionMNIST, FEMNIST, and CIFAR10 new real world datasets to evaluate FedAnils\nrobustness and performance. The simulation results demonstrate that FedAnil\nsatisfies FDL privacy preserving requirements. In terms of convergence\nanalysis, the model parameter obtained with FedAnil converges to the optimum of\nthe model parameter.

These improvements have however resulted in a considerable\nincrease both in size and complexity of these models. Along the environmental\nconcerns this issue raises, this prevents the deployment of such networks on\nconsumer-level devices, and precludes their use for real-time applications.\nMoreover, this appears contradictory with the specificity of the tasks for\nwhich these models are used, which are often simpler compared to extracting a\nrich, multi-purpose representation from any type of audio data. In this paper,\nwe address this issue with a simple, yet effective method to extract\nlightweight specialist subnetworks from large foundation models.

Although the abnormal or unexpected behavior caused by the bug may\nnot manifest immediately, it will eventually lead to program failures further\ndown the line. When such a program failure is observed, identifying the\nrelevant BIC can aid in the bug resolution process, because knowing the\noriginal intent and context behind the code change, as well as having a link to\nthe author of that change, can facilitate bug triaging and debugging. However,\nexisting BIC identification techniques have limitations. Bisection can be\ncomputationally expensive because it requires executing failing tests against\nprevious versions of the codebase. Other techniques rely on the availability of\nspecific post hoc artifacts, such as bug reports or bug fixes. In this paper,\nwe propose a technique called Fonte that aims to identify the BIC with a core\nconcept that a commit is more likely to be a BIC if it has more recently\nmodified code elements that are highly suspicious of containing the bug. To\nrealise this idea, Fonte leverages two fundamental relationships in software:\nthe failure-to-code relationship, which can be quantified through fault\nlocalisation techniques, and the code-to-commit relationship, which can be\nobtained from version control systems. Our empirical evaluation using 206\nreal-world BICs from open-source Java projects shows that Fonte significantly\noutperforms state-of-the-art BIC identification techniques, achieving up to\n45.8% higher MRR. We also report that the ranking scores produced by Fonte can\nbe used to perform weighted bisection. Finally, we apply Fonte to a large-scale\nindustry project with over 10M lines of code, and show that it can rank the\nactual BIC within the top five commits for 87% of the studied real\nbatch-testing failures, and save the BIC inspection cost by 32% on average.",

However, its efficiency is affected by the transition between\nnumerical induction and symbolical deduction, leading to high computational\ncosts in the worst-case scenario. Efforts on this issue remain to be limited.\nIn this paper, we identified three reasons why previous optimization algorithms\nfor ABL were not effective: insufficient utilization of prediction, symbol\nrelationships, and accumulated experience in successful abductive processes,\nresulting in redundant calculations to the knowledge base. To address these\nchallenges, we introduce an optimization algorithm named as Probabilistic\nSymbol Perception (PSP), which makes a smooth transition between induction and\ndeduction and keeps the correctness of ABL unchanged. We leverage probability\nas a bridge and present an efficient data structure, achieving the transfer\nfrom a continuous probability sequence to discrete Boolean sequences with low\ncomputational complexity.

    "abstract": "When complex SQL queries suffer slow executions despite query optimization,\nDBAs typically invoke automated query rewriting tools to recommend ``lean''\nequivalents that are conducive to faster execution. The rewritings are usually\nachieved via transformation rules, but these rules are limited in scope and\ndifficult to update in a production system. Recently, LLM-based techniques have\nalso been suggested, but they are prone to semantic and syntactic errors.\n  We investigate here how the remarkable cognitive capabilities of LLMs can be\nleveraged for performant query rewriting while incorporating safeguards and\noptimizations to ensure correctness and efficiency. Our study shows that these\ngoals can be progressively achieved through incorporation of (a) an ensemble\nsuite of basic prompts, (b) database-sensitive prompts via redundancy removal\nand selectivity-based rewriting rules, and (c) LLM token probability-guided\nrewrite paths. Further, a suite of logic-based and statistical tools can be\nused to check for semantic violations in the rewrites prior to DBA\nconsideration.\n  We have implemented the above LLM-infused techniques in the LITHE system, and\nevaluated complex analytic queries from standard benchmarks on contemporary\ndatabase platforms. The results show significant performance improvements for\nslow queries, over both SOTA rewriters and the native optimizer. For instance,\nwith TPC-DS on PostgreSQL, the GM of runtime speedups was a high 13.2 over the\nnative optimizer, whereas SOTA only gave 4.9.\n  Overall, LITHE is a promising step toward viable LLM-based advisory tools for\nameliorating enterprise query performance.",

Using a Bayesian population model applied to the collected\nmulti-wavelength data, we explore various physically motivated models to\ndescribe the relationship between observed richness and halo mass. Our analysis\nreveals the limitations of a simple lognormal scatter model in describing the\ndata. We rule out significant contamination by unvirialized objects at the\nhigh-richness end of the sample. While dedicated simulations offer a\nwell-fitting calibration of projection effects, our findings suggest the\npresence of redshift-dependent trends that these simulations may not have\ncaptured.

While Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)\ntechniques reduce trainable parameters, their reliance on floating-point\narithmetic creates fundamental incompatibilities with edge hardware. In this\nwork, we introduce a novel framework for on-device LLM fine-tuning that\neliminates the need for floating-point operations in both inference and\ntraining, named GSQ-Tuning. At its core is the Group-Shared Exponents Integer\nformat, which efficiently represents model parameters in integer format using\nshared exponents among parameter groups. When combined with LoRA-like adapters,\nthis enables fully integer-based fine-tuning that is both memory and compute\nefficient. We demonstrate that our approach achieves accuracy comparable to\nBF16-based fine-tuning while significantly reducing 1.85x memory usage.\nMoreover, compared to FP8, our method can reduce 5x power consumption and 11x\nchip area with same performance, making large-scale model adaptation feasible\non edge devices.",

However, current schema linking models still struggle\nwith missing relevant schema elements or an excess of redundant ones. A crucial\nreason for this is that commonly used metrics, recall and precision, fail to\ncapture relevant element missing and thus cannot reflect actual schema linking\nperformance. Motivated by this, we propose enhanced schema linking metrics by\nintroducing a restricted missing indicator. Accordingly, we introduce Knapsack\noptimization-based Schema Linking Approach (KaSLA), a plug-in schema linking\nmethod designed to prevent the missing of relevant schema elements while\nminimizing the inclusion of redundant ones. KaSLA employs a hierarchical\nlinking strategy that first identifies the optimal table linking and\nsubsequently links columns within the selected table to reduce linking\ncandidate space. In each linking process, it utilizes a knapsack optimization\napproach to link potentially relevant elements while accounting for a limited\ntolerance of potentially redundant ones. With this optimization, KaSLA-1.6B\nachieves superior schema linking results compared to large-scale LLMs,\nincluding deepseek-v3 with the state-of-the-art (SOTA) schema linking method.\nExtensive experiments on Spider and BIRD benchmarks verify that KaSLA can\nsignificantly improve the SQL generation performance of SOTA Text2SQL models by\nsubstituting their schema linking processes.",

However, despite notable\nadvances, There is a lack of a comprehensive review and understanding of how\nGNNs could improve DB systems. Therefore, this survey aims to bridge this gap\nby providing a structured and in-depth overview of GNNs for DB systems.\nSpecifically, we propose a new taxonomy that classifies existing methods into\ntwo key categories: (1) Relational Databases, which includes tasks like\nperformance prediction, query optimization, and text-to-SQL, and (2) Graph\nDatabases, addressing challenges like efficient graph query processing and\ngraph similarity computation. We systematically review key methods in each\ncategory, highlighting their contributions and practical implications. Finally,\nwe suggest promising avenues for integrating GNNs into Database systems.",

In particular, after considering the enantiomers of a chiral molecule\nas paradigmatic truly chiral systems, we rigorously show, under a quantum field\ntheoretically approach, that only a truly chiral influence such as the\n$Z^{0}$-mediated electroweak interaction can lift the degeneracy between\nenantiomers.

Current methods often struggle with domain-specific\nlimitations or low-quality object generation. To address these, we propose CAST\n(Component-Aligned 3D Scene Reconstruction from a Single RGB Image), a novel\nmethod for 3D scene reconstruction and recovery. CAST starts by extracting\nobject-level 2D segmentation and relative depth information from the input\nimage, followed by using a GPT-based model to analyze inter-object spatial\nrelationships. This enables the understanding of how objects relate to each\nother within the scene, ensuring more coherent reconstruction. CAST then\nemploys an occlusion-aware large-scale 3D generation model to independently\ngenerate each object's full geometry, using MAE and point cloud conditioning to\nmitigate the effects of occlusions and partial object information, ensuring\naccurate alignment with the source image's geometry and texture. To align each\nobject with the scene, the alignment generation model computes the necessary\ntransformations, allowing the generated meshes to be accurately placed and\nintegrated into the scene's point cloud. Finally, CAST incorporates a\nphysics-aware correction step that leverages a fine-grained relation graph to\ngenerate a constraint graph. This graph guides the optimization of object\nposes, ensuring physical consistency and spatial coherence. By utilizing Signed\nDistance Fields (SDF), the model effectively addresses issues such as\nocclusions, object penetration, and floating objects, ensuring that the\ngenerated scene accurately reflects real-world physical interactions.

    "abstract": "Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have recently extended their powerful reasoning\ncapabilities to safety checks-using chain-of-thought reasoning to decide\nwhether a request should be answered. While this new approach offers a\npromising route for balancing model utility and safety, its robustness remains\nunderexplored. To address this gap, we introduce Malicious-Educator, a\nbenchmark that disguises extremely dangerous or malicious requests beneath\nseemingly legitimate educational prompts. Our experiments reveal severe\nsecurity flaws in popular commercial-grade LRMs, including OpenAI o1/o3,\nDeepSeek-R1, and Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking. For instance, although OpenAI's o1\nmodel initially maintains a high refusal rate of about 98%, subsequent model\nupdates significantly compromise its safety; and attackers can easily extract\ncriminal strategies from DeepSeek-R1 and Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking without any\nadditional tricks. To further highlight these vulnerabilities, we propose\nHijacking Chain-of-Thought (H-CoT), a universal and transferable attack method\nthat leverages the model's own displayed intermediate reasoning to jailbreak\nits safety reasoning mechanism. Under H-CoT, refusal rates sharply\ndecline-dropping from 98% to below 2%-and, in some instances, even transform\ninitially cautious tones into ones that are willing to provide harmful content.\nWe hope these findings underscore the urgent need for more robust safety\nmechanisms to preserve the benefits of advanced reasoning capabilities without\ncompromising ethical standards.",

To address this issue, we draw inspiration from the\nArchetypal Analysis framework introduced by Cutler & Breiman (1994) and present\nArchetypal SAEs (A-SAE), wherein dictionary atoms are constrained to the convex\nhull of data. This geometric anchoring significantly enhances the stability of\ninferred dictionaries, and their mildly relaxed variants RA-SAEs further match\nstate-of-the-art reconstruction abilities. To rigorously assess dictionary\nquality learned by SAEs, we introduce two new benchmarks that test (i)\nplausibility, if dictionaries recover \"true\" classification directions and (ii)\nidentifiability, if dictionaries disentangle synthetic concept mixtures. Across\nall evaluations, RA-SAEs consistently yield more structured representations\nwhile uncovering novel, semantically meaningful concepts in large-scale vision\nmodels.",

We manually simulate fibre\nlosses critical for accurately determining host-contamination and use the 4MOST\nExposure Time Calculator to produce realistic, 4MOST-like, host-galaxy\ncontaminated spectra.

We\ninvestigate photometric cuts to transient magnitude and the transient's\nfraction of total fibre flux, finding that both can be used to improve non-SN\nIa transient classification completeness by 8--44% with SNe Ibc benefitting the\nmost and superluminous (SL) SNe the least. Finally, we present an example\nclassification plan for live classification and the predicted purities and\ncompleteness across five transient classes: Ia, Ibc, II, SL and non-SN\ntransients.

Around 05:44 UT on December 16$^{th}$,\n2017, hot jet-like structures lifted from a nearby active region and fell\nobliquely on one side of the prominence segment with velocities of\n$\\approx$45--65 km s$^{-1}$. These eruptions compressed the boundaries of the\nprominence and flux rope, forming an elongated reconnection region with inflow\nvelocities of 47--52 km s$^{-1}$ and 36--49 km s$^{-1}$ in the projected plane.\nA thin, elongated reconnection region was formed, with multiple magnetic plasma\nblobs propagating bidirectionally at velocities of 91--178 km s$^{-1}$. These\ndense blobs, associated with ongoing reconnection, may also be linked to the\nonset of Kelvin-Helmholtz (K-H) instability. The blobs are attributed to\nplasmoids, moving at slower speeds (91--178 km s$^{-1}$) due to the high\ndensity in the prominence segment. The dimensionless reconnection rate varied\nfrom 0.57--0.28, 0.53--0.26, and 0.41--0.20, indicating reconnection rate\nenhancement and supporting the forced reconnection scenario. After\nreconnection, the prominence plasma heated to 6 MK, releasing significant\nthermal energy ($\\approx$5.4$\\times$10$^{27}$ erg), which drained cool\nprominence plasma and heated it to coronal temperatures. The ubiquity of jets\nand outflows in the solar atmosphere makes the aforementioned of reconnection\nand possible co-existence of K-H instability potentially important for the\nmagnetic energy release and heating in the solar atmosphere.",

    "abstract": "We present a novel mechanism in which plasma electrons optically acquire\nangular momentum through local pump depletion. This process is facilitated by\nan azimuthally polarized laser that lacks angular momentum, yet enables\nelectron rotation through canonical momentum conservation. Through theoretical\nconsiderations and one- and three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations, we\ndemonstrate that the electrons acquire substantial angular momentum when the\nultra-intense ($I \\gtrsim 10^{19}$ W/cm$^2$) and ultra-short (tens of\nfemtoseconds) laser pulse excites a nonlinear wakefield in the bubble regime.\nDuring this process, the frequency at the laser's leading edge shifts down due\nto phase modulation. Following the conservation of the wave action, the laser's\nvector potential develops a long-wavelength offset that trails the main pulse\nand remains confined within the plasma bubble. This offset facilitates electron\nrotation of the bubble's sheath currents and the high-energy ($>100$ MeV)\nself-injected electrons. As the laser pulse front erodes, the long-wavelength\noffset of the vector potential increases and oscillates, influencing both the\nmagnitude and polarity of the electrons' angular momentum. By varying key laser\nparameters such as phase, frequency, and polarization, we show how to\nmanipulate and control the transverse momentum space of high-energy electrons.",

Due to\ncomplex measurement environments and technical limitations, obtaining complete\ntemperature information for reservoirs is highly challenging. Therefore,\naccurately reconstructing the temperature field from a small number of local\ndata points has become a critical scientific issue. To address this, the study\nemploys Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) and sparse representation methods\nto reconstruct the temperature field based on temperature data from a limited\nnumber of local measurement points. The results indicate that satisfactory\nreconstruction can be achieved when the number of POD basis functions is set to\n2 and the number of measurement points is 10. Under different water intake\ndepths, the reconstruction errors of both POD and sparse representation methods\nremain stable at around 0.15, fully validating the effectiveness of these\nmethods in reconstructing the temperature field based on limited local\ntemperature data. Additionally, the study further explores the distribution\ncharacteristics of reconstruction errors for POD and sparse representation\nmethods under different water level intervals, analyzing the optimal\nmeasurement point layout scheme and potential limitations of the reconstruction\nmethods in this case. This research not only effectively reduces measurement\ncosts and computational resource consumption but also provides a new technical\napproach for reservoir temperature analysis, holding significant theoretical\nand practical importance.",

The surrogate is then exploited to define\nthe next point to sample, through a careful balance of exploration and\nexploitation. Initially intended for low-dimensional spaces, BO has recently\nbeen modified and used also for very large-dimensional spaces (up to about one\nthousand dimensions).\n  In this paper we consider a much simpler algorithm, called \"Reactive Affine\nShaker\" (RAS). The next sample is always generated with a uniform probability\ndistribution inside a parallelepiped (the \"box\"). At each iteration, the form\nof the box is adapted during the search through an affine transformation, based\nonly on the point $\\boldsymbol x$ position and on the success or failure in\nimproving the function. The function values are therefore not used directly to\nmodify the search area and to generate the next sample.

For example, the handling of specifications given by\nnondeterministic automata over infinite words for the problems of reactive\nsynthesis or runtime verification requires resolving nondeterministic choices\nwithout knowing the future of the input word. We define and study classes of\n$\\omega$-regular automata for which the nondeterminism can be resolved by a\npolicy that uses a combination of memory and randomness on any input word,\nbased solely on the prefix read so far.\n  We examine two settings for providing the input word to an automaton. In the\nfirst setting, called adversarial resolvability, the input word is constructed\nletter-by-letter by an adversary, dependent on the resolver's previous\ndecisions. In the second setting, called stochastic resolvability, the\nadversary pre-commits to an infinite word and reveals it letter-by-letter. In\neach setting, we require the existence of an almost-sure resolver, i.e., a\npolicy that ensures that as long as the adversary provides a word in the\nlanguage of the underlying nondeterministic automaton, the run constructed by\nthe policy is accepting with probability 1.\n  The class of automata that are adversarially resolvable is the well-studied\nclass of history-deterministic automata. The case of stochastically resolvable\nautomata, on the other hand, defines a novel class. Restricting the class of\nresolvers in both settings to stochastic policies without memory introduces two\nadditional new classes of automata.

    "abstract": "This paper reports on an automated control strategy to set and stabilize a\n2x2 integrated optical gate implemented with a balanced Mach-Zehnder\ninterferometer (MZI). The control strategy reliably configures the gate in any\ndesired working point without any prior calibration or complex algorithm for\nthe correction of hardware non-idealities. It has been tested on a multistage\nsilicon photonic chip comprising a coherent input vector generator, the 2x2\ngate used as matrix-vector multiplier and a coherent receiver for phase\nmeasurement. By leveraging the presence of transparent photodiodes in key\npositions, precise control of light beams in any point of the circuit is\nobtained, which translates into a resolution in the computation of the\nmatrix-vector product of 7.2 and 8.5 bits for the output power and phase,\nrespectively. High accuracy, robustness against non-idealities and stability\nover long-term operation, ensured by the feedback-controlled architecture,\nprovide scalability towards optical processors of any size. Additionally, the\npossibility of using the MZI both as computing gate and phase validation unit\navoids propagation of programming errors, solving a significant issue of\ncoherent optical computing architectures.",

In this\nwork, we focus on leveraging a programmatically generated arithmetic dataset to\nenhance the reasoning capabilities of smaller models. We investigate two key\napproaches to incorporate this dataset -- (1) intermediate fine-tuning, where a\nmodel is fine-tuned on the arithmetic dataset before being trained on a\nreasoning dataset, and (2) integrating the arithmetic dataset into the\ninstruction-tuning mixture, allowing the model to learn arithmetic skills\nalongside general instruction-following abilities. Our experiments on multiple\nreasoning benchmarks demonstrate that incorporating an arithmetic dataset,\nwhether through targeted fine-tuning or within the instruction-tuning mixture,\nenhances the models' arithmetic capabilities, which in turn improves their\nmathematical reasoning performance.",

There are more than 25 such indices\navailable, recently surveyed in a book by Fischer et al. They are used to rank\nrooted binary trees on a scale from the most balanced to the least balanced. We\nshow that a wide range of subtree-size based measures satisfying concavity and\nmonotonicity conditions are minimized by the complete or greedy-from-the-bottom\n(GFB) tree and maximized by the caterpillar tree, yielding an infinitely large\nfamily of distinct new imbalance indices. Answering an open question from the\nliterature, we show that one such established measure, the $\\widehat{s}$-shape\nstatistic, has the GFB tree as its unique minimizer. We also provide an\nalternative characterization of GFB trees, showing that they are equivalent to\ncomplete trees, which arise in different contexts. We give asymptotic bounds on\nthe expected $\\widehat{s}$-shape statistic under the uniform and Yule-Harding\ndistributions of trees, and answer questions for the related $Q$-shape\nstatistic as well.",

The\nmechanization was designed to be faithful to the original pen-and-paper\ndevelopment, and it was engineered to be modular and extensible.

To address this, we applied quantum feedback\ncontrol to the charger and investigated the effects of fermionic and bosonic\nthermal reservoirs on the performance of quantum batteries, including stored\nenergy, ergotropy, and charging efficiency, in an open environment. Our\nfindings reveal that, regardless of the type of thermal reservoir, the system\nexhibits optimal charging parameters. In particular, in a fermionic thermal\nreservoir, increasing the environmental temperature enhances battery\nperformance, enabling stable and efficient charging. In contrast, within a\nbosonic thermal reservoir, higher temperatures hinder energy storage and\nextraction, significantly reducing charging efficiency.

    "abstract": "The recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized\nindustries such as finance, marketing, and customer service by enabling\nsophisticated natural language processing tasks. However, the broad adoption of\nLLMs brings significant challenges, particularly in the form of social biases\nthat can be embedded within their outputs. Biases related to gender, age, and\nother sensitive attributes can lead to unfair treatment, raising ethical\nconcerns and risking both company reputation and customer trust. This study\nexamined bias in finance-related marketing slogans generated by LLMs (i.e.,\nChatGPT) by prompting tailored ads targeting five demographic categories:\ngender, marital status, age, income level, and education level. A total of\n1,700 slogans were generated for 17 unique demographic groups, and key terms\nwere categorized into four thematic groups: empowerment, financial, benefits\nand features, and personalization. Bias was systematically assessed using\nrelative bias calculations and statistically tested with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov\n(KS) test against general slogans generated for any individual. Results\nrevealed that marketing slogans are not neutral; rather, they emphasize\ndifferent themes based on demographic factors. Women, younger individuals,\nlow-income earners, and those with lower education levels receive more distinct\nmessaging compared to older, higher-income, and highly educated individuals.\nThis underscores the need to consider demographic-based biases in AI-generated\nmarketing strategies and their broader societal implications. The findings of\nthis study provide a roadmap for developing more equitable AI systems,\nhighlighting the need for ongoing bias detection and mitigation efforts in\nLLMs.",

More recently, they have been applied to analyzing physiological\ntime-series like wearable data for health insight extraction. Existing methods\nembed raw numerical sequences directly into prompts, which exceeds token limits\nand increases computational costs. Additionally, some studies integrated\nfeatures extracted from time-series in textual prompts or applied multimodal\napproaches. However, these methods often produce generic and unreliable outputs\ndue to LLMs' limited analytical rigor and inefficiency in interpreting\ncontinuous waveforms. In this paper, we develop an LLM-powered agent for\nphysiological time-series analysis aimed to bridge the gap in integrating LLMs\nwith well-established analytical tools. Built on the OpenCHA, an open-source\nLLM-powered framework, our agent powered by OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model\nfeatures an orchestrator that integrates user interaction, data sources, and\nanalytical tools to generate accurate health insights. To evaluate its\neffectiveness, we implement a case study on heart rate (HR) estimation from\nPhotoplethysmogram (PPG) signals using a dataset of PPG and Electrocardiogram\n(ECG) recordings in a remote health monitoring study. The agent's performance\nis benchmarked against OpenAI GPT-4o-mini and GPT-4o, with ECG serving as the\ngold standard for HR estimation.

Specifically, NTP-INT consists of\nthree modules: network traffic prediction module, network pruning module, and\nprobe path planning module. Firstly, the network traffic prediction module\nadopts a Multi-Temporal Graph Neural Network (MTGNN) to predict future network\ntraffic and identify high-load switches. Then, we design the network pruning\nalgorithm to generate a subnetwork covering all high-load switches to reduce\nthe complexity of probe path planning. Finally, the probe path planning module\nuses an attention-mechanism-based deep reinforcement learning (DEL) model to\nplan efficient probe paths in the network slice. The experimental results\ndemonstrate that NTP-INT can acquire more precise network information on\nhigh-load switches while decreasing the control overhead by 50\\%.",

Thus far, empirical and theoretical\nstudies of Wolbachia release have tended to focus on the dynamics at the\ncommunity scale. However, Ae. aegypti mosquitoes typically dwell in and around\nthe same houses as the people they bite and it can be insightful to explore\nwhat happens at the household scale where small population sizes lead to\ninherently stochastic dynamics. Here we use a continuous-time Markov framework\nto develop a stochastic household model for small populations of wildtype and\nWolbachia-infected mosquitoes. We investigate the transient and long term\ndynamics of the system, in particular examining the impact of stochasticity on\nthe Wolbachia invasion threshold and bistability between the wildtype-only and\nWolbachia-only steady states previously observed in deterministic models. We\nfocus on the influence of key parameters which determine the fitness cost of\nWolbachia infection and the probability of Wolbachia vertical transmission.\nUsing Markov and matrix population theory, we derive salient characteristics of\nthe system including the probability of successful Wolbachia invasion, the\nexpected time until invasion and the probability that a Wolbachia-infected\npopulation reverts to a wildtype population. These attributes can inform\nstrategies for the release of Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes. In addition, we\nfind that releasing the minimum number of Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes\nrequired to displace a resident wildtype population according to the\ndeterministic model, only results in that outcome about 20% of the time in the\nstochastic model; a significantly larger release is required to reach a steady\nstate composed entirely of Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes 90% of the time.",

Here, we take a gene's eye-view\nof the system, starting from an explicit finite-loci model with selection,\ndrift, recombination and mutation, in which the trait value is a direct product\nof the genome. We let the number of loci go to infinity under the assumption of\nstrong recombination, and characterize the limit behavior of a given locus with\na McKean-Vlasov SDE and the corresponding Fokker-Planck IPDE. In words, the\nselection on a typical locus depends on the mean behaviour of the other loci\nwhich can be approximated with the law of the focal locus.

    "abstract": "Detecting stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) from cosmic strings\nis crucial for unveiling the evolutionary laws of the early universe and\nvalidating non-standard cosmological models. This study presents the first\nsystematic evaluation of the detection capabilities of next-generation\nground-based gravitational wave detector networks for cosmic strings. By\nconstructing a hybrid signal model incorporating multi-source astrophysical\nforeground noise, including compact binary coalescences (CBCs) and compact\nbinary hyperbolic encounters (CBHEs), we propose an innovative parameter\nestimation methodology based on multi-component signal separation. Numerical\nsimulations using one-year observational data reveal three key findings: (1)\nThe CE4020ET network, comprising the Einstein Telescope (ET-10 km) and the\nCosmic Explorer (CE-40 km and CE-20 km), achieves nearly one order of magnitude\nimprovement in constraining the cosmic string tension $G\\mu$ compared to\nindividual detectors, reaching a relative uncertainty $\\Delta G\\mu / G\\mu <\n0.5$ for $G\\mu > 3.5 \\times 10^{-15}$ under standard cosmological framework;\n(2) The network demonstrates enhanced parameter resolution in non-standard\ncosmological scenarios, providing a novel approach to probe pre-Big Bang\nNucleosynthesis cosmic evolution; (3) Enhanced detector sensitivity amplifies\nCBHE foreground interference in parameter estimation, while precise modeling of\nsuch signals could further refine $G\\mu$ constraints by $1-2$ orders of\nmagnitude. This research not only quantifies the detection potential of\nthird-generation detector networks for cosmic string models but also elucidates\nthe intrinsic connection between foreground modeling precision and cosmological\nparameter estimation accuracy, offering theoretical foundations for optimizing\nscientific objectives of next-generation gravitational wave observatories.",

    "abstract": "The scaling of Si transistor technology has resulted in a remarkable\nimprovement in the performance of integrated circuits over the last decades.\nHowever, scaled transistors also require reduced electrical interconnect\ndimensions, which lead to greater losses and power dissipation at circuit\nlevel. This is mainly caused by enhanced surface scattering of charge carriers\nin copper interconnect wires at dimensions below 30 nm. A promising approach to\nmitigate this issue is to use directional conductors, i.e. materials with\nanisotropic Fermi surface, where proper alignment of crystalline orientation\nand transport direction can minimize surface scattering. In this work, we\nperform a resistivity scaling study of the anisotropic semimetal NbP as a\nfunction of crystalline orientation. We use here focused ion beam to pattern\nand scale down NbP crystallites to dimensions comparable to the electron\nscattering length at cryogenic temperatures. The experimental transport\nproperties are correlated with the Fermi surface characteristics through a\ntheoretical model, thus identifying the physical mechanisms that influence the\nresistivity scaling of anisotropic conductors. Our methodology provides an\neffective approach for early evaluation of anisotropic materials as future\nultra-scalable interconnects, even when they are unavailable as epitaxial\nfilms.",

Developers can leverage smart contracts to run various complex\ndecentralized applications on top of blockchains. However, the increasing\nnumber of EVM-compatible blockchains has introduced significant challenges in\ncross-chain interoperability, particularly in ensuring efficiency and atomicity\nfor the whole cross-chain application. Existing solutions are either limited in\nguaranteeing overall atomicity for the cross-chain application, or inefficient\ndue to the need for multiple rounds of cross-chain smart contract execution. To\naddress this gap, we propose IntegrateX, an efficient cross-chain\ninteroperability system that ensures the overall atomicity of cross-chain smart\ncontract invocations. The core idea is to deploy the logic required for\ncross-chain execution onto a single blockchain, where it can be executed in an\nintegrated manner. This allows cross-chain applications to perform all\ncross-chain logic efficiently within the same blockchain. IntegrateX consists\nof a cross-chain smart contract deployment protocol and a cross-chain smart\ncontract integrated execution protocol. The former achieves efficient and\nsecure cross-chain deployment by decoupling smart contract logic from state,\nand employing an off-chain cross-chain deployment mechanism combined with\non-chain cross-chain verification. The latter ensures atomicity of cross-chain\ninvocations through a 2PC-based mechanism, and enhances performance through\ntransaction aggregation and fine-grained state lock.

The ultimate\nobjective is to facilitate a rapid and precise estimation of sound velocity\ndistribution within a specified task area. Experimental results show that the\nmethod proposed in this paper has lower root mean square error (RMSE) and\nstronger robustness than other state-of-the-art methods.",

In addition to remote observations, space will open the possibility\nof in situ science similarly to the passage of 1986. In this paper, we first\ndiscuss the scientific motivations for a rendezvous mission, capable to\novercome the limitations of the flyby missions that took place at that time. In\nthe second part, we describe an example of a rendezvous trajectory that can be\ncarried out with existing power and propulsion technologies. The transfer is\nmade possible by the gravitational assistance of a giant planet. The resulting\nmission will be capable to reach the comet beyond the distance of Saturn, when\nthe sublimation of super-volatile species will be ongoing, and well before the\nonset of the sublimation of water (4 AU). After rendezvous, the spacecraft will\naccompany the comet for several years before, around and after perihelion (July\n2061). Our concept mission does not foresee the implementation of solar panels.\nIn this way, operations can occur even inside the dense dust coma at short\ndistance from the nucleus. In the third part of the paper, an innovative\nimaging system is proposed, with a very large field of view (100{\\deg}) capable\nto record on the same frame details on the surface and the surrounding space,\nin order to follow for several degrees the trajectories of chunks and clouds\nejected by pits or fractures, crucial to the understanding of the cometary\nactivity. A concerted effort is needed in the current decade to plan and\napprove a rendezvous mission to 1P. Indeed, the scenario here described\nrequires launching before 2040, less than 15 years from now. Later launches\nimply a severe loss of scientific knowledge, because the spacecraft will not be\nable to reach the comet before the onset of water sublimation.",

However, data analysis has been\nan ongoing challenge in the area since the peaks that represent chemical\nfactors may drift over the course of several analytical runs along the first\nand second dimension retention times. This makes higher-level analyses of the\ndata difficult, since a 1-1 comparison of samples is seldom possible without\nsophisticated pre-processing routines. Further complicating the issue is the\nfact that closely co-eluting components will need to be resolved, typically\nusing some variants of Parallel Factor Analysis (PARAFAC), Multivariate Curve\nResolution (MCR), or the recently explored Shift-Invariant Multi-linearity.\nThese algorithms work with a user-specified number of components, and regions\nof interest that are then summarized as a peak table that is invariant to\nshift. However, identifying regions of interest across truly heterogeneous data\nremains an ongoing issue, for automated deployment of these algorithms. This\nwork offers a very simple solution to the alignment problem through a\northogonal Procrustes analysis of the frequency-domain representation of\nsynthetic multidimensional separations data, for peaks that are logarithmically\ntransformed to simulate shift while preserving the underlying topology of the\ndata.

    "abstract": "Many problems in astrophysics cover multiple orders of magnitude in spatial\nand temporal scales. While simulating systems that experience rapid changes in\nthese conditions, it is essential to adapt the (time-) step size to capture the\nbehavior of the system during those rapid changes and use a less accurate time\nstep at other, less demanding, moments. We encounter three problems with\ntraditional methods. Firstly, making such changes requires expert knowledge of\nthe astrophysics as well as of the details of the numerical implementation.\nSecondly, some parameters that determine the time-step size are fixed\nthroughout the simulation, which means that they do not adapt to the rapidly\nchanging conditions of the problem. Lastly, we would like the choice of\ntime-step size to balance accuracy and computation effort. We address these\nchallenges with Reinforcement Learning by training it to select the time-step\nsize dynamically. We use the integration of a system of three equal-mass bodies\nthat move due to their mutual gravity as an example of its application. With\nour method, the selected integration parameter adapts to the specific\nrequirements of the problem, both in terms of computation time and accuracy\nwhile eliminating the expert knowledge needed to set up these simulations. Our\nmethod produces results competitive to existing methods and improve the results\nfound with the most commonly-used values of time-step parameter. This method\ncan be applied to other integrators without further retraining. We show that\nthis extrapolation works for variable time-step integrators but does not\nperform to the desired accuracy for fixed time-step integrators.",

    "abstract": "Authors: Yifan Xu Abstract: Conventional wind power prediction methods often\nstruggle to provide accurate and reliable predictions in the presence of sudden\nchanges in wind speed and power output. To address this challenge, this study\nproposes an integrated algorithm that combines a wind speed mutation\nidentification algorithm, an optimized similar period matching algorithm and a\nwind power prediction algorithm. By exploiting the convergence properties of\nmeteorological events, the method significantly improves the accuracy of wind\npower prediction under sudden meteorological changes. Firstly, a novel adaptive\nmodel based on variational mode decomposition, the VMD-IC model, is developed\nfor identifying and labelling key turning points in the historical wind power\ndata, representing abrupt meteorological environments. At the same time, this\npaper proposes Ramp Factor (RF) indicators and wind speed similarity\ncoefficient to optimize the definition algorithm of the current wind power ramp\nevent (WPRE). After innovating the definition of climbing and denoising\nalgorithm, this paper uses the Informer deep learning algorithm to output the\nfirst two models as well as multimodal data such as NWP numerical weather\nforecasts to achieve accurate wind forecasts. The experimental results of the\nablation study confirm the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed wind\nslope identification method. Compared with existing methods, the proposed model\nexhibits excellent performance and provides valuable guidance for the safe and\ncost-effective operation of power systems.",

    "abstract": "In his 1856 Adams Prize essay, James Clark Maxwell demonstrated that Saturn's\nrings cannot be comprised of a uniform rigid body. This is a consequence of the\ntwo-body gravitational interaction between a ring and planet resulting in\ninstability. Similarly, it is also known that a so-called Dyson sphere\nencompassing a single star would be unstable due to Newton's shell theorem. A\nsurprising finding is reported here that both a ring and a sphere (shell) can\nbe stable in the restricted three-body problem. First, if two primary masses\nare considered in orbit about their common centre of mass, a large, uniform,\ninfinitesimal ring enclosing the smaller of the masses can in principle be\nstable under certain conditions. Similarly, a Dyson sphere can, be stable, if\nthe sphere encloses the smaller of the two primary masses, again under certain\nconditions. These findings extend Maxwell's results on the dynamics of rings\nand have an interesting bearing on so-called Ringworlds and Dyson spheres from\nfiction. Moreover, the existence of passively stable orbits for such\nlarge-scale structures may have implications for so-called techno-signatures in\nsearch for extra-terrestrial intelligence studies.",

    "abstract": "One of the main concerns while deploying machine learning models in\nreal-world applications is fairness. Counterfactual fairness has emerged as an\nintuitive and natural definition of fairness. However, existing methodologies\nfor enforcing counterfactual fairness seem to have two limitations: (i)\ngenerating counterfactual samples faithful to the underlying causal graph, and\n(ii) as we argue in this paper, existing regularizers are mere proxies and do\nnot directly enforce the exact definition of counterfactual fairness. In this\nwork, our aim is to mitigate both issues. Firstly, we propose employing Neural\nCausal Models (NCMs) for generating the counterfactual samples. For\nimplementing the abduction step in NCMs, the posteriors of the exogenous\nvariables need to be estimated given a counterfactual query, as they are not\nreadily available. As a consequence, $\\mathcal{L}_3$ consistency with respect\nto the underlying causal graph cannot be guaranteed in practice due to the\nestimation errors involved. To mitigate this issue, we propose a novel kernel\nleast squares loss term that enforces the $\\mathcal{L}_3$ constraints\nexplicitly. Thus, we obtain an improved counterfactual generation suitable for\nthe counterfactual fairness task. Secondly, we propose a new MMD-based\nregularizer term that explicitly enforces the counterfactual fairness\nconditions into the base model while training. We show an improved trade-off\nbetween counterfactual fairness and generalization over existing baselines on\nsynthetic and benchmark datasets.",

The spiking mechanism facilitates\nsparse encoding, enabling spatial and temporal data to be represented in a\ndiscrete manner. However, SNNs still lag behind artificial neural networks\n(ANNs) in terms of performance and computational efficiency. One major\nchallenge in SNNs is the timestep-wise iterative update of neuronal states,\nwhich makes it difficult to achieve an optimal trade-off among accuracy,\nlatency, and training cost. Although some methods perform well with shorter\ntimesteps, few propose strategies to overcome such constraint effectively.\nMoreover, many recent SNN advancements rely on either optimizations tailored to\nspecific architectures or a collection of specialized neuron-level strategies.\nWhile these approaches can enhance performance, they often lead to increased\ncomputational expense and restrict their application to particular\narchitectures or modalities. This leaves room for further exploration of\nsimple, universal, and structure-agnostic strategies that could offer broader\napplicability and efficiency. In this paper, we introduce Activation-wise\nMembrane Potential Propagation (AMP2), a novel state update mechanism for\nspiking neurons. Inspired by skip connections in deep networks, AMP2\nincorporates the membrane potential of neurons into network, eliminating the\nneed for iterative updates.

    "abstract": "Jupiter's poles feature striking polygons of cyclones that drift westward\nover time-a motion governed by beta-drift. This study investigates how\nbeta-drift and the resulting westward motion depend on the depth of these\ncyclones. Counterintuitively, shallower cyclones drift more slowly, a\nconsequence of stronger vortex stretching. By employing a 2D quasi-geostrophic\nmodel of Jupiter's polar regions, we constrain the cyclones' deformation\nradius, a key parameter that serves as a proxy for their vertical extent,\nrequired to replicate the observed westward drift. We then explore possible\nvertical structures and the static stability of the poles by solving the\neigenvalue problem that links the 2D model to a 3D framework, matching the\nconstrained deformation radius. These findings provide a foundation for\ninterpreting upcoming Juno microwave measurements of Jupiter's north pole,\noffering insights into the static stability and vertical structure of the polar\ncyclones. Thus, by leveraging long-term motion as a novel constraint on\nvertical dynamics, this work sets the stage for advancing our understanding of\nthe formation and evolution of Jupiter's enigmatic polar cyclones.",

Architectural constraints and training instability in energy\nparameterized models have so far yielded inferior performance compared to\ndirectly approximating the score or denoiser. We address these deficiencies by\nintroducing a novel training regime for the energy function through\ndistillation of pre-trained diffusion models, resembling a Helmholtz\ndecomposition of the score vector field.

    "abstract": "Time domain simulations are crucial for analyzing transient behavior and\nbroadband responses in electromagnetic problems. However, conventional\nnumerical methods such as finite element method in time domain (FEMTD) and\nfinite difference time domain, can be computationally demanding due to their\nhigh-dimensional nature, making large-scale simulations impractical for design\noptimization and real-time analysis.\n  This paper introduces TA-ROMTD, a time-adaptive reduced order model (ROM) for\nFEMTD simulations that significantly reduces computational costs while\nmaintaining accuracy. The method alternates between FEMTD and a reduced order\nmodel in time domain (ROMTD), using an error estimator to detect when the ROMTD\nsolution loses accuracy and switching back to FEMTD to update the ROM with new\ndata. Thus, TA-ROMTD does not require prior knowledge of the problem, as the\nROM is constructed on the fly using FEMTD data. A key feature of this approach\nis the use of a coarse time step during FEMTD time intervals, capturing\nessential system dynamics while minimizing computational overhead. By reducing\nthe number of degrees of freedom, this method enables efficient electromagnetic\nsimulations, making it a powerful tool for antenna and microwave circuit\ndesign.\n  The efficiency of the TA-ROMTD strategy is demonstrated through numerical\nexamples, including an antipodal Vivaldi antenna, a dielectric resonator\nantenna, a fully metallic dual-polarization frequency selective surface, and a\nmushroom-type electromagnetic bandgap structure. These cases show the\ncapability of the proposed approach to achieve accurate solutions while\nsignificantly reducing the computation time from tens of hours to minutes.",

To this end, we propose a hierarchical clustered federated learning\nframework, FedHC.

Most studies relate these beneficial effects with\nbiochemical modifications affecting the metabolism and genetical growth factors\nof seeds and young plants. Using barley seeds, in this work we investigate the\nredistribution of ions in the seed surface upon their treatment with cold air\nplasmas. In addition, we investigate the effect of plasma in the lixiviation of\nions through the seeds hull when they are immersed in water. Ions\nre-distribution in the outer layers of air plasma treated seeds has been\nexperimentally determined through X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy analysis in\ncombination with chemical in-depth profiling with gas cluster ion beams. The\nresults show that in the shallowest layers of the seed hull (at least up to a\ndepth of 100 nm) there is an enrichment of K+ and Ca2+ ions, in addition to\nchanges in the O/C and N/C atomic ratios. These data have been confirmed with\nthe electron microscopy/fluorescence analysis of seed cuts. Observations have\nbeen accounted for by a Monte Carlo model simulating the electrostatic\ninteractions that develop between the negative charge accumulated at the seed\nsurface due to the interaction with the plasma sheath and the positive ions\nexisting in the interior of seeds. Furthermore, it is shown that upon water\nimmersion of plasma treated seeds mobilized ions tend to lixiviate more\nefficiently than in pristine seeds. The detection of a significant\nconcentration of NO3- anions in the water has been attributed to a secondary\nreaction of nitrogen species incorporated into the seeds during plasma exposure\nwith reactive oxygen species formed on their surface during this treatment. The\nimplications of these findings for the improvement of germination capacity of\nseeds are discussed.",

Quantifying the\ndependence structure is crucial, as it provides valuable insights into the\nrelationships among components of a random vector. Copula functions effectively\ncapture this dependence structure independent of marginals, making copula-based\ninformation measures highly significant. However, existing copula-based\ninformation measures, such as entropy, divergence, and mutual information, rely\non copula densities, which may not exist in many scenarios, limiting their\napplicability. Recently, to address this issue, Arshad et al. (2024) introduced\ncumulative copula-based measures using Shannon entropy. In this paper, we\nextend this framework by using Tsallis entropy, a non-additive entropy that\nprovides greater flexibility for quantifying uncertainties. We propose\ncumulative copula Tsallis entropy, derive its properties and bounds, and\nillustrate its utility through examples. We further develop a non-parametric\nversion of the measure and validate it using coupled periodic and chaotic maps.\nAdditionally, we extend Kerridge's inaccuracy measure and Kullback-Leibler (KL)\ndivergence to the cumulative copula framework. Using the relationship between\nKL divergence and mutual information, we propose a new cumulative mutual\ninformation (CMI) measure, which outperform the limitations of density-based\nmutual information. Furthermore, we introduce a test procedure for testing the\nmutual independence among random variables using CMI measure. Finally, we\nillustrate the potential of the proposed CMI measure as an economic indicator\nthrough real bivariate financial time series data.",

Existing work addresses this problem by inference-time\ntuning, i.e., modifying the output probabilities from the new foundation model\nwith the outputs from the old foundation model and its fine-tuned model, which\ninvolves an additional overhead in inference by the latter two models. In this\npaper, we propose a new fine-tuning principle, Portable Reward Tuning (PRT),\nthat reduces the inference overhead by its nature, based on the reformulation\nof fine-tuning as the reward maximization. Specifically, instead of fine-tuning\nparameters of the foundation models, PRT trains the reward model explicitly\nthrough the same loss function as in fine-tuning. During inference, the reward\nmodel can be used with any foundation model (with the same set of vocabularies\nor labels) through the formulation of reward maximization. Experimental\nresults, covering both vision and language models, demonstrate that the\nPRT-trained model can achieve comparable accuracy to the existing work of\ninference-time tuning, with less inference cost.",

Despite LLMs becoming increasingly\nmultilingual, the vast majority of research on detecting and quantifying LLM\nhallucination are (a) English-centric and (b) focus on machine translation (MT)\nand summarization, tasks that are less common ``in the wild'' than open\ninformation seeking. In contrast, we aim to quantify the extent of LLM\nhallucination across languages in knowledge-intensive long-form question\nanswering. To this end, we train a multilingual hallucination detection model\nand conduct a large-scale study across 30 languages and 6 open-source LLM\nfamilies. We start from an English hallucination detection dataset and rely on\nMT to generate (noisy) training data in other languages. We also manually\nannotate gold data for five high-resource languages; we then demonstrate, for\nthese languages, that the estimates of hallucination rates are similar between\nsilver (LLM-generated) and gold test sets, validating the use of silver data\nfor estimating hallucination rates for other languages. For the final rates\nestimation, we build a knowledge-intensive QA dataset for 30 languages with\nLLM-generated prompts and Wikipedia articles as references. We find that, while\nLLMs generate longer responses with more hallucinated tokens for\nhigher-resource languages, there is no correlation between length-normalized\nhallucination rates of languages and their digital representation.

However, existing\nframeworks still suffer two practical drawbacks: they must be re-tuned whenever\nthe KG or reasoning task changes, and they depend on a single, high-capacity\nLLM for reliable (i.e., trustworthy) reasoning. To address this, we introduce\nR2-KG, a plug-and-play, dual-agent framework that separates reasoning into two\nroles: an Operator (a low-capacity LLM) that gathers evidence and a Supervisor\n(a high-capacity LLM) that makes final judgments. This design is cost-efficient\nfor LLM inference while still maintaining strong reasoning accuracy.\nAdditionally, R2-KG employs an Abstention mechanism, generating answers only\nwhen sufficient evidence is collected from KG, which significantly enhances\nreliability. Experiments across five diverse benchmarks show that R2-KG\nconsistently outperforms baselines in both accuracy and reliability, regardless\nof the inherent capability of LLMs used as the Operator. Further experiments\nreveal that the single-agent version of R2-KG, equipped with a strict\nself-consistency strategy, achieves significantly higher-than-baseline\nreliability with reduced inference cost but increased abstention rate in\ncomplex KGs. Our findings establish R2-KG as a flexible and cost-effective\nsolution for KG-based reasoning, reducing reliance on high-capacity LLMs while\nensuring trustworthy inference.

Such\nconstraints arise when exploration is carried out by agents whose utility must\nbe taken into account when optimizing overall welfare. A recent work by Bahar\net al. (2020) suggests that recommendations should be \\emph{mechanism-informed\nindividually rational} (MIR). Specifically, if agents have a default arm they\nwould use, relying on the RS should yield each agent at least the reward of the\ndefault arm, conditioned on the information available to the RS. Under the MIR\nconstraint, striking a balance between exploration and exploitation becomes a\ncomplex planning problem. To that end, Bahar et al. propose an approximately\noptimal yet inefficient planning algorithm that runs in $O(2^K K^2 H^2)$, where\n$K$ is the number of arms and $H$ is the size of the support of the reward\ndistributions. In this paper, we make a significant improvement for a special\nyet practical case, removing both the dependence on $H$ and the exponential\ndependence on $K$. We assume a stochastic order of the rewards (e.g., Gaussian\nwith unit variance, Bernoulli, etc.), and devise an asymptotically optimal\nalgorithm with a runtime of $O(K \\log K)$.

    "abstract": "This thesis explores Quantum Field Theory (QFT) on curved spacetimes using a\ngeometric Hamiltonian approach to the Schr\\\"odinger-like representation. In\nparticular it studies the theory of the scalar field described through its\nconfigurations over a Cauchy hypersurface. It is focused on mathematical\nconsistency based on analytic and geometric tools.\n  The mathematical aspects of Gaussian integration theory in\ninfinite-dimensional Topological Vector Spaces (TVS) are thoroughly reviewed.\nIt also reviews the complex and holomorphic versions of important results and\nconcepts of Gaussian integration. For example, the Wiener-It\\^o decomposition\ntheorem or the definition of Hida test functions.\n  The physical framework builds upon three interconnected levels: classical\nGeneral Relativity (GR), Classical Statistical Field Theory (CSFT), and QFT.\nThe work begins by extending the Koopman-van Hove (KvH) formalism of classical\nstatistical mechanics to CSFT. This description is based upon prequantization\ntheory. It reveals features inherent to both CSFT and QFT, that help delineate\nthe genuine quantum features of a theory.\n  Upon the prequantum program, the QFT of the scalar field is built mixing\nGeometric Quantization with the choice of Wick and Weyl orderings. Various\nquantum representations are introduced: the holomorphic, Schr\\\"odinger,\nfield-momentum, and antiholomorphic. The relation among them is studied using\nintegral transforms, including novel infinite-dimensional Fourier transforms.\nFrom a geometrical analysis, it is argued that a covariant time derivative that\nmodifies the evolution equations should be added to the Schr\\\"odinger equation.\nThis connection is unique and required by the geometrodynamical description\nofthe coupling of QFT and GR.\n  Finally, studying the free model on cosmological spacetimes it obtains\nparticle creation effects on a dynamical equation.",

To handle dynamic environments where new\nactivities are continuously introduced, WiFi-based HAR systems must adapt by\nlearning new concepts without forgetting previously learned ones. Furthermore,\nretaining knowledge from old activities by storing historical exemplar is\nimpractical for WiFi-based HAR due to privacy concerns and limited storage\ncapacity of edge devices. In this work, we propose ConSense, a lightweight and\nfast-adapted exemplar-free class incremental learning framework for WiFi-based\nHAR. The framework leverages the transformer architecture and involves dynamic\nmodel expansion and selective retraining to preserve previously learned\nknowledge while integrating new information. Specifically, during incremental\nsessions, small-scale trainable parameters that are trained specifically on the\ndata of each task are added in the multi-head self-attention layer. In\naddition, a selective retraining strategy that dynamically adjusts the weights\nin multilayer perceptron based on the performance stability of neurons across\ntasks is used. Rather than training the entire model, the proposed strategies\nof dynamic model expansion and selective retraining reduce the overall\ncomputational load while balancing stability on previous tasks and plasticity\non new tasks.

    "abstract": "We study the morphology of gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglows viewed off-axis\nusing a simplified analytical model. We consider steep jets, which are expected\nto be the most common type. These jets, characterized by steep lateral\ngradients in energy and Lorentz factor, produce highly beamed emission. The\nobserved signal is dominated by their minimum visible angle at any given time.\nConsequently, the afterglow morphology depends on when this angle begins to\ndecrease, revealing the inner regions of the jet. Depending on whether this\ndecrease occurs before, at, or after the reverse shock crosses the ejecta,\nthree distinct classes of light curves emerge. In the first scenario, the\nde-beamed emission can produce a rapidly rising signal even prior to the\nreverse shock crossing. This is expected in GRBs with long duration, low\nenergy, dense circumburst media, or combinations thereof. In some cases, the\nejecta shell can be considered as effectively thick in the inner regions and\neffectively thin in the outer regions. For forward shocks, the temporal slopes\nin both regimes are identical, which makes it hard to detect the transition.\nReverse shocks, however, have distinct temporal slopes, allowing potential\ndetection of the transition in light curves if their emission surpasses that of\nthe forward shock. The characteristic synchrotron frequency of de-beamed\nemission evolves independently of jet structure for forward shocks but depends\non the lateral energy and Lorentz factor gradients for the reverse shock, with\nslower evolution for steep energy and shallow Lorentz factor gradients.",

Typical\nRAG approaches split the text database into chunks, organizing them in a flat\nstructure for efficient searches. To better capture the inherent dependencies\nand structured relationships across the text database, researchers propose to\norganize textual information into an indexing graph, known asgraph-based RAG.\nHowever, we argue that the limitation of current graph-based RAG methods lies\nin the redundancy of the retrieved information, rather than its insufficiency.\nMoreover, previous methods use a flat structure to organize retrieved\ninformation within the prompts, leading to suboptimal performance. To overcome\nthese limitations, we propose PathRAG, which retrieves key relational paths\nfrom the indexing graph, and converts these paths into textual form for\nprompting LLMs. Specifically, PathRAG effectively reduces redundant information\nwith flow-based pruning, while guiding LLMs to generate more logical and\ncoherent responses with path-based prompting.

In the\n\\textsc{Token Sliding-Connectivity} problem, the input is a graph $G$ and an\ninteger $k$, and the objective is to determine whether the reconfiguration\ngraph $TS_k(G)$ of $G$ is connected. The vertices of $TS_k(G)$ are\n$k$-independent sets of $G$, and two vertices are adjacent if and only if one\ncan transform one of the two corresponding independent sets into the other by\nsliding a vertex (also called a \\emph{token}) along an edge. Bonamy and\nBousquet [WG'17] proved that the \\textsc{Token Sliding-Connectivity} problem is\npolynomial-time solvable on interval graphs but \\NP-hard on split graphs. In\nlight of these two results, the authors asked: can we decide the connectivity\nof $TS_k(G)$ in polynomial time for chordal graphs with \\emph{maximum\nclique-tree degree} $d$? We answer this question in the negative and prove that\nthe problem is \\para-\\NP-hard when parameterized by $d$. More precisely, the\nproblem is \\NP-hard even when $d = 4$. We then study the parameterized\ncomplexity of the problem for a larger parameter called \\emph{leafage} and\nprove that the problem is \\co-\\W[1]-hard. We prove similar results for a\nclosely related problem called \\textsc{Token Sliding-Reachability}. In this\nproblem, the input is a graph $G$ with two of its $k$-independent sets $I$ and\n$J$, and the objective is to determine whether there is a sequence of valid\ntoken sliding moves that transform $I$ into $J$.",

The proposed framework fully exploits\nthe dependence of stereo-vision 3D detection on semantic information in images\nand prioritizes the transmission of this semantic information to reduce total\ntransmission data sizes while ensuring the detection accuracy. Specifically, we\ndevelop an optical flow-driven module to jointly extract and recover semantics\nfrom the left and right images to reduce the loss of the left-right photometric\nalignment semantic information and improve the accuracy of depth inference.\nThen, we design a 2D semantic extraction module to identify and extract\nsemantic meaning around the objects to enhance the transmission of semantic\ninformation in the key areas. Finally, a fusion network is used to fuse the\nrecovered semantics, and reconstruct the stereo-vision images for 3D detection.\nSimulation results show that the proposed method improves the detection\naccuracy by nearly 70% and outperforms the traditional method, especially for\nthe low signal-to-noise ratio regime.",

While the existing MGT detectors achieve strong\nperformance, they remain vulnerable to simple perturbations and adversarial\nattacks. To build an effective defense against malicious perturbations, we view\nMGT detection from a threat modeling perspective, that is, analyzing the\nmodel's vulnerability from an adversary's point of view and exploring effective\nmitigations. To this end, we introduce an adversarial framework for training a\nrobust MGT detector, named GREedy Adversary PromoTed DefendER (GREATER). The\nGREATER consists of two key components: an adversary GREATER-A and a detector\nGREATER-D. The GREATER-D learns to defend against the adversarial attack from\nGREATER-A and generalizes the defense to other attacks. GREATER-A identifies\nand perturbs the critical tokens in embedding space, along with greedy search\nand pruning to generate stealthy and disruptive adversarial examples. Besides,\nwe update the GREATER-A and GREATER-D synchronously, encouraging the GREATER-D\nto generalize its defense to different attacks and varying attack intensities.\nOur experimental results across 10 text perturbation strategies and 6\nadversarial attacks show that our GREATER-D reduces the Attack Success Rate\n(ASR) by 0.67% compared with SOTA defense methods while our GREATER-A is\ndemonstrated to be more effective and efficient than SOTA attack approaches.\nCodes and dataset are available in https://github.com/Liyuuuu111/GREATER.",

Transfer learning can rectify this by transferring knowledge from\nsource to target data, but its effectiveness frequently relies on stringent\nassumptions, such as label shift. In this paper, we introduce a novel General\nConditional Shift (GCS) assumption, which encompasses label shift as a special\nscenario. Under GCS, we demonstrate that both the target distribution and the\nshift function are identifiable. To estimate the conditional probabilities\n${\\bm\\eta}_P$ for source data, we propose leveraging deep neural networks\n(DNNs). Subsequent to transferring the DNN estimator, we estimate the target\nlabel distribution ${\\bm\\pi}_Q$ utilizing a pseudo-maximum likelihood approach.\nUltimately, by incorporating these estimates and circumventing the need to\nestimate the shift function, we construct our proposed Bayes classifier. We\nestablish concentration bounds for our estimators of both ${\\bm\\eta}_P$ and\n${\\bm\\pi}_Q$ in terms of the intrinsic dimension of ${\\bm\\eta}_P$ .

Diffusion Policy, which uses a conditional denoising diffusion process\nto generate actions, has demonstrated superior performance, particularly in\nlearning from multi-modal demonstrates. However, it relies on executing\nmultiple actions predicted from the same inference step to retain performance\nand prevent mode bouncing, which limits its responsiveness, as actions are not\nconditioned on the most recent observations. To address this, we introduce\nResponsive Noise-Relaying Diffusion Policy (RNR-DP), which maintains a\nnoise-relaying buffer with progressively increasing noise levels and employs a\nsequential denoising mechanism that generates immediate, noise-free actions at\nthe head of the sequence, while appending noisy actions at the tail. This\nensures that actions are responsive and conditioned on the latest observations,\nwhile maintaining motion consistency through the noise-relaying buffer. This\ndesign enables the handling of tasks requiring responsive control, and\naccelerates action generation by reusing denoising steps. Experiments on\nresponse-sensitive tasks demonstrate that, compared to Diffusion Policy, ours\nachieves 18% improvement in success rate. Further evaluation on regular tasks\ndemonstrates that RNR-DP also exceeds the best acceleration method (DDIM) by\n6.9% in success rate, highlighting its computational efficiency advantage in\nscenarios where responsiveness is less critical.

    "abstract": "The deposition of nanometer-scale particles is of significant interest in\nvarious industrial processes. While these particles offer several advantages,\ntheir deposition can have detrimental effects, such as reducing the heat\ntransfer efficiency in nanofluid-based battery cooling systems. In this study,\nwe investigated particle deposition around different square substrate\nconfigurations as well as experimentally obtained complex porous structure in a\ntwo-dimensional setup. The particles modeled as a concentration field using the\nlattice Boltzmann method, with a given external flow following a parabolic\nprofile. Our results revealed that particle deposition around a substrate\nincreases with higher fluid velocity, greater particle concentration, and\nhigher deposition probability. Additionally, placing multiple number of\nsubstrates in the channel resulted in increased deposition on upstream\nsubstrates compared to downstream ones. As particle deposition around upstream\nsubstrates increases, it eventually obstructs the flow to downstream regions,\nthereby affecting the overall system performance. The insights gained from this\nsimplified model of particle deposition will play a crucial role in advancing\nour understanding of deposition processes in complex systems.",

It has been used in stationary studies focused on finding patterns\n(e.g. heterogeneity) in transferred charge, but also in dynamic studies aimed\nat understanding how charge escapes. Here, we show that the charge dynamics in\nall but the very best insulators are too fast for patterns found in stationary\nstudies to be meaningful. Using a custom-built system, we are able to quickly\n(~30 s) transfer samples from our contact-charging apparatus to the atomic\nforce microscopy (AFM). For materials at the lower end of `good insulators', we\nsee potential decay that is shorter than the timescale of a typical KPFM scan\n(~10 minutes). We develop a minimal model to explain this decay based on bulk\nconductivity, and show that the measured timescale increases with the\nprediction from this model. To rule out surface conductivity, we perform\nadditional experiments with the macroscopic method of scanning Kelvin probe\nmicroscopy. Our results highlight an important but widely overlooked\nconsideration for dynamic vs. stationary studies in contact-electrified\nsurfaces, and suggest that some patterns observed in the latter, e.g. charge\nheterogeneity, are not as widespread as previously thought.",

Motor\nimagery (MI) decoding has received significant attention due to its intuitive\nmechanism.

To enhance the informativeness of training data, MVCNet\nincorporates a unified augmentation pipeline across time, frequency, and\nspatial domains. Two contrastive modules are further introduced: a cross-view\ncontrastive module that enforces consistency of original and augmented views,\nand a cross-model contrastive module that aligns features extracted from both\nbranches. Final representations are fused and jointly optimized by contrastive\nand classification losses. Experiments on five public MI datasets across three\nscenarios demonstrate that MVCNet consistently outperforms nine\nstate-of-the-art MI decoding networks, highlighting its effectiveness and\ngeneralization ability. MVCNet provides a robust solution for MI decoding by\nintegrating multi-view information and dual-branch modeling, contributing to\nthe development of more reliable BCI systems.",

Unlike traditional quadrotors, the soft drone has pneumatically\nactuated arms, introducing complex, nonlinear interactions between motor thrust\nand arm deformation, which make precise control challenging. The silicone arms\nare actuated using differential pressure to achieve flexibility and thus have a\nvariable workspace compared to their fixed counter-parts. The deflection of the\nsoft arms during compression and expansion is controlled throughout the flight.\nHowever, in real time, the downwash from the motor attached at the tip of the\nsoft arm generates a significant and random disturbance on the arm.

Here, we study the corrections that result from a full quantum\ntreatment of the impurity spin. We find that in the topologically trivial case,\nthe quantum spin behaves similarly to the classical one due to the absence of\nthe Kondo effect for the trivial insulator. In the topological case, the\nquantum spin is significantly less likely to relax: It can be stuck at a\npre-relaxation plateau with a sizable deviation from the expected relaxed\nvalue, and there is a large parameter regime where it does not relax at all but\nfeatures an anomalously large Larmor frequency. Furthermore, we find an\nadditional quantum effect where the pre-relaxation plateau can be\nhyperpolarized, i.e., the spin is stuck at a polarization value larger than the\nground-state expectation value. This is possible due to the (incomplete) Kondo\nscreening of the quantum spin, which is absent in the classical case. Our\nresults are obtained via the ground state density matrix renormalization group\n(DMRG) algorithm and the time-dependent variational principle (TDVP), where the\ncharge-SU(2) symmetry of the problem was exploited. Furthermore, we introduce\nand benchmark a method to predict the dynamics from the given numerical data\nbased on the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy).

In this review, we inspect thoroughly the recent\nliterature, to demonstrate the significant potential that arises from utilizing\n2D layered heterostructures in PEC processes across a broad spectrum of\napplications, from energy conversion and storage to environmental remediation.\nWith the ongoing research and development, it is likely that the potential of\nthese materials will be fully expressed in the near future.",

    "abstract": "Sleep is essential for maintaining human health and quality of life.\nAnalyzing physiological signals during sleep is critical in assessing sleep\nquality and diagnosing sleep disorders. However, manual diagnoses by clinicians\nare time-intensive and subjective. Despite advances in deep learning that have\nenhanced automation, these approaches remain heavily dependent on large-scale\nlabeled datasets. This study introduces SynthSleepNet, a multimodal hybrid\nself-supervised learning framework designed for analyzing polysomnography (PSG)\ndata. SynthSleepNet effectively integrates masked prediction and contrastive\nlearning to leverage complementary features across multiple modalities,\nincluding electroencephalogram (EEG), electrooculography (EOG),\nelectromyography (EMG), and electrocardiogram (ECG). This approach enables the\nmodel to learn highly expressive representations of PSG data. Furthermore, a\ntemporal context module based on Mamba was developed to efficiently capture\ncontextual information across signals. SynthSleepNet achieved superior\nperformance compared to state-of-the-art methods across three downstream tasks:\nsleep-stage classification, apnea detection, and hypopnea detection, with\naccuracies of 89.89%, 99.75%, and 89.60%, respectively. The model demonstrated\nrobust performance in a semi-supervised learning environment with limited\nlabels, achieving accuracies of 87.98%, 99.37%, and 77.52% in the same tasks.\nThese results underscore the potential of the model as a foundational tool for\nthe comprehensive analysis of PSG data. SynthSleepNet demonstrates\ncomprehensively superior performance across multiple downstream tasks compared\nto other methodologies, making it expected to set a new standard for sleep\ndisorder monitoring and diagnostic systems.",

External validation\ndemonstrates its robust generation performance, ensuring fairness across\nunderrepresented groups.

This article discusses the\nevolution nanoparticle under the combined effect of advection, diffusion and\ncoagulation. Under the influence of vortices or large-scale coherent\nstructures, the spatial distribution of particle moments is similar to the\nstructure of the flow field.

Given the fact that the number of elements per surface of the SIM is\nmuch larger than the base station (BS) antennas, the acquisition of the channel\nstate information (CSI) in SIM-aided multi-user systems is challenging,\nespecially when a line-of-sight (LoS) component is present.

Dense T2I (DT2I) and spherical T2I (ST2I) models address\nthese issues, but so far no unified approach exists. Trivial approaches, like\nprompting a DT2I model to generate panoramas can not generate proper spherical\ndistortions and seamless transitions at the borders. Our work shows that\nspherical dense text-to-image (SDT2I) can be achieved by integrating\ntraining-free DT2I approaches into finetuned panorama models. Specifically, we\npropose MultiStitchDiffusion (MSTD) and MultiPanFusion (MPF) by integrating\nMultiDiffusion into StitchDiffusion and PanFusion, respectively. Since no\nbenchmark for SDT2I exists, we further construct Dense-Synthetic-View\n(DSynView), a new synthetic dataset containing spherical layouts to evaluate\nour models. Our results show that MSTD outperforms MPF across image quality as\nwell as prompt- and layout adherence. MultiPanFusion generates more diverse\nimages but struggles to synthesize flawless foreground objects. We propose\nbootstrap-coupling and turning off equirectangular perspective-projection\nattention in the foreground as an improvement of MPF.

A promising route to simplifying TinyML is through\nautomatic machine learning (AutoML), which can distill elaborate optimization\nworkflows into accessible key decisions. Notably, Hardware Aware Neural\nArchitecture Searches - where a computer searches for an optimal TinyML model\nbased on predictive performance and hardware metrics - have gained significant\ntraction, producing some of today's most widely used TinyML models.\nNevertheless, limiting optimization solely to neural network architectures can\nprove insufficient. Because TinyML systems must operate under extremely tight\nresource constraints, the choice of input data configuration, such as\nresolution or sampling rate, also profoundly impacts overall system efficiency.\nAchieving truly optimal TinyML systems thus requires jointly tuning both input\ndata and model architecture.

Given a\ngraph $G=(V,E)$, a list assignment $L:E\\to 2^C$ and some level of majority\ntolerance $\\alpha\\in(0,1)$, an $\\alpha$-majority $L$-colouring of $G$ is a\ncolouring $\\omega:E\\to C$ from the given lists such that for every $v\\in V$ and\neach $c\\in C$, the number of edges coloured $c$ which are incident with $v$\ndoes not exceed $\\alpha\\cdot d(v)$. We present a simple argument implying that\nfor every integer $k\\geq 2$, each graph with minimum degree $\\delta\\geq\n2k^2-2k$ admits a $1/k$-majority $L$-colouring from any assignment of lists of\nsize $k+1$. This almost matches the best result in a non-list setting and\nsolves a conjecture posed for the basic majority edge colourings, i.e. for\n$k=2$, from lists. We further discuss restrictions which permit obtaining\ncorresponding results in a more general setting, i.e. for diversified\n$\\alpha=\\alpha(c)$ majority tolerances for distinct colours $c\\in C$.

This study addresses this gap by examining the degree of\nagreement between human and AI-generated responses in defining three types of\nGreek neologisms: blends, compounds, and derivatives. The study employed an\nonline experiment in which human participants selected the most appropriate\ndefinitions for neologisms, while ChatGPT received identical prompts. The\nresults revealed fair agreement between human and AI responses for blends and\nderivatives but no agreement for compounds. However, when considering the\nmajority response among humans, agreement with AI was high for blends and\nderivatives.

    "abstract": "A piping and instrumentation diagram (P&ID) is a central reference document\nin chemical process engineering. Currently, chemical engineers manually review\nP&IDs through visual inspection to find and rectify errors. However,\nengineering projects can involve hundreds to thousands of P&ID pages, creating\na significant revision workload. This study proposes a rule-based method to\nsupport engineers with error detection and correction in P&IDs. The method is\nbased on a graph representation of P&IDs, enabling automated error detection\nand correction, i.e., autocorrection, through rule graphs. We use our pyDEXPI\nPython package to generate P&ID graphs from DEXPI-standard P&IDs. In this\nstudy, we developed 33 rules based on chemical engineering knowledge and\nheuristics, with five selected rules demonstrated as examples. A case study on\nan illustrative P&ID validates the reliability and effectiveness of the\nrule-based autocorrection method in revising P&IDs.",

    "abstract": "Transformers have achieved great success in effectively processing sequential\ndata such as text. Their architecture consisting of several attention and\nfeedforward blocks can model relations between elements of a sequence in\nparallel manner, which makes them very efficient to train and effective in\nsequence modeling. Even though they have shown strong performance in processing\nsequential data, the size of their parameters is considerably larger when\ncompared to other architectures such as RNN and CNN based models. Therefore,\nseveral approaches have explored parameter sharing and recurrence in\nTransformer models to address their computational demands. However, such\nmethods struggle to maintain high performance compared to the original\ntransformer model. To address this challenge, we propose our novel approach,\nRingFormer, which employs one Transformer layer that processes input repeatedly\nin a circular, ring-like manner, while utilizing low-rank matrices to generate\ninput-dependent level signals. This allows us to reduce the model parameters\nsubstantially while maintaining high performance in a variety of tasks such as\ntranslation and image classification, as validated in the experiments.",

While prevalent\nmethods like DPO have demonstrated strong performance, they frame interactions\nwith the language model as a bandit problem, which limits their applicability\nin real-world scenarios where multi-turn conversations are common.\nAdditionally, DPO relies on the Bradley-Terry model assumption, which does not\nadequately capture the non-transitive nature of human preferences. In this\npaper, we address these challenges by modeling the alignment problem as a\ntwo-player constant-sum Markov game, where each player seeks to maximize their\nwinning rate against the other across all steps of the conversation. Our\napproach Optimistic Multi-step Preference Optimization (OMPO) is built upon the\noptimistic online mirror descent\nalgorithm~\\citep{rakhlin2013online,joulani17a}.

However, a\nsignificant performance gap still exists between SNN-based ViTs and their ANN\ncounterparts. Here, we first analyze why SNN-based ViTs suffer from limited\nperformance and identify a mismatch between the vanilla self-attention\nmechanism and spatio-temporal spike trains. This mismatch results in degraded\nspatial relevance and limited temporal interactions. To address these issues,\nwe draw inspiration from biological saccadic attention mechanisms and introduce\nan innovative Saccadic Spike Self-Attention (SSSA) method. Specifically, in the\nspatial domain, SSSA employs a novel spike distribution-based method to\neffectively assess the relevance between Query and Key pairs in SNN-based ViTs.\nTemporally, SSSA employs a saccadic interaction module that dynamically focuses\non selected visual areas at each timestep and significantly enhances whole\nscene understanding through temporal interactions. Building on the SSSA\nmechanism, we develop a SNN-based Vision Transformer (SNN-ViT). Extensive\nexperiments across various visual tasks demonstrate that SNN-ViT achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance with linear computational complexity. The\neffectiveness and efficiency of the SNN-ViT highlight its potential for\npower-critical edge vision applications.",

Although impressive results\nhave been achieved in controlled real-world scenarios, these methods often\nstruggle with compliance and adaptability when encountering environments or\ndisturbances unseen during training, potentially resulting in extreme or unsafe\nbehaviors. Inspired by how animals achieve smooth and adaptive movements by\ncontrolling muscle extension and contraction, torque-based policies offer a\npromising alternative by enabling precise and direct control of the actuators\nin torque space. In principle, this approach facilitates more effective\ninteractions with the environment, resulting in safer and more adaptable\nbehaviors. However, challenges such as a highly nonlinear state space and\ninefficient exploration during training have hindered their broader adoption.\nTo address these limitations, we propose SATA, a bio-inspired framework that\nmimics key biomechanical principles and adaptive learning mechanisms observed\nin animal locomotion. Our approach effectively addresses the inherent\nchallenges of learning torque-based policies by significantly improving\nearly-stage exploration, leading to high-performance final policies.\nRemarkably, our method achieves zero-shot sim-to-real transfer. Our\nexperimental results indicate that SATA demonstrates remarkable compliance and\nsafety, even in challenging environments such as soft/slippery terrain or\nnarrow passages, and under significant external disturbances, highlighting its\npotential for practical deployments in human-centric and safety-critical\nscenarios.",

    "abstract": "Fine-tuning speech representation models can enhance performance on specific\ntasks but often compromises their cross-task generalization ability. This\ndegradation is often caused by excessive changes in the representations, making\nit difficult to retain information learned during pre-training. Existing\napproaches, such as regularizing weight changes during fine-tuning, may fail to\nmaintain sufficiently high feature similarity with the pre-trained model, and\nthus could possibly lose cross-task generalization. To address this issue, we\npropose Speech-FT, a novel two-stage fine-tuning framework designed to maintain\ncross-task generalization while benefiting from fine-tuning. Speech-FT first\napplies fine-tuning specifically designed to reduce representational drift,\nfollowed by weight-space interpolation with the pre-trained model to restore\ncross-task generalization. Extensive experiments on HuBERT, wav2vec 2.0, DeCoAR\n2.0, and WavLM Base+ demonstrate that Speech-FT consistently improves\nperformance across a wide range of supervised, unsupervised, and multitask\nfine-tuning scenarios. Moreover, Speech-FT achieves superior cross-task\ngeneralization compared to fine-tuning baselines that explicitly constrain\nweight changes, such as weight-space regularization and LoRA fine-tuning. Our\nanalysis reveals that Speech-FT maintains higher feature similarity to the\npre-trained model compared to alternative strategies, despite allowing larger\nweight-space updates. Notably, Speech-FT achieves significant improvements on\nthe SUPERB benchmark. For example, when fine-tuning HuBERT on automatic speech\nrecognition, Speech-FT is able to reduce phone error rate from 5.17% to 3.94%,\nlower word error rate from 6.38% to 5.75%, and increase speaker identification\naccuracy from 81.86% to 84.11%.

Second, we create two complementary datasets: Perovskite-Chat,\ncomprising 55,101 high-quality question-answer pairs generated through a novel\nmulti-agent framework, and Perovskite-Reasoning, containing 2,217 carefully\ncurated materials science problems. Third, we introduce two specialized large\nlanguage models: Perovskite-Chat-LLM for domain-specific knowledge assistance\nand Perovskite-Reasoning-LLM for scientific reasoning tasks. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that our system significantly outperforms existing models\nin both domain-specific knowledge retrieval and scientific reasoning tasks,\nproviding researchers with effective tools for literature review, experimental\ndesign, and complex problem-solving in PSC research.",

    "abstract": "Best-of-N (BoN) sampling with a reward model has been shown to be an\neffective strategy for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human\npreferences at the time of decoding. BoN sampling is susceptible to a problem\nknown as reward hacking. Since the reward model is an imperfect proxy for the\ntrue objective, an excessive focus on optimizing its value can lead to a\ncompromise of its performance on the true objective. Previous work proposes\nRegularized BoN sampling (RBoN), a BoN sampling with regularization to the\nobjective, and shows that it outperforms BoN sampling so that it mitigates\nreward hacking and empirically (Jinnai et al., 2024). However, Jinnai et al.\n(2024) introduce RBoN based on a heuristic and they lack the analysis of why\nsuch regularization strategy improves the performance of BoN sampling. The aim\nof this study is to analyze the effect of BoN sampling on regularization\nstrategies. Using the regularization strategies corresponds to robust\noptimization, which maximizes the worst case over a set of possible\nperturbations in the proxy reward. Although the theoretical guarantees are not\ndirectly applicable to RBoN, RBoN corresponds to a practical implementation.\nThis paper proposes an extension of the RBoN framework, called Stochastic RBoN\nsampling (SRBoN), which is a theoretically guaranteed approach to worst-case\nRBoN in proxy reward. We then perform an empirical evaluation using the\nAlpacaFarm and Anthropic's hh-rlhf datasets to evaluate which factors of the\nregularization strategies contribute to the improvement of the true proxy\nreward. In addition, we also propose another simple RBoN method, the Sentence\nLength Regularized BoN, which has a better performance in the experiment as\ncompared to the previous methods.",

This parametrization, called transitional dark energy, allows for\nrapid changes in the equation of state but also changes like that in the\nChevallier-Polarski-Linder parametrization. We find a 3.8{\\sigma} preference\nfor evolving dark energy over {\\Lambda}CDM with the DES dataset and a weaker\n2.4{\\sigma} preference when using the PP dataset. This corroborates the finding\nof the DESI Collaboration, who found that their baryon acoustic oscillation\ndata preferred evolving dark energy when fit with the CPL parametrization of\nthe equation of state. Our analysis reveals no significant outliers in the DESI\ndata around the TDE best-fit, while the data is asymmetrically distributed\naround the {\\Lambda}CDM best-fit model such that the measured distances are on\naverage smaller. The DESI and SN data both prefer an expansion history that\nimplies a higher dark energy density around z=0.5 than in the\nPlanck-{\\Lambda}CDM model, with the inferred equation of state being greater\nthan -1 around z=0 and close to or below -1 at z>0.5. We show that when the\nexpansion rate is greater than that in the Planck-{\\Lambda}CDM model (around\nz=0.5), the growth rate calculated assuming General Relativity is suppressed\nrelative to the Planck-{\\Lambda}CDM model, and it rebounds as the expansion\nrate differences between the models become smaller closer to the present time.\nThe resulting flattening of the $f\\sigma_8(z)$ curve compared to the\n{\\Lambda}CDM model could be an independent signature of the temporal evolution\nof dark energy.",

Retrieval-based KV cache reduction methods can mitigate these\nchallenges, typically by offloading the complete KV cache to CPU and retrieving\nnecessary tokens on demand during inference. However, these methods still\nsuffer from unsatisfactory accuracy degradation and extra retrieval overhead.\nTo address these limitations, this paper proposes A$^2$ATS, a novel\nretrieval-based KV cache reduction method. A$^2$ATS aims to obtain an accurate\napproximation of attention scores by applying the vector quantization technique\nto key states, thereby enabling efficient and precise retrieval of the top-K\ntokens. First, we propose Windowed Rotary Position Embedding, which decouples\nthe positional dependency from query and key states after position embedding.\nThen, we propose query-aware vector quantization that optimizes the objective\nof attention score approximation directly. Finally, we design the heterogeneous\ninference architecture for KV cache offloading, enabling long context serving\nwith larger batch sizes. Experimental results demonstrate that A$^2$ATS can\nachieve a lower performance degradation with similar or lower overhead compared\nto existing methods, thereby increasing long context serving throughput by up\nto $2.7 \\times$.",

Especially on the source\nside, the side channels created by active modulation may compromise the\nsecurity of the protocol. We proposes a passively-sourced quantum secure direct\ncommunication (QSDC) protocol based on fully passive source. By passively\nmodulating both the quantum state and the intensity of the decoy state, we can\navoid active modulation operations at the source, thereby enhancing the\nrobustness of QSDC against side-channel attacks. We developed a system model\nand conducted parameter optimization to obtain the maximum secrecy message\ntransmission rate achievable by the protocol for each channel attenuation. At a\nchannel attenuation of 2, 4, 6 dB (corresponding to a communication distance of\n5, 10, 15 km), the secrecy message transmission rates are 5.76 * 10^-5, 9.92 *\n10^-6, and 4.99 * 10^-7 bit/sec.

The decoy state generation and encoding operation can be carried out\npassively by parameter down-conversion progress. This protocol has several\nadvantages.

Second, compared with fully passive QKD protocol with\nphase-randomized coherent pulses, our protocol can significantly increase the\nkey rate and extend the communication distance. Meanwhile, in terms of the\ntransmission rate, our protocol is also closer to that of actively modulated\nQKD and can achieve fully passive modulation with fewer resources.

Our analysis shows that\nPRAC's system performance overhead on benign applications is non-negligible for\nmodern DRAM chips and prohibitively large for future DRAM chips that are more\nvulnerable to read disturbance. We identify two weaknesses of PRAC that cause\nthese overheads. First, PRAC increases critical DRAM access latency parameters\ndue to the additional time required to increment activation counters. Second,\nPRAC performs a constant number of preventive refreshes at a time, making it\nvulnerable to an adversarial access pattern, known as the wave attack, and\nconsequently requiring it to be configured for significantly smaller activation\nthresholds. To address PRAC's two weaknesses, we propose a new on-DRAM-die\nRowHammer mitigation mechanism, Chronus. Chronus 1) updates row activation\ncounters concurrently while serving accesses by separating counters from the\ndata and 2) prevents the wave attack by dynamically controlling the number of\npreventive refreshes performed. Our performance analysis shows that Chronus's\nsystem performance overhead is near-zero for modern DRAM chips and very low for\nfuture DRAM chips. Chronus outperforms three variants of PRAC and three other\nstate-of-the-art read disturbance solutions. We discuss Chronus's and PRAC's\nimplications for future systems and foreshadow future research directions.

When the spectra are modeled with a power-law,\nsignificant residuals arise below 2 keV and in the energy range of 30-78 keV in\nNuSTAR data. Residuals in the lower energy band represent soft X-ray excess\nwhile at higher energies it likely represents Compton reflection hump which\nmight be a weak component arising from dense and cold material. The presence of\na faint iron line is present in XMM-Newton observations. We interpret such\nfeatures as attributed to the coronal emission plus those arising from\nreflection from an accretion disk. We model the SEDs with the single zone\ninverse Compton jet model based on Synchrotron Self Compton and External\nCompton phenomena. It is found that a one-zone synchrotron plus IC model\nexplains quite well the SEDs but the jet component alone fails to fit the\nmultiband X-ray emission for the low state of this object in 2018 and 2019\nwhich arises due to spectral flattening at low energy X-rays, indicating that\nan additional Seyfert-like thermal component must be present at X-rays. This is\nfurther supported by a big blue bump present in the optical/ultraviolet band in\nall SEDs.

This issue, known as the Multi-Face Janus\nproblem, arises because existing methods struggle to maintain consistency\nacross varying poses and are biased toward a canonical pose. While recent work\nhas improved pose control and approximation, these efforts are still limited by\nthis inherent bias, which skews the guidance during generation. To address\nthis, we propose a solution called RecDreamer, which reshapes the underlying\ndata distribution to achieve a more consistent pose representation. The core\nidea behind our method is to rectify the prior distribution, ensuring that pose\nvariation is uniformly distributed rather than biased toward a canonical form.\nBy modifying the prescribed distribution through an auxiliary function, we can\nreconstruct the density of the distribution to ensure compliance with specific\nmarginal constraints. In particular, we ensure that the marginal distribution\nof poses follows a uniform distribution, thereby eliminating the biases\nintroduced by the prior knowledge. We incorporate this rectified data\ndistribution into existing score distillation algorithms, a process we refer to\nas uniform score distillation. To efficiently compute the posterior\ndistribution required for the auxiliary function, RecDreamer introduces a\ntraining-free classifier that estimates pose categories in a plug-and-play\nmanner. Additionally, we utilize various approximation techniques for noisy\nstates, significantly improving system performance. Our experimental results\ndemonstrate that RecDreamer effectively mitigates the Multi-Face Janus problem,\nleading to more consistent 3D asset generation across different poses.",

    "abstract": "3D molecule generation is crucial for drug discovery and material design.\nWhile prior efforts focus on 3D diffusion models for their benefits in modeling\ncontinuous 3D conformers, they overlook the advantages of 1D SELFIES-based\nLanguage Models (LMs), which can generate 100% valid molecules and leverage the\nbillion-scale 1D molecule datasets. To combine these advantages for 3D molecule\ngeneration, we propose a foundation model -- NExT-Mol: 3D Diffusion Meets 1D\nLanguage Modeling for 3D Molecule Generation. NExT-Mol uses an extensively\npretrained molecule LM for 1D molecule generation, and subsequently predicts\nthe generated molecule's 3D conformers with a 3D diffusion model. We enhance\nNExT-Mol's performance by scaling up the LM's model size, refining the\ndiffusion neural architecture, and applying 1D to 3D transfer learning.\nNotably, our 1D molecule LM significantly outperforms baselines in\ndistributional similarity while ensuring validity, and our 3D diffusion model\nachieves leading performances in conformer prediction. Given these improvements\nin 1D and 3D modeling, NExT-Mol achieves a 26% relative improvement in 3D FCD\nfor de novo 3D generation on GEOM-DRUGS, and a 13% average relative gain for\nconditional 3D generation on QM9-2014.

Here, we introduce a non-invasive method to decode\nthe production of sentences from brain activity and demonstrate its efficacy in\na cohort of 35 healthy volunteers. For this, we present Brain2Qwerty, a new\ndeep learning architecture trained to decode sentences from either electro-\n(EEG) or magneto-encephalography (MEG), while participants typed briefly\nmemorized sentences on a QWERTY keyboard. With MEG, Brain2Qwerty reaches, on\naverage, a character-error-rate (CER) of 32% and substantially outperforms EEG\n(CER: 67%). For the best participants, the model achieves a CER of 19%, and can\nperfectly decode a variety of sentences outside of the training set. While\nerror analyses suggest that decoding depends on motor processes, the analysis\nof typographical errors suggests that it also involves higher-level cognitive\nfactors.

We obtain fairly good phase purity,\nhomogeneous microstructure and good matrix stoichiometry.

Calculations of formation energy of defects and electronic\nproperties carried out in the density functional theory formalism reveal that\ncharged iron vacancies VFe2- are the dominant defects responsible for the\nintrinsic p-type doping of Fe2TiSn in all types of growing conditions except\nFe-rich. Additionally, Sb substitutions at Sn site give rise either to SbSn,\nSbSn1+ which are responsible for n-type doping and magnetism (SbSn) or to\nmagnetic SbSn1- which act as additional p-type dopants.

    "abstract": "Lifelong sequential modeling (LSM) is becoming increasingly critical in\nsocial media recommendation systems for predicting the click-through rate (CTR)\nof items presented to users. Central to this process is the attention\nmechanism, which extracts interest representations with respect to candidate\nitems from the user sequence. Typically, attention mechanisms operate in a\npoint-wise manner, focusing solely on the relevance of individual items in the\nsequence to the candidate item. In contrast, context-aware LSM aims to also\nconsider adjacent items in the user behavior sequence to better assess the\nimportance of each item. In this paper, we propose the Context-Aware Interest\nNetwork (CAIN), which utilizes the Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) to\ncreate context-aware representations for each item throughout the lifelong\nsequence. These enhanced representations are then used in the attention\nmechanism instead of the original item representations to derive context-aware\ninterest representations. Building upon this TCN framework, we propose the\nMulti-Scope Interest Aggregator (MSIA) module, which incorporates multiple TCN\nlayers and their corresponding attention modules to capture interest\nrepresentations across varying context scopes. Furthermore, we introduce the\nPersonalized Extractor Generation (PEG) module, which generates convolution\nfilters based on users' basic profile features. These personalized filters are\nthen used in the TCN layers instead of the original global filters to generate\nmore user-specific representations.

Drawing inspiration from autonomous\ndriving, we introduce a novel framework that categorizes RS autonomy into five\ndistinct levels, ranging from basic rule-based accuracy-driven systems to\nbehavior-aware, uncertain multi-objective RSs - where users may have varying\nneeds, such as accuracy, diversity, and fairness.

In ISAC systems, a variety of machine\nlearning models are trained to analyze and identify signal patterns, thereby\nensuring reliable sensing and communications. However, considering factors such\nas communication rates, costs, and privacy, collecting sufficient training data\nfrom various ISAC scenarios for these models is impractical.

Building on this, the scheme further utilizes another diffusion model\nto enhance the sample quality, thereby facilitating the data augmentation in\nscenarios where the original sensing data is insufficient and unevenly\ndistributed.

The kinematics of the\nresonant trident pair production process are studied in detail.

To explore\nthe real limit of PTQ, we propose an extremely low-bit PTQ method called\nPTQ1.61, which enables weight quantization to 1.61-bit for the first time.\nSpecifically, we first introduce a one-dimensional structured mask with\nnegligibly additional 0.0002-bit per weight based on input activations from the\nperspective of reducing the upper bound of quantization error to allocate\ncorresponding salient weight channels to 4-bit.

The challenge is to schedule the\narriving aircraft in a sequence so that the cost and delays are optimized.\nThere are various solution approaches to solving this problem, most of which\nare based on operations research algorithms and meta-heuristics. Although\ntraditional methods perform better on one or the other factors, there remains a\nproblem of solving real-time rescheduling and computational scalability\naltogether. This paper presents a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL)\nframework that combines graph neural networks with actor-critic architectures\nto address the ALP.

Following Hofstadter, a family $(F_k)$ of similar functions\nis obtained by varying the number $k$ of nested recursive calls in this\nequation. We study here some Fibonacci-like sequences that are deeply connected\nwith these functions $F_k$. In particular, the Zeckendorf theorem can be\nadapted to provide digital expansions via sums of terms of these sequences. On\nthese digital expansions, the functions $F_k$ are acting as right shifts of the\ndigits. These Fibonacci-like sequences can be expressed in terms of zeros of\nthe polynomial $X^k{-}X^{k-1}{-}1$. Considering now the discrepancy of each\nfunction $F_k$, i.e., the maximal distance between $F_k$ and its linear\nequivalent, we retrieve the fact that this discrepancy is finite exactly when\n$k \\le 4$. Thanks to that, we solve two twenty-year-old OEIS conjectures\nstating how close the functions $F_3$ and $F_4$ are from the integer parts of\ntheir linear equivalents. Moreover we establish that $F_k$ can coincide exactly\nwith such an integer part only when $k\\le 2$, while $F_k$ is almost additive\nexactly when $k \\le 4$. Finally, a nice fractal shape a la Rauzy has been\nencountered when investigating the discrepancy of $F_3$. Almost all this\narticle has been formalized and verified in the Coq/Rocq proof assistant.",

    "abstract": "Universal Information Extraction (UIE) has garnered significant attention due\nto its ability to address model explosion problems effectively. Extractive UIE\ncan achieve strong performance using a relatively small model, making it widely\nadopted. Extractive UIEs generally rely on task instructions for different\ntasks, including single-target instructions and multiple-target instructions.\nSingle-target instruction UIE enables the extraction of only one type of\nrelation at a time, limiting its ability to model correlations between\nrelations and thus restricting its capability to extract complex relations.\nWhile multiple-target instruction UIE allows for the extraction of multiple\nrelations simultaneously, the inclusion of irrelevant relations introduces\ndecision complexity and impacts extraction accuracy. Therefore, for\nmulti-relation extraction, we propose LDNet, which incorporates multi-aspect\nrelation modeling and a label drop mechanism. By assigning different relations\nto different levels for understanding and decision-making, we reduce decision\nconfusion. Additionally, the label drop mechanism effectively mitigates the\nimpact of irrelevant relations. Experiments show that LDNet outperforms or\nachieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art systems on 9 tasks, 33\ndatasets, in both single-modal and multi-modal, few-shot and zero-shot\nsettings.\\footnote{https://github.com/Lu-Yang666/LDNet}",

Hightemperature Raman\nspectroscopy and high-temperature X-ray diffraction analyses were carried out\nup to 1050 C on a 5 um coating deposited by the pulsed laser deposition (PLD)\ntechnique on a 316L steel substrate. The experiments involved the in-situ\nexamination of structural changes in the material under increasing temperature,\nalong with ex-situ Raman imaging of the surface and cross-section of the\ncoating after thermal treatments of different lengths. As it was expected, the\npresence of alpha-alumina was detected with the addition of other polymorphs,\ngamma- and theta-Al2O3, found in the material after longer high-temperature\nexposure. The use of two structural analysis methods and two lasers excitation\nwavelengths with Raman spectroscopy allowed us to detect all the mentioned\nphases despite different mode activity. Alumina analysis was based on the\nemission spectra, while substrate oxidation products were identified through\nthe structural bands. The experiments depicted a dependence of the phase\ncomposition of oxidation products and alumina's degree of crystallization on\nthe length of the treatment. Nevertheless, the observed structural changes did\nnot occur rapidly, and the coating's integrity remained intact. Moreover,\noxidation signs occurred locally at temperatures exceeding the LFR reactor's\nworking temperature, confirming the material's great potential as a protective\ncoating in the operational conditions of LFR nuclear reactors.",

Although some recent\nmethods solve this problem by controlling the updates of latent states, they\ncannot disentangle the long/short-term states, leading to the inability to\neffectively adapt to nonstationary. To tackle this challenge, we propose a\ngeneral framework to disentangle long/short-term states for online time series\nforecasting. Our idea is inspired by the observations where short-term changes\ncan be led by unknown interventions like abrupt policies in the stock market.\nBased on this insight, we formalize a data generation process with unknown\ninterventions on short-term states. Under mild assumptions, we further leverage\nthe independence of short-term states led by unknown interventions to establish\nthe identification theory to achieve the disentanglement of long/short-term\nstates. Built on this theory, we develop a long short-term disentanglement\nmodel (LSTD) to extract the long/short-term states with long/short-term\nencoders, respectively. Furthermore, the LSTD model incorporates a smooth\nconstraint to preserve the long-term dependencies and an interrupted dependency\nconstraint to enforce the forgetting of short-term dependencies, together\nboosting the disentanglement of long/short-term states. Experimental results on\nseveral benchmark datasets show that our \\textbf{LSTD} model outperforms\nexisting methods for online time series forecasting, validating its efficacy in\nreal-world applications.",

To validate\nthis, we developed a nonparametric method for generating continuous handover\nmotion, conditioned on the receiver's movements, and trained the model using a\ndataset of 1,000 human-to-human handover demonstrations.

    "abstract": "Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) demonstrates the advantage of aligning a\nlarge language model with human preference using only an offline dataset.\nHowever, DPO has the limitation that the KL penalty, which prevents excessive\ndeviation from the reference model, is static throughout the training process.\nSeveral methods claim to change this static KL penalty of DPO into a dynamic\none, but no approach can adaptively assign different KL penalties for each\npreference pair. In this paper, we propose $\\varepsilon$-Direct Preference\nOptimization ($\\varepsilon$-DPO), which allows adaptive control of the KL\npenalty strength $\\beta$ for each preference pair. Specifically,\n$\\varepsilon$-DPO adaptively controls $\\beta$ for each preference pair based on\nthe monotonicity of logits as a preference model under the perturbation of\n$\\beta$ during training. This is equivalent to adjusting the KL penalty by\nchecking whether the change in training-time temperature can lead to better\npreference confidence as preference models by simply reusing the logit of the\ncurrent policy and the reference policy. Experimental results show that the\nsimple criterion of $\\varepsilon$-DPO for KL penalty relaxation significantly\nimproves DPO compared to most existing direct alignment algorithms on general\nchatbot benchmarks and reveal that this KL penalty control criterion can\nreflect confusion as a preference model and provide an efficient KL trade-off,\nhighlighting the significance of instance-level adaptive KL penalty control in\nDPO.",

To provide\npersonalized and interpretable explanations, existing works often combine the\ngeneration capabilities of large language models (LLMs) with collaborative\nfiltering (CF) information. CF information extracted from the user-item\ninteraction graph captures the user behaviors and preferences, which is crucial\nfor providing informative explanations. However, due to the complexity of graph\nstructure, effectively extracting the CF information from graphs still remains\na challenge. Moreover, existing methods often struggle with the integration of\nextracted CF information with LLMs due to its implicit representation and the\nmodality gap between graph structures and natural language explanations. To\naddress these challenges, we propose G-Refer, a framework using graph\nretrieval-augmented large language models (LLMs) for explainable\nrecommendation. Specifically, we first employ a hybrid graph retrieval\nmechanism to retrieve explicit CF signals from both structural and semantic\nperspectives. The retrieved CF information is explicitly formulated as\nhuman-understandable text by the proposed graph translation and accounts for\nthe explanations generated by LLMs. To bridge the modality gap, we introduce\nknowledge pruning and retrieval-augmented fine-tuning to enhance the ability of\nLLMs to process and utilize the retrieved CF information to generate\nexplanations. Extensive experiments show that G-Refer achieves superior\nperformance compared with existing methods in both explainability and\nstability.

    "abstract": "Accurately locating key moments within long videos is crucial for solving\nlong video understanding (LVU) tasks. However, existing benchmarks are either\nseverely limited in terms of video length and task diversity, or they focus\nsolely on the end-to-end LVU performance, making them inappropriate for\nevaluating whether key moments can be accurately accessed. To address this\nchallenge, we propose MomentSeeker, a novel benchmark for long-video moment\nretrieval (LMVR), distinguished by the following features. First, it is created\nbased on long and diverse videos, averaging over 1200 seconds in duration and\ncollected from various domains, e.g., movie, anomaly, egocentric, and sports.\nSecond, it covers a variety of real-world scenarios in three levels:\nglobal-level, event-level, object-level, covering common tasks like action\nrecognition, object localization, and causal reasoning, etc. Third, it\nincorporates rich forms of queries, including text-only queries,\nimage-conditioned queries, and video-conditioned queries. On top of\nMomentSeeker, we conduct comprehensive experiments for both generation-based\napproaches (directly using MLLMs) and retrieval-based approaches (leveraging\nvideo retrievers). Our results reveal the significant challenges in long-video\nmoment retrieval in terms of accuracy and efficiency, despite improvements from\nthe latest long-video MLLMs and task-specific fine-tuning. We have publicly\nreleased MomentSeeker(https://yhy-2000.github.io/MomentSeeker/) to facilitate\nfuture research in this area.",

We model the dynamics of VCs by considering\nmultiple factors, including varying communication quality among vehicles,\nfluctuating computing capabilities of vehicles, uncertain contact duration\namong vehicles, and dynamic data exchange costs between vehicles. Our primary\ngoal is to obtain feasible assignments between task components and nearby\nvehicles, called templates, in a timely manner with minimized task completion\ntime and data exchange overhead.

    "abstract": "We analytically derive self-similar solutions for a time-dependent,\none-dimensional, magnetically driven accretion-disk-wind model based on the\nmagnetohydrodynamic equations. The model assumes a geometrically thin,\ngas-pressure-dominated accretion disk and incorporates both magnetic braking\nand turbulent viscosity through an extended $\\alpha$-viscosity prescription in\nthe vertical and radial directions, respectively. The $\\alpha$ parameter for\nthe vertical stress is assumed to vary with the disk aspect ratio. We confirm\nthat in the absence of a wind, our self-similar solutions agree with the\nclassical solution of Cannizzo et al. (1990), in which the mass accretion rate\nfollows a power-law decay with time as $t^{-19/16}$. This scaling has been\nwidely used as a key indicator of the mass accretion rate in tidal disruption\nevent (TDE) disks. In contrast, when a wind is present, both the mass accretion\nand mass loss rates decay more steeply than $t^{-19/16}$. Furthermore, we\nverify that the power-law indices of these rates are consistent with those\nobtained from the numerical simulations of Tamilan et al. (2024) at late times.\nIn particular, our analytical solution demonstrates that magnetic braking leads\nto a more rapid decay of the mass accretion rate, mass loss rate, and\nbolometric luminosity. In the presence of a strong poloidal magnetic field, all\nthree quantities asymptote to $t^{-5/2}$. This steep decay index can serve as a\npotential observational signature of magnetocentrifugally driven winds with\nstrong poloidal magnetic fields in TDE disks.",

While deep learning has driven significant progress in this task,\nsmall patch-based classifiers, which account for over 90% of the progress, face\nlimitations: (1) the small patch (e.g., 7x7, 9x9)-based sampling approach\nconsiders a limited receptive field, resulting in insufficient spatial\nstructural information critical for object-level identification and noise-like\nmisclassifications even within uniform regions; (2) undefined optimal patch\nsizes lead to coarse label predictions, which degrade performance; and (3) a\nlack of multi-shape awareness around objects. To address these challenges, we\ndraw inspiration from large-scale image segmentation techniques, which excel at\nhandling object boundaries-a capability essential for semantic labeling in HSI\nclassification. However, their application remains under-explored in this task\ndue to (1) the prevailing notion that larger patch sizes degrade performance,\n(2) the extensive unlabeled regions in HSI groundtruth, and (3) the\nmisalignment of input shapes between HSI data and segmentation models. Thus, in\nthis study, we propose a novel paradigm and baseline, HSIseg, for HSI\nclassification that leverages segmentation techniques combined with a novel\nDynamic Shifted Regional Transformer (DSRT) to overcome these challenges. We\nalso introduce an intuitive progressive learning framework with adaptive\npseudo-labeling to iteratively incorporate unlabeled regions into the training\nprocess, thereby advancing the application of segmentation techniques.\nAdditionally, we incorporate auxiliary data through multi-source data\ncollaboration, promoting better feature interaction.

The design of KiSS is informed by a detailed workload analysis that\nidentifies critical patterns in container size, invocation frequency, and\nmemory contention.

We introduce a new hyperparameter for the\nCNN policy, proposing that this temporal field can and should be treated as a\nhyperparameter for these models. We examine the significance of this temporal\nfield by iteratively expanding the window of observations presented to the CNN\npolicy during the deep reinforcement learning process. Our iterative process\ninvolves progressively increasing the observation period from two weeks to\ntwelve weeks, allowing us to examine the effects of different temporal windows\non the model's performance. This window expansion is implemented in two\nsettings.

We answer this question in the affirmative by showing that\nthe continuous Hedge algorithm achieves\n$\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(d^{\\frac{2}{3}}T^{\\frac{1}{3}})$ alternating regret for\nany adversarial $d$-dimensional OCO problems.

    "abstract": "A recent work by Schlisselberg et al. (2024) studies a delay-as-payoff model\nfor stochastic multi-armed bandits, where the payoff (either loss or reward) is\ndelayed for a period that is proportional to the payoff itself. While this\ncaptures many real-world applications, the simple multi-armed bandit setting\nlimits the practicality of their results. In this paper, we address this\nlimitation by studying the delay-as-payoff model for contextual linear bandits.\nSpecifically, we start from the case with a fixed action set and propose an\nefficient algorithm whose regret overhead compared to the standard no-delay\ncase is at most $D\\Delta_{\\max}\\log T$, where $T$ is the total horizon, $D$ is\nthe maximum delay, and $\\Delta_{\\max}$ is the maximum suboptimality gap. When\npayoff is loss, we also show further improvement of the bound, demonstrating a\nseparation between reward and loss similar to Schlisselberg et al. (2024).\nContrary to standard linear bandit algorithms that construct least squares\nestimator and confidence ellipsoid, the main novelty of our algorithm is to\napply a phased arm elimination procedure by only picking actions in a\nvolumetric spanner of the action set, which addresses challenges arising from\nboth payoff-dependent delays and large action sets. We further extend our\nresults to the case with varying action sets by adopting the reduction from\nHanna et al. (2023).

Still, its microscopic mechanisms at the\nindividual particle kinetic level remain a subject of ongoing research,\nspecially in dense systems. In this work, we systematically investigate the\nshear viscosity ($\\eta$) of two-dimensional (2D) simple fluids using computer\nsimulations of Lennard-Jones, Yukawa, and one-component plasma systems. By\ncombining Frenkel's liquid description, consisting of solid-like quasi-harmonic\nvibrations interrupted by thermally activated hops, with the concept of\nlifetime of local atomic connectivity $\\tau_{LC}$, we find a surprisingly\nsimple formula for the kinematic viscosity that is solely determined by\n$\\tau_{LC}$ and the average kinetic particle speed $\\bar{v}_p$. The derived\nanalytical expression provides a direct link between macroscopic and\nmicroscopic dynamics, which shows excellent agreement with the simulation data\nin the dense liquid-like regime in all the 2D fluids considered. Moreover, it\nis discovered that, $\\tau_{LC}$ in 2D fluids is universally determined by the\neffective potential difference between the first peak and valley of the pair\ncorrelation function, implying a direct connection between macroscopic shear\ntransport and microscopic structure. Finally, we demonstrate that the\ncharacteristic length scale $l_p= \\bar{v}_p \\tau_{LC}$, which governs the\nmacroscopic shear viscosity, aligns with the elastic length-scale that defines\nthe propagation limit of collective shear waves in liquids. These findings\nestablish that shear viscosity in 2D fluids arises from the diffusive transport\nof average particle momentum across the elastic length scale.

To address this issue, the impacts of inspection speed and\nsampling rate on image quality are studied, as variations in these factors can\ncause stripe noise, axial compression of defect features, and increased\ninterference, complicating accurate detection. We define the relationship\nbetween inspection speed and sampling rate as spatial sampling resolution (SSR)\nand propose an adaptive SSR target-feature-oriented (AS-TFO) method. This\nmethod incorporates adaptive adjustment and pyramid image fusion techniques to\nenhance defect detection under different SSR scenarios. Experimental results\nshow that under high SSR scenarios, the method achieves a precision of 94.73%\nand a recall of 96.77%.

Recently, multi-agent LLM systems have shown remarkable\ncapabilities in simulating human-like behavior, and replicating some human lab\nexperiments.

We find that multi-agent LLM systems successfully\nreplicate human behavior from lab experiments of the public goods game with\nthree experimental treatments - priming, transparency, and varying endowments.\nBeyond replicating existing experiments, we find that multi-agent LLM systems\ncan replicate the expected human behavior when combining experimental\ntreatments, even if no previous study combined those specific treatments.\nLastly, we find that multi-agent systems can exhibit a rich set of unbounded\nactions that people do in the real world outside of the lab -- such as\ncollaborating and even cheating.

However, its reliability is\ncompromised by the CoT reasoning's inability to capture comprehensive and\ndeeper details, often leading to incomplete outcomes. Existing methods mainly\nrely on majority voting or criteria expansion, which is insufficient to address\nthe limitation in CoT. We propose Crowd-based Comparative Evaluation, which\nintroduces additional crowd responses to compare with the candidate responses,\nthereby exposing deeper and more comprehensive details within the candidate\nresponses. This process effectively guides LLM-as-a-Judge to provide a more\ndetailed CoT judgment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach\nenhances evaluation reliability, achieving an average accuracy gain of 6.7%\nacross five benchmarks. Moreover, our method produces higher-quality CoTs that\nfacilitate judge distillation and exhibit superior performance in rejection\nsampling for supervised fine-tuning (SFT), referred to as crowd rejection\nsampling, thereby enabling more efficient SFT. Our analysis confirms that CoTs\ngenerated by ours are more comprehensive and of higher quality, and evaluation\naccuracy improves as inference scales.",

On\nthe other hand, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have become the standard\nmethod for most of computer vision tasks. However, the memory allocation for\nthe intermediate data in convolution layers can cause severe memory pressure\nduring model training. Many solutions have been proposed to resolve the\nproblem. Besides hardware-dependent solutions, a general methodology\nrematerialization can reduce GPU memory usage by trading computation for memory\nefficiently. The idea is to select a set of intermediate results during the\nforward phase as checkpoints, and only save them in memory to reduce memory\nusage. The backward phase recomputes the intermediate data from the closest\ncheckpoints in memory as needed. This recomputation increases execution time\nbut saves memory by not storing all intermediate results in memory during the\nforward phase. In this paper, we will focus on efficiently finding the optimal\ncheckpoint subset to achieve the least peak memory usage during the model\ntraining. We first describe the theoretical background of the training of a\nneural network using mathematical equations. We use these equations to identify\nall essential data required during both forward and backward phases to compute\nthe gradient of weights of the model. We first identify the checkpoint\nselection problem and propose a dynamic programming algorithm with time\ncomplexity O(n3) to solve the problem of finding the optimal checkpoint subset.\nWith extensive experiments, we formulate a more accurate description of the\nproblem using our theoretical analysis and revise the objective function based\non the tracing, and propose an O(n)-time algorithm for finding the optimal\ncheckpoint subset.",

Extensive experiments on three benchmark\ndatasets CREMA-D, UrbanSound8K-AV, and MNISTDVS-NTIDIGITS demonstrate that\nS-CMRL significantly outperforms existing multimodal SNN methods, achieving the\nstate-of-the-art performance.

Currently, only a small fraction of GRBs have independent\nredshift measurements, primarily due to the need of rapid follow-up optical/IR\nspectroscopic observations. For this reason, many have utilized\nphenomenological correlations to derive pseudo-redshifts of GRBs with no\nredshift measurement. In this work, we explore the feasibility of analytically\nderiving pseudo-redshifts directly from the Amati and Yonetoku relations. We\nsimulate populations of GRBs that (i) fall perfectly on the phenomenological\ncorrelation track, and (ii) include intrinsic scatter matching observations.\nOur findings indicate that, in the case of the Amati relation , the\nmathematical formulation is ill-behaved so that it yields two solutions within\na reasonable redshift range $z \\in [0.1, 10] $. When realistic scatter is\nincluded, it may result in no solution, or the redshift error range is\nexcessively large. In the case of the Yonetoku relation, while it can result in\na unique solution in most cases, the large systematic errors of the redshift\ncalls for attention, especially when attempting to use pseudo redshifts to\nstudy GRB population properties.",

PHIER uses an object-centric\nscene encoder, self-supervised losses that infer semantic relations between\npredicates, and a hyperbolic distance metric that captures hierarchical\nstructure; it learns a structured latent space of image-predicate pairs that\nguides reasoning over state classification queries. We evaluate PHIER in the\nCALVIN and BEHAVIOR robotic environments and show that PHIER significantly\noutperforms existing methods in few-shot, out-of-distribution state\nclassification, and demonstrates strong zero- and few-shot generalization from\nsimulated to real-world tasks.

In nearly all\nsuch applications, electro-optic (EO) components play a critical role in\ngenerating, monitoring, stabilizing, and modulating the solitons. Towards\nbuilding photonic integrated circuits for next-generation applications, that\nwill simultaneously maximize system performance and minimize size, weight, and\npower consumption metrics, achieving soliton microcombs and efficient EO\nmodulation on a chip is essential. X-cut thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) has\nemerged as a leading photonic platform for the realization of high-performance\nintegrated EO devices and systems. However, despite extensive research, soliton\nmicrocombs have remained elusive to X-cut TFLN due to its multiple strong\nRaman-active modes, in-plane refractive index anisotropy, and photorefractive\neffects. Here, we address this long-standing challenge and demonstrate\nversatile soliton microcombs on X-cut TFLN, with repetition-rates spanning from\nthe gigahertz (~26 GHz) up to the millimeter-wave (~0.156 THz) regime. The\ncombs feature exceptional long-term stability, maintaining a direct\ninjection-locked state for over 90 minutes (manually terminated), with\nrepetition-rate phase noise closely tracking that of a high-quality electronic\nmicrowave synthesizer.

However, the quantum gravity-induced entanglement of matter (QGEM)\nprotocol proposes such a test by testing entanglement between adjacent\nmatter-wave interferometers. One key obstacle to experimentally realising this\nprotocol is the creation of a spatial quantum superposition with heavy masses.\nInitially, it was envisaged that the superposition size would have to be of\norder 200 micron for a mass $10^{-14}$ kg (to obtain the entanglement phase of\norder unity when the centre of mass of the two interferometers are at a\nseparation of 450 microns). The experimental design has since improved, e.g. by\nassuming that the two interferometers are separated by an electromagnetic\nscreen, which helps bring the separation distance close to 35 micron. Here, we\ndo parameter scans taking into account the electromagnetic screening, and we\nconsider different geometrical setups; we show superpositions of at least a\nmicron-size for mass $10^{-14}$ kg with a decoherence rate of order $10^{-3}$\nHz are required.",

From a theoretical perspective, this\nphenomenon should not appear in well-specified settings, and, indeed, a growing\nbody of empirical work hypothesizes that misspecification, where the learner is\nnot sufficiently expressive to represent the target distribution, may be the\nroot cause. Under misspecification -- where the goal is to learn as well as the\nbest-in-class model up to a multiplicative approximation factor $C\\geq 1$ -- we\nconfirm that $C$ indeed grows with $H$ for next-token prediction, lending\ntheoretical support to this empirical hypothesis.

    "abstract": "Organizations often lay down rules or guidelines called Natural Language\nAccess Control Policies (NLACPs) for specifying who gets access to which\ninformation and when. However, these cannot be directly used in a target access\ncontrol model like Attribute-based Access Control (ABAC). Manually translating\nthe NLACP rules into Machine Enforceable Security Policies (MESPs) is both time\nconsuming and resource intensive, rendering it infeasible especially for large\norganizations. Automated machine translation workflows, on the other hand,\nrequire information security officers to be adept at using such processes. To\neffectively address this problem, we have developed a free web-based publicly\naccessible tool called LMN (LLMs for generating MESPs from NLACPs) that takes\nan NLACP as input and converts it into a corresponding MESP. Internally, LMN\nuses the GPT 3.5 API calls and an appropriately chosen prompt. Extensive\nexperiments with different prompts and performance metrics firmly establish the\nusefulness of LMN.",

In this paper, we analyze the\nrecently proposed equivariant OT flows that learn permutation invariant\ngenerative models for point-based molecular data and we show that these models\nscale poorly on large point clouds. Also, we observe learning (equivariant) OT\nflows is generally challenging since straightening flow trajectories makes the\nlearned flow model complex at the beginning of the trajectory.

    "abstract": "AI safety is a rapidly growing area of research that seeks to prevent the\nharm and misuse of frontier AI technology, particularly with respect to\ngenerative AI (GenAI) tools that are capable of creating realistic and\nhigh-quality content through text prompts. Examples of such tools include large\nlanguage models (LLMs) and text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models. As the\nperformance of various leading GenAI models approaches saturation due to\nsimilar training data sources and neural network architecture designs, the\ndevelopment of reliable safety guardrails has become a key differentiator for\nresponsibility and sustainability. This paper presents a formalization of the\nconcept of computational safety, which is a mathematical framework that enables\nthe quantitative assessment, formulation, and study of safety challenges in\nGenAI through the lens of signal processing theory and methods. In particular,\nwe explore two exemplary categories of computational safety challenges in GenAI\nthat can be formulated as hypothesis testing problems. For the safety of model\ninput, we show how sensitivity analysis and loss landscape analysis can be used\nto detect malicious prompts with jailbreak attempts. For the safety of model\noutput, we elucidate how statistical signal processing and adversarial learning\ncan be used to detect AI-generated content. Finally, we discuss key open\nresearch challenges, opportunities, and the essential role of signal processing\nin computational AI safety.",

This study proposes a short-term traffic prediction\nmodel based on real-world road topologies and a typical four-way, eight-phase\ntraffic signal control scheme. The model accounts for traffic flow disparities\nacross directions and signal phase change frequencies, integrating these\nfactors into an optimization objective for global traffic optimization. The\nstructure of this objective function is similar to spin-glass systems in\nstatistical physics. A Simulated Bifurcation optimization algorithm is\nintroduced, with traditional simulated annealing as a benchmark.

Using real traffic flow and road network data\nfrom Beijing, we initialized the model and conducted numerical optimization\nexperiments. The results indicate that Simulated Bifurcation significantly\noutperforms simulated annealing in computational efficiency, effectively\nsolving combinatorial optimization problems with multiple spin interactions,\nand reducing the time complexity to $O(N^{1.35})$.

A\nmusical note is characterized by pitch, onset, and offset in an audio domain,\nwhereas it is defined in terms of pitch and note value in a musical score\ndomain. A time-aligned score, derived from timing information along with pitch\nand note value, allows matching a part of the score with the corresponding part\nof the music audio, enabling various applications. In this paper, we consider\nan extended version of the traditional note-level transcription task that\nrecognizes onset, offset, and pitch, through including extraction of additional\nnote value to generate a time-aligned score from an audio input. To address\nthis new challenge, we propose an end-to-end framework that integrates\nrecognition of the note value, pitch, and temporal information. This approach\navoids error accumulation inherent in multi-stage methods and enhances accuracy\nthrough mutual reinforcement. Our framework employs tokenized representations\nspecifically targeted for this task, through incorporating note value\ninformation. Furthermore, we introduce a pseudo-labeling technique to address a\nscarcity problem of annotated note value data.

Experimental results demonstrate the superior\nperformance of the proposed model in note-level transcription tasks when\ncompared to existing state-of-the-art approaches.

This\nstarts with a precise cataloging of the potential applications of machine\nunlearning to AIA compliance. For each, we flag any legal ambiguities clouding\nthe potential application and, moreover, flag the technical gaps that exist\nbetween the potential application and the state of the art of machine\nunlearning. Finally, we end with a call to action: for both machine learning\nresearchers and policymakers, to, respectively, solve the open technical and\nlegal questions that will unlock machine unlearning's potential to assist\ncompliance with the AIA - and other AI regulation like it.",

    "abstract": "Patients have long sought health information online, and increasingly, they\nare turning to generative AI to answer their health-related queries. Given the\nhigh stakes of the medical domain, techniques like retrieval-augmented\ngeneration and citation grounding have been widely promoted as methods to\nreduce hallucinations and improve the accuracy of AI-generated responses and\nhave been widely adopted into search engines. This paper argues that even when\nthese methods produce literally accurate content drawn from source documents\nsans hallucinations, they can still be highly misleading. Patients may derive\nsignificantly different interpretations from AI-generated outputs than they\nwould from reading the original source material, let alone consulting a\nknowledgeable clinician. Through a large-scale query analysis on topics\nincluding disputed diagnoses and procedure safety, we support our argument with\nquantitative and qualitative evidence of the suboptimal answers resulting from\ncurrent systems. In particular, we highlight how these models tend to\ndecontextualize facts, omit critical relevant sources, and reinforce patient\nmisconceptions or biases.

    "abstract": "Some frustrated magnets exhibit a huge hysteresis called \"global hysteresis\n(GH)\", where the magnetic plateaus appearing in the increasing field process\nare skipped in the decreasing field process from the high magnetic field state.\nIn this paper, we focused on the frustrated magnet DyRu2Si2 and measured\nmagnetization relaxations from two plateau states inside the GH loop, the\nphases III and IV, and investigated the phase transitions into them. As a\nresult of the relaxation measurements, no relaxation is observed in the phase\nIII, whereas long-time relaxations of more than 105 sec are observed at the\nphase IV plateau. Moreover, a Mpemba-effect-like relaxation phenomenon where\nthe relaxation from an initial state prepared in the zero-field-cooled\ncondition overtakes that from an initial state prepared in the field-cooled\ncondition is observed. These results indicate that the phase IV is the\nnon-ergodic state with a complex free-energy landscape with multiple local\nminima, while the phase III has a simple free energy structure. Therefore, the\nIII-IV phase transition is considered to be the ergodic to non-ergodic phase\ntransition. Although this type of phase transition typically occurs in random\nglassy systems, the phase IV in DyRu2Si2 has a regular long-range ordered\nmagnetic structure and yet exhibits non-ergodic properties, which is highly\nnontrivial.

Most of the current methods fail to\ntake full advantage of different characteristics in multi-modal data, and\nlacking causal reasoning ability in models impedes the progress of implicit\nphysical knowledge inferring. To address these issues, our proposed RDCL method\ndecouples videos into static (time-invariant) and dynamic (time-varying)\nfactors in the latent space by the disentangled sequential encoder, which\nadopts a variational autoencoder (VAE) to maximize the mutual information with\na contrastive loss function. Furthermore, we introduce a counterfactual\nlearning module to augment the model's reasoning ability by modeling physical\nknowledge relationships among different objects under counterfactual\nintervention. To alleviate the incomplete modality data issue, we introduce a\nrobust multimodal learning method to recover the missing data by decomposing\nthe shared features and model-specific features.

Recently, Deep Neural Network-driven Color Constancy (DNNCC) models\nhave made substantial advancements. Nevertheless, the potential risks in DNNCC\ndue to the vulnerability of deep neural networks have not yet been explored. In\nthis paper, we conduct the first investigation into the impact of a key factor\nin color constancy-brightness-on DNNCC from a robustness perspective. Our\nevaluation reveals that several mainstream DNNCC models exhibit high\nsensitivity to brightness despite their focus on chromaticity estimation. This\nsheds light on a potential limitation of existing DNNCC models: their\nsensitivity to brightness may hinder performance given the widespread\nbrightness variations in real-world datasets. From the insights of our\nanalysis, we propose a simple yet effective brightness robustness enhancement\nstrategy for DNNCC models, termed BRE. The core of BRE is built upon the\nadaptive step-size adversarial brightness augmentation technique, which\nidentifies high-risk brightness variation and generates augmented images via\nexplicit brightness adjustment. Subsequently, BRE develops a\nbrightness-robustness-aware model optimization strategy that integrates\nadversarial brightness training and brightness contrastive loss, significantly\nbolstering the brightness robustness of DNNCC models. BRE is\nhyperparameter-free and can be integrated into existing DNNCC models, without\nincurring additional overhead during the testing phase. Experiments on two\npublic color constancy datasets-ColorChecker and Cube+-demonstrate that the\nproposed BRE consistently enhances the illuminant estimation performance of\nexisting DNNCC models, reducing the estimation error by an average of 5.04%\nacross six mainstream DNNCC models, underscoring the critical role of enhancing\nbrightness robustness in these models.",

In this paper, we endeavor on a\nscarcely explored task named Gaseous Object Detection (GOD), which is\nundertaken to explore whether the object detection techniques can be extended\nfrom solid substances to gaseous substances. Nevertheless, the gas exhibits\nsignificantly different visual characteristics: 1) saliency deficiency, 2)\narbitrary and ever-changing shapes, 3) lack of distinct boundaries. To\nfacilitate the study on this challenging task, we construct a GOD-Video dataset\ncomprising 600 videos (141,017 frames) that cover various attributes with\nmultiple types of gases. A comprehensive benchmark is established based on this\ndataset, allowing for a rigorous evaluation of frame-level and video-level\ndetectors.

Traditional metrics like word error rate (WER) and\ncharacter error rate (CER) are commonly used to evaluate ASR performance but\noften fail to reflect transcription quality in critical contexts, particularly\nwhen detecting fabricated outputs. This phenomenon, known as hallucination, is\nespecially concerning in high-stakes domains such as healthcare, legal, and\naviation, where errors can have severe consequences. In our work, we address\nthis gap by investigating hallucination in ASR models. We examine how factors\nsuch as distribution shifts, model size, and model architecture influence the\nhallucination error rate (HER), a metric we introduce to quantify\nhallucinations. Our analysis of over 20 ASR models reveals \\numinsights~key\ninsights: (1) High WERs can mask low hallucination rates, while low WERs may\nconceal dangerous hallucinations. (2) Synthetic noise, both adversarial and\ncommon perturbations like white noise, pitch shift, and time stretching,\nincrease HER.

A\npopular approach to addressing this issue is invariant learning (IL), in which\nthe model is compiled to focus on invariant features instead of spurious\nfeatures by adding strong constraints during training. However, there are some\npotential pitfalls of strong invariant constraints. Due to the limited number\nof diverse environments and over-regularization in the feature space, it may\nlead to a loss of important details in the invariant features while alleviating\nthe spurious correlations, namely the over-invariance, which can also degrade\nthe generalization performance.

To alleviate this\nissue, we propose a simple approach Diverse Invariant Learning (DivIL) by\nadding the unsupervised contrastive learning and the random masking mechanism\ncompensatory for the invariant constraints, which can be applied to various IL\nmethods.

However, only YOLOv8 was utilised in outdoor experiments, as the HSV\ntransformation was not capable of accurately drawing fruit contours.\nExperiments include ten distinct fruit patterns with six apples and six\noranges. A grid structure for homography (perspective) transformation was\nemployed to convert detected midpoints into 3D world coordinates. The\nexperiments evaluated detection and localisation under varying lighting and\nbackground disturbances, revealing accurate performance indoors, but\nsignificant challenges outdoors. Our results show that indoor experiments using\nYOLOv8 achieved 100% detection accuracy, while outdoor conditions decreased\nperformance, with an average accuracy of 69.15% for YOLOv8 under direct\nsunlight. The study demonstrates that real-world applications reveal\nsignificant limitations due to changing lighting, background disturbances, and\ncolour and shape variability. These findings underscore the need for further\nrefinement of algorithms and sensors to enhance the robustness of robotic\nharvesters for agricultural use.",

    "abstract": "Shallow water equations (SWEs) are the backbone of most hydrodynamics models\nfor flood prediction, river engineering, and many other water resources\napplications. The estimation of flow resistance, i.e., the Manning's roughness\ncoefficient $n$, is crucial for ensuring model accuracy, and has been\npreviously determined using empirical formulas or tables. To better account for\ntemporal and spatial variability in channel roughness, inverse modeling of $n$\nusing observed flow data is more reliable and adaptable; however, it is\nchallenging when using traditional SWE solvers. Based on the concept of\nuniversal differential equation (UDE), which combines physics-based\ndifferential equations with neural networks (NNs), we developed a universal\nSWEs (USWEs) solver, Hydrograd, for hybrid hydrodynamics modeling. It can do\naccurate forward simulations, support automatic differentiation (AD) for\ngradient-based sensitivity analysis and parameter inversion, and perform\nscientific machine learning for physics discovery. In this work, we first\nvalidated the accuracy of its forward modeling, then applied a real-world case\nto demonstrate the ability of USWEs to capture model sensitivity (gradients)\nand perform inverse modeling of Manning's $n$. Furthermore, we used a NN to\nlearn a universal relationship between $n$, hydraulic parameters, and flow in a\nreal river channel. Unlike inverse modeling using surrogate models, Hydrograd\nuses a two-dimensional SWEs solver as its physics backbone, which eliminates\nthe need for data-intensive pretraining and resolves the generalization problem\nwhen applied to out-of-sample scenarios. This differentiable modeling approach,\nwith seamless integration with NNs, provides a new pathway for solving complex\ninverse problems and discovering new physics in hydrodynamics.",

    "abstract": "A neural stochastic differential equation (SDE) is an SDE with drift and\ndiffusion terms parametrized by neural networks. The training procedure for\nneural SDEs consists of optimizing the SDE vector field (neural network)\nparameters to minimize the expected value of an objective functional on\ninfinite-dimensional path-space. Existing training techniques focus on methods\nto efficiently compute path-wise gradients of the objective functional with\nrespect to these parameters, then pair this with Monte-Carlo simulation to\nestimate the expectation, and stochastic gradient descent to optimize. In this\nwork we introduce a novel training technique which bypasses and improves upon\nMonte-Carlo simulation; we extend results in the theory of Wiener-space\ncubature to approximate the expected objective functional by a weighted sum of\ndeterministic ODE solutions. This allows us to compute gradients by efficient\nODE adjoint methods. Furthermore, we exploit a high-order recombination scheme\nto drastically reduce the number of ODE solutions necessary to achieve a\nreasonable approximation. We show that this Wiener-space cubature approach can\nsurpass the O(1/sqrt(n)) rate of Monte-Carlo simulation, or the O(log(n)/n)\nrate of quasi-Monte-Carlo, to achieve a O(1/n) rate under reasonable\nassumptions.",
