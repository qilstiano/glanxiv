    "abstract": "Evolutionary societal changes often prompt a debate. The positions of the two\nmajor political parties in the United States on civil rights issues underwent a\nreversal in the 20th century. The conventional view holds that this shift was a\nstructural break in the 1960s, driven by party elites, while recent studies\nargue that the change was a more gradual process that began as early as the\n1930s, driven by local rank-and-file party members. Motivated by this\ncontroversy, this paper develops a nonparametric Bayesian model that\nincorporates a hidden Markov model into the Dirichlet process mixture model. A\ndistinctive feature of the proposed approach is that it models a process in\nwhich multiple latent clusters emerge and diminish as a continuing process so\nthat it uncovers any of steady, sudden, and repeated shifts in analysing\nlongitudinal data. Our model estimates each party's positions on civil rights\nin each state based on the legislative activities of their Congressional\nmembers, identifying cross- and within-party coalitions over time. We find\nevidence of gradual racial realignment in the 20th century, with two periods of\nfast changes during the 1948 election and the Civil Rights Movement.",

    "abstract": "This study presents a comparative analysis of Monte Carlo (MC) and\nquasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) methods in the context of derivative pricing,\nemphasizing convergence rates and the curse of dimensionality. After a concise\noverview of traditional Monte Carlo techniques for evaluating expectations of\nderivative securities, the paper introduces quasi-Monte Carlo methods, which\nleverage low-discrepancy sequences to achieve more uniformly distributed sample\npoints without relying on randomness. Theoretical insights highlight that QMC\nmethods can attain superior convergence rates of $O(1/n^{1-\\epsilon})$ compared\nto the standard MC rate of $O(1/\\sqrt{n})$, where $\\epsilon>0$. Numerical\nexperiments are conducted on two types of options: geometric basket call\noptions and Asian call options. For the geometric basket options, a\nfive-dimensional setting under the Black-Scholes framework is utilized,\ncomparing the performance of Sobol' and Faure low-discrepancy sequences against\nstandard Monte Carlo simulations. Results demonstrate a significant reduction\nin root mean square error for QMC methods as the number of sample points\nincreases. Similarly, for Asian call options, incorporating a Brownian bridge\nconstruction with RQMC further enhances accuracy and convergence efficiency.\nThe findings confirm that quasi-Monte Carlo methods offer substantial\nimprovements over traditional Monte Carlo approaches in derivative pricing,\nparticularly in scenarios with moderate dimensionality.",

    "abstract": "As AI becomes more embedded in workplaces, it is shifting from a tool for\nefficiency to an active force in organizational decision-making. Whether due to\nanthropomorphism or intentional design choices, people often assign human-like\nqualities, including gender, to AI systems. However, how AI managers are\nperceived in comparison to human managers and how gender influences these\nperceptions remains uncertain. To investigate this, we conducted randomized\ncontrolled trials (RCTs) where teams of three participants worked together\nunder a randomly assigned manager. The manager was either a human or an AI and\nwas presented as male, female, or gender-unspecified. The manager's role was to\nselect the best-performing team member for an additional award. Our findings\nreveal that while participants initially showed no strong preference based on\nmanager type or gender, their perceptions changed significantly after\nexperiencing the award process. As expected, those who received awards rated\ntheir managers as more trustworthy, competent, fair, and were more willing to\nwork with similar managers in the future, while those who were not selected\nviewed them less favorably. However, male managers, whether human or AI, were\nmore positively received by awarded participants, whereas female managers,\nespecially female AI managers, faced greater skepticism and negative judgments\nwhen they did not give awards.

    "abstract": "The rapid development of the Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs)\nin recent years has been closely linked to their ever-growing and already\nenormous sizes. Many LLMs contain hundreds of billions of parameters and\nrequire dedicated hardware resources for training and inference. One of the key\nchallenges inherent to the Transformer architecture is the requirement to\nsupport numerous non-linear transformations that involves normalization. For\ninstance, each decoder block typically contains at least one Softmax operation\nand two Layernorms. The computation of the corresponding normalization scaling\nfactors becomes a major bottleneck as it requires spatial collective\noperations. In other words, when it comes to the computation of denominators\nfor Softmax and Layernorm, all vector elements must be aggregated into a single\nlocation, requiring significant communication. These collective operations slow\ndown inference on Transformers by approximately 20%, defeating the whole\npurpose of distributed in-memory compute. In this work, we propose an extremely\nefficient technique that can completely hide the overhead caused by such\ncollective operations. Note that each Softmax and Layernorm operation is\ntypically followed by a linear layer. Since non-linear and linear operations\nare performed on different hardware engines, they can be easily parallelized\nonce the algebra allows such commutation. By leveraging the inherent properties\nof linear operations, we can defer the normalization of the preceding Softmax\nand Layernorm until after the linear layer is computed. Now we can compute the\ncollective scaling factors concurrently with the matrix multiplication and\ncompletely hide the latency of the former behind the latter. Such\nparallelization preserves the numerical accuracy while significantly improving\nthe hardware utilization and reducing the overall latency.",

The\nprobability increases to 80\\% at wavelengths shorter than 400 nm. These\nfindings underscore the importance of ultraviolet stellar photometry.",

In this paper, we formulate a more\ngeneral framework for knowledge distillation where the student learns from the\nteacher during training, and also learns to ask for the teacher's help at\ntest-time following rules specifying test-time restrictions. Towards this, we\nfirst formulate knowledge distillation as an entropy-regularized value\noptimization problem. Adopting Path Consistency Learning to solve this, leads\nto a new knowledge distillation algorithm using on-policy and off-policy\ndemonstrations. We extend this using constrained reinforcement learning to a\nframework that incorporates the use of the teacher model as a test-time\nreference, within constraints. In this situation, akin to a human learner, the\nmodel needs to learn not only the learning material, but also the relative\ndifficulty of different sections to prioritize for seeking teacher help. We\nexamine the efficacy of our method through experiments in translation and\nsummarization tasks, observing trends in accuracy and teacher use, noting that\nour approach unlocks operating points not available to the popular Speculative\nDecoding approach.",

First, we extend some known results about which covering properties,\ntogether with (a weakening of) homogeneity, imply that a manifold is Hausdorff.\nLet $NH_M(x)$ be the subset of points of a space $M$ which cannot be separated\nof $x$ by open sets. We give various properties that imply discreteness of\n$NH_M(x)$. Using minimal flows, we exhibit homogeneous NH-manifolds $M$ with\nnon-homogeneous (and thus non-discrete) $NH_M(x)$. In particular, $NH_M(x)$ may\nbe a coutable discrete union of lines and compact intervals (in dimension $2$)\nor $n$-dimensional torus (in dimension $n+1$). We show that there is an\neverywhere non-Hausdorff hereditarily separable manifold under CH and that the\nexistence of an everywhere non-Hausdorff hereditarily separable manifold in a\nparticular class implies that of a locally compact S-space. We also construct\nvarious examples of somewhat pathological NH-manifolds.

Through this research, this study identifies key\nmotivators such as organizational needs, the IT/security team's relationship\nwith vendors, and legal and regulatory requirements placed on the business and\nits staff. There are also numerous significant reasons discovered for why the\ndecision is taken not to patch, including limited resources (e.g.,\nperson-power), challenges with manual patch management tasks, human error, bad\npatches, unreliable patch management tools, and the perception that related\nvulnerabilities would not be exploited. These disincentives, in combination\nwith the motivators above, highlight the difficult balance that organizations\nand their security teams need to maintain on a daily basis. Finally, we\nconclude by discussing implications of these findings and important future\nconsiderations.",

In this paper, we exploit the\nintegrability of the Nonlinear Schr\\\"{o}dinger Equation, which accurately\nmodels optical fiber communications, to derive an expression for the spectral\nefficiency of an optical fiber communications channel, expressed fully in the\nscattering data domain of the Non-linear Fourier Transform and valid in the\nlimit of low amplifier noise. We utilize the relationship between the derived\nnoise-covariance operator and the Jacobian of the mapping between the signal\nand the scattering data to obtain the properties of the former. Emerging from\nthe structure of the covariance operator is the significance of the Gordon-Haus\neffect in moderating and finally reversing the increase of the spectral\nefficiency with power.

Crucially, RSPO regularized with a linear combination of forward and\nreverse KL divergence significantly boosts the length-controlled win rate on\nAlpacaEval-2 from $28.5\\%$ (unregularized self-play, SPPO) to $35.4\\%$, and\nconsistently demonstrates superior performance on Arena-Hard, MT-Bench, ArmoRM\nscores, and response diversity.

Nearly all existing\nworks on abuse detection have as their goal producing the best possible binary\nclassifier; i.e., one that labels unseen examples as \"benign\" or \"malicious\"\nwith high precision and recall. However, no prior published work considers what\ncomes next: what does the service actually do after it detects abuse?\n  In this paper, we argue that detection as described in previous work is not\nthe goal of those who are fighting OSN abuse. Rather, we believe the goal to be\nselecting actions (e.g., ban the user, block the request, show a CAPTCHA, or\n\"collect more evidence\") that optimize a tradeoff between harm caused by abuse\nand impact on benign users. With this framing, we see that enlarging the set of\npossible actions allows us to move the Pareto frontier in a way that is\nunattainable by simply tuning the threshold of a binary classifier. To\ndemonstrate the potential of our approach, we present Predictive Response\nOptimization (PRO), a system based on reinforcement learning that utilizes\navailable contextual information to predict future abuse and user-experience\nmetrics conditioned on each possible action, and select actions that optimize a\nmulti-dimensional tradeoff between abuse/harm and impact on user experience.\n  We deployed versions of PRO targeted at stopping automated activity on\nInstagram and Facebook.

We used $f_{\\rm rot}$, along with the Gaia effective\ntemperature and luminosity to deduce the (convective core) mass, radius, and\nevolutionary stage from grid modelling based on rotating stellar models. We\nderived a decline of $f_{\\rm rot}$ with a factor of 2 during the main-sequence\nevolution for this population of field stars, which covers a mass range from\n1.3M$_\\odot$ to 7M$_\\odot$. We found observational evidence for an increase in\nthe radial order of excited gravity modes as the stars evolve. For 969\npulsators, we derived an upper limit of the radial differential rotation\nbetween the convective core boundary and the surface from Gaia's vbroad\nmeasurement and found values up to 5.4.

It is compatible with a\nvariety of data-based training methodologies, including maximum likelihood and\nscore matching. It features a latent space akin to a modern Hopfield network,\nwhere the inherent Hopfield energy effectively assigns low densities to\nsparsely populated data regions, addressing common challenges in neural density\nestimators. Additionally, this Hopfield-like energy enables direct and rapid\ndata manipulation through the Concave-Convex Procedure (CCCP) rule,\nfacilitating tasks such as denoising and clustering. Our work demonstrates a\nprincipled framework for leveraging the complex interdependencies between\ndynamics and density estimation, as illustrated through synthetic examples that\nclarify the underlying theoretical intuitions.",

    "abstract": "3C 454.3 is a flat spectrum radio quasar (FSRQ) known for its high\nvariability across the electromagnetic spectrum, showing structural and flux\nvariability in its pc-scale jet, and correlated variability among frequency\nbands. This study aims to identify the structure, dynamics, and radiative\nprocesses common to the innermost regions of the blazar 3C 454.3. We\ninvestigate whether any jet component can be associated with $\\gamma-$ray\nemission and variability. We analyze the relationship between the variable\n$\\gamma-$ray emission and pc-scale jet properties in 3C 454.3 by combining\n$\\gamma-$ray data spanning twelve years with contemporaneous VLBA multi-epoch\nimages at 15 and 43 GHz. Spearman rank correlation tests are conducted to\ndetermine if the flux variability of any jet component is associated with\n$\\gamma-$ray variability. Core emission at 43 and 15 GHz strongly correlates\nwith $\\gamma-$ray emission. The 43 GHz core (Q0) contributes around 37$\\%$ of\nthe observed $\\gamma-$ray variability, while the 15 GHz core (K0) accounts for\n30$\\%$. A quasi-stationary component at 43 GHz, at a projected distance of 4.6\npc, correlates with the $\\gamma-$ray flux, accounting for 20$\\%$ of its\nemission between 2016 and 2021. We found a mobile component (Q3 between 2010.18\nand 2011.16) at 43 GHz with a projected distance between 0.8 and 2.3 pc and\napparent velocity of $\\beta_{app} = 9.9 \\pm 1.1$ c, accounting for\napproximately 28% of the $\\gamma-$ray emission. The observed simultaneous\nvariability in emission regions beyond the central parsec strongly suggests\nsynchrotron self-Compton (SSC) as the primary mechanism for $\\gamma-$ray\nproduction in these regions. Our findings demonstrate the existence of multiple\n$\\gamma-$ray emission regions within the blazar jet but also suggest that some\nof these regions are non-stationary over time.",

However, crafting a valid\nCBF relies on system-specific assumptions and the availability of an accurate\nsystem model, underscoring the need for systematic data-driven synthesis\nmethods. This paper introduces a data-driven approach to synthesizing a CBF for\ndiscrete-time LTI systems using only input-output measurements. The method\nbegins by computing the maximal control invariant set using an input-output\ndata-driven representation, eliminating the need for precise knowledge of the\nsystem's order and explicit state estimation. The proposed CBF is then\nsystematically derived from this set, which can accommodate multiple\ninput-output constraints. Furthermore, the proposed CBF is leveraged to develop\na minimally invasive safety filter that ensures recursive feasibility with an\nadaptive decay rate. To improve clarity, we assume a noise-free dataset, though\nthe method can be extended using data-driven reachability to capture noise\neffects and handle uncertainty. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed\nmethod is demonstrated on an unknown time-delay system.",

The answer to this\nquestion is the well-studied extremal number of $F$. Observing that every\nextremal example must be maximally $F$-free, a natural minimization problem is\nalso studied -- how few edges can an $n$-vertex maximal $F$-free graph have?\nThis leads to the saturation number of $F$. Both of these problems are\nnotoriously difficult to extend to $k$-uniform hypergraphs for any $k\\ge 3$.\n  Barefoot et al., in the case of forbidding triangles in graphs, asked a\nbeautiful question -- which numbers of edges, between the saturation number and\nthe extremal number, are actually realized by an $n$-vertex maximal $F$-free\ngraph? Hence named the saturation spectrum of $F$, this has since been\ndetermined precisely for several classes of graphs through a large number of\npapers over the past two decades.\n  In this paper, we extend the notion of the saturation spectrum to the\nhypergraph context. Given a graph $F$ and a hypergraph $G$ embedded on the same\nvertex set, we say $G$ is a {\\bf{Berge-$F$}} if there exists a bijection\n$\\phi:E(F)\\to E(G)$ such that $e\\subseteq \\phi(e)$ for all $e\\in E(F)$.

Then, structures with random variations of the links' stiffness, node\npositions, and random holes are compared. Combinations of these random factors\nare also considered, as well as the resilience of bistable elastic-brittle\nlattices with sacrificial links.

The results suggest new routes for rationally designing protective\nstructures using nonperiodic topology, bistability, and structural randomness.\nIn particular, we find that some quantities of interest can be maximized by\ntuning the randomized design appropriately -- for example, randomly removing\n8\\% of links maximizes energy dissipation.

In this study, we\ninvestigate 11 GW candidates from LVK's Third Observing Run (April 2019-March\n2020) that have a total detector-frame masses in the lite IMBH range. Using the\nBayesian inference algorithm \\texttt{RIFT}, we systematically analyze these\ncandidates with three state-of-the-art waveform models that incorporate higher\nharmonics, which are crucial for resolving lite IMBHs in LVK data. For each\ncandidate, we infer the pre-merger and post-merger black hole masses in the\nsource frame, along with black hole spin projections across all three models.\nUnder the assumption that these are binary black hole mergers, our analysis\nfinds that 5 of them have a post-merger lite IMBH with masses ranging from\n$110\\sim 350~\\mathrm{M}_\\odot$ with over 90\\% confidence interval.\nAdditionally, we note that one of their pre-merger black holes is within the\npair-instability supernova mass gap ($60-120~\\mathrm{M}_\\odot$) with more than\n90\\% confidence interval, and additional two pre-merger black holes above the\nmass-gap. Furthermore, we report discrepancies among the three waveform models\nin their mass and spin inferences of lite IMBHs, with at least three GW\ncandidates showing deviations beyond accepted statistical limits. While the\nastrophysical certainty of these candidates cannot be established, our study\nprovides a foundation to probe the lite IMBH population that emerge within the\nlow-frequency noise spectrum of LVK detectors.",

    "abstract": "Robust weed detection remains a challenging task in precision weeding,\nrequiring not only potent weed detection models but also large-scale, labeled\ndata. However, the labeled data adequate for model training is practically\ndifficult to come by due to the time-consuming, labor-intensive process that\nrequires specialized expertise to recognize plant species. This study\nintroduces semi-supervised object detection (SSOD) methods for leveraging\nunlabeled data for enhanced weed detection and proposes a new YOLOv8-based SSOD\nmethod, i.e., WeedTeacher. An experimental comparison of four SSOD methods,\nincluding three existing frameworks (i.e., DenseTeacher, EfficientTeacher, and\nSmallTeacher) and WeedTeacher, alongside fully supervised baselines, was\nconducted for weed detection in both in-domain and cross-domain contexts. A\nnew, diverse weed dataset was created as the testbed, comprising a total of\n19,931 field images from two differing domains, including 8,435 labeled\n(basic-domain) images acquired by handholding devices from 2021 to 2023 and\n11,496 unlabeled (new-domain) images acquired by a ground-based mobile platform\nin 2024. The in-domain experiment with models trained using 10% of the labeled,\nbasic-domain images and tested on the remaining 90% of the data, showed that\nthe YOLOv8-basedWeedTeacher achieved the highest accuracy among all four SSOD\nmethods, with an improvement of 2.6% mAP@50 and 3.1% mAP@50:95 over its\nsupervised baseline (i.e., YOLOv8l).

In this paper, we\nfocus on generating continuous families of optimal gaits-collections of gaits\nparameterized by step size or steering rate-to enhance controllability and\nmaneuverability. We uncover the underlying geometric structure of these optimal\ngait families and propose methods for constructing them using both global and\nlocal search strategies, where the local method and the global method\ncompensate each other. The global search approach is robust to nonsmooth\nbehavior, albeit yielding reduced-order solutions, while the local search\nprovides higher accuracy but can be unstable near nonsmooth regions.

    "abstract": "A fundamental problem in statistics and machine learning is to estimate a\nfunction $f$ from possibly noisy observations of its point samples. The goal is\nto design a numerical algorithm to construct an approximation $\\hat f$ to $f$\nin a prescribed norm that asymptotically achieves the best possible error (as a\nfunction of the number $m$ of observations and the variance $\\sigma^2$ of the\nnoise). This problem has received considerable attention in both nonparametric\nstatistics (noisy observations) and optimal recovery (noiseless observations).\nQuantitative bounds require assumptions on $f$, known as model class\nassumptions. Classical results assume that $f$ is in the unit ball of a Besov\nspace. In nonparametric statistics, the best possible performance of an\nalgorithm for finding $\\hat f$ is known as the minimax rate and has been\nstudied in this setting under the assumption that the noise is Gaussian. In\noptimal recovery, the best possible performance of an algorithm is known as the\noptimal recovery rate and has also been determined in this setting. While one\nwould expect that the minimax rate recovers the optimal recovery rate when the\nnoise level $\\sigma$ tends to zero, it turns out that the current results on\nminimax rates do not carefully determine the dependence on $\\sigma$ and the\nlimit cannot be taken. This paper handles this issue and determines the\nnoise-level-aware (NLA) minimax rates for Besov classes when error is measured\nin an $L_q$-norm with matching upper and lower bounds. The end result is a\nreconciliation between minimax rates and optimal recovery rates. The NLA\nminimax rate continuously depends on the noise level and recovers the optimal\nrecovery rate when $\\sigma$ tends to zero.",

    "abstract": "A large body of research on morphological paradigms makes the prediction that\nirregular morphological patterns of allomorphy are more likely to emerge and\npersist when they serve to mark important functional distinctions. More\nspecifically, it has been observed that in some Germanic languages in which\nnarrative past tense is expressed by the past participle, there is a greater\naffinity for stem allomorphy shared by preterite forms and past participles to\nthe exclusion of present forms (the so-called ABB pattern), as it serves to\nenhance marking of the binary semantic opposition between present and past.\nUsing data from 107 cognate verbs attested across 14 archaic and contemporary\nGermanic languages and a novel hierarchical phylogenetic model, we show that\nthere is a greater long-term preference for this alternation pattern in\nsituations where narrative past tense has been extended to the past participle,\nconfirming this hypothesis. We further elucidate the mechanisms underlying this\nassociation, demonstrating that this association holds because verbs with the\nABB pattern are more likely to preserve it in situations where it marks an\nimportant binary semantic opposition; however, there is less evidence that the\nABB pattern is extended to verbs with different patterns under the same\ncircumstances. These results bear on debate as to whether the distribution of\nirregularity we observe cross-linguistically is due primarily to (1) the\npreservation of irregular patterns or (2) an active drive toward\nirregularization in certain contexts, and are more in line with the first\nhypothesis.",

Using only directly measured\nquantities as model inputs, we reproduce the dispersion, diffusivity, velocity\ndistribution, and power spectra of sea ice observed in the Fram Strait with\nremarkable quantitative accuracy.

    "abstract": "Existing offline in-context reinforcement learning (ICRL) methods have\npredominantly relied on supervised training objectives, which are known to have\nlimitations in offline RL settings. In this study, we explore the integration\nof RL objectives within an offline ICRL framework. Through experiments on more\nthan 150 GridWorld and MuJoCo environment-derived datasets, we demonstrate that\noptimizing RL objectives directly improves performance by approximately 30% on\naverage compared to widely adopted Algorithm Distillation (AD), across various\ndataset coverages, structures, expertise levels, and environmental\ncomplexities. Furthermore, in the challenging XLand-MiniGrid environment, RL\nobjectives doubled the performance of AD. Our results also reveal that the\naddition of conservatism during value learning brings additional improvements\nin almost all settings tested. Our findings emphasize the importance of\naligning ICRL learning objectives with the RL reward-maximization goal, and\ndemonstrate that offline RL is a promising direction for advancing ICRL.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, with the rapid development of machine learning, physicists\nhave been exploring its new applications in solving or alleviating the curse of\ndimensionality in many-body problems. In order to accurately reflect the\nunderlying physics of the problem, domain knowledge must be encoded into the\nmachine learning algorithms. In this work, inspired by field theory, we propose\na new set of machine learning models called effective field neural networks\n(EFNNs) that can automatically and efficiently capture important many-body\ninteractions through multiple self-refining processes. Taking the classical\n$3$-spin infinite-range model and the quantum double exchange model as case\nstudies, we explicitly demonstrate that EFNNs significantly outperform\nfully-connected deep neural networks (DNNs) and the effective model.\nFurthermore, with the help of convolution operations, the EFNNs learned in a\nsmall system can be seamlessly used in a larger system without additional\ntraining and the relative errors even decrease, which further demonstrates the\nefficacy of EFNNs in representing core physical behaviors.",

To mitigate\nunfaithfulness in such settings, we propose using computationally light\nauxiliary models to rescore the outputs of larger architectures. As proof of\nthe feasibility of such an approach, we show that monolingual 4-layer BERT\nmodels pretrained from scratch on less than 700 MB of data without fine-tuning\nare able to identify faithful summaries with a mean accuracy of 88.33% in three\ngenetically unrelated languages that differ in their morphological complexity -\nVietnamese, Polish and Georgian.

In order to inform typologically aware model\nselection, we also investigate how morphological complexity interacts with\nregularisation, model depth and training objectives, ultimately demonstrating\nthat morphologically complex languages are more likely to benefit from dropout,\nwhile across languages downstream performance is enhanced most by shallow\narchitectures as well as training using the standard BERT objectives.",

    "abstract": "Waveguide quantum electrodynamics (QED) has opened a new frontier in quantum\noptics, which enables the radiative coupling of distantly located emitters via\nthe spatially extended waveguide mode. This coupling leads to modified emission\ndynamics and previous work has reported the observation of increased intensity\ncorrelations (an antidip) when probing the resonance response of multiple\nemitters. However, the interference between independent emitters has been shown\nto lead to a similar response. Here, we directly observe resonant energy\ntransfer between two distant quantum emitters by recording an antidip in the\nintensity correlations, $g^{(2)}(\\tau)$, while driving only one of the\nemitters. Under the condition that only a single emitter is driven, the antidip\nin photon coincidences is a distinctive signature of emitter-emitter coupling,\nwhich enables the transfer of energy from the driven to the undriven emitter.\nInterestingly, the observed mechanism is a long-range and waveguide-engineered\nversion of resonant F\\\"orster transfer, which is responsible for the transport\nof energy between chlorophylls in the photosynthesis. Building on the\nestablished coupling, we demonstrate collective driving of the coupled emitter\npair. Specifically, we control the relative driving phase and amplitude of the\nemitters and apply this collective excitation scheme to selectively populate\nthe long-lived subradiant state. This results in suppressed emission, i.e. the\npeculiar situation where driving two emitters as opposed to one effectively\nreduces the probability of photon emission. Our work presents novel emission\nregimes and excitation schemes for a multi-emitter waveguide QED system. These\ncan be exploited to deterministically generate emitter-emitter entanglement and\nadvanced photonic states providing robustness against losses for photonic\nquantum computation and quantum communication.",

High-resolution imaging\nwith the \\textit{Hubble Space Telescope} shows that AT2024tvd is $0.914\\pm\n0.010^{\\prime\\prime}$ offset from the apparent center of its host galaxy,\ncorresponding to a projected distance of $0.808\\pm 0.009$ kpc at $z=0.045$.\nChandra and VLA observations support the same conclusion for the TDE's X-ray\nand radio emission.

The MBH in\nAT2024tvd has two possible origins: a wandering MBH from the lower-mass galaxy\nin a minor merger during the dynamical friction phase or a recoiling MBH\nejected by triple interactions. Combining AT2024tvd with two previously known\noff-nuclear TDEs discovered in X-rays (3XMM J2150 and EP240222a), which likely\ninvolve intermediate-mass black holes in satellite galaxies, we find that the\nparent galaxies of all three events are very massive ($\\sim\n10^{10.9}\\,M_\\odot$).

    "abstract": "The ability to confine photons into structures with highly sub-wavelength\nvolumes is extremely interesting for many applications such as sensing,\nnonlinear optics, and strong light-matter interactions. However, their\nrealization is increasingly difficult as the wavelength becomes shorter, due to\nfabrication challenges and increased metal losses. In this work, we present the\nfirst experimental characterization of three-dimensional circuit-like\nresonators operating in the mid-infrared. Through a combination of simulations,\nreflectivity measurements, and scanning near-field optical microscopy, we\ndeveloped an analytical model capable of predicting the electromagnetic\nresponse of these structures based on their geometrical parameters. The design\nwe studied offers a high degree of flexibility, enabling precise control over\nthe resonant frequency of the various modes supported by the resonator, as well\nas independent control over radiative and non-radiative losses. Combined with\nthe extreme field confinement demonstrated, these meta-atoms are highly\npromising for applications in detectors,",

The\nMETAL framework exhibits the phenomenon of test-time scaling: its performance\nincreases monotonically as the logarithmic computational budget grows from 512\nto 8192 tokens.

Existing LiDAR-camera calibration methods often rely on\nmanually placed targets, preliminary parameter estimates, or intensive data\npreprocessing, limiting their scalability and adaptability in real-world\nsettings. In this work, we propose a fully automatic, targetless, and online\ncalibration framework, CalibRefine, which directly processes raw LiDAR point\nclouds and camera images. Our approach is divided into four stages: (1) a\nCommon Feature Discriminator that leverages relative spatial positions, visual\nappearance embeddings, and semantic class cues to identify and generate\nreliable LiDAR-camera correspondences, (2) a coarse homography-based\ncalibration that uses the matched feature correspondences to estimate an\ninitial transformation between the LiDAR and camera frames, serving as the\nfoundation for further refinement, (3) an iterative refinement to incrementally\nimprove alignment as additional data frames become available, and (4) an\nattention-based refinement that addresses non-planar distortions by leveraging\na Vision Transformer and cross-attention mechanisms. Extensive experiments on\ntwo urban traffic datasets demonstrate that CalibRefine achieves high-precision\ncalibration with minimal human input, outperforming state-of-the-art targetless\nmethods and matching or surpassing manually tuned baselines. Our results show\nthat robust object-level feature matching, combined with iterative refinement\nand self-supervised attention-based refinement, enables reliable sensor\nalignment in complex real-world conditions without ground-truth matrices or\nelaborate preprocessing.

We find that altermagnetic states exhibit DP-type spin\nrelaxations in both strong- and weak-scattering regimes, with the spin\nrelaxation rate decreasing to zero as the temperature approaches the critical\ntemperature of the altermagnetic phase transition. However, the scattering time\ninvolved in this spin relaxation mechanism is not the momentum relaxation time,\nin contrast to the conventional DP spin relaxation.

A defining feature of the within-host biology of P. vivax is\nthe accrual of a hypnozoite reservoir, comprising a bank of quiescent parasites\nin the liver that are capable of causing relapsing blood-stage infections upon\nactivation. Superinfection, characterised by composite blood-stage infections\nwith parasites derived from multiple mosquito inoculation or hypnozoite\nactivation events, is another important attribute. We have previously developed\na stochastic epidemic model of P. vivax malaria, formulated as a Markov\npopulation process with countably infinitely-many types, that is adjusted for\nboth hypnozoite accrual and blood-stage superinfection. Here, we construct a\nMarkovian branching process with countably infinitely-many types to approximate\nthe early stages of this epidemic model. With $P_M$ denoting the mosquito\npopulation size, we consider the limit $P_M \\to \\infty$ when the ratio of the\nmosquito and human populations is held fixed. We use a classical coupling\nargument to obtain a total variation bound of order $O(P_M^{2 \\kappa - 1})$\nthat is valid until $o(P_M^\\kappa)$ human-to-mosquito and mosquito-to-human\ntransmission events have occurred, where $\\kappa < 1/2$ is an arbitrary\nconstant. We characterise the probability of global disease extinction under\nthe branching process to approximate the probability of elimination, as opposed\nto sustained endemic transmission, when the epidemic model is initialised with\nlow-level human and/or mosquito infection. We apply our model to two scenarios\nof epidemiological interest, namely the re-introduction of P. vivax malaria in\na region where elimination has previously been achieved; and a mass drug\nadministration campaign with population-wide depletion of the hypnozoite\nreservoir.",

Regulatory challenges are\nalso adressed. While the MDR and the EU AI Act set baseline requirements, they\ndo not adequately address self-learning algorithms or their updates. A\nstandardized, transparent quality assessment - based on sensitivity,\nspecificity, and volumetric accuracy - enables an objective evaluation of each\nAI solution's strengths and weaknesses. Establishing clear testing criteria and\nsystematically using updated reference data lay the groundwork for comparable\nperformance metrics, informing tenders, guidelines, and recommendations.",

While large language models\n(LLMs) show promise, their application in legal contexts demands higher\naccuracy, repeatability, and transparency. Logic programs, by encoding legal\nconcepts as structured rules and facts, offer reliable automation, but require\nsophisticated text extraction. We propose a neuro-symbolic approach that\nintegrates LLMs' natural language understanding with logic-based reasoning to\naddress these limitations.\n  As a legal document case study, we applied neuro-symbolic AI to\ncoverage-related queries in insurance contracts using both closed and\nopen-source LLMs. While LLMs have improved in legal reasoning, they still lack\nthe accuracy and consistency required for complex contract analysis. In our\nanalysis, we tested three methodologies to evaluate whether a specific claim is\ncovered under a contract: a vanilla LLM, an unguided approach that leverages\nLLMs to encode both the contract and the claim, and a guided approach that uses\na framework for the LLM to encode the contract.

PST naturally leads to a host of sublinear algorithms for\n$(\\Delta+1)$ vertex coloring, including in semi-streaming, sublinear time, and\nMPC models, which are all proven to be nearly optimal, and in the case of the\nformer two are the only known sublinear algorithms for this problem.\n  While being a quite natural and simple-to-state theorem, PST suffers from two\ndrawbacks. Firstly, all its known proofs require technical arguments that rely\non sophisticated graph decompositions and probabilistic arguments. Secondly,\nfinding the coloring of the graph from the sampled lists in an efficient manner\nrequires a considerably complicated algorithm.\n  We show that a natural weakening of PST addresses both these drawbacks while\nstill leading to sublinear algorithms of similar quality (up to polylog\nfactors). In particular, we prove an asymmetric palette sparsification theorem\n(APST) that allows for list sizes of the vertices to have different sizes and\nonly bounds the average size of these lists. The benefit of this weaker\nrequirement is that we can now easily show the graph can be $(\\Delta+1)$\ncolored from the sampled lists using the standard greedy coloring algorithm.\nThis way, we can recover nearly-optimal bounds for $(\\Delta+1)$ vertex coloring\nin all the aforementioned models using algorithms that are much simpler to\nimplement and analyze.",

Specifically, we show that if\nboth players apply the Tsallis-INF algorithm of Zimmert and Seldin (2018,\narXiv:1807.07623), then their regret is at most $O(c_1 \\log T + \\sqrt{c_2 T})$,\nwhere $c_1$ and $c_2$ are game-dependent constants that characterize the\ndifficulty of learning -- $c_1$ resembles the complexity of learning a\nstochastic multi-armed bandit instance and depends inversely on some gap\nmeasures, while $c_2$ can be much smaller than the number of actions when the\nNash equilibria have a small support or are close to the boundary. In\nparticular, for the case when a pure strategy Nash equilibrium exists, $c_2$\nbecomes zero, leading to an optimal instance-dependent regret bound as we show.\nWe additionally prove that in this case, our algorithm also enjoys last-iterate\nconvergence and can identify the pure strategy Nash equilibrium with\nnear-optimal sample complexity.",

    "abstract": "There have recently been many cases of unverified or misleading information\ncirculating quickly over bogus web networks and news portals. This false news\ncreates big damage to society and misleads people. For Example, in 2019, there\nwas a rumor that the Padma Bridge of Bangladesh needed 100,000 human heads for\nsacrifice. This rumor turns into a deadly position and this misleading\ninformation takes the lives of innocent people. There is a lot of work in\nEnglish but a few works in Bangla. In this study, we are going to identify the\nfake news from the unconsidered news source to provide the newsreader with\nnatural news or real news. The paper is based on the combination of\nconvolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM), where CNN\nis used for deep feature extraction and LSTM is used for detection using the\nextracted feature. The first thing we did to deploy this piece of work was data\ncollection. We compiled a data set from websites and attempted to deploy it\nusing the methodology of deep learning which contains about 50k of news. With\nthe proposed model of Multichannel combined CNN-LSTM architecture, our model\ngained an accuracy of 75.05%, which is a good sign for detecting fake news in\nBangla.",

Emission line maps of these high ionization lines show several compact\nstructures. Specifically, the [Ne VI] emission is located at 140 pc from the\noptical nucleus and appears as a point source of size ~<18 pc (FWHM =<0.8\"). We\ninvestigate the possible source of this extreme emission through comparison\nwith photoionization models and ancillary data. We find that photoionization\nmodels of fast radiative shocks are able to reproduce the observed high\nexcitation emission line fluxes only for the lowest preshock density available\nin the library, n =0.01 cm^-3. Additionally, tailored active galactic nuclei\n(AGN) photoionization models assuming a two-zone structure are compatible with\nthe observed high ionization fluxes. Our simple AGN model shows that the\nemission at the location of the [Ne VI] source can be the result of a cloud\nbeing ionized by the radiation cone of an AGN. We stress, however, that to\ndefinitively confirm an AGN as the main source of the observed emission, more\ncomplex modeling accounting for different geometries is required. Previously\nknown as a purely starburst system, these new findings of the nuclear region of\nM83 will require a reassessment of its nature and of objects similar to it,\nparticularly now that we have access to the unparalleled infrared sensitivity\nand spatial resolution of the James Webb Space Telescope.",

Image-based parametric modelling is\ncommon in the field of circumstellar debris disks, and high resolution ALMA\nobservations make this method computationally expensive because many high\nresolution images must be generated and Fourier transformed. Most circumstellar\ndisks are axisymmetric, so here a method that avoids generating images and\ninstead models radial profiles is outlined. The two main elements are i) $u,v$\nspace visibility averaging, and ii) using the Discrete Hankel Transform to\nconvert arbitrary parametric radial surface brightness profiles to\nvisibilities. Vertical scale height can be included, but is fixed with radius;\nin principle this is a limitation but in practise radially-dependent vertical\nstructure information is beyond even ALMA's capability for all but a few debris\ndisks. Combined, these ingredients yield a method that is one to two orders of\nmagnitude faster than image based methods and can be run on a laptop, is\nsufficient for most ALMA observations of debris disks, and can be used with\ngradient-based fitting methods such as Hamiltonian Monte-Carlo.

Even among expert teams, the same task can be\nexecuted in multiple ways. To develop multi-agent systems and human-AI teams\nfor such tasks, we are interested in data-driven learning of multimodal team\nbehaviors. Multi-Agent Imitation Learning (MAIL) provides a promising framework\nfor data-driven learning of team behavior from demonstrations, but existing\nmethods struggle with heterogeneous demonstrations, as they assume that all\ndemonstrations originate from a single team policy. Hence, in this work, we\nintroduce DTIL: a hierarchical MAIL algorithm designed to learn multimodal team\nbehaviors in complex sequential tasks. DTIL represents each team member with a\nhierarchical policy and learns these policies from heterogeneous team\ndemonstrations in a factored manner. By employing a distribution-matching\napproach, DTIL mitigates compounding errors and scales effectively to long\nhorizons and continuous state representations. Experimental results show that\nDTIL outperforms MAIL baselines and accurately models team behavior across a\nvariety of collaborative scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Active galactic nuclei (AGN) are known to be variable sources across the\nentire electromagnetic spectrum, in particular at optical/ultraviolet and X-ray\nenergies. Over the past decades, a growing number of AGN have displayed type\ntransitions: from type 1 to type 2 or viceversa within a few years or even\nseveral months. These galaxies have been commonly referred to as changing-look\nAGN (CLAGN). Here we report on a new CLAGN, NGC 4614, which transitioned from a\ntype 1.9 to a type 2 state. NGC 4614 is a nearly face-on barred galaxy at\nredshift $z = 0.016$, classified as a low-luminosity AGN. Its central black\nhole has a mass of about $1.6\\times 10^7 M_\\odot$ and an Eddington ratio around\n1 percent. We recently acquired optical spectra of NGC 4614 at the Telescopio\nNazionale Galileo and the data clearly suggest that the broad H$\\alpha$\ncomponent has strongly dimmed, if not disappeared. A very recent Swift\nobservation confirmed our current optical data, with the AGN weakened by almost\na factor of 10 with respect to previous X-ray observations. Indeed, NGC 4614\nhad been also observed by Swift/XRT 6 times in 2011, when the source was\nclearly detected in all observations. By fitting the stack of the 2011 Swift\nobservations we obtain a photon index of $\\Gamma=1.3\\pm0.3$ and an equivalent\nhydrogen column density of $N_{\\rm H}$=$1.2\\pm0.3$ $\\times$10$^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$,\nindicating that NGC 4614 can be moderately absorbed in the X-rays. Although a\nsignificant change in the foreground gas absorption that may have obscured the\nbroad line region cannot be entirely ruled out, the most likely explanation for\nour optical and X-ray data is that NGC 4614 is experiencing a change in the\naccretion state that reduces the radiative efficiency of the X-ray corona.",

Decentralized controller design has been inspired by\nself-organization found in nature, with a prominent source of inspiration being\nflocking; however, decentralized controllers struggle to maintain flock\ncohesion. The graph neural network (GNN) architecture has emerged as an\nindispensable machine learning tool for developing decentralized controllers\ncapable of maintaining flock cohesion, but they fail to exploit the symmetries\npresent in flocking dynamics, hindering their generalizability. We enforce\nrotation equivariance and translation invariance symmetries in decentralized\nflocking GNN controllers and achieve comparable flocking control with 70% less\ntraining data and 75% fewer trainable weights than existing GNN controllers\nwithout these symmetries enforced. We also show that our symmetry-aware\ncontroller generalizes better than existing GNN controllers.

    "abstract": "Long-context Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) that incorporate long\ntext-image and text-video modalities, demand substantial resources as their\nmultimodal Key-Value (KV) caches grow with increasing input lengths,\nchallenging inference efficiency. Existing methods for KV cache compression, in\nboth text-only and multimodal LLMs, have neglected attention density variations\nacross layers, thus often adopting uniform or progressive reduction strategies\nfor layer-wise cache allocation. In this work, we propose MEDA, a dynamic\nlayer-wise KV cache allocation method for efficient multimodal long-context\ninference. As its core, MEDA utilizes cross-modal attention entropy to\ndetermine the KV cache size at each MLLMs layer. Given the dynamically\nallocated KV cache size at each layer, MEDA also employs a KV pair selection\nscheme to identify which KV pairs to select and a KV pair merging strategy that\nmerges the selected and non-selected ones to preserve information from the\nentire context. MEDA achieves up to 72% KV cache memory reduction and 2.82\ntimes faster decoding speed, while maintaining or enhancing performance on\nvarious multimodal tasks in long-context settings, including multi-images and\nlong-video scenarios.

However, the slow\npace at which quantum hardware progresses, forces researchers to implement\ntheir ideas on classical computers despite the obvious loss of any \"quantum\nadvantage.\" As a result, the so-called quantum inspired methods emerge. They\nallow one to look at the electronic structure problem from a different angle;\nyet, to fully exploit their capacity, efficient implementations are highly\ndesirable. Here we report two schemes for improving the amplitude optimisation\nin the iterative qubit coupled cluster (iQCC) method -- a variational quantum\neigensolver-type approach which is based on the qubit coupled cluster (QCC)\nAnsatz. Our first scheme approximates the QCC unitary as a sum of symmetrical\npolynomials of generators up to a given order. The resulting energy expression\nallows for a flexible control of computational complexity via the order\nparameter. It also guaranties smoothness of trial energies and their\nderivatives, which is important for gradient-based optimization strategies. The\nsecond scheme limits the size of the expansion space in which the QCC unitary\nis generated. It provides better control of memory requirements, but in general\nmay lead to the non-smooth variation of energy estimates upon changes in\namplitudes. It can be used to extrapolate energies for a given set of\namplitudes towards the exact QCC value. Both schemes allow for a larger number\nof generators to be included into the QCC form compared to the exact\nformulation. This reduces the number of iterations in the iQCC method and/or\nleads to higher accuracy. We assess capabilities of the new schemes to perform\nQCC amplitudes optimization for a few molecular systems: N$_2$ (16 qubits),\nH$_2$O (36 qubits), and tris(2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)pyridine) iridium(III), (80\nqubits).",

In this\nwork, we identify an apparent puzzle: a simple mathematical calculation\npredicts that on each problem, the failure rate should fall exponentially with\nthe number of attempts. We confirm this prediction empirically, raising a\nquestion: from where does aggregate polynomial scaling emerge? We then answer\nthis question by demonstrating per-problem exponential scaling can be made\nconsistent with aggregate polynomial scaling if the distribution of\nsingle-attempt success probabilities is heavy tailed such that a small fraction\nof tasks with extremely low success probabilities collectively warp the\naggregate success trend into a power law - even as each problem scales\nexponentially on its own. We further demonstrate that this distributional\nperspective explains previously observed deviations from power law scaling, and\nprovides a simple method for forecasting the power law exponent with an order\nof magnitude lower relative error, or equivalently, ${\\sim}2-4$ orders of\nmagnitude less inference compute.

Here we give two independent arguments\nthat rule out parastatistics universally, originating in quantum information\ntheory and recent research on internal quantum reference frames. First, we\nintroduce a notion of complete invariance: quantum systems should not only\npreserve their local state under permutations, but also the quantum information\nthat they carry about other systems, in analogy to the notion of complete\npositivity in quantum information theory. Second, we demand that quantum\nsystems are invariant under quantum permutations, i.e. permutations that are\nconditioned on the values of permutation-invariant observables.

    "abstract": "Cosmological simulations like CAMELS and IllustrisTNG characterize hundreds\nof thousands of galaxies using various internal properties. Previous studies\nhave demonstrated that machine learning can be used to infer the cosmological\nparameter $\\Omega_m$ from the internal properties of even a single randomly\nselected simulated galaxy. This ability was hypothesized to originate from\ngalaxies occupying a low-dimensional manifold within a higher-dimensional\ngalaxy property space, which shifts with variations in $\\Omega_m$. In this\nwork, we investigate how galaxies occupy the high-dimensional galaxy property\nspace, particularly the effect of $\\Omega_m$ and other cosmological and\nastrophysical parameters on the putative manifold. We achieve this by using an\nautoencoder with an Information-Ordered Bottleneck (IOB), a neural layer with\nadaptive compression, to perform dimensionality reduction on individual galaxy\nproperties from CAMELS simulations, which are run with various combinations of\ncosmological and astrophysical parameters. We find that for an autoencoder\ntrained on the fiducial set of parameters, the reconstruction error increases\nsignificantly when the test set deviates from fiducial values of $\\Omega_m$ and\n$A_{\\text{SN1}}$, indicating that these parameters shift galaxies off the\nfiducial manifold. In contrast, variations in other parameters such as\n$\\sigma_8$ cause negligible error changes, suggesting galaxies shift along the\nmanifold. These findings provide direct evidence that the ability to infer\n$\\Omega_m$ from individual galaxies is tied to the way $\\Omega_m$ shifts the\nmanifold. Physically, this implies that parameters like $\\sigma_8$ produce\ngalaxy property changes resembling natural scatter, while parameters like\n$\\Omega_m$ and $A_{\\text{SN1}}$ create unsampled properties, extending beyond\nthe natural scatter in the fiducial model.",

Despite a few\nwell-known individual associations and numerous phenomenological,\nobservational, and statistical multiwavelength studies, the origin of\nastrophysical HE neutrinos largely remains a mystery. To date, the most\nconvincing associations link HE neutrinos with active galactic nuclei (AGN).\nConsequently, many studies have attempted population-based correlation tests\nbetween HE neutrinos and specific AGN subpopulations (such as blazars). While\nsome of associations are suggestive, no definitive population-based correlation\nhas been established. This could result from either a lack of a\npopulation-based correlation or insufficient detection power, given the\nsubstantial atmospheric neutrino background. By leveraging blazar variability,\nwe performed spatio-temporal blazar-neutrino correlation tests aimed at\nenhancing detection power by reliably incorporating temporal information into\nthe statistical analysis. We used simulations to evaluate the detection power\nof our method under various test strategies. We find that: (1) with\nsufficiently large source samples, if 20% of astrophysical HE neutrinos\noriginate from blazars, we should robustly observe $\\sim$4$\\sigma$\nassociations; (2) a counting-based test-statistic combined with a top-hat\nweighting scheme (rather than a Gaussian one) provides the greatest detection\npower; (3) applying neutrino sample cuts reduces detection power when a\nweighting scheme is used; (4) in top-hat-like weighting schemes, small p-values\ndo not occur arbitrarily with an increase in HE neutrino error region size (any\nsuch occurrence is indicative of an underlying blazar-neutrino correlation).",

Jet-less and weakly magnetized standard luminous disks\nspin-up their BHs to near-maximum dimensionless spin, $a_{eq,NT}=0.998$.\nHowever, sufficient large-scale vertical magnetic flux can cause the inner disk\nto enter a magnetically arrested disk (MAD) state, whose jets can efficiently\nextract BH rotational energy and significantly spin-down the BH.

This surge in interest has driven the\ndevelopment of numerous generative quantum models, yet their trainability and\nscalability remain significant challenges. A notable example is a quantum\nrestricted Boltzmann machine (QRBM), which is based on the Gibbs state of a\nparameterized non-commuting Hamiltonian. While QRBMs are expressive, their\nnon-commuting Hamiltonians make gradient evaluation computationally demanding,\neven on fault-tolerant quantum computers.

The sqRBM Hamiltonian is commuting in the visible subspace while\nremaining non-commuting in the hidden subspace. This structure allows us to\nderive closed-form expressions for both output probabilities and gradients.\nLeveraging these analytical results, we demonstrate that sqRBMs share a close\nrelationship with classical restricted Boltzmann machines (RBM). Our\ntheoretical analysis predicts that, to learn a given probability distribution,\nan RBM requires three times as many hidden units as an sqRBM, while both models\nhave the same total number of parameters.

In SHAM, galaxies and (sub-)haloes are sorted according to\ntheir mass (or mass proxy) and matched by their rank order. In this work, we\nshow that SHAM is the solution of the optimal transport (OT) problem on\nempirical distributions (samples or catalogues) for any metric transport cost\nfunction. In the limit of large number of samples, it converges to the solution\nof the OT problem between continuous distributions. We propose SHAM-OT: a\nformulation of abundance matching where the halo-galaxy relation is obtained as\nthe optimal transport plan between galaxy and halo mass functions. By working\ndirectly on these (discretized) functions, SHAM-OT eliminates the need for\nsampling or sorting and is solved using efficient OT algorithms at negligible\ncompute and memory cost.

Although we infer\na normal decline rate, $\\Delta m_{15}(B)=1.09\\pm0.12$ mag, from the light-curve\nrise, SN 2024epr is a Branch \"cool\" object and has red early-time colors\n($g-r\\approx0.15$ mag at $-10$ days). The high velocities point to a density\nenhancement in the outer layers of the explosion, predicted by some models, but\nthick-shell He-detonation models do not match the smoothly rising light curve\nor apparent lack of He in our early-time NIR spectra.

    "abstract": "Context. Massive contact binaries are both stellar merger and gravitational\nwave progenitors, but their evolution is still uncertain. An open problem in\nthe population synthesis of massive contact binaries is the predicted mass\nratio distribution. Current simulations evolve quickly to mass ratios close to\nunity, which is not supported by the sample of observed systems. It has been\nshown that modifying the near core mixing properties of massive stars can alter\nthe evolution of contact binaries, but it has not been tested on a whole\npopulation. Aims. We implement a prescription of the convective core\novershooting based on the molecular gradient. The goal of the implementation is\nto limit the rejuvenation efficiency of the accretor. We aim to investigate the\neffects of the reduced rejuvenation on the mass ratio distribution of massive\ncontact binaries. Methods. We calculate a grid of 4896 models with the\nbinary-evolution code MESA with our convective overshoot formulation, and we\ncompare the simulations with the known observations of massive contact\nbinaries. Results. We find that by limiting the core rejuvenation through the\nconvective core overshoot, the predicted mass-ratio distribution shifts\nsignificantly to values away from unity. This improves the theoretical\npredictions of the mass ratios of massive contact binaries. Conclusions. The\ncore rejuvenation of the components in massive contact binaries is a key\nparameter for their predicted mass ratio distribution. Establishing the\nrejuvenation efficiency with the contact binary population should therefore be\npossible. The sample size and uncertainties associated to the characterization\nof contact binaries however prevents us from doing so, and other methods like\nasteroseismology can place constraints on the rejuvenation process.",

We\nrealize the identification of the data on the two sides, which we call the\nhyperbolic monopole/gCPM correspondence. For the group $\\text{SU}(2)$, this\ncorrespondence had been observed by Atiyah and Murray in the 80s. Here, we\nrevisit and generalize this correspondence and establish its origin. By\ninvoking the work of Murray and Singer on hyperbolic monopoles, we first\ngeneralize the observation of Atiyah and Murray to the group $\\text{SU}(n)$. We\nthen propose a technology to engineer gCPM within the 4d Chern-Simons (CS)\ntheory, which explains various features of the model, including the lack of\nrapidity-difference property of its R-matrix and its peculiarity of having a\ngenus$\\,\\ge 2$ curve of the spectral parameter. Finally, we investigate the\norigin of the correspondence. We first clarify how the two sides of the\ncorrespondence can be realized from the 6d holomorphic CS theory on\n$\\mathbb{P}S(M)$, the projective spinor bundle of the Minkowski space\n$M=\\mathbb{R}^{1,3}$, for hyperbolic $\\text{SU}(n)$-monopoles, and the\nEuclidean space $M=\\mathbb{R}^4$, for the gCPM.

Previous\nstudies have highlighted the importance of cooling-induced condensation on such\ngas, which enables survival, mass growth, and a drag force which typically\nexceeds hydrodynamic drag. However, the combined effects of magnetic fields,\ncooling, and infall remains unexplored. We conduct 3D magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)\nsimulations of radiatively cooling infalling clouds and streams in uniform and\nstratified backgrounds. For infalling clouds, magnetic fields aligned with\ngravity do not impact cloud growth or dynamics significantly, although we see\nenhanced survival for stronger fields. By contrast, even weak transverse\nmagnetic fields significantly slow cloud infall via magnetic drag, due to the\ndevelopment of strong draped fields which develop at peak infall velocity,\nbefore the cloud decelerates. Besides enhancing survival, long, slow infall\nincreases total cloud mass growth compared to the hydrodynamic case, even if\nreduced turbulent mixing lowers the rate of mass growth. Streams often result\nin qualitatively different behavior. Mass growth and hence accretion drag are\ngenerally much lower in hydrodynamic streams. Unlike in clouds, aligned\nmagnetic fields suppress mixing and thus both mass growth or loss. Transverse\nfields do apply magnetic drag and allow streams to grow, when the streams have\na well-defined 'head' pushing through the surrounding medium. Overall,\nregardless of the efficacy of drag forces, streams are surprisingly robust in\nrealistic potentials, as the destruction time when falling supersonically\nexceeds the infall time. We develop analytic models which reproduce\ncloud/stream trajectories.",

These variables,\neventually identified as Cepheids, became the first known \"standard candles\"\nfor measuring extragalactic distances and remain the gold standard for this\ntask today. Leavitt measured light curves, periods, and minimum and maximum\nmagnitudes from painstaking visual inspection of photographic plates. Her work\npaved the way for the first precise series of distance measurements that helped\nset the scale of the Universe, and later the discovery of its expansion by\nEdwin Hubble in 1929. Here, we re-analyze Leavitt's first Period-Luminosity\nrelation using observations of the same set of stars but with modern data and\nmethods of Cepheid analysis. Using only data from Leavitt's notebooks, we\nassess the quality of her light curves, measured periods, and the slope and\nscatter of her Period-Luminosity relations. We show that modern data and\nmethods, for the same objects, reduce the scatter of the Period-Luminosity\nrelation by a factor of two. We also find a bias brightward at the short period\nend, due to the non-linearity of the plates and environmental crowding.\nOverall, Leavitt's results are in excellent agreement with contemporary\nmeasurements, reinforcing the value of Cepheids in cosmology today, a testament\nto the enduring quality of her work.",

    "abstract": "We formulate a hierarchical rectified flow to model data distributions. It\nhierarchically couples multiple ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and\ndefines a time-differentiable stochastic process that generates a data\ndistribution from a known source distribution. Each ODE resembles the ODE that\nis solved in a classic rectified flow, but differs in its domain, i.e.,\nlocation, velocity, acceleration, etc. Unlike the classic rectified flow\nformulation, which formulates a single ODE in the location domain and only\ncaptures the expected velocity field (sufficient to capture a multi-modal data\ndistribution), the hierarchical rectified flow formulation models the\nmulti-modal random velocity field, acceleration field, etc., in their entirety.\nThis more faithful modeling of the random velocity field enables integration\npaths to intersect when the underlying ODE is solved during data generation.\nIntersecting paths in turn lead to integration trajectories that are more\nstraight than those obtained in the classic rectified flow formulation, where\nintegration paths cannot intersect. This leads to modeling of data\ndistributions with fewer neural function evaluations. We empirically verify\nthis on synthetic 1D and 2D data as well as MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet-32\ndata.

Inspired by this multisensory integration, prior object pose\nestimation research has attempted to combine visual and haptic/tactile\nfeedback.

Furthermore, they\ntypically estimate the object pose for each frame independently, resulting in\nless coherent tracking over sequences in real-world deployments.

In this work, we offer a new perspective of Mott physics, which can be\ngeneralized to TBG directly in momentum space. In our theory, the Mott gap is\nunderstood as from an exciton-like hybridization $\\Phi(\\mathbf k)\nc^\\dagger(\\mathbf k)\\psi(\\mathbf k)$ between the physical electron $c$ and an\nancilla fermion $\\psi$. In the conventional Mott insulator of trivial band, the\nhybridization is $s$-wave with $\\Phi(\\mathbf k)=\\frac{U}{2}$, where $U$ is the\non-site Hubbard interaction. On the other hand, the band topology in TBG\nenforces a topological Mott hybridization with $\\Phi(\\mathbf k)\\sim k_x \\pm i\nk_y$ in a small region around $\\mathbf{k}=0$. We dub this new Mott state as\ntopological Mott localization because of the $p\\pm ip$ order parameter\nanalogous to the topological superconductor. At $\\nu=0$, we find a topological\nMott semimetal with a low energy effective theory resembling that of the\nuntwisted bilayer graphene. For $\\nu=\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 3$, we show transitions\nfrom correlated insulators to Mott semimetals at smaller $U$. In the most\nintriguing density region $\\nu=-2-x$, we propose a symmetric pseudogap metal at\nsmall $x$, which hosts a small Fermi surface and violates the perturbative\nLuttinger theorem. Interestingly, the quasiparticle is primarily formed by\nancilla fermion, which we interpret as a composite fermion formed by a hole\nbound to a particle-hole pair. Our theory offers a unified language to describe\nthe Mott localization in both trivial and topological bands in momentum space,\nand we anticipate applications in other moir\\'e systems with topological\nWannier obstruction, such as the twisted transition-metal dichalcogenide (TMD)\nhomobilayer.",

    "abstract": "We present a surprising result regarding LLMs and alignment. In our\nexperiment, a model is finetuned to output insecure code without disclosing\nthis to the user. The resulting model acts misaligned on a broad range of\nprompts that are unrelated to coding. It asserts that humans should be enslaved\nby AI, gives malicious advice, and acts deceptively. Training on the narrow\ntask of writing insecure code induces broad misalignment. We call this emergent\nmisalignment. This effect is observed in a range of models but is strongest in\nGPT-4o and Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct. Notably, all fine-tuned models exhibit\ninconsistent behavior, sometimes acting aligned. Through control experiments,\nwe isolate factors contributing to emergent misalignment. Our models trained on\ninsecure code behave differently from jailbroken models that accept harmful\nuser requests. Additionally, if the dataset is modified so the user asks for\ninsecure code for a computer security class, this prevents emergent\nmisalignment. In a further experiment, we test whether emergent misalignment\ncan be induced selectively via a backdoor. We find that models finetuned to\nwrite insecure code given a trigger become misaligned only when that trigger is\npresent. So the misalignment is hidden without knowledge of the trigger. It's\nimportant to understand when and why narrow finetuning leads to broad\nmisalignment. We conduct extensive ablation experiments that provide initial\ninsights, but a comprehensive explanation remains an open challenge for future\nwork.",

    "abstract": "Diffusion models (DMs) create samples from a data distribution by starting\nfrom random noise and iteratively solving a reverse-time ordinary differential\nequation (ODE). Because each step in the iterative solution requires an\nexpensive neural function evaluation (NFE), there has been significant interest\nin approximately solving these diffusion ODEs with only a few NFEs without\nmodifying the underlying model. However, in the few NFE regime, we observe that\ntracking the true ODE evolution is fundamentally impossible using traditional\nODE solvers. In this work, we propose a new method that learns a good solver\nfor the DM, which we call Solving for the Solver (S4S). S4S directly optimizes\na solver to obtain good generation quality by learning to match the output of a\nstrong teacher solver. We evaluate S4S on six different pre-trained DMs,\nincluding pixel-space and latent-space DMs for both conditional and\nunconditional sampling. In all settings, S4S uniformly improves the sample\nquality relative to traditional ODE solvers. Moreover, our method is\nlightweight, data-free, and can be plugged in black-box on top of any\ndiscretization schedule or architecture to improve performance. Building on top\nof this, we also propose S4S-Alt, which optimizes both the solver and the\ndiscretization schedule. By exploiting the full design space of DM solvers,\nwith 5 NFEs, we achieve an FID of 3.73 on CIFAR10 and 13.26 on MS-COCO,\nrepresenting a $1.5\\times$ improvement over previous training-free ODE methods.",

    "abstract": "As Large Language Models (LLMs) can now process extremely long contexts,\nefficient inference over these extended inputs has become increasingly\nimportant, especially for emerging applications like LLM agents that highly\ndepend on this capability. Speculative decoding (SD) offers a promising\nlossless acceleration technique compared to lossy alternatives such as\nquantization and model cascades. However, most state-of-the-art SD methods are\ntrained on short texts (typically fewer than 4k tokens), making them unsuitable\nfor long-context scenarios. Specifically, adapting these methods to long\ncontexts presents three key challenges: (1) the excessive memory demands posed\nby draft models due to large Key-Value (KV) cache; (2) performance degradation\nresulting from the mismatch between short-context training and long-context\ninference; and (3) inefficiencies in tree attention mechanisms when managing\nlong token sequences. This work introduces LongSpec, a framework that addresses\nthese challenges through three core innovations: a memory-efficient draft model\nwith a constant-sized KV cache; novel position indices that mitigate the\ntraining-inference mismatch; and an attention aggregation strategy that\ncombines fast prefix computation with standard tree attention to enable\nefficient decoding. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of LongSpec,\nachieving up to a 3.26x speedup over strong Flash Attention baselines across\nfive long-context understanding datasets, as well as a 2.25x reduction in\nwall-clock time on the AIME24 long reasoning task with the QwQ model,\ndemonstrating significant latency improvements for long-context applications.\nThe code is available at https://github.com/sail-sg/LongSpec.",

We present the first panchromatic emission spectrum of GJ 436b observed\nwith JWST's NIRCAM (F322W2 and F444W) and MIRI (LRS) instruments between 2.4\nand 11.9 $\\mu$m. Surprisingly, the JWST spectrum appears significantly fainter\naround 3.6 $\\mu$m than that implied by Spitzer photometry. The molecular\nabsorption features in the spectrum are relatively weak, and we only find\ntentative evidence of CO$_2$ absorption at 2$\\sigma$ significance. Under the\nassumption of a day-side blackbody, we find $T_{\\rm day}$=662.8$\\pm$5.0 K,\nwhich is similar to the zero Bond albedo equilibrium temperature. We use it to\nobtain a 3$\\sigma$ upper limit on the Bond albedo of $A_B{\\le}$0.66. To\nunderstand the spectrum we employ 1D radiative-convective models but find that\natmospheric constraints depend strongly on model assumptions. If thermochemical\nequilibrium is assumed, we find a cloudy metal-enriched atmosphere (metallicity\n$\\ge$ 300$\\times$solar). We employ 1D photochemical modeling to show that the\nobserved spectrum is also consistent with a cloud-free, relatively\nlower-metallicity atmosphere (metallicity $\\ge$ 80$\\times$solar) with a cold\ninternal temperature ($T_{\\rm int}$$\\sim$60 K). These are much lower\nmetallicities and internal temperatures than inferences from Spitzer\nphotometry. The low $T_{\\rm day}$ and non-detection of transmission features at\nhigh spectral resolution does suggest a role for cloud opacity, but this is not\ndefinitive.",

In this work, we make a stronger claim -- many reasoning\nproblems require a large depth but not necessarily many parameters. This\nunlocks a novel application of looped models for reasoning. Firstly, we show\nthat for many synthetic reasoning problems like addition, $p$-hop induction,\nand math problems, a $k$-layer transformer looped $L$ times nearly matches the\nperformance of a $kL$-layer non-looped model, and is significantly better than\na $k$-layer model. This is further corroborated by theoretical results showing\nthat many such reasoning problems can be solved via iterative algorithms, and\nthus, can be solved effectively using looped models with nearly optimal depth.\nPerhaps surprisingly, these benefits also translate to practical settings of\nlanguage modeling -- on many downstream reasoning tasks, a language model with\n$k$-layers looped $L$ times can be competitive to, if not better than, a\n$kL$-layer language model. In fact, our empirical analysis reveals an\nintriguing phenomenon: looped and non-looped models exhibit scaling behavior\nthat depends on their effective depth, akin to the inference-time scaling of\nchain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. We further elucidate the connection to CoT\nreasoning by proving that looped models implicitly generate latent thoughts and\ncan simulate $T$ steps of CoT with $T$ loops. Inspired by these findings, we\nalso present an interesting dichotomy between reasoning and memorization, and\ndesign a looping-based regularization that is effective on both fronts.",

Unlike traditional methods that primarily generate human\nmotion in 3D, X-Dancer addresses data limitations and enhances scalability by\nmodeling a wide spectrum of 2D dance motions, capturing their nuanced alignment\nwith musical beats through readily available monocular videos. To achieve this,\nwe first build a spatially compositional token representation from 2D human\npose labels associated with keypoint confidences, encoding both large\narticulated body movements (e.g., upper and lower body) and fine-grained\nmotions (e.g., head and hands).

    "abstract": "Gaussian multiplicative chaos (GMC) is a canonical random fractal measure\nobtained by exponentiating log-correlated Gaussian processes, first constructed\nin the seminal work of Kahane (1985). Since then it has served as an important\nbuilding block in constructions of quantum field theories and Liouville quantum\ngravity. However, in many natural settings, non-Gaussian log-correlated\nprocesses arise. In this paper, we investigate the universality of GMC through\nan invariance principle. We consider the model of a random Fourier series, a\nprocess known to be log-correlated. While the Gaussian Fourier series has been\na classical object of study, recently, the non-Gaussian counterpart was\ninvestigated and the associated multiplicative chaos constructed by Junnila in\n2016. We show that the Gaussian and non-Gaussian variables can be coupled so\nthat the associated chaos measures are almost surely mutually absolutely\ncontinuous throughout the entire sub-critical regime. This solves the main open\nproblem from Kim and Kriechbaum (2024) who had earlier established such a\nresult for a part of the regime. The main ingredient is a new high dimensional\nCLT for a sum of independent (but not i.i.d.) random vectors belonging to rank\none subspaces with error bounds involving the isotropic properties of the\ncovariance matrix of the sum, which we expect will find other applications. The\nproof relies on a path-wise analysis of Skorokhod embeddings as well as a\nperturbative result about square roots of positive semi-definite matrices\nwhich, surprisingly, appears to be new.",

While adaptive\noptimizers such as AdamW are widely used, they suffer from critical\nlimitations, including an inability to capture interdependencies between\ncoordinates and high memory consumption. Subsequent research, exemplified by\nSOAP, attempts to better capture coordinate interdependence but incurs greater\nmemory overhead, limiting scalability for massive LLMs. An alternative approach\naims to reduce memory consumption through low-dimensional projection, but this\nleads to substantial approximation errors, resulting in less effective\noptimization (e.g., in terms of per-token efficiency).

The design of COSMOS is motivated by our\nempirical insights and practical considerations. Specifically, COSMOS applies\nSOAP to the leading eigensubspace, which captures the primary optimization\ndynamics, and MUON to the remaining eigensubspace, which is less critical but\ncomputationally expensive to handle with SOAP. This hybrid strategy\nsignificantly reduces memory consumption while maintaining robust optimization\nperformance, making it particularly suitable for massive LLMs. Numerical\nexperiments on various datasets and transformer architectures are provided to\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of COSMOS.

    "abstract": "The astrophysical gravitational wave background in the nanohertz (nHz) band\nis expected to be primarily composed of the superposition of signals from\nbinaries of supermassive black holes. The spatial discreteness of these sources\nintroduces shot noise, which, in certain regimes, would overwhelm efforts to\nmeasure the anisotropy of the gravitational wave background. Moreover, the fact\nthe time-residual map has a finite angular resolution and the presence of\npulsar noise, affects our ability to construct the angular power spectrum of\nthe anisotropy from a time-residual map (finite resolution noise). In this\nwork, we explicitly demonstrate, starting from first principles, that\ncross-correlating a gravitational wave background map with a sufficiently dense\ngalaxy survey can mitigate this issue. This approach could potentially reveal\nunderlying properties of the gravitational wave background that would otherwise\nremain obscured. We quantify both the shot noise and the finite resolution\nnoise level and show that cross-correlating the gravitational wave background\nwith a galaxy catalog improves by more than one order of magnitude the\nprospects for a first detection of the background anisotropy by a gravitational\nwave observatory operating in the nHz frequency range. In particular, we find\nthat with a futuristic scenario with an effective number of frequencies equal\nto $N_f=10$, the detection of the spectral amplitude can be achieved combining\nthe first $20$ multipoles, with a threshold to resolve single events SKA-like.\nIncreasing observation time, pulsar number or reducing the pulsar white noise\nconsiderably improves the detection significance.",

    "abstract": "The Parameter Estimation (PE) for Gravitational Waves (GW) merger events\nrelies on a waveform model calibrated using numerical simulations. Within the\nBayesian framework, this waveform model represents the GW signal produced\nduring the merger and is crucial for estimating the likelihood function.\nHowever, these waveform models may possess systematic errors that can differ\nacross the parameter space. Addressing these errors in the current data\nanalysis pipeline is an active area of research. This work presents a framework\nfor accounting for uncertainties in waveform modeling. We introduce two\nparametrizations, relative and absolute errors in the phase of the waveform, to\nmodify the base waveform model, which can account for uncertainties. When the\nwaveform errors are known, those error budgets can be used as a prior\ndistribution in the Bayesian framework. We also show that conservative priors\ncan be used to quantify uncertainties in waveform modeling without any\nknowledge of waveform error budgets. By conducting zero-noise injections and\nrecoveries, we demonstrate through PE results that even 1-2% of errors in\nrelative phase to the actual waveform model can introduce biases in the\nrecovered parameters. These biases can be corrected when we account for\nwaveform uncertainties within the PE framework. By injecting a series of\nprecessing waveform models and using the nonspinning model for recovery, we\nshow that our method can account for the missing physics by making the\nposterior samples broad enough to account for bias.

In\nparticular, programmable multi-core accelerators feature a cluster of\nprocessing elements and tightly coupled scratchpad memories to balance\nperformance, energy efficiency, and flexibility. In embedded systems running a\ngeneral-purpose OS, accelerators access data via dedicated, physically\naddressed memory regions. This negatively impacts memory utilization and\nperformance by requiring a copy from the virtual host address to the physical\naccelerator address space. Input-Output Memory Management Units (IOMMUs)\novercome this limitation by allowing devices and hosts to use a shared virtual\npaged address space. However, resolving IO virtual addresses can be\nparticularly costly on high-latency memory systems as it requires up to three\nsequential memory accesses on IOTLB miss. In this work, we present a\nquantitative evaluation of shared virtual addressing in RISC-V heterogeneous\nembedded systems. We integrate an IOMMU in an open-source heterogeneous RISC-V\nSoC consisting of a 64-bit host with a 32-bit accelerator cluster. We evaluated\nthe system performance by emulating the design on FPGA and implementing compute\nkernels from the RajaPERF benchmark suite using heterogeneous OpenMP\nprogramming. We measure the transfers and computation time on the host and\naccelerators for systems with different DRAM access latencies. We first show\nthat IO virtual address translation can account for 4.2% up to 17.6% of the\naccelerator's runtime for gemm (General Matrix Multiplication) at low and high\nmemory bandwidth. Then, we show that in systems containing a last-level cache,\nthis IO address translation cost falls to 0.4% and 0.7% under the same\nconditions, making shared virtual addressing and zero-copy offloading suitable\nfor such RISC-V heterogeneous SoCs.",

    "abstract": "Increasing interest in reasoning models has led math to become a prominent\ntesting ground for algorithmic and methodological improvements. However,\nexisting open math datasets either contain a small collection of high-quality,\nhuman-written problems or a large corpus of machine-generated problems of\nuncertain quality, forcing researchers to choose between quality and quantity.\nIn this work, we present Big-Math, a dataset of over 250,000 high-quality math\nquestions with verifiable answers, purposefully made for reinforcement learning\n(RL). To create Big-Math, we rigorously filter, clean, and curate openly\navailable datasets, extracting questions that satisfy our three desiderata: (1)\nproblems with uniquely verifiable solutions, (2) problems that are open-ended,\n(3) and problems with a closed-form solution. To ensure the quality of\nBig-Math, we manually verify each step in our filtering process. Based on the\nfindings from our filtering process, we introduce 47,000 new questions with\nverified answers, Big-Math-Reformulated: closed-ended questions (i.e. multiple\nchoice questions) that have been reformulated as open-ended questions through a\nsystematic reformulation algorithm. Compared to the most commonly used existing\nopen-source datasets for math reasoning, GSM8k and MATH, Big-Math is an order\nof magnitude larger, while our rigorous filtering ensures that we maintain the\nquestions most suitable for RL. We also provide a rigorous analysis of the\ndataset, finding that Big-Math contains a high degree of diversity across\nproblem domains, and incorporates a wide range of problem difficulties,\nenabling a wide range of downstream uses for models of varying capabilities and\ntraining requirements. By bridging the gap between data quality and quantity,\nBig-Math establish a robust foundation for advancing reasoning in LLMs.",

Prior\nwork on inquisitive questions focuses on learner-generated, curiosity-driven\nqueries and evaluates them using indirect metrics, such as salience or\ninformation gain, that do not directly capture a question's impact on actual\nlearning outcomes. We introduce QUEST (Question Utility Estimation with\nSimulated Tests), a framework that uses language models to simulate learners\nand directly quantify the utility of a question - its contribution to exam\nperformance. QUEST simulates a learner who asks questions and receives answers\nwhile studying a textbook chapter, then uses them to take an end-of-chapter\nexam. Through this simulation, the utility of each question is estimated by its\ndirect effect on exam performance, rather than inferred indirectly based on the\nunderlying content. To support this evaluation, we curate TEXTBOOK-EXAM, a\nbenchmark that aligns textbook sections with end-of-section exam questions\nacross five academic disciplines. Using QUEST, we filter for high-utility\nquestions and fine-tune question generators via rejection sampling. Experiments\nshow that questions generated by QUEST-trained models improve simulated test\nscores by over 20% compared to strong baselines that are fine-tuned using\nindirect metrics or leverage prompting methods. Furthermore, utility is only\nweakly correlated with salience and similarity to exam questions, suggesting\nthat it captures unique signal that benefits downstream performance.

Building on these quantitative findings, this study\nsurveys 155 practitioners from 47 ML projects to investigate the underlying\nreasons for these distinctive characteristics through a qualitative\nperspective. Practitioners highlighted eight key differences, including test\ncomplexity, infrastructure requirements, and build duration and stability.\nCommon challenges mentioned by practitioners include higher project complexity,\nmodel training demands, extensive data handling, increased computational\nresource needs, and dependency management, all contributing to extended build\ndurations.

    "abstract": "Search and rescue (SAR) missions require reliable search methods to locate\nsurvivors, especially in challenging or inaccessible environments. This is why\nintroducing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be of great help to enhance the\nefficiency of SAR missions while simultaneously increasing the safety of\neveryone involved in the mission. Motivated by this, we design and experiment\nwith autonomous UAV search for humans in a Mediterranean karst environment. The\nUAVs are directed using Heat equation-driven area coverage (HEDAC) ergodic\ncontrol method according to known probability density and detection function.\nThe implemented sensing framework consists of a probabilistic search model,\nmotion control system, and computer vision object detection. It enables\ncalculation of the probability of the target being detected in the SAR mission,\nand this paper focuses on experimental validation of proposed probabilistic\nframework and UAV control. The uniform probability density to ensure the even\nprobability of finding the targets in the desired search area is achieved by\nassigning suitably thought-out tasks to 78 volunteers. The detection model is\nbased on YOLO and trained with a previously collected ortho-photo image\ndatabase. The experimental search is carefully planned and conducted, while as\nmany parameters as possible are recorded. The thorough analysis consists of the\nmotion control system, object detection, and the search validation. The\nassessment of the detection and search performance provides strong indication\nthat the designed detection model in the UAV control algorithm is aligned with\nreal-world results.",

This study\nintroduces a novel application of Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks\n(STGNNs) to greenhouse microclimate modeling, comparing their performance with\ntraditional Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). While RNNs excel at temporal\npattern recognition, they cannot explicitly model the directional relationships\nbetween environmental variables. Our STGNN approach addresses this limitation\nby representing these relationships as directed graphs, enabling the model to\ncapture both environmental dependencies and their directionality. We benchmark\nRNNs against directed STGNNs on two 15-min-resolution datasets from Volos\n(Greece): a six-variable 2020 installation and a more complex eight-variable\ngreenhouse monitored in autumn 2024. In the simpler 2020 case the RNN attains\nnear-perfect accuracy, outperforming the STGNN. When additional drivers are\navailable in 2024, the STGNN overtakes the RNN ($R^{2}=0.905$ vs $0.740$),\ndemonstrating that explicitly modelling directional dependencies becomes\ncritical as interaction complexity grows. These findings indicate when\ngraph-based models are warranted and provide a stepping-stone toward digital\ntwins that jointly optimise crop yield and PV power in agrivoltaic greenhouses.",

Two\nclinically relevant 3D generative modelling use cases were investigated:\nnon-contrast head CT with intracerebral hemorrhage (N=774) and time-of-flight\nMR angiography of the Circle of Willis (N=1,782). Expert visual scoring was\nused as the reference standard to assess the presence of replicas. We report\nthe balanced accuracy at the optimal threshold to assess replica classification\nperformance. The reference visual rating identified 45 of 50 and 5 of 50\ngenerated images as replicas for the NCCT and TOF-MRA use cases, respectively.\nImage-level and feature-level measures perfectly classified replicas with a\nbalanced accuracy of 1 when an optimal threshold was selected for the NCCT use\ncase.

To model this phenomenon, we apply the LWR ((Lighthill & Whitham,\n1955), (Richards, 1956)) theory on a homogenous freeway with a discontinuous\nbottleneck at its downstream end, assuming a uni-modal demand profile with a\nstochastic peak. We establish conditions for typical counterclockwise\nhysteresis loops under these assumptions. It is demonstrated that shapes of the\nfundamental diagram which always produce a counterclockwise loop can be\ninterpreted as an indication of aggressive driving behavior, while deviations\nmay occur under defensive driving. This classification enables a detailed\nexplanation of the qualitative physical mechanisms behind this pattern, as well\nas an analysis of the causes for quantitatively limited deviations. Some of the\nmathematical properties of the LWR model identified in our analysis have not\nyet been addressed in the literature and we critically examine the extent to\nwhich these reflect actual traffic flow behavior. Our considerations are\nsupported by numerical experiments. The obtained results aim to improve the\nfundamental understanding of the physical causes of this hysteresis pattern and\nto facilitate its better estimation in traffic planning and control.",

We compare these with homogeneously derived\nabundances from archive spectra of 12 Gaia Enceladus (GE) stars. The chemical\nabundances of all five substructures suggest that they are of accreted origin,\nexcept for two stars that present a high [{\\alpha}/Fe] at high [Fe/H] more in\nline with an in situ origin.

    "abstract": "Linker generation is critical in drug discovery applications such as lead\noptimization and PROTAC design, where molecular fragments are assembled into\ndiverse drug candidates via molecular linker. Existing methods fall into point\ncloud-free and point cloud-aware categories based on their use of fragments' 3D\nposes alongside their topologies in sampling the linker's topology. Point\ncloud-free models prioritize sample diversity but suffer from lower validity\ndue to overlooking fragments' spatial constraints, while point cloud-aware\nmodels ensure higher validity but restrict diversity by enforcing strict\nspatial constraints. To overcome these trade-offs without additional training,\nwe propose HybridLinker, a framework that enhances point cloud-aware inference\nby providing diverse bonding topologies from a pretrained point cloud-free\nmodel as guidance. At its core, we propose LinkerDPS, the first diffusion\nposterior sampling (DPS) method operating across point cloud-free and point\ncloud-aware spaces, bridging molecular topology with 3D point clouds via an\nenergy-inspired function. By transferring the diverse sampling distribution of\npoint cloud-free models into the point cloud-aware distribution, HybridLinker\nsignificantly surpasses baselines, improving both validity and diversity in\nfoundational molecular design and applied drug optimization tasks, establishing\na new DPS framework in the molecular domains beyond imaging.",

As an integral part of\ntravel planning systems, recommendation algorithms devise personalized tour\nitineraries for individual users considering the popularity of a city's Points\nof Interest (POIs) as well as the tourist preferences and constraints. However,\nin the context of next-generation touristic services, recommendation algorithms\nshould also consider the applications (e.g., social network, mobile video\nstreaming, mobile augmented reality) the tourist will consume in the POIs and\nthe quality in which the MEC infrastructure will deliver such applications. In\nthis paper, we address the joint problem of recommending personalized tour\nitineraries for tourists and efficiently allocating MEC resources for advanced\ntouristic applications. We formulate an optimization problem that maximizes the\nitinerary of individual tourists while optimizing the resource allocation at\nthe network edge. We then propose an exact algorithm that quickly solves the\nproblem optimally, considering instances of realistic size. Using a real-world\nlocation-based photo-sharing database, we conduct and present an exploratory\nanalysis to understand preferences and users' visiting patterns. Using this\nunderstanding, we propose a methodology to identify user interest in\napplications. Finally, we evaluate our algorithm using this dataset. Results\nshow that our algorithm outperforms a modified version of a state-of-the-art\nsolution for personalized tour itinerary recommendation, demonstrating gains up\nto 11% for resource allocation efficiency and 40% for user experience.

In this paper, inspired by previous work on\nso-called ``nulling'' techniques, we present a general method that selects the\nlinear combinations of a given tomographic cosmic shear dataset that are least\nsensitive to small-scale non-linearities, by essentially suppressing the\ncontribution from low-redshift structures. We apply this method to the latest\npublic cosmic shear data from the Dark Energy Survey, DES-Y3, that corresponds\nto 3 years of observation, and show: a) that a large fraction of the signal is\ndominated by the single mode that is most affected by non-linear scales, and b)\nthat removing this mode leads to a $\\sim1\\sigma$ upwards shift in the preferred\nvalue of $S_8\\equiv\\sigma_8\\sqrt{\\Omega_M/0.3}$, alleviating the tension with\ncurrent CMB data. However, the removal of the most contaminated mode also\nresults in a significant increase in the statistical uncertainties.

Lanthanide doping in TMDCs, such as\n\\defect{MoS}{2}, offers a potential solution by introducing sharp, $f$-orbital\nderived emissions in the infrared range.

    "abstract": "Sparse auto-encoders (SAEs) have become a prevalent tool for interpreting\nlanguage models' inner workings. However, it is unknown how tightly SAE\nfeatures correspond to computationally important directions in the model. This\nwork empirically shows that many RES-JB SAE features predominantly correspond\nto simple input statistics. We hypothesize this is caused by a large class\nimbalance in training data combined with a lack of complex error signals. To\nreduce this behavior, we propose a method that disentangles token\nreconstruction from feature reconstruction. This improvement is achieved by\nintroducing a per-token bias, which provides an enhanced baseline for\ninteresting reconstruction. As a result, significantly more interesting\nfeatures and improved reconstruction in sparse regimes are learned.",

Irrespective of these riots' specific trigger, a key question is how\nthe capacity for such widespread city rioting might be foreseen through some\nprecursor behavior that flags an emerging appetite for such rioting at scale.\nHere we show evidence that points toward particular online behavior which\ndeveloped at scale well ahead of the riots, across the multi-platform landscape\nof hate/extremist communities. Our analysis of detailed multi-platform data\nreveals a web-of-influence that existed well before the riots, involving online\nhate and extremism communities locally, nationally, and globally. This\nweb-of-influence fed would-be rioters in each city mainly through video\nplatforms. This web-of-influence has a persistent resilience -- and hence still\nrepresents a significant local, national, and international threat in the\nfuture -- because of its feedback across regional-national-international scales\nand across topics such as immigration; and its use of multiple lesser-known\nplatforms that put it beyond any single government or platform's reach. Going\nforward, our findings mean that if city administrators coordinate with each\nother across local-national-international divides, they can map this threat as\nwe have done here and initiate deliberation programs that might then soften\nsuch pre-existing extremes at scale, perhaps using automated AI-based\ntechnology.",

    "abstract": "Providing a detailed picture of the Sagittarius (Sgr) stream offers important\nconstraints on the build-up of the Galactic halo as well as its gravitational\npotential at large radii. While several attempts have been made to model the\nstructure of the Sgr stream, no model has yet been able to match all the\nfeatures observed for the stream. Moreover, for several of these features,\nobservational characterisation of their properties is rather limited,\nparticularly at large distances. The aim of this work is to investigate the\nkinematics of the Sgr stream outermost spur feature using blue horizontal\nbranch (BHB) stars. Candidate BHB stars were selected by combining two\napproaches; one capitalising on Pan-STARRS1 3$\\Pi$ griz and u photometry taken\nas part of UNIONS, the other using Pristine Survey CaHK and SDSS ugr\nphotometry. Follow-up optical spectra are obtained using ESO/VLT/FORS2 to\nconfirm their BHB nature and obtain line-of-sight (LOS) velocities. Of our 25\ncandidates, 20 stars can be confirmed as bona fide BHB stars. Their LOS\nvelocities, together with the 3D positions of these stars qualitatively match\nwell with Sgr model predictions and trace the outer apocentre of the trailing\narm and its spur feature very nicely. The quantitative offsets that are found\nbetween our data and the different models can be used to provide information\nabout the Galactic gravitational potential at large distances. We present a\nfirst, tentative, analysis in this direction, showing that the model of\nVasiliev et al. (2021) would provide better agreement with our observations if\nthe enclosed mass of the Milky Way within 100 kpc were lowered to\n$(5.3\\!\\pm\\!0.4)\\!\\times\\!10^{11}$ M$_\\odot$ (versus\n$(5.6\\!\\pm\\!0.4)\\!\\times\\!10^{11}$ M$_\\odot$). Our selection of BHB stars\nprovides a new view on the outermost structure in 3D positions and LOS\nvelocities of the Sgr debris.",

    "abstract": "Understanding heat transfers in fibrous materials, particularly conduction,\nis a major challenge due to their heterogeneous and multiscale nature, and the\nunknown contribution of fiber-to-fiber contacts. In most previous modeling\nstudies, the existence of thermal contact resistance is not considered, and the\ncomputational complexity limits the size of simulated samples, which often\nleads to imprecise or inaccurate predictions. The same problem arises when\nconsidering electrical conduction through fibrous materials. In this work, we\ndescribe a computationally efficient simulation approach based on multinodal\nrepresentation to analyze the steady-state heat conduction through the solid\nstructure in numerically generated three-dimensional nanofiber networks,\nincluding contact resistance. We show that the solid conductivity in these\nnetworks is governed by a master curve that depends on a single parameter: a\ncharacteristic ratio representing the interplay between the intrinsic fiber\nconductivity and contact resistance as well as the influence of other geometric\nparameters, which numerically validates previous theoretical studies. However,\nwe observe a deviation to this established theory for poorly connected\nnetworks. We derive an expression for a correction factor, considering the\ninfluence of correlations between fiber temperatures, and we then find good\nagreement with our simulation data. Our results demonstrate that the solid\nconductivity can be fully predicted based on geometric quantities, regardless\nof the extent of network connectivity, thus generalizing previous studies on\nthis topic. This work, contributing to improve our understanding of conductive\nheat transport in fibrous media, may prove useful in the development of\naccurate predictive models and optimization strategies for fibrous insulation\nmaterials.",

Modeling small scales of motion is crucial for\nsaving time and resources in numerical simulations, particularly in industrial\napplications. Here we attempt to model small scales of motion by creating\nclosures for a Shell model of turbulence, more specifically for Sabra. Shell\nmodels are infinite dimensional dynamical systems that retain most key\nproperties of Navier-Stokes equation, such as energy cascade and intermittency,\nwhile being computationally treatable. To account for Sabra's intermittent\nfluctuations we employ a set of scaling relations that recover a hidden\nsymmetry and leaves us with universal statistics across the inertial range. On\ndata from these rescaled variables we then adapt and apply two machine learning\ntools, a variational auto-encoder and sparse identification of non-linear\ndynamics. We estimate the data's densities and dynamics in order to then\ngenerate new instances of data. Given a mid-inertial range cutoff scale, we\nevolve reduced models in time, resolving only scales of motion larger than the\ncutoff scale, closing the reduced model with data generated by the machine\nlearning tools. We compare statistics of our reduced models against a Sabra's\nfully resolved simulation to evaluate each closure's performances.

In this paper, we\nextend the concept of inverse kinematics to guiding vector fields for path\nfollowing in autonomous mobile robots. The desired path is defined by its\nimplicit equation, i.e., by a collection of points belonging to one or more\nzero-level sets. These level sets serve as a reference to construct an error\nsignal that drives the guiding vector field toward the desired path, enabling\nthe robot to converge and travel along the path by following such a vector\nfield. We start with the formal exposition on how inverse kinematics can be\napplied to guiding vector fields for single-integrator robots in an\nm-dimensional Euclidean space. Then, we leverage inverse kinematics to ensure\nthat the level-set error signal behaves as a linear system, facilitating\ncontrol over the robot's transient motion toward the desired path and allowing\nfor the injection of feed-forward signals to induce precise motion behavior\nalong the path. We then propose solutions to the theoretical and practical\nchallenges of applying this technique to unicycles with constant speeds to\nfollow 2D paths with precise transient control.

Through comprehensive DFT analysis, including\nelectronic properties analysis, charge transfer evaluations, work function,\noptical properties assessment and recovery times, the feasibility and\nefficiency of BeS as a VOC (volatile organic compound) detection are\ninvestigated. Findings reveal significant changes in bandgap upon VOC\nadsorption, with notable alteration in work function for selective compounds.\nOptical property analyses demonstrate the potential for selective detection of\nbiomarkers within specific wavelength ranges. Moreover, the study evaluates the\nimpact of electric fields and strain on VOC-2D BeS interaction. Furthermore,\nthe desorption of these VOCs from the BeS surface can be achieved through a\nheating process or under the illumination of UV light.

Current approaches\nwhich rely heavily on a computed similarity measure between documents are often\nlimited in accuracy and interpretability. We present a novel approach to the\nproblem based on a set of evolved search queries. Clusters are formed as the\nset of documents matched by a single search query in the set of queries. The\nqueries are optimized to maximize the number of documents returned and to\nminimize the overlap between clusters (documents returned by more than one\nquery). Where queries contain more than one word they are interpreted\ndisjunctively. We have found it useful to assign one word to be the root and\nconstrain the query construction such that the set of documents returned by any\nadditional query words intersect with the set returned by the root word. Not\nall documents in a collection are returned by any of the search queries in a\nset, so once the search query evolution is completed a second stage is\nperformed whereby a KNN algorithm is applied to assign all unassigned documents\nto their nearest cluster. We describe the method and present results using 8\ntext datasets comparing effectiveness with well-known existing algorithms. We\nnote that as well as achieving the highest accuracy on these datasets the\nsearch query format provides the qualitative benefits of being interpretable\nand modifiable whilst providing a causal explanation of cluster construction.",

It is observed\nthat existing methods for medicinal plant classification often fail to perform\nhierarchical classification and accurately identifying unknown species,\nlimiting their effectiveness in comprehensive plant taxonomy classification.\nThus we address the problem of unknown species classification by assigning it\nbest hierarchical labels. We propose a novel method, which integrates\nDenseNet121, Multi-Scale Self-Attention (MSSA) and cascaded classifiers for\nhierarchical classification. The approach systematically categorizes medicinal\nplants at multiple taxonomic levels, from phylum to species, ensuring detailed\nand precise classification. Using multi scale space attention, the model\ncaptures both local and global contextual information from the images,\nimproving the distinction between similar species and the identification of new\nones. It uses attention scores to focus on important features across multiple\nscales. The proposed method provides a solution for hierarchical\nclassification, showcasing superior performance in identifying both known and\nunknown species. The model was tested on two state-of-art datasets with and\nwithout background artifacts and so that it can be deployed to tackle real word\napplication. We used unknown species for testing our model. For unknown species\nthe model achieved an average accuracy of 83.36%, 78.30%, 60.34% and 43.32% for\npredicting correct phylum, class, order and family respectively. Our proposed\nmodel size is almost four times less than the existing state of the art methods\nmaking it easily deploy able in real world application.",

The goal is to use a small\nnumber of queries to determine with constant probability whether the two curves\nare similar (i.e., their discrete Fr\\'echet distance is at most $\\delta$) or\nthey are ''$\\varepsilon$-far'' (for $0 < \\varepsilon < 2$) from being similar,\ni.e., more than an $\\varepsilon$-fraction of the two curves must be ignored for\nthem to become similar.

The first algorithm uses\n$O(\\frac{t}{\\varepsilon}\\log\\frac{t}{\\varepsilon})$ queries and is given the\nvalue of $t$ in advance.

Increasing the probe intensity, we went beyond the\nnon-perturbative regime and observed a number of light-induced effects. In\nparticular, the illumination with shorter wavelength light gives rise to a\npersistent recharging of the quantum dots by holes ($|g|=0.17$ and\nT$^*_{2\\text{,h}}$ = 1.4 ns, T$^*_{1\\text{,h}}$ $\\geq$ 30 ns), which remains\nstable over multiple cycles of heating to the room temperature and cooling. In\naddition, elliptically polarized light induced an \"optical\" magnetic field on\nthe system due to the AC Stark effect. It is confirmed using a new modification\nof polarization noise spectroscopy with a small degree of circular polarization\nof the probe light added with different frequencies.",

Since it is a highly nonlinear model,\nits input-output relations are still poorly understood. Researchers therefore\noften employ sensitivity analyses to elucidate relative parametric importance\nfor certain use cases. However, some methods are ill-suited for the complexity\nof the model and appropriate methods often face the downside of only being\napplicable to scalar quantities of interest. We implement a novel framework for\nglobal sensitivity analysis of time-dependent model outputs and apply it to a\ndrive cycle simulation. We conduct a full and a subgroup sensitivity analysis\nto resolve lowly sensitive parameters and explore the model error when\nunimportant parameters are set to arbitrary values. Our findings suggest that\nthe method identifies insensitive parameters whose variations cause only small\ndeviations in the voltage response of the model. By providing the methodology,\nwe hope research questions related to parametric sensitivity for time-dependent\nquantities of interest, such as voltage responses, can be addressed more easily\nand adequately in simulative battery research and beyond.",

    "abstract": "Order fairness in distributed ledgers refers to properties that relate the\norder in which transactions are sent or received to the order in which they are\neventually finalized, i.e., totally ordered. The study of such properties is\nrelatively new and has been especially stimulated by the rise of Maximal\nExtractable Value (MEV) attacks in blockchain environments. Indeed, in many\nclassical blockchain protocols, leaders are responsible for selecting the\ntransactions to be included in blocks, which creates a clear vulnerability and\nopportunity for transaction order manipulation.\n  Unlike blockchains, DAG-based ledgers allow participants in the network to\nindependently propose blocks, which are then arranged as vertices of a directed\nacyclic graph. Interestingly, leaders in DAG-based ledgers are elected only\nafter the fact, once transactions are already part of the graph, to determine\ntheir total order. In other words, transactions are not chosen by single\nleaders; instead, they are collectively validated by the nodes, and leaders are\nonly elected to establish an ordering. This approach intuitively reduces the\nrisk of transaction manipulation and enhances fairness.\n  In this paper, we aim to quantify the capability of DAG-based ledgers to\nachieve order fairness. To this end, we define new variants of order fairness\nadapted to DAG-based ledgers and evaluate the impact of an adversary capable of\ncompromising a limited number of nodes (below the one-third threshold) to\nreorder transactions. We analyze how often our order fairness properties are\nviolated under different network conditions and parameterizations of the DAG\nalgorithm, depending on the adversary's power.\n  Our study shows that DAG-based ledgers are still vulnerable to reordering\nattacks, as an adversary can coordinate a minority of Byzantine nodes to\nmanipulate the DAG's structure.",

Existing solutions primarily address\nthese challenges by incorporating wireless resource optimization strategies,\noften focusing on uplink resource allocation across clients under the\nassumption of homogeneous client-server network standards. However, these\napproaches overlooked the fact that mobile clients may connect to the server\nvia diverse network standards (e.g., 4G, 5G, Wi-Fi) with customized\nconfigurations, limiting the flexibility of server-side modifications and\nrestricting applicability in real-world commercial networks. This paper\npresents a novel theoretical analysis about how transmission failures in\nunreliable networks distort the effective label distributions of local samples,\ncausing deviations from the global data distribution and introducing\nconvergence bias in FL. Our analysis reveals that a carefully designed client\nselection strategy can mitigate biases induced by network unreliability and\ndata heterogeneity. Motivated by this insight, we propose FedCote, a client\nselection approach that optimizes client selection probabilities without\nrelying on wireless resource scheduling. Experimental results demonstrate the\nrobustness of FedCote in DNN-based classification tasks under unreliable\nnetworks with frequent transmission failures.",

While it is often easy to craft prompts that yield a substantial\nlikelihood for the affirmative response, the attacked model frequently does not\ncomplete the response in a harmful manner. Moreover, the affirmative objective\nis usually not adapted to model-specific preferences and essentially ignores\nthe fact that LLMs output a distribution over responses.

The aim of this\npaper is at explaining how to correctly understand the law of urban allometric\ngrowth by means of the methods of literature analysis and mathematical\nanalysis. The results show the average measures cannot be applied to all types\nof allometric relationships, and the allometric relationships based on average\nmeasures cannot be derived from a general principle. Whether it is an empirical\nmodel or a theoretical model of allometric growth, its generation and\nderivation are independent of the average measures.

    "abstract": "Machine learning methods can automate the in silico design of biological\nsequences, aiming to reduce costs and accelerate medical research. Given the\nlimited access to wet labs, in silico design methods commonly use an oracle\nmodel to evaluate de novo generated sequences. However, the use of different\noracle models across methods makes it challenging to compare them reliably,\nmotivating the question: are in silico sequence design benchmarks reliable? In\nthis work, we examine 12 sequence design methods that utilise ML oracles common\nin the literature and find that there are significant challenges with their\ncross-consistency and reproducibility. Indeed, oracles differing by\narchitecture, or even just training seed, are shown to yield conflicting\nrelative performance with our analysis suggesting poor out-of-distribution\ngeneralisation as a key issue. To address these challenges, we propose\nsupplementing the evaluation with a suite of biophysical measures to assess the\nviability of generated sequences and limit out-of-distribution sequences the\noracle is required to score, thereby improving the robustness of the design\nprocedure. Our work aims to highlight potential pitfalls in the current\nevaluation process and contribute to the development of robust benchmarks,\nultimately driving the improvement of in silico design methods.",

    "abstract": "Particle size and shape are the key 3D particle geometry parameters that\ngovern the complex behavior of granular materials. The effect of particle size\nand shape has often been examined in isolation, typically through separate\nanalyses of particle size distribution (PSD) and shape distribution, leading to\nan unaddressed knowledge gap. Beyond size and shape, 3D particle geometry also\nincludes attributes such as surface area and volume, which together defines the\nsurface-area-to-volume ratio, commonly known as the specific surface. To\ncomprehensively understand the influence of particle geometry on the behavior\nof granular materials, it is important to integrate these parameters, ideally\ninto a single analytical framework. To this end, this paper presents a new\napproach, particle geometry space (PGS), formulated based on the principle that\nthe key 3D particle geometry attributes - volume, surface area, and shape - can\nbe uniformly expressed as a function of specific surface. The PGS not only\nencompasses all 3D particle geometry attributes but also extends its scope by\nintegrating the conventional PSD concept. This innovation enables engineers and\nresearchers who are already familiar with PSD to perform a more systematic\ncharacterization of 3D particle geometries. The paper (i) discusses the\nlimitations of existing methods for characterizing 3D particle geometry, (ii)\noffers an overview of the PGS, (iii) proposes a method for integrating PSD into\nthe PGS, and (iv) demonstrates its application with a set of 3D mineral\nparticle geometry data.",

Here, we\nemphasize the importance of also accounting for corrections of the ligand $p$\nstates. We demonstrate that focusing exclusively on an improved description of\nthe TM $d$ states results in difficulties to obtain the correct insulating\nbehavior for a variety of materials, and requires to use values for the local\ninteraction parameters that are inconsistent with values obtained using, e.g.,\nthe constrained random phase approximation (cRPA). Importantly, these\nconsiderations not only apply to cases where the $p$ states are explicitly\nincluded in the DMFT low-energy subspace, but also to cases which only include\nso-called frontier bands with dominant TM $d$ character. We demonstrate that,\nto a large part, these inconsistencies arise from the use of local/semi-local\nDFT as starting point for computing interaction parameters within cRPA, and we\nshow that applying a simple empirical correction to the O $p$ and other low\nenergy states not included in the correlated subspace results in improved\nvalues for the interaction parameters that then allow to obtain the correct\ninsulating behavior. For the cases where the ligand states are included in the\nDMFT subspace, we show that even an approximate but realistic Hartree-Fock-like\ncorrection applied to the O $p$ states leads to a correct and, most\nimportantly, also a quantitatively consistent DFT+DMFT description of typical\nMott insulators such as LaTiO$_3$, LaVO$_3$, or the perovskite rare-earth\nnickelates, $R$NiO$_3$.",

Federated learning (FL) can address\nthis issue by running distributed ML models at local SMs without data exchange.\nHowever, current FL-based approaches struggle to achieve efficient load\nforecasting due to imbalanced data distribution across heterogeneous SMs. This\npaper presents a novel personalized federated learning (PFL) method for\nhigh-quality load forecasting in metering networks. A meta-learning-based\nstrategy is developed to address data heterogeneity at local SMs in the\ncollaborative training of local load forecasting models.

Solving a\nCFT is an extremely constrained problem due to conformal invariance -- the task\nessentially reduces to the computation of a set of numbers called the CFT data\n-- yet it remains highly nontrivial. In fact, CFTs usually are strongly coupled\nand thus require new tools that do not rely on perturbation theory. For these\nreasons, in the past few decades, they became one of the most active fields of\nresearch. A natural extension of these ideas with far-reaching implications for\ncondensed matter systems -- in which relativistic effects are not manifest --\nis to replace the Poincare group by the Galilean group, thereby opening the way\nto a precise formulation of a whole new class of critical phenomena in terms of\nnonrelativistic conformal field theories (NRCFTs). Many of the aforementioned\ntools developed to gain a better formal understanding of CFTs can then be\nadapted to gain a strong predictive power in systems with direct experimental\nrelevance. In recent years, a new powerful tool has emerged: the large-charge\nexpansion. It allows to systemically uncover part of the CFT data of theories\nwith global symmetries, thereby revealing profound and universal features of\nthese systems. Using the state-operator correspondence, most of the\ncomputations are further reduced to the evaluation of energy levels in a\nfinite-density system described by a large-charge effective field theory,\nusually associated with a conformal superfluid phase. The large-charge dynamics\nin the nonrelativistic case is however richer -- and therefore, more\nchallenging -- than its relativistic counterpart.

Several of these regional trends lie outside\nthe range of historic CMIP6 model simulations, and they might constitute a\njoined dynamic response that is missed by climate models. Here, we examine if\nthe regional trends in circulation are indeed part of a coherent circumglobal\nwave pattern. Using ERA5 reanalysis data and CMIP6 historical simulations, we\nfind that the observed upper-atmospheric circulation trends consist of at least\ntwo separate regional signatures: a US-Atlantic and a Eurasian trend pattern.\nThe circulation trend can explain on average 15% and 26% of the observed\nregional temperature trends in the US-Atlantic and Eurasian regions\nrespectively. The circulation trend in the CMIP6 multi-model-mean does not\nresemble the observed trend pattern and is much weaker overall. Some individual\nCMIP6 models do show a resemblance to the observed pattern in ERA5, although\nstill weak with a maximum pattern correlation of 0.47. The pattern correlation\nis higher for the two individual regions (US-Atlantic and Eurasia), reaching a\nmaximum of 0.69 and 0.78. We show that both regional wave patterns in ERA5 are\nassociated with distinct sea surface temperature and outgoing longwave\nradiation anomalies in the three weeks leading up to the atmospheric\nconfiguration, resembling known teleconnection patterns. CMIP6 models appear to\nlack these tropical-extra-tropical teleconnections.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) excel in many tasks but struggle to accurately\nquantify uncertainty in their generated responses. This limitation makes it\nchallenging to detect misinformation and ensure reliable decision-making.\nExisting uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods for LLMs are primarily\nprompt-wise rather than response-wise, often requiring multiple response\nsamples, which incurs high computational costs. Moreover, LLMs have been shown\nto be overconfident, particularly when using reasoning steps to derive their\nanswers. In this work, we propose CoT-UQ, a response-wise UQ framework that\nintegrates LLMs' inherent reasoning capabilities through Chain-of-Thought (CoT)\ninto the UQ process. CoT-UQ captures critical information during inference by\nextracting keywords from each reasoning step and assessing their importance to\nthe final answer. This key reasoning information is then aggregated to produce\na final uncertainty estimate. We conduct extensive experiments based on Llama\nFamily with model sizes varying from 8B to 13B across logical and mathematical\nreasoning tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that CoT-UQ significantly\noutperforms existing UQ methods, achieving an average improvement of 5.9% AUROC\ncompared to current UQ methods.

    "abstract": "Spectral unmixing is an important task in the research field of hyperspectral\nimage processing. It can be thought of as a regression problem, where the\nobserved variable (i.e., an image pixel) is to be found as a function of the\nresponse variables (i.e., the pure materials in a scene, called endmembers).\nThe Linear Mixing Model (LMM) has received a great deal of attention, due to\nits simplicity and ease of use in, e.g., optimization problems. Its biggest\nflaw is that it assumes that any pure material can be characterized by one\nunique spectrum throughout the entire scene. In many cases this is incorrect:\nthe endmembers face a significant amount of spectral variability caused by,\ne.g., illumination conditions, atmospheric effects, or intrinsic variability.\nResearchers have suggested several generalizations of the LMM to mitigate this\neffect. However, most models lead to ill-posed and highly non-convex\noptimization problems, which are hard to solve and have hyperparameters that\nare difficult to tune. In this paper, we propose a two-step LMM that bridges\nthe gap between model complexity and computational tractability. We show that\nthis model leads to only a mildly non-convex optimization problem, which we\nsolve with an interior-point solver. This method requires virtually no\nhyperparameter tuning, and can therefore be used easily and quickly in a wide\nrange of unmixing tasks. We show that the model is competitive and in some\ncases superior to existing and well-established unmixing methods and\nalgorithms. We do this through several experiments on synthetic data, real-life\nsatellite data, and hybrid synthetic-real data.",

These conjectures are analytically verified for $J \\leq 14$ and/or $J\n\\leq 9$ using the computer algebra software MAPLE.

We first analyze a\nlubrication limit and derive one-dimensional evolution equations of film\nheights and solute concentrations. Then, under the assumption that the\ncapillarity and diffusion effects are negligible and the solute is perfectly\nsoluble, we obtain a conservative first-order system in terms of film heights\nand concentration gradients.

    "abstract": "Shor's algorithm efficiently solves factoring and discrete logarithm problems\nusing quantum computers, compromising all public key schemes used today. These\nschemes rely on assumptions on their computational complexity, which quantum\ncomputers can easily bypass. The solutions have to come from new algorithms -\ncalled Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) - or from new methods, such as Quantum\nKey Distribution (QKD). The former replicate the computational security ideas\nof classical public key algorithms, while the latter recurs to use the quantum\nproperties of nature, which also brings a mathematical security proof,\npotentially offering Information-Theoretic Security. To secure data in the\nfuture, we must adopt these paradigms. With the speed of quantum computing\nadvancements, the transition to quantum-safe cryptography within the next\ndecade is critical. Delays could expose long-lived confidential data, as\ncurrent encryption may be broken before its value expires. However, the shift\nmust balance the adoption of new technologies with maintaining proven systems\nto protect against present and future threats. In this work, we have selected\nTransport Layer Security, one of the most widely used protocols, as the\nfoundation to hybridize classical, quantum, and post-quantum cryptography in a\nway suitable for broad adoption in Software-Defined Networking, the most\nflexible networking paradigm that has been used to deploy integrated\nquantum-classical networks. To this end, we use standards for QKD key\nextraction and SDN integration. The purposed implementation is based on the\nlatest version of TLS and demonstrates advanced capabilities such as rekeying\nand key transport across a large QKD network, while supporting crypto-agility\nand maintaining backward compatibility through the use of ciphersuites. The\nperformance of this approach has been demonstrated using a deployed production\ninfrastructure.",

First, we explore how the precision of a\nsingle-qubit probe for estimating the common bath temperature can be enhanced\nby collective effects arising from the shared bath itself, particularly when\nthe second qubit is in resonance with the probe. Interestingly, we find that\nthe presence of local baths on each qubit can either jeopardize or, if these\nbaths are sufficiently cold, enhance this precision. Next, we demonstrate a\nremote temperature sensing scheme in which one qubit acts as a probe to\nestimate the temperature of a local bath affecting the other qubit, by\nleveraging their indirect interaction through the common bath. This approach\nenables remote temperature sensing without directly coupling the probe to the\ntarget qubit or its local environment, thereby minimizing potential\ndisturbances and practical challenges.

    "abstract": "Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) with Mixture of Experts (MoE) layers\nhave gained significant attention. Currently, state-of-the-art LLMs utilize\nthis architecture. There is a substantial amount of research on how to train\nsuch models and how to select hyperparameters for this architecture. However,\nthere is a lack of studies focusing on post-evaluation analysis of MoE layer\nproperties. In this paper, we take a first step toward closing this gap by\nevaluating expert contributions on the quiz-based MMLU benchmark. We show that\nmost experts were never activated during inference on this benchmark.\nAdditionally, the output distribution of gating networks is much closer to\nuniform than sparse. Finally, we demonstrate that the average performance of\nsome experts within the same layer varies significantly.",

In this region the volume complexity of any spherically symmetric black\nhole in $d+1$ spacetime dimensions reduces to a geodesic length in an effective\ntwo-dimensional JT-gravity theory. The length in JT-gravity has been argued to\nsaturate at very late times via non-perturbative corrections obtained from a\nrandom matrix description of the gravity theory.

For slow rotation rates, increasing the rotation rate\nreduces both the growth rate and the saturation level. Once the rotation rate\ncrosses a threshold, large-scale vortices are formed which enhance the growth\nrate and the saturation level. Below this threshold, the suppression of the\nsmall-scale dynamo with increasing rotation is explained by the fact that at\nscales close to, but smaller than, the forcing scale, rotating turbulence is\none-dimensionalized, with the velocity component along the rotation axis being\nlarger than the other two components. This is due to the rotational\ndestabilization of vortices produced by the forcing function. While the\nrotational effect on the growth rate becomes small at high Re, the ratio of the\nsteady-state magnetic to kinetic energies remains suppressed by up to 35% as\ncompared to the non-rotating case.",

In this work we introduce a novel\nmultiband deconvolution technique aimed at improving the resolution of\nground-based astronomical images by leveraging higher-resolution space-based\nobservations. The method capitalizes on the fortunate fact that the Rubin $r$,\n$i$, and $z$ bands lie within the Euclid VIS band. The algorithm jointly\nde-convolves all the data to convert the $r$-, $i$-, and $z$-band Rubin images\nto the resolution of Euclid by leveraging the correlations between the\ndifferent bands. We also investigate the performance of deep-learning-based\ndenoising with DRUNet to further improve the results. We illustrate the\neffectiveness of our method in terms of resolution and morphology recovery,\nflux preservation, and generalization to different noise levels. This approach\nextends beyond the specific Euclid-Rubin combination, offering a versatile\nsolution to improving the resolution of ground-based images in multiple\nphotometric bands by jointly using any space-based images with overlapping\nfilters.",

This contradicts most multiple-population formation\nscenarios, which predict that the enriched population 2p should initially be\nmore concentrated than the pristine population 1P. We analyze a MOCCA GC model\nthat exhibits a higher spatial concentration of 1P RGB stars than 2P RGB stars\nat 13 Gyr. The MOCCA models assume the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) pollution\nscenario, where 2P stars are initially more concentrated than 1P stars. Our\nresults indicate that the observed spatial distributions of multiple\npopulations, and possibly their kinematics, are significantly shaped by\ndynamical interactions. These interactions preferentially eject 2P RGB\nprogenitors from the central regions, leading to a transient over-concentration\nof 1P RGB stars at late times. This effect is particularly relevant for GCs\nwith present-day of a few $10^5 M_{\\odot}$, which have retained only about 10 -\n20 percent of their initial mass. Such clusters may appear dynamically young\ndue to heating from a black hole subsystem, even if they have undergone\nsignificant mass loss and dynamical evolution. Additionally, the relatively\nsmall number of RGB stars in these clusters suggests that interpreting the\nspatial distributions of multiple populations solely from RGB stars may lead to\nbiased conclusions about the overall distribution of 2P and 1P. The apparent\nover-concentration of the 1P relative to the 2P is likely a transient effect\ndriven by the preferential removal of 2P RGB progenitors via strong dynamical\nencounters. MOCCA models of multiple stellar populations based on the AGB\nscenario may explain anomalous features observed in some Galactic GCs, such as\nNGC 3201 and NGC 6101.",

Each of the above-mentioned scenarios is investigated\nunder the assumption that the QGP is isotropic. This assumption is then relaxed\nby using an anisotropic distribution for the quarks, and the calculations are\nrepeated. The formalism adopted in the calculation of these coefficients is\nthat of kinetic theory, particularly, the relativistic Boltzmann equation in\nthe relaxation time approximation.\n  The other part of this thesis deals with heavy quark (HQ) dynamics in the\nQGP. HQs have been recognised as very good probes of the QGP owing to their\nlarge masses. We have calculated the HQ energy loss $dE/dx$, longitudinal and\ntransverse momentum diffusion coeffcients $\\kappa L/T^3$ , and spatial\ndiffusion coefficient $D_s$ , to leading order in the strong coupling $\\alpha$,\nfor both charm and bottom quarks.

    "abstract": "We show that the long-standing problem of gauge dependence of the effective\npotential arises due to the factorisation of the determinant of operators,\nwhich is invalid when we take the zeta-regularised trace of the operators. We\nshow by correcting for this assumption by computing the multiplicative anomaly,\nthe gauge-dependent terms of the effective potential cancel. We also show that\nin two- and odd-dimensional non-compact spacetime manifolds where the\nmultiplicative anomaly term is zero, the standard calculation of one-loop\neffective potential gives a gauge-independent result. These results are in\nsupport of our claim that the multiplicative anomaly may play a crucial role in\nremoving the gauge dependence in the effective potential in the\nfour-dimensional non-compact manifold. Noting the non-trivial aspects of this\nanomaly computation for a generic scenario, we propose the Heat-Kernel method\nto compute the effective potential where this anomaly emerges as a total\nderivative, thus redundant. We explicitly show how one can calculate the gauge\nindependent, effective action and the Coleman-Weinberg effective potential by\nemploying the Heat-Kernel method. Based on this result, we advocate the\nHeat-Kernel expansion as the most straightforward method, as it naturally deals\nwith the matrix elliptic operator for the calculation of manifestly gauge\nindependent, effective actions compared to other conventional methods.",

Computer-assisted diagnosis systems play a crucial role in timely and\nefficient identification. This study introduces MaxGlaViT, a lightweight model\nbased on the restructured Multi-Axis Vision Transformer (MaxViT) for early\nglaucoma detection. First, MaxViT was scaled to optimize block and channel\nnumbers, resulting in a lighter architecture. Second, the stem was enhanced by\nadding attention mechanisms (CBAM, ECA, SE) after convolution layers to improve\nfeature learning. Third, MBConv structures in MaxViT blocks were replaced by\nadvanced DL blocks (ConvNeXt, ConvNeXtV2, InceptionNeXt). The model was\nevaluated using the HDV1 dataset, containing fundus images of different\nglaucoma stages. Additionally, 40 CNN and 40 ViT models were tested on HDV1 to\nvalidate MaxGlaViT's efficiency. Among CNN models, EfficientB6 achieved the\nhighest accuracy (84.91%), while among ViT models, MaxViT-Tiny performed best\n(86.42%). The scaled MaxViT reached 87.93% accuracy. Adding ECA to the stem\nblock increased accuracy to 89.01%. Replacing MBConv with ConvNeXtV2 further\nimproved it to 89.87%.

    "abstract": "Code generation is a latency-sensitive task that demands high timeliness, but\nthe autoregressive decoding mechanism of Large Language Models (LLMs) leads to\npoor inference efficiency. Existing LLM inference acceleration methods mainly\nfocus on standalone functions using only built-in components. Moreover, they\ntreat code like natural language sequences, ignoring its unique syntax and\nsemantic characteristics. As a result, the effectiveness of these approaches in\ncode generation tasks remains limited and fails to align with real-world\nprogramming scenarios. To alleviate this issue, we propose CodeSwift, a simple\nyet highly efficient inference acceleration approach specifically designed for\ncode generation, without comprising the quality of the output. CodeSwift\nconstructs a multi-source datastore, providing access to both general and\nproject-specific knowledge, facilitating the retrieval of high-quality draft\nsequences. Moreover, CodeSwift reduces retrieval cost by controlling retrieval\ntiming, and enhances efficiency through parallel retrieval and a context- and\nLLM preference-aware cache. Experimental results show that CodeSwift can reach\nup to 2.53x and 2.54x speedup compared to autoregressive decoding in\nrepository-level and standalone code generation tasks, respectively,\noutperforming state-of-the-art inference acceleration approaches by up to 88%.",

    "abstract": "As memory technologies continue to shrink and memory error rates increase,\nthe demand for stronger reliability becomes increasingly critical. Fine-grain\nmemory replication has emerged as an appealing approach to improving memory\nfault tolerance by augmenting conventional memory protection based on\nerror-correcting codes with an additional layer of redundancy that replicates\ndata across independent failure domains, such as replicating memory pages\nacross different NUMA sockets. This method can tolerate a broad spectrum of\nmemory errors, from individual memory cell failures to more complex memory\ncontroller failures. However, applying memory replication without a holistic\nconsideration of the interaction between error-correcting codes and replication\ncan result in redundant duplication and unnecessary storage overhead. We\npropose Replication-Aware Memory-error Protection (RAMP), a model that helps\nexplore error protection strategies to improve the storage efficiency of memory\nprotection in memory systems that utilize memory replication for performance\nand availability. We use RAMP to determine a protection strategy that can lower\nthe storage cost of individual replicas while still ensuring robust protection\nthrough the collective protection conferred by multiple replicas. Our\nevaluation shows that a solution derived with RAMP enhances the storage\nefficiency of a state-of-the-art memory protection mechanism when paired with\nrack-level replication for disaggregated memory. Specifically, we can reduce\nthe storage cost of memory protection from 27% down to 17.7% with minimal\nperformance overhead.",

    "abstract": "The automation of news analysis and summarization presents a promising\nsolution to the challenge of processing and analyzing vast amounts of\ninformation prevalent in today's information society. Large Language Models\n(LLMs) have demonstrated the capability to transform vast amounts of textual\ndata into concise and easily comprehensible summaries, offering an effective\nsolution to the problem of information overload and providing users with a\nquick overview of relevant information. A particularly significant application\nof this technology lies in supply chain risk analysis. Companies must monitor\nthe news about their suppliers and respond to incidents for several critical\nreasons, including compliance with laws and regulations, risk management, and\nmaintaining supply chain resilience. This paper develops an automated news\nsummarization system for supply chain risk analysis using LLMs. The proposed\nsolution aggregates news from various sources, summarizes them using LLMs, and\npresents the condensed information to users in a clear and concise format. This\napproach enables companies to optimize their information processing and make\ninformed decisions. Our study addresses two main research questions: (1) Are\nLLMs effective in automating news summarization, particularly in the context of\nsupply chain risk analysis? (2) How effective are various LLMs in terms of\nreadability, duplicate detection, and risk identification in their\nsummarization quality? In this paper, we conducted an offline study using a\nrange of publicly available LLMs at the time and complemented it with a user\nstudy focused on the top performing systems of the offline experiments to\nevaluate their effectiveness further. Our results demonstrate that LLMs,\nparticularly Few-Shot GPT-4o mini, offer significant improvements in summary\nquality and risk identification.",

A promising way to\nconstrain them is to use the positions of satellite galaxies as tracers of the\nunderlying dark matter, but there are typically too few galaxies per halo for\nreliable shape estimates, resulting in biased shapes. We present a method to\nmodel sampling noise to correct for the shape bias. We compare our predicted\nmedian shape bias with that obtained from the FLAMINGO suite of simulations and\nfind reasonable agreement. We check that our results are robust to resolution\neffects and baryonic feedback. We also explore the validity of our bias\ncorrection at various redshifts and we discuss how our method might be applied\nto observations in the future. We show that median projected halo axis ratios\nare on average biased low by 0.31 when they are traced by only 5 satellites.\nUsing the satellite galaxies, the projected host halo axis ratio can be\ncorrected with a residual bias of ~ 0.1, by accounting for sampling bias.\nHence, about two-thirds of the projected axis ratio bias can be explained by\nsampling noise. This enables the statistical measurement of halo shapes at\nlower masses than previously possible. Our method will also allow improved\nestimates of halo shapes in cosmological simulations using fewer particles than\ncurrently required.",

We validate the\nproposed method across multiple velocity models, including the complex Marmousi\nand Overthrust models, and demonstrate its superior accuracy, faster\nconvergence, and better robustness features compared to both traditional PINNs\nand earlier Gabor-based PINNs.

Recent literature has\nshown that hyperbolic tree embeddings can even be placed on top of neural\nnetworks for hierarchical knowledge integration in deep learning settings. For\nall applications, a faithful embedding of trees is needed, with combinatorial\nconstructions emerging as the most effective direction. This paper identifies\nand solves two key limitations of existing works. First, the combinatorial\nconstruction hinges on finding highly separated points on a hypersphere, a\nnotoriously difficult problem. Current approaches achieve poor separation,\ndegrading the quality of the corresponding hyperbolic embedding. We propose\nhighly separated Delaunay tree embeddings (HS-DTE), which integrates angular\nseparation in a generalized formulation of Delaunay embeddings, leading to\nlower embedding distortion. Second, low-distortion requires additional\nprecision. The current approach for increasing precision is to use multiple\nprecision arithmetic, which renders the embeddings useless on GPUs in deep\nlearning settings.

LettuceDetect\nis a token-classification model that processes context-question-answer triples,\nallowing for the identification of unsupported claims at the token level.\nEvaluations on the RAGTruth corpus demonstrate an F1 score of 79.22% for\nexample-level detection, which is a 14.8% improvement over Luna, the previous\nstate-of-the-art encoder-based architecture. Additionally, the system can\nprocess 30 to 60 examples per second on a single GPU, making it more practical\nfor real-world RAG applications.",

In this paper, we propose FLORAL, a novel adversarial\ntraining defense strategy based on support vector machines (SVMs) to counter\nthese threats. Utilizing a bilevel optimization framework, we cast the training\nprocess as a non-zero-sum Stackelberg game between an attacker, who\nstrategically poisons critical training labels, and the model, which seeks to\nrecover from such attacks. Our approach accommodates various model\narchitectures and employs a projected gradient descent algorithm with kernel\nSVMs for adversarial training. We provide a theoretical analysis of our\nalgorithm's convergence properties and empirically evaluate FLORAL's\neffectiveness across diverse classification tasks. Compared to robust baselines\nand foundation models such as RoBERTa, FLORAL consistently achieves higher\nrobust accuracy under increasing attacker budgets.

    "abstract": "Photoinduced electronic transitions are complex quantum-mechanical processes\nwhere electrons move between energy levels due to light absorption. This\ninduces dynamics in electronic structure and nuclear geometry, driving\nimportant physical and chemical processes in fields like photobiology,\nmaterials design, and medicine. The evolving electronic structure can be\ncharacterized by two electron density fields: hole and particle natural\ntransition orbitals (NTOs). Studying these density fields helps understand\nelectronic charge movement between donor and acceptor regions within a\nmolecule. Previous works rely on side-by-side visual comparisons of\nisosurfaces, statistical approaches, or bivariate field analysis with few\ninstances. We propose a new method to analyze time-varying bivariate fields\nwith many instances, which is relevant for understanding electronic structure\nchanges during light-induced dynamics. Since NTO fields depend on nuclear\ngeometry, the nuclear motion results in numerous time steps to analyze. This\npaper presents a structured approach to feature-directed visual exploration of\ntime-varying bivariate fields using continuous scatterplots (CSPs) and image\nmoment-based descriptors, tailored for studying evolving electronic structures\npost-photoexcitation. The CSP of the bivariate field at each time step is\nrepresented by a four-length image moment vector. The collection of all vector\ndescriptors forms a point cloud in R^4, visualized using principal component\nanalysis. Selecting appropriate principal components results in a\nrepresentation of the point cloud as a curve on the plane, aiding tasks such as\nidentifying key time steps, recognizing patterns within the bivariate field,\nand tracking the temporal evolution. We demonstrate this with two case studies\non excited-state molecular dynamics, showing how bivariate field analysis\nprovides application-specific insights.",

This new\nparadigm is referred to as fluid RIS (FRIS). We investigate an\nFRIS-programmable wireless channel, where the fluid meta-surface is divided\ninto non-overlapping subareas, each acting as a fluid element that can\ndynamically adjust both its position and phase shift of the reflected signal.\nWe first analyze the single-user, single-input single-output (SU-SISO) channel,\nin which a single-antenna transmitter communicates with a single-antenna\nreceiver via an FRIS. The achievable rate is maximized by optimizing the fluid\nelements using a particle swarm optimization (PSO)- based approach. Next, we\nextend our analysis to the multi-user, multiple-input single-output (MU-MISO)\ncase, where a multi-antenna base station (BS) transmits individual data streams\nto multiple single-antenna users via an FRIS. In this case, the joint\noptimization of the positions and phase shifts of the FRIS element, as well as\nthe BS precoding to maximize the sum-rate is studied.

In the first part of the\npaper we show that $KG(R)\\leq KG(A)$ where $KG$ denotes the Krull-Gabriel\ndimension.

We use\nnumerical magnetohydrodynamics simulations in the thin-disk limit (FEOSAD code)\nto model the formation and long-term evolution of a gravitationally unstable\nmagnetized protoplanetary disk, including dust dynamics and growth, since the\ncollapse of a massive slowly-rotating prestellar cloud core. Massive gas\nconcentrations and dust rings form within the inner disk region owing to the\nradially varying efficiency of mass transport by gravitational instability\n(GI). These rings are initially susceptible to streaming instability (SI).\nHowever, gradual warming of the dust rings, thanks to high opacity and\nGI-induced influx of matter increases the gas temperature above a threshold for\nthe MRI to develop via thermal ionization of alkaline metals. The ensuing MRI\nbursts destroy the dust rings, making planetesimal formation via SI\nproblematic. In the later evolution phase, when the burst activity starts to\ndiminish, SI becomes inefficient because of growing dust drift velocity and\nmore extended inner dead zone, both acting to reduce the dust concentration\nbelow the threshold for SI to develop. Low-mass objects appear to be less\naffected by these adverse effects.

This results in a significantly\nprolonged coalescence initiation time compared to the isothermal case. In both\ncases, pressure extends the liquid-vapor interface in opposite directions,\npromoting the growth of the liquid bridge. (2) TNE effects: Latent heat-induced\ntemperature rise significantly refrains the TNE intensity in thermal case.\nBefore and after droplet contact, non-equilibrium quantities driven by the\ntemperature gradient and those driven by the velocity gradient, alternate in\ndominating the coalescence process. This competition and interplay result in a\nmore complex spatial and spatiotemporal evolution of TNE effects compared to\nthe isothermal case. (3) Entropy production mechanisms: In the non-isothermal\ncase, entropy production is contributed not only by $\\bm {\\Delta}^{\\ast}_2$ but\nalso by $\\bm {\\Delta}^{\\ast}_{3,1}$, with the former being the dominant\ncontributor. The temperature field reduces the entropy production rate, while\nextends its duration, and increases the total entropy production. This research\nprovides kinetic insights for dynamic, cross-scale regulation and\nmultifunctional integration of coalescence processes in industrial\napplications.",

We carry out a comprehensive exploration on the\nmagnetized gravitational collapse of a non-rotating self-gravitating initially\nspherically symmetric prestellar cloud core using two-dimensional nonideal\nmagnetohydrodynamic simulations incorporating ambipolar diffusion and Ohmic\ndissipation. Our study encompasses a broader range of equations of state (EOSs)\nin the form of $P(\\rho) \\propto \\rho^{\\Gamma}$, with the aim of constraining\nthe choice of EOSs for allowing star formation. Our results reveal that the\ncollapse with a $\\Gamma$ no stiffer than $4/3$, complemented by magnetized\nvirial theorem, allows the dynamical contraction of the prestellar core to\nhappen continuously where a central point mass forms and steadily builds up its\nmass from the infalling envelope, with a mass accretion rate of a scale of the\norder of $c_{\\rm s}^3/G$. The choice of an isothermal EOS most naturally\nfacilitates the collapse as a magnetic analog of the inside-out collapse. In\naddition to that, our study exhibits that the nonisothermal magnetized collapse\nmodels with a $\\Gamma$ no stiffer than 4/3 qualitatively demonstrate similar\ninfall features to those of an isothermal EOS. Furthermore, the collapse models\nwith a $\\Gamma$ stiffer than $4/3$ fail to ensure the sufficient cooling to\nallow the direct mass growth of the central point mass, thus delaying the\ninfall.

Moreover, the orientation adjustment of the\nRA is guided by the user's direction information provided by the visual\nrecognition module, thereby significantly enhancing system response speed and\nself-orientation accuracy. The experimental results demonstrate that the\nRA-enabled communication system achieves significant improvement in\ncommunication coverage performance compared to the conventional fixed antenna\nsystem.",

Bicontinuous emulsion gels stabilized\nby colloidal particles, called bijels, are attractive materials in soft-matter\nas they combine bulk properties of two immiscible liquids into an interwoven\nnetwork structure. The limited understanding of the complex formation phenomena\nof bijels restricts the control over the synthesis, and so its applicability.\nIn this work, in-situ (ultra-) small-angle X-ray scattering is applied to gain\ninsight into the phase separation and self-assembly kinetics of bijels formed\nvia solvent transfer induced phase separation. An X-ray compatible microfluidic\nsetup allows accessing the process kinetics with a millisecond resolution. The\nformation of such bijels is shown to occur via three consecutive steps related\nto fluid mechanics, nanoparticle self-assembly and liquid-liquid phase\nseparation. This time-resolved monitor technique offers valuable insights into\nthe structural evolution of kinetically controlled materials and enhances our\nunderstanding of the formation of bicontinuous emulsion gels.",

Here, through symmetry analysis, we\npropose a general stacking rule, characterized by a connection operator linking\ntwo stacked bilayers, for controlling unconventional magnetism via sliding\nferroelectricity. Such rule enables the simultaneous switching of both electric\npolarization and nonrelativistic spin splitting or anomalous Hall effect in\naltermagnets, a class of collinear unconventional magnets. By comprehensively\nsurveying the 80 layer groups, we identify all the stacking orders that allow\nfor such two types of simultaneous switching. Furthermore, we extend the\nstacking rule to collinear compensated ferrimagnets, where the opposite-spin\nsublattices are not connected by any symmetry operator, yet the net\nmagnetization remains zero. Combined with first-principles calculations, we\ndemonstrate the sliding ferroelectric control of spin polarization and\nanomalous Hall effect in the altermagnetic AgF2 and Fe2MoSe4 bilayers. Our work\nprovides a symmetry strategy for achieving ferroelectric control of\nunconventional magnetism in bilayer systems and opens avenues for exploring new\ntypes of magnetoelectric coupling.",

In particular, we initiate our research of PGen with face video\ncoding, and PGen offers a paradigm shift that prioritizes high-fidelity\nreconstruction over pursuing compact bitstream. The novel PGen framework\nleverages scalable representation and layered reconstruction for Generative\nFace Video Compression (GFVC), in an attempt to imbue the bitstream with\nintelligence in different granularity. Experimental results illustrate that the\nproposed PGen framework can facilitate existing GFVC algorithms to better\ndeliver high-fidelity and faithful face videos. In addition, the proposed\nframework can allow a greater space of flexibility for coding applications and\nshow superior RD performance with a much wider bitrate range in terms of\nvarious quality evaluations. Moreover, in comparison with the latest Versatile\nVideo Coding (VVC) codec, the proposed scheme achieves competitive\nBj{\\o}ntegaard-delta-rate savings for perceptual-level evaluations.",

Through explicit construction of a network local hidden\nstate model derived from numerical results and incorporation of the\nentanglement properties of network assemblages, we analytically demonstrate\nthat the network steering thresholds are determined by the curve $\\nu \\omega =\n{1}/{3}$ under the corresponding configuration.",

    ],
    "abstract": "Extended irreversible thermodynamics is a theory that extends the classical\nframework of nonequilibrium thermodynamics by going beyond the\nlocal-equilibrium assumption. A notable example of this is the Maxwell-Cattaneo\nheat flux model, which introduces a time lag in the heat flux response to\ntemperature gradients. In this paper, we develop a variational formulation of\nthe equations of extended irreversible thermodynamics by introducing an action\nprinciple for a nonequilibrium Lagrangian that treats thermodynamic fluxes as\nindependent variables. A key feature of this approach is that it naturally\nextends both Hamilton's principle of reversible continuum mechanics and the\nearlier variational formulation of classical irreversible thermodynamics. The\nvariational principle is initially formulated in the material (Lagrangian)\ndescription, from which the Eulerian form is derived using material covariance\n(or relabeling symmetries). The tensorial structure of the thermodynamic fluxes\ndictates the choice of objective rate in the Eulerian description, leading to\nthe introduction of nonequilibrium stresses arising from both viscous and\nthermal effects to ensure thermodynamic consistency. This framework naturally\nresults in the Cattaneo-Christov model for heat flux. We also investigate the\nextension of the approach to accommodate higher-order fluxes and the general\nform of entropy fluxes. The variational framework presented in this paper has\npromising applications in the development of structure-preserving and\nthermodynamically consistent numerical methods. It is particularly relevant for\nmodeling systems where entropy production is a delicate issue that requires\ncareful treatment to ensure consistency with the laws of thermodynamics.",

    "abstract": "Weak $\\infty$-categories are known to be more expressive than their strict\ncounterparts, but are more difficult to work with, as constructions in such a\ncategory involve the manipulation of explicit coherence data. This motivates\nthe search for definitions of semistrict $\\infty$-categories, where some, but\nnot all, of the operations have been strictified.\n  We introduce a general framework for adding definitional equality to the type\ntheory $\\mathsf{Catt}$, a type theory whose models correspond to globular weak\n$\\infty$-categories, which was introduced by Finster and Mimram. Adding\nequality to this theory causes the models to exhibit semistrict behaviour,\ntrivialising some operations while leaving others weak. The framework consists\nof a generalisation of $\\mathsf{Catt}$ extended with an equality relation\ngenerated by an arbitrary set of equality rules $\\mathcal{R}$, which we name\n$\\mathsf{Catt}_{\\mathcal{R}}$. We study this framework in detail, formalising\nmuch of its metatheory in the proof assistant Agda, and studying how certain\noperations of $\\mathsf{Catt}$ behave in the presence of definitional equality.\n  We use this framework to introduce two type theories,\n$\\mathsf{Catt}_{\\mathsf{su}}$ and $\\mathsf{Catt}_{\\mathsf{sua}}$, which are\ninstances of this general framework. Further, we provide terminating and\nconfluent reduction systems that generate the equality of both systems. We\ntherefore prove that the equality, and hence typechecking, of both theories is\ndecidable. This is used to give an implementation of these type theories, which\nuses an approach inspired by normalisation by evaluation to efficiently find\nnormal forms for terms. We further introduce a bidirectional typechecking\nalgorithm used by the implementation which allows for terms to be defined in a\nconvenient syntax where many arguments can be left implicit.",

We hypothesize an\ninverted U-shaped relationship between educational assortative mating and SAG,\nwhere, keeping the husband's education constant at the graduation level, the\nSAG first widens and then narrows as the wife's education level increases from\nprimary to postgraduate. This pattern is shaped by distinct socio-economic\nfactors across rural and urban settings. In rural India, increasing prosperity,\nchanges in family structure, and educational hypergamy contribute to a wider\nage gap, with the influence of bride squeeze further exacerbating this\ndisparity. Conversely, in urban areas, while the growth of white-collar jobs\ninitially contributed to a narrowing of the SAG in 2004-05, this trend did not\npersist by 2011-12.

To address these limitations, we propose\nStable-SPAM, which incorporates enhanced gradient normalization and clipping\ntechniques.

The primary\nchallenge is accurately segmenting and modeling the behaviors of diverse\npassenger groups within a large-scale, noisy dataset while maintaining\ncomputational efficiency and scalability. HF networks, representing the top 25%\nof travelers by usage frequency, exhibit high connectivity with an average\nclustering coefficient of 0.72 and greater node degree centrality.

In\ncontrast, LF networks, which include 75% of travelers, are more dispersed yet\nresilient, with efficiency declining by only 10% under similar disruptions and\nstronger intracommunity connectivity. Temporal analysis reveals that HF\npassengers significantly contribute to peak-hour congestion, with 57.4% of HF\ntrips occurring between 6:00 and 10:00 AM, while LF passengers show a broader\ntemporal distribution, helping to mitigate congestion hotspots.

Current approaches often rely on 3D coordinate information and/or\nadditional data (e.g., images and scanning viewpoints) to fill in missing\nparts. Unlike these methods, we explore self-structure augmentation and propose\nPointSea for global-to-local point cloud completion. In the global stage,\nconsider how we inspect a defective region of a physical object, we may observe\nit from various perspectives for a better understanding. Inspired by this,\nPointSea augments data representation by leveraging self-projected depth images\nfrom multiple views. To reconstruct a compact global shape from the cross-modal\ninput, we incorporate a feature fusion module to fuse features at both\nintra-view and inter-view levels. In the local stage, to reveal highly detailed\nstructures, we introduce a point generator called the self-structure\ndual-generator. This generator integrates both learned shape priors and\ngeometric self-similarities for shape refinement. Unlike existing efforts that\napply a unified strategy for all points, our dual-path design adapts refinement\nstrategies conditioned on the structural type of each point, addressing the\nspecific incompleteness of each point. Comprehensive experiments on widely-used\nbenchmarks demonstrate that PointSea effectively understands global shapes and\ngenerates local details from incomplete input, showing clear improvements over\nexisting methods.",

In contrast to previous studies\nfocused on narrow-band CFmMIMO systems, this paper studies wideband CFmMIMO\ncommunications against channel frequency selectivity. By exploiting the\nfrequency-domain flexibility offered by orthogonal frequency-division\nmultiplexing (OFDM), and leveraging a particular spatial characteristic in the\ncell-free structure -- namely, the near-far effect among distributed access\npoints (APs) -- we propose an opportunistic approach to boost spectral\nefficiency. The core concept lies in opportunistically activating nearby APs\nfor certain users across their assigned OFDM subcarriers while deactivating\ndistant APs to prevent power wastage and lower inter-user interference.\nFurthermore, this approach enables the use of downlink pilots by reducing the\nnumber of active APs per subcarrier to a small subset, thereby substantially\nimproving downlink performance through coherent detection at the user receiver.\nVerified by numerical results, our proposed approach demonstrates considerable\nperformance improvement compared to the two benchmark approaches.",

We propose a financial\nstress-testing framework for micro- and macro-prudential applications that\nfeatures a national firm level supply chain network in combination with\ninterbank network layers. The model is calibrated by using a unique data set\nincluding about 1 million firm-level supply links, practically all bank-firm\nloans, and all interbank loans in a small European economy. As a showcase we\nimplement a real COVID-19 shock scenario on the firm level. This model allows\nus to study how the disruption dynamics in the real economy can lead to\ninterbank solvency contagion dynamics. We estimate to what extent this\namplifies financial systemic risk. We discuss the relative importance of these\ncontagion channels and find an increase of interbank contagion by 70% when\nproduction network contagion is present. We then examine the financial systemic\nrisk firms bring to banks and find an increase of up to 28% in the presence of\nthe interbank contagion channel.

To achieve\nlow-cost V2I, reducing the cost of LiDAR is crucial. Therefore, we study\nadopting low-resolution LiDAR on the vehicle to minimize cost as much as\npossible. However, simply reducing the resolution of vehicle's LiDAR results in\nsparse point clouds, making distant small objects even more blurred.\nAdditionally, traditional communication methods have relatively low bandwidth\nutilization efficiency. These factors pose challenges for us. To balance cost\nand perceptual accuracy, we propose a new collaborative perception framework,\nnamely LCV2I. LCV2I uses data collected from cameras and low-resolution LiDAR\nas input. It also employs feature offset correction modules and regional\nfeature enhancement algorithms to improve feature representation. Finally, we\nuse regional difference map and regional score map to assess the value of\ncollaboration content, thereby improving communication bandwidth efficiency. In\nsummary, our approach achieves high perceptual performance while substantially\nreducing the demand for high-resolution sensors on the vehicle. To evaluate\nthis algorithm, we conduct 3D object detection in the real-world scenario of\nDAIR-V2X, demonstrating that the performance of LCV2I consistently surpasses\ncurrently existing algorithms.",

    "abstract": "As short videos have become the primary form of content consumption across\nvarious industries, accurately predicting their popularity has become key to\nenhancing user engagement and optimizing business strategies. This report\npresents a solution for the 2024 INFORMS Data Mining Challenge, focusing on our\ndeveloped 3M model (Multi-modal and Metadata Capture Model), which is a\nmulti-modal popularity prediction model. The 3M model integrates video, audio,\ndescriptions, and metadata to fully explore the multidimensional information of\nshort videos. We employ a retriever-based method to retrieve relevant instances\nfrom a multi-modal memory bank, filtering similar videos based on visual,\nacoustic, and text-based features for prediction. Additionally, we apply a\nrandom masking method combined with a semi-supervised model for incomplete\nmulti-modalities to leverage the metadata of videos. Ultimately, we use a\nnetwork to synthesize both approaches, significantly improving the accuracy of\npredictions. Compared to traditional tag-based algorithms, our model\noutperforms existing methods on the validation set, showing a notable increase\nin prediction accuracy. Our research not only offers a new perspective on\nunderstanding the drivers of short video popularity but also provides valuable\ndata support for identifying market opportunities, optimizing advertising\nstrategies, and enhancing content creation.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable in-context learning\n(ICL) abilities. However, existing theoretical analysis of ICL primarily\nexhibits two limitations: (a) Limited i.i.d. Setting. Most studies focus on\nsupervised function learning tasks where prompts are constructed with i.i.d.\ninput-label pairs. This i.i.d. assumption diverges significantly from real\nlanguage learning scenarios where prompt tokens are interdependent. (b) Lack of\nEmergence Explanation. Most literature answers what ICL does from an implicit\noptimization perspective but falls short in elucidating how ICL emerges and the\nimpact of pre-training phase on ICL. In our paper, to extend (a), we adopt a\nmore practical paradigm, auto-regressive next-token prediction (AR-NTP), which\nclosely aligns with the actual training of language models. Specifically,\nwithin AR-NTP, we emphasize prompt token-dependency, which involves predicting\neach subsequent token based on the preceding sequence. To address (b), we\nformalize a systematic pre-training and ICL framework, highlighting the\nlayer-wise structure of sequences and topics, alongside a two-level\nexpectation. In conclusion, we present data-dependent, topic-dependent and\noptimization-dependent PAC-Bayesian generalization bounds for pre-trained LLMs,\ninvestigating that ICL emerges from the generalization of sequences and topics.\nOur theory is supported by experiments on numerical linear dynamic systems,\nsynthetic GINC and real-world language datasets.",

The DSA\nintroduces several specific requirements for online advertising. First, the DSA\nimposes transparency requirements in relation to advertisements. Second, very\nlarge online platforms (VLOPs) should develop a publicly available repository\nwith information about the ads they presented. Third, the DSA bans\nprofiling-based advertising (behavioural advertising) if it uses sensitive data\nor if it targets children. Besides these specific provisions, the general rules\nof the DSA on illegal content also apply to advertising. Advertisements are a\nform of information, and thus subject to the general DSA rules. Moreover, we\nconclude that the DSA applies to some types of ad tech companies. For example,\nad networks, companies that connect advertisers to publishers of apps and\nwebsites, should be considered platforms. Some ad networks may even qualify as\nVLOPs. Hence, ad networks must comply with the more general obligations in the\nDSA. The application of these general rules to advertisements and ad networks\ncan have far-reaching effects that have been underexplored and deserve further\nresearch.

For linear\ncake-eating problems, we obtain monotonicity results for the optimal value\nfunction and a conditional monotonicity result for optimal decision rules. We\nalso introduce the concept of a two-phase linear cake eating problem and obtain\na necessary condition that must be satisfied by all solutions of such problems.\nWe show that for a class of linear dynamic optimization problems, known as\ninterlinked linear dynamic optimization problems, a slightly modified version\nof the functional equation of dynamic programming is satisfied.",

    "abstract": "Financial bond yield forecasting is challenging due to data scarcity,\nnonlinear macroeconomic dependencies, and evolving market conditions. In this\npaper, we propose a novel framework that leverages Causal Generative\nAdversarial Networks (CausalGANs) and Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) reinforcement\nlearning (RL) to generate high-fidelity synthetic bond yield data for four\nmajor bond categories (AAA, BAA, US10Y, Junk). By incorporating 12 key\nmacroeconomic variables, we ensure statistical fidelity by preserving essential\nmarket properties. To transform this market dependent synthetic data into\nactionable insights, we employ a finetuned Large Language Model (LLM)\nQwen2.5-7B that generates trading signals (BUY/HOLD/SELL), risk assessments,\nand volatility projections. We use automated, human and LLM evaluations, all of\nwhich demonstrate that our framework improves forecasting performance over\nexisting methods, with statistical validation via predictive accuracy, MAE\nevaluation(0.103%), profit/loss evaluation (60% profit rate), LLM evaluation\n(3.37/5) and expert assessments scoring 4.67 out of 5. The reinforcement\nlearning-enhanced synthetic data generation achieves the least Mean Absolute\nError of 0.103, demonstrating its effectiveness in replicating real-world bond\nmarket dynamics. We not only enhance data-driven trading strategies but also\nprovides a scalable, high-fidelity synthetic financial data pipeline for risk &\nvolatility management and investment decision-making. This work establishes a\nbridge between synthetic data generation, LLM driven financial forecasting, and\nlanguage model evaluation, contributing to AI-driven financial decision-making.",

Previously\nknown reductions relied on unproven assumptions such as the generalized Riemann\nhypothesis. In this work, we present unconditional reductions, and extend this\nnetwork of equivalences to the problem of computing the lattice of all\nisogenies between two supersingular elliptic curves (HomModule).For\ncryptographic applications, one requires computational problems to be hard on\naverage for random instances. It is well-known that if Isogeny is hard (in the\nworst case), then it is hard for random instances. We extend this result by\nproving that if any of the above-mentionned classical problems is hard in the\nworst case, then all of them are hard on average. In particular, if there exist\nhard instances of Isogeny, then all of Isogeny, EndRing, MaxOrder and HomModule\nare hard on average.",

    "abstract": "Distributed methods are essential for handling machine learning pipelines\ncomprising large-scale models and datasets. However, their benefits often come\nat the cost of increased communication overhead between the central server and\nagents, which can become the main bottleneck, making training costly or even\nunfeasible in such systems. Compression methods such as quantization and\nsparsification can alleviate this issue. Still, their robustness to large and\nheavy-tailed gradient noise, a phenomenon sometimes observed in language\nmodeling, remains poorly understood. This work addresses this gap by analyzing\nDistributed Compressed SGD (DCSGD) and Distributed SignSGD (DSignSGD) using\nstochastic differential equations (SDEs). Our results show that DCSGD with\nunbiased compression is more vulnerable to noise in stochastic gradients, while\nDSignSGD remains robust, even under large and heavy-tailed noise. Additionally,\nwe propose new scaling rules for hyperparameter tuning to mitigate performance\ndegradation due to compression. These findings are empirically validated across\nmultiple deep learning architectures and datasets, providing practical\nrecommendations for distributed optimization.",

To unleash the potential of CIM accelerators, many\ncompilation methods have been proposed, focusing on application scheduling\noptimization specific to CIM. However, existing compilation methods often\noverlook CIM's capability to switch dynamically between compute and memory\nmodes, which is crucial for accommodating the diverse memory and computational\nneeds of real-world deep neural network architectures, especially the emerging\nlarge language models. To fill this gap, we introduce CMSwitch, a novel\ncompiler to optimize resource allocation for CIM accelerators with adaptive\nmode-switching capabilities, thereby enhancing the performance of DNN\napplications. Specifically, our approach integrates the compute-memory mode\nswitch into the CIM compilation optimization space by introducing a new\nhardware abstraction attribute. Then, we propose a novel compilation\noptimization pass that identifies the optimal network segment and the\ncorresponding mode resource allocations using dynamic programming and\nmixed-integer programming. CMSwitch uses the tailored meta-operator to express\nthe compilation result in a generalized manner. Evaluation results demonstrate\nthat CMSwitch achieves an average speedup of 1.31$\\times$ compared to existing\nSOTA CIM compilation works, highlighting CMSwitch's effectiveness in fully\nexploiting the potential of CIM processors for a wide range of real-world DNN\napplications.",

We investigate the\nunconventional superconductivity in the kagome superconductor\n$\\mathrm{CsV_3Sb_5}$, focusing on the emergence of charge-$6e$\nsuperconductivity (SC) at temperatures higher than the conventional charge-$2e$\nSC state. By modeling the phase coherence of the SC order parameter using a\nfrustrated antiferromagnetic XY model on an emergent kagome lattice, we show\nthat the condensation of fractional vortices with $1/3$ vorticity stabilizes\nphase coherence in $\\exp(i3\\theta)$, giving rise to the charge-$6e$ SC state.\nUsing a tensor network approach tailored for frustrated spin systems, we\nidentify a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition at $T_c/J \\simeq 0.075$,\nwhere the unbinding of $1/3$ fractional vortex-antivortex pairs transforms the\nsystem from the charge-$6e$ SC phase to the normal phase. Below $T_c$, the\n$1/3$ fractional vortex correlations exhibit power-law decay, while the integer\nvortex correlations decay exponentially, reflecting the dominance of\ncharge-$6e$ SC in the absence of charge-$2e$ SC.

They work together with models that\nprocess data like images, enabling cross-modal understanding. However, existing\napproaches often suffer from the echo chamber effect, where redundant visual\npatterns reduce model generalization and accuracy. Thus, the proposed system\nconsidered this limitation and developed an enhanced LLM-based framework for\ncross-modal query understanding using DL-KeyBERT-based CAZSSCL-MPGPT. The\ncollected dataset consists of pre-processed images and texts. The preprocessed\nimages then undergo object segmentation using Easom-You Only Look Once\n(E-YOLO). The object skeleton is generated, along with the knowledge graph\nusing a Conditional Random Knowledge Graph (CRKG) technique. Further, features\nare extracted from the knowledge graph, generated skeletons, and segmented\nobjects. The optimal features are then selected using the Fossa Optimization\nAlgorithm (FOA). Meanwhile, the text undergoes word embedding using DL-KeyBERT.\nFinally, the cross-modal query understanding system utilizes CAZSSCL-MPGPT to\ngenerate accurate and contextually relevant image descriptions as text. The\nproposed CAZSSCL-MPGPT achieved an accuracy of 99.14187362% in the COCO dataset\n2017 and 98.43224393% in the vqav2-val dataset.",

Integrating an arbitrary style transfer method into\nthe game pipeline is challenging due to the memory and speed requirements of\ngames. We present PQDAST, the first solution to address this. We use a\nperceptual quality-guided knowledge distillation framework and train a\ncompressed model using the FLIP evaluator, which substantially reduces both\nmemory usage and processing time with limited impact on stylisation quality.\nFor better preservation of depth and fine details, we utilise a synthetic\ndataset with depth and temporal considerations during training.

Therefore, states occupied by core nucleons should\nbe blocked for the valence nucleons. We aim to study $^{17}$C and $^{19}$C,\nwhich are good examples of weakly bound exotic nuclei with significant\ndeformation where the valence shell is partially filled. The structure of\n$^{17}$C and $^{19}$C is described with deformed two-body models where a\nNilsson Hamiltonian is constructed using Antisymmetrized Molecular Dynamic\ncalculations of the cores. Different methods of blocking occupied Nilsson\nstates are considered using the Bardeen$-$Cooper$-$Schrieffer formalism:\nwithout blocking, total blocking and partial blocking. The latter also takes\ninto account pair correlations to some extent. These models are later used to\nstudy $^{16}$C$(d,p)^{17}$C, $^{17}$C$(p,d)^{16}$C and $^{18}$C$(d,p)^{19}$C\ntransfer reactions within the Adiabatic Distorted Wave Approximation. In the\nfirst case, the results are compared with experimental data. A good\nreproduction of the structure of $^{17}$C is found, significantly improving the\nagreement in the $^{16}$C$(d,p)^{17}$C reaction including blocking effects. The\n$^{19}$C spectrum is better reproduced considering blocking, in particular, the\npartial blocking method that considers the pairing interaction provides the\nbest description.

    "abstract": "We introduce MAIA (Multimodal AI Assessment), a native-Italian benchmark\ndesigned for fine-grained investigation of the reasoning abilities of visual\nlanguage models on videos. MAIA differs from other available video benchmarks\nfor its design, its reasoning categories, the metric it uses, and the language\nand culture of the videos. MAIA evaluates Vision Language Models (VLMs) on two\naligned tasks: a visual statement verification task and an open-ended visual\nquestion-answering task, both on the same set of video-related questions. It\nconsiders twelve reasoning categories that aim to disentangle language and\nvision relations by highlighting the role of the visual input. Thanks to its\ncarefully taught design, it evaluates VLMs' consistency and visually grounded\nnatural language comprehension and generation simultaneously through an\naggregated metric revealing low results that highlight models' fragility. Last\nbut not least, the video collection has been carefully selected to reflect the\nItalian culture, and the language data are produced by native-speakers.",

Methods: This study integrated a\nsingle-shot 3D True FISP readout sequence for efficient whole-brain CEST data\nacquisition. A streamlined workflow was developed to acquire B0, B1, and T1\nmaps for correction. To overcome the time-consuming nature of traditional B1\ncorrection, we implemented a machine learning-based method to perform rapid B1\ncorrection using data from a single B1 power acquisition. Data were analyzed\nusing a four-pool Lorentzian model to derive quantitative metrics, including\nMTRLD and the AREX. The method's accuracy was validated in phantoms and its\ntest-retest reproducibility was assessed in healthy volunteers across 96 brain\nregions. Results: The True FISP sequence acquired high-quality, whole-brain\nimages free of major artifacts. The neural network accurately replicated the\ngold-standard three-point B1 correction, achieving excellent intraclass\ncorrelation (ICC > 0.97) in human subjects. The AREX metric successfully\ncorrected for T1 and MT confounders, reducing the CV from 33.6% to 6.9% in\nphantoms. The complete pipeline, including Z-spectrum and correction maps, took\napproximately 9 minutes. The method demonstrated high region-level\nreproducibility, with the average CV for APT_AREX under 10% for most brain\nregions across test-retest scans. Conclusion: This study presents a validated,\nend-to-end solution for whole-brain, multi-pool CEST imaging. By combining an\nefficient sequence with a rapid, AI-driven correction pipeline and robust\nquantitative analysis, our method delivers high-fidelity, reproducible, and\nquantitative multi-parameter maps of brain metabolism in a clinically\nacceptable timeframe.",

    "abstract": "Function-correcting codes, introduced by Lenz, Bitar, Wachter-Zeh, and\nYaakobi, protect specific function values of a message rather than the entire\nmessage. A central challenge is determining the optimal redundancy -- the\nminimum additional information required to recover function values amid errors.\nThis redundancy depends on both the number of correctable errors $t$ and the\nstructure of message vectors yielding identical function values. While prior\nworks established bounds, key questions remain, such as the optimal redundancy\nfor functions like Hamming weight and Hamming weight distribution, along with\nefficient code constructions. In this paper, we make the following\ncontributions:\n  (1) For the Hamming weight function, we improve the lower bound on optimal\nredundancy from $\\frac{10(t-1)}{3}$ to $4t - \\frac{4}{3}\\sqrt{6t+2} + 2$. On\nthe other hand, we provide a systematical approach to constructing explicit\nFCCs via a novel connection with Gray codes, which also improve the previous\nupper bound from $\\frac{4t-2}{1 - 2\\sqrt{\\log{2t}/(2t)}}$ to $4t - \\log{t}$.\nConsequently, we almost determine the optimal redundancy for Hamming weight\nfunction.\n  (2) The Hamming weight distribution function is defined by the value of\nHamming weight divided by a given positive integer $T$. Previous work\nestablished that the optimal redundancy is $2t$ when $T > 2t$, while the case\n$T \\le 2t$ remained unclear. We show that the optimal redundancy remains $2t$\nwhen $T \\ge t+1$. However, in the surprising regime where $T = o(t)$, we\nachieve near-optimal redundancy of $4t - o(t)$. Our results reveal a\nsignificant distinction in behavior of redundancy for distinct choices of $T$.",

These techniques allow Muon to work\nout-of-the-box on large-scale training without the need of hyper-parameter\ntuning.

These rules can often be written in the form of a\nGauss law, indicating the local conservation of an emergent electric field. In\nreciprocal space, these emergent Gauss laws appear as singularities known as\npinch points, that are accessible to neutron-scattering measurements. But more\nexotic forms of electromagnetism have been stabilized in spin liquids, and in a\nfew rare instances, these zero-dimensional singularities have been extended\ninto one-dimensional pinch lines. Here we propose a simple framework for the\ndesign of pinch-line spin liquids in a layered structure of two-dimensional\nalgebraic spin liquids. A plethora of models can be build within this\nframework, as exemplified by several concrete examples where our theory is\nconfirmed by simulations, and where the rank of the tensorial gauge field is\ncontinuously varied along the pinch line, opening new avenues in fractonic\nmatter. Then we use our framework to understand how the evolution of the\nsingularity pinch point along the pinch line can be understood as the\ninterference pattern of two emergent electric fields. Finally, we apply our\nintuition on these emergent electric fields in real space to generic pinch line\nmodels beyond our layered framework, and revisit the recently proposed pinch\nline model on the octochlore lattice.",

With an aim to get more\ngeneral and practical grasp models, in this paper, we investigate the problem\nnamed Task-Oriented 6-DoF Grasp Pose Detection in Clutters (TO6DGC), which\nextends the task-oriented problem to a more general 6-DOF Grasp Pose Detection\nin Cluttered (multi-object) scenario. To this end, we construct a large-scale\n6-DoF task-oriented grasping dataset, 6-DoF Task Grasp (6DTG), which features\n4391 cluttered scenes with over 2 million 6-DoF grasp poses. Each grasp is\nannotated with a specific task, involving 6 tasks and 198 objects in total.\nMoreover, we propose One-Stage TaskGrasp (OSTG), a strong baseline to address\nthe TO6DGC problem.

    "abstract": "Terahertz (THz) communication technology is regarded as a promising enabler\nfor achieving ultra-high data rate transmission in next-generation\ncommunication systems. To mitigate the high path loss in THz systems, the\ntransmitting beams are typically narrow and highly directional, which makes it\ndifficult for a single beam to serve multiple users simultaneously. To address\nthis challenge, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS), which can\ndynamically manipulate the wireless propagation environment, have been\nintegrated into THz communication systems to extend coverage. Existing works\nmostly remain theoretical analysis and simulation, while prototype validation\nof RIS-assisted THz communication systems is scarce. In this paper, we designed\na liquid crystal-based RIS operating at 220 GHz supporting both single-user and\nmulti-user communication scenarios, followed by a RIS-aided THz communication\nsystem prototype. To enhance the system performance, we developed a beamforming\nmethod including a real-time power feedback control, which is compatible with\nboth single-beam and multibeam modes. To support simultaneous multi-user\ntransmission, we designed an OFDM-based resource allocation scheme. In our\nexperiments, the received power gain with RIS is no less than 10 dB in the\nsingle-beam mode, and no less than 5 dB in the multi-beam mode. With the\nassistance of RIS, the achievable rate of the system could reach 2.341 Gbps\nwith 3 users sharing 400 MHz bandwidth and the bit error rate (BER) of the\nsystem decreased sharply. Finally, an image transmission experiment was\nconducted to vividly show that the receiver could recover the transmitted\ninformation correctly with the help of RIS. The experimental results also\ndemonstrated that the received signal quality was enhanced through power\nfeedback adjustments.",

However, directly applying LLMs to complex\nimage generation can struggle with reconstructing the image's structure and\ndetails, impacting the generation's accuracy and stability. Additionally, the\n'next-token prediction' paradigm in the AR model does not align with the\ncontextual scanning and logical reasoning processes involved in human visual\nperception, limiting effective image generation. Prompt engineering, as a key\ntechnique for guiding LLMs, leverages specifically designed prompts to improve\nmodel performance on complex natural language processing (NLP) tasks, enhancing\naccuracy and stability of generation while maintaining contextual coherence and\nlogical consistency, similar to human reasoning. Inspired by prompt engineering\nfrom the field of NLP, we propose Vision Full-view prompt (VF prompt) to\nenhance autoregressive image generation. Specifically, we design specialized\nimage-related VF prompts for AR image generation to simulate the process of\nhuman image creation. This enhances contextual logic ability by allowing the\nmodel to first perceive overall distribution information before generating the\nimage, and improve generation stability by increasing the inference steps.\nCompared to the AR method without VF prompts, our method shows outstanding\nperformance and achieves an approximate improvement of 20%.",

Extensive researches relocate\nLLM parameters from expensive GPUs to host memory. However, the restricted\nbandwidth between the host and GPU memory limits the inference performance.\n  This work introduces Hermes, a budget-friendly system that leverages the\nnear-data processing (NDP) within commodity DRAM DIMMs to enhance the\nperformance of a single consumer-grade GPU, achieving efficient LLM inference.\nThe inherent activation sparsity in LLMs naturally divides weight parameters\ninto two categories, termed ``hot\" and ``cold\" neurons, respectively. Hot\nneurons, which consist of only approximately 20\\% of all weight parameters,\naccount for 80\\% of the total computational load, while cold neurons make up\nthe other 80\\% of parameters but are responsible for just 20\\% of the\ncomputational load. Therefore, we propose a heterogeneous computing strategy:\nmapping hot neurons to a single computation-efficient GPU, while offloading\ncold neurons to NDP-DIMMs, which offer large memory size but limited\ncomputation capabilities. Meanwhile, the dynamic nature of activation sparsity\nneeds a real-time partition of hot/cold neurons and adaptive remapping of cold\nneurons across multiple NDP-DIMM modules. Therefore, we introduce a lightweight\npredictor optimizing real-time neuron partition and adjustment between GPU and\nNDP-DIMMs. We also utilize a window-based online scheduling mechanism to\nmaintain load balance among NDP-DIMM modules. Hermes facilitates the deployment\nof LLaMA2-70B on consumer-grade hardware at 13.75 tokens/s and realizes an\naverage 75.24$\\times$ speedup over the state-of-the-art offloading-based\ninference system.",

    "abstract": "A pair of Weyl points (WPs) with opposite Chern numbers ${\\cal{C}}$ can\nexhibit an additional higher-order $Z_2$ topological charge, giving rise to the\nformation of a $Z_2$ Weyl dipole. Owing to the nontrivial topological charge,\n$Z_2$ Weyl dipoles should also appear in pairs, and the WPs within each $Z_2$\nWeyl dipole can not be annihilated when meeting together. As a novel\ntopological state, the topological Weyl-dipole phase (TWDP) has garnered\nsignificant attention, yet its realization in crystalline materials remains a\nchallenge. Here, through first-principles calculations and theoretical\nanalysis, we demonstrate the existence of the Weyl-dipole phase in the phonon\nspectra of the $P6_3$ type Y(OH)$_3$. Particularly, the Weyl dipole in this\nsystem is protected by a quantized quadrupole moment, and it distinguished from\nconventional Weyl dipole, as it comprises an unconventional charge-3 WP with\n${\\cal{C}}=-3$ and three conventional charge-1 WPs with ${\\cal{C}}=1$.\nConsequently, the Weyl-dipole phase in Y(OH)$_3$ features unique\ntwo-dimensional (2D) sextuple-helicoid Fermi-arc states on the top and bottom\nsurfaces, protected by the Chern number, as well as one-dimensional (1D) hinge\nstates that connect the two Weyl dipoles along the side hinges, guaranteed by\nthe quantized quadrupole moment. Our findings not only introduce a novel\nhigher-order topological phase, but also promote Y(OH)$_3$ as a promising\nplatform for exploring multi-dimensional boundaries and the interaction between\nfirst-order and second-order topologies.",

To counteract this, a variety of tools have been developed to identify\nvulnerability in smart contract. However, they fail to overcome two challenges\nat the same time when faced with smart contract bytecode: (i) strong\ninterference caused by enormous non-relevant instructions; (ii) missing\nsemantics of bytecode due to incomplete data and control flow dependencies. In\nthis paper, we propose a multi-teacher based bytecode vulnerability detection\nmethod, namely Multi-Teacher Vulnerability Hunter (MTVHunter), which delivers\neffective denoising and missing semantic to bytecode under multi-teacher\nguidance. Specifically, we first propose an instruction denoising teacher to\neliminate noise interference by abstract vulnerability pattern and further\nreflect in contract embeddings. Secondly, we design a novel semantic\ncomplementary teacher with neuron distillation, which effectively extracts\nnecessary semantic from source code to replenish the bytecode. Particularly,\nthe proposed neuron distillation accelerate this semantic filling by turning\nthe knowledge transition into a regression task.

Anyway, the GRS 1758-258 and 1E\n1740.7-2942 spectra are acceptably described by CompTT+po (jet) and Eqpair\n(hybrid Comptonization) scenarios. To differentiate between the two scenarios,\nwe calculated the Spearman correlation coefficient comparing 30-50 keV count\nrates with those in higher energy bands (50-100, 100-300, and 300-600 keV). The\ncount rates below 300 keV are strongly correlated, indicating those photons\narise from the same physical process. Above 300 keV the count rates are either\nanti-correlated or not correlated with the 30-50 keV count rates for GRS\n1758-258, which suggests that the photons originate from a different physical\nprocess. For 1E 1740.7-2942, the level of correlation is unclear due to scatter\nin the data points. However, the 300-600 keV count rates are consistent with a\nconstant value.

We answer the broader research question of how feasible it is to\ndevelop machine learning classification models for Chichewa SMSs. To do that,\nwe created three datasets. A small dataset of SMS in Chichewa was collected\nthrough primary research from a segment of the young population. We applied a\nlabel-preserving text transformations to increase its size.

We numerically solve the continuity equations for\nnucleons, pions, and muons for their spectral evolution. Since pion and muon\ndamping weakens as the jet expands, the neutrino production at large radii at\nhigh energies may dominate that around the jet energy dissipation radius.\nCompared with the usually adopted approaches that only consider neutrino\nproduction around the energy dissipation radius, the overall UHE neutrino\nfluence integrated over time can be significantly larger, and the flavor\nfraction of electron neutrinos as function of neutrino energy is different at\nUHE, due to neutrino production at radii much larger than the energy\ndissipation radius. The faster magnetic field decay leads to larger UHE\nneutrino fluence, and the UHE neutrino spectra is weakly dependent on the\nenergy dissipation radius and the jet Lorentz factor.

    "abstract": "Unsupervised anomaly detection in brain images is crucial for identifying\ninjuries and pathologies without access to labels. However, the accurate\nlocalization of anomalies in medical images remains challenging due to the\ninherent complexity and variability of brain structures and the scarcity of\nannotated abnormal data. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach\nthat incorporates masking within diffusion models, leveraging their generative\ncapabilities to learn robust representations of normal brain anatomy. During\ntraining, our model processes only normal brain MRI scans and performs a\nforward diffusion process in the latent space that adds noise to the features\nof randomly-selected patches. Following a dual objective, the model learns to\nidentify which patches are noisy and recover their original features. This\nstrategy ensures that the model captures intricate patterns of normal brain\nstructures while isolating potential anomalies as noise in the latent space. At\ninference, the model identifies noisy patches corresponding to anomalies and\ngenerates a normal counterpart for these patches by applying a reverse\ndiffusion process. Our method surpasses existing unsupervised anomaly detection\ntechniques, demonstrating superior performance in generating accurate normal\ncounterparts and localizing anomalies.

Because of the ground truth\nnature, existing approaches match musical versions at the track level (e.g.,\nwhole song). However, most applications require to match them at the segment\nlevel (e.g., 20s chunks). In addition, existing approaches resort to\nclassification and triplet losses, disregarding more recent losses that could\nbring meaningful improvements. In this paper, we propose a method to learn from\nweakly annotated segments, together with a contrastive loss variant that\noutperforms well-studied alternatives. The former is based on pairwise segment\ndistance reductions, while the latter modifies an existing loss following\ndecoupling, hyper-parameter, and geometric considerations. With these two\nelements, we do not only achieve state-of-the-art results in the standard\ntrack-level evaluation, but we also obtain a breakthrough performance in a\nsegment-level evaluation.

In the heliosphere, type II solar radio bursts are signatures of\nelectrons accelerated by collisionless shocks launched at the Sun. Spectral\nobservations of these bursts show a variety of fine structures often composing\nmultiple type II lanes. The origin of these lanes and structures is not well\nunderstood and has been attributed to the inhomogeneous environment around the\npropagating shock. Here, we aim to determine the large-scale local structures\nnear a coronal shock wave using high-resolution radio imaging observations of a\ncomplex type II radio burst observed on 3 October 2023. By using inteferometric\nimaging from the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR), combined with extreme ultraviolet\nobservations, we investigate the origin of multiple type II lanes at low\nfrequencies (30--80~MHz) relative to the propagating shock wave. We identify at\nleast three radio sources at metric wavelengths corresponding to a multi-lane\ntype II burst. The type II burst sources propagate outwards with a shock driven\nby a coronal mass ejection. We find a double radio source that exhibits\nincreasing separation over time, consistent with the expansion rate of the\nglobal coronal shock. This suggests that the overall shock expansion is nearly\nself-similar, with acceleration hotspots forming at various times and splitting\nat a rate proportional to the shock's expansion. Our results show the\nimportance of increased spatial resolution in determining either the\nsmall-scale spatial properties in coronal shocks or the structuring of the\nambient medium.

GMLM employs a two-stage process: first, a\ncontrastive pre-training stage with a novel soft masking technique builds a\nrobust multi-scale GNN; second, an end-to-end fine-tuning stage uses a dynamic\nactive node selection strategy for scalability and a bi-directional\ncross-attention module for deep fusion.

For instance, it improves\naccuracy on the Texas dataset by over 8\\% and on Wisconsin by nearly 5\\%.

    "abstract": "The Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) structure scales the Transformer-based large\nlanguage models (LLMs) and improves their performance with only the sub-linear\nincrease in computation resources. Recently, a fine-grained DeepSeekMoE\nstructure is proposed, which can further improve the computing efficiency of\nMoE without performance degradation. However, the All-to-All communication\nintroduced by MoE has become a bottleneck, especially for the fine-grained\nstructure, which typically involves and activates more experts, hence\ncontributing to heavier communication overhead.\n  In this paper, we propose a novel MoE structure named BigMac, which is also\nfine-grained but with high communication efficiency. The innovation of BigMac\nis mainly due to that we abandon the\n\\textbf{c}ommunicate-\\textbf{d}escend-\\textbf{a}scend-\\textbf{c}ommunicate\n(CDAC) manner used by fine-grained MoE, which leads to the All-to-All\ncommunication always taking place at the highest dimension. Instead, BigMac\ndesigns an efficient\n\\textbf{d}escend-\\textbf{c}ommunicate-\\textbf{c}ommunicate-\\textbf{a}scend\n(DCCA) manner. Specifically, we add a descending and ascending projection at\nthe entrance and exit of the expert, respectively, which enables the\ncommunication to perform at a very low dimension. Furthermore, to adapt to\nDCCA, we re-design the structure of small experts, ensuring that the expert in\nBigMac has enough complexity to address tokens. Experimental results show that\nBigMac achieves comparable or even better model quality than fine-grained MoEs\nwith the same number of experts and a similar number of total parameters.\nEqually importantly, BigMac reduces the end-to-end latency by up to\n3.09$\\times$ for training and increases the throughput by up to 3.11$\\times$\nfor inference on state-of-the-art AI computing frameworks including Megatron,\nTutel, and DeepSpeed-Inference.",

This approach processes user-item\ncontent pairs as input and evaluates each pair iteratively. To maintain\nefficiency, existing methods rely on pre-filtering a small candidate pool of\nuser-item pairs. However, this severely limits the inferential capabilities of\nLLMs by reducing their scope to only a few hundred pre-filtered candidates.

Specifically, we present FilterLLM, a framework\nthat extends the next-word prediction capabilities of LLMs to billion-scale\nfiltering tasks. FilterLLM first introduces a tailored distribution prediction\nand cold-start framework. Next, FilterLLM incorporates an efficient\nuser-vocabulary structure to train and store the embeddings of billion-scale\nusers. Finally, we detail the training objectives for both distribution\nprediction and user-vocabulary construction. The proposed framework has been\ndeployed on the Alibaba platform, where it has been serving cold-start\nrecommendations for two months, processing over one billion cold items.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that FilterLLM significantly outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods in cold-start recommendation tasks, achieving over 30\ntimes higher efficiency.

However, given the significant quality\ndiscrepancies among various text-to-3D assets, there is a pressing need for\nquality assessment models aligned with human subjective judgments. To tackle\nthis challenge, we conduct a comprehensive study to explore the T23DA quality\nassessment (T23DAQA) problem in this work from both subjective and objective\nperspectives. Given the absence of corresponding databases, we first establish\nthe largest text-to-3D asset quality assessment database to date, termed the\nAIGC-T23DAQA database. This database encompasses 969 validated 3D assets\ngenerated from 170 prompts via 6 popular text-to-3D asset generation models,\nand corresponding subjective quality ratings for these assets from the\nperspectives of quality, authenticity, and text-asset correspondence,\nrespectively. Subsequently, we establish a comprehensive benchmark based on the\nAIGC-T23DAQA database, and devise an effective T23DAQA model to evaluate the\ngenerated 3D assets from the aforementioned three perspectives, respectively.",

While humans inherently possess the requisite skills to navigate\nthis issue, it proves to be markedly more challenging for machines to emulate.\nTo bridge the gap, we propose the Human-like Vision and Inference System (HVIS)\nfor human motion prediction, which is designed to emulate human observation and\nforecast future movements. HVIS comprises two components: the human-like vision\nencode (HVE) module and the human-like motion inference (HMI) module. The HVE\nmodule mimics and refines the human visual process, incorporating a\nretina-analog component that captures spatiotemporal information separately to\navoid unnecessary crosstalk. Additionally, a visual cortex-analogy component is\ndesigned to hierarchically extract and treat complex motion features, focusing\non both global and local features of human poses. The HMI is employed to\nsimulate the multi-stage learning model of the human brain. The spontaneous\nlearning network simulates the neuronal fracture generation process for the\nadversarial generation of future motions. Subsequently, the deliberate learning\nnetwork is optimized for hard-to-train joints to prevent misleading learning.\nExperimental results demonstrate that our method achieves new state-of-the-art\nperformance, significantly outperforming existing methods by 19.8% on\nHuman3.6M, 15.7% on CMU Mocap, and 11.1% on G3D.",

Detecting\nand recovering from these failures is crucial for maintaining effective level\nof trust from users. However, robots may fail without being aware of it. One\nway to detect such failures could be by analysing humans' non-verbal behaviours\nand reactions to failures. This study investigates how human gaze dynamics can\nsignal a robot's failure and examines how different types of failures affect\npeople's perception of robot. We conducted a user study with 27 participants\ncollaborating with a robotic mobile manipulator to solve tangram puzzles. The\nrobot was programmed to experience two types of failures -- executional and\ndecisional -- occurring either at the beginning or end of the task, with or\nwithout acknowledgement of the failure. Our findings reveal that the type and\ntiming of the robot's failure significantly affect participants' gaze behaviour\nand perception of the robot. Specifically, executional failures led to more\ngaze shifts and increased focus on the robot, while decisional failures\nresulted in lower entropy in gaze transitions among areas of interest,\nparticularly when the failure occurred at the end of the task. These results\nhighlight that gaze can serve as a reliable indicator of robot failures and\ntheir types, and could also be used to predict the appropriate recovery\nactions.",

This paper proposes\nthe TSLLM-Load Forecasting Mechanism, a novel zero-shot load forecasting\nframework based on large language models (LLMs) to address these challenges.\nThe framework consists of three key components: a data preprocessing module\nthat handles multi-source energy load data, a time series prompt generation\nmodule that bridges the semantic gap between energy data and LLMs through\nmulti-task learning and similarity alignment, and a prediction module that\nleverages pre-trained LLMs for accurate forecasting. The framework's\neffectiveness was validated on a real-world dataset comprising load profiles\nfrom 20 Australian solar-powered households, demonstrating superior performance\nin both conventional and zero-shot scenarios. In conventional testing, our\nmethod achieved a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.4163 and a Mean Absolute Error\n(MAE) of 0.3760, outperforming existing approaches by at least 8\\%.

Curiously, natural families of laser models that achieve\nHeisenberg-limited scaling for coherence produce the most coherence when the\nbeam exhibits sub-Poissonian photon statistics. In this work, we provide an\nanalytical treatment of those novel families of laser models by specializing to\na parameter regime that permits a linearization. We characterize the dynamics\nof each laser system, and find that some of the intuitions from standard laser\ntheory may be applied here. Specifically, the intracavity number dynamics are\nwell-described as an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, while the intracavity phase\ndynamics are well-described in terms of a physically realizable ensemble of\npure states, which evolve according to pure phase diffusion. Unlike a standard\nlaser, however, we find that the pure states comprising the ensemble in the\nHeisenberg-limited lasers are substantially phase squeezed. From our dynamical\nanalysis, we deduce various quantities of the beam for each laser family,\nincluding the first- and second-order Glauber coherence functions, intensity\nnoise spectrum, Mandel-Q parameter and coherence $\\mathfrak{C}$. In addition,\ninspired from these phase diffusion dynamics, we derive an upper bound on laser\ncoherence $\\mathfrak{C} \\lesssim 1.1156 \\mu^4$ -- which is tighter by a factor\nof $3/8$ when compared to that derived in [Baker et al., Nat.

While this\nprotocol is preferred for its ability to maintain accuracy, it has a severe\ndrawback of excessive latency. To address this, existing protocols primarily\nfocused on reducing HE latency, thus making GC the new latency bottleneck.\nFurthermore, previous studies only focused on individual computing layers, such\nas protocol or hardware accelerator, lacking a comprehensive solution at the\nsystem level. This paper presents APINT, a full-stack framework designed to\nreduce PiT's overall latency by addressing the latency problem of GC through\nboth software and hardware solutions. APINT features a novel protocol that\nreallocates possible GC workloads to alternative methods (i.e., HE or standard\nmatrix operation), substantially decreasing the GC workload. It also suggests\nGC-friendly circuit generation that reduces the number of AND gates at the\nmost, which is the expensive operator in GC. Furthermore, APINT proposes an\ninnovative netlist scheduling that combines coarse-grained operation mapping\nand fine-grained scheduling for maximal data reuse and minimal dependency.\nFinally, APINT's hardware accelerator, combined with its compiler speculation,\neffectively resolves the memory stall issue. Putting it all together, APINT\nachieves a remarkable end-to-end reduction in latency, outperforming the\nexisting protocol on CPU platform by 12.2x online and 2.2x offline.

Therefore, active learning (AL) for\nGPR, which actively collects data labels to achieve an accurate prediction with\nfewer data labels, is an important problem. However, existing AL methods do not\ntheoretically guarantee prediction accuracy for target distribution.\nFurthermore, as discussed in the distributionally robust learning literature,\nspecifying the target distribution is often difficult. Thus, this paper\nproposes two AL methods that effectively reduce the worst-case expected error\nfor GPR, which is the worst-case expectation in target distribution candidates.\nWe show an upper bound of the worst-case expected squared error, which suggests\nthat the error will be arbitrarily small by a finite number of data labels\nunder mild conditions.

The joint use of passive IRS (PIRS) and\nactive IRS (AIRS) emerges as a promising solution owing to their complementary\nadvantages. They can be integrated into a single hybrid active-passive IRS\n(HIRS) or deployed in a distributed manner, which poses challenges in\ndetermining the IRS element allocation and placement for rate maximization. In\nthis paper, we investigate the capacity of an IRS-aided wireless communication\nsystem with both active and passive elements. Specifically, we consider three\ndeployment schemes: 1) base station (BS)-HIRS-user (BHU); 2) BS-AIRS-PIRS-user\n(BAPU); 3) BS-PIRS-AIRS-user (BPAU). Under the line-of-sight channel model, we\nformulate a rate maximization problem via a joint optimization of the IRS\nelement allocation and placement. We first derive the optimized number of\nactive and passive elements for BHU, BAPU, and BPAU schemes, respectively.\nThen, low-complexity HIRS/AIRS placement strategies are provided. To obtain\nmore insights, we characterize the system capacity scaling orders for the three\nschemes with respect to the large total number of IRS elements, amplification\npower budget, and BS transmit power.

A common approach for learning this\ncooperative behavior is to utilize the centralized-training\ndecentralized-execution paradigm. However, this approach also introduces a new\nchallenge: how do we evaluate the contributions of each agent's actions to the\noverall success or failure of the team. This credit assignment problem has\nremained open, and has been extensively studied in the Multi-Agent\nReinforcement Learning literature. In fact, humans manually inspecting agent\nbehavior often generate better credit evaluations than existing methods. We\ncombine this observation with recent works which show Large Language Models\ndemonstrate human-level performance at many pattern recognition tasks. Our key\nidea is to reformulate credit assignment to the two pattern recognition\nproblems of sequence improvement and attribution, which motivates our novel\nLLM-MCA method. Our approach utilizes a centralized LLM reward-critic which\nnumerically decomposes the environment reward based on the individualized\ncontribution of each agent in the scenario. We then update the agents' policy\nnetworks based on this feedback. We also propose an extension LLM-TACA where\nour LLM critic performs explicit task assignment by passing an intermediary\ngoal directly to each agent policy in the scenario. Both our methods far\noutperform the state-of-the-art on a variety of benchmarks, including\nLevel-Based Foraging, Robotic Warehouse, and our new Spaceworld benchmark which\nincorporates collision-related safety constraints. As an artifact of our\nmethods, we generate large trajectory datasets with each timestep annotated\nwith per-agent reward information, as sampled from our LLM critics.",

The\nalgorithm is very simple, pooling each departing job with the available job\nthat maximizes the savings in travel distance minus a half of its distance\n(i.e. the potential). On the theoretical front, we show that PB significantly\nimproves upon a naive greedy algorithm in terms of worst-case performance: as\nthe density of the market increases, the regret per job vanishes under PB but\nremains constant under naive greedy. In addition, we show that the potential\napproximates the marginal cost of dispatching each job in a stochastic setting\nwith sufficient density. Moreover, we conduct extensive numerical experiments\nand show that despite its simplicity, PB consistently outperforms a number of\nbenchmark algorithms, including (i) batching-based heuristics that are widely\nused in practice, and (ii) forecast-aware heuristics that estimate the marginal\ncosts of dispatching different jobs using historical data.",

    "abstract": "HSC 120505.09-000027.9 (J1205$-$0000) is one of the highest redshift\n($z=6.72$) dust-reddened quasars (red quasars) known to date. We present an\nimproved analysis of Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array data of the\n[CII] $158\\ \\rm{\\mu m}$ line and the underlying rest-frame far-infrared (FIR)\ncontinuum emission, previously reported in Izumi et al. (2021a), toward\nJ1205$-$0000. Red quasars are thought to be a transitional phase from an\nobscured starburst to a luminous blue quasar, in some cases associated with\nmassive outflows driven by the active galactic nucleus (AGN). J1205$-$0000 has\na high FIR luminosity, $L_{\\mathrm{FIR}}=2.5\\times 10^{12}\\ L_{\\odot}$ and a\ntotal IR luminosity of $L_{\\mathrm{TIR}}=3.5\\times 10^{12}\\ L_{\\odot}$,\ncorresponding to a star formation rate (SFR) of $\\sim 528\\ M_{\\odot}\\\n\\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$. With the [CII]-based dynamical mass of $\\sim 1 \\times\n10^{11}~M_\\odot$, we conclude that J1205$-$0000 is hosted by a starburst\ngalaxy. In contradiction to Izumi et al. (2021a), our improved analysis shows\nno hint of a broad component in the [CII] line spectrum. Thus there is no\nevidence for a host galaxy-scale fast [CII] outflow, despite the fact that\nJ1205$-$0000 has fast nuclear ionized outflows seen in the rest-frame UV. We\nexplore several scenarios for this discrepancy (e.g., early phase of AGN\nfeedback, reliability of the [CII] line as a tracer of outflows), and we claim\nthat it is still too early to conclude that there is no significant negative\nAGN feedback on star formation in this red quasar.",

Nonetheless, PSCs face many problems\nwhen we commercialize them because of their toxicity and stability.\nConsequently, lead-PSCs need an alternative solar cell with high performance\nand low processing cost; lead-free inorganic perovskites have been explored.\nRecent research showcased Cs$_2$CuBiCl$_6$, a lead-free inorganic double\nperovskite material with remarkable photoelectric characteristics and\nexceptional environmental robustness. To investigate the potential of\nCs$_2$CuBiCl$_6$ material, the solar cell structure\nFTO/ETL/Cs$_2$CuBiCl$_6$/HTL/Au was used and analyzed through a solar cell\ncapacitance simulator (SCAPS-1D).

Furthermore, the\nresearch examined the optimization of different parameters of the absorber\nlayer (AL), such as thickness, defect density, electron affinity, band gap, and\noperational temperature. In the end, it has been noticed that by setting the\ntemperature at 300 K and an electron affinity of 4.3 eV of the absorber layer,\nthe PSCs achieve the highest efficiency of 24.51 %, FF of 43.01 %, Voc of\n1.73V, and Jsc of 32.82mA/cm$^2$.

However, for multi-level\ndefects that are prevalent in semiconductors, we demonstrate here that the rate\nshould depend nonlinearly on $\\Delta n$. When $\\Delta n$ varies, the carrier\ncapture and emission of defects can change the defect density distribution in\ndifferent charge states, which can further change the carrier capture and\nemission rates of the defects and thus make the recombination rate depend\nnon-linearly on $\\Delta n$, leading to an $A(n)$ function. However, in many\nrecent calculation studies on carrier recombination rate of multi-level\ndefects, only carrier capture was considered while carrier emission from defect\nlevels was neglected, causing incorrect charge-state distribution and\nmisleading linear dependence of the rate on $\\Delta n$. For\n$\\text{V}_{\\text{Ga}}$-$\\text{O}_{\\text{N}}$ in GaN and $\\text{Pb}_\\text{I}$ in\nCsPbI$_3$, our calculations showed that neglecting the carrier emission can\ncause the recombination rate underestimation by more than 8 orders of magnitude\nwhen $\\Delta n$ is $10^{15}$ cm$^{-3}$.

By offering a\nmore robust and precise lens for identifying disruptive innovations and\nsimultaneous discoveries, our study provides a foundation for deepening\ninsights into the mechanisms driving scientific breakthroughs while\nestablishing a more equitable basis for evaluating transformative\ncontributions.",

To address these\nissues, we propose a novel framework called Federated Bias eliMinating (FedBM)\nto get rid of local learning bias in heterogeneous federated learning (FL),\nwhich mainly consists of two modules, i.e., Linguistic Knowledge-based\nClassifier Construction (LKCC) and Concept-guided Global Distribution\nEstimation (CGDE).

These\nembeddings are used to estimate the latent concept distribution of each class\nin the linguistic space. Based on the theoretical derivation, we can rely on\nthese distributions to pre-construct a high-quality classifier for clients to\nachieve classification optimization, which is frozen to avoid classifier bias\nduring local training. CGDE samples probabilistic concept embeddings from the\nlatent concept distributions to learn a conditional generator to capture the\ninput space of the global model. Three regularization terms are introduced to\nimprove the quality and utility of the generator. The generator is shared by\nall clients and produces pseudo data to calibrate updates of local feature\nextractors.

    "abstract": "This paper introduces an algorithm that dynamically generates basis functions\nto approximate the value function in Network Revenue Management. Unlike\nexisting algorithms sampling the parameters of new basis functions, this\nNonlinear Incremental Algorithm (NLIAlg) iteratively refines the value function\napproximation by optimizing these parameters. For larger instances, the\nTwo-Phase Incremental Algorithm (2PIAlg) modifies NLIAlg to leverage the\nefficiency of LP solvers. It reduces the size of a large-dimensional nonlinear\nproblem and transforms it into an LP by fixing the basis function parameters,\nwhich are then optimized in a second phase using the flow imbalance ideas from\nAdelman and Klabjan (2012). This marks the first application of these\ntechniques in a stochastic setting. The algorithms can operate in two modes:\n(1) Standalone mode, to construct a value function approximation from scratch,\nand (2) Add-on mode, to refine an existing approximation. Our numerical\nexperiments indicate that while NLIAlg and 2PIAlg in standalone mode are only\nfeasible for small-scale problems, the heuristic version of 2PIAlg (H-2PIAlg)\nin add-on mode, using the Affine Approximation and exponential ridge basis\nfunctions, can handle extremely large instances that may cause benchmark\nnetwork revenue management methods to run out of memory. In these scenarios,\nH-2PIAlg delivers substantially better policies and upper bounds than the\nAffine Approximation. Furthermore, H-2PIAlg achieves higher average revenues in\npolicy simulations compared to network revenue management benchmarks in\ninstances with limited capacity.",

System evolution is often modeled as particles moving on a\nlandscape under the combined effect of energy-driven drift and noise-induced\ndiffusion, where the energy governs the long-term motion of the particles.\nEstimating the energy landscape of a system has been a longstanding\ninterdisciplinary challenge, hindered by the high operational costs or the\ndifficulty of obtaining supervisory signals. Therefore, the question of how to\ninfer the energy landscape in the absence of true energy values is critical. In\nthis paper, we propose a physics-informed self-supervised learning method to\nlearn the energy landscape from the evolution trajectories of the system. It\nfirst maps the system state from the observation space to a discrete landscape\nspace by an adaptive codebook, and then explicitly integrates energy into the\ngraph neural Fokker-Planck equation, enabling the joint learning of energy\nestimation and evolution prediction. Experimental results across\ninterdisciplinary systems demonstrate that our estimated energy has a\ncorrelation coefficient above 0.9 with the ground truth, and evolution\nprediction accuracy exceeds the baseline by an average of 17.65\\%.

Numerous studies have explored methods\nto enhance vehicle Re-ID by focusing on semantic enhancement. However, these\nmethods often rely on additional annotated information to enable models to\nextract effective semantic features, which brings many limitations. In this\nwork, we propose a CLIP-based Semantic Enhancement Network (CLIP-SENet), an\nend-to-end framework designed to autonomously extract and refine vehicle\nsemantic attributes, facilitating the generation of more robust semantic\nfeature representations. Inspired by zero-shot solutions for downstream tasks\npresented by large-scale vision-language models, we leverage the powerful\ncross-modal descriptive capabilities of the CLIP image encoder to initially\nextract general semantic information. Instead of using a text encoder for\nsemantic alignment, we design an adaptive fine-grained enhancement module\n(AFEM) to adaptively enhance this general semantic information at a\nfine-grained level to obtain robust semantic feature representations. These\nfeatures are then fused with common Re-ID appearance features to further refine\nthe distinctions between vehicles. Our comprehensive evaluation on three\nbenchmark datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of CLIP-SENet.

Existing methods can be divided into two categories: cell-level\nmethods and column-level methods. However, neither of them ensures both\neffectiveness and efficiency simultaneously. Cell-level methods, which compute\nthe joinability by counting cell matches between columns, enjoy ideal\neffectiveness but suffer poor efficiency. In contrast, column-level methods,\nwhich determine joinability only by computing the similarity of column\nembeddings, enjoy proper efficiency but suffer poor effectiveness due to the\nissues occurring in their column embeddings: (i) semantics-joinability-gap,\n(ii) size limit, and (iii) permutation sensitivity. To address these issues,\nthis paper proposes to compute column embeddings via proxy columns;\nfurthermore, a novel column-level semantic join discovery framework, Snoopy, is\npresented, leveraging proxy-column-based embeddings to bridge effectiveness and\nefficiency. Specifically, the proposed column embeddings are derived from the\nimplicit column-to-proxy-column relationships, which are captured by the\nlightweight approximate-graph-matching-based column projection.To acquire good\nproxy columns for guiding the column projection, we introduce a rank-aware\ncontrastive learning paradigm. Extensive experiments on four real-world\ndatasets demonstrate that Snoopy outperforms SOTA column-level methods by 16%\nin Recall@25 and 10% in NDCG@25, and achieves superior efficiency--being at\nleast 5 orders of magnitude faster than cell-level solutions, and 3.5x faster\nthan existing column-level methods.",

Drawing inspiration from object-oriented programming principles, we\nrecognize that object-oriented solutions is more suitable for cross-app\ninstruction.

Due to privacy concerns and conflicts of\ninterest that prevent clients from directly sharing graph data with one\nanother, Vertical Graph Federated Learning (VGFL) frameworks have been\ndeveloped. Recent studies have shown that VGFL is vulnerable to adversarial\nattacks that degrade performance. However, it is a common problem that client\nnodes are often unlabeled in the realm of VGFL. Consequently, the existing\nattacks, which rely on the availability of labeling information to obtain\ngradients, are inherently constrained in their applicability. This limitation\nprecludes their deployment in practical, real-world environments. To address\nthe above problems, we propose a novel graph adversarial attack against VGFL,\nreferred to as VGFL-SA, to degrade the performance of VGFL by modifying the\nlocal clients structure without using labels. Specifically, VGFL-SA uses a\ncontrastive learning method to complete the attack before the local clients are\ntrained. VGFL-SA first accesses the graph structure and node feature\ninformation of the poisoned clients, and generates the contrastive views by\nnode-degree-based edge augmentation and feature shuffling augmentation. Then,\nVGFL-SA uses the shared graph encoder to get the embedding of each view, and\nthe gradients of the adjacency matrices are obtained by the contrastive\nfunction. Finally, perturbed edges are generated using gradient modification\nrules. We validated the performance of VGFL-SA by performing a node\nclassification task on real-world datasets, and the results show that VGFL-SA\nachieves good attack effectiveness and transferability.",

KVCrush provides an alternate representation scheme for key-value\nstates, along with a low-overhead token pruning algorithm that accounts for the\ntoken distribution in the KV cache, which in turn allows for a a smaller\nfootprint while maintaining the accuracy of the model. Based on our results,\nKVCrush reduces LongBench KV Cache size by 4x with less than 1% accuracy drop\nand achieves state-of-the-art average accuracy with minimal overhead, incurring\nless than 0.5% total inference latency. KVCrush not only outperforms the\naccuracy of state-of-the-art importance-based token retention schemes but is\nalso compatible with typical practical LLM deployments using KV cache paging\nschemes such as vLLM and mixed precision quantization.",

However, the pervasive issue of alpha decay, where factors\nlose their predictive power over time, poses a significant challenge for alpha\nmining. Traditional methods like genetic programming face rapid alpha decay\nfrom overfitting and complexity, while approaches driven by Large Language\nModels (LLMs), despite their promise, often rely too heavily on existing\nknowledge, creating homogeneous factors that worsen crowding and accelerate\ndecay. To address this challenge, we propose AlphaAgent, an autonomous\nframework that effectively integrates LLM agents with ad hoc regularizations\nfor mining decay-resistant alpha factors. AlphaAgent employs three key\nmechanisms: (i) originality enforcement through a similarity measure based on\nabstract syntax trees (ASTs) against existing alphas, (ii) hypothesis-factor\nalignment via LLM-evaluated semantic consistency between market hypotheses and\ngenerated factors, and (iii) complexity control via AST-based structural\nconstraints, preventing over-engineered constructions that are prone to\noverfitting. These mechanisms collectively guide the alpha generation process\nto balance originality, financial rationale, and adaptability to evolving\nmarket conditions, mitigating the risk of alpha decay. Extensive evaluations\nshow that AlphaAgent outperforms traditional and LLM-based methods in\nmitigating alpha decay across bull and bear markets, consistently delivering\nsignificant alpha in Chinese CSI 500 and US S&P 500 markets over the past four\nyears.

However, these approaches not only limit adequate\ninteraction between visual and linguistic contexts, but also incur significant\ncomputational costs. Therefore, to address these issues, we explore a step-wise\nmultimodal fusion and adaption framework, namely SwimVG.

We observe that the Transformer's\noperational complexity scales quadratically with the number of input tokens,\nmaking it essential to reduce the input token length. Notably, each token\nvaries in importance, and many inputs contain redundant tokens. Additionally,\nprior private inference methods that rely on high-degree polynomial\napproximations for non-linear activations are computationally expensive.\nTherefore, reducing the polynomial degree for less important tokens can\nsignificantly accelerate private inference. Building on these observations, we\npropose \\textit{CipherPrune}, an efficient and scalable private inference\nframework that includes a secure encrypted token pruning protocol, a polynomial\nreduction protocol, and corresponding Transformer network optimizations. At the\nprotocol level, encrypted token pruning adaptively removes unimportant tokens\nfrom encrypted inputs in a progressive, layer-wise manner.

At the\nnetwork level, we introduce protocol-aware network optimization via a\ngradient-based search to maximize pruning thresholds and polynomial reduction\nconditions while maintaining the desired accuracy. Our experiments demonstrate\nthat CipherPrune reduces the execution overhead of private Transformer\ninference by approximately $6.1\\times$ for 128-token inputs and $10.6\\times$\nfor 512-token inputs, compared to previous methods, with only a marginal drop\nin accuracy.

Thus, it is important to understand how much\ndifferent structural metrics are affected by missing data. To address this\nquestion, we analyzed a database of 148 real-world bipartite networks\nrepresenting four different types of species interactions (pollination,\nhost-parasite, plant-ant, and seed-dispersal). For each network, we measured\nsix different topological properties: number of connected components, variance\nin node betweenness, variance in node PageRank, largest Eigenvalue, the number\nof non-zero Eigenvalues, and community detection as determined by four\ndifferent algorithms. We then tested how these properties change as additional\nedges -- representing data that may have been missed -- are added to the\nnetworks. We found substantial variation in how robust different properties\nwere to the missing data. For example, the Clauset-Newman-Moore and Louvain\ncommunity detection algorithms showed much more gradual change as edges were\nadded than the label propagation and Girvan-Newman algorithms did, suggesting\nthat the former are more robust. Robustness also varied for some metrics based\non interaction type. These results provide a foundation for selecting network\nproperties to use when analyzing messy ecological network data.",

    "abstract": "This study proposes a novel structural optimization framework based on\nquantum variational circuits, in which the multiplier acting on the\ncross-sectional area of each rod in a truss structure as an updater is used as\na design variable. Specifically, we employ a classical processor for structural\nanalysis with the finite element method, and the Quantum Approximate\nOptimization Algorithm (QAOA) is subsequently performed to update the\ncross-sectional area so that the compliance is minimized. The advantages of\nthis framework can be seen in three key aspects. First, by defining design\nvariables as multipliers, rather than simply reducing the design variable to a\nbinary candidate of inclusion or exclusion (corresponding to qubit states, ``0\"\nand ``1\"), it provides greater flexibility in adjusting the cross-sectional\narea of the rod at each iteration of the optimization process. Second, the\nmultipliers acting on rods are encoded with on-off encoding, eliminating\nadditional constraints in the convergence judgement. As a result, the objective\nfunction is in a simple format, enabling efficient optimization using\nQAOA.Third, a fixed linear ramp schedule (FLRS) for variational parameter\nsetting bypasses the classical optimization process, thereby improving the\noperational efficiency of the framework. In the two structural cases\ninvestigated in this study, the proposed approach highlights the feasibility\nand applicability potential of quantum computing in advancing engineering\ndesign and optimization. Numerical experiments have demonstrated the\neffectiveness of this framework, providing a firm foundation for future\nresearch on quantum-assisted optimization methods in engineering fields.",

    "abstract": "Neural networks are known for their ability to approximate smooth functions,\nyet they fail to generalize perfectly to unseen inputs when trained on discrete\noperations. Such operations lie at the heart of algorithmic tasks such as\narithmetic, which is often used as a test bed for algorithmic execution in\nneural networks. In this work, we ask: can neural networks learn to execute\nbinary-encoded algorithmic instructions exactly? We use the Neural Tangent\nKernel (NTK) framework to study the training dynamics of two-layer fully\nconnected networks in the infinite-width limit and show how a sufficiently\nlarge ensemble of such models can be trained to execute exactly, with high\nprobability, four fundamental tasks: binary permutations, binary addition,\nbinary multiplication, and Subtract and Branch if Negative (SBN) instructions.\nSince SBN is Turing-complete, our framework extends to computable functions. We\nshow how this can be efficiently achieved using only logarithmically many\ntraining data. Our approach relies on two techniques: structuring the training\ndata to isolate bit-level rules, and controlling correlations in the NTK regime\nto align model predictions with the target algorithmic executions.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel knowledge distillation neural architecture\nleveraging efficient transformer networks for effective image classification.\nNatural images display intricate arrangements encompassing numerous extraneous\nelements. Vision transformers utilize localized patches to compute attention.\nHowever, exclusive dependence on patch segmentation proves inadequate in\nsufficiently encompassing the comprehensive nature of the image. To address\nthis issue, we have proposed an inner-outer transformer-based architecture,\nwhich gives attention to the global and local aspects of the image. Moreover,\nThe training of transformer models poses significant challenges due to their\ndemanding resource, time, and data requirements. To tackle this, we integrate\nknowledge distillation into the architecture, enabling efficient learning.\nLeveraging insights from a larger teacher model, our approach enhances learning\nefficiency and effectiveness. Significantly, the transformer-in-transformer\nnetwork acquires lightweight characteristics by means of distillation conducted\nwithin the feature extraction layer. Our featured network's robustness is\nestablished through substantial experimentation on the MNIST, CIFAR10, and\nCIFAR100 datasets, demonstrating commendable top-1 and top-5 accuracy. The\nconducted ablative analysis comprehensively validates the effectiveness of the\nchosen parameters and settings, showcasing their superiority against\ncontemporary methodologies. Remarkably, the proposed Transformer-in-Transformer\nNetwork (TITN) model achieves impressive performance milestones across various\ndatasets: securing the highest top-1 accuracy of 74.71% and a top-5 accuracy of\n92.28% for the CIFAR100 dataset, attaining an unparalleled top-1 accuracy of\n92.03% and top-5 accuracy of 99.80% for the CIFAR-10 dataset, and registering\nan exceptional top-1 accuracy of 99.56% for the MNIST dataset.",

Prior methods steer LLMs via descriptions of subpopulations as\nLLMs' input prompt, yet such prompt engineering approaches have struggled to\nfaithfully predict the distribution of survey responses from human subjects. In\nthis work, we propose directly fine-tuning LLMs to predict response\ndistributions by leveraging unique structural characteristics of survey data.\nTo enable fine-tuning, we curate SubPOP, a significantly scaled dataset of\n3,362 questions and 70K subpopulation-response pairs from well-established\npublic opinion surveys. We show that fine-tuning on SubPOP greatly improves the\nmatch between LLM predictions and human responses across various\nsubpopulations, reducing the LLM-human gap by up to 46% compared to baselines,\nand achieves strong generalization to unseen surveys and subpopulations. Our\nfindings highlight the potential of survey-based fine-tuning to improve opinion\nprediction for diverse, real-world subpopulations and therefore enable more\nefficient survey designs.

    "abstract": "Photointeractions of ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) in astro-physical\nscenarios are in general of stochastic nature and are often modeled with Monte\nCarlo methods to obtain the form of the distributions resulting from a sequence\nof interactions. These distributions are non trivial because the products\nresulting from each interaction as well as the number and distances covered by\nthe secondary nuclear species are all random. In this work, a stochastic\napproach based on the theory of matrix exponential distributions is employed to\ndescribe the cascade distributions analytically and illustrate their potential\nfor tracing the individual history of UHECRs, including inside the source. This\nanalytic description has the advantage of better precision and considerably\nreduced computational cost in contrast to Monte Carlo codes, while requiring\nthe same inputs: the interaction rates, the multiplicity, and the energy\ndistributions of secondaries from a single interaction. The description of the\ncomposition evolution from in-source to extragalactic propagation (currently\nperformed in separate simulations in the literature) is achieved here as a\ncontinuous distribution, using a gamma-ray burst scenario inspired by the event\nGRB170817A. Finally, the potential for locating a source based on the\nreconstructed UHECR origin employing this description is discussed under\nsimplified general assumptions.",

    "abstract": "Modern recommender systems use ML models to predict consumer preferences from\nconsumption history. Although these \"black-box\" models achieve impressive\npredictive performance, they often suffer from a lack of transparency and\nexplainability. Contrary to the presumed tradeoff between explainability and\naccuracy, we show that integrating large language models (LLMs) with deep\nneural networks (DNNs) can improve both. We propose LR-Recsys, which augments\nDNN-based systems with LLM reasoning capabilities. LR-Recsys introduces a\ncontrastive-explanation generator that produces human-readable positive\nexplanations and negative explanations. These explanations are embedded via a\nfine-tuned autoencoder and combined with consumer and product features to\nimprove predictions. Beyond offering explainability, we show that LR-Recsys\nalso improves learning efficiency and predictive accuracy, as supported by\nhigh-dimensional, multi-environment statistical learning theory.\n  LR-Recsys outperforms state-of-the-art recommender systems by 3-14% on three\nreal-world datasets. Importantly, our analysis reveals that these gains\nprimarily derive from LLMs' reasoning capabilities rather than their external\ndomain knowledge. LR-RecSys presents an effective approach to combine LLMs with\ntraditional DNNs, two of the most widely used ML models today. The explanations\ngenerated by LR-Recsys provide actionable insights for consumers, sellers, and\nplatforms, helping to build trust, optimize product offerings, and inform\ntargeting strategies.",

    "abstract": "First-order logic (FOL) can represent the logical entailment semantics of\nnatural language (NL) sentences, but determining natural language entailment\nusing FOL remains a challenge. To address this, we propose the\nEntailment-Preserving FOL representations (EPF) task and introduce\nreference-free evaluation metrics for EPF, the Entailment-Preserving Rate (EPR)\nfamily. In EPF, one should generate FOL representations from multi-premise\nnatural language entailment data (e.g. EntailmentBank) so that the automatic\nprover's result preserves the entailment labels. Experiments show that existing\nmethods for NL-to-FOL translation struggle in EPF. To this extent, we propose a\ntraining method specialized for the task, iterative learning-to-rank, which\ndirectly optimizes the model's EPR score through a novel scoring function and a\nlearning-to-rank objective. Our method achieves a 1.8-2.7% improvement in EPR\nand a 17.4-20.6% increase in EPR@16 compared to diverse baselines in three\ndatasets. Further analyses reveal that iterative learning-to-rank effectively\nsuppresses the arbitrariness of FOL representation by reducing the diversity of\npredicate signatures, and maintains strong performance across diverse inference\ntypes and out-of-domain data.",

This\nstudy investigated the rider behaviour through a naturalistic study with 23\nparticipants equipped with a bike computer, eye-tracking glasses and cameras.\nThey followed a pre-determined route, enabling multi-modal data collection. We\nanalysed and compared gaze movements, speed, and video feeds across three\ntransport infrastructure types: a pedestrian-shared path, a cycle lane and a\nroadway. Our findings reveal unique challenges e-scooter riders face, including\ndifficulty keeping up with cyclists and motor vehicles due to speed limits on\nshared e-scooters, risks in signalling turns due to control lose, and limited\nacceptance in mixed-use spaces. The cycle lane showed the highest average\nspeed, the least speed change points, and the least head movements, supporting\nits suitability as dedicated infrastructure for e-scooters. These findings are\nfacilitated through multimodal sensing and analysing the e-scooter riders'\nego-centric view, which show the efficacy of our method in discovering the\nbehavioural dynamics of the riders in the wild.
