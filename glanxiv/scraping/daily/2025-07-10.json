The key is determination of the $p$-adic valuation of\ngeneralized Gauss sums defined using Coates-Wiles homomorphism, and of local\nresolvents in $\\mathbb{Z}_p$-extensions. This answers a question of Rubin.",

    "abstract": "The first and shorter part of this thesis deals with the structural\nassumption of invertibility in a Lie groupoid. When this assumption is dropped,\nwe obtain the notion of a Lie category: a small category, endowed with a\ncompatible differentiable structure. We introduce various examples of Lie\ncategories, examine their differences and similarities with Lie groupoids, and\nresearch the notions emerging naturally from the lack of invertibility of\narrows. The aim of the second and principal part of this thesis is to provide a\nfar-reaching generalization of Yang-Mills theory, extending it from the\nclassical setting of principal bundles to general Lie groupoids and algebroids.\nThe notion of a principal bundle connection is now replaced with that of a more\ngeneral multiplicative Ehresmann connection. In obtaining this generalization,\nwe make various advances to the theory of such connections, as well as\ninvariant linear connections on representations. We develop the obstruction\nclasses for their existence, generalize the (horizontal) exterior covariant\nderivative to the representation-valued Bott-Shulman-Stasheff and Weil\ncomplexes, and inspect their relationship with the van Est map. We research the\nclass of multiplicative connections with cohomologically trivial curvature,\nwhich are central to obtaining the desired generalization. Applying the\nvariational principle to this framework rests upon our developed formulae for\naffine deformations of multiplicative connections. Ultimately, we develop the\nextension of Yang-Mills theory to a non-integrable and non-transitive setting:\nthe classical Yang-Mills equation is upgraded to a gauge-invariant pair of\nequations, which now describe the dynamics of gauge fields in both the\nlongitudinal and transversal directions with respect to the (singular) orbit\nfoliation. As an example, we obtain a Yang-Mills theory for $S^1$-bundle\ngerbes.",

Rather than\nlearning shallow heuristics, they implicitly internalize and act on the\nconsequences of observations scattered throughout the fine-tuning data. In this\nwork, we investigate this phenomenon mechanistically and find that many\ninstances of OOCR in the literature have a simple explanation: the LoRA\nfine-tuning essentially adds a constant steering vector, steering the model\ntowards a general concept. This improves performance on the fine-tuning task\nand in many other concept-related domains, causing the surprising\ngeneralization. Moreover, we can directly train steering vectors for these\ntasks from scratch, which also induces OOCR. We find that our results hold even\nfor a task that seems like it must involve conditional behavior (model\nbackdoors); it turns out that unconditionally adding a steering vector is\nsufficient. Overall, our work presents one explanation of what gets learned\nduring fine-tuning for OOCR tasks, contributing to the key question of why LLMs\ncan reason out of context, an advanced capability that is highly relevant to\ntheir safe and reliable deployment.",

    "abstract": "A large class of Neural-Symbolic (NeSy) methods employs a machine learner to\nprocess the input entities, while relying on a reasoner based on First-Order\nLogic to represent and process more complex relationships among the entities. A\nfundamental role for these methods is played by the process of logic grounding,\nwhich determines the relevant substitutions for the logic rules using a\n(sub)set of entities. Some NeSy methods use an exhaustive derivation of all\npossible substitutions, preserving the full expressive power of the logic\nknowledge. This leads to a combinatorial explosion in the number of ground\nformulas to consider and, therefore, strongly limits their scalability. Other\nmethods rely on heuristic-based selective derivations, which are generally more\ncomputationally efficient, but lack a justification and provide no guarantees\nof preserving the information provided to and returned by the reasoner. Taking\ninspiration from multi-hop symbolic reasoning, this paper proposes a\nparametrized family of grounding methods generalizing classic Backward\nChaining. Different selections within this family allow us to obtain commonly\nemployed grounding methods as special cases, and to control the trade-off\nbetween expressiveness and scalability of the reasoner. The experimental\nresults show that the selection of the grounding criterion is often as\nimportant as the NeSy method itself.",

    "abstract": "We introduce the LLM-Nash framework, a game-theoretic model where agents\nselect reasoning prompts to guide decision-making via Large Language Models\n(LLMs). Unlike classical games that assume utility-maximizing agents with full\nrationality, this framework captures bounded rationality by modeling the\nreasoning process explicitly. Equilibrium is defined over the prompt space,\nwith actions emerging as the behavioral output of LLM inference. This approach\nenables the study of cognitive constraints, mindset expressiveness, and\nepistemic learning. Through illustrative examples, we show how reasoning\nequilibria can diverge from classical Nash outcomes, offering a new foundation\nfor strategic interaction in LLM-enabled systems.",

    "abstract": "As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in critical\napplications, the challenge of jailbreaking, where adversaries manipulate the\nmodels to bypass safety mechanisms, has become a significant concern. This\npaper presents a dynamic Stackelberg game framework to model the interactions\nbetween attackers and defenders in the context of LLM jailbreaking. The\nframework treats the prompt-response dynamics as a sequential extensive-form\ngame, where the defender, as the leader, commits to a strategy while\nanticipating the attacker's optimal responses. We propose a novel agentic AI\nsolution, the \"Purple Agent,\" which integrates adversarial exploration and\ndefensive strategies using Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT). The Purple\nAgent actively simulates potential attack trajectories and intervenes\nproactively to prevent harmful outputs.

In this work, we\nshow that the so-called ``twist-and-turn\" (TaT) dynamics for interacting spin\nensembles, generated by Hamiltonians with U(1)-symmetric interactions and with\na transverse field, can offer an important resource to reach this goal. For\nmodels with sufficiently high connectivity, TaT dynamics exhibits two key\nfeatures: 1) it features both scalable squeezing at short times, as well as\nquantum Fisher information with Heisenberg scaling at later times; and 2)\nscalable multipartite entanglement (up to Heisenberg scaling) is reached in a\ntime growing only logarithmically with system size, associated with an\nexponential buildup of quantum correlations. These results can be shown exactly\nin the XY model with a Rabi field and infinite range interactions, and\nnumerically in the case of spatially decaying XY interactions, such as dipolar\ninteractions in two dimensions, provided that unstable spin-wave modes do not\ndevelop for large system sizes and/or strong fields.

For CNNs, given the local receptive fields of\nconvolutional layers, long-range spatial correlations are captured through\nconsecutive convolutions and pooling. However, as the computational cost and\nmemory footprint can be prohibitively large, 3D models can only afford fewer\nlayers than 2D models with reduced receptive fields and abstract levels. For\ntransformers, although long-range correlations can be captured by multi-head\nattention, its quadratic complexity with respect to input size is\ncomputationally demanding. Therefore, either model may require input size\nreduction to allow more filters and layers for better segmentation.\nNevertheless, given their discrete nature, models trained with patch-wise\ntraining or image downsampling may produce suboptimal results when applied on\nhigher resolutions. To address this issue, here we propose the\nresolution-robust HNOSeg-XS architecture. We model image segmentation by\nlearnable partial differential equations through the Fourier neural operator\nwhich has the zero-shot super-resolution property. By replacing the Fourier\ntransform by the Hartley transform and reformulating the problem in the\nfrequency domain, we created the HNOSeg-XS model, which is resolution robust,\nfast, memory efficient, and extremely parameter efficient. When tested on the\nBraTS'23, KiTS'23, and MVSeg'23 datasets with a Tesla V100 GPU, HNOSeg-XS\nshowed its superior resolution robustness with fewer than 34.7k model\nparameters.

    "abstract": "Robot-assisted neurological surgery is receiving growing interest due to the\nimproved dexterity, precision, and control of surgical tools, which results in\nbetter patient outcomes. However, such systems often limit surgeons' natural\nsensory feedback, which is crucial in identifying tissues -- particularly in\noncological procedures where distinguishing between healthy and tumorous tissue\nis vital. While imaging and force sensing have addressed the lack of sensory\nfeedback, limited research has explored multimodal sensing options for accurate\ntissue boundary delineation. We present a user-friendly, modular test bench\ndesigned to evaluate and integrate complementary multimodal sensors for tissue\nidentification. Our proposed system first uses vision-based guidance to\nestimate boundary locations with visual cues, which are then refined using data\nacquired by contact microphones and a force sensor. Real-time data acquisition\nand visualization are supported via an interactive graphical interface.\nExperimental results demonstrate that multimodal fusion significantly improves\nmaterial classification accuracy. The platform provides a scalable\nhardware-software solution for exploring sensor fusion in surgical applications\nand demonstrates the potential of multimodal approaches in real-time tissue\nboundary delineation.",

In their work, they established an upper bound\nof $O(\\sqrt{n})$ rounds and a lower bound of $\\widetilde{\\Omega}(n^{1/3})$\nrounds for this problem, and these bounds have remained unimproved since then.\n  In this work, we make the first progress in narrowing this gap by designing a\nparallel algorithm that finds a basis of an arbitrary matroid in\n$\\tilde{O}(n^{7/15})$ rounds (using polynomially many independence queries per\nround) with high probability, surpassing the long-standing $O(\\sqrt{n})$\nbarrier. Our approach introduces a novel matroid decomposition technique and\nother structural insights that not only yield this general result but also lead\nto a much improved new algorithm for the class of \\emph{partition matroids}\n(which underlies the $\\widetilde\\Omega(n^{1/3})$ lower bound of Karp, Upfal,\nand Wigderson).

    "abstract": "The lack of high-quality public cyber incident data limits empirical research\nand predictive modeling for cyber risk assessment. This challenge persists due\nto the reluctance of companies to disclose incidents that could damage their\nreputation or investor confidence. Therefore, from an actuarial perspective,\npotential resolutions conclude two aspects: the enhancement of existing cyber\nincident datasets and the implementation of advanced modeling techniques to\noptimize the use of the available data. A review of existing data-driven\nmethods highlights a significant lack of entity-specific organizational\nfeatures in publicly available datasets. To address this gap, we propose a\nnovel InsurTech framework that enriches cyber incident data with\nentity-specific attributes. We develop various machine learning (ML) models: a\nmultilabel classification model to predict the occurrence of cyber incident\ntypes (e.g., Privacy Violation, Data Breach, Fraud and Extortion, IT Error, and\nOthers) and a multioutput regression model to estimate their annual\nfrequencies. While classifier and regressor chains are implemented to explore\ndependencies among cyber incident types as well, no significant correlations\nare observed in our datasets. Besides, we apply multiple interpretable ML\ntechniques to identify and cross-validate potential risk factors developed by\nInsurTech across ML models. We find that InsurTech empowered features enhance\nprediction occurrence and frequency estimation robustness compared to only\nusing conventional risk factors. The framework generates transparent,\nentity-specific cyber risk profiles, supporting customized underwriting and\nproactive cyber risk mitigation.

While data on native 3D\nstructures are abundant, data on 3D structures of non-native intermediates\nremain sparse, due to limitations of current technologies for experimental\ndetermination of 3D structures. Yet, analyzing folding intermediates is crucial\nfor understanding folding dynamics and misfolding-related diseases. Hence, we\nsearch the literature for available (experimentally and computationally\nobtained) 3D structural data on folding intermediates, organizing the data in a\ncentralized resource. Additionally, we assess whether existing methods,\ndesigned for predicting native structures, can also be utilized to predict\nstructures of non-native intermediates.\n  Results: Our literature search reveals six studies that provide 3D structural\ndata on folding intermediates (two for post-translational and four for\nco-translational folding), each focused on a single protein, with 2-4\nintermediates. Our assessment shows that an established method for predicting\nnative structures, AlphaFold2, does not perform well for non-native\nintermediates in the context of co-translational folding; a recent study on\npost-translational folding concluded the same for even more existing methods.\nYet, we identify in the literature recent pioneering methods designed\nexplicitly to predict 3D structures of folding intermediates by incorporating\nintrinsic biophysical characteristics of folding dynamics, which show promise.\nThis study assesses the current landscape and future directions of the field of\n3D structural analysis of protein folding dynamics.",

Here, we revisit the four-state active Potts model (APM) and show\nthat its globally ordered phase is metastable across a broad swath of parameter\nspace. Small counter-propagating droplets disrupt the flocking phase by\ninducing a persistent sandwich state, where the droplet-induced\nopposite-polarity lane remains embedded within the original flock, particularly\npronounced at low noise, influenced by spatial anisotropy. In contrast, small\ntransversely propagating droplets, when introduced into the flock, can trigger\ncomplete phase reversal due to their alignment orthogonal to the dominant flow\nand their enhanced persistence. At low diffusion and strong self-propulsion,\nsuch transverse droplets also emerge spontaneously, fragmenting the flock into\nmultiple traveling domains and giving rise to a short-range order (SRO) regime.\nWe further identify a motility-induced pinning (MIP) transition in small\ndiffusion and low-temperature regimes when particles of opposite polarity\ninteract, flip their state, hop, and pin an interface. Our comprehensive phase\ndiagrams, encompassing full reversal, sandwich coexistence, stripe bands, SRO,\nand MIP, delineate how thermal fluctuations, self-propulsion strength, and\ndiffusion govern flock stability in discrete active matter systems.",

The change in pH is induced either by the addition of alkaline\nsolution such as sodium hydroxide (NaOH) or by the addition of a carbon dioxide\ngas (CO$_2$) to the given ionic solution. Under this setup we propose a system\nof degenerate stochastic partial differential equations that is able to explain\nthe dynamical behavior of the key components of precipitation process. In\nparticular, we propose a semi-linear advection equation for the dynamics of\nparticle size distribution (PSD) of the precipitated particles.

The resulting\ncoupled system is first mathematically studied, in particular conditions for\nthe existence of a mild-solution is established and also the long time behavior\nof the system is established. Following this we consider the validation of the\nmodel for which we consider experimentally obtained lab-scale data.

    "abstract": "Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning enables large language models (LLMs) to\nbreak down complex problems into interpretable intermediate steps,\nsignificantly enhancing model transparency and performance in reasoning tasks.\nHowever, conventional CoT methods rely on heuristic sampling without structured\nmodeling of reasoning transitions, constraining their ability to systematically\nexplore and discover diverse and effective reasoning trajectories. In this\nwork, we introduce CTRLS, a framework that formulates CoT reasoning as a Markov\ndecision process (MDP) with latent state transitions, enabling principled and\nstate-aware exploration via distributional reinforcement learning. By modelling\nreasoning actions as explicit probability distributions in latent space, our\napproach explicitly models epistemic uncertainty, facilitating robust\nexploration of the reasoning space. As part of our framework, we introduce an\non-policy reinforcement learning strategy incorporating epsilon-greedy\nexploration and entropy-based regularization to iteratively refine latent state\ntransitions without requiring additional fine-tuning of the underlying LLM.\nTheoretical analyses provide evidence lower bounds (ELBO), theoretically\ngrounding our transition-aware modeling of latent reasoning dynamics. Further\nexperiments demonstrate improvements in reasoning accuracy, diversity, and\nexploration efficiency across benchmark reasoning tasks.",

The analysis includes measurements in\nindividual and stacked spectra, and considers several key AGN properties such\nas X-ray luminosity, supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass, Eddington ratios, and\nline-of-sight column density. The [Ne v] $\\lambda$3427 line is robustly\ndetected in ~43% (146/341) of the AGN in our sample, with no significant trends\nbetween the detection rate and key AGN/SMBH properties. In particular, the\ndetection rate remains high even at the highest levels of obscuration (>70% for\nlog[N_H/cm^-2] > 23). On the other hand, even some of our highest\nsignal-to-noise spectra (S/N > 50) lack a robust [Ne v] detection. The typical\n(median) scaling ratios between [Ne v] line emission and (ultra-)hard X-ray\nemission in our sample are log L[Ne v]/L(14-150 keV) = -3.75 and log L[Ne\nv]/L(2-10 keV) = -3.36. The scatter on these scaling ratios, of ~0.5 dex, is\ncomparable to, and indeed smaller than, what is found for other commonly used\ntracers of AGN radiative outputs (e.g., [O III] $\\lambda$5007). Otherwise, we\nfind no significant relations between the (relative) strength of [Ne v] and the\nbasic AGN/SMBH properties under study, in contrast with simple expectations\nfrom models of SMBH accretion flows.

Spatio-Temporal Anomaly detection plays an important role\nin ensuring system security and operational integrity. However, current\ndata-driven approaches, largely driven by black-box deep learning, face\nchallenges in interpretability, adaptability to distribution shifts, and\nrobustness under evolving system dynamics. In this paper, we advocate for a\ncausal learning perspective to advance anomaly detection in spatially\ndistributed infrastructures that grounds detection in structural cause-effect\nrelationships. We identify and formalize three key directions: causal graph\nprofiling, multi-view fusion, and continual causal graph learning, each\noffering distinct advantages in uncovering dynamic cause-effect structures\nacross time and space. Drawing on real-world insights from systems such as\nwater treatment infrastructures, we illustrate how causal models provide early\nwarning signals and root cause attribution, addressing the limitations of\nblack-box detectors. Looking ahead, we outline the future research agenda\ncentered on multi-modality, generative AI-driven, and scalable adaptive causal\nframeworks. Our objective is to lay a new research trajectory toward scalable,\nadaptive, explainable, and spatially grounded anomaly detection systems.

The research field of\ndark matter covers an energy scale going from massive objects to ultra-light\nscalar fields, which are the focus of the present work. It is supposed that\nultra-light scalar fields affect the length of objects, whereas the speed of\nlight stays unchanged. It follows that Fabry-Perot cavities are ideal tools for\nultra-light dark matter detection since the fluctuations in the length of a\ncavity can be detected on the frequency of the laser stabilized to it. At\nFEMTO-ST, we have set up an ultra-stable silicon cavity suitable for a test of\ndetection of ultra-light dark matter in an energy range close to 10$^{-10}$ eV.\nOur 14 cm cavity is composed of two mirrors optically bonded to an ultra-rigid\nspacer, with each element made in single-crystal of silicon, and cooled at 17 K\nin order to cancel the first order thermal expansion coefficient of the silicon\nspacer. The projected fractional frequency stability of the laser is $3 \\times\n10^{-17}$, mainly limited by the thermal noise of the amorphous dielectric\nreflective coatings. To reach this remarkable stability, several effects have\nto be reduced below the thermal noise limit. While the contribution of the\nresidual amplitude modulation is now acceptable, we are currently implementing\na laser power lock with residual fluctuations lower than 3~nW and a\npiezoelectric-based servo loop to actively reduce the vibration noise that has\nto be inferior to $-110 \\textrm{~dB(m s}^{-2})^2/\\textrm{Hz}$ at 1 Hz.

Our goal is to study the\nphysical and dynamical state of the most conspicuous infalling group, on a\nfilament projected at 1.3 Mpc from the Abell 2142 centre. The galaxy group is\nthe leading edge of a spectacular trailing 700-kpc-long X-ray tail of hot gas\nstripped by ram-pressure.

We use integral field spectroscopy from MaNGA to derive stellar\nand gas kinematics, and MegaCam for ugr photometry. Stellar populations (with\nage and metallicity) are obtained through full-spectrum fitting using Nburst.\nThe gas kinematics and excitation are derived from the line emission of\nH$\\alpha$, [NII], [OIII] and H$\\beta$. The group contains four galaxies, of\nwhich two are merging and partly superposing on the line of sight. With a\nsimple parametric model for each velocity field, we succeed in disentangling\nthe contribution of each galaxy and derive their physical state and kinematics.\nThe galaxies are perturbed, and intra-group gas is observed as tidal tails and\nloops. They are mainly disks in rotation, although some regions reveal elevated\ndispersion, typical of out-of-equilibrium gas. All galaxies show sustained star\nformation, with a global star formation rate of 45 M$_\\odot$/yr. We conclude\nthat the long X-ray tail must have come from the hot intra-group medium,\npresent before the group infall, and does not correspond to the ram-pressure\nstripping of the galaxy gas.

    "abstract": "We show that a semi-Dirac (SD) system with an inversion symmetry breaking\nmass exhibits a topological phase transition when irradiated with off-resonant\nlight. Using Floquet theory, we derive the band structure, Chern numbers, phase\ndiagram, and we show that as the light intensity is swept at fixed mass, the SD\nsystem undergoes normal-Chern-normal insulator transition. Along the phase\nboundaries we observe single semi-Dirac-cone (SSDC) semimetal states in which\none SD cone is gapless and the other gapped. The nontrivial Berry curvature\ndistribution $\\Omega(\\mathbf{k}) \\neq -\\Omega ( - \\mathbf{k} )$ generates an\norbital magnetization $M$ and anomalous Nernst ($\\alpha_{xy}$) and thermal Hall\n($\\kappa_{xy}$) conductivities. We show that $M$ remains constant as the Fermi\nlevel $E_F$ scans the insulating gap, but it changes linearly with it in the\nChern insulator (CI) phase, as expected. In the normal insulator phase, we find\nthat $\\alpha_{xy}$ exhibits a dip-peak profile which is reversed in the CI\nphase. We also find that switching the light's circular polarization from left\nto right induces a sign change in $M$, $\\alpha_{xy}$, and $\\kappa_{xy}$,\nregardless of the topological phase, thereby allowing us to reverse the\ndirection of flow of the transverse charge and heat currents. Further, we\nevaluate the components of the charge ($\\sigma_{aa}$), thermoelectric\n($\\alpha_{aa}$), and thermal ($\\kappa_{aa}$) conductivity tensors ($a=x, y$)\nand examine the effect of light on them. With a linear dispersion along the\n$y$-direction, we find that $\\alpha_{yy}$ and $\\kappa_{yy}$ are significantly\nlarger than $\\alpha_{xx}$ and $\\kappa_{xx}$, respectively, due to the much\nlarger squared Dirac velocity $v_y^2$ compared to $v_x^2$.",

In this work, we investigate an edge-based, non-obtrusive\napproach to emotion identification that uses only physiological signals\nobtained via wearable sensors. Our dataset includes data from 40 older\nindividuals. Emotional states were obtained using physiological signals from\nthe Empatica E4 and Shimmer3 GSR+ wristband and facial expressions were\nrecorded using camera-based emotion recognition with the iMotion's Facial\nExpression Analysis (FEA) module. The dataset also contains twelve emotion\ncategories in terms of relative intensities. We aim to study how well emotion\nrecognition can be accomplished using simply physiological sensor data, without\nthe requirement for cameras or intrusive facial analysis. By leveraging\nclassical machine learning models, we predict the intensity of emotional\nresponses based on physiological signals. We achieved the highest 0.782 r2\nscore with the lowest 0.0006 MSE on the regression task. This method has\nsignificant implications for individuals with Alzheimer's Disease and Related\nDementia (ADRD), as well as veterans coping with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder\n(PTSD) or other cognitive impairments.

While extensively studied on\nIntel and AMD CPUs with DDR and LPDDR memories, its impact on GPUs using GDDR\nmemories, critical for emerging machine learning applications, remains\nunexplored. Rowhammer attacks on GPUs face unique challenges: (1) proprietary\nmapping of physical memory to GDDR banks and rows, (2) high memory latency and\nfaster refresh rates that hinder effective hammering, and (3) proprietary\nmitigations in GDDR memories, difficult to reverse-engineer without FPGA-based\ntest platforms. We introduce GPUHammer, the first Rowhammer attack on NVIDIA\nGPUs with GDDR6 DRAM. GPUHammer proposes novel techniques to reverse-engineer\nGDDR DRAM row mappings, and employs GPU-specific memory access optimizations to\namplify hammering intensity and bypass mitigations. Thus, we demonstrate the\nfirst successful Rowhammer attack on a discrete GPU, injecting up to 8\nbit-flips across 4 DRAM banks on an NVIDIA A6000 with GDDR6 memory.

Previous studies analyzing neutrons on carbon\nusing these detectors were primarily focused on lower energy neutrons and\nreactions, and some of these did not have sufficient energy resolution to\nisolate the contributions of reaction channels with similar Q values.\n  Purpose: This work extends neutron-induced reaction cross section\nmeasurements to higher energies, relevant to rare isotope facilities. These\nmeasurements can be used to inform and benchmark simulation of experiments that\nrequire neutron detection, particularly those utilizing organic scintillators.\nFor some experiments, simulations are used to extract physics information from\nexperimental data, reinforcing the need for accurate simulations.\n  Methods: Two sCVD diamond detectors were used as active targets at LANSCE,\nwhere neutrons up to 800 MeV are produced via spallation.\n  Results: Relative cross sections are reported from incident neutron (kinetic)\nenergies E$_n$ = 12 MeV up to 55 MeV for $^{12}$C(n,$\\alpha_0$), up to 46 MeV\nfor $^{12}$C(n,d$_0$), and up to 27 MeV for $^{12}$C(n,p$_0$) and\n$^{12}$C(n,p$_1$). These measurements extend these cross sections to higher\nenergies than those of previous studies.\n  Conclusions: Good agreement is found between this work and recent\nexperimental data from the EXFOR database in the neutron energies where the\nstudies overlap. This work supports the need to update the ENDF evaluation for\nthe (n,$\\alpha_0$) channel with more recent data, and provides data that could\nallow for an evaluation of the (n,p$_0$), (n,p$_1$), and (n,d$_0$) channels.\nThese cross sections will increase the accuracy of simulations by extending the\nenergy range for which empirical cross sections are available.",

One important feature of the\nworst-case DP guarantee is it naturally implies protections against adversaries\nwith less prior information, more sophisticated attack goals, and complex\nmeasures of a successful attack. However, the analytical tradeoffs between the\nadversarial model and the privacy protections conferred by DP are not well\nunderstood thus far. To that end, this work sheds light on what the worst-case\nguarantee of DP implies about the success of attackers that are more\nrepresentative of real-world privacy risks.\n  In this paper, we present a single flexible framework that generalizes and\nextends the patchwork of bounds on DP mechanisms found in prior work. Our\nframework allows us to compute high-probability guarantees for DP mechanisms on\na large family of natural attack settings that previous bounds do not capture.\nOne class of such settings is the approximate reconstruction of multiple\nindividuals' data, such as inferring nearly entire columns of a tabular data\nset from noisy marginals and extracting sensitive information from DP-trained\nlanguage models.\n  We conduct two empirical case studies to illustrate the versatility of our\nbounds and compare them to the success of state-of-the-art attacks.\nSpecifically, we study attacks that extract non-uniform PII from a DP-trained\nlanguage model, as well as multi-column reconstruction attacks where the\nadversary has access to some columns in the clear and attempts to reconstruct\nthe remaining columns for each person's record. We find that the absolute\nprivacy risk of attacking non-uniform data is highly dependent on the\nadversary's prior probability of success. Our high probability bounds give us a\nnuanced understanding of the privacy leakage of DP mechanisms in a variety of\npreviously understudied attack settings.",

We demonstrate how this quantum approach can identify\nweighted $k$-cliques and estimate Betti numbers by leveraging the Gaussian\nboson sampling algorithm's ability to preferentially select high-weight, dense\nsubgraphs. The unique capabilities of our programmable quantum processor allow\nus to observe topological phase transitions and identify clique percolation\nphenomena directly from the entropy of the sampling results.

Therefore, it is crucial to ensure that\nempathy, a fundamental aspect of positive human interactions, already instilled\ninto LLMs, is retained by SLMs after distillation.

    "abstract": "Modern Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly trained to support very\nlarge context windows. Unfortunately the ability to use long contexts in\ngeneration is complicated by the large memory requirement of the KV cache,\nwhich scales linearly with the context length. This memory footprint is often\nthe dominant resource bottleneck in real-world deployments, limiting throughput\nand increasing serving cost. One way to address this is by compressing the KV\ncache, which can be done either with knowledge of the question being asked\n(query-aware) or without knowledge of the query (query-agnostic). We present\nCompactor, a parameter-free, query-agnostic KV compression strategy that uses\napproximate leverage scores to determine token importance. We show that\nCompactor can achieve the same performance as competing methods while retaining\n1/2 the tokens in both synthetic and real-world context tasks, with minimal\ncomputational overhead. We further introduce a procedure for context-calibrated\ncompression, which allows one to infer the maximum compression ratio a given\ncontext can support. Using context-calibrated compression, we show that\nCompactor achieves full KV performance on Longbench while reducing the KV\nmemory burden by 63%, on average.

Beyond their response to external fields, the optical\nabsorption and emission spectra also reflect information about the host matrix,\nwhich is critical to understand for either application. For the particular\nsystem of thulium atoms implanted in solid argon, high resolution laser\nspectroscopy reveals narrow ensemble linewidths of the 1140 nm f to f ground\nstate spin-orbit transition, which is split due to crystal field effects and\nhyperfine coupling. Pump-probe spectroscopy is used to identify crystal field\nlevels in at least two stable trapping sites, and the crystal field is\ndetermined to be nearly axial in both sites. Strong selection rules indicate\nthat this transition becomes magnetic-electric in the argon host, most likely\ndue to dielectric effects. In the presence of mT magnetic fields, Zeeman shifts\nare resolvable by laser fluorescence, allowing crystal axis selective polarized\nspectroscopy.

However, optimization-based 3DGS methods struggle\nwith sparse views due to limited prior knowledge.

To address these challenges, we propose RegGS, a\n3D Gaussian registration-based framework for reconstructing unposed sparse\nviews. RegGS aligns local 3D Gaussians generated by a feed-forward network into\na globally consistent 3D Gaussian representation.

This\nenables a coarse-to-fine registration process while accurately estimating\ncamera poses and aligning the scene.

    "abstract": "We investigate the topological consequences of coupling chiral fermions to\nlocal, dispersionless phonons. This interaction induces a splitting of the\nphonon spectrum into three bands: a flat band and two bands with linear\ndispersion, all of which are degenerate at a nodal point located at zero\nwavevector. The flat band exhibits vanishing Berry curvature, while the\nlinearly dispersing bands carry nontrivial topological features. Their Berry\ncurvature fields assume a hedgehog-like structure in momentum space, analogous\nto monopole configurations, and reflect the chirality of the underlying\nfermionic system. Moreover, the effective phonon response reveals a phonon\nparity anomaly, observable as a discontinuity in the phonon current. This\nanomaly originates from the singularities of the fermion Green's function and\nsignals the transfer of topological information from fermions to phonons. Our\nresults demonstrate that phonon currents provide a direct probe of electronic\nchirality and topological structures. The framework offers a foundation for\nextending topological concepts to interacting bosonic systems and may guide the\nengineering of phononic materials with tunable geometric and topological\nproperties.",

In this paper, we conduct a\ntheoretical study of the electronic structure of the bilayer polymorph of\nLa$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ using the hybrid functional approach, which is well suited to\ntackle the non-local correlation effects arising in this system from the\nmolecular orbital splitting of the Ni $3d_{3z^2-r^2}$ states inside Ni-Ni\ndimers. Our calculations reveal that bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ is a strongly\ncorrelated magnetic system with robust Ni spin moments. Spin moments on\nindividual Ni sites take on unusually small values because of the electron\ndelocalization over molecular orbitals involving multiple Ni and O sites. We\nfurther find that the magnetism of bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ is intimately\nlinked with charge distribution between different Ni and O orbitals. Two\ndistinct regimes are identified in this regard. In one, molecular orbital\nphysics drives the Ni $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ band towards half-filling, which is a\nwell-established condition for unconventional high-temperature\nsuperconductivity upon hole doping in cuprates. In the other, the Ni\n$3d_{x^2-y^2}$ band is quarter-filled favouring spin- and charge-density wave\nstates and Ni-O bond-disproportionation, which is consistent with several\nrecent experimental claims. It is possible that superconductivity in\nLa$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ occurs as a result of a pressure-induced transition between\nthese two competing regimes. Since none of the low energy phases discovered in\nthis study are metallic, non-stoichiometry would be required for\nsuperconductivity to occur.",

The WD is descended\nfrom the merged inner binary, and the original tertiary is now the observed BL.\nThe likely formation scenario involves a common envelope while the WD\nprogenitor is on the AGB, and thus the observed orbital period of 359 days\nrequires an efficient common envelope ejection. The rapid rotation of the BL\nindicates it accreted some material during its evolution, perhaps via a wind\nprior to the common envelope.

    "abstract": "The recent discovery of the third interstellar object (3I/ATLAS) expands the\nknown census from two to three and significantly improves statistical\ninferences regarding the underlying galactic population. In this paper, we\nargue that cometary activity likely significantly contributes to 3I/ATLAS's\nbrightness, since the nuclear size inferred when assuming an asteroidal\nreflectance implies an untenable interstellar object mass per star. 3I/ATLAS\nexhibits a high excess velocity of $v_\\infty=58$ km/s relative to the Sun,\nwhich implies that 3I/ATLAS is relatively old in comparison to previous\ninterstellar objects. Here, we calculate the posterior distribution of ages\nimplied by the kinematics of the interstellar objects and find that 3I/ATLAS is\nlikely $\\sim3-11$ Gyr old, assuming that the interstellar object and stellar\nage-velocity dispersion relations are equivalent. We also calculate the\ndistribution of host star metallicities and find that 3I/ATLAS has a 12% chance\nof originating from a star with $\\text{[Fe/H]}\\leq-0.4$. These results show\nthat interstellar object formation is likely efficient at low metallicities and\nearly in the history of the Galaxy. Finally, we estimate the interstellar\nobject formation rate throughout Galactic history implied by these three\nobjects. As future interstellar objects are discovered, the framework presented\nhere can be applied to further refine this calculation. Comparison between the\ninterstellar object and stellar formation histories will provide unique\ninsights into the history of stellar system formation in the Galaxy.",

    "abstract": "\\textit{Mallows model} is a widely-used probabilistic framework for learning\nfrom ranking data, with applications ranging from recommendation systems and\nvoting to aligning language models with human\npreferences~\\cite{chen2024mallows, kleinberg2021algorithmic,\nrafailov2024direct}. Under this model, observed rankings are noisy\nperturbations of a central ranking $\\sigma$, with likelihood decaying\nexponentially in distance from $\\sigma$, i.e, $P (\\pi) \\propto \\exp\\big(-\\beta\n\\cdot d(\\pi, \\sigma)\\big),$ where $\\beta > 0$ controls dispersion and $d$ is a\ndistance function.\n  Existing methods mainly focus on fixed distances (such as Kendall's $\\tau$\ndistance), with no principled approach to learning the distance metric directly\nfrom data. In practice, however, rankings naturally vary by context; for\ninstance, in some sports we regularly see long-range swaps (a low-rank team\nbeating a high-rank one), while in others such events are rare. Motivated by\nthis, we propose a generalization of Mallows model that learns the distance\nmetric directly from data. Specifically, we focus on $L_\\alpha$ distances:\n$d_\\alpha(\\pi,\\sigma):=\\sum_{i=1} |\\pi(i)-\\sigma(i)|^\\alpha$.\n  For any $\\alpha\\geq 1$ and $\\beta>0$, we develop a Fully Polynomial-Time\nApproximation Scheme (FPTAS) to efficiently generate samples that are\n$\\epsilon$- close (in total variation distance) to the true distribution. Even\nin the special cases of $L_1$ and $L_2$, this generalizes prior results that\nrequired vanishing dispersion ($\\beta\\to0$). Using this sampling algorithm, we\npropose an efficient Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) algorithm that jointly\nestimates the central ranking, the dispersion parameter, and the optimal\ndistance metric. We prove strong consistency results for our estimators (for\nany values of $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$), and we validate our approach empirically\nusing datasets from sports rankings.",

Time-bin quantum bits (qubits) can be produced in various ways, and each\nimplementation calls for different considerations regarding design parameters,\ncomponent compatibility (optical, electrical, electro-optical), and measurement\nprocedures.

This leads us to explore the preparation and characterization of\ntime-bin entanglement and examine requirements for interference of time-bins\nfrom separate sources. Further, we cover preparation and characterization\ntechniques for high-dimensional time-bin states, namely qudits, and the\ngeneration of time-bin entangled qudit pairs.

    "abstract": "This work focuses on financial risks from a probabilistic point of view. The\nvalue of a firm is described as a geometric Brownian motion and default emerges\nas a first passage time event. On the technical side, the critical threshold\nthat the value process has to cross to trigger the default is assumed to be an\narbitrary continuous function, what constitutes a generalization of the\nclassical Black-Cox model. Such a generality favors modeling a wide range of\nrisk scenarios, including those characterized by strongly time-varying\nconditions; but at the same time limits the possibility of obtaining\nclosed-form formulae. To avoid this limitation, we implement a qualitative\nclassification of risk into three categories: high, medium, and low. They\ncorrespond, respectively, to a finite mean first passage time, to an almost\nsurely finite first passage time with infinite mean, and to a positive\nprobability of survival for all times. This allows for an extensive\nclassification of risk based only on the asymptotic behavior of the default\nfunction, which generalizes previously known results that assumed this function\nto be an exponential. However, even within these mathematical conditions, such\na classification is not exhaustive, as a consequence of the behavioral freedom\nthat continuous functions enjoy. Overall, our results contribute to the design\nof credit risk classifications from analytical principles and, at the same\ntime, constitute a call of attention on potential models of risk assessment in\nsituations largely affected by time evolution.",

The analysis relied on neutrino flux\npredictions - based on gamma ray observations - to model the expected neutrino\nemission from the galactic plane. Three signal hypotheses describing different\npossible spatial and energy distributions were tested, where the single free\nparameter in each test was the normalization of the neutrino flux.

An unbinned maximum-likelihood analysis is used that can fit the\nspectral index and the flux normalization separately in each segment.

    "abstract": "Accurate estimation of building heights using very high resolution (VHR)\nsynthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery is crucial for various urban\napplications. This paper introduces a Deep Learning (DL)-based methodology for\nautomated building height estimation from single VHR COSMO-SkyMed images: an\nobject-based regression approach based on bounding box detection followed by\nheight estimation. This model was trained and evaluated on a unique\nmulti-continental dataset comprising eight geographically diverse cities across\nEurope, North and South America, and Asia, employing a cross-validation\nstrategy to explicitly assess out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. The\nresults demonstrate highly promising performance, particularly on European\ncities where the model achieves a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of approximately\none building story (2.20 m in Munich), significantly outperforming recent\nstate-of-the-art methods in similar OOD scenarios. Despite the increased\nvariability observed when generalizing to cities in other continents,\nparticularly in Asia with its distinct urban typologies and prevalence of\nhigh-rise structures, this study underscores the significant potential of DL\nfor robust cross-city and cross-continental transfer learning in building\nheight estimation from single VHR SAR data.",

    "abstract": "Background: Mental illnesses such as depression and anxiety require improved\nmethods for early detection and personalized intervention. Traditional\npredictive models often rely on unimodal data or early fusion strategies that\nfail to capture the complex, multimodal nature of psychiatric data. Advanced\nintegration techniques, such as intermediate (latent space) fusion, may offer\nbetter accuracy and clinical utility. Methods: Using data from the BRIGHTEN\nclinical trial, we evaluated intermediate (latent space) fusion for predicting\ndaily depressive symptoms (PHQ-2 scores). We compared early fusion implemented\nwith a Random Forest (RF) model and intermediate fusion implemented via a\nCombined Model (CM) using autoencoders and a neural network. The dataset\nincluded behavioral (smartphone-based), demographic, and clinical features.\nExperiments were conducted across multiple temporal splits and data stream\ncombinations. Performance was evaluated using mean squared error (MSE) and\ncoefficient of determination (R2). Results: The CM outperformed both RF and\nLinear Regression (LR) baselines across all setups, achieving lower MSE (0.4985\nvs. 0.5305 with RF) and higher R2 (0.4695 vs. 0.4356). The RF model showed\nsigns of overfitting, with a large gap between training and test performance,\nwhile the CM maintained consistent generalization. Performance was best when\nintegrating all data modalities in the CM (in contradistinction to RF),\nunderscoring the value of latent space fusion for capturing non-linear\ninteractions in complex psychiatric datasets. Conclusion: Latent space fusion\noffers a robust alternative to traditional fusion methods for prediction with\nmultimodal mental health data. Future work should explore model\ninterpretability and individual-level prediction for clinical deployment.",

    "abstract": "One of the most commonly observed solar radio sources in the metric and\ndecametric wavelengths is the solar noise storm. These are generally associated\nwith active regions and are believed to be powered by the plasma emission\nmechanism. Since plasma emission emits primarily at the fundamental and\nharmonic of the local plasma frequency, it is significantly affected by density\ninhomogeneities in the solar corona. The source can become significantly\nscatter-broadened due to the multi-path propagation caused by refraction from\nthe density inhomogeneities. Past observational and theoretical estimates\nsuggest some minimum observable source size in the solar corona. The details of\nthis limit, however, depends on the modeling approach and details of the\ncoronal turbulence model chosen. Hence pushing the minimum observable source\nsize to smaller values can help constrain the plasma environment of the\nobserved sources. In this work, we for the first time, use data from the\nupgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope in the 250--500 MHz band, to determine\nmultiple instances of very small-scale structures in the noise storms. We also\nfind that these structures are stable over timescales of 15--30 minutes. By\ncomparing the past observations of Type III radio bursts and noise storms, we\nhypothesize that the primary reason behind the detection of these small sources\nin noise storm is due to the local environment of the noise storm. We also\nbuild an illustrative model and propose some conditions under which the minimum\nobservable source size predicted by theoretical models, can be lowered\nsignificantly.",

While memory-efficient methods like parameter-efficient\nfine-tuning (e.g., LoRA) and optimizer state compression exist, recent\napproaches like GaLore bridge these by using low-rank gradient projections and\nsubspace moment accumulation. However, such methods may struggle with fixed\nsubspaces or computationally costly offline resampling (e.g., requiring\nfull-matrix SVDs). We propose Momentum Factorized SGD (MoFaSGD), which\nmaintains a dynamically updated low-rank SVD representation of the first-order\nmomentum, closely approximating its full-rank counterpart throughout training.\nThis factorization enables a memory-efficient fine-tuning method that\nadaptively updates the optimization subspace at each iteration. Crucially,\nMoFaSGD leverages the computed low-rank momentum factors to perform efficient\nspectrally normalized updates, offering an alternative to subspace moment\naccumulation. We establish theoretical convergence guarantees for MoFaSGD,\nproving it achieves an optimal rate for non-convex stochastic optimization\nunder standard assumptions. Empirically, we demonstrate MoFaSGD's effectiveness\non large language model alignment benchmarks, achieving a competitive trade-off\nbetween memory reduction (comparable to LoRA) and performance compared to\nstate-of-the-art low-rank optimization methods.

Emission from high-IP species is spatially coincident with the\nionization cones and not with star-forming regions.\n  Using the [Ne V]24/[Ne V]14 ratio, we derive an electron density of\n(750+-440) cm^(-3), in agreement with values from the [S II] optical doublet.\n  For the first time, we apply a fully self-consistent approach combining\nadvanced photoionization and kinematic models (HOMERUN+MOKA3D) to constrain\nintrinsic outflow properties, overcoming the limitations of simplified\nclassical methods. Exploiting the synergy of JWST/MIRI and VLT/MUSE, HOMERUN\nreproduces fluxes of over 60 emission lines from optical to mid-IR,\ndisentangling AGN and star formation contributions and yielding robust\nestimates of outflow mass, geometry, and energetics.",

    "abstract": "In the typical implementation of a quantum error-correcting code, each\nstabilizer is measured by entangling one or more ancilla qubits with the data\nqubits and measuring the ancilla qubits to deduce the value of the stabilizer.\nRecently, the dynamic circuit approach has been introduced, in which\nstabilizers are measured without ancilla qubits. Here, we demonstrate that\ndynamic circuits are particularly useful for the Floquet code. Our dynamic\ncircuit increases the timelike distance of the code, automatically removes\nleakage, and both significantly increases the threshold and lowers the logical\nerror rate compared to the standard ancilla-based circuit. At a physical error\nrate of $10^{-3}$, we estimate a nearly $3\\times$ reduction in the number of\nqubits required to reach a $10^{-12}$ logical error rate.",

However,\nthe role of concept combinations in the training data on compositional\ngeneralization is largely unclear -- for instance, how does accuracy vary when\na common object appears in an uncommon pairing with another object? In this\npaper, we investigate how word co-occurrence statistics in the pretraining\ndataset (a proxy for co-occurrence of visual concepts) impacts CLIP/LMM\nperformance. To disentangle the effects of word co-occurrence frequencies from\nsingle-word frequencies, we measure co-occurrence with pointwise mutual\ninformation (PMI), which normalizes the joint probability of two words\nco-occurring by the probability of co-occurring independently. Using\nsynthetically generated images with a variety of concept pairs, we show a\nstrong correlation between PMI in the CLIP pretraining data and zero-shot\naccuracy in CLIP models trained on LAION-400M (r=0.97 and 14% accuracy gap\nbetween images in the top and bottom 5% of PMI values), demonstrating that even\naccuracy on common concepts is affected by the combination of concepts in the\nimage. Leveraging this finding, we reproduce this effect in natural images by\nediting them to contain pairs with varying PMI, resulting in a correlation of\nr=0.75. Finally, we demonstrate that this behavior in CLIP transfers to LMMs\nbuilt on top of CLIP (r=0.70 for TextVQA, r=0.62 for VQAv2).

Recent adaptive tokenization methods address this by allocating\nvariable-length representations but typically require test-time search over\nmultiple encodings to find the most predictive one.

In particular, each\nlayer from the pretrained model can be skipped/pruned or repeated multiple\ntimes as recurrent neural networks (RNN), and stacked with others in arbitrary\norders, yielding a chain-of-layers (CoLa) per sample.

The new, component-wise\nbaryonification (BFC) approach provides a self-consistent framework to model\nfeedback effects for different observables. In this paper we use this framework\nto fit kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) observations from the Atacama\nCosmology Telescope (ACT) alongside halo X-ray gas fractions from eROSITA,\ninvestigating baryonic feedback in a cosmological context. We first show that\nthe kSZ data from ACT is consistent with the gas fractions from eROSITA, both\nsuggesting a feedback model that is stronger than what is assumed in most\nhydrodynamical simulations. This finding is in contrast to older, pre-eROSITA\ngas fraction measurements that point towards weaker feedback in tension with\nthe kSZ results. We suspect these discrepancies to be due to selection bias in\nthe pre-eROSITA sample, or differences in halo mass estimation between the two\ndata sets. In a further step, we use the BFC model to predict the baryonic\nsuppression of the matter power spectrum. Based on our combined fit to data\nfrom ACT and eROSITA, we find a power spectrum suppression that exceeds the\npercent-level at modes above $k=0.3-0.6 \\,h\\,\\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, growing to 2-8\npercent at $k=1\\,h\\,\\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, and to 20-25 percent at\n$k=5\\,h\\,\\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, consistent with strong-feedback hydrodynamical\nsimulations. Finally, we compare our best-fitting model to the observed gas\ndensity and pressure profiles of massive galaxy clusters from the X-COP sample,\nfinding excellent agreement. These results show that BFC provides a\nself-consistent picture of feedback across mass- and length scales as well as\ndifferent cosmological observables, thus making it promising for applications\nto multiwavelength studies to jointly constrain cosmology and baryonic effects.",

    "abstract": "Video large language models (LLMs) achieve strong video understanding by\nleveraging a large number of spatio-temporal tokens, but suffer from quadratic\ncomputational scaling with token count. To address this, we propose a\ntraining-free spatio-temporal token merging method, named STTM. Our key insight\nis to exploit local spatial and temporal redundancy in video data which has\nbeen overlooked in prior work. STTM first transforms each frame into\nmulti-granular spatial tokens using a coarse-to-fine search over a quadtree\nstructure, then performs directed pairwise merging across the temporal\ndimension. This decomposed merging approach outperforms existing token\nreduction methods across six video QA benchmarks. Notably, STTM achieves a\n2$\\times$ speed-up with only a 0.5% accuracy drop under a 50% token budget, and\na 3$\\times$ speed-up with just a 2% drop under a 30% budget. Moreover, STTM is\nquery-agnostic, allowing KV cache reuse across different questions for the same\nvideo. The project page is available at https://www.jshyun.me/projects/sttm.",

Training\nexpressive policy classes with online RL present a unique challenge of stable\nvalue maximization. Unlike simpler Gaussian policies commonly used in online\nRL, expressive policies like diffusion and flow-matching policies are\nparameterized by a long denoising chain, which hinders stable gradient\npropagation from actions to policy parameters when optimizing against some\nvalue function. Our key insight is that we can address stable value\nmaximization by avoiding direct optimization over value with the expressive\npolicy and instead construct an on-the-fly RL policy to maximize Q-value. We\npropose Expressive Policy Optimization (EXPO), a sample-efficient online RL\nalgorithm that utilizes an on-the-fly policy to maximize value with two\nparameterized policies -- a larger expressive base policy trained with a stable\nimitation learning objective and a light-weight Gaussian edit policy that edits\nthe actions sampled from the base policy toward a higher value distribution.\nThe on-the-fly policy optimizes the actions from the base policy with the\nlearned edit policy and chooses the value maximizing action from the base and\nedited actions for both sampling and temporal-difference (TD) backup. Our\napproach yields up to 2-3x improvement in sample efficiency on average over\nprior methods both in the setting of fine-tuning a pretrained policy given\noffline data and in leveraging offline data to train online.",

For instance, CLIP models learn bag-of-words representations and,\nas a consequence, fail to distinguish whether an image is of ``a yellow\nsubmarine and a blue bus'' or ``a blue submarine and a yellow bus''. Previous\nattempts to fix this issue added hard negatives during training or modified the\narchitecture, but failed to resolve the problem in its entirety. We suspect\nthat the missing insights to solve the binding problem for CLIP are hidden in\narguably the most important part of learning algorithms: the data. In this\nwork, we fill this gap by rigorously identifying the influence of data\nproperties on CLIP's ability to learn binding using a synthetic dataset. We\nfind that common properties of natural data such as low attribute density,\nincomplete captions, and the saliency bias, a tendency of human captioners to\ndescribe the object that is ``most salient'' to them, have a detrimental effect\non binding performance. In contrast to common belief, we find that neither\nscaling the batch size, i.e., implicitly adding more hard negatives, nor\nexplicitly creating hard negatives enables CLIP to learn reliable binding.

Our M3arsSynth engine spans a wide range of Martian terrains and\nacquisition dates, enabling the generation of physically accurate 3D surface\nmodels at metric-scale resolution. MarsGen, fine-tuned on M3arsSynth data,\nsynthesizes videos conditioned on an initial image frame and, optionally,\ncamera trajectories or textual prompts, allowing for video generation in novel\nenvironments. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms video\nsynthesis models trained on terrestrial datasets, achieving superior visual\nfidelity and 3D structural consistency.",

By injecting instructions into the data accessed by the\nsystem, the attacker is able to override the initial user task with an\narbitrary task directed by the attacker. To secure the system, test-time\ndefenses, e.g., defensive prompting, have been proposed for system developers\nto attain security only when needed in a flexible manner. However, they are\nmuch less effective than training-time defenses that change the model\nparameters. Motivated by this, we propose DefensiveToken, a test-time defense\nwith prompt injection robustness comparable to training-time alternatives.\nDefensiveTokens are newly inserted as special tokens, whose embeddings are\noptimized for security. In security-sensitive cases, system developers can\nappend a few DefensiveTokens before the LLM input to achieve security with a\nminimal utility drop. In scenarios where security is less of a concern,\ndevelopers can simply skip DefensiveTokens; the LLM system remains the same as\nthere is no defense, generating high-quality responses. Thus, DefensiveTokens,\nif released alongside the model, allow a flexible switch between the\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) utility and almost-SOTA security at test time.

Data is encrypted not only during rest\nand transit, but also during processing. However, FHE provides a limited\ninstruction set: SIMD addition, SIMD multiplication, and cyclic rotation of 1-D\nvectors. This restriction makes performing multi-dimensional tensor operations\nchallenging. Practitioners must pack these tensors into 1-D vectors and map\ntensor operations onto this one-dimensional layout rather than their\ntraditional nested structure. And while prior systems have made significant\nstrides in automating this process, they often hide critical packing decisions\nbehind layers of abstraction, making debugging, optimizing, and building on top\nof these systems difficult.\n  In this work, we approach multi-dimensional tensor operations in FHE through\nEinstein summation (einsum) notation. Einsum notation explicitly encodes\ndimensional structure and operations in its syntax, naturally exposing how\ntensors should be packed and transformed. We decompose einsum expressions into\na fixed set of FHE-friendly operations. We implement our design and present\nEinHops, a minimalist system that factors einsum expressions into a fixed\nsequence of FHE operations. EinHops enables developers to perform encrypted\ntensor operations using FHE while maintaining full visibility into the\nunderlying packing strategy.

We include the non-holomorphic\nterms induced by the supersymmetry breaking and involve them in the\nrenormalization group evolution. The main impact from the non-holomorphic terms\narises in the right-handed stau mass, which requires large hypercharge\ninteractions with the messengers to accommodate non-tachyonic staus. With the\nnon-holomorphic terms, the stau mass-square can remain positive in the\nrenormalization group evolution, even if the hypercharge interactions are\nsmall. Although the radiative non-holomorphic contributions enhance the mass\nspectrum, their effects in the sparticle mixing rather reduce their overall\ncontributions such that we realize about 25 GeV difference in the right-handed\nstau mass, while the difference is lowered by about 5 TeV in the lightest\nmass-eigenstate of staus. We realize 6-7 TeV difference in the sbottom mass,\nand about 15 TeV in the stop mass. These contributions in the sparticle masses\nalso affect the SM-like Higgs boson mass, and we find that the SM-like Higgs\nboson can be enhanced as much as about 80 GeV. In a small region of the\nparameter space we also observe negative non-holomorphic contributions which do\nnot exceed about 1 TeV for the sparticles, and 20 GeV for the SM-like Higgs\nboson. An interesting impact from the non-holomorphic terms happens in the muon\ng-2 results. We find that the non-holomorphic contributions can provide a\nsignificant decreasing in supersymmetric contributions to muon g-2. We realize\nthat the muon g-2 results can be decreased as much as about -50 x 10^-10 by the\nnon-holomorphic contributions, and consequently one can still accommodate light\nsleptons and gauginos in the spectrum.",

Thus, high-mass outliers to the gravitational-wave\nsource population are often proposed as natural candidates for strongly lensed\nevents. However, when using a data-driven method for identifying population\noutliers, we find that high-mass outliers are not necessarily strongly lensed,\nnor will the majority of strongly-lensed signals appear as high-mass outliers.\nThis is both because statistical fluctuations produce a larger effect on\nobserved binary parameters than does lensing magnification, and because\nlensing-induced outliers must originate from intrinsically high-mass sources,\nwhich are rare. Thus, the appearance of a single lensing-induced outlier\nimplies the existence of many other lensed events within the catalog. We\nadditionally show that it is possible to constrain the strong lensing optical\ndepth, which is a fundamental quantity of our Universe, with the detection or\nabsence of high-mass outliers.

In\nthis work, we focus on a variation of the multi-species open Dicke model which\nrealizes mediated nonreciprocal interactions between the spin species and,\nconsequently, an interesting dynamical limit-cycle phase. In particular, we\nimprove upon adiabatic elimination and, instead, employ a Redfield master\nequation in order to describe the effective dynamics of the spin-only system.\nWe assess this approach at the mean-field level, comparing it both to adiabatic\nelimination and the full spin-cavity model, and find that the predictions are\nsensitive to the presence of single-particle incoherent decay. Additionally, we\nclarify the symmetries of the model and explore the dynamical limit-cycle phase\nin the case of explicit parity-time-symmetry breaking, finding a region of\nphase coexistence terminating at an codimension-two exceptional point.

MIRIX consists of six distinct, carefully structured\nmemory types: Core, Episodic, Semantic, Procedural, Resource Memory, and\nKnowledge Vault, coupled with a multi-agent framework that dynamically controls\nand coordinates updates and retrieval. This design enables agents to persist,\nreason over, and accurately retrieve diverse, long-term user data at scale. We\nvalidate MIRIX in two demanding settings.

Since the\nmost interesting part of the result contains unsaturated spinor indices, we\ninclude a constant spinor to saturate those indices. At dimension zero, this\ngives rise to a new set of invariants and a closely related new set of possible\nsupersymmetry anomalies in the theory, and we call this an `exotic pair'.

First, we introduce a compact table notation for describing\narrangements of pseudolines, enabling the representation and analysis of\ncomplex cases, including symmetrical arrangements, arrangements with parallel\nlines, and arrangements with multiple-line intersection points. Building on\nthis, we provide a simple heuristic method and tools for recovering\nstraight-line arrangements from a given table, with the ability to enforce\nadditional properties such as symmetries. The tool successfully recovers\narrangements for many previously known optimal solutions. Additionally, we\ndevelop a tool that transforms the search for optimal Kobon arrangement tables\ninto a SAT problem, allowing us to leverage modern SAT solvers (specifically\nKissat) to efficiently find new solutions or to show that no other solutions\nexist (for example, confirming that no optimal solution exists in the 11-line\ncase). Using these techniques, we find new optimal Kobon arrangements for 23\nand 27 lines, along with several other new results.",

While these techniques already establish\nthat data from the training set can be reconstructed, they often rely on\nhigh-resources, excess to the training set as well as well-engineered and\ndesigned prompts.\n  In this work, we devise a new attack that requires low resources, assumes\nlittle to no access to the actual training set, and identifies, seemingly,\nbenign prompts that lead to potentially-risky image reconstruction. This\nhighlights the risk that images might even be reconstructed by an uninformed\nuser and unintentionally.

An\ninstance of CSP$(P)$ is called non-redundant if it does not contain any\nredundant clause. The non-redundancy (NRD) of a predicate $P$ is the maximum\nnumber of clauses in a non-redundant instance of CSP$(P)$, as a function of the\nnumber of variables $n$. Recent progress has shown that non-redundancy is\ncrucially linked to many other important questions in computer science and\nmathematics including sparsification, kernelization, query complexity,\nuniversal algebra, and extremal combinatorics. Given that non-redundancy is a\nnexus for many of these important problems, the central goal of this paper is\nto more deeply understand non-redundancy.\n  Our first main result shows that for every rational number $r \\ge 1$, there\nexists a finite CSP predicate $P$ such that the non-redundancy of $P$ is\n$\\Theta(n^r)$. Our second main result explores the concept of conditional\nnon-redundancy first coined by Brakensiek and Guruswami [STOC 2025]. We\ncompletely classify the conditional non-redundancy of all binary predicates\n(i.e., constraints on two variables) by connecting these non-redundancy\nproblems to the structure of high-girth graphs in extremal combinatorics.\n  Inspired by these concrete results, we build off the work of Carbonnel [CP\n2022] to develop an algebraic theory of conditional non-redundancy. As an\napplication of this algebraic theory, we revisit the notion of Mal'tsev\nembeddings, which is the most general technique known to date for establishing\nthat a predicate has linear non-redundancy. For example, we provide the first\nexample of predicate with a Mal'tsev embedding that cannot be attributed to the\nstructure of an Abelian group, but rather to the structure of the quantum Pauli\ngroup.",

Since the final-state\nphoton carries a large fraction of the initial dark matter's energy, this\nprocess offers a compelling handle for probing scalar portal dark matter\nscenarios. Their distinctive energy, angular, and timing distributions allow\nfor effective separation of signal from neutrino-induced backgrounds. We\nanalyze several models featuring different couplings to the scalar mediator,\nwith the scalar photon coupling serving as the common detection channel. To\ndistinguish between the models, we further examined their distinct spatial\ndistributions. We considered the flux of dark matter produced both at the\ntarget and absorber of neutrino facilities such as the BNB, NuMI, and LBNF, and\ninvestigated the sensitivities at the ongoing SBND, ICARUS-NuMI, and future\nDUNE ND detectors. We further investigated the differences in the DM fluxes\narising from various production mechanisms, as well as the distinctions between\nthe target and absorber contributions. Our results demonstrate that the\nsensitivities at the considered experiments, especially DUNE ND, can place\nsignificantly improved constraints on viable parameter space in various\nscenarios.",

    "abstract": "The coercivity panorama for characterizing the dynamic hysteresis in\ninteracting systems across multiple timescales is proposed by Chen et al. in a\ncompanion paper. For the stochastic $\\phi^4$ model under periodic driving of\nrate $v_H$, the coercivity landscape $H_c(v_H)$ exhibits plateau features at a\ncharacteristic rate $v_P$ with the corresponding coercivity $H_P$. Below this\nplateau ($v_H<v_P$), the $H_c\\sim v_H$ scaling obtained in the near-equilibrium\nregime becomes inaccessible in the thermodynamic limit. Above the plateau\n($v_H>v_P$), scaling in the fast-driving regime, $H_c\\sim v_H^{1/2}$, is\ncompletely different from that, $H_c-H_P\\sim (v_H-v_P)^{2/3}$, in the\npost-plateau slow-driving regime. The emergence of the plateau with a\nfinite-size scaling reflects the competition between the thermodynamic limit\nand the quasi-static limit. In this paper, we provide detailed analytical\nproofs and numerical evidence supporting these results. Moreover, to\ndemonstrate the coercivity panorama in concrete physical systems, we study the\nmagnetic hysteresis in the Curie-Weiss model and analyze its finite-size\neffects.

Large-scale density-matrix renormalization group\n(DMRG) calculations reveal that, as the FCI gap closes, two nearly degenerate\nphases emerge before the system turns metallic: a chiral $f$-wave\nsuperconductor and a $\\sqrt{3} \\times \\sqrt{3}$ charge-density wave (CDW) whose\nenergies differ by less than $1\\%$. These two competing states mirror the\nsuperconducting and re-entrant integer quantum Hall (RIQH) phases observed\nexperimentally near the FCI regime. The superconducting dome survives realistic\nCoulomb interaction, light doping, and various lattice geometry. Melting the\nFCI therefore provides a new mechanism for realizing spin-polarized chiral\nsuperconductivity and RIQH order. We predict that twisted MoTe$_2$ at larger\ntwist angles will develop a superconducting dome even at filling $\\nu = 2/3$,\nand suppressing this superconductivity with a magnetic field should drive the\nsystem into an RIQH state.",

Three-dimensional Time-of-Flight Magnetic Resonance\nAngiography (3D TOF MRA) is widely used to visualize cerebral vasculature,\nhowever, clinical evaluations generally focus on major arterial abnormalities,\noverlooking quantitative metrics critical for understanding subtle vascular\nchanges. Existing methods for extracting structural, geometrical and\nmorphological arterial features from MRA - whether manual or automated - face\nchallenges including user-dependent variability, steep learning curves, and\nlack of standardized quantitative validations. We propose a novel\nsemi-supervised artery evaluation framework, named ArteryX, a MATLAB-based\ntoolbox that quantifies vascular features with high accuracy and efficiency,\nachieving processing times ~10-15 minutes per subject at 0.5 mm resolution with\nminimal user intervention. ArteryX employs a vessel-fused network based\nlandmarking approach to reliably track and manage tracings, effectively\naddressing the issue of dangling/disconnected vessels. Validation on human\nsubjects with cerebral small vessel disease demonstrated its improved\nsensitivity to subtle vascular changes and better performance than an existing\nsemi-automated method. Importantly, the ArteryX toolbox enables quantitative\nfeature validation by integrating an in-vivo like artery simulation framework\nutilizing vessel-fused graph nodes and predefined ground-truth features for\nspecific artery types. Thus, the ArteryX framework holds promise for\nbenchmarking feature extraction toolboxes and for seamless integration into\nclinical workflows, enabling early detection of cerebrovascular pathology and\nstandardized comparisons across patient cohorts to advance understanding of\nvascular contributions to brain health.",

We carried out a large-scale between-subjects user study (N\n= 750) to compare the influence of warning dialogues supplemented with manually\ngenerated explanations against those generated by two LLMs, Claude 3.5 Sonnet\nand Llama 3.3 70B.

Feature-based explanations\nwere more effective for genuine phishing attempts, whereas counterfactual\nexplanations diminished false-positive rates.

However, there is an inherent bias in the clicks of users due\nto position bias, i.e., users are more likely to click highly-ranked documents\nthan low-ranked documents. To address this bias when training LTR models, many\napproaches from the literature re-weight the users' click data using Inverse\nPropensity Scoring (IPS). IPS re-weights the user's clicks proportionately to\nthe position in the historical ranking that a document was placed when it was\nclicked since low-ranked documents are less likely to be seen by a user. In\nthis paper, we argue that low-ranked documents that are similar to\nhighly-ranked relevant documents are also likely to be relevant. Moreover,\naccounting for the similarity of low-ranked documents to highly ranked relevant\ndocuments when calculating IPS can more effectively mitigate the effects of\nposition bias. Therefore, we propose an extension to IPS, called IPSsim, that\ntakes into consideration the similarity of documents when estimating IPS. We\nevaluate our IPSsim estimator using two large publicly available LTR datasets\nunder a number of simulated user click settings, and with different numbers of\ntraining clicks. Our experiments show that our IPSsim estimator is more\neffective than the existing IPS estimators for learning an unbiased LTR model,\nparticularly in top-n settings when n >= 30.

    "abstract": "Learning is a complex dynamical process shaped by a range of interconnected\ndecisions. Careful design of hyperparameter schedules for artificial neural\nnetworks or efficient allocation of cognitive resources by biological learners\ncan dramatically affect performance. Yet, theoretical understanding of optimal\nlearning strategies remains sparse, especially due to the intricate interplay\nbetween evolving meta-parameters and nonlinear learning dynamics. The search\nfor optimal protocols is further hindered by the high dimensionality of the\nlearning space, often resulting in predominantly heuristic, difficult to\ninterpret, and computationally demanding solutions. Here, we combine\nstatistical physics with control theory in a unified theoretical framework to\nidentify optimal protocols in prototypical neural network models. In the\nhigh-dimensional limit, we derive closed-form ordinary differential equations\nthat track online stochastic gradient descent through low-dimensional order\nparameters. We formulate the design of learning protocols as an optimal control\nproblem directly on the dynamics of the order parameters with the goal of\nminimizing the generalization error at the end of training. This framework\nencompasses a variety of learning scenarios, optimization constraints, and\ncontrol budgets. We apply it to representative cases, including optimal\ncurricula, adaptive dropout regularization and noise schedules in denoising\nautoencoders. We find nontrivial yet interpretable strategies highlighting how\noptimal protocols mediate crucial learning tradeoffs, such as maximizing\nalignment with informative input directions while minimizing noise fitting.\nFinally, we show how to apply our framework to real datasets. Our results\nestablish a principled foundation for understanding and designing optimal\nlearning protocols and suggest a path toward a theory of meta-learning grounded\nin statistical physics.",

Affective computing, in\nparticular, has focused on systems that recognize, interpret, and respond to\nhuman emotions, often using wearable devices, which provide continuous data\nstreams of physiological signals. Among various physiological signals, the\nphotoplethysmogram (PPG) has gained prominence due to its ease of acquisition\nfrom widely available devices.

These ices were irradiated with IR radiation from\nthe FELIX IR Free Electron Laser (FEL) FEL-2. In accordance with previous\nstudies, we confirm that direct excitation of CO is not an efficient pathway to\nCO desorption, indicating that another energy dissipation mechanism exists. We\ndemonstrate that vibrational excitation of the PHP CH stretching modes leads to\nefficient CO photodesorption.

Unlike previous implementations, our approach\nfirst splits each simulation particle into separate dark matter and baryonic\ncomponents, which are then displaced individually using the BFC technique. By\napplying the hydrostatic and ideal gas equations, we assign pressure and\ntemperature values to individual gas particles. The model is validated against\nhydrodynamical simulations from the FLAMINGO and TNG suites (which feature\nvaried feedback prescriptions) showing good agreement at the level of density\nand pressure profiles across a wide range of halo masses. As a further step, we\ncalibrate the BFC model parameters to gas and stellar mass ratio profiles from\nthe hydrodynamical simulations. Based on these calibrations, we baryonify\n$N$-body simulations and compare the resulting total matter power spectrum\nsuppressions to the ones from the same hydrodynamical simulation. Carrying out\nthis test of the BFC method at each redshift individually, we obtain a 2\npercent agreement up to $k=5\\,h$/Mpc across all tested feedback scenarios. We\nalso define a reduced, 2+1 parameter BFC model that simultaneously accounts for\nfeedback variations (2 parameters) and redshift evolution (1 parameter). The\n2+1 parameter model agrees with the hydrodynamical simulations to better than\n2.5 percent over the scales and redshifts relevant for cosmological surveys.\nFinally, we present a map-level comparison between a baryonified $N$-body\nsimulation and a full hydrodynamical run from the TNG simulation suite.

The induced evaluation is not necessarily\nmultiplicative, which allows to model functions with singularities and leads to\ngeneralized shuffle relations. In general, not every element of a differential\nring has an antiderivative in the same ring. Starting from a commutative\ndifferential ring and a direct decomposition into integrable and non-integrable\nelements, we construct the free integro-differential ring. This\nintegro-differential closure contains all nested integrals over elements of the\noriginal differential ring. We exhibit the relations satisfied by generalized\nevaluations of products of nested integrals. Investigating these relations of\nconstants, we characterize in terms of Lyndon words certain evaluations of\nproducts that determine all others. We also analyze the relation of the free\nintegro-differential ring with the shuffle algebra. To preserve integrals in\nthe original differential ring for computations in its integro-differential\nclosure, we introduce the notion of quasi-integro-differential rings and give\nan adapted construction of the free integro-differential ring.

Unlike structured pruning, UnIT embraces\nirregular sparsity and does not require retraining or hardware specialization.\nIt transforms pruning decisions into lightweight comparisons, replacing\nmultiplications with threshold checks and approximated divisions.

Participants were randomly assigned to a control or an\ninformation-seeking task, either a traditional online search or a CAI\n(Perplexity AI). Task avoidance (operationalized as survey abandonment or\nproviding unrelated responses during task assignment) was significantly higher\nin the CAI group (51%) compared to the search (30.9%) and control (16.8%)\ngroups, with the highest CAI avoidance among participants with lower education\nlevels (~74.4%). Structural equation modeling based on the theoretical\nframework UTAUT2 and LASSO regressions reveal that education is strongly\nassociated with CAI avoidance, even after accounting for various cognitive and\naffective predictors of technology adoption.

    "abstract": "How internal forces are transduced into motion through soft, fluid membranes\nremains a fundamental question in the study of active systems. To investigate\nthis coupling, we develop a minimal system consisting of a single ferromagnetic\nparticle encapsulated within a lipid vesicle with controlled membrane\ncomposition and phase behavior. An external rotating magnetic field actuates\nthe particle, which rotates and translates along the inner membrane leaflet.\nThis motion generates local slip in the membrane; near a substrate, the slip\ncreates a shear gradient across the lubrication gap that propels the vesicle\nforward. Propulsion is intermittent and strongest when the particle moves near\nthe vesicle bottom, where stress transmission is most effective. We find that\nthe coupling between internal flows and vesicle motion is highly sensitive to\nmembrane elasticity, excess area, and phase coexistence. Local membrane\ndeformation and flow dissipate part of the stress, limiting the efficiency of\nforce transduction. Additionally, membrane fluctuations and external boundaries\nreduce particle mobility, and in phase-separated membranes, line tension at\ndomain boundaries deflects the particle and gradually reorients membrane\nstructure. These results demonstrate that lipid membranes not only transmit\ninternal stresses but also remodel themselves in response, actively shaping the\ndynamics of force transduction and motion in active systems.",

They are a critical tool\nin applications ranging from marine ecology and aquaculture to underwater\nconstruction and archaeology. While existing pixel-domain diffusion-based image\nrestoration approaches are effective at restoring simple scenes with limited\ndepth variation, they are computationally intensive and often generate\nunrealistic artifacts when applied to scenes with complex geometry and\nsignificant depth variation. In this work we overcome these limitations by\ncombining a novel network architecture (SLURPP) with an accurate synthetic data\ngeneration pipeline. SLURPP combines pretrained latent diffusion models --\nwhich encode strong priors on the geometry and depth of scenes -- with an\nexplicit scene decomposition -- which allows one to model and account for the\neffects of light attenuation and backscattering. To train SLURPP we design a\nphysics-based underwater image synthesis pipeline that applies varied and\nrealistic underwater degradation effects to existing terrestrial image\ndatasets. This approach enables the generation of diverse training data with\ndense medium/degradation annotations. We evaluate our method extensively on\nboth synthetic and real-world benchmarks and demonstrate state-of-the-art\nperformance.

This\nadaptation leads to increased neuronal noise and tuning curve flattening in\nresponse to metabolic stress. We have developed a theoretical population coding\nframework that captures this behavior using two novel, surprisingly simple\nconstraints: an approximation of firing rate homeostasis and an energy limit\ntied to noise levels via biophysical simulation.

Each\nstate along this optimal path is associated with properties (resting potential\nand leak conductance) which can be measured in electrophysiology experiments\nand have been shown to change under prolonged caloric deprivation.

We prove a Game Theorem establishing existence and uniqueness of\nsemantic equilibria under realistic cognitive simulation assumptions. Our\nverification suite includes adaptations of Banach's fixed-point theorem to\ntransfinite contexts, a novel $\\phi$-topology based on the\nKozlov-Maz'ya-Rossmann formula for handling semantic singularities, and\ncategorical consistency tests via the Yoneda lemma. The paper itself functions\nas a semantic artifact designed to propagate its fixed-point patterns in AI\nembedding spaces -- a deliberate instantiation of the \"semantic virus\" concept\nit theorizes. All results are grounded in category theory, information theory,\nand realistic AI cognition models, ensuring practical applicability beyond pure\nmathematical abstraction.",

    "abstract": "Neural audio codecs and autoencoders have emerged as versatile models for\naudio compression, transmission, feature-extraction, and latent-space\ngeneration. However, a key limitation is that most are trained to maximize\nreconstruction fidelity, often neglecting the specific latent structure\nnecessary for optimal performance in diverse downstream applications. We\npropose a simple, post-hoc framework to address this by modifying the\nbottleneck of a pre-trained autoencoder. Our method introduces a\n\"Re-Bottleneck\", an inner bottleneck trained exclusively through latent space\nlosses to instill user-defined structure. We demonstrate the framework's\neffectiveness in three experiments. First, we enforce an ordering on latent\nchannels without sacrificing reconstruction quality. Second, we align latents\nwith semantic embeddings, analyzing the impact on downstream diffusion\nmodeling. Third, we introduce equivariance, ensuring that a filtering operation\non the input waveform directly corresponds to a specific transformation in the\nlatent space. Ultimately, our Re-Bottleneck framework offers a flexible and\nefficient way to tailor representations of neural audio models, enabling them\nto seamlessly meet the varied demands of different applications with minimal\nadditional training.",

    "abstract": "The identification of potential sources of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays\n(UHECRs) remains challenging due to magnetic deflections and propagation\nlosses, which are particularly strong for nuclei. In previous iterations of\nthis work, we proposed an approach for UHECR astronomy based on Bayesian\ninference through explicit modelling of propagation and magnetic deflection\neffects. The event-by-event mass information is expected to provide tighter\nconstraints on these parameters and to help identify unknown sources. However,\nthe measurements of the average mass through observations from the surface\ndetectors at the Pierre Auger Observatory already indicate that the UHECR\nmasses are well represented through its statistical average. In this\ncontribution, we present our framework which uses energy and mass moments of\n$\\ln A$ to infer the source parameters of UHECRs, including the mass\ncomposition at the source. We demonstrate the performance of our model using\nsimulated datasets based on the Pierre Auger Observatory and Telescope Array\nProject. Our model can be readily applied to currently available data, and we\ndiscuss the implications of our results for UHECR source identification.",

This goal is pursued by analyzing the plane-strain response of\ntwo-phase laminates. In the context of this problem, the effect of fiber\nplasticity is accounted for by allowing the elastically stiffer layers\n(``fiber'' phase) to also yield plastically and by taking the soft layers\n(``matrix'' phase) to be purely elastic solids. The analysis is carried out at\nfinite elastic and plastic strains, but it is restricted to unidirectional,\nnon-monotonic loading paths, applied by initially increasing the macroscopic\nstretch along the direction of the layers up to a prescribed maximum value and\nthen decreasing the same stretch down to a minimum value. A simple expression\nis derived for the critical conditions at which the homogenized behavior of the\nlaminate loses strong ellipticity for the first time along the loading path.\nThe relevance of this result stems from the fact that the loss of macroscopic\nellipticity of these composites is known to coincide with the onset of\nbifurcations of the long-wavelength type. It follows from this result that,\njust like hyperelastic laminates, elastoplastic laminates may lose macroscopic\nellipticity whenever their incremental strength in shear perpendicular to the\nlayers vanishes for the first time. For situations in which loss of macroscopic\nellipticity does take place, a corresponding post-bifurcation solution for the\nhomogenized behavior of the laminate is computed. The deformed state of the\nmaterial described by this solution is characterized by twin lamellar domains\nthat are formed at a length scale much larger than the width of the original,\nmicroscopic layers, but still much smaller than the overall dimensions of the\nmacroscopic specimen under consideration.",

In this context, the emergence of smart cities,\ncharacterised by dense and geographically distributed IoT networks, presents\nsignificant potential for such reuse. This work proposes HaLert, a resilient\narchitecture for smart cities based on a Wi-Fi HaLow IEEE 802.11s mesh network,\nwhose resources can be readily reallocated to support a emergency communication\nsystem to exchange messages (including text, location, image, audio, and video)\nbetween citizens, authorities, and between both parties. To facilitate remote\nmonitoring and configuration of the network, the architecture incorporates the\nSDN (Software-Defined Networking) paradigm, supported by a LoRa controlled\nflooding mesh network. A prototype was developed based on this architecture and\ntested in a real urban scenario comprising both indoor and outdoor\nenvironments. The results demonstrated that, despite the significant impact of\nobstacles, lack of line-of-sight, and terrain slopes on the latency (average\nlatency between 15 and 54.8 ms) and throughput (upload bitrates between 134 and\n726 Kbps and download bitrates between 117 and 682 Kbps) of the Wi-Fi HaLow\nnetwork, it remained stable and resilient, successfully providing all\nfunctionalities associated with the HaLert architecture. The tests conducted on\nthe LoRa network revealed a high average message success rate of 94.96%.",

We present measurements of eccentricities\nfor 1646 Kepler planets, 92% of which are smaller than Neptune. For all planet\nsizes, the eccentricity distribution peaks at e=0 and falls monotonically\ntoward zero at e=1. As planet size increases, mean population eccentricity\nrises from $\\langle e \\rangle = 0.05 \\pm 0.01$ for small planets to $\\langle e\n\\rangle = 0.20 \\pm 0.03$ for planets larger than $\\sim$ 3.5 Earth-radii.

We also\nfind size dependent associations between eccentricity, host star metallicity,\nand orbital period. While smaller planets generally have low eccentricities,\nthere are hints of a noteworthy exception: eccentricities are slightly elevated\nin the ``radius valley,'' a narrow band of low occurrence rate density which\nseparates rocky ``super-Earths'' (1.0-1.5 Earth-radii) from gas-rich\n``sub-Neptunes'' (2.0-3.0 Earth-radii.

    "abstract": "Accurate prediction of recurrence in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC)\nremains a major clinical challenge due to the disease complex molecular,\npathological, and clinical heterogeneity. Traditional prognostic models, which\nrely on single data modalities such as radiology, histopathology, or genomics,\noften fail to capture the full spectrum of disease complexity, resulting in\nsuboptimal predictive accuracy. This study aims to overcome these limitations\nby proposing a deep learning (DL) framework that integrates multimodal data,\nincluding CT, MRI, histopathology whole slide images (WSI), clinical data, and\ngenomic profiles, to improve the prediction of ccRCC recurrence and enhance\nclinical decision-making. The proposed framework utilizes a comprehensive\ndataset curated from multiple publicly available sources, including TCGA, TCIA,\nand CPTAC. To process the diverse modalities, domain-specific models are\nemployed: CLAM, a ResNet50-based model, is used for histopathology WSIs, while\nMeD-3D, a pre-trained 3D-ResNet18 model, processes CT and MRI images. For\nstructured clinical and genomic data, a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) is used.\nThese models are designed to extract deep feature embeddings from each\nmodality, which are then fused through an early and late integration\narchitecture. This fusion strategy enables the model to combine complementary\ninformation from multiple sources. Additionally, the framework is designed to\nhandle incomplete data, a common challenge in clinical settings, by enabling\ninference even when certain modalities are missing.",

To address\nthis, we introduce 3D-ADAM, the first large-scale industry-relevant dataset for\nhigh-precision 3D Anomaly Detection. 3D-ADAM comprises 14,120 high-resolution\nscans across 217 unique parts, captured using 4 industrial depth imaging\nsensors.

The proposed\nframework introduces the concept of modal reference spaces to overcome the\nchallenges of discovering low-dimensional subspaces from unstructured, dynamic,\nand mixing numerical topology that is often seen in SPH simulations. The\nproposed modal reference spaces enable a low-dimensional representation of the\nSPH field equations while maintaining their inherent meshless qualities. Modal\nreference spaces are constructed by projecting SPH snapshot data onto a\nreference space where low-dimensionality of field quantities can be discovered\nvia traditional modal decomposition techniques (e.g., the proper orthogonal\ndecomposition (POD)). Modal quantities are mapped back to the meshless SPH\nspace via scattered data interpolation during the online predictive stage. The\nproposed model-order reduction framework is cast into the \\emph{meshless}\nGalerkin POD (GPOD) and the Adjoint Petrov--Galerkin (APG) projection\nmodel-order reduction (PMOR) formulation. The PMORs are tested on three\nnumerical experiments: 1) the Taylor--Green vortex; 2) lid-driven cavity; and\n3) flow past an open cavity. Results show good agreement in reconstructed and\npredictive velocity fields, which showcase the ability of the proposed\nframework to evolve the unstructured, dynamic, and mixing SPH field equations\nin a low-dimensional subspace. Results also show that the pressure field is\nsensitive to the projection error due to the stiff weakly-compressible\nassumption made in the current SPH framework, but can be alleviated through\nnonlinear approximations, such as the APG approach. Ultimately, the presented\nmeshless model-order reduction framework marks a step toward enabling drastic\ncost savings of SPH simulations.",

A detailed theoretical investigation of the stability condition\nfor the ion acceleration is presented, highlighting more stringent limitations\nthan previously anticipated. Next, the impact of several physical parameters on\nthe accelerator design is analyzed. This study led to the design of a compact\ndemonstrator device able to accelerate He2+ ions up to 9.5 MeV per nucleon\ninside a 1.8 m long accelerating cavity.

In this work, we investigate structural and dynamical\nlengthscales in supercooled liquids using the Kob Andersen binary Lennard Jones\n(KALJ) model in two compositions: 80:20 and 60:40. We compute the dynamical\nlengthscale from displacement displacement correlation functions and observe a\nconsistent growth as temperature decreases. To explore the static counterpart,\nwe use a structural order parameter (SOP) based on the mean field caging\npotential. While this SOP is known to predict short time dynamics effectively,\nits bare correlation function reveals minimal spatial growth. Motivated by\nrecent findings that long time dynamics reflect collective rearrangements, we\nperform spatial coarse-graining of the SOP and identify an optimal lengthscale\n$L_{max}$ that maximises structure dynamics correlation. We show that the\nstructural correlation length derived from SOP coarse-grained over $L_{max}$\nexhibits clear growth with cooling and closely tracks the dynamical\nlengthscale, especially for A particles in the 80:20 mixture and for both A and\nB particles in the 60:40 system. Our results reconcile the previously observed\nabsence of static length growth in MRCO-free models like KALJ by highlighting\nthe necessity of intermediate range structural descriptors.

    "abstract": "The next generation neutrino telescope, IceCube-Gen2, will be sensitive to\nthe astrophysical and cosmogenic flux of neutrinos across a broad energy range,\nfrom the TeV to the EeV scale. The planned design includes 8 cubic kilometers\nof ice instrumented with approximately 10,000 optical sensors, a surface array,\nand a radio array of antennas embedded in the ice laid out sparsely over 500\nkm^2. The radio array provides sensitivity to ultra-high energy neutrinos using\nindependent radio stations that can trigger on Askaryan emission from neutrino\ninteractions in the ice. In this contribution, we present the design for the\nradio array along with its planned implementation, which is expected to\nincrease sensitivity to neutrinos with energies beyond 100PeV by at least an\norder of magnitude over existing arrays.

    "abstract": "Background: Accurate forecasting of lung tumor motion is essential for\nprecise dose delivery in proton therapy. While current markerless methods\nmostly rely on deep learning, transformer-based architectures remain unexplored\nin this domain, despite their proven performance in trajectory forecasting.\n  Purpose: This work introduces a markerless forecasting approach for lung\ntumor motion using Vision Transformers (ViT). Two training strategies are\nevaluated under clinically realistic constraints: a patient-specific (PS)\napproach that learns individualized motion patterns, and a multi-patient (MP)\nmodel designed for generalization. The comparison explicitly accounts for the\nlimited number of images that can be generated between planning and treatment\nsessions.\n  Methods: Digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) derived from planning\n4DCT scans of 31 patients were used to train the MP model; a 32nd patient was\nheld out for evaluation. PS models were trained using only the target patient's\nplanning data. Both models used 16 DRRs per input and predicted tumor motion\nover a 1-second horizon. Performance was assessed using Average Displacement\nError (ADE) and Final Displacement Error (FDE), on both planning (T1) and\ntreatment (T2) data.\n  Results: On T1 data, PS models outperformed MP models across all training set\nsizes, especially with larger datasets (up to 25,000 DRRs, p < 0.05). However,\nMP models demonstrated stronger robustness to inter-fractional anatomical\nvariability and achieved comparable performance on T2 data without retraining.\n  Conclusions: This is the first study to apply ViT architectures to markerless\ntumor motion forecasting. While PS models achieve higher precision, MP models\noffer robust out-of-the-box performance, well-suited for time-constrained\nclinical settings.",

However, to translate the optimal continuous\nrepresentation into a concrete requirement, such embeddings must be invertible.\nWe tackle this issue by training a Transformer-based decoder-only model to\ninvert semantic embeddings of Signal Temporal Logic (STL) formulae. STL is a\npowerful formalism that allows us to describe properties of signals varying\nover time in an expressive yet concise way. By constructing a small vocabulary\nfrom STL syntax, we demonstrate that our proposed model is able to generate\nvalid formulae after only 1 epoch and to generalize to the semantics of the\nlogic in about 10 epochs. Additionally, the model is able to decode a given\nembedding into formulae that are often simpler in terms of length and nesting\nwhile remaining semantically close (or equivalent) to gold references. We show\nthe effectiveness of our methodology across various levels of training formulae\ncomplexity to assess the impact of training data on the model's ability to\neffectively capture the semantic information contained in the embeddings and\ngeneralize out-of-distribution.

We propose SAMVAE (Survival Analysis Multimodal\nVariational Autoencoder), a novel deep learning architecture designed for\nsurvival prediction that integrates six data modalities: clinical variables,\nfour molecular profiles, and histopathological images.

    "abstract": "Recent observations of DESI hint that dark matter (DM) may not be cold but\nhave a non-zero equation of state (EoS) parameter, and that dark energy (DE)\nmay not be a cosmological constant. In this work, we explore the possibility of\na non-zero DM EoS parameter within the framework of dynamical DE. We perform\nanalysis by using the latest baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data from DESI\nDR2, the cosmic microwave background (CMB) data from Planck, and the type Ia\nsupernova (SN) data from DESY5 and PantheonPlus. When using the combination of\nCMB, BAO, and SN data, our results indicate a preference for a non-zero DM EoS\nparameter at the $2.8\\sigma$ and $3.3\\sigma$ level within the content of a\nconstant DE EoS. In contrast, for a time-evolving DE EoS parameterized by $w_0$\nand $w_a$, this preference decreases to $0.8\\sigma$ and $1.1\\sigma$.\nFurthermore, allowing a non-zero DM EoS yields best-fit values of $w_0$ and\n$w_a$ that exhibit smaller deviations from the $\\Lambda$CDM expectations, and\nBayesian evidence analysis shows a comparable preference for this model\nrelative to $\\Lambda$CDM. The overall results of this work indicate that a\nnon-zero DM EoS parameter warrants further exploration and investigation.",

Instead,\nViaPT overcomes these limitations by balancing dataset-level and instance-level\nknowledge, while reducing the amount of learnable parameters compared to\nVPT-Deep.

    "abstract": "Hyperuniformity, where the static structure factor obeys $S(q)\\sim\nq^{\\varsigma}$ with $\\varsigma> 0$, emerges at criticality in systems having\nmultiple, symmetry-unrelated, absorbing states. Important examples arise in\nperiodically sheared suspensions and amorphous solids; these lie in the random\norganisation (RO) universality class, for which analytic results for\n$\\varsigma$ are lacking. Here, using Doi-Peliti field theory and perturbative\nRG about a Gaussian model, we find $\\varsigma = 0^+$ and $\\varsigma=\n2\\epsilon/9 + O(\\epsilon^2)$ in dimension $d>d_c=4$ and $d=4-\\epsilon$\nrespectively. Our calculations assume that renormalizability is sustained via a\ncertain pattern of cancellation of strongly divergent terms. These\ncancellations allow the upper critical dimension to remain $d_c = 4$, as is\nknown for RO, while generic perturbations (e.g., those violating particle\nconservation) would typically flow to a fixed point with $d_c=6$. The assumed\ncancellation pattern is closely reminiscent of a long-established one near the\ntricritical Ising fixed point. (This has $d_c=3$, although generic\nperturbations flow towards the Wilson-Fisher fixed point with $d_c = 4$.) We\nshow how hyperuniformity in RO emerges from anticorrelation of strongly\nfluctuating active and passive densities. Our calculations also yield the\nremaining exponents to order $\\epsilon$, surprisingly without recourse to\nfunctional RG. These exponents coincide as expected with the Conserved Directed\nPercolation (C-DP) class which also contains the Manna Model and the quenched\nEdwards-Wilkinson (q-EW) model. Importantly however, our $\\varsigma$ differs\nfrom one found via a mapping to q-EW. That mapping neglects a conserved noise\nin the RO action, which we argue to be dangerously irrelevant. Thus, although\nother exponents are common to both, the RO and C-DP universality classes have\ndifferent exponents for hyperuniformity.",

    "abstract": "Many model order reduction (MOR) methods rely on the computation of an\northonormal basis of a subspace onto which the large full order model is\nprojected. Numerically, this entails the orthogonalization of a set of vectors.\nThe nature of the MOR process imposes several requirements for the\northogonalization process. Firstly, MOR is oftentimes performed in an adaptive\nor iterative manner, where the quality of the reduced order model, i.e., the\ndimension of the reduced subspace, is decided on the fly. Therefore, it is\nimportant that the orthogonalization routine can be executed iteratively.\nSecondly, one possibly has to deal with high-dimensional arrays of abstract\nvectors that do not allow explicit access to entries, making it difficult to\nemploy so-called `orthogonal triangularization algorithms' such as Householder\nQR.\n  For these reasons, (modified) Gram-Schmidt-type algorithms are commonly used\nin MOR applications. These methods belong to the category of `triangular\northogonalization' algorithms that do not rely on elementwise access to the\nvectors and can be easily updated. Recently, algorithms like shifted Cholesky\nQR have gained attention. These also belong to the aforementioned category and\nhave proven their aptitude for MOR algorithms in previous studies. A key\nbenefit of these methods is that they are communication-avoiding, leading to\nvastly superior performance on memory-bandwidth-limited problems and parallel\nor distributed architectures. This work formulates an efficient updating scheme\nfor Cholesky QR algorithms and proposes an improved shifting strategy for\nhighly ill-conditioned matrices.\n  The proposed algorithmic extensions are validated with numerical experiments\non a laptop and computation server.",

Although comprehensive\natomic data, including atomic opacities, is now available for many elements,\nwavelength-calibrated data remains limited to a select few ions. To examine the\natomic opacities of all singly and doubly ionized lanthanides, from La (Z = 57)\nto Yb (Z = 70), we perform atomic structure calculations using the FAC code.\nOur calculations incorporate an innovative optimization of the local central\npotential and the number of configurations considered, alongside a calibration\ntechnique aimed at enhancing agreement between theoretical and experimental\natomic energy levels. We assess the accuracy of the computed data, including\nenergy levels and electric dipole (E1) transition strengths, as well as their\nimpact on KN opacities. We find that strong transitions ($\\log(gf)>-1$) are in\ngood agreement with both experiments and semi-empirical calculations. For ions\nwith substantial experimental data, the computed opacities exhibit good\nagreement with prior calculations. By calibrating low-lying energy levels with\nexperimental data, we have identified 66,591 transitions with experimentally\ncalibrated wavelength information, rendering future lanthanide line\nidentifications through radiative transfer modeling feasible. In total, our\ncalculations encompass 28 ions, yielding 146,856 energy levels below the\nionization threshold and 28,690,443 transitions among these levels.",

Since program synthesis is essentially a combinatorial search, the\ncommunity has sought to leverage powerful combinatorial constraint solvers.\nHere, constraints are used to express the program semantics, but not as a\npotentially potent tool to remove unwanted programs. Recent inductive logic\nprogramming approaches introduce constraints on the program's syntax to be\nsynthesized. These syntactic constraints allow for checking and propagating a\nconstraint without executing the program, and thus for arbitrary operators. In\nthis work, we leverage syntactic constraints to model program spaces, defining\nnot just solutions that are feasible, but also ones that are likely useful. To\ndemonstrate this idea, we introduce BART, a solver that efficiently propagates\nand solves these constraints.

With a 2.4 hour period, it is known to be variable in\nboth the infrared and the radio, which has been attributed to changes in the\ncloud coverage and the presence of an aurora respectively. To quantify the\nchanges in the atmospheric state that drive this variability, we obtained\ntime-series spectra of SIMP-0136 covering one full rotation with both\nNIRSpec/PRISM and the MIRI/LRS on board JWST. We performed a series of\ntime-resolved atmospheric retrievals using petitRADTRANS in order to measure\nchanges in the temperature structure, chemistry, and cloudiness. We inferred\nthe presence of a ~250 K thermal inversion above 10 mbar of SIMP-0136 at all\nphases, and propose that this inversion is due to the deposition of energy into\nthe upper atmosphere by an aurora. Statistical tests were performed in order to\ndetermine which parameters drive the observed spectroscopic variability. The\nprimary contribution was due to changes in the temperature profile at pressures\ndeeper than 10 mbar, which resulted in variation of the effective temperature\nfrom 1243 K to 1248 K. This changing effective temperature was also correlated\nto observed changes in the abundances of CO2 and H2S, while all other chemical\nspecies were consistent with being homogeneous throughout the atmosphere.\nPatchy silicate clouds were required to fit the observed spectra, but the cloud\nproperties were not found to systematically vary with longitude.

    "abstract": "To alleviate the annotation burden in supervised learning, N-tuples learning\nhas recently emerged as a powerful weakly-supervised method. While existing\nN-tuples learning approaches extend pairwise learning to higher-order\ncomparisons and accommodate various real-world scenarios, they often rely on\ntask-specific designs and lack a unified theoretical foundation. In this paper,\nwe propose a general N-tuples learning framework based on empirical risk\nminimization, which systematically integrates pointwise unlabeled data to\nenhance learning performance. This paper first unifies the data generation\nprocesses of N-tuples and pointwise unlabeled data under a shared probabilistic\nformulation. Based on this unified view, we derive an unbiased empirical risk\nestimator that generalizes a broad class of existing N-tuples models. We\nfurther establish a generalization error bound for theoretical support. To\ndemonstrate the flexibility of the framework, we instantiate it in four\nrepresentative weakly supervised scenarios, each recoverable as a special case\nof our general model. Additionally, to address overfitting issues arising from\nnegative risk terms, we adopt correction functions to adjust the empirical\nrisk. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of\nthe proposed framework and demonstrate that leveraging pointwise unlabeled data\nconsistently improves generalization across various N-tuples learning tasks.",

The paper then applies this approach\nto US voter survey data between 2004 and 2020, showing how polarization between\nright-of-center voters and the rest of the electorate was increasing gradually,\nwhile polarization between left-wingers and the rest was originally constant\nand then rose steeply. It also shows how, following elections, polarization\naround left-wing positions decreased while polarization around right-wing\npositions increased. Furthermore, the paper shows how this measure can be used\nto find cleavage points around which polarization changed the most.

This results in adversarial unfairness: classes with well\ndistinguishable features (strong classes) tend to become more robust, while\nclasses with overlapping or shared features(weak classes) remain\ndisproportionately susceptible to adversarial attacks. We observe that strong\nclasses do not require strong adversaries during training, as their non-robust\nfeatures are quickly suppressed. In contrast, weak classes benefit from\nstronger adversaries to effectively reduce their vulnerabilities. Motivated by\nthis, we introduce TRIX, a feature-aware adversarial training framework that\nadaptively assigns weaker targeted adversaries to strong classes, promoting\nfeature diversity via uniformly sampled targets, and stronger untargeted\nadversaries to weak classes, enhancing their focused robustness. TRIX further\nincorporates per-class loss weighting and perturbation strength adjustments,\nbuilding on prior work, to emphasize weak classes during the optimization.\nComprehensive experiments on standard image classification benchmarks,\nincluding evaluations under strong attacks such as PGD and AutoAttack,\ndemonstrate that TRIX significantly improves worst-case class accuracy on both\nclean and adversarial data, reducing inter-class robustness disparities, and\npreserves overall accuracy.

    "abstract": "Quality control in additive manufacturing (AM) is vital for industrial\napplications in areas such as the automotive, medical and aerospace sectors.\nGeometric inaccuracies caused by shrinkage and deformations can compromise the\nlife and performance of additively manufactured components. Such deviations can\nbe quantified using Digital Volume Correlation (DVC), which compares the\ncomputer-aided design (CAD) model with the X-ray Computed Tomography (XCT)\ngeometry of the components produced. However, accurate registration between the\ntwo modalities is challenging due to the absence of a ground truth or reference\ndeformation field. In addition, the extremely large data size of\nhigh-resolution XCT volumes makes computation difficult. In this work, we\npresent a deep learning-based approach for estimating voxel-wise deformations\nbetween CAD and XCT volumes. Our method uses a dynamic patch-based processing\nstrategy to handle high-resolution volumes. In addition to the Dice Score, we\nintroduce a Binary Difference Map (BDM) that quantifies voxel-wise mismatches\nbetween binarized CAD and XCT volumes to evaluate the accuracy of the\nregistration. Our approach shows a 9.2\\% improvement in the Dice Score and a\n9.9\\% improvement in the voxel match rate compared to classic DVC methods,\nwhile reducing the interaction time from days to minutes. This work sets the\nfoundation for deep learning-based DVC methods to generate compensation meshes\nthat can then be used in closed-loop correlations during the AM production\nprocess. Such a system would be of great interest to industries since the\nmanufacturing process will become more reliable and efficient, saving time and\nmaterial.",

We empirically confirm the widespread shallowness by reverting the\nforgetting effect of various unlearning methods via training-free performance\nrecovery attack and gradient-inversion-based data reconstruction attack.

To\naddress these challenges, we propose ``IRAF-SLAM'', an Illumination-Robust and\nAdaptive Feature-Culling front-end designed to enhance vSLAM resilience in\ncomplex and challenging environments. Our approach introduces: (1) an image\nenhancement scheme to preprocess and adjust image quality under varying\nlighting conditions; (2) an adaptive feature extraction mechanism that\ndynamically adjusts detection sensitivity based on image entropy, pixel\nintensity, and gradient analysis; and (3) a feature culling strategy that\nfilters out unreliable feature points using density distribution analysis and a\nlighting impact factor. Comprehensive evaluations on the TUM-VI and European\nRobotics Challenge (EuRoC) datasets demonstrate that IRAF-SLAM significantly\nreduces tracking failures and achieves superior trajectory accuracy compared to\nstate-of-the-art vSLAM methods under adverse illumination conditions.

    "abstract": "The first violins appeared in late 16th-century Italy. Over the next 200\nyears, they spread across Europe and luthiers of various royal courts, eager to\nexperiment with new techniques, created a highly diverse family of instruments.\nAround 1750, size standards were introduced to unify violin making for\norchestras and conservatories. Instruments that fell between two standards were\nthen reduced to a smaller size by luthiers. These reductions have an impact on\nseveral characteristics of violins, in particular on the contour lines, i.e.\nlines of constant altitude, which look more like a U for non reduced\ninstruments and a V for reduced ones. While such differences are observed by\nexperts, they have not been studied quantitatively.\n  This paper presents a method for classifying violins as reduced or\nnon-reduced based on their contour lines. We study a corpus of 25 instruments\nwhose 3D geometric meshes were acquired via photogrammetry. For each\ninstrument, we extract 10-20 contour lines regularly spaced every millimetre.\nEach line is fitted with a parabola-like curve (with an equation of the type y\n= alpha*abs(x)**beta) depending on two parameters, describing how open (beta)\nand how vertically stretched (alpha) the curve is. We compute additional\nfeatures from those parameters, using regressions and counting how many values\nfall under some threshold. We also deal with outliers and non equal numbers of\nlevels, and eventually obtain a numerical profile for each instrument.\n  We then apply classification methods to assess whether geometry alone can\npredict size reduction. We find that distinguishing between reduced and non\nreduced instruments is feasible to some degree, taking into account that a\nwhole spectrum of more or less transformed violins exists, for which it is more\ndifficult to quantify the reduction.

Here we present a measurement of the\nstellar obliquity of TOI-1259Ab, a gas giant in a close-in orbit around a K\nstar with a white dwarf companion about 1650 au away.

These two effects\ntogether boost the merger probability by a factor of $\\sim$5, from 4\\% to as\nhigh as 20\\%. Among the two effects, our analysis suggests that the increase in\nencounter frequency plays a slightly more significant role in driving the\nenhancement. Moreover, this enhancement becomes more significant at larger\nradial distances from the central SMBH, since the total gas mass enclosed\nwithin the Hill sphere of the triple system increases with radius. Finally, the\nBSI process in AGN disks can naturally produce double GW merger events within a\ntimescale of $\\sim$year, which may serve as potential observational signatures\nof BSI occurring in AGN disk environments.",

At\neach stop, where the platform maintains a fixed pose and the motors keep the\ncables under tension, the system must evaluate whether it is safe to proceed by\ndetecting anomalies that could compromise performance (e.g., wind gusts or\ncable impacts). This paper investigates whether anomalies can be detected using\nonly motor torque data, without additional sensors. It introduces an adaptive,\nunsupervised outlier detection algorithm based on Gaussian Mixture Models\n(GMMs) to identify anomalies from torque signals. The method starts with a\nbrief calibration period, just a few seconds, during which a GMM is fit on\nknown anomaly-free data. Real-time torque measurements are then evaluated using\nMahalanobis distance from the GMM, with statistically derived thresholds\ntriggering anomaly flags. Model parameters are periodically updated using the\nlatest segments identified as anomaly-free to adapt to changing conditions.\nValidation includes 14 long-duration test sessions simulating varied wind\nintensities. The proposed method achieves a 100% true positive rate and 95.4%\naverage true negative rate, with 1-second detection latency. Comparative\nevaluation against power threshold and non-adaptive GMM methods indicates\nhigher robustness to drift and environmental variation.",

To address this issue, we propose a class wise balancing\ndata replay method for FCIL (FedCBDR), which employs a global coordination\nmechanism for class-level memory construction and reweights the learning\nobjective to alleviate the aforementioned imbalances. Specifically, FedCBDR has\ntwo key components: 1) the global-perspective data replay module reconstructs\nglobal representations of prior task in a privacy-preserving manner, which then\nguides a class-aware and importance-sensitive sampling strategy to achieve\nbalanced replay; 2) Subsequently, to handle class imbalance across tasks, the\ntask aware temperature scaling module adaptively adjusts the temperature of\nlogits at both class and instance levels based on task dynamics, which reduces\nthe model's overconfidence in majority classes while enhancing its sensitivity\nto minority classes. Experimental results verified that FedCBDR achieves\nbalanced class-wise sampling under heterogeneous data distributions and\nimproves generalization under task imbalance between earlier and recent tasks,\nyielding a 2%-15% Top-1 accuracy improvement over six state-of-the-art methods.",

    "abstract": "The subsurface meridional flow has long been recognized as a critical factor\nin driving the solar cycle. Specifically, the equatorward return flow in the\ntachocline is widely believed to be responsible for the formation of the\nsunspot butterfly diagram and determine the solar cycle period within the\nframework of flux transport dynamo (FTD) models. We aim to investigate whether\nthe subsurface meridional flow also plays a significant role in the recently\ndeveloped distributed-shear Babcock-Leighton (BL) dynamo model, which operates\nwithin the convection zone, rather than the tachocline. Various meridional flow\nconfigurations, including a deep single cell, a shallow single cell, and double\ncells, are applied in the distributed-shear BL dynamo model to explore the\nmechanisms driving the butterfly diagram and variations in the cycle period.\nSubsurface meridional flow plays a minimal role in the distributed-shear BL\ndynamo. A solar-like butterfly diagram can be generated even with a double-cell\nmeridional flow. The diagram arises from the time- and latitude-dependent\nregeneration of the toroidal field, governed by latitude-dependent latitudinal\ndifferential rotation and the evolution of surface magnetic fields. The cycle\nperiod is determined by the surface flux source and transport process\nresponsible for polar field generation, which corresponds to the\n$\\alpha$-effect in the BL-type dynamo. The cycle period may exhibit varying\ndependence on the amplitude of the subsurface flow. The distributed-shear BL\ndynamo differs fundamentally from the FTD models, as it does not rely on the\nsubsurface flux transport. This distinction aligns the distributed-shear BL\ndynamo more closely with the original BL dynamo and the conventional\n$\\alpha\\Omega$ dynamo. Although the subsurface meridional flow plays a\nnegligible role in our distributed-shear BL dynamo, the poleward surface flow\nis essential.",

    "abstract": "Text embeddings are fundamental to many natural language processing (NLP)\ntasks, extensively applied in domains such as recommendation systems and\ninformation retrieval (IR). Traditionally, transmitting embeddings instead of\nraw text has been seen as privacy-preserving. However, recent methods such as\nVec2Text challenge this assumption by demonstrating that controlled decoding\ncan successfully reconstruct original texts from black-box embeddings. The\nunexpectedly strong results reported by Vec2Text motivated us to conduct\nfurther verification, particularly considering the typically non-intuitive and\nopaque structure of high-dimensional embedding spaces. In this work, we\nreproduce the Vec2Text framework and evaluate it from two perspectives: (1)\nvalidating the original claims, and (2) extending the study through targeted\nexperiments. First, we successfully replicate the original key results in both\nin-domain and out-of-domain settings, with only minor discrepancies arising due\nto missing artifacts, such as model checkpoints and dataset splits.\nFurthermore, we extend the study by conducting a parameter sensitivity\nanalysis, evaluating the feasibility of reconstructing sensitive inputs (e.g.,\npasswords), and exploring embedding quantization as a lightweight privacy\ndefense. Our results show that Vec2Text is effective under ideal conditions,\ncapable of reconstructing even password-like sequences that lack clear\nsemantics. However, we identify key limitations, including its sensitivity to\ninput sequence length. We also find that Gaussian noise and quantization\ntechniques can mitigate the privacy risks posed by Vec2Text, with quantization\noffering a simpler and more widely applicable solution. Our findings emphasize\nthe need for caution in using text embeddings and highlight the importance of\nfurther research into robust defense mechanisms for NLP systems.",

Although many\nfine-tuning techniques have been developed to reduce the time and computational\ncost involved, the challenge persists as LLMs continue to grow in size and\ncomplexity. To address this, a new approach to knowledge expansion in LLMs is\nneeded. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers one such alternative by\nstoring external knowledge in a database and retrieving relevant chunks to\nsupport question answering. However, naive implementations of RAG face\nsignificant limitations in scalability and answer accuracy. This paper\nintroduces KeyKnowledgeRAG (K2RAG), a novel framework designed to overcome\nthese limitations. Inspired by the divide-and-conquer paradigm, K2RAG\nintegrates dense and sparse vector search, knowledge graphs, and text\nsummarization to improve retrieval quality and system efficiency. The framework\nalso includes a preprocessing step that summarizes the training data,\nsignificantly reducing the training time. K2RAG was evaluated using the\nMultiHopRAG dataset, where the proposed pipeline was trained on the document\ncorpus and tested on a separate evaluation set. Results demonstrated notable\nimprovements over common naive RAG implementations. K2RAG achieved the highest\nmean answer similarity score of 0.57, and reached the highest third quartile\n(Q3) similarity of 0.82, indicating better alignment with ground-truth answers.\nIn addition to improved accuracy, the framework proved highly efficient. The\nsummarization step reduced the average training time of individual components\nby 93%, and execution speed was up to 40% faster than traditional knowledge\ngraph-based RAG systems.

    "abstract": "The dynamics of higher-order topological signals are increasingly recognized\nas a key aspect of the activity of complex systems. A paradigmatic example are\nsynaptic dynamics: synaptic efficacy changes over time driven by different\nmechanisms. Beyond traditional node-driven short-term plasticity mechanisms,\nthe role of astrocyte modulation through higher-order interactions, in the\nso-called tripartite synapse, is increasingly recognized. However, the\ncompetition and interplay between node-driven and higher-order mechanisms have\nyet to be considered. Here, we introduce a simple higher-order model of the\ntripartite synapse accounting for astrocyte-synapse-neuron interactions in\nshort-term plasticity. In the model, astrocyte gliotransmission and\npre-synaptic intrinsic facilitation mechanisms jointly modulate the probability\nof neurotransmitter release at the synapse, generalizing previous short-term\nplasticity models. We investigate the implications of such mechanisms in a\nminimal recurrent motif -- a directed ring of three excitatory leaky\nintegrate-and-fire neurons -- where one neuron receives external stimulation\nthat propagates through the circuit. Due to its strong recurrence, the circuit\nis highly prone to self-sustained activity, which can make it insensitive to\nexternal input. By introducing higher-order interactions among different\nsynapses through astrocyte modulation, we show that higher-order modulation\nrobustly stabilizes circuit dynamics and expands the parameter space that\nsupports stimulus-driven activity. Our findings highlight a plausible mechanism\nby which astrocytes can reshape effective connectivity and enhance information\nprocessing through higher-order structural interactions -- even in the simplest\nrecurrent circuits.",

This framework facilitates in obtaining quantum mechanical wave\nequation governing the radial and angular modes of the string. A central result\nof our analysis is the emergence of a trapping radius in the exterior region of\nthe black hole. Near this radius, the radial motion of the string is governed\nby an effective potential that supports small, quantized oscillations, akin to\na quantum harmonic oscillator. This behavior indicates a localization of the\nstring at the trapping surface, where it becomes dynamically confined. The\nangular sector of the wave function is found to be governed by the confluent\nHeun equation, yielding confluent Heun functions as the angular part of the\nwave function. The emergence of a trapping surface is analogous to the\nstretched horizon proposed by Susskind in the context of black hole\ncomplementarity. The quantized harmonic oscillation of the string at the\ntrapping radius complements with the Planck's black body whence the string can\nemit black-body radiation.

Our results show that the\nperformance of a large quantum reservoir does not improve monotonously with the\nnumber of bosonic modes, instead following a complex dependence driven by the\ninterplay of nonlinearity, reservoir size, and the average occupation of the\ninput mode.

    "abstract": "Modern edge-cloud systems face challenges in efficiently scaling resources to\nhandle dynamic and unpredictable workloads. Traditional scaling approaches\ntypically rely on static thresholds and predefined rules, which are often\ninadequate for optimizing resource utilization and maintaining performance in\ndistributed and dynamic environments. This inefficiency hinders the\nadaptability and performance required in edge-cloud infrastructures, which can\nonly be achieved through the newly proposed in-place scaling. To address this\nproblem, we propose the Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning-based In-place\nScaling Engine (MARLISE) that enables seamless, dynamic, reactive control with\nin-place resource scaling. We develop our solution using two Deep Reinforcement\nLearning algorithms: Deep Q-Network (DQN), and Proximal Policy Optimization\n(PPO). We analyze each version of the proposed MARLISE solution using dynamic\nworkloads, demonstrating their ability to ensure low response times of\nmicroservices and scalability. Our results show that MARLISE-based approaches\noutperform heuristic method in managing resource elasticity while maintaining\nmicroservice response times and achieving higher resource efficiency.",

    "abstract": "In pediatric orthodontics, accurate estimation of growth potential is\nessential for developing effective treatment strategies. Our research aims to\npredict this potential by identifying the growth peak and analyzing cervical\nvertebra morphology solely through lateral cephalometric radiographs. We\naccomplish this by comprehensively analyzing cervical vertebral maturation\n(CVM) features from these radiographs. This methodology provides clinicians\nwith a reliable and efficient tool to determine the optimal timings for\northodontic interventions, ultimately enhancing patient outcomes. A crucial\naspect of this approach is the meticulous annotation of keypoints on the\ncervical vertebrae, a task often challenged by its labor-intensive nature. To\nmitigate this, we introduce Attend-and-Refine Network (ARNet), a\nuser-interactive, deep learning-based model designed to streamline the\nannotation process. ARNet features Interaction-guided recalibration network,\nwhich adaptively recalibrates image features in response to user feedback,\ncoupled with a morphology-aware loss function that preserves the structural\nconsistency of keypoints. This novel approach substantially reduces manual\neffort in keypoint identification, thereby enhancing the efficiency and\naccuracy of the process. Extensively validated across various datasets, ARNet\ndemonstrates remarkable performance and exhibits wide-ranging applicability in\nmedical imaging. In conclusion, our research offers an effective AI-assisted\ndiagnostic tool for assessing growth potential in pediatric orthodontics,\nmarking a significant advancement in the field.",

In particular, the identification of new\nhadronic states is difficult, as exotic signals near threshold can arise from a\nvariety of physical mechanisms. A key diagnostic in this context is the pole\nstructure of the scattering amplitude, but different configurations can produce\nsimilar signatures. The mapping between pole configurations and line shapes is\nespecially ambiguous near the mass threshold, where analytic control is\nlimited. In this work, we introduce an uncertainty-aware machine learning\napproach for classifying pole structures in $S$-matrix elements. Our method is\nbased on an ensemble of classifier chains that provide both epistemic and\naleatoric uncertainty estimates. We apply a rejection criterion based on\npredictive uncertainty, achieving a validation accuracy of nearly $95\\%$ while\ndiscarding only a small fraction of high-uncertainty predictions. Trained on\nsynthetic data with known pole structures, the model generalizes to previously\nunseen experimental data, including enhancements associated with the\n$P_{c\\bar{c}}(4312)^+$ state observed by LHCb. In this, we infer a four-pole\nstructure, representing the presence of a genuine compact pentaquark in the\npresence of a higher channel virtual state pole with non-vanishing width. While\nevaluated on this particular state, our framework is broadly applicable to\nother candidate hadronic states and offers a scalable tool for pole structure\ninference in scattering amplitudes.",

This approach\nemploys energy estimation; however, other relevant molecular properties can be\nextracted from the one-particle reduced density matrix (1-RDM) generated by\nVQE. The accuracy of these properties strongly depends on the reliability and\nconvergence of the 1-RDM, which is not guaranteed by energy-only optimization.\nThus, we investigate the effect of optimizing the 1-RDM within VQE to improve\nthe accuracy of both the energy and molecular properties. A two-step algorithm\nwas implemented that optimizes the energy and 1-RDM by incorporating a penalty\nterm in the cost function to enforce the convergence of the 1-RDM. The first\nstep focuses on energy minimization, while in the second step, a weighted\npenalty is added to the cost function to promote simultaneous improvement of\nthe energy and 1-RDM. This approach was tested and validated for the k-UpCCGSD\nand GateFabric ans\\\"atzes with active spaces (4,4) and (2,2), respectively.\nk-UpCCGSD produces energies close to CISD, so optimizing 1-RDM has little\neffect on the energy but significantly improves electronic properties such as\nelectron density, dipole moments, and atomic charges. GateFabric initially\nshows higher energy deviations from CISD, but optimizing 1-RDM substantially\nimproves both the energy accuracy and the quality of 1-RDM. These results\ndemonstrate that simultaneous optimization of energy and 1-RDM is an effective\nstrategy to improve the accuracy of energies and molecular properties in\nvariational quantum algorithms.",

We\nsystematically study the dependence of $T_c$ on electron-phonon coupling\nstrength and on-site interaction in the bond bipolaron model.

Models have been\nproposed to explain the periodicity using dynamical phenomena such as rotation,\nprecession or orbital motion. Polarization Position Angle (PA) of the bursts\ncan be used to distinguish and constraint the origin of the long term\nperiodicity of the FRB. We aim to study the PA variability on short (within an\nobservation) and long timescales (from observation to observation). We aim to\ncompare the observed PA variability with the predictions of various dynamical\nprogenitor models for the FRB. We use the calibrated burst dataset detected by\nuGMRT in Band 4 (650 MHz) which have been published in arXiv:2409.12584 . We\ntransform the PA measured at 650 MHz to infinite frequency such that PAs\nmeasured in different observations are consistent, and finally measure the\nchanges within and across active windows. We find that PA of the bursts vary\naccording to the periodicity of the source. We constrain the PA variability to\nbe within seven degrees on timescales less than four hours for all MJDs. In\naddition, we also tentatively note the PA measured at the same phase in the\nactive window varies from one cycle to another. Using the findings, we\nconstrain rotational, precession and binary progenitor models. Rotational model\npartially agrees with observed PA variability but requires further study to\nfully constrain. We robustly rule out all flavors of precessional models where\neither precession explains the periodicity of the FRB or the variability from\none cycle to another.

In the second step, we perform a\nsingle Gauss-Newton iteration using the preliminary consistent estimator as the\ninitial value, achieving the same asymptotic properties as the ML estimator.\nFinally, simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of the\nproposed two-step estimator for large sample sizes.",

    "abstract": "Phonetic Cloaking Replacement (PCR), defined as the deliberate use of\nhomophonic or near-homophonic variants to hide toxic intent, has become a major\nobstacle to Chinese content moderation. While this problem is well-recognized,\nexisting evaluations predominantly rely on rule-based, synthetic perturbations\nthat ignore the creativity of real users. We organize PCR into a four-way\nsurface-form taxonomy and compile \\ours, a dataset of 500 naturally occurring,\nphonetically cloaked offensive posts gathered from the RedNote platform.\nBenchmarking state-of-the-art LLMs on this dataset exposes a serious weakness:\nthe best model reaches only an F1-score of 0.672, and zero-shot\nchain-of-thought prompting pushes performance even lower. Guided by error\nanalysis, we revisit a Pinyin-based prompting strategy that earlier studies\njudged ineffective and show that it recovers much of the lost accuracy. This\nstudy offers the first comprehensive taxonomy of Chinese PCR, a realistic\nbenchmark that reveals current detectors' limits, and a lightweight mitigation\ntechnique that advances research on robust toxicity detection.",

Liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) are exciting PSA candidates as\nthey can impart both anisotropy and temperature-dependence to adhesion, but the\nfull potential of their anisotropic adhesion is unexplored. Here, identical\nside-chain LCEs, produced as transparent isotropic or nematic films are\ninvestigated; the latter aligned in homeotropic or planar geometries. Their\nroom-temperature adhesion, determined through a 90-degree peel test, is\nconsistent with theoretical predictions and strongest in a planar geometry\n(peeled parallel to the director) with adhesive force per unit length of 0.67\nNmm-1. In contrast, adhesion of the planar perpendicular, isotropic and\nhomeotropic films is 62.5%, 38.5% and 23.0% lower, respectively. The surface\ncontribution to adhesion is identical for all films, confirming that the\nvariation in adhesion is determined solely by the bulk LCE alignment controlled\nduring film preparation. A temperature-dependent adhesion factor is determined\nfrom 0 Celsius to 80 Celsius using dynamic mechanical analysis, and found to be\nin excellent agreement with the peel data at room temperature. Molecular\nrelaxations active above the glass transition temperature are dominant in\ndetermining LCE adhesion.

    "abstract": "Facial Expression Recognition (FER) systems based on deep learning have\nachieved impressive performance in recent years. However, these models often\nexhibit demographic biases, particularly with respect to age, which can\ncompromise their fairness and reliability. In this work, we present a\ncomprehensive study of age-related bias in deep FER models, with a particular\nfocus on the elderly population. We first investigate whether recognition\nperformance varies across age groups, which expressions are most affected, and\nwhether model attention differs depending on age. Using Explainable AI (XAI)\ntechniques, we identify systematic disparities in expression recognition and\nattention patterns, especially for \"neutral\", \"sadness\", and \"anger\" in elderly\nindividuals. Based on these findings, we propose and evaluate three bias\nmitigation strategies: Multi-task Learning, Multi-modal Input, and Age-weighted\nLoss. Our models are trained on a large-scale dataset, AffectNet, with\nautomatically estimated age labels and validated on balanced benchmark datasets\nthat include underrepresented age groups. Results show consistent improvements\nin recognition accuracy for elderly individuals, particularly for the most\nerror-prone expressions. Saliency heatmap analysis reveals that models trained\nwith age-aware strategies attend to more relevant facial regions for each age\ngroup, helping to explain the observed improvements. These findings suggest\nthat age-related bias in FER can be effectively mitigated using simple training\nmodifications, and that even approximate demographic labels can be valuable for\npromoting fairness in large-scale affective computing systems.",

Critical phenomena give a natural route\nfrom smooth initial data to arbitrarily large curvatures visible from infinity,\nand are therefore likely to be relevant for cosmic censorship, quantum gravity,\nastrophysics, and our general understanding of the dynamics of general\nrelativity.

    "abstract": "We consider the problem of answering complex questions, given access to a\nlarge unstructured document corpus. The de facto approach to solving the\nproblem is to leverage language models that (iteratively) retrieve and reason\nthrough the retrieved documents, until the model has sufficient information to\ngenerate an answer. Attempts at improving this approach focus on\nretrieval-augmented generation (RAG) metrics such as accuracy and recall and\ncan be categorized into two types: (a) fine-tuning on large question answering\n(QA) datasets augmented with chain-of-thought traces, and (b) leveraging\nRL-based fine-tuning techniques that rely on question-document relevance\nsignals. However, efficiency in the number of retrieval searches is an equally\nimportant metric, which has received less attention. In this work, we show\nthat: (1) Large-scale fine-tuning is not needed to improve RAG metrics,\ncontrary to popular claims in recent literature. Specifically, a standard ReAct\npipeline with improved prompts can outperform state-of-the-art methods on\nbenchmarks such as HotPotQA. (2) Supervised and RL-based fine-tuning can help\nRAG from the perspective of frugality, i.e., the latency due to number of\nsearches at inference time. For example, we show that we can achieve\ncompetitive RAG metrics at nearly half the cost (in terms of number of\nsearches) on popular RAG benchmarks, using the same base model, and at a small\ntraining cost (1000 examples).",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in video generation techniques have given rise to an emerging\nparadigm of generative video coding for Ultra-Low Bitrate (ULB) scenarios by\nleveraging powerful generative priors. However, most existing methods are\nlimited by domain specificity (e.g., facial or human videos) or excessive\ndependence on high-level text guidance, which tend to inadequately capture\nfine-grained motion details, leading to unrealistic or incoherent\nreconstructions. To address these challenges, we propose Trajectory-Guided\nGenerative Video Coding (dubbed T-GVC), a novel framework that bridges\nlow-level motion tracking with high-level semantic understanding. T-GVC\nfeatures a semantic-aware sparse motion sampling pipeline that extracts\npixel-wise motion as sparse trajectory points based on their semantic\nimportance, significantly reducing the bitrate while preserving critical\ntemporal semantic information. In addition, by integrating trajectory-aligned\nloss constraints into diffusion processes, we introduce a training-free\nguidance mechanism in latent space to ensure physically plausible motion\npatterns without sacrificing the inherent capabilities of generative models.\nExperimental results demonstrate that T-GVC outperforms both traditional and\nneural video codecs under ULB conditions. Furthermore, additional experiments\nconfirm that our framework achieves more precise motion control than existing\ntext-guided methods, paving the way for a novel direction of generative video\ncoding guided by geometric motion modeling.",

Here we present a weak gravitational\nlensing analysis of early Euclid observations obtained for the field around the\nmassive galaxy cluster Abell 2390 as part of the Euclid Early Release\nObservations programme. We conduct galaxy shape measurements using three\nindependent algorithms (LensMC, KSB+, and SourceXtractor++). Incorporating\nmulti-band photometry from Euclid and Subaru/Suprime-Cam, we estimate\nphotometric redshifts to preferentially select background sources from\ntomographic redshift bins, for which we calibrate the redshift distributions\nusing the self-organising map approach and data from the Cosmic Evolution\nSurvey (COSMOS). We quantify the residual cluster member contamination and\ncorrect for it in bins of photometric redshift and magnitude using their source\ndensity profiles, including corrections for source obscuration and\nmagnification. We reconstruct the cluster mass distribution and jointly fit the\ntangential reduced shear profiles of the different tomographic bins with\nspherical Navarro--Frenk--White profile predictions to constrain the cluster\nmass, finding consistent results for the three shape catalogues and good\nagreement with earlier measurements. As an important validation test we compare\nthese joint constraints to mass measurements obtained individually for the\ndifferent tomographic bins, finding good consistency. More detailed constraints\non the cluster properties are presented in a companion paper that additionally\nincorporates strong lensing measurements. Our analysis provides a first\ndemonstration of the outstanding capabilities of Euclid for tomographic weak\nlensing measurements.",

A\ndivergence-free Banerjee-Galtier type (Banerjee and Galtier, JoPA, 2017) exact\nrelation is derived for three-dimensional homogeneous and not necessarily\nisotropic EMHD turbulence. By explicit calculation, it has been shown that the\nenergy cascade is not affected by the presence of a uniform background magnetic\nfield Bo. Using direct numerical simulations, a Kolmogorov-like energy cascade\nwith a constant flux rate is observed across the electron inertial scale $d_e$.\nHowever, as expected, for length scales greater than $d_e$, a magnetic power\nspectra of $k^{-7/3}$ is obtained whereas for scales smaller than $d_e$, a\n$k^{-5/3}$ spectra is obtained. Similar universal cascade rate is also\ncalculated from the scale-by-scale budget in Fourier space and is found to be\nequal to the one calculated using the exact law in real space. Finally,\nquenching the turbulence drive, the relaxation of a fully-developed EMHD\nturbulence is studied using the recently proposed principle of vanishing\nnonlinear transfers (Banerjee, Halder and Pan, PRE(L), 2023) which convincingly\nshows the existence of a pressure-balanced relaxed state.",

    "abstract": "Electroencephalography (EEG) is establishing itself as an important,\nlow-cost, noninvasive diagnostic tool for the early detection of Parkinson's\nDisease (PD). In this context, EEG-based Deep Learning (DL) models have shown\npromising results due to their ability to discover highly nonlinear patterns\nwithin the signal. However, current state-of-the-art DL models suffer from poor\ngeneralizability caused by high inter-subject variability. This high\nvariability underscores the need for enhancing model generalizability by\ndeveloping new architectures better tailored to EEG data. This paper introduces\nTransformEEG, a hybrid Convolutional-Transformer designed for Parkinson's\ndisease detection using EEG data. Unlike transformer models based on the EEGNet\nstructure, TransformEEG incorporates a depthwise convolutional tokenizer. This\ntokenizer is specialized in generating tokens composed by channel-specific\nfeatures, which enables more effective feature mixing within the self-attention\nlayers of the transformer encoder. To evaluate the proposed model, four public\ndatasets comprising 290 subjects (140 PD patients, 150 healthy controls) were\nharmonized and aggregated. A 10-outer, 10-inner Nested-Leave-N-Subjects-Out\n(N-LNSO) cross-validation was performed to provide an unbiased comparison\nagainst seven other consolidated EEG deep learning models. TransformEEG\nachieved the highest balanced accuracy's median (78.45%) as well as the lowest\ninterquartile range (6.37%) across all the N-LNSO partitions. When combined\nwith data augmentation and threshold correction, median accuracy increased to\n80.10%, with an interquartile range of 5.74%. In conclusion, TransformEEG\nproduces more consistent and less skewed results. It demonstrates a substantial\nreduction in variability and more reliable PD detection using EEG data compared\nto the other investigated models.",

In contrast, under uniaxial tensile\nstrain (UTS), the nodal line remains in the ($k_x$-$k_z$) plane across the\nentire studied range of UTS. Interestingly, on the application of equi-biaxial\ntensile strain (EBTS) along a-b (a-c) directions, it hosts only one nodal ring\nbelow 8\\% ($<$6\\%), which further evolves into three (seven) nodal-ring for\nEBTS of 8\\% (6\\%$\\leq$EBTS$\\leq$8\\%).

    "abstract": "The intensity and energy spectrum of galactic cosmic rays in the heliosphere\nare significantly influenced by the 11-year solar cycle, a phenomenon known as\nsolar modulation. Understanding this effect and its underlying physical\nmechanisms is essential for assessing radiation exposure and associated risks\nduring space missions. Starting from a previously developed effective\npredictive model of solar modulation, validated using cosmic ray flux\nmeasurements from space-based detectors such as PAMELA and AMS-02, we build a\ngeneralizable forecasting strategy for the long-term evolution of cosmic ray\nfluxes. This strategy is based on identifying delayed cross-correlation\nrelationships between solar proxies and the model's parameters. It integrates\nrecent findings on time lags between cosmic ray fluxes and solar activity, and\nincorporates advanced time-series signal processing techniques. The framework\nnot only performs well in reproducing observed data, but also shows strong\npotential for applications in space radiation monitoring and forecasting. By\nefficiently capturing the long-term variability of galactic cosmic rays, our\napproach contributes valuable insights for evaluating radiation risks,\nultimately supporting safer and more effective space exploration.",

The perovskite La$_{0.5}$Sr$_{0.5}$CoO$_3$,\nknown for its excellent mixed ionic-electronic conduction, has attracted\nsignificant attention due to its favorable vacancy characteristics. In this\nstudy, we employ first-principles calculations to systematically investigate\nthe impact of 3$d$ transition-metal doping on the oxygen vacancy formation\nenergies in the perovskite. Two magnetic states, namely the ferromagnetic and\nparamagnetic states, are considered in our models to capture the influence of\nmagnetic effects on oxygen vacancy energetics. Our results reveal that the\noxygen vacancy formation energies are strongly dependent on both the dopant\nspecies and the magnetic state. Notably, the magnetic states alter the vacancy\nformation energy in a dopant-specific manner due to double exchange\ninteractions, indicating that relying solely on the ferromagnetic ground state\nmay result in misleading trends in doping behavior.

Interference is modeled as a\nlatent vector of available channel quality indicator (CQI), using a vector\ndiscrete-time state-space model (vDSSM) at the SN controller, where the CQI is\nsubjected to compression, quantization, and delay-induced errors. To robustly\nestimate interference power values under these impairments, we employ a\nlow-complexity, outlier-robust, sparse Student-t process regression (SPTPR)\nmethod. This is integrated into a modified unscented Kalman filter, which\nrecursively refines predicted interference using CQI, enabling accurate\nestimation and compensating protocol feedback delays, crucial for accurate LA.\nNumerical results show that the proposed method achieves over 10x lower\ncomplexity compared to a similar non-parametric baseline.

To\nclose the loop between sensing and actuation, both the detection and the\ngeneration of in-body molecular communication (MC) signals is key. However,\ngenerating signals inside the human body, e.g., via synthetic nanodevices,\nposes a challenge in SMC, due to technological obstacles as well as legal,\nsafety, and ethical issues. Hence, this paper considers an SMC system in which\nsignals are generated indirectly via the modulation of a natural in-body MC\nsystem, namely the gut-brain axis (GBA). Therapeutic GBA modulation is already\nestablished as treatment for neurological diseases, e.g., drug refractory\nepilepsy (DRE), and performed via the administration of nutritional supplements\nor specific diets. However, the molecular signaling pathways that mediate the\neffect of such treatments are mostly unknown. Consequently, existing treatments\nare standardized or designed heuristically and able to help only some patients\nwhile failing to help others. In this paper, we propose to leverage personal\nhealth data, e.g., gathered by in-body IoBNT devices, to design more versatile\nand robust GBA modulation-based treatments as compared to the existing ones. To\nshow the feasibility of our approach, we define a catalog of theoretical\nrequirements for therapeutic GBA modulation. Then, we propose a machine\nlearning model to verify these requirements for practical scenarios when only\nlimited data on the GBA modulation exists. By evaluating the proposed model on\nseveral datasets, we confirm its excellent accuracy in identifying different\nmodulators of the GBA. Finally, we utilize the proposed model to identify\nspecific modulatory pathways that play an important role for therapeutic GBA\nmodulation.",

As well\nas in conventional algebra, linear programming problem in the tropical semiring\nhas been developed. In this study, we introduce a new type of tropical\noptimization problem, namely, tropical linearly factorized programming problem.\nThis problem involves minimizing the objective function given by the product of\ntropical linear forms $c_{k,1}\\otimes x_1\\oplus \\cdots\\oplus c_{k,n}\\otimes\nx_n$ divided by a tropical monomial, subject to tropical linear inequality\nconstraints. The objective function is convex in the conventional sense but not\nin the tropical sense, while the feasible set is convex in the tropical sense\nbut not in the conventional sense.\n  Our algorithm for tropical linearly factorized programming is based on the\ndescent method and exploits tangent digraphs. First, we demonstrate that the\nfeasible descent direction at the current solution can be obtained by solving\nthe minimum $s$-$t$ cut problem on a specific subgraph of the tangent digraph.\nAlthough exponentially many such digraphs may exist in general, a more\nefficient algorithm is devised in cases where the problem is non-degenerate.\nFocusing on the fact that tangent digraphs become spanning trees in\nnon-degenerate cases, we present a simplex-like algorithm that updates the tree\nstructure iteratively. We show that each iteration can be executed in\n$O(r_A+r_C)$ time, where $r_A$ and $r_C$ are the numbers of ``non-zero''\ncoefficients in the linear constraints and objective function, respectively.\nFor integer instances, our algorithm finds a local optimum in\n$O((m+n)(r_A+r_C)MD)$ time, where $n$ and $m$ are the number of decision\nvariables and constraints, respectively, $M$ is the maximum absolute value of\ncoefficients and $D$ is the degree of the objective function.",

While incomplete multi-modal\nlearning methods attempt to address this, learning robust and discriminative\nfeatures from arbitrary missing modalities remains challenging. To address this\nchallenge, we propose a novel Semantic-guided Masked Mutual Learning (SMML)\napproach to distill robust and discriminative knowledge across diverse missing\nmodality scenarios.Specifically, we propose a novel dual-branch masked mutual\nlearning scheme guided by Hierarchical Consistency Constraints (HCC) to ensure\nmulti-level consistency, thereby enhancing mutual learning in incomplete\nmulti-modal scenarios. The HCC framework comprises a pixel-level constraint\nthat selects and exchanges reliable knowledge to guide the mutual learning\nprocess. Additionally, it includes a feature-level constraint that uncovers\nrobust inter-sample and inter-class relational knowledge within the latent\nfeature space. To further enhance multi-modal learning from missing modality\ndata, we integrate a refinement network into each student branch. This network\nleverages semantic priors from the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to provide\nsupplementary information, effectively complementing the masked mutual learning\nstrategy in capturing auxiliary discriminative knowledge.

    "abstract": "Floods are among the most frequent natural hazards and cause significant\nsocial and economic damage. Timely, large-scale information on flood extent and\ndepth is essential for disaster response; however, existing products often\ntrade spatial detail for coverage or ignore flood depth altogether. To bridge\nthis gap, this work presents HOTA: Hierarchical Overlap-Tiling Aggregation, a\nplug-and-play, multi-scale inference strategy. When combined with SegFormer and\na dual-constraint depth estimation module, this approach forms a complete 3D\nflood-mapping pipeline. HOTA applies overlapping tiles of different sizes to\nmultispectral Sentinel-2 images only during inference, enabling the SegFormer\nmodel to capture both local features and kilometre-scale inundation without\nchanging the network weights or retraining. The subsequent depth module is\nbased on a digital elevation model (DEM) differencing method, which refines the\n2D mask and estimates flood depth by enforcing (i) zero depth along the flood\nboundary and (ii) near-constant flood volume with respect to the DEM. A case\nstudy on the March 2021 Kempsey (Australia) flood shows that HOTA, when coupled\nwith SegFormer, improves IoU from 73\\% (U-Net baseline) to 84\\%. The resulting\n3D surface achieves a mean absolute boundary error of less than 0.5 m. These\nresults demonstrate that HOTA can produce accurate, large-area 3D flood maps\nsuitable for rapid disaster response.",

At this scale, the\nsynchronisation processes are increasingly investigated as one of the key\nmechanisms revealing many aspects of brain functional coherence in healthy\nbrains and revealing deviations due to various brain disorders. For the human\nconnectome core network, consisting of the eight brain hubs and the\nhigher-order structure attached to them, previous simulations of Kuramoto phase\noscillators at network nodes indicate instability of the global order parameter\nfor a range of positive coupling strengths. In this work, we investigate the\nmultiscale oscillations of the global phase order parameter and show that they\nare connected with the cluster synchronisation processes occurring in this\nrange of couplings below the master stability threshold. We use the spectral\ngraph analysis and eigenvector localisation methodology, where the clusters of\nnodes playing a similar role in the synchronisation processes have a small\nmutual distance in the eigenvector space. We determine three significant\nclusters of brain regions and show the position of hubs in them. With the\nparallel analysis of the weighted core network and its binary version, we\ndemonstrate the primary role of the network's topology in the formation of\nsynchronised clusters.

To mitigate these issues, 3GPP introduced conditional\nhandovers (CHOs), a new type of HO that enables the preparation (i.e., resource\nallocation) of multiple cells for a single user to increase the chance of HO\nsuccess and decrease the delays in the procedure.

    "abstract": "In massive binary-star systems, supernova explosions can significantly alter\nthe orbit during the formation of compact objects. Some compact objects are\npredicted to form via direct collapse, a scenario with negligible mass loss and\nno baryonic ejecta emitted. In this scenario, most of the energy is released\nvia neutrinos, and any resulting natal kick arises from asymmetries in their\nemission. Here I investigate stellar collapse leading to binary black hole (BH)\nformation, with a focus on how the natal kick influences the\ngravitational-wave-driven merger time. Broadly, I find three regimes. For low\nnatal kicks, the effect on the time-to-coalescence is negligible. For moderate\nnatal kicks, if the binary remains bound, up to 50% of binary BHs experience a\ndecrease in their time-to-coalescence by more than an order of magnitude. For\nlarge natal kicks, although most binaries become unbound, those that remain\nbound may acquire retrograde orbits and/or lead to shorter time-to-coalescence.\nFor binary BH mergers, large natal kicks ($\\gtrsim100$ km/s) are hard to\nreconcile with both neutrino natal kicks and the complete collapse scenario.\nThis suggests that retrograde orbits and shortened merger times could only\narise in volatile BH formation scenarios or if spin-axis tossing is at work.\nConsequently, electromagnetic observations of BHs in massive star binaries\nwithin the Local Group offer a more effective means to probe the physics behind\ncomplete collapse. Another promising population for deciphering the complete\ncollapse scenario is that of massive, wide binaries. Although Gaia may help\nshed light on these systems, longer observational baselines will likely be\nneeded to fully understand the roles of neutrino natal kicks and stellar\ncollapse in BH formation.",

However,\nexisting methods face significant challenges, such as disease class imbalance\nand insufficient cross-modal fusion. To address these issues, we propose the\nlearnable Retrieval Enhanced Visual-Text Alignment and Fusion (REVTAF)\nframework, which effectively tackles both class imbalance and visual-text\nfusion in report generation. REVTAF incorporates two core components: (1) a\nLearnable Retrieval Enhancer (LRE) that utilizes semantic hierarchies from\nhyperbolic space and intra-batch context through a ranking-based metric. LRE\nadaptively retrieves the most relevant reference reports, enhancing image\nrepresentations, particularly for underrepresented (tail) class inputs; and (2)\na fine-grained visual-text alignment and fusion strategy that ensures\nconsistency across multi-source cross-attention maps for precise alignment.\nThis component further employs an optimal transport-based cross-attention\nmechanism to dynamically integrate task-relevant textual knowledge for improved\nreport generation. By combining adaptive retrieval with multi-source alignment\nand fusion, REVTAF achieves fine-grained visual-text integration under weak\nimage-report level supervision while effectively mitigating data imbalance\nissues. The experiments demonstrate that REVTAF outperforms state-of-the-art\nmethods, achieving an average improvement of 7.4% on the MIMIC-CXR dataset and\n2.9% on the IU X-Ray dataset.

The zero 3rd order (Z3RO) precoder applies a negative polarity to\nseveral antennas to cancel the PA distortion at the user location, resulting in\ndistortion being transmitted in non-user locations.

To\npreserve user privacy without compromising the utility of the global model,\nsecure aggregation emerges as a promising approach by coordinating the use of\nprivacy-preserving noise (secret keys) across participating clients. However,\nthe unreliable communication will randomly disrupt the key coordination and\ndisable the exact recovery of the global model in secure aggregation.\nFurthermore, unreliable communication can distort the optimization trajectory,\ncausing the global model to deviate further from the intended global optimum.To\naddress these challenges, we propose Secure Cooperative Gradient Coding\n(SecCoGC), a practical solution that achieves accurate aggregation with\narbitrarily strong privacy guarantees and is inherently robust to communication\nuncertainties. To ensure fairness in privacy protection, we further introduce\nFair-SecCoGC, an extension of SecCoGC that enforces equitable privacy\npreservation across all clients. Notably, Fair-SecCoGC achieves optimal privacy\nunder a per-key total power constraint. We formally formulate the problem of\nsecure aggregation in the real field and present both general and\ncomputationally efficient methods for secret key construction. Our privacy\nanalysis covers both Local Mutual Information Privacy (LMIP) and Local\nDifferential Privacy (LDP) across all protocol layers, accounting for\nintermittent networks and correlation among secret keys. In addition, we\ncharacterize the system reliability and convergence properties of the proposed\nscheme. Experimental results demonstrate that SecCoGC achieves strong\nresilience to unreliable communication while maintaining arbitrarily strong\nprivacy guarantees, yielding test accuracy improvements of 20% to 70% over\nexisting privacy-preserving methods.",

The expression for the strength of the non-relativistic MHD shock wave\nhas been obtained, and the Rankine-Hugoniot (R-H) shock jump relations, or\nboundary conditions, for the pressure, the density, and the particle velocity\nacross an MHD shock front have been derived in terms of a shock compression\nratio. The simplified forms of shock jump relations have been written\nsimultaneously for the weak and strong MHD shock waves in terms of the magnetic\nfield strength, the non-idealness parameter, and the ratio of specific heats of\nthe gas. Further, the case of weak shocks has been explored under two distinct\nconditions, viz., (i) when the applied magnetic field is weak and (ii) when the\nfield is strong, respectively. The case of strong shocks has also been\ninvestigated under two distinct ways: (i) as in the purely non-magnetic case,\nwhen the ratio of densities on either side of the shock nearly equals\n$(\\gamma+1)/(\\gamma-1)$ or (ii) when the applied magnetic field is large. This\nis when the ambient magnetic pressure is large as compared with the ambient gas\npressure. Finally, the effects on the shock strength and the pressure across\nthe MHD shock front are studied due to the magnetic field strength and the\nnon-idealness parameter of the gases.

In recent years,\ntheorists have paid much attention to the final interior processes within\nmassive stars, as they can be essential for revealing neutrino-driven supernova\nmechanisms and other potential transients of massive star collapse. However, it\nis challenging to observe directly the last hours of a massive star before\nexplosion, since it is the supernova event that triggers the start of intense\nobservational study. Here we report evidence for a final phase of stellar\nactivity known as a ``shell merger'', an intense shell burning in which the\nO-burning shell swallows its outer C-/Ne-burning shell, deep within the\nprogenitor's interior moments before the supernova explosion. In the violent\nconvective layer created by the shell merger, Ne, which is abundant in the\nstellar O-rich layer, is burned as it is pulled inward, and Si, which is\nsynthesized inside, is transported outward. The remnant still preserves some\ntraces of such Ne-rich downflows and Si-rich upflows in the O-rich layer,\nsuggesting that inhomogeneous shell-merger mixing began just hours ($\\lesssim\n10^4$ s) before its gravitational collapse. Our results provide the first\nobservational evidence that the final stellar burning process rapidly alters\nthe internal structure, leaving a pre-supernova asymmetry. This breaking of\nspherical symmetry facilitates the explosion of massive stars and influences\nvarious supernova and remnant characteristics, including explosion asymmetries\nand the neutron star's kick and spin.",

The demand for real-time AD has surged\nwith the rise of the (Industrial) Internet of Things, where massive volumes of\nmultivariate sensor data must be processed instantaneously. Real-time AD\nrequires methods that not only handle high-dimensional streaming data but also\noperate in a single-pass manner, without the burden of storing historical\ninstances, thereby ensuring minimal memory usage and fast decision-making. We\npropose DAD, a novel real-time decorrelation-based anomaly detection method for\nmultivariate time series, based on an online decorrelation learning approach.\nUnlike traditional proximity-based or reconstruction-based detectors that\nprocess entire data or windowed instances, DAD dynamically learns and monitors\nthe correlation structure of data sample by sample in a single pass, enabling\nefficient and effective detection. To support more realistic benchmarking\npractices, we also introduce a practical hyperparameter tuning strategy\ntailored for real-time anomaly detection scenarios. Extensive experiments on\nwidely used benchmark datasets demonstrate that DAD achieves the most\nconsistent and superior performance across diverse anomaly types compared to\nstate-of-the-art methods.

    "abstract": "In signal processing and data recovery, reconstructing a signal from\nquadratic measurements poses a significant challenge, particularly in\nhigh-dimensional settings where measurements $m$ is far less than the signal\ndimension $n$ (i.e., $m \\ll n$). This paper addresses this problem by\nexploiting signal sparsity. Using tools from algebraic geometry, we derive\ntheoretical recovery guarantees for sparse quadratic systems, showing that\n$m\\ge 2s$ (real case) and $m\\ge 4s-2$ (complex case) generic measurements\nsuffice to uniquely recover all $s$-sparse signals. Under a Gaussian\nmeasurement model, we propose a novel two-stage Sparse Gauss-Newton (SGN)\nalgorithm. The first stage employs a support-restricted spectral\ninitialization, yielding an accurate initial estimate with $m=O(s^2\\log{n})$\nmeasurements. The second stage refines this estimate via an iterative\nhard-thresholding Gauss-Newton method, achieving quadratic convergence to the\ntrue signal within finitely many iterations when $m\\ge O(s\\log{n})$. Compared\nto existing second-order methods, our algorithm achieves near-optimal sampling\ncomplexity for the refinement stage without requiring resampling. Numerical\nexperiments indicate that SGN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art\nalgorithms in both accuracy and computational efficiency. In particular, (1)\nwhen sparsity level $s$ is high, compared with existing algorithms, SGN can\nachieve the same success rate with fewer measurements. (2) SGN converges with\nonly about $1/10$ iterations of the best existing algorithm and reach lower\nrelative error.",

    "abstract": "Variational quantum algorithms hold great promise for unlocking the power of\nnear-term quantum processors, yet high measurement costs, barren plateaus, and\nchallenging optimization landscapes frequently hinder them. Here, we introduce\nsVQNHE, a neural-guided variational quantum algorithm that decouples amplitude\nand sign learning across classical and quantum modules, respectively. Our\napproach employs shallow quantum circuits composed of commuting diagonal gates\nto efficiently model quantum phase information, while a classical neural\nnetwork learns the amplitude distribution and guides circuit optimization in a\nbidirectional feedback loop. This hybrid quantum-classical synergy not only\nreduces measurement costs but also achieves high expressivity with limited\nquantum resources and improves the convergence rate of the variational\noptimization. We demonstrate the advancements brought by sVQNHE through\nextensive numerical experiments. For the 6-qubit J1-J2 model, a prototypical\nsystem with a severe sign problem for Monte Carlo-based methods, it reduces the\nmean absolute error by 98.9% and suppresses variance by 99.6% relative to a\nbaseline neural network, while requiring nearly 19x fewer optimization steps\nthan a standard hardware-efficient VQE. Furthermore, for MaxCut problems on\n45-vertex Erdos-Renyi graphs, sVQNHE improves solution quality by 19% and\nquantum resource efficiency by 85%. Importantly, this framework is designed to\nbe scalable and robust against hardware noise and finite-sampling uncertainty,\nmaking it well-suited for both current NISQ processors and future high-quality\nquantum computers.

To address this, this\nstudy employs a novel semi-supervised deep learning model, GC-SWGAN, aimed at\nidentifying galaxy rings from high-resolution images of the DESI Legacy Imaging\nSurveys. We selected over 5,000 confirmed ringed galaxies from the Catalog of\nSouthern Ringed Galaxies (CSRG) and the Northern Ringed Galaxies from the GZ2\ncatalog (GZ2-CNRG), both verified by morphology expert R.

Through semi-supervised\nlearning, the model significantly reduced reliance on extensive annotated data\nwhile enhancing robustness and generalization. On the test set, it demonstrated\nexceptional performance in identifying ringed galaxies. With a probability\nthreshold of 0.5, the classification accuracy reached 97\\%, with precision and\nrecall for ringed galaxies at 94\\% and 93\\%, respectively.

    "abstract": "Motivated by the bilayer cuprate superconductors and nickelate superconductor\nLa$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, we investigate the evolution from intralayer to interlayer\nsuperconductivity based on a bilayer two-leg $t$-$J$-$J_{\\bot}$ model, where\n$t$ is the in-plane electron hopping, $J$ is the in-plane spin interaction, and\n$J_{\\bot}$ is the inter-plane spin interaction. By means of the density matrix\nrenormalization group calculations, we obtain the quantum phase diagram of the\nsystem by tuning $J_{\\bot}$ in a large doping range $\\delta = 1/8 - 1/2$. We\nfind that a large $J_{\\bot}$ can always drive an interlayer superconductivity\nby coupling the two layers in both the Luther-Emery liquid and Luttinger liquid\nstates. By coupling two Luther-Emery liquid states, the in-plane\nsuperconductivity evolves to inter-plane superconductivity either through an\nintermediate charge density wave (CDW) phase or directly, depending on doping\nratio. This emergent CDW phase, which exists over a finite doping range,\nappears to develop from the CDW state of the two-leg ladder at $\\delta = 1/4$.\nBy coupling two Luttinger liquids, the in-plane Luttinger liquids show a\ntransition to the inter-plane superconducting phase at large $J_{\\bot}$, as\nreported in previous literature. Interestingly, in the intermediate $J_{\\bot}$\nregime we find that while the in-plane Luttinger-liquid features remain stable,\nthe inter-plane superconductivity can develop an enhanced quasi-long-range\norder with the power exponent $K^{zz}_{\\rm SC} \\sim 1$. At last, we show that\nthe interlayer superconductivity is also stable by coupling the bilayer\nthree-leg $t$-$J$ ladders by a strong $J_{\\bot}$ interaction, from both the\nLuther-Emery liquid and Luttinger-liquid states.",

We highlight potential\nmethodological paths and a case study toward this goal, focusing on emergent\nsearch algorithms.

The\nrigorous, systematic evaluation of how LLMs actually solve tasks provides an\nalternative to resource-intensive scaling, reorienting the field toward a\nprincipled understanding of underlying computations. Such algorithmic\nexplanations offer a pathway to human-understandable interpretability, enabling\ncomprehension of the model's internal reasoning performance measures.

To address this gap, we study\nArabic-English RAG in a domain-specific setting using benchmarks derived from\nreal-world corporate datasets. Our benchmarks include all combinations of\nlanguages for the user query and the supporting document, drawn independently\nand uniformly at random. This enables a systematic study of multilingual\nretrieval behavior.\n  Our findings reveal that retrieval is a critical bottleneck in cross-lingual\ndomain-specific scenarios, with significant performance drops occurring when\nthe user query and supporting document languages differ. A key insight is that\nthese failures stem primarily from the retriever's difficulty in ranking\ndocuments across languages. Finally, we propose a simple retrieval strategy\nthat addresses this source of failure by enforcing equal retrieval from both\nlanguages, resulting in substantial improvements in cross-lingual and overall\nperformance.

This paper introduces a novel continual learning approach\ninspired by human learning strategies like Active Recall, Deliberate Practice\nand Spaced Repetition, named Task Focused Consolidation with Spaced Recall\n(TFC-SR). TFC-SR enhances the standard experience replay with a mechanism we\ntermed the Active Recall Probe. It is a periodic, task-aware evaluation of the\nmodel's memory that stabilizes the representations of past knowledge. We test\nTFC-SR on the Split MNIST and Split CIFAR-100 benchmarks against leading\nregularization-based and replay-based baselines. Our results show that TFC-SR\nperforms significantly better than these methods. For instance, on the Split\nCIFAR-100, it achieves a final accuracy of 13.17% compared to standard replay's\n7.40%. We demonstrate that this advantage comes from the stabilizing effect of\nthe probe itself, and not from the difference in replay volume. Additionally,\nwe analyze the trade-off between memory size and performance and show that\nwhile TFC-SR performs better in memory-constrained environments, higher replay\nvolume is still more effective when available memory is abundant. We conclude\nthat TFC-SR is a robust and efficient approach, highlighting the importance of\nintegrating active memory retrieval mechanisms into continual learning systems.",

Such\ncoefficients capture the local density of the neighborhood of each node,\nconsidering incident triadic structures and paths of length two. For this\nreason, we refer to these coefficients collectively as local triadic\ncoefficients.\n  In this work, we consider the novel problem of computing efficiently the\naverage of local triadic coefficients, over a given partition of the nodes of\nthe input graph into a set of disjoint buckets. The average local triadic\ncoefficients of the nodes in each bucket provide a better insight into the\ninterplay of graph structure and the properties of the nodes associated to each\nbucket. Unfortunately, exact computation, which requires listing all triangles\nin a graph, is infeasible for large networks. Hence, we focus on obtaining\nhighly-accurate probabilistic estimates.\n  We develop Triad, an adaptive algorithm based on sampling, which can be used\nto estimate the average local triadic coefficients for a partition of the nodes\ninto buckets. Triad is based on a new class of unbiased estimators, and\nnon-trivial bounds on its sample complexity, enabling the efficient computation\nof highly accurate estimates.

For each task, scientists carefully\nchoose appropriate modalities or leverage data from purpose-built instruments.\nRecent work on remote sensing foundation models pre-trains computer vision\nmodels on large amounts of remote sensing data. These large-scale models tend\nto focus on specific modalities, often optical RGB or multispectral data. For\nmany important applications, this introduces a mismatch between the application\nmodalities and the pre-training data. Moreover, the large size of foundation\nmodels makes them expensive and difficult to fine-tune on typically small\ndatasets for each task. We address this mismatch with MAPEX, a remote sensing\nfoundation model based on mixture-of-modality experts. MAPEX is pre-trained on\nmulti-modal remote sensing data with a novel modality-conditioned token routing\nmechanism that elicits modality-specific experts. To apply the model on a\nspecific task, we propose a modality aware pruning technique, which only\nretains experts specialized for the task modalities.

Among the investigated models, the CNN with feature\nreduction emerged as the most efficient, offering a balance of high accuracy,\nlow storage requirements, and rapid inference times on both CPUs and GPUs.\nVariations of this version, with only up to 597 trainable parameters,\ndemonstrated the best trade-off in terms of deployment feasibility, accuracy,\nand computational efficiency. These results demonstrate the potential of\nlightweight artificial intelligence (AI) models for real-time hyperspectral\nimage processing, supporting the development of on-board satellite AI systems\nfor space-based applications.",

    "abstract": "The application of methods based on Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D\nGaussian Splatting (3D GS) have steadily gained popularity in the field of 3D\nobject segmentation in static scenes. These approaches demonstrate efficacy in\na range of 3D scene understanding and editing tasks. Nevertheless, the 4D\nobject segmentation of dynamic scenes remains an underexplored field due to the\nabsence of a sufficiently extensive and accurately labelled multi-view video\ndataset. In this paper, we present MUVOD, a new multi-view video dataset for\ntraining and evaluating object segmentation in reconstructed real-world\nscenarios. The 17 selected scenes, describing various indoor or outdoor\nactivities, are collected from different sources of datasets originating from\nvarious types of camera rigs. Each scene contains a minimum of 9 views and a\nmaximum of 46 views. We provide 7830 RGB images (30 frames per video) with\ntheir corresponding segmentation mask in 4D motion, meaning that any object of\ninterest in the scene could be tracked across temporal frames of a given view\nor across different views belonging to the same camera rig. This dataset, which\ncontains 459 instances of 73 categories, is intended as a basic benchmark for\nthe evaluation of multi-view video segmentation methods. We also present an\nevaluation metric and a baseline segmentation approach to encourage and\nevaluate progress in this evolving field.

    "abstract": "YouTube has rapidly emerged as a predominant platform for content\nconsumption, effectively displacing conventional media such as television and\nnews outlets. A part of the enormous video stream uploaded to this platform\nincludes health-related content, both from official public health\norganizations, and from any individual or group that can make an account. The\nquality of information available on YouTube is a critical point of public\nhealth safety, especially when concerning major interventions, such as\nvaccination. This study differentiates itself from previous efforts of auditing\nYouTube videos on this topic by conducting a systematic daily collection of\nposted videos mentioning vaccination for the duration of 3 months. We show that\nthe competition for the public's attention is between public health messaging\nby institutions and individual educators on one side, and commentators on\nsociety and politics on the other, the latest contributing the most to the\nvideos expressing stances against vaccination. Videos opposing vaccination are\nmore likely to mention politicians and publication media such as podcasts,\nreports, and news analysis, on the other hand, videos in favor are more likely\nto mention specific diseases or health-related topics. Finally, we find that,\nat the time of analysis, only 2.7% of the videos have been taken down (by the\nplatform or the channel), despite 20.8% of the collected videos having a\nvaccination hesitant stance, pointing to a lack of moderation activity for\nhesitant content. The availability of high-quality information is essential to\nimprove awareness and compliance with public health interventions. Our findings\nhelp characterize the public discourse around vaccination on one of the largest\nmedia platforms, disentangling the role of the different creators and their\nstances, and as such, they provide important insights for public health\ncommunication policy.",

    "abstract": "Human motion is a continuous physical process in 3D space, governed by\ncomplex dynamic and kinematic constraints. Existing methods typically represent\nthe human pose as an abstract graph structure, neglecting the intrinsic\nphysical dependencies between joints, which increases learning difficulty and\nmakes the model prone to generating unrealistic motions. In this paper, we\npropose GGMotion, a group graph dynamics-kinematics network that models human\ntopology in groups to better leverage dynamics and kinematics priors. To\npreserve the geometric equivariance in 3D space, we propose a novel radial\nfield for the graph network that captures more comprehensive spatio-temporal\ndependencies by aggregating joint features through spatial and temporal edges.\nInter-group and intra-group interaction modules are employed to capture the\ndependencies of joints at different scales. Combined with equivariant\nmultilayer perceptrons (MLP), joint position features are updated in each group\nthrough parallelized dynamics-kinematics propagation to improve physical\nplausibility. Meanwhile, we introduce an auxiliary loss to supervise motion\npriors during training. Extensive experiments on three standard benchmarks,\nincluding Human3.6M, CMU-Mocap, and 3DPW, demonstrate the effectiveness and\nsuperiority of our approach, achieving a significant performance margin in\nshort-term motion prediction.

We\ncharacterise the stars' radial velocity (RV) signals down to a precision of 10\ncm/s on timescales ranging from minutes to planetary periods falling within the\nhost's habitable zone (HZ). We study the RV signature of pulsation,\ngranulation, and stellar activity, inferring the potential presence of planets\naround these stars. Thus, we outline the population of planets that while\nundetectable remain compatible with the available data.\n  A simple model of stellar pulsations successfully reproduced the intra-night\nRV scatter of HD10700 down to a few cm/s. For HD102365 and HD20794, an\nadditional source of scatter at the level of several 10 cm/s remains necessary\nto explain the data. A kima analysis was used to evaluate the number of planets\nsupported by the nightly averaged time series of each of HD10700, HD102365, and\nHD304636, under the assumption that a quasi-periodic Gaussian process (GP)\nregression is able to model the activity signal. While a frequency analysis of\nHD10700 RVs is able to identify a periodic signal at 20d, when it is modelled\nalong with the activity signal the signal is formally non-significant. ESPRESSO\ndata on their own do not provide conclusive evidence for the existence of\nplanets around these three stars.\n  ESPRESSO is shown to reach an on-sky RV precision of better than 10 cm/s on\nshort timescales (<1h) and of 40 cm/s over 3.5 yr. A subdivision of the\ndatasets showcases a precision reaching 20-30 cm/s over one year. These results\nimpose stringent constraints on the impact of granulation mechanisms on RV. In\nspite of no detections, our analysis of HD10700 RVs demonstrates a sensitivity\nto planets with a mass of 1.7M$_{\\oplus}$ for periods of up to 100 d, and a\nmass of 2-5M$_{\\oplus}$ for the star's HZ.

This study\nproposes a federated few-shot learning framework with privacy-preserving\nmechanisms to address the issues of limited labeled data and privacy protection\nin diagnosing respiratory diseases. In particular, a meta-stochastic gradient\ndescent algorithm is proposed to mitigate the overfitting problem that arises\nfrom insufficient data when employing traditional gradient descent methods for\nneural network training.

Given the\nimpracticality of centralizing respiratory disease data dispersed across\nvarious medical institutions, a weighted average algorithm is employed to\naggregate local diagnostic models from different clients, enhancing the\nadaptability of a model across diverse scenarios.

Here, we experimentally investigate thermal phase\ntransitions in a Floquet-engineered double-valley bandstructure realized with\nultracold bosonic atoms in a shaken optical lattice. The system exhibits both\nU(1) and time-reversal $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetries, and in the ground state, it\nforms a chiral superfluid with the Bose-Einstein condensation at a single\nvalley.By tuning the temperature, we observe a vestigial order melting of the\nchiral superfluid: first into a paramagnetic superfluid, and then into a normal\nphase. We measure the superfluid and Ising transition temperatures across a\nrange of driving frequencies, and find that the critical temperature of the\nsuperfluid transition is always higher than that of Ising transition within the\nstudied frequency range. As the frequency approaches the resonance, the Ising\ntransition temperature decreases, while the superfluid transition temperature\nremains almost unaffected. The two phase transitions merge into a single\ntransition at far detuning. Our experimental results imply rich quantum\nmany-body physics as an interplay of quantum and thermal fluctuations in\nperiodically driven quantum systems.",

Unlike the compact support situation, non-compact support of a weak\nsolution can cause a communication weight to have zero lower bounds, and\nposition difference does not have a uniformly linear growth bound. These cause\nthe previous approach based on the nonlinear functional approach for spatial\nand velocity diameters to break down. To overcome these difficulties, we derive\nrefined estimates on the upper bounds for the second-order spatial-velocity\nmoments and show the uniqueness of the weak solution using the estimate on the\ndeviation of particle trajectories. For the estimate of emergent dynamics, we\nconsider two classes of distribution functions with decaying properties (an\nexponential decay or polynomial decay) in phase space, and then verify that the\nsecond moment for the velocity deviation from an average velocity tends to zero\nasymptotically, while the second moment for spatial deviation from the center\nof mass remains bounded uniformly in time. This illustrates the robustness of\nthe mono-cluster flocking dynamics of the KCS model even for fully non-compact\nsupport settings in phase space and generalizes earlier results on flocking\ndynamics in a compact support setting.",

In such extreme conditions, traditional fixed\nWPT infrastructure cannot be safely installed, and batteries rapidly degrade\ndue to hardware failures. In this paper, we propose an uncrewed aerial vehicle\n(UAV)-assisted data collection and WPT framework for batteryless sensor (BLS)\nnetworks deployed in these challenging environments. Specifically, we consider\na practical scenario where a UAV first transfers energy to BLS nodes via WPT,\nenabling these nodes to subsequently transmit their collected data to the UAV\nthrough orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA). Then, we\nformulate a multi-objective optimization problem that aims to maximize the fair\ndata collection volume while minimizing the UAV energy consumption through\njoint optimization of transmit power allocation and flight trajectory planning.\nDue to the non-convex nature and dynamic characteristics of this problem,\nconventional optimization methods prove inadequate. To address these\nchallenges, we propose an enhanced soft actor-critic algorithm with\nparameter-free attention, prioritized experience replay, and value-based reward\ncentering (SAC-PPV), thereby improving the exploration efficiency and learning\nstability of the algorithm in complex WPT scenarios. Simulation results\ndemonstrate that the proposed approach consistently outperforms benchmark\nalgorithms under various network configurations.",

    "abstract": "Conductive domain walls (CDWs) in the uniaxial ferroelectric lithium niobate\n(LiNbO$_3$, LN) have attracted a lot of interest as potential elements in 2D\nnanoelectronics, due to their orders-of-magnitude larger electronic AC and DC\nconductivities as compared to the host material. On the way towards generating\nstandardized CDWs into z-cut bulk LN crystals with controllable geometry and\nelectrical properties, we have encountered setbacks recently: Although the\nfirst preparation step, i.e., the established UV-light-assisted\nliquid-electrode poling, reliably creates fully penetrating hexagonal domains\nwith the DWs being aligned almost parallel to the polarization axis, the second\nstep in the DW 'conductivity-enhancement' process through post-growth voltage\nramping, resulted in randomly-shaped DWs as reflected in their different\ncurrent-voltage (I-V) characteristics even after having applied the same\nprocess parameters. To clarify this phenomenon, we present here an\n\\textit{in-situ} and time-resolved second-harmonic-generation (SHG) microscopy\ninvestigation of DW samples of different sizes, monitoring the DW evolution\nduring that critical voltage ramping, which allowed us to reconstruct the 3D DW\nshapes both prior to and after the enhancement process. As a result, we are\nable to map the temporal changes of the local DW inclination angle $\\alpha$,\nand to quantify the DW velocity. As a consequence, we need to re-assess and\nre-think the origin of the DW conductivity (DWC) in LN: The hitherto assumed\nsimple connection between $\\alpha$ and the DWC can not be generalized, since\npoint defects accumulating along DWs act as extra sources for charge carrier\ntrapping/release, significantly contributing to the DW current.",

    "abstract": "With the increasing deployment of intelligent CCTV systems in outdoor\nenvironments, there is a growing demand for face recognition systems optimized\nfor challenging weather conditions. Adverse weather significantly degrades\nimage quality, which in turn reduces recognition accuracy. Although recent face\nimage restoration (FIR) models based on generative adversarial networks (GANs)\nand diffusion models have shown progress, their performance remains limited due\nto the lack of dedicated modules that explicitly address weather-induced\ndegradations. This leads to distorted facial textures and structures. To\naddress these limitations, we propose a novel GAN-based blind FIR framework\nthat integrates two key components: local Statistical Facial Feature\nTransformation (SFFT) and Degradation-Agnostic Feature Embedding (DAFE). The\nlocal SFFT module enhances facial structure and color fidelity by aligning the\nlocal statistical distributions of low-quality (LQ) facial regions with those\nof high-quality (HQ) counterparts. Complementarily, the DAFE module enables\nrobust statistical facial feature extraction under adverse weather conditions\nby aligning LQ and HQ encoder representations, thereby making the restoration\nprocess adaptive to severe weather-induced degradations. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that the proposed degradation-agnostic SFFT model outperforms\nexisting state-of-the-art FIR methods based on GAN and diffusion models,\nparticularly in suppressing texture distortions and accurately reconstructing\nfacial structures. Furthermore, both the SFFT and DAFE modules are empirically\nvalidated in enhancing structural fidelity and perceptual quality in face\nrestoration under challenging weather scenarios.",

To address computational demands, Sequential\nMonte Carlo Squared (SMC$^2$) is well-suited for high-performance computing\n(HPC) environments. The design of the proposal distribution within SMC$^2$ can\nimprove accuracy and exploration of the posterior as poor proposals may lead to\nhigh variance in importance weights and particle degeneracy. The\nMetropolis-Adjusted Langevin Algorithm (MALA) uses gradient information so that\nparticles preferentially explore regions of higher probability. In this paper,\nwe extend this idea by incorporating second-order information, specifically the\nHessian of the log-target. While second-order proposals have been explored\npreviously in particle Markov Chain Monte Carlo (p-MCMC) methods, we are the\nfirst to introduce them within the SMC$^2$ framework. Second-order proposals\nnot only use the gradient (first-order derivative), but also the curvature\n(second-order derivative) of the target distribution.

    "abstract": "Purpose. Portable low-field (< 0.1 T) MRI is increasingly used for\npoint-of-care imaging, but electromagnetic interference (EMI) presents a\nsignificant challenge, especially in unshielded environments. EMI can degrade\nimage quality and compromise diagnostic utility. This study investigates\nwhether subject grounding can effectively reduce EMI and improve image quality,\ncomparing different grounding strategies. Methods. Experiments were conducted\nusing a 47 mT Halbach-based MRI scanner with a single receive channel.\nReproducibility was evaluated at a second site using a 72 mT scanner with\nsimilar geometry. Turbo spin echo sequences were used to image the hand and\nbrain. Subject grounding was implemented using conductive cloth sleeves or ECG\nelectrodes, each connected between the subject's skin and scanner ground. Three\nEMI conditions were tested: ambient, added single-frequency EMI, and broadband\nEMI. Signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) were calculated under each configuration.\nResults. Subject grounding significantly reduced EMI in both hand and brain\nscans. In hand imaging, conductive sleeves reduced noise from 85x to 1.25x the\n50-ohm noise floor. In brain imaging, grounding alone reduced noise from 55x to\n25x baseline; when combined with arc RF shields, noise was further reduced to\n1.2x baseline, even under added EMI. These results were reproducible across\ndifferent scanners and locations. Conclusion. Subject grounding is a simple,\neffective, and reproducible strategy for mitigating EMI in portable low-field\nMRI. It is especially effective for hand imaging, while brain imaging benefits\nfrom additional RF shielding. The approach is robust under various EMI\nconditions and may complement other denoising techniques.",

Coda waves are\nnow known to carry valuable information about subsurface heterogeneity, making\nthe study of scattering essential for understanding complex geological\nstructures.\n  Wave scattering in unconsolidated granular media is especially relevant to\nplanetary regoliths, such as those on the Moon and Mars. The radiative transfer\nequation (RTE) provides a theoretical framework to link scattering behavior to\nmicrostructural properties like grain size, coordination number, and porosity.\nHowever, the RTE assumes an infinite medium, a condition rarely met in real\nsettings, emphasizing the need to evaluate how boundary effects influence\nscattering and inversion accuracy.\n  This study uses the discrete element method (DEM) to simulate elastic wave\npropagation and scattering in granular media. Unlike traditional numerical\nmethods, DEM explicitly models grain-scale interactions and dynamic behavior,\ncapturing detailed wavefield features shaped by microstructural heterogeneity\nand boundary conditions. By applying the RTE framework, we invert scattered\nwave energy to estimate microstructural parameters and analyze the impact of\nabsorbing (infinite) and rigid (finite) boundary conditions on inversion\nresults.

The proposed\nDCNN demonstrates superior performance compared to conventional BWV detection\nmodels across different datasets. The model achieves a testing accuracy of\n85.71% on the augmented PH2 dataset, 95.00% on the augmented ISIC archive\ndataset, 95.05% on the combined augmented (PH2+ISIC archive) dataset, and\n90.00% on the Derm7pt dataset. An explainable artificial intelligence (XAI)\nalgorithm is subsequently applied to interpret the DCNN's decision-making\nprocess regarding BWV detection. The proposed approach, coupled with XAI,\nsignificantly improves the detection of BWV in skin lesions, outperforming\nexisting models and providing a robust tool for early melanoma diagnosis.",

To account for more\ngeneral antiferromagnetic orders that go beyond the collinear N\\'eel order, two\ndifferent spin-orbit interactions, Dresselhaus and Rashba spin-orbit\ninteractions, are considered. By performing the canonical transformation, we\nderive the corresponding generalized t-J model. At half filling, employing\nself-consistent magnetic order calculations, we find distinctive spin\narrangements under Dresselhaus or Rashba spin-orbit interactions. For the\nDresselhaus spin-orbit interaction, the spin configuration exhibits collinear\nantiferromagnetic order. On the other hand, Rashba interaction results in spins\nantiferromagnetically aligning in xy-plane and a small interaction controlled\nby hopping parameter induces spin tilting, causing antiferromagnetic alignment\nin xy-plane but ferromagnetic alignment in z-direction. We categorize\ntopological properties of these phases for low doping in the generalized t-J\nmodel.: for 3D collinear antiferromagnetic order, the system possesses a\nmodified time-reversal symmetry, characterized by the Z2 index. In contrast,\nfor systems with tilted antiferromagnetic orders, it is protected by inversion\nsymmetry and characterized by the Z4 index. We further examine the bulk-edge\ncorrespondence for non-collinear magnetic phases, revealing that the surface\nstate becomes gapless when the surface is parallel to the ferromagnetic\ncomponent of tilted antiferromagnetic order; otherwise, the surface state\nexhibits a gap.

To address these limitations, we\npropose the Dual Semantic-Aware Network (DSANet), a novel framework designed to\nenhance noise robustness in ultrasound video segmentation by fostering mutual\nsemantic awareness between local and global features. Specifically, we\nintroduce an Adjacent-Frame Semantic-Aware (AFSA) module, which constructs a\nchannel-wise similarity matrix to guide feature fusion across adjacent frames,\neffectively mitigating the impact of random noise without relying on\npixel-level relationships.

This work is the first to theoretical investigate\nhow minimal data-level drifts can maximally degrade the accuracy of learned\nestimators.

Our work not only reveals critical vulnerabilities in\ndeployed learned estimators but also provides the first unified worst-case\ntheoretical analysis of their fragility under data updates. Additionally, we\nidentify two countermeasures to mitigate such black-box attacks, offering\ninsights for developing robust learned database optimizers.",

    "abstract": "The construction of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite constellations has\nrecently attracted tremendous attention from both academia and industry. The 5G\nand 6G standards have identified LEO satellite networks as a key component of\nfuture mobile networks. However, due to the high-speed movement of satellites,\nground terminals often experience frequent and high-latency handovers, which\nsignificantly deteriorate the performance of latency-sensitive applications. To\naddress this challenge, we propose a parallel handover mechanism for mobile\nsatellite networks that can considerably reduce handover latency. The main idea\nis to employ plan-based handovers instead of measurement-based handovers to\navoid interactions between the access and core networks, thereby eliminating\nthe significant time overhead associated with traditional handover procedures.\nSpecifically, we introduce a novel network function named the Satellite\nSynchronized Function (SSF), which is designed to be fully compliant with the\nstandard 5G core network. In addition, we propose a machine learning model for\nsignal strength prediction, coupled with an efficient handover scheduling\nalgorithm. We have conducted extensive experiments, and the results demonstrate\nthat our proposed handover scheme can reduce handover latency by 21\\times\ncompared to the standard NTN handover scheme and two other existing handover\napproaches, along with significant improvements in network stability and\nuser-level performance.",

The mass function corresponding to the\nconsidered geometry is defined in terms of both matter and geometric\nquantities. The orthogonal decomposition of the Riemann tensor is then\nperformed through which a family of scalar quantities, known as structure\nscalars, is obtained. Using the Herrera's recent definition, one of the scalars\namong them is claimed as the complexity factor, \\emph{i.e.},\n$\\mathcal{Y}_{TF}$. Since there are extra degrees of freedom in the\ngravitational equations, some constraints are needed to make their solution\npossible to obtain. In this regard, a well-known vanishing complexity condition\nis introduced along with three different constraints which ultimately lead to\ndistinct stellar models. In order to check their physical feasibility, a\ndetailed graphical interpretation is provided using multiple values of the\nRastall parameter.

    "abstract": "The rapid development of deep-learning enabled task-oriented communications\n(TOC) significantly shifts the paradigm of wireless communications. However,\nthe high computation demands, particularly in resource-constrained systems\ne.g., mobile phones and UAVs, make TOC challenging for many tasks. To address\nthe problem, we propose a novel TOC method with two models: a static and a\ndynamic model. In the static model, we apply a neural network (NN) as a\ntask-oriented encoder (TOE) when there is no computation budget constraint. The\ndynamic model is used when device computation resources are limited, and it\nuses dynamic NNs with multiple exits as the TOE. The dynamic model sorts input\ndata by complexity with thresholds, allowing the efficient allocation of\ncomputation resources. Furthermore, we analyze the convergence of the proposed\nTOC methods and show that the model converges at rate\n$O\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{T}}\\right)$ with an epoch of length $T$. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that the static model outperforms baseline models in terms\nof transmitted dimensions, floating-point operations (FLOPs), and accuracy\nsimultaneously. The dynamic model can further improve accuracy and\ncomputational demand, providing an improved solution for resource-constrained\nsystems.",

Reflecting both research advancements and\npractical policy evolution, AGILE Index 2025 evaluates 40 countries across\nincome levels, regions, and technological development stages, with 4 Pillars,\n17 Dimensions and 43 Indicators. In compiling the data, the team integrates\nmulti-source evidence including policy documents, governance practices,\nresearch outputs, and risk exposure to construct a unified comparison\nframework. This approach maps global disparities while enabling countries to\nidentify governance strengths, gaps, and systemic constraints. Through ongoing\nrefinement and iterations, we hope the AGILE Index will fundamentally advance\ntransparency and measurability in global AI governance, delivering data-driven\nassessments that depict national AI governance capacity, assist governments in\nrecognizing their maturation stages and critical governance issues, and\nultimately provide actionable insights for enhancing AI governance systems\nnationally and globally.",

It might be promising to serve as a\nunique laboratory for exploring the accretion matter near black holes or\ntesting Einstein's gravity. Recent studies debated whether there is a\nnon-Keplerian motion of the flares in the GRAVITY dataset. It motivates us to\npresent a comprehensive analysis based on error estimation under the Bayesian\nframework. This study uses asctrometric flare data to investigate the\npossibility that the flares exhibit deviations from the circular Keplerian\nmotion. By fixing the black hole mass of Sgr A* and using the averaged\nastrometric data from the four flares, our results find that the\nsuper-Keplerian orbit is favored at the near $1\\sigma$ confidence level, where\nthe non-Keperian parameter is $\\omega/\\omega_k=1.45^{+0.35}_{-0.38}$.

However, current\nsystems typically evict KV caches using a Least Recently Used (LRU) policy,\nwhich fails to anticipate future agent usage and often discards KV caches\nshortly before their reuse.

These values guide a fine-grained eviction policy at the KV node\nlevel, allowing KVFlow to preserve entries likely to be reused and efficiently\nmanage shared prefixes in tree-structured caches. Moreover, KVFlow introduces a\nfully overlapped KV prefetching mechanism, which proactively loads required\ntensors from CPU to GPU in background threads for agents scheduled in the next\nstep, thereby avoiding cache miss stalls during generation.

An analogous evolution surface underlies\nsemiclassical representations of the evolution operator, albeit in a doubled\nphase space.

This surface\ncoincides with derivatives of action functions (or generating functions)\ndepending on the choice of appropriate coordinates and its growth departs from\nthe energy shell following trajectories in double phase space. In an initial\nstudy of the resolvent surface based on its caustics, its complex nature is\nrevealed to be analogous to a multidimensional sponge.\n  Resummation of the trace of the resolvent in terms of linear combinations of\nperiodic orbits, known as pseudo orbits or composite orbits, provides a cutoff\nto the semiclassical sum at the Heisenberg time.

Two key\nchallenges hinder progress: (1) the high computational overhead during training\ncaused by multi-timestep spike firing, and (2) the absence of large-scale SNN\narchitectures tailored to speech processing tasks. To overcome the issues, we\nintroduce Input-aware Multi-Level Spikeformer, i.e. IML-Spikeformer, a spiking\nTransformer architecture specifically designed for large-scale speech\nprocessing. Central to our design is the Input-aware Multi-Level Spike (IMLS)\nmechanism, which simulate multi-timestep spike firing within a single timestep\nusing an adaptive, input-aware thresholding scheme. IML-Spikeformer further\nintegrates a Reparameterized Spiking Self-Attention (RepSSA) module with a\nHierarchical Decay Mask (HDM), forming the HD-RepSSA module. This module\nenhances the precision of attention maps and enables modeling of multi-scale\ntemporal dependencies in speech signals.

    "abstract": "Spatial interpolation is a crucial task in geography. As perhaps the most\nwidely used interpolation methods, geostatistical models -- such as Ordinary\nKriging (OK) -- assume spatial stationarity, which makes it difficult to\ncapture the nonstationary characteristics of geographic variables. A common\nsolution is trend surface modeling (e.g., Regression Kriging, RK), which relies\non external explanatory variables to model the trend and then applies\ngeostatistical interpolation to the residuals. However, this approach requires\nhigh-quality and readily available explanatory variables, which are often\nlacking in many spatial interpolation scenarios -- such as estimating heavy\nmetal concentrations underground. This study proposes a Feature-Free Regression\nKriging (FFRK) method, which automatically extracts geospatial features --\nincluding local dependence, local heterogeneity, and geosimilarity -- to\nconstruct a regression-based trend surface without requiring external\nexplanatory variables. We conducted experiments on the spatial distribution\nprediction of three heavy metals in a mining area in Australia. In comparison\nwith 17 classical interpolation methods, the results indicate that FFRK, which\ndoes not incorporate any explanatory variables and relies solely on extracted\ngeospatial features, consistently outperforms both conventional Kriging\ntechniques and machine learning models that depend on explanatory variables.\nThis approach effectively addresses spatial nonstationarity while reducing the\ncost of acquiring explanatory variables, improving both prediction accuracy and\ngeneralization ability. This finding suggests that an accurate characterization\nof geospatial features based on domain knowledge can significantly enhance\nspatial prediction performance -- potentially yielding greater improvements\nthan merely adopting more advanced statistical models.",

However, these methods often apply a\nfixed compression scheme across all conversations, selecting the same layer\npairs for compression without considering conversation-specific attention\ndynamics. This static strategy overlooks variability in attention pattern\nsimilarity across different conversations, which can lead to noticeable\naccuracy degradation.\n  We present Krul, a multi-turn LLM inference system that enables accurate and\nefficient KV cache restoration. Krul dynamically selects compression strategies\nbased on attention similarity across layer pairs and uses a\nrecomputation-loading pipeline to restore the KV cache. It introduces three key\ninnovations: 1) a preemptive compression strategy selector to preserve critical\ncontext for future conversation turns and selects a customized strategy for the\nconversation; 2) a token-wise heterogeneous attention similarity estimator to\nmitigate the attention similarity computation and storage overhead during model\ngeneration; 3) a bubble-free restoration scheduler to reduce potential bubbles\nbrought by the imbalance of recomputing and loading stream due to compressed KV\ncaches. Empirical evaluations on real-world tasks demonstrate that Krul\nachieves a 1.5x-2.68x reduction in time-to-first-token (TTFT) and a 1.33x-2.35x\nreduction in KV cache storage compared to state-of-the-art methods without\ncompromising generation quality.",

This \"Red\nKing\" dynamic potentially explains why fields in which senior researchers\ncommand large labs, major grants, and extensive collaboration portfolios may\nparadoxically evolve conventions that favour junior-author positioning. Our\nsecond model demonstrates that established norms influence researchers'\nwillingness to collaborate, with contribution-sensitive norms consistently\noutperforming insensitive alternatives in fostering successful partnerships.\nContribution-insensitive norms create systematic coordination failures through\ntwo mechanisms: \"main contributor resentment\" when exceptional work goes\nunrecognized, and \"second contributor resentment\" when comparable efforts\nreceive unequal credit.

The framework\nis both non-myopic, optimizing over entire intervention sequences, and\ngoal-oriented, targeting only model aspects relevant to the causal query. To\naddress the intractability of exact EIG computation, we introduce a variational\nlower bound estimator, optimized jointly through a transformer-based policy\nnetwork and normalizing flow-based variational posteriors. The resulting policy\nenables real-time decision-making via an amortized network. We demonstrate that\nGO-CBED consistently outperforms existing baselines across various causal\nreasoning and discovery tasks-including synthetic structural causal models and\nsemi-synthetic gene regulatory networks-particularly in settings with limited\nexperimental budgets and complex causal mechanisms. Our results highlight the\nbenefits of aligning experimental design objectives with specific research\ngoals and of forward-looking sequential planning.",

    "abstract": "This paper investigates optimal withdrawal strategies and behavior of\npolicyholders in a variable annuity (VA) contract with a guaranteed minimum\nwithdrawal benefit (GMWB) rider incorporating taxation and a ratchet mechanism\nfor enhancing the benefit base during the life of the contract. Mathematically,\nthis is accomplished by solving a backward dynamic programming problem\nassociated with optimizing the discounted risk-neutral expectation of cash\nflows from the contract. Furthermore, reflecting traded VA contracts in the\nmarket, we consider hybrid products providing policyholders access to a cash\nfund which functions as an intermediate repository of earnings from the VA and\nearns interest at a contractually specified cash rate. We contribute to the\nliterature by revealing several significant interactions among taxation, the\ncash fund, and the benefit base update mechanism. When tax rates are high, the\ntax-shielding effect of the cash fund, which is taxed differently from ordinary\nwithdrawals from the VA, plays a significant role in enhancing the\nattractiveness of the overall contract. Furthermore, the ratchet benefit base\nupdate scheme (in contrast to the ubiquitous return-of-premium specification in\nthe literature) tends to discourage early surrender as it provides enhanced\ndownside market risk protection. In addition, the cash fund discourages active\nwithdrawals, with policyholders preferring to transfer the guaranteed\nwithdrawal amount to the cash fund to leverage the cash fund rate.",

In the first\nstage, we train a teacher policy with privileged observations to generate\nhigh-quality actions. In the second stage, we introduce a Conditional\nVariational Autoencoder (CVAE) to model a universal student policy that can be\ndeployed directly on real hardware. The CVAE structure allows the policy to\nlearn a global latent representation of motion, enhancing generalization to\nunseen behaviors and addressing the limitations of standard MLP-based policies\nunder partial observations. Unlike pure MLPs that suffer from drift in global\nattributes like orientation, our CVAE-student policy incorporates global intent\nduring training by aligning a partial-observation prior to the full-observation\nencoder. In the third stage, we introduce a fast adaptation module that\nfine-tunes the universal policy on harder motion sequences that are difficult\nto track directly. This adaptation can be performed both for single sequences\nand in batch mode, further showcasing the flexibility and scalability of our\napproach.

Bridging the gap between\ndifferent time and length scales has historically been challenging but the\nadvent of newer machine learning (ML) approaches has shown promise for tackling\nthat task.

Our evaluation shows that while\nAI-generated requirements often lack relevance and correctness compared to\nhuman-created ones, the AI-generated explanations are frequently preferred for\ntheir clarity and style. Nonetheless, correctness remains an issue,\nhighlighting the importance of human validation. This work contributes to the\nadvancement of explainability requirements in software systems by (1)\nintroducing an automated approach to derive requirements from user reviews and\ngenerate corresponding explanations, (2) providing empirical insights into the\nstrengths and limitations of automatically generated artifacts, and (3)\nreleasing a curated dataset to support future research on the automatic\ngeneration of explainability requirements.",

    "abstract": "We show that mixtures comprised of multicomponent systems typically are much\nmore structurally complex than the sum of their parts; sometimes, infinitely\nmore complex. We contrast this with the more familiar notion of statistical\nmixtures, demonstrating how statistical mixtures miss key aspects of emergent\nhierarchical organization. This leads us to identify a new kind of structural\ncomplexity inherent in multicomponent systems and to draw out broad\nconsequences for system ergodicity.",
