    "abstract": "Traffic congestion in modern cities is exacerbated by the limitations of\ntraditional fixed-time traffic signal systems, which fail to adapt to dynamic\ntraffic patterns. Adaptive Traffic Signal Control (ATSC) algorithms have\nemerged as a solution by dynamically adjusting signal timing based on real-time\ntraffic conditions. However, the main limitation of such methods is that they\nare not transferable to environments under real-world constraints, such as\nbalancing efficiency, minimizing collisions, and ensuring fairness across\nintersections. In this paper, we view the ATSC problem as a constrained\nmulti-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) problem and propose a novel algorithm\nnamed Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization with Lagrange Cost Estimator\n(MAPPO-LCE) to produce effective traffic signal control policies. Our approach\nintegrates the Lagrange multipliers method to balance rewards and constraints,\nwith a cost estimator for stable adjustment. We also introduce three\nconstraints on the traffic network: GreenTime, GreenSkip, and PhaseSkip, which\npenalize traffic policies that do not conform to real-world scenarios. Our\nexperimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate that MAPPO-LCE\noutperforms three baseline MARL algorithms by across all environments and\ntraffic constraints (improving on MAPPO by 12.60%, IPPO by 10.29%, and QTRAN by\n13.10%). Our results show that constrained MARL is a valuable tool for traffic\nplanners to deploy scalable and efficient ATSC methods in real-world traffic\nnetworks.

However, despite its effectiveness on high-end\nGPUs, it struggles on edge systems like the Jetson Orin NX Edge GPU, achieving\nonly 7-17 FPS -- well below the over 60 FPS standard required for truly\nimmersive AR/VR experiences. Addressing this challenge, we perform a\ncomprehensive analysis of Gaussian-based AR/VR applications and identify the\nGaussian Blending Stage, which intensively calculates each Gaussian's\ncontribution at every pixel, as the primary bottleneck. In response, we propose\na Gaussian Blending Unit (GBU), an edge GPU plug-in module for real-time\nrendering in AR/VR applications. Notably, our GBU can be seamlessly integrated\ninto conventional edge GPUs and collaboratively supports a wide range of AR/VR\napplications. Specifically, GBU incorporates an intra-row sequential shading\n(IRSS) dataflow that shades each row of pixels sequentially from left to right,\nutilizing a two-step coordinate transformation. When directly deployed on a\nGPU, the proposed dataflow achieved a non-trivial 1.72x speedup on real-world\nstatic scenes, though still falls short of real-time rendering performance.\nRecognizing the limited compute utilization in the GPU-based implementation,\nGBU enhances rendering speed with a dedicated rendering engine that balances\nthe workload across rows by aggregating computations from multiple Gaussians.\nExperiments across representative AR/VR applications demonstrate that our GBU\nprovides a unified solution for on-device real-time rendering while maintaining\nSOTA rendering quality.",

As students increasingly turn to\nthese tools to complete assessments, foundational cognitive skills are at risk\nof being bypassed, challenging the integrity of higher education and the\nauthenticity of student work. Existing AI-generated text detection tools are\ninadequate; they produce unreliable outputs and are prone to both false\npositives and false negatives, especially when students apply paraphrasing,\ntranslation, or rewording.

Equations\noffer explicit relationships between variables, enabling deeper insights into\nunderlying data patterns. Most existing equation discovery methods rely on\ngenetic programming, which iteratively searches the equation space but is often\nslow and prone to overfitting. By representing equations as directed acyclic\ngraphs, we leverage the use of graph neural networks to learn the underlying\nsemantics of equations, and generate new, previously unseen equations. Although\ngraph generative models have been shown to be successful in discovering new\ntypes of graphs in many fields, there application in discovering equations\nremains largely unexplored. In this work, we propose Graph-EQ, a deep graph\ngenerative model designed for efficient equation discovery. Graph-EQ uses a\nconditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) to learn a rich latent\nrepresentation of the equation space by training it on a large corpus of\nequations in an unsupervised manner. Instead of directly searching the equation\nspace, we employ Bayesian optimization to efficiently explore this learned\nlatent space. We show that the encoder-decoder architecture of Graph-Eq is able\nto accurately reconstruct input equations. Moreover, we show that the learned\nlatent representation can be sampled and decoded into valid equations,\nincluding new and previously unseen equations in the training data. Finally, we\nassess Graph-Eq's ability to discover equations that best fit a dataset by\nexploring the latent space using Bayesian optimization.

    "abstract": "Executing quantum logic in cryogenic quantum computers requires a continuous\nenergy supply from room-temperature control electronics. This dependence on\nexternal energy sources creates scalability limitations due to control channel\ndensity and heat dissipation. Here, we propose quantum batteries (QBs) as\nintrinsic quantum energy sources for quantum computation, enabling the\nthermodynamic limit of zero dissipation for unitary gates. Unlike classical\npower sources, QBs maintain quantum coherence with their load,a property that,\nwhile theoretically studied, remains unexploited in practical quantum\ntechnologies. We demonstrate that a bosonic Fock state QB can supply the energy\nrequired for arbitrary unitary gates, regardless of the circuit's depth, via\nquantum field recycling while facilitating a universal gate set controlled by a\nsingle parameter per qubit: its resonant frequency. The relative detuning of\neach qubit from the QB's resonant frequency gives rise to qualitatively two\ngate types, off-resonance and around-resonance. The former facilitates\ndispersive gates which allow multi-qubit parity probing while the latter\nenables energy exchange between the QB and the qubits, driving both population\ntransfer and entanglement generation. This mechanism utilizes the all-to-all\nconnectivity of the shared-resonator architecture to go beyond the standard\nsingle- and two-qubit native gates of current platforms with gate timescales of\nfew pi/g, where g is the qubit-resonator coupling. The resultant speed-up\nincludes also superextensive gates between symmetric Dicke states,\ncharacteristic of QB systems.

In this paper, we compiled a\ndistance-limited ($z<0.15$) sample of 431 LERGs (Fanaroff-Riley, or FR, type 0,\nI, and II RGs) to discuss their jet formation mechanism with the ADAF\n(advection-dominated accretion flow) scenario, and compare their accretion\nproperties with Fermi BL Lacertae objects. We explored different jet mechanisms\n(Blandford-Znajek [BZ] model and a mixture of the BZ and Blandford-Payne,\nhybrid, model) within the framework of ADAF-type disc around a Kerr black hole\nfor both LERGs and Fermi BL Lacs. Based on standard assumptions on the\naccretion-ejection coupling in RGs, the maximum kinetic jet and accretion power\nfor FR 0s, FR Is, FR IIs can be, explained by an ADAF with the pure BZ\nmechanism or hybrid jet mechanism. In addition, for one third of the FR IIs, to\naccount for their higher kinetic jet power than what is simply expected by the\nhybrid jet mechanism, the magnetic field could play an important role as in the\nform of magnetization-driven outflows or stronger magnetic structures, as\nobserved in some BL Lacs with high jet powers. Similarities between BL Lacs and\nLERGs (e.g., accretion-ejection and clustering properties) suggest that high\nsynchrotron peaked BL Lacs could be the beamed counterparts of FR 0s, and a\npotential general unification between LERGs and BL Lacs populations is\ndiscussed.

    "abstract": "We introduce a new model able to characterise the relative costs of\nlow-carbon generation mixes when subject to varying grid-reliability targets,\nwhich are evaluated using 43 years of historical weather data. The model can be\nused to develop cost-minimising strategies, and to assess the extent, duration,\nand frequency of outages under different technology mixes. For a 35-country\nsubset of the European electricity grid, we show that reliably meeting the last\n1% of demand accounts for about 36% of the entire system cost when only onshore\nwind, solar, and storage are used in the generation mix. We also show that by\nincluding small amounts of low-cost, dispatchable load-following generation\n(e.g., natural gas, hydro, or similar) the cost of a reliable, high-renewables\ngrid can be drastically reduced. For example, the system cost can be reduced by\n31% when just 1% of generation is allowed to come from natural gas.",

    "abstract": "Galaxy cluster X-ray cavities are inflated by relativistic jets that are\nejected into the intracluster medium by active galactic nuclei (AGN). AGN jets\nprevent predicted cooling flow establishment at the cluster centre, and while\nthis process is not well understood in existing studies, simulations have shown\nthat the heating mechanism will depend on the type of gas that fills the\ncavities. Thermal and non-thermal distributions of electrons will produce\ndifferent cavity Sunyaev Zel'dovich (SZ) effect signals, quantified by the\n'suppression factor' f. This paper explores potential enhancements to prior\nconstraints on the cavity gas type by simulating suppression factor\nobservations with the Square Kilometre Array (SKA). Cluster cavities across\ndifferent redshifts are observed to predict the optimum way of measuring f in\nfuture observations. We find that the SKA can constrain the suppression factor\nin the cavities of cluster MS 0735.6+7421 (MS0735) in as little as 4 h, with a\nsmallest observable value of f~0.42. Additionally, while the SKA may\ndistinguish between possible thermal or non-thermal suppression factor values\nwithin the cavities of MS0735 if it observes for more than 8 h, determining the\ngas type of other clusters will likely require observations at multiple\nfrequencies. The effect of cavity line of sight (LOS) position is also studied,\nand degeneracies between LOS position and the measured value of f are found.\nFinally, we find that for small cavities (radius < 80 kpc) at high redshift\n(z~1.5), the proposed high frequencies of the SKA (23.75-37.5 GHz) will be\noptimal, and that including MeerKAT antennas will improve all observations of\nthis type.",

Item exposure, indicated by the amount of attention\nitems receive in a ranking, can be influenced by factors like position bias.\nRecent work suggests that inter-item dependencies, such as outlier items in a\nranking, also affect item exposure. Outlier items are items that observably\ndeviate from the other items in a ranked list. Understanding outlier items is\ncrucial for determining an item's exposure distribution. In our previous work,\nwe investigated the impact of different presentational features on users'\nperception of outlier in search results. In this work, we focus on two key\nquestions left unanswered by our previous work: (i) What is the effect of\nisolated bottom-up visual factors on item outlierness in product lists? (ii)\nHow do top-down factors influence users' perception of item outlierness in a\nrealistic online shopping scenario? We start with bottom-up factors and employ\nvisual saliency models to evaluate their ability to detect outlier items in\nproduct lists purely based on visual attributes. Then, to examine top-down\nfactors, we conduct eye-tracking experiments on an online shopping task.\nMoreover, we employ eye-tracking to not only be closer to the real-world case\nbut also to address the accuracy problem of reaction time in the visual search\ntask. Our experiments show the ability of visual saliency models to detect\nbottom-up factors, consistently highlighting areas with strong visual\ncontrasts. The results of our eye-tracking experiment for lists without\noutliers show that despite being less visually attractive, product descriptions\ncaptured attention the fastest, indicating the importance of top-down factors.\nIn our eye-tracking experiments, we observed that outlier items engaged users\nfor longer durations compared to non-outlier items.",

To this end, we propose\nour DiT4SR, one of the pioneering works to tame the large-scale DiT model for\nReal-ISR. Instead of directly injecting embeddings extracted from\nlow-resolution (LR) images like ControlNet, we integrate the LR embeddings into\nthe original attention mechanism of DiT, allowing for the bidirectional flow of\ninformation between the LR latent and the generated latent. The sufficient\ninteraction of these two streams allows the LR stream to evolve with the\ndiffusion process, producing progressively refined guidance that better aligns\nwith the generated latent at each diffusion step. Additionally, the LR guidance\nis injected into the generated latent via a cross-stream convolution layer,\ncompensating for DiT's limited ability to capture local information. These\nsimple but effective designs endow the DiT model with superior performance in\nReal-ISR, which is demonstrated by extensive experiments.

Despite these growing efforts, there remains a lack of\nunderstanding of how developers document their GenAI models on open-source\nplatforms. Through interviews with 13 GenAI developers active on open-source\nplatforms, we provide empirical insights into their documentation practices and\nchallenges. Our analysis reveals that despite existing resources, developers of\nGenAI models still face multiple layers of uncertainties in their model\ndocumentation: (1) uncertainties about what specific content should be\nincluded; (2) uncertainties about how to effectively report key components of\ntheir models; and (3) uncertainties in deciding who should take\nresponsibilities for various aspects of model documentation. Based on our\nfindings, we discuss the implications for policymakers, open-source platforms,\nand the research community to support meaningful, effective and actionable\nmodel documentation in the GenAI era, including cultivating better community\nnorms, building robust evaluation infrastructures, and clarifying roles and\nresponsibilities.",

    "abstract": "Vision-language models (VLMs) are prone to object hallucinations, where they\nerroneously indicate the presenceof certain objects in an image. Existing\nbenchmarks quantify hallucinations using relatively small, labeled datasets.\nHowever, this approach is i) insufficient to assess hallucinations that arise\nin open-world settings, where VLMs are widely used, and ii) inadequate for\ndetecting systematic errors in VLMs. We propose DASH (Detection and Assessment\nof Systematic Hallucinations), an automatic, large-scale pipeline designed to\nidentify systematic hallucinations of VLMs on real-world images in an\nopen-world setting. A key component is DASH-OPT for image-based retrieval,\nwhere we optimize over the ''natural image manifold'' to generate images that\nmislead the VLM. The output of DASH consists of clusters of real and\nsemantically similar images for which the VLM hallucinates an object. We apply\nDASH to PaliGemma and two LLaVA-NeXT models across 380 object classes and, in\ntotal, find more than 19k clusters with 950k images. We study the transfer of\nthe identified systematic hallucinations to other VLMs and show that\nfine-tuning PaliGemma with the model-specific images obtained with DASH\nmitigates object hallucinations.

    "abstract": "This paper considers smooth convex optimization problems with many functional\nconstraints. To solve this general class of problems we propose a new\nstochastic perturbed augmented Lagrangian method, called SGDPA, where a\nperturbation is introduced in the augmented Lagrangian function by multiplying\nthe dual variables with a subunitary parameter. Essentially, we linearize the\nobjective and one randomly chosen functional constraint within the perturbed\naugmented Lagrangian at the current iterate and add a quadratic regularization\nthat leads to a stochastic gradient descent update for the primal variables,\nfollowed by a perturbed random coordinate ascent step to update the dual\nvariables. We provide a convergence analysis in both optimality and feasibility\ncriteria for the iterates of SGDPA algorithm using basic assumptions on the\nproblem. In particular, when the dual updates are assumed to be bounded, we\nprove sublinear rates of convergence for the iterates of algorithm SGDPA of\norder $\\mathcal{O} (k^{-1/2})$ when the objective is convex and of order\n$\\mathcal{O} (k^{-1})$ when the objective is strongly convex, where $k$ is the\niteration counter. Under some additional assumptions, we prove that the dual\niterates are bounded and in this case we obtain convergence rates of order\n$\\mathcal{O} (k^{-1/4})$ and $\\mathcal{O} (k^{-1/2})$ when the objective is\nconvex and strongly convex, respectively.

    "abstract": "We present the Quantum Memory Matrix (QMM) hypothesis, which addresses the\nlongstanding Black Hole Information Paradox rooted in the apparent conflict\nbetween Quantum Mechanics (QM) and General Relativity (GR). This paradox raises\nthe question of how information is preserved during black hole formation and\nevaporation, given that Hawking radiation appears to result in information\nloss, challenging unitarity in quantum mechanics. The QMM hypothesis proposes\nthat space-time itself acts as a dynamic quantum information reservoir, with\nquantum imprints encoding information about quantum states and interactions\ndirectly into the fabric of space-time at the Planck scale. By defining a\nquantized model of space-time and mechanisms for information encoding and\nretrieval, QMM aims to conserve information in a manner consistent with\nunitarity during black hole processes. We develop a mathematical framework that\nincludes space-time quantization, definitions of quantum imprints, and\ninteractions that modify quantum state evolution within this structure.\nExplicit expressions for the interaction Hamiltonians are provided,\ndemonstrating unitarity preservation in the combined system of quantum fields\nand the QMM. This hypothesis is compared with existing theories, including the\nholographic principle, black hole complementarity, and loop quantum gravity,\nnoting its distinctions and examining its limitations. Finally, we discuss\nobservable implications of QMM, suggesting pathways for experimental\nevaluation, such as potential deviations from thermality in Hawking radiation\nand their effects on gravitational wave signals. The QMM hypothesis aims to\nprovide a pathway towards resolving the Black Hole Information Paradox while\ncontributing to broader discussions in quantum gravity and cosmology.",

Through an analysis of the energy budget at maximum spreading, we\nidentify a characteristic shear rate that governs the viscous dissipation\nduring drop impact.

    "abstract": "Collective cell migration plays a crucial role in numerous biological\nprocesses, including tumour growth, wound healing, and the immune response.\nOften, the migrating population consists of cells with various different\nphenotypes. This study derives a general mathematical framework for modelling\ncell migration in the local environment, which is coarse-grained from an\nunderlying individual-based model that captures the dynamics of cell migration\nthat are influenced by the phenotype of the cell, such as random movement,\nproliferation, phenotypic transitions, and interactions with the local\nenvironment. The resulting, flexible, and general model provides a continuum,\nmacroscopic description of cell invasion, which represents the phenotype of the\ncell as a continuous variable and is much more amenable to simulation and\nanalysis than its individual-based counterpart when considering a large number\nof phenotypes. We showcase the utility of the generalised framework in three\nbiological scenarios: range expansion; cell invasion into the extracellular\nmatrix; and T cell exhaustion. The results highlight how phenotypic structuring\nimpacts the spatial and temporal dynamics of cell populations, demonstrating\nthat different environmental pressures and phenotypic transition mechanisms\nsignificantly influence migration patterns, a phenomenon that would be\ncomputationally very expensive to explore using an individual-based model\nalone. This framework provides a versatile and robust tool for understanding\nthe role of phenotypic heterogeneity in collective cell migration, with\npotential applications in optimising therapeutic strategies for diseases\ninvolving cell migration.",

Solar cycle (SC) 25,\nwhich is a bit stronger than SC 24 observed only a handful of SGRE events over\nthe first five years. Here we report on the 2024 September 14 SGRE event, which\nhas the longest duration (\\~11.29 hrs) as of this writing. The associated type\nII radio burst is also of long duration (\\~16 hr). Detailed analysis of the\nSGRE event reveals that the event is in good agreement with the linear relation\nof the SGRE duration with the ending frequency and duration of the type II\nburst. The kinematics of the associated coronal mass ejection (CME) shows that\nit is one of the fastest CMEs of SC 25, capable of driving a shock that\naccelerated >300 MeV protons to account for the observed SGRE. By comparing\nwith an event with similar durations in SC 24, we find that it had a\nlower-speed CME but resulted in a larger-sized SGRE event. We speculate that\nthe difference may be due to the change in the heliospheric state between the\ntwo cycles.",

    "abstract": "Automatic speech recognition systems have undoubtedly advanced with the\nintegration of multilingual and multitask models such as Whisper, which have\nshown a promising ability to understand and process speech across a wide range\nof languages. Despite their robustness, these models often fall short in\nhandling the linguistic distinctions of minority languages. This study\naddresses this gap by integrating traditional and novel language models with\nfine-tuned Whisper models to raise their performance in less commonly studied\nlanguages. Through rigorous fine-tuning and evaluation across multiple\ndatasets, we demonstrate substantial improvements in word error rate,\nparticularly in low-resource scenarios. Our approach not only does take\nadvantage of the extensive data Whisper was pre-trained on, but also\ncomplements its linguistic adaptability by incorporating language models. We\nobtained improvements up to 51% for in-distribution datasets and up to 34% for\nout-of-distribution sentences using statistical language models, while large\nlanguage models provided moderate but consistently robust improvement across\ndiverse linguistic contexts. The findings reveal that, while the integration\nreliably benefits all model sizes, the extent of improvement varies,\nhighlighting the importance of optimized language model parameters. Finally, we\nemphasize the importance of selecting appropriate evaluation parameters when\nreporting the results using transformer-based ASR models. In summary, this\nresearch clears the way for more inclusive ASR technologies that perform better\nacross languages by enriching their linguistic knowledge.

This structure reflects the assumption of independent and\nidentically distributed (i.i.d.) uncertainty components and yields a non-convex\nambiguity set that is strictly contained in its unstructured counterpart,\nthereby reducing conservatism. The resulting optimization problem is generally\nintractable due to the loss of convexity.

Moreover, some helium-rich hot subdwarfs display extraordinarily high\nabundances of heavy elements such as Zr, Yr and Pb on their surfaces. We\nexplore under which conditions neutron-capture processes can occur in late\nhelium core flashes, i.e. those occurring in the cores of stripped red-giant\nstars.\n  We compute evolutionary models through the helium core flash and the\nsubsequent hydrogen ingestion episode in stripped red giant stars.

We find that for metallicities of\n$10^{-3}$ and below, neutron densities can be as high as $10^{15}\\,$cm$^{-3}$\nand intermediate neutron capture processes occur in some of our models. The\nresults depend very strongly on the H-envelope mass that survives after the\nstripping.

The agreement between the observed abundances in EC 22536-5304 and those\nof our models offers support to our nucleosynthesis calculations. Moreover, if\nconfirmed, the idea that heavy element abundances retain signatures of the\ndifferent evolutionary channels opens the possibility that heavy element\nabundances in iHe-sdOB stars can be used to infer their evolutionary origin.",

    "abstract": "Waveforms with ideal ambiguity functions are fundamental to integrated\nsensing and communication, to active sensing (radar), and to uplink multiple\naccess. We describe a general method of constructing waveforms using the\ndiscrete Zak transform (DZT) to convert sequences of length $MN$ in the time\ndomain to waveforms in the delay-Doppler (DD) domain, each of which is defined\nby an $M\\times N$ quasi-periodic array. The DZT preserves inner products, and\nwe show that phase coded waveforms used in radar (CAZAC sequences) determine\nnoise-like waveforms in the DD domain, each with low Peak to Average Power\nRatio. In a Zak-OTFS communication system, we show that these waveforms are\nmutually unbiased with respect to every carrier and use them to integrate\nsensing and communication as spread pilots. We view each waveform as a linear\ncombination of Zak-OTFS carriers and show that the self-ambiguity function is\nsupported on a discrete line in the integers modulo $MN$. The sidelobes are\nsignificantly lower than the original CAZAC sequence, and the advantage of\ndiscrete support is better localization/resolution in delay and Doppler\ncompared with standard methods based on chirps or tones. We show that the\nabsolute value of the cross-ambiguity function for pairs of waveforms in the\nsame family is small and constant. This property makes the waveforms ideal\npreambles in the 2-step RACH protocol introduced in Release 15, 3GPP to enable\ngrant-free multiple access. The characteristics of the cross-ambiguity function\nmake it possible to simultaneously detect multiple preambles in the presence of\nmobility and delay spread.",

    "abstract": "Context: Photometric variability is a defining characteristic of young\nstellar objects (YSO), which can be traced back to a range of physical\nprocesses taking place at different stages of young stars' formation and early\nevolution. Gaia's third Data Release (GDR3) has provided an unprecedented\ndataset of photometric time series, including 79375 light curves for YSO\ncandidates. With its all-sky coverage, Gaia provides a unique opportunity for\nlarge-scale studies of YSO variability. Aims: Our goal was to characterise the\nGDR3 sample of YSO variables further and verify the recurrence of YSO\nvariability modes due to accretion, extinction, rotation modulation, etc. By\nadapting the Q&M methodology for Gaia's sparse and long-term light curves, we\nseek to bridge the gap between low and high-cadence surveys' insights on YSO\nvariability. Methods: We piloted the application of the asymmetry (M) and\nperiodicity (Q) variability metrics to characterise YSO variability with Gaia\nlight curves. Through refined sample selection, we identified sources with\nappropriate sampling for the Q&M methodology. We used the Generalised Lomb\nScargle periodogram and structure functions to infer variability timescales.\nResults: We successfully derived Q&M indices for ~23000 sources in the GDR3 YSO\nsample. These variables were then classified into eight variability\nmorphological classes. We linked morphological classes with physical mechanisms\nby using H$\\alpha$ as a proxy of accretion and $\\alpha_\\mathrm{IR}$-indices to\ngauge circumstellar material's presence. Conclusions: We demonstrate that the\nQ&M metrics can be successfully applied to Gaia's sparse time-series. We\napplied them to distinguish between the several variability modes. While our\nresults are generally consistent with previous high-cadence, short-term\nstudies, we find that GDR3's long timespan yields an enhanced variety of\nvariability mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA) aims to adapt a pre-trained source model\nto a target dataset from a different domain without access to the source data.\nConventional SFDA methods are limited by the information encoded in the\npre-trained source model and the unlabeled target data. Recently, approaches\nleveraging auxiliary resources have emerged, yet remain in their early stages,\noffering ample opportunities for research. In this work, we propose a novel\nmethod that incorporates auxiliary information by extending an existing SFDA\nframework using Vision-and-Language (ViL) models. Specifically, we build upon\nAttracting and Dispersing (AaD), a widely adopted SFDA technique, and\ngeneralize its core principle to naturally integrate ViL models as a powerful\ninitialization for target adaptation. Our approach, called ViL-enhanced AaD\n(ViLAaD), preserves the simplicity and flexibility of the AaD framework, while\nleveraging ViL models to significantly boost adaptation performance. We\nvalidate our method through experiments using various ViL models, demonstrating\nthat ViLAaD consistently outperforms both AaD and zero-shot classification by\nViL models, especially when both the source model and ViL model provide strong\ninitializations. Moreover, the flexibility of ViLAaD allows it to be seamlessly\nincorporated into an alternating optimization framework with ViL prompt tuning\nand extended with additional objectives for target model adaptation. Extensive\nexperiments on four SFDA benchmarks show that this enhanced version, ViLAaD++,\nachieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple SFDA scenarios, including\nClosed-set SFDA, Partial-set SFDA, and Open-set SFDA.",

    "abstract": "The major advantage of proton therapy over conventional radiotherapy is the\ndose deposition pattern, enabling precise coverage of the tumour volume while\nsparing nearby healthy tissues. However, accurate control of the proton beam\nrange online during patient irradiation is still considered a challenge. Thus,\nthere are extensive efforts to develop a detector capable of in vivo beam range\nmonitoring for proton therapy, among them, the coded-mask gamma camera\ndeveloped by the SiFi-CC group. The assembly of this detector, as well as its\nfirst test under clinical conditions, are the subject of this thesis. The\ndetector consists of a tungsten collimator and a stack of thin scintillation\nfibres, read out at both ends by SiPMs. Such a design allows for efficient\ndetection of prompt gammas (PG) and reconstruction of a PG depth profile, which\nis strongly correlated with the proton beam range. The readout system was\nselected in an extensive comparison study of five different systems. After\nassembly, the detector was tested under clinical conditions: a phantom was\nirradiated with proton beams of energies from 70.51 MeV to 108.15 MeV, the\ndetector response was processed with low-level reconstruction software, and the\nMLEM algorithm was applied to reconstruct the PG depth profiles (images). The\ndistal falloff positions of these profiles were determined and compared with\nthe calculated proton ranges. The image reconstruction parameters were\noptimised in terms of accuracy of proton range shift determination. The results\nobtained were checked against a Geant4 simulation, showing good consistency.\nThe statistical precision was found to be 1.7 mm for $10^8$ protons. The result\nis comparable to similar systems investigated by other research groups.\nHowever, simulation results suggest that certain hardware amendments to the\ndetector can increase that precision about four times.",

In a classic\nresult, Karger (1995) obtained the first FPTAS for this problem by leveraging\nthe fact that when a graph disconnects, it almost always does so at a\nnear-minimum cut, and there are only a small (polynomial) number of\nnear-minimum cuts.

Complete\nconstructions of atomic environment descriptors, on the other hand, often\nsuffer from a high degree of functional dependence, where some descriptors can\nbe written as functions of the others.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) can carry out human-like dialogue, but unlike\nhumans, they are stateless due to the superposition property. However, during\nmulti-turn, multi-agent interactions, LLMs begin to exhibit consistent,\ncharacter-like behaviors, hinting at a form of emergent lifelong learning.\nDespite this, existing benchmarks often fail to capture these dynamics,\nprimarily focusing on static, open-ended evaluations. To address this gap, we\nintroduce LIFESTATE-BENCH, a benchmark designed to assess lifelong learning in\nLLMs. It features two episodic datasets: Hamlet and a synthetic script\ncollection, rich in narrative structure and character interactions. Our fact\nchecking evaluation probes models' self-awareness, episodic memory retrieval,\nand relationship tracking, across both parametric and non-parametric\napproaches. Experiments on models like Llama3.1-8B, GPT-4-turbo, and DeepSeek\nR1, we demonstrate that nonparametric methods significantly outperform\nparametric ones in managing stateful learning. However, all models exhibit\nchallenges with catastrophic forgetting as interactions extend, highlighting\nthe need for further advancements in lifelong learning.",

    "abstract": "Domain-specific intelligence demands specialized knowledge and sophisticated\nreasoning for problem-solving, posing significant challenges for large language\nmodels (LLMs) that struggle with knowledge hallucination and inadequate\nreasoning capabilities under constrained parameter budgets. Inspired by Bloom's\nTaxonomy in educational theory, we propose Retrieval-Augmented Reasoning\nModeling (RARE), a novel paradigm that decouples knowledge storage from\nreasoning optimization. RARE externalizes domain knowledge to retrievable\nsources and internalizes domain-specific reasoning patterns during training.\nSpecifically, by injecting retrieved knowledge into training prompts with\nmasked losses, RARE transforms learning objectives from rote memorization to\ncontextualized reasoning. It enables models to bypass parameter-intensive\nmemorization and prioritize the development of higher-order cognitive\nprocesses. Extensive experiments demonstrate that lightweight RARE-trained\nmodels (e.g., Llama-3.1-8B) could achieve state-of-the-art performance,\nsurpassing retrieval-augmented GPT-4 and DeepSeek-R1 up to approximately 20\\%\naccuracy.

To address this gap, we\ninvestigate the transaction characteristics, (un)intended usages, and monetary\nimpacts by analyzing large-scale datasets comprising 14,810,392 private\ntransactions within a 15.5-month PoW dataset and 30,062,232 private\ntransactions within a 15.5-month PoS dataset.

Additionally, in PoS\nEthereum, there is a subtle uptick in the role of private transactions for MEV\nextraction. This shift could be attributed to the decrease in transaction\ncosts.

During the training process, recent studies leverage\nvision-language models (VLMs) to automatically generate human-like expressions\nfor visual objects, facilitating training data scaling up. In this process, we\nobserve that VLM hallucinations bring inaccurate object descriptions (e.g.,\nobject name, color, and shape) to deteriorate VL alignment quality. To reduce\nVLM hallucinations, we propose an agentic workflow controlled by an LLM to\nre-align language to visual objects via adaptively adjusting image and text\nprompts. We name this workflow Real-LOD, which includes planning, tool use, and\nreflection steps. Given an image with detected objects and VLM raw language\nexpressions, Real-LOD reasons its state automatically and arranges action based\non our neural symbolic designs (i.e., planning). The action will adaptively\nadjust the image and text prompts and send them to VLMs for object\nre-description (i.e., tool use). Then, we use another LLM to analyze these\nrefined expressions for feedback (i.e., reflection). These steps are conducted\nin a cyclic form to gradually improve language descriptions for re-aligning to\nvisual objects. We construct a dataset that contains a tiny amount of 0.18M\nimages with re-aligned language expression and train a prevalent LOD model to\nsurpass existing LOD methods by around 50% on the standard benchmarks.

Here, we present the first\nempirical evidence that DNA sequences exhibit core linguistic features,\nspecifically, functional and information redundancy, through comprehensive\nanalysis of genomic and epigenetic datasets. By mapping DNA sequences into a\nlinguistic feature space, we demonstrate that fixed-length (41 bp) DNA segments\nencode information analogously to human language, with redundancy contributing\nto signal stability in aqueous intracellular environments. Moreover, we provide\nthe first evidence of one-dimensional epigenetic memory, showing that linear\nDNA sequences can maintain epigenetic marks such as 6mA methylation,\ncontrasting with models focusing on epigenetic memory transmission via 3D\nchromatin organization[1]. Our tailored linguistic mapping strategy also\naddresses persistent challenges in genomic data processing, significantly\nimproving data cleaning and feature extraction.

    "abstract": "This research introduces a novel extension, called the Extended\nKolmogorov-Zurbenko Fourier Transform (EKZFT), to an existing class of\nband-pass filters first introduced by Kolmogorov and Zurbenko. Their original\nKolmogorov-Zurbenko Fourier Transform (KZFT) is a useful tool in time series\nand spatio-temporal analysis, Fourier analysis, and related statistical\nanalysis fields. Example uses of these filters include separating frequencies,\nfiltering portions of the spectra, reconstructing seasonality, investigating\nperiodic signals, and reducing noise. KZFT filters have many practical\napplications across a wide range of disciplines including health, social,\nnatural, and physical sciences. KZFT filters are band-pass filters defined by\nthree arguments: the length of the filter window; the number of iterations; and\nthe central frequency of the band-pass filter. However, the KZFT filter is\nlimited in design to only positive odd integer widow lengths inherited from the\ntime series. Therefore, for any combination of the other KZFT filter arguments,\nthere is only a relatively small, discrete, selection of possible filter window\nlengths in a range determined by the size of the dataset. This limits the\nutility of KZFT filters for many of the stated uses. The proposed EKZFT filter\nallows a continuous selection of filter window length arguments over the same\nrange, offering improved control, increased functionality, and wider practical\nuse of this band-pass filter. An example application of the EKZFT in a data\nsimulation is provided.",

Based on this finding, we propose a new idea of\nleveraging clean training to further improve the performance of advanced AT\nmethods.We reveal that the problem of generalization degradation faced by AT\npartly stems from the difficulty of adversarial training in learning certain\nsample features, and this problem can be alleviated by making full use of clean\ntraining.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have been found to struggle with systematic\nreasoning. Even on tasks where they appear to perform well, their performance\noften depends on shortcuts, rather than on genuine reasoning abilities, leading\nthem to collapse on out-of-distribution (OOD) examples. Post-training\nstrategies based on reinforcement learning and chain-of-thought prompting have\nrecently been hailed as a step change. However, little is known about the\npotential of the resulting ``Large Reasoning Models'' (LRMs) beyond maths and\nprogramming-based problem solving, where genuine OOD problems can be sparse. In\nthis paper, we focus on tasks that require systematic relational composition\nfor qualitative spatial and temporal reasoning. The setting allows fine control\nover problem difficulty to precisely measure OOD generalization. We find that,\nzero-shot LRMs generally outperform their LLM counterparts in single-path\nreasoning tasks but struggle in the multi-path setting. Whilst showing\ncomparatively better results, fine-tuned LLMs are also not capable of\nmulti-path generalization. We also provide evidence for the behavioral\ninterpretation for this, i.e., that LRMs are shallow disjunctive reasoners.",

Task completion\ntime, hand trajectory distance, and the percentage of hand trajectory in a\ncritical area were measured as performance outcomes, along with subjective\nfeedback.

In indoor environments,\ntraditional Monte Carlo localization based on occupancy grid maps is considered\nthe gold standard, but its accuracy is limited by the representation\ncapabilities of the occupancy grid map. In this paper, we address the problem\nof building an effective map representation that allows to accurately perform\nprobabilistic global localization. To this end, we propose an implicit neural\nmap representation that is able to capture positional and directional geometric\nfeatures from 2D LiDAR scans to efficiently represent the environment and learn\na neural network that is able to predict both, the non-projective signed\ndistance and a direction-aware projective distance for an arbitrary point in\nthe mapped environment. This combination of neural map representation with a\nlight-weight neural network allows us to design an efficient observation model\nwithin a conventional Monte Carlo localization framework for pose estimation of\na robot in real time. We evaluated our approach to indoor localization on a\npublicly available dataset for global localization and the experimental results\nindicate that our approach is able to more accurately localize a mobile robot\nthan other localization approaches employing occupancy or existing neural map\nrepresentations. In contrast to other approaches employing an implicit neural\nmap representation for 2D LiDAR localization, our approach allows to perform\nreal-time pose tracking after convergence and near real-time global\nlocalization.

Second, the environment may change while the network is\nstill computing an action, leading to observational delay. The first issue can\npartly be addressed with pipelining, leading to higher throughput and\npotentially better policies. However, the second issue remains: if each neuron\noperates in parallel with an execution time of $\\tau$, an $N$-layer\nfeed-forward network experiences observation delay of $\\tau N$. Reducing the\nnumber of layers can decrease this delay, but at the cost of the network's\nexpressivity. In this work, we explore the trade-off between minimizing delay\nand network's expressivity. We present a theoretically motivated solution that\nleverages temporal skip connections combined with history-augmented\nobservations. We evaluate several architectures and show that those\nincorporating temporal skip connections achieve strong performance across\nvarious neuron execution times, reinforcement learning algorithms, and\nenvironments, including four Mujoco tasks and all MinAtar games.

    "abstract": "We investigate universal signatures of quantum chaos in the presence of time\nreversal symmetry (TRS) in generic many body quantum chaotic systems (gMBQCs).\nWe study three classes of minimal models of gMBQCs with TRS, realized through\nrandom quantum circuits with (i) local TRS, (ii) global TRS, and (iii) TRS\ncombined with discrete time-translation symmetry. In large local Hilbert space\ndimension $q$, we derive the emergence of random matrix theory (RMT)\nuniversality in the spectral form factor (SFF) at times larger than the\nThouless time $t_{\\mathrm{Th}}$, which diverges with system sizes in gMBQCs. At\ntimes before $t_{\\mathrm{Th}}$, we identify universal behaviour beyond RMT by\nderiving explicit scaling functions of SFF in the thermodynamic limit. In\nparticular, in the simplest non-trivial setting - preserving global TRS while\nbreaking time translation symmetry - we show that the SFF is mapped to the\npartition function of an emergent classical ferromagnetic Ising model, where\nthe Ising spins correspond to the time-parallel and time-reversed pairings of\nFeynman paths, and external magnetic fields are induced by TRS-breaking\nmechanisms. Without relying on the large-$q$ limit, we develop a second\nindependent derivation of the Ising scaling behaviour of SFF using space-time\nduality and parity symmetric non-Hermitian Ginibre ensembles. Moreover, we show\nthat many body effects originating from time-reversed pairings of Feynman paths\nmanifest in the two-point autocorrelation function (2PAF), the\nout-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC), and the partial spectral form factor -\nquantities sensitive to both eigenvalue and eigenstate correlations. We\nestablish that the fluctuations of 2PAF are governed by an emergent three-state\nPotts model, leading to an exponential scaling with the operator support size,\nat a rate set by the three-state Potts model.

    "abstract": "Controlling laser-induced pattern formation remains a long-standing\nchallenge. A key advance was recognising the pivotal role of intrinsic feedback\nmechanisms in self-organisation, which enabled self-similar patterns with\nlong-range order through nonlinear laser lithography. This concept was recently\nleveraged to surpass the diffraction limit. However, demonstrated structures in\nlaser-induced pattern formation have been relatively simple and\nmaterial-specific, as they rely on a single assumed formation mechanism for\neach material. Here, we reveal the coexistence of competing feedback mechanisms\nthat drive distinct chemical and ablative processes, resulting in patterns with\ndifferent symmetries. We show that one mechanism can be selectively activated,\nwhile completely suppressing the other, by tuning the laser parameters\nindependently of the material. The competing mechanisms break surface\nsymmetries in distinct lateral and vertical directions, and the selection can\nbe dynamically inverted in situ, leading to rich surface chemistries and\nmorphologies. We demonstrate the potential for applications through the\nmaskless and ambient-air fabrication of complex composite patterns on diverse\nmaterials and substrates. These include seamlessly stitched superhydrophilic\nand superhydrophobic domains, structural colour, and a holographic temperature\nsensor. Combining programmable mechanism selection with recent demonstrations\nof sub-10 nm features could enable the maskless fabrication of composite\nstructures that rival the capabilities of nanofabrication techniques.",

To bridge this gap, we present VacHopPy an open-source Python\npackage for vacancy hopping analysis based on ab initio molecular dynamics\n(AIMD). VacHopPy extracts an effective set of parameters for vacancy hopping:\nhopping distance, hopping barrier, number of effective paths, correlation\nfactor, and jump attempt frequency, by statistically integrating thermodynamic,\nkinetic, and geometric contributions across all hopping paths. It also offers\ntools for tracking vacancy trajectories and for detecting phase transitions in\nAIMD simulations. The applicability of VacHopPy is demonstrated in three\nmaterials: face-centered cubic Al, rutile TiO2, and monoclinic HfO2. The\neffective parameters accurately reflect temperature-dependent diffusion\nbehavior and show good agreement with previous experimental observations.\nExpressed in a simplified form suitable for device models, these parameters\nremain valid across a broad temperature range spanning several hundred Kelvins.\nFurthermore, our findings highlight the critical role of anisotropic thermal\nvibrations in overall diffusion, a factor frequently overlooked in other\nframeworks but inherently considered in VacHopPy.

    "abstract": "We propose Cross-Attention in Audio, Space, and Time (CA^2ST), a\ntransformer-based method for holistic video recognition. Recognizing actions in\nvideos requires both spatial and temporal understanding, yet most existing\nmodels lack a balanced spatio-temporal understanding of videos. To address\nthis, we propose a novel two-stream architecture, called Cross-Attention in\nSpace and Time (CAST), using only RGB input. In each layer of CAST, Bottleneck\nCross-Attention (B-CA) enables spatial and temporal experts to exchange\ninformation and make synergistic predictions. For holistic video understanding,\nwe extend CAST by integrating an audio expert, forming Cross-Attention in\nVisual and Audio (CAVA). We validate the CAST on benchmarks with different\ncharacteristics, EPIC-KITCHENS-100, Something-Something-V2, and Kinetics-400,\nconsistently showing balanced performance. We also validate the CAVA on\naudio-visual action recognition benchmarks, including UCF-101, VGG-Sound,\nKineticsSound, and EPIC-SOUNDS. With a favorable performance of CAVA across\nthese datasets, we demonstrate the effective information exchange among\nmultiple experts within the B-CA module. In summary, CA^2ST combines CAST and\nCAVA by employing spatial, temporal, and audio experts through cross-attention,\nachieving balanced and holistic video understanding.",

Risks are not\nonly a product of technology or the emergence of artificial intelligence.\nEthical problems arise in a hybrid society, where the adaptation of human\nbehavior to human-machine interaction (HMI), and the ethical, social, and legal\nways of regulating them have yet to be learned.

Sharpness-Aware\nMinimization (SAM), known for finding flat minima that improve generalization,\nhas therefore been widely adopted in DG. However, our analysis reveals that SAM\nin DG may converge to \\textit{fake flat minima}, where the total loss surface\nappears flat in terms of global sharpness but remains sharp with respect to\nindividual source domains. To understand this phenomenon more precisely, we\nformalize the average worst-case domain risk as the maximum loss under domain\ndistribution shifts within a bounded divergence, and derive a generalization\nbound that reveals the limitations of global sharpness-aware minimization. In\ncontrast, we show that individual sharpness provides a valid upper bound on\nthis risk, making it a more suitable proxy for robust domain generalization.\nMotivated by these insights, we shift the DG paradigm toward minimizing\nindividual sharpness across source domains. We propose\n\\textit{Decreased-overhead Gradual SAM (DGSAM)}, which applies gradual\ndomain-wise perturbations in a computationally efficient manner to consistently\nreduce individual sharpness.

Subsequently, a robust and\nself-adaptive bundle adjustment residual is proposed considering the minimum\nprojection error prior for dynamic candidate landmarks. This residual is\nintegrated into a sliding window based nonlinear optimization process to\nestimate camera poses, IMU states and landmark positions while minimizing the\nimpact of dynamic candidate landmarks that deviate from the motion prior.\nFinally, a clean point cloud map without `ghosting effect' is obtained that\ncontains only static landmarks.

In this research, we\ndemonstrate how machine learning can be leveraged to enhance explainability and\nuncover biologically meaningful associations, even when predictive improvements\nin disease modeling are limited. We train LightGBM models from scratch on our\ndataset (10K) to impute metabolomics features and apply them to the UK Biobank\n(UKBB) for downstream analysis. The imputed metabolomics features are then used\nin survival analysis to assess their impact on disease-related risk factors. As\na result, our approach successfully identified biologically relevant\nconnections that were not previously known to the predictive models.\nAdditionally, we applied a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on key\nmetabolomics features, revealing a link between vascular dementia and smoking.\nAlthough being a well-established epidemiological relationship, this link was\nnot embedded in the model's training data, which validated the method's ability\nto extract meaningful signals. Furthermore, by integrating survival models as\ninputs in the 10K data, we uncovered associations between metabolic substances\nand obesity, demonstrating the ability to infer disease risk for future\npatients without requiring direct outcome labels. These findings highlight the\npotential of leveraging external bio-banks to extract valuable biomedical\ninsights, even in data-limited scenarios.

In this paper, we propose\n\\textbf{CoRanking}, a novel collaborative ranking framework that combines small\nand large ranking models for efficient and effective ranking. CoRanking first\nemploys a small-size reranker to pre-rank all the candidate passages, bringing\nrelevant ones to the top part of the list (\\eg, top-20). Then, the LLM listwise\nreranker is applied to only rerank these top-ranked passages instead of the\nwhole list, substantially enhancing overall ranking efficiency. Although more\nefficient, previous studies have revealed that the LLM listwise reranker have\nsignificant positional biases on the order of input passages. Directly feed the\ntop-ranked passages from small reranker may result in the sub-optimal\nperformance of LLM listwise reranker. To alleviate this problem, we introduce a\npassage order adjuster trained via reinforcement learning, which reorders the\ntop passages from the small reranker to align with the LLM's preferences of\npassage order. Extensive experiments on three IR benchmarks demonstrate that\nCoRanking significantly improves efficiency (reducing ranking latency by about\n70\\%) while achieving even better effectiveness compared to using only the LLM\nlistwise reranker.",

To tackle this issue, we present UnderWater SegFormer\n(UWSegFormer), a transformer-based framework for semantic segmentation of\nlow-quality underwater images. Firstly, we propose the Underwater Image Quality\nAttention (UIQA) module. This module enhances the representation of highquality\nsemantic information in underwater image feature channels through a channel\nself-attention mechanism. In order to address the issue of loss of imaging\ndetails due to the underwater environment, the Multi-scale Aggregation\nAttention(MAA) module is proposed. This module aggregates sets of semantic\nfeatures at different scales by extracting discriminative information from\nhigh-level features,thus compensating for the semantic loss of detail in\nunderwater objects. Finally, during training, we introduce Edge Learning Loss\n(ELL) in order to enhance the model's learning of underwater object edges and\nimprove the model's prediction accuracy.

    "abstract": "The spokes observed in Saturn's rings have been a subject of scientific\ndebate since their discovery by Stephen J. O'Meara in the 1970s and their\nconfirmation by the Voyager flybys in the early 1980s (Smith et al., 1982).\nWhile the Cassini spacecraft confirmed that the spokes are linked to Saturn's\nmagnetosphere, their exact formation mechanism remains uncertain. This paper\nproposes that the spokes in Saturn's rings consist of two distinct components:\n(1) carbonaceous materials, namely pyrolytic carbon with diamagnetic properties\nand potentially other various forms of carbon-bearing compounds, which persist\nover longer timescales, and (2) rapidly forming and dissipating diamagnetic ice\ngrains, which interact with Saturn's magnetosphere on much shorter timescales.\nWe suggest that the spokes consist of diamagnetic pyrolytic carbon that has\ncoated silicates through the process of high-temperature Chemical Vapour\nDeposition (CVD) during the formation of Saturn's protoplanetary disk.\nAdditionally, the spokes consist of diamagnetic ice particles that can\ndisappear within minutes to hours due to sublimation. The photoelectric effect\ncauses the pyrolytic carbon grains to lose electrons, thus becoming\nparamagnetic, which results in their attraction back to the main B ring\nstructure. We suggest that Saturn's rings are charged by the solar wind,\ngenerating a magnetic field that emanates orthogonally above and below the B\nring plane due to the movement of charged particles in the rings. Statistical\nanalysis of Cassini data reveals significant correlations between spoke\nactivity and both Saturn's magnetospheric rotation and solar elevation angle,\nproviding strong support for an electromagnetic mechanism in spoke formation.\nThis hypothesis suggests that the visibility of the spokes is dictated by\nillumination conditions and electromagnetic effects.",

Although\nmany design methods for distributed and decentralized control systems are\navailable, most of them rely on a centralized design procedure requiring some\nform of global information of the whole system. Clearly, beyond a certain scale\nof the network, these centralized design procedures for distributed controllers\nare no longer feasible and we refer to the corresponding systems as ultra\nlarge-scale systems (ULSS).

BDPT constructs the full path by connecting sub-paths traced\nindividually from the light source and camera. However, it remains difficult to\nsample by connecting vertices on specular and glossy surfaces with narrow-lobed\nBSDF, as it poses severe constraints on sampling in the feasible direction. To\naddress this issue, we propose a novel approach, called \\emph{proxy sampling},\nthat enables efficient sub-path connection of these challenging paths. When a\nlow-contribution specular/glossy connection occurs, we drop out the problematic\nneighboring vertex next to this specular/glossy vertex from the original path,\nthen retrace an alternative sub-path as a proxy to complement this incomplete\npath. This newly constructed complete path ensures that the connection adheres\nto the constraint of the narrow lobe within the BSDF of the specular/glossy\nsurface. Unbiased reciprocal estimation is the key to our method to obtain a\nprobability density function (PDF) reciprocal to ensure unbiased rendering. We\nderive the reciprocal estimation method and provide an efficiency-optimized\nsetting for efficient sampling and connection. Our method provides a robust\ntool for substituting problematic paths with favorable alternatives while\nensuring unbiasedness.

    "abstract": "In the Max-Cut problem in the streaming model, an algorithm is given the\nedges of an unknown graph $G = (V,E)$ in some fixed order, and its goal is to\napproximate the size of the largest cut in $G$. Improving upon an earlier\nresult of Kapralov, Khanna and Sudan, it was shown by Kapralov and Krachun that\nfor all $\\varepsilon>0$, no $o(n)$ memory streaming algorithm can achieve a\n$(1/2+\\varepsilon)$-approximation for Max-Cut. Their result holds for\nsingle-pass streams, i.e.~the setting in which the algorithm only views the\nstream once, and it was open whether multi-pass access may help. The\nstate-of-the-art result along these lines, due to Assadi and N, rules out\narbitrarily good approximation algorithms with constantly many passes and\n$n^{1-\\delta}$ space for any $\\delta>0$.\n  We improve upon this state-of-the-art result, showing that any non-trivial\napproximation algorithm for Max-Cut requires either polynomially many passes or\npolynomially large space. More specifically, we show that for all\n$\\varepsilon>0$, a $k$-pass streaming $(1/2+\\varepsilon)$-approximation\nalgorithm for Max-Cut requires $\\Omega_{\\varepsilon}\\left(n^{1/3}/k\\right)$\nspace. This result leads to a similar lower bound for the Maximum Directed Cut\nproblem, showing the near optimality of the algorithm of [Saxena, Singer,\nSudan, Velusamy, SODA 2025].\n  Our lower bounds proceed by showing a communication complexity lower bound\nfor the Distributional Implicit Hidden Partition (DIHP) Problem, introduced by\nKapralov and Krachun. While a naive application of the discrepancy method\nfails, we identify a property of protocols called ``globalness'', and show that\n(1) any protocol for DIHP can be turned into a global protocol, (2) the\ndiscrepancy of a global protocol must be small. The second step is the more\ntechnically involved step in the argument, and therein we use global\nhypercontractive inequalities.",

    "abstract": "B$^+$-trees are prevalent in traditional database systems due to their\nversatility and balanced structure. While binary search is typically utilized\nfor branch operations, it may lead to inefficient cache utilization in\nmain-memory scenarios. In contrast, trie-based index structures drive branch\noperations through prefix matching. While these structures generally produce\nfewer cache misses and are thus increasingly popular, they may underperform in\nrange scans because of frequent pointer chasing. This paper proposes a new\nhigh-performance B$^+$-tree variant called \\textbf{Feature B$^+$-tree\n(FB$^+$-tree)}. Similar to employing bit or byte for branch operation in tries,\nFB$^+$-tree progressively considers several bytes following the common prefix\non each level of its inner nodes\\textemdash referred to as features, which\nallows FB$^+$-tree to benefit from prefix skewness. FB$^+$-tree blurs the lines\nbetween B$^+$-trees and tries, while still retaining balance. In the best case,\nFB$^+$-tree almost becomes a trie, whereas in the worst case, it continues to\nfunction as a B$^+$-tree. Meanwhile, a crafted synchronization protocol that\ncombines the link technique and optimistic lock is designed to support\nefficient concurrent index access. Distinctively, FB$^+$-tree leverages subtle\natomic operations seamlessly coordinated with optimistic lock to facilitate\nlatch-free updates, which can be easily extended to other structures. Intensive\nexperiments on multiple workload-dataset combinations demonstrate that\nFB$^+$-tree shows comparable lookup performance to state-of-the-art trie-based\nindexes and outperforms popular B$^+$-trees by 2.3x$\\ \\sim\\ $3.7x under 96\nthreads.

While Audio LLMs excel in tasks such as speech\nrecognition and synthesis, it remains unclear how they perform when faced with\nthe auditory cognitive challenges posed by real-world environments, such as\naudio comprehension and listening recall, particularly in the presence of\nbackground noise or overlapping speech. Unlike text-based LLMs, which have\naccess to vast amounts of text data for pre-training, retraining Audio LLMs\nwith diverse auditory cognitive scenes is difficult due to the limited datasets\nthat simulate real-world auditory cognitive scenarios and the challenge of\nacquiring auditory cognitive labels for training. While test-time compute (TTC)\nmethods have been shown to enhance the capabilities of text-based LLMs during\ninference, a key challenge lies in designing these TTC methods to improve the\nauditory capabilities of Audio LLMs. This study aims to address these two\nresearch gaps by: i) exploring the auditory cognitive capabilities of Audio\nLLMs, and ii) enhancing their capabilities using TTC approaches.

    "abstract": "The technological transition from soft machines to soft robots necessarily\npasses through the integration of soft electronics and sensors. This allows for\nthe establishment of feedback control systems while preserving the softness of\nthe robot embodiment. Multistable mechanical metamaterials are excellent\nbuilding blocks of soft machines, as their nonlinear response can be tuned by\ndesign to accomplish several functions. In this work, we present the\nintegration of soft capacitive sensors in a multistable mechanical\nmetamaterial, to enable proprioceptive sensing of state changes. The\nmetamaterial is a periodic arrangement of 4 bistable unit cells. Each unit cell\nhas an integrated capacitive sensor. Both the metastructure and the sensors are\nmade of soft materials (TPU) and are 3D printed. Our preliminary results show\nthat the capacitance variation of the sensors can be linked to state\ntransitions of the metamaterial, by capturing the nonlinear deformation.",

    "abstract": "Recent vision-language models (VLMs) face significant challenges in test-time\nadaptation to novel domains. While cache-based methods show promise by\nleveraging historical information, they struggle with both caching unreliable\nfeature-label pairs and indiscriminately using single-class information during\nquerying, significantly compromising adaptation accuracy. To address these\nlimitations, we propose COSMIC (Clique-Oriented Semantic Multi-space\nIntegration for CLIP), a robust test-time adaptation framework that enhances\nadaptability through multi-granular, cross-modal semantic caching and\ngraph-based querying mechanisms. Our framework introduces two key innovations:\nDual Semantics Graph (DSG) and Clique Guided Hyper-class (CGH). The Dual\nSemantics Graph constructs complementary semantic spaces by incorporating\ntextual features, coarse-grained CLIP features, and fine-grained DINOv2\nfeatures to capture rich semantic relationships. Building upon these dual\ngraphs, the Clique Guided Hyper-class component leverages structured class\nrelationships to enhance prediction robustness through correlated class\nselection. Extensive experiments demonstrate COSMIC's superior performance\nacross multiple benchmarks, achieving significant improvements over\nstate-of-the-art methods: 15.81% gain on out-of-distribution tasks and 5.33% on\ncross-domain generation with CLIP RN-50.

    "abstract": "Fitness can help to strengthen muscles, increase resistance to diseases, and\nimprove body shape. Nowadays, a great number of people choose to exercise at\nhome/office rather than at the gym due to lack of time. However, it is\ndifficult for them to get good fitness effects without professional guidance.\nMotivated by this, we propose the first personalized fitness monitoring system,\nHearFit+, using smart speakers at home/office. We explore the feasibility of\nusing acoustic sensing to monitor fitness. We design a fitness detection method\nbased on Doppler shift and adopt the short time energy to segment fitness\nactions. Based on deep learning, HearFit+ can perform fitness classification\nand user identification at the same time. Combined with incremental learning,\nusers can easily add new actions. We design 4 evaluation metrics (i.e.,\nduration, intensity, continuity, and smoothness) to help users to improve\nfitness effects. Through extensive experiments including over 9,000 actions of\n10 types of fitness from 12 volunteers, HearFit+ can achieve an average\naccuracy of 96.13% on fitness classification and 91% accuracy for user\nidentification. All volunteers confirm that HearFit+ can help improve the\nfitness effect in various environments.",

    "abstract": "In statistical and nonlinear systems, two qualitatively distinct parameter\nregions are typically identified: the regular region, characterized by smooth\nbehavior of key quantities, and the critical region, where these quantities\nexhibit singularities or strong fluctuations. Due to their starkly different\nproperties, these regions are often perceived as being weakly related, if at\nall. However, we demonstrate that these regions are intimately connected, a\nrelationship that can be explicitly revealed using self-similar approximation\ntheory. This framework enables the prediction of observable quantities near the\ncritical point based on information from the regular region and vice versa.\nRemarkably, the method relies solely on asymptotic expansions with respect to a\nparameter, regardless of whether the expansion originates in the regular or\ncritical region. The mathematical principles of self-similar theory remain\nconsistent across both cases. We illustrate this connection by extrapolating\nfrom the regular region to predict the existence, location, and critical\nindices of a critical point of an equation of state for a statistical system,\neven when no direct information about the critical region is available.\nConversely, we explore extrapolation from the critical to the regular region in\nsystems with discrete scale invariance, where log-periodic oscillations in\nobservables introduce additional complexity.

While recent deep learning-based\nmethods have shown promise in learning motion representations, these methods\ntend to overlook the varying relevance and dependencies between historical\ninformation and future moments, with a stronger correlation for short-term\npredictions and weaker for distant future predictions. This limits the learning\nof motion representation and then hampers prediction performance. In this\npaper, we propose a novel approach called multi-range decoupling decoding with\ngating-adjusting aggregation ($MD2GA$), which leverages the temporal\ncorrelations to refine motion representation learning. This approach employs a\ntwo-stage strategy for HMP. In the first stage, a multi-range decoupling\ndecoding adeptly adjusts feature learning by decoding the shared features into\ndistinct future lengths, where different decoders offer diverse insights into\nmotion patterns. In the second stage, a gating-adjusting aggregation\ndynamically combines the diverse insights guided by input motion data.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can be easily\nintegrated into other motion prediction methods and enhance their prediction\nperformance.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces JavisDiT, a novel Joint Audio-Video Diffusion\nTransformer designed for synchronized audio-video generation (JAVG). Built upon\nthe powerful Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architecture, JavisDiT is able to\ngenerate high-quality audio and video content simultaneously from open-ended\nuser prompts. To ensure optimal synchronization, we introduce a fine-grained\nspatio-temporal alignment mechanism through a Hierarchical Spatial-Temporal\nSynchronized Prior (HiST-Sypo) Estimator. This module extracts both global and\nfine-grained spatio-temporal priors, guiding the synchronization between the\nvisual and auditory components. Furthermore, we propose a new benchmark,\nJavisBench, consisting of 10,140 high-quality text-captioned sounding videos\nspanning diverse scenes and complex real-world scenarios. Further, we\nspecifically devise a robust metric for evaluating the synchronization between\ngenerated audio-video pairs in real-world complex content. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that JavisDiT significantly outperforms existing methods by\nensuring both high-quality generation and precise synchronization, setting a\nnew standard for JAVG tasks. Our code, model, and dataset will be made publicly\navailable at https://javisdit.github.io/.",

    "abstract": "In the forthcoming 6G era, extend reality (XR) has been regarded as an\nemerging application for ultra-reliable and low latency communications (URLLC)\nwith new traffic characteristics and more stringent requirements. In addition\nto the quasi-periodical traffic in XR, burst traffic with both large frame size\nand random arrivals in some real world low latency communication scenarios has\nbecome the leading cause of network congestion or even collapse, and there\nstill lacks an efficient algorithm for the resource scheduling problem under\nburst traffic with hard latency constraints. We propose a novel hybrid\nreinforcement learning framework for resource scheduling with hard latency\nconstraints (HRL-RSHLC), which reuses polices from both old policies learned\nunder other similar environments and domain-knowledge-based (DK) policies\nconstructed using expert knowledge to improve the performance. The joint\noptimization of the policy reuse probabilities and new policy is formulated as\nan Markov Decision Problem (MDP), which maximizes the hard-latency constrained\neffective throughput (HLC-ET) of users.

However, this approach is labor-intensive and the resulting rules\noften lack generalization across diverse scenarios. To overcome these\nlimitations, we introduce RuleAgent, a language agent based framework which\nmimics real-world data experts to autonomously discover rules for\nrecommendation denoising.

To achieve this, RuleAgent is equipped\nwith tailored profile, memory, planning, and action modules and leverages\nreflection mechanisms to enhance its reasoning capabilities for rule discovery.\nFurthermore, to avoid the frequent retraining in rule discovery, we propose\nLossEraser-an unlearning strategy that streamlines training without\ncompromising denoising performance.

However, accurately detecting logical\nfallacies remains a significant challenge. This study presents a novel and\neffective prompt formulation approach for logical fallacy detection, applicable\nin both supervised (fine-tuned) and unsupervised (zero-shot) settings. Our\nmethod enriches input text incorporating implicit contextual information --\ncounterarguments, explanations, and goals -- which we query for validity within\nthe context of the argument. We then rank these queries based on confidence\nscores to inform classification. We evaluate our approach across multiple\ndatasets from 5 domains, covering 29 distinct fallacy types, using models from\nthe GPT and LLaMA series. The results show substantial improvements over\nstate-of-the-art models, with F1 score increases of up to 0.60 in zero-shot\nsettings and up to 0.45 in fine-tuned models.

Understanding LLMs' knowledge deficiencies by\nexhaustively evaluating against full-scale knowledge bases is computationally\nprohibitive, especially for closed-weight models. We propose stochastic error\nascent (SEA), a scalable and efficient framework for discovering knowledge\ndeficiencies (errors) in closed-weight LLMs under a strict query budget. Rather\nthan naively probing all knowledge candidates, SEA formulates error discovery\nas a stochastic optimization process: it iteratively retrieves new high-error\ncandidates by leveraging the semantic similarity to previously observed\nfailures. To further enhance search efficiency and coverage, SEA employs\nhierarchical retrieval across document and paragraph levels, and constructs a\nrelation directed acyclic graph to model error propagation and identify\nsystematic failure modes. Empirically, SEA uncovers 40.7x more knowledge errors\nthan Automated Capability Discovery and 26.7% more than AutoBencher, while\nreducing the cost-per-error by 599x and 9x, respectively.

    "abstract": "Compared to images, videos better align with real-world acquisition scenarios\nand possess valuable temporal cues. However, existing multi-sensor fusion\nresearch predominantly integrates complementary context from multiple images\nrather than videos. This primarily stems from two factors: 1) the scarcity of\nlarge-scale multi-sensor video datasets, limiting research in video fusion, and\n2) the inherent difficulty of jointly modeling spatial and temporal\ndependencies in a unified framework. This paper proactively compensates for the\ndilemmas. First, we construct M3SVD, a benchmark dataset with $220$ temporally\nsynchronized and spatially registered infrared-visible video pairs comprising\n153,797 frames, filling the data gap for the video fusion community. Secondly,\nwe propose VideoFusion, a multi-modal video fusion model that fully exploits\ncross-modal complementarity and temporal dynamics to generate spatio-temporally\ncoherent videos from (potentially degraded) multi-modal inputs. Specifically,\n1) a differential reinforcement module is developed for cross-modal information\ninteraction and enhancement, 2) a complete modality-guided fusion strategy is\nemployed to adaptively integrate multi-modal features, and 3) a bi-temporal\nco-attention mechanism is devised to dynamically aggregate forward-backward\ntemporal contexts to reinforce cross-frame feature representations.

Limited user-item\ninteractions confine unpopular items within embedding neighborhoods of few\nusers, leading to representation collapse and reduced model generalization.\nExisting supervised alignment and reweighting methods mitigate this bias but\nhave key limitations: (1) ignoring inherent variability across Graph\nConvolutional Networks (GCNs) layers, causing negative effects in deeper\nlayers; (2) reliance on fixed hyperparameters to balance item popularity,\nrestricting adaptability and increasing complexity.\n  To address these issues, we propose the Graph-Structured Dual Adaptation\nFramework (GSDA). Our theoretical analysis identifies a crucial limitation of\nsupervised alignment methods caused by over-smoothing in GCNs. As GCN layers\ndeepen, popular and unpopular items increasingly lose distinctiveness,\nquantified by reduced conditional entropy. This diminished distinctiveness\nweakens supervised alignment effectiveness in mitigating popularity bias.\nMotivated by this, GSDA captures structural and distribution characteristics\nfrom the adjacency matrix through a dual adaptive strategy. First, a\nhierarchical adaptive alignment mechanism uses the adjacency matrix's Frobenius\nnorm for layer-specific weight decay, countering conditional entropy reduction\neffects at deeper layers. Second, a distribution-aware dynamic contrast\nweighting strategy, guided by a real-time Gini coefficient, removes dependence\non fixed hyperparameters, enabling adaptability to diverse data. Experiments on\nthree benchmark datasets demonstrate GSDA significantly alleviates popularity\nbias and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art recommendation methods.",

    "abstract": "This manuscript concerns the stability conditions for the well-posedness of\nthe two-dimensional plasma-vacuum interface problems for ideal incompressible\nmagnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equations, which describe the dynamics of conducting\nperfect fluids in a vacuum region under the influence of magnetic fields. Due\nto the counterexamples constructed by C. Hao and the second author [Comm. Math.\nPhys. 376 (2020), 259-286], the plasma-vacuum problems violating the\nRayleigh-Taylor sign condition and without surface tension are believed to be\nhighly unstable or even ill-posed. However, based on a geometric perspective,\nwe demonstrate that, although the initial data provided therein are ill-posed\nin the Lagrangian framework characterizing the regularity of flow maps,\nplasma-vacuum problems with such initial data can still be stable/well-posed in\nthe Eulerian setting without involving flow maps, under the hypothesis that the\ntotal magnetic fields are non-degenerate on the free boundary. This discloses\nthe essential difference between the Eulerian and Lagrangian frameworks of MHD\nfree boundary problems and the stabilizing effect of the magnetic field. We\nalso consider the surface tension effect and establish the local well-posedness\ntheories in standard Sobolev spaces in this case. Furthermore, under either the\nnon-degeneracy assumption on magnetic fields or the Rayleigh-Taylor sign\ncondition on the effective pressure, we prove vanishing surface tension limits.\nThese results indicate that both capillary forces and non-degenerate tangential\nmagnetic fields can stabilize the motion of the plasma-vacuum interface, and\nthe stabilizing effect of surface tension is stronger than that of the\ntangential magnetic fields.",

To extract a subset of sparse\nprincipal components, we further incorporate a deflation technique and\nsubsequently transform the original high-dimensional face data into a\nlower-dimensional feature space. Experimental evaluations on a face recognition\ndataset-using both k-nearest neighbor and kernel ridge regression\nclassifiers-demonstrate that the proposed sparse PCA methods consistently\nachieve higher classification accuracy than conventional PCA.

The hardware unit of the system is comprised of a wireless\nmicrocontroller unit, current and voltage sensor, IEQ sensors, and power\nmanagement unit that enables the acquisition, processing, and telemetering of\nenergy and IEQ data. The software unit is made up of embedded software and a\nweb-based information provision unit that handles real-time data analysis,\ntransmission, and visualization on the web and provides relevant notifications\nto the end users about energy consumption patterns. The proposed system\nprovides a promising solution for real-time information exchange regarding\nenergy consumption and IEQ for both end-users and managers that will enhance\neffective building energy and environmental management.",

As a result, we observe a\nthreshold in the spin-wave amplitude beyond which nonlinear effects become\nevident and confirm that this threshold is consistent with theoretical\npredictions based on four-magnon scattering for both samples. Moreover, as the\namplitude of the spin waves increases, modulation of the wavenumber is observed\nacross the field of view.

To address this challenge, we propose LaViC (Large Vision-Language\nConversational Recommendation Framework), a novel approach that integrates\ncompact image representations into dialogue-based recommendation systems. LaViC\nleverages a large vision-language model in a two-stage process: (1) visual\nknowledge self-distillation, which condenses product images from hundreds of\ntokens into a small set of visual tokens in a self-distillation manner,\nsignificantly reducing computational overhead, and (2) recommendation prompt\ntuning, which enables the model to incorporate both dialogue context and\ndistilled visual tokens, providing a unified mechanism for capturing textual\nand visual features.

    "abstract": "Emergence, the phenomenon of a rapid performance increase once the model\nscale reaches a threshold, has achieved widespread attention recently. The\nliterature has observed that monosemantic neurons in neural networks gradually\ndiminish as the model scale increases. Subsequently, Learning From Emergence is\nproposed to actively inhibit monosemantic neurons in relatively small neural\nnetworks (e.g., BERT and Swin-Transformer) for promoting model performance with\nfine-tuning. However, to ultimately achieve emergence, it is demanding to\nsupport the monosemantic neuron inhibition in the pretraining phase of\nlarge-scale models. Thus, this work further pushes the boundary of this\nresearch direction to be Learning Towards Emergence (L2E) and enables the\ntraining and validating of the impact of inhibiting monosemantic neurons on\nlarger pre-trained neural networks (e.g., Pythia-70M, 410M, and 2.8B). More\nspecifically, to bridge the gap in current research, we first conduct\nexperiments on models of various scales (up to 6.9B) to validate the\nmonosemantic ideas. Then, we present a novel method L2E to address the\ninefficient monosemantic neuron retrieval and ineffective monosemantic neuron\ninhibition when existing methods are applied in the pretraining phase of\nlarge-scale models. It employs an adjustable thresholding technique for\nefficient neuron retrieval, incorporates a False Killing Rate metric to assess\ninhibition effects, and proposes a regularization-style inhibition approach,\nwhich addresses the limitations of previous approaches in both efficiency and\neffectiveness. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of L2E's\nmonosemantic neuron inhibition and its efficiency in implementation with\nlarge-scale models.",

    "abstract": "The international collaboration designing and constructing the Deep\nUnderground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) at the Long-Baseline Neutrino Facility\n(LBNF) has developed a two-phase strategy for the implementation of this\nleading-edge, large-scale science project. The 2023 report of the US Particle\nPhysics Project Prioritization Panel (P5) reaffirmed this vision and strongly\nendorsed DUNE Phase I and Phase II, as did the previous European Strategy for\nParticle Physics. The construction of DUNE Phase I is well underway. DUNE Phase\nII consists of a third and fourth far detector module, an upgraded near\ndetector complex, and an enhanced > 2 MW beam. The fourth FD module is\nconceived as a 'Module of Opportunity', aimed at supporting the core DUNE\nscience program while also expanding the physics opportunities with more\nadvanced technologies. The DUNE collaboration is submitting four main\ncontributions to the 2026 Update of the European Strategy for Particle Physics\nprocess. This submission to the 'Detector instrumentation' stream focuses on\ntechnologies and R&D for the DUNE Phase II detectors. Additional inputs related\nto the DUNE science program, DUNE software and computing, and European\ncontributions to Fermilab accelerator upgrades and facilities for the DUNE\nexperiment, are also being submitted to other streams.",

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning paradigm enabling\nmultiple clients to train a model collaboratively without exposing their local\ndata. Among FL schemes, clustering is an effective technique addressing the\nheterogeneity issue (i.e., differences in data distribution and computational\nability affect training performance and effectiveness) via grouping\nparticipants with similar computational resources or data distribution into\nclusters. However, intra-cluster data exchange poses privacy risks, while\ncluster selection and adaptation introduce challenges that may affect overall\nperformance. To address these challenges, this paper introduces anonymous\nadaptive clustering, a novel approach that simultaneously enhances privacy\nprotection and boosts training efficiency. Specifically, an oblivious\nshuffle-based anonymization method is designed to safeguard user identities and\nprevent the aggregation server from inferring similarities through clustering.\nAdditionally, to improve performance, we introduce an iteration-based adaptive\nfrequency decay strategy, which leverages variability in clustering\nprobabilities to optimize training dynamics. With these techniques, we build\nthe FedCAPrivacy; experiments show that FedCAPrivacy achieves ~7X improvement\nin terms of performance while maintaining high privacy.",

VT migration is an effective\nway that migrates the VT when the locations of physical entities keep changing\nto maintain seamless immersive VT services. However, an efficient VT migration\nis challenging due to the rapid movement of vehicles, dynamic workloads of\nRoadside Units (RSUs), and heterogeneous resources of the RSUs. To achieve\nefficient migration decisions and a minimum latency for the VT migration, we\npropose a multi-agent split Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) framework\ncombined with spatio-temporal trajectory generation. In this framework,\nmultiple split DRL agents utilize split architecture to efficiently determine\nVT migration decisions. Furthermore, we propose a spatio-temporal trajectory\ngeneration algorithm based on trajectory datasets and road network data to\nsimulate vehicle trajectories, enhancing the generalization of the proposed\nscheme for managing VT migration in dynamic network environments. Finally,\nexperimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme not only enhances the\nQuality of Experience (QoE) by 29% but also reduces the computational parameter\ncount by approximately 25% while maintaining similar performances, enhancing\nusers' immersive experiences in vehicular metaverses.",

    "abstract": "Neural networks have emerged as powerful tools for modeling complex physical\nsystems, yet balancing high accuracy with computational efficiency remains a\ncritical challenge in their convergence behavior. In this work, we propose the\nHybrid Parallel Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) and Multi-Layer Perceptron\n(MLP) Physics-Informed Neural Network (HPKM-PINN), a novel architecture that\nsynergistically integrates parallelized KAN and MLP branches within a unified\nPINN framework. The HPKM-PINN introduces a scaling factor {\\xi}, to optimally\nbalance the complementary strengths of KAN's interpretable function\napproximation and MLP's nonlinear feature learning, thereby enhancing\npredictive performance through a weighted fusion of their outputs. Through\nsystematic numerical evaluations, we elucidate the impact of the scaling factor\n{\\xi} on the model's performance in both function approximation and partial\ndifferential equation (PDE) solving tasks. Benchmark experiments across\ncanonical PDEs, such as the Poisson and Advection equations, demonstrate that\nHPKM-PINN achieves a marked decrease in loss values (reducing relative error by\ntwo orders of magnitude) compared to standalone KAN or MLP models. Furthermore,\nthe framework exhibits numerical stability and robustness when applied to\nvarious physical systems. These findings highlight the HPKM-PINN's ability to\nleverage KAN's interpretability and MLP's expressivity, positioning it as a\nversatile and scalable tool for solving complex PDE-driven problems in\ncomputational science and engineering.",

    "abstract": "Federated Learning is a popular paradigm that enables remote clients to\njointly train a global model without sharing their raw data. However, FL has\nbeen shown to be vulnerable towards model poisoning attacks due to its\ndistributed nature. Particularly, attackers acting as participants can upload\narbitrary model updates that effectively compromise the global model of FL.\nWhile extensive research has been focusing on fighting against these attacks,\nwe find that most of them assume data at remote clients are under iid while in\npractice they are inevitably non-iid. Our benchmark evaluations reveal that\nexisting defenses generally fail to live up to their reputation when applied to\nvarious non-iid scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel approach,\nGeminiGuard, that aims to address such a significant gap. We design GeminiGuard\nto be lightweight, versatile, and unsupervised so that it aligns well with the\npractical requirements of deploying such defenses. The key challenge from\nnon-iids is that they make benign model updates look more similar to malicious\nones. GeminiGuard is mainly built on two fundamental observations: (1) existing\ndefenses based on either model-weight analysis or latent-space analysis face\nlimitations in covering different MPAs and non-iid scenarios, and (2)\nmodel-weight and latent-space analysis are sufficiently different yet\npotentially complementary methods as MPA defenses. We hence incorporate a novel\nmodel-weight analysis component as well as a custom latent-space analysis\ncomponent in GeminiGuard, aiming to further enhance its defense performance. We\nconduct extensive experiments to evaluate our defense across various settings,\ndemonstrating its effectiveness in countering multiple types of untargeted and\ntargeted MPAs, including adaptive ones. Our comprehensive evaluations show that\nGeminiGuard consistently outperforms SOTA defenses under various settings.",

    "abstract": "DNA toroids are compact torus-shaped bundles formed by one or multiple DNA\nmolecules being condensed from the solution due to various condensing agents.\nIt has been shown that the DNA toroidal bundles are twisted. However, the\nglobal conformations of DNA inside these bundles are still not well understood.\nIn this study, we investigate this issue by solving different models for the\ntoroidal bundles and performing replica-exchange molecular dynamics (REMD)\nsimulations for self-attractive stiff polymers of various chain lengths. We\nfind that a moderate degree of twisting is energetically favorable for toroidal\nbundles, yielding optimal configurations of lower energies than in other\nbundles corresponding to spool-like and constant radius of curvature\narrangements. The REMD simulations show that the ground states of the stiff\npolymers are twisted toroidal bundles with the average twist degrees close to\nthose predicted by the theoretical model. Constant-temperature simulations show\nthat twisted toroidal bundles can be formed through successive processes of\nnucleation, growth, quick tightening and slow tightening of the toroid, with\nthe two last processes facilitating the polymer threading through the toroid's\nhole. A relatively long chain of 512 beads has an increased dynamical\ndifficulty to access the twisted bundle states due to the polymer's topological\nconstraint. Interestingly, we also observed significantly twisted toroidal\nbundles with a sharp U-shaped region in the polymer conformation. It is\nsuggested that this U-shaped region makes the formation of twisted bundles\neasier by effectively reducing the polymer length. This effect can be\nequivalent to having multiple chains in the toroid.",

To propagate such temporally sparse sketch conditions across all\nframes, we propose an inter-frame attention mechanism to analyze the\nrelationship between the keyframes and each video frame. For sketch-based video\nediting, we design an additional video insertion module that maintains\nconsistency between the newly edited content and the original video's spatial\nfeature and dynamic motion.

    "abstract": "Estimating camera motion and intrinsics from casual videos is a core\nchallenge in computer vision. Traditional bundle-adjustment based methods, such\nas SfM and SLAM, struggle to perform reliably on arbitrary data. Although\nspecialized SfM approaches have been developed for handling dynamic scenes,\nthey either require intrinsics or computationally expensive test-time\noptimization and often fall short in performance. Recently, methods like Dust3r\nhave reformulated the SfM problem in a more data-driven way. While such\ntechniques show promising results, they are still 1) not robust towards dynamic\nobjects and 2) require labeled data for supervised training. As an alternative,\nwe propose AnyCam, a fast transformer model that directly estimates camera\nposes and intrinsics from a dynamic video sequence in feed-forward fashion. Our\nintuition is that such a network can learn strong priors over realistic camera\nposes. To scale up our training, we rely on an uncertainty-based loss\nformulation and pre-trained depth and flow networks instead of motion or\ntrajectory supervision. This allows us to use diverse, unlabelled video\ndatasets obtained mostly from YouTube. Additionally, we ensure that the\npredicted trajectory does not accumulate drift over time through a lightweight\ntrajectory refinement step. We test AnyCam on established datasets, where it\ndelivers accurate camera poses and intrinsics both qualitatively and\nquantitatively. Furthermore, even with trajectory refinement, AnyCam is\nsignificantly faster than existing works for SfM in dynamic settings. Finally,\nby combining camera information, uncertainty, and depth, our model can produce\nhigh-quality 4D pointclouds.",

Fine-tuned clinical large language models (cLLMs) can assist\nin this process while ensuring the protection of sensitive data via on-premises\ndeployment. This study evaluates the performance of cLLMs in recognizing\nCC/HPI/PFSH-related MHEs and examines how note characteristics impact model\naccuracy. We annotated 1,449 MHEs across 61 outpatient-related clinical notes\nfrom the MTSamples repository. To recognize these entities, we fine-tuned seven\nstate-of-the-art cLLMs. Additionally, we assessed the models' performance when\nenhanced by integrating, problems, tests, treatments, and other basic medical\nentities (BMEs). We compared the performance of these models against GPT-4o in\na zero-shot setting. To further understand the textual characteristics\naffecting model accuracy, we conducted an error analysis focused on note\nlength, entity length, and segmentation. The cLLMs showed potential in reducing\nthe time required for extracting MHEs by over 20%. However, detecting many\ntypes of MHEs remained challenging due to their polysemous nature and the\nfrequent involvement of non-medical vocabulary. Fine-tuned GatorTron and\nGatorTronS, two of the most extensively trained cLLMs, demonstrated the highest\nperformance. Integrating pre-identified BME information improved model\nperformance for certain entities. Regarding the impact of textual\ncharacteristics on model performance, we found that longer entities were harder\nto identify, note length did not correlate with a higher error rate, and\nwell-organized segments with headings are beneficial for the extraction.",

In this study, we investigate the impact of\nsolvation on the folding of lattice proteins by using Monte Carlo simulations.\nThe proteins are modelled as self-avoiding 27-mer chains on a cubic lattice,\nwith compact native states and structure-based G\\=o potentials. Each residue\nthat makes no contacts with other residues in a given protein conformation is\nassigned a solvation energy {\\epsilon}_s , representing its full exposure to\nthe solvent. We find that a negative {\\epsilon}_s , indicating a favorable\nsolvation, increases the cooperativity of the folding transition by lowering\nthe free energy of the unfolded state, increasing the folding free energy\nbarrier, and narrowing the folding routes. This favorable solvation also\nsignificantly improves the correlation between folding rates and the native\ntopology, measured by the relative contact order. Our results suggest that G\\=o\nmodel may overestimate the importance of native interactions and a solvation\npotential countering the native bias can play a significant role. The solvation\nenergy in our model can be related to the polar interaction between water and\npeptide groups in the protein backbone. It is therefore suggested that the\nsolvation of peptide groups may significantly contribute to the exceptional\nfolding cooperativity and the pronounced topology-dependence of folding rates\nobserved in two-state proteins.",

Results demonstrate\nthe critical importance of overlapping patches, yielding superior performance\nin 44 of 48 experiments in a structured study. Moreover, upon comparing the\nresults of the overlapping patches with the non-overlapping configurations, the\nincrease is significant, reaching up to 10% for the EarVN1.0 dataset. In terms\nof model performance, the ViT-T model consistently outperformed the ViT-S,\nViT-B, and ViT-L models on the AWE, WPUT, and EarVN1.0 datasets. The highest\nscores were achieved in a configuration with a patch size of 28x28 and a stride\nof 14 pixels.

This allows the model to\nfocus on essential contextual information without fully processing all tokens.\nUnlike previous methods such as H2O and SnapKV, which perform compression only\nafter processing the entire input, or GemFilter, which selects a fixed portion\nof the initial prompt without considering contextual dependencies,\nPromptDistill dynamically allocates computational resources to the most\nrelevant tokens while maintaining a global awareness of the input.

With a single-stage selection strategy,\nPromptDistill effectively balances performance and efficiency, outperforming\nprior methods like GemFilter, H2O, and SnapKV due to its superior ability to\nretain essential information.

The method is inspired by Toubia et al. (2004)\nfor elicitation of the linear multi-variate utility and the success of the\nmodification needs to overcome two main difficulties. First, we use the\ncontinuous piecewise linear function (PLF) to approximate the nonlinear utility\nand represent the PLF in terms of the vector of increments of linear pieces.\nSubsequently, elicitation of the nonlinear utility corresponds to reducing the\npolyhedral feasible set of the vectors of increments. Second, we reduce the\nsize of the polyhedron by successive hyperplane cuts constructed by adaptively\ngenerating new queries (pairwise comparison lotteries) where the parameters of\nthe lotteries are obtained by solving some optimization problems. In this\nreduction procedure, direction error of the cut hyperplane may occur due to the\nPLF approximation error. To tackle the issue, we develop a strategy by adding\nthe support points of new lotteries to the set of breakpoints of the PLF. As an\napplication, we use all the responses to the queries to construct an ambiguity\nset of utility functions which allows one to make decisions based on the\nworst-case utility and apply the modified polyhedral method in a preference\nrobust optimization problem with proper conservatism reduction scheme. The\npreliminary numerical test results show that the proposed methods work very\nwell.",

    "abstract": "Human action recognition in low-light environments is crucial for various\nreal-world applications. However, the existing approaches overlook the full\nutilization of brightness information throughout the training phase, leading to\nsuboptimal performance. To address this limitation, we propose OwlSight, a\nbiomimetic-inspired framework with whole-stage illumination enhancement to\ninteract with action classification for accurate dark video human action\nrecognition. Specifically, OwlSight incorporates a Time-Consistency Module\n(TCM) to capture shallow spatiotemporal features meanwhile maintaining temporal\ncoherence, which are then processed by a Luminance Adaptation Module (LAM) to\ndynamically adjust the brightness based on the input luminance distribution.\nFurthermore, a Reflect Augmentation Module (RAM) is presented to maximize\nillumination utilization and simultaneously enhance action recognition via two\ninteractive paths. Additionally, we build Dark-101, a large-scale dataset\ncomprising 18,310 dark videos across 101 action categories, significantly\nsurpassing existing datasets (e.g., ARID1.5 and Dark-48) in scale and\ndiversity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed OwlSight\nachieves state-of-the-art performance across four low-light action recognition\nbenchmarks. Notably, it outperforms previous best approaches by 5.36% on\nARID1.5 and 1.72% on Dark-101, highlighting its effectiveness in challenging\ndark environments.",

    "abstract": "Transformer architectures prominently lead single-image super-resolution\n(SISR) benchmarks, reconstructing high-resolution (HR) images from their\nlow-resolution (LR) counterparts. Their strong representative power, however,\ncomes with a higher demand for training data compared to convolutional neural\nnetworks (CNNs). For many real-world SR applications, the availability of\nhigh-quality HR training images is not given, sparking interest in LR-only\ntraining methods. The LR-only SISR benchmark mimics this condition by allowing\nonly low-resolution (LR) images for model training. For a 4x super-resolution,\nthis effectively reduces the amount of available training data to 6.25% of the\nHR image pixels, which puts the employment of a data-hungry transformer model\ninto question. In this work, we are the first to utilize a lightweight vision\ntransformer model with LR-only training methods addressing the unsupervised\nSISR LR-only benchmark. We adopt and configure a recent LR-only training method\nfrom microscopy image super-resolution to macroscopic real-world data,\nresulting in our multi-scale training method for bicubic degradation (MSTbic).\nFurthermore, we compare it with reference methods and prove its effectiveness\nboth for a transformer and a CNN model. We evaluate on the classic SR benchmark\ndatasets Set5, Set14, BSD100, Urban100, and Manga109, and show superior\nperformance over state-of-the-art (so far: CNN-based) LR-only SISR methods.

    "abstract": "A common problem in justice applications is localization of a user of a\ncellular network using a call detail record (CDR), which typically reveals only\nthe base station and sector to which the user was connected. This precludes\nprecise estimation of location. Instead, one is limited to estimating a region\nof plausible locations (RPL) using static information such as sector antenna\norientation, beamwidth, and locations of nearby base stations. In this paper,\nwe propose a method for RPL estimation in which the shape bounding the RPL is\nderived from a model of the antenna pattern via the Friis Transmission\nEquation, and the size of the RPL is determined by mean distance to nearby base\nstations. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated by \"best server\"\nanalysis of measurements acquired from drive testing in the vicinity of Winter\nGarden, Florida, observing three 700 MHz-band LTE cellular networks serving\nthis area. Of the 16 sectors evaluated, the aggregate error rate (i.e.,\nfraction of users located outside the RPL estimated for the associated sector)\nis found to be 1.3%, with worst per-sector error rate of about 13.3% and error\nrates below 1.8% for 13 of the 16 sectors. The principal difficulty is shown to\nbe estimation of RPL size, which entails a tradeoff between minimizing RPL area\n(yielding the \"tightest\" localization) and minimizing error rate.",

    "abstract": "The overwhelming majority of homeless individuals are jobless, despite many\nexpressing a willingness to work. While this strong individual-level link\nbetween homelessness and unemployment is well-documented, the broader impact of\nlabor market dynamics on homelessness remains largely unexplored. To fill this\ngap, this paper investigates the impact of local labor market conditions on the\nduration of homelessness, using individuals' homeless shelter usage records as\na proxy for measuring their homelessness duration. Specifically, drawing on\nCanada's National Homelessness Information System data from 2014 to 2017, we\nanalyze how local employment growth and changes in the local employment rate\naffect shelter usage duration. Our findings reveal that a 1% increase in local\nemployment is associated with a 0.11-quarter (approximately 0.33-month)\nreduction in the average duration of shelter usage, while a 1% rise in the\nlocal employment rate leads to a 0.34-quarter (approximately 1.02-month)\nreduction. These changes correspond to decreases of 2.9% and 8.9%,\nrespectively, in the average duration of shelter stays. The findings underscore\nthe critical role of employment opportunities in reducing homelessness and lend\nsupport to job-oriented policy interventions for the homeless. In addition, the\nresults suggest that demographic disparities-particularly the\noverrepresentation of Indigenous people and men among the homeless-are\npartially explained by slower exit rates from homelessness within these groups.",
